0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
A year ago, I spoke to you about a book

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that I was just in the process of completing,

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that has come out in the interim, and I would like to talk to you today

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
about some of the controversies that that book inspired.

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The book is called "The Blank Slate,"

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
based on the popular idea

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that the human mind is a blank slate,

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and that all of its structure comes from

9
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
socialization, culture, parenting, experience.

10
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The "blank slate" was an influential idea in the 20th century.

11
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Here are a few quotes indicating that:

12
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
"Man has no nature," from the historian

13
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Jose Ortega y Gasset;

14
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
"Man has no instincts," from the

15
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
anthropologist Ashley Montagu;

16
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
"The human brain is capable of a full range of behaviors

17
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and predisposed to none," from the late scientist Stephen Jay Gould.

18
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
There are a number of reasons to doubt that the human mind

19
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is a blank slate,

20
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and some of them just come from common sense.

21
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
As many people have told me over the years,

22
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
anyone who's had more than one child

23
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
knows that kids come into the world

24
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with certain temperaments and talents;

25
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it doesn't all come from the outside.

26
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Oh, and anyone who

27
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
has both a child and a house pet

28
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
has surely noticed that the child, exposed to speech,

29
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
will acquire a human language,

30
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
whereas the house pet won't,

31
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
presumably because of some innate different between them.

32
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And anyone who's ever been

33
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in a heterosexual relationship knows that

34
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the minds of men and the minds of women are not indistinguishable.

35
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
There are also, I think,

36
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
increasing results from

37
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the scientific study of humans

38
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that, indeed, we're not born blank slates.

39
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
One of them, from anthropology,

40
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
is the study of human universals.

41
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
If you've ever taken anthropology, you know that it's a --

42
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
kind of an occupational

43
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
pleasure of anthropologists to show

44
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
how exotic other cultures can be,

45
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and that there are places out there where, supposedly,

46
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
everything is the opposite to the way it is here.

47
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But if you instead

48
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
look at what is common to the world's cultures,

49
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
you find that there is an enormously rich set

50
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
of behaviors and emotions

51
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and ways of construing the world

52
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that can be found in all of the world's 6,000-odd cultures.

53
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The anthropologist Donald Brown has tried to list them all,

54
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and they range from aesthetics,

55
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
affection and age statuses

56
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
all the way down to weaning, weapons, weather,

57
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
attempts to control, the color white

58
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and a worldview.

59
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Also, genetics and neuroscience

60
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
are increasingly showing that the brain

61
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is intricately structured.

62
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This is a recent study by the neurobiologist Paul Thompson

63
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
and his colleagues in which they --

64
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
using MRI --

65
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
measured the distribution of gray matter --

66
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that is, the outer layer of the cortex --

67
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in a large sample of pairs of people.

68
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They coded correlations in the thickness

69
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
of gray matter in different parts of the brain

70
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
using a false color scheme, in which

71
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
no difference is coded as purple,

72
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and any color other than purple indicates

73
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
a statistically significant correlation.

74
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Well, this is what happens when you pair people up at random.

75
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
By definition, two people picked at random

76
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
can't have correlations in the distribution

77
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
of gray matter in the cortex.

78
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This is what happens in people who share

79
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
half of their DNA -- fraternal twins.

80
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And as you can see, large amounts of the brain

81
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
are not purple, showing that if one person

82
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
has a thicker bit of cortex

83
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in that region, so does his fraternal twin.

84
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And here's what happens if you

85
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
get a pair of people who share all their DNA --

86
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
namely, clones or identical twins.

87
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And you can see huge areas of cortex where there are

88
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
massive correlations in the distribution of gray matter.

89
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Now, these aren't just

90
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
differences in anatomy,

91
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
like the shape of your ear lobes,

92
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but they have consequences in thought and behavior

93
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that are well illustrated in this famous cartoon by Charles Addams:

94
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"Separated at birth, the Mallifert twins meet accidentally."

95
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
As you can see, there are two inventors

96
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
with identical contraptions in their lap, meeting

97
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in the waiting room of a patent attorney.

98
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now, the cartoon is not such an exaggeration, because

99
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
studies of identical twins who were separated at birth

100
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and then tested in adulthood

101
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
show that they have astonishing similarities.

102
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And this happens in every pair of identical twins

103
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
separated at birth ever studied --

104
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but much less so with fraternal twins separated at birth.

105
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
My favorite example is a pair of twins,

106
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
one of whom was brought up

107
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
as a Catholic in a Nazi family in Germany,

108
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
the other brought up in a Jewish family in Trinidad.

109
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
When they walked into the lab in Minnesota,

110
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
they were wearing identical navy blue shirts with epaulettes;

111
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
both of them liked to dip buttered toast in coffee,

112
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
both of them kept rubber bands around their wrists,

113
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
both of them flushed the toilet before using it as well as after,

114
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and both of them liked to surprise people

115
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
by sneezing in crowded elevators to watch them jump.

116
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now --

117
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the story might seem to good to be true,

118
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but when you administer

119
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
batteries of psychological tests,

120
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
you get the same results -- namely,

121
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
identical twins separated at birth show

122
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
quite astonishing similarities.

123
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, given both the common sense

124
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and scientific data

125
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
calling the doctrine of the blank slate into question,

126
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
why should it have been such an appealing notion?

127
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Well, there are a number of political reasons why people have found it congenial.

128
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
The foremost is that if we're blank slates,

129
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
then, by definition, we are equal,

130
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
because zero equals zero equals zero.

131
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But if something is written on the slate,

132
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
then some people could have more of it than others,

133
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and according to this line of thinking, that would justify

134
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
discrimination and inequality.

135
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Another political fear of human nature

136
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is that if we are blank slates,

137
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
we can perfect mankind --

138
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the age-old dream of the perfectibility of our species

139
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
through social engineering.

140
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Whereas, if we're born with certain instincts,

141
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
then perhaps some of them might condemn us

142
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to selfishness, prejudice and violence.

143
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Well, in the book, I argue that these are, in fact, non sequiturs.

144
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And just to make a long story short:

145
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
first of all, the concept of fairness

146
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
is not the same as the concept of sameness.

147
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And so when Thomas Jefferson wrote

148
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in the Declaration of Independence,

149
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
"We hold these truths to be self-evident,

150
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that all men are created equal,"

151
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
he did not mean "We hold these truths to be self-evident,

152
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that all men are clones."

153
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Rather, that all men are equal in terms of their rights,

154
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and that every person ought to be treated

155
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
as an individual, and not prejudged

156
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
by the statistics of particular groups

157
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that they may belong to.

158
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Also, even if we were born

159
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
with certain ignoble motives,

160
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
they don't automatically lead to ignoble behavior.

161
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
That is because the human mind

162
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is a complex system with many parts,

163
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and some of them can inhibit others.

164
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
For example, there's excellent reason to believe

165
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that virtually all humans are born with a moral sense,

166
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and that we have cognitive abilities that allow us

167
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to profit from the lessons of history.

168
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So even if people did have impulses

169
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
towards selfishness or greed,

170
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that's not the only thing in the skull,

171
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and there are other parts of the mind that can counteract them.

172
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
In the book, I

173
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
go over controversies such as this one,

174
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and a number of other hot buttons,

175
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
hot zones, Chernobyls, third rails, and so on --

176
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
including the arts, cloning, crime,

177
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
free will, education, evolution,

178
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
gender differences, God, homosexuality,

179
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
infanticide, inequality, Marxism, morality,

180
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Nazism, parenting, politics,

181
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
race, rape, religion, resource depletion,

182
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
social engineering, technological risk and war.

183
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And needless to say, there were certain risks

184
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
in taking on these subjects.

185
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
When I wrote a first draft of the book,

186
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I circulated it to a number of colleagues for comments,

187
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and here are some of

188
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the reactions that I got:

189
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
"Better get a security camera for your house."

190
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
"Don't expect to get any more awards, job offers

191
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
or positions in scholarly societies."

192
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
"Tell your publisher not to list your hometown

193
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in your author bio."

194
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
"Do you have tenure?"

195
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

196
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Well, the book came out in October,

197
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and nothing terrible has happened.

198
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I -- I like --

199
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
There was indeed reason to be nervous,

200
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and there were moments in which I did feel nervous,

201
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
knowing the history

202
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
of what has happened to people

203
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
who've taken controversial stands

204
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
or discovered disquieting findings

205
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in the behavioral sciences.

206
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
There are many cases, some of which I talk about in the book,

207
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
of people who have been slandered, called Nazis,

208
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
physically assaulted, threatened with criminal prosecution

209
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
for stumbling across or arguing

210
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
about controversial findings.

211
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And you never know when you're going to

212
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
come across one of these booby traps.

213
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
My favorite example is a pair of psychologists

214
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
who did research on left-handers,

215
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and published some data showing that left-handers are, on average,

216
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
more susceptible to disease, more prone to accidents

217
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and have a shorter lifespan.

218
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It's not clear, by the way, since then,

219
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
whether that is an accurate generalization,

220
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
but the data at the time seemed to support that.

221
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Well, pretty soon they were barraged

222
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
with enraged letters,

223
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
death threats,

224
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
ban on the topic in a number of scientific journals,

225
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
coming from irate left-handers

226
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and their advocates,

227
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and they were literally afraid to open their mail

228
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because of the venom and vituperation

229
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that they had inadvertently inspired.

230
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Well,

231
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the night is young, but the book has been out

232
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
for half a year,

233
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and nothing terrible has happened.

234
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
None of the dire professional consequences

235
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
has taken place --

236
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I haven't been

237
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
exiled from the city of Cambridge.

238
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
But what I wanted to talk about

239
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
are two of these hot buttons

240
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that have aroused the strongest response

241
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
in the 80-odd reviews

242
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that The Blank Slate has received.

243
0:10:50.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I'll just put that list up for a few seconds,

244
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and see if you can guess which two

245
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
-- I would estimate that probably two of these topics

246
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
inspired probably 90 percent

247
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
of the reaction in the various reviews

248
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and radio interviews.

249
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It's not violence and war,

250
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
it's not race, it's not gender,

251
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
it's not Marxism, it's not Nazism.

252
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They are: the arts and parenting.

253
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Laughter)

254
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So let me tell you what

255
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
aroused such irate responses,

256
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and I'll let you decide if whether they --

257
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
the claims are really that outrageous.

258
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Let me start with the arts.

259
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I note that among the long list of human universals

260
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that I presented a few slides ago

261
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
are art.

262
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
There is no society ever discovered

263
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
in the remotest corner of the world that has not had something

264
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that we would consider the arts.

265
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Visual arts -- decoration of surfaces and bodies --

266
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
appears to be a human universal.

267
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
The telling of stories, music,

268
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
dance, poetry -- found in all cultures,

269
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and many of the motifs and themes

270
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that

271
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
give us pleasure in the arts

272
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
can be found in all human societies:

273
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
a preference for symmetrical forms,

274
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the use of repetition and variation,

275
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
even things as specific as the fact

276
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
that in poetry all over the world,

277
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
you have lines that are very close

278
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to three seconds long, separated by pauses.

279
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Now, on the other hand,

280
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
in the second half of the 20th century,

281
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
the arts are frequently said to be in decline.

282
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And I have a collection,

283
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
probably 10 or 15 headlines, from highbrow magazines

284
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
deploring the fact that

285
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
the arts are in decline in our time.

286
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I'll give you a couple of representative quotes:

287
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
"We can assert with some confidence that our own period is

288
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
one of decline, that the standards of culture are lower

289
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
than they were 50 years ago, and that the evidences of this decline

290
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
are visible in every department of human activity."

291
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
That's a quote from T. S. Eliot, a little more than 50 years ago.

292
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And a more recent one:

293
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
"The possibility of sustaining high culture in our time

294
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
is becoming increasing problematical.

295
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Serious book stores are losing their franchise,

296
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
nonprofit theaters are surviving primarily

297
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
by commercializing their repertory,

298
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
symphony orchestras are diluting their programs,

299
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
public television is increasing its dependence

300
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
on reruns of British sitcoms,

301
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
classical radio stations are dwindling,

302
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
museums are resorting to blockbuster shows, dance is dying."

303
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
That's from Robert Brustein,

304
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the famous drama critic and director,

305
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
in The New Republic about five years ago.

306
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Well, in fact, the arts are not in decline.

307
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I don't think this will as a surprise to anyone in this room,

308
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
but by any standard

309
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
they have never been flourishing

310
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
to a greater extent.

311
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
There are, of course, entirely new art forms

312
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and new media, many of which you've heard

313
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
over these few days.

314
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
By any economic standard,

315
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
the demand for art of all forms

316
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:55,000
is skyrocketing,

317
0:13:55.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
as you can tell from the price of opera tickets,

318
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
by the number of books sold,

319
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
by the number of books published,

320
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
the number of musical titles released,

321
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
the number of new albums and so on.

322
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
The only grain of truth to this

323
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
complaint that the arts are in decline

324
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
come from three spheres.

325
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
One of them is in elite art since the 1930s --

326
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:2,000
say, the kinds of works performed

327
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
by major symphony orchestras,

328
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
where most of the repertory is before 1930,

329
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
or the works shown in

330
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
major galleries and prestigious museums.

331
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
In literary criticism and analysis,

332
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
probably 40 or 50 years ago,

333
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
literary critics were a kind of cultural hero;

334
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
now they're kind of a national joke.

335
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And the humanities and arts programs

336
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
in the universities, which by many measures,

337
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
indeed are in decline.

338
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Students are staying away in droves,

339
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
universities are disinvesting

340
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
in the arts and humanities.

341
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Well, here's a diagnosis.

342
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:14:59,000
They didn't ask me, but by their own admission,

343
0:14:59.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
they need all the help that they can get.

344
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And I would like to suggest that it's not a coincidence

345
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
that this supposed decline

346
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
in the elite arts and criticism

347
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
occurred in the same point in history in which

348
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
there was a widespread denial of human nature.

349
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
A famous quotation can be found --

350
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
if you look on the web, you can find it in

351
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
literally scores

352
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
of English core syllabuses --

353
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
"In or about December 1910,

354
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
human nature changed."

355
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
A paraphrase of a quote by Virginia Woolf,

356
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and there's some debate

357
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
as to what she actually meant by that.

358
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
But it's very clear, looking at these syllabuses,

359
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that -- it's used now

360
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
as a way of saying that all forms

361
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
of appreciation of art

362
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
that were in place for centuries, or millennia,

363
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
in the 20th century were discarded.

364
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
The beauty and pleasure in art --

365
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
probably a human universal --

366
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
were -- began to be considered saccharine,

367
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
or kitsch, or commercial.

368
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Barnett Newman had a famous quote that "the impulse of modern art

369
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
is the desire to destroy beauty" --

370
0:16:07.33,000 --> 0:16:1,000
which was considered bourgeois or tacky.

371
0:16:10.33,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And here's just one example.

372
0:16:12.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
I mean, this is perhaps a representative example

373
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
of the visual depiction of the female form

374
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
in the 15th century;

375
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:22,000
here is a representative example

376
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century.

377
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And, as you can see, there -- something has changed

378
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
in the way the elite arts

379
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
appeal to the senses.

380
0:16:32.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Indeed, in movements of modernism

381
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and post-modernism,

382
0:16:36.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
there was visual art without beauty,

383
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
literature without narrative and plot,

384
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
poetry without meter and rhyme,

385
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
architecture and planning without ornament,

386
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
human scale, green space and natural light,

387
0:16:47.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
music without melody and rhythm,

388
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and criticism without clarity,

389
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
attention to aesthetics and insight into the human condition.

390
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
(Laughter)

391
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Let me give just you an example to back up that last statement.

392
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
But here, there -- one of the most famous literary

393
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
English scholars of our time

394
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
is the Berkeley professor,

395
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Judith Butler.

396
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And here is an example of

397
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:12,000
one of her analyses:

398
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
"The move from a structuralist account in which capital

399
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:16,000
is understood to structure social relations

400
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
in relatively homologous ways

401
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
to a view of hegemony in which power relations are subject to repetition,

402
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
convergence and rearticulation

403
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
brought the question of temporality into the thinking of structure,

404
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and marked a shift from the form of Althusserian theory

405
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:31,000
that takes structural totalities as theoretical objects ..."

406
0:17:31.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Well, you get the idea.

407
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
By the way, this is one sentence --

408
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:39,000
you can actually parse it.

409
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Well, the argument in "The Blank Slate"

410
0:17:42.33,000 --> 0:17:44,000
was that elite art and criticism

411
0:17:44.33,000 --> 0:17:46,000
in the 20th century,

412
0:17:46.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
although not the arts in general,

413
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
have disdained beauty, pleasure,

414
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
clarity, insight and style.

415
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:56,000
People are staying away from elite art and criticism.

416
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
What a puzzle -- I wonder why.

417
0:18:00.33,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Well, this turned out to be probably

418
0:18:02.33,000 --> 0:18:04,000
the most controversial claim in the book.

419
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Someone asked me whether I stuck it in

420
0:18:06.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
in order to deflect ire

421
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
from discussions of gender and Nazism

422
0:18:12.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
and race and so on. I won't comment on that.

423
0:18:16.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
But it certainly inspired

424
0:18:19.33,000 --> 0:18:22,000
an energetic reaction

425
0:18:22.33,000 --> 0:18:25,000
from many university professors.

426
0:18:25.33,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Well, the other hot button is parenting.

427
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:31,000
And the starting point is the -- for that discussion

428
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:33,000
was the fact that we have all

429
0:18:33.33,000 --> 0:18:35,000
been subject to the advice

430
0:18:35.33,000 --> 0:18:38,000
of the parenting industrial complex.

431
0:18:38.33,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Now, here is -- here is a

432
0:18:40.33,000 --> 0:18:43,000
representative quote from a besieged mother:

433
0:18:43.33,000 --> 0:18:45,000
"I'm overwhelmed with parenting advice.

434
0:18:45.33,000 --> 0:18:47,000
I'm supposed to do lots of physical activity with my kids

435
0:18:47.33,000 --> 0:18:5,000
so I can instill in them a physical fitness habit

436
0:18:50.33,000 --> 0:18:52,000
so they'll grow up to be healthy adults.

437
0:18:52.33,000 --> 0:18:54,000
And I'm supposed to do all kinds of intellectual play

438
0:18:54.33,000 --> 0:18:56,000
so they'll grow up smart.

439
0:18:56.33,000 --> 0:18:59,000
And there are all kinds of play -- clay for finger dexterity,

440
0:18:59.33,000 --> 0:19:02,000
word games for reading success, large motor play,

441
0:19:02.33,000 --> 0:19:04,000
small motor play. I feel like I could devote my life

442
0:19:04.33,000 --> 0:19:07,000
to figuring out what to play with my kids."

443
0:19:07.33,000 --> 0:19:09,000
I think anyone who's recently been a parent can sympathize

444
0:19:09.33,000 --> 0:19:12,000
with this mother.

445
0:19:12.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
Well, here's some sobering facts about parenting.

446
0:19:15.33,000 --> 0:19:18,000
Most studies of parenting on which this advice is based

447
0:19:19.33,000 --> 0:19:22,000
are useless. They're useless because they don't control

448
0:19:22.33,000 --> 0:19:25,000
for heritability. They measure some correlation

449
0:19:25.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
between what the parents do, how the children turn out

450
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:3,000
and assume a causal relation:

451
0:19:30.33,000 --> 0:19:32,000
that the parenting shaped the child.

452
0:19:32.33,000 --> 0:19:34,000
Parents who talk a lot to their kids

453
0:19:34.33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
have kids who grow up to be articulate,

454
0:19:36.33,000 --> 0:19:38,000
parents who spank their kids have kids who grow up

455
0:19:38.33,000 --> 0:19:4,000
to be violent and so on.

456
0:19:40.33,000 --> 0:19:43,000
And very few of them control for the possibility

457
0:19:43.33,000 --> 0:19:46,000
that parents pass on genes for --

458
0:19:46.33,000 --> 0:19:48,000
that increase the chances a child will be articulate

459
0:19:48.33,000 --> 0:19:5,000
or violent and so on.

460
0:19:50.33,000 --> 0:19:53,000
Until the studies are redone with adoptive children,

461
0:19:53.33,000 --> 0:19:55,000
who provide an environment

462
0:19:55.33,000 --> 0:19:57,000
but not genes to their kids,

463
0:19:57.33,000 --> 0:20:,000
we have no way of knowing whether these conclusions are valid.

464
0:20:00.33,000 --> 0:20:02,000
The genetically controlled studies

465
0:20:02.33,000 --> 0:20:04,000
have some sobering results.

466
0:20:04.33,000 --> 0:20:06,000
Remember the Mallifert twins:

467
0:20:06.33,000 --> 0:20:09,000
separated at birth, then they meet in the patent office --

468
0:20:09.33,000 --> 0:20:11,000
remarkably similar.

469
0:20:11.33,000 --> 0:20:14,000
Well, what would have happened if the Mallifert twins had grown up together?

470
0:20:14.33,000 --> 0:20:17,000
You might think, well, then they'd be even more similar,

471
0:20:17.33,000 --> 0:20:19,000
because not only would they share their genes,

472
0:20:19.33,000 --> 0:20:22,000
but they would also share their environment.

473
0:20:22.33,000 --> 0:20:24,000
That would make them super-similar, right?

474
0:20:24.33,000 --> 0:20:27,000
Wrong. Identical twins, or any siblings,

475
0:20:27.33,000 --> 0:20:31,000
who are separated at birth are no less similar

476
0:20:31.33,000 --> 0:20:33,000
than if they had grown up together.

477
0:20:33.33,000 --> 0:20:35,000
Everything that happens to you in a given home

478
0:20:35.33,000 --> 0:20:37,000
over all of those years

479
0:20:37.33,000 --> 0:20:39,000
appears to leave no permanent stamp

480
0:20:39.33,000 --> 0:20:41,000
on your personality or intellect.

481
0:20:42.33,000 --> 0:20:45,000
A complementary finding, from a completely different methodology,

482
0:20:45.33,000 --> 0:20:49,000
is that adopted siblings reared together --

483
0:20:49.33,000 --> 0:20:51,000
the mirror image of identical twins reared apart,

484
0:20:51.33,000 --> 0:20:53,000
they share their parents, their home,

485
0:20:53.33,000 --> 0:20:55,000
their neighborhood,

486
0:20:55.33,000 --> 0:20:58,000
don't share their genes -- end up not similar at all.

487
0:20:58.33,000 --> 0:21:01,000
OK -- two different bodies of research with a similar finding.

488
0:21:01.33,000 --> 0:21:03,000
What it suggests is that children are shaped

489
0:21:03.33,000 --> 0:21:06,000
not by their parents over the long run,

490
0:21:06.33,000 --> 0:21:09,000
but in part -- only in part -- by their genes,

491
0:21:09.33,000 --> 0:21:11,000
in part by their culture --

492
0:21:11.33,000 --> 0:21:13,000
the culture of the country at large

493
0:21:13.33,000 --> 0:21:15,000
and the children's own culture, namely their peer group --

494
0:21:15.33,000 --> 0:21:18,000
as we heard from Jill Sobule earlier today,

495
0:21:18.33,000 --> 0:21:2,000
that's what kids care about --

496
0:21:21.33,000 --> 0:21:24,000
and, to a very large extent, larger than most people are prepared to acknowledge,

497
0:21:24.33,000 --> 0:21:27,000
by chance: chance events in the wiring of the brain in utero;

498
0:21:27.33,000 --> 0:21:29,000
chance events as you live your life.

499
0:21:31.33,000 --> 0:21:33,000
So let me conclude

500
0:21:33.33,000 --> 0:21:35,000
with just a remark

501
0:21:35.33,000 --> 0:21:38,000
to bring it back to the theme of choices.

502
0:21:38.33,000 --> 0:21:4,000
I think that the sciences of human nature --

503
0:21:40.33,000 --> 0:21:43,000
behavioral genetics, evolutionary psychology,

504
0:21:43.33,000 --> 0:21:45,000
neuroscience, cognitive science --

505
0:21:45.33,000 --> 0:21:48,000
are going to, increasingly in the years to come,

506
0:21:48.33,000 --> 0:21:51,000
upset various dogmas,

507
0:21:51.33,000 --> 0:21:54,000
careers and deeply-held political belief systems.

508
0:21:54.33,000 --> 0:21:56,000
And that presents us with a choice.

509
0:21:56.33,000 --> 0:21:59,000
The choice is whether certain facts about humans,

510
0:21:59.33,000 --> 0:22:02,000
or topics, are to be considered taboos,

511
0:22:03.33,000 --> 0:22:05,000
forbidden knowledge, where we shouldn't go there

512
0:22:05.33,000 --> 0:22:07,000
because no good can come from it,

513
0:22:07.33,000 --> 0:22:1,000
or whether we should explore them honestly.

514
0:22:10.33,000 --> 0:22:12,000
I have my own

515
0:22:12.33,000 --> 0:22:14,000
answer to that question,

516
0:22:14.33,000 --> 0:22:17,000
which comes from a great artist of the 19th century,

517
0:22:17.33,000 --> 0:22:2,000
Anton Chekhov, who said,

518
0:22:20.33,000 --> 0:22:22,000
"Man will become better when you show him

519
0:22:22.33,000 --> 0:22:24,000
what he is like."

520
0:22:24.33,000 --> 0:22:26,000
And I think that the argument

521
0:22:26.33,000 --> 0:22:29,000
can't be put any more eloquently than that.

522
0:22:29.33,000 --> 0:22:31,000
Thank you very much.

523
0:22:32.33,000 --> 0:22:37,000
(Applause)

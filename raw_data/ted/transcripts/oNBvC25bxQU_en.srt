Transcriber: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Krystian Aparta

2
0:00:12.649,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Chris Anderson: Well, hello, Helen. Very nice to see you.

3
0:00:15.47,000 --> 0:00:17,000
CA: You staying well? Helen Walters: How's it going?

4
0:00:18.35,000 --> 0:00:21,000
CA: These are mad, mad, mad, mad, mad days.

5
0:00:22.364,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So many emotions.

6
0:00:23.801,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Not all bad, happily,

7
0:00:26.197,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but I'm just so aware that, among the people listening to this,

8
0:00:29.65,000 --> 0:00:31,000
some are in really tough times right now.

9
0:00:32.135,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I hope this is going to be a beautiful hour of therapy and help

10
0:00:36.788,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in its own way,

11
0:00:39.674,000 --> 0:00:43,000
because we have with us just an extraordinary author,

12
0:00:44.224,000 --> 0:00:47,000
an extraordinary mind,

13
0:00:47.422,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Elizabeth Gilbert,

14
0:00:49.49,000 --> 0:00:52,000
obviously known for her astonishing best-selling success

15
0:00:53.301,000 --> 0:00:55,000
with "Eat, Pray, Love,"

16
0:00:55.611,000 --> 0:00:59,000
although her favorite book from my point of view

17
0:00:59.804,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is called "Big Magic,"

18
0:01:01.93,000 --> 0:01:04,000
where the subtitle is, "Creative Living Beyond Fear."

19
0:01:06.122,000 --> 0:01:07,000
"Creative Living Beyond Fear."

20
0:01:07.612,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now when you think about it,

21
0:01:08.98,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that is a pretty good agenda for today's conversation, I think.

22
0:01:15.575,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Liz describes the emotional landscape of our lives,

23
0:01:21.035,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I think like no one else I've read, and I'm not even her target audience.

24
0:01:25.909,000 --> 0:01:27,000
She's really extraordinary in doing that.

25
0:01:28.362,000 --> 0:01:31,000
She gave an amazing TED Talk 11 years ago now,

26
0:01:32.211,000 --> 0:01:33,000
"In pursuit of your creative genius."

27
0:01:34.06,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It really reframed how to think of creativity.

28
0:01:37.69,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's been seen, like, 19 million times or something,

29
0:01:40.144,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and it's really changed how a lot of people --

30
0:01:42.317,000 --> 0:01:46,000
they're just open to the creative genius coming from the outside.

31
0:01:46.497,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So it's a delight to welcome to the TED Connects stage

32
0:01:50.379,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Elizabeth Gilbert.

33
0:01:55.399,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Elizabeth Gilbert: Hey, Chris.

34
0:01:56.932,000 --> 0:01:58,000
CA: Great to see you.

35
0:01:59.427,000 --> 0:02:03,000
How are you? Where are you? Who are you living with or staying with?

36
0:02:03.508,000 --> 0:02:04,000
What's up?

37
0:02:04.72,000 --> 0:02:05,000
EG: I'm fine.

38
0:02:06.31,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I don't want to brag, but I'm in New Jersey,

39
0:02:10.007,000 --> 0:02:12,000
where anybody would want to be.

40
0:02:12.068,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I'm by myself.

41
0:02:13.56,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I've got a little house out in the country,

42
0:02:15.728,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and I think I'm on day 17 of no human contact

43
0:02:21.68,000 --> 0:02:23,000
other than virtually,

44
0:02:23.769,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and I'm well.

45
0:02:24.944,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I'm not anybody you need to be worrying about right now.

46
0:02:27.595,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So I'm good.

47
0:02:29.626,000 --> 0:02:3,000
CA: Wow.

48
0:02:30.801,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Well, so in a way, you're having a related experience

49
0:02:34.539,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to what so many people are having.

50
0:02:36.184,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I mean, these are days of isolation for many people,

51
0:02:38.769,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and that brings with it lots of difficult emotions, in a way.

52
0:02:44.349,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And we're going to go through many of them, I hope, in the next hour.

53
0:02:47.643,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So I'm hoping to talk with you about -- I wrote down a list here:

54
0:02:50.729,000 --> 0:02:53,000
about anxiety, loneliness, curiosity,

55
0:02:54.5,000 --> 0:02:57,000
creativity, procrastination, grief,

56
0:02:58.263,000 --> 0:02:59,000
connection and hope.

57
0:03:00.281,000 --> 0:03:02,000
How about that? That's our agenda. Are you up for that?

58
0:03:02.996,000 --> 0:03:03,000
EG: I think that's the whole buffet.

59
0:03:04.743,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughs)

60
0:03:06.028,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Just a little light tasting menu of all the mass of human emotions.

61
0:03:09.299,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Let's do it. Absolutely.

62
0:03:11.653,000 --> 0:03:14,000
CA: I think it's probably good to dive straight in

63
0:03:15.179,000 --> 0:03:18,000
with the anxiety that I know a lot of people are feeling right now.

64
0:03:18.909,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So many reasons to be anxious,

65
0:03:20.378,000 --> 0:03:22,000
both for yourself, your loved ones,

66
0:03:23.27,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and just for this time and for the world

67
0:03:25.437,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and how we all get through this.

68
0:03:28.715,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Have you been feeling anxiety, Liz?

69
0:03:31.295,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And how do you think of it? What can you say to us?

70
0:03:36.54,000 --> 0:03:37,000
EG: I have been,

71
0:03:37.834,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and I think you would have to be either a sociopath or totally enlightened

72
0:03:43.25,000 --> 0:03:45,000
not to be feeling anxiety at a moment like this.

73
0:03:45.882,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So I would say that the first thing that I would want

74
0:03:48.948,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to encourage everybody to do

75
0:03:50.438,000 --> 0:03:54,000
is to give themselves a measure of mercy and compassion

76
0:03:54.573,000 --> 0:03:56,000
for the difficult emotions that you're feeling right now.

77
0:03:57.28,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They're extremely understandable.

78
0:03:58.877,000 --> 0:04:,000
I think sometimes our emotions about our emotions

79
0:04:01.629,000 --> 0:04:02,000
become a bigger problem,

80
0:04:03.082,000 --> 0:04:05,000
so if you're feeling frightened and anxious,

81
0:04:05.717,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and then you're layering shame on top of that

82
0:04:09.034,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because you feel like you should be handling it better,

83
0:04:11.692,000 --> 0:04:13,000
or you should be doing your isolation better,

84
0:04:13.83,000 --> 0:04:15,000
or you should be creating more while you're alone,

85
0:04:16.241,000 --> 0:04:18,000
or you should be serving the world in some better way,

86
0:04:18.852,000 --> 0:04:2,000
now you've just multiplied the suffering, right?

87
0:04:21.17,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So I think that the antidote for that, first of all,

88
0:04:23.635,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is just a really warm, loving dose of compassion

89
0:04:27.758,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and mercy towards yourself,

90
0:04:29.425,000 --> 0:04:3,000
because if you're in anxiety,

91
0:04:31.446,000 --> 0:04:33,000
you're a person who is suffering right now,

92
0:04:33.548,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and that deserves a show of mercy.

93
0:04:36.612,000 --> 0:04:38,000
The second thing that I would say about anxiety is this,

94
0:04:39.287,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that here's what I think is the central paradox

95
0:04:42.942,000 --> 0:04:43,000
of the human emotional landscape

96
0:04:44.575,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that I'm finding particularly fascinating right this moment,

97
0:04:47.441,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and it's really come to light for me.

98
0:04:49.514,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So there are these two aspects of humanity that don't match --

99
0:04:54.197,000 --> 0:04:55,000
hence the word paradox --

100
0:04:55.464,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but they really define us.

101
0:04:57.532,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And the first is that there is no species on earth more anxious than humans.

102
0:05:02.833,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's a hallmark of our species,

103
0:05:04.786,000 --> 0:05:08,000
because we have the ability slash curse to imagine a future.

104
0:05:10.1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And also, once you've lived on earth for a little while,

105
0:05:12.77,000 --> 0:05:15,000
you have the experience to recognize this terrifying piece of information,

106
0:05:16.707,000 --> 0:05:2,000
which is that literally anything can happen at literally any moment

107
0:05:21.412,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to literally any person.

108
0:05:23.016,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And because we have these vast, rich, colorful imaginations,

109
0:05:26.912,000 --> 0:05:28,000
we can see all sorts of terrifying movies in our heads

110
0:05:29.808,000 --> 0:05:3,000
about all of the possibilities

111
0:05:31.309,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and all of the scariest things that could occur.

112
0:05:33.585,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And actually, one of the scariest things that could occur is occurring.

113
0:05:36.943,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It's something that people have imagined in fiction and imagined in science,

114
0:05:40.551,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and it's actually happening right now, so that's quite terrifying.

115
0:05:43.78,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The paradox is that, in that level,

116
0:05:46.749,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we're very bad, emotionally, at fear and anxiety,

117
0:05:50.05,000 --> 0:05:54,000
because we stir ourselves up to a very heated degree

118
0:05:54.374,000 --> 0:05:56,000
because of our imaginations about how horrible it can get,

119
0:05:57.155,000 --> 0:06:,000
and it get can get very horrible, but we can imagine it even worse.

120
0:06:00.352,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The paradox is that we're also the most capable, resourceful

121
0:06:04.456,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and resilient species that has ever lived on earth.

122
0:06:07.113,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So history has shown that when change comes to humanity --

123
0:06:11.668,000 --> 0:06:13,000
either on the global level, like it's happening now,

124
0:06:14.305,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or on the personal level --

125
0:06:15.789,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we're really good at it.

126
0:06:17.772,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We're really good at adaptation.

127
0:06:20.575,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And I think that if we can remember that, it can help to actually mitigate the fear.

128
0:06:25.937,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And you can remember it in a historical perspective,

129
0:06:28.978,000 --> 0:06:3,000
by looking at what humanity has gone through,

130
0:06:31.492,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and what we have not only survived but figured out how to thrive through.

131
0:06:35.004,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And you can also look at it at a personal level,

132
0:06:37.267,000 --> 0:06:4,000
where you can make an inventory of what you yourself have survived,

133
0:06:40.455,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and notice, as I often notice,

134
0:06:43.037,000 --> 0:06:45,000
my panic and my anxiety about the imagined future

135
0:06:45.678,000 --> 0:06:48,000
is deadly on my nervous system,

136
0:06:48.965,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but I actually have discovered that when there's an actual emergency in the moment,

137
0:06:52.965,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I tend to be pretty good at it.

138
0:06:54.496,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And I think most of us are like that.

139
0:06:57.29,000 --> 0:06:59,000
You'll see that repeated in history in so many examples.

140
0:07:00.092,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I think about those heartbreaking and devastating phone messages

141
0:07:05.068,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that people were leaving for their loved ones

142
0:07:07.275,000 --> 0:07:09,000
from the towers on September 11th,

143
0:07:09.362,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and you can hear the calm, the calm in peoples' voices.

144
0:07:13.545,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The biggest emergency ever was happening,

145
0:07:15.689,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and in that moment, intuition told them what to do.

146
0:07:18.095,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The important thing to do now is to make this phone call.

147
0:07:20.787,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And I think if you can trust

148
0:07:22.906,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that when the point of emergency actually arrives,

149
0:07:25.512,000 --> 0:07:26,000
you'll be able to meet it,

150
0:07:26.931,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and then when the world changes, you'll be able to adapt to it --

151
0:07:30.01,000 --> 0:07:31,000
it certainly helps me calm down.

152
0:07:32.801,000 --> 0:07:34,000
CA: I mean, I guess there's a reason why fear is there.

153
0:07:35.632,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It didn't just evolve by accident.

154
0:07:37.277,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's supposed to direct our behavior and help us avoid danger,

155
0:07:42.079,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and it's just that sometimes, it gets out of control

156
0:07:45.278,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and actually gets in our way and damages us.

157
0:07:49.723,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I mean, any specific advice

158
0:07:52.255,000 --> 0:07:57,000
on how someone could turn their fear into something useful, at this moment?

159
0:07:58.667,000 --> 0:08:01,000
EG: Can I tell you a story that I'm using as a touchstone for myself right now

160
0:08:02.676,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and drawing wonder and inspiration from?

161
0:08:07.264,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So, some of you may have heard of a young woman named Amanda Eller.

162
0:08:11.288,000 --> 0:08:15,000
She was in the news recently, because she got lost in Hawaii

163
0:08:15.382,000 --> 0:08:17,000
in the wilderness for 17 days,

164
0:08:17.753,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and there was a massive, massive hunt for her,

165
0:08:21.027,000 --> 0:08:24,000
because she had left her car, she'd gone for a simple hike,

166
0:08:24.155,000 --> 0:08:26,000
had left her phone in her car, went up into the woods,

167
0:08:26.704,000 --> 0:08:27,000
took a wrong turn,

168
0:08:27.901,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and then had this disastrous 17 days,

169
0:08:30.789,000 --> 0:08:31,000
fell off a cliff, broke her leg,

170
0:08:32.8,000 --> 0:08:36,000
walked for 40 miles on a broken knee, lost her shoes in a flash flood.

171
0:08:37.672,000 --> 0:08:39,000
She had to sleep packed in mud

172
0:08:40.609,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in order to protect herself from the cold and the mosquitoes.

173
0:08:43.529,000 --> 0:08:44,000
She was eating moths.

174
0:08:44.706,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I mean, just a harrowing story of survival.

175
0:08:47.144,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I met her recently,

176
0:08:49.493,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and she was so lit and radiant

177
0:08:53.858,000 --> 0:08:57,000
with this kind of serenity and this kind of wonder and joy,

178
0:08:58.111,000 --> 0:09:,000
and I said, "How are you like this?

179
0:09:00.636,000 --> 0:09:02,000
You went through one of the most traumatizing things

180
0:09:03.143,000 --> 0:09:04,000
that a person could go through."

181
0:09:04.778,000 --> 0:09:07,000
She said, "First of all, I discovered that I can survive anything,"

182
0:09:07.968,000 --> 0:09:09,000
going back to this idea of how resourceful and adaptive

183
0:09:10.666,000 --> 0:09:11,000
humans actually are.

184
0:09:11.848,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But the piece of her story that I am using like a life raft right now

185
0:09:16.475,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is that she said, on her second day in the jungle,

186
0:09:19.031,000 --> 0:09:23,000
when she realized that she was truly and very much in trouble --

187
0:09:23.849,000 --> 0:09:26,000
she'd already spent one night in the woods and she was completely lost

188
0:09:27.206,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and she was totally alone and no one knew where she was,

189
0:09:29.851,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and she was full of terror --

190
0:09:31.338,000 --> 0:09:35,000
she said she closed her eyes and she prayed or asked or requested,

191
0:09:35.977,000 --> 0:09:38,000
she made a wish to herself, to consciousness, to the universe,

192
0:09:39.295,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and she said, "Please take my fear away,

193
0:09:41.954,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and when I open my eyes, have it be gone,

194
0:09:44.237,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and have it be gone and have it not come back."

195
0:09:47.739,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And she opened her eyes, and it was gone,

196
0:09:50.683,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and it was replaced by intuition.

197
0:09:52.929,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And I think intuition is a little bit the opposite of fear,

198
0:09:55.747,000 --> 0:09:59,000
because fear is the terror that you feel about a frightening imagined future.

199
0:10:00.197,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Intuition can only happen when you're in the moment.

200
0:10:03.158,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And so, from that point forward, she did not experience fear

201
0:10:05.993,000 --> 0:10:07,000
for the rest of the time she was in the woods.

202
0:10:08.181,000 --> 0:10:1,000
She just was guided by some deep intuitive sense,

203
0:10:10.571,000 --> 0:10:13,000
located somewhere between her sternum and her navel,

204
0:10:13.928,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and in every moment, she would ask it, "Right or left?"

205
0:10:17.525,000 --> 0:10:19,000
"Up or down?" "Eat this? Don't eat this?"

206
0:10:20.381,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And just trust it.

207
0:10:22.294,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Complete, absolute surrender to the intuition of the moment.

208
0:10:25.58,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And she said it hasn't returned, the fear hasn't returned,

209
0:10:29.009,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and she still guides her life that way.

210
0:10:30.923,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So it's a return to some sense

211
0:10:33.049,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that there's a navigational system within you

212
0:10:35.244,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that will, if you stay present in this actual moment,

213
0:10:38.416,000 --> 0:10:4,000
tell you what to do one moment to the next.

214
0:10:40.677,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Now, if you want to suffer,

215
0:10:42.265,000 --> 0:10:44,000
pop out of the moment and imagine a future,

216
0:10:44.424,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and then you can suffer indefinitely.

217
0:10:46.424,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So it is almost like a spiritual or meditation practice,

218
0:10:50.091,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and anybody out there who's done any spiritual or meditation practices,

219
0:10:54.409,000 --> 0:10:56,000
this is what you were practicing for.

220
0:10:57.004,000 --> 0:10:58,000
You were practicing for this moment,

221
0:10:58.766,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and those of you who haven't tried that,

222
0:11:00.696,000 --> 0:11:04,000
this might be a really [inaudible] to be centered in the instant.

223
0:11:06.436,000 --> 0:11:09,000
CA: Wow, that's a remarkable story,

224
0:11:09.8,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and I guess what I'm hearing is two things.

225
0:11:12.046,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It's one, just the reaching out to the universe there,

226
0:11:16.629,000 --> 0:11:2,000
but specifically, there was a decision to let go of the future

227
0:11:21.292,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and just to focus on the moment.

228
0:11:24.177,000 --> 0:11:25,000
EG: That's it, yeah.

229
0:11:26.037,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Nothing will bring you more pain than the future,

230
0:11:28.402,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and what I'm seeing happening right now --

231
0:11:30.426,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I said this to you the other day, Chris --

232
0:11:32.461,000 --> 0:11:34,000
is there's a relatively small percentage of the population

233
0:11:35.23,000 --> 0:11:37,000
who will suffer physically from this disease,

234
0:11:37.351,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and there's a larger percentage

235
0:11:39.064,000 --> 0:11:41,000
who are going to suffer economically from it.

236
0:11:41.813,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But then there's this massive, uncountable number of people

237
0:11:44.695,000 --> 0:11:46,000
who will and are suffering from it emotionally,

238
0:11:47.338,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and right now, those people are my concern,

239
0:11:49.663,000 --> 0:11:51,000
because they're really in pain,

240
0:11:52.488,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and there's millions and millions of them.

241
0:11:55.243,000 --> 0:11:57,000
CA: So you're living there by yourself, Liz,

242
0:11:57.838,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and many others are in that same circumstance right now.

243
0:12:02.964,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I suspect some are feeling, like, crushing loneliness.

244
0:12:08.249,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Talk about that.

245
0:12:09.6,000 --> 0:12:13,000
How do you handle loneliness in a situation like this,

246
0:12:13.755,000 --> 0:12:14,000
when it's so alien to everything

247
0:12:15.724,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that we as a social species are usually about?

248
0:12:18.335,000 --> 0:12:2,000
We crave other people. We crave touch.

249
0:12:20.899,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We crave hugs.

250
0:12:22.128,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We want to be there with people.

251
0:12:24.46,000 --> 0:12:27,000
How can we avoid this being a period of crushing loneliness?

252
0:12:28.94,000 --> 0:12:29,000
EG: I don't think you can avoid it,

253
0:12:30.952,000 --> 0:12:32,000
but I think you can walk toward it.

254
0:12:33.221,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And I think that, for me,

255
0:12:36.563,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I've deliberately, many times in my life,

256
0:12:39.951,000 --> 0:12:43,000
gone off into isolation in order to face those things.

257
0:12:44.195,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I've gone on long meditation retreats.

258
0:12:46.943,000 --> 0:12:47,000
This year, I was in India,

259
0:12:48.364,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and I spent 17 days alone with no contact with anybody,

260
0:12:51.412,000 --> 0:12:54,000
which was a weird practice run for what's happening right now.

261
0:12:55.067,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And as I see people really losing it

262
0:12:58.649,000 --> 0:13:,000
and feeling like they're crawling out of their skin,

263
0:13:01.155,000 --> 0:13:03,000
either from anxiety, fear, boredom,

264
0:13:03.782,000 --> 0:13:06,000
anger, blame, loneliness, depression,

265
0:13:07.44,000 --> 0:13:08,000
all of these things that come up

266
0:13:09.015,000 --> 0:13:11,000
when you are forced to just be in your own presence.

267
0:13:12.328,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I know all of those feelings because, as a meditator,

268
0:13:15.113,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I've experienced all of those, in stillness.

269
0:13:18.864,000 --> 0:13:21,000
The hardest person in the entire world to be with is yourself,

270
0:13:22.315,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and so the only way that I learned, as a meditator,

271
0:13:26.06,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to be able to survive and endure my own company

272
0:13:29.122,000 --> 0:13:33,000
was with universal human compassion toward me,

273
0:13:33.272,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and to recognize that this is a person

274
0:13:35.21,000 --> 0:13:37,000
who is suffering right now from loneliness,

275
0:13:37.234,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and this person needs kindness from self towards self.

276
0:13:40.229,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And it's a very high teaching,

277
0:13:41.714,000 --> 0:13:45,000
but I think that it's a very interesting moment to practice that.

278
0:13:46.411,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And so what I would suggest to people --

279
0:13:49.214,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and again, this takes a certain amount of resolve

280
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and it takes a certain amount of curiosity

281
0:13:54.048,000 --> 0:13:56,000
about learning more about the human experience --

282
0:13:56.544,000 --> 0:14:,000
what I'm seeing people do is people are spinning away from that isolation

283
0:14:00.604,000 --> 0:14:01,000
because they're so terrified of it.

284
0:14:02.596,000 --> 0:14:03,000
What happened with the world right now

285
0:14:04.47,000 --> 0:14:07,000
is that basically all of our pacifiers were yanked out of our mouths.

286
0:14:07.827,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Everything that we ever can do and reach for

287
0:14:10.465,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that can get us out of having to be in the existential crisis

288
0:14:13.355,000 --> 0:14:14,000
of being alone with ourselves

289
0:14:14.855,000 --> 0:14:15,000
was taken away.

290
0:14:16.042,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And I see people rushing to fill it,

291
0:14:17.831,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I mean, constant Zoom meetings

292
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and constant parties online and constant interaction,

293
0:14:23.338,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and all of that is lovely,

294
0:14:24.646,000 --> 0:14:27,000
but from a spiritual and psychological standpoint,

295
0:14:27.792,000 --> 0:14:29,000
from a creative standpoint,

296
0:14:30.246,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I would say if you have any curiosity about this,

297
0:14:32.924,000 --> 0:14:37,000
don't be in such a hurry to rush away from an experience

298
0:14:38.429,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that could actually transform your life.

299
0:14:41.566,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I think sometimes the experiences that can transform us the most intimately

300
0:14:45.687,000 --> 0:14:47,000
are the ones that we want to run away from,

301
0:14:48.661,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and I think of a story that the Dalai Lama told about one of his teachers.

302
0:14:54.208,000 --> 0:14:56,000
When the Chinese invaded Tibet,

303
0:14:56.264,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and all the monks were running into India for safety,

304
0:14:59.13,000 --> 0:15:01,000
one of his teachers, who was one of the great masters,

305
0:15:01.718,000 --> 0:15:03,000
the last glimpse that the Dalai Lama had of him

306
0:15:03.934,000 --> 0:15:04,000
was that he was walking into China --

307
0:15:05.853,000 --> 0:15:08,000
very patiently and very slowly, toward it.

308
0:15:08.988,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Everybody else was running away from it --

309
0:15:11.049,000 --> 0:15:12,000
he was walking toward it,

310
0:15:12.339,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and I think there's a level at which first responders do that,

311
0:15:15.39,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and in the real world, in an intimate way,

312
0:15:17.681,000 --> 0:15:19,000
they go into the emergency, they go toward the emergency.

313
0:15:20.445,000 --> 0:15:23,000
All the people who are trying to solve this now in worldly ways

314
0:15:23.486,000 --> 0:15:24,000
are walking toward the emergency.

315
0:15:25.09,000 --> 0:15:27,000
But there's a way that you can do it emotionally as well

316
0:15:27.8,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and that is to walk with curiosity and with an open mind

317
0:15:30.561,000 --> 0:15:34,000
toward your most difficult and painful emotions without resistance,

318
0:15:34.585,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and say, "What is it like

319
0:15:36.839,000 --> 0:15:39,000
for a person to feel like they don't have something to do for an hour?"

320
0:15:40.664,000 --> 0:15:41,000
(Laughs)

321
0:15:42.037,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And you can open up your compassion in that.

322
0:15:45.748,000 --> 0:15:48,000
There's so many lessons in compassion that can be found here.

323
0:15:48.968,000 --> 0:15:51,000
How about a general universal mercy that we can all feel

324
0:15:52.069,000 --> 0:15:54,000
toward people who are in solitary confinement.

325
0:15:54.348,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Let's have that be part of the conversation.

326
0:15:56.421,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Now you've experienced it for two days in your own house.

327
0:15:59.804,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Maybe it's time to change the prison system?

328
0:16:01.893,000 --> 0:16:02,000
You see how hard this is.

329
0:16:03.328,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Or you can have compassion toward people who have lost a loved one

330
0:16:06.487,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and they're alone.

331
0:16:07.662,000 --> 0:16:08,000
By feeling your own feelings,

332
0:16:09.114,000 --> 0:16:12,000
you can open up your feelings more universally toward the world.

333
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
So I think there's a great opportunity here for growth on the personal level,

334
0:16:16.764,000 --> 0:16:2,000
but you have to have almost a whimsical curiosity

335
0:16:20.797,000 --> 0:16:23,000
to be the one walking into China rather than the one away from it.

336
0:16:23.941,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And that's how I'm doing it right now.

337
0:16:27.431,000 --> 0:16:29,000
CA: So let's follow up on that word "curiosity"

338
0:16:29.774,000 --> 0:16:31,000
that you've used a few times there.

339
0:16:31.822,000 --> 0:16:34,000
I mean, a lot of wisdom that I've heard sort of thrown around online right now

340
0:16:35.514,000 --> 0:16:37,000
is, "This is a great time to follow your passion

341
0:16:37.949,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and dive deep into whatever it is you've most been wanting to do."

342
0:16:42.076,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I mean, in "Big Magic,"

343
0:16:44.108,000 --> 0:16:46,000
you made an argument that following your passion

344
0:16:46.664,000 --> 0:16:48,000
isn't necessarily the wisest strategy.

345
0:16:48.688,000 --> 0:16:51,000
You argued, no, don't do that, follow curiosity.

346
0:16:52.344,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Does that apply now? Make that case.

347
0:16:55.592,000 --> 0:16:57,000
EG: Yeah, you know, I've been on a personal crusade

348
0:16:58.023,000 --> 0:17:01,000
to rid the world of the world "passion"

349
0:17:01.453,000 --> 0:17:03,000
as an instruction for people on how as they should be living,

350
0:17:04.435,000 --> 0:17:07,000
because I know that in my case, it brings me nothing but anxiety.

351
0:17:08.204,000 --> 0:17:11,000
"Purpose" is another one that has become a cudgel

352
0:17:11.799,000 --> 0:17:14,000
that we use to bludgeon ourselves into thinking that we're not doing enough

353
0:17:15.506,000 --> 0:17:18,000
or that we're doing life right or that you're supposed to be more useful,

354
0:17:19.019,000 --> 0:17:2,000
more productive,

355
0:17:20.201,000 --> 0:17:22,000
you're supposed to be changing the world,

356
0:17:22.296,000 --> 0:17:24,000
or uncovering some particular talent that only you have

357
0:17:24.986,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and with it, you're supposed to transform everybody

358
0:17:27.493,000 --> 0:17:28,000
and monetize it, no pressure.

359
0:17:28.97,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I start to get hives even repeating that,

360
0:17:31.017,000 --> 0:17:34,000
but that's what we've been taught,

361
0:17:34.946,000 --> 0:17:36,000
that purpose and passion are everything.

362
0:17:37.267,000 --> 0:17:39,000
I would like to replace it with a far gentler word,

363
0:17:39.748,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and I think "curiosity" is very gentle, because the stakes are so much lower.

364
0:17:43.561,000 --> 0:17:46,000
The stakes of passion say you have to shave your head and move to India

365
0:17:47.481,000 --> 0:17:51,000
and get rid of all your possessions and start up, like --

366
0:17:52.29,000 --> 0:17:54,000
It's so intense.

367
0:17:54.727,000 --> 0:17:58,000
But curiosity is a very simple, universal experience

368
0:17:58.782,000 --> 0:18:01,000
that causes you to want to look at something just a tiny bit closer,

369
0:18:02.694,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and you don't have to change your life around it.

370
0:18:05.663,000 --> 0:18:06,000
You just look,

371
0:18:07.036,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and it might be taking a weekend to try something new for a little while.

372
0:18:11.091,000 --> 0:18:15,000
It's almost so easily missed,

373
0:18:15.378,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and I think so many times, we're looking way up at the sky

374
0:18:18.123,000 --> 0:18:21,000
for the sign from God of what our passion and what our purpose is supposed to be,

375
0:18:21.958,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and meanwhile, there's this lovely little trail of breadcrumbs of curiosity

376
0:18:26.537,000 --> 0:18:27,000
that if you can slow down --

377
0:18:28.395,000 --> 0:18:3,000
and again, this is about not rushing out of the experience

378
0:18:31.189,000 --> 0:18:33,000
of being silent, still and alone --

379
0:18:33.308,000 --> 0:18:35,000
if you can slow down, you might be able to see them.

380
0:18:35.824,000 --> 0:18:38,000
But if I could say one thing I'm noticing is an obstacle right now --

381
0:18:39.267,000 --> 0:18:4,000
because I think a lot of people thought,

382
0:18:41.267,000 --> 0:18:42,000
"Isolation, great,

383
0:18:42.538,000 --> 0:18:44,000
this is the perfect time for me to learn Italian

384
0:18:44.827,000 --> 0:18:46,000
and take that calligraphy class and start writing that novel,"

385
0:18:47.771,000 --> 0:18:5,000
and they find that they're actually in a paralysis of anxiety

386
0:18:51.372,000 --> 0:18:54,000
and they're not creating anything or doing anything.

387
0:18:54.625,000 --> 0:18:56,000
First of all, again, like, a blanket of mercy on you.

388
0:18:57.284,000 --> 0:18:58,000
These are hard times,

389
0:18:58.673,000 --> 0:19:01,000
and it might take you a minute in your nervous system and your mind

390
0:19:01.842,000 --> 0:19:02,000
to adjust to the new reality.

391
0:19:03.703,000 --> 0:19:06,000
But the second thing I would say is that when people are saying

392
0:19:06.756,000 --> 0:19:08,000
they're having trouble with their creativity

393
0:19:08.862,000 --> 0:19:09,000
because they're in isolation,

394
0:19:10.836,000 --> 0:19:13,000
I might daringly suggest that perhaps you're not in enough isolation.

395
0:19:14.399,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And by that I mean, are you monitoring how much external stimulus

396
0:19:18.332,000 --> 0:19:2,000
you're bringing of this disaster into your home?

397
0:19:21.221,000 --> 0:19:24,000
So if you're sitting watching the news all day,

398
0:19:24.455,000 --> 0:19:27,000
what you're doing is you're bringing the disaster into your work space.

399
0:19:27.858,000 --> 0:19:3,000
You're bringing it into your soul. You're bringing it into your mind.

400
0:19:31.122,000 --> 0:19:36,000
And you're going to create the opposite of a creative environment,

401
0:19:36.159,000 --> 0:19:39,000
an environment of fear, panic and urgency.

402
0:19:39.206,000 --> 0:19:41,000
So I think if you're going to be a good steward

403
0:19:41.485,000 --> 0:19:42,000
of your creativity right now,

404
0:19:42.987,000 --> 0:19:44,000
you have to isolate a little bit from the news.

405
0:19:45.244,000 --> 0:19:46,000
And that doesn't mean disconnecting,

406
0:19:47.119,000 --> 0:19:49,000
it means I get up every morning and after I've meditated,

407
0:19:49.977,000 --> 0:19:51,000
I read the New York Times and I give myself 40 minutes with it,

408
0:19:52.955,000 --> 0:19:53,000
and then that's it for the day,

409
0:19:54.689,000 --> 0:19:56,000
because I know that if I bring in any more,

410
0:19:56.792,000 --> 0:19:58,000
I'm going to go into a traumatized state

411
0:19:59.211,000 --> 0:20:01,000
and then I won't be able to follow my intuition,

412
0:20:01.492,000 --> 0:20:04,000
I won't be able to help people, because I myself will be suffering,

413
0:20:05.047,000 --> 0:20:09,000
and I won't be able to be present for this very interesting moment

414
0:20:09.603,000 --> 0:20:1,000
in my life and in history,

415
0:20:11.135,000 --> 0:20:13,000
and I want to remain present for it as much as I can.

416
0:20:14.029,000 --> 0:20:17,000
So there's a discipline of being a good steward of your senses

417
0:20:17.665,000 --> 0:20:2,000
and deciding what you're going to put your senses in front of.

418
0:20:21.726,000 --> 0:20:22,000
CA: Helen.

419
0:20:24.519,000 --> 0:20:27,000
HW: Liz, there's an outpouring on Facebook of gratitude for you.

420
0:20:28.211,000 --> 0:20:29,000
People are so grateful,

421
0:20:29.846,000 --> 0:20:33,000
and grateful for the calm that you are instilling in us all,

422
0:20:33.883,000 --> 0:20:35,000
so thank you, from them and from me.

423
0:20:36.51,000 --> 0:20:38,000
We've also had a number of questions about grief.

424
0:20:39.399,000 --> 0:20:42,000
We're kind of dealing with grief at a different scale at the moment.

425
0:20:42.677,000 --> 0:20:46,000
One person has already lost five people to coronavirus.

426
0:20:48.027,000 --> 0:20:51,000
And so any thoughts of how to manage grief at this scale

427
0:20:51.798,000 --> 0:20:56,000
or how to process this in a way that honors both them and yourself?

428
0:21:00.133,000 --> 0:21:03,000
EG: First of all, my condolences.

429
0:21:03.291,000 --> 0:21:05,000
And I think any words that I would say

430
0:21:05.503,000 --> 0:21:07,000
about somebody who just lost five family members

431
0:21:07.898,000 --> 0:21:09,000
could only be inadequate.

432
0:21:12.796,000 --> 0:21:16,000
Grief is bigger than us.

433
0:21:17.081,000 --> 0:21:19,000
It's bigger than your efforts to manage it,

434
0:21:20.095,000 --> 0:21:23,000
and if you want to hold yourself and your family members

435
0:21:24.056,000 --> 0:21:26,000
compassionately through grief,

436
0:21:26.246,000 --> 0:21:29,000
you have to allow that it cannot be managed.

437
0:21:29.43,000 --> 0:21:32,000
And I think that grief management is something that we've kind of created

438
0:21:33.409,000 --> 0:21:38,000
in our very Western idea that if we can figure out something,

439
0:21:38.863,000 --> 0:21:39,000
we can avoid suffering from it,

440
0:21:40.467,000 --> 0:21:42,000
so if we can figure out how to translate grief

441
0:21:42.864,000 --> 0:21:44,000
and if we can figure out how to walk through grief,

442
0:21:45.308,000 --> 0:21:48,000
then we won't have to experience the magnitude of it.

443
0:21:49.74,000 --> 0:21:51,000
Many of you know that I lost the love of my life two years ago

444
0:21:52.669,000 --> 0:21:53,000
from pancreatic and liver cancer,

445
0:21:54.474,000 --> 0:21:55,000
and I was with her when she died,

446
0:21:56.188,000 --> 0:21:58,000
and I've been walking through my own path of grief,

447
0:21:58.638,000 --> 0:22:,000
so I know what it feels like to lose the person in the world

448
0:22:01.572,000 --> 0:22:02,000
who is the most important to you,

449
0:22:03.24,000 --> 0:22:05,000
which is of course the biggest fear that we all have.

450
0:22:06.245,000 --> 0:22:07,000
I know that you can survive it,

451
0:22:08.105,000 --> 0:22:11,000
but I know that you survive it by allowing yourself to feel it.

452
0:22:11.43,000 --> 0:22:14,000
And again, to go back to the metaphor of the monk walking directly into China,

453
0:22:15.383,000 --> 0:22:17,000
into conflict rather than away from it,

454
0:22:18.198,000 --> 0:22:23,000
do you have the courage to let it break over you like waves?

455
0:22:24.92,000 --> 0:22:25,000
I wish I could remember her name.

456
0:22:26.931,000 --> 0:22:29,000
There's this extraordinary woman who wrote a book called "Here If I Need You,"

457
0:22:30.802,000 --> 0:22:34,000
and she's a chaplain for the police department in Maine,

458
0:22:34.977,000 --> 0:22:36,000
and she's in charge of knocking on people's doors

459
0:22:37.968,000 --> 0:22:4,000
and giving them the worst news they're ever going to hear in their life,

460
0:22:41.428,000 --> 0:22:43,000
when she goes with the police when something happens.

461
0:22:44,000 --> 0:22:46,000
And she told a story once that I found very moving

462
0:22:46.38,000 --> 0:22:47,000
and very helpful for me in my grief.

463
0:22:48.12,000 --> 0:22:49,000
She said what she'd witnessed

464
0:22:49.573,000 --> 0:22:51,000
through years and years of sitting with people

465
0:22:51.862,000 --> 0:22:53,000
through what is literally the worst moment of their life,

466
0:22:54.553,000 --> 0:22:56,000
the nightmare of that loss,

467
0:22:57.179,000 --> 0:23:,000
is that when she knocks on that door and tells that person,

468
0:23:00.229,000 --> 0:23:04,000
your daughter, your family member, your husband, your mother has been killed,

469
0:23:04.912,000 --> 0:23:08,000
there's this universal collapse where the person will just be --

470
0:23:09.627,000 --> 0:23:11,000
it is the tidal wave that comes and just takes you down

471
0:23:12.357,000 --> 0:23:15,000
and you lose all civilization,

472
0:23:15.896,000 --> 0:23:18,000
you lose all your attainments, all your wisdom.

473
0:23:18.967,000 --> 0:23:21,000
Nothing can stand up to that. You literally go to the floor.

474
0:23:22.442,000 --> 0:23:26,000
And you sob and you grieve, and she holds them through that.

475
0:23:26.468,000 --> 0:23:29,000
And then she said that what she's learned is the most astonishing thing,

476
0:23:29.888,000 --> 0:23:32,000
that that never lasts more than a half an hour, that first wave.

477
0:23:33.737,000 --> 0:23:34,000
It can't.

478
0:23:34.943,000 --> 0:23:36,000
You actually physiologically can't sustain that,

479
0:23:37.674,000 --> 0:23:41,000
and if you let it break over you and you just allow it,

480
0:23:41.714,000 --> 0:23:44,000
then within a half an hour, usually sooner --

481
0:23:45.365,000 --> 0:23:48,000
and she said this has happened every single time she's been with somebody

482
0:23:48.818,000 --> 0:23:49,000
with a loved one's death --

483
0:23:50.175,000 --> 0:23:54,000
the very next thing that happens is that that person calms down,

484
0:23:54.342,000 --> 0:23:55,000
they catch a breath,

485
0:23:55.517,000 --> 0:23:59,000
and the next question they ask is a very reasonable question.

486
0:24:00.369,000 --> 0:24:02,000
"Where is the body? What do we do next?

487
0:24:02.615,000 --> 0:24:04,000
When can we have the funeral? Who else was in the car?"

488
0:24:05.265,000 --> 0:24:1,000
And with that question, she says, they start to rebuild their new life

489
0:24:10.431,000 --> 0:24:12,000
already with this new piece of information

490
0:24:12.872,000 --> 0:24:16,000
that even an hour ago would have seemed unsurvivable.

491
0:24:17.373,000 --> 0:24:19,000
And she uses that as an example of, once again,

492
0:24:20.008,000 --> 0:24:23,000
the tremendous psychological resilience of a human being.

493
0:24:23.398,000 --> 0:24:25,000
And it doesn't mean that they will never grieve again.

494
0:24:25.947,000 --> 0:24:27,000
It doesn't mean that their grieving journey is over.

495
0:24:28.401,000 --> 0:24:31,000
It just means that, somewhere in their mind, that it's landed,

496
0:24:31.71,000 --> 0:24:34,000
and now, already, they're making a plan about,

497
0:24:35.011,000 --> 0:24:38,000
"OK, who do we need to notify, what's the next thing we need to do."

498
0:24:38.251,000 --> 0:24:41,000
And again, if you can remember this as you go through your panic,

499
0:24:41.45,000 --> 0:24:43,000
if you can remember that in the moment of emergency,

500
0:24:44.369,000 --> 0:24:46,000
there will be an intuitive, deep sense

501
0:24:47.316,000 --> 0:24:49,000
that will tell you there's going to be some next steps

502
0:24:49.884,000 --> 0:24:51,000
and it's time for us to take those next steps,

503
0:24:52.243,000 --> 0:24:53,000
and if you can also remember

504
0:24:53.616,000 --> 0:24:58,000
that resilience is our shared genetic and psychological inheritance --

505
0:24:58.927,000 --> 0:25:02,000
we are, each and every one of us, no matter how anxious you feel you are,

506
0:25:03.387,000 --> 0:25:06,000
no matter how ridden by fear you feel you are,

507
0:25:06.419,000 --> 0:25:09,000
every single one of us is the genetic survivor

508
0:25:09.66,000 --> 0:25:11,000
of hundreds of thousands of years of survivors.

509
0:25:12.649,000 --> 0:25:14,000
Each one of us came from a line of people

510
0:25:15.652,000 --> 0:25:19,000
who made the next correct intuitive move,

511
0:25:19.879,000 --> 0:25:22,000
survived incredibly difficult things, and were able to pass their genes on.

512
0:25:23.448,000 --> 0:25:25,000
So almost to the biological level,

513
0:25:25.476,000 --> 0:25:29,000
you can relax into a trust that when the moment comes

514
0:25:29.562,000 --> 0:25:31,000
where you will be faced with the biggest challenge,

515
0:25:32,000 --> 0:25:34,000
you will be able to draw on a deep reservoir

516
0:25:34.602,000 --> 0:25:36,000
of shared human consciousness

517
0:25:36.856,000 --> 0:25:39,000
that will say, "Now it's time to make the next move, and we can do this."

518
0:25:41.484,000 --> 0:25:42,000
HW: So beautiful. So many more questions.

519
0:25:43.485,000 --> 0:25:44,000
I will be back.

520
0:25:45.389,000 --> 0:25:46,000
EG: Thanks, Helen. CA: Thank you, Liz.

521
0:25:47.229,000 --> 0:25:49,000
I think the author's name was Kate Braestrup.

522
0:25:49.581,000 --> 0:25:5,000
EG: That's it.

523
0:25:50.986,000 --> 0:25:52,000
CA: I guess that's a book, if you need a book right now,

524
0:25:53.631,000 --> 0:25:54,000
"Here If You Need Me" by Kate Braestrup.

525
0:25:55.565,000 --> 0:25:56,000
EG: Very good, yeah.

526
0:25:57.198,000 --> 0:25:59,000
CA: Liz, you and I got to have a conversation

527
0:25:59.413,000 --> 0:26:01,000
a few months after Rayya passed away.

528
0:26:02.215,000 --> 0:26:06,000
It was actually the first-ever episode of the TED Interview podcast we did.

529
0:26:06.738,000 --> 0:26:1,000
And I found that it was probably my favorite episode ever

530
0:26:11.747,000 --> 0:26:12,000
of the TED Interview.

531
0:26:13.083,000 --> 0:26:17,000
And it was so moving how you spoke about your grief then.

532
0:26:17.675,000 --> 0:26:21,000
And I feel like that's a potential resource to people.

533
0:26:21.705,000 --> 0:26:25,000
I know we were both sitting there shedding tears,

534
0:26:26.219,000 --> 0:26:32,000
and I found that an extraordinary experience personally, to be sure.

535
0:26:33.278,000 --> 0:26:34,000
But somehow ...

536
0:26:36.145,000 --> 0:26:38,000
in this moment,

537
0:26:38.591,000 --> 0:26:42,000
if you follow this journey of curiosity,

538
0:26:43.072,000 --> 0:26:46,000
if you walk towards some of the harder moments,

539
0:26:46.708,000 --> 0:26:5,000
do you think that this actually can be a creative time for people

540
0:26:51.516,000 --> 0:26:53,000
if they're willing to do that?

541
0:26:54.842,000 --> 0:26:57,000
EG: Absolutely, and I don't think creativity in this case

542
0:26:58.382,000 --> 0:27:01,000
has to necessarily mean that you write the Great American Novel

543
0:27:02.009,000 --> 0:27:04,000
or start that business you always intended to start.

544
0:27:04.654,000 --> 0:27:06,000
It doesn't need to be so literal.

545
0:27:08.366,000 --> 0:27:11,000
We're going to be creating new worlds and new lives

546
0:27:11.938,000 --> 0:27:13,000
on the other side of this,

547
0:27:13.976,000 --> 0:27:15,000
and we're going to be doing that individually

548
0:27:16.161,000 --> 0:27:18,000
and we're going to be doing that collectively.

549
0:27:19.715,000 --> 0:27:23,000
I think of the shoots of small trees

550
0:27:23.803,000 --> 0:27:26,000
that can only come up after massive forest fires,

551
0:27:27.462,000 --> 0:27:3,000
where seed pods have to explode under great heat.

552
0:27:30.78,000 --> 0:27:32,000
We're in a kind of crucible moment right now,

553
0:27:33.312,000 --> 0:27:35,000
and I wouldn't begin to have the hubris

554
0:27:36.066,000 --> 0:27:39,000
to predict what sort of creativity will come,

555
0:27:39.773,000 --> 0:27:43,000
but look, if history is any measure, what we'll probably see

556
0:27:44.368,000 --> 0:27:47,000
is people at their best and people at their worst.

557
0:27:48.186,000 --> 0:27:5,000
But I think we'll see more of people at their best,

558
0:27:51.019,000 --> 0:27:52,000
because that's typically how it works.

559
0:27:53.447,000 --> 0:27:55,000
CA: I mean, your model of how creativity happens

560
0:27:56.383,000 --> 0:28:,000
is that it doesn't all come from within.

561
0:28:00.812,000 --> 0:28:02,000
It's not like you have to sit there, saying,

562
0:28:02.884,000 --> 0:28:05,000
"OK, this is my moment to be creative. Come on. Be creative. Be creative."

563
0:28:06.487,000 --> 0:28:1,000
It involves, fundamentally, an openness to something coming to you,

564
0:28:10.733,000 --> 0:28:12,000
to be open, to be curious, listening,

565
0:28:13.742,000 --> 0:28:16,000
but then just to be open to that moment.

566
0:28:17.179,000 --> 0:28:21,000
Perhaps that could apply even more now than ever,

567
0:28:21.544,000 --> 0:28:27,000
just because we have this huge distraction

568
0:28:28.117,000 --> 0:28:29,000
of the news,

569
0:28:29.533,000 --> 0:28:31,000
some other distractions are taken away.

570
0:28:31.613,000 --> 0:28:33,000
Is there a chance that if people listened,

571
0:28:33.74,000 --> 0:28:35,000
they actually can receive more at this moment?

572
0:28:37.196,000 --> 0:28:39,000
EG: I think so, and I think, again,

573
0:28:39.77,000 --> 0:28:42,000
if you stop thinking about your self-isolation

574
0:28:43.657,000 --> 0:28:46,000
and your social distancing as quarantine

575
0:28:46.999,000 --> 0:28:49,000
and you start thinking of it as a retreat,

576
0:28:50.371,000 --> 0:28:52,000
you'll find that you can't really tell the difference

577
0:28:53.102,000 --> 0:28:55,000
between quarantine and retreat.

578
0:28:55.68,000 --> 0:28:57,000
You know, a lot of you out there have dreamed, I've heard you,

579
0:28:58.696,000 --> 0:29:01,000
because I talked about going to India to an ashram for four months

580
0:29:01.901,000 --> 0:29:03,000
and God, I can't tell you how many people I've heard say,

581
0:29:04.673,000 --> 0:29:05,000
"I wish I could do that."

582
0:29:05.948,000 --> 0:29:06,000
I'm like, "Well, you got it."

583
0:29:07.893,000 --> 0:29:09,000
And by the way, this is what it felt like.

584
0:29:11.249,000 --> 0:29:15,000
This is what it felt like to learn how to be present with yourself.

585
0:29:15.382,000 --> 0:29:17,000
I think my screen needs to move a bit.

586
0:29:18.2,000 --> 0:29:2,000
To learn how to be present with yourself

587
0:29:21.569,000 --> 0:29:24,000
means sitting in a lot of terror, sitting in a lot of anxiety,

588
0:29:25.264,000 --> 0:29:27,000
sitting in a lot of fear, sitting in a lot of shame,

589
0:29:27.912,000 --> 0:29:31,000
and being able to allow that

590
0:29:32.464,000 --> 0:29:33,000
without having to resist it,

591
0:29:34.198,000 --> 0:29:37,000
without having to reach outside yourself for something to numb yourself with.

592
0:29:37.877,000 --> 0:29:38,000
I also want to tell a story

593
0:29:39.41,000 --> 0:29:42,000
that a friend of mine, Martha Beck, told me

594
0:29:42.939,000 --> 0:29:47,000
about when she goes to South Africa and teaches animal-tracking courses.

595
0:29:48.216,000 --> 0:29:51,000
And she works with all these great African animal trackers,

596
0:29:52.051,000 --> 0:29:57,000
and these old men who have had these skills passed down for generations.

597
0:29:57.574,000 --> 0:29:59,000
And she was using it as an example

598
0:30:00.382,000 --> 0:30:02,000
of the difference between focus and openness.

599
0:30:02.909,000 --> 0:30:04,000
So I think sometimes the mistake people make

600
0:30:04.997,000 --> 0:30:05,000
when they want to be creative

601
0:30:06.46,000 --> 0:30:08,000
is they think they have to get really focused,

602
0:30:08.721,000 --> 0:30:11,000
and focus is an anxiety-producing energy as well.

603
0:30:12.485,000 --> 0:30:15,000
You've got to drill down and you feel your whole body tense.

604
0:30:16.426,000 --> 0:30:18,000
But what she described witnessing in these animal trackers

605
0:30:19.268,000 --> 0:30:21,000
is when they go out to hunt the lions,

606
0:30:21.906,000 --> 0:30:23,000
these old, old men, the very first thing they do

607
0:30:24.561,000 --> 0:30:28,000
is they sit down against a tree and they appear to go to sleep.

608
0:30:29.037,000 --> 0:30:31,000
They drop into a state that she calls

609
0:30:31.913,000 --> 0:30:34,000
and that the mystics call "wordless oneness."

610
0:30:35.608,000 --> 0:30:37,000
And wordless oneness, you can also call meditation.

611
0:30:38.536,000 --> 0:30:39,000
You can also call it the zone.

612
0:30:40.289,000 --> 0:30:43,000
But it's a stillness where you actually can drop your nervous system

613
0:30:44.17,000 --> 0:30:45,000
into such a quiet place

614
0:30:46.162,000 --> 0:30:51,000
that you have 360-degree awareness of your senses and of presence.

615
0:30:51.4,000 --> 0:30:54,000
And they'll sit like that, apparently doing nothing,

616
0:30:54.468,000 --> 0:30:55,000
for an extremely long time,

617
0:30:56.146,000 --> 0:30:58,000
just looking through half-lidded eyes at the world.

618
0:30:58.94,000 --> 0:31:01,000
And then, maybe an hour, two hours in, all of the sudden, they'll say,

619
0:31:03.177,000 --> 0:31:05,000
"The lion's over there."

620
0:31:05.272,000 --> 0:31:09,000
And so for me, I've learned to hold my creative wishes lightly

621
0:31:10.138,000 --> 0:31:11,000
in that same way.

622
0:31:11.313,000 --> 0:31:13,000
I'm between books right now and I don't have an idea for a book

623
0:31:14.316,000 --> 0:31:16,000
and in the past, that would have made me really anxious,

624
0:31:17.013,000 --> 0:31:2,000
but now I know -- take a lot of naps,

625
0:31:20.712,000 --> 0:31:23,000
go for a lot of walks, do a lot of drawings.

626
0:31:24.054,000 --> 0:31:28,000
I'm doing weird little art projects as I'm sitting here, to distract my mind.

627
0:31:28.705,000 --> 0:31:3,000
CA: Wait, wait. Bring that back.

628
0:31:30.849,000 --> 0:31:31,000
Hold that up.

629
0:31:32.024,000 --> 0:31:34,000
EG: Owls. (Laughs)

630
0:31:34.127,000 --> 0:31:36,000
CA: Aww. EG: Aren't they dear?

631
0:31:36.747,000 --> 0:31:38,000
CA: They're beautiful. Goodness me.

632
0:31:39.198,000 --> 0:31:42,000
EG: Well, I'm just playing with color and texture because it calms me,

633
0:31:42.517,000 --> 0:31:44,000
and I think if you can't think of what to do right now,

634
0:31:45.167,000 --> 0:31:48,000
I would suggest doing what you used to do when you were 10 years old

635
0:31:48.452,000 --> 0:31:51,000
that made you feel happy and relaxed, and that's often creativity and play.

636
0:31:52.129,000 --> 0:31:54,000
And for many of us who were anxious children --

637
0:31:54.426,000 --> 0:31:55,000
and I was an anxious child --

638
0:31:55.844,000 --> 0:31:57,000
we learned at an early age that we could sedate ourselves

639
0:31:58.634,000 --> 0:32:,000
with our curiosity and with our play,

640
0:32:00.999,000 --> 0:32:02,000
and then, usually around adolescence,

641
0:32:03.737,000 --> 0:32:06,000
the world taught us that there were faster and more immediate ways

642
0:32:06.936,000 --> 0:32:07,000
to bump out of that anxiety

643
0:32:08.325,000 --> 0:32:1,000
through sex or substances

644
0:32:10.421,000 --> 0:32:13,000
or distraction or workaholism or whatever we did

645
0:32:13.745,000 --> 0:32:14,000
and not have to sit with ourselves.

646
0:32:15.561,000 --> 0:32:17,000
And I think right now is a really good opportunity --

647
0:32:18.119,000 --> 0:32:22,000
You actually were on the right track when you were 10, whatever it was.

648
0:32:22.309,000 --> 0:32:24,000
So, you know, get some LEGOs.

649
0:32:25.087,000 --> 0:32:27,000
Get some LEGOs, get some coloring books,

650
0:32:27.366,000 --> 0:32:28,000
just get your hands in the mud,

651
0:32:28.891,000 --> 0:32:31,000
do whatever it is that will actually ground you into this,

652
0:32:32.888,000 --> 0:32:35,000
again, to take you out of the futurizing and the future-tripping

653
0:32:36.502,000 --> 0:32:38,000
that's going to cause you nothing but anxiety

654
0:32:38.661,000 --> 0:32:41,000
and not going to make you be of service.

655
0:32:42.39,000 --> 0:32:43,000
There's such a thing, too,

656
0:32:44.17,000 --> 0:32:46,000
that I just want to touch on if I can, for a minute,

657
0:32:46.674,000 --> 0:32:49,000
about empathetic overload and empathetic meltdown.

658
0:32:50.2,000 --> 0:32:52,000
We're taught that empathy is a good thing.

659
0:32:52.432,000 --> 0:32:54,000
I would suggest that in a case this traumatic,

660
0:32:55.044,000 --> 0:32:58,000
what you want to talk about replacing empathy with is compassion,

661
0:32:58.561,000 --> 0:33:,000
and the difference is extremely important.

662
0:33:00.703,000 --> 0:33:03,000
So compassion means "I'm actually not suffering right now,

663
0:33:04.647,000 --> 0:33:05,000
you are,

664
0:33:05.895,000 --> 0:33:07,000
I see your suffering, and I want to help you."

665
0:33:08.688,000 --> 0:33:09,000
That's what compassion is.

666
0:33:09.952,000 --> 0:33:11,000
Empathy is "You're suffering,

667
0:33:12.657,000 --> 0:33:14,000
and now I'm suffering because you're suffering."

668
0:33:15.582,000 --> 0:33:18,000
So now we have two people suffering and nobody who can serve,

669
0:33:19.113,000 --> 0:33:2,000
and nobody who can be of help,

670
0:33:20.702,000 --> 0:33:22,000
and if you knew how your empathetic suffering

671
0:33:23.377,000 --> 0:33:26,000
actually makes you into another patient who needs assistance,

672
0:33:27.113,000 --> 0:33:29,000
you would be more willing to dip into compassion.

673
0:33:29.868,000 --> 0:33:33,000
And what underlies compassion is the virtual courage,

674
0:33:34.057,000 --> 0:33:38,000
the courage to be able to sit with and witness somebody else's pain

675
0:33:39.034,000 --> 0:33:41,000
without inhabiting it yourself so much

676
0:33:41.256,000 --> 0:33:43,000
that you become another person who is suffering

677
0:33:43.526,000 --> 0:33:44,000
and now, there are no helpers.

678
0:33:45.273,000 --> 0:33:5,000
And it takes an enormous amount of courage to be able to watch that

679
0:33:50.351,000 --> 0:33:53,000
without diving into it and joining it and becoming sick yourself.

680
0:33:54.841,000 --> 0:33:56,000
CA: I mean, if empathy is just a feeling,

681
0:33:56.88,000 --> 0:33:58,000
does compassion, your use of compassion imply

682
0:33:59.603,000 --> 0:34:02,000
that it's turning that feeling into something potentially practical

683
0:34:03.056,000 --> 0:34:06,000
to actually do something, if you can, for that person?

684
0:34:07.639,000 --> 0:34:09,000
EG: It's recognizing that if I feel your pain,

685
0:34:09.806,000 --> 0:34:1,000
I can't help you in your pain,

686
0:34:11.715,000 --> 0:34:13,000
because now my pain has taken over me,

687
0:34:14.52,000 --> 0:34:18,000
and sometimes, I think all you need to do is know that

688
0:34:18.819,000 --> 0:34:19,000
and it makes you turn the ship. Right?

689
0:34:20.654,000 --> 0:34:22,000
One of my favorite teachers, Byron Katie, says,

690
0:34:23.122,000 --> 0:34:27,000
"My favorite thing about my suffering is that it isn't yours."

691
0:34:27.431,000 --> 0:34:29,000
"My favorite thing about my suffering is that it isn't yours.

692
0:34:30.369,000 --> 0:34:32,000
My favorite thing about your suffering is that it isn't mine."

693
0:34:33.329,000 --> 0:34:35,000
So it will be, eventually, we all take a turn suffering.

694
0:34:36.003,000 --> 0:34:38,000
You cannot move through this earth without it.

695
0:34:38.463,000 --> 0:34:4,000
When it's your turn, you'll know.

696
0:34:40.955,000 --> 0:34:41,000
When it's not your turn,

697
0:34:42.883,000 --> 0:34:44,000
stay out of that field of somebody else's pain,

698
0:34:45.756,000 --> 0:34:47,000
because you can't help them when you're in pain yourself.

699
0:34:48.447,000 --> 0:34:5,000
And then see if you can find the inner resolve and courage.

700
0:34:51.337,000 --> 0:34:54,000
And I think some of that is just based on accepting

701
0:34:54.518,000 --> 0:34:56,000
the Buddhist First Noble Truth,

702
0:34:56.673,000 --> 0:35:,000
which is that suffering is an unavoidable aspect of life on earth.

703
0:35:01.165,000 --> 0:35:03,000
We're all going to be in it at some point.

704
0:35:03.189,000 --> 0:35:04,000
We've all been in it at some point.

705
0:35:04.88,000 --> 0:35:05,000
And now, how can I help?

706
0:35:06.792,000 --> 0:35:08,000
I'm not saying this is easy.

707
0:35:08.882,000 --> 0:35:11,000
I'm just saying, also, if you're suffering

708
0:35:11.933,000 --> 0:35:13,000
from empathetic overload and empathetic meltdown,

709
0:35:14.443,000 --> 0:35:16,000
which means your adrenals are up, your stress is up,

710
0:35:16.897,000 --> 0:35:17,000
your endorphins are down,

711
0:35:18.223,000 --> 0:35:2,000
you're going into a parasympathetic collapse --

712
0:35:20.801,000 --> 0:35:22,000
this would be another time to discipline yourself

713
0:35:23.112,000 --> 0:35:24,000
to stay away from the news,

714
0:35:24.651,000 --> 0:35:26,000
because you actually will have a breakdown,

715
0:35:27.487,000 --> 0:35:29,000
and you won't be able to help the people around you

716
0:35:29.892,000 --> 0:35:3,000
who are the people who need help.

717
0:35:32.304,000 --> 0:35:33,000
CA: But have you seen any signs

718
0:35:34.1,000 --> 0:35:39,000
that if someone takes that empathy and compassion, let's say,

719
0:35:39.664,000 --> 0:35:44,000
and decides to act in some way,

720
0:35:44.893,000 --> 0:35:45,000
big or small, on behalf of someone,

721
0:35:46.609,000 --> 0:35:48,000
that actually shifts how they feel,

722
0:35:49.282,000 --> 0:35:5,000
that there's a healthiness to that?

723
0:35:50.997,000 --> 0:35:54,000
Or is that the language of just inducing more guilt in people?

724
0:35:55.857,000 --> 0:35:57,000
EG: No, I think there's a beautiful healthiness

725
0:35:58.766,000 --> 0:35:59,000
that can come from being of service,

726
0:36:00.56,000 --> 0:36:04,000
and that's also how I've been medicating my anxiety through this,

727
0:36:05.361,000 --> 0:36:08,000
by showing up in ways that I can with whatever resources I've got.

728
0:36:09.984,000 --> 0:36:11,000
Here's what you have to keep in mind, though,

729
0:36:12.167,000 --> 0:36:14,000
and this is what I keep reminding people.

730
0:36:14.675,000 --> 0:36:16,000
Right now, in my own personal sphere,

731
0:36:16.818,000 --> 0:36:2,000
there is more need than I have resources to fix.

732
0:36:21.135,000 --> 0:36:23,000
So I have to begin with that reality,

733
0:36:23.19,000 --> 0:36:27,000
and I have to have the courage to sit in that reality soberly

734
0:36:27.602,000 --> 0:36:28,000
and acknowledge that that's the case.

735
0:36:29.514,000 --> 0:36:3,000
The second thing I think

736
0:36:30.801,000 --> 0:36:32,000
emotional sobriety would require of me right now

737
0:36:33.166,000 --> 0:36:36,000
is to recognize that this is going to be a marathon, not a sprint.

738
0:36:36.822,000 --> 0:36:38,000
And so the first week of the crisis,

739
0:36:39.02,000 --> 0:36:4,000
I had this deluge

740
0:36:40.776,000 --> 0:36:43,000
of all my really energized, let's-save-the-world friends,

741
0:36:44.561,000 --> 0:36:45,000
all my creative friends,

742
0:36:45.99,000 --> 0:36:47,000
everybody was e-mailing, texting, Zooming,

743
0:36:48.085,000 --> 0:36:5,000
and they all had a response.

744
0:36:50.556,000 --> 0:36:52,000
"Let's do this! Let's do this! Let's fix it this way!"

745
0:36:53.11,000 --> 0:36:55,000
And I found myself joining with some of them

746
0:36:55.444,000 --> 0:36:56,000
and not joining with others,

747
0:36:56.911,000 --> 0:36:57,000
just, again, based on my intuition,

748
0:36:58.672,000 --> 0:37:,000
but I also found myself cautioning them,

749
0:37:01.27,000 --> 0:37:03,000
"Guys, this is a marathon."

750
0:37:03.539,000 --> 0:37:06,000
We're in mile one of what's going to be a very long marathon.

751
0:37:07.389,000 --> 0:37:08,000
So pace yourselves,

752
0:37:09.238,000 --> 0:37:11,000
and pace your resources.

753
0:37:11.84,000 --> 0:37:13,000
Don't overgive to the point where you collapse,

754
0:37:14.531,000 --> 0:37:16,000
because we're still going to need helpers two months from now,

755
0:37:17.494,000 --> 0:37:2,000
and we're still going to need helpers six months from now.

756
0:37:20.709,000 --> 0:37:22,000
And so, find a steady pace

757
0:37:23.542,000 --> 0:37:26,000
and be willing to be in it for the entire long haul.

758
0:37:28.606,000 --> 0:37:29,000
CA: Yeah. Helen.

759
0:37:32.669,000 --> 0:37:35,000
HW: Such great advice, Liz, and so many questions pouring in.

760
0:37:36.083,000 --> 0:37:38,000
One of them is from a therapist

761
0:37:38.178,000 --> 0:37:42,000
who confesses that she, and many of her clients,

762
0:37:42.4,000 --> 0:37:46,000
are having trouble with the letting go of control in this moment,

763
0:37:47.235,000 --> 0:37:5,000
and wonders if you have any advice on how to let go of control

764
0:37:50.983,000 --> 0:37:53,000
in order to be willing to feel everything that we're enduring.

765
0:37:55.484,000 --> 0:37:56,000
EG: Just this ...

766
0:37:58.752,000 --> 0:38:,000
This sense that you had that you had control

767
0:38:00.848,000 --> 0:38:02,000
was a myth to begin with.

768
0:38:03.533,000 --> 0:38:04,000
And that may not be comforting,

769
0:38:05.138,000 --> 0:38:08,000
except that I find it very comforting.

770
0:38:09.863,000 --> 0:38:11,000
You know, control is an illusion,

771
0:38:12.356,000 --> 0:38:16,000
and there are times where we're able to fool ourselves

772
0:38:16.76,000 --> 0:38:19,000
because we're so good at technology, we're so good at creating safe worlds

773
0:38:20.387,000 --> 0:38:23,000
where we're able to trick ourselves into believing that we're in control

774
0:38:23.8,000 --> 0:38:24,000
of any of this.

775
0:38:25.65,000 --> 0:38:26,000
But we're not,

776
0:38:26.825,000 --> 0:38:29,000
and the paradox, for me, of surrender

777
0:38:30.261,000 --> 0:38:32,000
is how relaxing it is.

778
0:38:33.122,000 --> 0:38:36,000
Nobody ever wants to surrender, because nobody wants to lose control,

779
0:38:36.635,000 --> 0:38:38,000
but if you recognize that you never had control,

780
0:38:38.945,000 --> 0:38:4,000
all you ever had was anxiety,

781
0:38:41.813,000 --> 0:38:43,000
and then you let go of the myth of control,

782
0:38:44.606,000 --> 0:38:48,000
you'll find that, I find that if I even say that sentence,

783
0:38:49.079,000 --> 0:38:5,000
"I'm losing control,"

784
0:38:50.421,000 --> 0:38:51,000
and then I remind myself,

785
0:38:51.69,000 --> 0:38:53,000
"You never had control, all you had was anxiety,

786
0:38:53.976,000 --> 0:38:55,000
and that's what you're having right now."

787
0:38:56.008,000 --> 0:38:57,000
So you're not letting go of anything.

788
0:38:57.85,000 --> 0:39:,000
Surrender means letting go of something you never even had.

789
0:39:00.937,000 --> 0:39:03,000
So there's an awakening that's happening right now,

790
0:39:04.009,000 --> 0:39:06,000
where what's happening is not that you're losing control.

791
0:39:06.706,000 --> 0:39:08,000
What's happening is that, for the first time,

792
0:39:08.85,000 --> 0:39:1,000
you're noticing that you never had it.

793
0:39:10.945,000 --> 0:39:13,000
And the world is doing its job.

794
0:39:14.167,000 --> 0:39:16,000
The job of the world is to change,

795
0:39:17.492,000 --> 0:39:18,000
constantly,

796
0:39:18.667,000 --> 0:39:19,000
and sometimes radically,

797
0:39:20.469,000 --> 0:39:21,000
and sometimes immediately,

798
0:39:21.779,000 --> 0:39:22,000
and it's doing its job,

799
0:39:23.462,000 --> 0:39:27,000
and that is also the norm of things.

800
0:39:27.667,000 --> 0:39:3,000
And again, we are adaptive and we're resilient and we can handle it.

801
0:39:31.231,000 --> 0:39:36,000
But I don't kid myself for a minute to think that I'm in control of anything

802
0:39:36.651,000 --> 0:39:38,000
that's ever happening.

803
0:39:39.08,000 --> 0:39:41,000
My realm of control is extremely small.

804
0:39:41.398,000 --> 0:39:42,000
It's usually about, like,

805
0:39:42.802,000 --> 0:39:44,000
might be able to go get a glass of water right now.

806
0:39:45.28,000 --> 0:39:48,000
Like, there's not a lot that I'm in control of.

807
0:39:48.794,000 --> 0:39:5,000
And I'm actually (Inaudible) I've ever been.

808
0:39:51.493,000 --> 0:39:55,000
HW: One more question from online, if I may,

809
0:39:56.333,000 --> 0:39:58,000
and then I will jump off again.

810
0:39:59.015,000 --> 0:40:03,000
You know, Chris, you and I, we're all in a pretty privileged position.

811
0:40:03.817,000 --> 0:40:05,000
TED has been able to go remote.

812
0:40:06.348,000 --> 0:40:07,000
We're able to work remotely.

813
0:40:07.793,000 --> 0:40:1,000
But many, many, many millions of people in the US and beyond

814
0:40:11.444,000 --> 0:40:14,000
are not able to do that,

815
0:40:14.76,000 --> 0:40:16,000
and people are really suffering.

816
0:40:16.864,000 --> 0:40:19,000
How can we help?

817
0:40:20.53,000 --> 0:40:23,000
What are your thoughts about people who are not able to socially distance,

818
0:40:24.426,000 --> 0:40:25,000
who are losing their jobs,

819
0:40:26.189,000 --> 0:40:29,000
the global catastrophe that is unveiling?

820
0:40:29.22,000 --> 0:40:32,000
How can we think about that in a humane and compassionate way?

821
0:40:33.076,000 --> 0:40:34,000
EG: It's crushing,

822
0:40:34.561,000 --> 0:40:37,000
and again, as with the same case

823
0:40:38.021,000 --> 0:40:41,000
of the person who said they had lost five family members,

824
0:40:41.24,000 --> 0:40:46,000
I can't, sitting in this position of comfort and safety,

825
0:40:46.772,000 --> 0:40:5,000
say anything that I think is going to be accurate

826
0:40:51.475,000 --> 0:40:52,000
and appropriate to that,

827
0:40:53.184,000 --> 0:40:58,000
other than to say that I just think of this Indian proverb

828
0:40:58.866,000 --> 0:40:59,000
that I keep going back to,

829
0:41:00.141,000 --> 0:41:03,000
which is, "I store my grain in the belly of my neighbor."

830
0:41:04.849,000 --> 0:41:1,000
Western, capitalistic society has taught and trained us to hoard long before this,

831
0:41:12.174,000 --> 0:41:13,000
long before this happened

832
0:41:13.524,000 --> 0:41:16,000
and people were hoarding toilet paper and canned goods.

833
0:41:16.967,000 --> 0:41:19,000
Advertising and the whole capitalist model has taught us scarcity,

834
0:41:20.794,000 --> 0:41:22,000
it's taught us that you have to be surrounded by abundance

835
0:41:23.572,000 --> 0:41:24,000
in order to safe.

836
0:41:25.143,000 --> 0:41:27,000
The disconnect between those who have and those who have not

837
0:41:27.985,000 --> 0:41:28,000
has never been bigger,

838
0:41:29.174,000 --> 0:41:32,000
and never in my lifetime, and probably in any of our lifetimes,

839
0:41:33.177,000 --> 0:41:35,000
has there been an invitation, again,

840
0:41:35.223,000 --> 0:41:37,000
to release the stranglehold on your hoarding.

841
0:41:38.531,000 --> 0:41:4,000
This is not the time for hoarding.

842
0:41:41.365,000 --> 0:41:44,000
This is the time to store your grain in the belly of your neighbor,

843
0:41:44.581,000 --> 0:41:48,000
in a way that is emotionally sober and accurate to what you can give,

844
0:41:49.023,000 --> 0:41:54,000
and to look at that in a really honest way,

845
0:41:54.069,000 --> 0:41:57,000
to not put your own family in danger, to not put yourself in crisis,

846
0:41:57.291,000 --> 0:41:58,000
but to be able to say,

847
0:41:58.847,000 --> 0:42:01,000
"What can I offer in the immediacy?"

848
0:42:02.752,000 --> 0:42:04,000
And then, in the longer term,

849
0:42:05.744,000 --> 0:42:08,000
a conversation about redistribution of resources,

850
0:42:08.91,000 --> 0:42:13,000
and why do so few have so much and why do so many have so little?

851
0:42:14.45,000 --> 0:42:16,000
But that's not a conversation I can fix today.

852
0:42:17.403,000 --> 0:42:19,000
That's, again, outside of my realm of control.

853
0:42:19.649,000 --> 0:42:2,000
But what I can do

854
0:42:21.371,000 --> 0:42:26,000
is unleash the white-knuckled grip that I have on what's mine

855
0:42:27.109,000 --> 0:42:31,000
and make sure that I'm going into the world with an open hand --

856
0:42:31.136,000 --> 0:42:33,000
again, not a panicked open hand,

857
0:42:34.018,000 --> 0:42:36,000
where I'm going to destroy myself to save somebody else,

858
0:42:36.952,000 --> 0:42:38,000
because then there will be no helper left,

859
0:42:39.065,000 --> 0:42:4,000
but in a reasonable way.

860
0:42:40.811,000 --> 0:42:44,000
I cannot save everybody. I can save a few.

861
0:42:45.493,000 --> 0:42:5,000
And that's the tragic, but, I think, sobering reality

862
0:42:51.032,000 --> 0:42:52,000
that I can offer right now,

863
0:42:52.637,000 --> 0:42:55,000
and again, underlying all of that, undergirding all of that

864
0:42:56.122,000 --> 0:42:59,000
is a recognition that anything that I have to say about people

865
0:42:59.763,000 --> 0:43:02,000
who are in extraordinary suffering right now is not enough.

866
0:43:04.786,000 --> 0:43:05,000
HW: I'll be back. Thank you.

867
0:43:06.572,000 --> 0:43:07,000
EG: Thanks.

868
0:43:08.537,000 --> 0:43:12,000
CA: Liz, talk to me a minute about anger.

869
0:43:13.481,000 --> 0:43:17,000
Like, I think a lot of, just from the conversation we just had,

870
0:43:17.744,000 --> 0:43:18,000
or just listening to you there,

871
0:43:19.323,000 --> 0:43:25,000
there are so many reasons to feel angry right now about what's going on.

872
0:43:26.056,000 --> 0:43:28,000
And part of me feels we should be.

873
0:43:29.038,000 --> 0:43:31,000
That's what anger is for.

874
0:43:31.809,000 --> 0:43:35,000
It's to highlight things that are unjust and unfair

875
0:43:36.189,000 --> 0:43:38,000
and that we must pay attention to,

876
0:43:38.928,000 --> 0:43:4,000
and yet part of me is honestly scared of it.

877
0:43:41.127,000 --> 0:43:45,000
I think there could be an eruption of anger that's dangerous,

878
0:43:45.357,000 --> 0:43:48,000
both personally and for society.

879
0:43:48.865,000 --> 0:43:5,000
Have you felt anger? What are you doing with it?

880
0:43:52.412,000 --> 0:43:55,000
EG: I feel anger at every White House press conference,

881
0:43:55.443,000 --> 0:43:59,000
and I think all thinking people do.

882
0:44:02.054,000 --> 0:44:05,000
I feel angry that this wasn't taken more seriously early on.

883
0:44:05.381,000 --> 0:44:08,000
I feel angry at myself that I didn't take it more seriously early on.

884
0:44:08.99,000 --> 0:44:13,000
As much as I feel contempt and disgust for government officials

885
0:44:14.145,000 --> 0:44:17,000
who I feel were slow to recognize how serious this is,

886
0:44:17.308,000 --> 0:44:2,000
I also have to be really candid that three weeks ago,

887
0:44:21.015,000 --> 0:44:23,000
I was one of the people walking around saying,

888
0:44:23.245,000 --> 0:44:25,000
"Why is everybody overreacting to this so much?"

889
0:44:26.218,000 --> 0:44:3,000
So I think we also have to own our own piece of that,

890
0:44:31.112,000 --> 0:44:35,000
and I think there are rolling waves of awakening

891
0:44:35.94,000 --> 0:44:36,000
that are happening in people,

892
0:44:37.647,000 --> 0:44:39,000
and so a lot of the anger I feel right now

893
0:44:39.672,000 --> 0:44:41,000
is for people who aren't taking this seriously enough,

894
0:44:42.456,000 --> 0:44:43,000
who aren't quarantining themselves,

895
0:44:44.425,000 --> 0:44:46,000
who are putting other people in danger.

896
0:44:47.615,000 --> 0:44:48,000
But a month ago, that was me.

897
0:44:49.046,000 --> 0:44:5,000
I was in the Hong Kong airport,

898
0:44:50.548,000 --> 0:44:52,000
sallying through the Hong Kong airport

899
0:44:52.638,000 --> 0:44:54,000
while everybody was scurrying around in masks and gloves,

900
0:44:55.355,000 --> 0:44:58,000
and I was like, "What's the big deal?"

901
0:44:58.574,000 --> 0:45:02,000
It takes people as long as it takes them to come to awakening,

902
0:45:03.456,000 --> 0:45:06,000
and some people, we have to also acknowledge, never will.

903
0:45:07.795,000 --> 0:45:11,000
Anger has its place,

904
0:45:11.867,000 --> 0:45:13,000
and I think that righteous anger,

905
0:45:14.669,000 --> 0:45:19,000
which is the kind of anger that says a violation has occurred here,

906
0:45:19.891,000 --> 0:45:22,000
a humanitarian violation is occurring here,

907
0:45:23.043,000 --> 0:45:27,000
can be very stirring for transformation.

908
0:45:30.028,000 --> 0:45:35,000
Again, it's how comfortable can you be, sitting with these discomforting emotions,

909
0:45:35.576,000 --> 0:45:37,000
and what are you going to do with your anger?

910
0:45:38.43,000 --> 0:45:39,000
CA: Umh.

911
0:45:39.604,000 --> 0:45:42,000
EG: Are you going to lash out at the people you're quarantined with?

912
0:45:42.857,000 --> 0:45:43,000
Are you going to go on Twitter rants?

913
0:45:44.723,000 --> 0:45:46,000
Is that useful? Is that productive?

914
0:45:47.683,000 --> 0:45:53,000
And so I think -- again, I keep using the words "emotional sobriety,"

915
0:45:54.181,000 --> 0:45:56,000
but the emotional sobriety that would be required

916
0:45:56.959,000 --> 0:45:58,000
is to feel that anger,

917
0:45:58.987,000 --> 0:45:59,000
acknowledge it,

918
0:46:00.655,000 --> 0:46:03,000
to show yourself mercy for how uncomfortable it is,

919
0:46:03.972,000 --> 0:46:08,000
and then to steadily, recognizing, again, that this is a marathon not a sprint,

920
0:46:09.028,000 --> 0:46:11,000
do what you reasonably can do

921
0:46:11.639,000 --> 0:46:12,000
to change the situation.

922
0:46:15.125,000 --> 0:46:17,000
CA: I mean, the part of me that's constantly looking

923
0:46:17.951,000 --> 0:46:18,000
for the better narrative

924
0:46:19.785,000 --> 0:46:23,000
hopes that the anger we feel now could almost displace some of --

925
0:46:24.467,000 --> 0:46:27,000
I mean, the world's been an angry place for the last couple years.

926
0:46:27.81,000 --> 0:46:29,000
There's been so much anger inflamed online.

927
0:46:30.319,000 --> 0:46:31,000
We've made each other angry,

928
0:46:31.771,000 --> 0:46:33,000
often, probably, unnecessarily --

929
0:46:34.269,000 --> 0:46:37,000
outrage sparking outrage, disgust, etc.

930
0:46:37.353,000 --> 0:46:4,000
I mean, is there any hope

931
0:46:40.948,000 --> 0:46:44,000
that this is a massive societal shaking up?

932
0:46:45.483,000 --> 0:46:48,000
It's like, don't be so silly. Look at what actually matters here.

933
0:46:49.309,000 --> 0:46:51,000
And we can at least focus more attention

934
0:46:52.112,000 --> 0:46:56,000
onto the things that, yes, some things that we really should be angry about,

935
0:46:56.184,000 --> 0:46:58,000
but other things that maybe ...

936
0:47:00.119,000 --> 0:47:02,000
you know, could lead people to say

937
0:47:02.91,000 --> 0:47:07,000
human connection really matters in this moment.

938
0:47:08.46,000 --> 0:47:1,000
People from all sides, we need each other.

939
0:47:10.508,000 --> 0:47:16,000
We just have to use this as a moment when we come together.

940
0:47:17.056,000 --> 0:47:19,000
How do you think about that?

941
0:47:19.93,000 --> 0:47:22,000
Like, how do we turn some of these negative emotions

942
0:47:23.763,000 --> 0:47:27,000
into a force for good that at least gives us some permission

943
0:47:27.921,000 --> 0:47:3,000
to hope that something special comes out of all this.

944
0:47:31.757,000 --> 0:47:33,000
EG: Well, I think you have to give yourself permission to hope,

945
0:47:34.762,000 --> 0:47:38,000
and I don't think it's unreasonable to give yourself permission to hope,

946
0:47:38.961,000 --> 0:47:41,000
because, again, our resilience, our resourcefulness,

947
0:47:42.032,000 --> 0:47:44,000
and the way that history has shown

948
0:47:44.057,000 --> 0:47:46,000
how catastrophe can lead to transformation,

949
0:47:46.803,000 --> 0:47:49,000
gives us, actually, I think, reasonable cause to hope.

950
0:47:50.557,000 --> 0:47:53,000
One thing that I'm noticing that I'm, like, a little bit amused by

951
0:47:53.734,000 --> 0:47:55,000
is that when people start predicting

952
0:47:55.955,000 --> 0:47:58,000
what the post-pandemic world is going to be,

953
0:47:59.637,000 --> 0:48:02,000
I notice that their predictions seem to be, suspiciously,

954
0:48:02.693,000 --> 0:48:05,000
in exact alignment with their personal worldview.

955
0:48:06.233,000 --> 0:48:11,000
So my friends who are utopians are already living in this utopian future

956
0:48:11.75,000 --> 0:48:13,000
where this is going to be the big change.

957
0:48:14.486,000 --> 0:48:16,000
My friends who are dystopians

958
0:48:16.551,000 --> 0:48:2,000
are already predicting that this is the official beginning of the police state

959
0:48:20.837,000 --> 0:48:24,000
and the disastrous new world order.

960
0:48:25.653,000 --> 0:48:28,000
I think there's a lot of hubris in trying to imagine

961
0:48:28.891,000 --> 0:48:29,000
what that new world could be.

962
0:48:30.52,000 --> 0:48:33,000
A quote that I love that a friend of mine always says

963
0:48:33.639,000 --> 0:48:36,000
is "When people aren't busy being the worst, they're the best."

964
0:48:37.232,000 --> 0:48:41,000
And I think that gives me hope.

965
0:48:41.946,000 --> 0:48:42,000
And it's true the other way, too.

966
0:48:43.598,000 --> 0:48:48,000
When people aren't busy being the best, they're the worst.

967
0:48:49.808,000 --> 0:48:51,000
I'm terrible at social engineering, Chris,

968
0:48:51.927,000 --> 0:48:52,000
and you know this,

969
0:48:53.601,000 --> 0:48:55,000
and you have great, better minds than mine

970
0:48:56.452,000 --> 0:48:59,000
who can come on and talk about this on the global scale.

971
0:49:00.007,000 --> 0:49:05,000
The only world that I have a really intimate, familiar engagement with

972
0:49:05.881,000 --> 0:49:06,000
is this one,

973
0:49:07.633,000 --> 0:49:09,000
and on the individual level, what I understand

974
0:49:10.139,000 --> 0:49:13,000
is that the only world that any of us are ever going to live in is this one.

975
0:49:13.736,000 --> 0:49:18,000
And so minding this, and learning how to calm this,

976
0:49:19.345,000 --> 0:49:2,000
how to open this,

977
0:49:20.546,000 --> 0:49:21,000
how to get on the other side

978
0:49:22.372,000 --> 0:49:25,000
of the emotions that are causing harm to you and others,

979
0:49:25.511,000 --> 0:49:27,000
that's my work, you know?

980
0:49:27.809,000 --> 0:49:3,000
Personally, whatever role I have in the public sphere.

981
0:49:31.853,000 --> 0:49:32,000
CA: You're an extraordinary storyteller

982
0:49:33.791,000 --> 0:49:37,000
and you already told us one amazing story earlier on.

983
0:49:38.29,000 --> 0:49:41,000
Have you come across any other recent stories

984
0:49:41.401,000 --> 0:49:44,000
that have given you reason for hope, perhaps?

985
0:49:45.101,000 --> 0:49:46,000
EG: Well, I'll give you one,

986
0:49:46.687,000 --> 0:49:49,000
and this one, I delight in.

987
0:49:49.981,000 --> 0:49:52,000
Years ago, 20 years ago in New York City --

988
0:49:53.327,000 --> 0:49:54,000
30 years ago, I was in my 20s --

989
0:49:55.018,000 --> 0:49:58,000
I was friends with a woman named Winifred, who was in her 90s.

990
0:49:58.677,000 --> 0:50:02,000
She was this really cool West Village bohemian artist

991
0:50:03.248,000 --> 0:50:05,000
who had lived in Greenwich Village for her entire life,

992
0:50:06.071,000 --> 0:50:1,000
had had a very storied and checkered and wild life,

993
0:50:10.26,000 --> 0:50:14,000
surrounding herself with intellectuals and poets and artists and adventure,

994
0:50:14.825,000 --> 0:50:16,000
and she'd had a lot of loss and a lot of gain,

995
0:50:17.515,000 --> 0:50:19,000
and she was this extremely passionate person

996
0:50:20.318,000 --> 0:50:23,000
who had friends of all ages, which was something I admired about her.

997
0:50:23.602,000 --> 0:50:25,000
I was friends with her. I was 25, she was 95.

998
0:50:26.04,000 --> 0:50:29,000
But I would call her my very good friend, and she had a lot of friends.

999
0:50:29.525,000 --> 0:50:3,000
She was so open to everything.

1000
0:50:31.377,000 --> 0:50:32,000
And at her 95th birthday party,

1001
0:50:33.256,000 --> 0:50:36,000
I asked her, "What have you learned, more than anything else?"

1002
0:50:37.256,000 --> 0:50:39,000
Because she was such a creature of learning.

1003
0:50:39.329,000 --> 0:50:4,000
I wrote about her in "Big Magic."

1004
0:50:41.009,000 --> 0:50:42,000
I said to her one time,

1005
0:50:42.589,000 --> 0:50:44,000
"What's your favorite book that you've ever read?"

1006
0:50:44.977,000 --> 0:50:46,000
And she said, "I can't say my favorite book

1007
0:50:47.072,000 --> 0:50:5,000
because there's been so many, but I can tell you my favorite subject,

1008
0:50:50.4,000 --> 0:50:51,000
the history of ancient Mesopotamia,

1009
0:50:52.172,000 --> 0:50:54,000
which I started learning when I was 80 and it changed my life."

1010
0:50:55.155,000 --> 0:50:56,000
And it did.

1011
0:50:56.377,000 --> 0:50:58,000
She'd gone on these expeditions to Jordan and Iraq.

1012
0:50:58.818,000 --> 0:51:,000
She was just so full of living, you know?

1013
0:51:01.806,000 --> 0:51:06,000
And I said to her, "What have you learned in all of your experiences?

1014
0:51:07.567,000 --> 0:51:1,000
What is the most central thing that you've learned?"

1015
0:51:10.806,000 --> 0:51:13,000
And she said, "Human beings can adapt to anything.

1016
0:51:14.864,000 --> 0:51:16,000
Human beings can adapt to absolutely anything."

1017
0:51:17.18,000 --> 0:51:18,000
And then she said this great line:

1018
0:51:18.859,000 --> 0:51:2,000
"If Martians landed on Earth tomorrow,

1019
0:51:21.119,000 --> 0:51:24,000
it would be off the front pages of the newspaper by next Tuesday.

1020
0:51:24.517,000 --> 0:51:25,000
We would already be used to it."

1021
0:51:26.313,000 --> 0:51:29,000
Right? And there's a level at which I'm seeing this adaptation happening.

1022
0:51:30.095,000 --> 0:51:32,000
And that is both a good and a bad thing. Right?

1023
0:51:32.461,000 --> 0:51:36,000
We can get used to totalitarianism, but we can also get used to --

1024
0:51:37.365,000 --> 0:51:41,000
I've gotten used to a world without the love of my life in it.

1025
0:51:42.104,000 --> 0:51:43,000
We can adapt.

1026
0:51:43.279,000 --> 0:51:47,000
And I keep using that line as a touchstone for myself,

1027
0:51:48.031,000 --> 0:51:51,000
because I don't know, nor do I presume to know,

1028
0:51:51.254,000 --> 0:51:53,000
what the world is going to be after this.

1029
0:51:53.661,000 --> 0:51:55,000
I know that it will be different from the one before.

1030
0:51:56.199,000 --> 0:51:58,000
I also just have to point out

1031
0:51:58.315,000 --> 0:52:02,000
that all y'all had a lot of complaints about the world we had before,

1032
0:52:02.799,000 --> 0:52:05,000
and I do a lot of talking, I do a lot of going around the world,

1033
0:52:05.878,000 --> 0:52:06,000
and [I don't remember] any one of you

1034
0:52:07.733,000 --> 0:52:09,000
raising your hand in any of the seminars I've taught

1035
0:52:10.203,000 --> 0:52:11,000
over the last years,

1036
0:52:11.621,000 --> 0:52:13,000
and saying, "We are living in a golden age

1037
0:52:13.914,000 --> 0:52:16,000
and I'm so grateful and appreciative for all that I have,"

1038
0:52:17.263,000 --> 0:52:18,000
now you want that world back, right?

1039
0:52:19.064,000 --> 0:52:23,000
So let's actually remember that as we go forward,

1040
0:52:23.492,000 --> 0:52:26,000
that this moment, for some of us, that we're in right now,

1041
0:52:27.071,000 --> 0:52:29,000
might be one that we look back later and say,

1042
0:52:29.304,000 --> 0:52:33,000
"Wow, actually, that was pretty good, and I didn't have any gratitude for it."

1043
0:52:33.594,000 --> 0:52:37,000
So personally, I'm just hoping that at an intimate level --

1044
0:52:37.658,000 --> 0:52:4,000
and again, this is not a socioeconomic, global political level,

1045
0:52:41.332,000 --> 0:52:47,000
but it's an invitation to actually be grateful for the safety that you have

1046
0:52:47.712,000 --> 0:52:49,000
and the people that you have,

1047
0:52:49.801,000 --> 0:52:51,000
and maybe carry that forward a little bit.

1048
0:52:52.369,000 --> 0:52:54,000
Maybe. We're really good at forgetting.

1049
0:52:54.721,000 --> 0:52:57,000
Once a crisis is over, we're really good at forgetting our gratitude.

1050
0:52:58.023,000 --> 0:52:59,000
It's one of our great gifts.

1051
0:52:59.46,000 --> 0:53:,000
But you might want to make a note

1052
0:53:01.444,000 --> 0:53:03,000
to actually try to be grateful for what you have.

1053
0:53:03.834,000 --> 0:53:04,000
(Laughs)

1054
0:53:05.617,000 --> 0:53:08,000
CA: Thank you, Liz. I think we have a last question from our online friends.

1055
0:53:10.013,000 --> 0:53:12,000
HW: Yeah, what crisis, right?

1056
0:53:12.816,000 --> 0:53:18,000
So Liz, just a request for a concrete strategy

1057
0:53:18.9,000 --> 0:53:22,000
to try and reduce the fear or the shame that is coming at this moment.

1058
0:53:24.106,000 --> 0:53:25,000
EG: I'll give you mine,

1059
0:53:25.281,000 --> 0:53:29,000
and it may feel weird and out of reach and woo-woo,

1060
0:53:29.487,000 --> 0:53:31,000
but I'm beyond that at this point,

1061
0:53:31.512,000 --> 0:53:35,000
and it has been a game changer and a life changer for me.

1062
0:53:35.9,000 --> 0:53:37,000
I have a 20-year-long practice

1063
0:53:38.425,000 --> 0:53:4,000
of writing myself, every day,

1064
0:53:41.094,000 --> 0:53:43,000
a letter from Love.

1065
0:53:43.2,000 --> 0:53:46,000
Now this may not feel concrete. It may feel very airy.

1066
0:53:47.739,000 --> 0:53:51,000
But what it does is that it helps me through my anxiety,

1067
0:53:52.01,000 --> 0:53:55,000
and I need it every single day, because I'm anxious every single day.

1068
0:53:55.352,000 --> 0:53:57,000
I wake up frightened every day. I wake up shamed every day.

1069
0:53:58.139,000 --> 0:53:59,000
I wake up angry every day.

1070
0:53:59.448,000 --> 0:54:,000
All of the difficult emotions

1071
0:54:00.87,000 --> 0:54:02,000
that run through the software of a human consciousness

1072
0:54:03.791,000 --> 0:54:05,000
are running through my software all the time,

1073
0:54:05.997,000 --> 0:54:07,000
and they cause me pain and they cause me fear,

1074
0:54:08.251,000 --> 0:54:1,000
and they cause me distress, and they make me sick.

1075
0:54:10.711,000 --> 0:54:11,000
So, 20 years ago,

1076
0:54:12.038,000 --> 0:54:15,000
when I was going through a very bad divorce and a depression,

1077
0:54:15.577,000 --> 0:54:17,000
I began this tactic,

1078
0:54:17.895,000 --> 0:54:19,000
and the tactic is that I will sit down with a notebook

1079
0:54:20.894,000 --> 0:54:23,000
and I will write to myself, from myself,

1080
0:54:24.046,000 --> 0:54:25,000
a letter from Love.

1081
0:54:25.53,000 --> 0:54:27,000
And what I mean by "Love" is not romantic love.

1082
0:54:27.975,000 --> 0:54:33,000
It's the infinite, bottomlessly merciful source of all human compassion.

1083
0:54:34.799,000 --> 0:54:36,000
And every single one of these letters begins the same way.

1084
0:54:37.539,000 --> 0:54:39,000
It starts with me saying, "I need you."

1085
0:54:39.902,000 --> 0:54:41,000
It's a dialogue. It starts with me saying, "I need you,"

1086
0:54:42.833,000 --> 0:54:44,000
and Love saying, "I'm right here."

1087
0:54:45.291,000 --> 0:54:46,000
And then I say what I'm going through.

1088
0:54:47.195,000 --> 0:54:49,000
"I'm really angry right now. I'm terrified. I'm spinning.

1089
0:54:49.981,000 --> 0:54:5,000
I can't sleep. I'm anxious."

1090
0:54:51.385,000 --> 0:54:55,000
And then I just allow to come through my hand whatever,

1091
0:54:56.22,000 --> 0:54:57,000
if you could imagine the most loving,

1092
0:54:58.128,000 --> 0:55:,000
compassionate, merciful voice in the world,

1093
0:55:00.152,000 --> 0:55:03,000
if they were in the room with you, what would you want them to say?

1094
0:55:03.361,000 --> 0:55:04,000
And you say that to yourself.

1095
0:55:04.794,000 --> 0:55:06,000
And so for me, that usually is a combination

1096
0:55:07.176,000 --> 0:55:09,000
of these sorts of phrases:

1097
0:55:09.278,000 --> 0:55:13,000
"I've got you. I'm right here. I see how distressed you are.

1098
0:55:13.461,000 --> 0:55:14,000
It's all right.

1099
0:55:14.729,000 --> 0:55:16,000
I don't need you to feel better."

1100
0:55:17.074,000 --> 0:55:2,000
I think a lot of our anxiety is that we want to get out of that feeling

1101
0:55:20.494,000 --> 0:55:21,000
as fast as we can,

1102
0:55:21.669,000 --> 0:55:23,000
and what Love always says to me is,

1103
0:55:23.933,000 --> 0:55:26,000
"It makes no difference to me whether you're anxious or afraid

1104
0:55:27.599,000 --> 0:55:28,000
or angry or hurt.

1105
0:55:28.99,000 --> 0:55:29,000
I'm with you,

1106
0:55:30.165,000 --> 0:55:32,000
and I'll be with you through this entire thing

1107
0:55:32.907,000 --> 0:55:34,000
for however long it takes.

1108
0:55:35.153,000 --> 0:55:36,000
I'm not going anywhere.

1109
0:55:36.328,000 --> 0:55:39,000
I've got nowhere better to be right now than sitting with you, loving you.

1110
0:55:39.892,000 --> 0:55:41,000
I'll be with you at the moment of your death.

1111
0:55:42.042,000 --> 0:55:44,000
I was here with you at the moment of your birth.

1112
0:55:44.359,000 --> 0:55:45,000
There's nothing you can do to lose me.

1113
0:55:46.258,000 --> 0:55:48,000
You can't fail. You can't do this wrong.

1114
0:55:48.305,000 --> 0:55:49,000
You are infinitely, bottomlessly loved."

1115
0:55:50.288,000 --> 0:55:54,000
And it's so interesting to me that the opposite of fear in my life,

1116
0:55:55.018,000 --> 0:55:57,000
in my emotional landscape, on the color palette,

1117
0:55:57.741,000 --> 0:56:02,000
the opposite of fear isn't courage, the opposite of fear is love.

1118
0:56:02.836,000 --> 0:56:06,000
And that presence, a sense of, "I've got you," right?

1119
0:56:07.741,000 --> 0:56:09,000
Which is the thing that we'd all want somebody to say.

1120
0:56:10.543,000 --> 0:56:12,000
"I've got you, and it's going to be all right."

1121
0:56:13.157,000 --> 0:56:14,000
I would love to know, neurologically,

1122
0:56:15.043,000 --> 0:56:17,000
what actually happens in my mind when I do this,

1123
0:56:17.535,000 --> 0:56:2,000
but what happens to me physiologically is that my mind,

1124
0:56:21.296,000 --> 0:56:25,000
just hearing those words and seeing those words, settles,

1125
0:56:25.439,000 --> 0:56:29,000
and then from there, I'm able to take the next intuitive right action

1126
0:56:30.037,000 --> 0:56:31,000
the best that I can.

1127
0:56:32.184,000 --> 0:56:34,000
CA: Liz, you can say no to this,

1128
0:56:34.723,000 --> 0:56:36,000
it may be a totally inappropriate thing to ask,

1129
0:56:36.945,000 --> 0:56:39,000
but you don't happen to have a letter from the last day or two

1130
0:56:40.311,000 --> 0:56:42,000
that you'd consider reading, all or in part of?

1131
0:56:42.93,000 --> 0:56:43,000
I don't know how long they are.

1132
0:56:44.47,000 --> 0:56:48,000
EG: You're putting me on the spot. Let me see what we've got.

1133
0:56:50.164,000 --> 0:56:51,000
Let's see.

1134
0:56:51.875,000 --> 0:56:52,000
(Inaudible)

1135
0:56:56.104,000 --> 0:56:57,000
OK, so here's one.

1136
0:56:57.328,000 --> 0:57:01,000
So I was panicking because I want to offer my apartment in New York

1137
0:57:01.676,000 --> 0:57:03,000
to a woman who is a COVID-19 nurse

1138
0:57:04.272,000 --> 0:57:06,000
who's volunteered to come into New York City to help,

1139
0:57:06.875,000 --> 0:57:09,000
and I'm afraid that I'll infect my neighbors

1140
0:57:10.613,000 --> 0:57:11,000
if I let her come and stay there.

1141
0:57:12.492,000 --> 0:57:14,000
So I was up in the middle of the night,

1142
0:57:14.524,000 --> 0:57:18,000
thinking, ethically, is it appropriate for me to do this?

1143
0:57:19.12,000 --> 0:57:22,000
So I wrote, "I need you." And Love said, "I'm right here."

1144
0:57:22.432,000 --> 0:57:26,000
And then I said, "I want to offer that COVID-19 nurse my apartment,

1145
0:57:26.587,000 --> 0:57:29,000
but I'm afraid that my neighbors will get infected, and I'm scared,

1146
0:57:29.905,000 --> 0:57:3,000
and I don't know what the right move is.

1147
0:57:31.922,000 --> 0:57:32,000
Help me."

1148
0:57:33.112,000 --> 0:57:34,000
And Love said,

1149
0:57:34.533,000 --> 0:57:36,000
"I don't actually know what the right answer to that is,

1150
0:57:37.287,000 --> 0:57:38,000
but I'm with you."

1151
0:57:38.589,000 --> 0:57:4,000
And I said, "But what do you think I should do?"

1152
0:57:41.463,000 --> 0:57:44,000
And Love said, "Why don't you just sit with me right here for a minute

1153
0:57:44.82,000 --> 0:57:45,000
and be with me

1154
0:57:45.995,000 --> 0:57:47,000
and know that you're held no matter what,

1155
0:57:48.081,000 --> 0:57:49,000
that you cannot make the wrong choice,

1156
0:57:50.063,000 --> 0:57:52,000
that it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.

1157
0:57:53.019,000 --> 0:57:55,000
You're my beloved, I've got you.

1158
0:57:55.424,000 --> 0:57:58,000
I can see how much you're spinning, I can see how tired you are,

1159
0:57:58.806,000 --> 0:58:,000
and it doesn't matter to me whether you make this decision

1160
0:58:01.606,000 --> 0:58:03,000
in the next minute, in the next day, or not at all.

1161
0:58:04.082,000 --> 0:58:07,000
I'm with you, and I'll sit with you through this entire thing,

1162
0:58:07.121,000 --> 0:58:1,000
and I'll love you no matter what you decide to do at the end of this.

1163
0:58:10.423,000 --> 0:58:12,000
I will be just as much with you at the end of this decision

1164
0:58:13.272,000 --> 0:58:14,000
as am I with you now."

1165
0:58:14.701,000 --> 0:58:18,000
And then, I said, "So what do you think I should do?"

1166
0:58:18.839,000 --> 0:58:22,000
And Love says, "I think you should go get a glass of water,

1167
0:58:23.194,000 --> 0:58:25,000
and I think you should lie down and get some rest,

1168
0:58:25.671,000 --> 0:58:27,000
and we'll talk about it some more in the morning."

1169
0:58:28.242,000 --> 0:58:31,000
What I have found over the years of writing myself these letters from Love

1170
0:58:31.782,000 --> 0:58:32,000
is that Love never gives advice.

1171
0:58:33.417,000 --> 0:58:34,000
This is actually really good

1172
0:58:34.822,000 --> 0:58:36,000
for all of you who love to give unsolicited advice to people.

1173
0:58:37.705,000 --> 0:58:4,000
Love never gives advice beyond, "Why don't you get a glass of water?

1174
0:58:40.921,000 --> 0:58:41,000
Why don't you rest?

1175
0:58:42.338,000 --> 0:58:44,000
We'll try this again tomorrow.

1176
0:58:44.809,000 --> 0:58:47,000
You're doing your best, this is a hard time, and I've got you."

1177
0:58:47.879,000 --> 0:58:5,000
So I've got 20 years of those journals,

1178
0:58:51.34,000 --> 0:58:55,000
and I'm assuming that I'm going to need it for the rest of my life.

1179
0:58:57.061,000 --> 0:58:59,000
CA: Wow.

1180
0:58:59.274,000 --> 0:59:01,000
I don't know, Helen, I think we might be done.

1181
0:59:02.143,000 --> 0:59:04,000
I think I'm done. I can't ask any more after that.

1182
0:59:05.016,000 --> 0:59:08,000
HW: How beautiful. Good grief.

1183
0:59:08.665,000 --> 0:59:09,000
(CA laughs)

1184
0:59:10.632,000 --> 0:59:12,000
CA: Liz, you're really phenomenal.

1185
0:59:13.592,000 --> 0:59:15,000
You've just got this unique way

1186
0:59:15.791,000 --> 0:59:17,000
of articulating what others can't articulate,

1187
0:59:18.339,000 --> 0:59:23,000
and you've brought all of us to a very tender, intimate place,

1188
0:59:24.237,000 --> 0:59:25,000
and thank you for that.

1189
0:59:26.771,000 --> 0:59:27,000
EG: Thank you, Chris.

1190
0:59:28.12,000 --> 0:59:29,000
HW: Thank you so much.

1191
0:59:29.295,000 --> 0:59:3,000
EG: And thank you, Helen.

1192
0:59:30.571,000 --> 0:59:32,000
Take care of yourselves, everybody.

1193
0:59:33.287,000 --> 0:59:35,000
We're right here with each other through this.

1194
0:59:35.458,000 --> 0:59:36,000
We can do this.

1195
0:59:36.633,000 --> 0:59:38,000
CA: Thank you, Liz. Goodbye. HW: Thank you.

1196
0:59:41.658,000 --> 0:59:42,000
CA: Oof. HW: Oof.

1197
0:59:43.184,000 --> 0:59:44,000
(Laughter)

1198
0:59:45.429,000 --> 0:59:46,000
HW: Deep breaths.

1199
0:59:46.879,000 --> 0:59:49,000
CA: Yeah. No. That was special. That was special to me.

1200
0:59:49.945,000 --> 0:59:52,000
I know that you are all in different circumstances online,

1201
0:59:53.667,000 --> 0:59:55,000
and that there are so many elements to this thing.

1202
0:59:56.426,000 --> 1:00:01,000
There's the problems that those of us who are isolated have,

1203
1:00:02.172,000 --> 1:00:04,000
and in many ways, those are the luxurious problems,

1204
1:00:04.645,000 --> 1:00:06,000
and we're really aware of that.

1205
1:00:07.568,000 --> 1:00:08,000
But they're still problems,

1206
1:00:08.898,000 --> 1:00:1,000
and we're going to give space on these TED Connects

1207
1:00:11.628,000 --> 1:00:12,000
to many other voices as well.

1208
1:00:13.456,000 --> 1:00:17,000
I think we're hoping to hear next week from a doctor at the front line,

1209
1:00:18.11,000 --> 1:00:19,000
a voice from India, we hope,

1210
1:00:20.028,000 --> 1:00:23,000
on some of the horrifying things that are happening there,

1211
1:00:23.068,000 --> 1:00:28,000
and also some pretty amazing proposals

1212
1:00:28.46,000 --> 1:00:3,000
for how the world could come out of this,

1213
1:00:30.619,000 --> 1:00:34,000
like specific proposals on how we get past this period of lockdown

1214
1:00:35.056,000 --> 1:00:36,000
to bring back the economy.

1215
1:00:37.048,000 --> 1:00:39,000
All of this matters.

1216
1:00:39.939,000 --> 1:00:44,000
So I guess we want Helen and everyone to come back,

1217
1:00:45.163,000 --> 1:00:47,000
calendar this, share with friends,

1218
1:00:47.337,000 --> 1:00:49,000
and help us figure out how to use this time best.

1219
1:00:50.91,000 --> 1:00:53,000
HW: I also wanted to flag that I don't know if you were able

1220
1:00:54.03,000 --> 1:00:57,000
to tune in for Susan David's conversation earlier in the week.

1221
1:00:57.363,000 --> 1:01:01,000
We have launched a new podcast with Susan that launched on Monday.

1222
1:01:01.545,000 --> 1:01:04,000
We're calling it "Checking In with Susan David,"

1223
1:01:04.783,000 --> 1:01:08,000
and she is going to be sharing daily tips on how to deal with this pandemic.

1224
1:01:09.6,000 --> 1:01:14,000
And so you can find that wherever you find podcasts

1225
1:01:15.1,000 --> 1:01:17,000
in this day and age.

1226
1:01:17.467,000 --> 1:01:19,000
For this conversation, we will be archiving it.

1227
1:01:19.873,000 --> 1:01:2,000
It will be on Facebook,

1228
1:01:21.06,000 --> 1:01:22,000
and we'll also put it onto TED.com.

1229
1:01:22.985,000 --> 1:01:28,000
You can find the TED Interview podcast that Chris and Liz did last year,

1230
1:01:29.1,000 --> 1:01:31,000
which I confess just made me weep

1231
1:01:31.937,000 --> 1:01:33,000
for ... too long.

1232
1:01:34.672,000 --> 1:01:38,000
You can find that at go.ted.com/tedconnects.

1233
1:01:39.192,000 --> 1:01:4,000
But that's it from us.

1234
1:01:40.674,000 --> 1:01:44,000
And tomorrow, I want to flag that we have a very special treat,

1235
1:01:45.681,000 --> 1:01:48,000
which is less chat, more beauty.

1236
1:01:49.872,000 --> 1:01:53,000
We will be joined by the unbelievably talented Butterscotch,

1237
1:01:54.793,000 --> 1:01:58,000
who is a beatboxer and a singer and a musician and a sage,

1238
1:01:59.158,000 --> 1:02:,000
and an all-around delight,

1239
1:02:01.122,000 --> 1:02:03,000
and she is going to be giving us a glimpse into her world

1240
1:02:03.814,000 --> 1:02:07,000
and delighting us all with some sonic deliciousness.

1241
1:02:07.876,000 --> 1:02:08,000
So do tune in tomorrow.

1242
1:02:11.65,000 --> 1:02:13,000
CA: Thanks so much, everyone. We're in this together.

1243
1:02:14.928,000 --> 1:02:15,000
Stay safe. See you soon.

1244
1:02:16.704,000 --> 1:02:17,000
HW: See you soon. Be well.

2
0:00:15.96,000 --> 0:00:16,000
My name is Emiliano Salinas

3
0:00:17.46,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and I'm going to talk about the role

4
0:00:21.66,000 --> 0:00:23,000
we members of society play

5
0:00:23.76,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in the violent atmosphere

6
0:00:25.06,000 --> 0:00:28,000
this country is living in right now.

7
0:00:28.4,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I was born in 1976.

8
0:00:31.46,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family.

9
0:00:34.86,000 --> 0:00:36,000
As a child, I had a pretty normal life:

10
0:00:36.86,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I would go to school, play with my friends and cousins.

11
0:00:40.96,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But then my father became President of Mexico

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and my life changed.

13
0:00:46.76,000 --> 0:00:48,000
What I'm about to say,

14
0:00:49.06,000 --> 0:00:5,000
at least some of what I'm about to say,

15
0:00:50.56,000 --> 0:00:51,000
will cause controversy.

16
0:00:52.36,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Firstly, because I'm the one who's going to say it.

17
0:00:55.46,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And secondly, because what I'm going to say is true,

18
0:00:58.46,000 --> 0:01:,000
and it will make a lot of people nervous

19
0:01:00.46,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because it's something we don't want to hear.

20
0:01:03.11,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But it's imperative that we listen

21
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
because it's undeniable and definitive.

22
0:01:07.518,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It will also make members of

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
criminal organizations nervous

24
0:01:11.195,000 --> 0:01:12,000
for the same reasons.

25
0:01:12.96,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I'm going to talk about the role

26
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we members of society play

27
0:01:17.998,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in this phenomenon,

28
0:01:19.56,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and about four different response levels

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
we citizens have against violence.

30
0:01:25.56,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact

31
0:01:27.76,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that I'm Carlos Salinas de Gortari's son

32
0:01:29.66,000 --> 0:01:3,000
from the fact that I'm a citizen

33
0:01:31.46,000 --> 0:01:32,000
concerned about the country's current situation.

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Don't worry.

35
0:01:34.46,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's not necessary for understanding

36
0:01:36.46,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the importance of what I'm going to say.

37
0:01:39.96,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I think we have a problem in Mexico.

38
0:01:41.66,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We have a big problem.

39
0:01:42.96,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I think there's consensus on this.

40
0:01:44.96,000 --> 0:01:45,000
No one argues --

41
0:01:45.96,000 --> 0:01:46,000
we all agree there's a problem.

42
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
What we don't agree on

43
0:01:48.76,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is what the problem actually is.

44
0:01:52.06,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Is it the Zetas? The drug traffickers? The government?

45
0:01:56.76,000 --> 0:02:,000
Corruption? Poverty? Or is it something else?

46
0:02:00.96,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I think none of these is the problem.

47
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I don't mean they don't deserve attention.

48
0:02:05.46,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But we won't be able to take care of any of those things

49
0:02:07.93,000 --> 0:02:09,000
if we don't solve the real problem

50
0:02:10.06,000 --> 0:02:11,000
we have in Mexico first.

51
0:02:11.56,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The real problem we have is

52
0:02:12.95,000 --> 0:02:15,000
most of us Mexicans, we believe we are victims

53
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
of our circumstances.

54
0:02:17.906,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We are a country of victims.

55
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Historically, we've always acted as victims

56
0:02:23.01,000 --> 0:02:24,000
of something or somebody.

57
0:02:24.78,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We were victims of the Spaniards.

58
0:02:27.06,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Then we were victims of the French.

59
0:02:29.08,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio.

60
0:02:31.524,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Then we were victims of the PRI.

61
0:02:33.676,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Even of Salinas.

62
0:02:35.36,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And of El Peje.

63
0:02:37.481,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...

64
0:02:40.467,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Hold on! Wait a minute!

65
0:02:42.947,000 --> 0:02:45,000
What if none of these things is the problem?

66
0:02:46.482,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The problem is not the things we feel victims of.

67
0:02:49.785,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The problem is that we play the role of victims.

68
0:02:53.985,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims.

69
0:02:57.76,000 --> 0:02:59,000
If only we stopped feeling like victims,

70
0:02:59.96,000 --> 0:03:,000
if we stopped acting as victims,

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
our country would change so much!

72
0:03:04.495,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I'm going to talk about how to go from a society

73
0:03:07.96,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that acts as a victim of circumstances

74
0:03:09.659,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to a responsible, involved society

75
0:03:12.56,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that takes the future of its country in its own hands.

76
0:03:16.096,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I'm going to talk about four different levels

77
0:03:18.56,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of civil response against violence,

78
0:03:20.66,000 --> 0:03:22,000
from weakest

79
0:03:22.96,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to strongest.

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The first level, the weakest level of civil response against violence,

81
0:03:27.76,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is denial and apathy.

82
0:03:30.66,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Today, much of Mexican society is in denial

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
of the situation we're going through.

84
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We want to go on with our daily life

85
0:03:38.518,000 --> 0:03:4,000
even though we are not living under normal circumstances.

86
0:03:41.06,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Daily life in our country is,

87
0:03:43.76,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to say the least,

88
0:03:46.989,000 --> 0:03:47,000
under extraordinary, exceptional circumstances.

89
0:03:48.953,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It's like someone who has a serious illness

90
0:03:52.76,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and pretends it's the flu

91
0:03:54.76,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and it will just go away.

92
0:03:56.73,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu.

93
0:03:59.971,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But it doesn't.

94
0:04:02.073,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Mexico has cancer.

95
0:04:04.29,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And if we don't do something about it,

96
0:04:06.46,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the cancer will end up killing it.

97
0:04:09.614,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We need to move Mexican society

98
0:04:12.06,000 --> 0:04:14,000
from denial and apathy

99
0:04:14.06,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to the next level of citizen response,

100
0:04:16.46,000 --> 0:04:19,000
which is, effectively, recognition.

101
0:04:19.592,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And that recognition will sow fear --

102
0:04:23.426,000 --> 0:04:26,000
recognizing the seriousness of the situation.

103
0:04:26.585,000 --> 0:04:29,000
But, fear is better than apathy

104
0:04:30.232,000 --> 0:04:33,000
because fear makes us do something.

105
0:04:33.546,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Many people in Mexico

106
0:04:36.789,000 --> 0:04:37,000
are afraid today.

107
0:04:38.746,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We're very afraid.

108
0:04:40.222,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And we're acting out of that fear.

109
0:04:42.36,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And let me tell you what the problem is

110
0:04:44.06,000 --> 0:04:45,000
with acting out of fear --

111
0:04:45.76,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and this is the second level of civil response:

112
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
fear.

113
0:04:49.86,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Let's think about Mexican streets:

114
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
they're unsafe because of violence,

115
0:04:55.76,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so people stay at home.

116
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Does that make streets more or less safe?

117
0:05:02.46,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Less safe!

118
0:05:03.46,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So streets become more desolate and unsafe,

119
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
so we stay home more --

120
0:05:06.66,000 --> 0:05:08,000
which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe,

121
0:05:09.06,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and we stay home even more.

122
0:05:10.56,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This vicious circle ends up with the whole population

123
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
stuck inside their houses, scared to death --

124
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
even more afraid than when we were out on the streets.

125
0:05:17.76,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We need to confront this fear.

126
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We need to move Mexican society,

127
0:05:22.66,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the members of society who are at this level,

128
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to the next level, which is action.

129
0:05:27.46,000 --> 0:05:31,000
We need to face our fears and take back our streets,

130
0:05:31.46,000 --> 0:05:33,000
our cities, our neighborhoods.

131
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
For many people, acting involves courage.

132
0:05:40.46,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We go from fear to courage.

133
0:05:42.46,000 --> 0:05:44,000
They say, "I can't take it anymore.

134
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Let's do something about it."

135
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Recently --

136
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
this is a sensitive figure --

137
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
35 public lynchings have been recorded

138
0:05:56.46,000 --> 0:05:57,000
so far in 2010

139
0:05:58.06,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in Mexico.

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Usually it's one or two a year.

141
0:06:05.66,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now we're experiencing one every week.

142
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
This shows that society is desperate

143
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and it's taking the law into its own hands.

144
0:06:14.76,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Unfortunately, violent action --

145
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
though action is better than no action --

146
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but taking part in it

147
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
only disguises violence.

148
0:06:25.76,000 --> 0:06:27,000
If I'm violent with you

149
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and you respond with violence,

150
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
you become part of the violence

151
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and you just disguise my violence.

152
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So civil action

153
0:06:38.46,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is vital,

154
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but it's also vital to take people

155
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
who are at the level of courage

156
0:06:44.46,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and violent action

157
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to the next level,

158
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
which is non-violent action.

159
0:06:49.86,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It's pacific, coordinated civil action,

160
0:06:52.76,000 --> 0:06:54,000
which doesn't mean passive action.

161
0:06:54.76,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It means it's determined and effective,

162
0:06:57.56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but not violent.

163
0:07:00.06,000 --> 0:07:02,000
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico.

164
0:07:02.76,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Two years ago, in Galena City, Chihuahua,

165
0:07:07.46,000 --> 0:07:08,000
a member of the community was kidnapped,

166
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Eric Le Barón.

167
0:07:10.96,000 --> 0:07:11,000
His brothers, Benjamín and Julián,

168
0:07:12.56,000 --> 0:07:14,000
got together with the rest of the community

169
0:07:14.56,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to think of the best course of action:

170
0:07:16.96,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to pay the ransom,

171
0:07:19.06,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to take up arms and go after the kidnappers

172
0:07:23.56,000 --> 0:07:25,000
or to ask the government for help.

173
0:07:25.86,000 --> 0:07:27,000
In the end, Benjamín and Julián decided

174
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
the best thing they could do

175
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
was to organize the community and act together.

176
0:07:33.06,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So what did they do?

177
0:07:34.76,000 --> 0:07:36,000
They mobilized the whole community of Le Barón

178
0:07:37.06,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to go to Chihuahua,

179
0:07:39.86,000 --> 0:07:41,000
where they organized a sit-in

180
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
in the central park of the city.

181
0:07:44.56,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They sent a message to the kidnappers:

182
0:07:46.46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
"If you want your ransom come and get it.

183
0:07:49.46,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We'll be waiting for you right here."

184
0:07:51.86,000 --> 0:07:53,000
They stayed there.

185
0:07:53.86,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Seven days later, Eric was set free

186
0:07:56.36,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and was able to return home.

187
0:07:58.36,000 --> 0:08:01,000
This is an example of what an organized society can do,

188
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
a society that acts.

189
0:08:04.76,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Of course, criminals can respond.

190
0:08:06.96,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And in this case, they did.

191
0:08:08.96,000 --> 0:08:11,000
On July 7th, 2009,

192
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Benjamín Le Barón was murdered.

193
0:08:14.76,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But Julián Le Barón keeps working

194
0:08:17.46,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua

195
0:08:19.66,000 --> 0:08:21,000
for over a year.

196
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head.

197
0:08:24.96,000 --> 0:08:25,000
But he keeps fighting.

198
0:08:26.76,000 --> 0:08:27,000
He keeps organizing.

199
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
He keeps mobilizing.

200
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
These heroic acts are present all over the country.

201
0:08:32.86,000 --> 0:08:34,000
With a thousand Juliáns working together,

202
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Mexico would be a very different country.

203
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And they're out there!

204
0:08:38.76,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They just have to raise their hands.

205
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I was born in Mexico, I grew up in Mexico

206
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and along the way, I learned to love Mexico.

207
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land --

208
0:08:57.46,000 --> 0:08:59,000
not to mention all Mexican people --

209
0:08:59.46,000 --> 0:09:01,000
will agree that it's not difficult

210
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to love Mexico.

211
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I've traveled a lot

212
0:09:07.76,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have.

213
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
That devotion we feel

214
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
for the national football team.

215
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
That devotion we show

216
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
in helping victims of disasters,

217
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
such as the earthquake in 1985

218
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
or this year's floods.

219
0:09:25.76,000 --> 0:09:3,000
The passion with which we've been singing the national anthem

220
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
since we were kids.

221
0:09:32.76,000 --> 0:09:33,000
When we thought Masiosare

222
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
was the strange enemy,

223
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and we sang, with a childlike heart,

224
0:09:39.76,000 --> 0:09:44,000
"a soldier in each son."

225
0:09:44.96,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I think the biggest insult,

226
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the worst way you can offend a Mexican

227
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
is to insult their mother.

228
0:09:51.06,000 --> 0:09:55,000
A mother is the most sacred thing in life.

229
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children.

230
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We are going through the darkest moment

231
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
in our recent history.

232
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Our mother, Mexico, is being violated before our very eyes.

233
0:10:06.96,000 --> 0:10:09,000
What are we going to do?

234
0:10:09.96,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Masiosare, the strange enemy, is here.

235
0:10:12.46,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Where is the soldier in each son?

236
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Mahatma Gandhi,

237
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
one of the greatest civil fighters of all time, said,

238
0:10:23.06,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"Be the change you wish to see in the world."

239
0:10:27.06,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Today in Mexico we're asking for Gandhis.

240
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We need Gandhis.

241
0:10:32.76,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We need men and women who love Mexico

242
0:10:35.76,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and who are willing to take action.

243
0:10:38.76,000 --> 0:10:43,000
This is a call for every true Mexican

244
0:10:43.76,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to join this initiative.

245
0:10:45.76,000 --> 0:10:46,000
This is a call

246
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
so that every single thing we love about Mexico --

247
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the festivals, the markets,

248
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the restaurants, the cantinas,

249
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the tequila, the mariachis, the serenades,

250
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
the posadas, El Grito, the Day of the Dead,

251
0:11:01.06,000 --> 0:11:04,000
San Miguel, the joy, the passion for life,

252
0:11:04.46,000 --> 0:11:08,000
the fight and everything it means to be Mexican --

253
0:11:08.66,000 --> 0:11:12,000
doesn't disappear from this world.

254
0:11:13.06,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We're facing a very powerful opponent.

255
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
But we are many more.

256
0:11:18.76,000 --> 0:11:2,000
They can take a man's life.

257
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Anyone can kill me,

258
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
or you, or you.

259
0:11:24.76,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But no one can kill

260
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the spirit of true Mexicans.

261
0:11:29.76,000 --> 0:11:31,000
The battle is won,

262
0:11:31.76,000 --> 0:11:33,000
but we still have to fight it.

263
0:11:34.66,000 --> 0:11:39,000
2000 years ago, the Roman poet Juvenal

264
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
said something that today echoes

265
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
in the heart of every true Mexican.

266
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
He said, "Count it the greatest sin

267
0:11:50.56,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to prefer life to honor,

268
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
and for the sake of living

269
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to lose what makes life worth living."

270
0:12:03.86,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Thank you.

271
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Applause)

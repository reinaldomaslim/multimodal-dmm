1
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I got up this morning at 6:10 a.m.

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
after going to sleep at 12:45 a.m.

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I was awakened once during the night.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
My heart rate was 61 beats per minute --

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
my blood pressure, 127 over 74.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday,

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn't calculated.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine,

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
zero of alcohol.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index,

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
or the NPI-16,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is a reassuring 0.31.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We know that numbers are useful for us

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
when we advertise, manage, govern, search.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I'm going to talk about how they're useful when we reflect,

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
learn, remember

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and want to improve.

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
A few years ago, Kevin Kelly, my partner, and I

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
noticed that people were subjecting themselves

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that went far beyond the ordinary, familiar habits

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
such as stepping on a scale every day.

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
People were tracking their food via Twitter,

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
their kids' diapers on their iPhone.

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
They were making detailed journals

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
of their spending, their mood,

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
their symptoms, their treatments.

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Now, we know some of the technological facts

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that are driving this change in our lifestyle --

30
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices,

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the exponential improvement in data storage

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and data processing,

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors.

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
This little black dot there

35
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is a 3D accelerometer.

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It tracks your movement through space.

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It is, as you can see, very small and also very cheap.

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
They're now down to well under a dollar a piece,

39
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and they're going into all kinds of devices.

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But what's interesting

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is the incredible detailed information that you can get

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
from just one sensor like this.

43
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This kind of sensor

44
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
is in the hit biometric device --

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
among early adopters at the moment -- the Fitbit.

46
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This tracks your activity and also your sleep.

47
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It has just that sensor in it.

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You're probably familiar with the Nike+ system.

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor.

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's really just a pressure sensor

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
like the kind that's in a doorbell.

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And Nike knows how to get

53
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
your pace and distance from just that sensor.

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This is the strap

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that people use to transmit heart-rate data

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to their Nike+ system.

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This is a beautiful, new device

58
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that gives you detailed sleep tracking data,

59
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
not just whether you're asleep or awake, but also your phase of sleep --

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
deep sleep, light sleep, REM sleep.

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there.

62
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The rest of it is the bedside console;

63
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
just for reference, this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago --

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I mean, really until now.

65
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And this is the sleep tracking system of today.

66
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This just was presented

67
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
at a health care conference in D.C.

68
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler,

69
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but the top is a very small GPS transceiver,

70
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
which gives you the date and location

71
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of an asthma incident,

72
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
giving you a new awareness

73
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
of your vulnerability

74
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in relation to time and environmental factors.

75
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Now, we know that new tools

76
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
are changing our sense of self in the world --

77
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
these tiny sensors that gather data in nature,

78
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the ubiquitous computing

79
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that allows that data to be understood and used,

80
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and of course the social networks

81
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that allow people to collaborate and contribute.

82
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But we think of these tools as pointing outward,

83
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
as windows

84
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and I'd just like to invite you to think of them

85
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
as also turning inward

86
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and becoming mirrors.

87
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So that when we think about using them

88
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to get some systematic improvement,

89
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement,

90
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
for self-discovery, self-awareness, self-knowledge.

91
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Here's a biometric device:

92
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
a pair of Apple Earbuds.

93
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Last year, Apple filed some patents

94
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to get blood oxygenation,

95
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds.

96
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
What is this for?

97
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
What should it be for?

98
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Some people will say it's for biometric security.

99
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Some people will say it's for public health research.

100
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Some people will say it's for avant-garde marketing research.

101
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I'd like to tell you

102
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that it's also for self-knowledge.

103
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And the self isn't the only thing; it's not even most things.

104
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The self is just our operation center,

105
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
our consciousness,

106
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
our moral compass.

107
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So, if we want to act

108
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
more effectively in the world,

109
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we have to get to know ourselves better.

110
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Thank you.

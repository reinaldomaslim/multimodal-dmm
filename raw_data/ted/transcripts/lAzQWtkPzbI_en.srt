1
0:00:13.587,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Two hundred years of modern science.

2
0:00:17.678,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We have to admit

3
0:00:18.853,000 --> 0:00:19,000
that our performance is not great.

4
0:00:20.995,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The machines we build continue to suffer from mechanical failures.

5
0:00:25.109,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The houses we build do not survive severe earthquakes.

6
0:00:29.322,000 --> 0:00:32,000
But we shouldn't be so critical of our scientists for a simple reason:

7
0:00:33.817,000 --> 0:00:34,000
they didn't have much time.

8
0:00:36.08,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Two hundred years is not a lot of time,

9
0:00:38.424,000 --> 0:00:41,000
while nature had three billion years

10
0:00:41.671,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to perfect some of the most amazing materials,

11
0:00:45.297,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that we wish we had in our possession.

12
0:00:48.262,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Remember, these materials carry a quality assurance

13
0:00:52.926,000 --> 0:00:53,000
of three billion years.

14
0:00:55.694,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Take, for example, sequoia trees.

15
0:00:57.549,000 --> 0:01:01,000
They carry hundreds of tons for hundreds of years

16
0:01:02.243,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in cold weather, in warm climates,

17
0:01:05.185,000 --> 0:01:06,000
UV light.

18
0:01:06.552,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Yet, if you look at the structure by high-resolution electron microscopy,

19
0:01:11.149,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and you ask yourself, what is it made of,

20
0:01:14.196,000 --> 0:01:16,000
surprisingly, it's made of sugar.

21
0:01:16.992,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Well, not exactly as we drink in our tea.

22
0:01:19.825,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It's actually a nanofiber called nanocrystalline cellulose.

23
0:01:23.76,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And this nanocrystalline cellulose is so strong, on a weight basis,

24
0:01:29.749,000 --> 0:01:32,000
it's about 10 times stronger than steel.

25
0:01:33.092,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Yet it's made of sugar.

26
0:01:35.541,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So scientists all over the world believe that nanocellulose

27
0:01:39.386,000 --> 0:01:43,000
is going to be one of the most important materials for the entire industry.

28
0:01:44.328,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But here's the problem:

29
0:01:45.796,000 --> 0:01:48,000
say you want to buy a half a ton of nanocellulose

30
0:01:48.821,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to build a boat or an airplane.

31
0:01:50.852,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Well, you can Google, you can eBay, you can even Alibaba.

32
0:01:55.551,000 --> 0:01:56,000
You won't find it.

33
0:01:57.189,000 --> 0:02:,000
Of course, you're going to find thousands of scientific papers --

34
0:02:00.819,000 --> 0:02:04,000
great papers, where scientists are going to say this is a great material,

35
0:02:05.66,000 --> 0:02:07,000
there are lots of things we can do with it.

36
0:02:07.788,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But no commercial source.

37
0:02:10.286,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So we at the Hebrew University, together with our partners in Sweden,

38
0:02:14.998,000 --> 0:02:19,000
decided to focus on the development of an industrial-scale process

39
0:02:20.673,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to produce this nanocellulose.

40
0:02:23.093,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And, of course, we didn't want to cut trees.

41
0:02:26.251,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So we were looking for another source

42
0:02:28.974,000 --> 0:02:29,000
of raw material,

43
0:02:30.35,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and we found one -- in fact, the sludge of the paper industry.

44
0:02:35.617,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The reason: there is a lot of it.

45
0:02:38.159,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Europe alone produces 11 million tons

46
0:02:41.993,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of that material annually.

47
0:02:44.447,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's the equivalent of a mountain three kilometers high,

48
0:02:49.078,000 --> 0:02:5,000
sitting on a soccer field.

49
0:02:51.039,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And we produce this mountain every year.

50
0:02:53.693,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So for everybody, it's an environmental problem,

51
0:02:57.194,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and for us, it's a gold mine.

52
0:03:00.923,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So now, we are actually producing, on an industrial scale in Israel,

53
0:03:05.109,000 --> 0:03:07,000
nanocellulose, and very soon, in Sweden.

54
0:03:07.684,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We can do a lot of things with the material.

55
0:03:09.858,000 --> 0:03:1,000
For example,

56
0:03:11.257,000 --> 0:03:14,000
we have shown that by adding only a small percent of nanocellulose

57
0:03:15.677,000 --> 0:03:18,000
into cotton fibers, the same as my shirt is made of,

58
0:03:19.595,000 --> 0:03:21,000
it increases its strength dramatically.

59
0:03:22.611,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So this can be used for making amazing things,

60
0:03:27.834,000 --> 0:03:31,000
like super-fabrics for industrial and medical applications.

61
0:03:33.019,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But this is not the only thing.

62
0:03:34.937,000 --> 0:03:37,000
For example, self-standing, self-supporting structures,

63
0:03:38.815,000 --> 0:03:4,000
like the shelters that you can see now,

64
0:03:41.435,000 --> 0:03:45,000
actually are now showcasing in the Venice Biennale for Architecture.

65
0:03:48.702,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Nature actually didn't stop its wonders

66
0:03:52.683,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in the plant kingdom.

67
0:03:55.144,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Think about insects.

68
0:03:56.515,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Cat fleas, for example,

69
0:03:58.11,000 --> 0:04:01,000
have the ability to jump about a hundred times their height.

70
0:04:02.863,000 --> 0:04:03,000
That's amazing.

71
0:04:04.343,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It's the equivalent of a person

72
0:04:06.963,000 --> 0:04:09,000
standing in the middle of Liberty Island in New York,

73
0:04:11.033,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and in a single jump,

74
0:04:12.612,000 --> 0:04:14,000
going to the top of the Statue of Liberty.

75
0:04:16.776,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I'm sure everybody would like to do that.

76
0:04:19.236,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So the question is:

77
0:04:20.559,000 --> 0:04:21,000
How do cat fleas do it?

78
0:04:22.941,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It turns out, they make this wonderful material,

79
0:04:26.235,000 --> 0:04:27,000
which is called resilin.

80
0:04:28.467,000 --> 0:04:3,000
In simple words, resilin, which is a protein,

81
0:04:32.104,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is the most elastic rubber on Earth.

82
0:04:37.565,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You can stretch it,

83
0:04:39.757,000 --> 0:04:4,000
you can squish it,

84
0:04:41.408,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and it doesn't lose almost any energy to the environment.

85
0:04:45.699,000 --> 0:04:46,000
When you release it -- snap!

86
0:04:47.556,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It brings back all the energy.

87
0:04:50.201,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So I'm sure everybody would like to have that material.

88
0:04:53.116,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But here's the problem:

89
0:04:55.529,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to catch cat fleas is difficult.

90
0:04:57.442,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:59.408,000 --> 0:05:,000
Why? Because they are jumpy.

92
0:05:01.269,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:03.466,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But now, it's actually enough to catch one.

94
0:05:08.653,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now we can extract its DNA

95
0:05:10.773,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and read how cat fleas make the resilin,

96
0:05:13.905,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and clone it into a less-jumpy organism like a plant.

97
0:05:19.669,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So that's exactly what we did.

98
0:05:21.378,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now we have the ability to produce lots of resilin.

99
0:05:25.348,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Well, my team decided to do something really cool at the university.

100
0:05:29.749,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They decided to combine

101
0:05:31.102,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the strongest material produced by the plant kingdom

102
0:05:34.348,000 --> 0:05:37,000
with the most elastic material produced by the insect kingdom --

103
0:05:38.902,000 --> 0:05:39,000
nanocellulose with resilin.

104
0:05:41.42,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And the result is amazing.

105
0:05:43.691,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This material, in fact, is tough, elastic and transparent.

106
0:05:50.181,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So there are lots of things that can be done with this material.

107
0:05:53.446,000 --> 0:05:55,000
For example, next-generation sport shoes,

108
0:05:55.62,000 --> 0:05:57,000
so we can jump higher, run faster.

109
0:05:58.8,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And even touch screens for computers and smartphones,

110
0:06:03.409,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that won't break.

111
0:06:04.807,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Well, the problem is, we continue to implant

112
0:06:08.815,000 --> 0:06:1,000
synthetic implants in our body,

113
0:06:10.927,000 --> 0:06:12,000
which we glue and screw into our body.

114
0:06:14.514,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And I'm going to say that this is not a good idea.

115
0:06:16.885,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Why? Because they fail.

116
0:06:19.103,000 --> 0:06:2,000
This synthetic material fails,

117
0:06:20.583,000 --> 0:06:22,000
just like this plastic fork,

118
0:06:23.465,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that is not strong enough for its performance.

119
0:06:26.483,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But sometimes they are too strong,

120
0:06:28.173,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and therefore their mechanical properties do not really fit

121
0:06:31.268,000 --> 0:06:32,000
their surrounding tissues.

122
0:06:33.671,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But in fact, the reason is much more fundamental.

123
0:06:36.81,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The reason is that in nature,

124
0:06:39.533,000 --> 0:06:4,000
there is no one there

125
0:06:41.436,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that actually takes my head and screws it onto my neck,

126
0:06:45.727,000 --> 0:06:47,000
or takes my skin and glues it onto my body.

127
0:06:49.413,000 --> 0:06:51,000
In nature, everything is self-assembled.

128
0:06:52.6,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So every living cell,

129
0:06:54.494,000 --> 0:06:58,000
whether coming from a plant, insect or human being,

130
0:06:59.152,000 --> 0:07:03,000
has a DNA that encodes for nanobio building blocks.

131
0:07:03.259,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Many times they are proteins.

132
0:07:05.318,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Other times, they are enzymes that make other materials,

133
0:07:08.973,000 --> 0:07:1,000
like polysaccharides, fatty acids.

134
0:07:11.783,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And the common feature about all these materials

135
0:07:15.189,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is that they need no one.

136
0:07:17.66,000 --> 0:07:19,000
They recognize each other and self-assemble

137
0:07:20.63,000 --> 0:07:24,000
into structures -- scaffolds on which cells are proliferating

138
0:07:25.553,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to give tissues.

139
0:07:27.017,000 --> 0:07:3,000
They develop into organs, and together bring life.

140
0:07:32.115,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So we at the Hebrew University, about 10 years ago, decided to focus

141
0:07:37.08,000 --> 0:07:41,000
on probably the most important biomaterial for humans,

142
0:07:42.998,000 --> 0:07:43,000
which is collagen.

143
0:07:45.142,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Why collagen?

144
0:07:46.356,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Because collagen accounts for about 25 percent of our dry weight.

145
0:07:50.094,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We have nothing more than collagen, other than water, in our body.

146
0:07:54.611,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So I always like to say,

147
0:07:56.608,000 --> 0:07:59,000
anyone who is in the replacement parts of human beings

148
0:07:59.727,000 --> 0:08:,000
would like to have collagen.

149
0:08:01.749,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Admittedly, before we started our project,

150
0:08:04.711,000 --> 0:08:07,000
there were already more than 1,000 medical implants

151
0:08:08.378,000 --> 0:08:09,000
made of collagen.

152
0:08:09.804,000 --> 0:08:12,000
You know, simple things like dermal fillers to reduce wrinkles,

153
0:08:13.684,000 --> 0:08:14,000
augment lips,

154
0:08:15.087,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and other, more sophisticated medical implants, like heart valves.

155
0:08:19.906,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So where is the problem?

156
0:08:22.076,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Well, the problem is the source.

157
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
The source of all that collagen

158
0:08:26.679,000 --> 0:08:28,000
is actually coming from dead bodies:

159
0:08:29.645,000 --> 0:08:31,000
dead pigs, dead cows

160
0:08:32.548,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and even human cadavers.

161
0:08:34.342,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So safety is a big issue.

162
0:08:37.701,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But it's not the only one.

163
0:08:39.709,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Also, the quality.

164
0:08:41.756,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now here, I have a personal interest.

165
0:08:44.415,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This is my father, Zvi, in our winery in Israel.

166
0:08:47.792,000 --> 0:08:5,000
A heart valve, very similar to the one that I showed you before,

167
0:08:51.668,000 --> 0:08:54,000
seven years ago, was implanted in his body.

168
0:08:55.941,000 --> 0:09:,000
Now, the scientific literature says that these heart valves start to fail

169
0:09:01.101,000 --> 0:09:03,000
10 years after the operation.

170
0:09:04.446,000 --> 0:09:05,000
No wonder:

171
0:09:06.295,000 --> 0:09:09,000
they are made from old, used tissues,

172
0:09:10.426,000 --> 0:09:13,000
just like this wall made of bricks that is falling apart.

173
0:09:14.778,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Yeah, of course, I can take those bricks and build a new wall.

174
0:09:18.749,000 --> 0:09:19,000
But it's not going to be the same.

175
0:09:20.67,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So the US Food and Drug Administration

176
0:09:25.14,000 --> 0:09:27,000
made a notice already in 2007,

177
0:09:27.838,000 --> 0:09:3,000
asking the companies to start to look for better alternatives.

178
0:09:32.291,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So that's exactly what we did.

179
0:09:34.892,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We decided to clone all the five human genes responsible

180
0:09:39.558,000 --> 0:09:42,000
for making type I collagen in humans

181
0:09:43.506,000 --> 0:09:46,000
into a transgenic tobacco plant.

182
0:09:47.462,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So now, the plant has the ability to make human collagen brand new,

183
0:09:53.248,000 --> 0:09:54,000
untouched.

184
0:09:54.428,000 --> 0:09:55,000
This is amazing.

185
0:09:56.409,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Actually, it's happening now.

186
0:09:58.899,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Today in Israel, we grow it in 25,000 square meters of greenhouses

187
0:10:04.039,000 --> 0:10:05,000
all over the country.

188
0:10:05.689,000 --> 0:10:07,000
The farmers receive small plantlets of tobacco.

189
0:10:08.541,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It looks exactly like regular tobacco,

190
0:10:10.896,000 --> 0:10:12,000
except that they have five human genes.

191
0:10:13.459,000 --> 0:10:15,000
They're responsible for making type I collagen.

192
0:10:16.691,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We grow them for about 50 to 70 days,

193
0:10:20.628,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we harvest the leaves,

194
0:10:22.54,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and then the leaves are transported by cooling trucks to the factory.

195
0:10:26.809,000 --> 0:10:29,000
There, the process of extracting the collagen starts.

196
0:10:30.555,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Now, if you ever made a pesto -- essentially, the same thing.

197
0:10:34.066,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Laughter)

198
0:10:36.198,000 --> 0:10:4,000
You crush the leaves, you get the juice that contains the collagen.

199
0:10:40.411,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We concentrate the protein,

200
0:10:42.329,000 --> 0:10:45,000
transfer the protein to clean rooms for the final purification,

201
0:10:45.62,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and the end result is a collagen identical to what we have in our body --

202
0:10:51.956,000 --> 0:10:52,000
untouched, brand new

203
0:10:54.201,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and from which we make different medical implants:

204
0:10:57.656,000 --> 0:10:59,000
bone void fillers, for example,

205
0:11:00.135,000 --> 0:11:04,000
for severe bone fractures, spinal fusion.

206
0:11:05.068,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And more recently, even,

207
0:11:06.657,000 --> 0:11:1,000
we've been able to launch into the market here in Europe

208
0:11:11.79,000 --> 0:11:14,000
a flowable gel that is used for diabetic foot ulcers,

209
0:11:15.651,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that is now approved for use in the clinic.

210
0:11:18.823,000 --> 0:11:19,000
This is not science fiction.

211
0:11:20.716,000 --> 0:11:21,000
This is happening now.

212
0:11:22.391,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We are using plants to make medical implants

213
0:11:26.961,000 --> 0:11:28,000
for replacement parts for human beings.

214
0:11:29.66,000 --> 0:11:33,000
In fact, more recently, we've been able to make collagen fibers

215
0:11:34.095,000 --> 0:11:37,000
which are six times stronger than the Achilles tendon.

216
0:11:37.796,000 --> 0:11:38,000
That's amazing.

217
0:11:39.141,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Together with our partners from Ireland,

218
0:11:42.047,000 --> 0:11:43,000
we thought about the next thing:

219
0:11:44.112,000 --> 0:11:46,000
adding resilin to those fibers.

220
0:11:47.311,000 --> 0:11:48,000
By doing that,

221
0:11:48.632,000 --> 0:11:5,000
we've been able to make a superfiber

222
0:11:51.454,000 --> 0:11:53,000
which is about 380 percent tougher,

223
0:11:54.775,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and 300 percent more elastic.

224
0:11:58.133,000 --> 0:12:,000
So oddly enough, in the future,

225
0:12:00.615,000 --> 0:12:04,000
when a patient is transplanted with artificial tendons or ligaments

226
0:12:05.599,000 --> 0:12:06,000
made from these fibers,

227
0:12:07.809,000 --> 0:12:1,000
we'll have better performance after the surgery

228
0:12:10.956,000 --> 0:12:11,000
than we had before the injury.

229
0:12:13.642,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So what's for the future?

230
0:12:15.391,000 --> 0:12:18,000
In the future, we believe we'll be able to make

231
0:12:18.416,000 --> 0:12:21,000
many nanobio building blocks that nature provided for us --

232
0:12:22.017,000 --> 0:12:25,000
collagen, nanocellulose, resilin and many more.

233
0:12:26.23,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And that will enable us to make better machines perform better,

234
0:12:30.097,000 --> 0:12:31,000
even the heart.

235
0:12:31.651,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Now, this heart is not going to be the same

236
0:12:34.121,000 --> 0:12:36,000
as we can get from a donor.

237
0:12:36.977,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It will be better.

238
0:12:38.834,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It actually will perform better

239
0:12:40.89,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and will last longer.

240
0:12:42.945,000 --> 0:12:44,000
My friend Zion Suliman once told me

241
0:12:45.414,000 --> 0:12:47,000
a smart sentence.

242
0:12:48.301,000 --> 0:12:51,000
He said, "If you want a new idea,

243
0:12:51.362,000 --> 0:12:52,000
you should open an old book."

244
0:12:53.431,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And I'm going to say that the book was written.

245
0:12:57.815,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It was written over three billion years

246
0:12:59.98,000 --> 0:13:,000
of evolution.

247
0:13:01.566,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And the text is the DNA of life.

248
0:13:05.923,000 --> 0:13:06,000
All we have to do

249
0:13:07.816,000 --> 0:13:08,000
is read this text,

250
0:13:10.156,000 --> 0:13:12,000
embrace nature's gift to us

251
0:13:12.737,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and start our progress from here.

252
0:13:15.252,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Thank you.

253
0:13:16.437,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:13.387,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Everything is covered in invisible ecosystems

3
0:00:17.106,000 --> 0:00:21,000
made of tiny lifeforms: bacteria, viruses and fungi.

4
0:00:21.594,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Our desks, our computers, our pencils, our buildings

5
0:00:25.698,000 --> 0:00:28,000
all harbor resident microbial landscapes.

6
0:00:29.154,000 --> 0:00:31,000
As we design these things, we could be thinking

7
0:00:31.914,000 --> 0:00:33,000
about designing these invisible worlds,

8
0:00:34.728,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and also thinking about how they interact

9
0:00:36.971,000 --> 0:00:38,000
with our personal ecosystems.

10
0:00:39.727,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Our bodies are home to trillions of microbes,

11
0:00:43.37,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and these creatures define who we are.

12
0:00:45.73,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The microbes in your gut can influence your weight and your moods.

13
0:00:49.608,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The microbes on your skin can help boost your immune system.

14
0:00:53.066,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The microbes in your mouth can freshen your breath,

15
0:00:56.075,000 --> 0:00:57,000
or not,

16
0:00:57.547,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and the key thing is that our personal ecosystems

17
0:01:00.526,000 --> 0:01:03,000
interact with ecosystems on everything we touch.

18
0:01:03.594,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So, for example, when you touch a pencil,

19
0:01:05.186,000 --> 0:01:07,000
microbial exchange happens.

20
0:01:08.018,000 --> 0:01:12,000
If we can design the invisible ecosystems in our surroundings,

21
0:01:12.914,000 --> 0:01:14,000
this opens a path to influencing

22
0:01:15.537,000 --> 0:01:18,000
our health in unprecedented ways.

23
0:01:18.928,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I get asked all of the time from people,

24
0:01:21.392,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"Is it possible to really design microbial ecosystems?"

25
0:01:25.462,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And I believe the answer is yes.

26
0:01:28.01,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I think we're doing it right now,

27
0:01:29.935,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but we're doing it unconsciously.

28
0:01:33.043,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'm going to share data with you

29
0:01:35.008,000 --> 0:01:38,000
from one aspect of my research focused on architecture

30
0:01:38.736,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that demonstrates how, through both conscious

31
0:01:41.862,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and unconscious design,

32
0:01:44.072,000 --> 0:01:47,000
we're impacting these invisible worlds.

33
0:01:47.081,000 --> 0:01:51,000
This is the Lillis Business Complex at the University of Oregon,

34
0:01:51.31,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and I worked with a team of architects and biologists

35
0:01:53.994,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to sample over 300 rooms in this building.

36
0:01:58.168,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We wanted to get something like a fossil record of the building,

37
0:02:02.178,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and to do this, we sampled dust.

38
0:02:05.488,000 --> 0:02:08,000
From the dust, we pulled out bacterial cells,

39
0:02:09.396,000 --> 0:02:12,000
broke them open, and compared their gene sequences.

40
0:02:12.8,000 --> 0:02:13,000
This means that people in my group

41
0:02:14.527,000 --> 0:02:17,000
were doing a lot of vacuuming during this project.

42
0:02:17.84,000 --> 0:02:19,000
This is a picture of Tim, who,

43
0:02:20.36,000 --> 0:02:22,000
right when I snapped this picture, reminded me,

44
0:02:22.814,000 --> 0:02:24,000
he said, "Jessica, the last lab group I worked in

45
0:02:25.384,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I was doing fieldwork in the Costa Rican rainforest,

46
0:02:28.355,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and things have changed dramatically for me."

47
0:02:32.112,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So I'm going to show you now first what we found in the offices,

48
0:02:35.864,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and we're going to look at the data through a visualization tool

49
0:02:38.94,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that I've been working on in partnership with Autodesk.

50
0:02:42.48,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The way that you look at this data is,

51
0:02:44.952,000 --> 0:02:47,000
first, look around the outside of the circle.

52
0:02:48.53,000 --> 0:02:51,000
You'll see broad bacterial groups,

53
0:02:51.552,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and if you look at the shape of this pink lobe,

54
0:02:54.392,000 --> 0:02:57,000
it tells you something about the relative abundance of each group.

55
0:02:57.408,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So at 12 o'clock, you'll see that offices have a lot of

56
0:02:59.904,000 --> 0:03:01,000
alphaproteobacteria, and at one o'clock

57
0:03:02.465,000 --> 0:03:06,000
you'll see that bacilli are relatively rare.

58
0:03:06.66,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Let's take a look at what's going on in different space types in this building.

59
0:03:11.023,000 --> 0:03:13,000
If you look inside the restrooms,

60
0:03:13.045,000 --> 0:03:16,000
they all have really similar ecosystems,

61
0:03:16.175,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and if you were to look inside the classrooms,

62
0:03:18.503,000 --> 0:03:2,000
those also have similar ecosystems.

63
0:03:21.369,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But if you look across these space types,

64
0:03:23.783,000 --> 0:03:25,000
you can see that they're fundamentally different

65
0:03:26.18,000 --> 0:03:28,000
from one another.

66
0:03:28.335,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I like to think of bathrooms like a tropical rainforest.

67
0:03:31.328,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I told Tim, "If you could just see the microbes,

68
0:03:33.815,000 --> 0:03:37,000
it's kind of like being in Costa Rica. Kind of."

69
0:03:37.854,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I also like to think of offices as being a temperate grassland.

70
0:03:42.377,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This perspective is a really powerful one for designers,

71
0:03:46.589,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because you can bring on principles of ecology,

72
0:03:50.016,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and a really important principle of ecology is dispersal,

73
0:03:52.928,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the way organisms move around.

74
0:03:55.655,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We know that microbes are dispersed around by people

75
0:03:59.839,000 --> 0:04:,000
and by air.

76
0:04:00.91,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So the very first thing we wanted to do in this building

77
0:04:03.747,000 --> 0:04:04,000
was look at the air system.

78
0:04:05.6,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Mechanical engineers design air handling units

79
0:04:08.832,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to make sure that people are comfortable,

80
0:04:11.024,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that the air flow and temperature is just right.

81
0:04:13.577,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They do this using principles of physics and chemistry,

82
0:04:17.121,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but they could also be using biology.

83
0:04:21.495,000 --> 0:04:23,000
If you look at the microbes

84
0:04:23.607,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in one of the air handling units in this building,

85
0:04:26.657,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you'll see that they're all very similar to one another.

86
0:04:30.648,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And if you compare this to the microbes

87
0:04:34.183,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in a different air handling unit,

88
0:04:36.327,000 --> 0:04:38,000
you'll see that they're fundamentally different.

89
0:04:39.039,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The rooms in this building are like islands in an archipelago,

90
0:04:42.59,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and what that means is that mechanical engineers

91
0:04:45.447,000 --> 0:04:47,000
are like eco-engineers, and they have the ability

92
0:04:48.123,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to structure biomes in this building the way that they want to.

93
0:04:53.707,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Another facet of how microbes get around is by people,

94
0:04:57.815,000 --> 0:05:,000
and designers often cluster rooms together

95
0:05:00.982,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to facilitate interactions among people,

96
0:05:03.037,000 --> 0:05:06,000
or the sharing of ideas, like in labs and in offices.

97
0:05:06.509,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Given that microbes travel around with people,

98
0:05:09.183,000 --> 0:05:11,000
you might expect to see rooms that are close together

99
0:05:11.856,000 --> 0:05:13,000
have really similar biomes.

100
0:05:14.111,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And that is exactly what we found.

101
0:05:16.591,000 --> 0:05:19,000
If you look at classrooms right adjacent to one another,

102
0:05:19.758,000 --> 0:05:21,000
they have very similar ecosystems,

103
0:05:21.957,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but if you go to an office

104
0:05:25.096,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that is a farther walking distance away,

105
0:05:28.144,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the ecosystem is fundamentally different.

106
0:05:30.88,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And when I see the power that dispersal has

107
0:05:35.425,000 --> 0:05:37,000
on these biogeographic patterns,

108
0:05:37.705,000 --> 0:05:39,000
it makes me think that it's possible

109
0:05:40.264,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to tackle really challenging problems,

110
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
like hospital-acquired infections.

111
0:05:46.461,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I believe this has got to be, in part,

112
0:05:49.067,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a building ecology problem.

113
0:05:52.71,000 --> 0:05:55,000
All right, I'm going to tell you one more story about this building.

114
0:05:56.502,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I am collaborating with Charlie Brown.

115
0:05:59.967,000 --> 0:06:,000
He's an architect,

116
0:06:01.508,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and Charlie is deeply concerned about global climate change.

117
0:06:06.841,000 --> 0:06:08,000
He's dedicated his life to sustainable design.

118
0:06:09.785,000 --> 0:06:12,000
When he met me and realized that it was possible for him

119
0:06:12.881,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to study in a quantitative way

120
0:06:15.057,000 --> 0:06:17,000
how his design choices impacted

121
0:06:17.633,000 --> 0:06:19,000
the ecology and biology of this building,

122
0:06:20.593,000 --> 0:06:24,000
he got really excited, because it added a new dimension to what he did.

123
0:06:25.102,000 --> 0:06:26,000
He went from thinking just about energy

124
0:06:26.97,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to also starting to think about human health.

125
0:06:30.458,000 --> 0:06:33,000
He helped design some of the air handling systems

126
0:06:34.319,000 --> 0:06:36,000
in this building and the way it was ventilated.

127
0:06:36.513,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So what I'm first going to show you is

128
0:06:39.235,000 --> 0:06:42,000
air that we sampled outside of the building.

129
0:06:42.794,000 --> 0:06:46,000
What you're looking at is a signature of bacterial communities

130
0:06:46.961,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in the outdoor air, and how they vary over time.

131
0:06:50.937,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Next I'm going to show you what happened

132
0:06:53.925,000 --> 0:06:56,000
when we experimentally manipulated classrooms.

133
0:06:57.574,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We blocked them off at night

134
0:06:59.189,000 --> 0:07:01,000
so that they got no ventilation.

135
0:07:01.455,000 --> 0:07:03,000
A lot of buildings are operated this way,

136
0:07:03.632,000 --> 0:07:04,000
probably where you work,

137
0:07:05.383,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and companies do this to save money on their energy bill.

138
0:07:08.354,000 --> 0:07:11,000
What we found is that these rooms remained relatively stagnant

139
0:07:12.281,000 --> 0:07:15,000
until Saturday, when we opened the vents up again.

140
0:07:15.34,000 --> 0:07:16,000
When you walked into those rooms,

141
0:07:16.922,000 --> 0:07:17,000
they smelled really bad,

142
0:07:18.897,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and our data suggests that it had something to do with

143
0:07:21.999,000 --> 0:07:24,000
leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup

144
0:07:25.066,000 --> 0:07:27,000
from people the day before.

145
0:07:27.745,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Contrast this to rooms

146
0:07:29.917,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that were designed using a sustainable passive design strategy

147
0:07:34.198,000 --> 0:07:37,000
where air came in from the outside through louvers.

148
0:07:37.978,000 --> 0:07:41,000
In these rooms, the air tracked the outdoor air relatively well,

149
0:07:42.775,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and when Charlie saw this, he got really excited.

150
0:07:44.91,000 --> 0:07:46,000
He felt like he had made a good choice

151
0:07:47.021,000 --> 0:07:48,000
with the design process

152
0:07:48.755,000 --> 0:07:5,000
because it was both energy efficient

153
0:07:51.15,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and it washed away the building's resident microbial landscape.

154
0:07:56.439,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The examples that I just gave you are about architecture,

155
0:07:59.481,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but they're relevant to the design of anything.

156
0:08:01.994,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Imagine designing with the kinds of microbes that we want

157
0:08:06.164,000 --> 0:08:07,000
in a plane

158
0:08:07.582,000 --> 0:08:09,000
or on a phone.

159
0:08:10.515,000 --> 0:08:12,000
There's a new microbe, I just discovered it.

160
0:08:12.969,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's called BLIS, and it's been shown

161
0:08:15.849,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to both ward off pathogens

162
0:08:18.033,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and give you good breath.

163
0:08:20.178,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Wouldn't it be awesome if we all had BLIS on our phones?

164
0:08:26.197,000 --> 0:08:28,000
A conscious approach to design,

165
0:08:28.567,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I'm calling it bioinformed design,

166
0:08:31.448,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and I think it's possible.

167
0:08:32.934,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Thank you.

168
0:08:34.372,000 --> 0:08:37,000

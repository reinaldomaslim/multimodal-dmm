1
0:00:12.85,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So, has everybody heard of CRISPR?

2
0:00:15.883,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I would be shocked if you hadn't.

3
0:00:18.509,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This is a technology -- it's for genome editing --

4
0:00:21.735,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and it's so versatile and so controversial

5
0:00:24.593,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that it's sparking all sorts of really interesting conversations.

6
0:00:28.631,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Should we bring back the woolly mammoth?

7
0:00:31.281,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Should we edit a human embryo?

8
0:00:34.041,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And my personal favorite:

9
0:00:36.997,000 --> 0:00:39,000
How can we justify wiping out an entire species

10
0:00:40.672,000 --> 0:00:42,000
that we consider harmful to humans

11
0:00:43.14,000 --> 0:00:44,000
off the face of the Earth,

12
0:00:44.466,000 --> 0:00:45,000
using this technology?

13
0:00:47.165,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This type of science is moving much faster

14
0:00:50.472,000 --> 0:00:52,000
than the regulatory mechanisms that govern it.

15
0:00:53.34,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And so, for the past six years,

16
0:00:55.431,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I've made it my personal mission

17
0:00:57.863,000 --> 0:01:,000
to make sure that as many people as possible understand

18
0:01:00.897,000 --> 0:01:03,000
these types of technologies and their implications.

19
0:01:04.021,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, CRISPR has been the subject of a huge media hype,

20
0:01:09.089,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and the words that are used most often are "easy" and "cheap."

21
0:01:14.337,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So what I want to do is drill down a little bit deeper

22
0:01:17.5,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and look into some of the myths and the realities around CRISPR.

23
0:01:22.954,000 --> 0:01:23,000
If you're trying to CRISPR a genome,

24
0:01:25.594,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the first thing that you have to do is damage the DNA.

25
0:01:29.098,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The damage comes in the form of a double-strand break

26
0:01:32.164,000 --> 0:01:33,000
through the double helix.

27
0:01:33.752,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And then the cellular repair processes kick in,

28
0:01:37.088,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and then we convince those repair processes

29
0:01:39.751,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to make the edit that we want,

30
0:01:42.054,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and not a natural edit.

31
0:01:43.62,000 --> 0:01:44,000
That's how it works.

32
0:01:45.929,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It's a two-part system.

33
0:01:47.676,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You've got a Cas9 protein and something called a guide RNA.

34
0:01:51.071,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I like to think of it as a guided missile.

35
0:01:53.557,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So the Cas9 -- I love to anthropomorphize --

36
0:01:56.227,000 --> 0:01:59,000
so the Cas9 is kind of this Pac-Man thing

37
0:01:59.481,000 --> 0:02:,000
that wants to chew DNA,

38
0:02:01.05,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and the guide RNA is the leash that's keeping it out of the genome

39
0:02:05.23,000 --> 0:02:07,000
until it finds the exact spot where it matches.

40
0:02:08.912,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And the combination of those two is called CRISPR.

41
0:02:11.83,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It's a system that we stole

42
0:02:13.422,000 --> 0:02:15,000
from an ancient, ancient bacterial immune system.

43
0:02:17.469,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The part that's amazing about it is that the guide RNA,

44
0:02:22.041,000 --> 0:02:23,000
only 20 letters of it,

45
0:02:23.956,000 --> 0:02:24,000
are what target the system.

46
0:02:26.57,000 --> 0:02:28,000
This is really easy to design,

47
0:02:28.737,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and it's really cheap to buy.

48
0:02:30.985,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So that's the part that is modular in the system;

49
0:02:35.014,000 --> 0:02:36,000
everything else stays the same.

50
0:02:37.481,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This makes it a remarkably easy and powerful system to use.

51
0:02:42.047,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The guide RNA and the Cas9 protein complex together

52
0:02:46.311,000 --> 0:02:47,000
go bouncing along the genome,

53
0:02:48.267,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and when they find a spot where the guide RNA matches,

54
0:02:51.784,000 --> 0:02:53,000
then it inserts between the two strands of the double helix,

55
0:02:54.663,000 --> 0:02:55,000
it rips them apart,

56
0:02:56.692,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that triggers the Cas9 protein to cut,

57
0:02:59.962,000 --> 0:03:,000
and all of a sudden,

58
0:03:01.816,000 --> 0:03:02,000
you've got a cell that's in total panic

59
0:03:03.74,000 --> 0:03:05,000
because now it's got a piece of DNA that's broken.

60
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:08,000
What does it do?

61
0:03:08.32,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It calls its first responders.

62
0:03:10.959,000 --> 0:03:12,000
There are two major repair pathways.

63
0:03:13.605,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The first just takes the DNA and shoves the two pieces back together.

64
0:03:18.698,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This isn't a very efficient system,

65
0:03:20.82,000 --> 0:03:22,000
because what happens is sometimes a base drops out

66
0:03:23.573,000 --> 0:03:24,000
or a base is added.

67
0:03:25.024,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It's an OK way to maybe, like, knock out a gene,

68
0:03:28.841,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but it's not the way that we really want to do genome editing.

69
0:03:32.098,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The second repair pathway is a lot more interesting.

70
0:03:35.017,000 --> 0:03:36,000
In this repair pathway,

71
0:03:36.677,000 --> 0:03:38,000
it takes a homologous piece of DNA.

72
0:03:39.382,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And now mind you, in a diploid organism like people,

73
0:03:42.046,000 --> 0:03:46,000
we've got one copy of our genome from our mom and one from our dad,

74
0:03:46.318,000 --> 0:03:47,000
so if one gets damaged,

75
0:03:47.617,000 --> 0:03:49,000
it can use the other chromosome to repair it.

76
0:03:50.036,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So that's where this comes from.

77
0:03:52.518,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The repair is made,

78
0:03:54.006,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and now the genome is safe again.

79
0:03:56.616,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The way that we can hijack this

80
0:03:58.497,000 --> 0:04:01,000
is we can feed it a false piece of DNA,

81
0:04:02.229,000 --> 0:04:04,000
a piece that has homology on both ends

82
0:04:04.397,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but is different in the middle.

83
0:04:06.12,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So now, you can put whatever you want in the center

84
0:04:08.611,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and the cell gets fooled.

85
0:04:10.15,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So you can change a letter,

86
0:04:12.293,000 --> 0:04:13,000
you can take letters out,

87
0:04:13.582,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but most importantly, you can stuff new DNA in,

88
0:04:16.53,000 --> 0:04:17,000
kind of like a Trojan horse.

89
0:04:19.089,000 --> 0:04:21,000
CRISPR is going to be amazing,

90
0:04:21.298,000 --> 0:04:24,000
in terms of the number of different scientific advances

91
0:04:24.94,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that it's going to catalyze.

92
0:04:26.621,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The thing that's special about it is this modular targeting system.

93
0:04:29.866,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I mean, we've been shoving DNA into organisms for years, right?

94
0:04:33.657,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But because of the modular targeting system,

95
0:04:35.808,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we can actually put it exactly where we want it.

96
0:04:39.423,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The thing is that there's a lot of talk about it being cheap

97
0:04:45.116,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and it being easy.

98
0:04:46.882,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And I run a community lab.

99
0:04:50.242,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I'm starting to get emails from people that say stuff like,

100
0:04:53.822,000 --> 0:04:55,000
"Hey, can I come to your open night

101
0:04:56.243,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and, like, maybe use CRISPR and engineer my genome?"

102
0:04:59.884,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laugher)

103
0:05:01.018,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Like, seriously.

104
0:05:03.376,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I'm, "No, you can't."

105
0:05:05.203,000 --> 0:05:06,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:06.237,000 --> 0:05:08,000
"But I've heard it's cheap. I've heard it's easy."

107
0:05:08.616,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We're going to explore that a little bit.

108
0:05:10.823,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So, how cheap is it?

109
0:05:12.796,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Yeah, it is cheap in comparison.

110
0:05:15.665,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It's going to take the cost of the average materials for an experiment

111
0:05:19.308,000 --> 0:05:21,000
from thousands of dollars to hundreds of dollars,

112
0:05:21.864,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and it cuts the time a lot, too.

113
0:05:23.824,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It can cut it from weeks to days.

114
0:05:26.246,000 --> 0:05:27,000
That's great.

115
0:05:27.762,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You still need a professional lab to do the work in;

116
0:05:30.476,000 --> 0:05:33,000
you're not going to do anything meaningful outside of a professional lab.

117
0:05:34.012,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I mean, don't listen to anyone who says

118
0:05:36.04,000 --> 0:05:38,000
you can do this sort of stuff on your kitchen table.

119
0:05:39.421,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It's really not easy to do this kind of work.

120
0:05:43.953,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Not to mention, there's a patent battle going on,

121
0:05:46.285,000 --> 0:05:47,000
so even if you do invent something,

122
0:05:48.135,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the Broad Institute and UC Berkeley are in this incredible patent battle.

123
0:05:54.795,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It's really fascinating to watch it happen,

124
0:05:57.207,000 --> 0:06:,000
because they're accusing each other of fraudulent claims

125
0:06:00.479,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and then they've got people saying,

126
0:06:02.234,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"Oh, well, I signed my notebook here or there."

127
0:06:05.042,000 --> 0:06:07,000
This isn't going to be settled for years.

128
0:06:07.167,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And when it is,

129
0:06:08.351,000 --> 0:06:11,000
you can bet you're going to pay someone a really hefty licensing fee

130
0:06:11.66,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in order to use this stuff.

131
0:06:13.343,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So, is it really cheap?

132
0:06:15.148,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Well, it's cheap if you're doing basic research and you've got a lab.

133
0:06:21.22,000 --> 0:06:23,000
How about easy? Let's look at that claim.

134
0:06:24.417,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The devil is always in the details.

135
0:06:27.881,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We don't really know that much about cells.

136
0:06:31.036,000 --> 0:06:32,000
They're still kind of black boxes.

137
0:06:32.73,000 --> 0:06:36,000
For example, we don't know why some guide RNAs work really well

138
0:06:37.614,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and some guide RNAs don't.

139
0:06:39.701,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We don't know why some cells want to do one repair pathway

140
0:06:43.193,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and some cells would rather do the other.

141
0:06:46.27,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And besides that,

142
0:06:47.578,000 --> 0:06:49,000
there's the whole problem of getting the system into the cell

143
0:06:50.471,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in the first place.

144
0:06:51.759,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In a petri dish, that's not that hard,

145
0:06:53.785,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but if you're trying to do it on a whole organism,

146
0:06:56.254,000 --> 0:06:57,000
it gets really tricky.

147
0:06:58.224,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It's OK if you use something like blood or bone marrow --

148
0:07:01.434,000 --> 0:07:03,000
those are the targets of a lot of research now.

149
0:07:03.685,000 --> 0:07:05,000
There was a great story of some little girl

150
0:07:05.96,000 --> 0:07:06,000
who they saved from leukemia

151
0:07:07.636,000 --> 0:07:09,000
by taking the blood out, editing it, and putting it back

152
0:07:10.334,000 --> 0:07:12,000
with a precursor of CRISPR.

153
0:07:12.869,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And this is a line of research that people are going to do.

154
0:07:15.689,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But right now, if you want to get into the whole body,

155
0:07:18.266,000 --> 0:07:2,000
you're probably going to have to use a virus.

156
0:07:20.434,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So you take the virus, you put the CRISPR into it,

157
0:07:22.831,000 --> 0:07:23,000
you let the virus infect the cell.

158
0:07:24.561,000 --> 0:07:26,000
But now you've got this virus in there,

159
0:07:26.728,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and we don't know what the long-term effects of that are.

160
0:07:29.44,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Plus, CRISPR has some off-target effects,

161
0:07:31.732,000 --> 0:07:33,000
a very small percentage, but they're still there.

162
0:07:34.717,000 --> 0:07:36,000
What's going to happen over time with that?

163
0:07:38.039,000 --> 0:07:4,000
These are not trivial questions,

164
0:07:40.275,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and there are scientists that are trying to solve them,

165
0:07:42.939,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and they will eventually, hopefully, be solved.

166
0:07:45.249,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But it ain't plug-and-play, not by a long shot.

167
0:07:48.907,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So: Is it really easy?

168
0:07:51.032,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Well, if you spend a few years working it out in your particular system,

169
0:07:55.389,000 --> 0:07:56,000
yes, it is.

170
0:07:57.426,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Now the other thing is,

171
0:07:59.534,000 --> 0:08:05,000
we don't really know that much about how to make a particular thing happen

172
0:08:05.917,000 --> 0:08:07,000
by changing particular spots in the genome.

173
0:08:09.306,000 --> 0:08:11,000
We're a long way away from figuring out

174
0:08:11.497,000 --> 0:08:13,000
how to give a pig wings, for example.

175
0:08:14.364,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Or even an extra leg -- I'd settle for an extra leg.

176
0:08:17.252,000 --> 0:08:18,000
That would be kind of cool, right?

177
0:08:18.922,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But what is happening

178
0:08:20.482,000 --> 0:08:24,000
is that CRISPR is being used by thousands and thousands of scientists

179
0:08:24.856,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to do really, really important work,

180
0:08:27.252,000 --> 0:08:32,000
like making better models of diseases in animals, for example,

181
0:08:32.72,000 --> 0:08:36,000
or for taking pathways that produce valuable chemicals

182
0:08:37.726,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and getting them into industrial production in fermentation vats,

183
0:08:42.021,000 --> 0:08:45,000
or even doing really basic research on what genes do.

184
0:08:46.022,000 --> 0:08:48,000
This is the story of CRISPR we should be telling,

185
0:08:48.975,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and I don't like it that the flashier aspects of it

186
0:08:52.463,000 --> 0:08:53,000
are drowning all of this out.

187
0:08:54.243,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Lots of scientists did a lot of work to make CRISPR happen,

188
0:08:58.841,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and what's interesting to me

189
0:09:00.484,000 --> 0:09:04,000
is that these scientists are being supported by our society.

190
0:09:05.423,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Think about it.

191
0:09:06.606,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We've got an infrastructure that allows a certain percentage of people

192
0:09:10.983,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to spend all their time doing research.

193
0:09:14.984,000 --> 0:09:17,000
That makes us all the inventors of CRISPR,

194
0:09:18.998,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and I would say that makes us all the shepherds of CRISPR.

195
0:09:23.49,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We all have a responsibility.

196
0:09:25.749,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So I would urge you to really learn about these types of technologies,

197
0:09:30.01,000 --> 0:09:32,000
because, really, only in that way

198
0:09:32.415,000 --> 0:09:36,000
are we going to be able to guide the development of these technologies,

199
0:09:36.791,000 --> 0:09:37,000
the use of these technologies

200
0:09:38.747,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and make sure that, in the end, it's a positive outcome --

201
0:09:43.034,000 --> 0:09:46,000
for both the planet and for us.

202
0:09:46.698,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Thanks.

203
0:09:47.914,000 --> 0:09:5,000

1
0:00:13.999,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Well, we all need a reason to wake up.

2
0:00:18.898,000 --> 0:00:2,000
For me, it just took 11,000 volts.

3
0:00:23.068,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I know you're too polite to ask,

4
0:00:24.766,000 --> 0:00:25,000
so I will tell you.

5
0:00:27.354,000 --> 0:00:29,000
One night, sophomore year of college,

6
0:00:29.601,000 --> 0:00:32,000
just back from Thanksgiving holiday,

7
0:00:33.323,000 --> 0:00:35,000
a few of my friends and I were horsing around,

8
0:00:35.999,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and we decided to climb atop a parked commuter train.

9
0:00:40.167,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It was just sitting there, with the wires that run overhead.

10
0:00:43.305,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Somehow, that seemed like a great idea at the time.

11
0:00:46.804,000 --> 0:00:48,000
We'd certainly done stupider things.

12
0:00:50.27,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I scurried up the ladder on the back,

13
0:00:53.315,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and when I stood up,

14
0:00:55.061,000 --> 0:00:58,000
the electrical current entered my arm,

15
0:00:58.667,000 --> 0:01:,000
blew down and out my feet, and that was that.

16
0:01:03.699,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Would you believe that watch still works?

17
0:01:08.216,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Takes a licking!

18
0:01:09.447,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:10.502,000 --> 0:01:12,000
My father wears it now in solidarity.

20
0:01:15.295,000 --> 0:01:21,000
That night began my formal relationship with death -- my death --

21
0:01:21.342,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and it also began my long run as a patient.

22
0:01:25.174,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It's a good word.

23
0:01:26.352,000 --> 0:01:27,000
It means one who suffers.

24
0:01:28.825,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So I guess we're all patients.

25
0:01:31.607,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Now, the American health care system

26
0:01:33.997,000 --> 0:01:36,000
has more than its fair share of dysfunction --

27
0:01:37.142,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to match its brilliance, to be sure.

28
0:01:39.75,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I'm a physician now, a hospice and palliative medicine doc,

29
0:01:44.226,000 --> 0:01:46,000
so I've seen care from both sides.

30
0:01:47.076,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And believe me: almost everyone who goes into healthcare

31
0:01:50.999,000 --> 0:01:53,000
really means well -- I mean, truly.

32
0:01:54.874,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But we who work in it are also unwitting agents

33
0:01:58.831,000 --> 0:02:02,000
for a system that too often does not serve.

34
0:02:03.999,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Why?

35
0:02:05.624,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Well, there's actually a pretty easy answer to that question,

36
0:02:09.029,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and it explains a lot:

37
0:02:11.301,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because healthcare was designed with diseases, not people, at its center.

38
0:02:18.419,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Which is to say, of course, it was badly designed.

39
0:02:22.158,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And nowhere are the effects of bad design more heartbreaking

40
0:02:28.234,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or the opportunity for good design more compelling

41
0:02:31.593,000 --> 0:02:33,000
than at the end of life,

42
0:02:33.758,000 --> 0:02:36,000
where things are so distilled and concentrated.

43
0:02:38.234,000 --> 0:02:39,000
There are no do-overs.

44
0:02:42.073,000 --> 0:02:46,000
My purpose today is to reach out across disciplines

45
0:02:46.588,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and invite design thinking into this big conversation.

46
0:02:51.495,000 --> 0:02:56,000
That is, to bring intention and creativity

47
0:02:56.876,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to the experience of dying.

48
0:03:01.235,000 --> 0:03:05,000
We have a monumental opportunity in front of us,

49
0:03:05.292,000 --> 0:03:09,000
before one of the few universal issues

50
0:03:09.657,000 --> 0:03:12,000
as individuals as well as a civil society:

51
0:03:12.991,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to rethink and redesign how it is we die.

52
0:03:19.489,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So let's begin at the end.

53
0:03:23.611,000 --> 0:03:26,000
For most people, the scariest thing about death isn't being dead,

54
0:03:27.57,000 --> 0:03:28,000
it's dying, suffering.

55
0:03:29.809,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It's a key distinction.

56
0:03:32.461,000 --> 0:03:34,000
To get underneath this, it can be very helpful

57
0:03:34.653,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to tease out suffering which is necessary as it is,

58
0:03:39.031,000 --> 0:03:41,000
from suffering we can change.

59
0:03:42.317,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The former is a natural, essential part of life, part of the deal,

60
0:03:47.577,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and to this we are called to make space, adjust, grow.

61
0:03:55.013,000 --> 0:04:,000
It can be really good to realize forces larger than ourselves.

62
0:04:01.098,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They bring proportionality,

63
0:04:04.246,000 --> 0:04:06,000
like a cosmic right-sizing.

64
0:04:08.779,000 --> 0:04:1,000
After my limbs were gone,

65
0:04:11.237,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that loss, for example, became fact, fixed --

66
0:04:15.847,000 --> 0:04:18,000
necessarily part of my life,

67
0:04:19.184,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and I learned that I could no more reject this fact than reject myself.

68
0:04:27.173,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It took me a while, but I learned it eventually.

69
0:04:30.572,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, another great thing about necessary suffering

70
0:04:33.04,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is that it is the very thing

71
0:04:36.572,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that unites caregiver and care receiver --

72
0:04:41.999,000 --> 0:04:42,000
human beings.

73
0:04:45.089,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This, we are finally realizing, is where healing happens.

74
0:04:49.673,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Yes, compassion -- literally, as we learned yesterday --

75
0:04:53.217,000 --> 0:04:54,000
suffering together.

76
0:04:56.672,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Now, on the systems side, on the other hand,

77
0:05:00.034,000 --> 0:05:03,000
so much of the suffering is unnecessary, invented.

78
0:05:04.376,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It serves no good purpose.

79
0:05:06.674,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But the good news is, since this brand of suffering is made up,

80
0:05:10.999,000 --> 0:05:11,000
well, we can change it.

81
0:05:13.681,000 --> 0:05:15,000
How we die is indeed something we can affect.

82
0:05:18.446,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Making the system sensitive to this fundamental distinction

83
0:05:22.523,000 --> 0:05:25,000
between necessary and unnecessary suffering

84
0:05:25.999,000 --> 0:05:28,000
gives us our first of three design cues for the day.

85
0:05:30.299,000 --> 0:05:34,000
After all, our role as caregivers, as people who care,

86
0:05:34.852,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is to relieve suffering -- not add to the pile.

87
0:05:42.292,000 --> 0:05:43,000
True to the tenets of palliative care,

88
0:05:44.187,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I function as something of a reflective advocate,

89
0:05:47.884,000 --> 0:05:49,000
as much as prescribing physician.

90
0:05:51.177,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Quick aside: palliative care -- a very important field but poorly understood --

91
0:05:57.222,000 --> 0:05:59,000
while it includes, it is not limited to end of life care.

92
0:06:00.2,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It is not limited to hospice.

93
0:06:02.811,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It's simply about comfort and living well at any stage.

94
0:06:06.999,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So please know that you don't have to be dying anytime soon

95
0:06:10.062,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to benefit from palliative care.

96
0:06:13.45,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now, let me introduce you to Frank.

97
0:06:17.768,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Sort of makes this point.

98
0:06:19.007,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I've been seeing Frank now for years.

99
0:06:21.061,000 --> 0:06:25,000
He's living with advancing prostate cancer on top of long-standing HIV.

100
0:06:26.197,000 --> 0:06:27,000
We work on his bone pain and his fatigue,

101
0:06:28.207,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but most of the time we spend thinking out loud together about his life --

102
0:06:32.945,000 --> 0:06:33,000
really, about our lives.

103
0:06:35.071,000 --> 0:06:36,000
In this way, Frank grieves.

104
0:06:37.207,000 --> 0:06:4,000
In this way, he keeps up with his losses as they roll in,

105
0:06:41.01,000 --> 0:06:44,000
so that he's ready to take in the next moment.

106
0:06:45.524,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Loss is one thing, but regret, quite another.

107
0:06:51.243,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Frank has always been an adventurer --

108
0:06:53.224,000 --> 0:06:55,000
he looks like something out of a Norman Rockwell painting --

109
0:06:56.089,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and no fan of regret.

110
0:06:58.566,000 --> 0:07:,000
So it wasn't surprising when he came into clinic one day,

111
0:07:01.271,000 --> 0:07:03,000
saying he wanted to raft down the Colorado River.

112
0:07:05.142,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Was this a good idea?

113
0:07:07.268,000 --> 0:07:11,000
With all the risks to his safety and his health, some would say no.

114
0:07:11.496,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Many did, but he went for it, while he still could.

115
0:07:15.999,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It was a glorious, marvelous trip:

116
0:07:20.928,000 --> 0:07:25,000
freezing water, blistering dry heat, scorpions, snakes,

117
0:07:26.274,000 --> 0:07:31,000
wildlife howling off the flaming walls of the Grand Canyon --

118
0:07:31.729,000 --> 0:07:34,000
all the glorious side of the world beyond our control.

119
0:07:36.492,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Frank's decision, while maybe dramatic,

120
0:07:38.406,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is exactly the kind so many of us would make,

121
0:07:40.717,000 --> 0:07:46,000
if we only had the support to figure out what is best for ourselves over time.

122
0:07:49.291,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So much of what we're talking about today is a shift in perspective.

123
0:07:54.723,000 --> 0:07:56,000
After my accident, when I went back to college,

124
0:07:56.999,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I changed my major to art history.

125
0:08:00.095,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Studying visual art, I figured I'd learn something about how to see --

126
0:08:05.705,000 --> 0:08:08,000
a really potent lesson for a kid who couldn't change

127
0:08:09.103,000 --> 0:08:11,000
so much of what he was seeing.

128
0:08:12.602,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Perspective, that kind of alchemy we humans get to play with,

129
0:08:16.364,000 --> 0:08:18,000
turning anguish into a flower.

130
0:08:21.999,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Flash forward: now I work at an amazing place in San Francisco

131
0:08:25.815,000 --> 0:08:27,000
called the Zen Hospice Project,

132
0:08:28.078,000 --> 0:08:31,000
where we have a little ritual that helps with this shift in perspective.

133
0:08:32.405,000 --> 0:08:35,000
When one of our residents dies,

134
0:08:35.49,000 --> 0:08:39,000
the mortuary men come, and as we're wheeling the body out through the garden,

135
0:08:39.984,000 --> 0:08:41,000
heading for the gate, we pause.

136
0:08:42.038,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Anyone who wants --

137
0:08:44.247,000 --> 0:08:46,000
fellow residents, family, nurses, volunteers,

138
0:08:46.995,000 --> 0:08:48,000
the hearse drivers too, now --

139
0:08:49.463,000 --> 0:08:53,000
shares a story or a song or silence,

140
0:08:53.914,000 --> 0:08:55,000
as we sprinkle the body with flower petals.

141
0:08:57.282,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It takes a few minutes;

142
0:08:59.61,000 --> 0:09:04,000
it's a sweet, simple parting image to usher in grief with warmth,

143
0:09:04.999,000 --> 0:09:05,000
rather than repugnance.

144
0:09:08.06,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Contrast that with the typical experience in the hospital setting,

145
0:09:13.13,000 --> 0:09:17,000
much like this -- floodlit room lined with tubes and beeping machines

146
0:09:18.018,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and blinking lights that don't stop even when the patient's life has.

147
0:09:23.419,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Cleaning crew swoops in, the body's whisked away,

148
0:09:26.469,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and it all feels as though that person had never really existed.

149
0:09:33.07,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Well-intended, of course, in the name of sterility,

150
0:09:35.717,000 --> 0:09:38,000
but hospitals tend to assault our senses,

151
0:09:39.237,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and the most we might hope for within those walls is numbness --

152
0:09:44.765,000 --> 0:09:48,000
anesthetic, literally the opposite of aesthetic.

153
0:09:50.499,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I revere hospitals for what they can do; I am alive because of them.

154
0:09:56.096,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But we ask too much of our hospitals.

155
0:09:59.436,000 --> 0:10:02,000
They are places for acute trauma and treatable illness.

156
0:10:03.053,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They are no place to live and die; that's not what they were designed for.

157
0:10:10.078,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Now mind you -- I am not giving up on the notion

158
0:10:12.402,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that our institutions can become more humane.

159
0:10:16.057,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Beauty can be found anywhere.

160
0:10:21.092,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I spent a few months in a burn unit

161
0:10:23.388,000 --> 0:10:25,000
at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, New Jersey,

162
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
where I got really great care at every turn,

163
0:10:30.341,000 --> 0:10:32,000
including good palliative care for my pain.

164
0:10:33.415,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And one night, it began to snow outside.

165
0:10:37.426,000 --> 0:10:4,000
I remember my nurses complaining about driving through it.

166
0:10:42.103,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And there was no window in my room,

167
0:10:44.311,000 --> 0:10:47,000
but it was great to just imagine it coming down all sticky.

168
0:10:49.299,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Next day, one of my nurses smuggled in a snowball for me.

169
0:10:53.257,000 --> 0:10:54,000
She brought it in to the unit.

170
0:10:56.731,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I cannot tell you the rapture I felt holding that in my hand,

171
0:11:02.163,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and the coldness dripping onto my burning skin;

172
0:11:05.236,000 --> 0:11:07,000
the miracle of it all,

173
0:11:07.57,000 --> 0:11:1,000
the fascination as I watched it melt and turn into water.

174
0:11:15.293,000 --> 0:11:17,000
In that moment,

175
0:11:17.448,000 --> 0:11:21,000
just being any part of this planet in this universe mattered more to me

176
0:11:21.96,000 --> 0:11:23,000
than whether I lived or died.

177
0:11:24.083,000 --> 0:11:27,000
That little snowball packed all the inspiration I needed

178
0:11:27.23,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to both try to live and be OK if I did not.

179
0:11:31.176,000 --> 0:11:33,000
In a hospital, that's a stolen moment.

180
0:11:36.356,000 --> 0:11:39,000
In my work over the years, I've known many people

181
0:11:39.769,000 --> 0:11:4,000
who were ready to go, ready to die.

182
0:11:43.192,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Not because they had found some final peace or transcendence,

183
0:11:47.999,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but because they were so repulsed by what their lives had become --

184
0:11:54.553,000 --> 0:11:58,000
in a word, cut off, or ugly.

185
0:12:03.394,000 --> 0:12:09,000
There are already record numbers of us living with chronic and terminal illness,

186
0:12:09.504,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and into ever older age.

187
0:12:11.947,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And we are nowhere near ready or prepared for this silver tsunami.

188
0:12:19.335,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We need an infrastructure dynamic enough to handle

189
0:12:22.62,000 --> 0:12:26,000
these seismic shifts in our population.

190
0:12:27.637,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Now is the time to create something new, something vital.

191
0:12:30.681,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I know we can because we have to.

192
0:12:33.065,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The alternative is just unacceptable.

193
0:12:35.651,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And the key ingredients are known:

194
0:12:37.557,000 --> 0:12:4,000
policy, education and training,

195
0:12:41.255,000 --> 0:12:43,000
systems, bricks and mortar.

196
0:12:44.642,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We have tons of input for designers of all stripes to work with.

197
0:12:49.123,000 --> 0:12:5,000
We know, for example, from research

198
0:12:51.028,000 --> 0:12:54,000
what's most important to people who are closer to death:

199
0:12:54.538,000 --> 0:13:,000
comfort; feeling unburdened and unburdening to those they love;

200
0:13:01.527,000 --> 0:13:06,000
existential peace; and a sense of wonderment and spirituality.

201
0:13:08.896,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Over Zen Hospice's nearly 30 years,

202
0:13:12.678,000 --> 0:13:15,000
we've learned much more from our residents in subtle detail.

203
0:13:17.662,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Little things aren't so little.

204
0:13:21.499,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Take Janette.

205
0:13:22.697,000 --> 0:13:25,000
She finds it harder to breathe one day to the next due to ALS.

206
0:13:26.208,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Well, guess what?

207
0:13:28.121,000 --> 0:13:31,000
She wants to start smoking again --

208
0:13:31.523,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and French cigarettes, if you please.

209
0:13:36.786,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Not out of some self-destructive bent,

210
0:13:39.033,000 --> 0:13:42,000
but to feel her lungs filled while she has them.

211
0:13:44.786,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Priorities change.

212
0:13:47.556,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Or Kate -- she just wants to know

213
0:13:50.051,000 --> 0:13:54,000
her dog Austin is lying at the foot of her bed,

214
0:13:54.11,000 --> 0:13:57,000
his cold muzzle against her dry skin,

215
0:13:57.851,000 --> 0:13:59,000
instead of more chemotherapy coursing through her veins --

216
0:14:00.598,000 --> 0:14:01,000
she's done that.

217
0:14:02.849,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Sensuous, aesthetic gratification, where in a moment, in an instant,

218
0:14:07.889,000 --> 0:14:1,000
we are rewarded for just being.

219
0:14:15.373,000 --> 0:14:19,000
So much of it comes down to loving our time by way of the senses,

220
0:14:19.679,000 --> 0:14:24,000
by way of the body -- the very thing doing the living and the dying.

221
0:14:26.258,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Probably the most poignant room

222
0:14:27.841,000 --> 0:14:29,000
in the Zen Hospice guest house is our kitchen,

223
0:14:30.118,000 --> 0:14:32,000
which is a little strange when you realize

224
0:14:32.179,000 --> 0:14:35,000
that so many of our residents can eat very little, if anything at all.

225
0:14:36.016,000 --> 0:14:41,000
But we realize we are providing sustenance on several levels:

226
0:14:41.91,000 --> 0:14:44,000
smell, a symbolic plane.

227
0:14:46.356,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Seriously, with all the heavy-duty stuff happening under our roof,

228
0:14:51.297,000 --> 0:14:54,000
one of the most tried and true interventions we know of,

229
0:14:55.055,000 --> 0:14:58,000
is to bake cookies.

230
0:15:10.144,000 --> 0:15:11,000
As long as we have our senses --

231
0:15:11.772,000 --> 0:15:13,000
even just one --

232
0:15:13.808,000 --> 0:15:16,000
we have at least the possibility of accessing

233
0:15:17.241,000 --> 0:15:2,000
what makes us feel human, connected.

234
0:15:22.999,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Imagine the ripples of this notion

235
0:15:25.809,000 --> 0:15:27,000
for the millions of people living and dying with dementia.

236
0:15:29.554,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Primal sensorial delights that say the things we don't have words for,

237
0:15:33.843,000 --> 0:15:35,000
impulses that make us stay present --

238
0:15:36.741,000 --> 0:15:38,000
no need for a past or a future.

239
0:15:42.28,000 --> 0:15:48,000
So, if teasing unnecessary suffering out of the system was our first design cue,

240
0:15:50.559,000 --> 0:15:52,000
then tending to dignity by way of the senses,

241
0:15:53.287,000 --> 0:15:56,000
by way of the body -- the aesthetic realm --

242
0:15:57.103,000 --> 0:15:58,000
is design cue number two.

243
0:15:59.944,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Now this gets us quickly to the third and final bit for today;

244
0:16:03.774,000 --> 0:16:09,000
namely, we need to lift our sights, to set our sights on well-being,

245
0:16:10.662,000 --> 0:16:13,000
so that life and health and healthcare

246
0:16:13.999,000 --> 0:16:15,000
can become about making life more wonderful,

247
0:16:16.408,000 --> 0:16:18,000
rather than just less horrible.

248
0:16:20.196,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Beneficence.

249
0:16:22.999,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Here, this gets right at the distinction

250
0:16:25.158,000 --> 0:16:3,000
between a disease-centered and a patient- or human-centered model of care,

251
0:16:30.316,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and here is where caring becomes a creative, generative,

252
0:16:33.801,000 --> 0:16:34,000
even playful act.

253
0:16:36.657,000 --> 0:16:38,000
"Play" may sound like a funny word here.

254
0:16:39.687,000 --> 0:16:41,000
But it is also one of our highest forms of adaptation.

255
0:16:42.615,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Consider every major compulsory effort it takes to be human.

256
0:16:47.298,000 --> 0:16:49,000
The need for food has birthed cuisine.

257
0:16:49.825,000 --> 0:16:51,000
The need for shelter has given rise to architecture.

258
0:16:52.437,000 --> 0:16:54,000
The need for cover, fashion.

259
0:16:54.667,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And for being subjected to the clock,

260
0:16:57.422,000 --> 0:17:,000
well, we invented music.

261
0:17:03.766,000 --> 0:17:06,000
So, since dying is a necessary part of life,

262
0:17:06.999,000 --> 0:17:08,000
what might we create with this fact?

263
0:17:12.054,000 --> 0:17:15,000
By "play" I am in no way suggesting we take a light approach to dying

264
0:17:15.454,000 --> 0:17:17,000
or that we mandate any particular way of dying.

265
0:17:18.117,000 --> 0:17:2,000
There are mountains of sorrow that cannot move,

266
0:17:20.999,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and one way or another, we will all kneel there.

267
0:17:24.999,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Rather, I am asking that we make space --

268
0:17:28.524,000 --> 0:17:33,000
physical, psychic room, to allow life to play itself all the way out --

269
0:17:34.291,000 --> 0:17:37,000
so that rather than just getting out of the way,

270
0:17:37.672,000 --> 0:17:41,000
aging and dying can become a process of crescendo through to the end.

271
0:17:44.931,000 --> 0:17:47,000
We can't solve for death.

272
0:17:50.283,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I know some of you are working on this.

273
0:17:52.614,000 --> 0:17:55,000
(Laughter)

274
0:17:57.003,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Meanwhile, we can --

275
0:17:58.839,000 --> 0:18:,000
(Laughter)

276
0:18:00.879,000 --> 0:18:02,000
We can design towards it.

277
0:18:04.042,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Parts of me died early on,

278
0:18:05.441,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and that's something we can all say one way or another.

279
0:18:08.583,000 --> 0:18:1,000
I got to redesign my life around this fact,

280
0:18:11.248,000 --> 0:18:14,000
and I tell you it has been a liberation

281
0:18:14.612,000 --> 0:18:17,000
to realize you can always find a shock of beauty or meaning

282
0:18:17.791,000 --> 0:18:19,000
in what life you have left,

283
0:18:20.082,000 --> 0:18:22,000
like that snowball lasting for a perfect moment,

284
0:18:22.87,000 --> 0:18:24,000
all the while melting away.

285
0:18:26.7,000 --> 0:18:32,000
If we love such moments ferociously,

286
0:18:32.743,000 --> 0:18:34,000
then maybe we can learn to live well --

287
0:18:35.039,000 --> 0:18:37,000
not in spite of death,

288
0:18:37.15,000 --> 0:18:38,000
but because of it.

289
0:18:42.52,000 --> 0:18:44,000
Let death be what takes us,

290
0:18:44.72,000 --> 0:18:46,000
not lack of imagination.

291
0:18:48.868,000 --> 0:18:49,000
Thank you.

292
0:18:50.044,000 --> 0:18:57,000
(Applause)

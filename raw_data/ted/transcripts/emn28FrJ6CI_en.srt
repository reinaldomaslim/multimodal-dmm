1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
We look around the media, as we see on the news from Iraq,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Afghanistan, Sierra Leone,

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and the conflict seems incomprehensible to us.

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And that's certainly how it seemed to me when I started this project.

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
But as a physicist,

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I thought, well if you give me some data,

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I could maybe understand this. You know, give us a go.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So as a naive New Zealander

9
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I thought, well I'll go to the Pentagon.

10
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Can you get me some information?

11
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
No. So I had to think a little harder.

13
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I was watching the news one night in Oxford.

14
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And I looked down at the chattering heads on my channel of choice.

15
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I saw that there was information there.

16
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
There was data within the streams of news that we consume.

17
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
All this noise around us actually has information.

18
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So what I started thinking was,

19
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
perhaps there is something like open source intelligence here.

20
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
If we can get enough of these streams of information together,

21
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we can perhaps start to understand the war.

22
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So this is exactly what I did. We started bringing a team together,

23
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
an interdisciplinary team of scientists,

24
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of economists, mathematicians.

25
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We brought these guys together and we started to try and solve this.

26
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We did it in three steps.

27
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The first step we did was to collect. We did 130 different sources of information --

28
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
from NGO reports to newspapers and cable news.

29
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We brought this raw data in and we filtered it.

30
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We extracted the key bits on information to build the database.

31
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
That database contained

32
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the timing of attacks,

33
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the location, the size and the weapons used.

34
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It's all in the streams of information we consume daily,

35
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we just have to know how to pull it out.

36
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And once we had this we could start doing some cool stuff.

37
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
What if we were to look at the distribution of the sizes of attacks?

38
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
What would that tell us?

39
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So we started doing this. And you can see here

40
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
on the horizontal axis

41
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
you've got the number of people killed in an attack

42
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
or the size of the attack.

43
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And on the vertical axis you've got the number of attacks.

44
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So we plot data for sample on this.

45
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You see some sort of random distribution --

46
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
perhaps 67 attacks, one person was killed,

47
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
or 47 attacks where seven people were killed.

48
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We did this exact same thing for Iraq.

49
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And we didn't know, for Iraq what we were going to find.

50
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It turns out what we found was pretty surprising.

51
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
You take all of the conflict,

52
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
all of the chaos, all of the noise,

53
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and out of that

54
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
comes this precise mathematical distribution

55
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
of the way attacks are ordered in this conflict.

56
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This blew our mind.

57
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Why should a conflict like Iraq have this

58
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
as its fundamental signature?

59
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Why should there be order in war?

60
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We didn't really understand that.

61
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We thought maybe there is something special about Iraq.

62
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So we looked at a few more conflicts.

63
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We looked at Colombia, we looked at Afghanistan,

64
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and we looked at Senegal.

65
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And the same pattern emerged in each conflict.

66
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
This wasn't supposed to happen.

67
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
These are different wars, with different religious factions,

68
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
different political factions, and different socioeconomic problems.

69
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And yet the fundamental patterns underlying them

70
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
are the same.

71
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So we went a little wider.

72
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
We looked around the world at all the data we could get our hands on.

73
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
From Peru to Indonesia,

74
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
we studied this same pattern again.

75
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And we found that not only

76
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
were the distributions these straight lines,

77
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but the slope of these lines, they clustered around

78
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
this value of alpha equals 2.5.

79
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And we could generate an equation

80
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that could predict the likelihood of an attack.

81
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
What we're saying here

82
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is the probability of an attack killing X number of people

83
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
in a country like Iraq

84
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is equal to a constant, times the size of that attack,

85
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
raised to the power of negative alpha.

86
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And negative alpha is the slope of that line I showed you before.

87
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So what?

88
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
This is data, statistics. What does it tell us about these conflicts?

89
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
That was a challenge we had to face as physicists.

90
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
How do we explain this?

91
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And what we really found was that alpha,

92
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
if we think about it, is the organizational

93
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
structure of the insurgency.

94
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Alpha is the distribution of the sizes of attacks,

95
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
which is really the distribution

96
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of the group strength carrying out the attacks.

97
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So we look at a process of group dynamics:

98
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
coalescence and fragmentation,

99
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
groups coming together, groups breaking apart.

100
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And we start running the numbers on this. Can we simulate it?

101
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Can we create the kind of patterns that we're seeing

102
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in places like Iraq?

103
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job.

104
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We can run these simulations.

105
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We can recreate this using a process of group dynamics

106
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
to explain the patterns that we see

107
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
all around the conflicts around the world.

108
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So what's going on?

109
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Why should these different -- seemingly different conflicts

110
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
have the same patterns?

111
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Now what I believe is going on is that

112
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the insurgent forces, they evolve over time. They adapt.

113
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And it turns out there is only one solution

114
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to fight a much stronger enemy.

115
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And if you don't find that solution as an insurgent force,

116
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
you don't exist.

117
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So every insurgent force that is ongoing,

118
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
every conflict that is ongoing,

119
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it's going to look something like this.

120
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And that is what we think is happening.

121
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Taking it forward, how do we change it?

122
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
How do we end a war like Iraq?

123
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
What does it look like?

124
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Alpha is the structure. It's got a stable state at 2.5.

125
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
This is what wars look like when they continue.

126
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We've got to change that.

127
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We can push it up:

128
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the forces become more fragmented;

129
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
there is more of them, but they are weaker.

130
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Or we push it down:

131
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
they're more robust; there is less groups;

132
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but perhaps you can sit and talk to them.

133
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So this graph here, I'm going to show you now.

134
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
No one has seen this before. This is literally

135
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
stuff that we've come through last week.

136
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And we see the evolution of Alpha through time.

137
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
We see it start. And we see it grow up to the stable state

138
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the wars around the world look like.

139
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And it stays there through the invasion of Fallujah

140
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
until the Samarra bombings in the

141
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Iraqi elections of '06.

142
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And the system gets perturbed. It moves upwards

143
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to a fragmented state.

144
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
This is when the surge happens.

145
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And depending on who you ask,

146
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
the surge was supposed to push it up even further.

147
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The opposite happened.

148
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The groups became stronger.

149
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
They became more robust.

150
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And so I'm thinking, right, great, it's going to keep going down.

151
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
We can talk to them. We can get a solution. The opposite happened.

152
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It's moved up again. The groups are more fragmented.

153
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And this tells me one of two things.

154
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Either we're back where we started

155
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and the surge has had no effect;

156
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
or finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent

157
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that we can start to think about maybe moving out.

158
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I don't know what the answer is to that.

159
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But I know that we should be looking at the structure of the insurgency

160
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
to answer that question.

161
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Thank you.

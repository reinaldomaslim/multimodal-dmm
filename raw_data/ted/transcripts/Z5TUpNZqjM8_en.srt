1
0:00:18.964,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Let's talk about manias.

2
0:00:23.021,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Let's start with Beatlemania.

3
0:00:25.003,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Recording of crowd roaring)

4
0:00:27.203,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Hysterical teenagers,

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
crying, screaming, pandemonium.

6
0:00:32.525,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Recording of crowd roaring)

7
0:00:35.818,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Sports mania:

8
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
deafening crowds,

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
all for one idea -- get the ball in the net.

10
0:00:44.625,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Recording) Goal!

11
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Okay, religious mania:

12
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
there's rapture, there's weeping,

13
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
there's visions.

14
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Manias can be good.

15
0:00:55.338,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Manias can be alarming.

16
0:00:58.436,000 --> 0:01:,000
Or manias can be deadly.

17
0:01:00.645,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Recording of crowd cheering)

18
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The world has a new mania.

19
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
A mania for learning English.

20
0:01:08.962,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Listen as Chinese students practice their English,

21
0:01:12.504,000 --> 0:01:13,000
by screaming it:

22
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Teacher: ... change my life!

23
0:01:16.45,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Students: I want to change my life!

24
0:01:18.885,000 --> 0:01:21,000
T: I don't want to let my parents down!

25
0:01:21.972,000 --> 0:01:24,000
S: I don't want to let my parents down!

26
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
T: I don't ever want to let my country down!

27
0:01:28.698,000 --> 0:01:31,000
S: I don't ever want to let my country down!

28
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
T: Most importantly... S: Most importantly...

29
0:01:35.893,000 --> 0:01:37,000
T: I don't want to let myself down!

30
0:01:38.601,000 --> 0:01:4,000
S: I don't want to let myself down!

31
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
How many people are trying to learn English worldwide?

32
0:01:44.497,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Two billion of them.

33
0:01:47.02,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Students: A t-shirt. A dress.

34
0:01:51.157,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Jay Walker: In Latin America,

35
0:01:52.8,000 --> 0:01:53,000
in India,

36
0:01:54.474,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in Southeast Asia,

37
0:01:56.125,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and most of all, in China.

38
0:01:58.901,000 --> 0:01:59,000
If you're a Chinese student,

39
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
you start learning English in the third grade, by law.

40
0:02:05.774,000 --> 0:02:06,000
That's why this year,

41
0:02:07.544,000 --> 0:02:11,000
China will become the world's largest English-speaking country.

42
0:02:12.613,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:14.56,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Why English?

44
0:02:15.902,000 --> 0:02:17,000
In a single word: opportunity.

45
0:02:18.091,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Opportunity for a better life, a job,

46
0:02:20.917,000 --> 0:02:23,000
to be able to pay for school, or put better food on the table.

47
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days.

48
0:02:28.893,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Her score on this one test literally determines her future.

49
0:02:33.37,000 --> 0:02:35,000
She studies 12 hours a day

50
0:02:35.878,000 --> 0:02:37,000
for three years to prepare.

51
0:02:38.642,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Twenty-five percent of her grade is based on English.

52
0:02:43.594,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It's called the gaokao, and 80 million high school Chinese students

53
0:02:48.309,000 --> 0:02:5,000
have already taken this grueling test.

54
0:02:50.705,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The intensity to learn English

55
0:02:52.998,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is almost unimaginable, unless you witness it.

56
0:02:56.949,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Teacher: Perfect! Students: Perfect!

57
0:02:58.76,000 --> 0:03:,000
T: Perfect! S: Perfect!

58
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
T: I want to speak perfect English!

59
0:03:03.774,000 --> 0:03:05,000
S: I want to speak perfect English!

60
0:03:06.095,000 --> 0:03:08,000
T: I want to speak ... S: I want to speak ...

61
0:03:08.402,000 --> 0:03:1,000
T: ... perfect English! S: ... perfect English!

62
0:03:11.172,000 --> 0:03:14,000
T (yelling more loudly): I want to change my life!

63
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
S (yelling more loudly): I want to change my life!

64
0:03:18.306,000 --> 0:03:21,000
JW: So is English mania good or bad?

65
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Is English a tsunami, washing away other languages?

66
0:03:25.663,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Not likely.

67
0:03:26.909,000 --> 0:03:28,000
English is the world's second language.

68
0:03:29.83,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Your native language is your life.

69
0:03:31.925,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But with English you can become part of a wider conversation --

70
0:03:35.885,000 --> 0:03:38,000
a global conversation about global problems,

71
0:03:39.615,000 --> 0:03:41,000
like climate change or poverty,

72
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
or hunger or disease.

73
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The world has other universal languages.

74
0:03:48.829,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Mathematics is the language of science.

75
0:03:51.885,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Music is the language of emotions.

76
0:03:54.901,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And now English is becoming the language of problem-solving.

77
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Not because America is pushing it,

78
0:04:01.568,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but because the world is pulling it.

79
0:04:05.195,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So English mania is a turning point.

80
0:04:08.453,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Like the harnessing of electricity in our cities,

81
0:04:11.025,000 --> 0:04:13,000
or the fall of the Berlin Wall,

82
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
English represents hope

83
0:04:15.716,000 --> 0:04:16,000
for a better future --

84
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
a future where the world has a common language

85
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to solve its common problems.

86
0:04:24.368,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Thank you very much.

87
0:04:25.552,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Applause)

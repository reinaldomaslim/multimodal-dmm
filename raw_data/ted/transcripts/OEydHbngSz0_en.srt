0:00:12.849,000 --> 0:00:15,000
One winter morning, a couple of years ago,

2
0:00:16.73,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa,

3
0:00:19.729,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and noticed a haze hanging over the city.

4
0:00:22.895,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I make that drive on most days,

5
0:00:25.014,000 --> 0:00:27,000
so it was unusual that I hadn't noticed this before.

6
0:00:28.559,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Johannesburg is known for its distinctive skyline,

7
0:00:31.672,000 --> 0:00:32,000
which I could barely see that morning.

8
0:00:34.322,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It didn't take long for me to realize that I was looking at an enormous cloud

9
0:00:38.867,000 --> 0:00:39,000
of air pollution.

10
0:00:40.994,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The contrast between the scenic environment I knew

11
0:00:44.589,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and this smog-covered skyline

12
0:00:46.898,000 --> 0:00:47,000
stirred up something within me.

13
0:00:49.092,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was appalled by the possibility of this city of bright and vivid sunsets

14
0:00:54.592,000 --> 0:00:56,000
being overrun by a dull haze.

15
0:00:57.258,000 --> 0:01:01,000
At that moment, I felt an urge to do something about it,

16
0:01:01.286,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but I didn't know what.

17
0:01:03.808,000 --> 0:01:06,000
All I knew was I couldn't just stand idly by.

18
0:01:07.564,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The main challenge was,

19
0:01:09.685,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I didn't know much about environmental science

20
0:01:13.946,000 --> 0:01:14,000
air-quality management

21
0:01:15.495,000 --> 0:01:16,000
or atmospheric chemistry.

22
0:01:17.827,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I am a computer engineer,

23
0:01:19.74,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and I was pretty sure I couldn't code my way out of this air pollution problem.

24
0:01:23.783,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:24.868,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Who was I to do anything about this issue?

26
0:01:27.888,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I was but a citizen.

27
0:01:31.786,000 --> 0:01:34,000
In the following years, I learned a very important lesson,

28
0:01:35.691,000 --> 0:01:39,000
a lesson we all need to take to heart if we are to work towards a better future.

29
0:01:40.738,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Even if you're not an expert in a particular domain,

30
0:01:44.436,000 --> 0:01:46,000
your outside expertise may hold the key

31
0:01:47.223,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to solving big problems within that domain.

32
0:01:50.381,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Sometimes the unique perspective you have

33
0:01:53.097,000 --> 0:01:57,000
can result in unconventional thinking that can move the needle,

34
0:01:57.582,000 --> 0:02:,000
but you need to be bold enough to try.

35
0:02:01.752,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That's the only way you'll ever know.

36
0:02:04.889,000 --> 0:02:05,000
What I knew back then

37
0:02:06.459,000 --> 0:02:09,000
was that if I was even going to try to make a difference,

38
0:02:10.435,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I had to get smart about air pollution first,

39
0:02:13.483,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and so I became a student again.

40
0:02:17.522,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I did a bit of basic research

41
0:02:19.652,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and soon learned that air pollution

42
0:02:21.676,000 --> 0:02:24,000
is the world's biggest environmental health risk.

43
0:02:25.816,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Data from the World Health Organization

44
0:02:28.214,000 --> 0:02:33,000
shows that almost 14 percent of all deaths worldwide in 2012

45
0:02:33.38,000 --> 0:02:36,000
were attributable to household and ambient air pollution,

46
0:02:37.088,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with most occurring in low- and middle-income countries.

47
0:02:41.449,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Ambient air pollution alone causes more deaths each year

48
0:02:45.204,000 --> 0:02:47,000
than malaria and HIV/AIDS.

49
0:02:48.355,000 --> 0:02:51,000
In Africa, premature deaths from unsafe sanitation

50
0:02:52.212,000 --> 0:02:53,000
or childhood malnutrition

51
0:02:53.975,000 --> 0:02:56,000
pale in comparison to deaths due to air pollution,

52
0:02:57.539,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and it comes at a huge economic cost:

53
0:03:00.269,000 --> 0:03:04,000
over 400 billion US dollars as of 2013,

54
0:03:04.426,000 --> 0:03:08,000
according to a study by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.

55
0:03:09.862,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now, in my work,

56
0:03:12.998,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I explore new frontiers for artificial intelligence,

57
0:03:17.208,000 --> 0:03:2,000
where the symbiotic relationship between man and machine

58
0:03:20.669,000 --> 0:03:23,000
can find a beneficial footing and help us to make better decisions.

59
0:03:25.249,000 --> 0:03:28,000
As I thought about the air pollution problem,

60
0:03:28.337,000 --> 0:03:31,000
it became clear that we needed to find a way to make better decisions

61
0:03:32.307,000 --> 0:03:34,000
about how we manage air pollution,

62
0:03:34.964,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and given the scale of the problem,

63
0:03:36.971,000 --> 0:03:38,000
it was necessary to do it in a collaborative way.

64
0:03:40.31,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So I decided I'd better get to know some people working within the field.

65
0:03:45.5,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I started to speak to officials from the City of Johannesburg

66
0:03:48.946,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and other surrounding cities,

67
0:03:50.597,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and I engaged the local scientific community,

68
0:03:53.58,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and I also made a few cold calls.

69
0:03:57.016,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The process of engagement I embarked upon

70
0:03:59.593,000 --> 0:04:02,000
helped me to develop a deeper understanding of the problem.

71
0:04:03.51,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It also helped me to avoid the trap

72
0:04:05.88,000 --> 0:04:08,000
people in my profession sometimes fall into when trying to innovate,

73
0:04:09.328,000 --> 0:04:11,000
where we are quick to apply a technology

74
0:04:11.679,000 --> 0:04:13,000
before we've firmly grasped the problem at hand.

75
0:04:15.534,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I began to develop an idea

76
0:04:17.696,000 --> 0:04:19,000
about what I could do to improve the situation.

77
0:04:20.742,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I started by simply asking myself

78
0:04:23.182,000 --> 0:04:25,000
how I could bring together in some meaningful way

79
0:04:25.904,000 --> 0:04:28,000
my skills in software engineering and artificial intelligence

80
0:04:29.796,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and the expertise of the people I'd reached out to.

81
0:04:33.075,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I wanted to create an online air-quality management platform

82
0:04:37.092,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that would uncover trends in pollution

83
0:04:39.197,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and project into the future

84
0:04:41.147,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to determine what outcomes can be expected.

85
0:04:44.462,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I was determined to see my idea translate into a practical solution,

86
0:04:49.874,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but I faced uncertainty

87
0:04:52.726,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and had no guarantee of success.

88
0:04:55.576,000 --> 0:05:,000
What I had was a very particular set of engineering skills,

89
0:05:00.918,000 --> 0:05:02,000
skills I'd acquired over my career

90
0:05:03.378,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Laughter)

91
0:05:04.647,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that were new to people who had been working on the air pollution problem

92
0:05:08.133,000 --> 0:05:09,000
for so many years.

93
0:05:09.675,000 --> 0:05:13,000
What I have come to realize is that sometimes just one fresh perspective,

94
0:05:14.668,000 --> 0:05:15,000
one new skill set,

95
0:05:15.985,000 --> 0:05:18,000
can make the conditions right for something remarkable to happen.

96
0:05:20.066,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Our willpower and imagination are a guiding light,

97
0:05:23.781,000 --> 0:05:26,000
enabling us to chart new paths and navigate through obstacles.

98
0:05:28.241,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Armed with a firmer understanding of the air pollution problem,

99
0:05:31.923,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and having managed to source over a decade's worth of data

100
0:05:35.309,000 --> 0:05:36,000
on air pollutant levels

101
0:05:36.785,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and the meteorological conditions for in and around Johannesburg,

102
0:05:41.283,000 --> 0:05:45,000
my colleagues from South Africa and China and myself

103
0:05:45.419,000 --> 0:05:47,000
created an air-quality decision support system

104
0:05:48.18,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that lives in the cloud.

105
0:05:50.21,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This software system analyzes historical and real-time data

106
0:05:54.305,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to uncover the spatial-temporal trends in pollution.

107
0:05:57.695,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We then used new machine learning technology

108
0:06:00.574,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to predict future levels of pollution

109
0:06:03.237,000 --> 0:06:05,000
for several different pollutants days in advance.

110
0:06:06.849,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This means that citizens can make better decisions

111
0:06:10.331,000 --> 0:06:11,000
about their daily movements

112
0:06:12.07,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and about where to settle their families.

113
0:06:14.575,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We can predict adverse pollution events ahead of time,

114
0:06:18.083,000 --> 0:06:19,000
identify heavy polluters,

115
0:06:19.908,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and they can be ordered by the relevant authorities

116
0:06:22.455,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to scale back their operations.

117
0:06:25.315,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Through assisted scenario planning,

118
0:06:27.854,000 --> 0:06:29,000
city planners can also make better decisions

119
0:06:30.576,000 --> 0:06:32,000
about how to extend infrastructure,

120
0:06:32.605,000 --> 0:06:34,000
such as human settlements or industrial zones.

121
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We completed a pilot of our technology

122
0:06:38.929,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that was run over a period of 120 days,

123
0:06:42.281,000 --> 0:06:44,000
covering all of South Africa.

124
0:06:45.376,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Our results were confirmed

125
0:06:47.219,000 --> 0:06:49,000
when we demonstrated a tight correlation

126
0:06:49.806,000 --> 0:06:51,000
between the forecasting data

127
0:06:52.227,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and the data we were getting on the ground.

128
0:06:55.631,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Through our leadership,

129
0:06:57.325,000 --> 0:07:,000
we have brought cutting-edge, world-leading assets

130
0:07:01.198,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that can perform air-quality forecasting

131
0:07:03.888,000 --> 0:07:07,000
at an unprecedented resolution and accuracy,

132
0:07:08.032,000 --> 0:07:14,000
benefiting the city that I drove into one winter morning not very long ago,

133
0:07:14.905,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and thought to myself,

134
0:07:16.46,000 --> 0:07:18,000
"Something is wrong here. I wonder what can be done?"

135
0:07:20.563,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So here is the point:

136
0:07:23.895,000 --> 0:07:26,000
What if I'd not investigated the problem of air pollution further?

137
0:07:28.951,000 --> 0:07:31,000
What if I'd not shown some concern for the state of the environment

138
0:07:32.898,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and just hoped that someone, somewhere, was taking care of the matter?

139
0:07:37.858,000 --> 0:07:38,000
What I have learned is that,

140
0:07:39.327,000 --> 0:07:41,000
when embarking on a challenging endeavor

141
0:07:41.495,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that advances a cause that we firmly believe in,

142
0:07:44.157,000 --> 0:07:47,000
it is important to focus on the possibility of success

143
0:07:47.666,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and consider the consequence of not acting.

144
0:07:51.426,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We should not get distracted by resistance and opposition,

145
0:07:55.355,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but this should motivate us further.

146
0:07:58.405,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So wherever you are in the world,

147
0:08:02.936,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the next time you find

148
0:08:04.399,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that there's some natural curiosity you have

149
0:08:06.617,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that is being piqued,

150
0:08:08.241,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and it's about something you care about,

151
0:08:10.32,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and you have some crazy or bold ideas,

152
0:08:13.129,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and perhaps it's outside the realm of your expertise,

153
0:08:16.817,000 --> 0:08:17,000
ask yourself this:

154
0:08:19.278,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Why not?

155
0:08:22.349,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Why not just go ahead and tackle the problem

156
0:08:24.89,000 --> 0:08:26,000
as best as you can, in your own way?

157
0:08:27.715,000 --> 0:08:29,000
You may be pleasantly surprised.

158
0:08:31.064,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Thank you.

159
0:08:32.239,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Applause)

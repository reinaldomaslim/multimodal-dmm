1
0:00:13.759,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I worked as a war reporter for 15 years

2
0:00:17.136,000 --> 0:00:2,000
before I realized that I really had a problem.

3
0:00:21.101,000 --> 0:00:23,000
There was something really wrong with me.

4
0:00:23.231,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This was about a year before 9/11, and America wasn't at war yet.

5
0:00:27.432,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We weren't talking about PTSD.

6
0:00:29.848,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We were not yet talking about the effect of trauma and war

7
0:00:34.068,000 --> 0:00:35,000
on the human psyche.

8
0:00:36.706,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I'd been in Afghanistan for a couple of months

9
0:00:38.98,000 --> 0:00:41,000
with the Northern Alliance as they were fighting the Taliban.

10
0:00:42.012,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And at that point the Taliban had an air force,

11
0:00:45.293,000 --> 0:00:48,000
they had fighter planes, they had tanks, they had artillery,

12
0:00:48.546,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and we really got hammered pretty badly a couple of times.

13
0:00:51.861,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We saw some very ugly things.

14
0:00:55.104,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But I didn't really think it affected me.

15
0:00:57.098,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I didn't think much about it.

16
0:00:58.65,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I came home to New York, where I live.

17
0:01:01.141,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Then one day I went down into the subway,

18
0:01:04.49,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and for the first time in my life,

19
0:01:06.965,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I knew real fear.

20
0:01:08.823,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I had a massive panic attack.

21
0:01:12.058,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I was way more scared than I had ever been in Afghanistan.

22
0:01:16.093,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Everything I was looking at seemed like it was going to kill me,

23
0:01:19.517,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but I couldn't explain why.

24
0:01:22.121,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The trains were going too fast.

25
0:01:24.119,000 --> 0:01:25,000
There were too many people.

26
0:01:25.497,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The lights were too bright.

27
0:01:27.309,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Everything was too loud, everything was moving too quickly.

28
0:01:30.132,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I backed up against a support column and just waited for it.

29
0:01:35.115,000 --> 0:01:38,000
When I couldn't take it any longer, I ran out of the subway station

30
0:01:38.335,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and walked wherever I was going.

31
0:01:41.648,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Later, I found out that what I had was short-term PTSD:

32
0:01:45.851,000 --> 0:01:46,000
post-traumatic stress disorder.

33
0:01:48.993,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We evolved as animals, as primates, to survive periods of danger,

34
0:01:52.245,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and if your life has been in danger,

35
0:01:55.19,000 --> 0:01:57,000
you want to react to unfamiliar noises.

36
0:01:59.352,000 --> 0:02:01,000
You want to sleep lightly, wake up easily.

37
0:02:01.631,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You want to have nightmares and flashbacks

38
0:02:03.849,000 --> 0:02:04,000
of the thing that could kill you.

39
0:02:06.756,000 --> 0:02:09,000
You want to be angry because it makes you predisposed to fight,

40
0:02:09.837,000 --> 0:02:12,000
or depressed, because it keeps you out of circulation a little bit.

41
0:02:13.591,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Keeps you safe.

42
0:02:15.58,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's not very pleasant, but it's better than getting eaten.

43
0:02:20.469,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Most people recover from that pretty quickly.

44
0:02:22.947,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It takes a few weeks, a few months.

45
0:02:25.061,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I kept having panic attacks, but they eventually went away.

46
0:02:28.2,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I had no idea it was connected to the war that I'd seen.

47
0:02:30.874,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I just thought I was going crazy,

48
0:02:32.494,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and then I thought, well, now I'm not going crazy anymore.

49
0:02:37.197,000 --> 0:02:39,000
About 20 percent of people, however,

50
0:02:39.851,000 --> 0:02:42,000
wind up with chronic, long-term PTSD.

51
0:02:43.166,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They are not adapted to temporary danger.

52
0:02:45.584,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They are maladapted for everyday life,

53
0:02:48.369,000 --> 0:02:49,000
unless they get help.

54
0:02:49.994,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We know that the people who are vulnerable to long-term PTSD

55
0:02:53.557,000 --> 0:02:55,000
are people who were abused as children,

56
0:02:56.297,000 --> 0:02:57,000
who suffered trauma as children,

57
0:02:58.052,000 --> 0:03:,000
people who have low education levels,

58
0:03:00.694,000 --> 0:03:02,000
people who have psychiatric disorders in their family.

59
0:03:03.276,000 --> 0:03:04,000
If you served in Vietnam

60
0:03:04.578,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and your brother is schizophrenic,

61
0:03:07.296,000 --> 0:03:11,000
you're way more likely to get long-term PTSD from Vietnam.

62
0:03:12.571,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So I started to study this as a journalist,

63
0:03:15.868,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and I realized that there was something really strange going on.

64
0:03:19.415,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The numbers seemed to be going in the wrong direction.

65
0:03:22.597,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Every war that we have fought as a country,

66
0:03:24.993,000 --> 0:03:25,000
starting with the Civil War,

67
0:03:26.991,000 --> 0:03:29,000
the intensity of the combat has gone down.

68
0:03:30.878,000 --> 0:03:33,000
As a result, the casualty rates have gone down.

69
0:03:34.707,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But disability rates have gone up.

70
0:03:36.686,000 --> 0:03:38,000
They should be going in the same direction,

71
0:03:39.702,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but they're going in different directions.

72
0:03:44.124,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have produced, thank God,

73
0:03:48.737,000 --> 0:03:53,000
a casualty rate about one third of what it was in Vietnam.

74
0:03:56.129,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But they've also created --

75
0:03:58.678,000 --> 0:04:01,000
they've also produced three times the disability rates.

76
0:04:03.526,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Around 10 percent of the US military is actively engaged in combat,

77
0:04:10.439,000 --> 0:04:11,000
10 percent or under.

78
0:04:11.801,000 --> 0:04:13,000
They're shooting at people, killing people,

79
0:04:14.099,000 --> 0:04:16,000
getting shot at, seeing their friends get killed.

80
0:04:16.461,000 --> 0:04:17,000
It's incredibly traumatic.

81
0:04:18.038,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But it's only about 10 percent of our military.

82
0:04:20.872,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But about half of our military has filed

83
0:04:23.129,000 --> 0:04:27,000
for some kind of PTSD compensation from the government.

84
0:04:28.922,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And suicide doesn't even fit into this in a very logical way.

85
0:04:34.173,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We've all heard the tragic statistic of 22 vets a day, on average,

86
0:04:39.983,000 --> 0:04:41,000
in this country, killing themselves.

87
0:04:43.564,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Most people don't realize

88
0:04:45.078,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that the majority of those suicides are veterans of the Vietnam War,

89
0:04:50.739,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that generation,

90
0:04:52.641,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and their decision to take their own lives actually might not be related

91
0:04:57.163,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to the war they fought 50 years earlier.

92
0:05:01.122,000 --> 0:05:04,000
In fact, there's no statistical connection between combat and suicide.

93
0:05:04.838,000 --> 0:05:07,000
If you're in the military and you're in a lot of combat,

94
0:05:07.929,000 --> 0:05:1,000
you're no more likely to kill yourself than if you weren't.

95
0:05:11.614,000 --> 0:05:12,000
In fact, one study found

96
0:05:12.964,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that if you deploy to Iraq or Afghanistan,

97
0:05:15.012,000 --> 0:05:18,000
you're actually slightly less likely to commit suicide later.

98
0:05:20.626,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I studied anthropology in college.

99
0:05:22.92,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I did my fieldwork on the Navajo reservation.

100
0:05:25.963,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I wrote a thesis on Navajo long-distance runners.

101
0:05:30.473,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And recently, while I was researching PTSD,

102
0:05:35.501,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I had this thought.

103
0:05:38.325,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I thought back to the work I did when I was young,

104
0:05:41.428,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and I thought, I bet the Navajo, the Apache, the Comanche --

105
0:05:45.521,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I mean, these are very warlike nations --

106
0:05:48.109,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I bet they weren't getting PTSD like we do.

107
0:05:52.814,000 --> 0:05:54,000
When their warriors came back from fighting the US military

108
0:05:55.83,000 --> 0:05:56,000
or fighting each other,

109
0:05:58.241,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I bet they pretty much just slipped right back into tribal life.

110
0:06:03.635,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And maybe what determines

111
0:06:05.913,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the rate of long-term PTSD

112
0:06:08.631,000 --> 0:06:09,000
isn't what happened out there,

113
0:06:11.942,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but the kind of society you come back to.

114
0:06:15.107,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And maybe if you come back to a close, cohesive, tribal society,

115
0:06:20.823,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you can get over trauma pretty quickly.

116
0:06:23.83,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And if you come back to an alienating, modern society,

117
0:06:28.719,000 --> 0:06:31,000
you might remain traumatized your entire life.

118
0:06:32.248,000 --> 0:06:35,000
In other words, maybe the problem isn't them, the vets;

119
0:06:35.383,000 --> 0:06:36,000
maybe the problem is us.

120
0:06:39.325,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Certainly, modern society is hard on the human psyche

121
0:06:44.649,000 --> 0:06:45,000
by every metric that we have.

122
0:06:49.043,000 --> 0:06:51,000
As wealth goes up in a society,

123
0:06:53.523,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the suicide rate goes up instead of down.

124
0:06:58.066,000 --> 0:07:,000
If you live in modern society,

125
0:07:00.18,000 --> 0:07:02,000
you're up to eight times more likely

126
0:07:04.379,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to suffer from depression in your lifetime

127
0:07:06.724,000 --> 0:07:08,000
than if you live in a poor, agrarian society.

128
0:07:10.915,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Modern society has probably produced the highest rates of suicide

129
0:07:14.538,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and depression and anxiety and loneliness and child abuse

130
0:07:17.816,000 --> 0:07:18,000
ever in human history.

131
0:07:20.695,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I saw one study

132
0:07:22.292,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that compared women in Nigeria,

133
0:07:25.358,000 --> 0:07:27,000
one of the most chaotic and violent and corrupt

134
0:07:28.627,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and poorest countries in Africa,

135
0:07:31.358,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to women in North America.

136
0:07:32.673,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And the highest rates of depression were urban women in North America.

137
0:07:37.887,000 --> 0:07:38,000
That was also the wealthiest group.

138
0:07:40.637,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So let's go back to the US military.

139
0:07:45.096,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Ten percent are in combat.

140
0:07:47.638,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Around 50 percent have filed for PTSD compensation.

141
0:07:53.602,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So about 40 percent of veterans really were not traumatized overseas

142
0:07:59.734,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but have come home to discover they are dangerously alienated

143
0:08:04.563,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and depressed.

144
0:08:08.341,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So what is happening with them?

145
0:08:11.302,000 --> 0:08:12,000
What's going on with those people,

146
0:08:14.051,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the phantom 40 percent that are troubled but don't understand why?

147
0:08:18.81,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Maybe it's this:

148
0:08:20.158,000 --> 0:08:24,000
maybe they had an experience of sort of tribal closeness

149
0:08:24.826,000 --> 0:08:26,000
in their unit when they were overseas.

150
0:08:28.075,000 --> 0:08:3,000
They were eating together, sleeping together,

151
0:08:30.732,000 --> 0:08:32,000
doing tasks and missions together.

152
0:08:33.055,000 --> 0:08:35,000
They were trusting each other with their lives.

153
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And then they come home

154
0:08:38.857,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and they have to give all that up

155
0:08:41.851,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and they're coming back to a society, a modern society,

156
0:08:45.614,000 --> 0:08:48,000
which is hard on people who weren't even in the military.

157
0:08:49.171,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It's just hard on everybody.

158
0:08:51.494,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And we keep focusing on trauma, PTSD.

159
0:08:56.685,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But for a lot of these people,

160
0:08:59.34,000 --> 0:09:,000
maybe it's not trauma.

161
0:09:00.561,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I mean, certainly, soldiers are traumatized

162
0:09:03.14,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and the ones who are have to be treated for that.

163
0:09:05.533,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But a lot of them --

164
0:09:06.751,000 --> 0:09:09,000
maybe what's bothering them is actually a kind of alienation.

165
0:09:10.321,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I mean, maybe we just have the wrong word for some of it,

166
0:09:13.115,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and just changing our language, our understanding,

167
0:09:15.528,000 --> 0:09:16,000
would help a little bit.

168
0:09:16.726,000 --> 0:09:18,000
"Post-deployment alienation disorder."

169
0:09:19.462,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Maybe even just calling it that for some of these people

170
0:09:23.634,000 --> 0:09:25,000
would allow them to stop imagining

171
0:09:26.236,000 --> 0:09:28,000
trying to imagine a trauma that didn't really happen

172
0:09:29.707,000 --> 0:09:31,000
in order to explain a feeling that really is happening.

173
0:09:32.502,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And in fact, it's an extremely dangerous feeling.

174
0:09:35.043,000 --> 0:09:37,000
That alienation and depression can lead to suicide.

175
0:09:37.807,000 --> 0:09:38,000
These people are in danger.

176
0:09:39.828,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It's very important to understand why.

177
0:09:43.167,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The Israeli military has a PTSD rate of around one percent.

178
0:09:47.65,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The theory is that everyone in Israel is supposed to serve in the military.

179
0:09:53.273,000 --> 0:09:55,000
When soldiers come back from the front line,

180
0:09:55.407,000 --> 0:09:59,000
they're not going from a military environment to a civilian environment.

181
0:10:00.741,000 --> 0:10:03,000
They're coming back to a community where everyone understands

182
0:10:05.698,000 --> 0:10:06,000
about the military.

183
0:10:06.877,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Everyone's been in it or is going to be in it.

184
0:10:09.056,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Everyone understands the situation they're all in.

185
0:10:11.436,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It's as if they're all in one big tribe.

186
0:10:14.282,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We know that if you take a lab rat

187
0:10:16.34,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and traumatize it and put it in a cage by itself,

188
0:10:20.036,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you can maintain its trauma symptoms almost indefinitely.

189
0:10:23.717,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And if you take that same lab rat and put it in a cage with other rats,

190
0:10:30.018,000 --> 0:10:33,000
after a couple of weeks, it's pretty much OK.

191
0:10:35.509,000 --> 0:10:36,000
After 9/11,

192
0:10:38.549,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the murder rate in New York City went down by 40 percent.

193
0:10:41.866,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The suicide rate went down.

194
0:10:44.756,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The violent crime rate in New York went down after 9/11.

195
0:10:49.284,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Even combat veterans of previous wars who suffered from PTSD

196
0:10:54.627,000 --> 0:10:58,000
said that their symptoms went down after 9/11 happened.

197
0:10:59.148,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The reason is that if you traumatize an entire society,

198
0:11:04.45,000 --> 0:11:07,000
we don't fall apart and turn on one another.

199
0:11:07.693,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We come together. We unify.

200
0:11:09.831,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Basically, we tribalize,

201
0:11:11.902,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and that process of unifying feels so good and is so good for us,

202
0:11:17.479,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that it even helps people

203
0:11:18.92,000 --> 0:11:21,000
who are struggling with mental health issues.

204
0:11:22.238,000 --> 0:11:23,000
During the blitz in London,

205
0:11:24.027,000 --> 0:11:29,000
admissions to psychiatric wards went down during the bombings.

206
0:11:30.606,000 --> 0:11:33,000
For a while, that was the kind of country

207
0:11:33.852,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that American soldiers came back to -- a unified country.

208
0:11:38.288,000 --> 0:11:39,000
We were sticking together.

209
0:11:39.583,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We were trying to understand the threat against us.

210
0:11:42.218,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We were trying to help ourselves and the world.

211
0:11:47.521,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But that's changed.

212
0:11:50.392,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Now, American soldiers,

213
0:11:52.762,000 --> 0:11:55,000
American veterans are coming back to a country that is so bitterly divided

214
0:11:57.716,000 --> 0:12:,000
that the two political parties are literally accusing each other

215
0:12:02.67,000 --> 0:12:04,000
of treason, of being an enemy of the state,

216
0:12:06.265,000 --> 0:12:1,000
of trying to undermine the security and the welfare of their own country.

217
0:12:11.049,000 --> 0:12:15,000
The gap between rich and poor is the biggest it's ever been.

218
0:12:15.206,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It's just getting worse.

219
0:12:16.415,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Race relations are terrible.

220
0:12:18.847,000 --> 0:12:2,000
There are demonstrations and even riots in the streets

221
0:12:21.727,000 --> 0:12:22,000
because of racial injustice.

222
0:12:24.727,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And veterans know that any tribe that treated itself that way -- in fact,

223
0:12:29.012,000 --> 0:12:33,000
any platoon that treated itself that way -- would never survive.

224
0:12:35.068,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We've gotten used to it.

225
0:12:36.983,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Veterans have gone away and are coming back

226
0:12:40.86,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and seeing their own country with fresh eyes.

227
0:12:45.325,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And they see what's going on.

228
0:12:47.738,000 --> 0:12:48,000
This is the country they fought for.

229
0:12:50.433,000 --> 0:12:51,000
No wonder they're depressed.

230
0:12:52.135,000 --> 0:12:53,000
No wonder they're scared.

231
0:12:55.371,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Sometimes, we ask ourselves if we can save the vets.

232
0:13:00.248,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I think the real question is if we can save ourselves.

233
0:13:03.905,000 --> 0:13:04,000
If we can,

234
0:13:05.619,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I think the vets are going to be fine.

235
0:13:08.697,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It's time for this country to unite,

236
0:13:13.818,000 --> 0:13:17,000
if only to help the men and women who fought to protect us.

237
0:13:19.182,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Thank you very much.

238
0:13:20.437,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Applause)

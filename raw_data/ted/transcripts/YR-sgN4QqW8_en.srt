1
0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:15,000
People use the internet for various reasons.

2
0:00:17.765,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It turns out that one of the most popular categories of website

3
0:00:21.593,000 --> 0:00:23,000
is something that people typically consume in private.

4
0:00:25.639,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It involves curiosity,

5
0:00:28.173,000 --> 0:00:31,000
non-insignificant levels of self-indulgence

6
0:00:31.993,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and is centered around recording the reproductive activities

7
0:00:35.277,000 --> 0:00:36,000
of other people.

8
0:00:36.61,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:37.666,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Of course, I'm talking about genealogy --

10
0:00:39.94,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:41.178,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the study of family history.

12
0:00:43.353,000 --> 0:00:45,000
When it comes to detailing family history,

13
0:00:45.414,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in every family, we have this person that is obsessed with genealogy.

14
0:00:49.381,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Let's call him Uncle Bernie.

15
0:00:51.118,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Uncle Bernie is exactly the last person you want to sit next to

16
0:00:54.924,000 --> 0:00:55,000
in Thanksgiving dinner,

17
0:00:56.547,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because he will bore you to death with peculiar details

18
0:00:59.385,000 --> 0:01:,000
about some ancient relatives.

19
0:01:02.462,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But as you know,

20
0:01:03.748,000 --> 0:01:05,000
there is a scientific side for everything,

21
0:01:06.644,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and we found that Uncle Bernie's stories

22
0:01:09.646,000 --> 0:01:12,000
have immense potential for biomedical research.

23
0:01:13.306,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We let Uncle Bernie and his fellow genealogists

24
0:01:16.044,000 --> 0:01:2,000
document their family trees through a genealogy website called geni.com.

25
0:01:21.198,000 --> 0:01:23,000
When users upload their trees to the website,

26
0:01:23.35,000 --> 0:01:24,000
it scans their relatives,

27
0:01:25.064,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and if it finds matches to existing trees,

28
0:01:27.163,000 --> 0:01:3,000
it merges the existing and the new tree together.

29
0:01:31.768,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The result is that large family trees are created,

30
0:01:34.742,000 --> 0:01:37,000
beyond the individual level of each genealogist.

31
0:01:38.808,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now, by repeating this process with millions of people

32
0:01:42.961,000 --> 0:01:43,000
all over the world,

33
0:01:44.802,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we can crowdsource the construction of a family tree of all humankind.

34
0:01:51.292,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Using this website,

35
0:01:52.9,000 --> 0:01:56,000
we were able to connect 125 million people

36
0:01:57.737,000 --> 0:01:59,000
into a single family tree.

37
0:02:00.967,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I cannot draw the tree on the screens over here

38
0:02:03.779,000 --> 0:02:05,000
because they have less pixels

39
0:02:05.968,000 --> 0:02:07,000
than the number of people in this tree.

40
0:02:08.505,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But here is an example of a subset of 6,000 individuals.

41
0:02:14.159,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Each green node is a person.

42
0:02:17.06,000 --> 0:02:19,000
The red nodes represent marriages,

43
0:02:19.933,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and the connections represent parenthood.

44
0:02:22.557,000 --> 0:02:24,000
In the middle of this tree, you see the ancestors.

45
0:02:24.953,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And as we go to the periphery, you see the descendants.

46
0:02:27.581,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This tree has seven generations, approximately.

47
0:02:31.692,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Now, this is what happens when we increase the number of individuals

48
0:02:34.95,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to 70,000 people --

49
0:02:36.802,000 --> 0:02:4,000
still a tiny subset of all the data that we have.

50
0:02:41.629,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Despite that, you can already see the formation of gigantic family trees

51
0:02:46.466,000 --> 0:02:48,000
with many very distant relatives.

52
0:02:49.61,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Thanks to the hard work of our genealogists,

53
0:02:52.768,000 --> 0:02:55,000
we can go back in time hundreds of years ago.

54
0:02:56.418,000 --> 0:02:59,000
For example, here is Alexander Hamilton,

55
0:02:59.883,000 --> 0:03:01,000
who was born in 1755.

56
0:03:02.872,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Alexander was the first US Secretary of the Treasury,

57
0:03:06.66,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but mostly known today due to a popular Broadway musical.

58
0:03:11.137,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We found that Alexander has deeper connections in the showbiz industry.

59
0:03:16.083,000 --> 0:03:18,000
In fact, he's a blood relative of ...

60
0:03:18.781,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Kevin Bacon!

61
0:03:20.025,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:22.081,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Both of them are descendants of a lady from Scotland

63
0:03:24.711,000 --> 0:03:26,000
who lived in the 13th century.

64
0:03:27.049,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So you can say that Alexander Hamilton

65
0:03:30.175,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is 35 degrees of Kevin Bacon genealogy.

66
0:03:33.387,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:34.852,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And our tree has millions of stories like that.

68
0:03:40.113,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We invested significant efforts to validate the quality of our data.

69
0:03:45.027,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Using DNA, we found that .3 percent of the mother-child connections in our data

70
0:03:50.442,000 --> 0:03:51,000
are wrong,

71
0:03:51.716,000 --> 0:03:54,000
which could match the adoption rate in the US pre-Second World War.

72
0:03:56.847,000 --> 0:03:57,000
For the father's side,

73
0:03:58.656,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the news is not as good:

74
0:04:02.149,000 --> 0:04:07,000
1.9 percent of the father-child connections in our data are wrong.

75
0:04:07.773,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And I see some people smirk over here.

76
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It is what you think --

77
0:04:11.901,000 --> 0:04:12,000
there are many milkmen out there.

78
0:04:13.714,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:14.802,000 --> 0:04:17,000
However, this 1.9 percent error rate in patrilineal connections

80
0:04:18.815,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is not unique to our data.

81
0:04:20.608,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Previous studies found a similar error rate

82
0:04:23.701,000 --> 0:04:25,000
using clinical-grade pedigrees.

83
0:04:26.254,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So the quality of our data is good,

84
0:04:28.803,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and that should not be a surprise.

85
0:04:30.96,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Our genealogists have a profound, vested interest

86
0:04:34.76,000 --> 0:04:37,000
in correctly documenting their family history.

87
0:04:40.594,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We can leverage this data to learn quantitative information about humanity,

88
0:04:45.209,000 --> 0:04:47,000
for example, questions about demography.

89
0:04:47.829,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Here is a look at all our profiles on the map of the world.

90
0:04:52.25,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Each pixel is a person that lived at some point.

91
0:04:56.755,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And since we have so much data,

92
0:04:58.459,000 --> 0:05:,000
you can see the contours of many countries,

93
0:05:01.264,000 --> 0:05:03,000
especially in the Western world.

94
0:05:03.387,000 --> 0:05:06,000
In this clip, we stratified the map that I've showed you

95
0:05:06.959,000 --> 0:05:11,000
based on the year of births of individuals from 1400 to 1900,

96
0:05:12.055,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and we compared it to known migration events.

97
0:05:15.482,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The clip is going to show you that the deepest lineages in our data

98
0:05:18.671,000 --> 0:05:19,000
go all the way back to the UK,

99
0:05:20.322,000 --> 0:05:21,000
where they had better record keeping,

100
0:05:22.154,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and then they spread along the routes of Western colonialism.

101
0:05:25.46,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Let's watch this.

102
0:05:27.143,000 --> 0:05:28,000

103

I love this movie.

111
0:05:57.418,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Now, since these migration events are giving the context of families,

112
0:06:02.535,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we can ask questions such as:

113
0:06:04.742,000 --> 0:06:07,000
What is the typical distance between the birth locations

114
0:06:08.236,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of husbands and wives?

115
0:06:11.072,000 --> 0:06:14,000
This distance plays a pivotal role in demography,

116
0:06:14.773,000 --> 0:06:17,000
because the patterns in which people migrate to form families

117
0:06:18.478,000 --> 0:06:21,000
determine how genes spread in geographical areas.

118
0:06:22.706,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We analyzed this distance using our data,

119
0:06:25.058,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and we found that in the old days,

120
0:06:27.372,000 --> 0:06:28,000
people had it easy.

121
0:06:28.626,000 --> 0:06:3,000
They just married someone in the village nearby.

122
0:06:31.958,000 --> 0:06:34,000
But the Industrial Revolution really complicated our love life.

123
0:06:35.687,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And today, with affordable flights and online social media,

124
0:06:40.271,000 --> 0:06:44,000
people typically migrate more than 100 kilometers from their place of birth

125
0:06:45.123,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to find their soul mate.

126
0:06:48.524,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So now you might ask:

127
0:06:49.735,000 --> 0:06:53,000
OK, but who does the hard work of migrating from places to places

128
0:06:54.255,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to form families?

129
0:06:55.548,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Are these the males or the females?

130
0:06:59.752,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We used our data to address this question,

131
0:07:01.931,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and at least in the last 300 years,

132
0:07:04.549,000 --> 0:07:07,000
we found that the ladies do the hard work

133
0:07:08.456,000 --> 0:07:1,000
of migrating from places to places to form families.

134
0:07:11.476,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Now, these results are statistically significant,

135
0:07:14.601,000 --> 0:07:17,000
so you can take it as scientific fact that males are lazy.

136
0:07:18.096,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

137
0:07:21.276,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We can move from questions about demography

138
0:07:23.836,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and ask questions about human health.

139
0:07:26.773,000 --> 0:07:27,000
For example, we can ask

140
0:07:28.284,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to what extent genetic variations account for differences in life span

141
0:07:33.271,000 --> 0:07:34,000
between individuals.

142
0:07:34.988,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Previous studies analyzed the correlation of longevity between twins

143
0:07:39.542,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to address this question.

144
0:07:41.411,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They estimated that the genetic variations account for

145
0:07:44.102,000 --> 0:07:48,000
about a quarter of the differences in life span between individuals.

146
0:07:48.688,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But twins can be correlated due to so many reasons,

147
0:07:51.31,000 --> 0:07:53,000
including various environmental effects

148
0:07:53.638,000 --> 0:07:54,000
or a shared household.

149
0:07:56.411,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Large family trees give us the opportunity to analyze both close relatives,

150
0:08:00.188,000 --> 0:08:01,000
such as twins,

151
0:08:01.419,000 --> 0:08:03,000
all the way to distant relatives, even fourth cousins.

152
0:08:04.749,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This way we can build robust models

153
0:08:07.462,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that can tease apart the contribution of genetic variations

154
0:08:11.194,000 --> 0:08:12,000
from environmental factors.

155
0:08:13.379,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We conducted this analysis using our data,

156
0:08:16.302,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and we found that genetic variations explain only 15 percent

157
0:08:22.117,000 --> 0:08:24,000
of the differences in life span between individuals.

158
0:08:26.76,000 --> 0:08:28,000
That is five years, on average.

159
0:08:30.316,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So genes matter less than what we thought before to life span.

160
0:08:35.675,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And I find it great news,

161
0:08:38.438,000 --> 0:08:41,000
because it means that our actions can matter more.

162
0:08:42.533,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Smoking, for example, determines 10 years of our life expectancy --

163
0:08:46.831,000 --> 0:08:48,000
twice as much as what genetics determines.

164
0:08:50.236,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We can even have more surprising findings

165
0:08:52.549,000 --> 0:08:53,000
as we move from family trees

166
0:08:54.065,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and we let our genealogists document and crowdsource DNA information.

167
0:08:58.821,000 --> 0:09:,000
And the results can be amazing.

168
0:09:01.255,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It might be hard to imagine, but Uncle Bernie and his friends

169
0:09:05.194,000 --> 0:09:07,000
can create DNA forensic capabilities

170
0:09:07.864,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that even exceed what the FBI currently has.

171
0:09:12.862,000 --> 0:09:14,000
When you place the DNA on a large family tree,

172
0:09:15.29,000 --> 0:09:17,000
you effectively create a beacon

173
0:09:17.431,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that illuminates the hundreds of distant relatives

174
0:09:20.089,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that are all connected to the person that originated the DNA.

175
0:09:24.505,000 --> 0:09:26,000
By placing multiple beacons on a large family tree,

176
0:09:27.442,000 --> 0:09:3,000
you can now triangulate the DNA of an unknown person,

177
0:09:31.186,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the same way that the GPS system uses multiple satellites

178
0:09:35.148,000 --> 0:09:36,000
to find a location.

179
0:09:37.226,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The prime example of the power of this technique

180
0:09:40.874,000 --> 0:09:42,000
is capturing the Golden State Killer,

181
0:09:44.612,000 --> 0:09:48,000
one of the most notorious criminals in the history of the US.

182
0:09:49.164,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The FBI had been searching for this person for over 40 years.

183
0:09:55.588,000 --> 0:09:56,000
They had his DNA,

184
0:09:57.447,000 --> 0:10:,000
but he never showed up in any police database.

185
0:10:01.447,000 --> 0:10:05,000
About a year ago, the FBI consulted a genetic genealogist,

186
0:10:06.183,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and she suggested that they submit his DNA to a genealogy service

187
0:10:10.157,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that can locate distant relatives.

188
0:10:13.117,000 --> 0:10:14,000
They did that,

189
0:10:14.297,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and they found a third cousin of the Golden State Killer.

190
0:10:18.013,000 --> 0:10:2,000
They built a large family tree,

191
0:10:20.381,000 --> 0:10:22,000
scanned the different branches of that tree,

192
0:10:22.507,000 --> 0:10:24,000
until they found a profile that exactly matched

193
0:10:25.096,000 --> 0:10:27,000
what they knew about the Golden State Killer.

194
0:10:27.701,000 --> 0:10:3,000
They obtained DNA from this person and found a perfect match

195
0:10:31.317,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to the DNA they had in hand.

196
0:10:33.366,000 --> 0:10:35,000
They arrested him and brought him to justice

197
0:10:35.74,000 --> 0:10:36,000
after all these years.

198
0:10:38.172,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Since then, genetic genealogists have started working with

199
0:10:41.437,000 --> 0:10:43,000
local US law enforcement agencies

200
0:10:44.129,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to use this technique in order to capture criminals.

201
0:10:47.521,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And only in the past six months,

202
0:10:50.226,000 --> 0:10:54,000
they were able to solve over 20 cold cases with this technique.

203
0:10:56.203,000 --> 0:11:,000
Luckily, we have people like Uncle Bernie and his fellow genealogists

204
0:11:01.045,000 --> 0:11:03,000
These are not amateurs with a self-serving hobby.

205
0:11:04.602,000 --> 0:11:1,000
These are citizen scientists with a deep passion to tell us who we are.

206
0:11:11.065,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And they know that the past can hold a key to the future.

207
0:11:16.067,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Thank you very much.

208
0:11:17.314,000 --> 0:11:2,000

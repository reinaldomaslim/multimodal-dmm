1
0:00:13.944,000 --> 0:00:16,000
As a roboticist, I get asked a lot of questions.

2
0:00:17.689,000 --> 0:00:19,000
"When we will they start serving me breakfast?"

3
0:00:21.049,000 --> 0:00:25,000
So I thought the future of robotics would be looking more like us.

4
0:00:28.114,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I thought they would look like me,

5
0:00:29.812,000 --> 0:00:32,000
so I built eyes that would simulate my eyes.

6
0:00:34.813,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I built fingers that are dextrous enough to serve me ...

7
0:00:39.893,000 --> 0:00:4,000
baseballs.

8
0:00:43.837,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Classical robots like this

9
0:00:45.878,000 --> 0:00:48,000
are built and become functional

10
0:00:49.078,000 --> 0:00:52,000
based on the fixed number of joints and actuators.

11
0:00:52.78,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And this means their functionality and shape are already fixed

12
0:00:57.139,000 --> 0:00:58,000
at the moment of their conception.

13
0:00:59.49,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So even though this arm has a really nice throw --

14
0:01:02.381,000 --> 0:01:04,000
it even hit the tripod at the end--

15
0:01:06.015,000 --> 0:01:09,000
it's not meant for cooking you breakfast per se.

16
0:01:09.202,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's not really suited for scrambled eggs.

17
0:01:12.863,000 --> 0:01:16,000
So this was when I was hit by a new vision of future robotics:

18
0:01:18.101,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the transformers.

19
0:01:20.989,000 --> 0:01:22,000
They drive, they run, they fly,

20
0:01:23.56,000 --> 0:01:27,000
all depending on the ever-changing, new environment and task at hand.

21
0:01:29.267,000 --> 0:01:3,000
To make this a reality,

22
0:01:31.072,000 --> 0:01:34,000
you really have to rethink how robots are designed.

23
0:01:35.448,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So, imagine a robotic module in a polygon shape

24
0:01:39.486,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and using that simple polygon shape

25
0:01:41.589,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to reconstruct multiple different forms

26
0:01:44.651,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to create a new form of robot for different tasks.

27
0:01:49.528,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In CG, computer graphics, it's not any news --

28
0:01:53.255,000 --> 0:01:56,000
it's been done for a while, and that's how most of the movies are made.

29
0:01:56.71,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But if you're trying to make a robot that's physically moving,

30
0:02:00.604,000 --> 0:02:01,000
it's a completely new story.

31
0:02:02.691,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It's a completely new paradigm.

32
0:02:06.307,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But you've all done this.

33
0:02:09.434,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Who hasn't made a paper airplane, paper boat, paper crane?

34
0:02:15.893,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Origami is a versatile platform for designers.

35
0:02:19.761,000 --> 0:02:23,000
From a single sheet of paper, you can make multiple shapes,

36
0:02:23.861,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and if you don't like it, you unfold and fold back again.

37
0:02:27.947,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Any 3D form can be made from 2D surfaces by folding,

38
0:02:33.987,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and this is proven mathematically.

39
0:02:38.555,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And imagine if you were to have an intelligent sheet

40
0:02:42.987,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that can self-fold into any form it wants,

41
0:02:46.57,000 --> 0:02:47,000
anytime.

42
0:02:48.322,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And that's what I've been working on.

43
0:02:50.6,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I call this robotic origami,

44
0:02:53.806,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"robogami."

45
0:02:57.387,000 --> 0:03:,000
This is our first robogami transformation

46
0:03:00.931,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that was made by me about 10 years ago.

47
0:03:04.264,000 --> 0:03:05,000
From a flat-sheeted robot,

48
0:03:06.055,000 --> 0:03:08,000
it turns into a pyramid and back into a flat sheet

49
0:03:09.026,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and into a space shuttle.

50
0:03:12.822,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Quite cute.

51
0:03:14.789,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Ten years later, with my group of ninja origami robotic researchers --

52
0:03:21.683,000 --> 0:03:22,000
about 22 of them right now --

53
0:03:24.332,000 --> 0:03:27,000
we have a new generation of robogamis,

54
0:03:27.764,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and they're a little more effective and they do more than that.

55
0:03:32.105,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So the new generation of robogamis actually serve a purpose.

56
0:03:35.412,000 --> 0:03:4,000
For example, this one actually navigates through different terrains autonomously.

57
0:03:40.635,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So when it's a dry and flat land, it crawls.

58
0:03:46.256,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And if it meets sudden rough terrain,

59
0:03:48.759,000 --> 0:03:49,000
it starts rolling.

60
0:03:50.02,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It does this -- it's the same robot --

61
0:03:52.496,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but depending on which terrain it meets,

62
0:03:55.543,000 --> 0:03:59,000
it activates a different sequence of actuators that's on board.

63
0:04:02.459,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And once it meets an obstacle, it jumps over it.

64
0:04:07.485,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It does this by storing energy in each of its legs

65
0:04:10.885,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and releasing it and catapulting like a slingshot.

66
0:04:14.785,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And it even does gymnastics.

67
0:04:17.688,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Yay.

68
0:04:18.883,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

69
0:04:20.828,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So I just showed you what a single robogami can do.

70
0:04:25.029,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Imagine what they can do as a group.

71
0:04:27.838,000 --> 0:04:31,000
They can join forces to tackle more complex tasks.

72
0:04:31.884,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Each module, either active or passive,

73
0:04:35.07,000 --> 0:04:38,000
we can assemble them to create different shapes.

74
0:04:38.661,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Not only that, by controlling the folding joints,

75
0:04:41.434,000 --> 0:04:45,000
we're able to create and attack different tasks.

76
0:04:46.006,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The form is making new task space.

77
0:04:49.736,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And this time, what's most important is the assembly.

78
0:04:54.192,000 --> 0:04:58,000
They need to autonomously find each other in a different space,

79
0:04:58.4,000 --> 0:05:02,000
attach and detach, depending on the environment and task.

80
0:05:03.616,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And we can do this now.

81
0:05:06.412,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So what's next?

82
0:05:07.863,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Our imagination.

83
0:05:09.704,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This is a simulation of what you can achieve

84
0:05:12.129,000 --> 0:05:13,000
with this type of module.

85
0:05:13.81,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We decided that we were going to have a four-legged crawler

86
0:05:18.87,000 --> 0:05:21,000
turn into a little dog and make small gaits.

87
0:05:22.073,000 --> 0:05:25,000
With the same module, we can actually make it do something else:

88
0:05:25.931,000 --> 0:05:28,000
a manipulator, a typical, classical robotic task.

89
0:05:29.373,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So with a manipulator, it can pick up an object.

90
0:05:32.096,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Of course, you can add more modules to make the manipulator legs longer

91
0:05:36.164,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to attack or pick up objects that are bigger or smaller,

92
0:05:39.911,000 --> 0:05:4,000
or even have a third arm.

93
0:05:43.545,000 --> 0:05:47,000
For robogamis, there's no one fixed shape nor task.

94
0:05:48.628,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They can transform into anything, anywhere, anytime.

95
0:05:54.408,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So how do you make them?

96
0:05:57.108,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The biggest technical challenge of robogami is keeping them super thin,

97
0:06:02.449,000 --> 0:06:03,000
flexible,

98
0:06:03.624,000 --> 0:06:05,000
but still remaining functional.

99
0:06:06.562,000 --> 0:06:09,000
They're composed of multiple layers of circuits, motors,

100
0:06:10.398,000 --> 0:06:12,000
microcontrollers and sensors,

101
0:06:12.84,000 --> 0:06:13,000
all in the single body,

102
0:06:14.718,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and when you control individual folding joints,

103
0:06:18.063,000 --> 0:06:21,000
you'll be able to achieve soft motions like that

104
0:06:21.613,000 --> 0:06:22,000
upon your command.

105
0:06:26.013,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Instead of being a single robot that is specifically made for a single task,

106
0:06:30.896,000 --> 0:06:33,000
robogamis are optimized to do multi-tasks.

107
0:06:35.366,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And this is quite important

108
0:06:37.147,000 --> 0:06:4,000
for the difficult and unique environments on the Earth

109
0:06:41.002,000 --> 0:06:43,000
as well as in space.

110
0:06:45.782,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Space is a perfect environment for robogamis.

111
0:06:49.673,000 --> 0:06:53,000
You cannot afford to have one robot for one task.

112
0:06:54.966,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Who knows how many tasks you will encounter in space?

113
0:06:58.846,000 --> 0:07:04,000
What you want is a single robotic platform that can transform to do multi-tasks.

114
0:07:07.188,000 --> 0:07:12,000
What we want is a deck of thin robogami modules

115
0:07:12.324,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that can transform to do multiples of performing tasks.

116
0:07:18.322,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And don't take my word for it,

117
0:07:21.556,000 --> 0:07:24,000
because the European Space Agency and Swiss Space Center

118
0:07:24.616,000 --> 0:07:26,000
are sponsoring this exact concept.

119
0:07:27.562,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So here you see a couple of images of reconfiguration of robogamis,

120
0:07:32.631,000 --> 0:07:35,000
exploring the foreign land aboveground, on the surface,

121
0:07:36.433,000 --> 0:07:37,000
as well as digging into the surface.

122
0:07:39.117,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's not just exploration.

123
0:07:41.22,000 --> 0:07:43,000
For astronauts, they need additional help,

124
0:07:43.832,000 --> 0:07:45,000
because you cannot afford to bring interns up there, either.

125
0:07:46.69,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Laughter)

126
0:07:48.357,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They have to do every tedious task.

127
0:07:51.262,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They may be simple,

128
0:07:52.504,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but super interactive.

129
0:07:54.762,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So you need robots to facilitate their experiments,

130
0:07:58.198,000 --> 0:08:,000
assisting them with the communications

131
0:08:00.533,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and just docking onto surfaces to be their third arm holding different tools.

132
0:08:07.245,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But how will they be able to control robogamis, for example,

133
0:08:10.402,000 --> 0:08:11,000
outside the space station?

134
0:08:11.979,000 --> 0:08:15,000
In this case, I show a robogami that is holding space debris.

135
0:08:16.04,000 --> 0:08:19,000
You can work with your vision so that you can control them,

136
0:08:19.668,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but what would be better is having the sensation of touch

137
0:08:24.154,000 --> 0:08:27,000
directly transported onto the hands of the astronauts.

138
0:08:28.248,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And what you need is a haptic device,

139
0:08:30.695,000 --> 0:08:33,000
a haptic interface that recreates the sensation of touch.

140
0:08:35.051,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And using robogamis, we can do this.

141
0:08:39.276,000 --> 0:08:43,000
This is the world's smallest haptic interface

142
0:08:44.316,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that can recreate a sensation of touch just underneath your fingertip.

143
0:08:50.104,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We do this by moving the robogami

144
0:08:52.705,000 --> 0:08:56,000
by microscopic and macroscopic movements at the stage.

145
0:08:57.812,000 --> 0:09:,000
And by having this, not only will you be able to feel

146
0:09:01.466,000 --> 0:09:02,000
how big the object is,

147
0:09:03.229,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the roundness and the lines,

148
0:09:06.139,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but also the stiffness and the texture.

149
0:09:11.019,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Alex has this interface just underneath his thumb,

150
0:09:15.032,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and if he were to use this with VR goggles and hand controllers,

151
0:09:19.868,000 --> 0:09:22,000
now the virtual reality is no longer virtual.

152
0:09:23.521,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It becomes a tangible reality.

153
0:09:28.529,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The blue ball, red ball and black ball that he's looking at

154
0:09:32.24,000 --> 0:09:34,000
is no longer differentiated by colors.

155
0:09:34.73,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Now it is a rubber blue ball, sponge red ball and billiard black ball.

156
0:09:40.642,000 --> 0:09:41,000
This is now possible.

157
0:09:43.263,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Let me show you.

158
0:09:46.15,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This is really the first time this is shown live

159
0:09:50.343,000 --> 0:09:52,000
in front of a public grand audience,

160
0:09:53.213,000 --> 0:09:54,000
so hopefully this works.

161
0:09:55.668,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So what you see here is an atlas of anatomy

162
0:09:59.993,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and the robogami haptic interface.

163
0:10:02.81,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So, like all the other reconfigurable robots,

164
0:10:05.379,000 --> 0:10:06,000
it multitasks.

165
0:10:06.578,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Not only is it going to serve as a mouse,

166
0:10:08.625,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but also a haptic interface.

167
0:10:11.381,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So for example, we have a white background where there is no object.

168
0:10:15.179,000 --> 0:10:17,000
That means there is nothing to feel,

169
0:10:17.255,000 --> 0:10:2,000
so we can have a very, very flexible interface.

170
0:10:21.352,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Now, I use this as a mouse to approach skin,

171
0:10:24.528,000 --> 0:10:25,000
a muscular arm,

172
0:10:25.815,000 --> 0:10:27,000
so now let's feel his biceps,

173
0:10:27.855,000 --> 0:10:28,000
or shoulders.

174
0:10:29.367,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So now you see how much stiffer it becomes.

175
0:10:32.401,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Let's explore even more.

176
0:10:33.796,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Let's approach the ribcage.

177
0:10:36.73,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And as soon as I move on top of the ribcage

178
0:10:39.316,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and between the intercostal muscles,

179
0:10:41.625,000 --> 0:10:42,000
which is softer and harder,

180
0:10:43.198,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I can feel the difference of the stiffness.

181
0:10:45.458,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Take my word for it.

182
0:10:46.808,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So now you see, it's much stiffer in terms of the force

183
0:10:51.035,000 --> 0:10:52,000
it's giving back to my fingertip.

184
0:10:53.822,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So I showed you the surfaces that aren't moving.

185
0:10:57.824,000 --> 0:11:,000
How about if I were to approach something that moves,

186
0:11:01.401,000 --> 0:11:03,000
for example, like a beating heart?

187
0:11:03.492,000 --> 0:11:04,000
What would I feel?

188
0:11:11.573,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Applause)

189
0:11:19.158,000 --> 0:11:21,000
This can be your beating heart.

190
0:11:22.01,000 --> 0:11:25,000
This can actually be inside your pocket

191
0:11:25.644,000 --> 0:11:26,000
while you're shopping online.

192
0:11:28.361,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Now you'll be able to feel the difference of the sweater that you're buying,

193
0:11:32.174,000 --> 0:11:33,000
how soft it is,

194
0:11:33.42,000 --> 0:11:35,000
if it's actually cashmere or not,

195
0:11:36.28,000 --> 0:11:38,000
or the bagel that you're trying to buy,

196
0:11:38.36,000 --> 0:11:41,000
how hard it is or how crispy it is.

197
0:11:42.229,000 --> 0:11:43,000
This is now possible.

198
0:11:46.774,000 --> 0:11:51,000
The robotics technology is advancing to be more personalized and adaptive,

199
0:11:52.61,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to adapt to our everyday needs.

200
0:11:56.457,000 --> 0:11:59,000
This unique specie of reconfigurable robotics

201
0:12:00.106,000 --> 0:12:05,000
is actually the platform to provide this invisible, intuitive interface

202
0:12:06.108,000 --> 0:12:08,000
to meet our exact needs.

203
0:12:10.169,000 --> 0:12:14,000
These robots will no longer look like the characters from the movies.

204
0:12:14.843,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Instead, they will be whatever you want them to be.

205
0:12:19.223,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Thank you.

206
0:12:20.453,000 --> 0:12:23,000
(Applause)

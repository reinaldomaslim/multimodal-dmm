1
0:00:15.33,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want to talk to you

2
0:00:17.33,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about one of the biggest myths in medicine,

3
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and that is the idea

4
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that all we need are more medical breakthroughs

5
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and then all of our problems will be solved.

6
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Our society loves to romanticize

7
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the idea of the single, solo inventor

8
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
who, working late in the lab one night,

9
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
makes an earthshaking discovery,

10
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and voila, overnight everything's changed.

11
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That's a very appealing picture,

12
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
however, it's just not true.

13
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
In fact, medicine today is a team sport.

14
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And in many ways,

15
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
it always has been.

16
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I'd like to share with you a story

17
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
about how I've experienced this very dramatically

18
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
in my own work.

19
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I'm a surgeon,

20
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and we surgeons have always had

21
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
this special relationship with light.

22
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
When I make an incision inside a patient's body, it's dark.

23
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We need to shine light to see what we're doing.

24
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And this is why, traditionally,

25
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
surgeries have always started so early in the morning --

26
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to take advantage of daylight hours.

27
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And if you look at historical pictures

28
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
of the early operating rooms,

29
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
they have been on top of buildings.

30
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
For example, this is the oldest operating room in the Western world,

31
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in London,

32
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
where the operating room

33
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is actually on top of a church

34
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
with a skylight coming in.

35
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And then this is a picture

36
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
of one of the most famous hospitals in America.

37
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This is Mass General in Boston.

38
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And do you know where the operating room is?

39
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Here it is

40
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
on the top of the building

41
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
with plenty of windows to let light in.

42
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So nowadays in the operating room,

43
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
we no longer need to use sunlight.

44
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And because we no longer need to use sunlight,

45
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
we have very specialized lights

46
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that are made for the operating room.

47
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We have an opportunity

48
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to bring in other kinds of lights --

49
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
lights that can allow us to see

50
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
what we currently don't see.

51
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And this is what I think

52
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is the magic of fluorescence.

53
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So let me back up a little bit.

54
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
When we are in medical school,

55
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
we learn our anatomy from illustrations such as this

56
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
where everything's color-coded.

57
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Nerves are yellow, arteries are red,

58
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
veins are blue.

59
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
That's so easy anybody could become a surgeon, right?

60
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
However, when we have a real patient on the table,

61
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
this is the same neck dissection --

62
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
not so easy to tell the difference

63
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
between different structures.

64
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We heard over the last couple days

65
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
what an urgent problem

66
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
cancer still is in our society,

67
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
what a pressing need it is

68
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
for us to not have

69
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
one person die every minute.

70
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Well if cancer can be caught early,

71
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
enough such that someone can have their cancer taken out,

72
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
excised with surgery,

73
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I don't care if it has this gene or that gene,

74
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
or if it has this protein or that protein,

75
0:03:17.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
it's in the jar.

76
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's done, it's out, you're cured of cancer.

77
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
This is how we excise cancers.

78
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We do our best, based upon our training

79
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and the way the cancer looks and the way it feels

80
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and its relationship to other structures and all of our experience,

81
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
we say, you know what, the cancer's gone.

82
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We've made a good job. We've taken it out.

83
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
That's what the surgeon is saying in the operating room

84
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
when the patient's on the table.

85
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But then we actually don't know that it's all out.

86
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
We actually have to take samples from the surgical bed,

87
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
what's left behind in the patient,

88
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and then send those bits to the pathology lab.

89
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
In the meanwhile, the patient's on the operating room table.

90
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The nurses, anesthesiologist, the surgeon,

91
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
all the assistants are waiting around.

92
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And we wait.

93
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The pathologist takes that sample,

94
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
freezes it, cuts it, looks in the microscope one by one

95
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and then calls back into the room.

96
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And that may be 20 minutes later per piece.

97
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So if you've sent three specimens,

98
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
it's an hour later.

99
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And very often they say,

100
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
"You know what, points A and B are okay,

101
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but point C, you still have some residual cancer there.

102
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Please go cut that piece out."

103
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So we go back and we do that again, and again.

104
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And this whole process:

105
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"Okay you're done.

106
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
We think the entire tumor is out."

107
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But very often several days later,

108
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
the patient's gone home,

109
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we get a phone call:

110
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
"I'm sorry,

111
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
once we looked at the final pathology,

112
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
once we looked at the final specimen,

113
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
we actually found that there's a couple other spots

114
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
where the margins are positive.

115
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
There's still cancer in your patient."

116
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
So now you're faced with telling your patient, first of all,

117
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that they may need another surgery,

118
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
or that they need additional therapy

119
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
such as radiation or chemotherapy.

120
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So wouldn't it be better

121
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
if we could really tell,

122
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
if the surgeon could really tell,

123
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
whether or not there's still cancer on the surgical field?

124
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I mean, in many ways, the way that we're doing it,

125
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we're still operating in the dark.

126
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So in 2004, during my surgical residency,

127
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I had the great fortune

128
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to meet Dr. Roger Tsien,

129
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
who went on to win the Nobel Prize for chemistry

130
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
in 2008.

131
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Roger and his team

132
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
were working on a way to detect cancer,

133
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and they had a very clever molecule

134
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that they had come up with.

135
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The molecule they had developed

136
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
had three parts.

137
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The main part of it is the blue part, polycation,

138
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and it's basically very sticky

139
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to every tissue in your body.

140
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
So imagine that you make a solution

141
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
full of this sticky material

142
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and inject it into the veins of someone who has cancer,

143
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
everything's going to get lit up.

144
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Nothing will be specific.

145
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
There's no specificity there.

146
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So they added two additional components.

147
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The first one is a polyanionic segment,

148
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
which basically acts as a non-stick backing

149
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
like the back of a sticker.

150
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So when those two are together, the molecule is neutral

151
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and nothing gets stuck down.

152
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And the two pieces are then linked

153
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
by something that can only be cut

154
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
if you have the right molecular scissors --

155
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for example, the kind of protease enzymes

156
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that tumors make.

157
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So here in this situation,

158
0:06:38.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
if you make a solution full of this three-part molecule

159
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
along with the dye, which is shown in green,

160
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and you inject it into the vein

161
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
of someone who has cancer,

162
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
normal tissue can't cut it.

163
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The molecule passes through and gets excreted.

164
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
However, in the presence of the tumor,

165
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
now there are molecular scissors

166
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
that can break this molecule apart

167
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
right there at the cleavable site.

168
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And now, boom,

169
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the tumor labels itself

170
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and it gets fluorescent.

171
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So here's an example of a nerve

172
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that has tumor surrounding it.

173
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Can you tell where the tumor is?

174
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I couldn't when I was working on this.

175
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But here it is. It's fluorescent.

176
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Now it's green.

177
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
See, so every single one in the audience

178
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
now can tell where the cancer is.

179
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We can tell in the operating room, in the field,

180
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
at a molecular level,

181
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
where is the cancer and what the surgeon needs to do

182
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and how much more work they need to do

183
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to cut that out.

184
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And the cool thing about fluorescence

185
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is that it's not only bright,

186
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
it actually can shine through tissue.

187
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The light that the fluorescence emits

188
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
can go through tissue.

189
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So even if the tumor is not right on the surface,

190
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
you'll still be able to see it.

191
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
In this movie, you can see

192
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that the tumor is green.

193
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
There's actually normal muscle on top of it. See that?

194
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And I'm peeling that muscle away.

195
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
But even before I peel that muscle away,

196
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
you saw that there was a tumor underneath.

197
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So that's the beauty of having a tumor

198
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that's labeled with fluorescent molecules.

199
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
That you can, not only see the margins

200
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
right there on a molecular level,

201
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but you can see it even if it's not right on the top --

202
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
even if it's beyond your field of view.

203
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And this works for metastatic lymph nodes also.

204
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Sentinel lymph node dissection

205
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
has really changed the way that we manage breast cancer, melanoma.

206
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Women used to get

207
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
really debilitating surgeries

208
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to excise all of the axillary lymph nodes.

209
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But when sentinel lymph node

210
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
came into our treatment protocol,

211
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the surgeon basically looks for the single node

212
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that is the first draining lymph node of the cancer.

213
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And then if that node has cancer,

214
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
the woman would go on to get

215
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the axillary lymph node dissection.

216
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So what that means

217
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
is if the lymph node did not have cancer,

218
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
the woman would be saved

219
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
from having unnecessary surgery.

220
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But sentinel lymph node, the way that we do it today,

221
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is kind of like having a road map

222
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
just to know where to go.

223
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So if you're driving on the freeway

224
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and you want to know where's the next gas station,

225
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
you have a map to tell you that that gas station is down the road.

226
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It doesn't tell you whether or not

227
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
the gas station has gas.

228
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
You have to cut it out, bring it back home,

229
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
cut it up, look inside

230
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and say, "Oh yes, it does have gas."

231
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So that takes more time.

232
0:09:41.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Patients are still on the operating room table.

233
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Anesthesiologists, surgeons are waiting around.

234
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
That takes time.

235
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
So with our technology, we can tell right away.

236
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
You see a lot of little, roundish bumps there.

237
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Some of these are swollen lymph nodes

238
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that look a little larger than others.

239
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Who amongst us hasn't had swollen lymph nodes with a cold?

240
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
That doesn't mean that there's cancer inside.

241
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Well with our technology,

242
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the surgeon is able to tell immediately

243
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
which nodes have cancer.

244
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I won't go into this very much,

245
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but our technology, besides being able

246
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to tag tumor and metastatic lymph nodes with fluorescence,

247
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
we can also use the same smart three-part molecule

248
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to tag gadolinium onto the system

249
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
so you can do this noninvasively.

250
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
The patient has cancer,

251
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
you want to know if the lymph nodes have cancer

252
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
even before you go in.

253
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Well you can see this on an MRI.

254
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So in surgery,

255
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
it's important to know what to cut out.

256
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But equally important

257
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
is to preserve things

258
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that are important for function.

259
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So it's very important to avoid inadvertent injury.

260
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And what I'm talking about

261
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
are nerves.

262
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Nerves, if they are injured,

263
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
can cause paralysis,

264
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:03,000
can cause pain.

265
0:11:03.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
In the setting of prostate cancer,

266
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
up to 60 percent of men

267
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
after prostate cancer surgery

268
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
may have urinary incontinence

269
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and erectile disfunction.

270
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
That's a lot of people to have a lot of problems --

271
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and this is even in

272
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
so-called nerve-sparing surgery,

273
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
which means that the surgeon is aware of the problem,

274
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and they are trying to avoid the nerves.

275
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But you know what, these little nerves are so small,

276
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
in the context of prostate cancer,

277
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that they are actually never seen.

278
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
They are traced

279
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
just by their known anatomical path

280
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
along vasculature.

281
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And they're known because somebody has decided to study them,

282
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
which means that we're still learning

283
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:48,000
about where they are.

284
0:11:48.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Crazy to think that we're having surgery,

285
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
we're trying to excise cancer, we don't know where the cancer is.

286
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:57,000
We're trying to preserve nerves; we can't see where they are.

287
0:11:57.33,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So I said, wouldn't it be great

288
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
if we could find a way

289
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to see nerves with fluorescence?

290
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And at first this didn't get a lot of support.

291
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
People said, "We've been doing it this way for all these years.

292
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
What's the problem?

293
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We haven't had that many complications."

294
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But I went ahead anyway.

295
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And Roger helped me.

296
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And he brought his whole team with him.

297
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So there's that teamwork thing again.

298
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And we eventually discovered molecules

299
0:12:29.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that were specifically labeling nerves.

300
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And when we made a solution of this,

301
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
tagged with the fluorescence

302
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and injected in the body of a mouse,

303
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
their nerves literally glowed.

304
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
You can see where they are.

305
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Here you're looking at a sciatic nerve of a mouse,

306
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and you can see that that big, fat portion you can see very easily.

307
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
But in fact, at the tip of that where I'm dissecting now,

308
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
there's actually very fine arborizations

309
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that can't really be seen.

310
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
You see what looks like little Medusa heads coming out.

311
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We have been able to see nerves

312
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
for facial expression, for facial movement, for breathing --

313
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
every single nerve --

314
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
nerves for urinary function around the prostate.

315
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We've been able to see every single nerve.

316
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
When we put these two probes together ...

317
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So here's a tumor.

318
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Do you guys know where the margins of this tumor is?

319
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Now you do.

320
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
What about the nerve that's going into this tumor?

321
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
That white portion there is easy to see.

322
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
But what about the part that goes into the tumor?

323
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Do you know where it's going?

324
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Now you do.

325
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Basically, we've come up with a way

326
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
to stain tissue

327
0:13:41.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and color-code the surgical field.

328
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
This was a bit of a breakthrough.

329
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I think that it'll change the way that we do surgery.

330
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We published our results

331
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
in the proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences

332
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and in Nature Biotechnology.

333
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
We received commentary in Discover magazine,

334
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in The Economist.

335
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And we showed it to a lot of my surgical colleagues.

336
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
They said, "Wow!

337
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I have patients

338
0:14:08.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
who would benefit from this.

339
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I think that this will result in my surgeries

340
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
with a better outcome

341
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and fewer complications."

342
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
What needs to happen now

343
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
is further development of our technology

344
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
along with development

345
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
of the instrumentation

346
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
that allows us to see

347
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
this sort of fluorescence in the operating room.

348
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:33,000
The eventual goal

349
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
is that we'll get this into patients.

350
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
However, we've discovered

351
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
that there's actually no straightforward mechanism

352
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to develop a molecule

353
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
for one-time use.

354
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Understandably, the majority of the medical industry

355
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
is focused on multiple-use drugs,

356
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
such as long-term daily medications.

357
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
We are focused on making this technology better.

358
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
We're focused on adding drugs,

359
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
adding growth factors,

360
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
killing nerves that are causing problems

361
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and not the surrounding tissue.

362
0:15:08.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
We know that this can be done and we're committed to doing it.

363
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I'd like to leave you with this final thought.

364
0:15:16.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Successful innovation

365
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:21,000
is not a single breakthrough.

366
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It is not a sprint.

367
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
It is not an event for the solo runner.

368
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Successful innovation

369
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
is a team sport, it's a relay race.

370
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
It requires one team for the breakthrough

371
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and another team

372
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
to get the breakthrough accepted and adopted.

373
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And this takes the long-term steady courage

374
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
of the day-in day-out struggle

375
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
to educate, to persuade

376
0:15:49.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and to win acceptance.

377
0:15:52.33,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And that is the light that I want to shine

378
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
on health and medicine today.

379
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Thank you very much.

380
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:15.766,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I would like to talk to you about

3
0:00:17.62,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a very special group of animals.

4
0:00:20.252,000 --> 0:00:24,000
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.

5
0:00:24.253,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds.

6
0:00:28.861,000 --> 0:00:31,000
When you see a vulture like this, the first thing

7
0:00:31.873,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that comes to your mind is, these are disgusting, ugly,

8
0:00:35.849,000 --> 0:00:37,000
greedy creatures that are just after your flesh,

9
0:00:38.808,000 --> 0:00:45,000
associated with politicians. (Laughter) (Applause)

10
0:00:46.135,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I want to change that perception. I want to change

11
0:00:48.91,000 --> 0:00:5,000
those feelings you have for these birds, because

12
0:00:51.62,000 --> 0:00:54,000
they need our sympathy. They really do. (Laughter)

13
0:00:54.67,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And I'll tell you why.

14
0:00:56.219,000 --> 0:00:59,000
First of all, why do they have such a bad press?

15
0:00:59.811,000 --> 0:01:02,000
When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832

16
0:01:03.798,000 --> 0:01:06,000
on the Beagle, he saw the turkey vulture,

17
0:01:06.99,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and he said, "These are disgusting birds

18
0:01:09.83,000 --> 0:01:15,000
with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity." (Laughter)

19
0:01:15.891,000 --> 0:01:19,000
You could not get a worse insult, and that from Charles Darwin. (Laughter)

20
0:01:20.461,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You know, he changed his mind when he came back,

21
0:01:23.322,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and I'll tell you why.

22
0:01:24.638,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They've also be associated with Disney — (Laughter) —

23
0:01:27.929,000 --> 0:01:31,000
personified as goofy, dumb, stupid characters.

24
0:01:32.721,000 --> 0:01:35,000
More recently, if you've been following the Kenyan press

25
0:01:36.297,000 --> 0:01:43,000
— (Laughter) (Applause) (Cheers) —

26
0:01:43.416,000 --> 0:01:46,000
these are the attributes that they associated

27
0:01:46.768,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the Kenyan MPs with. But I want to challenge that.

28
0:01:50.08,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I want to challenge that. Do you know why?

29
0:01:52.632,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Because MPs

30
0:01:55.352,000 --> 0:01:59,000
do not keep the environment clean. (Laughter)

31
0:02:00.223,000 --> 0:02:04,000
MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases.

32
0:02:05.185,000 --> 0:02:11,000
They are hardly monogamous. (Laughter) (Applause)

33
0:02:11.534,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They are far from being extinct. (Laughter)

34
0:02:15.297,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And, my favorite is, vultures are better looking. (Applause) (Laughter)

35
0:02:22.198,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So there's two types of vultures in this planet.

36
0:02:26.149,000 --> 0:02:28,000
There are the New World vultures that are mainly found

37
0:02:28.422,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in the Americas, like the condors and the caracaras,

38
0:02:31.363,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and then the Old World vultures, where we have

39
0:02:33.662,000 --> 0:02:36,000
16 species. From these 16, 11 of them are facing

40
0:02:37.15,000 --> 0:02:4,000
a high risk of extinction.

41
0:02:40.237,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So why are vultures important? First of all,

42
0:02:43.654,000 --> 0:02:46,000
they provide vital ecological services. They clean up.

43
0:02:47.135,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They're our natural garbage collectors.

44
0:02:49.429,000 --> 0:02:51,000
They clean up carcasses right to the bone.

45
0:02:52.062,000 --> 0:02:55,000
They help to kill all the bacteria. They help absorb anthrax

46
0:02:55.7,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that would otherwise spread and cause

47
0:02:58.373,000 --> 0:03:02,000
huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals.

48
0:03:02.457,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are

49
0:03:05.196,000 --> 0:03:08,000
no vultures, carcasses take up to three to four times

50
0:03:08.199,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to decompose, and this has huge ramifications

51
0:03:10.768,000 --> 0:03:12,000
for the spread of diseases.

52
0:03:13.663,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Vultures also have tremendous historical significance.

53
0:03:17.079,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture.

54
0:03:20.323,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector

55
0:03:23.423,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and the motherhood, and together with the cobra,

56
0:03:26.511,000 --> 0:03:3,000
symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt.

57
0:03:30.625,000 --> 0:03:33,000
In Hindu mythology, Jatayu was the vulture god,

58
0:03:34.433,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita

59
0:03:39.705,000 --> 0:03:41,000
from the 10-headed demon Ravana.

60
0:03:42.362,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In Tibetan culture, they are performing very important

61
0:03:45.793,000 --> 0:03:47,000
sky burials. In places like Tibet, there are no places

62
0:03:48.505,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to bury the dead, or wood to cremate them,

63
0:03:51.569,000 --> 0:03:55,000
so these vultures provide a natural disposal system.

64
0:03:55.757,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So what is the problem with vultures?

65
0:03:58.224,000 --> 0:04:,000
We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya,

66
0:04:01.095,000 --> 0:04:04,000
of which six are highly threatened with extinction.

67
0:04:05.082,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The reason is that they're getting poisoned, and the reason

68
0:04:07.701,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that they're getting poisoned is because there's

69
0:04:10.293,000 --> 0:04:12,000
human-wildlife conflicts. The pastoral communities

70
0:04:12.981,000 --> 0:04:15,000
are using this poison to target predators,

71
0:04:16.333,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and in return, the vultures are falling victim to this.

72
0:04:19.968,000 --> 0:04:21,000
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan,

73
0:04:22.632,000 --> 0:04:25,000
four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered,

74
0:04:26.113,000 --> 0:04:29,000
which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct,

75
0:04:29.464,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and the reason is because they are falling prey

76
0:04:32.774,000 --> 0:04:34,000
by consuming livestock that has been treated

77
0:04:35.222,000 --> 0:04:37,000
with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac.

78
0:04:37.894,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India,

79
0:04:40.991,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and they have taken a stand.

80
0:04:43.51,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Because there are no vultures, there's been a spread

81
0:04:45.83,000 --> 0:04:47,000
in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites,

82
0:04:48.631,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and when you have feral dogs, you have a huge time bomb

83
0:04:51.812,000 --> 0:04:53,000
of rabies. The number of cases of rabies

84
0:04:54.454,000 --> 0:04:56,000
has increased tremendously in India.

85
0:04:57.182,000 --> 0:05:,000
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa:

86
0:05:00.627,000 --> 0:05:03,000
353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana.

87
0:05:03.863,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I am not against wind energy, but we need to work

88
0:05:06.143,000 --> 0:05:09,000
with the governments, because wind turbines

89
0:05:09.352,000 --> 0:05:11,000
do this to birds. They slice them in half.

90
0:05:11.952,000 --> 0:05:13,000
They are bird-blending machines.

91
0:05:14.786,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In West Africa, there's a horrific trade

92
0:05:17.464,000 --> 0:05:22,000
of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market.

93
0:05:22.835,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So what's being done? Well, we're conducting research

94
0:05:25.667,000 --> 0:05:28,000
on these birds. We're putting transmitters on them.

95
0:05:28.947,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We're trying to determine their basic ecology,

96
0:05:31.323,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and see where they go.

97
0:05:33.762,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We can see that they travel different countries, so

98
0:05:35.803,000 --> 0:05:38,000
if you focus on a problem locally, it's not going to help you.

99
0:05:39.099,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We need to work with governments in regional levels.

100
0:05:41.806,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We're working with local communities.

101
0:05:44.742,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We're talking to them about appreciating vultures,

102
0:05:47.884,000 --> 0:05:49,000
about the need from within to appreciate these

103
0:05:50.439,000 --> 0:05:53,000
wonderful creatures and the services that they provide.

104
0:05:53.476,000 --> 0:05:56,000
How can you help? You can become active,

105
0:05:56.489,000 --> 0:05:58,000
make noise. You can write a letter to your government

106
0:05:59.212,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and tell them that we need to focus on these very

107
0:06:01.522,000 --> 0:06:04,000
misunderstood creatures. Volunteer your time

108
0:06:04.7,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to spread the word. Spread the word.

109
0:06:07.316,000 --> 0:06:09,000
When you walk out of this room, you will be informed

110
0:06:09.66,000 --> 0:06:11,000
about vultures, but speak to your families, to your children,

111
0:06:12.46,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to your neighbors about vultures.

112
0:06:14.621,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They are very graceful. Charles Darwin said

113
0:06:17.684,000 --> 0:06:2,000
he changed his mind because he watched them fly

114
0:06:20.713,000 --> 0:06:23,000
effortlessly without energy in the skies.

115
0:06:23.978,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Kenya, this world, will be much poorer

116
0:06:26.857,000 --> 0:06:28,000
without these wonderful species.

117
0:06:29.442,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

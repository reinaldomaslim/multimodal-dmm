1
0:00:12.817,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Architecture is amazing, for sure.

2
0:00:17.357,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's amazing because it's art.

3
0:00:20.659,000 --> 0:00:22,000
But you know, it's a very funny kind of art.

4
0:00:23.061,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's an art at the frontier between art and science.

5
0:00:27.593,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It's fed by ...

6
0:00:31.053,000 --> 0:00:32,000
by real life, every day.

7
0:00:33.631,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It's driven by force of necessity.

8
0:00:37.313,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Quite amazing, quite amazing.

9
0:00:39.861,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And the life of the architect is also amazing.

10
0:00:45.048,000 --> 0:00:48,000
You know, as an architect, at 10 o’clock in the morning,

11
0:00:48.199,000 --> 0:00:51,000
you need to be a poet, for sure.

12
0:00:51.333,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But at 11,

13
0:00:53.765,000 --> 0:00:55,000
you must become a humanist,

14
0:00:56.395,000 --> 0:00:58,000
otherwise you'd lose your direction.

15
0:00:59.792,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And at noon, you absolutely need to be a builder.

16
0:01:04.936,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You need to be able to make a building,

17
0:01:08.491,000 --> 0:01:12,000
because architecture, at the end, is the art of making buildings.

18
0:01:13.91,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Architecture is the art of making shelter for human beings.

19
0:01:19.37,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Period.

20
0:01:20.878,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And this is not easy at all.

21
0:01:23.06,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It's amazing.

22
0:01:25.038,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Look at this.

23
0:01:27.427,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Here we are in London,

24
0:01:29.506,000 --> 0:01:33,000
at the top of the Shard of Glass.

25
0:01:35.309,000 --> 0:01:38,000
This is a building we completed a few years ago.

26
0:01:38.988,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Those people are well-trained workers,

27
0:01:45.845,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and they are assembling the top piece of the tower.

28
0:01:51.186,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Well, they look like rock climbers.

29
0:01:56.074,000 --> 0:01:57,000
They are.

30
0:01:57.575,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I mean, they are defying the force of gravity,

31
0:02:00.234,000 --> 0:02:02,000
like building does, by the way.

32
0:02:03.607,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We got 30 of those people --

33
0:02:05.948,000 --> 0:02:09,000
actually, on that site, we got more than 1,400 people,

34
0:02:10.84,000 --> 0:02:13,000
coming from 60 different nationalities.

35
0:02:15.078,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You know, this is a miracle. It's a miracle.

36
0:02:18.117,000 --> 0:02:21,000
To put together 1,400 people,

37
0:02:21.394,000 --> 0:02:24,000
coming from such different places, is a miracle.

38
0:02:24.847,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Sites are miracles.

39
0:02:27.157,000 --> 0:02:28,000
This is another one.

40
0:02:29.339,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Let's talk about construction.

41
0:02:30.819,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Adventure, it's adventure in real life,

42
0:02:34.76,000 --> 0:02:35,000
not adventure in spirit.

43
0:02:37.211,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This guy there is a deepwater diver.

44
0:02:41.157,000 --> 0:02:45,000
From rock climbers to deepwater divers.

45
0:02:45.268,000 --> 0:02:46,000
This is in Berlin.

46
0:02:47.053,000 --> 0:02:49,000
After the fall of the Wall in '89,

47
0:02:49.99,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we built this building, connecting East Berlin to West Berlin,

48
0:02:54.117,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in Potsdamer Platz.

49
0:02:56.157,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We got on that project almost 5,000 people.

50
0:03:02.065,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Almost 5,000 people.

51
0:03:04.606,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And this is another site in Japan,

52
0:03:08.701,000 --> 0:03:1,000
building the Kansai Airport.

53
0:03:11.05,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Again, all the rock climbers, Japanese ones.

54
0:03:14.962,000 --> 0:03:16,000
You know, making buildings together

55
0:03:17.827,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is the best way to create a sense of cooperation.

56
0:03:22.411,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The sense of pride -- pride is essential.

57
0:03:26.117,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But, you know, construction, of course,

58
0:03:30.633,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is one of the reasons why architecture is amazing.

59
0:03:34.824,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But there is another one, that is maybe even more amazing.

60
0:03:39.697,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Because architecture is the art

61
0:03:42.339,000 --> 0:03:47,000
of making shelter for communities,

62
0:03:47.911,000 --> 0:03:48,000
not just for individuals --

63
0:03:50.038,000 --> 0:03:53,000
communities and society at large.

64
0:03:53.792,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And society is never the same.

65
0:03:56.792,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The world keeps changing.

66
0:03:59.95,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And changes are difficult to swallow by people.

67
0:04:03.498,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And architecture is a mirror of those changes.

68
0:04:08.014,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Architecture is the built expression of those changes.

69
0:04:14.347,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So, this is why it is so difficult,

70
0:04:19.411,000 --> 0:04:23,000
because those changes create adventure.

71
0:04:24.514,000 --> 0:04:26,000
They create adventure, and architecture is adventure.

72
0:04:27.268,000 --> 0:04:3,000
This is the Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris,

73
0:04:30.958,000 --> 0:04:31,000
a long time ago.

74
0:04:32.459,000 --> 0:04:35,000
That was back in time, '77.

75
0:04:36.623,000 --> 0:04:4,000
This was a spaceship landing in the middle of Paris.

76
0:04:42.456,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Together with my friend in adventure, Richard Rogers,

77
0:04:47.353,000 --> 0:04:5,000
we were, at the time, young bad boys.

78
0:04:51.125,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Young, bad boys.

79
0:04:52.353,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:53.412,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It was really only a few years after May '68.

81
0:04:58.863,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So it was a rebellion, pure rebellion.

82
0:05:02.101,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The idea was to make

83
0:05:05.688,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the proof that cultural buildings should not be intimidating.

84
0:05:10.434,000 --> 0:05:13,000
They should create a sense of curiosity.

85
0:05:14.879,000 --> 0:05:16,000
This is the way to create a cultural place.

86
0:05:17.664,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Curiosity is the beginning of a cultural attitude.

87
0:05:22.188,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And there's a piazza there, you can see that piazza.

88
0:05:26.379,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And a piazza is the beginning of urban life.

89
0:05:31.617,000 --> 0:05:33,000
A piazza is the place where people meet.

90
0:05:34.387,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And they mix experience.

91
0:05:37.823,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And they mix ages.

92
0:05:40.815,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And, you know, in some way,

93
0:05:44.989,000 --> 0:05:48,000
you create the essence of the city.

94
0:05:50.47,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And since then, we made, in the office, so many other places for people.

95
0:05:56.089,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Here, in Rome, is a concert hall.

96
0:06:00.2,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Another place for people.

97
0:06:02.029,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This building inside is actually designed by the sound, you can see.

98
0:06:07.382,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's flirting with sound.

99
0:06:09.854,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And this is the Kansai Airport,

100
0:06:12.489,000 --> 0:06:13,000
in Japan.

101
0:06:14.376,000 --> 0:06:16,000
To make a building, sometimes you need to make an island,

102
0:06:17.239,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and we made the island.

103
0:06:19.72,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The building is more than one mile long.

104
0:06:23.442,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It looks like an immense glider, landing on the ground.

105
0:06:27.942,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And this is in San Francisco.

106
0:06:29.95,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Another place for people.

107
0:06:31.918,000 --> 0:06:34,000
This building is the California Academy of Sciences.

108
0:06:35.82,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And we planted on that roof --

109
0:06:39.233,000 --> 0:06:45,000
thousands and thousands of plants that use the humidity of the air,

110
0:06:45.584,000 --> 0:06:48,000
instead of pumping water from the water table.

111
0:06:49.266,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The roof is a living roof, actually.

112
0:06:51.49,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And this building was made Platinum LEED.

113
0:06:55.879,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The LEED is the system to measure, of course,

114
0:06:58.276,000 --> 0:07:,000
the sustainability of a building.

115
0:07:01.022,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So this was also a place for people

116
0:07:05.68,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that will stay a long time.

117
0:07:08.109,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And this is actually New York.

118
0:07:10.03,000 --> 0:07:12,000
This is the new Whitney,

119
0:07:12.434,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in the Meatpacking District in New York.

120
0:07:17.046,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Well, another flying vessel.

121
0:07:21.108,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Another place for people.

122
0:07:23.807,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Here we are in Athens, the Niarchos Foundation.

123
0:07:26.72,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's a library,

124
0:07:28.641,000 --> 0:07:31,000
it's an open house, a concert hall

125
0:07:32.355,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and a big park.

126
0:07:34.27,000 --> 0:07:39,000
This building is also a Platinum LEED building.

127
0:07:40.286,000 --> 0:07:45,000
This building actually captures the sun's energy with that roof.

128
0:07:47.014,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But, you know, making a building a place for people is good.

129
0:07:53.188,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Making libraries, making concert halls,

130
0:07:57.058,000 --> 0:08:,000
making universities, making museums is good,

131
0:08:00.223,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because you create a place that's open, accessible.

132
0:08:05.442,000 --> 0:08:08,000
You create a building for a better world, for sure.

133
0:08:09.371,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But there is something else

134
0:08:13.866,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that makes architecture amazing, even more.

135
0:08:17.879,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And this is the fact that

136
0:08:20.411,000 --> 0:08:25,000
architecture doesn't just answer to need and necessity,

137
0:08:26.259,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but also to desires -- yes, desires -- dreams, aspirations.

138
0:08:33.264,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This is what architecture does.

139
0:08:35.175,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Even the most modest hut on earth

140
0:08:40.733,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is not just a roof.

141
0:08:42.59,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It's more than a roof.

142
0:08:43.835,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It's telling a story;

143
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it's telling a story about the identity of the people living in that hut.

144
0:08:50.427,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Individuals.

145
0:08:52.109,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Architecture is the art of telling stories.

146
0:08:56.212,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Like this one.

147
0:08:58.53,000 --> 0:09:,000
In London: the Shard of Glass.

148
0:09:00.942,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Well, this building is the tallest building in Western Europe.

149
0:09:06.013,000 --> 0:09:11,000
It goes up more than 300 meters in the air, to breathe fresh air.

150
0:09:11.427,000 --> 0:09:14,000
The facets of this building are inclined,

151
0:09:15.196,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and they reflect the sky of London, that is never the same.

152
0:09:19.426,000 --> 0:09:22,000
After rain, everything becomes bluish.

153
0:09:23.196,000 --> 0:09:26,000
In the sunny evening, everything is red.

154
0:09:27.577,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It's something that is difficult to explain.

155
0:09:31.363,000 --> 0:09:33,000
It's what we call the soul of a building.

156
0:09:35.649,000 --> 0:09:38,000
On this picture on the left, you have the Menil Collection,

157
0:09:38.837,000 --> 0:09:39,000
used a long time ago.

158
0:09:40.359,000 --> 0:09:41,000
It's a museum.

159
0:09:41.854,000 --> 0:09:43,000
On the right is the Harvard Art Museum.

160
0:09:44.521,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Both those two buildings flirt with light.

161
0:09:48.331,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Light is probably one of the most essential materials in architecture.

162
0:09:54.789,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And this is in Amsterdam.

163
0:09:57.17,000 --> 0:09:59,000
This building is flirting with water.

164
0:10:01.162,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And this is my office, on the sea.

165
0:10:05.247,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Well, this is flirting with work.

166
0:10:08.572,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Actually, we enjoy working there.

167
0:10:11.017,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And that cable car is the little cable car that goes up to there.

168
0:10:17.633,000 --> 0:10:19,000
That's "The New York Times" in New York.

169
0:10:20.84,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Well, this is playing with transparency.

170
0:10:24.204,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Again, the sense of light, the sense of transparency.

171
0:10:29.363,000 --> 0:10:31,000
On the left here, you have the Magic Lantern in Japan,

172
0:10:32.332,000 --> 0:10:34,000
in Ginza, in Tokyo.

173
0:10:35.153,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And in the center is a monastery in the forest.

174
0:10:39.419,000 --> 0:10:43,000
This monastery is playing with the silence and the forest.

175
0:10:44.855,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And a museum, a science museum.

176
0:10:47.831,000 --> 0:10:48,000
This is about levitation.

177
0:10:51.339,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And this is in the center of Paris,

178
0:10:54.815,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in the belly of the whale.

179
0:10:56.934,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This is the Pathé Foundation in Paris.

180
0:11:01.178,000 --> 0:11:03,000
All those buildings have something in common:

181
0:11:04.129,000 --> 0:11:1,000
it's that something is searching for desire, for dreams.

182
0:11:11.387,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And that's me.

183
0:11:12.561,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Laughter)

184
0:11:13.736,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Well, it's me on my sailing boat.

185
0:11:17.855,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Flirting with breeze.

186
0:11:20.902,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Well, there's not a very good reason to show you this picture.

187
0:11:25.881,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter)

188
0:11:28.839,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I'm trying, I'm trying.

189
0:11:30.807,000 --> 0:11:34,000
You know, one thing is clear: I love sailing, for sure.

190
0:11:35.482,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I actually also love designing sailing boats.

191
0:11:39.514,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But I love sailing, because sailing is associated with slowness.

192
0:11:44.696,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And ...

193
0:11:46.887,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and silence.

194
0:11:48.934,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And the sense of suspension.

195
0:11:51.641,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And there is another thing that this picture says.

196
0:11:54.831,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It says that I'm Italian.

197
0:11:56.911,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Laughter)

198
0:11:59.173,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Well, there is very little I can do about that.

199
0:12:02.569,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Laughter)

200
0:12:04.3,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I'm Italian, and I love beauty.

201
0:12:07.72,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I love beauty.

202
0:12:09.649,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Well, let's go sailing, I want to take you sailing here,

203
0:12:13.942,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to this place,

204
0:12:15.792,000 --> 0:12:17,000
in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

205
0:12:20.156,000 --> 0:12:23,000
This is the Jean-Marie Tjibaou Center.

206
0:12:23.72,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It's for the Kanaky ethnic group.

207
0:12:26.569,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It's in Nouméa, New Caledonia.

208
0:12:29.899,000 --> 0:12:31,000
This place is for art.

209
0:12:32.003,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Art and nature.

210
0:12:34.549,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And those buildings actually flirt with the wind,

211
0:12:39.058,000 --> 0:12:4,000
with the trade winds.

212
0:12:41.229,000 --> 0:12:44,000
They have a sound, they have a voice, those buildings.

213
0:12:44.594,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I'm showing this because it's about beauty.

214
0:12:47.848,000 --> 0:12:49,000
It's about pure beauty.

215
0:12:50.442,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And let's talk about beauty for a moment.

216
0:12:53.887,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Beauty is like the bird of paradise:

217
0:12:58.296,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the very moment you try to catch it, it flies away.

218
0:13:02.99,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Your arm is too short.

219
0:13:06.236,000 --> 0:13:1,000
But beauty is not a frivolous idea.

220
0:13:11.149,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It's the opposite.

221
0:13:13.284,000 --> 0:13:15,000
In my native language, that is Italian,

222
0:13:15.943,000 --> 0:13:16,000
"beautiful" is "bello."

223
0:13:19.236,000 --> 0:13:23,000
In Spanish, "beauty" is "belleza."

224
0:13:24.809,000 --> 0:13:27,000
In Greek, "beautiful" is "kalos."

225
0:13:30.214,000 --> 0:13:34,000
When you add "agathos," that means "beautiful and good."

226
0:13:35.191,000 --> 0:13:39,000
In no one of those languages, "beautiful" just means "beautiful."

227
0:13:40.001,000 --> 0:13:41,000
It also means "good."

228
0:13:43.295,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Real beauty is when the invisible

229
0:13:48.022,000 --> 0:13:51,000
joins the visible, coming on surface.

230
0:13:52.3,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And this doesn't apply only to art or nature.

231
0:13:58.507,000 --> 0:14:03,000
This applies to science, human curiosity, solidarity --

232
0:14:03.905,000 --> 0:14:06,000
that's the reason why you may say,

233
0:14:07.299,000 --> 0:14:1,000
"This is a beautiful person,"

234
0:14:10.609,000 --> 0:14:11,000
"That's a beautiful mind."

235
0:14:13.483,000 --> 0:14:17,000
This, this is the beauty that can change people

236
0:14:17.714,000 --> 0:14:18,000
into better people,

237
0:14:18.936,000 --> 0:14:21,000
by switching a special light in their eyes.

238
0:14:22.672,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And making buildings for this beauty

239
0:14:25.411,000 --> 0:14:27,000
makes cities better places to live.

240
0:14:28.863,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And better cities

241
0:14:31.196,000 --> 0:14:32,000
make better citizens.

242
0:14:34.244,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Well, this beauty --

243
0:14:37.172,000 --> 0:14:39,000
this universal beauty, I should say --

244
0:14:41.014,000 --> 0:14:44,000
is one of the few things that can change the world.

245
0:14:46.085,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Believe me, this beauty will save the world.

246
0:14:50.363,000 --> 0:14:53,000
One person at a time, but it will do it.

247
0:14:55.402,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Thank you.

248
0:14:56.656,000 --> 0:15:01,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:18.265,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I thought if I skipped it might help my nerves,

3
0:00:21.487,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but I'm actually having a paradoxical reaction to that,

4
0:00:24.673,000 --> 0:00:25,000
so that was a bad idea. (Laughter)

5
0:00:26.495,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Anyway, I was really delighted to receive the invitation

6
0:00:29.916,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to present to you some of my music and some of my work

7
0:00:33.853,000 --> 0:00:36,000
as a composer, presumably because it appeals

8
0:00:36.947,000 --> 0:00:39,000
to my well-known and abundant narcissism. (Laughter)

9
0:00:40.93,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And I'm not kidding, I just think we should just

10
0:00:43.538,000 --> 0:00:46,000
say that and move forward. (Laughter)

11
0:00:46.994,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So, but the thing is, a dilemma quickly arose,

12
0:00:49.874,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and that is that I'm really bored with music,

13
0:00:52.079,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I'm really bored with the role of the composer,

14
0:00:55.145,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and so I decided to put that idea, boredom,

15
0:00:58.353,000 --> 0:01:,000
as the focus of my presentation to you today.

16
0:01:01.327,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And I'm going to share my music with you, but I hope

17
0:01:03.615,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that I'm going to do so in a way that tells a story,

18
0:01:05.85,000 --> 0:01:08,000
tells a story about how I used boredom as a catalyst

19
0:01:09.259,000 --> 0:01:11,000
for creativity and invention, and how boredom

20
0:01:11.813,000 --> 0:01:14,000
actually forced me to change the fundamental question

21
0:01:14.974,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that I was asking in my discipline,

22
0:01:17.055,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and how boredom also, in a sense,

23
0:01:19.114,000 --> 0:01:23,000
pushed me towards taking on roles beyond the sort of

24
0:01:23.558,000 --> 0:01:25,000
most traditional, narrow definition of a composer.

25
0:01:26.168,000 --> 0:01:28,000
What I'd like to do today is to start with an excerpt

26
0:01:28.639,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of a piece of music at the piano.

27
0:01:31.467,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Music)

28
0:01:40.782,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Okay, I wrote that. (Laughter)

29
0:01:44.096,000 --> 0:01:45,000
No, it's not — (Applause) Oh, why thank you.

30
0:01:46.003,000 --> 0:01:47,000
No, no, I didn't write that.

31
0:01:47.634,000 --> 0:01:49,000
In fact, that was a piece by Beethoven,

32
0:01:49.906,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and so I was not functioning as a composer.

33
0:01:52.461,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Just now I was functioning in the role of the interpreter,

34
0:01:55.512,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and there I am, interpreter.

35
0:01:57.573,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So, an interpreter of what? Of a piece of music, right?

36
0:02:00.282,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But we can ask the question, "But is it music?"

37
0:02:04.489,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And I say this rhetorically, because of course

38
0:02:06.269,000 --> 0:02:08,000
by just about any standard we would have to concede

39
0:02:09.09,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that this is, of course, a piece of music,

40
0:02:11.038,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but I put this here now because,

41
0:02:13.364,000 --> 0:02:15,000
just to set it in your brains for the moment,

42
0:02:15.647,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because we're going to return to this question.

43
0:02:17.488,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It's going to be a kind of a refrain

44
0:02:19.27,000 --> 0:02:2,000
as we go through the presentation.

45
0:02:21.081,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So here we have this piece of music by Beethoven,

46
0:02:23.309,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and my problem with it is, it's boring.

47
0:02:26.515,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I mean, you — I'm just like, a hush, huh -- It's like -- (Laughter)

48
0:02:33.335,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It's Beethoven, how can you say that?

49
0:02:35.053,000 --> 0:02:36,000
No, well, I don't know, it's very familiar to me.

50
0:02:36.788,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I had to practice it as a kid, and I'm really sick of it. So -- (Laughter)

51
0:02:39.819,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I would, so what I might like to try to do is to change it,

52
0:02:42.542,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to transform it in some ways, to personalize it,

53
0:02:45.186,000 --> 0:02:47,000
so I might take the opening, like this idea --

54
0:02:47.613,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Music)

55
0:02:49.821,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and then I might substitute -- (Music)

56
0:02:54.718,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and then I might improvise on that melody

57
0:02:56.357,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that goes forward from there -- (Music)

58
0:02:59.992,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Music)

59
0:03:26.014,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So that might be the kind of thing -- Why thank you.

60
0:03:29.126,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Applause)

61
0:03:32.721,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That would be the kind of thing that I would do,

62
0:03:34.839,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and it's not necessarily better than the Beethoven.

63
0:03:36.936,000 --> 0:03:39,000
In fact, I think it's not better than it. The thing is -- (Laughter) --

64
0:03:40.668,000 --> 0:03:45,000
it's more interesting to me. It's less boring for me.

65
0:03:45.967,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I'm really leaning into me, because I, because I have

66
0:03:49.137,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to think about what decisions I'm going to make on the fly

67
0:03:52.709,000 --> 0:03:55,000
as that Beethoven text is running in time through my head

68
0:03:55.911,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and I'm trying to figure out what kinds of transformations

69
0:03:58.116,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I'm going to make to it.

70
0:03:59.714,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So this is an engaging enterprise for me, and

71
0:04:02.289,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I've really leaned into that first person pronoun thing there,

72
0:04:06.947,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and now my face appears twice, so I think we can agree

73
0:04:09.268,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that this is a fundamentally solipsistic enterprise. (Laughter)

74
0:04:12.959,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But it's an engaging one, and it's interesting to me

75
0:04:15.373,000 --> 0:04:17,000
for a while, but then I get bored with it, and by it,

76
0:04:17.793,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I actually mean, the piano, because it becomes,

77
0:04:20.444,000 --> 0:04:23,000
it's this familiar instrument, it's timbral range is actually

78
0:04:23.662,000 --> 0:04:25,000
pretty compressed, at least when you play on the keyboard,

79
0:04:26.183,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and if you're not doing things like listening to it

80
0:04:28.793,000 --> 0:04:3,000
after you've lit it on fire or something like that, you know.

81
0:04:31.516,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It gets a little bit boring, and so pretty soon

82
0:04:33.485,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I go through other instruments, they become familiar,

83
0:04:35.645,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and eventually I find myself designing and constructing

84
0:04:38.322,000 --> 0:04:42,000
my own instrument, and I brought one with me today,

85
0:04:42.485,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and I thought I would play a little bit on it for you

86
0:04:45.421,000 --> 0:04:47,000
so you can hear what it sounds like.

87
0:04:47.627,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Music)

88
0:04:59.04,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You gotta have doorstops, that's important. (Laughter)

89
0:05:04.803,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I've got combs. They're the only combs that I own. (Music)

90
0:05:07.911,000 --> 0:05:1,000
They're all mounted on my instruments. (Laughter)

91
0:05:11.067,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Music)

92
0:05:20.126,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I can actually do all sorts of things. I can play

93
0:05:22.711,000 --> 0:05:24,000
with a violin bow. I don't have to use the chopsticks.

94
0:05:25.209,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So we have this sound. (Music)

95
0:05:33.062,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And with a bank of live electronics,

96
0:05:35.106,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I can change the sounds radically. (Music)

97
0:05:39.227,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Music)

98
0:05:48.301,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Like that, and like this. (Music)

99
0:05:54.552,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And so forth.

100
0:05:56.67,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So this gives you a little bit of an idea of the sound world

101
0:05:58.809,000 --> 0:06:,000
of this instrument, which I think is quite interesting

102
0:06:01.486,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and it puts me in the role of the inventor, and the nice thing about —

103
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This instrument is called the Mouseketeer ... (Laughter)

104
0:06:08.379,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and the cool thing about it is

105
0:06:10.643,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I'm the world's greatest Mouseketeer player. (Laughter)

106
0:06:14.211,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Okay? (Applause)

107
0:06:15.83,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So in that regard, this is one of the things,

108
0:06:19.006,000 --> 0:06:2,000
this is one of the privileges of being,

109
0:06:20.866,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and here's another role, the inventor, and by the way,

110
0:06:23.872,000 --> 0:06:25,000
when I told you that I'm the world's greatest,

111
0:06:26.05,000 --> 0:06:3,000
if you're keeping score, we've had narcissism and solipsism

112
0:06:30.054,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and now a healthy dose of egocentricism.

113
0:06:32.058,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I know some of you are just, you know, bingo! Or, I don't know. (Laughter)

114
0:06:35.658,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Anyway, so this is also a really enjoyable role.

115
0:06:41.205,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I should concede also that I'm the world's worst Mouseketeer player,

116
0:06:43.937,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and it was this distinction that I was most worried about

117
0:06:46.187,000 --> 0:06:48,000
when I was on that prior side of the tenure divide.

118
0:06:49.124,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I'm glad I'm past that. We're not going to go into that.

119
0:06:51.61,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I'm crying on the inside. There are still scars.

120
0:06:54.567,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Anyway, but I guess my point is that all of these enterprises

121
0:06:58.383,000 --> 0:07:01,000
are engaging to me in their multiplicity, but as I've presented them

122
0:07:02.118,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to you today, they're actually solitary enterprises,

123
0:07:05.47,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and so pretty soon I want to commune with other people, and so

124
0:07:08.497,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I'm delighted that in fact I get to compose works for them.

125
0:07:11.015,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I get to write, sometimes for soloists and I get to work with one person,

126
0:07:14.101,000 --> 0:07:17,000
sometimes full orchestras, and I work with a lot of people,

127
0:07:17.41,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and this is probably the capacity, the role creatively

128
0:07:21.089,000 --> 0:07:24,000
for which I'm probably best known professionally.

129
0:07:24.251,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now, some of my scores as a composer look like this,

130
0:07:27.226,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and others look like this,

131
0:07:29.299,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and some look like this,

132
0:07:31.383,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and I make all of these by hand, and it's really tedious.

133
0:07:34.429,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It takes a long, long time to make these scores,

134
0:07:36.762,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and right now I'm working on a piece

135
0:07:38.935,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that's 180 pages in length,

136
0:07:40.958,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and it's just a big chunk of my life, and I'm just pulling out hair.

137
0:07:45.154,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I have a lot of it, and that's a good thing I suppose. (Laughter)

138
0:07:47.663,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So this gets really boring and really tiresome for me,

139
0:07:51.227,000 --> 0:07:53,000
so after a while the process of notating is not only boring,

140
0:07:54.2,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but I actually want the notation to be more interesting,

141
0:07:57.332,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and so that's pushed me to do other projects like this one.

142
0:08:00.051,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This is an excerpt from a score called

143
0:08:02.281,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"The Metaphysics of Notation."

144
0:08:04.472,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The full score is 72 feet wide.

145
0:08:07.016,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's a bunch of crazy pictographic notation.

146
0:08:09.714,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Let's zoom in on one section of it right here. You can see

147
0:08:12.6,000 --> 0:08:15,000
it's rather detailed. I do all of this with drafting templates,

148
0:08:16.417,000 --> 0:08:19,000
with straight edges, with French curves, and by freehand,

149
0:08:20.034,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and the 72 feet was actually split

150
0:08:22.688,000 --> 0:08:25,000
into 12 six-foot-wide panels that were installed

151
0:08:25.723,000 --> 0:08:29,000
around the Cantor Arts Center Museum lobby balcony,

152
0:08:30.607,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and it appeared for one year in the museum,

153
0:08:34.415,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and during that year, it was experienced as visual art

154
0:08:37.273,000 --> 0:08:38,000
most of the week, except, as you can see in these pictures,

155
0:08:39.174,000 --> 0:08:42,000
on Fridays, from noon til one, and only during that time,

156
0:08:42.212,000 --> 0:08:45,000
various performers came and interpreted these strange

157
0:08:45.592,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and undefined pictographic glyphs. (Laughter)

158
0:08:48.871,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now this was a really exciting experience for me.

159
0:08:52.555,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It was gratifying musically, but I think

160
0:08:54.158,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the more important thing is it was exciting because I got to take on

161
0:08:56.854,000 --> 0:08:58,000
another role, especially given that it appeared in a museum,

162
0:08:59.75,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and that is as visual artist. (Laughter)

163
0:09:03.026,000 --> 0:09:05,000
We're going to fill up the whole thing, don't worry. (Laughter)

164
0:09:05.526,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I am multitudes. (Laughter)

165
0:09:07.529,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So one of the things is that, I mean, some people

166
0:09:10.433,000 --> 0:09:11,000
would say, like, "Oh, you're being a dilettante,"

167
0:09:12.22,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and maybe that's true. I can understand how, I mean,

168
0:09:14.797,000 --> 0:09:16,000
because I don't have a pedigree in visual art

169
0:09:16.956,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and I don't have any training, but it's just something

170
0:09:18.992,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that I wanted to do as an extension of my composition,

171
0:09:21.459,000 --> 0:09:23,000
as an extension of a kind of creative impulse.

172
0:09:24.359,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I can understand the question, though. "But is it music?"

173
0:09:27.455,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I mean, there's not any traditional notation.

174
0:09:29.714,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I can also understand that sort of implicit criticism

175
0:09:31.967,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in this piece, "S-tog," which I made when I was living in Copenhagen.

176
0:09:35.339,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I took the Copenhagen subway map and

177
0:09:37.326,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I renamed all the stations to abstract musical provocations,

178
0:09:40.458,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and the players, who are synchronized with stopwatches,

179
0:09:43.229,000 --> 0:09:45,000
follow the timetables, which are listed in minutes past the hour.

180
0:09:46.09,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So this is a case of actually adapting something,

181
0:09:49.151,000 --> 0:09:5,000
or maybe stealing something,

182
0:09:51.034,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and then turning it into a musical notation.

183
0:09:53.375,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Another adaptation would be this piece.

184
0:09:55.53,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I took the idea of the wristwatch, and I turned it into a musical score.

185
0:09:58.876,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I made my own faces, and had a company fabricate them,

186
0:10:02.114,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and the players follow these scores.

187
0:10:04.352,000 --> 0:10:06,000
They follow the second hands, and as they pass over

188
0:10:06.373,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the various symbols, the players respond musically.

189
0:10:09.359,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Here's another example from another piece,

190
0:10:11.582,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and then its realization.

191
0:10:13.636,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So in these two capacities, I've been scavenger,

192
0:10:16.115,000 --> 0:10:18,000
in the sense of taking, like, the subway map, right,

193
0:10:18.502,000 --> 0:10:2,000
or thief maybe, and I've also been designer,

194
0:10:21.02,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in the case of making the wristwatches.

195
0:10:23.335,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And once again, this is, for me, interesting.

196
0:10:26.915,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Another role that I like to take on is that of the performance artist.

197
0:10:30.234,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Some of my pieces have these kind of weird theatric elements,

198
0:10:32.921,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and I often perform them. I want to show you a clip

199
0:10:35.075,000 --> 0:10:36,000
from a piece called "Echolalia."

200
0:10:36.839,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This is actually being performed by Brian McWhorter,

201
0:10:39.91,000 --> 0:10:4,000
who is an extraordinary performer.

202
0:10:41.215,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Let's watch a little bit of this, and please notice the instrumentation.

203
0:10:44.647,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Music)

204
0:11:13.535,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Okay, I hear you were laughing nervously because

205
0:11:15.219,000 --> 0:11:17,000
you too could hear that the drill was a little bit sharp,

206
0:11:17.513,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the intonation was a little questionable. (Laughter)

207
0:11:19.641,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Let's watch just another clip.

208
0:11:21.653,000 --> 0:11:31,000
(Music)

209
0:11:32.229,000 --> 0:11:34,000
You can see the mayhem continues, and there's, you know,

210
0:11:34.925,000 --> 0:11:35,000
there were no clarinets and trumpets

211
0:11:36.803,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and flutes and violins. Here's a piece that has

212
0:11:38.707,000 --> 0:11:4,000
an even more unusual, more peculiar instrumentation.

213
0:11:41.262,000 --> 0:11:44,000
This is "Tlön," for three conductors and no players. (Laughter)

214
0:11:57.587,000 --> 0:11:58,000
This was based on the experience of actually watching

215
0:11:59.527,000 --> 0:12:01,000
two people having a virulent argument in sign language,

216
0:12:02.043,000 --> 0:12:03,000
which produced no decibels to speak of,

217
0:12:03.902,000 --> 0:12:06,000
but affectively, psychologically, was a very loud experience.

218
0:12:07.313,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So, yeah, I get it, with, like, the weird appliances

219
0:12:10.981,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and then the total absence of conventional instruments

220
0:12:15.083,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and this glut of conductors, people might, you know,

221
0:12:17.956,000 --> 0:12:19,000
wonder, yeah, "Is this music?"

222
0:12:20.859,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But let's move on to a piece where clearly I'm behaving myself,

223
0:12:24.706,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and that is my "Concerto for Orchestra."

224
0:12:27.193,000 --> 0:12:28,000
You're going to notice a lot of conventional instruments

225
0:12:29.191,000 --> 0:12:32,000
in this clip. (Music)

226
0:12:32.891,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Music)

227
0:12:45.738,000 --> 0:12:47,000
This, in fact, is not the title of this piece.

228
0:12:47.778,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I was a bit mischievous. In fact, to make it more interesting,

229
0:12:50.333,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I put a space right in here, and this is the actual title of the piece.

230
0:12:54.618,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Let's continue with that same excerpt.

231
0:12:56.644,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Music)

232
0:13:06.937,000 --> 0:13:14,000
It's better with a florist, right? (Laughter) (Music)

233
0:13:15.027,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Or at least it's less boring. Let's watch a couple more clips.

234
0:13:17.263,000 --> 0:13:3,000
(Music)

235
0:13:31.239,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So with all these theatric elements, this pushes me in another role,

236
0:13:34.287,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and that would be, possibly, the dramaturge.

237
0:13:37.11,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I was playing nice. I had to write the orchestra bits, right?

238
0:13:41.597,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Okay? But then there was this other stuff, right?

239
0:13:44.06,000 --> 0:13:45,000
There was the florist, and I can understand that,

240
0:13:45.993,000 --> 0:13:48,000
once again, we're putting pressure on the ontology of music

241
0:13:49.133,000 --> 0:13:51,000
as we know it conventionally,

242
0:13:51.846,000 --> 0:13:55,000
but let's look at one last piece today I'm going to share with you.

243
0:13:56.269,000 --> 0:13:58,000
This is going to be a piece called "Aphasia,"

244
0:13:58.934,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and it's for hand gestures synchronized to sound,

245
0:14:02.369,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and this invites yet another role, and final one

246
0:14:05.108,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I'll share with you, which is that of the choreographer.

247
0:14:07.681,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And the score for the piece looks like this,

248
0:14:10.159,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and it instructs me, the performer, to make

249
0:14:14.569,000 --> 0:14:16,000
various hand gestures at very specific times

250
0:14:17.299,000 --> 0:14:19,000
synchronized with an audio tape, and that audio tape

251
0:14:19.553,000 --> 0:14:21,000
is made up exclusively of vocal samples.

252
0:14:22.43,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I recorded an awesome singer,

253
0:14:24.852,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and I took the sound of his voice in my computer,

254
0:14:27.197,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and I warped it in countless ways to come up with

255
0:14:29.796,000 --> 0:14:31,000
the soundtrack that you're about to hear.

256
0:14:32.064,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And I'll perform just an excerpt of "Aphasia" for you here. Okay?

257
0:14:37.029,000 --> 0:15:15,000
(Music)

258
0:15:15.368,000 --> 0:15:21,000
So that gives you a little taste of that piece. (Applause)

259
0:15:21.991,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Yeah, okay, that's kind of weird stuff.

260
0:15:24.275,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Is it music? Here's how I want to conclude.

261
0:15:26.514,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I've decided, ultimately, that this is the wrong question,

262
0:15:29.09,000 --> 0:15:3,000
that this is not the important question.

263
0:15:31.048,000 --> 0:15:33,000
The important question is, "Is it interesting?"

264
0:15:33.781,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And I follow this question, not worrying about "Is it music?" --

265
0:15:36.673,000 --> 0:15:38,000
not worrying about the definition of the thing that I'm making.

266
0:15:39.159,000 --> 0:15:41,000
I allow my creativity to push me

267
0:15:41.612,000 --> 0:15:43,000
in directions that are simply interesting to me,

268
0:15:43.772,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and I don't worry about the likeness of the result

269
0:15:46.821,000 --> 0:15:48,000
to some notion, some paradigm,

270
0:15:48.877,000 --> 0:15:5,000
of what music composition is supposed to be,

271
0:15:51.866,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and that has actually urged me, in a sense,

272
0:15:54.309,000 --> 0:15:55,000
to take on a whole bunch of different roles,

273
0:15:56.044,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and so what I want you to think about is,

274
0:15:58.179,000 --> 0:16:01,000
to what extent might you change the fundamental question

275
0:16:01.397,000 --> 0:16:03,000
in your discipline, and, okay,

276
0:16:04.12,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I'm going to put one extra little footnote in here,

277
0:16:06.5,000 --> 0:16:07,000
because, like, I realized I mentioned

278
0:16:08.114,000 --> 0:16:1,000
some psychological defects earlier, and we also,

279
0:16:11.049,000 --> 0:16:14,000
along the way, had a fair amount of obsessive behavior,

280
0:16:14.792,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and there was some delusional behavior and things like that,

281
0:16:16.953,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and here I think we could say that this is an argument

282
0:16:19.934,000 --> 0:16:2,000
for self-loathing and a kind of schizophrenia,

283
0:16:21.913,000 --> 0:16:22,000
at least in the popular use of the term,

284
0:16:23.849,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and I really mean dissociative identity disorder, okay. (Laughter)

285
0:16:26.083,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Anyway, despite those perils, I would urge you

286
0:16:29.146,000 --> 0:16:31,000
to think about the possibility that you might take on roles

287
0:16:31.721,000 --> 0:16:33,000
in your own work, whether they are neighboring

288
0:16:33.812,000 --> 0:16:35,000
or far-flung from your professional definition.

289
0:16:36.31,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And with that, I thank you very much. (Applause)

290
0:16:38.087,000 --> 0:16:44,000
(Applause)

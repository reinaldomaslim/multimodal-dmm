1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I've always been interested in

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the relationship of formal structures and human behavior.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
If you build a wide road out to the outskirts of town, people will move there.

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Well, law is also a powerful driver

5
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
of human behavior.

6
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And what I'd like to discuss today

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is the need to overhaul and simplify the law

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to release the energy and passion

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
of Americans, so that we can begin

10
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to address the challenges of our society.

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
You might have noticed that law has grown

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
progressively denser in your lives over the last decade or two.

13
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
If you run a business, it's hard to do much of anything

14
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
without calling your general counsel.

15
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Indeed, there is this phenomenon now

16
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
where the general counsels are becoming the CEOs.

17
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's a little bit like the Invasion Of The Body Snatchers.

18
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You need a lawyer to run the company,

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
because there's so much law.

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But it's not just business that's affected by this,

21
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
it's actually pressed down into the daily activities

22
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
of ordinary people.

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
A couple of years ago I was hiking near Cody, Wyoming.

24
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It was in a grizzly bear preserve,

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
although no one told me that before we went.

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And our guide was a local science teacher.

27
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
She was wholly unconcerned about the bears,

28
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but she was terrified of lawyers.

29
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The stories started pouring out.

30
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
She'd just been involved in an episode where a parent

31
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
had threatened to sue the school

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
because she lowered the grade of the student by 10 percent

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
when he turned the paper in late.

34
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
The principal didn't want to stand up to the parent

35
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
because he didn't want to get dragged into some legal proceedings.

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So, she had to go to meeting after meeting, same arguments made

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
over and over again.

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
After 30 days of sleepless nights, she finally capitulated

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and raised the grade.

40
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
She said, "Life's too short, I just can't keep going with this."

41
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
About the same time, she was going to take two students to a leadership conference

42
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in Laramie, which is a couple of hours away,

43
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and she was going to drive them in her car,

44
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but the school said, "No, you can't drive them in the car

45
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
for liability reasons.

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
You have to go in a school bus."

47
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So, they provided a bus that held 60 people

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and drove the three of them back and forth

49
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
several hours to Laramie.

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Her husband is also a science teacher,

51
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and he takes his biology class on a hike

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in the nearby national park.

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But he was told he couldn't go on the hike this year

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because one of the students in the class was disabled,

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so the other 25 students didn't get to go on the hike either.

56
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
At the end of this day I could have filled a book

57
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
just with stories about law

58
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
from this one teacher.

59
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Now, we've been taught to believe that law

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
is the foundation of freedom.

61
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But somehow or another, in the last couple of decades,

62
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the land of the free has become a legal minefield.

63
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's really changed our lives in ways

64
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that are sort of imperceptible;

65
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and yet, when you pull back, you see it all the time.

66
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It's changed the way we talk. I was talking to a

67
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
pediatrician friend

68
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in North Carolina. He said,

69
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"Well you know, I don't deal with patients the same way anymore.

70
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
You wouldn't want to say something off-the-cuff

71
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that might be used against you."

72
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
This is a doctor, whose life is caring for people.

73
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
My own law firm has a list of questions

74
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that I'm not allowed to ask

75
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
when interviewing candidates,

76
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
such as the sinister question,

77
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
bulging with hidden motives and innuendo,

78
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
"Where are you from?"

79
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now for 20 years, tort reformers have been sounding the alarm

81
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that lawsuits are out of control.

82
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And we read every once in while

83
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
about these crazy lawsuits, like the guy

84
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
in the District of Columbia who sued his dry cleaners for 54 million dollars

85
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
because they lost his pair of pants.

86
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The case went on for two years; I think he's still appealing the case.

87
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But the reality is, these crazy cases

88
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
are relatively rare. They don't usually win.

89
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And the total of direct tort cost

90
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
in this country is about two percent,

91
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
which is twice as much as in other countries

92
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
but, as taxes go, hardly crippling.

93
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But the direct costs are really only the tip of the iceberg.

94
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
What's happened here, again,

95
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
almost without our knowing,

96
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is our culture has changed.

97
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
People no longer feel free

98
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to act on their best judgment.

99
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So, what do we do about it?

100
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
We certainly don't want to give up the rights,

101
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
when people do something wrong, to seek redress in the courts.

102
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We need regulation to make sure

103
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
people don't pollute and such.

104
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We lack even a vocabulary to deal with

105
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
this problem,

106
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and that's because we have the wrong frame of reference.

107
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We've been trained to think that the way to look at every dispute,

108
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
every issue, is a matter of kind of individual rights.

109
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And so we peer through a legal microscope, and look at everything.

110
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Is it possible that there are extenuating circumstances

111
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that explain why Johnny

112
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
turned his paper in late in Cody, Wyoming?

113
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Is it possible that the doctor

114
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
might have done something differently when the sick person gets sicker?

115
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And of course the hindsight bias is perfect.

116
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
There's always a different scenario that you can sketch out

117
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
where it's possible that something could have been done differently.

118
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And yet, we've been trained to squint into this legal microscope,

119
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
hoping that we can judge any dispute

120
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
against the standard of a perfect society,

121
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
where everyone will agree what's fair,

122
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and where accidents will be extinct,

123
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
risk will be no more.

124
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Of course, this is Utopia;

125
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
it's a formula for paralysis, not freedom.

126
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's not the basis of the rule of law,

127
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
it's not the basis of a free society.

128
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So, now I have the first of four propositions

129
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I'm going to leave with you about how you simplify the law:

130
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You've got to judge law mainly

131
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
by its effect on the broader society,

132
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
not individual disputes.

133
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Absolutely vital.

134
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So, let's pull back from the anecdotes for a second

135
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and look at our society from high above.

136
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Is it working?

137
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
What does the macro-data show us?

138
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Well, the healthcare system has been transformed:

139
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
a culture pervaded with defensiveness,

140
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
universal distrust of the system of justice,

141
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
universal practice of defensive medicine.

142
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It's very hard to measure

143
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because there are mixed motives.

144
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Doctors can make more on ordering tests sometimes,

145
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and also they no longer even know what's right or wrong.

146
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
But reliable estimates

147
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
range between 60 billion and

148
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
200 billion dollars per year.

149
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
That's enough to provide care to all the people

150
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
in America who don't have it.

151
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The trial lawyers say, "Well, this legal fear

152
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
makes doctors practice better medicine."

153
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Well that's been studied too, by the Institute of Medicine

154
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and others. Turns out that's not the case.

155
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
The fear has chilled professional interaction

156
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
so thousands of tragic errors occur

157
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
because doctors are afraid

158
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to speak up: "Are you sure that's the right dosage?"

159
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Because they're not sure,

160
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and they don't want to take legal responsibility.

161
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Let's go to schools.

162
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
As we saw with the teacher in Cody, Wyoming,

163
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
she seems to be affected by the law.

164
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Well it turns out the schools are literally drowning in law.

165
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
You could have a separate section of a law library

166
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
around each of the following legal concepts:

167
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
due process, special education,

168
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
no child left behind,

169
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
zero tolerance, work rules ...

170
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
it goes on. We did a study

171
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
of all the rules that affect one school

172
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in New York. The Board of Ed. had no idea.

173
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Tens of thousands of discreet rules,

174
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
60 steps to suspend a student from school:

175
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It's a formula for paralysis.

176
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
What's the effect of that? One is a decline in order.

177
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Again, studies have shown

178
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
it's directly attributable

179
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to the rise of due process.

180
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Public agenda did a survey for us a couple of years ago

181
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
where they found that 43 percent of the high school teachers in America

182
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
say that they spend at least half of their time

183
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
maintaining order in the classroom.

184
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
That means those students are getting half the learning

185
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
they're supposed to, because if one child is disrupting the class

186
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
no one can learn.

187
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And what happens when the teacher tries to assert order?

188
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
They're threatened with a legal claim.

189
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
We also surveyed that. Seventy-eight percent of the middle and high school teachers

190
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in America have been threatened by their students

191
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
with violating their rights, with lawsuits

192
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
by their students. They are threatening, their students.

193
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's not that they usually sue,

194
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it's not that they would win, but it's an

195
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
indication of the corrosion of authority.

196
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And how has this system of law worked for government?

197
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It doesn't seem to be working very well does it?

198
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Neither in Sacramento nor in Washington.

199
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
The other day at the State of the Union speech,

200
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
President Obama said,

201
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and I think we could all agree with this goal,

202
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
"From the first railroads to the interstate highway system,

203
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
our nation has always been the first to compete.

204
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
There is no reason Europe or China should have the fastest trains."

205
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Well, actually there is a reason:

206
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Environmental review has evolved into a process

207
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
of no pebble left unturned

208
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
for any major project taking the better part of a decade,

209
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
then followed by years of litigation

210
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
by anybody who doesn't like the project.

211
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Then, just staying above the Earth for one more second,

212
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
people are acting like idiots,

213
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

214
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
all across the country.

215
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Applause)

216
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Idiots. A couple of years ago,

217
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Broward County, Florida, banned running at recess.

218
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

219
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
That means all the boys are going to be ADD.

220
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I mean it's just absolutely

221
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
a formula for failure.

222
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
My favorite, though, are all the warning labels.

223
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
"Caution: Contents are hot,"

224
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
on billions of coffee cups.

225
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Archeologists will dig us up in a thousand years

226
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and they won't know about defensive medicine and stuff,

227
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but they'll see all these labels, "Contents are extremely hot."

228
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
They'll think it was some kind of aphrodisiac.

229
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
That's the only explanation. Because why

230
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
would you have to tell people that something was actually hot?

231
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
My favorite warning was one on a five-inch fishing lure.

232
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I grew up in the South and whiled away the summers fishing.

233
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Five-inch fishing lure, it's a big fishing lure,

234
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
with a three pronged hook in the back,

235
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and outside it said, "Harmful if swallowed."

236
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
(Laughter)

237
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So, none of these people

238
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
are doing what they think is right.

239
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And why not? They don't trust the law. Why don't they trust the law?

240
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Because it gives us the worst of both worlds:

241
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's random -- anybody can sue for almost anything

242
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and take it to a jury, not even an effort at consistency --

243
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and it's also too detailed.

244
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
In the areas that are regulated, there are so many rules

245
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
no human could possibly know it.

246
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Well how do you fix it? We could spend 10,000 lifetimes

247
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
trying to prune this legal jungle.

248
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
But the challenge here is not one of just

249
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
amending the law,

250
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
because the hurdle for success is trust.

251
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
People -- for law to be the platform for freedom,

252
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
people have to trust it.

253
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So, that's my second proposition:

254
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Trust is an essential condition

255
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
to a free society.

256
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Life is complicated enough without legal fear.

257
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But law is different than other kinds of uncertainties,

258
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
because it carries with it the power of state.

259
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And so the state can come in.

260
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It actually changes the way people think.

261
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
It's like having a little lawyer on your shoulders

262
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
all day long, whispering in your ear,

263
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
"Could that go wrong? Might that go wrong?"

264
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
It drives people from the smart part of the brain --

265
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that dark, deep well of the subconscious,

266
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
where instincts and experience,

267
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and all the other factors of creativity

268
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
and good judgment are --

269
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
it drives us to the thin veneer of conscious logic.

270
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Pretty soon the doctor's saying, "Well, I doubt

271
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
if that headache could be a tumor, but who would protect me

272
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
if it were? So maybe I'll just order the MRI."

273
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Then you've wasted 200 billion dollars in unnecessary tests.

274
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
If you make people self-conscious

275
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
about their judgments, studies show

276
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
you will make them make worse judgments.

277
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
If you tell the pianist to think about how she's hitting the notes

278
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
when she's playing the piece, she can't play the piece.

279
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Self-consciousness is the enemy of accomplishment.

280
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Edison stated it best. He said,

281
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
"Hell, we ain't got no rules around here,

282
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
we're trying to accomplish something."

283
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

284
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So, how do you restore trust?

285
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Tweaking the law's clearly not good enough,

286
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and tort reform, which is a great idea,

287
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
lowers your cost if you're a businessperson,

288
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
but it's like a Band-Aid on this gaping wound of distrust.

289
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
States with extensive tort reform

290
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
still suffer all these pathologies.

291
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So, what's needed is not just to limit claims,

292
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
but actually create a dry ground of freedom.

293
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It turns out that freedom actually has a formal structure.

294
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And it is this:

295
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Law sets boundaries,

296
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and on one side of those boundaries are all the things

297
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
you can't do or must do --

298
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
you can't steal, you've got to pay your taxes --

299
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
but those same boundaries are supposed to define

300
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and protect a dry ground of freedom.

301
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Isaiah Berlin put it this way:

302
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
"Law sets frontiers, not artificially drawn,

303
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
within which men shall be inviolable."

304
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We've forgotten that second part.

305
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Those dikes have burst. People wade through law

306
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
all day long.

307
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So, what's needed now

308
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is to rebuild these boundaries.

309
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And it's especially important to rebuild them

310
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
for lawsuits.

311
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Because what people can sue for establishes the boundaries

312
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
for everybody else's freedom.

313
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
If someone brings a lawsuit over, "A kid fell off the seesaw,"

314
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
it doesn't matter what happens in the lawsuit,

315
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
all the seesaws will disappear.

316
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Because no one will want to take the risk of a lawsuit.

317
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And that's what's happened. There are no seesaws, jungle gyms,

318
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
merry-go-rounds, climbing ropes,

319
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
nothing that would interest a kid over the age of four,

320
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
because there's no risk associated with it.

321
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So, how do we rebuild it?

322
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Life is too complex for...

323
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Applause)

324
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Life is too complex for a software program.

325
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
All these choices involve value judgments

326
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and social norms, not objective facts.

327
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And so here is the fourth proposition.

328
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
This is what we have, the philosophy we have to change to.

329
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And there are two essential elements of it:

330
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We have to simplify the law.

331
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We have to migrate from all this complexity

332
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
towards general principles and goals.

333
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
The constitution is only 16 pages long.

334
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Worked pretty well for 200 years.

335
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Law has to be simple enough

336
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
so that people can internalize it

337
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
in their daily choices.

338
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
If they can't internalize it, they won't trust it.

339
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
And how do you make it simple?

340
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Because life is complex,

341
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and here is the hardest and biggest change:

342
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We have to restore the authority

343
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
to judges and officials

344
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
to interpret and apply the law.

345
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
(Applause)

346
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
We have to rehumanize the law.

347
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
To make law simple so that you feel free,

348
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
the people in charge have to be free

349
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
to use their judgment to interpret and apply the law

350
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
in accord with reasonable social norms.

351
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
As you're going down, and walking down the sidewalk during the day,

352
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
you have to think that if there is a dispute,

353
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
there's somebody in society who sees it as their job

354
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
to affirmatively protect you

355
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
if you're acting reasonably.

356
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
That person doesn't exist today.

357
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
This is the hardest hurdle.

358
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
It's actually not very hard. Ninety-eight percent of cases, this is a piece of cake.

359
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Maybe you've got a claim in small claims court

360
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
for your lost pair of pants for $100,

361
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
but not in a court of general jurisdiction for millions of dollars.

362
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Case dismissed without prejudice or refiling in small claims court.

363
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Takes five minutes. That's it,

364
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
it's not that hard.

365
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
But it's a hard hurdle because we got into this legal quicksand

366
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
because we woke up in the 1960s

367
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
to all these really bad values: racism,

368
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
gender discrimination, pollution --

369
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
they were bad values. And we wanted to create a legal system

370
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
where no one could have bad values anymore.

371
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
The problem is, we created a system

372
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
where we eliminated the right to have good values.

373
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
It doesn't mean that people in authority

374
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
can do whatever they want.

375
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
They're still bounded by legal goals and principles:

376
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
The teacher is accountable to the principal,

377
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
the judge is accountable to an appellate court,

378
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
the president is accountable to voters.

379
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
But the accountability's up the line

380
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
judging the decision against the effect on everybody,

381
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
not just on the disgruntled person.

382
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
You can't run a society by the lowest common denominator.

383
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
(Applause)

384
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
So, what's needed is a basic shift in philosophy.

385
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
We can pull the plug on a lot of this stuff if we shift our philosophy.

386
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
We've been taught that authority is the enemy of freedom.

387
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
It's not true. Authority, in fact,

388
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
is essential to freedom.

389
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Law is a human institution;

390
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
responsibility is a human institution.

391
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
If teachers don't have authority to run the classroom,

392
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
to maintain order, everybody's learning suffers.

393
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
If the judge doesn't have the authority to toss out unreasonable claims,

394
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
then all of us go through the day looking over our shoulders.

395
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
If the environmental agency can't decide

396
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
that the power lines are good for the environment,

397
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
then there's no way to bring the power from the wind farms

398
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
to the city.

399
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
A free society requires red lights and green lights,

400
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
otherwise it soon descends into gridlock.

401
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
That's what's happened to America. Look around.

402
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
What the world needs now

403
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
is to restore the authority to make common choices.

404
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
It's the only way to get our freedom back,

405
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
and it's the only way to release the energy and passion

406
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
needed so that we can meet the challenges

407
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
of our time. Thank you.

408
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
(Applause)

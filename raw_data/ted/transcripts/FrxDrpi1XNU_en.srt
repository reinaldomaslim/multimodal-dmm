1
0:00:12.811,000 --> 0:00:13,000
The 2011 Arab Spring

2
0:00:14.776,000 --> 0:00:15,000
captured the attention of the world.

3
0:00:16.579,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It also captured the attention

4
0:00:18.228,000 --> 0:00:2,000
of authoritarian governments in other countries,

5
0:00:20.605,000 --> 0:00:22,000
who were worried that revolution would spread.

6
0:00:23.568,000 --> 0:00:25,000
To respond, they ramped up surveillance

7
0:00:25.645,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of activists, journalists and dissidents

8
0:00:28.741,000 --> 0:00:29,000
who they feared would inspire revolution

9
0:00:30.695,000 --> 0:00:31,000
in their own countries.

10
0:00:32.53,000 --> 0:00:34,000
One prominent Bahraini activist,

11
0:00:34.575,000 --> 0:00:36,000
who was arrested and tortured by his government,

12
0:00:36.685,000 --> 0:00:37,000
has said that the interrogators showed him

13
0:00:38.41,000 --> 0:00:39,000
transcripts of his telephone calls

14
0:00:40.28,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and text messages.

15
0:00:42.088,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Of course, it's no secret

16
0:00:43.744,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that governments are able to intercept telephone calls and text messages.

17
0:00:46.94,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It's for that reason that many activists

18
0:00:49.312,000 --> 0:00:5,000
specifically avoid using the telephone.

19
0:00:51.238,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Instead, they use tools like Skype,

20
0:00:53.586,000 --> 0:00:55,000
which they think are immune to interception.

21
0:00:56.106,000 --> 0:00:57,000
They're wrong.

22
0:00:57.878,000 --> 0:00:59,000
There have now been over the last few years

23
0:01:00.604,000 --> 0:01:01,000
an industry of companies

24
0:01:02.25,000 --> 0:01:05,000
who provide surveillance technology to governments,

25
0:01:05.504,000 --> 0:01:07,000
specifically technology that allows those governments

26
0:01:07.865,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to hack into the computers

27
0:01:09.518,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of surveillance targets.

28
0:01:11.113,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Rather than intercepting the communications as they go over the wire,

29
0:01:13.953,000 --> 0:01:15,000
instead they now hack into your computer,

30
0:01:16.22,000 --> 0:01:18,000
enable your webcam, enable your microphone,

31
0:01:18.222,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and steal documents from your computer.

32
0:01:20.679,000 --> 0:01:22,000
When the government of Egypt fell in 2011,

33
0:01:23.512,000 --> 0:01:26,000
activists raided the office of the secret police,

34
0:01:26.913,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and among the many documents they found

35
0:01:28.901,000 --> 0:01:3,000
was this document by the Gamma Corporation,

36
0:01:31.218,000 --> 0:01:32,000
by Gamma International.

37
0:01:33.019,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Gamma is a German company

38
0:01:34.676,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that manufactures surveillance software

39
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and sells it only to governments.

40
0:01:38.317,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It's important to note that most governments

41
0:01:40.324,000 --> 0:01:42,000
don't really have the in-house capabilities

42
0:01:42.39,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to develop this software.

43
0:01:43.855,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Smaller ones don't have the resources

44
0:01:45.474,000 --> 0:01:46,000
or the expertise,

45
0:01:47.25,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and so there's this market of Western companies

46
0:01:50.557,000 --> 0:01:51,000
who are happy to supply them with the tools

47
0:01:52.524,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and techniques for a price.

48
0:01:54.242,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Gamma is just one of these companies.

49
0:01:56.848,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I should note also that Gamma never actually sold

50
0:01:59.756,000 --> 0:02:,000
their software to the Egyptian government.

51
0:02:01.653,000 --> 0:02:03,000
They'd sent them an invoice for a sale,

52
0:02:04.25,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but the Egyptians never bought it.

53
0:02:05.892,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Instead, apparently, the Egyptian government

54
0:02:07.616,000 --> 0:02:09,000
used a free demo version of Gamma's software.

55
0:02:10.249,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:13.024,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So this screenshot is from a sales video

57
0:02:16.522,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that Gamma produced.

58
0:02:18.087,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Really, they're just emphasizing

59
0:02:20.07,000 --> 0:02:21,000
in a relatively slick presentation

60
0:02:21.721,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the fact that the police can sort of sit

61
0:02:23.914,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in an air-conditioned office

62
0:02:25.364,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and remotely monitor someone

63
0:02:26.775,000 --> 0:02:28,000
without them having any idea that it's going on.

64
0:02:28.95,000 --> 0:02:3,000
You know, your webcam light won't turn on.

65
0:02:30.985,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There's nothing to indicate that the microphone is enabled.

66
0:02:34.339,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This is the managing director of Gamma International.

67
0:02:37.674,000 --> 0:02:38,000
His name is Martin Muench.

68
0:02:39.535,000 --> 0:02:41,000
There are many photos of Mr. Muench that exist.

69
0:02:42.466,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This is perhaps my favorite.

70
0:02:44.318,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I'm just going to zoom in a little bit onto his webcam.

71
0:02:46.462,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You can see there's a little sticker

72
0:02:48.13,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that's placed over his camera.

73
0:02:50.023,000 --> 0:02:52,000
He knows what kind of surveillance is possible,

74
0:02:52.556,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and so clearly he doesn't want it to be used

75
0:02:54.362,000 --> 0:02:55,000
against him.

76
0:02:55.964,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Muench has said that he intends

77
0:02:57.888,000 --> 0:02:58,000
for his software to be used

78
0:02:59.552,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to capture terrorists and locate pedophiles.

79
0:03:02.535,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Of course, he's also acknowledged that once

80
0:03:04.331,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the software has been sold to governments,

81
0:03:06.486,000 --> 0:03:09,000
he has no way of knowing how it can be used.

82
0:03:10.311,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Gamma's software has been located on servers

83
0:03:12.161,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in countries around the world,

84
0:03:13.817,000 --> 0:03:15,000
many with really atrocious track records

85
0:03:16.208,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and human rights violations.

86
0:03:17.769,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They really are selling their software around the world.

87
0:03:21.164,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Gamma is not the only company in the business.

88
0:03:23.465,000 --> 0:03:25,000
As I said, it's a $5 billion industry.

89
0:03:26.216,000 --> 0:03:28,000
One of the other big guys in the industry

90
0:03:29.055,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is an Italian company called Hacking Team.

91
0:03:31.45,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Now, Hacking Team has what is probably

92
0:03:33.175,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the slickest presentation.

93
0:03:35.145,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The video they've produced is very sexy,

94
0:03:38.173,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and so I'm going to play you a clip

95
0:03:39.821,000 --> 0:03:4,000
just so you can get a feel

96
0:03:41.135,000 --> 0:03:42,000
both for the capabilities of the software

97
0:03:42.966,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but also how it's marketed

98
0:03:44.872,000 --> 0:03:45,000
to their government clients.

99
0:03:46.64,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Video) Narrator: You want to look through your target's eyes.

100
0:03:50.179,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Music)

101
0:03:52.063,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You have to hack your target.

102
0:03:55.065,000 --> 0:04:01,000
["While your target is browsing the web, exchanging documents, receiving SMS, crossing the borders"]

103
0:04:01.381,000 --> 0:04:03,000
You have to hit many different platforms.

104
0:04:04.304,000 --> 0:04:07,000
["Windows, OS X, iOS, Android, Blackberry, Symbian, Linux"]

105
0:04:08.184,000 --> 0:04:1,000
You have to overcome encryption

106
0:04:10.652,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and capture relevant data.

107
0:04:13.549,000 --> 0:04:17,000
[Skype & encrypted calls, target location, messaging, relationships,

108
0:04:18.108,000 --> 0:04:21,000
web browsing, audio & video"]

109
0:04:21.28,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Being stealth and untraceable.

110
0:04:25.44,000 --> 0:04:28,000
["Immune to any protection system Hidden collection infrastructure"]

111
0:04:28.714,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Deployed all over your country.

112
0:04:32.819,000 --> 0:04:36,000
["Up to hundreds of thousands of targets Managed from a single spot"]

113
0:04:37.353,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Exactly what we do.

114
0:04:40.675,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Christopher Soghoian: So, it would be funny if it wasn't true,

115
0:04:42.938,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but, in fact, Hacking Team's software

116
0:04:44.726,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is being sold to governments around the world.

117
0:04:47.674,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Last year we learned, for example,

118
0:04:49.426,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that it's been used to target Moroccan journalists by the Moroccan government.

119
0:04:53.474,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Many, many countries it's been found in.

120
0:04:56.018,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So, Hacking Team has also been actively courting

121
0:04:59.142,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the U.S. law enforcement market.

122
0:05:01.485,000 --> 0:05:03,000
In the last year or so, the company

123
0:05:03.768,000 --> 0:05:07,000
has opened a sales office in Maryland.

124
0:05:08.544,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The company has also hired a spokesperson.

125
0:05:10.658,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They've been attending

126
0:05:12.195,000 --> 0:05:13,000
surveillance industry conferences

127
0:05:13.792,000 --> 0:05:15,000
where law enforcement officials show up.

128
0:05:15.807,000 --> 0:05:16,000
They've spoken at the conferences.

129
0:05:17.641,000 --> 0:05:18,000
What I thought was most fascinating was

130
0:05:19.229,000 --> 0:05:21,000
they've actually paid for the coffee break

131
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
at one of the law enforcement conferences

132
0:05:23.27,000 --> 0:05:24,000
earlier this year.

133
0:05:24.763,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I can't tell you for sure that Hacking Team

134
0:05:26.862,000 --> 0:05:28,000
has sold their technology in the United States,

135
0:05:29.587,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but what I can tell you that if they haven't sold it,

136
0:05:31.558,000 --> 0:05:34,000
it isn't because they haven't been trying hard.

137
0:05:34.733,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So as I said before,

138
0:05:36.775,000 --> 0:05:37,000
governments that don't really have the resources

139
0:05:38.695,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to build their own tools will buy

140
0:05:40.291,000 --> 0:05:41,000
off-the-shelf surveillance software,

141
0:05:41.701,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and so for that reason,

142
0:05:43.089,000 --> 0:05:45,000
you see that the government of, say, Tunisia,

143
0:05:45.805,000 --> 0:05:47,000
might use the same software as the government of Germany.

144
0:05:47.993,000 --> 0:05:49,000
They're all buying off-the-shelf stuff.

145
0:05:50.265,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The Federal Bureau of Investigation in the United States

146
0:05:52.464,000 --> 0:05:54,000
does have the budget to build their own surveillance technology,

147
0:05:55.226,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and so for several years, I've been trying

148
0:05:57.007,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to figure out if and how the FBI

149
0:05:59.398,000 --> 0:06:01,000
is hacking into the computers of surveillance targets.

150
0:06:02.296,000 --> 0:06:05,000
My friends at an organization called the Electronic Frontier Foundation --

151
0:06:05.449,000 --> 0:06:07,000
they're a civil society group —

152
0:06:07.761,000 --> 0:06:09,000
obtained hundreds of documents from the FBI

153
0:06:10.253,000 --> 0:06:12,000
detailing their next generation of surveillance technologies.

154
0:06:13.101,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Most of these documents were heavily redacted,

155
0:06:15.735,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but what you can see from the slides,

156
0:06:18.551,000 --> 0:06:19,000
if I zoom in, is this term:

157
0:06:20.513,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Remote Operations Unit.

158
0:06:22.333,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Now, when I first looked into this,

159
0:06:24.567,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I'd never heard of this unit before.

160
0:06:26.637,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I've been studying surveillance for more than six years.

161
0:06:28.939,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I'd never heard of it.

162
0:06:30.224,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And so I went online and I did some research,

163
0:06:32.187,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and ultimately I hit the mother lode

164
0:06:34.312,000 --> 0:06:35,000
when I went to LinkedIn,

165
0:06:35.946,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the social networking site for job seekers.

166
0:06:38.515,000 --> 0:06:4,000
There were lots of former U.S. government contractors

167
0:06:41.428,000 --> 0:06:42,000
who had at one point worked

168
0:06:42.815,000 --> 0:06:43,000
for the Remote Operating Unit,

169
0:06:44.124,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and were describing in surprising detail on their CVs

170
0:06:47.538,000 --> 0:06:49,000
what they had done in their former job.

171
0:06:49.569,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Laughter)

172
0:06:51.791,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So I took this information

173
0:06:53.778,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and I gave it to a journalist that I know and trust at the Wall Street Journal,

174
0:06:57.522,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and she was able to contact several other

175
0:06:59.323,000 --> 0:07:,000
former law enforcement officials

176
0:07:01.077,000 --> 0:07:02,000
who spoke on background and confirmed

177
0:07:02.883,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that yes, in fact, the FBI has a dedicated team

178
0:07:06.242,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that does nothing but hack into the computers

179
0:07:08.378,000 --> 0:07:09,000
of surveillance targets.

180
0:07:09.904,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Like Gamma and Hacking Team,

181
0:07:11.792,000 --> 0:07:13,000
the FBI also has the capability

182
0:07:13.909,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to remotely activate webcams, microphones,

183
0:07:17.303,000 --> 0:07:19,000
steal documents, get web browsing information,

184
0:07:19.505,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the works.

185
0:07:21.189,000 --> 0:07:22,000
There's sort of a big problem

186
0:07:23.011,000 --> 0:07:24,000
with governments going into hacking,

187
0:07:24.611,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and that's that terrorists, pedophiles,

188
0:07:27.13,000 --> 0:07:29,000
drug dealers, journalists and human rights activists

189
0:07:30.041,000 --> 0:07:32,000
all use the same kinds of computers.

190
0:07:32.312,000 --> 0:07:34,000
There's no drug dealer phone

191
0:07:34.359,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and there's no journalist laptop.

192
0:07:36.325,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We all use the same technology,

193
0:07:38.559,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and what that means then is that for governments

194
0:07:40.453,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to have the capability to hack into the computers

195
0:07:42.57,000 --> 0:07:43,000
of the real bad guys,

196
0:07:44.269,000 --> 0:07:45,000
they also have to have the capability

197
0:07:46.245,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to hack into our devices too.

198
0:07:48.43,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So governments around the world

199
0:07:50.182,000 --> 0:07:51,000
have been embracing this technology.

200
0:07:51.643,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They've been embracing hacking

201
0:07:53.248,000 --> 0:07:54,000
as a law enforcement technique,

202
0:07:55.068,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but without any real debate.

203
0:07:57.018,000 --> 0:07:58,000
In the United States, where I live,

204
0:07:58.837,000 --> 0:07:59,000
there have been no congressional hearings.

205
0:08:00.662,000 --> 0:08:01,000
There's no law that's been passed

206
0:08:02.623,000 --> 0:08:04,000
specifically authorizing this technique,

207
0:08:04.696,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and because of its power and potential for abuse,

208
0:08:07.365,000 --> 0:08:09,000
it's vital that we have an informed public debate.

209
0:08:10.312,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Thank you very much.

210
0:08:12.258,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Applause)

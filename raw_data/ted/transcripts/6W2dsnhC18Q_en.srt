1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is called Hooked on a Feeling:

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The Pursuit of Happiness and Human Design.

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I put up a somewhat dour Darwin,

4
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but a very happy chimp up there.

5
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
My first point is that the pursuit of happiness is obligatory.

6
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Man wishes to be happy, only wishes to be happy,

7
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and cannot wish not to be so.

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
We are wired to pursue happiness,

9
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
not only to enjoy it, but to want more and more of it.

10
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So given that that's true,

11
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
how good are we at increasing our happiness?

12
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Well, we certainly try.

13
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
If you look on the Amazon site, there are over 2,000 titles

14
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
with advice on the seven habits, the nine choices,

15
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
the 10 secrets,

16
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the 14,000 thoughts that are supposed to bring happiness.

17
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Now another way we try to increase our happiness

18
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is we medicate ourselves.

19
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And so there's over 120 million prescriptions out there for antidepressants.

20
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Prozac was really the first absolute blockbuster drug.

21
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It was clean, efficient, there was no high,

22
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
there was really no danger, it had no street value.

23
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In 1995,

24
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
illegal drugs were a $400 billion business,

25
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
representing eight percent of world trade,

26
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
roughly the same as gas and oil.

27
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
These routes to happiness haven't really increased happiness very much.

28
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
One problem that's happening now is,

29
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
although the rates of happiness

30
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
are about as flat as the surface of the moon,

31
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
depression and anxiety are rising.

32
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Some people say this is because we have better diagnosis,

33
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and more people are being found out.

34
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It isn't just that. We're seeing it all over the world.

35
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
In the United States right now

36
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
there are more suicides than homicides.

37
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
There is a rash of suicide in China.

38
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And the World Health Organization predicts

39
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
by the year 2020

40
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that depression will be

41
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
the second largest cause of disability.

42
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now the good news here

43
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
is that if you take surveys from around the world,

44
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
we see that about three quarters of people

45
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
will say they are at least pretty happy.

46
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But this does not follow any of the usual trends.

47
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
For example, these two show great growth in income,

48
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
absolutely flat happiness curves.

49
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
My field, the field of psychology,

50
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
hasn't done a whole lot

51
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to help us move forward in understanding human happiness.

52
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
In part, we have the legacy of Freud, who was a pessimist,

53
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
who said that pursuit of happiness is a doomed quest,

54
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is propelled by infantile aspects of the individual

55
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that can never be met in reality.

56
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
He said, "One feels inclined to say

57
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that the intention that man should be happy

58
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
is not included in the plan of creation."

59
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So the ultimate goal of psychoanalytic psychotherapy

60
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
was really what Freud called ordinary misery.

61
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

62
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And Freud in part reflects

63
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the anatomy of the human emotion system --

64
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which is that we have both a positive and a negative system,

65
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and our negative system

66
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
is extremely sensitive.

67
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So for example, we're born loving the taste of something sweet

68
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and reacting aversively to the taste of something bitter.

69
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We also find that people are more averse to losing

70
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
than they are happy to gain.

71
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The formula for a happy marriage

72
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
is five positive remarks, or interactions,

73
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
for every one negative.

74
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And that's how powerful the one negative is.

75
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Especially expressions of contempt or disgust,

76
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
well you really need a lot of positives to upset that.

77
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I also put in here the stress response.

78
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We're wired for dangers that are immediate,

79
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that are physical, that are imminent,

80
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and so our body goes into an incredible reaction

81
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
where endogenous opioids come in.

82
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We have a system that is really ancient,

83
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and really there for physical danger.

84
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And so over time, this becomes a stress response,

85
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
which has enormous effects on the body.

86
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Cortisol floods the brain;

87
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
it destroys hippocampal cells and memory,

88
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and can lead to all kinds of health problems.

89
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But unfortunately, we need this system in part.

90
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:09,000
If we were only governed by pleasure

91
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
we would not survive.

92
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
We really have two command posts.

93
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Emotions are short-lived intense responses

94
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to challenge and to opportunity.

95
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And each one of them allows us to click into alternate selves

96
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that tune in, turn on, drop out

97
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
thoughts, perceptions, feelings and memories.

98
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We tend to think of emotions as just feelings.

99
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But in fact, emotions are an all-systems alert

100
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that change what we remember,

101
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
what kind of decisions we make,

102
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and how we perceive things.

103
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So let me go forward to the new science of happiness.

104
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We've come away from the Freudian gloom,

105
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and people are now actively studying this.

106
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And one of the key points in the science of happiness

107
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is that happiness and unhappiness

108
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
are not endpoints of a single continuum.

109
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The Freudian model is really one continuum

110
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that, as you get less miserable,

111
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
you get happier.

112
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And that isn't true -- when you get less miserable,

113
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
you get less miserable.

114
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And that happiness is a whole other end of the equation.

115
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And it's been missing. It's been missing from psychotherapy.

116
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So when people's symptoms go away, they tend to recur,

117
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because there isn't a sense of the other half --

118
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
of what pleasure, happiness, compassion, gratitude,

119
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
what are the positive emotions.

120
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And of course we know this intuitively,

121
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that happiness is not just the absence of misery.

122
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But somehow it was not put forward until very recently,

123
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
seeing these as two parallel systems.

124
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So that the body can both look for opportunity

125
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and also protect itself from danger, at the same time.

126
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And they're sort of two reciprocal

127
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and dynamically interacting systems.

128
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
People have also wanted to deconstruct.

129
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We use this word "happy,"

130
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and it's this very large umbrella of a term.

131
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And then three emotions for which there are no English words:

132
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
fiero, which is the pride in accomplishment of a challenge;

133
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
schadenfreude, which is happiness in another's misfortune,

134
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
a malicious pleasure;

135
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and naches, which is a pride and joy in one's children.

136
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Absent from this list, and absent from any discussions of happiness,

137
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
are happiness in another's happiness.

138
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We don't seem to have a word for that.

139
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We are very sensitive to the negative,

140
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
but it is in part offset by the fact

141
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that we have a positivity.

142
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
We're also born pleasure-seekers.

143
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Babies love the taste of sweet

144
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and hate the taste of bitter.

145
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They love to touch smooth surfaces rather than rough ones.

146
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They like to look at beautiful faces

147
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
rather than plain faces.

148
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
They like to listen to consonant melodies

149
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
instead of dissonant melodies.

150
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Babies really are born

151
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
with a lot of innate pleasures.

152
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
There was once a statement made by a psychologist

153
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that said that 80 percent of the pursuit of happiness

154
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is really just about the genes,

155
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and it's as difficult to become happier as it is to become taller.

156
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
That's nonsense.

157
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
There is a decent contribution to happiness from the genes --

158
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
about 50 percent --

159
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but there is still that 50 percent that is unaccounted for.

160
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Let's just go into the brain for a moment,

161
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and see where does happiness

162
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
arise from in evolution.

163
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We have basically at least two systems here,

164
0:07:04.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and they both are very ancient.

165
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
One is the reward system,

166
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and that's fed by the chemical dopamine.

167
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And it starts in the ventral tegmental area.

168
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It goes to the nucleus accumbens,

169
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
all the way up to the prefrontal cortex, orbital frontal cortex,

170
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
where decisions are made, high level.

171
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
This was originally seen as a system

172
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that was the pleasure system of the brain.

173
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
In the 1950s,

174
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Olds and Milner put electrodes into the brain of a rat.

175
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And the rat would just keep pressing that bar

176
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
thousands and thousands and thousands of times.

177
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It wouldn't eat. It wouldn't sleep. It wouldn't have sex.

178
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It wouldn't do anything but press this bar.

179
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So they assumed

180
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
this must be, you know, the brain's orgasmatron.

181
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It turned out that it wasn't,

182
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that it really is a system of motivation,

183
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
a system of wanting.

184
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It gives objects what's called incentive salience.

185
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It makes something look so attractive

186
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that you just have to go after it.

187
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
That's something different

188
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
from the system that is the pleasure system,

189
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
which simply says, "I like this."

190
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The pleasure system, as you see,

191
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
which is the internal opiates, there is a hormone oxytocin,

192
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
is widely spread throughout the brain.

193
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Dopamine system, the wanting system,

194
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
is much more centralized.

195
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The other thing about positive emotions is that they have a universal signal.

196
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And we see here the smile.

197
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And the universal signal is not just raising the corner of the lips

198
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to the zygomatic major.

199
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It's also crinkling the outer corner of the eye,

200
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the orbicularis oculi.

201
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So you see, even 10-month-old babies, when they see their mother,

202
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
will show this particular kind of smile.

203
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Extroverts use it more than introverts.

204
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
People who are relieved of depression

205
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
show it more after than before.

206
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So if you want to unmask a true look of happiness,

207
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
you will look for this expression.

208
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Our pleasures are really ancient.

209
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And we learn, of course, many, many pleasures,

210
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but many of them are base. And one of them, of course, is biophilia --

211
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
that we have a response to the natural world

212
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that's very profound.

213
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Very interesting studies

214
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
done on people recovering from surgery,

215
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
who found that people who faced a brick wall

216
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
versus people who looked out on trees and nature,

217
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
the people who looked out on the brick wall

218
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
were in the hospital longer, needed more medication,

219
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and had more medical complications.

220
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
There is something very restorative about nature,

221
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and it's part of how we are tuned.

222
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Humans, particularly so, we're very imitative creatures.

223
0:09:21.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And we imitate from almost the second we are born.

224
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Here is a three-week-old baby.

225
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And if you stick your tongue out at this baby,

226
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
the baby will do the same.

227
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
We are social beings from the beginning.

228
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And even studies of cooperation

229
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
show that cooperation between individuals

230
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
lights up reward centers of the brain.

231
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
One problem that psychology has had

232
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
is instead of looking at this intersubjectivity --

233
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
or the importance of the social brain

234
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
to humans who come into the world helpless

235
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and need each other tremendously --

236
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
is that they focus instead on the self

237
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and self-esteem, and not self-other.

238
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It's sort of "me," not "we."

239
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And I think this has been a really tremendous problem

240
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that goes against our biology and nature,

241
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and hasn't made us any happier at all.

242
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Because when you think about it, people are happiest when in flow,

243
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
when they're absorbed in something out in the world,

244
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
when they're with other people, when they're active,

245
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
engaged in sports, focusing on a loved one,

246
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
learning, having sex, whatever.

247
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
They're not sitting in front of the mirror

248
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
trying to figure themselves out,

249
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
or thinking about themselves.

250
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
These are not the periods when you feel happiest.

251
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The other thing is, that a piece of evidence is,

252
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
is if you look at computerized text analysis

253
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
of people who commit suicide,

254
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
what you find there, and it's quite interesting,

255
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
is use of the first person singular --

256
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
"I," "me," "my,"

257
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
not "we" and "us" --

258
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and the letters are less hopeless

259
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
than they are really alone.

260
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And being alone is very unnatural to the human.

261
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
There is a profound need to belong.

262
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But there are ways in which our evolutionary history can really trip us up.

263
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Because, for example, the genes don't care whether we're happy,

264
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:57,000
they care that we replicate,

265
0:10:57.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that we pass our genes on.

266
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So for example we have three systems

267
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that underlie reproduction, because it's so important.

268
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
There's lust, which is just wanting to have sex.

269
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And that's really mediated by the sex hormones.

270
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Romantic attraction,

271
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that gets into the desire system.

272
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And that's dopamine-fed. And that's, "I must have this one person."

273
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
There's attachment, which is oxytocin,

274
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and the opiates, which says, "This is a long-term bond."

275
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
See the problem is that, as humans, these three can separate.

276
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So a person can be in a long term attachment,

277
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
become romantically infatuated with someone else,

278
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and want to have sex with a third person.

279
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
The other way in which our genes can sometimes lead us astray

280
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
is in social status.

281
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
We are very acutely aware of our social status

282
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and always seek to further and increase it.

283
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Now in the animal world, there is only one way to increase status,

284
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and that's dominance.

285
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I seize command by physical prowess,

286
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and I keep it by beating my chest,

287
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and you make submissive gestures.

288
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Now, the human has a whole other way to rise to the top,

289
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
and that is a prestige route,

290
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
which is freely conferred.

291
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Someone has expertise and knowledge, and knows how to do things,

292
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and we give that person status.

293
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And that's clearly the way for us to create many more niches of status

294
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
so that people don't have to be lower on the status hierarchy

295
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
as they are in the animal world.

296
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
The data isn't terribly supportive of money buying happiness.

297
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But it's not irrelevant.

298
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So if you look at questions like this, life satisfaction,

299
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
you see life satisfaction going up with each rung of income.

300
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
You see mental distress going up with lower income.

301
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So clearly there is some effect.

302
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
But the effect is relatively small.

303
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And one of the problems with money is materialism.

304
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
What happens when people pursue money too avidly,

305
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
is they forget about the real basic pleasures of life.

306
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So we have here, this couple.

307
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
"Do you think the less-fortunate are having better sex?"

308
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And then this kid over here is saying, "Leave me alone with my toys."

309
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
So one of the things is that it really takes over.

310
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
That whole dopamine-wanting system

311
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
takes over and derails from any of the pleasure system.

312
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
Maslow had this idea back in the 1950s

313
0:13:00.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that as people rise above their biological needs,

314
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
as the world becomes safer

315
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and we don't have to worry about basic needs being met --

316
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
our biological system, whatever motivates us, is being satisfied --

317
0:13:12.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
we can rise above them, to think beyond ourselves

318
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
toward self-actualization or transcendence,

319
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and rise above the materialist.

320
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So to just quickly conclude with some brief data

321
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
that suggests this might be so.

322
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
One is people who underwent what is called a quantum change:

323
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
they felt their life and their whole values had changed.

324
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And sure enough, if you look at the kinds of values that come in,

325
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
you see wealth, adventure, achievement, pleasure, fun, be respected,

326
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
before the change,

327
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and much more post-materialist values after.

328
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Women had a whole different set of value shifts.

329
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
But very similarly, the only one that survived there was happiness.

330
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
They went from attractiveness and happiness and wealth and self-control

331
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
to generosity and forgiveness.

332
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I end with a few quotes.

333
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
"There is only one question:

334
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
How to love this world?"

335
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And Rilke, "If your daily life seems poor,

336
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
do not blame it; blame yourself.

337
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Tell yourself that you are not poet enough

338
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
to call forth its riches."

339
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
"First, say to yourself what you would be.

340
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Then do what you have to do."

341
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Thank you.

342
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Applause)

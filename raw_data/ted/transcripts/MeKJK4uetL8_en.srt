1
0:00:13.247,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The world is awash with divisive arguments,

2
0:00:18.884,000 --> 0:00:19,000
conflict,

3
0:00:20.781,000 --> 0:00:21,000
fake news,

4
0:00:22.618,000 --> 0:00:23,000
victimhood,

5
0:00:25.146,000 --> 0:00:3,000
exploitation, prejudice, bigotry, blame, shouting

6
0:00:30.871,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and minuscule attention spans.

7
0:00:34.859,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It can sometimes seem that we are doomed to take sides,

8
0:00:40.072,000 --> 0:00:42,000
be stuck in echo chambers

9
0:00:42.358,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and never agree again.

10
0:00:45.342,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It can sometimes seem like a race to the bottom,

11
0:00:48.367,000 --> 0:00:52,000
where everyone is calling out somebody else's privilege

12
0:00:52.409,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and vying to show that they are the most hard-done-by person

13
0:00:57.547,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in the conversation.

14
0:01:01.033,000 --> 0:01:02,000
How can we make sense

15
0:01:02.887,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in a world that doesn't?

16
0:01:07.604,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I have a tool for understanding this confusing world of ours,

17
0:01:12.385,000 --> 0:01:14,000
a tool that you might not expect:

18
0:01:16.194,000 --> 0:01:17,000
abstract mathematics.

19
0:01:19.268,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I am a pure mathematician.

20
0:01:22.063,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Traditionally, pure maths is like the theory of maths,

21
0:01:26.1,000 --> 0:01:31,000
where applied maths is applied to real problems like building bridges

22
0:01:31.293,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and flying planes

23
0:01:32.832,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and controlling traffic flow.

24
0:01:35.894,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But I'm going to talk about a way that pure maths applies directly

25
0:01:40.844,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to our daily lives

26
0:01:42.377,000 --> 0:01:43,000
as a way of thinking.

27
0:01:44.931,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I don't solve quadratic equations to help me with my daily life,

28
0:01:49.143,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but I do use mathematical thinking to help me understand arguments

29
0:01:54.309,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and to empathize with other people.

30
0:01:57.501,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And so pure maths helps me with the entire human world.

31
0:02:04.434,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But before I talk about the entire human world,

32
0:02:07.569,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I need to talk about something that you might think of

33
0:02:10.653,000 --> 0:02:12,000
as irrelevant schools maths:

34
0:02:13.974,000 --> 0:02:15,000
factors of numbers.

35
0:02:16.077,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We're going to start by thinking about the factors of 30.

36
0:02:19.657,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now, if this makes you shudder with bad memories of school maths lessons,

37
0:02:24.397,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I sympathize, because I found school maths lessons boring, too.

38
0:02:29.48,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But I'm pretty sure we are going to take this in a direction

39
0:02:33.387,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that is very different from what happened at school.

40
0:02:37.718,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So what are the factors of 30?

41
0:02:39.468,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Well, they're the numbers that go into 30.

42
0:02:42.717,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Maybe you can remember them. We'll work them out.

43
0:02:45.142,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's one, two, three,

44
0:02:48.98,000 --> 0:02:5,000
five, six,

45
0:02:51.096,000 --> 0:02:53,000
10, 15 and 30.

46
0:02:53.98,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It's not very interesting.

47
0:02:55.957,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It's a bunch of numbers in a straight line.

48
0:02:58.826,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We can make it more interesting

49
0:03:00.373,000 --> 0:03:03,000
by thinking about which of these numbers are also factors of each other

50
0:03:04.087,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and drawing a picture, a bit like a family tree,

51
0:03:06.639,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to show those relationships.

52
0:03:08.369,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So 30 is going to be at the top like a kind of great-grandparent.

53
0:03:12.463,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Six, 10 and 15 go into 30.

54
0:03:15.689,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Five goes into 10 and 15.

55
0:03:18.945,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Two goes into six and 10.

56
0:03:21.656,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Three goes into six and 15.

57
0:03:24.967,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And one goes into two, three and five.

58
0:03:29.175,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So now we see that 10 is not divisible by three,

59
0:03:32.934,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but that this is the corners of a cube,

60
0:03:36.138,000 --> 0:03:38,000
which is, I think, a bit more interesting

61
0:03:38.243,000 --> 0:03:4,000
than a bunch of numbers in a straight line.

62
0:03:41.756,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We can see something more here. There's a hierarchy going on.

63
0:03:44.69,000 --> 0:03:45,000
At the bottom level is the number one,

64
0:03:46.585,000 --> 0:03:48,000
then there's the numbers two, three and five,

65
0:03:48.853,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and nothing goes into those except one and themselves.

66
0:03:51.687,000 --> 0:03:53,000
You might remember this means they're prime.

67
0:03:54.141,000 --> 0:03:57,000
At the next level up, we have six, 10 and 15,

68
0:03:57.198,000 --> 0:04:,000
and each of those is a product of two prime factors.

69
0:04:00.73,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So six is two times three,

70
0:04:02.696,000 --> 0:04:03,000
10 is two times five,

71
0:04:04.391,000 --> 0:04:05,000
15 is three times five.

72
0:04:06.376,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And then at the top, we have 30,

73
0:04:08.365,000 --> 0:04:1,000
which is a product of three prime numbers --

74
0:04:10.884,000 --> 0:04:12,000
two times three times five.

75
0:04:12.961,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So I could redraw this diagram using those numbers instead.

76
0:04:18.335,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We see that we've got two, three and five at the top,

77
0:04:21.427,000 --> 0:04:24,000
we have pairs of numbers at the next level,

78
0:04:24.523,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and we have single elements at the next level

79
0:04:26.934,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and then the empty set at the bottom.

80
0:04:29.271,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And each of those arrows shows losing one of your numbers in the set.

81
0:04:34.674,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now maybe it can be clear

82
0:04:37.315,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that it doesn't really matter what those numbers are.

83
0:04:40.197,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In fact, it doesn't matter what they are.

84
0:04:42.18,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So we could replace them with something like A, B and C instead,

85
0:04:46.6,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and we get the same picture.

86
0:04:49.025,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So now this has become very abstract.

87
0:04:51.626,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The numbers have turned into letters.

88
0:04:54.091,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But there is a point to this abstraction,

89
0:04:57.593,000 --> 0:05:01,000
which is that it now suddenly becomes very widely applicable,

90
0:05:02.202,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because A, B and C could be anything.

91
0:05:06.291,000 --> 0:05:1,000
For example, they could be three types of privilege:

92
0:05:10.633,000 --> 0:05:12,000
rich, white and male.

93
0:05:14.386,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So then at the next level, we have rich white people.

94
0:05:18.368,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Here we have rich male people.

95
0:05:20.873,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Here we have white male people.

96
0:05:22.946,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Then we have rich, white and male.

97
0:05:27.209,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And finally, people with none of those types of privilege.

98
0:05:30.365,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And I'm going to put back in the rest of the adjectives for emphasis.

99
0:05:33.658,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So here we have rich, white non-male people,

100
0:05:36.712,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to remind us that there are nonbinary people we need to include.

101
0:05:39.785,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Here we have rich, nonwhite male people.

102
0:05:42.462,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Here we have non-rich, white male people,

103
0:05:45.782,000 --> 0:05:47,000
rich, nonwhite, non-male,

104
0:05:48.508,000 --> 0:05:5,000
non-rich, white, non-male

105
0:05:51.083,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and non-rich, nonwhite, male.

106
0:05:53.442,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And at the bottom, with the least privilege,

107
0:05:55.663,000 --> 0:05:59,000
non-rich, nonwhite, non-male people.

108
0:05:59.73,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We have gone from a diagram of factors of 30

109
0:06:03.566,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to a diagram of interaction of different types of privilege.

110
0:06:08.068,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And there are many things we can learn from this diagram, I think.

111
0:06:11.714,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The first is that each arrow represents a direct loss of one type of privilege.

112
0:06:19.331,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Sometimes people mistakenly think that white privilege means

113
0:06:23.838,000 --> 0:06:27,000
all white people are better off than all nonwhite people.

114
0:06:28.41,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Some people point at superrich black sports stars and say,

115
0:06:32.146,000 --> 0:06:35,000
"See? They're really rich. White privilege doesn't exist."

116
0:06:36.116,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But that's not what the theory of white privilege says.

117
0:06:39.169,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It says that if that superrich sports star had all the same characteristics

118
0:06:44.431,000 --> 0:06:45,000
but they were also white,

119
0:06:45.931,000 --> 0:06:48,000
we would expect them to be better off in society.

120
0:06:51.302,000 --> 0:06:53,000
There is something else we can understand from this diagram

121
0:06:54.111,000 --> 0:06:55,000
if we look along a row.

122
0:06:56.121,000 --> 0:07:,000
If we look along the second-to-top row, where people have two types of privilege,

123
0:07:00.426,000 --> 0:07:03,000
we might be able to see that they're not all particularly equal.

124
0:07:04.406,000 --> 0:07:1,000
For example, rich white women are probably much better off in society

125
0:07:10.509,000 --> 0:07:12,000
than poor white men,

126
0:07:12.728,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and rich black men are probably somewhere in between.

127
0:07:15.758,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So it's really more skewed like this,

128
0:07:18.559,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and the same on the bottom level.

129
0:07:20.99,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But we can actually take it further

130
0:07:23.105,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and look at the interactions between those two middle levels.

131
0:07:27.076,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Because rich, nonwhite non-men might well be better off in society

132
0:07:33.036,000 --> 0:07:35,000
than poor white men.

133
0:07:35.153,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Think about some extreme examples, like Michelle Obama,

134
0:07:39.085,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Oprah Winfrey.

135
0:07:40.527,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They're definitely better off than poor, white, unemployed homeless men.

136
0:07:46.164,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So actually, the diagram is more skewed like this.

137
0:07:49.519,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And that tension exists

138
0:07:52.246,000 --> 0:07:55,000
between the layers of privilege in the diagram

139
0:07:55.509,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and the absolute privilege that people experience in society.

140
0:07:59.198,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And this has helped me to understand why some poor white men

141
0:08:02.896,000 --> 0:08:05,000
are so angry in society at the moment.

142
0:08:06.329,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Because they are considered to be high up in this cuboid of privilege,

143
0:08:10.78,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but in terms of absolute privilege, they don't actually feel the effect of it.

144
0:08:15.587,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And I believe that understanding the root of that anger

145
0:08:19.057,000 --> 0:08:23,000
is much more productive than just being angry at them in return.

146
0:08:25.289,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Seeing these abstract structures can also help us switch contexts

147
0:08:29.863,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and see that different people are at the top in different contexts.

148
0:08:33.533,000 --> 0:08:34,000
In our original diagram,

149
0:08:35.337,000 --> 0:08:37,000
rich white men were at the top,

150
0:08:37.364,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but if we restricted our attention to non-men,

151
0:08:41.09,000 --> 0:08:42,000
we would see that they are here,

152
0:08:42.804,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and now the rich, white non-men are at the top.

153
0:08:45.559,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So we could move to a whole context of women,

154
0:08:48.428,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and our three types of privilege could now be rich, white and cisgendered.

155
0:08:53.596,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Remember that "cisgendered" means that your gender identity does match

156
0:08:57.325,000 --> 0:08:58,000
the gender you were assigned at birth.

157
0:09:00.021,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So now we see that rich, white cis women occupy the analogous situation

158
0:09:06.057,000 --> 0:09:09,000
that rich white men did in broader society.

159
0:09:09.255,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And this has helped me understand why there is so much anger

160
0:09:12.707,000 --> 0:09:13,000
towards rich white women,

161
0:09:14.384,000 --> 0:09:17,000
especially in some parts of the feminist movement at the moment,

162
0:09:17.93,000 --> 0:09:2,000
because perhaps they're prone to seeing themselves as underprivileged

163
0:09:21.614,000 --> 0:09:22,000
relative to white men,

164
0:09:23.451,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and they forget how overprivileged they are relative to nonwhite women.

165
0:09:30.554,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We can all use these abstract structures to help us pivot between situations

166
0:09:36.018,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in which we are more privileged and less privileged.

167
0:09:38.634,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We are all more privileged than somebody

168
0:09:41.181,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and less privileged than somebody else.

169
0:09:44.738,000 --> 0:09:48,000
For example, I know and I feel that as an Asian person,

170
0:09:49.546,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I am less privileged than white people

171
0:09:52.3,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because of white privilege.

172
0:09:53.799,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But I also understand

173
0:09:55.471,000 --> 0:09:59,000
that I am probably among the most privileged of nonwhite people,

174
0:09:59.624,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and this helps me pivot between those two contexts.

175
0:10:03.595,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And in terms of wealth,

176
0:10:05.312,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I don't think I'm super rich.

177
0:10:07.179,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I'm not as rich as the kind of people who don't have to work.

178
0:10:10.248,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But I am doing fine,

179
0:10:11.82,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and that's a much better situation to be in

180
0:10:13.999,000 --> 0:10:14,000
than people who are really struggling,

181
0:10:15.834,000 --> 0:10:18,000
maybe are unemployed or working at minimum wage.

182
0:10:20.566,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I perform these pivots in my head

183
0:10:24.016,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to help me understand experiences from other people's points of view,

184
0:10:30.412,000 --> 0:10:33,000
which brings me to this possibly surprising conclusion:

185
0:10:35.242,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that abstract mathematics is highly relevant to our daily lives

186
0:10:42.1,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and can even help us to understand and empathize with other people.

187
0:10:50.584,000 --> 0:10:55,000
My wish is that everybody would try to understand other people more

188
0:10:56.247,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and work with them together,

189
0:10:58.187,000 --> 0:11:,000
rather than competing with them

190
0:11:00.232,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and trying to show that they're wrong.

191
0:11:04.031,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And I believe that abstract mathematical thinking

192
0:11:08.622,000 --> 0:11:1,000
can help us achieve that.

193
0:11:12.265,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Thank you.

194
0:11:13.494,000 --> 0:11:17,000

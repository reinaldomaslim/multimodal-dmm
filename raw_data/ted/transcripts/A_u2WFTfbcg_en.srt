1
0:00:12.786,000 --> 0:00:13,000
It's 2008,

2
0:00:14.571,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I'm just finishing my first year of design school.

3
0:00:19.074,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And I'm at my first year-end review,

4
0:00:21.955,000 --> 0:00:27,000
which is a form of ritual torture for design students,

5
0:00:28.846,000 --> 0:00:31,000
where they make you take everything you made over the course of the year

6
0:00:32.593,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and lay it out on a table

7
0:00:34.957,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and stand next to it while a bunch of professors,

8
0:00:37.842,000 --> 0:00:39,000
most of whom you've never seen before,

9
0:00:40.587,000 --> 0:00:42,000
give you their unfiltered opinions of it.

10
0:00:44.699,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So it's my turn and I'm standing next to my table,

11
0:00:47.914,000 --> 0:00:49,000
everything neatly lined up,

12
0:00:50.734,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and I'm just hoping that my professors can see

13
0:00:54.558,000 --> 0:00:59,000
how much effort I've put into making my designs practical

14
0:01:00.155,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and ergonomic and sustainable.

15
0:01:05.43,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And I'm starting to get really nervous,

16
0:01:07.314,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because for a long time, no one says anything.

17
0:01:10.629,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's just completely silent.

18
0:01:13.067,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And then one of the professors starts to speak, and he says,

19
0:01:15.971,000 --> 0:01:17,000
"Your work gives me a feeling of joy."

20
0:01:19.407,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Joy?

21
0:01:21.467,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I wanted to be a designer because I wanted to solve real problems.

22
0:01:24.874,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Joy is nice, I guess, but it's kind of light --

23
0:01:29.256,000 --> 0:01:3,000
not substantial.

24
0:01:31.921,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But I was also kind of intrigued,

25
0:01:33.517,000 --> 0:01:37,000
because joy is this intangible feeling,

26
0:01:38.028,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and how does that come from the stuff on the table next to me?

27
0:01:42.468,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I asked the professors,

28
0:01:43.71,000 --> 0:01:45,000
"How do things make us feel joy?

29
0:01:46.143,000 --> 0:01:5,000
How do tangible things make us feel intangible joy?"

30
0:01:52.306,000 --> 0:01:56,000
They hemmed and hawed and gestured a lot with their hands.

31
0:01:57.03,000 --> 0:01:58,000
"They just do," they said.

32
0:01:59.907,000 --> 0:02:,000
I packed up my things for the summer,

33
0:02:01.759,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but I couldn't stop thinking about this question ...

34
0:02:06.107,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and this launched a journey --

35
0:02:07.6,000 --> 0:02:1,000
one that I didn't know at the time would take me 10 years --

36
0:02:10.756,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to understand the relationship between the physical world

37
0:02:14.243,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and the mysterious, quixotic emotion we call "joy."

38
0:02:20.007,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And what I discovered is that not only are they linked,

39
0:02:24.161,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but that the physical world can be a powerful resource to us

40
0:02:27.819,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in creating happier, healthier lives.

41
0:02:32.362,000 --> 0:02:33,000
After my review,

42
0:02:33.565,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I thought, "I know what joy feels like,

43
0:02:36.062,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but what is it, exactly?"

44
0:02:38.717,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And I found that even scientists don't always agree,

45
0:02:42.168,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and they sometimes use the words "joy" and "happiness" and "positivity"

46
0:02:45.667,000 --> 0:02:46,000
more or less interchangeably.

47
0:02:48.989,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But broadly speaking, when psychologists use the word joy,

48
0:02:51.902,000 --> 0:02:54,000
what they mean is an intense, momentary experience

49
0:02:55.331,000 --> 0:02:56,000
of positive emotion --

50
0:02:56.798,000 --> 0:02:59,000
one that makes us smile and laugh and feel like we want to jump up and down.

51
0:03:01.152,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And this is actually a technical thing.

52
0:03:03.035,000 --> 0:03:05,000
That feeling of wanting to jump up and down

53
0:03:05.06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is one of the ways that scientists measure joy.

54
0:03:09.387,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's different than happiness,

55
0:03:11.029,000 --> 0:03:13,000
which measures how good we feel over time.

56
0:03:13.688,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Joy is about feeling good in the moment,

57
0:03:16.696,000 --> 0:03:17,000
right now.

58
0:03:19.007,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And this was interesting to me

59
0:03:20.505,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because as a culture, we are obsessed with the pursuit of happiness,

60
0:03:24.047,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and yet in the process, we kind of overlook joy.

61
0:03:30.737,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So this got me thinking:

62
0:03:33.928,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Where does joy come from?

63
0:03:36.797,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I started asking everyone I knew,

64
0:03:38.394,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and even people I just met on the street,

65
0:03:41.359,000 --> 0:03:42,000
about the things that brought them joy.

66
0:03:43.243,000 --> 0:03:45,000
On the subway, in a café, on an airplane,

67
0:03:46.18,000 --> 0:03:49,000
it was, "Hi, nice to meet you. What brings you joy?"

68
0:03:50.544,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I felt like a detective.

69
0:03:52.867,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I was like, "When did you last see it?

70
0:03:54.816,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Who were you with? What color was it?

71
0:03:56.627,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Did anyone else see it?"

72
0:03:58.353,000 --> 0:04:,000
I was the Nancy Drew of joy.

73
0:04:00.631,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

74
0:04:02.579,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And after a few months of this, I noticed that there were certain things

75
0:04:05.984,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that started to come up again and again and again.

76
0:04:09.061,000 --> 0:04:12,000
They were things like cherry blossoms

77
0:04:12.368,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and bubbles ...

78
0:04:14.81,000 --> 0:04:17,000
swimming pools and tree houses ...

79
0:04:19.728,000 --> 0:04:22,000
hot air balloons and googly eyes --

80
0:04:23.47,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:24.573,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and ice cream cones, especially the ones with the sprinkles.

82
0:04:29.172,000 --> 0:04:33,000
These things seemed to cut across lines of age and gender and ethnicity.

83
0:04:34.543,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I mean, if you think about it,

84
0:04:36.044,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we all stop and turn our heads to the sky

85
0:04:38.028,000 --> 0:04:4,000
when the multicolored arc of a rainbow streaks across it.

86
0:04:41.909,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And fireworks --

87
0:04:43.472,000 --> 0:04:45,000
we don't even need to know what they're for,

88
0:04:45.584,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and we feel like we're celebrating, too.

89
0:04:50.86,000 --> 0:04:52,000
These things aren't joyful for just a few people;

90
0:04:53.632,000 --> 0:04:55,000
they're joyful for nearly everyone.

91
0:04:56.485,000 --> 0:04:58,000
They're universally joyful.

92
0:05:00.504,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And seeing them all together,

93
0:05:02.907,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it gave me this indescribably hopeful feeling.

94
0:05:08.012,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The sharply divided, politically polarized world we live in

95
0:05:11.125,000 --> 0:05:16,000
sometimes has the effect of making our differences feel so vast

96
0:05:16.179,000 --> 0:05:17,000
as to be insurmountable.

97
0:05:18.104,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And yet underneath it all,

98
0:05:19.42,000 --> 0:05:22,000
there's a part of each of us that finds joy in the same things.

99
0:05:24.156,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And though we're often told that these are just passing pleasures,

100
0:05:28.307,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in fact, they're really important,

101
0:05:30.885,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because they remind us of the shared humanity we find

102
0:05:34.361,000 --> 0:05:36,000
in our common experience of the physical world.

103
0:05:38.309,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But I still needed to know:

104
0:05:39.778,000 --> 0:05:43,000
What is it about these things that makes them so joyful?

105
0:05:45.299,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I had pictures of them up on my studio wall,

106
0:05:48.231,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and every day, I would come in and try to make sense of it.

107
0:05:52.662,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And then one day, something just clicked.

108
0:05:56.144,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I saw all these patterns:

109
0:05:59.422,000 --> 0:06:,000
round things ...

110
0:06:01.969,000 --> 0:06:02,000
pops of bright color ...

111
0:06:05.512,000 --> 0:06:06,000
symmetrical shapes ...

112
0:06:08.636,000 --> 0:06:1,000
a sense of abundance and multiplicity ...

113
0:06:12.877,000 --> 0:06:15,000
a feeling of lightness or elevation.

114
0:06:17.328,000 --> 0:06:18,000
When I saw it this way,

115
0:06:18.503,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I realized that though the feeling of joy is mysterious and elusive,

116
0:06:22.606,000 --> 0:06:25,000
we can access it through tangible, physical attributes,

117
0:06:25.948,000 --> 0:06:27,000
or what designers call aesthetics,

118
0:06:28.786,000 --> 0:06:31,000
a word that comes from the same root as the Greek word "aísthomai,"

119
0:06:32.456,000 --> 0:06:35,000
which means, "I feel," "I sense," "I perceive."

120
0:06:37.668,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And since these patterns were telling me that joy begins with the senses,

121
0:06:42.143,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I began calling them "Aesthetics of Joy";

122
0:06:45.01,000 --> 0:06:46,000
the sensations of joy.

123
0:06:48.484,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And in the wake of this discovery,

124
0:06:50.136,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I noticed something that as I walked around,

125
0:06:52.305,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I began spotting little moments of joy everywhere I went --

126
0:06:57.42,000 --> 0:06:58,000
a vintage yellow car

127
0:06:58.8,000 --> 0:06:59,000
or a clever piece of street art.

128
0:07:00.746,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It was like I had a pair of rose-colored glasses,

129
0:07:05.503,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and now that I knew what to look for,

130
0:07:08.387,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I was seeing it everywhere.

131
0:07:09.765,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It was like these little moments of joy were hidden in plain sight.

132
0:07:14.87,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And at the same time,

133
0:07:16.472,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I had another realization,

134
0:07:17.829,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that if these are the things that bring us joy,

135
0:07:20.902,000 --> 0:07:22,000
then why does so much of the world look like this?

136
0:07:23.401,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Laughter)

137
0:07:25.014,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Why do we go to work here?

138
0:07:27.476,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Why do we send our kids to schools that look like this?

139
0:07:31.384,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Why do our cities look like this?

140
0:07:34.256,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And this is most acute for the places that house the people

141
0:07:39.091,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that are most vulnerable among us:

142
0:07:41.243,000 --> 0:07:42,000
nursing homes,

143
0:07:43.312,000 --> 0:07:44,000
hospitals,

144
0:07:45.413,000 --> 0:07:46,000
homeless shelters,

145
0:07:47.473,000 --> 0:07:48,000
housing projects.

146
0:07:49.925,000 --> 0:07:52,000
How did we end up in a world that looks like this?

147
0:07:54.992,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We all start out joyful,

148
0:07:57.094,000 --> 0:08:,000
but as we get older,

149
0:08:00.692,000 --> 0:08:04,000
being colorful or exuberant opens us up to judgment.

150
0:08:05.883,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Adults who exhibit genuine joy are often dismissed as childish

151
0:08:11.082,000 --> 0:08:13,000
or too feminine

152
0:08:13.166,000 --> 0:08:15,000
or unserious

153
0:08:15.352,000 --> 0:08:16,000
or self-indulgent,

154
0:08:18.139,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and so we hold ourselves back from joy,

155
0:08:21.758,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and we end up in a world that looks like this.

156
0:08:25.936,000 --> 0:08:26,000
But if the aesthetics of joy can be used

157
0:08:27.866,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to help us find more joy in the world around us,

158
0:08:30.152,000 --> 0:08:32,000
then couldn't they also be used to create more joy?

159
0:08:33.537,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I spent that last two years scouring the planet,

160
0:08:35.995,000 --> 0:08:38,000
looking for different ways that people have answered this question.

161
0:08:40.719,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And this led me to the work of the artist Arakawa

162
0:08:43.256,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and the poet Madeline Gins,

163
0:08:45.011,000 --> 0:08:49,000
who believed that these kinds of environments are literally killing us.

164
0:08:50.686,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And so they set out the create an apartment building

165
0:08:54.543,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that they believed would reverse aging.

166
0:08:58.313,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And this is it.

167
0:09:00.026,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

168
0:09:03.265,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Applause)

169
0:09:06.782,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's a real place, just outside Tokyo.

170
0:09:09.775,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I spent a night there, and it's a lot.

171
0:09:13.426,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Laughter)

172
0:09:16.149,000 --> 0:09:17,000
The floors undulate,

173
0:09:17.91,000 --> 0:09:19,000
so you don't end up walking around

174
0:09:20.199,000 --> 0:09:22,000
so much as kind of bouncing around the apartment,

175
0:09:22.725,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and there are bright colors in every direction.

176
0:09:28.265,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I'm not sure I left any younger,

177
0:09:30.626,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but it's as if, by trying to create an apartment

178
0:09:34.854,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that would make us feel youthful,

179
0:09:36.95,000 --> 0:09:39,000
they ended up creating one that was joyful.

180
0:09:41.277,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And yes, this is a bit much for everyday life,

181
0:09:43.833,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but it made me wonder: What about the rest of us?

182
0:09:47.263,000 --> 0:09:51,000
How do we bring these ideas back into the real world?

183
0:09:52.621,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So I started finding people who were doing just that.

184
0:09:55.939,000 --> 0:09:59,000
For example, this hospital, designed by the Danish artist Poul Gernes.

185
0:10:00.674,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Or these schools,

186
0:10:02.178,000 --> 0:10:04,000
transformed by the non-profit Publicolor.

187
0:10:05.195,000 --> 0:10:08,000
What's interesting is that Publicolor has heard from school administrators

188
0:10:08.758,000 --> 0:10:11,000
who say that attendance improves,

189
0:10:11.912,000 --> 0:10:12,000
graffiti disappears

190
0:10:13.812,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and kids actually say they feel safer in these painted schools.

191
0:10:18.09,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And this aligns with research conducted in four countries,

192
0:10:21.111,000 --> 0:10:24,000
which shows that people working in more colorful offices

193
0:10:24.762,000 --> 0:10:25,000
are actually more alert,

194
0:10:26.441,000 --> 0:10:27,000
more confident

195
0:10:27.722,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and friendlier than those working in drab spaces.

196
0:10:32.62,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Why would this be the case?

197
0:10:34.236,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Well, as I started to trace back our love of color,

198
0:10:38.251,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I found that some researchers see a connection to our evolution.

199
0:10:43.292,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Color, in a very primal way, is a sign of life, a sign of energy.

200
0:10:49.063,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And the same is true of abundance.

201
0:10:51.116,000 --> 0:10:54,000
We evolved in a world where scarcity is dangerous,

202
0:10:54.49,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and abundance meant survival.

203
0:10:58.091,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So, one confetto --

204
0:11:01.338,000 --> 0:11:03,000
which happens to be the singular of confetti,

205
0:11:03.592,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in case you were wondering --

206
0:11:05.013,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Laughter)

207
0:11:06.402,000 --> 0:11:08,000
isn't very joyful,

208
0:11:08.487,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but multiply it,

209
0:11:09.934,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and you have a handful of one of the most joyful substances

210
0:11:12.721,000 --> 0:11:13,000
on the planet.

211
0:11:14.494,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The architect Emmanuelle Moureaux uses this idea in her work a lot.

212
0:11:18.503,000 --> 0:11:19,000
This is a nursing home she designed,

213
0:11:20.319,000 --> 0:11:24,000
where she uses these multicolored spheres to create a feeling of abundance.

214
0:11:25.752,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And what about all those round things I noticed?

215
0:11:29.159,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Well, it turns out neuroscientists have studied this, too.

216
0:11:32.475,000 --> 0:11:34,000
They put people into fMRI machines,

217
0:11:34.92,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and they showed them pictures of angular objects and round ones.

218
0:11:40.011,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And what they found is that the amygdala,

219
0:11:42.441,000 --> 0:11:45,000
a part of the brain associated in part with fear and anxiety,

220
0:11:46.091,000 --> 0:11:48,000
lit up when people looked at angular objects,

221
0:11:48.304,000 --> 0:11:5,000
but not when they looked at the round ones.

222
0:11:51.31,000 --> 0:11:54,000
They speculate that because angles in nature

223
0:11:54.854,000 --> 0:11:57,000
are often associated with objects that might be dangerous to us,

224
0:11:58.411,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that we evolved an unconscious sense of caution around these shapes,

225
0:12:03.45,000 --> 0:12:05,000
whereas curves set us at ease.

226
0:12:06.637,000 --> 0:12:09,000
You can see this in action in the new Sandy Hook Elementary School.

227
0:12:11.257,000 --> 0:12:13,000
After the mass shooting there in 2012,

228
0:12:13.284,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the architects Svigals + Partners

229
0:12:15.277,000 --> 0:12:18,000
knew that they needed to create a building that was secure,

230
0:12:18.564,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but they wanted to create one that was joyful,

231
0:12:20.835,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and so they filled it with curves.

232
0:12:22.552,000 --> 0:12:24,000
There are waves running along the side of the building,

233
0:12:25.417,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and these squiggly canopies over the entryway,

234
0:12:28.782,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and the whole building bends toward the entrance

235
0:12:31.71,000 --> 0:12:32,000
in a welcoming gesture.

236
0:12:35.726,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Each moment of joy is small,

237
0:12:38.373,000 --> 0:12:42,000
but over time, they add up to more than the sum of their parts.

238
0:12:44.553,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And so maybe instead of chasing after happiness,

239
0:12:47.916,000 --> 0:12:5,000
what we should be doing is embracing joy

240
0:12:51.118,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and finding ways to put ourselves in the path of it more often.

241
0:12:57.697,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Deep within us,

242
0:12:58.91,000 --> 0:13:02,000
we all have this impulse to seek out joy in our surroundings.

243
0:13:04.453,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And we have it for a reason.

244
0:13:07.223,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Joy isn't some superfluous extra.

245
0:13:11.573,000 --> 0:13:16,000
It's directly connected to our fundamental instinct for survival.

246
0:13:17.885,000 --> 0:13:19,000
On the most basic level,

247
0:13:20.153,000 --> 0:13:24,000
the drive toward joy is the drive toward life.

248
0:13:25.534,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Thank you.

249
0:13:26.708,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Applause)

250
0:13:28.616,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Thank you.

251
0:13:29.791,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Thank you,

252
0:13:31.001,000 --> 0:13:32,000
thank you.

253
0:13:32.176,000 --> 0:13:37,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.792,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hi everybody.

2
0:00:14.083,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My name is Matt Cutts,

3
0:00:15.375,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I worked at Google for almost 17 years.

4
0:00:19.833,000 --> 0:00:2,000
As a distinguished engineer there,

5
0:00:21.75,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I was pretty close to the top of the Silicon Valley ecosystem.

6
0:00:25.917,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Then I decided to follow some inspiring folks

7
0:00:28.958,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and do a short tour at the US Digital Service.

8
0:00:33.042,000 --> 0:00:36,000
That's the group of geeks that helped rescue HealthCare.gov

9
0:00:36.25,000 --> 0:00:39,000
when that website went down hard in 2013.

10
0:00:40.042,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Yeah.

11
0:00:41.333,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So I signed up for a three-to-six-month tour,

12
0:00:43.958,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and almost three years later,

13
0:00:46.417,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I'm still in Washington DC,

14
0:00:48.5,000 --> 0:00:49,000
working for the federal government,

15
0:00:50.25,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because the government really needs technologists right now.

16
0:00:54.167,000 --> 0:00:55,000
At my old job,

17
0:00:55.458,000 --> 0:00:57,000
every room had videoconferencing

18
0:00:58.083,000 --> 0:01:,000
integrated with calendars,

19
0:01:00.292,000 --> 0:01:04,000
power cables were built right into the furniture.

20
0:01:04.417,000 --> 0:01:06,000
When I moved to a government agency,

21
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I had to call a person to set up a phone conference.

22
0:01:09.958,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And when we moved to a new office,

23
0:01:11.708,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we didn't have furniture for a while,

24
0:01:13.583,000 --> 0:01:15,000
so we set up the phone on a trash can.

25
0:01:17.625,000 --> 0:01:2,000
One of the things that surprised me, whenever I moved to DC,

26
0:01:20.917,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is how much the government still has to deal with paper.

27
0:01:25.5,000 --> 0:01:27,000
This is a facility in Winston-Salem,

28
0:01:27.542,000 --> 0:01:28,000
North Carolina,

29
0:01:28.958,000 --> 0:01:29,000
where people were worried

30
0:01:30.542,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that the building might be structurally unsound

31
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
from the weight of all that paper.

32
0:01:36.292,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Yeah.

33
0:01:37.583,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Paper has some downsides.

34
0:01:38.875,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Here's a pop quiz:

35
0:01:40.167,000 --> 0:01:43,000
If your last name starts with H or higher,

36
0:01:44.125,000 --> 0:01:47,000
H or higher, would you raise your hand?

37
0:01:48.667,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Wow.

38
0:01:49.958,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I have some bad news:

39
0:01:51.25,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Your veteran records might have been destroyed

40
0:01:53.458,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in a fire in 1973.

41
0:01:54.792,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

42
0:01:55.833,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Yeah.

43
0:01:57.125,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Paper processes are also slower and more prone to errors.

44
0:02:01.958,000 --> 0:02:02,000
If you're a veteran

45
0:02:03.25,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and you're applying for your health benefits

46
0:02:05.375,000 --> 0:02:06,000
using a paper form,

47
0:02:06.667,000 --> 0:02:1,000
you might have to wait months for that form to be processed.

48
0:02:10.875,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We replaced that with a web form,

49
0:02:13.292,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and now most veterans find out

50
0:02:15.042,000 --> 0:02:17,000
if they can get access to their health benefits

51
0:02:17.417,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in 10 minutes.

52
0:02:18.958,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Applause)

53
0:02:21.75,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Here's another launch that I'm proud of.

54
0:02:23.708,000 --> 0:02:25,000
We worked with the Small Business Administration

55
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to move one of their systems from paper to digital.

56
0:02:29.25,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So this is a picture from before,

57
0:02:31.25,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and this is afterwards.

58
0:02:33.75,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Same cubicles, same people,

59
0:02:36.208,000 --> 0:02:38,000
just a better system for everyone.

60
0:02:39.417,000 --> 0:02:42,000
At one point, we wanted to celebrate modernizing a different system,

61
0:02:42.667,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and so we went to a local grocery store

62
0:02:44.583,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and we said, "Can you make a cake

63
0:02:46.25,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and decorate it with the form that we've digitized?"

64
0:02:49.208,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And the grocery store got really weirded out by that request.

65
0:02:52.792,000 --> 0:02:55,000
They wanted a letter on official government letterhead.

66
0:02:55.917,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Well, we work for the government, so we wrote a letter that said,

67
0:02:59.083,000 --> 0:03:01,000
"You can use this public-domain form

68
0:03:01.5,000 --> 0:03:04,000
on a cake for celebratory purposes."

69
0:03:04.625,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:06.667,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Which led to bad jokes about filling forms out in triplicake.

71
0:03:09.625,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Yes, dad jokes in government.

72
0:03:11.5,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Now I've talked a lot about paper,

73
0:03:14.333,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but we also bring up computer systems that go down.

74
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We bring in modern technology practices,

75
0:03:20.375,000 --> 0:03:23,000
like user-centered design and the cloud,

76
0:03:23.625,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and we also help improve procurement.

77
0:03:26.5,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It turns out government buys software

78
0:03:29.375,000 --> 0:03:33,000
the same way that it buys chairs and brownies and tanks:

79
0:03:34.167,000 --> 0:03:39,000
from government regulations that are over 1,000 pages long.

80
0:03:39.292,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So yes, there's some stuff that's messed up in government right now.

81
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But if you think Silicon Valley is the savior in this story,

82
0:03:46.167,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughs)

83
0:03:47.458,000 --> 0:03:48,000
you've got another thing coming.

84
0:03:49.25,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Some of the best and brightest minds in technology

85
0:03:52.125,000 --> 0:03:53,000
are working on meal-delivery start-ups

86
0:03:54.125,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and scooters

87
0:03:55.417,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and how to deliver weed to people better.

88
0:03:59.333,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Is that really the most important thing to work on right now?

89
0:04:03.792,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Silicon Valley likes to talk about making the world a better place.

90
0:04:07.917,000 --> 0:04:1,000
But you feel your impact in a much more visceral way

91
0:04:11.708,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in government.

92
0:04:14.042,000 --> 0:04:16,000
This is somebody whose dad passed away.

93
0:04:16.833,000 --> 0:04:18,000
He hunted me down on Twitter

94
0:04:18.875,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to say that a system that we had improved

95
0:04:21.917,000 --> 0:04:23,000
worked well for him during a tough time.

96
0:04:25.333,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Those tough times are when government needs to work well

97
0:04:28.458,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and why we need innovation in government.

98
0:04:31.333,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now I have a confession to make.

99
0:04:32.881,000 --> 0:04:33,000
When I came to DC,

100
0:04:34.25,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I sometimes used words like bureaucrat.

101
0:04:38.125,000 --> 0:04:39,000
These days,

102
0:04:39.417,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I'm much more likely to use words like civil servant.

103
0:04:42.625,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Like Francine, who can make you cry.

104
0:04:45.542,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Or at least, she made me cry,

105
0:04:47.458,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because she's so inspiring.

106
0:04:50.125,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I am also deeply, fiercely proud of my colleagues.

107
0:04:54.125,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They will work through illogical situations

108
0:04:57.542,000 --> 0:05:,000
and put in late nights to get to the right result.

109
0:05:01.833,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The government can't pay huge salary bonuses,

110
0:05:04.458,000 --> 0:05:07,000
so we ended up making our own awards.

111
0:05:07.75,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Our mascot is a crab named Molly.

112
0:05:10.75,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And so that award is actually a crab-shaped purse,

113
0:05:14.667,000 --> 0:05:15,000
screwed into sheet metal.

114
0:05:18.208,000 --> 0:05:2,000
These days, I believe less in silver bullets

115
0:05:21.083,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that are going to fix everything.

116
0:05:24.25,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I believe more

117
0:05:26.083,000 --> 0:05:28,000
in the people who show up to help.

118
0:05:29.333,000 --> 0:05:31,000
If you're looking for something deeply meaningful --

119
0:05:32.042,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and full disclosure, sometimes incredibly frustrating --

120
0:05:36.875,000 --> 0:05:38,000
here's what you need to know.

121
0:05:38.917,000 --> 0:05:39,000
There is something difficult

122
0:05:40.833,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and messy and vital and magical happening

123
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
when civil servants partner with technologists

124
0:05:48.917,000 --> 0:05:51,000
at the city and state and national level.

125
0:05:52.417,000 --> 0:05:54,000
You don't have to do it forever.

126
0:05:54.458,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But you can make a difference in public service

127
0:05:57.792,000 --> 0:05:58,000
right now.

128
0:05:59.417,000 --> 0:06:,000
Thank you.

129
0:06:00.708,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Applause)

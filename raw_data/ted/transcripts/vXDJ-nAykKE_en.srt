1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Thank you. I have two missions here today.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The first is to tell you something about pollen, I hope,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and to convince you that it's more than just something that gets up your nose.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And, secondly, to convince you

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that every home really ought to have a scanning electron microscope.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Pollen is a flower's way of making more flowers.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It carries male sex cells

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
from one flower to another.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This gives us genetic diversity,

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
or at least it gives the plants genetic diversity.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And it's really rather better not to mate with yourself.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
That's probably true of humans as well, mostly.

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Pollen is produced by the anthers of flowers.

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Each anther can carry up to 100,000 grains of pollen,

16
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
so, it's quite prolific stuff.

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And it isn't just bright flowers

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that have pollen; it's also trees and grasses.

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And remember that all our cereal crops are grasses as well.

20
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Here is a scanning electron micrograph of a grain of pollen.

21
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The little hole in the middle, we'll come to a bit later,

22
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but that's for the pollen tube

23
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
to come out later on. A very tiny tube.

24
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So, that's 20 micrometers across,

25
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that pollen grain there.

26
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
That's about a 50th of a millimeter.

27
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But not all pollen is quite so simple looking.

28
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This is Morina. This is a plant --

29
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which I've always thought to be rather tedious --

30
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
named after Morin,

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
who was an enterprising French gardener,

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
who issued the first seed catalog

33
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in 1621.

34
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But anyway, take a look at its pollen.

35
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
This is amazing, I think.

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
That little hole in the middle there is for the pollen tube,

37
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and when the pollen finds its special female spot

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in another Morina flower,

39
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
just on the right species, what happens?

40
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Like I said, pollen carries the male sex cells.

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
If you actually didn't realize that plants have sex,

42
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
they have rampant, promiscuous

43
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and really quite interesting and curious sex. Really.

44
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Laughter) A lot.

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
My story is actually not about plant propagation,

46
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but about pollen itself.

47
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
"So, what are pollen's properties?" I hear you ask.

48
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
First of all, pollen is tiny. Yes we know that.

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It's also very biologically active,

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
as anyone with hay fever will understand.

51
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now, pollen from plants, which are wind-dispersed --

52
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
like trees and grasses and so on --

53
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
tend to cause the most hay fever.

54
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And the reason for that is they've got to chuck out

55
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
masses and masses of pollen to have any chance

56
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
of the pollen reaching another plant of the same species.

57
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Here are some examples --

58
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
they're very smooth if you look at them --

59
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of tree pollen that is meant to be carried by the wind.

60
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Again -- this time, sycamore -- wind-dispersed.

61
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So, trees: very boring flowers,

62
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
not really trying to attract insects.

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Cool pollen, though.

64
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This one I particularly like.

65
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
This is the Monterey Pine, which has little air sacks

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to make the pollen carry even further.

67
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Remember, that thing is just about 30 micrometers across.

68
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Now, it's much more efficient if you can get insects to do your bidding.

69
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This is a bee's leg

70
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
with the pollen glommed onto it from a mallow plant.

71
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And this is the outrageous and beautiful

72
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
flower of the mangrove palm.

73
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Very showy, to attract lots of insects to do its bidding.

74
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The pollen has little barbs on it,

75
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
if we look.

76
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now, those little barbs

77
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
obviously stick to the insects well,

78
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but there is something else that we can tell from this photograph,

79
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and that is that you might be able to see a fracture line

80
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
across what would be the equator of this, if it was the Earth.

81
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
That tells me that it's actually been fossilized, this pollen.

82
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And I'm rather proud to say

83
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that this was found just near London, and that 55 million years ago

84
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
London was full of mangroves.

85
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Isn't that cool?

86
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Okay, so this is another species evolved to be dispersed by insects.

88
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You can tell that from the little barbs on there.

89
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
All these pictures were taken with a scanning electron microscope,

90
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
actually in the lab at Kew Laboratories.

91
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
No coincidence that these were taken

92
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
by Rob Kesseler, who is an artist,

93
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and I think it's someone with a design and artistic eye

94
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
like him that has managed to bring out the best in pollen.

95
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Now, all this diversity

97
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
means that you can look at a pollen grain

98
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and tell what species it came from,

99
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and that's actually quite handy if you

100
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
maybe have a sample and you want to see where it came from.

101
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So, different species of plants

102
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
grow in different places,

103
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and some pollen carries further than others.

104
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So, if you have a pollen sample,

105
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
then in principle, you should be able to tell

106
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
where that sample came from.

107
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And this is where it gets interesting for forensics.

108
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Pollen is tiny. It gets on to things, and it sticks to them.

109
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So, not only does each type of pollen look different,

110
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
but each habitat has a different combination of plants.

111
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
A different pollen signature, if you like,

112
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
or a different pollen fingerprint.

113
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
By looking at the proportions and combinations

114
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
of different kinds of pollen in a sample,

115
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
you can tell very precisely where it came from.

116
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
This is some pollen embedded in a cotton shirt,

117
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
similar to the one that I'm wearing now.

118
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now, much of the pollen will still be there

119
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
after repeated washings.

120
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Where has it been?

121
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Four very different habitats might look similar,

122
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but they've got very different pollen signatures.

123
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Actually this one is particularly easy, these pictures were all taken

124
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in different countries.

125
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But pollen forensics can be very subtle.

126
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It's being used now to track

127
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
where counterfeit drugs have been made,

128
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
where banknotes have come from,

129
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to look at the provenance of antiques

130
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and see that they really did come from the place

131
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the seller said they did.

132
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And murder suspects have been tracked

133
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
using their clothing,

134
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
certainly in the U.K., to within an area

135
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that's small enough that you can send in tracker dogs

136
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to find the murder victim.

137
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So, you can tell from a piece of clothing

138
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
to within about a kilometer or so,

139
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
where that piece of clothing has been recently

140
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and then send in dogs.

141
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And finally, in a rather grizzly way,

142
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
the Bosnia war crimes;

143
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
some of the people brought to trial were brought to trial

144
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
because of the evidence from pollen,

145
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
which showed that bodies had been buried,

146
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
exhumed and then reburied somewhere else.

147
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
I hope I've opened your eyes,

148
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
if you'll excuse the visual pun, (Laughter)

149
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to some of pollen's secrets.

150
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
This is a horse chestnut.

151
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
There is an invisible beauty all around us,

152
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
each grain with a story to tell ...

153
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
each of us, in fact, with a story to tell

154
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
from the pollen fingerprint that's upon us.

155
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Thank you to the colleagues at Kew,

156
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and thank you to palynologists everywhere.

157
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.054,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Hi. So I'd like to talk a little bit about the people

3
0:00:18.47,000 --> 0:00:2,000
who make the things we use every day:

4
0:00:20.999,000 --> 0:00:23,000
our shoes, our handbags, our computers and cell phones.

5
0:00:24.759,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Now, this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt.

6
0:00:29.205,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than

7
0:00:32.796,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes,

8
0:00:35.652,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop

9
0:00:38.35,000 --> 0:00:42,000
after working overtime assembling your iPad.

10
0:00:42.39,000 --> 0:00:45,000
We, the beneficiaries of globalization, seem to exploit

11
0:00:45.998,000 --> 0:00:47,000
these victims with every purchase we make,

12
0:00:48.701,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and the injustice

13
0:00:50.334,000 --> 0:00:53,000
feels embedded in the products themselves.

14
0:00:53.423,000 --> 0:00:55,000
After all, what's wrong with a world in which a worker

15
0:00:55.983,000 --> 0:00:58,000
on an iPhone assembly line can't even afford to buy one?

16
0:00:59.759,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive,

17
0:01:02.409,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and that it's our desire for cheap goods

18
0:01:05.14,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that makes them so.

19
0:01:07.501,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So, this simple narrative equating Western demand

20
0:01:11.316,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and Chinese suffering is appealing,

21
0:01:14.128,000 --> 0:01:16,000
especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty

22
0:01:16.763,000 --> 0:01:18,000
about our impact on the world,

23
0:01:19.341,000 --> 0:01:22,000
but it's also inaccurate and disrespectful.

24
0:01:23.124,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we

25
0:01:26.108,000 --> 0:01:29,000
have the power to drive tens of millions of people

26
0:01:29.276,000 --> 0:01:31,000
on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer

27
0:01:31.988,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in such terrible ways.

28
0:01:34.783,000 --> 0:01:36,000
In fact, China makes goods for markets all over the world,

29
0:01:37.601,000 --> 0:01:4,000
including its own, thanks to a combination of factors:

30
0:01:41.189,000 --> 0:01:44,000
its low costs, its large and educated workforce,

31
0:01:44.595,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and a flexible manufacturing system

32
0:01:47.061,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that responds quickly to market demands.

33
0:01:50.212,000 --> 0:01:53,000
By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets,

34
0:01:53.261,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we have rendered the individuals on the other end

35
0:01:55.724,000 --> 0:01:58,000
into invisibility, as tiny and interchangeable

36
0:01:59.084,000 --> 0:02:02,000
as the parts of a mobile phone.

37
0:02:02.139,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Chinese workers are not forced into factories

38
0:02:04.804,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because of our insatiable desire for iPods.

39
0:02:07.283,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money,

40
0:02:10.355,000 --> 0:02:13,000
to learn new skills, and to see the world.

41
0:02:14.308,000 --> 0:02:16,000
In the ongoing debate about globalization, what's

42
0:02:16.701,000 --> 0:02:19,000
been missing is the voices of the workers themselves.

43
0:02:20.132,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Here are a few.

44
0:02:22.437,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Bao Yongxiu: "My mother tells me to come home

45
0:02:26.186,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and get married, but if I marry now, before I have fully

46
0:02:29.91,000 --> 0:02:33,000
developed myself, I can only marry an ordinary worker,

47
0:02:33.995,000 --> 0:02:35,000
so I'm not in a rush."

48
0:02:36.498,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Chen Ying: "When I went home for the new year,

49
0:02:39.54,000 --> 0:02:42,000
everyone said I had changed. They asked me,

50
0:02:42.796,000 --> 0:02:45,000
what did you do that you have changed so much?

51
0:02:45.893,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I told them that I studied and worked hard. If you tell them

52
0:02:49.171,000 --> 0:02:52,000
more, they won't understand anyway."

53
0:02:52.539,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Wu Chunming: "Even if I make a lot of money,

54
0:02:55.924,000 --> 0:02:57,000
it won't satisfy me.

55
0:02:58.075,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Just to make money is not enough meaning in life."

56
0:03:02.444,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Xiao Jin: "Now, after I get off work, I study English,

57
0:03:07.156,000 --> 0:03:08,000
because in the future, our customers won't

58
0:03:08.945,000 --> 0:03:11,000
be only Chinese, so we must learn more languages."

59
0:03:12.807,000 --> 0:03:14,000
All of these speakers, by the way, are young women,

60
0:03:15.578,000 --> 0:03:18,000
18 or 19 years old.

61
0:03:18.66,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers

62
0:03:21.602,000 --> 0:03:24,000
like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan.

63
0:03:25.531,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Certain subjects came up over and over:

64
0:03:28.051,000 --> 0:03:29,000
how much money they made,

65
0:03:29.955,000 --> 0:03:31,000
what kind of husband they hoped to marry,

66
0:03:32.334,000 --> 0:03:34,000
whether they should jump to another factory

67
0:03:34.459,000 --> 0:03:36,000
or stay where they were.

68
0:03:36.659,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Other subjects came up almost never, including

69
0:03:38.852,000 --> 0:03:41,000
living conditions that to me looked close to prison life:

70
0:03:42.299,000 --> 0:03:44,000
10 or 15 workers in one room,

71
0:03:44.582,000 --> 0:03:47,000
50 people sharing a single bathroom,

72
0:03:47.941,000 --> 0:03:5,000
days and nights ruled by the factory clock.

73
0:03:51.275,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances,

74
0:03:54.763,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and it was still better than the dormitories and homes

75
0:03:57.524,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of rural China.

76
0:04:00.092,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The workers rarely spoke about the products they made,

77
0:04:02.818,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and they often had great difficulty explaining

78
0:04:05.162,000 --> 0:04:07,000
what exactly they did.

79
0:04:07.604,000 --> 0:04:08,000
When I asked Lu Qingmin,

80
0:04:09.315,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the young woman I got to know best,

81
0:04:11.417,000 --> 0:04:13,000
what exactly she did on the factory floor,

82
0:04:13.884,000 --> 0:04:15,000
she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like

83
0:04:16.289,000 --> 0:04:17,000
"qiu xi."

84
0:04:18.066,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Only much later did I realize that she had been saying

85
0:04:21.035,000 --> 0:04:24,000
"QC," or quality control.

86
0:04:24.259,000 --> 0:04:27,000
She couldn't even tell me what she did on the factory floor.

87
0:04:28.122,000 --> 0:04:3,000
All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation

88
0:04:30.579,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in a language she didn't even understand.

89
0:04:34.573,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism,

90
0:04:38.195,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor.

91
0:04:42.238,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Unlike, say, a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets,

92
0:04:45.862,000 --> 0:04:48,000
the worker in an industrial factory has no control,

93
0:04:49.109,000 --> 0:04:52,000
no pleasure, and no true satisfaction or understanding

94
0:04:52.366,000 --> 0:04:54,000
in her own work.

95
0:04:54.557,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But like so many theories that Marx arrived at

96
0:04:56.973,000 --> 0:04:58,000
sitting in the reading room of the British Museum,

97
0:04:59.792,000 --> 0:05:01,000
he got this one wrong.

98
0:05:02.618,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Just because a person spends her time

99
0:05:04.917,000 --> 0:05:06,000
making a piece of something does not mean

100
0:05:07.685,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that she becomes that, a piece of something.

101
0:05:10.237,000 --> 0:05:13,000
What she does with the money she earns,

102
0:05:13.34,000 --> 0:05:16,000
what she learns in that place, and how it changes her,

103
0:05:16.845,000 --> 0:05:18,000
these are the things that matter.

104
0:05:19.606,000 --> 0:05:21,000
What a factory makes is never the point, and

105
0:05:21.906,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the workers could not care less who buys their products.

106
0:05:25.99,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories,

107
0:05:28.478,000 --> 0:05:3,000
on the other hand, plays up this relationship

108
0:05:30.59,000 --> 0:05:32,000
between the workers and the products they make.

109
0:05:33.419,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Many articles calculate: How long would it take

110
0:05:36.508,000 --> 0:05:38,000
for this worker to work in order to earn enough money

111
0:05:39.352,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to buy what he's making?

112
0:05:41.812,000 --> 0:05:43,000
For example, an entry-level-line assembly line worker

113
0:05:44.3,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out

114
0:05:47.572,000 --> 0:05:5,000
two and a half months' wages for an iPhone.

115
0:05:51.117,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But how meaningful is this calculation, really?

116
0:05:54.454,000 --> 0:05:55,000
For example, I recently wrote an article

117
0:05:56.444,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in The New Yorker magazine,

118
0:05:57.422,000 --> 0:06:,000
but I can't afford to buy an ad in it.

119
0:06:00.661,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But, who cares? I don't want an ad in The New Yorker,

120
0:06:02.717,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and most of these workers don't really want iPhones.

121
0:06:05.582,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Their calculations are different.

122
0:06:08.342,000 --> 0:06:09,000
How long should I stay in this factory?

123
0:06:10.156,000 --> 0:06:12,000
How much money can I save?

124
0:06:12.619,000 --> 0:06:14,000
How much will it take to buy an apartment or a car,

125
0:06:15.189,000 --> 0:06:19,000
to get married, or to put my child through school?

126
0:06:19.779,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract

127
0:06:22.47,000 --> 0:06:25,000
relationship with the product of their labor.

128
0:06:26.228,000 --> 0:06:29,000
About a year after I met Lu Qingmin, or Min,

129
0:06:29.37,000 --> 0:06:31,000
she invited me home to her family village

130
0:06:31.404,000 --> 0:06:33,000
for the Chinese New Year.

131
0:06:33.627,000 --> 0:06:35,000
On the train home, she gave me a present:

132
0:06:36.013,000 --> 0:06:4,000
a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim.

133
0:06:40.404,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I thanked her, assuming it was fake,

134
0:06:42.077,000 --> 0:06:45,000
like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan.

135
0:06:45.554,000 --> 0:06:48,000
After we got home, Min gave her mother another present:

136
0:06:49.363,000 --> 0:06:51,000
a pink Dooney & Bourke handbag,

137
0:06:51.548,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and a few nights later, her sister was showing off

138
0:06:53.971,000 --> 0:06:56,000
a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag.

139
0:06:57.475,000 --> 0:07:,000
Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags

140
0:07:01.275,000 --> 0:07:03,000
were made by their factory,

141
0:07:03.292,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and every single one of them was authentic.

142
0:07:06.458,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Min's sister said to her parents,

143
0:07:08.923,000 --> 0:07:11,000
"In America, this bag sells for 320 dollars."

144
0:07:12.285,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Her parents, who are both farmers, looked on, speechless.

145
0:07:15.324,000 --> 0:07:17,000
"And that's not all -- Coach is coming out with a new line,

146
0:07:17.883,000 --> 0:07:21,000
2191," she said. "One bag will sell for 6,000."

147
0:07:22.684,000 --> 0:07:26,000
She paused and said, "I don't know if that's 6,000 yuan or

148
0:07:26.931,000 --> 0:07:31,000
6,000 American dollars, but anyway, it's 6,000." (Laughter)

149
0:07:32.578,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Min's sister's boyfriend, who had traveled home with her

150
0:07:35.173,000 --> 0:07:37,000
for the new year, said,

151
0:07:37.29,000 --> 0:07:39,000
"It doesn't look like it's worth that much."

152
0:07:40.123,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Min's sister turned to him and said, "Some people actually

153
0:07:42.948,000 --> 0:07:45,000
understand these things. You don't understand shit."

154
0:07:46.492,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

155
0:07:51.147,000 --> 0:07:55,000
In Min's world, the Coach bags had a curious currency.

156
0:07:55.187,000 --> 0:07:57,000
They weren't exactly worthless, but they were nothing

157
0:07:57.507,000 --> 0:07:59,000
close to the actual value, because almost no one they knew

158
0:08:00.217,000 --> 0:08:03,000
wanted to buy one, or knew how much it was worth.

159
0:08:04.147,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Once, when Min's older sister's friend got married,

160
0:08:07.502,000 --> 0:08:09,000
she brought a handbag along as a wedding present.

161
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Another time, after Min had already left

162
0:08:12.498,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the handbag factory, her younger sister came to visit,

163
0:08:15.64,000 --> 0:08:19,000
bringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts.

164
0:08:19.751,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I looked in the zippered pocket of one,

165
0:08:21.826,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and I found a printed card in English, which read,

166
0:08:26.065,000 --> 0:08:29,000
"An American classic.

167
0:08:29.323,000 --> 0:08:31,000
In 1941, the burnished patina

168
0:08:31.833,000 --> 0:08:33,000
of an all-American baseball glove

169
0:08:34.195,000 --> 0:08:36,000
inspired the founder of Coach to create

170
0:08:36.395,000 --> 0:08:38,000
a new collection of handbags from the same

171
0:08:38.804,000 --> 0:08:41,000
luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather.

172
0:08:42.013,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags

173
0:08:46.188,000 --> 0:08:5,000
with perfect proportions and a timeless flair.

174
0:08:50.324,000 --> 0:08:52,000
They were fresh, functional, and women everywhere

175
0:08:52.604,000 --> 0:08:57,000
adored them. A new American classic was born."

176
0:08:57.94,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min

177
0:09:00.266,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and her sisters.

178
0:09:02.174,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Their relationship with the product of their labor

179
0:09:04.781,000 --> 0:09:06,000
was more complicated, surprising and funny

180
0:09:07.076,000 --> 0:09:09,000
than he could have imagined.

181
0:09:09.334,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And yet, his view of the world persists, and our tendency

182
0:09:12.157,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to see the workers as faceless masses,

183
0:09:14.766,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to imagine that we can know what they're really thinking.

184
0:09:18.64,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The first time I met Min, she had just turned 18

185
0:09:22.041,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and quit her first job on the assembly line

186
0:09:24.696,000 --> 0:09:26,000
of an electronics factory.

187
0:09:27.011,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Over the next two years, I watched as she switched jobs

188
0:09:29.657,000 --> 0:09:32,000
five times, eventually landing a lucrative post

189
0:09:32.733,000 --> 0:09:35,000
in the purchasing department of a hardware factory.

190
0:09:36.307,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Later, she married a fellow migrant worker,

191
0:09:38.832,000 --> 0:09:4,000
moved with him to his village,

192
0:09:40.974,000 --> 0:09:42,000
gave birth to two daughters,

193
0:09:43.177,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick

194
0:09:45.365,000 --> 0:09:49,000
for herself and an apartment for her parents.

195
0:09:49.771,000 --> 0:09:52,000
She recently returned to Dongguan on her own

196
0:09:52.904,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes,

197
0:09:56.52,000 --> 0:09:58,000
temporarily leaving her husband and children

198
0:09:58.72,000 --> 0:09:59,000
back in the village.

199
0:10:00.703,000 --> 0:10:02,000
In a recent email to me, she explained,

200
0:10:03.284,000 --> 0:10:07,000
"A person should have some ambition while she is young

201
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
so that in old age she can look back on her life

202
0:10:09.992,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and feel that it was not lived to no purpose."

203
0:10:14.775,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Across China, there are 150 million workers like her,

204
0:10:19.171,000 --> 0:10:21,000
one third of them women, who have left their villages

205
0:10:21.924,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to work in the factories, the hotels, the restaurants

206
0:10:25.467,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and the construction sites of the big cities.

207
0:10:28.072,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Together, they make up the largest migration in history,

208
0:10:31.816,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and it is globalization, this chain that begins

209
0:10:34.816,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in a Chinese farming village

210
0:10:37.335,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet

211
0:10:41.112,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and Coach handbags on our arms

212
0:10:43.536,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that has changed the way these millions of people

213
0:10:45.825,000 --> 0:10:49,000
work and marry and live and think.

214
0:10:50.738,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Very few of them would want to go back

215
0:10:52.687,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to the way things used to be.

216
0:10:55.244,000 --> 0:10:58,000
When I first went to Dongguan, I worried that

217
0:10:58.424,000 --> 0:11:02,000
it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers.

218
0:11:02.799,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I also worried that nothing would ever happen to them,

219
0:11:05.57,000 --> 0:11:07,000
or that they would have nothing to say to me.

220
0:11:08.199,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Instead, I found young women who were smart and funny

221
0:11:10.849,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and brave and generous.

222
0:11:13.696,000 --> 0:11:15,000
By opening up their lives to me,

223
0:11:16.027,000 --> 0:11:18,000
they taught me so much about factories

224
0:11:18.233,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and about China and about how to live in the world.

225
0:11:24.746,000 --> 0:11:26,000
This is the Coach purse that Min gave me

226
0:11:27.458,000 --> 0:11:29,000
on the train home to visit her family.

227
0:11:29.868,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me

228
0:11:32.511,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to the young women I wrote about,

229
0:11:35.235,000 --> 0:11:39,000
ties that are not economic but personal in nature,

230
0:11:39.505,000 --> 0:11:42,000
measured not in money but in memories.

231
0:11:43.072,000 --> 0:11:46,000
This purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine,

232
0:11:46.491,000 --> 0:11:49,000
sitting in your office or in the library,

233
0:11:50.033,000 --> 0:11:52,000
are not how you find them when you actually go out

234
0:11:52.436,000 --> 0:11:53,000
into the world.

235
0:11:53.943,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Thank you. (Applause)

236
0:11:55.931,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Applause)

237
0:12:02.603,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you, Leslie, that was an insight

238
0:12:04.672,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that a lot of us haven't had before.

239
0:12:07.269,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But I'm curious. If you had a minute, say,

240
0:12:10.756,000 --> 0:12:13,000
with Apple's head of manufacturing,

241
0:12:14.477,000 --> 0:12:16,000
what would you say?

242
0:12:16.837,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Leslie Chang: One minute?

243
0:12:17.965,000 --> 0:12:18,000
CA: One minute. (Laughter)

244
0:12:19.478,000 --> 0:12:2,000
LC: You know, what really impressed me about the workers

245
0:12:21.404,000 --> 0:12:24,000
is how much they're self-motivated, self-driven,

246
0:12:24.63,000 --> 0:12:26,000
resourceful, and the thing that struck me,

247
0:12:27.247,000 --> 0:12:29,000
what they want most is education, to learn,

248
0:12:30.212,000 --> 0:12:31,000
because most of them come from very poor backgrounds.

249
0:12:31.759,000 --> 0:12:33,000
They usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade.

250
0:12:34.703,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Their parents are often illiterate,

251
0:12:36.942,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and then they come to the city, and they, on their own,

252
0:12:39.582,000 --> 0:12:41,000
at night, during the weekends, they'll take a computer class,

253
0:12:41.707,000 --> 0:12:43,000
they'll take an English class, and learn

254
0:12:43.975,000 --> 0:12:45,000
really, really rudimentary things, you know,

255
0:12:46.099,000 --> 0:12:47,000
like how to type a document in Word,

256
0:12:47.838,000 --> 0:12:49,000
or how to say really simple things in English.

257
0:12:50.502,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So, if you really want to help these workers,

258
0:12:52.63,000 --> 0:12:55,000
start these small, very focused, very pragmatic classes

259
0:12:55.853,000 --> 0:12:58,000
in these schools, and what's going to happen is,

260
0:12:58.982,000 --> 0:12:59,000
all your workers are going to move on,

261
0:13:00.401,000 --> 0:13:03,000
but hopefully they'll move on into higher jobs within Apple,

262
0:13:03.808,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and you can help their social mobility

263
0:13:06.749,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and their self-improvement.

264
0:13:07.746,000 --> 0:13:08,000
When you talk to workers, that's what they want.

265
0:13:09.524,000 --> 0:13:11,000
They do not say, "I want better hot water in the showers.

266
0:13:12.198,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I want a nicer room. I want a TV set."

267
0:13:14.183,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I mean, it would be nice to have those things,

268
0:13:15.806,000 --> 0:13:16,000
but that's not why they're in the city,

269
0:13:16.964,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and that's not what they care about.

270
0:13:19.053,000 --> 0:13:22,000
CA: Was there a sense from them of a narrative that

271
0:13:22.603,000 --> 0:13:25,000
things were kind of tough and bad, or was there a narrative

272
0:13:26.015,000 --> 0:13:29,000
of some kind of level of growth, that things over time

273
0:13:29.028,000 --> 0:13:3,000
were getting better?

274
0:13:30.651,000 --> 0:13:31,000
LC: Oh definitely, definitely. I mean, you know,

275
0:13:32.558,000 --> 0:13:34,000
it was interesting, because I spent basically two years

276
0:13:34.924,000 --> 0:13:35,000
hanging out in this city, Dongguan,

277
0:13:36.918,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and over that time, you could see immense change

278
0:13:39.029,000 --> 0:13:41,000
in every person's life: upward, downward, sideways,

279
0:13:41.824,000 --> 0:13:42,000
but generally upward.

280
0:13:43.645,000 --> 0:13:44,000
If you spend enough time, it's upward, and I met people

281
0:13:45.432,000 --> 0:13:47,000
who had moved to the city 10 years ago, and who are now

282
0:13:47.727,000 --> 0:13:49,000
basically urban middle class people,

283
0:13:49.834,000 --> 0:13:51,000
so the trajectory is definitely upward.

284
0:13:51.855,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It's just hard to see when you're suddenly

285
0:13:53.79,000 --> 0:13:55,000
sucked into the city. It looks like everyone's poor and

286
0:13:55.911,000 --> 0:13:56,000
desperate, but that's not really how it is.

287
0:13:57.649,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Certainly, the factory conditions are really tough,

288
0:13:59.803,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and it's nothing you or I would want to do,

289
0:14:02.12,000 --> 0:14:05,000
but from their perspective, where they're coming from

290
0:14:05.265,000 --> 0:14:06,000
is much worse, and where they're going

291
0:14:07.262,000 --> 0:14:09,000
is hopefully much better, and I just wanted to give

292
0:14:09.27,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that context of what's going on in their minds,

293
0:14:11.631,000 --> 0:14:13,000
not what necessarily is going on in yours.

294
0:14:13.994,000 --> 0:14:14,000
CA: Thanks so much for your talk.

295
0:14:15.49,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

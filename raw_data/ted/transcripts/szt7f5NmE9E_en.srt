0:00:12.708,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Chris Anderson: Hello. Welcome to this TED Dialogues.

2
0:00:16.486,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's the first of a series that's going to be done

3
0:00:20.097,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in response to the current political upheaval.

4
0:00:24.085,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I don't know about you;

5
0:00:25.278,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I've become quite concerned about the growing divisiveness in this country

6
0:00:28.913,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and in the world.

7
0:00:30.433,000 --> 0:00:32,000
No one's listening to each other. Right?

8
0:00:33.384,000 --> 0:00:34,000
They aren't.

9
0:00:34.571,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I mean, it feels like we need a different kind of conversation,

10
0:00:38.331,000 --> 0:00:43,000
one that's based on -- I don't know, on reason, listening, on understanding,

11
0:00:44.283,000 --> 0:00:45,000
on a broader context.

12
0:00:46.66,000 --> 0:00:49,000
That's at least what we're going to try in these TED Dialogues,

13
0:00:49.711,000 --> 0:00:5,000
starting today.

14
0:00:50.927,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And we couldn't have anyone with us

15
0:00:53.577,000 --> 0:00:55,000
who I'd be more excited to kick this off.

16
0:00:56.41,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This is a mind right here that thinks pretty much like no one else

17
0:01:00.284,000 --> 0:01:01,000
on the planet, I would hasten to say.

18
0:01:02.079,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I'm serious.

19
0:01:03.262,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Yuval Noah Harari laughs)

20
0:01:04.548,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I'm serious.

21
0:01:05.736,000 --> 0:01:09,000
He synthesizes history with underlying ideas

22
0:01:10.698,000 --> 0:01:12,000
in a way that kind of takes your breath away.

23
0:01:12.892,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So, some of you will know this book, "Sapiens."

24
0:01:16.325,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Has anyone here read "Sapiens"?

25
0:01:18.092,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Applause)

26
0:01:19.328,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I mean, I could not put it down.

27
0:01:22.497,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The way that he tells the story of mankind

28
0:01:26.395,000 --> 0:01:29,000
through big ideas that really make you think differently --

29
0:01:30.221,000 --> 0:01:31,000
it's kind of amazing.

30
0:01:31.98,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And here's the follow-up,

31
0:01:33.228,000 --> 0:01:36,000
which I think is being published in the US next week.

32
0:01:36.328,000 --> 0:01:37,000
YNH: Yeah, next week.

33
0:01:37.503,000 --> 0:01:38,000
CA: "Homo Deus."

34
0:01:38.701,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, this is the history of the next hundred years.

35
0:01:42.341,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I've had a chance to read it.

36
0:01:44.215,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It's extremely dramatic,

37
0:01:46.629,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and I daresay, for some people, quite alarming.

38
0:01:51.425,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It's a must-read.

39
0:01:52.692,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And honestly, we couldn't have someone better to help

40
0:01:58.294,000 --> 0:02:01,000
make sense of what on Earth is happening in the world right now.

41
0:02:02.294,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So a warm welcome, please, to Yuval Noah Harari.

42
0:02:06.475,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Applause)

43
0:02:14.72,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It's great to be joined by our friends on Facebook and around the Web.

44
0:02:18.489,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Hello, Facebook.

45
0:02:20.09,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And all of you, as I start asking questions of Yuval,

46
0:02:24.04,000 --> 0:02:25,000
come up with your own questions,

47
0:02:25.716,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and not necessarily about the political scandal du jour,

48
0:02:28.387,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but about the broader understanding of: Where are we heading?

49
0:02:34.337,000 --> 0:02:35,000
You ready? OK, we're going to go.

50
0:02:36.127,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So here we are, Yuval:

51
0:02:37.426,000 --> 0:02:4,000
New York City, 2017, there's a new president in power,

52
0:02:41.17,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and shock waves rippling around the world.

53
0:02:44.315,000 --> 0:02:45,000
What on Earth is happening?

54
0:02:46.935,000 --> 0:02:48,000
YNH: I think the basic thing that happened

55
0:02:49.205,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is that we have lost our story.

56
0:02:51.964,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Humans think in stories,

57
0:02:54.455,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and we try to make sense of the world by telling stories.

58
0:02:58.141,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And for the last few decades,

59
0:02:59.582,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we had a very simple and very attractive story

60
0:03:02.476,000 --> 0:03:03,000
about what's happening in the world.

61
0:03:04.249,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And the story said that, oh, what's happening is

62
0:03:07.437,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that the economy is being globalized,

63
0:03:10.077,000 --> 0:03:12,000
politics is being liberalized,

64
0:03:12.244,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and the combination of the two will create paradise on Earth,

65
0:03:16.267,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and we just need to keep on globalizing the economy

66
0:03:19.39,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and liberalizing the political system,

67
0:03:21.225,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and everything will be wonderful.

68
0:03:23.154,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And 2016 is the moment

69
0:03:25.91,000 --> 0:03:28,000
when a very large segment, even of the Western world,

70
0:03:29.894,000 --> 0:03:31,000
stopped believing in this story.

71
0:03:32.324,000 --> 0:03:34,000
For good or bad reasons -- it doesn't matter.

72
0:03:34.48,000 --> 0:03:36,000
People stopped believing in the story,

73
0:03:36.725,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and when you don't have a story, you don't understand what's happening.

74
0:03:41.032,000 --> 0:03:44,000
CA: Part of you believes that that story was actually a very effective story.

75
0:03:45.023,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It worked.

76
0:03:46.241,000 --> 0:03:47,000
YNH: To some extent, yes.

77
0:03:47.742,000 --> 0:03:49,000
According to some measurements,

78
0:03:49.828,000 --> 0:03:51,000
we are now in the best time ever

79
0:03:52.437,000 --> 0:03:53,000
for humankind.

80
0:03:53.888,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Today, for the first time in history,

81
0:03:56.352,000 --> 0:04:,000
more people die from eating too much than from eating too little,

82
0:04:00.789,000 --> 0:04:01,000
which is an amazing achievement.

83
0:04:02.585,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:05.292,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Also for the first time in history,

85
0:04:07.017,000 --> 0:04:11,000
more people die from old age than from infectious diseases,

86
0:04:11.176,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and violence is also down.

87
0:04:13.994,000 --> 0:04:14,000
For the first time in history,

88
0:04:15.448,000 --> 0:04:2,000
more people commit suicide than are killed by crime and terrorism

89
0:04:20.803,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and war put together.

90
0:04:22.667,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Statistically, you are your own worst enemy.

91
0:04:26.851,000 --> 0:04:28,000
At least, of all the people in the world,

92
0:04:28.881,000 --> 0:04:31,000
you are most likely to be killed by yourself --

93
0:04:32.027,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:33.318,000 --> 0:04:36,000
which is, again, very good news, compared --

95
0:04:36.386,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:38.034,000 --> 0:04:42,000
compared to the level of violence that we saw in previous eras.

97
0:04:42.359,000 --> 0:04:44,000
CA: But this process of connecting the world

98
0:04:44.619,000 --> 0:04:47,000
ended up with a large group of people kind of feeling left out,

99
0:04:48.542,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and they've reacted.

100
0:04:50.197,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And so we have this bombshell

101
0:04:52.207,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that's sort of ripping through the whole system.

102
0:04:54.542,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I mean, what do you make of what's happened?

103
0:04:57.958,000 --> 0:05:,000
It feels like the old way that people thought of politics,

104
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the left-right divide, has been blown up and replaced.

105
0:05:04.14,000 --> 0:05:05,000
How should we think of this?

106
0:05:05.761,000 --> 0:05:09,000
YNH: Yeah, the old 20th-century political model of left versus right

107
0:05:10.169,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is now largely irrelevant,

108
0:05:11.9,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and the real divide today is between global and national,

109
0:05:16.426,000 --> 0:05:17,000
global or local.

110
0:05:18.239,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And you see it again all over the world

111
0:05:21.12,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that this is now the main struggle.

112
0:05:23.289,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We probably need completely new political models

113
0:05:26.749,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and completely new ways of thinking about politics.

114
0:05:32.319,000 --> 0:05:37,000
In essence, what you can say is that we now have global ecology,

115
0:05:37.873,000 --> 0:05:4,000
we have a global economy but we have national politics,

116
0:05:41.838,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and this doesn't work together.

117
0:05:43.599,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This makes the political system ineffective,

118
0:05:45.849,000 --> 0:05:48,000
because it has no control over the forces that shape our life.

119
0:05:49.397,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And you have basically two solutions to this imbalance:

120
0:05:52.7,000 --> 0:05:56,000
either de-globalize the economy and turn it back into a national economy,

121
0:05:57.298,000 --> 0:05:59,000
or globalize the political system.

122
0:06:00.768,000 --> 0:06:04,000
CA: So some, I guess many liberals out there

123
0:06:05.457,000 --> 0:06:11,000
view Trump and his government as kind of irredeemably bad,

124
0:06:11.917,000 --> 0:06:13,000
just awful in every way.

125
0:06:14.6,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Do you see any underlying narrative or political philosophy in there

126
0:06:21.047,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that is at least worth understanding?

127
0:06:22.875,000 --> 0:06:24,000
How would you articulate that philosophy?

128
0:06:24.944,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Is it just the philosophy of nationalism?

129
0:06:28.074,000 --> 0:06:33,000
YNH: I think the underlying feeling or idea

130
0:06:33.498,000 --> 0:06:37,000
is that the political system -- something is broken there.

131
0:06:38.014,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It doesn't empower the ordinary person anymore.

132
0:06:41.808,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It doesn't care so much about the ordinary person anymore,

133
0:06:45.332,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and I think this diagnosis of the political disease is correct.

134
0:06:50.175,000 --> 0:06:53,000
With regard to the answers, I am far less certain.

135
0:06:53.558,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I think what we are seeing is the immediate human reaction:

136
0:06:57.065,000 --> 0:06:59,000
if something doesn't work, let's go back.

137
0:06:59.647,000 --> 0:07:,000
And you see it all over the world,

138
0:07:01.292,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that people, almost nobody in the political system today,

139
0:07:05.742,000 --> 0:07:09,000
has any future-oriented vision of where humankind is going.

140
0:07:09.959,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Almost everywhere, you see retrograde vision:

141
0:07:13.009,000 --> 0:07:15,000
"Let's make America great again,"

142
0:07:15.079,000 --> 0:07:18,000
like it was great -- I don't know -- in the '50s, in the '80s, sometime,

143
0:07:18.532,000 --> 0:07:19,000
let's go back there.

144
0:07:19.726,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And you go to Russia a hundred years after Lenin,

145
0:07:24.471,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Putin's vision for the future

146
0:07:26.366,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is basically, ah, let's go back to the Tsarist empire.

147
0:07:29.587,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And in Israel, where I come from,

148
0:07:32.003,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the hottest political vision of the present is:

149
0:07:35.279,000 --> 0:07:36,000
"Let's build the temple again."

150
0:07:37.154,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So let's go back 2,000 years backwards.

151
0:07:40.156,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So people are thinking sometime in the past we've lost it,

152
0:07:45.006,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and sometimes in the past, it's like you've lost your way in the city,

153
0:07:48.768,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and you say OK, let's go back to the point where I felt secure

154
0:07:51.942,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and start again.

155
0:07:53.328,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I don't think this can work,

156
0:07:54.925,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but a lot of people, this is their gut instinct.

157
0:07:57.851,000 --> 0:07:58,000
CA: But why couldn't it work?

158
0:07:59.527,000 --> 0:08:02,000
"America First" is a very appealing slogan in many ways.

159
0:08:03.19,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Patriotism is, in many ways, a very noble thing.

160
0:08:07.091,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's played a role in promoting cooperation

161
0:08:09.856,000 --> 0:08:1,000
among large numbers of people.

162
0:08:11.47,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Why couldn't you have a world organized in countries,

163
0:08:15.376,000 --> 0:08:17,000
all of which put themselves first?

164
0:08:19.193,000 --> 0:08:22,000
YNH: For many centuries, even thousands of years,

165
0:08:22.536,000 --> 0:08:24,000
patriotism worked quite well.

166
0:08:25.322,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Of course, it led to wars an so forth,

167
0:08:27.225,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but we shouldn't focus too much on the bad.

168
0:08:30.204,000 --> 0:08:33,000
There are also many, many positive things about patriotism,

169
0:08:33.77,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and the ability to have a large number of people

170
0:08:37.568,000 --> 0:08:38,000
care about each other,

171
0:08:39.006,000 --> 0:08:4,000
sympathize with one another,

172
0:08:40.636,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and come together for collective action.

173
0:08:43.874,000 --> 0:08:45,000
If you go back to the first nations,

174
0:08:46.593,000 --> 0:08:47,000
so, thousands of years ago,

175
0:08:48.442,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the people who lived along the Yellow River in China --

176
0:08:51.872,000 --> 0:08:53,000
it was many, many different tribes

177
0:08:54.339,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and they all depended on the river for survival and for prosperity,

178
0:08:58.733,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but all of them also suffered from periodical floods

179
0:09:03.066,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and periodical droughts.

180
0:09:04.69,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And no tribe could really do anything about it,

181
0:09:07.749,000 --> 0:09:11,000
because each of them controlled just a tiny section of the river.

182
0:09:11.933,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And then in a long and complicated process,

183
0:09:14.721,000 --> 0:09:17,000
the tribes coalesced together to form the Chinese nation,

184
0:09:18.669,000 --> 0:09:2,000
which controlled the entire Yellow River

185
0:09:21.327,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and had the ability to bring hundreds of thousands of people together

186
0:09:26.798,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to build dams and canals and regulate the river

187
0:09:31.073,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and prevent the worst floods and droughts

188
0:09:34.284,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and raise the level of prosperity for everybody.

189
0:09:37.408,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And this worked in many places around the world.

190
0:09:40.049,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But in the 21st century,

191
0:09:43.199,000 --> 0:09:46,000
technology is changing all that in a fundamental way.

192
0:09:46.658,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We are now living -- all people in the world --

193
0:09:49.396,000 --> 0:09:52,000
are living alongside the same cyber river,

194
0:09:53.237,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and no single nation can regulate this river by itself.

195
0:09:58.867,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We are all living together on a single planet,

196
0:10:02.934,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which is threatened by our own actions.

197
0:10:05.719,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And if you don't have some kind of global cooperation,

198
0:10:09.759,000 --> 0:10:14,000
nationalism is just not on the right level to tackle the problems,

199
0:10:14.926,000 --> 0:10:17,000
whether it's climate change or whether it's technological disruption.

200
0:10:19.581,000 --> 0:10:21,000
CA: So it was a beautiful idea

201
0:10:21.796,000 --> 0:10:24,000
in a world where most of the action, most of the issues,

202
0:10:25.768,000 --> 0:10:27,000
took place on national scale,

203
0:10:28.148,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but your argument is that the issues that matter most today

204
0:10:30.97,000 --> 0:10:33,000
no longer take place on a national scale but on a global scale.

205
0:10:34.138,000 --> 0:10:37,000
YNH: Exactly. All the major problems of the world today

206
0:10:37.971,000 --> 0:10:39,000
are global in essence,

207
0:10:40.384,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and they cannot be solved

208
0:10:41.899,000 --> 0:10:44,000
unless through some kind of global cooperation.

209
0:10:45.82,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It's not just climate change,

210
0:10:47.473,000 --> 0:10:5,000
which is, like, the most obvious example people give.

211
0:10:50.901,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I think more in terms of technological disruption.

212
0:10:54.003,000 --> 0:10:57,000
If you think about, for example, artificial intelligence,

213
0:10:57.077,000 --> 0:10:59,000
over the next 20, 30 years

214
0:11:00.094,000 --> 0:11:03,000
pushing hundreds of millions of people out of the job market --

215
0:11:04.002,000 --> 0:11:06,000
this is a problem on a global level.

216
0:11:06.277,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It will disrupt the economy of all the countries.

217
0:11:09.804,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And similarly, if you think about, say, bioengineering

218
0:11:13.491,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and people being afraid of conducting,

219
0:11:16.47,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I don't know, genetic engineering research in humans,

220
0:11:19.155,000 --> 0:11:24,000
it won't help if just a single country, let's say the US,

221
0:11:24.468,000 --> 0:11:27,000
outlaws all genetic experiments in humans,

222
0:11:27.816,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but China or North Korea continues to do it.

223
0:11:31.47,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So the US cannot solve it by itself,

224
0:11:34.234,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and very quickly, the pressure on the US to do the same will be immense

225
0:11:39.141,000 --> 0:11:43,000
because we are talking about high-risk, high-gain technologies.

226
0:11:44.055,000 --> 0:11:48,000
If somebody else is doing it, I can't allow myself to remain behind.

227
0:11:48.787,000 --> 0:11:53,000
The only way to have regulations, effective regulations,

228
0:11:54.499,000 --> 0:11:56,000
on things like genetic engineering,

229
0:11:56.616,000 --> 0:11:58,000
is to have global regulations.

230
0:11:58.652,000 --> 0:12:03,000
If you just have national regulations, nobody would like to stay behind.

231
0:12:03.714,000 --> 0:12:05,000
CA: So this is really interesting.

232
0:12:05.746,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It seems to me that this may be one key

233
0:12:07.701,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to provoking at least a constructive conversation

234
0:12:11.197,000 --> 0:12:12,000
between the different sides here,

235
0:12:12.894,000 --> 0:12:15,000
because I think everyone can agree that the start point

236
0:12:16.06,000 --> 0:12:18,000
of a lot of the anger that's propelled us to where we are

237
0:12:18.781,000 --> 0:12:2,000
is because of the legitimate concerns about job loss.

238
0:12:21.553,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Work is gone, a traditional way of life has gone,

239
0:12:25.218,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and it's no wonder that people are furious about that.

240
0:12:28.617,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And in general, they have blamed globalism, global elites,

241
0:12:33.193,000 --> 0:12:35,000
for doing this to them without asking their permission,

242
0:12:35.964,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and that seems like a legitimate complaint.

243
0:12:38.083,000 --> 0:12:41,000
But what I hear you saying is that -- so a key question is:

244
0:12:41.416,000 --> 0:12:46,000
What is the real cause of job loss, both now and going forward?

245
0:12:46.901,000 --> 0:12:48,000
To the extent that it's about globalism,

246
0:12:49.701,000 --> 0:12:53,000
then the right response, yes, is to shut down borders

247
0:12:53.847,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and keep people out and change trade agreements and so forth.

248
0:12:57.851,000 --> 0:12:58,000
But you're saying, I think,

249
0:12:59.231,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that actually the bigger cause of job loss is not going to be that at all.

250
0:13:04.046,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It's going to originate in technological questions,

251
0:13:07.784,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and we have no chance of solving that

252
0:13:09.82,000 --> 0:13:11,000
unless we operate as a connected world.

253
0:13:11.939,000 --> 0:13:12,000
YNH: Yeah, I think that,

254
0:13:13.482,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I don't know about the present, but looking to the future,

255
0:13:16.747,000 --> 0:13:19,000
it's not the Mexicans or Chinese who will take the jobs

256
0:13:19.848,000 --> 0:13:2,000
from the people in Pennsylvania,

257
0:13:21.439,000 --> 0:13:22,000
it's the robots and algorithms.

258
0:13:23.206,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So unless you plan to build a big wall on the border of California --

259
0:13:27.414,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Laughter)

260
0:13:28.572,000 --> 0:13:31,000
the wall on the border with Mexico is going to be very ineffective.

261
0:13:32.287,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And I was struck when I watched the debates before the election,

262
0:13:38.659,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I was struck that certainly Trump did not even attempt to frighten people

263
0:13:44.42,000 --> 0:13:46,000
by saying the robots will take your jobs.

264
0:13:47.02,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Now even if it's not true, it doesn't matter.

265
0:13:49.343,000 --> 0:13:52,000
It could have been an extremely effective way of frightening people --

266
0:13:52.885,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Laughter)

267
0:13:53.91,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and galvanizing people:

268
0:13:55.095,000 --> 0:13:56,000
"The robots will take your jobs!"

269
0:13:56.728,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And nobody used that line.

270
0:13:58.107,000 --> 0:14:,000
And it made me afraid,

271
0:14:00.823,000 --> 0:14:04,000
because it meant that no matter what happens

272
0:14:04.895,000 --> 0:14:06,000
in universities and laboratories,

273
0:14:07.065,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and there, there is already an intense debate about it,

274
0:14:09.854,000 --> 0:14:13,000
but in the mainstream political system and among the general public,

275
0:14:13.972,000 --> 0:14:15,000
people are just unaware

276
0:14:16.106,000 --> 0:14:2,000
that there could be an immense technological disruption --

277
0:14:20.64,000 --> 0:14:24,000
not in 200 years, but in 10, 20, 30 years --

278
0:14:24.786,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and we have to do something about it now,

279
0:14:27.38,000 --> 0:14:33,000
partly because most of what we teach children today in school or in college

280
0:14:33.68,000 --> 0:14:39,000
is going to be completely irrelevant to the job market of 2040, 2050.

281
0:14:39.705,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So it's not something we'll need to think about in 2040.

282
0:14:43.087,000 --> 0:14:46,000
We need to think today what to teach the young people.

283
0:14:46.704,000 --> 0:14:48,000
CA: Yeah, no, absolutely.

284
0:14:50.415,000 --> 0:14:53,000
You've often written about moments in history

285
0:14:54.356,000 --> 0:15:,000
where humankind has ... entered a new era, unintentionally.

286
0:15:01.626,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Decisions have been made, technologies have been developed,

287
0:15:04.518,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and suddenly the world has changed,

288
0:15:06.913,000 --> 0:15:08,000
possibly in a way that's worse for everyone.

289
0:15:09.404,000 --> 0:15:11,000
So one of the examples you give in "Sapiens"

290
0:15:11.503,000 --> 0:15:13,000
is just the whole agricultural revolution,

291
0:15:13.618,000 --> 0:15:16,000
which, for an actual person tilling the fields,

292
0:15:17.196,000 --> 0:15:2,000
they just picked up a 12-hour backbreaking workday

293
0:15:20.4,000 --> 0:15:26,000
instead of six hours in the jungle and a much more interesting lifestyle.

294
0:15:26.672,000 --> 0:15:27,000
(Laughter)

295
0:15:27.738,000 --> 0:15:3,000
So are we at another possible phase change here,

296
0:15:30.951,000 --> 0:15:34,000
where we kind of sleepwalk into a future that none of us actually wants?

297
0:15:35.878,000 --> 0:15:37,000
YNH: Yes, very much so.

298
0:15:38.635,000 --> 0:15:39,000
During the agricultural revolution,

299
0:15:40.496,000 --> 0:15:44,000
what happened is that immense technological and economic revolution

300
0:15:44.94,000 --> 0:15:46,000
empowered the human collective,

301
0:15:47.829,000 --> 0:15:49,000
but when you look at actual individual lives,

302
0:15:50.806,000 --> 0:15:53,000
the life of a tiny elite became much better,

303
0:15:54.324,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and the lives of the majority of people became considerably worse.

304
0:15:58.586,000 --> 0:16:,000
And this can happen again in the 21st century.

305
0:16:01.315,000 --> 0:16:05,000
No doubt the new technologies will empower the human collective.

306
0:16:06.205,000 --> 0:16:08,000
But we may end up again

307
0:16:08.949,000 --> 0:16:12,000
with a tiny elite reaping all the benefits, taking all the fruits,

308
0:16:13.43,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and the masses of the population finding themselves worse

309
0:16:17.64,000 --> 0:16:18,000
than they were before,

310
0:16:18.965,000 --> 0:16:2,000
certainly much worse than this tiny elite.

311
0:16:22.477,000 --> 0:16:24,000
CA: And those elites might not even be human elites.

312
0:16:25.156,000 --> 0:16:26,000
They might be cyborgs or --

313
0:16:26.937,000 --> 0:16:28,000
YNH: Yeah, they could be enhanced super humans.

314
0:16:29.168,000 --> 0:16:3,000
They could be cyborgs.

315
0:16:30.447,000 --> 0:16:32,000
They could be completely nonorganic elites.

316
0:16:32.828,000 --> 0:16:34,000
They could even be non-conscious algorithms.

317
0:16:35.38,000 --> 0:16:39,000
What we see now in the world is authority shifting away

318
0:16:40.315,000 --> 0:16:42,000
from humans to algorithms.

319
0:16:42.608,000 --> 0:16:45,000
More and more decisions -- about personal lives,

320
0:16:46.156,000 --> 0:16:48,000
about economic matters, about political matters --

321
0:16:48.852,000 --> 0:16:5,000
are actually being taken by algorithms.

322
0:16:51.355,000 --> 0:16:53,000
If you ask the bank for a loan,

323
0:16:54.013,000 --> 0:16:58,000
chances are your fate is decided by an algorithm, not by a human being.

324
0:16:58.734,000 --> 0:17:04,000
And the general impression is that maybe Homo sapiens just lost it.

325
0:17:04.945,000 --> 0:17:08,000
The world is so complicated, there is so much data,

326
0:17:09.529,000 --> 0:17:11,000
things are changing so fast,

327
0:17:12.107,000 --> 0:17:15,000
that this thing that evolved on the African savanna

328
0:17:15.732,000 --> 0:17:16,000
tens of thousands of years ago --

329
0:17:17.463,000 --> 0:17:2,000
to cope with a particular environment,

330
0:17:20.984,000 --> 0:17:23,000
a particular volume of information and data --

331
0:17:24.492,000 --> 0:17:28,000
it just can't handle the realities of the 21st century,

332
0:17:28.852,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and the only thing that may be able to handle it

333
0:17:31.773,000 --> 0:17:33,000
is big-data algorithms.

334
0:17:33.869,000 --> 0:17:39,000
So no wonder more and more authority is shifting from us to the algorithms.

335
0:17:40.677,000 --> 0:17:43,000
CA: So we're in New York City for the first of a series of TED Dialogues

336
0:17:44.55,000 --> 0:17:46,000
with Yuval Harari,

337
0:17:46.871,000 --> 0:17:49,000
and there's a Facebook Live audience out there.

338
0:17:50.739,000 --> 0:17:51,000
We're excited to have you with us.

339
0:17:52.414,000 --> 0:17:54,000
We'll start coming to some of your questions

340
0:17:54.54,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and questions of people in the room

341
0:17:56.278,000 --> 0:17:57,000
in just a few minutes,

342
0:17:57.467,000 --> 0:17:58,000
so have those coming.

343
0:17:59.455,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Yuval, if you're going to make the argument

344
0:18:03.376,000 --> 0:18:09,000
that we need to get past nationalism because of the coming technological ...

345
0:18:11.038,000 --> 0:18:12,000
danger, in a way,

346
0:18:12.903,000 --> 0:18:13,000
presented by so much of what's happening

347
0:18:14.872,000 --> 0:18:16,000
we've got to have a global conversation about this.

348
0:18:17.339,000 --> 0:18:2,000
Trouble is, it's hard to get people really believing that, I don't know,

349
0:18:20.791,000 --> 0:18:22,000
AI really is an imminent threat, and so forth.

350
0:18:22.976,000 --> 0:18:24,000
The things that people, some people at least,

351
0:18:25.726,000 --> 0:18:27,000
care about much more immediately, perhaps,

352
0:18:27.785,000 --> 0:18:28,000
is climate change,

353
0:18:29.393,000 --> 0:18:33,000
perhaps other issues like refugees, nuclear weapons, and so forth.

354
0:18:34.31,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Would you argue that where we are right now

355
0:18:39.38,000 --> 0:18:42,000
that somehow those issues need to be dialed up?

356
0:18:42.953,000 --> 0:18:44,000
You've talked about climate change,

357
0:18:45.137,000 --> 0:18:48,000
but Trump has said he doesn't believe in that.

358
0:18:48.817,000 --> 0:18:5,000
So in a way, your most powerful argument,

359
0:18:51.28,000 --> 0:18:53,000
you can't actually use to make this case.

360
0:18:54.05,000 --> 0:18:56,000
YNH: Yeah, I think with climate change,

361
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
at first sight, it's quite surprising

362
0:18:59.991,000 --> 0:19:01,000
that there is a very close correlation

363
0:19:02.519,000 --> 0:19:05,000
between nationalism and climate change.

364
0:19:05.865,000 --> 0:19:09,000
I mean, almost always, the people who deny climate change are nationalists.

365
0:19:10.476,000 --> 0:19:12,000
And at first sight, you think: Why?

366
0:19:12.581,000 --> 0:19:13,000
What's the connection?

367
0:19:13.758,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Why don't you have socialists denying climate change?

368
0:19:16.568,000 --> 0:19:18,000
But then, when you think about it, it's obvious --

369
0:19:18.943,000 --> 0:19:21,000
because nationalism has no solution to climate change.

370
0:19:22.711,000 --> 0:19:25,000
If you want to be a nationalist in the 21st century,

371
0:19:25.931,000 --> 0:19:26,000
you have to deny the problem.

372
0:19:27.827,000 --> 0:19:31,000
If you accept the reality of the problem, then you must accept that, yes,

373
0:19:32.338,000 --> 0:19:34,000
there is still room in the world for patriotism,

374
0:19:35.138,000 --> 0:19:39,000
there is still room in the world for having special loyalties

375
0:19:39.313,000 --> 0:19:43,000
and obligations towards your own people, towards your own country.

376
0:19:43.971,000 --> 0:19:46,000
I don't think anybody is really thinking of abolishing that.

377
0:19:47.815,000 --> 0:19:5,000
But in order to confront climate change,

378
0:19:50.84,000 --> 0:19:54,000
we need additional loyalties and commitments

379
0:19:55.075,000 --> 0:19:57,000
to a level beyond the nation.

380
0:19:57.104,000 --> 0:19:59,000
And that should not be impossible,

381
0:19:59.571,000 --> 0:20:02,000
because people can have several layers of loyalty.

382
0:20:03.287,000 --> 0:20:05,000
You can be loyal to your family

383
0:20:05.715,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and to your community

384
0:20:07.252,000 --> 0:20:08,000
and to your nation,

385
0:20:08.605,000 --> 0:20:11,000
so why can't you also be loyal to humankind as a whole?

386
0:20:12.257,000 --> 0:20:15,000
Of course, there are occasions when it becomes difficult,

387
0:20:15.68,000 --> 0:20:16,000
what to put first,

388
0:20:17.487,000 --> 0:20:18,000
but, you know, life is difficult.

389
0:20:19.334,000 --> 0:20:2,000
Handle it.

390
0:20:20.509,000 --> 0:20:22,000
(Laughter)

391
0:20:23.177,000 --> 0:20:27,000
CA: OK, so I would love to get some questions from the audience here.

392
0:20:27.699,000 --> 0:20:28,000
We've got a microphone here.

393
0:20:29.641,000 --> 0:20:32,000
Speak into it, and Facebook, get them coming, too.

394
0:20:32.882,000 --> 0:20:35,000
Howard Morgan: One of the things that has clearly made a huge difference

395
0:20:36.34,000 --> 0:20:37,000
in this country and other countries

396
0:20:38.15,000 --> 0:20:4,000
is the income distribution inequality,

397
0:20:40.388,000 --> 0:20:44,000
the dramatic change in income distribution in the US

398
0:20:44.626,000 --> 0:20:45,000
from what it was 50 years ago,

399
0:20:46.352,000 --> 0:20:47,000
and around the world.

400
0:20:47.527,000 --> 0:20:5,000
Is there anything we can do to affect that?

401
0:20:50.694,000 --> 0:20:52,000
Because that gets at a lot of the underlying causes.

402
0:20:56.103,000 --> 0:21:01,000
YNH: So far I haven't heard a very good idea about what to do about it,

403
0:21:01.441,000 --> 0:21:04,000
again, partly because most ideas remain on the national level,

404
0:21:05.193,000 --> 0:21:06,000
and the problem is global.

405
0:21:06.985,000 --> 0:21:08,000
I mean, one idea that we hear quite a lot about now

406
0:21:09.987,000 --> 0:21:1,000
is universal basic income.

407
0:21:11.843,000 --> 0:21:12,000
But this is a problem.

408
0:21:13.018,000 --> 0:21:14,000
I mean, I think it's a good start,

409
0:21:14.694,000 --> 0:21:17,000
but it's a problematic idea because it's not clear what "universal" is

410
0:21:18.44,000 --> 0:21:19,000
and it's not clear what "basic" is.

411
0:21:20.305,000 --> 0:21:23,000
Most people when they speak about universal basic income,

412
0:21:23.71,000 --> 0:21:25,000
they actually mean national basic income.

413
0:21:26.519,000 --> 0:21:27,000
But the problem is global.

414
0:21:28.287,000 --> 0:21:33,000
Let's say that you have AI and 3D printers taking away millions of jobs

415
0:21:33.961,000 --> 0:21:34,000
in Bangladesh,

416
0:21:35.141,000 --> 0:21:38,000
from all the people who make my shirts and my shoes.

417
0:21:38.413,000 --> 0:21:39,000
So what's going to happen?

418
0:21:39.743,000 --> 0:21:45,000
The US government will levy taxes on Google and Apple in California,

419
0:21:46.306,000 --> 0:21:5,000
and use that to pay basic income to unemployed Bangladeshis?

420
0:21:50.911,000 --> 0:21:52,000
If you believe that, you can just as well believe

421
0:21:53.571,000 --> 0:21:56,000
that Santa Claus will come and solve the problem.

422
0:21:57.258,000 --> 0:22:02,000
So unless we have really universal and not national basic income,

423
0:22:02.408,000 --> 0:22:05,000
the deep problems are not going to go away.

424
0:22:05.567,000 --> 0:22:07,000
And also it's not clear what basic is,

425
0:22:08.323,000 --> 0:22:1,000
because what are basic human needs?

426
0:22:10.98,000 --> 0:22:12,000
A thousand years ago, just food and shelter was enough.

427
0:22:13.814,000 --> 0:22:16,000
But today, people will say education is a basic human need,

428
0:22:17.449,000 --> 0:22:18,000
it should be part of the package.

429
0:22:19.046,000 --> 0:22:22,000
But how much? Six years? Twelve years? PhD?

430
0:22:22.849,000 --> 0:22:23,000
Similarly, with health care,

431
0:22:24.706,000 --> 0:22:26,000
let's say that in 20, 30, 40 years,

432
0:22:27.415,000 --> 0:22:3,000
you'll have expensive treatments that can extend human life

433
0:22:31.212,000 --> 0:22:32,000
to 120, I don't know.

434
0:22:33.151,000 --> 0:22:38,000
Will this be part of the basket of basic income or not?

435
0:22:38.366,000 --> 0:22:39,000
It's a very difficult problem,

436
0:22:39.819,000 --> 0:22:45,000
because in a world where people lose their ability to be employed,

437
0:22:46.101,000 --> 0:22:49,000
the only thing they are going to get is this basic income.

438
0:22:49.706,000 --> 0:22:54,000
So what's part of it is a very, very difficult ethical question.

439
0:22:54.857,000 --> 0:22:57,000
CA: There's a bunch of questions on how the world affords it as well,

440
0:22:58.185,000 --> 0:22:59,000
who pays.

441
0:22:59.369,000 --> 0:23:01,000
There's a question here from Facebook from Lisa Larson:

442
0:23:02.205,000 --> 0:23:04,000
"How does nationalism in the US now

443
0:23:04.804,000 --> 0:23:07,000
compare to that between World War I and World War II

444
0:23:08.243,000 --> 0:23:09,000
in the last century?"

445
0:23:09.688,000 --> 0:23:13,000
YNH: Well the good news, with regard to the dangers of nationalism,

446
0:23:14.16,000 --> 0:23:17,000
we are in a much better position than a century ago.

447
0:23:18.107,000 --> 0:23:2,000
A century ago, 1917,

448
0:23:20.803,000 --> 0:23:23,000
Europeans were killing each other by the millions.

449
0:23:23.96,000 --> 0:23:27,000
In 2016, with Brexit, as far as I remember,

450
0:23:28.335,000 --> 0:23:33,000
a single person lost their life, an MP who was murdered by some extremist.

451
0:23:33.596,000 --> 0:23:34,000
Just a single person.

452
0:23:35.153,000 --> 0:23:37,000
I mean, if Brexit was about British independence,

453
0:23:37.862,000 --> 0:23:41,000
this is the most peaceful war of independence in human history.

454
0:23:42.637,000 --> 0:23:47,000
And let's say that Scotland will now choose to leave the UK

455
0:23:48.45,000 --> 0:23:5,000
after Brexit.

456
0:23:50.65,000 --> 0:23:51,000
So in the 18th century,

457
0:23:52.658,000 --> 0:23:55,000
if Scotland wanted -- and the Scots wanted several times --

458
0:23:55.914,000 --> 0:23:58,000
to break out of the control of London,

459
0:23:59.471,000 --> 0:24:03,000
the reaction of the government in London was to send an army up north

460
0:24:03.793,000 --> 0:24:06,000
to burn down Edinburgh and massacre the highland tribes.

461
0:24:07.288,000 --> 0:24:12,000
My guess is that if, in 2018, the Scots vote for independence,

462
0:24:12.868,000 --> 0:24:15,000
the London government will not send an army up north

463
0:24:16.301,000 --> 0:24:17,000
to burn down Edinburgh.

464
0:24:17.928,000 --> 0:24:21,000
Very few people are now willing to kill or be killed

465
0:24:22.219,000 --> 0:24:24,000
for Scottish or for British independence.

466
0:24:24.965,000 --> 0:24:29,000
So for all the talk of the rise of nationalism

467
0:24:30.009,000 --> 0:24:32,000
and going back to the 1930s,

468
0:24:32.276,000 --> 0:24:35,000
to the 19th century, in the West at least,

469
0:24:36.075,000 --> 0:24:42,000
the power of national sentiments today is far, far smaller

470
0:24:42.683,000 --> 0:24:43,000
than it was a century ago.

471
0:24:44.247,000 --> 0:24:47,000
CA: Although some people now, you hear publicly worrying

472
0:24:48.108,000 --> 0:24:5,000
about whether that might be shifting,

473
0:24:50.888,000 --> 0:24:53,000
that there could actually be outbreaks of violence in the US

474
0:24:54.31,000 --> 0:24:56,000
depending on how things turn out.

475
0:24:56.681,000 --> 0:24:57,000
Should we be worried about that,

476
0:24:58.244,000 --> 0:25:,000
or do you really think things have shifted?

477
0:25:00.334,000 --> 0:25:01,000
YNH: No, we should be worried.

478
0:25:01.849,000 --> 0:25:02,000
We should be aware of two things.

479
0:25:03.498,000 --> 0:25:04,000
First of all, don't be hysterical.

480
0:25:05.159,000 --> 0:25:08,000
We are not back in the First World War yet.

481
0:25:08.63,000 --> 0:25:1,000
But on the other hand, don't be complacent.

482
0:25:11.594,000 --> 0:25:16,000
We reached from 1917 to 2017,

483
0:25:16.992,000 --> 0:25:18,000
not by some divine miracle,

484
0:25:19.198,000 --> 0:25:21,000
but simply by human decisions,

485
0:25:21.246,000 --> 0:25:23,000
and if we now start making the wrong decisions,

486
0:25:23.933,000 --> 0:25:27,000
we could be back in an analogous situation to 1917

487
0:25:28.442,000 --> 0:25:29,000
in a few years.

488
0:25:29.972,000 --> 0:25:31,000
One of the things I know as a historian

489
0:25:32.317,000 --> 0:25:35,000
is that you should never underestimate human stupidity.

490
0:25:36.016,000 --> 0:25:38,000
(Laughter)

491
0:25:38.923,000 --> 0:25:41,000
It's one of the most powerful forces in history,

492
0:25:42.031,000 --> 0:25:44,000
human stupidity and human violence.

493
0:25:44.382,000 --> 0:25:48,000
Humans do such crazy things for no obvious reason,

494
0:25:48.511,000 --> 0:25:49,000
but again, at the same time,

495
0:25:50.245,000 --> 0:25:53,000
another very powerful force in human history is human wisdom.

496
0:25:53.873,000 --> 0:25:54,000
We have both.

497
0:25:55.063,000 --> 0:25:57,000
CA: We have with us here moral psychologist Jonathan Haidt,

498
0:25:57.989,000 --> 0:25:58,000
who I think has a question.

499
0:26:00.691,000 --> 0:26:01,000
Jonathan Haidt: Thanks, Yuval.

500
0:26:02.198,000 --> 0:26:04,000
So you seem to be a fan of global governance,

501
0:26:04.705,000 --> 0:26:07,000
but when you look at the map of the world from Transparency International,

502
0:26:08.249,000 --> 0:26:11,000
which rates the level of corruption of political institutions,

503
0:26:11.601,000 --> 0:26:14,000
it's a vast sea of red with little bits of yellow here and there

504
0:26:14.705,000 --> 0:26:15,000
for those with good institutions.

505
0:26:16.334,000 --> 0:26:18,000
So if we were to have some kind of global governance,

506
0:26:18.859,000 --> 0:26:2,000
what makes you think it would end up being more like Denmark

507
0:26:21.714,000 --> 0:26:23,000
rather than more like Russia or Honduras,

508
0:26:23.778,000 --> 0:26:24,000
and aren't there alternatives,

509
0:26:25.303,000 --> 0:26:27,000
such as we did with CFCs?

510
0:26:27.413,000 --> 0:26:3,000
There are ways to solve global problems with national governments.

511
0:26:30.544,000 --> 0:26:32,000
What would world government actually look like,

512
0:26:32.782,000 --> 0:26:33,000
and why do you think it would work?

513
0:26:34.527,000 --> 0:26:37,000
YNH: Well, I don't know what it would look like.

514
0:26:38.311,000 --> 0:26:41,000
Nobody still has a model for that.

515
0:26:41.387,000 --> 0:26:43,000
The main reason we need it

516
0:26:44.039,000 --> 0:26:48,000
is because many of these issues are lose-lose situations.

517
0:26:48.357,000 --> 0:26:5,000
When you have a win-win situation like trade,

518
0:26:51.273,000 --> 0:26:53,000
both sides can benefit from a trade agreement,

519
0:26:54.213,000 --> 0:26:56,000
then this is something you can work out.

520
0:26:56.501,000 --> 0:26:58,000
Without some kind of global government,

521
0:26:58.871,000 --> 0:27:,000
national governments each have an interest in doing it.

522
0:27:01.749,000 --> 0:27:04,000
But when you have a lose-lose situation like with climate change,

523
0:27:05.744,000 --> 0:27:06,000
it's much more difficult

524
0:27:07.409,000 --> 0:27:11,000
without some overarching authority, real authority.

525
0:27:12.319,000 --> 0:27:14,000
Now, how to get there and what would it look like,

526
0:27:15.105,000 --> 0:27:16,000
I don't know.

527
0:27:16.489,000 --> 0:27:19,000
And certainly there is no obvious reason

528
0:27:20.25,000 --> 0:27:22,000
to think that it would look like Denmark,

529
0:27:22.554,000 --> 0:27:23,000
or that it would be a democracy.

530
0:27:24.166,000 --> 0:27:26,000
Most likely it wouldn't.

531
0:27:26.776,000 --> 0:27:32,000
We don't have workable democratic models

532
0:27:32.831,000 --> 0:27:34,000
for a global government.

533
0:27:34.951,000 --> 0:27:37,000
So maybe it would look more like ancient China

534
0:27:38.04,000 --> 0:27:39,000
than like modern Denmark.

535
0:27:39.763,000 --> 0:27:44,000
But still, given the dangers that we are facing,

536
0:27:45.01,000 --> 0:27:5,000
I think the imperative of having some kind of real ability

537
0:27:50.154,000 --> 0:27:54,000
to force through difficult decisions on the global level

538
0:27:54.306,000 --> 0:27:58,000
is more important than almost anything else.

539
0:27:59.411,000 --> 0:28:01,000
CA: There's a question from Facebook here,

540
0:28:01.533,000 --> 0:28:02,000
and then we'll get the mic to Andrew.

541
0:28:03.45,000 --> 0:28:05,000
So, Kat Hebron on Facebook,

542
0:28:05.67,000 --> 0:28:06,000
calling in from Vail:

543
0:28:07.362,000 --> 0:28:11,000
"How would developed nations manage the millions of climate migrants?"

544
0:28:12.638,000 --> 0:28:14,000
YNH: I don't know.

545
0:28:14.816,000 --> 0:28:15,000
CA: That's your answer, Kat. (Laughter)

546
0:28:16.732,000 --> 0:28:18,000
YNH: And I don't think that they know either.

547
0:28:18.902,000 --> 0:28:19,000
They'll just deny the problem, maybe.

548
0:28:20.72,000 --> 0:28:23,000
CA: But immigration, generally, is another example of a problem

549
0:28:23.769,000 --> 0:28:25,000
that's very hard to solve on a nation-by-nation basis.

550
0:28:26.366,000 --> 0:28:27,000
One nation can shut its doors,

551
0:28:27.86,000 --> 0:28:29,000
but maybe that stores up problems for the future.

552
0:28:30.418,000 --> 0:28:33,000
YNH: Yes, I mean -- it's another very good case,

553
0:28:34.314,000 --> 0:28:36,000
especially because it's so much easier

554
0:28:36.567,000 --> 0:28:37,000
to migrate today

555
0:28:38.422,000 --> 0:28:41,000
than it was in the Middle Ages or in ancient times.

556
0:28:42.135,000 --> 0:28:46,000
CA: Yuval, there's a belief among many technologists, certainly,

557
0:28:46.622,000 --> 0:28:48,000
that political concerns are kind of overblown,

558
0:28:48.997,000 --> 0:28:51,000
that actually, political leaders don't have that much influence

559
0:28:52.718,000 --> 0:28:53,000
in the world,

560
0:28:53.908,000 --> 0:28:56,000
that the real determination of humanity at this point is by science,

561
0:28:57.901,000 --> 0:28:58,000
by invention, by companies,

562
0:28:59.371,000 --> 0:29:03,000
by many things other than political leaders,

563
0:29:03.787,000 --> 0:29:05,000
and it's actually very hard for leaders to do much,

564
0:29:06.222,000 --> 0:29:08,000
so we're actually worrying about nothing here.

565
0:29:09.825,000 --> 0:29:11,000
YNH: Well, first, it should be emphasized

566
0:29:12.085,000 --> 0:29:16,000
that it's true that political leaders' ability to do good is very limited,

567
0:29:17.106,000 --> 0:29:2,000
but their ability to do harm is unlimited.

568
0:29:20.173,000 --> 0:29:22,000
There is a basic imbalance here.

569
0:29:22.797,000 --> 0:29:25,000
You can still press the button and blow everybody up.

570
0:29:26.389,000 --> 0:29:27,000
You have that kind of ability.

571
0:29:27.999,000 --> 0:29:3,000
But if you want, for example, to reduce inequality,

572
0:29:31.592,000 --> 0:29:32,000
that's very, very difficult.

573
0:29:33.493,000 --> 0:29:34,000
But to start a war,

574
0:29:34.913,000 --> 0:29:35,000
you can still do so very easily.

575
0:29:36.788,000 --> 0:29:39,000
So there is a built-in imbalance in the political system today

576
0:29:40.404,000 --> 0:29:41,000
which is very frustrating,

577
0:29:42.039,000 --> 0:29:46,000
where you cannot do a lot of good but you can still do a lot of harm.

578
0:29:46.964,000 --> 0:29:5,000
And this makes the political system still a very big concern.

579
0:29:51.632,000 --> 0:29:53,000
CA: So as you look at what's happening today,

580
0:29:53.807,000 --> 0:29:54,000
and putting your historian's hat on,

581
0:29:55.585,000 --> 0:29:58,000
do you look back in history at moments when things were going just fine

582
0:29:59.135,000 --> 0:30:04,000
and an individual leader really took the world or their country backwards?

583
0:30:05.127,000 --> 0:30:07,000
YNH: There are quite a few examples,

584
0:30:07.78,000 --> 0:30:09,000
but I should emphasize, it's never an individual leader.

585
0:30:10.623,000 --> 0:30:11,000
I mean, somebody put him there,

586
0:30:12.281,000 --> 0:30:15,000
and somebody allowed him to continue to be there.

587
0:30:15.588,000 --> 0:30:19,000
So it's never really just the fault of a single individual.

588
0:30:19.695,000 --> 0:30:23,000
There are a lot of people behind every such individual.

589
0:30:24.332,000 --> 0:30:27,000
CA: Can we have the microphone here, please, to Andrew?

590
0:30:30.952,000 --> 0:30:33,000
Andrew Solomon: You've talked a lot about the global versus the national,

591
0:30:34.54,000 --> 0:30:35,000
but increasingly, it seems to me,

592
0:30:36.19,000 --> 0:30:38,000
the world situation is in the hands of identity groups.

593
0:30:38.857,000 --> 0:30:4,000
We look at people within the United States

594
0:30:41.191,000 --> 0:30:42,000
who have been recruited by ISIS.

595
0:30:42.842,000 --> 0:30:44,000
We look at these other groups which have formed

596
0:30:45.057,000 --> 0:30:46,000
which go outside of national bounds

597
0:30:47.043,000 --> 0:30:49,000
but still represent significant authorities.

598
0:30:49.228,000 --> 0:30:51,000
How are they to be integrated into the system,

599
0:30:51.68,000 --> 0:30:54,000
and how is a diverse set of identities to be made coherent

600
0:30:55.417,000 --> 0:30:57,000
under either national or global leadership?

601
0:30:59.2,000 --> 0:31:02,000
YNH: Well, the problem of such diverse identities

602
0:31:02.445,000 --> 0:31:04,000
is a problem from nationalism as well.

603
0:31:05.049,000 --> 0:31:09,000
Nationalism believes in a single, monolithic identity,

604
0:31:09.428,000 --> 0:31:13,000
and exclusive or at least more extreme versions of nationalism

605
0:31:13.568,000 --> 0:31:16,000
believe in an exclusive loyalty to a single identity.

606
0:31:17.161,000 --> 0:31:19,000
And therefore, nationalism has had a lot of problems

607
0:31:20.101,000 --> 0:31:22,000
with people wanting to divide their identities

608
0:31:23.001,000 --> 0:31:25,000
between various groups.

609
0:31:25.088,000 --> 0:31:29,000
So it's not just a problem, say, for a global vision.

610
0:31:30.36,000 --> 0:31:33,000
And I think, again, history shows

611
0:31:34.236,000 --> 0:31:4,000
that you shouldn't necessarily think in such exclusive terms.

612
0:31:40.387,000 --> 0:31:43,000
If you think that there is just a single identity for a person,

613
0:31:43.819,000 --> 0:31:48,000
"I am just X, that's it, I can't be several things, I can be just that,"

614
0:31:48.883,000 --> 0:31:5,000
that's the start of the problem.

615
0:31:51.003,000 --> 0:31:53,000
You have religions, you have nations

616
0:31:53.815,000 --> 0:31:56,000
that sometimes demand exclusive loyalty,

617
0:31:57.021,000 --> 0:31:58,000
but it's not the only option.

618
0:31:58.776,000 --> 0:32:,000
There are many religions and many nations

619
0:32:01.182,000 --> 0:32:04,000
that enable you to have diverse identities at the same time.

620
0:32:05.084,000 --> 0:32:09,000
CA: But is one explanation of what's happened in the last year

621
0:32:09.465,000 --> 0:32:14,000
that a group of people have got fed up with, if you like,

622
0:32:14.669,000 --> 0:32:17,000
the liberal elites, for want of a better term,

623
0:32:17.86,000 --> 0:32:21,000
obsessing over many, many different identities and them feeling,

624
0:32:22.257,000 --> 0:32:25,000
"But what about my identity? I am being completely ignored here.

625
0:32:26.14,000 --> 0:32:28,000
And by the way, I thought I was the majority"?

626
0:32:29.138,000 --> 0:32:31,000
And that that's actually sparked a lot of the anger.

627
0:32:32.738,000 --> 0:32:35,000
YNH: Yeah. Identity is always problematic,

628
0:32:35.907,000 --> 0:32:39,000
because identity is always based on fictional stories

629
0:32:40.241,000 --> 0:32:42,000
that sooner or later collide with reality.

630
0:32:43.71,000 --> 0:32:44,000
Almost all identities,

631
0:32:45.252,000 --> 0:32:48,000
I mean, beyond the level of the basic community

632
0:32:48.687,000 --> 0:32:49,000
of a few dozen people,

633
0:32:50.18,000 --> 0:32:51,000
are based on a fictional story.

634
0:32:52.133,000 --> 0:32:53,000
They are not the truth.

635
0:32:53.798,000 --> 0:32:54,000
They are not the reality.

636
0:32:55.137,000 --> 0:32:58,000
It's just a story that people invent and tell one another

637
0:32:58.255,000 --> 0:32:59,000
and start believing.

638
0:32:59.77,000 --> 0:33:04,000
And therefore all identities are extremely unstable.

639
0:33:05.114,000 --> 0:33:07,000
They are not a biological reality.

640
0:33:07.665,000 --> 0:33:09,000
Sometimes nationalists, for example,

641
0:33:09.695,000 --> 0:33:11,000
think that the nation is a biological entity.

642
0:33:12.646,000 --> 0:33:15,000
It's made of the combination of soil and blood,

643
0:33:16.283,000 --> 0:33:17,000
creates the nation.

644
0:33:18.009,000 --> 0:33:21,000
But this is just a fictional story.

645
0:33:21.125,000 --> 0:33:23,000
CA: Soil and blood kind of makes a gooey mess.

646
0:33:23.712,000 --> 0:33:24,000
(Laughter)

647
0:33:25.558,000 --> 0:33:28,000
YNH: It does, and also it messes with your mind

648
0:33:28.606,000 --> 0:33:32,000
when you think too much that I am a combination of soil and blood.

649
0:33:33.414,000 --> 0:33:35,000
If you look from a biological perspective,

650
0:33:36.305,000 --> 0:33:39,000
obviously none of the nations that exist today

651
0:33:39.807,000 --> 0:33:41,000
existed 5,000 years ago.

652
0:33:42.074,000 --> 0:33:45,000
Homo sapiens is a social animal, that's for sure.

653
0:33:45.956,000 --> 0:33:47,000
But for millions of years,

654
0:33:48.407,000 --> 0:33:52,000
Homo sapiens and our hominid ancestors lived in small communities

655
0:33:53.07,000 --> 0:33:55,000
of a few dozen individuals.

656
0:33:55.423,000 --> 0:33:57,000
Everybody knew everybody else.

657
0:33:57.574,000 --> 0:34:01,000
Whereas modern nations are imagined communities,

658
0:34:01.619,000 --> 0:34:03,000
in the sense that I don't even know all these people.

659
0:34:04.194,000 --> 0:34:06,000
I come from a relatively small nation, Israel,

660
0:34:07.066,000 --> 0:34:09,000
and of eight million Israelis,

661
0:34:09.233,000 --> 0:34:1,000
I never met most of them.

662
0:34:11.247,000 --> 0:34:13,000
I will never meet most of them.

663
0:34:13.579,000 --> 0:34:15,000
They basically exist here.

664
0:34:16.165,000 --> 0:34:18,000
CA: But in terms of this identity,

665
0:34:18.938,000 --> 0:34:23,000
this group who feel left out and perhaps have work taken away,

666
0:34:24.399,000 --> 0:34:26,000
I mean, in "Homo Deus,"

667
0:34:26.717,000 --> 0:34:29,000
you actually speak of this group in one sense expanding,

668
0:34:29.852,000 --> 0:34:32,000
that so many people may have their jobs taken away

669
0:34:33.498,000 --> 0:34:37,000
by technology in some way that we could end up with

670
0:34:37.902,000 --> 0:34:4,000
a really large -- I think you call it a "useless class" --

671
0:34:41.097,000 --> 0:34:43,000
a class where traditionally,

672
0:34:43.224,000 --> 0:34:45,000
as viewed by the economy, these people have no use.

673
0:34:45.979,000 --> 0:34:46,000
YNH: Yes.

674
0:34:47.201,000 --> 0:34:49,000
CA: How likely a possibility is that?

675
0:34:50.156,000 --> 0:34:52,000
Is that something we should be terrified about?

676
0:34:52.924,000 --> 0:34:54,000
And can we address it in any way?

677
0:34:55.607,000 --> 0:34:57,000
YNH: We should think about it very carefully.

678
0:34:57.878,000 --> 0:34:59,000
I mean, nobody really knows what the job market will look like

679
0:35:00.873,000 --> 0:35:01,000
in 2040, 2050.

680
0:35:02.587,000 --> 0:35:04,000
There is a chance many new jobs will appear,

681
0:35:05.319,000 --> 0:35:06,000
but it's not certain.

682
0:35:07.097,000 --> 0:35:09,000
And even if new jobs do appear,

683
0:35:09.332,000 --> 0:35:1,000
it won't necessarily be easy

684
0:35:11.34,000 --> 0:35:13,000
for a 50-year old unemployed truck driver

685
0:35:14.363,000 --> 0:35:17,000
made unemployed by self-driving vehicles,

686
0:35:17.42,000 --> 0:35:2,000
it won't be easy for an unemployed truck driver

687
0:35:21.097,000 --> 0:35:25,000
to reinvent himself or herself as a designer of virtual worlds.

688
0:35:25.907,000 --> 0:35:29,000
Previously, if you look at the trajectory of the industrial revolution,

689
0:35:30.113,000 --> 0:35:34,000
when machines replaced humans in one type of work,

690
0:35:34.294,000 --> 0:35:38,000
the solution usually came from low-skill work

691
0:35:38.599,000 --> 0:35:4,000
in new lines of business.

692
0:35:41.211,000 --> 0:35:44,000
So you didn't need any more agricultural workers,

693
0:35:44.637,000 --> 0:35:49,000
so people moved to working in low-skill industrial jobs,

694
0:35:50.075,000 --> 0:35:53,000
and when this was taken away by more and more machines,

695
0:35:53.568,000 --> 0:35:55,000
people moved to low-skill service jobs.

696
0:35:56.562,000 --> 0:35:59,000
Now, when people say there will be new jobs in the future,

697
0:35:59.946,000 --> 0:36:01,000
that humans can do better than AI,

698
0:36:02.399,000 --> 0:36:03,000
that humans can do better than robots,

699
0:36:04.253,000 --> 0:36:06,000
they usually think about high-skill jobs,

700
0:36:06.917,000 --> 0:36:09,000
like software engineers designing virtual worlds.

701
0:36:10.812,000 --> 0:36:15,000
Now, I don't see how an unemployed cashier from Wal-Mart

702
0:36:16.23,000 --> 0:36:2,000
reinvents herself or himself at 50 as a designer of virtual worlds,

703
0:36:20.877,000 --> 0:36:21,000
and certainly I don't see

704
0:36:22.372,000 --> 0:36:25,000
how the millions of unemployed Bangladeshi textile workers

705
0:36:25.863,000 --> 0:36:26,000
will be able to do that.

706
0:36:27.498,000 --> 0:36:28,000
I mean, if they are going to do it,

707
0:36:29.242,000 --> 0:36:32,000
we need to start teaching the Bangladeshis today

708
0:36:32.622,000 --> 0:36:33,000
how to be software designers,

709
0:36:34.4,000 --> 0:36:35,000
and we are not doing it.

710
0:36:35.667,000 --> 0:36:37,000
So what will they do in 20 years?

711
0:36:38.182,000 --> 0:36:41,000
CA: So it feels like you're really highlighting a question

712
0:36:42.12,000 --> 0:36:46,000
that's really been bugging me the last few months more and more.

713
0:36:46.327,000 --> 0:36:48,000
It's almost a hard question to ask in public,

714
0:36:49.206,000 --> 0:36:52,000
but if any mind has some wisdom to offer in it, maybe it's yours,

715
0:36:52.621,000 --> 0:36:53,000
so I'm going to ask you:

716
0:36:54.19,000 --> 0:36:55,000
What are humans for?

717
0:36:57.052,000 --> 0:36:58,000
YNH: As far as we know, for nothing.

718
0:36:59.01,000 --> 0:37:,000
(Laughter)

719
0:37:00.746,000 --> 0:37:05,000
I mean, there is no great cosmic drama, some great cosmic plan,

720
0:37:06.296,000 --> 0:37:08,000
that we have a role to play in.

721
0:37:09.161,000 --> 0:37:12,000
And we just need to discover what our role is

722
0:37:12.209,000 --> 0:37:14,000
and then play it to the best of our ability.

723
0:37:15.225,000 --> 0:37:19,000
This has been the story of all religions and ideologies and so forth,

724
0:37:20.227,000 --> 0:37:23,000
but as a scientist, the best I can say is this is not true.

725
0:37:23.729,000 --> 0:37:28,000
There is no universal drama with a role in it for Homo sapiens.

726
0:37:29.111,000 --> 0:37:3,000
So --

727
0:37:30.816,000 --> 0:37:32,000
CA: I'm going to push back on you just for a minute,

728
0:37:33.333,000 --> 0:37:34,000
just from your own book,

729
0:37:34.551,000 --> 0:37:35,000
because in "Homo Deus,"

730
0:37:35.899,000 --> 0:37:4,000
you give really one of the most coherent and understandable accounts

731
0:37:40.982,000 --> 0:37:42,000
about sentience, about consciousness,

732
0:37:43.238,000 --> 0:37:45,000
and that unique sort of human skill.

733
0:37:46.22,000 --> 0:37:48,000
You point out that it's different from intelligence,

734
0:37:48.737,000 --> 0:37:5,000
the intelligence that we're building in machines,

735
0:37:51.095,000 --> 0:37:54,000
and that there's actually a lot of mystery around it.

736
0:37:54.777,000 --> 0:37:57,000
How can you be sure there's no purpose

737
0:37:58.178,000 --> 0:38:02,000
when we don't even understand what this sentience thing is?

738
0:38:02.253,000 --> 0:38:04,000
I mean, in your own thinking, isn't there a chance

739
0:38:04.853,000 --> 0:38:08,000
that what humans are for is to be the universe's sentient things,

740
0:38:09.189,000 --> 0:38:12,000
to be the centers of joy and love and happiness and hope?

741
0:38:12.636,000 --> 0:38:15,000
And maybe we can build machines that actually help amplify that,

742
0:38:15.695,000 --> 0:38:17,000
even if they're not going to become sentient themselves?

743
0:38:18.383,000 --> 0:38:19,000
Is that crazy?

744
0:38:19.558,000 --> 0:38:22,000
I kind of found myself hoping that, reading your book.

745
0:38:23.065,000 --> 0:38:26,000
YNH: Well, I certainly think that the most interesting question today in science

746
0:38:26.946,000 --> 0:38:28,000
is the question of consciousness and the mind.

747
0:38:29.393,000 --> 0:38:32,000
We are getting better and better in understanding the brain

748
0:38:32.915,000 --> 0:38:33,000
and intelligence,

749
0:38:34.199,000 --> 0:38:36,000
but we are not getting much better

750
0:38:36.76,000 --> 0:38:38,000
in understanding the mind and consciousness.

751
0:38:39.127,000 --> 0:38:42,000
People often confuse intelligence and consciousness,

752
0:38:42.513,000 --> 0:38:44,000
especially in places like Silicon Valley,

753
0:38:44.836,000 --> 0:38:47,000
which is understandable, because in humans, they go together.

754
0:38:48.617,000 --> 0:38:51,000
I mean, intelligence basically is the ability to solve problems.

755
0:38:52.22,000 --> 0:38:54,000
Consciousness is the ability to feel things,

756
0:38:54.786,000 --> 0:38:59,000
to feel joy and sadness and boredom and pain and so forth.

757
0:39:00.022,000 --> 0:39:04,000
In Homo sapiens and all other mammals as well -- it's not unique to humans --

758
0:39:04.085,000 --> 0:39:06,000
in all mammals and birds and some other animals,

759
0:39:06.756,000 --> 0:39:08,000
intelligence and consciousness go together.

760
0:39:09.43,000 --> 0:39:12,000
We often solve problems by feeling things.

761
0:39:13.032,000 --> 0:39:14,000
So we tend to confuse them.

762
0:39:14.549,000 --> 0:39:15,000
But they are different things.

763
0:39:16.038,000 --> 0:39:19,000
What's happening today in places like Silicon Valley

764
0:39:19.15,000 --> 0:39:22,000
is that we are creating artificial intelligence

765
0:39:22.8,000 --> 0:39:23,000
but not artificial consciousness.

766
0:39:24.646,000 --> 0:39:27,000
There has been an amazing development in computer intelligence

767
0:39:28.05,000 --> 0:39:29,000
over the last 50 years,

768
0:39:29.636,000 --> 0:39:33,000
and exactly zero development in computer consciousness,

769
0:39:33.861,000 --> 0:39:36,000
and there is no indication that computers are going to become conscious

770
0:39:37.571,000 --> 0:39:39,000
anytime soon.

771
0:39:40.126,000 --> 0:39:45,000
So first of all, if there is some cosmic role for consciousness,

772
0:39:45.8,000 --> 0:39:47,000
it's not unique to Homo sapiens.

773
0:39:47.954,000 --> 0:39:49,000
Cows are conscious, pigs are conscious,

774
0:39:50.297,000 --> 0:39:52,000
chimpanzees are conscious, chickens are conscious,

775
0:39:53.154,000 --> 0:39:56,000
so if we go that way, first of all, we need to broaden our horizons

776
0:39:57.031,000 --> 0:40:01,000
and remember very clearly we are not the only sentient beings on Earth,

777
0:40:01.78,000 --> 0:40:02,000
and when it comes to sentience --

778
0:40:03.599,000 --> 0:40:06,000
when it comes to intelligence, there is good reason to think

779
0:40:06.935,000 --> 0:40:09,000
we are the most intelligent of the whole bunch.

780
0:40:10.255,000 --> 0:40:12,000
But when it comes to sentience,

781
0:40:12.853,000 --> 0:40:15,000
to say that humans are more sentient than whales,

782
0:40:16.035,000 --> 0:40:2,000
or more sentient than baboons or more sentient than cats,

783
0:40:20.206,000 --> 0:40:22,000
I see no evidence for that.

784
0:40:22.524,000 --> 0:40:25,000
So first step is, you go in that direction, expand.

785
0:40:26.155,000 --> 0:40:29,000
And then the second question of what is it for,

786
0:40:30.161,000 --> 0:40:31,000
I would reverse it

787
0:40:31.967,000 --> 0:40:35,000
and I would say that I don't think sentience is for anything.

788
0:40:36.227,000 --> 0:40:4,000
I think we don't need to find our role in the universe.

789
0:40:40.423,000 --> 0:40:45,000
The really important thing is to liberate ourselves from suffering.

790
0:40:46.26,000 --> 0:40:48,000
What characterizes sentient beings

791
0:40:49.277,000 --> 0:40:51,000
in contrast to robots, to stones,

792
0:40:52.021,000 --> 0:40:53,000
to whatever,

793
0:40:53.228,000 --> 0:40:56,000
is that sentient beings suffer, can suffer,

794
0:40:57.043,000 --> 0:40:59,000
and what they should focus on

795
0:40:59.407,000 --> 0:41:03,000
is not finding their place in some mysterious cosmic drama.

796
0:41:03.551,000 --> 0:41:06,000
They should focus on understanding what suffering is,

797
0:41:07.394,000 --> 0:41:1,000
what causes it and how to be liberated from it.

798
0:41:11.392,000 --> 0:41:14,000
CA: I know this is a big issue for you, and that was very eloquent.

799
0:41:14.893,000 --> 0:41:17,000
We're going to have a blizzard of questions from the audience here,

800
0:41:18.331,000 --> 0:41:19,000
and maybe from Facebook as well,

801
0:41:20.275,000 --> 0:41:21,000
and maybe some comments as well.

802
0:41:21.972,000 --> 0:41:22,000
So let's go quick.

803
0:41:23.792,000 --> 0:41:24,000
There's one right here.

804
0:41:26.872,000 --> 0:41:28,000
Keep your hands held up at the back if you want the mic,

805
0:41:29.705,000 --> 0:41:3,000
and we'll get it back to you.

806
0:41:31.148,000 --> 0:41:34,000
Question: In your work, you talk a lot about the fictional stories

807
0:41:34.291,000 --> 0:41:35,000
that we accept as truth,

808
0:41:35.659,000 --> 0:41:36,000
and we live our lives by it.

809
0:41:37.4,000 --> 0:41:39,000
As an individual, knowing that,

810
0:41:39.923,000 --> 0:41:42,000
how does it impact the stories that you choose to live your life,

811
0:41:43.693,000 --> 0:41:46,000
and do you confuse them with the truth, like all of us?

812
0:41:48.066,000 --> 0:41:49,000
YNH: I try not to.

813
0:41:49.301,000 --> 0:41:51,000
I mean, for me, maybe the most important question,

814
0:41:52.093,000 --> 0:41:54,000
both as a scientist and as a person,

815
0:41:54.595,000 --> 0:41:57,000
is how to tell the difference between fiction and reality,

816
0:41:58.494,000 --> 0:42:,000
because reality is there.

817
0:42:01.114,000 --> 0:42:03,000
I'm not saying that everything is fiction.

818
0:42:03.22,000 --> 0:42:06,000
It's just very difficult for human beings to tell the difference

819
0:42:06.296,000 --> 0:42:07,000
between fiction and reality,

820
0:42:07.937,000 --> 0:42:11,000
and it has become more and more difficult as history progressed,

821
0:42:12.906,000 --> 0:42:14,000
because the fictions that we have created --

822
0:42:15.381,000 --> 0:42:18,000
nations and gods and money and corporations --

823
0:42:18.573,000 --> 0:42:19,000
they now control the world.

824
0:42:20.107,000 --> 0:42:21,000
So just to even think,

825
0:42:21.308,000 --> 0:42:24,000
"Oh, this is just all fictional entities that we've created,"

826
0:42:24.477,000 --> 0:42:25,000
is very difficult.

827
0:42:25.948,000 --> 0:42:27,000
But reality is there.

828
0:42:28.863,000 --> 0:42:3,000
For me the best ...

829
0:42:30.892,000 --> 0:42:32,000
There are several tests

830
0:42:33.039,000 --> 0:42:35,000
to tell the difference between fiction and reality.

831
0:42:35.833,000 --> 0:42:38,000
The simplest one, the best one that I can say in short,

832
0:42:39.283,000 --> 0:42:4,000
is the test of suffering.

833
0:42:40.888,000 --> 0:42:41,000
If it can suffer, it's real.

834
0:42:43.012,000 --> 0:42:44,000
If it can't suffer, it's not real.

835
0:42:44.73,000 --> 0:42:45,000
A nation cannot suffer.

836
0:42:46.219,000 --> 0:42:47,000
That's very, very clear.

837
0:42:47.813,000 --> 0:42:48,000
Even if a nation loses a war,

838
0:42:49.775,000 --> 0:42:53,000
we say, "Germany suffered a defeat in the First World War,"

839
0:42:53.864,000 --> 0:42:54,000
it's a metaphor.

840
0:42:55.053,000 --> 0:42:57,000
Germany cannot suffer. Germany has no mind.

841
0:42:57.634,000 --> 0:42:58,000
Germany has no consciousness.

842
0:42:59.311,000 --> 0:43:02,000
Germans can suffer, yes, but Germany cannot.

843
0:43:02.993,000 --> 0:43:04,000
Similarly, when a bank goes bust,

844
0:43:05.986,000 --> 0:43:06,000
the bank cannot suffer.

845
0:43:07.781,000 --> 0:43:1,000
When the dollar loses its value, the dollar doesn't suffer.

846
0:43:11.196,000 --> 0:43:13,000
People can suffer. Animals can suffer.

847
0:43:13.47,000 --> 0:43:14,000
This is real.

848
0:43:14.65,000 --> 0:43:18,000
So I would start, if you really want to see reality,

849
0:43:19.203,000 --> 0:43:21,000
I would go through the door of suffering.

850
0:43:21.291,000 --> 0:43:23,000
If you can really understand what suffering is,

851
0:43:24.269,000 --> 0:43:26,000
this will give you also the key

852
0:43:26.516,000 --> 0:43:28,000
to understand what reality is.

853
0:43:28.557,000 --> 0:43:3,000
CA: There's a Facebook question here that connects to this,

854
0:43:31.364,000 --> 0:43:33,000
from someone around the world in a language that I cannot read.

855
0:43:34.365,000 --> 0:43:36,000
YNH: Oh, it's Hebrew. CA: Hebrew. There you go.

856
0:43:36.606,000 --> 0:43:37,000
(Laughter)

857
0:43:37.692,000 --> 0:43:38,000
Can you read the name?

858
0:43:38.88,000 --> 0:43:39,000
YNH: Or Lauterbach Goren.

859
0:43:40.779,000 --> 0:43:41,000
CA: Well, thank you for writing in.

860
0:43:42.647,000 --> 0:43:46,000
The question is: "Is the post-truth era really a brand-new era,

861
0:43:47.226,000 --> 0:43:51,000
or just another climax or moment in a never-ending trend?

862
0:43:52.521,000 --> 0:43:55,000
YNH: Personally, I don't connect with this idea of post-truth.

863
0:43:55.874,000 --> 0:43:57,000
My basic reaction as a historian is:

864
0:43:58.606,000 --> 0:44:01,000
If this is the era of post-truth, when the hell was the era of truth?

865
0:44:02.525,000 --> 0:44:03,000
CA: Right.

866
0:44:03.8,000 --> 0:44:04,000
(Laughter)

867
0:44:05.144,000 --> 0:44:09,000
YNH: Was it the 1980s, the 1950s, the Middle Ages?

868
0:44:09.851,000 --> 0:44:13,000
I mean, we have always lived in an era, in a way, of post-truth.

869
0:44:14.703,000 --> 0:44:16,000
CA: But I'd push back on that,

870
0:44:17.038,000 --> 0:44:19,000
because I think what people are talking about

871
0:44:19.732,000 --> 0:44:25,000
is that there was a world where you had fewer journalistic outlets,

872
0:44:26.716,000 --> 0:44:29,000
where there were traditions, that things were fact-checked.

873
0:44:30.388,000 --> 0:44:33,000
It was incorporated into the charter of those organizations

874
0:44:34.357,000 --> 0:44:36,000
that the truth mattered.

875
0:44:36.548,000 --> 0:44:37,000
So if you believe in a reality,

876
0:44:38.321,000 --> 0:44:4,000
then what you write is information.

877
0:44:40.568,000 --> 0:44:43,000
There was a belief that that information should connect to reality in a real way,

878
0:44:44.413,000 --> 0:44:46,000
and if you wrote a headline, it was a serious, earnest attempt

879
0:44:47.398,000 --> 0:44:49,000
to reflect something that had actually happened.

880
0:44:49.725,000 --> 0:44:5,000
And people didn't always get it right.

881
0:44:51.6,000 --> 0:44:53,000
But I think the concern now is you've got

882
0:44:53.633,000 --> 0:44:55,000
a technological system that's incredibly powerful

883
0:44:55.975,000 --> 0:44:59,000
that, for a while at least, massively amplified anything

884
0:45:00.169,000 --> 0:45:02,000
with no attention paid to whether it connected to reality,

885
0:45:02.973,000 --> 0:45:05,000
only to whether it connected to clicks and attention,

886
0:45:06.151,000 --> 0:45:07,000
and that that was arguably toxic.

887
0:45:07.791,000 --> 0:45:09,000
That's a reasonable concern, isn't it?

888
0:45:10.251,000 --> 0:45:12,000
YNH: Yeah, it is. I mean, the technology changes,

889
0:45:12.561,000 --> 0:45:17,000
and it's now easier to disseminate both truth and fiction and falsehood.

890
0:45:17.813,000 --> 0:45:19,000
It goes both ways.

891
0:45:19.84,000 --> 0:45:23,000
It's also much easier, though, to spread the truth than it was ever before.

892
0:45:24.443,000 --> 0:45:27,000
But I don't think there is anything essentially new

893
0:45:28.152,000 --> 0:45:32,000
about this disseminating fictions and errors.

894
0:45:32.896,000 --> 0:45:36,000
There is nothing that -- I don't know -- Joseph Goebbels, didn't know

895
0:45:36.954,000 --> 0:45:41,000
about all this idea of fake news and post-truth.

896
0:45:42.417,000 --> 0:45:45,000
He famously said that if you repeat a lie often enough,

897
0:45:46.159,000 --> 0:45:47,000
people will think it's the truth,

898
0:45:48.004,000 --> 0:45:5,000
and the bigger the lie, the better,

899
0:45:50.384,000 --> 0:45:56,000
because people won't even think that something so big can be a lie.

900
0:45:56.431,000 --> 0:46:01,000
I think that fake news has been with us for thousands of years.

901
0:46:02.113,000 --> 0:46:03,000
Just think of the Bible.

902
0:46:04.038,000 --> 0:46:05,000
(Laughter)

903
0:46:05.449,000 --> 0:46:06,000
CA: But there is a concern

904
0:46:06.76,000 --> 0:46:1,000
that the fake news is associated with tyrannical regimes,

905
0:46:10.801,000 --> 0:46:12,000
and when you see an uprise in fake news

906
0:46:13.402,000 --> 0:46:17,000
that is a canary in the coal mine that there may be dark times coming.

907
0:46:19.944,000 --> 0:46:25,000
YNH: Yeah. I mean, the intentional use of fake news is a disturbing sign.

908
0:46:27.632,000 --> 0:46:31,000
But I'm not saying that it's not bad, I'm just saying that it's not new.

909
0:46:32.64,000 --> 0:46:34,000
CA: There's a lot of interest on Facebook on this question

910
0:46:35.418,000 --> 0:46:4,000
about global governance versus nationalism.

911
0:46:41.112,000 --> 0:46:42,000
Question here from Phil Dennis:

912
0:46:42.644,000 --> 0:46:45,000
"How do we get people, governments, to relinquish power?

913
0:46:46.164,000 --> 0:46:49,000
Is that -- is that -- actually, the text is so big

914
0:46:50.103,000 --> 0:46:51,000
I can't read the full question.

915
0:46:51.667,000 --> 0:46:52,000
But is that a necessity?

916
0:46:53.23,000 --> 0:46:55,000
Is it going to take war to get there?

917
0:46:55.866,000 --> 0:46:58,000
Sorry Phil -- I mangled your question, but I blame the text right here.

918
0:46:59.58,000 --> 0:47:01,000
YNH: One option that some people talk about

919
0:47:01.704,000 --> 0:47:05,000
is that only a catastrophe can shake humankind

920
0:47:06.467,000 --> 0:47:11,000
and open the path to a real system of global governance,

921
0:47:11.755,000 --> 0:47:15,000
and they say that we can't do it before the catastrophe,

922
0:47:15.927,000 --> 0:47:17,000
but we need to start laying the foundations

923
0:47:18.752,000 --> 0:47:2,000
so that when the disaster strikes,

924
0:47:21.276,000 --> 0:47:23,000
we can react quickly.

925
0:47:23.482,000 --> 0:47:27,000
But people will just not have the motivation to do such a thing

926
0:47:27.506,000 --> 0:47:29,000
before the disaster strikes.

927
0:47:29.542,000 --> 0:47:31,000
Another thing that I would emphasize

928
0:47:31.831,000 --> 0:47:36,000
is that anybody who is really interested in global governance

929
0:47:36.909,000 --> 0:47:38,000
should always make it very, very clear

930
0:47:39.834,000 --> 0:47:45,000
that it doesn't replace or abolish local identities and communities,

931
0:47:46.442,000 --> 0:47:48,000
that it should come both as --

932
0:47:49.422,000 --> 0:47:52,000
It should be part of a single package.

933
0:47:52.753,000 --> 0:47:55,000
CA: I want to hear more on this,

934
0:47:56.155,000 --> 0:47:59,000
because the very words "global governance"

935
0:47:59.232,000 --> 0:48:03,000
are almost the epitome of evil in the mindset of a lot of people

936
0:48:03.845,000 --> 0:48:04,000
on the alt-right right now.

937
0:48:05.195,000 --> 0:48:07,000
It just seems scary, remote, distant, and it has let them down,

938
0:48:08.173,000 --> 0:48:12,000
and so globalists, global governance -- no, go away!

939
0:48:12.313,000 --> 0:48:15,000
And many view the election as the ultimate poke in the eye

940
0:48:16.019,000 --> 0:48:17,000
to anyone who believes in that.

941
0:48:17.521,000 --> 0:48:2,000
So how do we change the narrative

942
0:48:21.096,000 --> 0:48:23,000
so that it doesn't seem so scary and remote?

943
0:48:24.095,000 --> 0:48:26,000
Build more on this idea of it being compatible

944
0:48:26.863,000 --> 0:48:28,000
with local identity, local communities.

945
0:48:29.508,000 --> 0:48:31,000
YNH: Well, I think again we should start

946
0:48:32.132,000 --> 0:48:35,000
really with the biological realities

947
0:48:35.288,000 --> 0:48:37,000
of Homo sapiens.

948
0:48:37.323,000 --> 0:48:41,000
And biology tells us two things about Homo sapiens

949
0:48:41.465,000 --> 0:48:43,000
which are very relevant to this issue:

950
0:48:43.746,000 --> 0:48:46,000
first of all, that we are completely dependent

951
0:48:46.799,000 --> 0:48:48,000
on the ecological system around us,

952
0:48:49.418,000 --> 0:48:52,000
and that today we are talking about a global system.

953
0:48:52.901,000 --> 0:48:53,000
You cannot escape that.

954
0:48:54.282,000 --> 0:48:57,000
And at the same time, biology tells us about Homo sapiens

955
0:48:57.928,000 --> 0:48:59,000
that we are social animals,

956
0:49:00.199,000 --> 0:49:04,000
but that we are social on a very, very local level.

957
0:49:04.86,000 --> 0:49:07,000
It's just a simple fact of humanity

958
0:49:08.429,000 --> 0:49:12,000
that we cannot have intimate familiarity

959
0:49:13.25,000 --> 0:49:16,000
with more than about 150 individuals.

960
0:49:17.149,000 --> 0:49:21,000
The size of the natural group,

961
0:49:21.47,000 --> 0:49:24,000
the natural community of Homo sapiens,

962
0:49:24.596,000 --> 0:49:27,000
is not more than 150 individuals,

963
0:49:27.964,000 --> 0:49:33,000
and everything beyond that is really based on all kinds of imaginary stories

964
0:49:34.387,000 --> 0:49:36,000
and large-scale institutions,

965
0:49:36.458,000 --> 0:49:4,000
and I think that we can find a way,

966
0:49:40.858,000 --> 0:49:44,000
again, based on a biological understanding of our species,

967
0:49:45.452,000 --> 0:49:47,000
to weave the two together

968
0:49:47.558,000 --> 0:49:5,000
and to understand that today in the 21st century,

969
0:49:50.658,000 --> 0:49:55,000
we need both the global level and the local community.

970
0:49:56.218,000 --> 0:49:58,000
And I would go even further than that

971
0:49:58.259,000 --> 0:50:01,000
and say that it starts with the body itself.

972
0:50:02.32,000 --> 0:50:06,000
The feelings that people today have of alienation and loneliness

973
0:50:06.686,000 --> 0:50:09,000
and not finding their place in the world,

974
0:50:09.926,000 --> 0:50:14,000
I would think that the chief problem is not global capitalism.

975
0:50:16.105,000 --> 0:50:19,000
The chief problem is that over the last hundred years,

976
0:50:19.155,000 --> 0:50:22,000
people have been becoming disembodied,

977
0:50:22.883,000 --> 0:50:25,000
have been distancing themselves from their body.

978
0:50:26.066,000 --> 0:50:28,000
As a hunter-gatherer or even as a peasant,

979
0:50:28.986,000 --> 0:50:32,000
to survive, you need to be constantly in touch

980
0:50:33.208,000 --> 0:50:35,000
with your body and with your senses,

981
0:50:35.415,000 --> 0:50:36,000
every moment.

982
0:50:36.62,000 --> 0:50:38,000
If you go to the forest to look for mushrooms

983
0:50:38.791,000 --> 0:50:4,000
and you don't pay attention to what you hear,

984
0:50:41.192,000 --> 0:50:42,000
to what you smell, to what you taste,

985
0:50:43.092,000 --> 0:50:44,000
you're dead.

986
0:50:44.267,000 --> 0:50:46,000
So you must be very connected.

987
0:50:46.442,000 --> 0:50:5,000
In the last hundred years, people are losing their ability

988
0:50:51.062,000 --> 0:50:53,000
to be in touch with their body and their senses,

989
0:50:53.958,000 --> 0:50:55,000
to hear, to smell, to feel.

990
0:50:56.168,000 --> 0:50:59,000
More and more attention goes to screens,

991
0:50:59.318,000 --> 0:51:,000
to what is happening elsewhere,

992
0:51:00.862,000 --> 0:51:01,000
some other time.

993
0:51:02.107,000 --> 0:51:04,000
This, I think, is the deep reason

994
0:51:04.562,000 --> 0:51:07,000
for the feelings of alienation and loneliness and so forth,

995
0:51:08.48,000 --> 0:51:1,000
and therefore part of the solution

996
0:51:11.006,000 --> 0:51:15,000
is not to bring back some mass nationalism,

997
0:51:15.294,000 --> 0:51:19,000
but also reconnect with our own bodies,

998
0:51:19.442,000 --> 0:51:22,000
and if you are back in touch with your body,

999
0:51:22.729,000 --> 0:51:25,000
you will feel much more at home in the world also.

1000
0:51:25.923,000 --> 0:51:28,000
CA: Well, depending on how things go, we may all be back in the forest soon.

1001
0:51:29.632,000 --> 0:51:31,000
We're going to have one more question in the room

1002
0:51:32.005,000 --> 0:51:33,000
and one more on Facebook.

1003
0:51:33.532,000 --> 0:51:36,000
Ama Adi-Dako: Hello. I'm from Ghana, West Africa, and my question is:

1004
0:51:36.937,000 --> 0:51:4,000
I'm wondering how do you present and justify the idea of global governance

1005
0:51:41.563,000 --> 0:51:44,000
to countries that have been historically disenfranchised

1006
0:51:44.598,000 --> 0:51:46,000
by the effects of globalization,

1007
0:51:46.667,000 --> 0:51:48,000
and also, if we're talking about global governance,

1008
0:51:49.437,000 --> 0:51:52,000
it sounds to me like it will definitely come from a very Westernized idea

1009
0:51:53.085,000 --> 0:51:55,000
of what the "global" is supposed to look like.

1010
0:51:55.283,000 --> 0:51:58,000
So how do we present and justify that idea of global

1011
0:51:58.597,000 --> 0:52:,000
versus wholly nationalist

1012
0:52:01.614,000 --> 0:52:04,000
to people in countries like Ghana and Nigeria and Togo

1013
0:52:04.973,000 --> 0:52:06,000
and other countries like that?

1014
0:52:07.951,000 --> 0:52:13,000
YNH: I would start by saying that history is extremely unfair,

1015
0:52:14.389,000 --> 0:52:17,000
and that we should realize that.

1016
0:52:18.824,000 --> 0:52:21,000
Many of the countries that suffered most

1017
0:52:21.897,000 --> 0:52:25,000
from the last 200 years of globalization

1018
0:52:26.06,000 --> 0:52:27,000
and imperialism and industrialization

1019
0:52:28.044,000 --> 0:52:33,000
are exactly the countries which are also most likely to suffer most

1020
0:52:33.778,000 --> 0:52:35,000
from the next wave.

1021
0:52:36.591,000 --> 0:52:39,000
And we should be very, very clear about that.

1022
0:52:41.297,000 --> 0:52:44,000
If we don't have a global governance,

1023
0:52:44.372,000 --> 0:52:47,000
and if we suffer from climate change,

1024
0:52:47.599,000 --> 0:52:49,000
from technological disruptions,

1025
0:52:49.88,000 --> 0:52:52,000
the worst suffering will not be in the US.

1026
0:52:53.505,000 --> 0:52:58,000
The worst suffering will be in Ghana, will be in Sudan, will be in Syria,

1027
0:52:58.625,000 --> 0:53:,000
will be in Bangladesh, will be in those places.

1028
0:53:01.386,000 --> 0:53:07,000
So I think those countries have an even greater incentive

1029
0:53:07.446,000 --> 0:53:11,000
to do something about the next wave of disruption,

1030
0:53:12.197,000 --> 0:53:14,000
whether it's ecological or whether it's technological.

1031
0:53:14.746,000 --> 0:53:16,000
Again, if you think about technological disruption,

1032
0:53:17.616,000 --> 0:53:21,000
so if AI and 3D printers and robots will take the jobs

1033
0:53:22.256,000 --> 0:53:24,000
from billions of people,

1034
0:53:24.649,000 --> 0:53:27,000
I worry far less about the Swedes

1035
0:53:27.798,000 --> 0:53:3,000
than about the people in Ghana or in Bangladesh.

1036
0:53:31.427,000 --> 0:53:36,000
And therefore, because history is so unfair

1037
0:53:36.679,000 --> 0:53:4,000
and the results of a calamity

1038
0:53:41.049,000 --> 0:53:43,000
will not be shared equally between everybody,

1039
0:53:43.441,000 --> 0:53:47,000
as usual, the rich will be able to get away

1040
0:53:47.898,000 --> 0:53:5,000
from the worst consequences of climate change

1041
0:53:51.394,000 --> 0:53:53,000
in a way that the poor will not be able to.

1042
0:53:55.167,000 --> 0:53:58,000
CA: And here's a great question from Cameron Taylor on Facebook:

1043
0:53:58.599,000 --> 0:54:,000
"At the end of 'Sapiens,'"

1044
0:54:00.744,000 --> 0:54:02,000
you said we should be asking the question,

1045
0:54:02.831,000 --> 0:54:04,000
'What do we want to want?'

1046
0:54:05.211,000 --> 0:54:07,000
Well, what do you think we should want to want?"

1047
0:54:08.222,000 --> 0:54:11,000
YNH: I think we should want to want to know the truth,

1048
0:54:11.777,000 --> 0:54:13,000
to understand reality.

1049
0:54:15.027,000 --> 0:54:2,000
Mostly what we want is to change reality,

1050
0:54:20.165,000 --> 0:54:23,000
to fit it to our own desires, to our own wishes,

1051
0:54:23.907,000 --> 0:54:26,000
and I think we should first want to understand it.

1052
0:54:27.651,000 --> 0:54:3,000
If you look at the long-term trajectory of history,

1053
0:54:31.439,000 --> 0:54:33,000
what you see is that for thousands of years

1054
0:54:34.199,000 --> 0:54:37,000
we humans have been gaining control of the world outside us

1055
0:54:37.559,000 --> 0:54:4,000
and trying to shape it to fit our own desires.

1056
0:54:41.077,000 --> 0:54:44,000
And we've gained control of the other animals,

1057
0:54:44.289,000 --> 0:54:45,000
of the rivers, of the forests,

1058
0:54:45.844,000 --> 0:54:48,000
and reshaped them completely,

1059
0:54:49.361,000 --> 0:54:52,000
causing an ecological destruction

1060
0:54:52.746,000 --> 0:54:55,000
without making ourselves satisfied.

1061
0:54:55.948,000 --> 0:54:58,000
So the next step is we turn our gaze inwards,

1062
0:54:59.774,000 --> 0:55:03,000
and we say OK, getting control of the world outside us

1063
0:55:04.346,000 --> 0:55:05,000
did not really make us satisfied.

1064
0:55:06.234,000 --> 0:55:08,000
Let's now try to gain control of the world inside us.

1065
0:55:08.957,000 --> 0:55:1,000
This is the really big project

1066
0:55:11.144,000 --> 0:55:15,000
of science and technology and industry in the 21st century --

1067
0:55:15.464,000 --> 0:55:18,000
to try and gain control of the world inside us,

1068
0:55:19.01,000 --> 0:55:23,000
to learn how to engineer and produce bodies and brains and minds.

1069
0:55:23.957,000 --> 0:55:27,000
These are likely to be the main products of the 21st century economy.

1070
0:55:28.623,000 --> 0:55:31,000
When people think about the future, very often they think in terms,

1071
0:55:32.468,000 --> 0:55:35,000
"Oh, I want to gain control of my body and of my brain."

1072
0:55:36.439,000 --> 0:55:38,000
And I think that's very dangerous.

1073
0:55:39.273,000 --> 0:55:42,000
If we've learned anything from our previous history,

1074
0:55:42.563,000 --> 0:55:45,000
it's that yes, we gain the power to manipulate,

1075
0:55:46.5,000 --> 0:55:48,000
but because we didn't really understand the complexity

1076
0:55:49.314,000 --> 0:55:5,000
of the ecological system,

1077
0:55:51.143,000 --> 0:55:54,000
we are now facing an ecological meltdown.

1078
0:55:54.857,000 --> 0:55:59,000
And if we now try to reengineer the world inside us

1079
0:56:00.287,000 --> 0:56:02,000
without really understanding it,

1080
0:56:02.443,000 --> 0:56:06,000
especially without understanding the complexity of our mental system,

1081
0:56:06.783,000 --> 0:56:1,000
we might cause a kind of internal ecological disaster,

1082
0:56:11.467,000 --> 0:56:14,000
and we'll face a kind of mental meltdown inside us.

1083
0:56:16.09,000 --> 0:56:18,000
CA: Putting all the pieces together here --

1084
0:56:18.556,000 --> 0:56:2,000
the current politics, the coming technology,

1085
0:56:21.26,000 --> 0:56:23,000
concerns like the one you've just outlined --

1086
0:56:23.434,000 --> 0:56:26,000
I mean, it seems like you yourself are in quite a bleak place

1087
0:56:26.553,000 --> 0:56:27,000
when you think about the future.

1088
0:56:28.198,000 --> 0:56:29,000
You're pretty worried about it.

1089
0:56:29.804,000 --> 0:56:3,000
Is that right?

1090
0:56:31.02,000 --> 0:56:37,000
And if there was one cause for hope, how would you state that?

1091
0:56:37.732,000 --> 0:56:41,000
YNH: I focus on the most dangerous possibilities

1092
0:56:41.919,000 --> 0:56:44,000
partly because this is like my job or responsibility

1093
0:56:44.964,000 --> 0:56:45,000
as a historian or social critic.

1094
0:56:46.769,000 --> 0:56:5,000
I mean, the industry focuses mainly on the positive sides,

1095
0:56:51.555,000 --> 0:56:54,000
so it's the job of historians and philosophers and sociologists

1096
0:56:54.94,000 --> 0:56:58,000
to highlight the more dangerous potential of all these new technologies.

1097
0:56:59.405,000 --> 0:57:01,000
I don't think any of that is inevitable.

1098
0:57:01.912,000 --> 0:57:04,000
Technology is never deterministic.

1099
0:57:04.975,000 --> 0:57:05,000
You can use the same technology

1100
0:57:06.716,000 --> 0:57:08,000
to create very different kinds of societies.

1101
0:57:09.731,000 --> 0:57:11,000
If you look at the 20th century,

1102
0:57:11.793,000 --> 0:57:13,000
so, the technologies of the Industrial Revolution,

1103
0:57:14.598,000 --> 0:57:17,000
the trains and electricity and all that

1104
0:57:17.679,000 --> 0:57:2,000
could be used to create a communist dictatorship

1105
0:57:20.755,000 --> 0:57:22,000
or a fascist regime or a liberal democracy.

1106
0:57:23.584,000 --> 0:57:25,000
The trains did not tell you what to do with them.

1107
0:57:26.136,000 --> 0:57:3,000
Similarly, now, artificial intelligence and bioengineering and all of that --

1108
0:57:30.612,000 --> 0:57:33,000
they don't predetermine a single outcome.

1109
0:57:34.706,000 --> 0:57:37,000
Humanity can rise up to the challenge,

1110
0:57:37.907,000 --> 0:57:38,000
and the best example we have

1111
0:57:39.622,000 --> 0:57:42,000
of humanity rising up to the challenge of a new technology

1112
0:57:43.386,000 --> 0:57:44,000
is nuclear weapons.

1113
0:57:45.133,000 --> 0:57:48,000
In the late 1940s, '50s,

1114
0:57:48.166,000 --> 0:57:5,000
many people were convinced

1115
0:57:50.329,000 --> 0:57:54,000
that sooner or later the Cold War will end in a nuclear catastrophe,

1116
0:57:54.659,000 --> 0:57:55,000
destroying human civilization.

1117
0:57:56.458,000 --> 0:57:57,000
And this did not happen.

1118
0:57:57.962,000 --> 0:58:03,000
In fact, nuclear weapons prompted humans all over the world

1119
0:58:04.406,000 --> 0:58:08,000
to change the way that they manage international politics

1120
0:58:09.171,000 --> 0:58:11,000
to reduce violence.

1121
0:58:11.564,000 --> 0:58:14,000
And many countries basically took out war

1122
0:58:14.827,000 --> 0:58:15,000
from their political toolkit.

1123
0:58:16.725,000 --> 0:58:2,000
They no longer tried to pursue their interests with warfare.

1124
0:58:21.4,000 --> 0:58:24,000
Not all countries have done so, but many countries have.

1125
0:58:24.694,000 --> 0:58:27,000
And this is maybe the most important reason

1126
0:58:28.652,000 --> 0:58:34,000
why international violence declined dramatically since 1945,

1127
0:58:34.778,000 --> 0:58:37,000
and today, as I said, more people commit suicide

1128
0:58:38.14,000 --> 0:58:4,000
than are killed in war.

1129
0:58:40.371,000 --> 0:58:44,000
So this, I think, gives us a good example

1130
0:58:45.224,000 --> 0:58:48,000
that even the most frightening technology,

1131
0:58:49.09,000 --> 0:58:51,000
humans can rise up to the challenge

1132
0:58:51.649,000 --> 0:58:54,000
and actually some good can come out of it.

1133
0:58:54.696,000 --> 0:58:58,000
The problem is, we have very little margin for error.

1134
0:58:59.007,000 --> 0:59:01,000
If we don't get it right,

1135
0:59:01.24,000 --> 0:59:04,000
we might not have a second option to try again.

1136
0:59:06.157,000 --> 0:59:07,000
CA: That's a very powerful note,

1137
0:59:07.748,000 --> 0:59:09,000
on which I think we should draw this to a conclusion.

1138
0:59:10.577,000 --> 0:59:13,000
Before I wrap up, I just want to say one thing to people here

1139
0:59:13.712,000 --> 0:59:18,000
and to the global TED community watching online, anyone watching online:

1140
0:59:19.282,000 --> 0:59:21,000
help us with these dialogues.

1141
0:59:22.199,000 --> 0:59:24,000
If you believe, like we do,

1142
0:59:24.773,000 --> 0:59:26,000
that we need to find a different kind of conversation,

1143
0:59:27.777,000 --> 0:59:29,000
now more than ever, help us do it.

1144
0:59:30.034,000 --> 0:59:32,000
Reach out to other people,

1145
0:59:33.089,000 --> 0:59:35,000
try and have conversations with people you disagree with,

1146
0:59:35.853,000 --> 0:59:36,000
understand them,

1147
0:59:37.06,000 --> 0:59:38,000
pull the pieces together,

1148
0:59:38.614,000 --> 0:59:41,000
and help us figure out how to take these conversations forward

1149
0:59:42.53,000 --> 0:59:44,000
so we can make a real contribution

1150
0:59:44.808,000 --> 0:59:46,000
to what's happening in the world right now.

1151
0:59:47.577,000 --> 0:59:5,000
I think everyone feels more alive,

1152
0:59:50.92,000 --> 0:59:52,000
more concerned, more engaged

1153
0:59:53.254,000 --> 0:59:55,000
with the politics of the moment.

1154
0:59:55.807,000 --> 0:59:57,000
The stakes do seem quite high,

1155
0:59:58.285,000 --> 1:00:02,000
so help us respond to it in a wise, wise way.

1156
1:00:02.821,000 --> 1:00:03,000
Yuval Harari, thank you.

1157
1:00:04.44,000 --> 1:00:07,000
(Applause)

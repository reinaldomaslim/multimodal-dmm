1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Many of you could ask the question, you know,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
why is a flying car, or maybe more accurately,

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a roadable aircraft, possible at this time?

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
A number of years ago,

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Mr. Ford predicted that flying cars

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of some form would be available.

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now, 60 years later,

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'm here to tell you why it's possible.

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
When I was about five years old,

10
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
not very much -- about a year after

11
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Mr. Ford made his predictions,

12
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I was living in a rural part of Canada,

13
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area.

14
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Getting to school, for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age,

15
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
through the Canadian winter, was not a pleasant experience.

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It was a trying and scary thing

17
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
for a young kid to be going through.

18
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
At the end of my first year in school, in the summer of that year,

19
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I discovered a couple hummingbirds

20
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that were caught in a shed near my home.

21
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They'd worn themselves out,

22
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
beating themselves against the window,

23
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and, well, they were easy to capture.

24
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I took them outside and as I let them go, that split second, even though they were very tired,

25
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that second I let them go they hovered for a second,

26
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
then zipped off into the distance.

27
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I thought, what a great way to get to school.

28
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
For a kid at that age, this was like infinite speed, disappearing,

30
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and I was very inspired by that.

31
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And so the next -- over the next

32
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
six decades, believe it or not,

33
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I've built a number of aircraft,

34
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
with the goal of creating something that could do for you, or me,

35
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
what the hummingbird does,

36
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and give you that flexibility.

37
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I've called this vehicle, generically, a volantor,

38
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
after the Latin word "volant," meaning,

39
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
to fly in a light, nimble manner.

40
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Volantor-like helicopter, perhaps.

41
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The FAA, the controlling body above all,

42
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
calls it a "powered lift aircraft."

43
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And they've actually issued a pilot's license --

44
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
a powerlift pilot's license -- for this type of aircraft.

45
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It's closer than you think. It's kind of remarkable when you consider that

46
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
there are no operational powered lift aircraft.

47
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So for once, perhaps, the government is ahead of itself.

48
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The press calls my particular volantor a "Skycar."

49
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This is a little bit earlier version of it,

50
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that's why it's given the X designation,

51
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
but it's a four-passenger aircraft

52
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that could take off vertically, like a helicopter --

53
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
therefore it doesn't need an airfield.

54
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
On the ground, it's powered electrically.

55
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's actually classified as a motorcycle

56
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
because of the three wheels, which is a great asset

57
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
because it allows you, theoretically, to use this on the highways

58
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in most states, and actually in all cities.

59
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So that's an asset because if you've got to deal with the crash protection issues

60
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
of the automobile, forget it -- you're never going to fly it.

61
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
One could say that a helicopter

63
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
does pretty much what the hummingbird does,

64
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and gets around in much the same way, and it's true,

65
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but a helicopter is a very complex device.

66
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's expensive --

67
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
so expensive that very few people could own or use it.

68
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity,

69
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
as a series of parts -- a large number of parts --

70
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
flying in formation.

71
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Another difference, and I have to describe this,

73
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
because it's very personal,

74
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
another great difference between the helicopter

75
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and the volantor --

76
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in my case the Skycar volantor --

77
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is the experience that I've had

78
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in flying both of those.

79
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
In a helicopter you feel -- and it's still a remarkable sensation --

80
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
you feel like you're being hauled up from above

81
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
by a vibrating crane.

82
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
When you get in the Skycar -- and I can tell you,

83
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
there's only one other person that's flown it, but he had the same sensation --

84
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
you really feel like you're being lifted up

85
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
by a magic carpet,

86
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
without any vibration whatsoever. The sensation is unbelievable.

87
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And it's been a great motivator.

88
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I only get to fly this vehicle occasionally,

89
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and only when I can persuade my stockholders

90
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to let me do so,

91
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but it's still one of those wonderful experiences

92
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that reward you for all that time.

93
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
What we really need is something to replace the automobile

94
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
for those 50-plus mile trips.

95
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Very few people realize that 50 mile-plus trips

96
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
make up 85 percent of the miles traveled in America.

97
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
If we can get rid of that,

98
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
then the highways will now be useful to you,

99
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
as contrasted by what's happening

100
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in many parts of the world today.

101
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
On this next slide, is an interesting history

102
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
of what we really have seen in infrastructure,

103
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because whether I give you a perfect Skycar,

104
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
the perfect vehicle for use, it's going to have very little value to you

105
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
unless you've got a system to use it in.

106
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I'm sure any of you have asked the question,

107
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
yeah, are there great things up there -- what am I going to do, get up there?

108
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It's bad enough on a highway, what's it going to be like to be in the air?

109
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
This world that you're going to be talking about tomorrow

110
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is going to be completely integrated. You're not going to be a pilot,

111
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
you're going to be a passenger.

112
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And it's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward.

113
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I can tell you, technically we can build Skycars --

114
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
my God, we went to the moon!

115
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The technology there was much more difficult than what I'm dealing with here.

116
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But we have to have these priority changes,

117
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we have to have infrastructure to go with this.

118
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Historically you see that we got around

119
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
200 years ago by canals,

120
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and as that system disappeared, were replaced by railroads.

121
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
As that disappeared we came in with highways.

122
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But if you look at that top corner -- the highway system --

123
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
you see where we are today. Highways are no longer being built,

124
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and that's a fact. You won't see any additional highways

125
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
in the next 10 years.

126
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
However, the next 10 years, if like the last 10 years,

127
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we're going to see 30 percent more traffic.

128
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And where is that going to lead you to?

129
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So the issue then, I've often asked, is

130
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
when is it going to happen?

131
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
When are we going to be able to have these vehicles?

132
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And of course, if you ask me, I'm going to give you a really optimistic view.

133
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
After all, I've been spending 60 years here believing it's going to happen tomorrow.

134
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So, I'm not going to quote myself on this.

135
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I'd prefer to quote someone else,

136
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
who testified with me before Congress,

137
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and in his position as head of NASA

138
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
put forward this particular vision

139
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
of the future of this type of aircraft.

140
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Now I would argue, actually, if you look at the fact that on the highways today,

141
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
you're only averaging about 30 miles per hour --

142
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
on average, according to the DOT --

143
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
the Skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour,

144
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
up to 25,000 feet.

145
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And so, in effect, you could see perhaps a tenfold increase

146
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in the ability to get around

147
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
as far as speed is concerned.

148
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Unbeknownst to many of you,

149
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the highway in the sky that I'm talking about here

150
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
has been under construction for 10 years.

151
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It makes use of the GPS -- you're familiar with GPS in your automobile,

152
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but you may not be familiar with the fact that there's a GPS U.S.,

153
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
there's a Russian GPS,

154
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and there's a new GPS system

155
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
going to Europe, called Galileo.

156
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
With those three systems,

157
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
you have what is always necessary --

158
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
a level of redundancy that says,

159
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
if one system fails, you'll still have a way

160
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to make sure that you're being controlled.

161
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Because if you're in this world, where computers are controlling what you're doing,

162
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
it's going to be very critical that something can't fail on you.

163
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
How would a trip in a Skycar work?

164
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Well, you can't right now

165
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
take off from your home because it's too noisy.

166
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I mean to be able to take off from your home, you'd have to be extremely quiet.

167
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But it's still fairly quiet.

168
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
You'd motor, electrically, to a vertiport,

169
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
which may be a few blocks, maybe even a few miles away.

170
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
This is clearly, as I said earlier, a roadable aircraft,

171
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and you're not going to spend that much time on the road.

172
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
After all, if you can fly like that,

173
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
why are you going to drive around on a highway?

174
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Go to a local vertiport,

175
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
plug in your destination,

176
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
delivered almost like a passenger.

177
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
You can play computer games, you can sleep, you can read on the way.

178
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
This is the world -- there won't be you as a pilot. And I know the pilots in the audience aren't going to like that --

179
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and I've had a lot of bad feedback

180
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
from people who want to be up there, flying around

181
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and experiencing that.

182
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And of course, I suppose like recreational parks you can still do that.

183
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But the vehicle itself is going to be a very, very controlled environment.

184
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Or it's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system.

185
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We flew the first vehicle for the international press

186
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in 1965, when I really got it started.

187
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I was a professor at the U.C. Davis System,

188
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and I got a lot of excitement around this,

189
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and I was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time.

190
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And then through the various years

191
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
we invented various vehicles.

192
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
Actually the critical point was in 1989,

193
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle --

194
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
how completely stable it was in all circumstances,

195
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
which is of course very critical.

196
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Still not a practical vehicle during all of this,

197
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
but moving in the right direction, we believe.

198
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Finally, in the early part of --

199
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
or actually the middle of 2002,

200
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
we flew the 400 -- M400, which was the four-passenger vehicle.

201
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
In this case here, we're flying it remotely, as we always did at the beginning.

202
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And we had very small power plants in it at this time.

203
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We are now installing larger powerplants,

204
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
which will make it possible for me to get back on board.

205
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
A vertical-takeoff aircraft

206
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program.

207
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
There's an old adage that applied for the years

208
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
between 1950s and 1970s,

209
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
when every aeronautical company

210
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
was working on vertical-takeoff aircraft.

211
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
A vertical-takeoff aircraft

212
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
needs an artificial stabilization system --

213
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
that's essential.

214
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
At least for the hover,

215
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and the low-speed flight.

216
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
If that single-stability system,

217
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that brain that flies that aircraft, fails, or if the engine fails,

218
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that vehicle crashes. There is no option to that.

219
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And the adage that I'm referring to,

220
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that applied at that time,

221
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
was that nothing comes down faster

222
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
than a VTOL aircraft upside down.

223
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Laughter)

224
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
That's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots.

225
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
In fact, the aircraft companies gave up on

226
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
vertical-takeoff aircraft

227
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
more or less for a number of years.

228
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And there's really only one operational aircraft in the world today

229
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that's a vertical-takeoff aircraft -- as distinct from a helicopter --

230
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and that's the Hawker Harrier jump jet.

231
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
A vertical-takeoff aircraft,

232
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
like the hummingbird,

233
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
has a very high metabolism,

234
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
which means it requires a lot of energy.

235
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Getting that energy is very, very difficult. It all comes down

236
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to that power plant -- how to get a large amount of power in a small package.

237
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Fortunately, Dr. Felix Wankel

238
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
invented the rotary engine.

239
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
A very unique engine -- it's round,

240
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
it's small, it's vibration-free.

241
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It fits exactly where we need to fit it,

242
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system --

243
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
very critical. In fact that engine --

244
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
for those who are into the automobile --

245
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
know that it recently is applied to the RX8 --

246
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the Mazda.

247
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And that sportscar won Sports Car of the Year.

248
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Wonderful engine.

249
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
In that application, it generates one horsepower per pound,

250
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
which is twice as good as your car engine today,

251
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
but only half of what we need.

252
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
My company has spent 35 years

253
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine,

254
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
which was invented in the late '50s, and getting it to the point that we get

255
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
over two horsepower per pound, reliably, and critical.

256
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We actually get 175 horsepower

257
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
into one cubic foot.

258
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
We have eight engines in this vehicle.

259
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
We have four computers. We have two parachutes.

260
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Redundancy is the critical issue here.

261
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
If you want to stay alive you've got to have backups.

262
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine,

263
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and continued to hover.

264
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
The computers back up each other. There's a voting system --

265
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
if one computer is not agreeing with the other three,

266
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
it's kicked out of the system.

267
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And then you have three -- you still have the triple redundancy.

268
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
If one of those fails, you still have a second chance.

269
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
If you stick around, then good luck.

270
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
There won't be a third chance.

271
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The parachutes are there -- hopefully,

272
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
more for psychological than real reasons, but

273
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that.

274
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Laughter)

275
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I'd like to show you an animation in this next one,

276
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
which is one element

277
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
of the Skycar's use,

278
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
but it's one that demonstrates how it could be used.

279
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
You could think of it personally in your own terms,

280
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
of how you might use it.

281
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
Video: Skycar dispatched, launch rescue vehicle for San Francisco.

282
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Paul Moller: I believe that personal transportation

283
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
in something like the Skycar,

284
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
probably in another volantor form as well,

285
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
will be a significant part of our lives,

286
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
as Dr. Goldin says, within the next 10 years.

287
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And it's going to change the demographics in a very significant way.

288
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
If you can live 75 miles from San Francisco and get there in 15 minutes,

289
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
you're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment,

290
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain,

291
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
buy a Skycar,

292
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
which I think would be priced at that time perhaps

293
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
in the area of 100,000 dollars, put money in the bank ...

294
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
that's a very significant incentive for getting out of San Francisco.

295
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
But you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell.

296
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Laughter)

297
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Developing the Skycar has been a real challenge.

298
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Obviously I'm dependent on a lot of other people

299
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
believing in what I'm doing -- both financially and in technical help.

300
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And that has --

301
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you're doing,

302
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing.

303
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I characterized this emerging technology

304
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
in an aphorism,

305
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
as it's described,

306
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
which really talks about what I've experienced,

307
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and I'm sure what other people may have experienced

308
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
in emerging technologies.

309
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
There's an interesting poll that came out recently

310
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
under NAS --

311
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
I think it's MSNBC --

312
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
in which they asked the question,

313
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
"Are you in the market for a volantor?"

314
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Twenty-three percent said, "Yes, as soon as possible."

315
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Forty-seven percent -- yes, as soon as they could -- price could come down.

316
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Twenty-three percent said, "As soon as it's proven safe."

317
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Only seven percent said

318
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that they wouldn't consider buying a Skycar.

319
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
I'm encouraged by that. At least it makes me feel like,

320
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
to some extent, it is becoming self-evident.

321
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
That we need an alternative to the automobile,

322
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
at least for those 50-mile trips and more,

323
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
so that the highways become usable in today's world.

324
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Thank you.

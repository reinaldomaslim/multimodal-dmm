2
0:00:13.144,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Often when I'm out in public,

3
0:00:15.208,000 --> 0:00:16,000
a child will stare at me.

4
0:00:18.264,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And if the child is particularly brave, they'll approach me and ask:

5
0:00:23.784,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"Are you a pirate?"

6
0:00:24.959,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:28.355,000 --> 0:00:29,000
To which I then need to respond,

8
0:00:30.141,000 --> 0:00:31,000
once again,

9
0:00:31.642,000 --> 0:00:32,000
"Yes."

10
0:00:32.817,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:35.499,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I mean, let's be honest:

12
0:00:36.713,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I've got two hooks, prosthetic legs and a penchant for hard liquor.

13
0:00:40.206,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:41.682,000 --> 0:00:44,000
All I need is an eye-patch and a parrot, and I'm basically there.

15
0:00:44.77,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:47.339,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But I like being a pirate.

17
0:00:49.869,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I find many advantages to having a disability,

18
0:00:52.821,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I'm not just talking about the money I save on gloves ...

19
0:00:56.538,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

20
0:00:59.377,000 --> 0:01:02,000
or the fantastically legitimate excuse for never having to master chopsticks.

21
0:01:03.314,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:04.966,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I'm talking about real advantages I feel I've gained,

23
0:01:07.508,000 --> 0:01:09,000
having gone through physical adversity.

24
0:01:10.489,000 --> 0:01:12,000
When I was 19, I contracted a disease

25
0:01:12.752,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that resulted in the loss of both my arms at the elbows,

26
0:01:16.696,000 --> 0:01:17,000
both my legs below the knee,

27
0:01:18.625,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and left enough scars on my face to elicit jealousy in Freddy Krueger.

28
0:01:21.974,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:23.394,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now, I may never be able to communicate in sign language,

30
0:01:26.544,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but my increased resilience and general ability to problem-solve

31
0:01:30.023,000 --> 0:01:32,000
has been heightened by being forced to think laterally

32
0:01:32.572,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to overcome problems that most people aren't faced with.

33
0:01:39.065,000 --> 0:01:41,000
One of the first lessons that I learned

34
0:01:42.248,000 --> 0:01:44,000
immediately followed the painful and arduous task

35
0:01:45.005,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of learning how to walk again,

36
0:01:46.816,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but it went on to pay dividends for the rest of my life.

37
0:01:51.703,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It happened when I attempted to step up a curb.

38
0:01:55.062,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now as rudimentary as this action sounds to most of you,

39
0:01:57.843,000 --> 0:01:59,000
stepping up a curb is somewhat of a challenge

40
0:01:59.973,000 --> 0:02:01,000
for those of us without ankle movement.

41
0:02:02.231,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So I tried stepping up the curb

42
0:02:04.407,000 --> 0:02:06,000
the way I'd always known how, front on,

43
0:02:07.07,000 --> 0:02:08,000
for days on end,

44
0:02:08.807,000 --> 0:02:09,000
with no success,

45
0:02:10.548,000 --> 0:02:12,000
until it became obvious that the time and effort

46
0:02:12.812,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I was investing into this endeavor was clearly disproportionate

47
0:02:15.79,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to the benefit of its outcome.

48
0:02:17.304,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:22.517,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So, I decided to inspect the problem from a different angle.

50
0:02:26.586,000 --> 0:02:28,000
If I couldn't use an ankle joint

51
0:02:28.618,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to achieve the range of motion that I required to mount the curb,

52
0:02:31.897,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I would have to use a different joint,

53
0:02:33.732,000 --> 0:02:34,000
like my hip.

54
0:02:35.253,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So I turned my body perpendicular to the curb

55
0:02:38.017,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and placed my foot up sideways,

56
0:02:40.156,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and I was able to step up immediately.

57
0:02:43.439,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Within five minutes,

58
0:02:44.847,000 --> 0:02:46,000
no staircase was safe from my advances.

59
0:02:47.028,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:48.639,000 --> 0:02:51,000
That very day, I climbed a staircase of three flights,

61
0:02:52.227,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which I was quite impressed with as well,

62
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
except I realized that I didn't know how to get back down again.

63
0:02:57.403,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

64
0:02:59.702,000 --> 0:03:,000
That was a long weekend.

65
0:03:00.913,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:05.591,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now, in my past life as an able-bodied person,

67
0:03:08.554,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I'd been a guitarist.

68
0:03:11.285,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I was alright as a player,

69
0:03:12.619,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but I'd never really taken it further.

70
0:03:14.454,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I'd never really started a band or played live all that much.

71
0:03:18.048,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Nonetheless, music was a great passion of mine,

72
0:03:21.04,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and when I lost my arms,

73
0:03:22.335,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the idea that it may no longer be a part of my life

74
0:03:25.353,000 --> 0:03:27,000
critically challenged my will to keep living.

75
0:03:29.462,000 --> 0:03:3,000
However, the thought that emerged

76
0:03:31.394,000 --> 0:03:34,000
immediately after being discharged from hospital was:

77
0:03:34.673,000 --> 0:03:37,000
"If Ray Charles can play the piano while blind as a bat,

78
0:03:38.613,000 --> 0:03:4,000
let's get to work on a solution for this guitar problem."

79
0:03:41.964,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So, consulting with an engineer,

80
0:03:44.364,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I designed a slide system that would hook into my left hook,

81
0:03:48.05,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and I devised another pick-holder system that would clip into my right hook.

82
0:03:52.272,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, if this worked,

83
0:03:54.094,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I would be able to play the guitar open tuned on my lap, like a slide.

84
0:03:59.226,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So after weeks of testing and alterations,

85
0:04:01.925,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I finally had the accessories back to play the guitar again,

86
0:04:05.446,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and I was right back where I was before losing my hands --

87
0:04:08.29,000 --> 0:04:11,000
being issued with noise complaints from my neighbors, obviously.

88
0:04:11.418,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:13.246,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But this time, I took it further.

90
0:04:16.15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I started a band with my friends.

91
0:04:18.594,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We wrote songs and recorded them.

92
0:04:20.738,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We even played gigs to real people.

93
0:04:25.184,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Not as many as this.

94
0:04:26.374,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:29.152,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But even though it was a just a tiny step,

96
0:04:31.225,000 --> 0:04:35,000
it was a giant leap from what I'd achieved when I was all in one piece.

97
0:04:38.362,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now while relearning every action that one has ever cultivated

98
0:04:42.02,000 --> 0:04:44,000
might seem like a significant undertaking --

99
0:04:45.77,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and believe me, it very much was, in the short term --

100
0:04:48.854,000 --> 0:04:5,000
it was nonetheless having a positive effect

101
0:04:50.99,000 --> 0:04:52,000
on the way that I approached everything else in my life.

102
0:04:54.711,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Not only did it transform my ability to problem-solve,

103
0:04:57.339,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but I also felt I became more pragmatic,

104
0:05:00.912,000 --> 0:05:02,000
less sensitive to hindrances,

105
0:05:03.246,000 --> 0:05:04,000
in some cases, more patient,

106
0:05:05.943,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and magically transformed people's abilities

107
0:05:08.744,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to offer me their seats on public transport.

108
0:05:10.903,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:14.192,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Trivial setbacks began to pale in comparison

110
0:05:16.455,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to challenges I'd previously overcome,

111
0:05:19.492,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and this allowed me to take a calm and measured approach to these challenges,

112
0:05:23.137,000 --> 0:05:24,000
keeping them in perspective

113
0:05:24.775,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and often even finding new and improved ways to overcome them.

114
0:05:29.84,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The benefit of not dwelling on the negative

115
0:05:33.503,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and just getting on with the task at hand

116
0:05:36.179,000 --> 0:05:37,000
became self-evident.

117
0:05:39.819,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It even encouraged me to pursue some more fulfilling career paths

118
0:05:43.019,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that may otherwise have been inadvisable.

119
0:05:46.632,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And who would have thought that an appropriate job for me

120
0:05:49.387,000 --> 0:05:52,000
might involve the meticulous operation of electronic equipment

121
0:05:52.689,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to curate dance music to people in inaccessible places

122
0:05:55.538,000 --> 0:05:56,000
under the influence of alcohol.

123
0:05:57.055,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:59.822,000 --> 0:06:,000
Not I.

125
0:06:02.192,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So in a competitive industry where DJs have been relentlessly honing their craft,

126
0:06:06.05,000 --> 0:06:09,000
desperate to attain gigs, sending demos to clubs,

127
0:06:09.088,000 --> 0:06:11,000
my best friend and I took a different approach,

128
0:06:11.874,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and we started our own club night,

129
0:06:14.12,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and we employed ourselves as the DJs.

130
0:06:16.129,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Laughter)

131
0:06:18.53,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Suddenly, we had a headline slot.

132
0:06:20.271,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Laughter)

133
0:06:23.946,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Now, when we started that club night, I could not DJ.

134
0:06:28.487,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The first time I ever got behind the decks was on our opening night,

135
0:06:31.789,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in front of hundreds of people.

136
0:06:33.329,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I'd only just learned where the play button was.

137
0:06:35.701,000 --> 0:06:36,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:37.104,000 --> 0:06:39,000
But, being previously faced with so many ultimatums,

139
0:06:39.676,000 --> 0:06:42,000
one's forced to be astute in adapting to new situations.

140
0:06:44.234,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That club night went on to become

141
0:06:45.831,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the longest-running weekly club night in Sydney,

142
0:06:48.095,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and we as DJs went on to play Australia's biggest music festivals.

143
0:06:52.312,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So eventually, I either learned quickly,

144
0:06:55.182,000 --> 0:06:58,000
or the standards of clubs have gone really downhill.

145
0:06:58.321,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Laughter)

146
0:07:03.287,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Coming close to death can be an educational experience.

147
0:07:08.846,000 --> 0:07:12,000
It's certainly true that one's priorities receive somewhat of a realignment

148
0:07:13.204,000 --> 0:07:15,000
immediately afterwards.

149
0:07:15.551,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And it's also true that some of those priorities

150
0:07:17.909,000 --> 0:07:19,000
are met with an increased sense of urgency.

151
0:07:21,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But another, more salient realization that comes to light

152
0:07:24.6,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is the triviality of our own self-importance and self-consciousness.

153
0:07:29.719,000 --> 0:07:32,000
To truly understand the extent to which your self-consciousness

154
0:07:34.092,000 --> 0:07:36,000
prohibits you from engaging in opportunities

155
0:07:36.982,000 --> 0:07:38,000
should lead everyone to take risks they otherwise wouldn't.

156
0:07:41.203,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We're merely a blip on the time line of the universe, right?

157
0:07:45.226,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Act accordingly.

158
0:07:48.46,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Now the ideas that I'm presenting today were imbued upon me

159
0:07:51.333,000 --> 0:07:54,000
through some otherwise unfortunate circumstances, granted,

160
0:07:54.762,000 --> 0:07:57,000
but they're lying dormant in the lives of anyone who's willing to exploit them.

161
0:08:00.138,000 --> 0:08:03,000
If we all understand that we all have unique weaknesses,

162
0:08:04.796,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and if we're honest about what they are,

163
0:08:07.753,000 --> 0:08:09,000
we can learn how to best take advantage of them,

164
0:08:11.22,000 --> 0:08:17,000
whether they be mounting a curb or fear of presenting sales reports

165
0:08:17.696,000 --> 0:08:2,000
or the inability to sufficiently manage one's finances --

166
0:08:22.211,000 --> 0:08:23,000
looking at that guy --

167
0:08:23.418,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Laughter)

168
0:08:26.244,000 --> 0:08:29,000
there lies the ability to learn, to adapt,

169
0:08:29.505,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and even the ability to rewire one's instinctual response to challenges.

170
0:08:37.439,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Adversity is good,

171
0:08:38.79,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and it has the potential to make you stronger.

172
0:08:42.447,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And, at the very least,

173
0:08:44.794,000 --> 0:08:47,000
you can scare the hell out of kids if you look like a pirate.

174
0:08:48.175,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Thanks.

175
0:08:49.35,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Applause and cheers)

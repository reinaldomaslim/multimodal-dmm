1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I am very, very happy to be amidst some of the most --

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the lights are really disturbing my eyes

3
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and they're reflecting on my glasses.

4
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I am very happy and honored to be amidst

5
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:41,000
very, very innovative and intelligent people.

6
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I have listened to the three previous speakers,

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and guess what happened?

8
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Every single thing I planned to say, they have said it here,

9
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and it looks and sounds like I have nothing else to say.

10
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But there is a saying in my culture

12
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that if a bud leaves a tree without saying something,

13
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that bud is a young one.

14
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So, I will -- since I am not young and am very old,

15
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I still will say something.

16
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We are hosting this conference at a very opportune moment,

17
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:2,000
because another conference is taking place in Berlin.

18
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It is the G8 Summit.

19
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The G8 Summit proposes that the solution to Africa's problems

20
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
should be a massive increase in aid,

21
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
something akin to the Marshall Plan.

22
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Unfortunately, I personally do not believe in the Marshall Plan.

23
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:44,000
One, because the benefits of the Marshall Plan have been overstated.

24
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Its largest recipients were Germany and France,

25
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and it was only 2.5 percent of their GDP.

26
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
An average African country receives foreign aid

27
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to the tune of 13, 15 percent of its GDP,

28
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and that is an unprecedented transfer of financial resources

29
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
from rich countries to poor countries.

30
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But I want to say that there are two things we need to connect.

31
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:14,000
How the media covers Africa in the West, and the consequences of that.

32
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
By displaying despair, helplessness and hopelessness,

33
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the media is telling the truth about Africa, and nothing but the truth.

34
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:27,000
However, the media is not telling us the whole truth.

35
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Because despair, civil war, hunger and famine,

36
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:35,000
although they're part and parcel of our African reality,

37
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
they are not the only reality.

38
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And secondly, they are the smallest reality.

39
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Africa has 53 nations.

40
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We have civil wars only in six countries,

41
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:48,000
which means that the media are covering only six countries.

42
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Africa has immense opportunities that never navigate

43
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
through the web of despair and helplessness

44
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that the Western media largely presents to its audience.

45
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But the effect of that presentation is, it appeals to sympathy.

46
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It appeals to pity. It appeals to something called charity.

47
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And, as a consequence, the Western view

48
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:16,000
of Africa's economic dilemma is framed wrongly.

49
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The wrong framing is a product of thinking

50
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that Africa is a place of despair.

51
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:26,000
What should we do with it? We should give food to the hungry.

52
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We should deliver medicines to those who are ill.

53
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We should send peacekeeping troops

54
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to serve those who are facing a civil war.

55
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And in the process, Africa has been stripped of self-initiative.

56
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I want to say that it is important to recognize

57
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that Africa has fundamental weaknesses.

58
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But equally, it has opportunities and a lot of potential.

59
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We need to reframe the challenge that is facing Africa,

60
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
from a challenge of despair,

61
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:58,000
which is called poverty reduction,

62
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:,000
to a challenge of hope.

63
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We frame it as a challenge of hope, and that is worth creation.

64
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The challenge facing all those who are interested in Africa

65
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is not the challenge of reducing poverty.

66
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It should be a challenge of creating wealth.

67
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Once we change those two things --

68
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:2,000
if you say the Africans are poor and they need poverty reduction,

69
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you have the international cartel of good intentions

70
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
moving onto the continent, with what?

71
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Medicines for the poor, food relief for those who are hungry,

72
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and peacekeepers for those who are facing civil war.

73
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And in the process, none of these things really are productive

74
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
because you are treating the symptoms, not the causes

75
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
of Africa's fundamental problems.

76
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Sending somebody to school and giving them medicines,

77
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:52,000
ladies and gentlemen, does not create wealth for them.

78
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Wealth is a function of income, and income comes from you finding

79
0:04:56,000 --> 0:05:,000
a profitable trading opportunity or a well-paying job.

80
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now, once we begin to talk about wealth creation in Africa,

81
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
our second challenge will be,

82
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:08,000
who are the wealth-creating agents in any society?

83
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
They are entrepreneurs. [Unclear] told us they are always

84
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:16,000
about four percent of the population, but 16 percent are imitators.

85
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But they also succeed at the job of entrepreneurship.

86
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So, where should we be putting the money?

87
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We need to put money where it can productively grow.

88
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Support private investment in Africa, both domestic and foreign.

89
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Support research institutions,

90
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:4,000
because knowledge is an important part of wealth creation.

91
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But what is the international aid community doing with Africa today?

92
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They are throwing large sums of money for primary health,

93
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:5,000
for primary education, for food relief.

94
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The entire continent has been turned into

95
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
a place of despair, in need of charity.

96
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Ladies and gentlemen, can any one of you tell me

97
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
a neighbor, a friend, a relative that you know,

98
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:04,000
who became rich by receiving charity?

99
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:07,000
By holding the begging bowl and receiving alms?

100
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Does any one of you in the audience have that person?

101
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Does any one of you know a country that developed because of

102
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the generosity and kindness of another?

103
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Well, since I'm not seeing the hand,

104
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
it appears that what I'm stating is true.

105
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Bono: Yes!)

106
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Andrew Mwenda: I can see Bono says he knows the country.

107
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Which country is that?

108
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Bono: It's an Irish land.)

109
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Laughter)

110
0:06:31,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Bono: [unclear])

111
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
AM: Thank you very much. But let me tell you this.

112
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:41,000
External actors can only present to you an opportunity.

113
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:46,000
The ability to utilize that opportunity and turn it into an advantage

114
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
depends on your internal capacity.

115
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Africa has received many opportunities.

116
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Many of them we haven't benefited much.

117
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Why? Because we lack the internal, institutional framework

118
0:06:58,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and policy framework that can make it possible for us

119
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to benefit from our external relations. I'll give you an example.

120
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Under the Cotonou Agreement,

121
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
formerly known as the Lome Convention,

122
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:12,000
African countries have been given an opportunity by Europe

123
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to export goods, duty-free, to the European Union market.

124
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:23,000
My own country, Uganda, has a quota to export 50,000 metric tons

125
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:26,000
of sugar to the European Union market.

126
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We haven't exported one kilogram yet.

127
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We import 50,000 metric tons of sugar from Brazil and Cuba.

128
0:07:37,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Secondly, under the beef protocol of that agreement,

129
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
African countries that produce beef

130
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:47,000
have quotas to export beef duty-free to the European Union market.

131
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:51,000
None of those countries, including Africa's most successful nation, Botswana,

132
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
has ever met its quota.

133
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So, I want to argue today that the fundamental source of Africa's

134
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
inability to engage the rest of the world

135
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
in a more productive relationship

136
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is because it has a poor institutional and policy framework.

137
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And all forms of intervention need support,

138
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the evolution of the kinds of institutions that create wealth,

139
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
the kinds of institutions that increase productivity.

140
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:22,000
How do we begin to do that, and why is aid the bad instrument?

141
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Aid is the bad instrument, and do you know why?

142
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Because all governments across the world need money to survive.

143
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Money is needed for a simple thing like keeping law and order.

144
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
You have to pay the army and the police to show law and order.

145
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And because many of our governments are quite dictatorial,

146
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:42,000
they need really to have the army clobber the opposition.

147
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The second thing you need to do is pay your political hangers-on.

148
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Why should people support their government?

149
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Well, because it gives them good, paying jobs,

150
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:54,000
or, in many African countries, unofficial opportunities

151
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to profit from corruption.

152
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:59,000
The fact is no government in the world,

153
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:01,000
with the exception of a few, like that of Idi Amin,

154
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:06,000
can seek to depend entirely on force as an instrument of rule.

155
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Many countries in the [unclear], they need legitimacy.

156
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:15,000
To get legitimacy, governments often need to deliver things like primary education,

157
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:2,000
primary health, roads, build hospitals and clinics.

158
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:22,000
If the government's fiscal survival

159
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:26,000
depends on it having to raise money from its own people,

160
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
such a government is driven by self-interest

161
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
to govern in a more enlightened fashion.

162
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:33,000
It will sit with those who create wealth.

163
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Talk to them about the kind of policies and institutions

164
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that are necessary for them to expand a scale and scope of business

165
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:43,000
so that it can collect more tax revenues from them.

166
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The problem with the African continent

167
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and the problem with the aid industry

168
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:49,000
is that it has distorted the structure of incentives

169
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:52,000
facing the governments in Africa.

170
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The productive margin in our governments' search for revenue

171
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:58,000
does not lie in the domestic economy,

172
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:,000
it lies with international donors.

173
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Rather than sit with Ugandan --

174
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Applause) --

175
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:09,000
rather than sit with Ugandan entrepreneurs,

176
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Ghanaian businessmen, South African enterprising leaders,

177
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:18,000
our governments find it more productive

178
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:21,000
to talk to the IMF and the World Bank.

179
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I can tell you, even if you have ten Ph.Ds.,

180
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:3,000
you can never beat Bill Gates in understanding the computer industry.

181
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Why? Because the knowledge that is required for you to understand

182
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:36,000
the incentives necessary to expand a business --

183
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:42,000
it requires that you listen to the people, the private sector actors in that industry.

184
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Governments in Africa have therefore been given an opportunity,

185
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:48,000
by the international community, to avoid building

186
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
productive arrangements with your own citizens,

187
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and therefore allowed to begin endless negotiations with the IMF

188
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and the World Bank, and then it is the IMF and the World Bank

189
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that tell them what its citizens need.

190
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:05,000
In the process, we, the African people, have been sidelined

191
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:09,000
from the policy-making, policy-orientation, and policy-

192
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
implementation process in our countries.

193
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We have limited input, because he who pays the piper calls the tune.

194
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The IMF, the World Bank, and the cartel of good intentions in the world

195
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
has taken over our rights as citizens,

196
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and therefore what our governments are doing, because they depend on aid,

197
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:29,000
is to listen to international creditors rather than their own citizens.

198
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But I want to put a caveat on my argument,

199
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and that caveat is that it is not true that aid is always destructive.

200
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Some aid may have built a hospital, fed a hungry village.

201
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It may have built a road, and that road

202
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:5,000
may have served a very good role.

203
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:52,000
The mistake of the international aid industry

204
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:56,000
is to pick these isolated incidents of success,

205
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:01,000
generalize them, pour billions and trillions of dollars into them,

206
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and then spread them across the whole world,

207
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:08,000
ignoring the specific and unique circumstances in a given village,

208
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the skills, the practices, the norms and habits

209
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that allowed that small aid project to succeed --

210
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
like in Sauri village, in Kenya, where Jeffrey Sachs is working --

211
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and therefore generalize this experience

212
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:23,000
as the experience of everybody.

213
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Aid increases the resources available to governments,

214
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and that makes working in a government the most profitable thing

215
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:35,000
you can have, as a person in Africa seeking a career.

216
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:39,000
By increasing the political attractiveness of the state,

217
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:43,000
especially in our ethnically fragmented societies in Africa,

218
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:46,000
aid tends to accentuate ethnic tensions

219
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:52,000
as every single ethnic group now begins struggling to enter the state

220
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:55,000
in order to get access to the foreign aid pie.

221
0:12:55,000 --> 0:13:,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the most enterprising people in Africa

222
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:05,000
cannot find opportunities to trade and to work in the private sector

223
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:08,000
because the institutional and policy environment is hostile to business.

224
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Governments are not changing it. Why?

225
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Because they don't need to talk to their own citizens.

226
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:17,000
They talk to international donors.

227
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So, the most enterprising Africans end up going to work for government,

228
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and that has increased the political tensions in our countries

229
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
precisely because we depend on aid.

230
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I also want to say that it is important for us to

231
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:36,000
note that, over the last 50 years, Africa has been receiving increasing aid

232
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
from the international community,

233
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
in the form of technical assistance, and financial aid,

234
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and all other forms of aid.

235
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Between 1960 and 2003, our continent received 600 billion dollars of aid,

236
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and we are still told that there is a lot of poverty in Africa.

237
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Where has all the aid gone?

238
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I want to use the example of my own country, called Uganda,

239
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and the kind of structure of incentives that aid has brought there.

240
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:14,000
In the 2006-2007 budget, expected revenue: 2.5 trillion shillings.

241
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:17,000
The expected foreign aid: 1.9 trillion.

242
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Uganda's recurrent expenditure -- by recurrent what do I mean?

243
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Hand-to-mouth is 2.6 trillion.

244
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Why does the government of Uganda budget spend 110 percent

245
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:31,000
of its own revenue?

246
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:36,000
It's because there's somebody there called foreign aid, who contributes for it.

247
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:38,000
But this shows you that the government of Uganda

248
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:42,000
is not committed to spending its own revenue

249
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:44,000
to invest in productive investments,

250
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
but rather it devotes this revenue

251
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:5,000
to paying structure of public expenditure.

252
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Public administration, which is largely patronage, takes 690 billion.

253
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:57,000
The military, 380 billion.

254
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Agriculture, which employs 18 percent of our poverty-stricken citizens,

255
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:05,000
takes only 18 billion.

256
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Trade and industry takes 43 billion.

257
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And let me show you, what does public expenditure --

258
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:17,000
rather, public administration expenditure -- in Uganda constitute?

259
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:23,000
There you go. 70 cabinet ministers, 114 presidential advisers,

260
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:26,000
by the way, who never see the president, except on television.

261
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Laughter)

262
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Applause)

263
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And when they see him physically, it is at public functions like this,

264
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and even there, it is him who advises them.

265
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:45,000
(Laughter)

266
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:48,000
We have 81 units of local government.

267
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Each local government is organized like the central government --

268
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
a bureaucracy, a cabinet, a parliament,

269
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and so many jobs for the political hangers-on.

270
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:58,000
There were 56, and when our president wanted to

271
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:01,000
amend the constitution and remove term limits,

272
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:05,000
he had to create 25 new districts, and now there are 81.

273
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Three hundred thirty-three members of parliament.

274
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:09,000
You need Wembley Stadium to host our parliament.

275
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
One hundred thirty-four commissions

276
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and semi-autonomous government bodies,

277
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
all of which have directors and the cars. And the final thing,

278
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:24,000
this is addressed to Mr. Bono. In his work, he may help us on this.

279
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:26,000
A recent government of Uganda study found

280
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that there are 3,000 four-wheel drive motor vehicles

281
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:32,000
at the Minister of Health headquarters.

282
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Uganda has 961 sub-counties, each of them with a dispensary,

283
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:39,000
none of which has an ambulance.

284
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:42,000
So, the four-wheel drive vehicles at the headquarters

285
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:45,000
drive the ministers, the permanent secretaries, the bureaucrats

286
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and the international aid bureaucrats who work in aid projects,

287
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:54,000
while the poor die without ambulances and medicine.

288
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Finally, I want to say that before I came to speak here,

289
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I was told that the principle of TEDGlobal

290
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:05,000
is that the good speech should be like a miniskirt.

291
0:17:05,000 --> 0:17:07,000
It should be short enough to arouse interest,

292
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:09,000
but long enough to cover the subject.

293
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:1,000
I hope I have achieved that.

294
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:11,000
(Laughter)

295
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Thank you very much.

296
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:14,000
(Applause)

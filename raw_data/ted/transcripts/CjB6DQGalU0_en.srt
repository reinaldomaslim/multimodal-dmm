1
0:00:12.878,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The world is filled with incredible objects

2
0:00:16.427,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and rich cultural heritage.

3
0:00:19.283,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And when we get access to them,

4
0:00:21.443,000 --> 0:00:23,000
we are blown away, we fall in love.

5
0:00:24.652,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But most of the time,

6
0:00:26.273,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the world's population is living without real access to arts and culture.

7
0:00:31.946,000 --> 0:00:36,000
What might the connections be when we start exploring our heritage,

8
0:00:37.323,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the beautiful locations and the art in this world?

9
0:00:41.427,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Before we get started in this presentation,

10
0:00:44.225,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I just want to take care of a few housekeeping points.

11
0:00:47.651,000 --> 0:00:5,000
First, I am no expert in art or culture.

12
0:00:51.023,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I fell into this by mistake, but I'm loving it.

13
0:00:54.356,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Secondly, all of what I'm going to show you

14
0:00:57.376,000 --> 0:01:,000
belongs to the amazing museums, archives and foundations

15
0:01:01.365,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that we partner with.

16
0:01:02.815,000 --> 0:01:03,000
None of this belongs to Google.

17
0:01:05.235,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And finally, what you see behind me

18
0:01:08.448,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is available right now on your mobile phones,

19
0:01:11.823,000 --> 0:01:12,000
on your laptops.

20
0:01:13.021,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This is our current platform, where you can explore

21
0:01:15.449,000 --> 0:01:18,000
thousands of museums and objects at your fingertips,

22
0:01:18.884,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in extremely high-definition detail.

23
0:01:21.419,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The diversity of the content is what's amazing.

24
0:01:24.336,000 --> 0:01:26,000
If we just had European paintings,

25
0:01:26.529,000 --> 0:01:27,000
if we just had modern art,

26
0:01:28.284,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I think it gets a bit boring.

27
0:01:30.11,000 --> 0:01:33,000
For example, this month, we launched the "Black History" channel

28
0:01:33.993,000 --> 0:01:35,000
with 82 curated exhibitions,

29
0:01:36.606,000 --> 0:01:39,000
which talk about arts and culture in that community.

30
0:01:40.196,000 --> 0:01:43,000
We also have some amazing objects from Japan,

31
0:01:43.843,000 --> 0:01:47,000
centered around craftsmanship, called "Made in Japan."

32
0:01:47.971,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And one of my favorite exhibitions,

33
0:01:51.122,000 --> 0:01:53,000
which actually is the idea of my talk,

34
0:01:53.551,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is -- I didn't expect to become a fan of Japanese dolls.

35
0:01:57.438,000 --> 0:02:,000
But I am, thanks to this exhibition,

36
0:02:00.626,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that has really taught me about the craftsmanship

37
0:02:04.135,000 --> 0:02:06,000
behind the soul of a Japanese doll.

38
0:02:06.281,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Trust me, it's very exciting.

39
0:02:08.533,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Take my word for it.

40
0:02:09.905,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So, moving on swiftly.

41
0:02:11.938,000 --> 0:02:13,000
One quick thing I wanted to showcase in this platform,

42
0:02:14.794,000 --> 0:02:16,000
which you can share with your kids and your friends right now,

43
0:02:17.753,000 --> 0:02:21,000
is you can travel to all these amazing institutions virtually, as well.

44
0:02:22.033,000 --> 0:02:25,000
One of our recent ideas was with The Guggenheim Museum in New York,

45
0:02:25.643,000 --> 0:02:28,000
where you can get a taste of what it might feel like

46
0:02:29.025,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to actually be there.

47
0:02:30.2,000 --> 0:02:31,000
You can go to the ground floor

48
0:02:31.991,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and obviously, most of you, I assume, have been there.

49
0:02:34.704,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And you can see the architectural masterpiece that it is.

50
0:02:37.465,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But imagine this accessibility for a kid in Bombay

51
0:02:40.583,000 --> 0:02:41,000
who's studying architecture,

52
0:02:42.327,000 --> 0:02:45,000
who hasn't had a chance to go to The Guggenheim as yet.

53
0:02:45.406,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You can obviously look at objects in the Guggenheim Museum,

54
0:02:48.515,000 --> 0:02:5,000
you can obviously get into them and so on and so forth.

55
0:02:51.257,000 --> 0:02:52,000
There's a lot of information here.

56
0:02:53.156,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But this is not the purpose of my talk today.

57
0:02:57.543,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This exists right now.

58
0:02:59.333,000 --> 0:03:02,000
What we now have are the building blocks to a very exciting future,

59
0:03:03.283,000 --> 0:03:04,000
when it comes to arts and culture

60
0:03:05.022,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and accessibility to arts and culture.

61
0:03:07.657,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So I am joined today onstage by my good friend and artist in residence

62
0:03:12.149,000 --> 0:03:14,000
at our office in Paris, Cyril Diagne,

63
0:03:14.516,000 --> 0:03:16,000
who is the professor of interactive design

64
0:03:16.669,000 --> 0:03:18,000
at ECAL University in Lausanne, Switzerland.

65
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
What Cyril and our team of engineers have been doing

66
0:03:21.968,000 --> 0:03:24,000
is trying to find these connections and visualize a few of these.

67
0:03:25.127,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So I'm going to go quite quick now.

68
0:03:26.964,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This object you see behind me -- oh, just clarification:

69
0:03:30.59,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Always, seeing the real thing is better.

70
0:03:32.565,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In case people think I'm trying to replicate the real thing.

71
0:03:35.452,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So, moving on.

72
0:03:37.155,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This object you see behind me is the Venus of Berekhat Ram.

73
0:03:40.695,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It's one of the oldest objects in the world,

74
0:03:42.795,000 --> 0:03:45,000
found in the Golan Heights around 233,000 years ago,

75
0:03:45.993,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and currently residing at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem.

76
0:03:49.146,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It is also one of the oldest objects on our platform.

77
0:03:52.322,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So let's zoom.

78
0:03:53.692,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We start from this one object.

79
0:03:55.986,000 --> 0:03:57,000
What if we zoomed out

80
0:03:58.546,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and actually tried to experience our own cultural big bang?

81
0:04:03.076,000 --> 0:04:04,000
What might that look like?

82
0:04:05.474,000 --> 0:04:08,000
This is what we deal with on a daily basis at the Cultural Institute --

83
0:04:09.155,000 --> 0:04:13,000
over six million cultural artifacts curated and given to us by institutions,

84
0:04:14.141,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to actually make these connections.

85
0:04:16.111,000 --> 0:04:17,000
You can travel through time,

86
0:04:17.534,000 --> 0:04:2,000
you can understand more about our society through these.

87
0:04:21.069,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You can look at it from the perspective of our planet,

88
0:04:25.493,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and try to see how it might look without borders,

89
0:04:28.152,000 --> 0:04:3,000
if we just organized art and culture.

90
0:04:30.847,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We can also then plot it by time,

91
0:04:33.099,000 --> 0:04:37,000
which obviously, for the data geek in me, is very fascinating.

92
0:04:37.203,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You can spend hours looking at every decade

93
0:04:40.613,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and the contributions in that decade and in those years

94
0:04:43.953,000 --> 0:04:45,000
for art, history and cultures.

95
0:04:46.31,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We would love to spend hours showing you each and every decade,

96
0:04:49.713,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but we don't have the time right now.

97
0:04:51.598,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So you can go on your phone and actually do it yourself.

98
0:04:54.881,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Applause)

99
0:04:58.367,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But if you don't mind and can hold your applause till later,

100
0:05:01.493,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I don't want to run out of time,

101
0:05:03.065,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because I want to show you a lot of cool stuff.

102
0:05:05.288,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So, just very quickly:

103
0:05:06.812,000 --> 0:05:09,000
you can move on from here to another very interesting idea.

104
0:05:10.822,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Beyond the pretty picture,

105
0:05:12.557,000 --> 0:05:13,000
beyond the nice visualization,

106
0:05:14.37,000 --> 0:05:16,000
what is the purpose, how is this useful?

107
0:05:16.721,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This next idea comes from discussions with curators

108
0:05:21.474,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that we've been having at museums,

109
0:05:23.133,000 --> 0:05:25,000
who, by the way, I've fallen in love with,

110
0:05:25.18,000 --> 0:05:28,000
because they dedicate their whole life to try to tell these stories.

111
0:05:28.398,000 --> 0:05:3,000
One of the curators told me, "Amit, what would it be like

112
0:05:31.353,000 --> 0:05:33,000
if you could create a virtual curator's table

113
0:05:33.856,000 --> 0:05:35,000
where all these six million objects

114
0:05:36.183,000 --> 0:05:4,000
are displayed in a way for us to look at the connections between them?"

115
0:05:40.61,000 --> 0:05:44,000
You can spend a lot of time, trust me, looking at different objects

116
0:05:44.663,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and understanding where they come from.

117
0:05:46.64,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It's a crazy Matrix experience.

118
0:05:48.872,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:49.91,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Just moving on,

120
0:05:51.22,000 --> 0:05:54,000
let's take the world-famous Vincent Van Gogh,

121
0:05:54.415,000 --> 0:05:57,000
who is very well-represented on this platform.

122
0:05:58.154,000 --> 0:06:,000
Thanks to the diversity of the institutions we have,

123
0:06:00.954,000 --> 0:06:05,000
we have over 211 high-definition, amazing artworks by this artist,

124
0:06:06.682,000 --> 0:06:09,000
now organized in one beautiful view.

125
0:06:10.453,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And as it resolves, and as Cyril goes deeper,

126
0:06:13.45,000 --> 0:06:15,000
you can see all the self-portraits,

127
0:06:15.683,000 --> 0:06:16,000
you can see still life.

128
0:06:17.132,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But I just wanted to highlight one very quick example,

129
0:06:19.759,000 --> 0:06:2,000
which is very timely:

130
0:06:21.471,000 --> 0:06:22,000
"The Bedroom."

131
0:06:22.806,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This is an artwork where three copies exist --

132
0:06:25.131,000 --> 0:06:27,000
one at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam,

133
0:06:27.485,000 --> 0:06:28,000
one at the Orsay in Paris

134
0:06:29.496,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and one at the Art Institute of Chicago,

135
0:06:31.454,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which, actually, currently is hosting a reunion

136
0:06:33.981,000 --> 0:06:34,000
of all three artworks physically,

137
0:06:35.78,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I think only for the second time ever.

138
0:06:37.941,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But, it is united digitally and virtually for anybody to look at

139
0:06:42.884,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in a very different way,

140
0:06:44.829,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and you won't get pushed in the line in the crowd.

141
0:06:47.886,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So let's take you and let's travel through "The Bedroom" very quickly,

142
0:06:52.652,000 --> 0:06:55,000
so you can experience what we are doing for every single object.

143
0:06:56.263,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We want the image to speak as much as it can

144
0:06:59.738,000 --> 0:07:,000
on a digital platform.

145
0:07:01.406,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And all you need is an internet connection and a computer

146
0:07:04.577,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Applause)

147
0:07:08.939,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And, Cyril, if you can go deeper, quickly.

148
0:07:11.521,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I'm sorry, this is all live,

149
0:07:13.029,000 --> 0:07:15,000
so you have to give Cyril a little bit of --

150
0:07:16.401,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and this is available for every object:

151
0:07:18.485,000 --> 0:07:2,000
modern art, contemporary art, Renaissance -- you name it,

152
0:07:21.224,000 --> 0:07:22,000
even sculpture.

153
0:07:23.802,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Sometimes, you don't know what can attract you

154
0:07:27.421,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to an artwork or to a museum or to a cultural discovery.

155
0:07:32.673,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So for me, personally, it was quite a challenge

156
0:07:35.439,000 --> 0:07:38,000
because when I decided to make this my full-time job at Google,

157
0:07:38.685,000 --> 0:07:4,000
my mother was not very supportive.

158
0:07:41.312,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I love my mother,

159
0:07:42.583,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but she thought I was wasting my life with this museum stuff.

160
0:07:45.606,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And for her, a museum is what you do when you go on vacation

161
0:07:48.942,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and you tick-mark and it's over, right?

162
0:07:50.933,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And it took around four and a half years

163
0:07:53.488,000 --> 0:07:55,000
for me to convince my lovely Indian mother

164
0:07:55.726,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that actually, this is worthwhile.

165
0:07:57.403,000 --> 0:08:,000
And the way I did it was, I realized one day that she loves gold.

166
0:08:00.868,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So I started showing her all objects that have the material gold in them.

167
0:08:06.467,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And the first thing my mom asks me is,

168
0:08:09.142,000 --> 0:08:11,000
"How can we buy these?"

169
0:08:11.594,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

170
0:08:13.436,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And obviously, my salary is not that high,

171
0:08:16.602,000 --> 0:08:18,000
so I was like, "We can't actually do that, mom.

172
0:08:19.004,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But you can explore them virtually."

173
0:08:21.139,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And so now my mom -- every time I meet her, she asks me,

174
0:08:24.582,000 --> 0:08:27,000
"Any more gold, any more silver in your project? Can you show me?"

175
0:08:28.072,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And that's the idea I'm trying to illustrate.

176
0:08:30.27,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It does not matter how you get in,

177
0:08:32.432,000 --> 0:08:33,000
as long as you get in.

178
0:08:33.818,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Once you get in, you're hooked.

179
0:08:35.452,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Moving on from here very quickly,

180
0:08:37.825,000 --> 0:08:39,000
there is kind of a playful idea, actually,

181
0:08:40.698,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to illustrate the point of access,

182
0:08:42.357,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and I'm going to go quite quickly on this one.

183
0:08:44.803,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We all know that seeing the artwork in person is amazing.

184
0:08:50.234,000 --> 0:08:52,000
But we also know that most of us can't do it,

185
0:08:52.841,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and the ones that can afford to do it, it's complicated.

186
0:08:55.623,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So -- Cyril, can we load up our art trip, what do we call it?

187
0:08:59.454,000 --> 0:09:,000
We don't have a good name for this.

188
0:09:01.24,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But essentially, we have around 1,000 amazing institutions,

189
0:09:06.235,000 --> 0:09:07,000
68 countries.

190
0:09:07.426,000 --> 0:09:08,000
But let's start with Rembrandt.

191
0:09:09.15,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We might have time for only one example.

192
0:09:11.416,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But thanks to the diversity,

193
0:09:13.669,000 --> 0:09:16,000
we've got around 500 amazing Rembrandt object artworks

194
0:09:17.597,000 --> 0:09:19,000
from 46 institutions and 17 countries.

195
0:09:19.89,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Let's say that on your next vacation,

196
0:09:22.466,000 --> 0:09:24,000
you want to go see every single one of them.

197
0:09:24.54,000 --> 0:09:25,000
That is your itinerary,

198
0:09:25.898,000 --> 0:09:28,000
you will probably travel 53,000 kilometers,

199
0:09:29.576,000 --> 0:09:31,000
visit around, I think, 46 institutions,

200
0:09:32.187,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and just FYI, you might release 10 tons of CO2 emissions.

201
0:09:36.402,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

202
0:09:37.889,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But remember, it's art,

203
0:09:39.386,000 --> 0:09:41,000
so you can justify it, perhaps, in some way.

204
0:09:42.837,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Moving on swiftly from here,

205
0:09:44.783,000 --> 0:09:46,000
is something a little bit more technical and more interesting.

206
0:09:47.742,000 --> 0:09:51,000
All that we've shown you so far uses metadata to make the connections.

207
0:09:52.703,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But obviously we have something cool nowadays

208
0:09:54.837,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that everyone likes to talk about, which is machine learning.

209
0:09:57.773,000 --> 0:10:,000
So what we thought is, let's strip out all the metadata,

210
0:10:00.871,000 --> 0:10:03,000
let's look at what machine learning can do

211
0:10:04.507,000 --> 0:10:08,000
based purely on visual recognition of this entire collection.

212
0:10:08.854,000 --> 0:10:12,000
What we ended up with is this very interesting map,

213
0:10:13.071,000 --> 0:10:17,000
these clusters that have no reference point information,

214
0:10:17.405,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but has just used visuals to cluster things together.

215
0:10:21.394,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Each cluster is an art to us by itself of discovery.

216
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But one of the clusters we want to show you very quickly

217
0:10:27.687,000 --> 0:10:29,000
is this amazing cluster of portraits

218
0:10:30.363,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that we found from museums around the world.

219
0:10:32.789,000 --> 0:10:34,000
If you could zoom in a little bit more, Cyril.

220
0:10:34.996,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Just to show you, you can just travel through portraits.

221
0:10:38.852,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And essentially, you can do nature, you can do horses

222
0:10:41.65,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and clusters galore.

223
0:10:44.309,000 --> 0:10:45,000
When we saw all these portraits,

224
0:10:45.881,000 --> 0:10:48,000
we were like, "Hey, can we do something fun for kids,

225
0:10:49.557,000 --> 0:10:5,000
or can we do something playful

226
0:10:51.263,000 --> 0:10:53,000
to get people interested in portraits?"

227
0:10:53.312,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Because I haven't really seen

228
0:10:55.516,000 --> 0:10:58,000
young kids really excited to go to a portrait gallery.

229
0:10:59.357,000 --> 0:11:,000
I wanted to try to figure something out.

230
0:11:01.313,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So we created something called the portrait matcher.

231
0:11:03.804,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It's quite self-explanatory,

232
0:11:05.145,000 --> 0:11:07,000
so I'm just going to let Cyril show his beautiful face.

233
0:11:07.907,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And essentially what's happening is, with the movement of his head,

234
0:11:12.063,000 --> 0:11:16,000
we are matching different portraits around the world from museums.

235
0:11:16.254,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Applause)

236
0:11:29.445,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And I don't know about you,

237
0:11:31.175,000 --> 0:11:33,000
but I've shown it to my nephew and sister,

238
0:11:33.215,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and the reaction is just phenomenal.

239
0:11:35.088,000 --> 0:11:37,000
All they ask me is, "When can we go see this?"

240
0:11:39.492,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And by the way, if we're nice,

241
0:11:41.089,000 --> 0:11:43,000
maybe, Cyril, you can smile and find a happy one?

242
0:11:44.696,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Oh, perfect.

243
0:11:46.118,000 --> 0:11:47,000
By the way, this is not rehearsed.

244
0:11:48.474,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Congrats, Cyril. Great stuff. Oh wow.

245
0:11:51.078,000 --> 0:11:54,000
OK, let's move on; otherwise, this will just take the whole time.

246
0:11:54.578,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Applause)

247
0:11:56.32,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So, art and culture can be fun also, right?

248
0:11:59.9,000 --> 0:12:02,000
For our last quick experiment --

249
0:12:03.321,000 --> 0:12:04,000
we call all of these "experiments" --

250
0:12:05.108,000 --> 0:12:07,000
our last quick experiment comes back to machine learning.

251
0:12:08.021,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We show you clusters, visual clusters,

252
0:12:10.886,000 --> 0:12:14,000
but what if we could ask the machine to also name these clusters?

253
0:12:15.811,000 --> 0:12:19,000
What if it could automatically tag them, using no actual metadata?

254
0:12:20.588,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So what we have is this kind of explorer,

255
0:12:24.712,000 --> 0:12:27,000
where we have managed to match, I think, around 4,000 labels.

256
0:12:28.347,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And we haven't really done anything special here,

257
0:12:31.535,000 --> 0:12:32,000
just fed the collection.

258
0:12:33.217,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And we found interesting categories.

259
0:12:35.011,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We can start with horses, a very straightforward category.

260
0:12:37.94,000 --> 0:12:39,000
You would expect to see that the machine has put

261
0:12:40.263,000 --> 0:12:41,000
images of horses, right?

262
0:12:42.028,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And it has, but you also notice, right over there,

263
0:12:45.494,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that it has a very abstract image

264
0:12:47.597,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that it has still managed to recognize and cluster as horses.

265
0:12:50.816,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We also have an amazing head in terms of a horse.

266
0:12:54.53,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And each one has the tags as to why it got categorized in this.

267
0:12:58.556,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So let's move to another one which I found very funny and interesting,

268
0:13:02.554,000 --> 0:13:04,000
because I don't understand how this category came up.

269
0:13:05.069,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It's called "Lady in Waiting."

270
0:13:06.843,000 --> 0:13:08,000
If, Cyril, you do it very quickly,

271
0:13:09.479,000 --> 0:13:12,000
you will see that we have these amazing images

272
0:13:13.045,000 --> 0:13:15,000
of ladies, I guess, in waiting or posing.

273
0:13:15.83,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I don't really understand it.

274
0:13:17.3,000 --> 0:13:19,000
But I've been trying to ask my museum contacts,

275
0:13:19.564,000 --> 0:13:21,000
you know, "What is this? What's going on here?"

276
0:13:21.833,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And it's fascinating.

277
0:13:23.469,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Coming back to gold very quickly,

278
0:13:26.182,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I wanted to search for gold

279
0:13:27.769,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and see how the machine tagged all the gold.

280
0:13:29.895,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But, actually, it doesn't tag it as gold.

281
0:13:32.32,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We are living in popular times.

282
0:13:33.859,000 --> 0:13:35,000
It tags it as "bling-bling."

283
0:13:35.986,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Laughter)

284
0:13:39.2,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I'm being hard on Cyril, because I'm moving too fast.

285
0:13:42.145,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Essentially, here you have all the bling-bling

286
0:13:44.796,000 --> 0:13:47,000
of the world's museums organized for you.

287
0:13:47.981,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And finally, to end this talk and these experiments,

288
0:13:51.521,000 --> 0:13:54,000
what I hope you feel after this talk is happiness and emotion.

289
0:13:54.862,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And what would we see when we see happiness?

290
0:13:57.325,000 --> 0:14:,000
If we actually look at all the objects

291
0:14:00.508,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that have been tagged under "happiness,"

292
0:14:02.476,000 --> 0:14:05,000
you would expect happiness, I guess.

293
0:14:05.564,000 --> 0:14:11,000
But there was one that came up that was very fascinating and interesting,

294
0:14:11.691,000 --> 0:14:15,000
which was this artwork by Douglas Coupland,

295
0:14:16.09,000 --> 0:14:18,000
our friend and artist in residence as well,

296
0:14:18.209,000 --> 0:14:2,000
called, "I Miss My Pre-Internet Brain."

297
0:14:20.494,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I don't know why the machine feels like it misses its pre-Internet brain

298
0:14:24.133,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and it's been tagged here,

299
0:14:25.427,000 --> 0:14:26,000
but it's a very interesting thought.

300
0:14:27.365,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I sometimes do miss my pre-Internet brain,

301
0:14:29.572,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but not when it comes to exploring arts and culture online.

302
0:14:32.596,000 --> 0:14:34,000
So take out your phones, take out your computers,

303
0:14:34.933,000 --> 0:14:35,000
go visit museums.

304
0:14:36.114,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And just a quick call-out to all the amazing archivists,

305
0:14:38.817,000 --> 0:14:39,000
historians, curators,

306
0:14:40.225,000 --> 0:14:42,000
who are sitting in museums, preserving all this culture.

307
0:14:43.021,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And the least we can do is get our daily dose of art and culture

308
0:14:46.363,000 --> 0:14:47,000
for ourselves and our kids.

309
0:14:47.718,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Thank you.

310
0:14:48.895,000 --> 0:14:58,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.396,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is an ambucycle.

2
0:00:15.373,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency.

3
0:00:20.412,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It has everything an ambulance has except for a bed.

4
0:00:24.914,000 --> 0:00:27,000
You see the defibrillator. You see the equipment.

5
0:00:28.67,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We all saw the tragedy that happened in Boston.

6
0:00:31.836,000 --> 0:00:33,000
When I was looking at these pictures,

7
0:00:33.916,000 --> 0:00:35,000
it brought me back many years to my past

8
0:00:36.906,000 --> 0:00:37,000
when I was a child.

9
0:00:38.476,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem.

10
0:00:41.554,000 --> 0:00:45,000
When I was six years old, I was walking back from school

11
0:00:45.645,000 --> 0:00:48,000
on a Friday afternoon with my older brother.

12
0:00:49.38,000 --> 0:00:51,000
We were passing by a bus stop.

13
0:00:51.632,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes.

14
0:00:55.675,000 --> 0:01:,000
The bus was on fire, and many people were hurt and killed.

15
0:01:00.72,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I remembered an old man

16
0:01:02.652,000 --> 0:01:05,000
yelling to us and crying to help us get him up.

17
0:01:06.12,000 --> 0:01:08,000
He just needed someone helping him.

18
0:01:08.583,000 --> 0:01:11,000
We were so scared and we just ran away.

19
0:01:12.117,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Growing up, I decided I wanted to become a doctor and save lives.

20
0:01:15.907,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Maybe that was because of what I saw when I was a child.

21
0:01:18.908,000 --> 0:01:21,000
When I was 15, I took an EMT course,

22
0:01:22.2,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and I went to volunteer on an ambulance.

23
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
For two years, I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem.

24
0:01:28.677,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I helped many people,

25
0:01:30.529,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but whenever someone really needed help,

26
0:01:33.444,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I never got there in time. We never got there.

27
0:01:35.786,000 --> 0:01:37,000
The traffic is so bad. The distance, and everything.

28
0:01:38.295,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We never got there when somebody really needed us.

29
0:01:41.12,000 --> 0:01:43,000
One day, we received a call about a seven-year-old child

30
0:01:43.811,000 --> 0:01:44,000
choking from a hot dog.

31
0:01:45.394,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Traffic was horrific, and we were coming from

32
0:01:47.561,000 --> 0:01:5,000
the other side of town in the north part of Jerusalem.

33
0:01:51.172,000 --> 0:01:53,000
When we got there, 20 minutes later,

34
0:01:53.458,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we started CPR on the kid.

35
0:01:55.976,000 --> 0:01:58,000
A doctor comes in from a block away,

36
0:01:59.46,000 --> 0:02:04,000
stop us, checks the kid, and tells us to stop CPR.

37
0:02:04.656,000 --> 0:02:07,000
That second he declared this child dead.

38
0:02:08.413,000 --> 0:02:1,000
At that moment, I understood

39
0:02:11.41,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that this child died for nothing.

40
0:02:14.281,000 --> 0:02:17,000
If this doctor, who lived one block away from there,

41
0:02:17.836,000 --> 0:02:18,000
would have come 20 minutes earlier,

42
0:02:19.527,000 --> 0:02:22,000
not have to wait until that siren he heard before

43
0:02:22.553,000 --> 0:02:23,000
coming from the ambulance,

44
0:02:23.839,000 --> 0:02:25,000
if he would have heard about it way before,

45
0:02:26.773,000 --> 0:02:27,000
he would have saved this child.

46
0:02:28.506,000 --> 0:02:3,000
He could have run from a block away.

47
0:02:30.637,000 --> 0:02:31,000
He could have saved this child.

48
0:02:32.324,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I said to myself, there must be a better way.

49
0:02:35.009,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Together with 15 of my friends --

50
0:02:36.958,000 --> 0:02:37,000
we were all EMTs —

51
0:02:38.729,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we decided, let's protect our neighborhood,

52
0:02:40.801,000 --> 0:02:42,000
so when something like that happens again,

53
0:02:42.825,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we will be there running to the scene a lot before the ambulance.

54
0:02:46.239,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So I went over to the manager of the ambulance company

55
0:02:49.212,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and I told him, "Please, whenever you have a call

56
0:02:51.57,000 --> 0:02:52,000
coming into our neighborhood,

57
0:02:53.231,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we have 15 great guys who are willing

58
0:02:55.136,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to stop everything they're doing and run and save lives.

59
0:02:57.827,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Just alert us by beeper.

60
0:02:59.255,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We'll buy these beepers, just tell your dispatch

61
0:03:01.596,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to send us the beeper, and we will run and save lives."

62
0:03:05.507,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Well, he was laughing. I was 17 years old. I was a kid.

63
0:03:12.484,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And he said to me — I remember this like yesterday —

64
0:03:15.87,000 --> 0:03:17,000
he was a great guy, but he said to me,

65
0:03:18.227,000 --> 0:03:22,000
"Kid, go to school, or go open a falafel stand.

66
0:03:22.663,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We're not really interested in these kinds of new adventures.

67
0:03:26.664,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We're not interested in your help." And he threw me out of the room.

68
0:03:30.279,000 --> 0:03:32,000
"I don't need your help," he said.

69
0:03:32.938,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I was a very stubborn kid.

70
0:03:36.517,000 --> 0:03:39,000
As you see now, I'm walking around like crazy, meshugenah.

71
0:03:39.935,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

72
0:03:44.907,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So I decided to use the Israeli very famous technique

73
0:03:48.96,000 --> 0:03:51,000
you've probably all heard of, chutzpah. (Laughter)

74
0:03:52.615,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And the next day, I went and I bought two police scanners,

75
0:03:57.299,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and I said, "The hell with you, if you don't want

76
0:03:58.913,000 --> 0:04:,000
to give me information, I'll get the information myself."

77
0:04:01.864,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And we did turns, who's going to listen to the radio scanners.

78
0:04:05.129,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The next day, while I was listening to the scanners,

79
0:04:07.898,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I heard about a call coming in of a 70-year-old man

80
0:04:11.214,000 --> 0:04:14,000
hurt by a car only one block away from me

81
0:04:14.824,000 --> 0:04:16,000
on the main street of my neighborhood.

82
0:04:17.515,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I ran there by foot. I had no medical equipment.

83
0:04:20.218,000 --> 0:04:22,000
When I got there, the 70-year-old man

84
0:04:23.168,000 --> 0:04:25,000
was lying on the floor, blood was gushing out of his neck.

85
0:04:26.082,000 --> 0:04:27,000
He was on Coumadin.

86
0:04:27.295,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I knew I had to stop his bleeding or else he would die.

87
0:04:32.289,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I took off my yarmulke, because I had no medical equipment,

88
0:04:35.232,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and with a lot of pressure, I stopped his bleeding.

89
0:04:37.685,000 --> 0:04:38,000
He was bleeding from his neck.

90
0:04:39.2,000 --> 0:04:42,000
When the ambulance arrived 15 minutes later,

91
0:04:42.657,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I gave them over a patient who was alive.

92
0:04:45.244,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Applause)

93
0:04:53.224,000 --> 0:04:55,000
When I went to visit him two days later,

94
0:04:55.386,000 --> 0:04:57,000
he gave me a hug and was crying

95
0:04:57.721,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and thanking me for saving his life.

96
0:05:00.743,000 --> 0:05:02,000
At that moment, when I realized this is the first person

97
0:05:03.764,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I ever saved in my life after two years volunteering in an ambulance,

98
0:05:07.074,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I knew this is my life's mission.

99
0:05:09.766,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So today, 22 years later, we have United Hatzalah.

100
0:05:13.931,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Applause)

101
0:05:20.321,000 --> 0:05:23,000
"Hatzalah" means "rescue," for all of you who don't know Hebrew.

102
0:05:23.393,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I forgot I'm not in Israel.

103
0:05:25.345,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So we have thousands of volunteers

104
0:05:28.28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
who are passionate about saving lives,

105
0:05:31.199,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and they're spread all around, so whenever a call comes in,

106
0:05:34.033,000 --> 0:05:38,000
they just stop everything and go and run and save a life.

107
0:05:38.429,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Our average response time today

108
0:05:40.986,000 --> 0:05:43,000
went down to less than three minutes in Israel.

109
0:05:44.7,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Applause)

110
0:05:48.346,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I'm talking about heart attacks,

111
0:05:49.894,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I'm talking about car accidents,

112
0:05:51.526,000 --> 0:05:53,000
God forbid bomb attacks, shootings, whatever it is,

113
0:05:54.4,000 --> 0:05:55,000
even a woman 3 o'clock in the morning

114
0:05:56.339,000 --> 0:05:58,000
falling in her home and needs someone to help her.

115
0:05:58.744,000 --> 0:06:,000
Three minutes, we'll have a guy with his pajamas

116
0:06:01.108,000 --> 0:06:04,000
running to her house and helping her get up.

117
0:06:04.757,000 --> 0:06:07,000
The reasons why we're so successful are because of three things.

118
0:06:07.829,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Thousands of passionate volunteers

119
0:06:09.651,000 --> 0:06:1,000
who will leave everything they do

120
0:06:11.371,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and run to help people they don't even know.

121
0:06:14.282,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We're not there to replace ambulances.

122
0:06:16.625,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We're just there

123
0:06:18.229,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive.

124
0:06:24.279,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And we save people that otherwise would not be saved.

125
0:06:29.166,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The second reason is because of our technology.

126
0:06:32.525,000 --> 0:06:34,000
You know, Israelis are good in technology.

127
0:06:34.549,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Every one of us has on his phone, no matter what kind of phone,

128
0:06:37.782,000 --> 0:06:4,000
a GPS technology done by NowForce,

129
0:06:40.858,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and whenever a call comes in,

130
0:06:42.305,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the closest five volunteers get the call,

131
0:06:44.48,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and they actually get there really quick,

132
0:06:47.378,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and navigated by a traffic navigator to get there and not waste time.

133
0:06:51.102,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And this is a great technology we use all over the country

134
0:06:53.301,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and reduce the response time.

135
0:06:54.891,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And the third thing are these ambucycles.

136
0:06:57.027,000 --> 0:07:,000
These ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels.

137
0:07:00.336,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We don't transfer people, but we stabilize them,

138
0:07:02.646,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and we save their lives.

139
0:07:03.887,000 --> 0:07:06,000
They never get stuck in traffic. They could even go on a sidewalk.

140
0:07:07.054,000 --> 0:07:09,000
They never, literally, get stuck in traffic.

141
0:07:09.419,000 --> 0:07:1,000
That's why we get there so fast.

142
0:07:11.224,000 --> 0:07:13,000
A few years after I started this organization,

143
0:07:13.706,000 --> 0:07:14,000
in a Jewish community,

144
0:07:15.451,000 --> 0:07:17,000
two Muslims from east Jerusalem called me up.

145
0:07:18.254,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They ask me to meet. They wanted to meet with me.

146
0:07:20.952,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan.

147
0:07:23.443,000 --> 0:07:24,000
When Muhammad told me his personal story,

148
0:07:25.42,000 --> 0:07:27,000
how his father, 55 years old, collapsed at home,

149
0:07:28.275,000 --> 0:07:29,000
had a cardiac arrest,

150
0:07:29.531,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive,

151
0:07:31.951,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and he saw his father die in front of his eyes,

152
0:07:34.214,000 --> 0:07:36,000
he asked me, "Please start this in east Jerusalem."

153
0:07:37.009,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I said to myself, I saw so much tragedy, so much hate,

154
0:07:40.834,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and it's not about saving Jews. It's not about saving Muslims.

155
0:07:44.118,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It's not about saving Christians. It's about saving people.

156
0:07:47.69,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So I went ahead, full force --

157
0:07:50.103,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Applause) —

158
0:07:54.694,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and I started United Hatzalah in east Jerusalem,

159
0:07:58.361,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and that's why the names United

160
0:08:00.18,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and Hatzalah match so well.

161
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs.

162
0:08:06.112,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Arabs were saving Jews. Jews were saving Arabs.

163
0:08:08.375,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Something special happened.

164
0:08:10.376,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Arabs and Jews, they don't always get along together,

165
0:08:13.041,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but here in this situation,

166
0:08:14.351,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the communities, literally,

167
0:08:16.144,000 --> 0:08:18,000
it's an unbelievable situation that happened,

168
0:08:18.311,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the diversities, all of a sudden they had a common interest:

169
0:08:20.905,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Let's save lives together.

170
0:08:22.347,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Settlers were saving Arabs and Arabs were saving settlers.

171
0:08:25.133,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's an unbelievable concept that could work

172
0:08:27.253,000 --> 0:08:29,000
only when you have such a great cause.

173
0:08:30.008,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And these are all volunteers.

174
0:08:31.881,000 --> 0:08:32,000
No one is getting money.

175
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
They're all doing it for the purpose of saving lives.

176
0:08:36.876,000 --> 0:08:38,000
When my own father collapsed a few years ago

177
0:08:39.161,000 --> 0:08:41,000
from a cardiac arrest, one of the first volunteers

178
0:08:41.566,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to arrive to save my father

179
0:08:43.331,000 --> 0:08:45,000
was one of these Muslim volunteers from east Jerusalem

180
0:08:45.927,000 --> 0:08:48,000
who was in the first course to join Hatzalah.

181
0:08:49.472,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And he saved my father.

182
0:08:50.549,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Could you imagine how I felt in that moment?

183
0:08:55.056,000 --> 0:08:58,000
When I started this organization, I was 17 years old.

184
0:08:58.165,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I never imagined that one day I'd be speaking at TEDMED.

185
0:09:01.575,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I never even knew what TEDMED was then.

186
0:09:03.457,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I don't think it existed, but I never imagined,

187
0:09:06.601,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I never imagined that it's going to go all around,

188
0:09:09.006,000 --> 0:09:1,000
it's going to spread around,

189
0:09:10.088,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and this last year we started in Panama and Brazil.

190
0:09:13.156,000 --> 0:09:16,000
All I need is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me,

191
0:09:16.538,000 --> 0:09:19,000
passionate about saving lives, and willing to do it.

192
0:09:19.928,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And I'm actually starting it in India very soon

193
0:09:23.437,000 --> 0:09:26,000
with a friend who I met in Harvard just a while back.

194
0:09:27.09,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Hatzalah actually started in Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew

195
0:09:30.958,000 --> 0:09:32,000
years before us in Williamsburg,

196
0:09:33.236,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and now it's all over the Jewish community in New York,

197
0:09:35.959,000 --> 0:09:38,000
even Australia and Mexico and many other Jewish communities.

198
0:09:39.219,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But it could spread everywhere.

199
0:09:40.813,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It's very easy to adopt.

200
0:09:43.369,000 --> 0:09:45,000
You even saw these volunteers in New York

201
0:09:45.645,000 --> 0:09:48,000
saving lives in the World Trade Center.

202
0:09:48.761,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Last year alone, we treated in Israel 207,000 people.

203
0:09:52.306,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Forty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations.

204
0:09:57.029,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And we made a difference.

205
0:09:59.206,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob,

206
0:10:01.954,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and it works.

207
0:10:04.377,000 --> 0:10:06,000
When I look all around here,

208
0:10:06.824,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I see lots of people who would go an extra mile,

209
0:10:10.215,000 --> 0:10:12,000
run an extra mile to save other people,

210
0:10:12.936,000 --> 0:10:14,000
no matter who they are, no matter what religion,

211
0:10:15.673,000 --> 0:10:17,000
no matter who, where they come from.

212
0:10:18.589,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We all want to be heroes.

213
0:10:20.374,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We just need a good idea, motivation

214
0:10:23.76,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and lots of chutzpah,

215
0:10:25.595,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and we could save millions of people

216
0:10:27.76,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that otherwise would not be saved.

217
0:10:29.932,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Thank you very much.

218
0:10:31.617,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Applause)

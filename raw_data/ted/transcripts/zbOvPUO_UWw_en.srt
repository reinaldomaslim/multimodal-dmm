1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Good afternoon, good evening, whatever.

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
We can go, jambo, guten Abend, bonsoir,

3
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but we can also ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

4
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
That is the call that chimpanzees make

5
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
before they go to sleep in the evening.

6
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You hear it going from one side of the valley to the other,

7
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
from one group of nests to the next.

8
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I want to pick up with my talk this evening

9
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
from where Zeray left off yesterday.

10
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
He was talking about this amazing, three-year-old Australopithecine child, Selam.

11
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And we've also been hearing about the history, the family tree, of mankind

12
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
through DNA genetic profiling.

13
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And it was a paleontologist, the late Louis Leakey,

14
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who actually set me on the path for studying chimpanzees.

15
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And it was pretty extraordinary, way back then.

16
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It's kind of commonplace now,

17
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but his argument was -- because he'd been searching

18
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
for the fossilized remains of early humans in Africa.

19
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And you can tell an awful lot

20
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
about what those beings looked like from the fossils,

21
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
from the shape of the muscle attachments,

22
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
something about the way they lived

23
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
from the various artifacts found with them.

24
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But what about how they behaved? That's what he wanted to know.

25
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And of course, behavior doesn't fossilize.

26
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
He argued -- and it's now a fairly common theory --

27
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that if we found behavior patterns similar or the same

28
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in our closest living relatives, the great apes, and humans today,

29
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
then maybe those behaviors were present in the ape-like,

30
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
human-like ancestor some seven million years ago.

31
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And therefore, perhaps we had brought those characteristics with us

32
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
from that ancient, ancient past.

33
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Well, if you look in textbooks today that deal with human evolution,

34
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
you very often find people speculating about how early humans

35
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
may have behaved, based on the behavior of chimpanzees.

36
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They are more like us than any other living creature,

37
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and we've heard about that during this TED Conference.

38
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So it remains for me to comment on the ways in which chimpanzees

39
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
are so like us, in certain aspects of their behavior.

40
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
Every chimpanzee has his or her own personality.

41
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Of course, I gave them names. They can live to be 60 years or more,

42
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
although we think most of them probably don't make it to 60 in the wild.

43
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Mr. Wurzel. The female has her first baby when she's 11 or 12.

44
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Thereafter, she has one baby only every five or six years,

45
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
a long period of childhood dependency when the child is nursing,

46
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
sleeping with the mother at night, and riding on her back.

47
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And we believe that this long period of childhood

48
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is important for chimpanzees, just as it is for us, in relation to learning.

49
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
As the brain becomes ever more complex

50
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
during evolution in different forms of animals,

51
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
so we find that learning plays an ever more important role

52
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in an individual's life history.

53
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And young chimpanzees spend a lot of time watching what their elders do.

54
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We know now that they're capable of imitating behaviors that they see.

55
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And we believe that it's in this way

56
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that the different tool-using behaviors -- that have now been seen

57
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in all the different chimpanzee populations studied in Africa --

58
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
how these are passed from one generation to the next,

59
0:04:11.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
through observation, imitation and practice,

60
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
so that we can describe these tool-using behaviors as primitive culture.

61
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Chimpanzees don't have a spoken language. We've talked about that.

62
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They do have a very rich repertoire of postures and gestures,

63
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
many of which are similar, or even identical, to ours

64
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and formed in the same context. Greeting chimpanzees embracing.

65
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They also kiss, hold hands, pat one another on the back.

66
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And they swagger and they throw rocks.

67
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
In chimpanzee society, we find many, many examples of compassion,

68
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
precursors to love and true altruism.

69
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Unfortunately, they, like us, have a dark side to their nature.

70
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
They're capable of extreme brutality, even a kind of primitive war.

71
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And these really aggressive behaviors, for the most part,

72
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
are directed against individuals of the neighboring social group.

73
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They are very territorially aggressive.

74
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Chimpanzees, I believe, more than any other living creature,

75
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
have helped us to understand that, after all, there is no sharp line

76
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
between humans and the rest of the animal kingdom.

77
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It's a very blurry line, and it's getting more blurry all the time

78
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:3,000
as we make even more observations.

79
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The study that I began in 1960 is still continuing to this day.

80
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And these chimpanzees, living their complex social lives in the wild,

81
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
have helped -- more than anything else --

82
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to make us realize we are part of, and not separated from,

83
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the amazing animals with whom we share the planet.

84
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So it's pretty sad to find that chimpanzees,

85
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
like so many other creatures around the world, are losing their habitats.

86
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
This is just one photograph from the air,

87
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and it shows you the forested highlands of Gombe.

88
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And it was when I flew over the whole area, about 16 years ago,

89
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and realized that outside the park, this forest,

90
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
which in 1960 had stretched almost unbroken

91
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
along the eastern shore of Lake Tanganyika,

92
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
which is where the tiny, 30-square-mile Gombe National Park lies,

93
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that a question came to my mind.

94
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"How can we even try to save these famous chimpanzees,

95
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
when the people living around the National Park are struggling to survive?"

96
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
More people are living there than the land could possibly support.

97
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The numbers increased by refugees pouring in from Burundi

98
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and over the lake from Congo.

99
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And very poor people -- they couldn't afford to buy food from elsewhere.

100
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:55,000
This led to a program, which we call TACARE.

101
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
It's a very holistic way of improving the lives

102
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
of the people living in the villages around the park.

103
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It started small with 12 villages. It's now in 24.

104
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
There isn't time to go into it, but it's including things like tree nurseries,

105
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
methods of farming most suitable to this now very degraded,

106
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
almost desert-like land up in these mountains.

107
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Ways of controlling, preventing soil erosion.

108
0:07:23.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Ways of reclaiming overused farmland,

109
0:07:26.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
so that within two years they can again be productive.

110
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Working to help the villagers obtain fresh water from wells.

111
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Perhaps build some schoolrooms.

112
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Most important of all, I believe,

113
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is working with small groups of women,

114
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
providing them with opportunities for micro-credit loans.

115
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And we've got, as is the case around the world,

116
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
about 95 percent of all loans returned.

117
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Empowering women, working with education,

118
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
providing scholarships for girls so they can finish secondary school,

119
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in the clear understanding that, all around the world,

120
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
as women's education improves, family size drops.

121
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
We provide information about family planning and about HIV/AIDS.

122
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And as a result of this program,

123
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
something's happening for conservation.

124
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
What's happening for conservation is that the farmers living in these 24 villages,

125
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
instead of looking on us as a bunch of white people

126
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
coming to study a whole bunch of monkeys --

127
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and by the way, many of the staff are now Tanzanian --

128
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but when we began the TACARE program,

129
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
it was a Tanzanian team going into the villages.

130
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
It was a Tanzanian team talking to the villagers,

131
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
asking what they were interested in.

132
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Were they interested in conservation? Absolutely not.

133
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:59,000
They were interested in health; they were interested in education.

134
0:08:59.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And as time went on, and as their situation began to improve,

135
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
they began to understand ever more about the need for conservation.

136
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
They began to understand

137
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that as the upper levels of the hills were denuded of trees,

138
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
so you've got this terrible soil erosion and mudslides.

139
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Today, we are developing what we call the Greater Gombe Ecosystem.

140
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This is an area way outside the National Park,

141
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
stretching out into all these very degraded lands.

142
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And as these villages have a better standard of life,

143
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they are actually agreeing to put

144
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
between 10 percent and 20 percent of their land in the highlands aside,

145
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
so that once again, as the trees grow back,

146
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the chimpanzees will have leafy corridors

147
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:52,000
through which they can travel to interact --

148
0:09:52.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
as they must for genetic viability --

149
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
with other remnant groups outside the National Park.

150
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So TACARE is a success.

151
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We're replicating it in other parts of Africa,

152
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
around other wilderness areas

153
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
which are faced with extreme population pressure.

154
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The problems in Africa, however, as we've been discussing

155
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
for the whole of these first couple of days of TED,

156
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
are major problems.

157
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
There is a great deal of poverty.

158
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And when you get large numbers of people

159
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:32,000
living in land that is not that fertile,

160
0:10:32.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
particularly when you cut down trees,

161
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and you leave the soil open to the wind for erosion,

162
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
as desperate populations cut down more and more trees,

163
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
so that they can try and grow food for themselves and their families,

164
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
what's going to happen? Something's got to give.

165
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And the other problems -- in not only Africa,

166
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
but the rest of the developing world and, indeed, everywhere --

167
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
what are we doing to our planet?

168
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
You know, the famous scientist, E. O. Wilson

169
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
said that if every person on this planet

170
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
attains the standard of living of the average European or American,

171
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
we need three new planets.

172
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Today, they are saying four. But we don't have them. We've got one.

173
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And what's happened? I mean, the question here is, here we are,

174
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
arguably the most intelligent being that's ever walked planet Earth,

175
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
with this extraordinary brain,

176
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
capable of the kind of technology

177
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that is so well illustrated by these TED Conferences,

178
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and yet we're destroying the only home we have.

179
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
The indigenous people around the world,

180
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
before they made a major decision,

181
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
used to sit around and ask themselves,

182
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
"How does this decision affect our people seven generations ahead?"

183
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Today, major decisions -- and I'm not particularly talking about Africa here,

184
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but the developed world --

185
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
major decisions involving millions of dollars,

186
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and millions of people, are often based on,

187
0:12:08.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
"How will this affect the next shareholders' meeting?"

188
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And these decisions affect Africa.

189
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
As I began traveling around Africa

190
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
talking about the problems faced by chimpanzees and their vanishing forests,

191
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I realized more and more how so many of Africa's problems

192
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
could be laid at the door of previous colonial exploitation.

193
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So I began traveling outside Africa, talking in Europe,

194
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
talking in the United States, going to Asia.

195
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And everywhere there were these terrible problems.

196
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And you know the kind I'm talking about. I'm talking about pollution.

197
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
The air that we breathe that often poisons us.

198
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
The earth is poisoning our foods.

199
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The water -- water is perhaps one of the most crucial issues

200
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that we're going to face in this century --

201
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and everywhere water is being polluted by agricultural,

202
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
industrial and household chemicals

203
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that still are being sprayed around the world,

204
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
seemingly with the inability to profit from past experience.

205
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
The mangroves are being cut down;

206
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the effects of things like the tsunami get worse.

207
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
We've talked about the soil erosion.

208
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We have the reckless burning of fossil fuels

209
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
along with other greenhouse gasses, so called,

210
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
leading to climate change.

211
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Finally, all around the world, people have begun to believe

212
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that there is something going on very wrong with our climate.

213
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
All around the world climates are mixed up.

214
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And it's the poor people who are affected worse.

215
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
It's Africa that already is affected.

216
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
In many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the droughts are so much worse.

217
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And when the rain does come, it so often leads to flooding

218
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and added distress, and the cycle of poverty and hunger and disease.

219
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
And the numbers of people living in an area that the land cannot support,

220
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
who are too poor to buy food,

221
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
who can't move away because the whole land is degraded.

222
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And so you get desertification -- creeping, creeping, creeping --

223
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
as the last of the trees are cut down.

224
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And this kind of thing is not just in Africa. It's all over the world.

225
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So it wasn't surprising to me

226
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that as I was traveling around the world

227
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I met so many young people who seemed to have lost hope.

228
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We seem to have lost wisdom, the wisdom of the indigenous people.

229
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
I asked a question. "Why?"

230
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Well, do you think there could be some kind of disconnect

231
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:45,000
between this extraordinarily clever brain,

232
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
the kind of brain that the TED technologies exemplify,

233
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and the human heart? Talking about it in the non-scientific term,

234
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
in terms of love and compassion. Is there some disconnect?

235
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And these young people, when I talk to them,

236
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
basically they were either depressed or apathetic,

237
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
or bitter and angry. And they said more or less the same thing,

238
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
"We feel this way because we feel you've compromised our future

239
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and there's nothing we can do about it."

240
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
We have compromised their future.

241
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I've got three little grandchildren, and every time I look at them

242
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and I think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was their age,

243
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
I feel this desperation.

244
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And that led to this program we call Roots and Shoots,

245
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
which began right here in Tanzania

246
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and has now spread to 97 countries around the world.

247
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
It's symbolic. Roots make a firm foundation.

248
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Shoots seem tiny; to reach the sun they can break through a brick wall.

249
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
See the brick wall as all these problems we've inflicted on the planet,

250
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
environmental and social. It's a message of hope.

251
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Hundreds and thousands of young people around the world

252
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
can break through and can make this a better world for all living things.

253
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
The most important message of Roots and Shoots:

254
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
every single one of us makes a difference, every single day.

255
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We have a choice. Every one of us in this room,

256
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
we have a choice as to what kind of difference we want to make.

257
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
The very poor have no choice. It's up to us to change things

258
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
so that the poor have choice as well.

259
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
The Roots and Shoots groups all choose three projects.

260
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:34,000
It depends on how old they are, and which country,

261
0:16:34.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
whether they're in a city or rural, as to what kinds of projects.

262
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But basically, we have programs now from preschool right through university,

263
0:16:42.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
with more and more adults starting their own Roots and Shoots groups.

264
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And every group chooses, between them,

265
0:16:51.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
three different kinds of project to make this a better world,

266
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
recognizing that all these different problems are interconnected

267
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:,000
and impinge on each other.

268
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
So one of their projects will be to help their own human community.

269
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And then, if they're able, they may raise money to help communities

270
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
in other parts of the world.

271
0:17:09.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
One of their projects will be to help animals -- not just wildlife,

272
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
domestic animals as well.

273
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:19,000
And one of their projects will be to help the environment that we all share.

274
0:17:19.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And woven throughout all of this is a message

275
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:28,000
of learning to live in peace and harmony within ourselves,

276
0:17:28.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
in our families, in our communities, between nations, between cultures,

277
0:17:32.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
between religions and between us and the natural world.

278
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:41,000
We need the natural world. We cannot go on destroying it at the rate we are.

279
0:17:41.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
We not do have more than this one planet.

280
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Just picking one or two of the projects right here in Africa

281
0:17:49.33,000 --> 0:17:52,000
that the Roots and Shoots groups are doing,

282
0:17:52.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
one or two projects only -- in Tanzania, in Uganda, Kenya,

283
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:18:02,000
South Africa, Congo-Brazzaville, Sierra Leone, Cameroon

284
0:18:02.33,000 --> 0:18:06,000
and other groups. And as I say, it's in 97 countries around the world.

285
0:18:06.33,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Of course, they're planting trees. They're growing organic vegetables.

286
0:18:10.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
They're working in the refugee camps, with chickens

287
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
and selling the eggs for a little amount of money,

288
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:18,000
or just using them to feed their families,

289
0:18:18.33,000 --> 0:18:21,000
and feeling a sense of pride and empowerment,

290
0:18:21.33,000 --> 0:18:23,000
because they're no longer helpless and depending on others

291
0:18:23.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
with their vegetables and their chickens.

292
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:28,000
It's being used in Uganda

293
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:33,000
to give some psychological help to ex-child soldiers.

294
0:18:33.33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Doing projects like this is bringing them out of themselves.

295
0:18:36.33,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Once again, they're useful members of society.

296
0:18:39.33,000 --> 0:18:41,000
We have this program in prisons as well.

297
0:18:42.33,000 --> 0:18:45,000
So, there's no time for more Roots and Shoots now.

298
0:18:45.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
But -- oh, they're also working on HIV/AIDS.

299
0:18:49.33,000 --> 0:18:52,000
That's a very important component of Roots and Shoots,

300
0:18:52.33,000 --> 0:18:54,000
with older kids talking to younger ones.

301
0:18:54.33,000 --> 0:18:57,000
And unwanted pregnancies and things like that,

302
0:18:57.33,000 --> 0:19:02,000
which young people listen to better from other youth, rather than adults.

303
0:19:03.33,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Hope. That's the question I get asked as I'm going around the world:

304
0:19:08.33,000 --> 0:19:1,000
"Jane, you've seen so many terrible things,

305
0:19:10.33,000 --> 0:19:13,000
you've seen your chimpanzees decrease in number

306
0:19:13.33,000 --> 0:19:15,000
from about one million, at the turn of the century,

307
0:19:15.33,000 --> 0:19:2,000
to no more than 150,000 now, and the same with so many other animals.

308
0:19:20.33,000 --> 0:19:24,000
Forests disappearing, deserts where once there was forest.

309
0:19:24.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Do you really have hope?" Well, yes.

310
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:32,000
You can't come to a conference like TED and not have hope, can you?

311
0:19:32.33,000 --> 0:19:36,000
And of course, there's hope. One is this amazing human brain.

312
0:19:36.33,000 --> 0:19:38,000
And I mean, think of the technologies.

313
0:19:38.33,000 --> 0:19:45,000
And I've just been so thrilled, finally, to come to people talking about compost latrines.

314
0:19:45.33,000 --> 0:19:47,000
It's one of my hobbyhorses.

315
0:19:47.33,000 --> 0:19:51,000
We just flush all this water down the lavatory, it's terrible.

316
0:19:51.33,000 --> 0:19:56,000
And then talking about renewable energy -- desperately important.

317
0:19:56.33,000 --> 0:19:59,000
Do we care about the planet for our children?

318
0:19:59.33,000 --> 0:20:02,000
How many of us have children or grandchildren, nieces, nephews?

319
0:20:02.33,000 --> 0:20:05,000
Do we care about their future?

320
0:20:05.33,000 --> 0:20:1,000
And if we care about their future, we, as the elite around the world,

321
0:20:10.33,000 --> 0:20:14,000
we can do something about it. We can make choices as to how we live each day.

322
0:20:14.33,000 --> 0:20:16,000
What we buy. What we wear.

323
0:20:16.33,000 --> 0:20:21,000
And choose to make these choices with the question,

324
0:20:21.33,000 --> 0:20:24,000
how will this affect the environment around me?

325
0:20:24.33,000 --> 0:20:29,000
How will it affect the life of my child when he or she grows up?

326
0:20:29.33,000 --> 0:20:31,000
Or my grandchild, or whatever it is.

327
0:20:31.33,000 --> 0:20:36,000
So the human brain, coupled with the human heart,

328
0:20:36.33,000 --> 0:20:38,000
and we join hands around the world.

329
0:20:38.33,000 --> 0:20:42,000
And that's what TED is helping so well with, and Google who help us,

330
0:20:42.33,000 --> 0:20:47,000
and Esri are helping us with mapping in Gombe National Park.

331
0:20:47.33,000 --> 0:20:49,000
All of these technologies we can use.

332
0:20:49.33,000 --> 0:20:52,000
Now let's link them, and it's beginning to happen, isn't it?

333
0:20:52.33,000 --> 0:20:56,000
You've heard about it this afternoon. It's beginning to happen.

334
0:20:56.33,000 --> 0:20:58,000
This change, this change. To see change

335
0:20:58.33,000 --> 0:21:01,000
that we must have if we care about the future.

336
0:21:01.33,000 --> 0:21:05,000
And the next reason for hope -- nature is amazingly resilient.

337
0:21:05.33,000 --> 0:21:08,000
You can take an area that's absolutely destroyed,

338
0:21:08.33,000 --> 0:21:11,000
with time and perhaps some help it can regenerate.

339
0:21:11.33,000 --> 0:21:14,000
And an example is the TACARE program.

340
0:21:14.33,000 --> 0:21:17,000
I told you, where a seemingly dead tree stump --

341
0:21:17.33,000 --> 0:21:19,000
if you stop hacking them for firewood,

342
0:21:19.33,000 --> 0:21:21,000
which you don't need to because you have wood lots,

343
0:21:21.33,000 --> 0:21:25,000
then in five years you can have a 30-foot tree.

344
0:21:25.33,000 --> 0:21:28,000
And animals, almost on the brink of extinction,

345
0:21:28.33,000 --> 0:21:31,000
can be given a second chance. That's my next book.

346
0:21:31.33,000 --> 0:21:35,000
It's inspiring. And it brings me to my last category of hope,

347
0:21:35.33,000 --> 0:21:38,000
and we've heard about this so much in the last two days:

348
0:21:38.33,000 --> 0:21:42,000
this indomitable human spirit. This determination of people,

349
0:21:42.33,000 --> 0:21:44,000
the resilience of the human spirit,

350
0:21:44.33,000 --> 0:21:48,000
So that people who you would think would be battered by poverty,

351
0:21:48.33,000 --> 0:21:53,000
or disease, or whatever, can pull themselves up out of it,

352
0:21:53.33,000 --> 0:21:59,000
sometimes with a helping hand, and take their part in society,

353
0:21:59.33,000 --> 0:22:02,000
and take their part in changing the world.

354
0:22:02.33,000 --> 0:22:06,000
And just to think of one or two people out of Africa who are just really inspiring.

355
0:22:06.33,000 --> 0:22:09,000
We could make a very long list,

356
0:22:09.33,000 --> 0:22:12,000
but obviously Nelson Mandela, emerging from 17 years

357
0:22:12.33,000 --> 0:22:15,000
of hard physical labor, 23 years of imprisonment,

358
0:22:15.33,000 --> 0:22:19,000
with this amazing ability to forgive, so that he could lead his nation

359
0:22:19.33,000 --> 0:22:23,000
out the evil regime of apartheid without a bloodbath.

360
0:22:23.33,000 --> 0:22:28,000
Ken Saro-Wiwa, in Nigeria, who took on the giant oil companies,

361
0:22:28.33,000 --> 0:22:33,000
and although people around the world tried their best, was executed.

362
0:22:33.33,000 --> 0:22:37,000
People like this are so inspirational.

363
0:22:37.33,000 --> 0:22:41,000
People like this are the role models we need for young Africans.

364
0:22:41.33,000 --> 0:22:45,000
And we need some environmental role models as well,

365
0:22:45.33,000 --> 0:22:47,000
and I've been hearing some of them today.

366
0:22:47.33,000 --> 0:22:52,000
So I'm really grateful for this opportunity to share this message

367
0:22:52.33,000 --> 0:22:54,000
again, with everyone at TED.

368
0:22:54.33,000 --> 0:22:59,000
And I hope that some of us can get together and talk about some of these things,

369
0:22:59.33,000 --> 0:23:01,000
especially the Roots and Shoots program.

370
0:23:01.33,000 --> 0:23:03,000
And just a last word on that --

371
0:23:03.33,000 --> 0:23:06,000
the young woman who's running this entire conference center,

372
0:23:06.33,000 --> 0:23:08,000
I met her today.

373
0:23:08.33,000 --> 0:23:13,000
She came up so excited, with her certificate. She was [in] Roots and Shoots.

374
0:23:13.33,000 --> 0:23:15,000
She was in the leadership in Dar es Salaam.

375
0:23:15.33,000 --> 0:23:18,000
She said it's helped her to do what she's doing.

376
0:23:18.33,000 --> 0:23:21,000
And it was very, very exciting for me to meet her

377
0:23:21.33,000 --> 0:23:24,000
and see just one example of how young people,

378
0:23:24.33,000 --> 0:23:3,000
when they are empowered, given the opportunity to take action,

379
0:23:30.33,000 --> 0:23:32,000
to make the world a better place,

380
0:23:32.33,000 --> 0:23:34,000
truly are our hope for tomorrow.

381
0:23:34.33,000 --> 0:23:36,000
Thank you.

382
0:23:37.33,000 --> 0:23:4,000
(Applause)

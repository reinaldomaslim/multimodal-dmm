1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Humans have long held a fascination

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
for the human brain.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We chart it, we've described it,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
we've drawn it,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
we've mapped it.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now just like the physical maps of our world

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that have been highly influenced by technology --

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
think Google Maps,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
think GPS --

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the same thing is happening for brain mapping

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
through transformation.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So let's take a look at the brain.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Most people, when they first look at a fresh human brain,

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
they say, "It doesn't look what you're typically looking at

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
when someone shows you a brain."

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Typically, what you're looking at is a fixed brain. It's gray.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And this outer layer, this is the vasculature,

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
which is incredible, around a human brain.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
This is the blood vessels.

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
20 percent of the oxygen

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
coming from your lungs,

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
20 percent of the blood pumped from your heart,

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is servicing this one organ.

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
That's basically, if you hold two fists together,

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
it's just slightly larger than the two fists.

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Scientists, sort of at the end of the 20th century,

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
learned that they could track blood flow

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to map non-invasively

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
where activity was going on in the human brain.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So for example, they can see in the back part of the brain,

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which is just turning around there.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
There's the cerebellum; that's keeping you upright right now.

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's keeping me standing. It's involved in coordinated movement.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
On the side here, this is temporal cortex.

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This is the area where primary auditory processing --

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
so you're hearing my words,

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
you're sending it up into higher language processing centers.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Towards the front of the brain

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is the place in which all of the more complex thought, decision making --

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
it's the last to mature in late adulthood.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This is where all your decision-making processes are going on.

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It's the place where you're deciding right now

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
you probably aren't going to order the steak for dinner.

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So if you take a deeper look at the brain,

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
one of the things, if you look at it in cross-section,

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
what you can see

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
is that you can't really see a whole lot of structure there.

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But there's actually a lot of structure there.

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's cells and it's wires all wired together.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So about a hundred years ago,

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
some scientists invented a stain that would stain cells.

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And that's shown here in the the very light blue.

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You can see areas

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
where neuronal cell bodies are being stained.

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And what you can see is it's very non-uniform. You see a lot more structure there.

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So the outer part of that brain

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is the neocortex.

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It's one continuous processing unit, if you will.

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But you can also see things underneath there as well.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And all of these blank areas

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
are the areas in which the wires are running through.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They're probably less cell dense.

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So there's about 86 billion neurons in our brain.

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And as you can see, they're very non-uniformly distributed.

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And how they're distributed really contributes

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to their underlying function.

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And of course, as I mentioned before,

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
since we can now start to map brain function,

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
we can start to tie these into the individual cells.

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So let's take a deeper look.

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Let's look at neurons.

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So as I mentioned, there are 86 billion neurons.

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
There are also these smaller cells as you'll see.

74
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
These are support cells -- astrocytes glia.

75
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And the nerves themselves

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
are the ones who are receiving input.

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
They're storing it, they're processing it.

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Each neuron is connected via synapses

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to up to 10,000 other neurons in your brain.

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And each neuron itself

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
is largely unique.

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The unique character of both individual neurons

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and neurons within a collection of the brain

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
are driven by fundamental properties

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
of their underlying biochemistry.

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
These are proteins.

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They're proteins that are controlling things like ion channel movement.

88
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
They're controlling who nervous system cells partner up with.

89
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And they're controlling

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
basically everything that the nervous system has to do.

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So if we zoom in to an even deeper level,

92
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
all of those proteins

93
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
are encoded by our genomes.

94
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We each have 23 pairs of chromosomes.

95
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We get one from mom, one from dad.

96
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And on these chromosomes

97
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
are roughly 25,000 genes.

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
They're encoded in the DNA.

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And the nature of a given cell

100
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
driving its underlying biochemistry

101
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is dictated by which of these 25,000 genes

102
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
are turned on

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and at what level they're turned on.

104
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And so our project

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is seeking to look at this readout,

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
understanding which of these 25,000 genes is turned on.

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So in order to undertake such a project,

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we obviously need brains.

109
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So we sent our lab technician out.

110
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We were seeking normal human brains.

111
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
What we actually start with

112
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is a medical examiner's office.

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This a place where the dead are brought in.

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We are seeking normal human brains.

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
There's a lot of criteria by which we're selecting these brains.

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We want to make sure

117
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that we have normal humans between the ages of 20 to 60,

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
they died a somewhat natural death

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
with no injury to the brain,

120
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
no history of psychiatric disease,

121
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
no drugs on board --

122
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
we do a toxicology workup.

123
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And we're very careful

124
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
about the brains that we do take.

125
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We're also selecting for brains

126
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
in which we can get the tissue,

127
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we can get consent to take the tissue

128
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
within 24 hours of time of death.

129
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Because what we're trying to measure, the RNA --

130
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
which is the readout from our genes --

131
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
is very labile,

132
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and so we have to move very quickly.

133
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
One side note on the collection of brains:

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because of the way that we collect,

135
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and because we require consent,

136
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
we actually have a lot more male brains than female brains.

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Males are much more likely to die an accidental death in the prime of their life.

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And men are much more likely

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to have their significant other, spouse, give consent

140
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
than the other way around.

141
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

142
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So the first thing that we do at the site of collection

143
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is we collect what's called an MR.

144
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This is magnetic resonance imaging -- MRI.

145
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's a standard template by which we're going to hang the rest of this data.

146
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So we collect this MR.

147
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And you can think of this as our satellite view for our map.

148
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
The next thing we do

149
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
is we collect what's called a diffusion tensor imaging.

150
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This maps the large cabling in the brain.

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And again, you can think of this

152
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
as almost mapping our interstate highways, if you will.

153
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The brain is removed from the skull,

154
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and then it's sliced into one-centimeter slices.

155
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And those are frozen solid,

156
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and they're shipped to Seattle.

157
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And in Seattle, we take these --

158
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
this is a whole human hemisphere --

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and we put them into what's basically a glorified meat slicer.

160
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
There's a blade here that's going to cut across

161
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
a section of the tissue

162
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and transfer it to a microscope slide.

163
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We're going to then apply one of those stains to it,

164
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and we scan it.

165
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And then what we get is our first mapping.

166
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So this is where experts come in

167
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and they make basic anatomic assignments.

168
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
You could consider this state boundaries, if you will,

169
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
those pretty broad outlines.

170
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
From this, we're able to then fragment that brain into further pieces,

171
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which then we can put on a smaller cryostat.

172
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And this is just showing this here --

173
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
this frozen tissue, and it's being cut.

174
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
This is 20 microns thin, so this is about a baby hair's width.

175
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And remember, it's frozen.

176
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And so you can see here,

177
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
old-fashioned technology of the paintbrush being applied.

178
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We take a microscope slide.

179
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Then we very carefully melt onto the slide.

180
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This will then go onto a robot

181
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that's going to apply one of those stains to it.

182
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And our anatomists are going to go in and take a deeper look at this.

183
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So again this is what they can see under the microscope.

184
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You can see collections and configurations

185
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
of large and small cells

186
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in clusters and various places.

187
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And from there it's routine. They understand where to make these assignments.

188
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And they can make basically what's a reference atlas.

189
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
This is a more detailed map.

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Our scientists then use this

191
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to go back to another piece of that tissue

192
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and do what's called laser scanning microdissection.

193
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So the technician takes the instructions.

194
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
They scribe along a place there.

195
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And then the laser actually cuts.

196
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
You can see that blue dot there cutting. And that tissue falls off.

197
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
You can see on the microscope slide here,

198
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that's what's happening in real time.

199
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
There's a container underneath that's collecting that tissue.

200
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We take that tissue,

201
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we purify the RNA out of it

202
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
using some basic technology,

203
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and then we put a florescent tag on it.

204
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We take that tagged material

205
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and we put it on to something called a microarray.

206
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Now this may look like a bunch of dots to you,

207
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but each one of these individual dots

208
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
is actually a unique piece of the human genome

209
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that we spotted down on glass.

210
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
This has roughly 60,000 elements on it,

211
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
so we repeatedly measure various genes

212
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
of the 25,000 genes in the genome.

213
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And when we take a sample and we hybridize it to it,

214
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
we get a unique fingerprint, if you will,

215
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
quantitatively of what genes are turned on in that sample.

216
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Now we do this over and over again,

217
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
this process for any given brain.

218
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We're taking over a thousand samples for each brain.

219
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
This area shown here is an area called the hippocampus.

220
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It's involved in learning and memory.

221
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And it contributes to about 70 samples

222
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
of those thousand samples.

223
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So each sample gets us about 50,000 data points

224
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
with repeat measurements, a thousand samples.

225
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So roughly, we have 50 million data points

226
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
for a given human brain.

227
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We've done right now

228
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
two human brains-worth of data.

229
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We've put all of that together

230
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
into one thing,

231
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and I'll show you what that synthesis looks like.

232
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It's basically a large data set of information

233
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that's all freely available to any scientist around the world.

234
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
They don't even have to log in to come use this tool,

235
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
mine this data, find interesting things out with this.

236
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So here's the modalities that we put together.

237
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
You'll start to recognize these things from what we've collected before.

238
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Here's the MR. It provides the framework.

239
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
There's an operator side on the right that allows you to turn,

240
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
it allows you to zoom in,

241
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
it allows you to highlight individual structures.

242
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But most importantly,

243
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
we're now mapping into this anatomic framework,

244
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
which is a common framework for people to understand where genes are turned on.

245
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So the red levels

246
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
are where a gene is turned on to a great degree.

247
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Green is the sort of cool areas where it's not turned on.

248
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And each gene gives us a fingerprint.

249
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And remember that we've assayed all the 25,000 genes in the genome

250
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and have all of that data available.

251
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So what can scientists learn about this data?

252
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We're just starting to look at this data ourselves.

253
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
There's some basic things that you would want to understand.

254
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Two great examples are drugs,

255
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Prozac and Wellbutrin.

256
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
These are commonly prescribed antidepressants.

257
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Now remember, we're assaying genes.

258
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Genes send the instructions to make proteins.

259
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Proteins are targets for drugs.

260
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So drugs bind to proteins

261
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and either turn them off, etc.

262
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So if you want to understand the action of drugs,

263
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
you want to understand how they're acting in the ways you want them to,

264
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and also in the ways you don't want them to.

265
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
In the side effect profile, etc.,

266
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
you want to see where those genes are turned on.

267
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And for the first time, we can actually do that.

268
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We can do that in multiple individuals that we've assayed too.

269
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So now we can look throughout the brain.

270
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We can see this unique fingerprint.

271
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And we get confirmation.

272
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
We get confirmation that, indeed, the gene is turned on --

273
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
for something like Prozac,

274
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in serotonergic structures, things that are already known be affected --

275
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
but we also get to see the whole thing.

276
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We also get to see areas that no one has ever looked at before,

277
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and we see these genes turned on there.

278
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It's as interesting a side effect as it could be.

279
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
One other thing you can do with such a thing

280
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
is you can, because it's a pattern matching exercise,

281
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because there's unique fingerprint,

282
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
we can actually scan through the entire genome

283
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and find other proteins

284
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that show a similar fingerprint.

285
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So if you're in drug discovery, for example,

286
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
you can go through

287
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
an entire listing of what the genome has on offer

288
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to find perhaps better drug targets and optimize.

289
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Most of you are probably familiar

290
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
with genome-wide association studies

291
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
in the form of people covering in the news

292
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
saying, "Scientists have recently discovered the gene or genes

293
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
which affect X."

294
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And so these kinds of studies

295
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
are routinely published by scientists

296
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and they're great. They analyze large populations.

297
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
They look at their entire genomes,

298
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and they try to find hot spots of activity

299
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that are linked causally to genes.

300
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
But what you get out of such an exercise

301
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is simply a list of genes.

302
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
It tells you the what, but it doesn't tell you the where.

303
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And so it's very important for those researchers

304
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that we've created this resource.

305
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Now they can come in

306
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and they can start to get clues about activity.

307
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
They can start to look at common pathways --

308
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
other things that they simply haven't been able to do before.

309
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
So I think this audience in particular

310
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
can understand the importance of individuality.

311
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And I think every human,

312
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
we all have different genetic backgrounds,

313
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
we all have lived separate lives.

314
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
But the fact is

315
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
our genomes are greater than 99 percent similar.

316
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
We're similar at the genetic level.

317
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
And what we're finding

318
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
is actually, even at the brain biochemical level,

319
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
we are quite similar.

320
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And so this shows it's not 99 percent,

321
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
but it's roughly 90 percent correspondence

322
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
at a reasonable cutoff,

323
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
so everything in the cloud is roughly correlated.

324
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And then we find some outliers,

325
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
some things that lie beyond the cloud.

326
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And those genes are interesting,

327
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
but they're very subtle.

328
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So I think it's an important message

329
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to take home today

330
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that even though we celebrate all of our differences,

331
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
we are quite similar

332
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
even at the brain level.

333
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Now what do those differences look like?

334
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
This is an example of a study that we did

335
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
to follow up and see what exactly those differences were --

336
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and they're quite subtle.

337
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
These are things where genes are turned on in an individual cell type.

338
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
These are two genes that we found as good examples.

339
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
One is called RELN -- it's involved in early developmental cues.

340
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
DISC1 is a gene

341
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
that's deleted in schizophrenia.

342
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
These aren't schizophrenic individuals,

343
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but they do show some population variation.

344
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And so what you're looking at here

345
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
in donor one and donor four,

346
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
which are the exceptions to the other two,

347
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that genes are being turned on

348
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
in a very specific subset of cells.

349
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
It's this dark purple precipitate within the cell

350
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
that's telling us a gene is turned on there.

351
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Whether or not that's due

352
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
to an individual's genetic background or their experiences,

353
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
we don't know.

354
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Those kinds of studies require much larger populations.

355
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
So I'm going to leave you with a final note

356
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
about the complexity of the brain

357
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and how much more we have to go.

358
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
I think these resources are incredibly valuable.

359
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
They give researchers a handle

360
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
on where to go.

361
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
But we only looked at a handful of individuals at this point.

362
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
We're certainly going to be looking at more.

363
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
I'll just close by saying

364
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that the tools are there,

365
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and this is truly an unexplored, undiscovered continent.

366
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
This is the new frontier, if you will.

367
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
And so for those who are undaunted,

368
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
but humbled by the complexity of the brain,

369
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
the future awaits.

370
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Thanks.

371
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000

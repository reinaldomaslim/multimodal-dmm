1
0:00:12.95,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I was seven years old,

2
0:00:14.65,000 --> 0:00:18,000
some well-meaning adult asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up.

3
0:00:18.785,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Proudly, I said: "An artist."

4
0:00:20.827,000 --> 0:00:21,000
"No, you don't," he said,

5
0:00:22.212,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"You can't make a living being an artist!"

6
0:00:24.915,000 --> 0:00:27,000
My little seven-year-old Picasso dreams were crushed.

7
0:00:28.014,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But I gathered myself,

8
0:00:29.71,000 --> 0:00:3,000
went off in search of a new dream,

9
0:00:31.593,000 --> 0:00:33,000
eventually settling on being a scientist,

10
0:00:34.475,000 --> 0:00:36,000
perhaps something like the next Albert Einstein.

11
0:00:37.783,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:40.086,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I have always loved math and science,

13
0:00:42.111,000 --> 0:00:43,000
later, coding.

14
0:00:43.646,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And so I decided to study computer programming in college.

15
0:00:47.312,000 --> 0:00:48,000
In my junior year,

16
0:00:48.487,000 --> 0:00:51,000
my computer graphics professor showed us these wonderful short films.

17
0:00:52.917,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It was the first computer animation any of us had ever seen.

18
0:00:56.566,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I watched these films in wonder, transfixed,

19
0:00:59.37,000 --> 0:01:01,000
fireworks going off in my head,

20
0:01:01.605,000 --> 0:01:03,000
thinking, "That is what I want to do with my life."

21
0:01:05.006,000 --> 0:01:08,000
The idea that all the math, science and code I had been learning

22
0:01:08.563,000 --> 0:01:11,000
could come together to create these worlds and characters

23
0:01:11.725,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and stories I connected with,

24
0:01:13.611,000 --> 0:01:14,000
was pure magic for me.

25
0:01:16.126,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Just two years later, I started working

26
0:01:18.039,000 --> 0:01:21,000
at the place that made those films, Pixar Animation Studios.

27
0:01:21.082,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It was here I learned how we actually execute those films.

28
0:01:24.303,000 --> 0:01:25,000
To create our movies,

29
0:01:25.486,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we create a three-dimensional world inside the computer.

30
0:01:28.922,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We start with a point that makes a line that makes a face

31
0:01:32.549,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that creates characters,

32
0:01:34.281,000 --> 0:01:36,000
or trees and rocks that eventually become a forest.

33
0:01:37.326,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And because it's a three-dimensional world,

34
0:01:39.462,000 --> 0:01:41,000
we can move a camera around inside that world.

35
0:01:43.004,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I was fascinated by all of it.

36
0:01:45.441,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But then I got my first taste of lighting.

37
0:01:48.581,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Lighting in practice is placing lights inside this three-dimensional world.

38
0:01:52.254,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I actually have icons of lights I move around in there.

39
0:01:54.998,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Here you can see I've added a light,

40
0:01:56.744,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I'm turning on the rough version of lighting in our software,

41
0:01:59.632,000 --> 0:02:,000
turn on shadows

42
0:02:00.887,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and placing the light.

43
0:02:02.315,000 --> 0:02:03,000
As I place a light,

44
0:02:03.506,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I think about what it might look like in real life,

45
0:02:06.242,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but balance that out with what we need artistically and for the story.

46
0:02:10.981,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So it might look like this at first,

47
0:02:14.155,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but as we adjust this and move that

48
0:02:16.593,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in weeks of work,

49
0:02:18.162,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in rough form it might look like this,

50
0:02:21.252,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and in final form, like this.

51
0:02:28.306,000 --> 0:02:32,000
There's this moment in lighting that made me fall utterly in love with it.

52
0:02:32.381,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It's where we go from this

53
0:02:34.807,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to this.

54
0:02:36.045,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It's the moment where all the pieces come together,

55
0:02:38.605,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and suddenly the world comes to life

56
0:02:41.232,000 --> 0:02:43,000
as if it's an actual place that exists.

57
0:02:44.009,000 --> 0:02:45,000
This moment never gets old,

58
0:02:45.74,000 --> 0:02:48,000
especially for that little seven-year-old girl that wanted to be an artist.

59
0:02:49.632,000 --> 0:02:5,000
As I learned to light,

60
0:02:50.809,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I learned about using light to help tell story,

61
0:02:54.442,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to set the time of day,

62
0:02:57.258,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to create the mood,

63
0:02:59.978,000 --> 0:03:,000
to guide the audience's eye,

64
0:03:02.85,000 --> 0:03:04,000
how to make a character look appealing

65
0:03:05.033,000 --> 0:03:06,000
or stand out in a busy set.

66
0:03:08.224,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Did you see WALL-E?

67
0:03:09.558,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:10.621,000 --> 0:03:11,000
There he is.

69
0:03:13.49,000 --> 0:03:14,000
As you can see,

70
0:03:14.737,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we can create any world that we want inside the computer.

71
0:03:17.468,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We can make a world with monsters,

72
0:03:20.837,000 --> 0:03:21,000
with robots that fall in love,

73
0:03:23.291,000 --> 0:03:25,000
we can even make pigs fly.

74
0:03:25.359,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:30.361,000 --> 0:03:31,000
While this is an incredible thing,

76
0:03:32.162,000 --> 0:03:34,000
this untethered artistic freedom,

77
0:03:34.661,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it can create chaos.

78
0:03:36.667,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It can create unbelievable worlds,

79
0:03:39.542,000 --> 0:03:4,000
unbelievable movement,

80
0:03:41.05,000 --> 0:03:43,000
things that are jarring to the audience.

81
0:03:43.224,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So to combat this, we tether ourselves with science.

82
0:03:46.432,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We use science and the world we know

83
0:03:48.43,000 --> 0:03:49,000
as a backbone,

84
0:03:49.804,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to ground ourselves in something relatable and recognizable.

85
0:03:53.806,000 --> 0:03:55,000
"Finding Nemo" is an excellent example of this.

86
0:03:56.359,000 --> 0:03:58,000
A major portion of the movie takes place underwater.

87
0:03:59.028,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But how do you make it look underwater?

88
0:04:01.302,000 --> 0:04:02,000
In early research and development,

89
0:04:02.957,000 --> 0:04:05,000
we took a clip of underwater footage and recreated it in the computer.

90
0:04:06.879,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Then we broke it back down

91
0:04:08.164,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to see which elements make up that underwater look.

92
0:04:11.526,000 --> 0:04:12,000
One of the most critical elements

93
0:04:13.157,000 --> 0:04:15,000
was how the light travels through the water.

94
0:04:15.363,000 --> 0:04:17,000
So we coded up a light that mimics this physics --

95
0:04:18.183,000 --> 0:04:19,000
first, the visibility of the water,

96
0:04:19.951,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and then what happens with the color.

97
0:04:22.503,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Objects close to the eye have their full, rich colors.

98
0:04:26.069,000 --> 0:04:28,000
As light travels deeper into the water,

99
0:04:28.296,000 --> 0:04:29,000
we lose the red wavelengths,

100
0:04:30.23,000 --> 0:04:31,000
then the green wavelengths,

101
0:04:31.598,000 --> 0:04:33,000
leaving us with blue at the far depths.

102
0:04:34.666,000 --> 0:04:37,000
In this clip you can see two other important elements.

103
0:04:37.79,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The first is the surge and swell,

104
0:04:39.836,000 --> 0:04:4,000
or the invisible underwater current

105
0:04:41.577,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that pushes the bits of particulate around in the water.

106
0:04:44.786,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The second is the caustics.

107
0:04:46.827,000 --> 0:04:47,000
These are the ribbons of light,

108
0:04:48.361,000 --> 0:04:5,000
like you might see on the bottom of a pool,

109
0:04:50.409,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that are created when the sun bends through the crests

110
0:04:52.983,000 --> 0:04:54,000
of the ripples and waves on the ocean's surface.

111
0:04:57.038,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Here we have the fog beams.

112
0:04:58.36,000 --> 0:04:59,000
These give us color depth cues,

113
0:05:00.039,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but also tells which direction is up

114
0:05:02.158,000 --> 0:05:04,000
in shots where we don't see the water surface.

115
0:05:04.788,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The other really cool thing you can see here

116
0:05:06.931,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is that we lit that particulate only with the caustics,

117
0:05:10.115,000 --> 0:05:12,000
so that as it goes in and out of those ribbons of light,

118
0:05:12.797,000 --> 0:05:13,000
it appears and disappears,

119
0:05:14.334,000 --> 0:05:17,000
lending a subtle, magical sparkle to the underwater.

120
0:05:18.53,000 --> 0:05:2,000
You can see how we're using the science --

121
0:05:21.096,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the physics of water, light and movement --

122
0:05:23.996,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to tether that artistic freedom.

123
0:05:26.57,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But we are not beholden to it.

124
0:05:28.915,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We considered each of these elements

125
0:05:30.738,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and which ones had to be scientifically accurate

126
0:05:33.776,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and which ones we could push and pull to suit the story and the mood.

127
0:05:37.882,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We realized early on that color was one we had some leeway with.

128
0:05:41.715,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So here's a traditionally colored underwater scene.

129
0:05:44.351,000 --> 0:05:46,000
But here, we can take Sydney Harbor and push it fairly green

130
0:05:47.216,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to suit the sad mood of what's happening.

131
0:05:50.315,000 --> 0:05:53,000
In this scene, it's really important we see deep into the underwater,

132
0:05:53.598,000 --> 0:05:55,000
so we understand what the East Australian Current is,

133
0:05:56.289,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that the turtles are diving into and going on this roller coaster ride.

134
0:05:59.701,000 --> 0:06:,000
So we pushed the visibility of the water

135
0:06:01.662,000 --> 0:06:03,000
well past anything you would ever see in real life.

136
0:06:04.843,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Because in the end,

137
0:06:06.029,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we are not trying to recreate the scientifically correct real world,

138
0:06:10.677,000 --> 0:06:12,000
we're trying to create a believable world,

139
0:06:12.741,000 --> 0:06:15,000
one the audience can immerse themselves in to experience the story.

140
0:06:17.344,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We use science to create something wonderful.

141
0:06:20.522,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We use story and artistic touch to get us to a place of wonder.

142
0:06:25.578,000 --> 0:06:27,000
This guy, WALL-E, is a great example of that.

143
0:06:28.078,000 --> 0:06:3,000
He finds beauty in the simplest things.

144
0:06:30.532,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But when he came in to lighting, we knew we had a big problem.

145
0:06:33.978,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We got so geeked-out on making WALL-E this convincing robot,

146
0:06:37.447,000 --> 0:06:4,000
that we made his binoculars practically optically perfect.

147
0:06:40.851,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

148
0:06:43.328,000 --> 0:06:46,000
His binoculars are one of the most critical acting devices he has.

149
0:06:47.346,000 --> 0:06:5,000
He doesn't have a face or even traditional dialogue, for that matter.

150
0:06:50.912,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So the animators were heavily dependent on the binoculars

151
0:06:53.863,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to sell his acting and emotions.

152
0:06:56.51,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We started lighting and we realized

153
0:06:58.243,000 --> 0:07:02,000
the triple lenses inside his binoculars were a mess of reflections.

154
0:07:02.989,000 --> 0:07:04,000
He was starting to look glassy-eyed.

155
0:07:05.066,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:06.814,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Now, glassy-eyed is a fundamentally awful thing

157
0:07:10.252,000 --> 0:07:12,000
when you are trying to convince an audience

158
0:07:12.292,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that a robot has a personality and he's capable of falling in love.

159
0:07:16.498,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So we went to work on these optically perfect binoculars,

160
0:07:20.046,000 --> 0:07:23,000
trying to find a solution that would maintain his true robot materials

161
0:07:23.772,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but solve this reflection problem.

162
0:07:26.096,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So we started with the lenses.

163
0:07:27.578,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Here's the flat-front lens,

164
0:07:28.994,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we have a concave lens

165
0:07:30.524,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and a convex lens.

166
0:07:31.805,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And here you see all three together,

167
0:07:33.934,000 --> 0:07:34,000
showing us all these reflections.

168
0:07:36.208,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We tried turning them down,

169
0:07:37.862,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we tried blocking them,

170
0:07:39.582,000 --> 0:07:4,000
nothing was working.

171
0:07:41.786,000 --> 0:07:42,000
You can see here,

172
0:07:42.961,000 --> 0:07:45,000
sometimes we needed something specific reflected in his eyes --

173
0:07:46.109,000 --> 0:07:47,000
usually Eve.

174
0:07:47.284,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So we couldn't just use some faked abstract image on the lenses.

175
0:07:50.839,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So here we have Eve on the first lens,

176
0:07:53.013,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we put Eve on the second lens,

177
0:07:55.088,000 --> 0:07:56,000
it's not working.

178
0:07:56.357,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We turn it down,

179
0:07:57.541,000 --> 0:07:58,000
it's still not working.

180
0:07:59.241,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And then we have our eureka moment.

181
0:08:01.595,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We add a light to WALL-E that accidentally leaks into his eyes.

182
0:08:06.092,000 --> 0:08:09,000
You can see it light up these gray aperture blades.

183
0:08:10.237,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Suddenly, those aperture blades are poking through that reflection

184
0:08:13.584,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the way nothing else has.

185
0:08:15.966,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Now we recognize WALL-E as having an eye.

186
0:08:19.532,000 --> 0:08:21,000
As humans we have the white of our eye,

187
0:08:22.205,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the colored iris

188
0:08:23.38,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and the black pupil.

189
0:08:24.948,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Now WALL-E has the black of an eye,

190
0:08:28.313,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the gray aperture blades

191
0:08:29.864,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and the black pupil.

192
0:08:31.689,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Suddenly, WALL-E feels like he has a soul,

193
0:08:35.355,000 --> 0:08:37,000
like there's a character with emotion inside.

194
0:08:40.038,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Later in the movie towards the end,

195
0:08:41.879,000 --> 0:08:42,000
WALL-E loses his personality,

196
0:08:43.381,000 --> 0:08:44,000
essentially going dead.

197
0:08:45.381,000 --> 0:08:48,000
This is the perfect time to bring back that glassy-eyed look.

198
0:08:49.553,000 --> 0:08:51,000
In the next scene, WALL-E comes back to life.

199
0:08:52.057,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We bring that light back to bring the aperture blades back,

200
0:08:55.264,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and he returns to that sweet, soulful robot we've come to love.

201
0:09:02.444,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Video) WALL-E: Eva?

202
0:09:06.841,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Danielle Feinberg: There's a beauty in these unexpected moments --

203
0:09:09.985,000 --> 0:09:12,000
when you find the key to unlocking a robot's soul,

204
0:09:13.575,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the moment when you discover what you want to do with your life.

205
0:09:17.135,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The jellyfish in "Finding Nemo" was one of those moments for me.

206
0:09:20.833,000 --> 0:09:23,000
There are scenes in every movie that struggle to come together.

207
0:09:24.076,000 --> 0:09:25,000
This was one of those scenes.

208
0:09:26.035,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The director had a vision for this scene

209
0:09:28.193,000 --> 0:09:31,000
based on some wonderful footage of jellyfish in the South Pacific.

210
0:09:33.139,000 --> 0:09:34,000
As we went along,

211
0:09:35.02,000 --> 0:09:36,000
we were floundering.

212
0:09:36.497,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The reviews with the director

213
0:09:38.61,000 --> 0:09:4,000
turned from the normal look-and-feel conversation

214
0:09:41.323,000 --> 0:09:45,000
into more and more questions about numbers and percentages.

215
0:09:46.085,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Maybe because unlike normal,

216
0:09:47.8,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we were basing it on something in real life,

217
0:09:50.077,000 --> 0:09:52,000
or maybe just because we had lost our way.

218
0:09:52.686,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But it had become about using our brain without our eyes,

219
0:09:55.821,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the science without the art.

220
0:09:58.251,000 --> 0:10:01,000
That scientific tether was strangling the scene.

221
0:10:02.534,000 --> 0:10:03,000
But even through all the frustrations,

222
0:10:04.404,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I still believed it could be beautiful.

223
0:10:06.463,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So when it came in to lighting,

224
0:10:08.146,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I dug in.

225
0:10:10.149,000 --> 0:10:13,000
As I worked to balance the blues and the pinks,

226
0:10:13.464,000 --> 0:10:15,000
the caustics dancing on the jellyfish bells,

227
0:10:16.304,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the undulating fog beams,

228
0:10:18.502,000 --> 0:10:2,000
something promising began to appear.

229
0:10:21.686,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I came in one morning and checked the previous night's work.

230
0:10:24.937,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And I got excited.

231
0:10:26.437,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And then I showed it to the lighting director

232
0:10:28.569,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and she got excited.

233
0:10:29.768,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Soon, I was showing to the director in a dark room full of 50 people.

234
0:10:34.563,000 --> 0:10:35,000
In director review,

235
0:10:35.85,000 --> 0:10:37,000
you hope you might get some nice words,

236
0:10:38.349,000 --> 0:10:4,000
then you get some notes and fixes, generally.

237
0:10:41.408,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And then, hopefully, you get a final,

238
0:10:43.869,000 --> 0:10:45,000
signaling to move on to the next stage.

239
0:10:46.462,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I gave my intro, and I played the jellyfish scene.

240
0:10:50.703,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And the director was silent for an uncomfortably long amount of time.

241
0:10:55.24,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Just long enough for me to think,

242
0:10:57.771,000 --> 0:10:58,000
"Oh no, this is doomed."

243
0:11:00.919,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And then he started clapping.

244
0:11:03.381,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And then the production designer started clapping.

245
0:11:06.24,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And then the whole room was clapping.

246
0:11:14.285,000 --> 0:11:17,000
This is the moment that I live for in lighting.

247
0:11:17.395,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The moment where it all comes together

248
0:11:19.582,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and we get a world that we can believe in.

249
0:11:22.718,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We use math, science and code to create these amazing worlds.

250
0:11:27.03,000 --> 0:11:29,000
We use storytelling and art to bring them to life.

251
0:11:30.44,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It's this interweaving of art and science

252
0:11:34.475,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that elevates the world to a place of wonder,

253
0:11:38.162,000 --> 0:11:39,000
a place with soul,

254
0:11:39.819,000 --> 0:11:4,000
a place we can believe in,

255
0:11:42.262,000 --> 0:11:45,000
a place where the things you imagine can become real --

256
0:11:47.071,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and a world where a girl suddenly realizes

257
0:11:50.307,000 --> 0:11:52,000
not only is she a scientist,

258
0:11:52.491,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but also an artist.

259
0:11:54.544,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Thank you.

260
0:11:55.719,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Applause)

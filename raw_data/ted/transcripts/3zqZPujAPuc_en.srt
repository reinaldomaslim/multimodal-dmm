1
0:00:12.917,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Guatemala is recovering from a 36-year armed conflict.

2
0:00:16.085,000 --> 0:00:18,000
A conflict that was fought during the Cold War.

3
0:00:18.616,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It was really just a small leftist insurgency

4
0:00:22.669,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and a devastating response by the state.

5
0:00:25.836,000 --> 0:00:27,000
What we have as a result is 200,000 civilian victims,

6
0:00:28.678,000 --> 0:00:31,000
160,000 of those killed in the communities:

7
0:00:32.332,000 --> 0:00:36,000
small children, men, women, the elderly even.

8
0:00:36.428,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And then we have about 40,000 others, the missing,

9
0:00:39.858,000 --> 0:00:41,000
the ones we're still looking for today.

10
0:00:42.178,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We call them the Desaparecidos.

11
0:00:44.738,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Now, 83 percent of the victims are Mayan victims,

12
0:00:47.603,000 --> 0:00:49,000
victims that are the descendants

13
0:00:50.008,000 --> 0:00:52,000
of the original inhabitants of Central America.

14
0:00:52.744,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And only about 17 percent are of European descent.

15
0:00:56.251,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But the most important thing here is that

16
0:00:58.308,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the very people who are supposed to defend us, the police, the military,

17
0:01:04.329,000 --> 0:01:06,000
are the ones that committed most of the crimes.

18
0:01:08.035,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now the families, they want information.

19
0:01:11.335,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They want to know what happened.

20
0:01:12.902,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They want the bodies of their loved ones.

21
0:01:15.092,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But most of all, what they want is they want you,

22
0:01:18.339,000 --> 0:01:22,000
they want everyone to know that their loved ones did nothing wrong.

23
0:01:23.515,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Now, my case was that my father received death threats in 1980.

24
0:01:29.203,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And we left.

25
0:01:30.583,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We left Guatemala and we came here.

26
0:01:32.337,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So I grew up in New York,

27
0:01:33.543,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I grew up in Brooklyn as a matter of fact, and I went to New Utrecht High School

28
0:01:37.323,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and I graduated from Brooklyn College.

29
0:01:39.141,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The only thing was that

30
0:01:40.707,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I really didn't know what was happening in Guatemala.

31
0:01:44.578,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I didn't care for it; it was too painful.

32
0:01:47.447,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But it wasn't till 1995 that I decided to do something about it.

33
0:01:51.754,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So I went back.

34
0:01:52.908,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I went back to Guatemala, to look for the bodies,

35
0:01:56.488,000 --> 0:02:,000
to understand what happened and to look for part of myself as well.

36
0:02:02.051,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The way we work is that we give people information.

37
0:02:05.414,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We talk to the family members and we let them choose.

38
0:02:08.384,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We let them decide to tell us the stories,

39
0:02:11.614,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to tell us what they saw,

40
0:02:13.466,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to tell us about their loved ones.

41
0:02:15.594,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And even more important,

42
0:02:16.88,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we let them choose to give us a piece of themselves.

43
0:02:20.878,000 --> 0:02:22,000
A piece, an essence, of who they are.

44
0:02:23.354,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And that DNA is what we're going to compare

45
0:02:25.611,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to the DNA that comes from the skeletons.

46
0:02:28.331,000 --> 0:02:31,000
While we're doing that, though, we're looking for the bodies.

47
0:02:31.386,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And these are skeletons by now,

48
0:02:33.374,000 --> 0:02:35,000
most of these crimes happened 32 years ago.

49
0:02:36.28,000 --> 0:02:37,000
When we find the grave,

50
0:02:37.526,000 --> 0:02:41,000
we take out the dirt and eventually clean the body, document it, and exhume it.

51
0:02:41.656,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We literally bring the skeleton out of the ground.

52
0:02:45.095,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Once we have those bodies, though, we take them back to the city, to our lab,

53
0:02:49.237,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and we begin a process of trying to understand mainly two things:

54
0:02:52.321,000 --> 0:02:54,000
One is how people died.

55
0:02:54.614,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So here you see a gunshot wound to the back of the head

56
0:02:57.718,000 --> 0:02:59,000
or a machete wound, for example.

57
0:03:00.367,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The other thing we want to understand is who they are.

58
0:03:03.693,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Whether it's a baby,

59
0:03:07.152,000 --> 0:03:08,000
or an adult.

60
0:03:08.809,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Whether it's a woman or a man.

61
0:03:10.949,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But when we're done with that analysis

62
0:03:12.732,000 --> 0:03:14,000
what we'll do is we'll take a small fragment of the bone

63
0:03:15.458,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and we'll extract DNA from it.

64
0:03:18.272,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We'll take that DNA

65
0:03:19.367,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and then we'll compare it with the DNA of the families, of course.

66
0:03:24.127,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The best way to explain this to you is by showing you two cases.

67
0:03:27.771,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The first is the case of the military diary.

68
0:03:30.318,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now this is a document that was smuggled out of somewhere in 1999.

69
0:03:34.993,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And what you see there is the state following individuals,

70
0:03:39.673,000 --> 0:03:42,000
people that, like you, wanted to change their country,

71
0:03:43.604,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and they jotted everything down.

72
0:03:46.484,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And one of the things that they wrote down is when they executed them.

73
0:03:50.734,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Inside that yellow rectangle, you see a code,

74
0:03:53.715,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it's a secret code: 300.

75
0:03:56.026,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And then you see a date.

76
0:03:57.523,000 --> 0:04:,000
The 300 means "executed" and the date means when they were executed.

77
0:04:01.196,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now that's going to come into play in a second.

78
0:04:05.064,000 --> 0:04:08,000
What we did is we conducted an exhumation in 2003,

79
0:04:08.689,000 --> 0:04:12,000
where we exhumed 220 bodies from 53 graves in a military base.

80
0:04:14.64,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Grave 9, though, matched the family of Sergio Saul Linares.

81
0:04:18.635,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Now Sergio was a professor at the university.

82
0:04:21.361,000 --> 0:04:23,000
He graduted from Iowa State University

83
0:04:23.752,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and went back to Guatemala to change his country.

84
0:04:26.129,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And he was captured on February 23, 1984.

85
0:04:30.003,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And if you can see there, he was executed on March 29, 1984,

86
0:04:34.092,000 --> 0:04:35,000
which was incredible.

87
0:04:35.658,000 --> 0:04:38,000
We had the body, we had the family's information and their DNA,

88
0:04:38.68,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and now we have documents that told us exactly what happened.

89
0:04:42.026,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But most important is about two weeks later,

90
0:04:45.129,000 --> 0:04:47,000
we go another hit, another match

91
0:04:47.816,000 --> 0:04:51,000
from the same grave to Amancio Villatoro.

92
0:04:52.617,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The DNA of that body also matched the DNA of that family.

93
0:04:55.363,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And then we noticed that he was also in the diary.

94
0:04:58.732,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But it was amazing to see that he was also executed on March 29, 1984.

95
0:05:03.903,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So that led us to think, hmm, how many bodies were in the grave?

96
0:05:08.226,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Six.

97
0:05:09.413,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So then we said, how many people were executed on March 29, 1984?

98
0:05:18.716,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That's right, six as well.

99
0:05:21.034,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So we have Juan de Dios, Hugo, Moises and Zoilo.

100
0:05:26.726,000 --> 0:05:29,000
All of them executed on the same date, all captured at different locations

101
0:05:30.574,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and at different moments.

102
0:05:32.328,000 --> 0:05:33,000
All put in that grave.

103
0:05:33.492,000 --> 0:05:36,000
The only thing we needed now was the DNA of those four families

104
0:05:36.636,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So we went and we looked for them and we found them.

105
0:05:39.881,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And we identified those six bodies and gave them back to the families.

106
0:05:44.344,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The other case I want to tell you about

107
0:05:46.783,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is that of a military base called CREOMPAZ.

108
0:05:50.871,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It actually means, "to believe in peace," but the acronym really means

109
0:05:55.482,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Regional Command Center for Peacekeeping Operations.

110
0:05:58.501,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And this is where the Guatemalan military trains peacekeepers from other countries,

111
0:06:03.491,000 --> 0:06:05,000
the ones that serve with the U.N.

112
0:06:06.332,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and go to countries like Haiti and the Congo.

113
0:06:09.095,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Well, we have testimony that said that within this military base,

114
0:06:12.608,000 --> 0:06:14,000
there were bodies, there were graves.

115
0:06:14.713,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So we went in there with a search warrant and about two hours after we went in,

116
0:06:18.568,000 --> 0:06:23,000
we found the first of 84 graves, a total of 533 bodies.

117
0:06:24.192,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Now, if you think about that,

118
0:06:26.829,000 --> 0:06:29,000
peacekeepers being trained on top of bodies.

119
0:06:30.166,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's very ironic.

120
0:06:33.545,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But the bodies -- face down, most of them, hands tied behind their backs,

121
0:06:38.802,000 --> 0:06:4,000
blindfolded, all types of trauma --

122
0:06:41.426,000 --> 0:06:44,000
these were people who were defenseless who were being executed.

123
0:06:44.505,000 --> 0:06:48,000
People that 533 families are looking for.

124
0:06:48.53,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So we're going to focus on Grave 15.

125
0:06:51.142,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Grave 15, what we noticed, was a grave full of women and children,

126
0:06:54.838,000 --> 0:06:56,000
63 of them.

127
0:06:57.041,000 --> 0:07:,000
And that immediately made us think,

128
0:07:00.269,000 --> 0:07:02,000
my goodness, where is there a case like this?

129
0:07:02.544,000 --> 0:07:04,000
When I got to Guatemala in 1995,

130
0:07:05.237,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I heard of a case of a massacre that happened on May 14, 1982,

131
0:07:09.888,000 --> 0:07:12,000
where the army came in, killed the men,

132
0:07:13.021,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and took the women and children in helicopters to an unknown location.

133
0:07:18.026,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Well, guess what?

134
0:07:18.968,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The clothing from this grave matched the clothing from the region

135
0:07:23.161,000 --> 0:07:24,000
where these people were taken from,

136
0:07:24.891,000 --> 0:07:26,000
where these women and children were taken from.

137
0:07:27.274,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So we conducted some DNA analysis, and guess what?

138
0:07:30.767,000 --> 0:07:32,000
We identified Martina Rojas and Manuel Chen.

139
0:07:33.034,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Both of them disappeared in that case, and now we could prove it.

140
0:07:36.109,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We have physical evidence that proves that this happened

141
0:07:39.119,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and that those people were taken to this base.

142
0:07:41.86,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Now, Manuel Chen was three years old.

143
0:07:45.118,000 --> 0:07:49,000
His mother went to the river to wash clothes, and she left him with a neighbor.

144
0:07:49.985,000 --> 0:07:5,000
That's when the army came

145
0:07:51.689,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and that's when he was taken away in a helicopter and never seen again

146
0:07:55.029,000 --> 0:07:56,000
until we found him in Grave 15.

147
0:07:57.008,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So now with science, with archaeology, with anthropology, with genetics,

148
0:08:02.726,000 --> 0:08:05,000
what we're doing is, we're giving a voice to the voiceless.

149
0:08:05.96,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But we're doing more than that.

150
0:08:07.645,000 --> 0:08:09,000
We're actually providing evidence for trials,

151
0:08:09.81,000 --> 0:08:12,000
like the genocide trial that happened last year in Guatemala

152
0:08:13.332,000 --> 0:08:17,000
where General Ríos Montt was found guilty of genocide and sentenced to 80 years.

153
0:08:18.142,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So I came here to tell you today that this is happening everywhere --

154
0:08:21.787,000 --> 0:08:23,000
it's happening in Mexico right in front of us today --

155
0:08:24.511,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and we can't let it go on anymore.

156
0:08:26.451,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We have to now come together and decide

157
0:08:29.352,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that we're not going to have any more missing.

158
0:08:31.573,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So no more missing, guys.

159
0:08:32.765,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Okay? No more missing.

160
0:08:35.476,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Thank you.

161
0:08:36.719,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Applause)

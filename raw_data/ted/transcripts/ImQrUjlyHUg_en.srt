1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Each of you possesses

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the most powerful, dangerous and subversive trait

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that natural selection has ever devised.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's a piece of neural audio technology

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
for rewiring other people's minds.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I'm talking about your language, of course,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
directly into someone else's mind,

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and they can attempt to do the same to you,

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
without either of you having to perform surgery.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Instead, when you speak,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
you're actually using a form of telemetry

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
not so different

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
from the remote control device for your television.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's just that, whereas that device

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
relies on pulses of infrared light,

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
your language relies on pulses,

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
discrete pulses, of sound.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And just as you use the remote control device

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to alter the internal settings of your television

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to suit your mood,

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
you use your language

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to alter the settings inside someone else's brain

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to suit your interests.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Languages are genes talking,

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
getting things that they want.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
when it first discovers that, merely by uttering a sound,

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
it can get objects to move across a room

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
as if by magic,

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and maybe even into its mouth.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now language's subversive power

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
has been recognized throughout the ages

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in censorship, in books you can't read,

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
phrases you can't use

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and words you can't say.

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
In fact, the Tower of Babel story in the Bible

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
is a fable and warning

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
about the power of language.

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
According to that story, early humans developed the conceit

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that, by using their language to work together,

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
they could build a tower

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that would take them all the way to heaven.

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Now God, angered at this attempt to usurp his power,

45
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
destroyed the tower,

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and then to ensure

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that it would never be rebuilt,

48
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
he scattered the people by giving them different languages --

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
confused them by giving them different languages.

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And this leads to the wonderful irony

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating.

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Even today,

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
we know that there are words we cannot use,

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
phrases we cannot say,

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because if we do so,

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
we might be accosted, jailed,

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
or even killed.

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And all of this from a puff of air

59
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
emanating from our mouths.

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now all this fuss about a single one of our traits

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
tells us there's something worth explaining.

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And that is how and why

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
did this remarkable trait evolve,

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and why did it evolve

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
only in our species?

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Now it's a little bit of a surprise

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that to get an answer to that question,

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
we have to go to tool use

69
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in the chimpanzees.

70
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now these chimpanzees are using tools,

71
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and we take that as a sign of their intelligence.

72
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But if they really were intelligent,

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
why would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground

74
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
rather than a shovel?

75
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And if they really were intelligent,

76
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
why would they crack open nuts with a rock?

77
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Why wouldn't they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts

78
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that somebody else had already cracked open for them?

79
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Why not? I mean, that's what we do.

80
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Now the reason the chimpanzees don't do that

81
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
social learning.

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They seem to lack the ability

84
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to learn from others

85
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
by copying or imitating

86
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
or simply watching.

87
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
As a result,

88
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
they can't improve on others' ideas

89
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
or learn from others' mistakes --

90
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
benefit from others' wisdom.

91
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And so they just do the same thing

92
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
over and over and over again.

93
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
In fact, we could go away for a million years and come back

94
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing

95
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
with the same sticks for the termites

96
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and the same rocks to crack open the nuts.

97
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now this may sound arrogant, or even full of hubris.

98
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
How do we know this?

99
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Because this is exactly what our ancestors, the Homo erectus, did.

100
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
These upright apes

101
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
evolved on the African savanna

102
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
about two million years ago,

103
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and they made these splendid hand axes

104
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that fit wonderfully into your hands.

105
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But if we look at the fossil record,

106
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
we see that they made the same hand axe

107
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
over and over and over again

108
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
for one million years.

109
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You can follow it through the fossil record.

110
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Now if we make some guesses about how long Homo erectus lived,

111
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
what their generation time was,

112
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that's about 40,000 generations

113
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
of parents to offspring, and other individuals watching,

114
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in which that hand axe didn't change.

115
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
It's not even clear

116
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that our very close genetic relatives, the Neanderthals,

117
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
had social learning.

118
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Sure enough, their tools were more complicated

119
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
than those of Homo erectus,

120
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
but they too showed very little change

121
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
over the 300,000 years or so

122
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that those species, the Neanderthals,

123
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
lived in Eurasia.

124
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Okay, so what this tells us

125
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
is that, contrary to the old adage,

126
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
"monkey see, monkey do,"

127
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the surprise really is

128
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that all of the other animals

129
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
really cannot do that -- at least not very much.

130
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And even this picture

131
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it --

132
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
something from a Barnum & Bailey circus.

133
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But by comparison,

134
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
we can learn.

135
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We can learn by watching other people

136
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and copying or imitating

137
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
what they can do.

138
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We can then choose, from among a range of options,

139
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the best one.

140
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
We can benefit from others' ideas.

141
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We can build on their wisdom.

142
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And as a result, our ideas do accumulate,

143
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and our technology progresses.

144
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And this cumulative cultural adaptation,

145
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
as anthropologists call

146
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
this accumulation of ideas,

147
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
is responsible for everything around you

148
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in your bustling and teeming everyday lives.

149
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I mean the world has changed out of all proportion

150
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to what we would recognize

151
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
even 1,000 or 2,000 years ago.

152
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation.

153
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The chairs you're sitting in, the lights in this auditorium,

154
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
my microphone, the iPads and iPods that you carry around with you --

155
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
all are a result

156
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of cumulative cultural adaptation.

157
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Now to many commentators,

158
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
cumulative cultural adaptation, or social learning,

159
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
is job done, end of story.

160
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Our species can make stuff,

161
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
therefore we prospered in a way that no other species has.

162
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
In fact, we can even make the "stuff of life" --

163
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
as I just said, all the stuff around us.

164
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But in fact, it turns out

165
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that some time around 200,000 years ago,

166
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
when our species first arose

167
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and acquired social learning,

168
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that this was really the beginning of our story,

169
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
not the end of our story.

170
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Because our acquisition of social learning

171
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
would create a social and evolutionary dilemma,

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
the resolution of which, it's fair to say,

173
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
would determine not only the future course of our psychology,

174
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but the future course of the entire world.

175
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And most importantly for this,

176
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
it'll tell us why we have language.

177
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And the reason that dilemma arose

178
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is, it turns out, that social learning is visual theft.

179
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
If I can learn by watching you,

180
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I can steal your best ideas,

181
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and I can benefit from your efforts,

182
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
without having to put in the time and energy that you did

183
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
into developing them.

184
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
If I can watch which lure you use to catch a fish,

185
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
or I can watch how you flake your hand axe

186
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to make it better,

187
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
or if I follow you secretly to your mushroom patch,

188
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills,

189
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and maybe even catch that fish

190
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
before you do.

191
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Social learning really is visual theft.

192
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And in any species that acquired it,

193
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
it would behoove you

194
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to hide your best ideas,

195
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
lest somebody steal them from you.

196
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And so some time around 200,000 years ago,

197
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
our species confronted this crisis.

198
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And we really had only two options

199
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
for dealing with the conflicts

200
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that visual theft would bring.

201
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
One of those options

202
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
was that we could have retreated

203
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
into small family groups.

204
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge

205
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
would flow just to our relatives.

206
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Had we chosen this option,

207
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
sometime around 200,000 years ago,

208
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
we would probably still be living like the Neanderthals were

209
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
when we first entered Europe 40,000 years ago.

210
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And this is because in small groups

211
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
there are fewer ideas, there are fewer innovations.

212
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck.

213
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So if we'd chosen that path,

214
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
our evolutionary path would have led into the forest --

215
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and been a short one indeed.

216
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
The other option we could choose

217
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
was to develop the systems of communication

218
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
that would allow us to share ideas

219
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and to cooperate amongst others.

220
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Choosing this option would mean

221
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom

222
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
would become available to any one individual

223
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
than would ever arise from within an individual family

224
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
or an individual person on their own.

225
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Well, we chose the second option,

226
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and language is the result.

227
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Language evolved to solve the crisis

228
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
of visual theft.

229
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Language is a piece of social technology

230
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
for enhancing the benefits of cooperation --

231
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
for reaching agreements, for striking deals

232
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and for coordinating our activities.

233
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And you can see that, in a developing society

234
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that was beginning to acquire language,

235
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
not having language

236
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
would be a like a bird without wings.

237
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Just as wings open up this sphere of air

238
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
for birds to exploit,

239
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
language opened up the sphere of cooperation

240
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
for humans to exploit.

241
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
And we take this utterly for granted,

242
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because we're a species that is so at home with language,

243
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but you have to realize

244
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in

245
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
are utterly dependent upon language.

246
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And to see why, consider two scenarios

247
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
from early in our evolution.

248
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Let's imagine that you are really good

249
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
at making arrowheads,

250
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but you're hopeless at making the wooden shafts

251
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
with the flight feathers attached.

252
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts,

253
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but they're hopeless at making the arrowheads.

254
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So what you do is --

255
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
one of those people has not really acquired language yet.

256
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And let's pretend the other one is good at language skills.

257
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads,

258
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and you walk up to the one that can't speak very well,

259
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and you put the arrowheads down in front of him,

260
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
hoping that he'll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads

261
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
for finished arrows.

262
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But he looks at the pile of arrowheads, thinks they're a gift,

263
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
picks them up, smiles and walks off.

264
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Now you pursue this guy, gesticulating.

265
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
A scuffle ensues and you get stabbed

266
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
with one of your own arrowheads.

267
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Okay, now replay this scene now, and you're approaching the one who has language.

268
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
You put down your arrowheads and say,

269
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
"I'd like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows. I'll split you 50/50."

270
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The other one says, "Fine. Looks good to me.

271
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We'll do that."

272
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Now the job is done.

273
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Once we have language,

274
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we can put our ideas together and cooperate

275
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to have a prosperity

276
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that we couldn't have before we acquired it.

277
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And this is why our species

278
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
has prospered around the world

279
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
while the rest of the animals

280
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
sit behind bars in zoos, languishing.

281
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
That's why we build space shuttles and cathedrals

282
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground

283
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to extract termites.

284
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
All right, if this view of language

285
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and its value

286
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
in solving the crisis of visual theft is true,

287
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
any species that acquires it

288
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
should show an explosion of creativity and prosperity.

289
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And this is exactly what the archeological record shows.

290
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
If you look at our ancestors,

291
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
the Neanderthals and the Homo erectus, our immediate ancestors,

292
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
they're confined to small regions of the world.

293
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But when our species arose

294
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
about 200,000 years ago,

295
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
sometime after that we quickly walked out of Africa

296
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and spread around the entire world,

297
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
occupying nearly every habitat on Earth.

298
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Now whereas other species are confined

299
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to places that their genes adapt them to,

300
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
with social learning and language,

301
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
we could transform the environment

302
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to suit our needs.

303
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And so we prospered in a way

304
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that no other animal has.

305
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Language really is

306
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
the most potent trait that has ever evolved.

307
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
It is the most valuable trait we have

308
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
for converting new lands and resources

309
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
into more people and their genes

310
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that natural selection has ever devised.

311
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Language really is

312
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
the voice of our genes.

313
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Now having evolved language, though,

314
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
we did something peculiar,

315
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
even bizarre.

316
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
As we spread out around the world,

317
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
we developed thousands of different languages.

318
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Currently, there are about seven or 8,000

319
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
different languages spoken on Earth.

320
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Now you might say, well, this is just natural.

321
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
As we diverge, our languages are naturally going to diverge.

322
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
But the real puzzle and irony

323
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
is that the greatest density of different languages on Earth

324
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
is found where people are most tightly packed together.

325
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
If we go to the island of Papua New Guinea,

326
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
we can find about 800 to 1,000

327
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
distinct human languages,

328
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
different human languages,

329
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
spoken on that island alone.

330
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
There are places on that island

331
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
where you can encounter a new language

332
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
every two or three miles.

333
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Now, incredible as this sounds,

334
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I once met a Papuan man, and I asked him if this could possibly be true.

335
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And he said to me, "Oh no.

336
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
They're far closer together than that."

337
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And it's true; there are places on that island

338
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
where you can encounter a new language in under a mile.

339
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands.

340
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And so it seems that we use our language,

341
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
not just to cooperate,

342
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
but to draw rings around our cooperative groups

343
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and to establish identities,

344
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills

345
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
from eavesdropping from outside.

346
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And we know this

347
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
because when we study different language groups

348
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and associate them with their cultures,

349
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
we see that different languages

350
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
slow the flow of ideas between groups.

351
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
They slow the flow of technologies.

352
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And they even slow the flow of genes.

353
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Now I can't speak for you,

354
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
but it seems to be the case

355
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that we don't have sex with people we can't talk to.

356
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
(Laughter)

357
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Now we have to counter that, though,

358
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
against the evidence we've heard

359
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances

360
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans.

361
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
(Laughter)

362
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Okay, this tendency we have,

363
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
this seemingly natural tendency we have,

364
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
towards isolation, towards keeping to ourselves,

365
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
crashes head first into our modern world.

366
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
This remarkable image

367
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
is not a map of the world.

368
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
In fact, it's a map of Facebook friendship links.

369
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And when you plot those friendship links

370
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
by their latitude and longitude,

371
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
it literally draws a map of the world.

372
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Our modern world is communicating

373
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
with itself and with each other

374
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
more than it has

375
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
at any time in its past.

376
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And that communication, that connectivity around the world,

377
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
that globalization

378
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
now raises a burden.

379
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Because these different languages

380
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
impose a barrier, as we've just seen,

381
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
to the transfer of goods and ideas

382
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and technologies and wisdom.

383
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And they impose a barrier to cooperation.

384
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And nowhere do we see that more clearly

385
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
than in the European Union,

386
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
whose 27 member countries

387
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
speak 23 official languages.

388
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
The European Union

389
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
is now spending over one billion euros annually

390
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
translating among their 23 official languages.

391
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
That's something on the order

392
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
of 1.45 billion U.S. dollars

393
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
on translation costs alone.

394
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Now think of the absurdity of this situation.

395
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
If 27 individuals

396
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
from those 27 member states

397
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
sat around table, speaking their 23 languages,

398
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
some very simple mathematics will tell you

399
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
that you need an army of 253 translators

400
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
to anticipate all the pairwise possibilities.

401
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
The European Union employs a permanent staff

402
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
of about 2,500 translators.

403
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And in 2007 alone --

404
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and I'm sure there are more recent figures --

405
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
something on the order of 1.3 million pages

406
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
were translated into English alone.

407
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And so if language really is

408
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
the solution to the crisis of visual theft,

409
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
if language really is

410
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
the conduit of our cooperation,

411
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
the technology that our species derived

412
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas,

413
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
in our modern world,

414
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
we confront a question.

415
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And that question is whether

416
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
in this modern, globalized world

417
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
we can really afford to have all these different languages.

418
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
To put it this way, nature knows no other circumstance

419
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
in which functionally equivalent traits coexist.

420
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
One of them always drives the other extinct.

421
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
And we see this in the inexorable march

422
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
towards standardization.

423
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
There are lots and lots of ways of measuring things --

424
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
weighing them and measuring their length --

425
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
but the metric system is winning.

426
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
There are lots and lots of ways of measuring time,

427
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
but a really bizarre base 60 system

428
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
known as hours and minutes and seconds

429
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
is nearly universal around the world.

430
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
There are many, many ways

431
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
of imprinting CDs or DVDs,

432
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
but those are all being standardized as well.

433
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
And you can probably think of many, many more

434
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
in your own everyday lives.

435
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
And so our modern world now

436
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
is confronting us with a dilemma.

437
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And it's the dilemma

438
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
that this Chinese man faces,

439
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
who's language is spoken

440
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
by more people in the world

441
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
than any other single language,

442
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
and yet he is sitting at his blackboard,

443
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
converting Chinese phrases

444
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
into English language phrases.

445
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
And what this does is it raises the possibility to us

446
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
that in a world in which we want to promote

447
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
cooperation and exchange,

448
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and in a world that might be dependent more than ever before

449
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
on cooperation

450
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
to maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity,

451
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
his actions suggest to us

452
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
it might be inevitable

453
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
that we have to confront the idea

454
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
that our destiny is to be one world with one language.

455
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:53,000
Thank you.

456
0:18:53.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
(Applause)

457
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
Matt Ridley: Mark, one question.

458
0:19:03.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Svante found that the FOXP2 gene,

459
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
which seems to be associated with language,

460
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
was also shared in the same form

461
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
in Neanderthals as us.

462
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
Do we have any idea

463
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
how we could have defeated Neanderthals

464
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
if they also had language?

465
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Mark Pagel: This is a very good question.

466
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
So many of you will be familiar with the idea that there's this gene called FOXP2

467
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
that seems to be implicated in some ways

468
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
in the fine motor control that's associated with language.

469
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
The reason why I don't believe that tells us

470
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
that the Neanderthals had language

471
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
is -- here's a simple analogy:

472
0:19:36.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
Ferraris are cars that have engines.

473
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
My car has an engine,

474
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
but it's not a Ferrari.

475
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
Now the simple answer then

476
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
is that genes alone don't, all by themselves,

477
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:49,000
determine the outcome

478
0:19:49.26,000 --> 0:19:51,000
of very complicated things like language.

479
0:19:51.26,000 --> 0:19:53,000
What we know about this FOXP2 and Neanderthals

480
0:19:53.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths -- who knows.

481
0:19:57.26,000 --> 0:19:59,000
But that doesn't tell us they necessarily had language.

482
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:01,000
MR: Thank you very much indeed.

483
0:20:01.26,000 --> 0:20:04,000
(Applause)

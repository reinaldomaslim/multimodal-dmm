1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
What's happening to the climate?

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It is unbelievably bad.

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
This is, obviously, that famous view now of the Arctic,

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
which is likely to be gone at this point

5
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in the next three or four or five years. Very, very, very scary.

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So we all look at what we can do.

7
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2,

8
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
52 percent are tied to buildings.

9
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Only nine percent is passenger cars, interestingly enough.

10
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So we ran off to a sushi bar.

11
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea.

12
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And it was something called EcoRock.

13
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old

14
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
gypsum drywall process that generates

15
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
20 billion pounds of CO2 a year.

16
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So it was a big idea. We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent,

17
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
which is exactly what we've done.

18
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We started R&D in 2006.

19
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Decided to use recycled content from cement

20
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and steel manufacturing.

21
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
There is the inside of our lab. We haven't shown this before.

22
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But our people had to do some 5,000

23
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
different mixes to get this right, to hit our targets.

24
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And they worked absolutely very, very, very hard.

25
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So then we went forward and built our production line in China.

26
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We don't build this production equipment any longer in the U.S., unfortunately.

27
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We did the line install over the summer.

28
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We started right there, with absolutely nothing.

29
0:01:25.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
You're seeing for the first time, a brand new drywall production line,

30
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
not made using gypsum at all.

31
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
That's the finished production line there.

32
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We got our first panel out on December third.

33
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
That is the slurry being poured onto paper, basically. That's the line running.

34
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The exciting thing is, look at the faces of the people.

35
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
These are people who worked this project for two to three years.

36
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And they are so excited. That's the first board off the line.

37
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board. Obviously very, very excited.

38
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But this has a huge, huge impact on the environment.

39
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that, had a great signing ceremony,

40
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
leading to people hopefully using these products across the world.

41
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And we've got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing.

42
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We happened to win, just recently, the Green Product of the Year

43
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
for "The Re-Invention of Drywall," from Popular Science.

44
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Thank you. Thank you.

45
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So here is what we learned: 8,000 gallons of gas

46
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
equivalent to build one house.

47
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You probably had no idea. It's like driving around the world six times.

48
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We must change everything.

49
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Look around the room: chairs, wood,

50
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
everything around us has to change or we're not going to lick this problem.

51
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Don't listen to the people who say you can't do this, because anyone can.

52
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And these job losses, we can fix them with green-collar jobs.

53
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We've got four plants. We're building this stuff around the country.

54
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We're going as fast as we can.

55
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum,

56
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
you know, CO2 generated. Right?

57
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So what will you do? I'll tell you what I did and why I did it. And I know my time's up.

58
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Those are my kids, Natalie and David.

59
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
When they have their kids, 2050,

60
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
they'd better look back at Grandpa and say,

61
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"Hey, you gave it a good shot. You did the best you could

62
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
with the team that you had."

63
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So my hope is that when you leave TED,

64
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
you will look at reducing your carbon footprint

65
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in however you can do it.

66
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And if you don't know how, please find me -- I will help you.

67
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Last but not least, Bill Gates, I know you invented Windows.

68
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Wait till you see, maybe next year, what kind of windows we've invented.

69
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Thank you so much.

70
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Applause)

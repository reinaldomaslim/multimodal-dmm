2
0:00:13.522,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, I'm going to start off with kind of the buzzkill a little bit.

3
0:00:17.5,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Forty-two million people

4
0:00:19.631,000 --> 0:00:22,000
were displaced by natural disasters in 2010.

5
0:00:22.741,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Now, there was nothing particularly special about 2010,

6
0:00:25.812,000 --> 0:00:28,000
because, on average, 31 and a half million people

7
0:00:29.108,000 --> 0:00:32,000
are displaced by natural disasters every single year.

8
0:00:32.211,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Now, usually when people hear statistics or stats like that,

9
0:00:34.759,000 --> 0:00:36,000
you start thinking about places like Haiti or other kind of

10
0:00:37.553,000 --> 0:00:4,000
exotic or maybe even impoverished areas, but it happens

11
0:00:40.973,000 --> 0:00:43,000
right here in the United States every single year.

12
0:00:44.096,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Last year alone, 99 federally declared disasters

13
0:00:47.111,000 --> 0:00:49,000
were on file with FEMA,

14
0:00:49.357,000 --> 0:00:52,000
from Joplin, Missouri, and Tuscaloosa, Alabama,

15
0:00:52.548,000 --> 0:00:56,000
to the Central Texas wildfires that just happened recently.

16
0:00:56.939,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now, how does the most powerful country in the world

17
0:00:59.004,000 --> 0:01:01,000
handle these displaced people?

18
0:01:01.103,000 --> 0:01:03,000
They cram them onto cots, put all your personal belongings

19
0:01:03.532,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in a plastic garbage bag, stick it underneath,

20
0:01:05.7,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and put you on the floor of an entire sports arena,

21
0:01:08.715,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or a gymnasium.

22
0:01:12.226,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So obviously there's a massive housing gap,

23
0:01:15.288,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and this really upset me, because academia tells you

24
0:01:18.196,000 --> 0:01:2,000
after a major disaster, there's typically about

25
0:01:20.485,000 --> 0:01:23,000
an 18-month time frame to -- we kinda recover,

26
0:01:23.824,000 --> 0:01:24,000
start the recovery process,

27
0:01:25.401,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but what most people don't realize is that on average

28
0:01:27.766,000 --> 0:01:3,000
it takes 45 to 60 days or more

29
0:01:30.83,000 --> 0:01:32,000
for the infamous FEMA trailers to even begin to show up.

30
0:01:33.692,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Before that time, people are left to their own devices.

31
0:01:37.31,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So I became obsessed with trying to figure out a way

32
0:01:40.686,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to actually fill this gap.

33
0:01:42.836,000 --> 0:01:44,000
This actually became my creative obsession.

34
0:01:45.39,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I put aside all my freelance work after hours and started

35
0:01:48.095,000 --> 0:01:53,000
just focusing particularly on this problem.

36
0:01:53.837,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So I started sketching.

37
0:01:55.196,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Two days after Katrina, I started sketching and sketching

38
0:01:57.22,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and trying to brainstorm up ideas or solutions for this,

39
0:01:59.068,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and as things started to congeal or ideas started to form,

40
0:02:02.226,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I started sketching digitally on the computer,

41
0:02:04.452,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but it was an obsession, so I couldn't just stop there.

42
0:02:07.921,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I started experimenting, making models,

43
0:02:10.06,000 --> 0:02:12,000
talking to experts in the field, taking their feedback,

44
0:02:12.838,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and refining, and I kept on refining and refining

45
0:02:15.749,000 --> 0:02:18,000
for nights and weekends for over five years.

46
0:02:18.805,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now, my obsession ended up driving me to create

47
0:02:22.29,000 --> 0:02:24,000
full-size prototypes in my own backyard — (Laughter) —

48
0:02:24.575,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and actually spending my own personal savings on

49
0:02:26.941,000 --> 0:02:28,000
everything from tooling to patents

50
0:02:29.19,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and a variety of other costs,

51
0:02:31.806,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but in the end I ended up with this modular housing system

52
0:02:34.67,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that can react to any situation or disaster.

53
0:02:37.332,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It can be put up in any environment,

54
0:02:40.431,000 --> 0:02:43,000
from an asphalt parking lot to pastures or fields,

55
0:02:44.374,000 --> 0:02:46,000
because it doesn't require any special setup

56
0:02:46.377,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or specialty tools.

57
0:02:48.559,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Now, at the foundation and kind of the core

58
0:02:50.279,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of this whole system is the Exo Housing Unit,

59
0:02:53.213,000 --> 0:02:55,000
which is just the individual shelter module.

60
0:02:55.646,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And though it's light, light enough that you can actually

61
0:02:57.378,000 --> 0:02:59,000
lift it by hand and move it around,

62
0:02:59.534,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and it actually sleeps four people.

63
0:03:03.237,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And you can arrange these things as kind of more

64
0:03:05.901,000 --> 0:03:07,000
for encampments and more of a city grid type layout,

65
0:03:08.676,000 --> 0:03:09,000
or you can circle the wagons, essentially,

66
0:03:10.571,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and form these circular pods out of them,

67
0:03:12.582,000 --> 0:03:14,000
which give you this semi-private communal area

68
0:03:15.038,000 --> 0:03:17,000
for people to actually spill out into so they're not actually

69
0:03:17.807,000 --> 0:03:19,000
trapped inside these units.

70
0:03:19.906,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Now this fundamentally changes

71
0:03:22.331,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the way we respond to disasters,

72
0:03:24.489,000 --> 0:03:25,000
because gone are the horrid conditions

73
0:03:26.467,000 --> 0:03:28,000
inside a sports arena or a gymnasium, where people

74
0:03:29.192,000 --> 0:03:31,000
are crammed on these cots inside.

75
0:03:31.204,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now we have instant neighborhoods outside.

76
0:03:36.791,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So the Exo is designed to be simply, basically

77
0:03:39.766,000 --> 0:03:41,000
like a coffee cup. They can actually stack together

78
0:03:42.008,000 --> 0:03:44,000
so we get extremely efficient transportation

79
0:03:44.933,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and storage out of them.

80
0:03:47.184,000 --> 0:03:51,000
In fact, 15 Exos can fit on a single semi truck by itself.

81
0:03:51.82,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This means the Exo can actually be transported and set up

82
0:03:54.994,000 --> 0:03:58,000
faster than any other housing option available today.

83
0:03:59.978,000 --> 0:04:,000
But I'm obsessive, so I couldn't just stop there,

84
0:04:01.967,000 --> 0:04:02,000
so I actually started modifying the bunks where you could

85
0:04:03.856,000 --> 0:04:05,000
actually slide out the bunks and slide in desks or shelving,

86
0:04:06.164,000 --> 0:04:07,000
so the same unit can now be used

87
0:04:07.676,000 --> 0:04:1,000
for an office or storage location.

88
0:04:10.901,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The doors can actually swap out, so you can actually put on

89
0:04:14.619,000 --> 0:04:16,000
a rigid panel with a window unit in it for climate control,

90
0:04:17.488,000 --> 0:04:19,000
or a connector module that would allow you to actually

91
0:04:19.954,000 --> 0:04:21,000
connect multiple units together, which gives you

92
0:04:22.339,000 --> 0:04:25,000
larger and kind of compartmentalized living spaces,

93
0:04:26.005,000 --> 0:04:28,000
so now this same kit of parts, this same unit

94
0:04:28.317,000 --> 0:04:32,000
can actually serve as a living room, bedroom or bathroom,

95
0:04:32.96,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or an office, a living space and secure storage.

96
0:04:39.067,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Sounds like a great idea, but how do you make it real?

97
0:04:42.134,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So the first idea I had, initially, was just

98
0:04:44.138,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to go the federal and state governments and go,

99
0:04:45.994,000 --> 0:04:47,000
"Here, take it, for free."

100
0:04:48.657,000 --> 0:04:49,000
But I was quickly told that, "Boy, our government

101
0:04:50.64,000 --> 0:04:52,000
doesn't really work like that." (Laughter)

102
0:04:52.898,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Okay. Okay. So maybe I would start a nonprofit

103
0:04:56.883,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to kind of help consult and get this idea going

104
0:04:59.726,000 --> 0:05:01,000
along with the government, but then I was told,

105
0:05:01.829,000 --> 0:05:03,000
"Son, our government looks to private sector

106
0:05:04.304,000 --> 0:05:05,000
for things like this."

107
0:05:05.901,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Okay. So maybe I would take this whole idea and go

108
0:05:08.891,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to private corporations that would have this mutually shared

109
0:05:11.311,000 --> 0:05:13,000
benefit to it, but I was quickly told by some corporations

110
0:05:14.214,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that my personal passion project was not a brand fit

111
0:05:18.495,000 --> 0:05:2,000
because they didn't want their logos stamped

112
0:05:21.073,000 --> 0:05:23,000
across the ghettos of Haiti.

113
0:05:23.497,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now, I wasn't just obsessed. I was outraged. (Laughter.)

114
0:05:29.433,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So I decided, kind of told myself,

115
0:05:33.85,000 --> 0:05:38,000
"Oh yeah? Watch this. I'll do it myself." (Laughter)

116
0:05:39.725,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Now, this quickly, my day job sent me to work out of

117
0:05:41.905,000 --> 0:05:44,000
our Milan office for a few months, so I was like,

118
0:05:45.059,000 --> 0:05:47,000
what will I do? So I actually scheduled sleep on my calendar,

119
0:05:47.796,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and spent the 8-hour time difference on conference calls

120
0:05:50.996,000 --> 0:05:54,000
with material suppliers, manufacturers and potential customers.

121
0:05:55.016,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And we found through this whole process, we found

122
0:05:56.47,000 --> 0:05:58,000
this great little manufacturer in Virginia,

123
0:05:58.844,000 --> 0:06:,000
and if his body language is any indication,

124
0:06:00.997,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that's the owner — (Laughter) — of what it's like

125
0:06:03.076,000 --> 0:06:05,000
for a manufacturer to work directly with a designer,

126
0:06:05.169,000 --> 0:06:08,000
you've got to see what happens here. (Laughter)

127
0:06:08.372,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But G.S. Industries was fantastic.

128
0:06:10.628,000 --> 0:06:14,000
They actually built three prototypes for us by hand.

129
0:06:15.008,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So now we have prototypes that can show that four people

130
0:06:18.155,000 --> 0:06:2,000
can actually sleep securely and much more comfortably

131
0:06:20.571,000 --> 0:06:24,000
than a tent could ever provide.

132
0:06:25.068,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And they actually shipped them here to Texas for us.

133
0:06:26.818,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now, a funny thing started happening.

134
0:06:28.271,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Other people started to believe in what we were doing,

135
0:06:30.739,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and actually offered us hangar space, donated hangar

136
0:06:32.656,000 --> 0:06:34,000
space to us. And then the Georgetown Airport Authority

137
0:06:34.94,000 --> 0:06:38,000
was bent over backwards to help us with anything we needed.

138
0:06:39.046,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So now we had a hangar space to work in,

139
0:06:40.707,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and prototypes to demo with.

140
0:06:43.789,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So in one year, we've negotiated manufacturing agreements,

141
0:06:47.356,000 --> 0:06:49,000
been awarded one patent, filed our second patent,

142
0:06:50.017,000 --> 0:06:52,000
talked to multiple people, demoed this to FEMA

143
0:06:52.7,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and its consultants to rave reviews,

144
0:06:54.948,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and then started talking to some other people who requested

145
0:06:57.131,000 --> 0:06:59,000
information, this little group called the United Nations.

146
0:06:59.622,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And on top of that, now we have

147
0:07:01.727,000 --> 0:07:03,000
a whole plethora of other individuals that have come up

148
0:07:04.371,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and started to talk to us from doing it for mining camps,

149
0:07:07.862,000 --> 0:07:09,000
mobile youth hostels, right down to the World Cup

150
0:07:10.294,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and the Olympics.

151
0:07:12.879,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So, in closing, on this whole thing here

152
0:07:19.971,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is hopefully very soon we will not have to

153
0:07:24.627,000 --> 0:07:25,000
respond to these painful phone calls that we get

154
0:07:26.548,000 --> 0:07:27,000
after disasters where we don't really have anything

155
0:07:28.544,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to sell or give you yet.

156
0:07:30.932,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Hopefully very soon we will be there,

157
0:07:33.364,000 --> 0:07:35,000
because we are destined,

158
0:07:35.571,000 --> 0:07:39,000
obsessed with making it real.

159
0:07:39.677,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
There's a lot of exciting things happening in the design world

2
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and at IDEO this past year,

3
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I'm pleased to get a chance to share some of those with you.

4
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I didn't attend the first TED back in 1984

5
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but I've been to a lot of them since that time.

6
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I thought it [would] kind of be interesting to think back to that time

7
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:48,000
when Richard got the whole thing started. Thank you very much, Richard;

8
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
it's been a big, enjoyable part of my life, coming here.

9
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And so thinking back, I was thinking

10
0:00:54,000 --> 0:01:,000
those of us in Silicon Valley were really focused on products or objects --

11
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:02,000
certainly technological objects.

12
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And so it was great fun in those days, and some of those of you

13
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
who are in the audience were my clients.

14
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We'd come in with some prototype underneath a black cloth

15
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and we'd put it on the conference table,

16
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and we'd pull off the black cloth and everybody would "ooh" and "ah."

17
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
That was a really good time.

18
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And so we'll continue to focus on products, as we always have.

19
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And if you were here last year,

20
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I probably wrestled you to the floor and tried to show you my new EyeModule 2,

21
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:38,000
which was a camera that plugged into the Handspring.

22
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And I took a lot of pictures last year;

23
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
very few people knew what I was up to, but I took a lot of pictures.

24
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This year -- maybe you could show the slides --

25
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:51,000
this year we're carrying this Treo, which we had a lot to do with

26
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and helped Handspring design it.

27
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Also, though we designed it a few years ago --

28
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
it's just become ubiquitous in the last year or so --

29
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:,000
this Heartstream defibrillator which is saving lives.

30
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Maybe you've seen them in the airports? They seem to be everywhere now.

31
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Lots of lives are being saved by those.

32
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And, we're just about to announce the Zinio Reader product

33
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that I believe will make magazines even more enjoyable to read.

34
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So, we really will continue to focus on products.

35
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But something's happened in the last 18 years since Richard started TED,

36
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and that's that people like us --

37
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I know people in other places have caught onto this for a long time,

38
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but for us, we've really just started ... we've kind of

39
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
climbed Maslow's hierarchy a little bit --

40
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and so we're now focused more and more on human-centered design,

41
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:45,000
human-centeredness in an approach to design.

42
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:5,000
That really involves designing behaviors and personality into products.

43
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And I think you're starting to see that,

44
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and it's making our job even more enjoyable.

45
0:02:55,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Interestingly enough, we used to primarily build 3-D models --

46
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:05,000
you know, you've seen some today -- and 3-D renderings.

47
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Then we'd go and we'd show those as communicating our ideas.

48
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But firms like ours are having to move to a point where

49
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we get those objects that we're designing and get them in motion,

50
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
showing how they'll be used.

51
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And so in order to do that we've been forming

52
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:25,000
internal video-production groups

53
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:28,000
in order to make these kind of experience prototypes

54
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that show just what we mean about the man-machine relationship.

55
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And it's a much better way to see.

56
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It's kind of like architects who show people in their houses,

57
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:39,000
as opposed to them being empty.

58
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So I thought that I would show you a few videos

59
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to show off this new, broader definition

60
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of design in products and services and environments.

61
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I have a few of them -- they're no more than a minute

62
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
or a minute-and-a-half apiece --

63
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but I thought you might be interested in seeing some of our

64
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:07,000
work over the last year, and how it responds in video.

65
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So, Prada New York: we were asked by Rem Koolhaas

66
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and OMA to help us conceive the technology

67
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:17,000
that's in their retail store in New York.

68
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:19,000
He wanted a new kind of store -- a new one --

69
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:24,000
a store that had a cultural role as well as a retail one.

70
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And that meant actually designing custom technology

71
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:33,000
as opposed to just buying things off the shelf and putting them to use.

72
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So, there're lots of things. Everything has RF tags:

73
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:38,000
there's RF tags on the user, on the cards,

74
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
there's the staff devices that are all around the store.

75
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You pick them up, and once you see something that you're interested in,

76
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the staff person can scan them in

77
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and then they can be shown on any screen throughout the store.

78
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You can look at color, and sizes, and how it appeared on the runway, or whatever.

79
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And so then the object -- the merchandise that you're interested in --

80
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
can be scanned. It's taken into the dressing room,

81
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and in the dressing room there are scanners

82
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:09,000
so that we know exactly what clothing you have in the dressing room.

83
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We can put that up on a touch screen

84
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and you can play with that, and get more information

85
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:19,000
about the clothing that you're interested in as you're trying it on.

86
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It's been used a lot of places, but I particularly like the use here

87
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:27,000
of liquid crystal displays in the changing room.

88
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The last time I went to see this store,

89
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:32,000
there was a huge buzz about people standing outside and wondering,

90
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
"Am I going to actually get to see the people changing clothes here?"

91
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But if you push the button, of course, the whole wall goes dark.

92
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So you can try to get approval, or not, for whatever you're wearing.

93
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And then one of my favorite features of the technology

94
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:53,000
is the magic mirror, where you put on the clothes.

95
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
There's a big display in the mirror, and you can turn around --

96
0:05:57,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but there's a three second delay.

97
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So you can see what you look like from the back or all the way around, as you look.

98
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Applause)

99
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
About a year and a half ago we were asked to design

100
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:32,000
an installation in the museum --

101
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:35,000
this is a new wing of the Science Museum in London,

102
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and it's primarily about digital and biomedical issues.

103
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And a group at Itch, which is now part of IDEO,

104
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:46,000
designed this interactive wall that's about four stories tall.

105
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I don't know if anybody's seen this --

106
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
it's pretty spectacular in the room.

107
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Anyway, it's based on the London subway system.

108
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And so you can see that

109
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the goal is to bring some of the feedback

110
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that the people who had gone to the museum were giving,

111
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and get it up on the wall so everybody could see. Just for everybody to see.

112
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So you enter your information. Then, like the London tube system,

113
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the little trains go around with what you're thinking about.

114
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And then when you get to a station, it's expanded so that you can actually read it.

115
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Then when you exit the IMAX theatre on the fourth floor --

116
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
mostly teenagers coming out of there --

117
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:26,000
there's this big open space that has these tables in it

118
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that have interactive games which are quite fun,

119
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
also designed by Durrell [Bishop] and Andrew [Hirniak] of Itch.

120
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And the topics include things that the museum is about:

121
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
male fertility, choosing the sex of your baby

122
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:43,000
or what a driverless car might be like.

123
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:45,000
There's lots of room, so people can come up

124
0:07:45,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and understand what it is before they get involved.

125
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And also, it's not shown in the video, but these are very beautiful.

126
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They go to the top of the wall and when they reach all the way to the top,

127
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:58,000
after they've bounced around, they disperse into bits

128
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:,000
and go off into the atmosphere.

129
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The next video is not done by us.

130
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This is CBS Sunday Morning that aired about two weeks ago.

131
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Scott Adams ran into us

132
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and asked us if we wouldn't help to design

133
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:16,000
the ultimate cubicle for Dilbert,

134
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
which sounded like a fun thing and so we couldn't pass it up.

135
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:23,000
He's always been interested in technology in the future.

136
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Video: Scott Adams: I realized that at some point I might be

137
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the world's expert on what's wrong with cubicles.

138
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So we thought, well, wouldn't it be fun to get together

139
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:32,000
with some of the smartest design guys in the world

140
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and try to figure out if we could make the cubicle better?

141
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Narrator: Though they work in a wide-open office space

142
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:43,000
spectacularly set under San Francisco's Oakland Bay Bridge,

143
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the team built their own little cubicles

144
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:48,000
to fully experience the problems.

145
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Woman: A one-way mirror. I can look out; you can look at yourself.

146
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Narrator: They took pictures.

147
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Woman: You feel so trapped, when someone kind of leans over

148
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and you're sort of held captive there for a minute.

149
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:01,000
SA: So far it's chaos, but a lot of people are doing stuff, so that's good.

150
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We'll see what happens.

151
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Narrator: The first group builds a cubicle in which the walls are screens

152
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
for the computer and for family photos.

153
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:14,000
In the second group's scenario, the walls are alive

154
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and actually give Dilbert a group hug.

155
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Laughter)

156
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Behind the humor is the idea of making the cubicle more human.)

157
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
David Kelley: So here's the final thing, complete with orange lighting

158
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that follows the sun across -- that follows the tracks of the sun -- across the sky.

159
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So you feel that in your cubicle.

160
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And my favorite feature, which is a flower in a vase

161
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that wilts when you leave in disappointment,

162
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and then when you come back, it comes up to greet you, happy to see you.

163
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(SA: The storage is built right into the wall.)

164
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:52,000
DK: You know, it has homey touches like a built-in fish tank in the walls,

165
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:56,000
or something to be aggressive with to release tension.

166
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(SA: Customizable for the boss of your choice.)

167
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:02,000
DK: And of course: a hammock for your afternoon nap

168
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that stretches across your cubicle.

169
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(SA: Life would be sweet in a cubicle like this.)

170
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:15,000
DK: This next project, we were asked to design a pavilion to celebrate

171
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:19,000
the recycling of the water on the Millennium Dome in London.

172
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:22,000
The dome has an incredible amount of water that washes off of it,

173
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:24,000
as well as wastewater.

174
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So this building actually celebrates the water

175
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:3,000
as it comes out of the recycling plant and goes into the reed bed

176
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:33,000
so that it can be filtered for the final time.

177
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:39,000
The pavilion's design goal was to be kind of quiet and peaceful.

178
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:42,000
In contrast to if you went inside the dome, where it's

179
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:44,000
kind of wild and crazy and everybody's

180
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
learning all kinds of things, or fooling around, or whatever they're doing.

181
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But it was intended to be quite quiet.

182
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And then you would wander around and gather information,

183
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:58,000
in a straightforward fashion, about the recycling process

184
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and what's being done, and how they're going to reuse the water

185
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:03,000
once it comes through the plant.

186
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And then, if you saw,

187
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the panels actually rotate. So you can get the information

188
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:2,000
on the front side, but as they rotate, you can see the actual

189
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:24,000
recycling plant behind, with all the machines as they actually process the water.

190
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
You can see: there's the plant.

191
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:45,000
These are all very low-budget videos, like quick prototypes.

192
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And we're announcing a new product here tonight,

193
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:5,000
which is the first time this has ever been shown in public.

194
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It's called Spyfish, and it's a company called H2Eye,

195
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
started by Nigel Jagger in London.

196
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And it's a company that's trying to bring the experience -- many people have boats,

197
0:12:04,000 --> 0:12:09,000
or enjoy being on boats, but a very small percentage of people

198
0:12:09,000 --> 0:12:14,000
actually have the capability or the interest in going under the water

199
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and actually seeing what's there,

200
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and enjoying what scuba divers do.

201
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:2,000
This product, it has two cameras.

202
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:23,000
You throw it over the side of your boat

203
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and you basically scuba dive without getting wet.

204
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:36,000
For us -- there's the object -- for us, it was two projects. One, to design the interface

205
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
so that the interface doesn't get in your way.

206
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
You could have that kind of immersive experience of being underwater --

207
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
of feeling like you're underwater -- seeing what's going on.

208
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And the other one was to design the object

209
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and make sure that it was a consumer product and not a research tool.

210
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And so we spent a lot of time -- this has been going on for about

211
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
seven or eight years, this project --

212
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and [we're] just ready to start building them.

213
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Narrator: The Spyfish is a revolutionary subaquatic video camera.

214
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:08,000
It can dive to 500 feet, to where sunlight does not penetrate,

215
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and is equipped with powerful lights.

216
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:16,000
It becomes your eyes and ears as you venture into the deep.

217
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
The battery-powered Spyfish sends the live video-feed through a slender cable.)

218
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:23,000
DK: This slender cable was a huge technological advancement

219
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and it allowed the whole thing to be the size that it is.

220
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Narrator: And this central box connects the whole system together.

221
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Maneuvering the Spyfish is simple with the wireless remote control.

222
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:34,000
You watch the video with superimposed graphics

223
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that indicate your depth and compass heading.

224
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
The fluid graphics and ambient sounds combine

225
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to help you completely lose yourself underwater.)

226
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Applause)

227
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:13,000
DK: And the last thing I'll talk about is ApproTEC,

228
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
which is a project that I'm very excited about.

229
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
ApproTEC is a company started by Dr. Martin Fisher,

230
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:22,000
who's a good friend of mine. He's a Ph.D. from Stanford.

231
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:25,000
He found himself in Kenya on a Fulbright

232
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and he had a very interesting insight, which is that

233
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:31,000
he said, "There must be entrepreneurs in Kenya;

234
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
there must be entrepreneurs everywhere."

235
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And he noticed that for weddings and funerals there

236
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:39,000
they could find enough money to put something together.

237
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:43,000
So he decided to start manufacturing products in Kenya

238
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:48,000
with Kenyan manufacturers -- designed by people like us, but taken there.

239
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And to this date -- he's been gone for only a few years --

240
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:55,000
he's started 19,000 companies.

241
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:58,000
He's made 30,000 new jobs.

242
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And just the sales of the products -- this is a non-profit --

243
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:09,000
the sales of these products is now .6% of the GDP of Kenya.

244
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:12,000
This is one guy doing this. This is a pretty spectacular thing.

245
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So we're in the process of helping them design

246
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:18,000
deep-well, low-cost manual pumps

247
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:22,000
in order for these people who have a quarter acre of land

248
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to be able to grow crops in the off-season.

249
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:26,000
What they do now is: they can grow crops in the rainy season

250
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
but they can't grow them in the off-season.

251
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And so by doing that, the woman that you saw in the first thing --

252
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
she's a school teacher -- always wanted to send her kids to college

253
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and she's going to be able to do it because of these things.

254
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:42,000
So with seed-squeezers, and pumps, and hay-balers and

255
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:45,000
very straightforward things that we're designing --

256
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:47,000
my students are doing this as class projects

257
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and IDEO has donated their time to do this kind of work --

258
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:54,000
it's really amazing to see his success, Martin's.

259
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:59,000
We also were thinking about the experience of Richard,

260
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:,000
and so --

261
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:01,000
(Laughter)

262
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:06,000
-- we designed this hat, because I knew I'd be the last one in the day

263
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and I needed to deal with him. So I just have one more thing to say.

264
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:13,000
(Laughter)

265
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Can you read it?

266
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:16,000
(Laughter)

267
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Well, it's always kind of funny when he comes up and hovers.

268
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:23,000
You know, you don't want to be rude to him and you don't want to feel guilty,

269
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and so I thought this would do it, where I just sit here.

270
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
(Laughter)

271
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:35,000
(Applause)

272
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:39,000
So we saw a lot of interesting things being designed today in this session,

273
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and from all the different presenters.

274
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And in my own practice, from product to ApproTEC,

275
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:51,000
it's really exciting that we're taking a more human-centered approach to design,

276
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:54,000
that we're including behaviors and personalities in the things we do,

277
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and I think this is great.

278
0:16:56,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Designers are more trusted and more integrated

279
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:,000
into the business strategy of companies,

280
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and I have to say, for one, I feel very lucky at the progress that design

281
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:08,000
has made since the first TED. Thanks a lot.

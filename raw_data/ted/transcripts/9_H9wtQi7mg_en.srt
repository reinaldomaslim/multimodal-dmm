1
0:00:12.929,000 --> 0:00:14,000
(Imitates fishing cat)

2
0:00:16.802,000 --> 0:00:19,000
That's my impersonation of a fishing cat,

3
0:00:20.159,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which actually sounds more like this.

4
0:00:24.696,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Prerecorded fishing cat sounds)

5
0:00:29.228,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's a cat that loves water,

6
0:00:32.76,000 --> 0:00:33,000
loves to fish,

7
0:00:34.252,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and lives in some of the most unique and valuable ecosystems on earth:

8
0:00:39.553,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the wetlands and mangrove forests of South and Southeast Asia.

9
0:00:43.653,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Aren't they fishing awesome?

10
0:00:45.423,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:47.788,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Fishing cats are one of about 40 species of wildcats.

12
0:00:51.034,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Like tigers and lions, only much smaller.

13
0:00:54.434,000 --> 0:00:57,000
They're probably around twice the size of our average domestic cat.

14
0:00:58.268,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In Indonesia,

15
0:00:59.514,000 --> 0:01:01,000
people call them "kucing bakau,"

16
0:01:01.617,000 --> 0:01:04,000
which literally translates to "the cat of the mangroves."

17
0:01:05.339,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But I like to call them the tigers of the mangroves.

18
0:01:09.378,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now, we don't know fishing cats as well as we do tigers,

19
0:01:13.085,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but what we've learned is that these cats can be a flagship species

20
0:01:17.206,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to a globally important ecosystem,

21
0:01:19.793,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and a visual bait attached to a strong line for conservation.

22
0:01:25.5,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Are you hooked yet?

23
0:01:26.817,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:28.876,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Like many endangered species,

25
0:01:30.742,000 --> 0:01:32,000
fishing cats are threatened by habitat loss,

26
0:01:33.55,000 --> 0:01:37,000
mainly because of our international demand for farmed fish and shrimp,

27
0:01:37.931,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and the deforestation of nearly half the historic mangrove cover

28
0:01:42.146,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in South and Southeast Asia.

29
0:01:44.615,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Mangroves, on the other hand,

30
0:01:46.203,000 --> 0:01:48,000
are much more than just habitat to the fishing cat.

31
0:01:49.379,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They are home to a fantastic array of species,

32
0:01:52.665,000 --> 0:01:53,000
like jackals,

33
0:01:54.482,000 --> 0:01:55,000
turtles,

34
0:01:56.046,000 --> 0:01:57,000
shorebirds

35
0:01:57.776,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and otters.

36
0:01:59.784,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:01.633,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Mangroves also prevent soil erosion,

38
0:02:03.854,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and they can be the first line of defense between storm surges, tsunamis

39
0:02:09.061,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and the millions of people who live next to these forests

40
0:02:12.339,000 --> 0:02:14,000
for their day-to-day survival.

41
0:02:14.839,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The fact that puts the icing on the cake --

42
0:02:17.276,000 --> 0:02:18,000
or the earth, I should say --

43
0:02:19.101,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is that mangroves can store

44
0:02:20.64,000 --> 0:02:23,000
upwards of five to ten times more carbon dioxide

45
0:02:24.371,000 --> 0:02:25,000
than tropical forests.

46
0:02:26.585,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So protecting one acre of mangroves

47
0:02:28.943,000 --> 0:02:32,000
may well be like protecting five or more acres of tropical forests.

48
0:02:34.744,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Would you like to eliminate you entire life's carbon footprint?

49
0:02:38.879,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Well, mangroves can offer you

50
0:02:41.115,000 --> 0:02:44,000
one of the best bangs for your conservation buck.

51
0:02:45.641,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Deforestation, extinction and climate change

52
0:02:48.768,000 --> 0:02:5,000
are all global problems that we can solve

53
0:02:51.728,000 --> 0:02:54,000
by giving value to our species and ecosystems

54
0:02:55.395,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and by working together with the local people

55
0:02:57.625,000 --> 0:02:58,000
who live next to them.

56
0:02:59.704,000 --> 0:03:03,000
This is one of three river deltas in coastal South India

57
0:03:04.395,000 --> 0:03:05,000
where communities came together

58
0:03:06.284,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to change the face and potentially, the fate of this planet.

59
0:03:10.641,000 --> 0:03:11,000
In less than a decade,

60
0:03:12.078,000 --> 0:03:14,000
with international support,

61
0:03:14.307,000 --> 0:03:17,000
the state forest departments and the local communities

62
0:03:17.776,000 --> 0:03:19,000
worked together to restore

63
0:03:20.222,000 --> 0:03:24,000
over 20,000 acres of unproductive fish and shrimp farms

64
0:03:25.195,000 --> 0:03:26,000
back into mangroves.

65
0:03:28.134,000 --> 0:03:3,000
About five years ago,

66
0:03:30.42,000 --> 0:03:33,000
guess who we discovered in these restored mangroves?

67
0:03:36.997,000 --> 0:03:4,000
When we shared images of these fishing cats with local people,

68
0:03:41.387,000 --> 0:03:43,000
we were able to build pride among them

69
0:03:43.53,000 --> 0:03:46,000
about a globally revered endangered species and ecosystem

70
0:03:47.486,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in their backyards.

71
0:03:49.342,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We were also able to build trust with some people

72
0:03:52.27,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to help them lead alternative livelihoods.

73
0:03:54.977,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Meet Santosh, a 19-year-old boy

74
0:03:57.313,000 --> 0:03:59,000
who not only became a conservation professional

75
0:04:00.091,000 --> 0:04:02,000
after working with us for just over a year

76
0:04:02.44,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but also went on to involve many local fishermen

77
0:04:05.305,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in helping study and protect fishing cats.

78
0:04:08.561,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Meet Moshi, a tribal poacher,

79
0:04:11.529,000 --> 0:04:12,000
who not only stopped hunting

80
0:04:12.91,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and became our most prized conservationist,

81
0:04:15.934,000 --> 0:04:17,000
but also used his traditional knowledge

82
0:04:18.41,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to educate his entire community to stop hunting fishing cats, otters

83
0:04:23.079,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and the many other threatened species

84
0:04:24.872,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that live in the mangroves in his backyard.

85
0:04:28.141,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Fish and shrimp farmers, like Venkat,

86
0:04:30.656,000 --> 0:04:33,000
are now willing to work with us conservationists

87
0:04:33.707,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to test the sustainable harvest of ecosystem services like crabs,

88
0:04:38.593,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and possibly even honey, from mangroves.

89
0:04:41.411,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Incentives that could get them to protect and plant mangroves

90
0:04:45.601,000 --> 0:04:46,000
where they have been lost.

91
0:04:47.982,000 --> 0:04:48,000
A win-win-win

92
0:04:49.783,000 --> 0:04:53,000
for fishing cats, local people and the global community.

93
0:04:55.485,000 --> 0:04:58,000
These stories show us that we can all be part of a future

94
0:04:58.756,000 --> 0:05:01,000
where fishing cats and the lost mangrove forests

95
0:05:02.303,000 --> 0:05:05,000
are protected and restored by fishermen themselves,

96
0:05:06.198,000 --> 0:05:07,000
creating carbon sinks

97
0:05:08.095,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that can help offset our ecological footprints.

98
0:05:12.42,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So while the fishing cat may be small,

99
0:05:14.895,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I hope that we've been able to help make it a big deal.

100
0:05:19.069,000 --> 0:05:2,000
One that we can all invest in

101
0:05:20.919,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to help sustain our lives on earth a little longer.

102
0:05:25.849,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Or as our friend here would say ...

103
0:05:29.119,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Prerecorded fishing cat sounds)

104
0:05:32.151,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Thank you.

105
0:05:33.325,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Applause)

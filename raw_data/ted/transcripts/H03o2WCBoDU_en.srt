1
0:00:12.7,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When someone mentions Cuba,

2
0:00:14.42,000 --> 0:00:15,000
what do you think about?

3
0:00:17.02,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Classic, classic cars?

4
0:00:19.1,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Perhaps good cigars?

5
0:00:21.42,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Maybe you think of a famous baseball player.

6
0:00:23.54,000 --> 0:00:25,000
What about when somebody mentions North Korea?

7
0:00:25.9,000 --> 0:00:27,000
You think about those missile tests,

8
0:00:28.02,000 --> 0:00:29,000
maybe their notorious leader

9
0:00:29.94,000 --> 0:00:31,000
or his good friend, Dennis Rodman.

10
0:00:32.46,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:33.98,000 --> 0:00:35,000
One thing that likely doesn't come to mind

12
0:00:36.34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is a vision of a country,

13
0:00:38.78,000 --> 0:00:39,000
an open economy,

14
0:00:40.06,000 --> 0:00:44,000
whose citizens have access to a wide range of affordable consumer products.

15
0:00:47.06,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I'm not here to argue how these countries got to where they are today.

16
0:00:51.7,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I simply want to use them as an example of countries and citizens

17
0:00:55.42,000 --> 0:00:58,000
who have been affected, negatively affected,

18
0:00:58.66,000 --> 0:01:,000
by a trade policy that restricts imports

19
0:01:01.78,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and protects local industries.

20
0:01:04.3,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Recently we've heard a number of countries

21
0:01:07.22,000 --> 0:01:09,000
talk about restricting imports

22
0:01:09.42,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and protecting their local, domestic industries.

23
0:01:12.46,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now, this may sound fine in a sound bite,

24
0:01:15.74,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but what it really is is protectionism.

25
0:01:18.98,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We heard a lot about this during the 2016 presidential election.

26
0:01:23.42,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We heard about it during the Brexit debates

27
0:01:25.9,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and most recently during the French elections.

28
0:01:30.5,000 --> 0:01:32,000
In fact, it's been a really important topic

29
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
being talked about around the world,

30
0:01:35.42,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and many aspiring political leaders

31
0:01:37.86,000 --> 0:01:4,000
are running on platforms positioning protectionism as a good thing.

32
0:01:42.62,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Now, I could see why they think protectionism is good,

33
0:01:45.42,000 --> 0:01:49,000
because sometimes it seems like trade is unfair.

34
0:01:50.94,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Some have blamed trade

35
0:01:52.9,000 --> 0:01:55,000
for some of the problems we've been having here at home in the US.

36
0:01:56.06,000 --> 0:01:57,000
For years we've been hearing

37
0:01:57.46,000 --> 0:02:,000
about the loss of high-paying US manufacturing jobs.

38
0:02:01.38,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Many think that manufacturing is declining in the US

39
0:02:04.98,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because companies are moving their operations offshore

40
0:02:08.14,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to markets with lower-cost labor

41
0:02:10.58,000 --> 0:02:12,000
like China, Mexico and Vietnam.

42
0:02:14.54,000 --> 0:02:17,000
They also think trade agreements sometimes are unfair,

43
0:02:18.22,000 --> 0:02:19,000
like NAFTA

44
0:02:19.94,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and the Trans-Pacific Partnership,

45
0:02:21.78,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because these trade agreements allow companies

46
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to reimport those cheaply produced goods back into the US

47
0:02:29.54,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and other countries from where the jobs were taken.

48
0:02:32.7,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So it kind of feels like the exporters win

49
0:02:35.82,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and the importers lose.

50
0:02:38.78,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Now, the reality is

51
0:02:40.02,000 --> 0:02:42,000
output in the manufacturing sector in the US

52
0:02:43.9,000 --> 0:02:44,000
is actually growing,

53
0:02:45.66,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but we are losing jobs.

54
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We're losing lots of them.

55
0:02:49.22,000 --> 0:02:51,000
In fact, from 2000 to 2010,

56
0:02:51.94,000 --> 0:02:54,000
5.7 million manufacturing jobs were lost.

57
0:02:56.38,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But they're not being lost for the reasons you might think.

58
0:03:00.94,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Mike Johnson in Toledo, Ohio

59
0:03:03.9,000 --> 0:03:04,000
didn't lose his jobs at the factory

60
0:03:05.9,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to Miguel Sanchez in Monterrey, Mexico.

61
0:03:08.38,000 --> 0:03:09,000
No.

62
0:03:09.62,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Mike lost his job to a machine.

63
0:03:13.42,000 --> 0:03:16,000
87 percent of lost manufacturing jobs

64
0:03:16.74,000 --> 0:03:18,000
have been eliminated because we've made improvements

65
0:03:19.58,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in our own productivity through automation.

66
0:03:23.54,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So that means that one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs

67
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
was due to offshoring.

68
0:03:31.5,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now, this is not just a US phenomenon.

69
0:03:33.94,000 --> 0:03:34,000
No.

70
0:03:35.18,000 --> 0:03:38,000
In fact, automation is spreading to every production line

71
0:03:38.54,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in every country around the world.

72
0:03:41.54,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But look, I get it:

73
0:03:43.18,000 --> 0:03:44,000
if you just lost your job

74
0:03:44.7,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and then you read in the newspaper

75
0:03:46.38,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that your old company just struck up a deal with China,

76
0:03:49.02,000 --> 0:03:51,000
it's easy to think you were just replaced

77
0:03:51.5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in a one-for-one deal.

78
0:03:53.9,000 --> 0:03:55,000
When I hear stories like this, I think that what people picture

79
0:03:56.9,000 --> 0:03:59,000
is that trade happens between only two countries.

80
0:04:00.94,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Manufacturers in one country

81
0:04:03.38,000 --> 0:04:04,000
produce products and they export them

82
0:04:05.34,000 --> 0:04:07,000
to consumers in other countries,

83
0:04:08.82,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and it feels like the manufacturing countries win

84
0:04:11.86,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and the importing countries lose.

85
0:04:15.34,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Well, reality's a little bit different.

86
0:04:19.22,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I'm a supply chain professional,

87
0:04:20.82,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and I live and work in Mexico.

88
0:04:24.34,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I work in the middle

89
0:04:25.62,000 --> 0:04:28,000
of a highly connected network of manufacturers

90
0:04:28.82,000 --> 0:04:3,000
all collaborating from around the world

91
0:04:30.98,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to produce many of the products we use today.

92
0:04:34.42,000 --> 0:04:35,000
What I see

93
0:04:35.66,000 --> 0:04:37,000
from my front-row seat in Mexico City

94
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
actually looks more like this.

95
0:04:41.5,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And this is a more accurate depiction of what trade really looks like.

96
0:04:46.436,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I've had the pleasure of being able to see

97
0:04:48.46,000 --> 0:04:5,000
how many different products are manufactured,

98
0:04:50.98,000 --> 0:04:52,000
from golf clubs to laptop computers

99
0:04:53.82,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to internet servers, automobiles

100
0:04:56.42,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and even airplanes.

101
0:04:58.34,000 --> 0:05:,000
And believe me, none of it happens in a straight line.

102
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Let me give you an example.

103
0:05:05.34,000 --> 0:05:09,000
A few months ago, I was touring the manufacturing plant

104
0:05:09.62,000 --> 0:05:11,000
of a multinational aerospace company

105
0:05:12.62,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in Querétaro, Mexico,

106
0:05:14.74,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and the VP of logistics points out a completed tail assembly.

107
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It turns out the tail assemblies are assembled from panels

108
0:05:23.66,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that are manufactured in France,

109
0:05:26.18,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and they're assembled in Mexico

110
0:05:28.42,000 --> 0:05:3,000
using components imported from the US.

111
0:05:31.86,000 --> 0:05:33,000
When those tail assemblies are done,

112
0:05:33.9,000 --> 0:05:35,000
they're exported via truck to Canada

113
0:05:36.38,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to their primary assembly plant

114
0:05:38.58,000 --> 0:05:39,000
where they come together

115
0:05:39.86,000 --> 0:05:41,000
with thousands of other parts,

116
0:05:42.3,000 --> 0:05:44,000
like the wings and the seats

117
0:05:44.7,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and the little shades over the little windows,

118
0:05:47.62,000 --> 0:05:49,000
all coming in to become a part of a new airplane.

119
0:05:51.3,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Think about it.

120
0:05:53.14,000 --> 0:05:54,000
These new airplanes,

121
0:05:54.62,000 --> 0:05:56,000
before they even take their first flight,

122
0:05:57.22,000 --> 0:05:59,000
they have more stamps in their passports

123
0:05:59.7,000 --> 0:06:,000
than Angelina Jolie.

124
0:06:02.58,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Now, this approach to processing goes on all around the world

125
0:06:06.1,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to manufacture many of the products

126
0:06:08.62,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we use every day,

127
0:06:11.18,000 --> 0:06:13,000
from skin cream to airplanes.

128
0:06:14.34,000 --> 0:06:16,000
When you go home tonight, take a look in your house.

129
0:06:17.5,000 --> 0:06:2,000
You might be surprised to find a label that looks like this one:

130
0:06:21.9,000 --> 0:06:25,000
"Manufactured in the USA from US and foreign parts."

131
0:06:26.98,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Economist Michael Porter

132
0:06:29.18,000 --> 0:06:3,000
described what's going on here best.

133
0:06:31.66,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Many decades ago, he said that it's most beneficial for a country

134
0:06:36.42,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to focus on producing the products it can produce most efficiently

135
0:06:40.82,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and trading for the rest.

136
0:06:43.82,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So what he's talking about here is shared production,

137
0:06:47.34,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and efficiency is the name of the game.

138
0:06:50.54,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You've probably seen an example of this

139
0:06:53.1,000 --> 0:06:54,000
at home or at work.

140
0:06:55.62,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Let's take a look at an example.

141
0:06:57.38,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Think about how your house was built

142
0:07:00.34,000 --> 0:07:01,000
or your kitchen renovated.

143
0:07:02.42,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Typically, there's a general contractor

144
0:07:04.9,000 --> 0:07:06,000
who is responsible for coordinating the efforts

145
0:07:07.14,000 --> 0:07:08,000
of all the different contractors:

146
0:07:08.78,000 --> 0:07:09,000
an architect to draw the plans,

147
0:07:11.3,000 --> 0:07:13,000
an earth-moving company to dig the foundation,

148
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
a plumber, a carpenter and so on.

149
0:07:16.82,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So why doesn't the general contractor

150
0:07:18.7,000 --> 0:07:2,000
pick just one company

151
0:07:21.34,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to do all the work,

152
0:07:22.58,000 --> 0:07:23,000
like, say, the architect?

153
0:07:24.42,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Because this is silly.

154
0:07:26.58,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The general contractor selects experts

155
0:07:28.9,000 --> 0:07:29,000
because it takes years

156
0:07:30.66,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to learn and master

157
0:07:32.42,000 --> 0:07:35,000
how to do each of the tasks it takes to build a house or renovate a kitchen,

158
0:07:36.22,000 --> 0:07:38,000
some of them requiring special training.

159
0:07:39.86,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Think about it:

160
0:07:41.1,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Would you want your architect to install your toilet?

161
0:07:45.14,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Of course not.

162
0:07:46.58,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So let's apply this process to the corporate world.

163
0:07:50.02,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Companies today focus on manufacturing

164
0:07:52.62,000 --> 0:07:55,000
what they produce best and most efficiently,

165
0:07:55.98,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and they trade for everything else.

166
0:07:58.5,000 --> 0:08:,000
So this means they rely

167
0:08:01.22,000 --> 0:08:05,000
on a global, interconnected, interdependent network of manufacturers

168
0:08:06.22,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to produce these products.

169
0:08:07.5,000 --> 0:08:09,000
In fact, that network is so interconnected

170
0:08:09.58,000 --> 0:08:1,000
it's almost impossible

171
0:08:11.9,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to dismantle and produce products in just one country.

172
0:08:15.94,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Let's take a look at the interconnected web

173
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
we saw a few moments ago,

174
0:08:19.94,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and let's focus on just one strand

175
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
between the US and Mexico.

176
0:08:26.46,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The Wilson Institute says that shared production represents

177
0:08:29.3,000 --> 0:08:34,000
40 percent of the half a trillion dollars in trade between the US and Mexico.

178
0:08:34.9,000 --> 0:08:36,000
That's about 200 billion dollars,

179
0:08:37.58,000 --> 0:08:39,000
or the same as the GDP for Portugal.

180
0:08:41.54,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So let's just imagine

181
0:08:44.1,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that the US decides to impose

182
0:08:47.22,000 --> 0:08:5,000
a 20 percent border tax on all imports from Mexico.

183
0:08:51.66,000 --> 0:08:52,000
OK, fine.

184
0:08:52.9,000 --> 0:08:56,000
But do you think Mexico is just going to stand by and let that happen?

185
0:08:57.94,000 --> 0:08:58,000
No. No way.

186
0:08:59.66,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So in retaliation, they impose a similar tax

187
0:09:02.74,000 --> 0:09:04,000
on all goods being imported from the US,

188
0:09:06.46,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and a little game of tit-for-tat ensues,

189
0:09:10.02,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and 20 percent -- just imagine that 20 percent duties

190
0:09:13.5,000 --> 0:09:16,000
are added to every good, product, product component

191
0:09:17.02,000 --> 0:09:19,000
crossing back and forth across the border,

192
0:09:19.74,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and you could be looking at more than a 40 percent increase in duties,

193
0:09:23.1,000 --> 0:09:24,000
or 80 billion dollars.

194
0:09:25.62,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Now, don't kid yourself,

195
0:09:27.42,000 --> 0:09:29,000
these costs are going to be passed along

196
0:09:29.74,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to you and to me.

197
0:09:33.78,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Now, let's think about what impact that might have on some of the products,

198
0:09:39.06,000 --> 0:09:41,000
or the prices of the products, that we buy every day.

199
0:09:42.42,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So if a 30 percent increase in duties were actually passed along,

200
0:09:46.86,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we would be looking at some pretty important increases in prices.

201
0:09:51.46,000 --> 0:09:54,000
A Lincoln MKZ would go from 37,000 dollars to 48,000.

202
0:09:56.58,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And the price of a Sharp 60-inch HDTV

203
0:10:00.62,000 --> 0:10:05,000
would go from 898 dollars to 1,167 dollars.

204
0:10:05.86,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And the price of a 16-ounce jar of CVS skin moisturizer

205
0:10:10.02,000 --> 0:10:13,000
would go from 13 dollars to 17 dollars.

206
0:10:14.06,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now, remember, this is only looking at one strand of the production chain

207
0:10:19.46,000 --> 0:10:2,000
between the US and Mexico,

208
0:10:20.86,000 --> 0:10:22,000
so multiply this out across all of the strands.

209
0:10:24.42,000 --> 0:10:25,000
The impact could be considerable.

210
0:10:26.1,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Now, just think about this:

211
0:10:28.78,000 --> 0:10:31,000
even if we were able to dismantle this network

212
0:10:33.3,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and produce products in just one country,

213
0:10:36.54,000 --> 0:10:38,000
which by the way is easier said than done,

214
0:10:39.06,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we would still only be saving or protecting

215
0:10:42.5,000 --> 0:10:44,000
one out of 10 lost manufacturing jobs.

216
0:10:45.42,000 --> 0:10:47,000
That's right, because remember,

217
0:10:49.22,000 --> 0:10:51,000
most of those jobs, 87 percent,

218
0:10:51.9,000 --> 0:10:53,000
were lost due to improvements in our own productivity.

219
0:10:55.34,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And unfortunately, those jobs, they're gone for good.

220
0:10:59.98,000 --> 0:11:,000
So the real question is,

221
0:11:02.34,000 --> 0:11:04,000
does it make sense for us to drive up prices

222
0:11:04.7,000 --> 0:11:09,000
to the point where many of us can't afford the basic goods we use every day

223
0:11:11.1,000 --> 0:11:13,000
for the purpose of saving a job

224
0:11:13.34,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that might be eliminated in a couple of years anyway?

225
0:11:17.86,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The reality is that shared production

226
0:11:19.9,000 --> 0:11:22,000
allows us to manufacture higher quality products

227
0:11:23.58,000 --> 0:11:24,000
at lower costs.

228
0:11:24.82,000 --> 0:11:25,000
It's that simple.

229
0:11:26.78,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It allows us to get more

230
0:11:28.66,000 --> 0:11:3,000
out of the limited resources and expertise we have

231
0:11:31.1,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and at the same time benefit from lower prices.

232
0:11:35.38,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It's really important to remember

233
0:11:37.46,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that for shared production to be effective,

234
0:11:40.3,000 --> 0:11:45,000
it relies on efficient cross-border movement of raw materials,

235
0:11:45.74,000 --> 0:11:46,000
components and finished products.

236
0:11:48.78,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So remember this:

237
0:11:50.94,000 --> 0:11:54,000
the next time you're hearing somebody try to sell you on the idea

238
0:11:55.02,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that protectionism is a good deal,

239
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
it's just not.

240
0:11:59.86,000 --> 0:12:,000
Thank you.

241
0:12:01.1,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Applause)

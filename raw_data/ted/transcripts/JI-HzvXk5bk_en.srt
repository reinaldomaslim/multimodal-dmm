1
0:00:13.103,000 --> 0:00:16,000
How do we build a society

2
0:00:16.253,000 --> 0:00:17,000
without fossil fuels?

3
0:00:18.944,000 --> 0:00:2,000
This is a very complex challenge,

4
0:00:21.92,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I believe developing countries could take the lead in this transition.

5
0:00:27.12,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I'm aware that this is a contentious statement,

6
0:00:30.44,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but the reality is that so much is at stake in our countries

7
0:00:35.76,000 --> 0:00:39,000
if we let fossil fuels stay at the center of our development.

8
0:00:41.24,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We can do it differently.

9
0:00:44.2,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And it's time, it really is time,

10
0:00:47.48,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to debunk the myth

11
0:00:50.2,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that a country has to choose between development on the one hand

12
0:00:55.28,000 --> 0:01:,000
and environmental protection, renewables, quality of life, on the other.

13
0:01:01.8,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I come from Costa Rica, a developing country.

14
0:01:04.68,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We are nearly five million people,

15
0:01:08.2,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and we live right in the middle of the Americas,

16
0:01:10.8,000 --> 0:01:12,000
so it's very easy to remember where we live.

17
0:01:15.08,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Nearly 100 percent of our electricity

18
0:01:22.4,000 --> 0:01:24,000
comes from renewable sources,

19
0:01:24.88,000 --> 0:01:25,000
five of them.

20
0:01:26.12,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Applause)

21
0:01:30.8,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Hydropower, geothermal,

22
0:01:34.68,000 --> 0:01:37,000
wind, solar, biomass.

23
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Did you know that last year,

24
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
for 299 days,

25
0:01:44.64,000 --> 0:01:47,000
we did not use any fossil fuels

26
0:01:47.88,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in order to generate all our electricity?

27
0:01:52.24,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It's a fantastic achievement,

28
0:01:56.36,000 --> 0:02:,000
and yet, it hides a paradox,

29
0:02:03.08,000 --> 0:02:06,000
which is that nearly 70 percent

30
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of all our energy consumption is oil.

31
0:02:11.88,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Why?

32
0:02:13.8,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Because of our transportation system,

33
0:02:16.56,000 --> 0:02:19,000
which is totally dependent on fossil fuels,

34
0:02:19.84,000 --> 0:02:2,000
like it is in most countries.

35
0:02:22.479,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So if we think of the energy transition as a marathon,

36
0:02:26.04,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the question is, how do we get to the finish line,

37
0:02:29.96,000 --> 0:02:32,000
how do we decarbonize the rest of the economy?

38
0:02:33.88,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And it's fair to say that if we don't succeed,

39
0:02:36.8,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it's difficult to see who will.

40
0:02:38.6,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So that is why I want to talk to you about Costa Rica,

41
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
because I believe we are a great candidate

42
0:02:44.88,000 --> 0:02:48,000
in pioneering a vision for development without fossil fuels.

43
0:02:51.2,000 --> 0:02:54,000
If you know one thing about our country,

44
0:02:54.48,000 --> 0:02:55,000
it's that we don't have an army.

45
0:02:57.44,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So I'm going to take you back to 1948.

46
0:03:01.4,000 --> 0:03:04,000
That year, the country was coming out of civil war.

47
0:03:06.36,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Thousands of Costa Ricans had died,

48
0:03:09.96,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and families were bitterly split.

49
0:03:13.24,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And yet, a surprising idea won the hearts and minds:

50
0:03:18.28,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we would reboot the country,

51
0:03:20.2,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and that Second Republic would have no army.

52
0:03:23.28,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So we abolished it.

53
0:03:25.36,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And the president at the time,

54
0:03:28.04,000 --> 0:03:3,000
José Figueres,

55
0:03:30.24,000 --> 0:03:35,000
found a powerful way by smashing the walls of an army base.

56
0:03:37.2,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The following year, 1949,

57
0:03:40.4,000 --> 0:03:44,000
we made that decision permanent in the new constitution,

58
0:03:44.6,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and that is why I can tell you that story nearly 70 years later.

59
0:03:49.52,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And I'm grateful.

60
0:03:51.56,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I'm grateful they made that decision before I was born,

61
0:03:55.28,000 --> 0:03:57,000
because it allowed me and millions of others

62
0:03:57.56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to live in a very stable country.

63
0:04:01.2,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And you might be thinking that it was good luck,

64
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but it wasn't.

65
0:04:05.68,000 --> 0:04:08,000
There was a pattern of deliberate choices.

66
0:04:10.08,000 --> 0:04:16,000
In the '40s, Costa Ricans were given free education and free health care.

67
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We called that social guarantees.

68
0:04:18.76,000 --> 0:04:19,000
By abolishing the army,

69
0:04:20.4,000 --> 0:04:24,000
we were able to turn military spending into social spending,

70
0:04:25.36,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and that was a driver of stability.

71
0:04:28.12,000 --> 0:04:29,000
In the '50s --

72
0:04:29.399,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Applause)

73
0:04:34.6,000 --> 0:04:37,000
In the '50s, we started investing in hydropower,

74
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and that kept us away from the trap

75
0:04:40.68,000 --> 0:04:43,000
of using fossil fuels for electricity generation,

76
0:04:43.76,000 --> 0:04:45,000
which is what the world is struggling with today.

77
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In the '70s we invested in national parks,

78
0:04:50.72,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and that kept us away

79
0:04:53.64,000 --> 0:04:57,000
from the deeply flawed logic of growth, growth, growth at any cost

80
0:04:58.32,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that you see others embracing, especially in the developing world.

81
0:05:02.8,000 --> 0:05:06,000
In the '90s, we pioneered payments for ecosystem services,

82
0:05:06.92,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and that helped us reverse deforestation

83
0:05:08.88,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and boosted ecotourism, which today is a key engine of growth.

84
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So investing in environmental protection

85
0:05:15.96,000 --> 0:05:17,000
did not hurt our economy.

86
0:05:18.2,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Quite the opposite.

87
0:05:19.48,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And it doesn't mean we are perfect,

88
0:05:21.52,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and it doesn't mean we don't have contradictions.

89
0:05:23.88,000 --> 0:05:24,000
That's not the point.

90
0:05:25.72,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The point is that, by making our own choices,

91
0:05:29.24,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we were able to develop resilience in dealing with development problems.

92
0:05:36.08,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Also, if you take a country like ours,

93
0:05:39.68,000 --> 0:05:42,000
the GDP per capita is around 11,000 dollars,

94
0:05:43.6,000 --> 0:05:44,000
depending on how you measure it.

95
0:05:46.08,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But according to the Social Progress Index,

96
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
we are an absolute outlier

97
0:05:50.08,000 --> 0:05:53,000
when it comes to turning GDP into social progress.

98
0:05:54,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Abolishing the army,

99
0:05:55.56,000 --> 0:05:56,000
investing in nature and people,

100
0:05:57.4,000 --> 0:05:59,000
did something very powerful, too.

101
0:06:01.12,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It shaped the narrative,

102
0:06:04,000 --> 0:06:06,000
the narrative of a small country with big ideas,

103
0:06:06.64,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and it was very empowering to grow up with that narrative.

104
0:06:11.52,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So the question is,

105
0:06:13.72,000 --> 0:06:16,000
what is the next big idea for this generation?

106
0:06:18.32,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And I believe what comes next

107
0:06:20.72,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is for this generation to let go of fossil fuels for good,

108
0:06:27.64,000 --> 0:06:28,000
just as we did with the army.

109
0:06:30.4,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Fossil fuels create climate change.

110
0:06:32.72,000 --> 0:06:33,000
We know that,

111
0:06:34.12,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and we know how vulnerable we are to the impacts of climate change.

112
0:06:38.64,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So as a developing country, it is in our best interest

113
0:06:42.32,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to build development without fossil fuels

114
0:06:44.32,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that harm people in the first place.

115
0:06:48.88,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Because

116
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:53,000
why would we continue importing oil

117
0:06:55.8,000 --> 0:06:56,000
for transportation

118
0:06:57.56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
if we can use electricity instead?

119
0:07:00.72,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Remember,

120
0:07:02.56,000 --> 0:07:03,000
this is the country

121
0:07:04.48,000 --> 0:07:1,000
where electricity comes from water in our rivers,

122
0:07:10.56,000 --> 0:07:12,000
heat from volcanoes,

123
0:07:13.08,000 --> 0:07:16,000
wind turbines, solar panels,

124
0:07:16.44,000 --> 0:07:17,000
biowaste.

125
0:07:18.56,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Abolishing fossil fuels means disrupting our transportation system

126
0:07:24.88,000 --> 0:07:29,000
so that we can power our cars, buses and trains with electricity

127
0:07:30.24,000 --> 0:07:31,000
instead of dirty energy.

128
0:07:32.4,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And transportation, let me tell you,

129
0:07:34.84,000 --> 0:07:38,000
has become an existential issue for us Costa Ricans,

130
0:07:38.92,000 --> 0:07:4,000
because the model we have is not working for us.

131
0:07:41.36,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's hurting people,

132
0:07:43.48,000 --> 0:07:44,000
it's hurting companies,

133
0:07:45.24,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and it's hurting our health.

134
0:07:47.24,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Because when policies and infrastructure fail,

135
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
this is what happens on a daily basis.

136
0:07:56.8,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Two hours in the morning,

137
0:07:58.4,000 --> 0:07:59,000
two hours in the evening.

138
0:08:00.24,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I don't understand why we have to accept this as normal.

139
0:08:04.8,000 --> 0:08:05,000
It's offensive

140
0:08:07.04,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to have to waste our time like this every single day.

141
0:08:11.92,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And this highway is actually quite good

142
0:08:13.84,000 --> 0:08:15,000
compared to what you see in other countries

143
0:08:15.92,000 --> 0:08:16,000
where traffic is exploding.

144
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:2,000
You know, Costa Ricans call this "presa."

145
0:08:21.28,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Presa means "imprisoned."

146
0:08:24.36,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And people are turning violent

147
0:08:27.36,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in a country that is otherwise happy in pura vida.

148
0:08:32.04,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It's happening.

149
0:08:33.88,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So a lot is at stake.

150
0:08:36.56,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The good news

151
0:08:38.44,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is that when we talk about clean transportation

152
0:08:41.48,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and different mobility,

153
0:08:42.76,000 --> 0:08:47,000
we're not talking about some distant utopia out there.

154
0:08:47.799,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We're talking about electric mobility that is happening today.

155
0:08:53.039,000 --> 0:08:58,000
By 2022, electric cars and conventional cars

156
0:08:58.52,000 --> 0:09:,000
are expected to cost the same,

157
0:09:01.52,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and cities are already trying electric buses.

158
0:09:05.8,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And these really cool creatures

159
0:09:08.76,000 --> 0:09:09,000
are saving money,

160
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and they reduce pollution.

161
0:09:13.48,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So if we want to get rid of oil-based transportation, we can,

162
0:09:17.48,000 --> 0:09:19,000
because we have options now that we didn't have before.

163
0:09:20.12,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It's really exciting.

164
0:09:22.76,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But of course,

165
0:09:25.28,000 --> 0:09:27,000
some get very uncomfortable with this idea,

166
0:09:29.76,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and they will come and they will tell you

167
0:09:32.96,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that the world is stuck with oil, and so is Costa Rica, so get real.

168
0:09:37.8,000 --> 0:09:38,000
That's what they tell you.

169
0:09:39.08,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And you know what the answer to that argument is?

170
0:09:41.44,000 --> 0:09:44,000
That in 1948, we didn't say the world is stuck with armies,

171
0:09:45.04,000 --> 0:09:46,000
so let's keep our army, too.

172
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:49,000
No, we made a very brave choice,

173
0:09:50.64,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and that choice made the whole difference.

174
0:09:53.6,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So it's time for this generation to be brave again

175
0:09:58,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and abolish fossil fuels for good.

176
0:09:59.8,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And I'll give you three reasons why we have to do this.

177
0:10:03.24,000 --> 0:10:04,000
First,

178
0:10:05.12,000 --> 0:10:08,000
our model of transportation and urbanization is broken,

179
0:10:08.88,000 --> 0:10:12,000
so this is the best moment to redefine our urban and mobility future.

180
0:10:14.52,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We don't want cities that are built for cars.

181
0:10:17.36,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We want cities for people

182
0:10:19.72,000 --> 0:10:22,000
where we can walk and we can use bikes.

183
0:10:23.6,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And we want public transportation,

184
0:10:25.76,000 --> 0:10:26,000
lots of it,

185
0:10:27.28,000 --> 0:10:3,000
public transportation that is clean and dignifying.

186
0:10:31.2,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Because if we continue adding fleets of conventional cars,

187
0:10:36.76,000 --> 0:10:38,000
our cities will become unbearable.

188
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Second, we have to change,

189
0:10:41.76,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but incremental change is not going to be sufficient.

190
0:10:46.72,000 --> 0:10:48,000
We need transformational change.

191
0:10:49.6,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And there are some incremental projects in my country,

192
0:10:52.48,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and I am the first one to celebrate them.

193
0:10:55.8,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But let's not kid ourselves.

194
0:10:58.2,000 --> 0:11:01,000
We're not talking about ending up with really beautiful electric cars here

195
0:11:02.12,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and a few electric buses there

196
0:11:04.76,000 --> 0:11:07,000
while we keep investing in the same kind of infrastructure,

197
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
more cars, more roads, more oil.

198
0:11:10.68,000 --> 0:11:14,000
We're talking about breaking free from oil,

199
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and you cannot get there through incrementalism.

200
0:11:20.36,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Third, and you know this one,

201
0:11:25.08,000 --> 0:11:28,000
the world is hungry for inspiration.

202
0:11:30.12,000 --> 0:11:33,000
It craves stories of success

203
0:11:33.24,000 --> 0:11:34,000
in dealing with complex issues,

204
0:11:35.04,000 --> 0:11:38,000
especially in developing countries.

205
0:11:39.4,000 --> 0:11:42,000
So I believe Costa Rica can be an inspiration to others,

206
0:11:43.72,000 --> 0:11:45,000
as we did last year when we disclosed

207
0:11:46.48,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that for so many days we were not using any fossil fuels

208
0:11:50.48,000 --> 0:11:54,000
in order to generate all our electricity.

209
0:11:55.36,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The news went viral around the world.

210
0:11:59.64,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Also, and this makes me extremely proud,

211
0:12:02.76,000 --> 0:12:05,000
a Costa Rican woman, Christiana Figueres,

212
0:12:07.48,000 --> 0:12:12,000
played a decisive role in the negotiations of the Paris climate agreement.

213
0:12:14.6,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So we have to protect that legacy and be an example.

214
0:12:19.4,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So what comes next?

215
0:12:22.24,000 --> 0:12:23,000
The people.

216
0:12:24.28,000 --> 0:12:26,000
How do we get people to own this?

217
0:12:27.76,000 --> 0:12:29,000
How do we get people

218
0:12:29.88,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to believe that it's possible

219
0:12:32.32,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to build a society without fossil fuels?

220
0:12:36.04,000 --> 0:12:39,000
A lot of work from the ground up is needed.

221
0:12:41.12,000 --> 0:12:44,000
That is why, in 2014, we created Costa Rica Limpia.

222
0:12:45.72,000 --> 0:12:47,000
"Limpia" means "clean,"

223
0:12:48.44,000 --> 0:12:51,000
because we want to empower and we want to inspire citizens.

224
0:12:52.76,000 --> 0:12:54,000
If citizens don't get engaged,

225
0:12:57.08,000 --> 0:13:01,000
clean transportation decisions will be bogged down by endless,

226
0:13:01.76,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and I mean endless, technical discussions,

227
0:13:04.76,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and by avalanches of lobbying by various established interests.

228
0:13:12.72,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Wanting to be a green country powered by renewables

229
0:13:16.6,000 --> 0:13:18,000
is already part of our story.

230
0:13:19.2,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We should not let anybody take that away from us.

231
0:13:24.08,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Last year, we brought people from our seven provinces

232
0:13:28.56,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to talk about climate change in terms that matter to them,

233
0:13:32.72,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and we also brought this year

234
0:13:35.64,000 --> 0:13:37,000
another group of Costa Ricans

235
0:13:37.72,000 --> 0:13:39,000
to talk about renewable energy.

236
0:13:39.84,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And you know what?

237
0:13:41.12,000 --> 0:13:43,000
These people disagree on almost everything

238
0:13:43.4,000 --> 0:13:45,000
except on renewable energy

239
0:13:46.08,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and clean transportation and clean air.

240
0:13:48.2,000 --> 0:13:49,000
It brings people together.

241
0:13:50.2,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And the key to real participation

242
0:13:53.08,000 --> 0:13:55,000
is to help people not to feel small.

243
0:13:55.32,000 --> 0:13:56,000
People feel powerless,

244
0:13:56.64,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and they are tired of not being heard.

245
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:03,000
So what we do is concrete things,

246
0:14:03.4,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and we translate technical issues into citizen language

247
0:14:07.92,000 --> 0:14:1,000
to show that citizens have a role to play and can play it together.

248
0:14:12.48,000 --> 0:14:15,000
For the first time, we're tracking the promises that were made

249
0:14:15.72,000 --> 0:14:16,000
on clean transportation,

250
0:14:17.24,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and politicos know that they have to deliver it,

251
0:14:19.88,000 --> 0:14:22,000
but the tipping point will come when we form coalitions --

252
0:14:23.96,000 --> 0:14:24,000
citizens, companies,

253
0:14:25.84,000 --> 0:14:27,000
champions of public transportation --

254
0:14:28.04,000 --> 0:14:3,000
that will make electric mobility the new normal,

255
0:14:30.84,000 --> 0:14:32,000
especially in a developing country.

256
0:14:34.56,000 --> 0:14:37,000
By the time the next election comes,

257
0:14:38.28,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I believe every candidate will have to disclose where they stand

258
0:14:41.72,000 --> 0:14:42,000
on the abolition of fossil fuels.

259
0:14:43.64,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Because this question has to enter our mainstream politics.

260
0:14:48.52,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And I'm telling you, this is not a question of climate policy

261
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:53,000
or environmental agenda.

262
0:14:54.76,000 --> 0:14:56,000
It's about the country that we want

263
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
and the cities that we have

264
0:15:00.28,000 --> 0:15:01,000
and the cities that we want

265
0:15:01.96,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and who makes that choice.

266
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Because at the end of the day, what we have to show

267
0:15:07.36,000 --> 0:15:1,000
is that development with renewable energy

268
0:15:10.52,000 --> 0:15:11,000
is good for the people,

269
0:15:13.44,000 --> 0:15:15,000
for Costa Ricans that are alive today

270
0:15:15.88,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and especially for those who haven't been born.

271
0:15:21.56,000 --> 0:15:24,000
This is our National Museum today.

272
0:15:24.64,000 --> 0:15:25,000
It's bright and peaceful,

273
0:15:26.36,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and when you stand up in front of it,

274
0:15:29.08,000 --> 0:15:32,000
it's really hard to believe these were military barracks

275
0:15:32.4,000 --> 0:15:34,000
at the end of the '40s.

276
0:15:34.6,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We started a new life without an army in this place,

277
0:15:38.44,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and here is where our abolition

278
0:15:42.32,000 --> 0:15:44,000
of fossil fuels will be announced one day.

279
0:15:45.24,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And we will make history again.

280
0:15:47.56,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Thank you.

281
0:15:48.8,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Applause)

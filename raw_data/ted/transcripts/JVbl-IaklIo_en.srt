1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I have 18 minutes to tell you what happened

2
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
over the past six million years.

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
All right.

4
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We all have come from a long way,

5
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
here in Africa, and converged in this region of Africa,

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:44,000
which is a place where 90 percent of our evolutionary process took place.

7
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And I say that not because I am African,

8
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but it's in Africa that you find the earliest evidence

9
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:55,000
for human ancestors, upright walking traces,

10
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
even the first technologies in the form of stone tools.

11
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So we all are Africans, and welcome home.

12
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:03,000
All right.

13
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I'm a paleoanthropologist, and my job is to define

14
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:1,000
man's place in nature and explore what makes us human.

15
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And today, I will use Selam, the earliest child ever discovered,

16
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to tell you a story of all of us.

17
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Selam is our most complete skeleton of a three-year-old girl

18
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who lived and died 3.3 million years ago.

19
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:28,000
She belongs to the species known as Australopithecus afarensis.

20
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:3,000
You don't need to remember that.

21
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:34,000
That's the Lucy species, and was found by my research team

22
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in December of 2000 in an area called Dikika.

23
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's in the northeastern part of Ethiopia.

24
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And Selam means peace in many Ethiopian languages.

25
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:48,000
We use that name to celebrate peace in the region and in the planet.

26
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And the fact that it was the cover story of all these famous magazines

27
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
gives you already an idea of her significance, I think.

28
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:58,000
After I was invited by TED, I did some digging,

29
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because that's what we do, to know about my host.

30
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You don't just jump into an invitation.

31
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And I learned that the first technology appeared

32
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:08,000
in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago.

33
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:13,000
First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old.

34
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old -- beads.

35
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.

36
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And DNA analysis of living humans and chimpanzees

37
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:32,000
teaches us today that we diverged sometime around seven million years ago

38
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and that these two species share over 98 percent of the same genetic material.

39
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I think knowing this is a very useful context

40
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:44,000
within which we can think of our ancestry.

41
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:48,000
However, DNA analysis informs us only about

42
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the beginning and the end, telling us nothing

43
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
about what happened in the middle.

44
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So, for us, paleoanthropologists, our job is to find the hard evidence,

45
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the fossil evidence, to fill in this gap

46
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and see the different stages of development.

47
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Because it's only when you do that, that you can talk about --

48
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter) --

49
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
it's only when you do that, [that] you can talk about

50
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:19,000
how we looked like and how we behaved at different times,

51
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and how those likes and looks and behaviors changed through time.

52
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
That then gives you an access

53
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to explore the biological mechanisms

54
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and forces that are responsible for this gradual change

55
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that made us what we are today.

56
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But finding the hard evidence is a very complicated endeavor.

57
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It's a systematic and scientific approach,

58
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:48,000
which takes you to places that are remote, hot, hostile and often with no access.

59
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Just to give you an example, when I went to Dikika,

60
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:54,000
where Selam was found, in '99 -- and it's about 500 kilometers

61
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:58,000
from Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.

62
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It took us only seven hours to do the first 470 kilometers of the 500,

63
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but took four, solid hours to do the last only 30 kilometers.

64
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:14,000
With the help of the locals and using just shovels and picks, I made my way.

65
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I was the first person to actually drive a car to the spot.

66
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
When you get there, this is what you see,

67
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and it's the vastness of the place which makes you feel helpless and vulnerable.

68
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And once you make it there, the big question is where to start.

69
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Laughter)

70
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And you find nothing for years and years.

71
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:39,000
When I go to places like this, which are paleontological sites,

72
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
it's like going to a game park, an extinct game park.

73
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But what you find are not the human remains,

74
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
such as Selam and Lucy, on a day-to-day basis.

75
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You find elephants, rhinos, monkeys, pigs, etc.

76
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But you could ask, how could these large mammals

77
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
live in this desert environment?

78
0:04:57,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Of course, they cannot, but I'm telling you already

79
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that the environment and the carrying capacity

80
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:07,000
of this region was drastically different from what we have today.

81
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:11,000
A very important environmental lesson could be learned from this.

82
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Anyway, once we made it there, then it's a game park, as I said, an extinct game park.

83
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And our ancestors lived in that game park,

84
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but were just the minorities. They were not as successful

85
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and as widespread as the Homo sapiens that we are.

86
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:3,000
To tell you just an example, an anecdote about their rarity,

87
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I was going to this place every year and would do fieldwork here,

88
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and the assistants, of course, helped me do the surveys.

89
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They would find a bone and tell me, "Here is what you're looking for."

90
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I would say, "No, that's an elephant."

91
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Again, another one, "That's a monkey." "That's a pig," etc.

92
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So one of my assistants, who never went to school, said to me, "Listen, Zeray.

93
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:49,000
You either don't know what you're looking for,

94
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:52,000
or you're looking in the wrong place," he said.

95
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

96
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And I said, "Why?" "Because there were elephants and lions,

97
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and the people were scared and went somewhere else.

98
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:,000
Let's go somewhere else."

99
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Well, he was very tired, and it's really tiring.

100
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It was then, after such hard work and many frustrating years that we found Selam,

101
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and you see the face here covered by sandstone.

102
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And here is actually the spinal column

103
0:06:12,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and the whole torso encased in a sandstone block,

104
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because she was buried by a river.

105
0:06:19,000 --> 0:06:21,000
What you have here seems to be nothing,

106
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but contains an incredible amount of scientific information

107
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that helps us explore what makes us human.

108
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:32,000
This is the earliest and most complete juvenile human ancestor

109
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
ever found in the history of paleoanthropology,

110
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:38,000
an amazing piece of our long, long history.

111
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
There were these three people and me, and I am taking the pictures,

112
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that's why I am not in.

113
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:46,000
How would you feel if you were me? You have something extraordinary in your hand,

114
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but you are in the middle of nowhere?

115
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The feeling I had was a deep and quiet happiness and excitement,

116
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of course accompanied by a huge sense of responsibility,

117
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
of making sure everything is safe.

118
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Here is a close-up of the fossil, after five years of cleaning,

119
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:08,000
preparation and description, which was very long,

120
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:11,000
as I had to expose the bones from the sandstone block

121
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I just showed you in the previous slide.

122
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It took five years.

123
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:19,000
In a way, this was like the second birth for the child, after 3.3 million years,

124
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but the labor was very long.

125
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And here is full scale -- it's a tiny bone.

126
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And in the middle is the minister of Ethiopian tourism,

127
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:33,000
who came to visit the National Museum of Ethiopia while I was working there.

128
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And you see me worried and trying to protect my child,

129
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because you don't leave anyone with this kind of child,

130
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:42,000
even a minister.

131
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So then, once you've done that, the next stage is to know what it is.

132
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Once that was done, then it was possible to compare.

134
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We were able to tell that she belonged

135
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to the human family tree because the legs, the foot,

136
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and some features clearly showed that she walked upright,

137
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and upright walking is a hallmark in humanity.

138
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But in addition, if you compare the skull

139
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:12,000
with a comparably aged chimpanzee and little George Bush here,

140
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
you see that you have vertical forehead.

141
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And you see that in humans, because of the development

142
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:21,000
of the pre-frontal cortex, it's called.

143
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You don't see that in chimpanzees,

144
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and you don't see this very projecting canine.

145
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So she belongs to our family tree, but within that, of course,

146
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:33,000
you do detailed analysis, and we know now

147
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that she belongs to the Lucy species,

148
0:08:35,000 --> 0:08:38,000
known as Australopithecus afarensis.

149
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:41,000
The next exciting question is, girl or boy?

150
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And how old was she when she died?

151
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:46,000
You can determine the sex of the individual

152
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
based on the size of the teeth.

153
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:5,000
How?

154
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You know, in primates, there is this phenomenon

155
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
called sexual dimorphism, which simply means

156
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
males are larger than females and males have larger teeth

157
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
than the females.

158
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:,000
But to do that, you need the permanent dentition,

159
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:02,000
which you don't see here, because what you have here

160
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
are the baby teeth.

161
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But using the CT scanning technology,

162
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
which is normally used for medical purposes,

163
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
you can go deep into the mouth and come up with this beautiful image

164
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:13,000
showing you both the baby teeth here

165
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and the still-growing adult teeth here.

166
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So when you measure those teeth,

167
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:22,000
it was clear that she turned out to be a girl

168
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:25,000
with very small canine teeth.

169
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And to know how old she was when she died, what you do is

170
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:33,000
you do an informed estimate, and you say, how much time would be required

171
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to form this amount of teeth, and the answer was three.

172
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So, this girl died when she was about three,

173
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:43,000
3.3 million years ago.

174
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So, with all that information, the big question is --

175
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:5,000
what do we actually -- what does she tell us?

176
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:52,000
To answer this question, we can phrase another question.

177
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:55,000
What do we actually know about our ancestors?

178
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We want to know how they looked like, how they behaved,

179
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:59,000
how they walked around,

180
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and how they lived and grew up.

181
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And among the answers that you can get from this skeleton

182
0:10:07,000 --> 0:10:12,000
are included: first, this skeleton documents,

183
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:17,000
for the first time, how infants looked over three million years ago.

184
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And second, she tells us that she walked upright,

185
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but had some adaptation for tree climbing.

186
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And more interesting, however,

187
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:27,000
is the brain in this child was still growing.

188
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:3,000
At age three, if you have a still-growing brain,

189
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:32,000
it's a human behavior.

190
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:37,000
In chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent.

191
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:4,000
That's why they can cope with their environment

192
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:43,000
very easily after birth -- faster than us, anyway.

193
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But in humans, we continue to grow our brains.

194
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:48,000
That's why we need care from our parents.

195
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But that care means also you learn.

196
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
You spend more time with your parents.

197
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And that's very characteristic of humans and it's called childhood,

198
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
which is this extended dependence of human children

199
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:01,000
on their family or parents.

200
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So, the still-growing brain in this individual

201
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:08,000
tells us that childhood, which requires

202
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
an incredible social organization,

203
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
a very complex social organization,

204
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
emerged over three million years ago.

205
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So, by being at the cusp of our evolutionary history,

206
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Selam unites us all and gives us a unique account

207
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
on what makes us human.

208
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But not everything was human, and I will give you

209
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
a very exciting example.

210
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This is called the hyoid bone. It's a bone which is right here.

211
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It supports your tongue from behind.

212
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It's, in a way, your voice box.

213
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It determines the type of voice you produce.

214
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It was not known in the fossil record,

215
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and we have it in this skeleton.

216
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:52,000
When we did the analysis of this bone, it was clear

217
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that it looked very chimp-like, chimpanzee-like.

218
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:,000
So if you were there 3.3 million years ago,

219
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to hear when this girl was crying out for her mother,

220
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:06,000
she would have sounded more like a chimpanzee than a human.

221
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Maybe you're wondering, "So, you see this ape feature, human feature, ape feature.

222
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
What does that tell us?"

223
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
You know, that is very exciting for us,

224
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
because it demonstrates that things were changing slowly and progressively,

225
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and that evolution is in the making.

226
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:23,000
To summarize the significance of this fossil,

227
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:25,000
we can say the following.

228
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Up to now, the knowledge that we had about our ancestors

229
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:33,000
came essentially from adult individuals

230
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
because the fossils, the baby fossils, were missing.

231
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
They don't preserve well, as you know.

232
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So the knowledge that we had about our ancestors,

233
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:44,000
on how they looked like, how they behaved,

234
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:49,000
was kind of biased toward adults.

235
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Imagine somebody coming from Mars

236
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and his job is to report on the type of people

237
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:57,000
occupying our planet Earth, and you hide all the babies,

238
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the children, and he goes back and reports.

239
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Can you imagine how much biased his report would be?

240
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:07,000
That's what somehow we were doing so far

241
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in the absence of the fossil children,

242
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:14,000
so I think the new fossil fixes this problem.

243
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So, I think the most important question at the end is,

244
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
what do we actually learn from specimens like this

245
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and from our past in general?

246
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Of course, in addition to extracting this huge amount

247
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:31,000
of scientific information as to what makes us human,

248
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
you know, the many human ancestors that have existed

249
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:38,000
over the past six million years -- and there are more than 10 --

250
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
they did not have the knowledge, the technology and sophistications

251
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that we, Homo sapiens, have today.

252
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:47,000
But if this species, ancient species,

253
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:5,000
would travel in time and see us today,

254
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:55,000
they would very much be very proud of their legacy,

255
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:57,000
because they became the ancestors of

256
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the most successful species in the universe.

257
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And they were probably not aware of this future legacy,

258
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:03,000
but they did great.

259
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Now the question is, we Homo sapiens today

260
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:12,000
are in a position to decide about the future of our planet, possibly more.

261
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So the question is, are we up to the challenge?

262
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And can we really do better than these primitive,

263
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:21,000
small-brained ancestors?

264
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Among the most pressing challenges that our species

265
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is faced with today are the chronic problems of Africa.

266
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Needless to list them here, and there are more competent people

267
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
to talk about this.

268
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Still, in my opinion, we have two choices.

269
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:48,000
One is to continue to see a poor, ill, crying Africa,

270
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:53,000
carrying guns, that depends on other people forever,

271
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:58,000
or to promote an Africa which is confident,

272
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:02,000
peaceful, independent, but cognizant of its huge problems

273
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and great values at the same time.

274
0:15:06,000 --> 0:15:11,000
I am for the second option, and I'm sure many of you are.

275
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And the key is to promote a positive African attitude towards Africa.

276
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:25,000
That's because we Africans concentrate --

277
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I am from Ethiopia, by the way --

278
0:15:27,000 --> 0:15:29,000
we concentrate too much on how we are seen

279
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:32,000
from elsewhere, or from outside.

280
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I think it's important to promote in a more positive way

281
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:4,000
on how we see ourselves.

282
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:43,000
That's what I call positive African attitude.

283
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So finally, I would like to say,

284
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:51,000
so let's help Africa walk upright and forward,

285
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:56,000
then we all can be proud of our future legacy as a species.

286
0:15:56,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Thank you.

287
0:15:58,000 --> 0:15:59,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.285,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Throughout my career, I've been fortunate enough

2
0:00:15.36,000 --> 0:00:16,000
to work with many of the great

3
0:00:16.719,000 --> 0:00:17,000
international architects,

4
0:00:18.445,000 --> 0:00:2,000
documenting their work and observing

5
0:00:20.869,000 --> 0:00:21,000
how their designs have the capacity

6
0:00:22.828,000 --> 0:00:24,000
to influence the cities in which they sit.

7
0:00:25.797,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I think of new cities like Dubai

8
0:00:28.64,000 --> 0:00:3,000
or ancient cities like Rome

9
0:00:31.117,000 --> 0:00:34,000
with Zaha Hadid's incredible MAXXI museum,

10
0:00:34.479,000 --> 0:00:36,000
or like right here in New York with the High Line,

11
0:00:37.296,000 --> 0:00:39,000
a city which has been so much influenced

12
0:00:39.867,000 --> 0:00:4,000
by the development of this.

13
0:00:41.57,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But what I find really fascinating

14
0:00:43.645,000 --> 0:00:46,000
is what happens when architects and planners leave

15
0:00:46.741,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and these places become appropriated by people,

16
0:00:49.86,000 --> 0:00:51,000
like here in Chandigarh, India,

17
0:00:52.2,000 --> 0:00:54,000
the city which has been completely designed

18
0:00:54.52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
by the architect Le Corbusier.

19
0:00:56.659,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now 60 years later, the city has been taken over

20
0:00:59.639,000 --> 0:01:,000
by people in very different ways

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
from whatever perhaps intended for,

22
0:01:04.582,000 --> 0:01:06,000
like here, where you have the people

23
0:01:06.888,000 --> 0:01:08,000
sitting in the windows of the assembly hall.

24
0:01:09.851,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But over the course of several years,

25
0:01:11.938,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I've been documenting Rem Koolhaas's

26
0:01:14.356,000 --> 0:01:16,000
CCTV building in Beijing

27
0:01:16.402,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and the olympic stadium in the same city

28
0:01:19.24,000 --> 0:01:22,000
by the architects Herzog and de Meuron.

29
0:01:22.384,000 --> 0:01:25,000
At these large-scale construction sites in China,

30
0:01:25.829,000 --> 0:01:27,000
you see a sort of makeshift camp

31
0:01:27.952,000 --> 0:01:31,000
where workers live during the entire building process.

32
0:01:32.142,000 --> 0:01:34,000
As the length of the construction takes years,

33
0:01:34.624,000 --> 0:01:36,000
workers end up forming a rather rough-and-ready

34
0:01:37.382,000 --> 0:01:4,000
informal city, making for quite a juxtaposition

35
0:01:40.648,000 --> 0:01:43,000
against the sophisticated structures that they're building.

36
0:01:44.091,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Over the past seven years, I've been following

37
0:01:46.3,000 --> 0:01:48,000
my fascination with the built environment,

38
0:01:48.971,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and for those of you who know me, you would say

39
0:01:51.674,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that this obsession has led me to live

40
0:01:53.66,000 --> 0:01:56,000
out of a suitcase 365 days a year.

41
0:01:57.082,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Being constantly on the move

42
0:01:59.579,000 --> 0:02:,000
means that sometimes I am able

43
0:02:01.394,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to catch life's most unpredictable moments,

44
0:02:04.57,000 --> 0:02:05,000
like here in New York

45
0:02:06.551,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the day after the Sandy storm hit the city.

46
0:02:10.944,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Just over three years ago,

47
0:02:13.008,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I was for the first time in Caracas, Venezuela,

48
0:02:15.694,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and while flying over the city, I was just amazed

49
0:02:18.49,000 --> 0:02:2,000
by the extent to which the slums

50
0:02:20.53,000 --> 0:02:22,000
reach into every corner of the city,

51
0:02:22.979,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a place where nearly 70 percent of the population

52
0:02:25.716,000 --> 0:02:26,000
lives in slums,

53
0:02:27.057,000 --> 0:02:3,000
draped literally all over the mountains.

54
0:02:30.35,000 --> 0:02:33,000
During a conversation with local architects Urban-Think Tank,

55
0:02:33.777,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I learned about the Torre David,

56
0:02:36.13,000 --> 0:02:38,000
a 45-story office building which sits

57
0:02:38.673,000 --> 0:02:4,000
right in the center of Caracas.

58
0:02:40.726,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The building was under construction

59
0:02:42.329,000 --> 0:02:44,000
until the collapse of the Venezuelan economy

60
0:02:44.855,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and the death of the developer in the early '90s.

61
0:02:48.221,000 --> 0:02:5,000
About eight years ago, people started moving

62
0:02:51.183,000 --> 0:02:53,000
into the abandoned tower

63
0:02:53.196,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and began to build their homes right in between

64
0:02:55.215,000 --> 0:02:58,000
every column of this unfinished tower.

65
0:02:58.414,000 --> 0:03:,000
There's only one little entrance to the entire building,

66
0:03:01.211,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and the 3,000 residents come in and out

67
0:03:04.149,000 --> 0:03:06,000
through that single door.

68
0:03:06.217,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Together, the inhabitants created public spaces

69
0:03:09.106,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and designed them to feel more like a home

70
0:03:11.379,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and less like an unfinished tower.

71
0:03:13.974,000 --> 0:03:16,000
In the lobby, they painted the walls and planted trees.

72
0:03:17.489,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They also made a basketball court.

73
0:03:20.499,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But when you look up closely,

74
0:03:22.199,000 --> 0:03:24,000
you see massive holes where elevators

75
0:03:24.68,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and services would have run through.

76
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Within the tower, people have come up

77
0:03:29.249,000 --> 0:03:31,000
with all sorts of solutions

78
0:03:31.515,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in response to the various needs

79
0:03:33.496,000 --> 0:03:36,000
which arise from living in an unfinished tower.

80
0:03:36.983,000 --> 0:03:37,000
With no elevators,

81
0:03:38.182,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the tower is like a 45-story walkup.

82
0:03:41.51,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Designed in very specific ways

83
0:03:43.76,000 --> 0:03:44,000
by this group of people

84
0:03:45.236,000 --> 0:03:48,000
who haven't had any education in architecture or design.

85
0:03:49.132,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And with each inhabitant finding their own

86
0:03:51.413,000 --> 0:03:52,000
unique way of coming by,

87
0:03:53.38,000 --> 0:03:55,000
this tower becomes like a living city,

88
0:03:56.182,000 --> 0:03:59,000
a place which is alive with micro-economies

89
0:03:59.394,000 --> 0:04:,000
and small businesses.

90
0:04:01.311,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The inventive inhabitants, for instance,

91
0:04:03.925,000 --> 0:04:05,000
find opportunities in the most unexpected cases,

92
0:04:06.656,000 --> 0:04:08,000
like the adjacent parking garage,

93
0:04:08.781,000 --> 0:04:1,000
which has been reclaimed as a taxi route

94
0:04:10.858,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to shuttle the inhabitants up through the ramps

95
0:04:13.156,000 --> 0:04:14,000
in order to shorten the hike

96
0:04:14.603,000 --> 0:04:18,000
up to the apartments.

97
0:04:18.621,000 --> 0:04:19,000
A walk through the tower

98
0:04:20.531,000 --> 0:04:22,000
reveals how residents have figured out

99
0:04:22.641,000 --> 0:04:25,000
how to create walls, how to make an air flow,

100
0:04:26.167,000 --> 0:04:27,000
how to create transparency,

101
0:04:28.13,000 --> 0:04:3,000
circulation throughout the tower,

102
0:04:30.554,000 --> 0:04:31,000
essentially creating a home

103
0:04:32.373,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that's completely adapted

104
0:04:34.021,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to the conditions of the site.

105
0:04:37.299,000 --> 0:04:39,000
When a new inhabitant moves into the tower,

106
0:04:39.424,000 --> 0:04:4,000
they already have a roof over their head,

107
0:04:41.332,000 --> 0:04:43,000
so they just typically mark their space

108
0:04:43.371,000 --> 0:04:45,000
with a few curtains or sheets.

109
0:04:46.287,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Slowly, from found materials, walls rise,

110
0:04:49.459,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and people create a space out of any found objects

111
0:04:52.382,000 --> 0:04:53,000
or materials.

112
0:04:54.271,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It's remarkable to see the design decisions

113
0:04:56.771,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that they're making,

114
0:04:58.447,000 --> 0:05:,000
like when everything is made out of red bricks,

115
0:05:01.082,000 --> 0:05:03,000
some residents will cover that red brick

116
0:05:03.347,000 --> 0:05:06,000
with another layer of red brick-patterned wallpaper

117
0:05:07.208,000 --> 0:05:12,000
just to make it a kind of clean finish.

118
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The inhabitants literally built up these homes

119
0:05:14.719,000 --> 0:05:16,000
with their own hands, and this labor of love

120
0:05:16.876,000 --> 0:05:17,000
instills a great sense of pride

121
0:05:18.629,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in many families living in this tower.

122
0:05:21.881,000 --> 0:05:23,000
They typically make the best out of their conditions,

123
0:05:24.815,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and try to make their spaces look nice and homey,

124
0:05:27.623,000 --> 0:05:3,000
or at least up until as far as they can reach.

125
0:05:31.17,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Throughout the tower, you come across

126
0:05:34.182,000 --> 0:05:36,000
all kinds of services, like the barber,

127
0:05:36.348,000 --> 0:05:39,000
small factories, and every floor has

128
0:05:40.161,000 --> 0:05:43,000
a little grocery store or shop.

129
0:05:43.585,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And you even find a church.

130
0:05:46.095,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And on the 30th floor, there is a gym

131
0:05:48.459,000 --> 0:05:49,000
where all the weights and barbells

132
0:05:50.213,000 --> 0:05:51,000
are made out of the leftover pulleys

133
0:05:52.009,000 --> 0:05:55,000
from the elevators which were never installed.

134
0:05:55.419,000 --> 0:05:57,000
From the outside, behind this always-changing facade,

135
0:05:58.054,000 --> 0:05:59,000
you see how the fixed concrete beams

136
0:05:59.673,000 --> 0:06:,000
provide a framework for the inhabitants

137
0:06:01.538,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to create their homes

138
0:06:03.005,000 --> 0:06:04,000
in an organic, intuitive way

139
0:06:04.881,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that responds directly to their needs.

140
0:06:07.598,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Let's go now to Africa, to Nigeria,

141
0:06:10.253,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to a community called Makoko,

142
0:06:12.824,000 --> 0:06:14,000
a slum where 150,000 people

143
0:06:15.383,000 --> 0:06:18,000
live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon.

144
0:06:18.565,000 --> 0:06:21,000
While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place,

145
0:06:22.279,000 --> 0:06:24,000
when you see it from above, there seems to be

146
0:06:24.685,000 --> 0:06:27,000
a whole grid of waterways and canals

147
0:06:27.85,000 --> 0:06:29,000
connecting each and every home.

148
0:06:30.364,000 --> 0:06:34,000
From the main dock, people board long wooden canoes

149
0:06:34.578,000 --> 0:06:36,000
which carry them out to their various homes and shops

150
0:06:37.248,000 --> 0:06:39,000
located in the expansive area.

151
0:06:39.923,000 --> 0:06:4,000
When out on the water, it's clear

152
0:06:41.87,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that life has been completely adapted

153
0:06:43.759,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to this very specific way of living.

154
0:06:46.398,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Even the canoes become variety stores

155
0:06:49.045,000 --> 0:06:5,000
where ladies paddle from house to house,

156
0:06:50.985,000 --> 0:06:54,000
selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits.

157
0:06:55.101,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Behind every window and door frame,

158
0:06:57.12,000 --> 0:06:59,000
you'll see a small child peering back at you,

159
0:06:59.823,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and while Makoko seems to be packed with people,

160
0:07:02.807,000 --> 0:07:03,000
what's more shocking is actually

161
0:07:04.642,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the amount of children pouring out of every building.

162
0:07:08.127,000 --> 0:07:09,000
The population growth in Nigeria,

163
0:07:10.107,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and especially in these areas like Makoko,

164
0:07:12.576,000 --> 0:07:14,000
are painful reminders

165
0:07:14.728,000 --> 0:07:18,000
of how out of control things really are.

166
0:07:18.967,000 --> 0:07:2,000
In Makoko, very few systems

167
0:07:21.246,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and infrastructures exist.

168
0:07:23.112,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Electricity is rigged and freshest water

169
0:07:26.044,000 --> 0:07:29,000
comes from self-built wells throughout the area.

170
0:07:29.409,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This entire economic model

171
0:07:31.813,000 --> 0:07:33,000
is designed to meet a specific way of living

172
0:07:34.605,000 --> 0:07:37,000
on the water, so fishing and boat-making

173
0:07:37.72,000 --> 0:07:38,000
are common professions.

174
0:07:39.495,000 --> 0:07:4,000
You'll have a set of entrepreneurs

175
0:07:41.462,000 --> 0:07:44,000
who have set up businesses throughout the area,

176
0:07:44.486,000 --> 0:07:48,000
like barbershops, CD and DVD stores,

177
0:07:49.286,000 --> 0:07:54,000
movie theaters, tailors, everything is there.

178
0:07:54.649,000 --> 0:07:55,000
There is even a photo studio

179
0:07:56.444,000 --> 0:07:57,000
where you see the sort of aspiration

180
0:07:58.201,000 --> 0:08:01,000
to live in a real house or to be associated

181
0:08:01.501,000 --> 0:08:05,000
with a faraway place, like that hotel in Sweden.

182
0:08:05.8,000 --> 0:08:06,000
On this particular evening,

183
0:08:07.424,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I came across this live band

184
0:08:09.528,000 --> 0:08:12,000
dressed to the T in their coordinating outfits.

185
0:08:12.679,000 --> 0:08:14,000
They were floating through the canals

186
0:08:14.709,000 --> 0:08:16,000
in a large canoe with a fitted-out generator

187
0:08:17.633,000 --> 0:08:21,000
for all of the community to enjoy.

188
0:08:21.969,000 --> 0:08:23,000
By nightfall, the area becomes almost pitch black,

189
0:08:24.96,000 --> 0:08:25,000
save for a small lightbulb

190
0:08:26.788,000 --> 0:08:28,000
or a fire.

191
0:08:29.522,000 --> 0:08:31,000
What originally brought me to Makoko

192
0:08:32.137,000 --> 0:08:33,000
was this project from a friend of mine,

193
0:08:33.944,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Kunlé Adeyemi, who recently finished building

194
0:08:36.745,000 --> 0:08:38,000
this three-story floating school

195
0:08:38.791,000 --> 0:08:4,000
for the kids in Makoko.

196
0:08:40.812,000 --> 0:08:43,000
With this entire village existing on the water,

197
0:08:43.841,000 --> 0:08:45,000
public space is very limited,

198
0:08:46.264,000 --> 0:08:47,000
so now that the school is finished,

199
0:08:47.928,000 --> 0:08:5,000
the ground floor is a playground for the kids,

200
0:08:51.302,000 --> 0:08:52,000
but when classes are out, the platform

201
0:08:53.169,000 --> 0:08:54,000
is just like a town square,

202
0:08:54.74,000 --> 0:08:56,000
where the fishermen mend their nets

203
0:08:57.135,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and floating shopkeepers dock their boats.

204
0:09:01.3,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Another place I'd like to share with you

205
0:09:03.83,000 --> 0:09:05,000
is the Zabbaleen in Cairo.

206
0:09:05.878,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They're descendants of farmers who began migrating

207
0:09:08.637,000 --> 0:09:1,000
from the upper Egypt in the '40s,

208
0:09:11.107,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and today they make their living

209
0:09:12.533,000 --> 0:09:15,000
by collecting and recycling waste from homes

210
0:09:15.723,000 --> 0:09:17,000
from all over Cairo.

211
0:09:17.974,000 --> 0:09:2,000
For years, the Zabbaleen would live in makeshift villages

212
0:09:21.096,000 --> 0:09:22,000
where they would move around

213
0:09:22.765,000 --> 0:09:24,000
trying to avoid the local authorities,

214
0:09:25.284,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but in the early 1980s, they settled

215
0:09:27.603,000 --> 0:09:28,000
on the Mokattam rocks

216
0:09:29.32,000 --> 0:09:31,000
just at the eastern edge of the city.

217
0:09:31.969,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Today, they live in this area,

218
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:36,000
approximately 50,000 to 70,000 people,

219
0:09:36.804,000 --> 0:09:38,000
who live in this community of self-built

220
0:09:38.937,000 --> 0:09:4,000
multi-story houses

221
0:09:41.117,000 --> 0:09:45,000
where up to three generations live in one structure.

222
0:09:45.41,000 --> 0:09:47,000
While these apartments that they built for themselves

223
0:09:47.888,000 --> 0:09:49,000
appear to lack any planning or formal grid,

224
0:09:50.873,000 --> 0:09:53,000
each family specializing in a certain form of recycling

225
0:09:54.279,000 --> 0:09:56,000
means that the ground floor of each apartment

226
0:09:56.512,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is reserved for garbage-related activities

227
0:10:00.169,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and the upper floor is dedicated to living space.

228
0:10:04.192,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I find it incredible to see

229
0:10:06.063,000 --> 0:10:07,000
how these piles and piles of garbage

230
0:10:07.999,000 --> 0:10:09,000
are invisible to the people who live there,

231
0:10:10.51,000 --> 0:10:13,000
like this very distinguished man who is posing

232
0:10:13.91,000 --> 0:10:17,000
while all this garbage is sort of streaming out behind him,

233
0:10:18.119,000 --> 0:10:2,000
or like these two young men who are sitting

234
0:10:20.759,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and chatting amongst these tons of garbage.

235
0:10:25.611,000 --> 0:10:26,000
While to most of us, living amongst

236
0:10:27.344,000 --> 0:10:29,000
these piles and piles of garbage

237
0:10:29.432,000 --> 0:10:31,000
may seem totally uninhabitable,

238
0:10:31.783,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to those in the Zabbaleen, this is just

239
0:10:33.873,000 --> 0:10:35,000
a different type of normal.

240
0:10:36.352,000 --> 0:10:38,000
In all these places I've talked about today,

241
0:10:38.989,000 --> 0:10:4,000
what I do find fascinating is that there's really

242
0:10:41.11,000 --> 0:10:42,000
no such thing as normal,

243
0:10:42.708,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and it proves that people are able to adapt

244
0:10:44.913,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to any kind of situation.

245
0:10:47.288,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Throughout the day, it's quite common

246
0:10:48.804,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to come across a small party taking place

247
0:10:52.152,000 --> 0:10:55,000
in the streets, just like this engagement party.

248
0:10:55.996,000 --> 0:10:56,000
In this tradition, the bride-to-be

249
0:10:57.983,000 --> 0:10:59,000
displays all of their belongings,

250
0:11:00.128,000 --> 0:11:02,000
which they soon bring to their new husband.

251
0:11:02.322,000 --> 0:11:04,000
A gathering like this one

252
0:11:04.353,000 --> 0:11:05,000
offers such a juxtaposition

253
0:11:06.25,000 --> 0:11:08,000
where all the new stuff is displayed

254
0:11:09.028,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and all the garbage is used

255
0:11:11.394,000 --> 0:11:17,000
as props to display all their new home accessories.

256
0:11:18.031,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Like Makoko and the Torre David,

257
0:11:20.197,000 --> 0:11:21,000
throughout the Zabbaleen you'll find all

258
0:11:21.742,000 --> 0:11:24,000
the same facilities as in any typical neighborhood.

259
0:11:24.886,000 --> 0:11:26,000
There are the retail shops, the cafes

260
0:11:26.966,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and the restaurants, and the community

261
0:11:29.286,000 --> 0:11:31,000
is this community of Coptic Christians,

262
0:11:32.227,000 --> 0:11:34,000
so you'll also find a church,

263
0:11:34.466,000 --> 0:11:37,000
along with the scores of religious iconographies

264
0:11:37.911,000 --> 0:11:38,000
throughout the area,

265
0:11:39.669,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and also all the everyday services

266
0:11:42.858,000 --> 0:11:43,000
like the electronic repair shops,

267
0:11:44.657,000 --> 0:11:47,000
the barbers, everything.

268
0:11:47.745,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Visiting the homes of the Zabbaleen

269
0:11:49.918,000 --> 0:11:5,000
is also full of surprises.

270
0:11:51.607,000 --> 0:11:52,000
While from the outside,

271
0:11:53.119,000 --> 0:11:55,000
these homes look like any other informal structure

272
0:11:55.662,000 --> 0:11:57,000
in the city, when you step inside,

273
0:11:57.98,000 --> 0:12:,000
you are met with all manner of design decisions

274
0:12:01.843,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and interior decoration.

275
0:12:04.11,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Despite having limited access to space and money,

276
0:12:07.274,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the homes in the area are designed

277
0:12:09.153,000 --> 0:12:1,000
with care and detail.

278
0:12:11.139,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Every apartment is unique,

279
0:12:13.182,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and this individuality tells a story

280
0:12:14.975,000 --> 0:12:17,000
about each family's circumstances and values.

281
0:12:18.101,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Many of these people take their homes

282
0:12:20.247,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and interior spaces very seriously,

283
0:12:23.415,000 --> 0:12:24,000
putting a lot of work and care

284
0:12:24.922,000 --> 0:12:25,000
into the details.

285
0:12:26.248,000 --> 0:12:29,000
The shared spaces are also treated in the same manner,

286
0:12:29.421,000 --> 0:12:32,000
where walls are decorated in faux marble patterns.

287
0:12:33.278,000 --> 0:12:35,000
But despite this elaborate decor,

288
0:12:36.261,000 --> 0:12:38,000
sometimes these apartments are used

289
0:12:38.815,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in very unexpected ways,

290
0:12:40.625,000 --> 0:12:42,000
like this home which caught my attention

291
0:12:43.005,000 --> 0:12:46,000
while all the mud and the grass was literally

292
0:12:46.487,000 --> 0:12:48,000
seeping out under the front door.

293
0:12:48.974,000 --> 0:12:51,000
When I was let in, it appeared that this fifth-floor apartment

294
0:12:52.773,000 --> 0:12:55,000
was being transformed into a complete animal farm,

295
0:12:56.081,000 --> 0:12:58,000
where six or seven cows stood grazing

296
0:12:58.972,000 --> 0:13:02,000
in what otherwise would be the living room.

297
0:13:03.644,000 --> 0:13:06,000
But then in the apartment across the hall

298
0:13:07.012,000 --> 0:13:09,000
from this cow shed lives a newly married couple

299
0:13:09.535,000 --> 0:13:1,000
in what locals describe

300
0:13:11.361,000 --> 0:13:19,000
as one of the nicest apartments in the area.

301
0:13:19.482,000 --> 0:13:22,000
The attention to this detail astonished me,

302
0:13:22.708,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and as the owner of the home so proudly

303
0:13:25.379,000 --> 0:13:26,000
led me around this apartment,

304
0:13:27.365,000 --> 0:13:3,000
from floor to ceiling, every part was decorated.

305
0:13:31.081,000 --> 0:13:34,000
But if it weren't for the strangely familiar

306
0:13:34.883,000 --> 0:13:36,000
stomach-churning odor that constantly

307
0:13:37.746,000 --> 0:13:4,000
passes through the apartment,

308
0:13:41.191,000 --> 0:13:43,000
it would be easy to forget

309
0:13:43.784,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that you are standing next to a cow shed

310
0:13:46.476,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and on top of a landfill.

311
0:13:51.973,000 --> 0:13:53,000
What moved me the most was that despite

312
0:13:54.652,000 --> 0:13:56,000
these seemingly inhospitable conditions,

313
0:13:56.686,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I was welcomed with open arms

314
0:13:58.479,000 --> 0:14:01,000
into a home that was made with love, care,

315
0:14:02.405,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and unreserved passion.

316
0:14:04.655,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Let's move across the map to China,

317
0:14:08.039,000 --> 0:14:11,000
to an area called Shanxi, Henan and Gansu.

318
0:14:11.926,000 --> 0:14:14,000
In a region famous for the soft, porous Loess Plateau soil,

319
0:14:15.616,000 --> 0:14:17,000
there lived until recently an estimated

320
0:14:18.299,000 --> 0:14:21,000
40 million people in these houses underground.

321
0:14:22.168,000 --> 0:14:24,000
These dwellings are called the yaodongs.

322
0:14:24.619,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Through this architecture by subtraction,

323
0:14:26.809,000 --> 0:14:29,000
these yaodongs are built literally inside of the soil.

324
0:14:30.396,000 --> 0:14:33,000
In these villages, you see an entirely altered landscape,

325
0:14:34.27,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and hidden behind these mounds of dirt

326
0:14:37.016,000 --> 0:14:39,000
are these square, rectangular houses

327
0:14:39.516,000 --> 0:14:41,000
which sit seven meters below the ground.

328
0:14:42.107,000 --> 0:14:43,000
When I asked people why they were digging

329
0:14:44.095,000 --> 0:14:45,000
their houses from the ground,

330
0:14:45.984,000 --> 0:14:47,000
they simply replied that they are poor wheat

331
0:14:48.007,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and apple farmers who didn't have the money

332
0:14:50.187,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to buy materials, and this digging out

333
0:14:53.588,000 --> 0:14:57,000
was their most logical form of living.

334
0:14:58.056,000 --> 0:15:,000
From Makoko to Zabbaleen, these communities

335
0:15:00.954,000 --> 0:15:01,000
have approached the tasks of planning,

336
0:15:02.953,000 --> 0:15:04,000
design and management of their communities

337
0:15:05.352,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and neighborhoods in ways that respond

338
0:15:07.731,000 --> 0:15:1,000
specifically to their environment and circumstances.

339
0:15:11.641,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Created by these very people who live,

340
0:15:13.872,000 --> 0:15:16,000
work and play in these particular spaces,

341
0:15:17.583,000 --> 0:15:19,000
these neighborhoods are intuitively designed

342
0:15:20.58,000 --> 0:15:23,000
to make the most of their circumstances.

343
0:15:23.618,000 --> 0:15:24,000
In most of these places, the government

344
0:15:25.523,000 --> 0:15:27,000
is completely absent, leaving inhabitants

345
0:15:28.052,000 --> 0:15:31,000
with no choice but to reappropriate found materials,

346
0:15:31.971,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and while these communities are highly disadvantaged,

347
0:15:34.943,000 --> 0:15:36,000
they do present examples

348
0:15:36.985,000 --> 0:15:38,000
of brilliant forms of ingenuity,

349
0:15:39.433,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and prove that indeed we have the ability

350
0:15:41.761,000 --> 0:15:44,000
to adapt to all manner of circumstances.

351
0:15:45.304,000 --> 0:15:47,000
What makes places like the Torre David

352
0:15:47.497,000 --> 0:15:48,000
particularly remarkable

353
0:15:49.294,000 --> 0:15:5,000
is this sort of skeleton framework

354
0:15:51.195,000 --> 0:15:52,000
where people can have a foundation

355
0:15:52.817,000 --> 0:15:54,000
where they can tap into.

356
0:15:54.889,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Now imagine what these already ingenious communities

357
0:15:57.987,000 --> 0:15:59,000
could create themselves,

358
0:16:00.079,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and how highly particular their solutions would be,

359
0:16:02.765,000 --> 0:16:04,000
if they were given the basic infrastructures

360
0:16:05.307,000 --> 0:16:06,000
that they could tap into.

361
0:16:07.286,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Today, you see these large residential development projects

362
0:16:10.793,000 --> 0:16:12,000
which offer cookie-cutter housing solutions

363
0:16:13.248,000 --> 0:16:15,000
to massive amounts of people.

364
0:16:15.29,000 --> 0:16:17,000
From China to Brazil, these projects attempt

365
0:16:17.85,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to provide as many houses as possible,

366
0:16:20.857,000 --> 0:16:22,000
but they're completely generic

367
0:16:23.06,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and simply do not work as an answer

368
0:16:24.965,000 --> 0:16:27,000
to the individual needs of the people.

369
0:16:28.294,000 --> 0:16:3,000
I would like to end with a quote

370
0:16:30.748,000 --> 0:16:33,000
from a friend of mine and a source of inspiration,

371
0:16:33.829,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Zita Cobb, the founder of the wonderful

372
0:16:36.595,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Shorefast Foundation,

373
0:16:38.271,000 --> 0:16:41,000
based out of Fogo Island, Newfoundland.

374
0:16:41.36,000 --> 0:16:43,000
She says that "there's this plague of sameness

375
0:16:44.201,000 --> 0:16:45,000
which is killing the human joy,"

376
0:16:46.124,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and I couldn't agree with her more.

377
0:16:48.419,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Thank you.

378
0:16:49.862,000 --> 0:16:52,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The immersive ugliness

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:34,000
of our everyday environments in America

3
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is entropy made visible.

4
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We can't overestimate the amount of despair

5
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that we are generating with places like this.

6
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And mostly, I want to persuade you that we have to do better

7
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:56,000
if we're going to continue the project of civilization in America.

8
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:,000
By the way, this doesn't help.

9
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Nobody's having a better day down here because of that.

10
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
There are a lot of ways you can describe this.

11
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
You know, I like to call it "the national automobile slum."

12
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You can call it suburban sprawl.

13
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I think it's appropriate to call it

14
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the greatest misallocation of resources in the history of the world.

15
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:27,000
You can call it a technosis externality clusterfuck.

16
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And it's a tremendous problem for us.

17
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
The outstanding -- the salient problem about this for us

18
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:4,000
is that these are places that are not worth caring about.

19
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
We're going to talk about that some more.

20
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
A sense of place:

21
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:52,000
your ability to create places that are meaningful and places of quality and character

22
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:57,000
depends entirely on your ability to define space with buildings,

23
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and to employ the vocabularies, grammars,

24
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:05,000
syntaxes, rhythms and patterns of architecture

25
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in order to inform us who we are.

26
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:14,000
The public realm in America has two roles:

27
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:19,000
it is the dwelling place of our civilization and our civic life,

28
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and it is the physical manifestation of the common good.

29
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And when you degrade the public realm,

30
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:3,000
you will automatically degrade the quality of your civic life

31
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and the character of all the enactments of your public life and communal life that take place there.

32
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The public realm comes mostly in the form of the street in America

33
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because we don't have the 1,000-year-old cathedral plazas

34
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and market squares of older cultures.

35
0:02:52,000 --> 0:03:,000
And your ability to define space and to create places that are worth caring about

36
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:05,000
all comes from a body of culture that we call the culture of civic design.

37
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This is a body of knowledge, method, skill and principle

38
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that we threw in the garbage after World War II

39
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and decided we don't need that anymore; we're not going to use it.

40
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And consequently, we can see the result all around us.

41
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The public realm has to inform us not only where we are geographically,

42
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but it has to inform us where we are in our culture.

43
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Where we've come from, what kind of people we are, and it needs to,

44
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:43,000
by doing that, it needs to afford us a glimpse to where we're going

45
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in order to allow us to dwell in a hopeful present.

46
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And if there is one tremendous --

47
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
if there is one great catastrophe about the places that we've built,

48
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the human environments we've made for ourselves in the last 50 years,

49
0:03:57,000 --> 0:04:06,000
it is that it has deprived us of the ability to live in a hopeful present.

50
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The environments we are living in, more typically, are like these.

51
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:16,000
You know, this happens to be the asteroid belt of architectural garbage two miles north of my town.

52
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And remember, to create a place of character and quality,

53
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:22,000
you have to be able to define space.

54
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So how is that being accomplished here?

55
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
If you stand on the apron of the Wal-Mart over here

56
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and try to look at the Target store over here,

57
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:35,000
you can't see it because of the curvature of the Earth. (Laughter)

58
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:41,000
That's nature's way of telling you that you're doing a poor job of defining space.

59
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Consequently, these will be places that nobody wants to be in.

60
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:48,000
These will be places that are not worth caring about.

61
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We have about, you know, 38,000 places

62
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that are not worth caring about in the United States today.

63
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:59,000
When we have enough of them, we're going to have a nation that's not worth defending.

64
0:04:59,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And I want you to think about that when you think about

65
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
those young men and women who are over in places like Iraq,

66
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
spilling their blood in the sand,

67
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and ask yourself, "What is their last thought of home?"

68
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I hope it's not the curb cut between the Chuck E. Cheese and the Target store

69
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
because that's not good enough for Americans to be spilling their blood for. (Applause)

70
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We need better places in this country.

71
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Public space. This is a good public space.

72
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It's a place worth caring about. It's well defined.

73
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It is emphatically an outdoor public room.

74
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It has something that is terribly important --

75
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
it has what's called an active and permeable membrane around the edge.

76
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:44,000
That's a fancy way of saying it's got shops, bars, bistros, destinations --

77
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:47,000
things go in and out of it. It's permeable.

78
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:5,000
The beer goes in and out, the waitresses go in and out,

79
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and that activates the center of this place and makes it a place that people want to hang out in.

80
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
You know, in these places in other cultures,

81
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:03,000
people just go there voluntarily because they like them.

82
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We don't have to have a craft fair here to get people to come here. (Laughter)

83
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
You know, you don't have to have a Kwanzaa festival.

84
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:13,000
People just go because it's pleasurable to be there.

85
0:06:13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But this is how we do it in the United States.

86
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Probably the most significant public space failure in America,

87
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
designed by the leading architects of the day, Harry Cobb and I.M. Pei:

88
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Boston City Hall Plaza.

89
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:33,000
A public place so dismal that the winos don't even want to go there. (Laughter)

90
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And we can't fix it because I.M. Pei's still alive,

91
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and every year Harvard and M.I.T. have a joint committee to repair it.

92
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And every year they fail to because they don't want to hurt I.M. Pei's feelings.

93
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This is the other side of the building.

94
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:5,000
This was the winner of an international design award in, I think, 1966, something like that.

95
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It wasn't Pei and Cobb, another firm designed this,

96
0:06:53,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but there's not enough Prozac in the world to make people feel OK about going down this block.

97
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:06,000
This is the back of Boston City Hall,

98
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the most important, you know, significant civic building in Albany -- excuse me -- in Boston.

99
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And what is the message that is coming,

100
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
what are the vocabularies and grammars that are coming, from this building

101
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and how is it informing us about who we are?

102
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:26,000
This, in fact, would be a better building if we put mosaic portraits

103
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
of Josef Stalin, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein,

104
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and all the other great despots of the 20th century on the side of the building,

105
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because then we'd honestly be saying what the building is really communicating to us.

106
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:41,000
You know, that it's a despotic building;

107
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:49,000
it wants us to feel like termites. (Laughter)

108
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
This is it on a smaller scale:

109
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the back of the civic center in my town, Saratoga Springs, New York.

110
0:07:55,000 --> 0:08:,000
By the way, when I showed this slide to a group of Kiwanians in my town,

111
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:05,000
they all rose in indignation from their creamed chicken, (Laughter)

112
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and they shouted at me and said,

113
0:08:08,000 --> 0:08:12,000
"It was raining that day when you took that picture!"

114
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Because this was perceived to be a weather problem. (Laughter)

115
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:29,000
You know, this is a building designed like a DVD player. (Laughter)

116
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Audio jack, power supply --

117
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and look, you know these things are important architectural jobs for firms, right?

118
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:41,000
You know, we hire firms to design these things.

119
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:45,000
You can see exactly what went on, three o'clock in the morning at the design meeting.

120
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:47,000
You know, eight hours before deadline,

121
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:51,000
four architects trying to get this building in on time, right?

122
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And they're sitting there at the long boardroom table

123
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:56,000
with all the drawings, and the renderings,

124
0:08:56,000 --> 0:09:,000
and all the Chinese food caskets are lying on the table, and --

125
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I mean, what was the conversation that was going on there? (Laughter)

126
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Because you know what the last word was, what the last sentence was of that meeting.

127
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It was: "Fuck it." (Laughter) (Applause)

128
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
That -- that is the message of this form of architecture.

129
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The message is: We don't give a fuck! We don't give a fuck.

130
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So I went back on the nicest day of the year, just to --

131
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:33,000
you know -- do some reality testing,

132
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and in fact, he will not even go down there because (Laughter)

133
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
it's not interesting enough for his clients,

134
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
you know, the burglars, the muggers.

135
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It's not civically rich enough for them to go down there.

136
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:48,000
OK.

137
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
The pattern of Main Street USA --

138
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in fact, this pattern of building downtown blocks, all over the world, is fairly universal.

139
0:09:57,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It's not that complicated:

140
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:05,000
buildings more than one story high, built out to the sidewalk edge,

141
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:08,000
so that people who are, you know, all kinds of people can get into the building.

142
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Other activities are allowed to occur upstairs,

143
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:15,000
you know, apartments, offices, and so on.

144
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:19,000
You make provision for this activity called shopping on the ground floor.

145
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
They haven't learned that in Monterey.

146
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:25,000
If you go out to the corner right at the main intersection right in front of this conference center,

147
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:28,000
you'll see an intersection with four blank walls on every corner.

148
0:10:28,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It's really incredible.

149
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Anyway, this is how you compose and assemble a downtown business building,

150
0:10:34,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and this is what happened when in Glens Falls, New York,

151
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
when we tried to do it again, where it was missing, right?

152
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So the first thing they do is they pop up the retail a half a story above grade to make it sporty.

153
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:51,000
OK. That completely destroys the relationship between the business and the sidewalk,

154
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:54,000
where the theoretical pedestrians are. (Laughter)

155
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Of course, they'll never be there, as long as this is in that condition.

156
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Then because the relationship between the retail is destroyed,

157
0:11:02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
we pop a handicapped ramp on that,

158
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and then to make ourselves feel better, we put a nature Band-Aid in front of it.

159
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And that's how we do it.

160
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I call them "nature Band-Aids" because there's a general idea in America

161
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that the remedy for mutilated urbanism is nature.

162
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And in fact, the remedy for wounded and mutilated urbanism is good urbanism, good buildings.

163
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Not just flower beds, not just cartoons of the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

164
0:11:33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
You know, that's not good enough.

165
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We have to do good buildings.

166
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:39,000
The street trees have really four jobs to do and that's it:

167
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:42,000
To spatially denote the pedestrian realm,

168
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:47,000
to protect the pedestrians from the vehicles in the carriageway,

169
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:5,000
to filter the sunlight onto the sidewalk,

170
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and to soften the hardscape of the buildings

171
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and to create a ceiling -- a vaulted ceiling -- over the street, at its best.

172
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:,000
And that's it. Those are the four jobs of the street trees.

173
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
They're not supposed to be a cartoon of the North Woods;

174
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:08,000
they're not supposed to be a set for "The Last of the Mohicans."

175
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:16,000
You know, one of the problems with the fiasco of suburbia is that it destroyed our understanding

176
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
of the distinction between the country and the town, between the urban and the rural.

177
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
They're not the same thing.

178
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And we're not going to cure the problems of the urban by dragging the country into the city,

179
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
which is what a lot of us are trying to do all the time.

180
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Here you see it on a small scale -- the mothership has landed,

181
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:38,000
R2-D2 and C-3PO have stepped out to test the bark mulch

182
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to see if they can inhabit this planet. (Laughter)

183
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:48,000
A lot of this comes from the fact that the industrial city in America was such a trauma

184
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that we developed this tremendous aversion for the whole idea of the city,

185
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:54,000
city life, and everything connected with it.

186
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And so what you see fairly early, in the mid-19th century,

187
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:03,000
is this idea that we now have to have an antidote to the industrial city,

188
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
which is going to be life in the country for everybody.

189
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And that starts to be delivered in the form of the railroad suburb:

190
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the country villa along the railroad line,

191
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:16,000
which allows people to enjoy the amenity of the city,

192
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
but to return to the countryside every night.

193
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And believe me, there were no Wal-Marts or convenience stores out there then,

194
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
so it really was a form of country living.

195
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:27,000
But what happens is, of course, it mutates over the next 80 years

196
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and it turns into something rather insidious.

197
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It becomes a cartoon of a country house, in a cartoon of the country.

198
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And that's the great non-articulated agony of suburbia

199
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and one of the reasons that it lends itself to ridicule.

200
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Because it hasn't delivered what it's been promising for half a century now.

201
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And these are typically the kind of dwellings we find there, you know.

202
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Basically, a house with nothing on the side

203
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
because this house wants to state, emphatically,

204
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:58,000
"I'm a little cabin in the woods. There's nothing on either side of me.

205
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
I don't have any eyes on the side of my head. I can't see."

206
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So you have this one last facade of the house,

207
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:07,000
the front, which is really a cartoon of a facade of a house.

208
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Because -- notice the porch here.

209
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Unless the people that live here are Munchkins, nobody's going to be using that.

210
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
This is really, in fact, a television broadcasting a show 24/7 called "We're Normal."

211
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:25,000
We're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.

212
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Please respect us, we're normal, we're normal, we're normal.

213
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:29,000
But we know what's going on in these houses, you know.

214
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We know that little Skippy is loading his Uzi down here,

215
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
getting ready for homeroom. (Laughter)

216
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We know that Heather, his sister Heather, 14 years old,

217
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:43,000
is turning tricks up here to support her drug habit.

218
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Because these places, these habitats,

219
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:51,000
are inducing immense amounts of anxiety and depression in children,

220
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and they don't have a lot of experience with medication.

221
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:57,000
So they take the first one that comes along, often.

222
0:14:57,000 --> 0:14:59,000
These are not good enough for Americans.

223
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:02,000
These are the schools we are sending them to:

224
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:08,000
The Hannibal Lecter Central School, Las Vegas, Nevada.

225
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:1,000
This is a real school!

226
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:14,000
You know, but there's obviously a notion that if you let the inmates of this thing out,

227
0:15:14,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that they would snatch a motorist off the street and eat his liver.

228
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:23,000
So every effort is made to keep them within the building.

229
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Notice that nature is present. (Laughter)

230
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:32,000
We're going to have to change this behavior whether we like it or not.

231
0:15:32,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We are entering an epochal period of change in the world, and -- certainly in America

232
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:42,000
-- the period that will be characterized by the end of the cheap oil era.

233
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:46,000
It is going to change absolutely everything.

234
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Chris asked me not to go on too long about this, and I won't,

235
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:52,000
except to say there's not going to be a hydrogen economy.

236
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Forget it. It's not going to happen.

237
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:56,000
We're going to have to do something else instead.

238
0:15:56,000 --> 0:16:01,000
We're going to have to down-scale, re-scale, and re-size

239
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:05,000
virtually everything we do in this country and we can't start soon enough to do it.

240
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:09,000
We're going to have -- (Applause) -- we're going to have to live closer to where we work.

241
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
We're going to have to live closer to each other.

242
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:15,000
We're going have to grow more food closer to where we live.

243
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:2,000
The age of the 3,000 mile Caesar salad is coming to an end.

244
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:25,000
We're going to have to -- we have a railroad system that the Bulgarians would be ashamed of!

245
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:27,000
We gotta do better than that!

246
0:16:27,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And we should have started two days before yesterday.

247
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:35,000
We are fortunate that the new urbanists were there, for the last 10 years,

248
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:39,000
excavating all that information that was thrown in the garbage

249
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:42,000
by our parents' generation after World War II.

250
0:16:42,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Because we're going to need it if we're going to learn how to reconstruct towns.

251
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:5,000
We're going to need to get back this body of methodology and principle and skill

252
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:56,000
in order to re-learn how to compose meaningful places, places that are integral,

253
0:16:56,000 --> 0:17:03,000
that allow -- that are living organisms in the sense that they contain all the organs of our civic life

254
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:08,000
and our communal life, deployed in an integral fashion.

255
0:17:08,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So that, you know, the residences make sense

256
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:16,000
deployed in relation to the places of business, of culture and of governance.

257
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
We're going to have to re-learn what the building blocks of these things are:

258
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:26,000
the street, the block, how to compose public space that's both large and small,

259
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
the courtyard, the civic square

260
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and how to really make use of this property.

261
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:35,000
We can see some of the first ideas

262
0:17:35,000 --> 0:17:4,000
for retro-fitting some of the catastrophic property that we have in America.

263
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:43,000
The dead malls: what are we going to do with them?

264
0:17:43,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Well, in point of fact, most of them are not going to make it.

265
0:17:45,000 --> 0:17:47,000
They're not going to be retro-fitted;

266
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:49,000
they're going to be the salvage yards of the future.

267
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Some of them we're going to fix, though.

268
0:17:51,000 --> 0:17:55,000
And we're going to fix them by imposing back on them street and block systems

269
0:17:55,000 --> 0:18:,000
and returning to the building lot as the normal increment of development.

270
0:18:01,000 --> 0:18:07,000
And if we're lucky, the result will be revivified town centers and neighborhood centers

271
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:09,000
in our existing towns and cities.

272
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:14,000
And by the way, our towns and cities are where they are, and grew where they were

273
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:16,000
because they occupy all the important sites.

274
0:18:16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
And most of them are still going to be there,

275
0:18:19,000 --> 0:18:24,000
although the scale of them is probably going to be diminished.

276
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:26,000
We've got a lot of work to do.

277
0:18:26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
We're not going to be rescued by the hyper-car; we're not going to be rescued by alternative fuels.

278
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:34,000
No amount or combination of alternative fuels

279
0:18:34,000 --> 0:18:38,000
is going to allow us to continue running what we're running, the way we're running it.

280
0:18:38,000 --> 0:18:41,000
We're going to have to do everything very differently.

281
0:18:41,000 --> 0:18:43,000
And America's not prepared.

282
0:18:43,000 --> 0:18:46,000
We are sleepwalking into the future.

283
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:49,000
We're not ready for what's coming at us.

284
0:18:49,000 --> 0:18:52,000
So I urge you all to do what you can.

285
0:18:52,000 --> 0:18:59,000
Life in the mid-21st century is going to be about living locally.

286
0:18:59,000 --> 0:19:01,000
Be prepared to be good neighbors.

287
0:19:02,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Be prepared to find vocations that make you useful

288
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:09,000
to your neighbors and to your fellow citizens.

289
0:19:09,000 --> 0:19:12,000
One final thing -- I've been very disturbed about this for years,

290
0:19:12,000 --> 0:19:15,000
but I think it's particularly important for this audience.

291
0:19:15,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Please, please, stop referring to yourselves as "consumers." OK?

292
0:19:21,000 --> 0:19:23,000
Consumers are different than citizens.

293
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:28,000
Consumers do not have obligations, responsibilities and duties

294
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:3,000
to their fellow human beings.

295
0:19:3,000 --> 0:19:33,000
And as long as you're using that word consumer in the public discussion,

296
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:37,000
you will be degrading the quality of the discussion we're having.

297
0:19:37,000 --> 0:19:4,000
And we're going to continue being clueless

298
0:19:4,000 --> 0:19:43,000
going into this very difficult future that we face.

299
0:19:43,000 --> 0:19:44,000
So thank you very much.

300
0:19:44,000 --> 0:19:5,000
Please go out and do what you can to make this a land full of places that are worth caring about

301
0:19:5,000 --> 0:19:53,000
and a nation that will be worth defending. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.835,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I love a great mystery,

2
0:00:14.901,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and I'm fascinated by the greatest unsolved mystery in science,

3
0:00:19.313,000 --> 0:00:2,000
perhaps because it's personal.

4
0:00:21.681,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's about who we are,

5
0:00:23.539,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and I can't help but be curious.

6
0:00:26.186,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The mystery is this:

7
0:00:28.275,000 --> 0:00:31,000
What is the relationship between your brain

8
0:00:31.71,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and your conscious experiences,

9
0:00:33.221,000 --> 0:00:35,000
such as your experience of the taste of chocolate

10
0:00:35.891,000 --> 0:00:36,000
or the feeling of velvet?

11
0:00:38.805,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now, this mystery is not new.

12
0:00:40.999,000 --> 0:00:43,000
In 1868, Thomas Huxley wrote,

13
0:00:44.598,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"How it is that anything so remarkable as a state of consciousness comes about

14
0:00:49.892,000 --> 0:00:52,000
as the result of irritating nervous tissue

15
0:00:53.259,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is just as unaccountable

16
0:00:55.325,000 --> 0:00:59,000
as the appearance of the genie when Aladdin rubbed his lamp."

17
0:01:01.268,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Now, Huxley knew that brain activity

18
0:01:03.545,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and conscious experiences are correlated,

19
0:01:06.819,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but he didn't know why.

20
0:01:08.978,000 --> 0:01:11,000
To the science of his day, it was a mystery.

21
0:01:12.299,000 --> 0:01:14,000
In the years since Huxley,

22
0:01:14.435,000 --> 0:01:17,000
science has learned a lot about brain activity,

23
0:01:17.801,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but the relationship between brain activity

24
0:01:19.822,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and conscious experiences is still a mystery.

25
0:01:22.91,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Why? Why have we made so little progress?

26
0:01:26.555,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Well, some experts think that we can't solve this problem

27
0:01:31.414,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because we lack the necessary concepts and intelligence.

28
0:01:35.883,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We don't expect monkeys to solve problems in quantum mechanics,

29
0:01:39.952,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and as it happens, we can't expect our species to solve this problem either.

30
0:01:44.527,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Well, I disagree. I'm more optimistic.

31
0:01:47.661,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I think we've simply made a false assumption.

32
0:01:50.703,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Once we fix it, we just might solve this problem.

33
0:01:54.209,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Today, I'd like tell you what that assumption is,

34
0:01:56.626,000 --> 0:01:58,000
why it's false, and how to fix it.

35
0:01:59.874,000 --> 0:02:,000
Let's begin with a question:

36
0:02:01.778,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Do we see reality as it is?

37
0:02:04.866,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I open my eyes

38
0:02:06.561,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato a meter away.

39
0:02:12.606,000 --> 0:02:15,000
As a result, I come to believe that in reality,

40
0:02:15.849,000 --> 0:02:17,000
there's a red tomato a meter away.

41
0:02:18.751,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I then close my eyes, and my experience changes to a gray field,

42
0:02:24.425,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but is it still the case that in reality, there's a red tomato a meter away?

43
0:02:30.361,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I think so, but could I be wrong?

44
0:02:33.913,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Could I be misinterpreting the nature of my perceptions?

45
0:02:39.351,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We have misinterpreted our perceptions before.

46
0:02:42.551,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We used to think the Earth is flat, because it looks that way.

47
0:02:46.707,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Pythagorus discovered that we were wrong.

48
0:02:49.586,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of the Universe,

49
0:02:53.603,000 --> 0:02:54,000
again because it looks that way.

50
0:02:56.406,000 --> 0:03:,000
Copernicus and Galileo discovered, again, that we were wrong.

51
0:03:01.312,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Galileo then wondered if we might be misinterpreting our experiences

52
0:03:05.4,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in other ways.

53
0:03:06.908,000 --> 0:03:11,000
He wrote: "I think that tastes, odors, colors, and so on

54
0:03:11.917,000 --> 0:03:13,000
reside in consciousness.

55
0:03:14.291,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Hence if the living creature were removed, all these qualities would be annihilated."

56
0:03:20.955,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Now, that's a stunning claim.

57
0:03:23.184,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Could Galileo be right?

58
0:03:24.995,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Could we really be misinterpreting our experiences that badly?

59
0:03:29.593,000 --> 0:03:31,000
What does modern science have to say about this?

60
0:03:32.704,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Well, neuroscientists tell us that about a third of the brain's cortex

61
0:03:37.928,000 --> 0:03:38,000
is engaged in vision.

62
0:03:39.786,000 --> 0:03:42,000
When you simply open your eyes and look about this room,

63
0:03:43.292,000 --> 0:03:47,000
billions of neurons and trillions of synapses are engaged.

64
0:03:47.564,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now, this is a bit surprising,

65
0:03:49.172,000 --> 0:03:51,000
because to the extent that we think about vision at all,

66
0:03:51.813,000 --> 0:03:53,000
we think of it as like a camera.

67
0:03:54.65,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It just takes a picture of objective reality as it is.

68
0:03:58.59,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Now, there is a part of vision that's like a camera:

69
0:04:02.29,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the eye has a lens that focuses an image on the back of the eye

70
0:04:06.929,000 --> 0:04:09,000
where there are 130 million photoreceptors,

71
0:04:10.319,000 --> 0:04:13,000
so the eye is like a 130-megapixel camera.

72
0:04:14.219,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But that doesn't explain the billions of neurons

73
0:04:17.702,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and trillions of synapses that are engaged in vision.

74
0:04:21.324,000 --> 0:04:23,000
What are these neurons up to?

75
0:04:23.623,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Well, neuroscientists tell us that they are creating, in real time,

76
0:04:27.83,000 --> 0:04:31,000
all the shapes, objects, colors, and motions that we see.

77
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It feels like we're just taking a snapshot of this room the way it is,

78
0:04:35.651,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but in fact, we're constructing everything that we see.

79
0:04:39.226,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We don't construct the whole world at once.

80
0:04:42.407,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We construct what we need in the moment.

81
0:04:45.542,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Now, there are many demonstrations that are quite compelling

82
0:04:48.909,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that we construct what we see.

83
0:04:50.72,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I'll just show you two.

84
0:04:52.763,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In this example, you see some red discs with bits cut out of them,

85
0:04:58.529,000 --> 0:05:,000
but if I just rotate the disks a little bit,

86
0:05:01.47,000 --> 0:05:05,000
suddenly, you see a 3D cube pop out of the screen.

87
0:05:06.207,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now, the screen of course is flat,

88
0:05:09.04,000 --> 0:05:11,000
so the three-dimensional cube that you're experiencing

89
0:05:11.64,000 --> 0:05:13,000
must be your construction.

90
0:05:15.397,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In this next example,

91
0:05:17.31,000 --> 0:05:21,000
you see glowing blue bars with pretty sharp edges

92
0:05:21.534,000 --> 0:05:24,000
moving across a field of dots.

93
0:05:25.708,000 --> 0:05:28,000
In fact, no dots move.

94
0:05:28.845,000 --> 0:05:32,000
All I'm doing from frame to frame is changing the colors of dots

95
0:05:33.466,000 --> 0:05:35,000
from blue to black or black to blue.

96
0:05:35.927,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But when I do this quickly,

97
0:05:37.761,000 --> 0:05:4,000
your visual system creates the glowing blue bars

98
0:05:41.476,000 --> 0:05:43,000
with the sharp edges and the motion.

99
0:05:44.147,000 --> 0:05:46,000
There are many more examples, but these are just two

100
0:05:46.817,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that you construct what you see.

101
0:05:49.58,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But neuroscientists go further.

102
0:05:53.395,000 --> 0:05:58,000
They say that we reconstruct reality.

103
0:05:58.496,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So, when I have an experience that I describe as a red tomato,

104
0:06:02.722,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that experience is actually an accurate reconstruction

105
0:06:06.855,000 --> 0:06:08,000
of the properties of a real red tomato

106
0:06:08.97,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that would exist even if I weren't looking.

107
0:06:13.595,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now, why would neuroscientists say that we don't just construct,

108
0:06:16.816,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we reconstruct?

109
0:06:18.696,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Well, the standard argument given

110
0:06:21.227,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is usually an evolutionary one.

111
0:06:24.941,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Those of our ancestors who saw more accurately

112
0:06:27.38,000 --> 0:06:31,000
had a competitive advantage compared to those who saw less accurately,

113
0:06:32.233,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and therefore they were more likely to pass on their genes.

114
0:06:34.989,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We are the offspring of those who saw more accurately,

115
0:06:38.38,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and so we can be confident that, in the normal case,

116
0:06:41.149,000 --> 0:06:43,000
our perceptions are accurate.

117
0:06:43.68,000 --> 0:06:46,000
You see this in the standard textbooks.

118
0:06:47.375,000 --> 0:06:48,000
One textbook says, for example,

119
0:06:49.369,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"Evolutionarily speaking,

120
0:06:51.34,000 --> 0:06:55,000
vision is useful precisely because it is so accurate."

121
0:06:55.383,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So the idea is that accurate perceptions are fitter perceptions.

122
0:07:00.181,000 --> 0:07:02,000
They give you a survival advantage.

123
0:07:02.325,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Now, is this correct?

124
0:07:04.24,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Is this the right interpretation of evolutionary theory?

125
0:07:06.899,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Well, let's first look at a couple of examples in nature.

126
0:07:10.8,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The Australian jewel beetle

127
0:07:13.238,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is dimpled, glossy and brown.

128
0:07:16.349,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The female is flightless.

129
0:07:18.694,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The male flies, looking, of course, for a hot female.

130
0:07:22.711,000 --> 0:07:25,000
When he finds one, he alights and mates.

131
0:07:26.659,000 --> 0:07:28,000
There's another species in the outback,

132
0:07:29.13,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Homo sapiens.

133
0:07:30.464,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The male of this species has a massive brain

134
0:07:33.531,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that he uses to hunt for cold beer.

135
0:07:37.889,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Laughter)

136
0:07:39.168,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And when he finds one, he drains it,

137
0:07:41.542,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and sometimes throws the bottle into the outback.

138
0:07:44.932,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Now, as it happens, these bottles are dimpled, glossy,

139
0:07:49.18,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and just the right shade of brown to tickle the fancy of these beetles.

140
0:07:54.772,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The males swarm all over the bottles trying to mate.

141
0:07:59.582,000 --> 0:08:01,000
They lose all interest in the real females.

142
0:08:02.369,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Classic case of the male leaving the female for the bottle.

143
0:08:06.572,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

144
0:08:11.402,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The species almost went extinct.

145
0:08:14.443,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Australia had to change its bottles to save its beetles.

146
0:08:18.752,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

147
0:08:21.752,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now, the males had successfully found females for thousands,

148
0:08:25.96,000 --> 0:08:27,000
perhaps millions of years.

149
0:08:28.398,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It looked like they saw reality as it is, but apparently not.

150
0:08:32.832,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Evolution had given them a hack.

151
0:08:35.689,000 --> 0:08:39,000
A female is anything dimpled, glossy and brown,

152
0:08:40.425,000 --> 0:08:42,000
the bigger the better.

153
0:08:42.701,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Laughter)

154
0:08:44.535,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Even when crawling all over the bottle, the male couldn't discover his mistake.

155
0:08:49.945,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now, you might say, beetles, sure, they're very simple creatures,

156
0:08:53.59,000 --> 0:08:54,000
but surely not mammals.

157
0:08:55.448,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Mammals don't rely on tricks.

158
0:08:58.165,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Well, I won't dwell on this, but you get the idea. (Laughter)

159
0:09:04.178,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So this raises an important technical question:

160
0:09:07.336,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Does natural selection really favor seeing reality as it is?

161
0:09:13.877,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Fortunately, we don't have to wave our hands and guess;

162
0:09:17.413,000 --> 0:09:2,000
evolution is a mathematically precise theory.

163
0:09:20.594,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We can use the equations of evolution to check this out.

164
0:09:24.147,000 --> 0:09:28,000
We can have various organisms in artificial worlds compete

165
0:09:28.3,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and see which survive and which thrive,

166
0:09:30.253,000 --> 0:09:33,000
which sensory systems are more fit.

167
0:09:33.806,000 --> 0:09:37,000
A key notion in those equations is fitness.

168
0:09:37.891,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Consider this steak:

169
0:09:41.956,000 --> 0:09:43,000
What does this steak do for the fitness of an animal?

170
0:09:45.438,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Well, for a hungry lion looking to eat, it enhances fitness.

171
0:09:52.179,000 --> 0:09:56,000
For a well-fed lion looking to mate, it doesn't enhance fitness.

172
0:09:58.053,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And for a rabbit in any state, it doesn't enhance fitness,

173
0:10:01.924,000 --> 0:10:05,000
so fitness does depend on reality as it is, yes,

174
0:10:06.048,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but also on the organism, its state and its action.

175
0:10:10.236,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Fitness is not the same thing as reality as it is,

176
0:10:13.789,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and it's fitness, and not reality as it is,

177
0:10:17.272,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that figures centrally in the equations of evolution.

178
0:10:21.451,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So, in my lab,

179
0:10:24.642,000 --> 0:10:27,000
we have run hundreds of thousands of evolutionary game simulations

180
0:10:28.417,000 --> 0:10:31,000
with lots of different randomly chosen worlds

181
0:10:31.482,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and organisms that compete for resources in those worlds.

182
0:10:35.661,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Some of the organisms see all of the reality,

183
0:10:39.98,000 --> 0:10:4,000
others see just part of the reality,

184
0:10:41.869,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and some see none of the reality,

185
0:10:43.974,000 --> 0:10:44,000
only fitness.

186
0:10:46.24,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Who wins?

187
0:10:48.29,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Well, I hate to break it to you, but perception of reality goes extinct.

188
0:10:54.255,000 --> 0:10:55,000
In almost every simulation,

189
0:10:56.164,000 --> 0:10:58,000
organisms that see none of reality

190
0:10:58.346,000 --> 0:11:,000
but are just tuned to fitness

191
0:11:00.436,000 --> 0:11:05,000
drive to extinction all the organisms that perceive reality as it is.

192
0:11:05.66,000 --> 0:11:09,000
So the bottom line is, evolution does not favor veridical,

193
0:11:10.25,000 --> 0:11:11,000
or accurate perceptions.

194
0:11:11.906,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Those perceptions of reality go extinct.

195
0:11:15.668,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Now, this is a bit stunning.

196
0:11:17.688,000 --> 0:11:2,000
How can it be that not seeing the world accurately

197
0:11:21.37,000 --> 0:11:22,000
gives us a survival advantage?

198
0:11:23.19,000 --> 0:11:25,000
That is a bit counterintuitive.

199
0:11:25.303,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But remember the jewel beetle.

200
0:11:27.138,000 --> 0:11:3,000
The jewel beetle survived for thousands, perhaps millions of years,

201
0:11:30.899,000 --> 0:11:32,000
using simple tricks and hacks.

202
0:11:33.593,000 --> 0:11:36,000
What the equations of evolution are telling us

203
0:11:36.77,000 --> 0:11:41,000
is that all organisms, including us, are in the same boat as the jewel beetle.

204
0:11:42.413,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We do not see reality as it is.

205
0:11:44.343,000 --> 0:11:48,000
We're shaped with tricks and hacks that keep us alive.

206
0:11:48.615,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Still,

207
0:11:50.635,000 --> 0:11:52,000
we need some help with our intuitions.

208
0:11:52.702,000 --> 0:11:56,000
How can not perceiving reality as it is be useful?

209
0:11:57.485,000 --> 0:12:,000
Well, fortunately, we have a very helpful metaphor:

210
0:12:01.154,000 --> 0:12:03,000
the desktop interface on your computer.

211
0:12:03.986,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Consider that blue icon for a TED Talk that you're writing.

212
0:12:08.119,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Now, the icon is blue and rectangular

213
0:12:12.123,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and in the lower right corner of the desktop.

214
0:12:15.324,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Does that mean that the text file itself in the computer is blue,

215
0:12:20.2,000 --> 0:12:23,000
rectangular, and in the lower right-hand corner of the computer?

216
0:12:23.955,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Of course not.

217
0:12:25.278,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Anyone who thought that misinterprets the purpose of the interface.

218
0:12:29.987,000 --> 0:12:31,000
It's not there to show you the reality of the computer.

219
0:12:32.755,000 --> 0:12:34,000
In fact, it's there to hide that reality.

220
0:12:35.68,000 --> 0:12:36,000
You don't want to know about the diodes

221
0:12:37.555,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and resistors and all the megabytes of software.

222
0:12:39.805,000 --> 0:12:42,000
If you had to deal with that, you could never write your text file

223
0:12:42.936,000 --> 0:12:43,000
or edit your photo.

224
0:12:44.411,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So the idea is that evolution has given us an interface

225
0:12:49.128,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that hides reality and guides adaptive behavior.

226
0:12:53.443,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Space and time, as you perceive them right now,

227
0:12:56.461,000 --> 0:12:58,000
are your desktop.

228
0:12:58.635,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Physical objects are simply icons in that desktop.

229
0:13:04.192,000 --> 0:13:06,000
There's an obvious objection.

230
0:13:06.413,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Hoffman, if you think that train coming down the track at 200 MPH

231
0:13:10.361,000 --> 0:13:12,000
is just an icon of your desktop,

232
0:13:12.822,000 --> 0:13:14,000
why don't you step in front of it?

233
0:13:14.947,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And after you're gone, and your theory with you,

234
0:13:17.24,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we'll know that there's more to that train than just an icon.

235
0:13:20.554,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Well, I wouldn't step in front of that train

236
0:13:22.597,000 --> 0:13:23,000
for the same reason

237
0:13:24.153,000 --> 0:13:28,000
that I wouldn't carelessly drag that icon to the trash can:

238
0:13:28.448,000 --> 0:13:31,000
not because I take the icon literally --

239
0:13:31.629,000 --> 0:13:34,000
the file is not literally blue or rectangular --

240
0:13:34.934,000 --> 0:13:36,000
but I do take it seriously.

241
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I could lose weeks of work.

242
0:13:39.291,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Similarly, evolution has shaped us

243
0:13:41.845,000 --> 0:13:45,000
with perceptual symbols that are designed to keep us alive.

244
0:13:46.811,000 --> 0:13:48,000
We'd better take them seriously.

245
0:13:49.276,000 --> 0:13:51,000
If you see a snake, don't pick it up.

246
0:13:52.391,000 --> 0:13:54,000
If you see a cliff, don't jump off.

247
0:13:55.15,000 --> 0:13:58,000
They're designed to keep us safe, and we should take them seriously.

248
0:13:58.726,000 --> 0:14:,000
That does not mean that we should take them literally.

249
0:14:01.417,000 --> 0:14:03,000
That's a logical error.

250
0:14:03.671,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Another objection: There's nothing really new here.

251
0:14:06.876,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Physicists have told us for a long time that the metal of that train looks solid

252
0:14:10.8,000 --> 0:14:14,000
but really it's mostly empty space with microscopic particles zipping around.

253
0:14:15.188,000 --> 0:14:16,000
There's nothing new here.

254
0:14:16.676,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Well, not exactly.

255
0:14:18.88,000 --> 0:14:22,000
It's like saying, I know that that blue icon on the desktop

256
0:14:22.92,000 --> 0:14:24,000
is not the reality of the computer,

257
0:14:25.219,000 --> 0:14:28,000
but if I pull out my trusty magnifying glass and look really closely,

258
0:14:28.678,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I see little pixels,

259
0:14:30.489,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and that's the reality of the computer.

260
0:14:32.95,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Well, not really -- you're still on the desktop, and that's the point.

261
0:14:36.758,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Those microscopic particles are still in space and time:

262
0:14:39.754,000 --> 0:14:41,000
they're still in the user interface.

263
0:14:42.145,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So I'm saying something far more radical than those physicists.

264
0:14:46.727,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Finally, you might object,

265
0:14:48.2,000 --> 0:14:5,000
look, we all see the train,

266
0:14:50.759,000 --> 0:14:53,000
therefore none of us constructs the train.

267
0:14:53.801,000 --> 0:14:55,000
But remember this example.

268
0:14:55.891,000 --> 0:14:57,000
In this example, we all see a cube,

269
0:14:59.597,000 --> 0:15:01,000
but the screen is flat,

270
0:15:01.69,000 --> 0:15:03,000
so the cube that you see is the cube that you construct.

271
0:15:05.736,000 --> 0:15:07,000
We all see a cube

272
0:15:07.779,000 --> 0:15:11,000
because we all, each one of us, constructs the cube that we see.

273
0:15:12.638,000 --> 0:15:14,000
The same is true of the train.

274
0:15:14.698,000 --> 0:15:18,000
We all see a train because we each see the train that we construct,

275
0:15:19.18,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and the same is true of all physical objects.

276
0:15:24.343,000 --> 0:15:29,000
We're inclined to think that perception is like a window on reality as it is.

277
0:15:29.396,000 --> 0:15:34,000
The theory of evolution is telling us that this is an incorrect interpretation

278
0:15:34.4,000 --> 0:15:35,000
of our perceptions.

279
0:15:37.095,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Instead, reality is more like a 3D desktop

280
0:15:40.639,000 --> 0:15:43,000
that's designed to hide the complexity of the real world

281
0:15:43.936,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and guide adaptive behavior.

282
0:15:46.282,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Space as you perceive it is your desktop.

283
0:15:49.21,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Physical objects are just the icons in that desktop.

284
0:15:53.456,000 --> 0:15:56,000
We used to think that the Earth is flat because it looks that way.

285
0:15:57.52,000 --> 0:16:,000
Then we thought that the Earth is the unmoving center of reality

286
0:16:00.654,000 --> 0:16:01,000
because it looks that way.

287
0:16:02.378,000 --> 0:16:03,000
We were wrong.

288
0:16:03.52,000 --> 0:16:05,000
We had misinterpreted our perceptions.

289
0:16:06.91,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Now we believe that spacetime and objects

290
0:16:10.319,000 --> 0:16:12,000
are the nature of reality as it is.

291
0:16:13.453,000 --> 0:16:16,000
The theory of evolution is telling us that once again, we're wrong.

292
0:16:17.377,000 --> 0:16:22,000
We're misinterpreting the content of our perceptual experiences.

293
0:16:22.416,000 --> 0:16:24,000
There's something that exists when you don't look,

294
0:16:24.947,000 --> 0:16:27,000
but it's not spacetime and physical objects.

295
0:16:28.35,000 --> 0:16:31,000
It's as hard for us to let go of spacetime and objects

296
0:16:31.378,000 --> 0:16:34,000
as it is for the jewel beetle to let go of its bottle.

297
0:16:34.861,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Why? Because we're blind to our own blindnesses.

298
0:16:40.409,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But we have an advantage over the jewel beetle:

299
0:16:42.756,000 --> 0:16:43,000
our science and technology.

300
0:16:44.544,000 --> 0:16:46,000
By peering through the lens of a telescope

301
0:16:46.935,000 --> 0:16:5,000
we discovered that the Earth is not the unmoving center of reality,

302
0:16:51.571,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and by peering through the lens of the theory of evolution

303
0:16:54.449,000 --> 0:16:56,000
we discovered that spacetime and objects

304
0:16:56.771,000 --> 0:16:58,000
are not the nature of reality.

305
0:16:59.139,000 --> 0:17:03,000
When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a red tomato,

306
0:17:03.424,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I am interacting with reality,

307
0:17:06.361,000 --> 0:17:11,000
but that reality is not a red tomato and is nothing like a red tomato.

308
0:17:11.571,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Similarly, when I have an experience that I describe as a lion or a steak,

309
0:17:16.972,000 --> 0:17:17,000
I'm interacting with reality,

310
0:17:18.82,000 --> 0:17:21,000
but that reality is not a lion or a steak.

311
0:17:21.978,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And here's the kicker:

312
0:17:23.998,000 --> 0:17:27,000
When I have a perceptual experience that I describe as a brain, or neurons,

313
0:17:28.688,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I am interacting with reality,

314
0:17:30.778,000 --> 0:17:33,000
but that reality is not a brain or neurons

315
0:17:34.307,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and is nothing like a brain or neurons.

316
0:17:37.805,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And that reality, whatever it is,

317
0:17:42.584,000 --> 0:17:45,000
is the real source of cause and effect

318
0:17:46.195,000 --> 0:17:5,000
in the world -- not brains, not neurons.

319
0:17:50.227,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Brains and neurons have no causal powers.

320
0:17:52.827,000 --> 0:17:54,000
They cause none of our perceptual experiences,

321
0:17:55.428,000 --> 0:17:56,000
and none of our behavior.

322
0:17:57.216,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Brains and neurons are a species-specific set of symbols, a hack.

323
0:18:02.592,000 --> 0:18:04,000
What does this mean for the mystery of consciousness?

324
0:18:05.923,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Well, it opens up new possibilities.

325
0:18:09.916,000 --> 0:18:1,000
For instance,

326
0:18:11.611,000 --> 0:18:17,000
perhaps reality is some vast machine that causes our conscious experiences.

327
0:18:18.59,000 --> 0:18:21,000
I doubt this, but it's worth exploring.

328
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Perhaps reality is some vast, interacting network of conscious agents,

329
0:18:27.609,000 --> 0:18:32,000
simple and complex, that cause each other's conscious experiences.

330
0:18:33.182,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Actually, this isn't as crazy an idea as it seems,

331
0:18:36.432,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and I'm currently exploring it.

332
0:18:38.592,000 --> 0:18:4,000
But here's the point:

333
0:18:40.658,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Once we let go of our massively intuitive

334
0:18:43.979,000 --> 0:18:46,000
but massively false assumption about the nature of reality,

335
0:18:47.903,000 --> 0:18:51,000
it opens up new ways to think about life's greatest mystery.

336
0:18:53.251,000 --> 0:18:57,000
I bet that reality will end up turning out to be more fascinating

337
0:18:57.86,000 --> 0:19:,000
and unexpected than we've ever imagined.

338
0:19:01.834,000 --> 0:19:05,000
The theory of evolution presents us with the ultimate dare:

339
0:19:06.222,000 --> 0:19:11,000
Dare to recognize that perception is not about seeing truth,

340
0:19:11.364,000 --> 0:19:15,000
it's about having kids.

341
0:19:15.46,000 --> 0:19:19,000
And by the way, even this TED is just in your head.

342
0:19:20.2,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Thank you very much.

343
0:19:22.244,000 --> 0:19:25,000
(Applause)

344
0:19:32.786,000 --> 0:19:35,000
Chris Anderson: If that's really you there, thank you.

345
0:19:36.221,000 --> 0:19:38,000
So there's so much from this.

346
0:19:39.152,000 --> 0:19:42,000
I mean, first of all, some people may just be profoundly depressed

347
0:19:42.421,000 --> 0:19:47,000
at the thought that, if evolution does not favor reality,

348
0:19:47.97,000 --> 0:19:5,000
I mean, doesn't that to some extent undermine all our endeavors here,

349
0:19:51.3,000 --> 0:19:53,000
all our ability to think that we can think the truth,

350
0:19:53.984,000 --> 0:19:56,000
possibly even including your own theory, if you go there?

351
0:19:57.49,000 --> 0:20:01,000
Donald Hoffman: Well, this does not stop us from a successful science.

352
0:20:01.944,000 --> 0:20:03,000
What we have is one theory that turned out to be false,

353
0:20:04.756,000 --> 0:20:08,000
that perception is like reality and reality is like our perceptions.

354
0:20:09.215,000 --> 0:20:1,000
That theory turns out to be false.

355
0:20:10.9,000 --> 0:20:11,000
Okay, throw that theory away.

356
0:20:12.318,000 --> 0:20:15,000
That doesn't stop us from now postulating all sorts of other theories

357
0:20:15.572,000 --> 0:20:16,000
about the nature of reality,

358
0:20:16.93,000 --> 0:20:19,000
so it's actually progress to recognize that one of our theories was false.

359
0:20:20.535,000 --> 0:20:22,000
So science continues as normal. There's no problem here.

360
0:20:23.193,000 --> 0:20:25,000
CA: So you think it's possible -- (Laughter) --

361
0:20:25.794,000 --> 0:20:29,000
This is cool, but what you're saying I think is it's possible that evolution

362
0:20:29.904,000 --> 0:20:31,000
can still get you to reason.

363
0:20:32.551,000 --> 0:20:34,000
DH: Yes. Now that's a very, very good point.

364
0:20:34.864,000 --> 0:20:38,000
The evolutionary game simulations that I showed were specifically about perception,

365
0:20:39.391,000 --> 0:20:41,000
and they do show that our perceptions have been shaped

366
0:20:41.969,000 --> 0:20:42,000
not to show us reality as it is,

367
0:20:43.849,000 --> 0:20:47,000
but that does not mean the same thing about our logic or mathematics.

368
0:20:48.122,000 --> 0:20:51,000
We haven't done these simulations, but my bet is that we'll find

369
0:20:51.744,000 --> 0:20:54,000
that there are some selection pressures for our logic and our mathematics

370
0:20:55.366,000 --> 0:20:57,000
to be at least in the direction of truth.

371
0:20:57.572,000 --> 0:20:59,000
I mean, if you're like me, math and logic is not easy.

372
0:21:00.219,000 --> 0:21:03,000
We don't get it all right, but at least the selection pressures are not

373
0:21:03.57,000 --> 0:21:05,000
uniformly away from true math and logic.

374
0:21:05.908,000 --> 0:21:08,000
So I think that we'll find that we have to look at each cognitive faculty

375
0:21:09.228,000 --> 0:21:11,000
one at a time and see what evolution does to it.

376
0:21:11.852,000 --> 0:21:14,000
What's true about perception may not be true about math and logic.

377
0:21:15.613,000 --> 0:21:18,000
CA: I mean, really what you're proposing is a kind of modern-day Bishop Berkeley

378
0:21:19.607,000 --> 0:21:21,000
interpretation of the world:

379
0:21:21.998,000 --> 0:21:23,000
consciousness causes matter, not the other way around.

380
0:21:24.947,000 --> 0:21:26,000
DH: Well, it's slightly different than Berkeley.

381
0:21:27.339,000 --> 0:21:3,000
Berkeley thought that, he was a deist, and he thought that the ultimate

382
0:21:30.701,000 --> 0:21:32,000
nature of reality is God and so forth,

383
0:21:32.74,000 --> 0:21:35,000
and I don't need to go where Berkeley's going,

384
0:21:35.85,000 --> 0:21:37,000
so it's quite a bit different from Berkeley.

385
0:21:39.725,000 --> 0:21:42,000
I call this conscious realism. It's actually a very different approach.

386
0:21:43.235,000 --> 0:21:46,000
CA: Don, I could literally talk with you for hours, and I hope to do that.

387
0:21:46.825,000 --> 0:21:48,000
Thanks so much for that. DH: Thank you. (Applause)

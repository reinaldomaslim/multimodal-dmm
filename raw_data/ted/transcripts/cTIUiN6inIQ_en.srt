You're probably familiar with FOMO.

[This guy invented the term]

4
0:00:15.802,000 --> 0:00:16,000
That's short for "Fear Of Missing Out."

5
0:00:17.702,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's that feeling you get

6
0:00:18.99,000 --> 0:00:2,000
when it seems everyone else is doing something better

7
0:00:21.561,000 --> 0:00:22,000
than what you're doing now.

8
0:00:22.892,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But there's another FO you need to know about,

9
0:00:25.102,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and it's far more dangerous.

10
0:00:26.532,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It's called FOBO,

11
0:00:27.923,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and it's short for "Fear Of a Better Option."

12

[The Way We Work]

13
0:00:34.842,000 --> 0:00:36,000
We live in a world of overwhelming choice.

14
0:00:37.332,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Even decisions that used to be simple,

15
0:00:39.166,000 --> 0:00:42,000
like choosing a restaurant or making everyday purchases,

16
0:00:42.222,000 --> 0:00:43,000
are now fraught with overanalysis.

17
0:00:44.172,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Technology has only made the issue more pronounced.

18
0:00:46.802,000 --> 0:00:48,000
If you want to buy a pair of white shoelaces online,

19
0:00:49.312,000 --> 0:00:51,000
you have to sort through thousands of items

20
0:00:51.352,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and read through hundreds of reviews.

21
0:00:53.222,000 --> 0:00:55,000
That's an astounding amount of information to process

22
0:00:55.792,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to just buy two pieces of string that cost less than your morning latte.

23
0:00:59.302,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Chances are you've experienced FOBO when you've struggled

24
0:01:02.082,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to choose just one from a group of perfectly acceptable outcomes.

25
0:01:05.282,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's a symptom of a culture which sees value

26
0:01:07.354,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in collecting and preserving as many options as possible.

27
0:01:10.192,000 --> 0:01:12,000
You might wonder why all of this is so bad.

28
0:01:12.292,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It seems counterintuitive.

29
0:01:13.555,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Shouldn't it be a privilege to have so many good options

30
0:01:16.2,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to choose from?

31
0:01:17.375,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The problem is, FOBO induces such severe analysis paralysis

32
0:01:20.702,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that it can negatively impact both your personal and professional life.

33
0:01:24.072,000 --> 0:01:26,000
When you can't make decisions with conviction,

34
0:01:26.292,000 --> 0:01:27,000
you waste precious time and energy.

35
0:01:28.022,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Luckily, there is a way to overcome FOBO.

36
0:01:30.192,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Here's a secret.

37
0:01:31.422,000 --> 0:01:34,000
With any decision you make, you first have to determine the stakes,

38
0:01:34.622,000 --> 0:01:36,000
as this will inform your decision-making strategy.

39
0:01:37.092,000 --> 0:01:38,000
When it comes down to it,

40
0:01:38.387,000 --> 0:01:4,000
you only really face three types of decisions in life:

41
0:01:40.963,000 --> 0:01:42,000
high stakes, low stakes and no stakes.

42
0:01:43.532,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Let's start with no-stakes decisions.

43
0:01:45.372,000 --> 0:01:46,000
These are the minor details of life,

44
0:01:47.132,000 --> 0:01:49,000
where there is almost never an incorrect answer,

45
0:01:49.462,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and in a few hours, you won't even remember

46
0:01:51.52,000 --> 0:01:52,000
making the decision.

47
0:01:52.702,000 --> 0:01:54,000
A good example of this is choosing what to watch on TV.

48
0:01:55.392,000 --> 0:01:57,000
With thousands of shows, it's easy to get overwhelmed,

49
0:01:58.052,000 --> 0:01:59,000
yet no matter what you pick,

50
0:01:59.41,000 --> 0:02:01,000
the consequences are basically nonexistent.

51
0:02:02.122,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So spending more than a few moments on FOBO

52
0:02:04.472,000 --> 0:02:06,000
is a massive waste of energy.

53
0:02:06.512,000 --> 0:02:07,000
You just need to move on.

54
0:02:07.812,000 --> 0:02:08,000
When it comes to no-stakes decisions,

55
0:02:09.598,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the key is to outsource them to the universe.

56
0:02:12.292,000 --> 0:02:14,000
For example, you can whittle down your choices to just two

57
0:02:15.061,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and then flip a coin.

58
0:02:16.392,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Or try my personal favorite -- ask the watch.

59
0:02:19.152,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Assign each one of your choices to one half of your watch,

60
0:02:21.891,000 --> 0:02:24,000
then let the second hand tell you what you're going to do.

61
0:02:25.152,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Looks like I'll be having the fish.

62
0:02:26.843,000 --> 0:02:27,000
That brings us to low-stakes decisions.

63
0:02:28.762,000 --> 0:02:3,000
These have consequences, but none are earth-shattering,

64
0:02:31.742,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and there are plenty of acceptable outcomes.

65
0:02:34.122,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Many routine things at work, like purchasing a printer,

66
0:02:37.122,000 --> 0:02:4,000
booking a hotel or choosing between possible venues for an off-site

67
0:02:40.736,000 --> 0:02:42,000
are classically low-stakes in nature.

68
0:02:42.902,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Some thinking is required,

69
0:02:44.242,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but these aren't make-or-break deliberations,

70
0:02:46.722,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and you'll probably forget about them in a few weeks.

71
0:02:49.282,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Here, you can also outsource decision-making,

72
0:02:51.442,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but you want some critical thinking involved,

73
0:02:53.562,000 --> 0:02:54,000
as there are some stakes.

74
0:02:55.102,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This time, you'll outsource to a person.

75
0:02:57.172,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Set some basic criteria,

76
0:02:58.592,000 --> 0:03:,000
select someone to present a recommendation,

77
0:03:00.616,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and then take their advice.

78
0:03:01.952,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Make sure to avoid the temptation to canvass.

79
0:03:04.322,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Your goal is to clear your plate,

80
0:03:05.918,000 --> 0:03:06,000
not to kick the can down the road.

81
0:03:07.632,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now that you tackled low-stakes and no-stakes decisions,

82
0:03:10.382,000 --> 0:03:12,000
you've created the space and time you'll need

83
0:03:12.512,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to handle high-stakes decisions.

84
0:03:14.072,000 --> 0:03:16,000
These are things like "which house should I buy"

85
0:03:16.382,000 --> 0:03:17,000
or "which job should I accept."

86
0:03:17.922,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Since the stakes are high and there are long-term implications,

87
0:03:20.992,000 --> 0:03:21,000
you absolutely want to get it right.

88
0:03:22.752,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Before we get to work, let's establish a few basic principles

89
0:03:25.752,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to guide you through the process.

90
0:03:27.422,000 --> 0:03:29,000
First, think about what really matters to you,

91
0:03:29.622,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and set your criteria accordingly.

92
0:03:31.392,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Second, gather the relevant facts.

93
0:03:33.252,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Make sure you collect data about all of the options,

94
0:03:35.722,000 --> 0:03:36,000
so you can be confident

95
0:03:36.93,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that you're truly making an informed decision.

96
0:03:39.162,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And third, remember that FOBO, by nature,

97
0:03:41.152,000 --> 0:03:43,000
comes when you struggle to choose just one

98
0:03:43.252,000 --> 0:03:45,000
from a group of perfectly acceptable options.

99
0:03:45.932,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So no matter what you choose,

100
0:03:47.922,000 --> 0:03:49,000
you can rest assured that the downside is limited.

101
0:03:50.382,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now that you've established some ground rules,

102
0:03:52.562,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the process can begin.

103
0:03:53.822,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Start by identifying a front-runner based on your intuition,

104
0:03:56.732,000 --> 0:03:58,000
then compare each of your options head-to-head

105
0:03:58.962,000 --> 0:03:59,000
with the front-runner, one-by-one.

106
0:04:00.622,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Each time, choose the better of the two based on the criteria,

107
0:04:03.692,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and discard the other one.

108
0:04:05.082,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Here's the trick to avoiding FOBO.

109
0:04:07.132,000 --> 0:04:09,000
When you eliminate an option, it's gone forever.

110
0:04:09.792,000 --> 0:04:11,000
If you keep returning to discarded options,

111
0:04:11.832,000 --> 0:04:12,000
you risk getting stuck.

112
0:04:13.032,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now repeat this process until you get down to one final choice.

113
0:04:16.582,000 --> 0:04:17,000
If you follow this system,

114
0:04:18.092,000 --> 0:04:2,000
you will usually end up with a decision on your own.

115
0:04:20.545,000 --> 0:04:22,000
On the rare occasion that you get stuck,

116
0:04:22.662,000 --> 0:04:23,000
you will outsource the final decision

117
0:04:24.448,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to a small group of qualified people who you trust

118
0:04:27.212,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and who are equipped to provide you with guidance

119
0:04:29.612,000 --> 0:04:3,000
on this particular topic.

120
0:04:30.932,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Engage a group of five or less, ideally an odd number of people

121
0:04:33.928,000 --> 0:04:35,000
so that you have a built-in tiebreaker if you need it.

122
0:04:36.506,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Now that you've made your choice, one last challenge remains.

123
0:04:39.502,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You have to commit.

124
0:04:40.682,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I can't promise you that you'll ever truly know if you've made the perfect decision,

125
0:04:44.696,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but I can tell you this:

126
0:04:45.922,000 --> 0:04:47,000
a significant percentage of people in the world

127
0:04:48.137,000 --> 0:04:5,000
will never have to worry about FOBO.

128
0:04:50.372,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Unlike the billions of people who have few options, if any,

129
0:04:53.222,000 --> 0:04:55,000
due to war, poverty or illness,

130
0:04:55.672,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you have plentiful opportunities to live decisively.

131
0:04:58.962,000 --> 0:04:59,000
You may not get everything you want,

132
0:05:00.701,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but the mere fact you get to decide is powerful.

133
0:05:03.352,000 --> 0:05:04,000
In fact, it's a gift.

134
0:05:05.162,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Make the most of it.

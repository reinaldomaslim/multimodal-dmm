1
0:00:12.689,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Are you tired of your boss?

2
0:00:14.893,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:16.273,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Are you tired of going to work

4
0:00:18.138,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and making money for other people?

5
0:00:21.785,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And who are those people anyways?

6
0:00:23.385,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Those people that make money from your work.

7
0:00:26.198,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Well, they're capitalists.

8
0:00:28.12,000 --> 0:00:29,000
They have capital,

9
0:00:29.42,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and they use your labor to make more capital.

10
0:00:32.793,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So if you're tired of going to work

11
0:00:34.891,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and making money for other people,

12
0:00:37.12,000 --> 0:00:38,000
then you're probably like me --

13
0:00:38.812,000 --> 0:00:39,000
just tired of capitalism.

14
0:00:41.621,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Which is ironic, because I'm a capitalist.

15
0:00:44.667,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:46.109,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I own a small business --

17
0:00:47.856,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Rco Tires in Compton.

18
0:00:50.404,000 --> 0:00:51,000
A few years ago, when I read Van Jones,

19
0:00:52.391,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and he wrote, "Let's make green collar jobs in the hood,"

20
0:00:55.333,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I took him really seriously.

21
0:00:57.908,000 --> 0:01:,000
So I cofounded, own and operate a tire recycling company,

22
0:01:01.632,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and I'm really proud of what we've done.

23
0:01:03.618,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So far, we've recycled a hundred million pounds of rubber.

24
0:01:07.402,000 --> 0:01:11,000
That's 21 million gallons of oil diverted from landfills

25
0:01:11.451,000 --> 0:01:12,000
into new products.

26
0:01:13.055,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Cheers)

27
0:01:14.229,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We also employ about 15 guys --

28
0:01:16.468,000 --> 0:01:17,000
mostly people of color,

29
0:01:18.041,000 --> 0:01:19,000
most of whom are felons,

30
0:01:19.435,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and we pay above the minimum wage,

31
0:01:21.334,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and we are now proud members of the United Steelworkers Union.

32
0:01:24.768,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Applause)

33
0:01:30.351,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now, Rco is not a cooperative now.

34
0:01:32.914,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's a privately held company with community-minded ownership,

35
0:01:36.605,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but I would like it to become one.

36
0:01:38.383,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I would like for them to fire the boss --

37
0:01:40.702,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that's me.

38
0:01:42.065,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:43.137,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And I'm going to tell you why,

40
0:01:44.607,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but first, let me tell you how we got started.

41
0:01:47.683,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So a lot of people ask,

42
0:01:48.857,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"How did Rco come to be?"

43
0:01:50.315,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I have to be really honest.

44
0:01:52.239,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I leveraged my white privilege.

45
0:01:54.584,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So, here's how white privilege worked for me and Rco.

46
0:01:59.268,000 --> 0:02:02,000
My white grandmother was born on her family's plantation

47
0:02:03.137,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in Arkansas in 1918.

48
0:02:05.815,000 --> 0:02:07,000
She traveled with her white father west,

49
0:02:08.769,000 --> 0:02:09,000
following the oil boom.

50
0:02:10.362,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And he held various union oil jobs --

51
0:02:13.566,000 --> 0:02:16,000
jobs which would have never been given to my black great-grandfather,

52
0:02:17.051,000 --> 0:02:18,000
had he lived here at the time.

53
0:02:19.562,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Granny became a hairdresser

54
0:02:21.515,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and then got a loan with her husband

55
0:02:25.444,000 --> 0:02:27,000
who built their home in West Los Angeles --

56
0:02:27.538,000 --> 0:02:3,000
a loan which would never have been given to a black family at the time.

57
0:02:32.241,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And after my grandfather passed away,

58
0:02:34.101,000 --> 0:02:35,000
my granny was able to keep that house

59
0:02:35.904,000 --> 0:02:37,000
because she had his pension and his health care

60
0:02:38.605,000 --> 0:02:39,000
from a state job which he held,

61
0:02:40.397,000 --> 0:02:42,000
which again, would have never been given to a black man

62
0:02:43.043,000 --> 0:02:45,000
before the anti-discrimination act of the 1960s.

63
0:02:45.868,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So, you fast-forward 30 years,

64
0:02:47.75,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and I graduate,

65
0:02:49.162,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and I want to start my own business

66
0:02:50.888,000 --> 0:02:51,000
with a pile of debt and a credit card,

67
0:02:52.789,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and no experience in the tire industry.

68
0:02:55.156,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But I had what most people didn't have.

69
0:02:57.417,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I had a clean, safe, free place to live.

70
0:03:02.856,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I moved in with my grandmother,

71
0:03:04.628,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and I was able to rent our first warehouse,

72
0:03:06.977,000 --> 0:03:07,000
buy our first truck,

73
0:03:08.177,000 --> 0:03:09,000
pay our first employees,

74
0:03:09.761,000 --> 0:03:11,000
because I didn't have to worry about paying myself,

75
0:03:12.199,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because I didn't need to feed myself,

76
0:03:14.006,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because I am the direct beneficiary of generations of white privilege.

77
0:03:18.523,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Now, telling the story of white privilege is important

78
0:03:22.611,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because very often people say,

79
0:03:24.064,000 --> 0:03:25,000
"Oh, we want more companies like yours.

80
0:03:25.946,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We want more Rco's,

81
0:03:27.128,000 --> 0:03:28,000
we want more black-owned businesses,

82
0:03:29.001,000 --> 0:03:31,000
female-led, triple bottom line,

83
0:03:31.689,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Ban the Box,

84
0:03:32.885,000 --> 0:03:33,000
green manufacturing companies," right?

85
0:03:35.559,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But the question we have to ask is, where is the wealth?

86
0:03:38.226,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Where is the money?

87
0:03:39.401,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Where's the capital in our communities

88
0:03:41.291,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to build the types of businesses that we want?

89
0:03:43.474,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And in telling a story of the white side of my family,

90
0:03:46.046,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I needed a dozen ways

91
0:03:47.221,000 --> 0:03:49,000
where blacks were excluded from the economy,

92
0:03:49.306,000 --> 0:03:52,000
whereas the white side of my family was able to gain access and traction,

93
0:03:52.878,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and build wealth ...

94
0:03:55.044,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Primarily because racism and capitalism are best homies, but --

95
0:03:59.678,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:01.504,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but what that means is that when we ask ourselves,

97
0:04:03.981,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"Why are our communities broke?" --

98
0:04:06.466,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Like, we're not just broke because we're broke;

99
0:04:08.696,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we're broke for a reason.

100
0:04:10.055,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Historical context really does matter.

101
0:04:13.53,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But our history tells another story as well.

102
0:04:15.705,000 --> 0:04:17,000
There's this incredible book called "Collective Courage,"

103
0:04:18.417,000 --> 0:04:21,000
which is the story of how thousands of African Americans

104
0:04:21.657,000 --> 0:04:23,000
have been able to build businesses and schools,

105
0:04:24.201,000 --> 0:04:26,000
hospitals, farming cooperatives,

106
0:04:26.468,000 --> 0:04:27,000
banks, financial institutions --

107
0:04:28.209,000 --> 0:04:3,000
entire communities and sovereign economies,

108
0:04:30.845,000 --> 0:04:31,000
without a lot of capital.

109
0:04:32.857,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And they did it by working together

110
0:04:34.798,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and leveraging their community assets

111
0:04:37.229,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and trusting each other

112
0:04:38.705,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and putting solidarity first --

113
0:04:40.429,000 --> 0:04:42,000
not just profits by any means necessary.

114
0:04:44.201,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And they didn't have to wait around for celebrities and athletes

115
0:04:47.537,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to bring their money back to the hood.

116
0:04:49.847,000 --> 0:04:51,000
However, if you are a celebrity or an athlete,

117
0:04:52.026,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and you're listening to this,

118
0:04:53.443,000 --> 0:04:54,000
please feel free to bring your money.

119
0:04:55.253,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

120
0:04:57.851,000 --> 0:04:59,000
But they did it through cooperative economics,

121
0:05:00.111,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because they knew

122
0:05:01.286,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that capitalism was never going to finance black liberation.

123
0:05:04.763,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So, there are so many great examples in this book,

124
0:05:08.814,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and I suggest that everybody just read it

125
0:05:10.937,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because it answers the question I asked earlier,

126
0:05:13.204,000 --> 0:05:15,000
which was where are we going to get the wealth

127
0:05:15.532,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to build the types of business that we want.

128
0:05:17.632,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And the answer is going to have to be cooperative economics.

129
0:05:20.504,000 --> 0:05:22,000
There's a lot of different versions of cooperativism.

130
0:05:23.488,000 --> 0:05:25,000
What I'm talking about today is worker ownership.

131
0:05:26.504,000 --> 0:05:28,000
You may not have heard of worker ownership,

132
0:05:28.537,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but it's been an incredible tool

133
0:05:30.171,000 --> 0:05:32,000
for black economic liberation for a century,

134
0:05:32.276,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and it's also working all over the world right now.

135
0:05:35.348,000 --> 0:05:36,000
You may have heard of Black Wall Street

136
0:05:37.29,000 --> 0:05:38,000
or maybe the Zapatistas,

137
0:05:38.505,000 --> 0:05:41,000
but I'll give you an example that's a little bit closer to home.

138
0:05:41.575,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Right now, today, in South Bronx,

139
0:05:44.116,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is the country's largest worker-owned company.

140
0:05:47.337,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's called Cooperative Home Care Associates,

141
0:05:50.03,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and it was founded by black and Latinx home care workers

142
0:05:53.014,000 --> 0:05:56,000
who are now able to pay themselves living wages,

143
0:05:56.111,000 --> 0:05:57,000
they have full-time hours,

144
0:05:57.39,000 --> 0:05:58,000
they have benefits and a pension,

145
0:05:59.042,000 --> 0:06:01,000
through their membership as a unit of SEIU.

146
0:06:02.598,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And these women owners now receive a dividend back on their ownership

147
0:06:06.47,000 --> 0:06:08,000
every year that the company has been profitable,

148
0:06:08.787,000 --> 0:06:09,000
which has been most years.

149
0:06:10.809,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So they're able to really enjoy the fruits of their labor

150
0:06:14.754,000 --> 0:06:15,000
because they fired the boss.

151
0:06:17.119,000 --> 0:06:18,000
They don't have any big investors.

152
0:06:18.812,000 --> 0:06:19,000
They don't have fat-cat CEOs

153
0:06:20.444,000 --> 0:06:23,000
or absentee owners taking the profit out of the company.

154
0:06:23.957,000 --> 0:06:26,000
They each pay in about 1,000 dollars over time

155
0:06:27.874,000 --> 0:06:28,000
in order to gain ownership,

156
0:06:29.814,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and now they own their job.

157
0:06:32.418,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Now, there's hundreds of more examples of companies like this

158
0:06:35.427,000 --> 0:06:36,000
springing up all across the country.

159
0:06:37.285,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And I'm so inspired by what they're doing,

160
0:06:40.558,000 --> 0:06:42,000
because it really represents an alternative

161
0:06:43.067,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to the type of economy we have now,

162
0:06:45.122,000 --> 0:06:46,000
which exploits all of us.

163
0:06:47.139,000 --> 0:06:48,000
It also represents an alternative

164
0:06:48.814,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to waiting around for big investors to bring chain stores,

165
0:06:52.798,000 --> 0:06:53,000
or big-box stores to our communities,

166
0:06:54.594,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because honestly, those types of developments,

167
0:06:56.894,000 --> 0:06:58,000
they steal resources from our communities.

168
0:06:59.242,000 --> 0:07:01,000
They put our mom-and-pop shops out of business,

169
0:07:02.103,000 --> 0:07:05,000
they make our entrepreneurs into wage workers,

170
0:07:05.223,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and they take money out of our pocket

171
0:07:07.053,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and send it to their shareholders.

172
0:07:09.851,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So, I was so inspired by all these stories of resistance and resilience

173
0:07:13.275,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that I got together with a few people here in Los Angeles,

174
0:07:16.067,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and we created LUCI.

175
0:07:17.815,000 --> 0:07:21,000
LUCI stands for the Los Angeles Union Cooperative Initiative,

176
0:07:22.014,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and our objective is to create more worker-owned businesses

177
0:07:25.134,000 --> 0:07:26,000
here in Los Angeles.

178
0:07:26.824,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So far, in the last year, we've created two:

179
0:07:29.206,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Pacific Electric, an electrical company,

180
0:07:31.223,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and Vermont Gage Carwash,

181
0:07:32.802,000 --> 0:07:33,000
which is right here in South-Central,

182
0:07:34.589,000 --> 0:07:36,000
some of you guys might be familiar with it.

183
0:07:36.645,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This long-time carwash is now owned and operated by its 20 workers,

184
0:07:41.34,000 --> 0:07:43,000
all of whom are union members as well.

185
0:07:43.388,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Applause)

186
0:07:48.648,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So you might be wondering why the focus on union-worker ownership,

187
0:07:52.57,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but there's a lot of good reasons

188
0:07:54.221,000 --> 0:07:57,000
why the labor movement is a natural ally to the worker-ownership movement.

189
0:07:57.995,000 --> 0:07:59,000
To build these companies that we want in our community,

190
0:08:00.615,000 --> 0:08:01,000
we need a few things.

191
0:08:01.79,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We're going to need money, people and training.

192
0:08:04.82,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Unions have all of those things.

193
0:08:07.7,000 --> 0:08:09,000
America's working class has been paying union dues for decades,

194
0:08:10.691,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and with it, our unions have been building

195
0:08:12.763,000 --> 0:08:14,000
dignified, decent, and democratic workplaces for us.

196
0:08:15.621,000 --> 0:08:17,000
However, union jobs are on the steep decline,

197
0:08:18.07,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and it's time for us to start calling on our unions

198
0:08:20.5,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to really bring all of their financial and political capital

199
0:08:24.189,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to bear in the creation of new, union, living-wage jobs

200
0:08:27.896,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in our communities.

201
0:08:29.693,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Also, union halls are full of union members

202
0:08:32.948,000 --> 0:08:35,000
who understand the importance of solidarity

203
0:08:36.115,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and the power of collective action.

204
0:08:39.148,000 --> 0:08:43,000
These are the types of folks that want more union businesses to exist,

205
0:08:43.601,000 --> 0:08:45,000
so let's build them with them.

206
0:08:47.067,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Learning from our unions,

207
0:08:48.354,000 --> 0:08:49,000
learning from our past,

208
0:08:49.529,000 --> 0:08:5,000
learning from our peers,

209
0:08:50.726,000 --> 0:08:52,000
are all going to be very important to our success,

210
0:08:53.394,000 --> 0:08:55,000
which is why I'd like to leave you with one last example

211
0:08:56.322,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and a vision for the future ...

212
0:08:58.973,000 --> 0:09:,000
and that vision is Mondragon, Spain.

213
0:09:02.305,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Mondragon, Spain is a community built entirely around worker cooperatives.

214
0:09:07.521,000 --> 0:09:09,000
There's 260-plus businesses here,

215
0:09:10.506,000 --> 0:09:14,000
manufacturing everything from bicycles to washing machines to transformers.

216
0:09:15.866,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And this group of businesses now employs 80,000 people

217
0:09:19.406,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and earns more than 12 billion euros in revenue every year.

218
0:09:23.241,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And all of the companies there are owned by the people that work in them.

219
0:09:27.716,000 --> 0:09:31,000
They've also built universities and hospitals and financial institutions.

220
0:09:32.456,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I mean, imagine if we could build something like this in South-Central.

221
0:09:37.659,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The late mayor of Jackson had a similar idea.

222
0:09:41.385,000 --> 0:09:46,000
He wanted to turn his entire city into a Mondragon-like cooperative economy,

223
0:09:46.837,000 --> 0:09:48,000
calling his ambitious plan "Jackson Rising."

224
0:09:50.76,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And when I look at Mondragon,

225
0:09:52.21,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I see really what working-class people can do for ourselves

226
0:09:55.044,000 --> 0:09:56,000
when we work together

227
0:09:56.219,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and make decisions for ourselves and each other

228
0:09:58.799,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and our communities.

229
0:10:03.336,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And what's really incredible about Mondragon

230
0:10:06.339,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is that while we are dreaming about them,

231
0:10:08.83,000 --> 0:10:09,000
they are dreaming about us.

232
0:10:11.285,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This community in Spain has decided to launch an international initiative

233
0:10:16.169,000 --> 0:10:19,000
to create more communities like it all over the world,

234
0:10:19.195,000 --> 0:10:2,000
by linking up with unions,

235
0:10:20.826,000 --> 0:10:21,000
by supporting organizations like LUCI,

236
0:10:22.763,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and by educating folks about the worker-ownership model.

237
0:10:27.177,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Now, here's what you can do to be a part of it.

238
0:10:29.716,000 --> 0:10:31,000
If you're a union member, go to your union meetings,

239
0:10:32.32,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and make sure that your union has a worker-ownership initiative,

240
0:10:35.534,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and become a part of it.

241
0:10:37.177,000 --> 0:10:38,000
If you're an entrepreneur,

242
0:10:38.475,000 --> 0:10:39,000
if you have a small business,

243
0:10:39.919,000 --> 0:10:4,000
or you're interested in starting one,

244
0:10:41.762,000 --> 0:10:43,000
then link up with LUCI or another organization like us

245
0:10:44.453,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to help you get started on the cooperative model.

246
0:10:47.078,000 --> 0:10:48,000
If you're a politician,

247
0:10:48.254,000 --> 0:10:49,000
or you work for one,

248
0:10:49.67,000 --> 0:10:5,000
or you just like talking to them,

249
0:10:51.361,000 --> 0:10:55,000
please get the city, state, federal and county legislation passed

250
0:10:55.622,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that we need in order to fund and support worker-owned businesses.

251
0:10:59.807,000 --> 0:11:,000
And for everybody else,

252
0:11:01.064,000 --> 0:11:03,000
learn about our history, learn about our models,

253
0:11:03.327,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and seek us out so can support us,

254
0:11:04.977,000 --> 0:11:07,000
you can buy from us, invest in us, lend to us and join us,

255
0:11:08.208,000 --> 0:11:1,000
because it's really going to take all of us

256
0:11:10.298,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in order to build the more just and sustainable and resilient economy

257
0:11:13.942,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that we want for ourselves and our children.

258
0:11:17.679,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And with that,

259
0:11:18.932,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I would like to leave you with a quote from Arundhati Roy,

260
0:11:22.147,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and she writes ...

261
0:11:24.367,000 --> 0:11:28,000
"Our strategy should not be only to confront Empire,

262
0:11:28.542,000 --> 0:11:29,000
but to lay siege to it.

263
0:11:31.016,000 --> 0:11:32,000
To deprive it of oxygen.

264
0:11:33.549,000 --> 0:11:34,000
To mock it.

265
0:11:34.939,000 --> 0:11:35,000
To shame it.

266
0:11:36.701,000 --> 0:11:37,000
With our art,

267
0:11:37.94,000 --> 0:11:38,000
our literature,

268
0:11:39.138,000 --> 0:11:4,000
our music,

269
0:11:40.426,000 --> 0:11:41,000
our brilliance,

270
0:11:42.131,000 --> 0:11:43,000
our joy,

271
0:11:43.973,000 --> 0:11:44,000
our sheer relentlessness --

272
0:11:46.394,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and our ability to tell our own stories.

273
0:11:49.026,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Not the stories that we're being brainwashed to believe.

274
0:11:53.549,000 --> 0:11:55,000
The corporate revolution will collapse

275
0:11:55.642,000 --> 0:11:57,000
if we refuse to buy what they're selling --

276
0:11:59.056,000 --> 0:12:,000
their ideas,

277
0:12:00.539,000 --> 0:12:01,000
their version of history,

278
0:12:02.171,000 --> 0:12:03,000
their wars,

279
0:12:03.346,000 --> 0:12:04,000
their weapons,

280
0:12:05.144,000 --> 0:12:06,000
their sense of inevitability.

281
0:12:07.776,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Because know this:

282
0:12:09.624,000 --> 0:12:1,000
They be few and we be many.

283
0:12:12.053,000 --> 0:12:13,000
They need us more than we need them.

284
0:12:14.956,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Another world is not only possible,

285
0:12:17.542,000 --> 0:12:18,000
she's on her way.

286
0:12:19.477,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And on a quiet day,

287
0:12:21.272,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I can hear her breathing."

288
0:12:23.148,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Thank you.

289
0:12:24.323,000 --> 0:12:25,000
(Applause)

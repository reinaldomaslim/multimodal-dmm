1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I love theater.

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I love the idea that you can transform, become somebody else

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and look at life with a completely new perspective.

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen.

5
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The idea that in that room at that moment,

6
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
everyone, regardless of their age, their gender, their race, their color, their religion,

7
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
comes together.

8
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
At that moment, we transcend space and time together.

9
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination.

10
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers.

11
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique.

12
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show,

13
0:01:09.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and began developing "Upwake."

14
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
"Upwake" tells the story of Zero,

15
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
a modern-day business man, going to work with his life in a suitcase,

16
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two.

17
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I wanted "Upwake" to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would.

18
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And I wanted to let my imagination run wild.

19
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So I began drawing the story that was moving in my head.

20
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
If Antoine de Saint-Exupery, the author of "The Little Prince," were here,

21
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
he would have drawn three holes inside that box

22
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and told you your sheep was inside.

23
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Because, if you look closely enough, things will begin to appear.

24
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
This is not a box; these are the renderings of my imagination

25
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
from head to paper to screen to life.

26
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
In "Upwake" buildings wear suits, Zero tap dances on a giant keyboard,

27
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
clones himself with a scanner, tames and whips the computer mice,

28
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space.

29
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist.

30
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Go from one world to another in a second.

31
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I wanted to have humor, beauty, simplicity and complexity

32
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and use metaphors to suggest ideas.

33
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
At the beginning of the show, for example, Zero deejays dream and reality.

34
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions

35
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
in high definition, live, on stage.

36
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So today, I would like to talk to you about the relationship

37
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
between theater and technology.

38
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Let's start with technology.

39
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Fuse blowing)

40
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
All right. Let's start with theater.

41
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

42
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Buzzing)

43
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Click, click, bang)

44
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Laughter)

45
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Applause)

46
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Thank you.

47
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
"Upwake" lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds.

48
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I project 3D animation on all the four surfaces of the stage

49
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
which I interact with.

50
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
The use of animation and projection was a process of discovery.

51
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I didn't use it as a special effect, but as a partner on stage.

52
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
There are no special effects in "Upwake," no artifice.

53
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal.

54
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Three hundred and forty-four frames, four and a half years and commissions later,

55
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
what started as a one person show became a collaborative work

56
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
of nineteen most talented artists.

57
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And here are some excerpts.

58
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Applause)

59
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Thank you.

60
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So this is, relatively, a new show that we're now beginning to tour.

61
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And in Austin, Texas,

62
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon.

63
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
When I arrived at one of the schools, I certainly did not expect this:

64
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Six hundred kids, packed in a gymnasium, waiting.

65
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I was a little nervous performing without animation, costume -- really -- and make-up.

66
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But the teachers came to me afterward and told me

67
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
they hadn't seen the kids that attentive.

68
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And I think the reason why is that I was able to use their language and their reality

69
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
in order to transport them into another.

70
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Something happened along the way.

71
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Zero became a person and not just a character in a play.

72
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Zero does not speak, is neither man nor woman.

73
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Zero is Zero, a little hero of the 21st Century,

74
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and Zero can touch so many more people than I possibly could.

75
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box

76
0:10:25.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
as it is about taking theater out of its box.

77
0:10:30.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
As a street performer, I have learned that everybody wants to connect.

78
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And that usually, if you're a bit extraordinary, if you're not exactly of human appearance,

79
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:42,000
then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud.

80
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It's as though you made something resonate within them.

81
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It's as though the mystery of the person they're interacting with and connecting

82
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
allows them to be themselves just a bit more.

83
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Because through your mask, they let theirs go.

84
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Being human is an art form.

85
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
I know theater can improve the quality of people's lives,

86
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and I know theater can heal.

87
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years.

88
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors

89
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy.

90
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I know theater unites us.

91
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow,

92
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
tell various stories through different mediums.

93
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Comic books. Quantum physics video games.

94
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And Zero wants to go to the moon.

95
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
In 2007, Zero launched a green campaign,

96
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity

97
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
every Sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m.

98
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The idea is simple, basic. It's not original,

99
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but it's important, and it's important to participate.

100
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
There is a revolution.

101
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
It's a human and technological revolution.

102
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It's motion and emotion.

103
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It's information.

104
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's visual. It's musical. It's sensorial.

105
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It's conceptual. It's universal. It's beyond words and numbers.

106
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
It's happening.

107
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
The natural progression of science and art

108
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
finding each other to better touch and define the human experience.

109
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
There is a revolution in the way that we think,

110
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
in the way that we share, and the way that we express our stories,

111
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
our evolution.

112
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
This is a time of communication, connection and creative collaboration.

113
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Charlie Chaplin innovated motion pictures

114
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and told stories through music, silence, humor and poetry.

115
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
He was social, and his character, The Tramp, spoke to millions.

116
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
He gave entertainment, pleasure and relief to so many human beings

117
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
when they needed it the most.

118
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
We are not here to question the possible; we are here to challenge the impossible.

119
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:46,000
In the science of today, we become artists.

120
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
In the art of today, we become scientists.

121
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We design our world. We invent possibilities.

122
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
We teach, touch and move.

123
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
It is now that we can use the diversity of our talents

124
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
to create intelligent, meaningful and extraordinary work. It's now.

125
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Ringing)

126
0:14:12.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Thank you.

127
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Applause)

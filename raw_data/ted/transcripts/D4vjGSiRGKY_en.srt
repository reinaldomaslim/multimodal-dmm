1
0:00:13.359,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hello.

2
0:00:14.88,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'd like to introduce you to a word you may never have heard before,

3
0:00:18.64,000 --> 0:00:19,000
but you ought to know:

4
0:00:20.28,000 --> 0:00:21,000
drawdown.

5
0:00:22.76,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Drawdown is a new way of thinking about and acting on global warming.

6
0:00:27.84,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It's a goal for a future that we want,

7
0:00:31.2,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a future where reversing global warming is possible.

8
0:00:36.44,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Drawdown is that point in time

9
0:00:38.68,000 --> 0:00:42,000
when atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases begin to decline

10
0:00:43.12,000 --> 0:00:44,000
on a year-to-year basis.

11
0:00:45.4,000 --> 0:00:47,000
More simply, it's that point

12
0:00:47.44,000 --> 0:00:52,000
when we take out more greenhouse gases than we put into Earth's atmosphere.

13
0:00:54.04,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, I know we're all concerned about climate change,

14
0:00:58.8,000 --> 0:01:,000
but climate change is not the problem.

15
0:01:01.76,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Climate change is the expression of the problem.

16
0:01:05.48,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It's the feedback of the system of the planet telling us what's going on.

17
0:01:12.36,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The problem is global warming,

18
0:01:15.08,000 --> 0:01:19,000
provoked by the increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases

19
0:01:19.4,000 --> 0:01:2,000
caused by human activity.

20
0:01:21.88,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So how do we solve the problem?

21
0:01:23.48,000 --> 0:01:27,000
How do we begin the process of reversing global warming?

22
0:01:29.12,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The only way we know how is to draw down,

23
0:01:32.92,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to avoid putting greenhouse gases up

24
0:01:35.48,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and to pull down what's already there.

25
0:01:39.08,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I know.

26
0:01:40.36,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Given the current situation, it sounds impossible,

27
0:01:44.96,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but humanity already knows what to do.

28
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We have real, workable technologies and practices

29
0:01:52.76,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that can achieve drawdown.

30
0:01:55.48,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And it's already happening.

31
0:01:57.76,000 --> 0:02:01,000
What we need is to accelerate implementation

32
0:02:01.88,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and to change the discourse

33
0:02:03.92,000 --> 0:02:07,000
from one of fear and confusion, which only leads to apathy,

34
0:02:09.72,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to one of understanding and possibility,

35
0:02:13.36,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and, therefore, opportunity.

36
0:02:16.56,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I work for an organization called Project Drawdown.

37
0:02:19.88,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And for the last four years,

38
0:02:21.32,000 --> 0:02:24,000
together with a team of researchers and writers from all over the world,

39
0:02:25.2,000 --> 0:02:28,000
we have mapped, measured and detailed

40
0:02:28.6,000 --> 0:02:31,000
100 solutions to reversing global warming.

41
0:02:32.92,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Eighty already exist today,

42
0:02:35.48,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and when taken together, those 80 can achieve drawdown.

43
0:02:40.24,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And 20 are coming attractions, solutions on the pipeline,

44
0:02:43.8,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and when they come online,

45
0:02:45.76,000 --> 0:02:46,000
will speed up our progress.

46
0:02:48.88,000 --> 0:02:49,000
These are solutions

47
0:02:50.68,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that are viable, scalable and financially feasible.

48
0:02:55.64,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And they do one or more of three things:

49
0:02:58.76,000 --> 0:03:04,000
replace existing fossil fuel-based energy generation with clean, renewable sources;

50
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
reduce consumption through technological efficiency

51
0:03:08.64,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and behavior change;

52
0:03:10.76,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and to biosequester carbon in our plants' biomass and soil

53
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
through a process we all learn in grade school,

54
0:03:17.56,000 --> 0:03:18,000
the magic of photosynthesis.

55
0:03:19.92,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's through a combination of these three mechanisms

56
0:03:23.04,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that drawdown becomes possible.

57
0:03:26.68,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So how do we get there?

58
0:03:28.48,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Well, here's the short answer.

59
0:03:31.48,000 --> 0:03:35,000
This is a list of the top 20 solutions to reversing global warming.

60
0:03:35.96,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, I'll go into some detail,

61
0:03:37.44,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but take a few seconds to look over the list.

62
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's eclectic, I know,

63
0:03:47.12,000 --> 0:03:5,000
from onshore wind turbines to educating girls,

64
0:03:50.44,000 --> 0:03:53,000
from plant-rich diets to rooftop solar technology.

65
0:03:54.68,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So let's break it down a little bit.

66
0:03:56.44,000 --> 0:03:59,000
To the right of the slide, you'll see figures in gigatons,

67
0:03:59.6,000 --> 0:04:01,000
or billions of tons.

68
0:04:02.08,000 --> 0:04:05,000
That represents the total equivalent carbon dioxide

69
0:04:05.4,000 --> 0:04:06,000
reduced from the atmosphere

70
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
when the solution is implemented globally over a 30-year period.

71
0:04:11.84,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Now, when we think about climate solutions,

72
0:04:15.24,000 --> 0:04:17,000
we often think about electricity generation.

73
0:04:18.2,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We think of renewable energy as the most important set of solutions,

74
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and they are incredibly important.

75
0:04:24.84,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But the first thing to notice about this list

76
0:04:27.36,000 --> 0:04:3,000
is that only five of the top 20 solutions relate to electricity.

77
0:04:32.399,000 --> 0:04:34,000
What surprised us, honestly,

78
0:04:35.08,000 --> 0:04:38,000
was that eight of the top 20 relate to the food system.

79
0:04:40.4,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The climate impact of food may come as a surprise to many people,

80
0:04:44.52,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but what these results show is that the decisions we make every day

81
0:04:48.6,000 --> 0:04:51,000
about the food we produce, purchase and consume

82
0:04:52.04,000 --> 0:04:54,000
are perhaps the most important contributions

83
0:04:54.88,000 --> 0:04:57,000
every individual can make to reversing global warming.

84
0:04:59.2,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And how we manage land is also very important.

85
0:05:03.08,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Protecting forests and wetlands

86
0:05:06.12,000 --> 0:05:1,000
safeguards, expands and creates new carbon sinks

87
0:05:10.44,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that directly draw down carbon.

88
0:05:13.48,000 --> 0:05:14,000
This is how drawdown can happen.

89
0:05:16.48,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And when we take food and land management together,

90
0:05:20.28,000 --> 0:05:26,000
12 of the top 20 solutions relate to how and why we use land.

91
0:05:26.76,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This fundamentally shifts traditional thinking on climate solutions.

92
0:05:33.36,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But let's go to the top of the list,

93
0:05:35.12,000 --> 0:05:37,000
because I think what's there may also surprise you.

94
0:05:38.08,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The single most impactful solution,

95
0:05:41.56,000 --> 0:05:44,000
according to this analysis, would be refrigeration management,

96
0:05:44.84,000 --> 0:05:48,000
or properly managing and disposing of hydrofluorocarbons, also known as HFCs,

97
0:05:49.56,000 --> 0:05:53,000
which are used by refrigerators and air conditioners to cool the air.

98
0:05:55.64,000 --> 0:05:57,000
We did a great job with the Montreal Protocol

99
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to limit the production of chlorofluorocarbons, CFCs,

100
0:06:01.28,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because of their effect on the ozone layer.

101
0:06:03.32,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But they were replaced by HFCs,

102
0:06:05.92,000 --> 0:06:09,000
which are hundreds to thousands of times more potent a greenhouse gas

103
0:06:10.12,000 --> 0:06:11,000
than carbon dioxide.

104
0:06:12.12,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And that 90 gigatons reduced is a conservative figure.

105
0:06:17.48,000 --> 0:06:21,000
If we were to account for the impact of the Kigali agreement of 2016,

106
0:06:21.92,000 --> 0:06:23,000
which calls for the phaseout of hydrofluorocarbons

107
0:06:24.88,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and replace them with natural refrigerants, which exist today,

108
0:06:29.88,000 --> 0:06:33,000
this number could increase to 120, to nearly 200 gigatons

109
0:06:34.8,000 --> 0:06:36,000
of avoided greenhouse gases.

110
0:06:37.04,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Maybe you're surprised, as we were.

111
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Now, before going into some details of specific solutions,

112
0:06:43.4,000 --> 0:06:45,000
you may be wondering how we came to these calculations.

113
0:06:47.04,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Well, first of all, we collected a lot of data,

114
0:06:50.08,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and we used statistical analysis to create ranges

115
0:06:53.52,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that allow us to choose reasonable choices

116
0:06:56.52,000 --> 0:06:58,000
for every input used throughout the models.

117
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And we chose a conservative approach, which underlies the entire project.

118
0:07:05.12,000 --> 0:07:07,000
All that data is entered in the model,

119
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
ambitiously but plausibly projected into the future,

120
0:07:10.32,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and compared against what we would have to do anyway.

121
0:07:13.68,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The 84 gigatons reduced from onshore wind turbines, for example,

122
0:07:18.28,000 --> 0:07:21,000
results from the electricity generated from wind farms

123
0:07:21.32,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that would otherwise be produced from coal or gas-fired plants.

124
0:07:26.04,000 --> 0:07:32,000
We calculate all the costs to build and to operate the plants

125
0:07:32.28,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and all the emissions generated.

126
0:07:34.96,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The same process is used to compare recycling versus landfilling,

127
0:07:39.56,000 --> 0:07:41,000
regenerative versus industrial agriculture,

128
0:07:42.2,000 --> 0:07:45,000
protecting versus cutting down our forests.

129
0:07:46.88,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The results are then integrated within and across systems

130
0:07:50.96,000 --> 0:07:51,000
to avoid double-counting

131
0:07:52.56,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and add it up to see if we actually get to drawdown.

132
0:07:57.72,000 --> 0:08:,000
OK, let's go into some specific solutions.

133
0:08:02.04,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Rooftop solar comes in ranked number 10.

134
0:08:06.56,000 --> 0:08:08,000
When we picture rooftop solar in our minds

135
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we often envision a warehouse in Miami covered in solar panels.

136
0:08:16.08,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But these are solutions that are relevant in urban and rural settings,

137
0:08:20.48,000 --> 0:08:22,000
high and low-income countries,

138
0:08:22.52,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and they have cascading benefits.

139
0:08:25.36,000 --> 0:08:29,000
This is a family on a straw island in Lake Titicaca

140
0:08:30.12,000 --> 0:08:32,000
receiving their first solar panel.

141
0:08:32.4,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Before, kerosene was used for cooking and lighting,

142
0:08:35.92,000 --> 0:08:36,000
kerosene on a straw island.

143
0:08:38.2,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So by installing solar, this family is not only helping to reduce emissions,

144
0:08:43.08,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but providing safety and security for their household.

145
0:08:46.76,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And tropical forests tell their own story.

146
0:08:49.679,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Protecting currently degraded land in the tropics

147
0:08:53.76,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and allowing natural regeneration to occur

148
0:08:56.36,000 --> 0:08:59,000
is the number five solution to reversing global warming.

149
0:09:00.76,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We can think of trees as giant sticks of carbon.

150
0:09:04.68,000 --> 0:09:07,000
This is drawdown in action every year,

151
0:09:08.4,000 --> 0:09:11,000
as carbon is removed from the atmosphere through photosynthesis,

152
0:09:12.88,000 --> 0:09:16,000
which converts carbon dioxide to plants' biomass and soil organic carbon.

153
0:09:19.24,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And we need to rethink how we produce our food

154
0:09:22.12,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to make it more regenerative.

155
0:09:24.72,000 --> 0:09:27,000
There are many ways to do this, and we researched over 13 of them,

156
0:09:28.44,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but these aren't new ways of producing food.

157
0:09:30.68,000 --> 0:09:33,000
They have been practiced for centuries, for generations.

158
0:09:35.64,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But they are increasingly displaced by modern agriculture,

159
0:09:39.08,000 --> 0:09:42,000
which promotes tillage, monocropping

160
0:09:42.48,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides which degrade the land

161
0:09:47.8,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and turn it into a net emitter of greenhouse gases.

162
0:09:51.36,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Regenerative agriculture, on the other hand,

163
0:09:54.2,000 --> 0:09:56,000
restores soil health and productivity,

164
0:09:56.92,000 --> 0:09:57,000
increases yield,

165
0:09:58.8,000 --> 0:09:59,000
improves water retention,

166
0:10:00.52,000 --> 0:10:03,000
benefits smallholder farmers and large farming operations alike

167
0:10:04.48,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and brings carbon back to the land.

168
0:10:07.48,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It's a win-win-win-win-win.

169
0:10:11.8,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

170
0:10:15.04,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And it's not just how we produce food,

171
0:10:17.92,000 --> 0:10:18,000
but what we consume

172
0:10:19.44,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that has a massive impact on global warming.

173
0:10:22.6,000 --> 0:10:24,000
A plant-rich diet is not a vegan or a vegetarian diet,

174
0:10:25.2,000 --> 0:10:27,000
though I applaud any who make those choices.

175
0:10:28.24,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It's a healthy diet in terms of how much we consume,

176
0:10:31.56,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and particularly how much meat is consumed.

177
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
In the richer parts of the world,

178
0:10:36.8,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we overconsume.

179
0:10:38.8,000 --> 0:10:4,000
However, low-income countries

180
0:10:41.36,000 --> 0:10:44,000
show an insufficient caloric and protein intake.

181
0:10:44.92,000 --> 0:10:45,000
That needs rebalancing,

182
0:10:46.64,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and it's in the rebalancing

183
0:10:48.76,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that a plant-rich diet becomes the number four solution

184
0:10:51.4,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to reversing global warming.

185
0:10:54.6,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Moreover, approximately a third of all food produced is not eaten,

186
0:10:59.92,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and wasted food emits an astounding eight percent of global greenhouse gases.

187
0:11:06.32,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We need to look where across the supply chain

188
0:11:08.92,000 --> 0:11:09,000
these losses and wastage occurs.

189
0:11:11.24,000 --> 0:11:13,000
In low-income countries, after food leaves the farm,

190
0:11:14.2,000 --> 0:11:16,000
most food is wasted early in the supply chain

191
0:11:16.88,000 --> 0:11:18,000
due to infrastructure and storage challenges.

192
0:11:19.92,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Food is not wasted by consumers in low-income countries

193
0:11:22.84,000 --> 0:11:23,000
which struggle to feed their population.

194
0:11:26.08,000 --> 0:11:28,000
In the developed world, instead, after food leaves the farm,

195
0:11:28.96,000 --> 0:11:3,000
most food is wasted at the end of the supply chain

196
0:11:31.36,000 --> 0:11:32,000
by markets and consumers,

197
0:11:32.84,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and wasted food ends up in the landfill

198
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:36,000
where it emits methane

199
0:11:37.72,000 --> 0:11:38,000
as it decomposes.

200
0:11:40.76,000 --> 0:11:41,000
This is a consumer choice problem.

201
0:11:43.52,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It's not a technology issue.

202
0:11:46.36,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Preventing food waste from the beginning

203
0:11:48.68,000 --> 0:11:49,000
is the number three solution.

204
0:11:51.76,000 --> 0:11:53,000
But here's the interesting thing.

205
0:11:54.04,000 --> 0:11:56,000
When we look at the food system as a whole

206
0:11:56.44,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and we implement all the production solutions

207
0:11:58.92,000 --> 0:11:59,000
like regenerative agriculture,

208
0:12:01.2,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and we adopt a plant-rich diet,

209
0:12:03.4,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and we reduce food waste,

210
0:12:05.32,000 --> 0:12:1,000
our research shows that we would produce enough food on current farmland

211
0:12:11.2,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to feed the world's growing population a healthy, nutrient-rich diet

212
0:12:15.24,000 --> 0:12:17,000
now until 2050 and beyond.

213
0:12:18.72,000 --> 0:12:21,000
That means we don't need to cut down forests for food production.

214
0:12:23.32,000 --> 0:12:27,000
The solutions to reversing global warming are the same solutions to food insecurity.

215
0:12:29.64,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Now, a solution that often does not get talked enough about,

216
0:12:34.72,000 --> 0:12:35,000
family planning.

217
0:12:36.76,000 --> 0:12:38,000
By providing men and women the right to choose

218
0:12:39.36,000 --> 0:12:43,000
when, how and if to raise a family

219
0:12:43.4,000 --> 0:12:46,000
through reproductive health clinics and education,

220
0:12:46.56,000 --> 0:12:48,000
access to contraception

221
0:12:49.44,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and freedom devoid of persecution

222
0:12:52.68,000 --> 0:12:56,000
can reduce the estimated global population by 2050.

223
0:12:57.96,000 --> 0:12:59,000
That reduced population means reduced demand

224
0:13:00.08,000 --> 0:13:05,000
for electricity, food, travel, buildings and all other resources.

225
0:13:06.56,000 --> 0:13:07,000
All the energy and emissions

226
0:13:07.96,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that are used to produce that higher demand

227
0:13:10.4,000 --> 0:13:13,000
is reduced by providing the basic human right

228
0:13:13.96,000 --> 0:13:16,000
to choose when, how and if to raise a family.

229
0:13:18.68,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But family planning cannot happen without equal quality of education

230
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
to girls currently being denied access.

231
0:13:27.32,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Now, we've taken a small liberty here,

232
0:13:29.6,000 --> 0:13:33,000
because the impact of universal education

233
0:13:34.08,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and family planning resources

234
0:13:36.08,000 --> 0:13:38,000
are so inextricably intertwined

235
0:13:39.04,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that we chose to cut it right down the middle.

236
0:13:42.36,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But taken together, educating girls and family planning

237
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:5,000
is the number one solution to reversing global warming,

238
0:13:50.28,000 --> 0:13:54,000
reducing approximately 120 billion tons of greenhouse gases.

239
0:13:58.12,000 --> 0:13:59,000
So is drawdown possible?

240
0:14:00.24,000 --> 0:14:03,000
The answer is yes, it is possible,

241
0:14:03.68,000 --> 0:14:04,000
but we need all 80 solutions.

242
0:14:06.48,000 --> 0:14:08,000
There are no silver bullets or a subset of solutions

243
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that are going to get us there.

244
0:14:11.48,000 --> 0:14:13,000
The top solutions would take us far along the pathway,

245
0:14:14.08,000 --> 0:14:16,000
but there's no such thing as a small solution.

246
0:14:17.08,000 --> 0:14:18,000
We need all 80.

247
0:14:19.08,000 --> 0:14:2,000
But here's the great thing.

248
0:14:21.24,000 --> 0:14:24,000
We would want to implement these solutions

249
0:14:24.6,000 --> 0:14:26,000
whether or not global warming was even a problem,

250
0:14:28.12,000 --> 0:14:32,000
because they have cascading benefits to human and planetary well-being.

251
0:14:34.36,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Renewable electricity results in clean, abundant access to energy for all.

252
0:14:41.76,000 --> 0:14:43,000
A plant-rich diet, reduced food waste

253
0:14:44.56,000 --> 0:14:48,000
results in a healthy global population with enough food and sustenance.

254
0:14:50.04,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Family planning and educating girls?

255
0:14:53.2,000 --> 0:14:55,000
This is about human rights,

256
0:14:55.84,000 --> 0:14:56,000
about gender equality.

257
0:14:58.8,000 --> 0:15:01,000
This is about economic improvement and the freedom of choice.

258
0:15:02.72,000 --> 0:15:03,000
It's about justice.

259
0:15:05.68,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Regenerative agriculture, managed grazing, agroforestry, silvopasture

260
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:13,000
restores soil health, benefits farmers

261
0:15:13.96,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and brings carbon back to the land.

262
0:15:17.32,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Protecting our ecosystems also protects biodiversity

263
0:15:21.24,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and safeguards planetary health

264
0:15:23.84,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and the oxygen that we breathe.

265
0:15:26.72,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Its tangible benefits to all species are incalculable.

266
0:15:31.24,000 --> 0:15:35,000
But one last point, because I know it's probably on everybody's mind;

267
0:15:35.32,000 --> 0:15:36,000
how much is this going to cost?

268
0:15:38.52,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Well, we estimate that to implement all 80 solutions

269
0:15:43.44,000 --> 0:15:47,000
would cost about 29 trillion dollars over 30 years.

270
0:15:47.48,000 --> 0:15:48,000
That's just about a trillion a year.

271
0:15:49.48,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Now, I know that sounds like a lot,

272
0:15:52.44,000 --> 0:15:56,000
but we have to remember that global GDP is over 80 trillion every year,

273
0:15:57.48,000 --> 0:16:,000
and the estimated savings from implementing these solutions

274
0:16:01.08,000 --> 0:16:04,000
is 74 trillion dollars, over double the costs.

275
0:16:04.72,000 --> 0:16:07,000
That's a net savings of 44 trillion dollars.

276
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:12,000
So drawdown is possible.

277
0:16:13.32,000 --> 0:16:14,000
We can do it if we want to.

278
0:16:16.2,000 --> 0:16:21,000
It's not going to cost that much, and the return on that investment is huge.

279
0:16:23.52,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Here's the welcome surprise.

280
0:16:26.28,000 --> 0:16:27,000
When we implement these solutions,

281
0:16:29.2,000 --> 0:16:31,000
we shift the way we do business

282
0:16:31.72,000 --> 0:16:35,000
from a system that is inherently exploitative and extractive

283
0:16:36.64,000 --> 0:16:4,000
to a new normal that is by nature restorative and regenerative.

284
0:16:43.28,000 --> 0:16:46,000
We need to rethink our global goals,

285
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
to move beyond sustainability

286
0:16:49.8,000 --> 0:16:51,000
towards regeneration,

287
0:16:51.96,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and along the way reverse global warming.

288
0:16:55.44,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Thank you.

289
0:16:56.68,000 --> 0:17:,000
(Applause)

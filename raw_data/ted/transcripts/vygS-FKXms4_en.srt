1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
You know, what I do is write for children,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I'm probably America's

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
most widely read children's author, in fact.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I always tell people

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that I don't want to show up looking like a scientist.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
You can have me as a farmer, or in leathers,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and no one has ever chose farmer.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'm here today to talk to you

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
about circles and epiphanies.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And you know, an epiphany

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is usually something you find that you dropped someplace.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
You've just got to go around the block

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to see it as an epiphany.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
That's a painting of a circle.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It's the kind of complicated circle

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that I'm going to tell you about.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
My circle began back in the '60s

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
in high school in Stow, Ohio

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
where I was the class queer.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I was the guy beaten up bloody

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
every week in the boys' room,

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
until one teacher saved my life.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
in the teachers' lounge.

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
She did it in secret.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
She did it for three years.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And I had to get out of town.

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I had a thumb, I had 85 dollars,

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I ended up in San Francisco, California --

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
met a lover --

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and back in the '80s, found it necessary

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to begin work on AIDS organizations.

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
About three or four years ago,

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I got a phone call in the middle of the night

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
from that teacher, Mrs. Posten,

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
who said, "I need to see you.

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I'm disappointed

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that we never got to know each other as adults.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Could you please come to Ohio,

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and please bring that man

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
that I know you have found by now.

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And I should mention

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that I have pancreatic cancer,

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and I'd like you to please

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
be quick about this."

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Well, the next day we were in Cleveland.

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We took a look at her, we laughed, we cried,

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice.

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We found her one, we got her there,

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and we took care of her

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and watched over her family,

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
because it was necessary.

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It's something we knew how to do.

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
got to know me,

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
she turned into a box of ashes

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and was placed in my hands.

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And what had happened

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
was the circle had closed,

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
it had become a circle --

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and that epiphany I talked about

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
presented itself.

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The epiphany is

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that death is a part of life.

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
She saved my life;

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I and my partner saved hers.

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And you know, that part of life needs everything

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that the rest of life does.

70
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It needs truth and beauty,

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and I'm so happy it's been mentioned so much here today.

72
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It also needs --

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
it needs dignity,

74
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
love and pleasure,

75
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and it's our job to hand those things out.

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Thank you.

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Applause)

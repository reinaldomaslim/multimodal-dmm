2
0:00:12.937,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Many of us here use technology in our day-to-day.

3
0:00:16.126,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And some of us rely on technology to do our jobs.

4
0:00:19.397,000 --> 0:00:22,000
For a while, I thought of machines and the technologies that drive them

5
0:00:23.371,000 --> 0:00:27,000
as perfect tools that could make my work more efficient and more productive.

6
0:00:28.403,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But with the rise of automation across so many different industries,

7
0:00:31.681,000 --> 0:00:32,000
it led me to wonder:

8
0:00:33.077,000 --> 0:00:35,000
If machines are starting to be able to do the work

9
0:00:35.442,000 --> 0:00:36,000
traditionally done by humans,

10
0:00:37.133,000 --> 0:00:39,000
what will become of the human hand?

11
0:00:40.133,000 --> 0:00:44,000
How does our desire for perfection, precision and automation

12
0:00:44.25,000 --> 0:00:45,000
affect our ability to be creative?

13
0:00:46.553,000 --> 0:00:5,000
In my work as an artist and researcher, I explore AI and robotics

14
0:00:50.664,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to develop new processes for human creativity.

15
0:00:54.077,000 --> 0:00:55,000
For the past few years,

16
0:00:55.387,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I've made work alongside machines, data and emerging technologies.

17
0:01:00.143,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's part of a lifelong fascination

18
0:01:02.028,000 --> 0:01:04,000
about the dynamics of individuals and systems

19
0:01:04.787,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and all the messiness that that entails.

20
0:01:07.192,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's how I'm exploring questions about where AI ends and we begin

21
0:01:12.024,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and where I'm developing processes

22
0:01:13.69,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that investigate potential sensory mixes of the future.

23
0:01:17.675,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I think it's where philosophy and technology intersect.

24
0:01:20.992,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Doing this work has taught me a few things.

25
0:01:23.642,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's taught me how embracing imperfection

26
0:01:26.49,000 --> 0:01:28,000
can actually teach us something about ourselves.

27
0:01:29.428,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It's taught me that exploring art

28
0:01:31.788,000 --> 0:01:33,000
can actually help shape the technology that shapes us.

29
0:01:35.148,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And it's taught me that combining AI and robotics

30
0:01:38.433,000 --> 0:01:41,000
with traditional forms of creativity -- visual arts in my case --

31
0:01:41.989,000 --> 0:01:43,000
can help us think a little bit more deeply

32
0:01:44.315,000 --> 0:01:46,000
about what is human and what is the machine.

33
0:01:47.942,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And it's led me to the realization

34
0:01:49.673,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that collaboration is the key to creating the space for both

35
0:01:52.752,000 --> 0:01:53,000
as we move forward.

36
0:01:54.387,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It all started with a simple experiment with machines,

37
0:01:57.157,000 --> 0:01:59,000
called "Drawing Operations Unit: Generation 1."

38
0:02:00.434,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I call the machine "D.O.U.G." for short.

39
0:02:02.974,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Before I built D.O.U.G,

40
0:02:04.324,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I didn't know anything about building robots.

41
0:02:07.22,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I took some open-source robotic arm designs,

42
0:02:10.141,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I hacked together a system where the robot would match my gestures

43
0:02:13.506,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and follow [them] in real time.

44
0:02:15.169,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The premise was simple:

45
0:02:16.641,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I would lead, and it would follow.

46
0:02:19.403,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I would draw a line, and it would mimic my line.

47
0:02:22.363,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So back in 2015, there we were, drawing for the first time,

48
0:02:26.085,000 --> 0:02:28,000
in front of a small audience in New York City.

49
0:02:28.728,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The process was pretty sparse --

50
0:02:31.307,000 --> 0:02:34,000
no lights, no sounds, nothing to hide behind.

51
0:02:35.241,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Just my palms sweating and the robot's new servos heating up.

52
0:02:38.95,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughs) Clearly, we were not built for this.

53
0:02:41.82,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But something interesting happened, something I didn't anticipate.

54
0:02:45.077,000 --> 0:02:49,000
See, D.O.U.G., in its primitive form, wasn't tracking my line perfectly.

55
0:02:49.903,000 --> 0:02:51,000
While in the simulation that happened onscreen

56
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
it was pixel-perfect,

57
0:02:53.641,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in physical reality, it was a different story.

58
0:02:56.196,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It would slip and slide and punctuate and falter,

59
0:02:59.037,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and I would be forced to respond.

60
0:03:01.525,000 --> 0:03:02,000
There was nothing pristine about it.

61
0:03:03.327,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And yet, somehow, the mistakes made the work more interesting.

62
0:03:06.589,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The machine was interpreting my line but not perfectly.

63
0:03:09.367,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And I was forced to respond.

64
0:03:10.763,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We were adapting to each other in real time.

65
0:03:13.496,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And seeing this taught me a few things.

66
0:03:15.457,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It showed me that our mistakes actually made the work more interesting.

67
0:03:20.663,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I realized that, you know, through the imperfection of the machine,

68
0:03:24.936,000 --> 0:03:27,000
our imperfections became what was beautiful about the interaction.

69
0:03:29.65,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And I was excited, because it led me to the realization

70
0:03:32.761,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that maybe part of the beauty of human and machine systems

71
0:03:36.435,000 --> 0:03:38,000
is their shared inherent fallibility.

72
0:03:39.197,000 --> 0:03:4,000
For the second generation of D.O.U.G.,

73
0:03:41.041,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I knew I wanted to explore this idea.

74
0:03:43.372,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But instead of an accident produced by pushing a robotic arm to its limits,

75
0:03:47.814,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I wanted to design a system that would respond to my drawings

76
0:03:50.735,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in ways that I didn't expect.

77
0:03:52.592,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So, I used a visual algorithm to extract visual information

78
0:03:56.465,000 --> 0:03:58,000
from decades of my digital and analog drawings.

79
0:03:59.467,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I trained a neural net on these drawings

80
0:04:01.546,000 --> 0:04:03,000
in order to generate recurring patterns in the work

81
0:04:04.435,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that were then fed through custom software back into the machine.

82
0:04:07.935,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I painstakingly collected as many of my drawings as I could find --

83
0:04:12.345,000 --> 0:04:16,000
finished works, unfinished experiments and random sketches --

84
0:04:16.584,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and tagged them for the AI system.

85
0:04:18.607,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And since I'm an artist, I've been making work for over 20 years.

86
0:04:22.315,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Collecting that many drawings took months,

87
0:04:24.363,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it was a whole thing.

88
0:04:25.776,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And here's the thing about training AI systems:

89
0:04:28.395,000 --> 0:04:3,000
it's actually a lot of hard work.

90
0:04:31.022,000 --> 0:04:33,000
A lot of work goes on behind the scenes.

91
0:04:33.237,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But in doing the work, I realized a little bit more

92
0:04:35.942,000 --> 0:04:38,000
about how the architecture of an AI is constructed.

93
0:04:39.387,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And I realized it's not just made of models and classifiers

94
0:04:42.358,000 --> 0:04:43,000
for the neural network.

95
0:04:43.704,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But it's a fundamentally malleable and shapable system,

96
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
one in which the human hand is always present.

97
0:04:50.395,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It's far from the omnipotent AI we've been told to believe in.

98
0:04:54.419,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So I collected these drawings for the neural net.

99
0:04:56.958,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And we realized something that wasn't previously possible.

100
0:05:00.911,000 --> 0:05:04,000
My robot D.O.U.G. became a real-time interactive reflection

101
0:05:05.026,000 --> 0:05:07,000
of the work I'd done through the course of my life.

102
0:05:07.677,000 --> 0:05:1,000
The data was personal, but the results were powerful.

103
0:05:11.566,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And I got really excited,

104
0:05:13.074,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because I started thinking maybe machines don't need to be just tools,

105
0:05:17.68,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but they can function as nonhuman collaborators.

106
0:05:21.537,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And even more than that,

107
0:05:23.108,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I thought maybe the future of human creativity

108
0:05:25.561,000 --> 0:05:26,000
isn't in what it makes

109
0:05:27.109,000 --> 0:05:3,000
but how it comes together to explore new ways of making.

110
0:05:31.101,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So if D.O.U.G._1 was the muscle,

111
0:05:33.315,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and D.O.U.G._2 was the brain,

112
0:05:35.101,000 --> 0:05:37,000
then I like to think of D.O.U.G._3 as the family.

113
0:05:38.482,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I knew I wanted to explore this idea of human-nonhuman collaboration at scale.

114
0:05:43.299,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So over the past few months,

115
0:05:44.696,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I worked with my team to develop 20 custom robots

116
0:05:47.855,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that could work with me as a collective.

117
0:05:49.839,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They would work as a group,

118
0:05:51.156,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and together, we would collaborate with all of New York City.

119
0:05:54.069,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I was really inspired by Stanford researcher Fei-Fei Li,

120
0:05:57.037,000 --> 0:05:59,000
who said, "if we want to teach machines how to think,

121
0:05:59.576,000 --> 0:06:,000
we need to first teach them how to see."

122
0:06:01.584,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It made me think of the past decade of my life in New York,

123
0:06:04.393,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and how I'd been all watched over by these surveillance cameras around the city.

124
0:06:08.41,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And I thought it would be really interesting

125
0:06:10.49,000 --> 0:06:12,000
if I could use them to teach my robots to see.

126
0:06:12.919,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So with this project,

127
0:06:14.831,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I thought about the gaze of the machine,

128
0:06:16.822,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and I began to think about vision as multidimensional,

129
0:06:20.072,000 --> 0:06:21,000
as views from somewhere.

130
0:06:22.151,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We collected video

131
0:06:24.009,000 --> 0:06:27,000
from publicly available camera feeds on the internet

132
0:06:27.096,000 --> 0:06:28,000
of people walking on the sidewalks,

133
0:06:28.81,000 --> 0:06:29,000
cars and taxis on the road,

134
0:06:30.546,000 --> 0:06:31,000
all kinds of urban movement.

135
0:06:33.188,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We trained a vision algorithm on those feeds

136
0:06:35.815,000 --> 0:06:37,000
based on a technique called "optical flow,"

137
0:06:38.125,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to analyze the collective density,

138
0:06:40.126,000 --> 0:06:43,000
direction, dwell and velocity states of urban movement.

139
0:06:44.178,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Our system extracted those states from the feeds as positional data

140
0:06:48.471,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and became pads for my robotic units to draw on.

141
0:06:51.868,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Instead of a collaboration of one-to-one,

142
0:06:54.426,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we made a collaboration of many-to-many.

143
0:06:57.474,000 --> 0:07:,000
By combining the vision of human and machine in the city,

144
0:07:01.085,000 --> 0:07:03,000
we reimagined what a landscape painting could be.

145
0:07:03.903,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Throughout all of my experiments with D.O.U.G.,

146
0:07:06.145,000 --> 0:07:08,000
no two performances have ever been the same.

147
0:07:08.886,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And through collaboration,

148
0:07:10.292,000 --> 0:07:12,000
we create something that neither of us could have done alone:

149
0:07:13.18,000 --> 0:07:15,000
we explore the boundaries of our creativity,

150
0:07:15.815,000 --> 0:07:17,000
human and nonhuman working in parallel.

151
0:07:19.823,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I think this is just the beginning.

152
0:07:22.569,000 --> 0:07:24,000
This year, I've launched Scilicet,

153
0:07:24.776,000 --> 0:07:28,000
my new lab exploring human and interhuman collaboration.

154
0:07:29.339,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We're really interested in the feedback loop

155
0:07:31.483,000 --> 0:07:35,000
between individual, artificial and ecological systems.

156
0:07:36.276,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We're connecting human and machine output

157
0:07:38.569,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to biometrics and other kinds of environmental data.

158
0:07:41.577,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We're inviting anyone who's interested in the future of work, systems

159
0:07:45.68,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and interhuman collaboration

160
0:07:47.299,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to explore with us.

161
0:07:48.873,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We know it's not just technologists that have to do this work

162
0:07:52.302,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and that we all have a role to play.

163
0:07:54.429,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We believe that by teaching machines

164
0:07:56.696,000 --> 0:07:58,000
how to do the work traditionally done by humans,

165
0:07:59.45,000 --> 0:08:01,000
we can explore and evolve our criteria

166
0:08:02.427,000 --> 0:08:04,000
of what's made possible by the human hand.

167
0:08:04.894,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And part of that journey is embracing the imperfections

168
0:08:08.411,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and recognizing the fallibility of both human and machine,

169
0:08:12.125,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in order to expand the potential of both.

170
0:08:14.919,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Today, I'm still in pursuit of finding the beauty

171
0:08:17.244,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in human and nonhuman creativity.

172
0:08:19.865,000 --> 0:08:21,000
In the future, I have no idea what that will look like,

173
0:08:23.627,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but I'm pretty curious to find out.

174
0:08:25.675,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Thank you.

175
0:08:26.85,000 --> 0:08:27,000

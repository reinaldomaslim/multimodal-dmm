1
0:00:13.889,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want to talk to you about how to build and rebuild trust,

2
0:00:17.93,000 --> 0:00:19,000
because it's my belief that trust

3
0:00:20.723,000 --> 0:00:23,000
is the foundation for everything we do,

4
0:00:24.673,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and that if we can learn to trust one another more,

5
0:00:29.126,000 --> 0:00:32,000
we can have unprecedented human progress.

6
0:00:35.277,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But what if trust is broken?

7
0:00:38.531,000 --> 0:00:43,000
What if your CEO is caught on video, disparaging an employee?

8
0:00:45.646,000 --> 0:00:51,000
What if your employees experience a culture of bias, exclusion and worse?

9
0:00:53.742,000 --> 0:00:55,000
What if there's a data breach,

10
0:00:55.948,000 --> 0:01:,000
and it feels an awful lot like a cover-up than seriously addressing it?

11
0:01:02.808,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And most tragically,

12
0:01:04.705,000 --> 0:01:08,000
what if a technological fail leads to the loss of human life?

13
0:01:11.09,000 --> 0:01:13,000
If I was giving this talk six months ago,

14
0:01:13.336,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I would have been wearing an Uber T-shirt.

15
0:01:18.509,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I'm a Harvard Business School professor,

16
0:01:20.771,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but I was super attracted to going to an organization

17
0:01:25.519,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that was metaphorically and perhaps quite literally on fire.

18
0:01:32.57,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I had read everything that was written in the newspaper,

19
0:01:35.214,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and that was precisely what drew me to the organization.

20
0:01:39.295,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This was an organization that had lost trust

21
0:01:42.89,000 --> 0:01:45,000
with every constituent that mattered.

22
0:01:47.46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But there's a word about me that I should share.

23
0:01:50.174,000 --> 0:01:52,000
My favorite trait is redemption.

24
0:01:54.064,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I believe that there is a better version of us around every corner,

25
0:01:58.999,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and I have seen firsthand

26
0:02:00.862,000 --> 0:02:02,000
how organizations and communities

27
0:02:03.564,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and individuals change at breathtaking speed.

28
0:02:08.467,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I went to Uber with the hopes that a turnaround there

29
0:02:12.721,000 --> 0:02:14,000
could give license to the rest of us

30
0:02:15.327,000 --> 0:02:18,000
who might have narrower versions of their challenges.

31
0:02:21.066,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But when I got to Uber, I made a really big mistake.

32
0:02:26.343,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I publicly committed to wearing an Uber T-shirt every day

33
0:02:31.644,000 --> 0:02:34,000
until every other employee was wearing an Uber T-shirt.

34
0:02:36.179,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I had clearly not thought that through.

35
0:02:39.062,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:40.734,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It was 250 days of wearing an Uber T-shirt.

37
0:02:46.119,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now I am liberated from that commitment,

38
0:02:50.522,000 --> 0:02:52,000
as I am back at HBS,

39
0:02:52.745,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and what I'd like to do is share with you

40
0:02:56.954,000 --> 0:03:,000
how far I have taken that liberty,

41
0:03:01.079,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which, it's baby steps,

42
0:03:04.198,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughter)

43
0:03:05.452,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but I would just say I'm on my way.

44
0:03:07.483,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

45
0:03:09.223,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Now, trust, if we're going to rebuild it,

46
0:03:12.811,000 --> 0:03:14,000
we have to understand its component parts.

47
0:03:15.89,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The component parts of trust are super well understood.

48
0:03:19.772,000 --> 0:03:21,000
There's three things about trust.

49
0:03:24.349,000 --> 0:03:28,000
If you sense that I am being authentic,

50
0:03:28.757,000 --> 0:03:3,000
you are much more likely to trust me.

51
0:03:32.147,000 --> 0:03:37,000
If you sense that I have real rigor in my logic,

52
0:03:37.719,000 --> 0:03:39,000
you are far more likely to trust me.

53
0:03:40.528,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And if you believe that my empathy is directed towards you,

54
0:03:45.465,000 --> 0:03:47,000
you are far more likely to trust me.

55
0:03:48.303,000 --> 0:03:5,000
When all three of these things are working,

56
0:03:51.128,000 --> 0:03:53,000
we have great trust.

57
0:03:54.165,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But if any one of these three gets shaky,

58
0:03:57.563,000 --> 0:04:,000
if any one of these three wobbles,

59
0:04:01.212,000 --> 0:04:02,000
trust is threatened.

60
0:04:04.291,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now here's what I'd like to do.

61
0:04:06.071,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I want each of us to be able to engender more trust tomorrow,

62
0:04:11.252,000 --> 0:04:13,000
literally tomorrow, than we do today.

63
0:04:15.339,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And the way to do that is to understand where trust wobbles for ourselves

64
0:04:21.182,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and have a ready-made prescription to overcome it.

65
0:04:24.46,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So that's what I would like to do together.

66
0:04:28.039,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Would you give me some sense of whether or not you're here voluntarily?

67
0:04:31.96,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Laughter)

68
0:04:33.071,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Yeah. OK. Alright. Awesome.

69
0:04:35.459,000 --> 0:04:36,000
OK. So --

70
0:04:36.993,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

71
0:04:38.357,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it's just super helpful feedback.

72
0:04:40.147,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

73
0:04:42.457,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So the most common wobble is empathy.

74
0:04:49.061,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The most common wobble

75
0:04:50.41,000 --> 0:04:54,000
is that people just don't believe that we're mostly in it for them,

76
0:04:55.416,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and they believe that we're too self-distracted.

77
0:04:59.423,000 --> 0:05:,000
And it's no wonder.

78
0:05:01.005,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We are all so busy with so many demands on our time,

79
0:05:04.637,000 --> 0:05:07,000
it's easy to crowd out the time and space

80
0:05:08.358,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that empathy requires.

81
0:05:10.883,000 --> 0:05:12,000
For Dylan to be Dylan, that takes real time.

82
0:05:15.276,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And for us, if we have too much to do, we may not have that time.

83
0:05:20.466,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But that puts us into a vicious cycle,

84
0:05:22.989,000 --> 0:05:24,000
because without revealing empathy,

85
0:05:25.759,000 --> 0:05:27,000
it makes everything harder.

86
0:05:27.998,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Without the benefit of the doubt of trust, it makes everything harder,

87
0:05:31.689,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and then we have less and less time for empathy, and so it goes.

88
0:05:36.232,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So here's the prescription:

89
0:05:39.66,000 --> 0:05:45,000
identify where, when and to whom

90
0:05:46.375,000 --> 0:05:48,000
you are likely to offer your distraction.

91
0:05:51.161,000 --> 0:05:54,000
That should trace pretty perfectly

92
0:05:54.273,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to when, where and to whom you are likely to withhold your empathy.

93
0:06:01.123,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And if in those instances,

94
0:06:03.748,000 --> 0:06:09,000
we can come up with a trigger that gets us to look up,

95
0:06:10.017,000 --> 0:06:13,000
look at the people right in front of us,

96
0:06:13.164,000 --> 0:06:14,000
listen to them,

97
0:06:14.997,000 --> 0:06:18,000
deeply immerse ourselves in their perspectives,

98
0:06:19.161,000 --> 0:06:23,000
then we have a chance of having a sturdy leg of empathy.

99
0:06:24.811,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And if you do nothing else,

100
0:06:27.902,000 --> 0:06:3,000
please put away your cell phone.

101
0:06:31.787,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It is the largest distraction magnet yet to be made,

102
0:06:36.8,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and it is super difficult to create empathy and trust in its presence.

103
0:06:44.241,000 --> 0:06:46,000
That takes care of the empathy wobblers.

104
0:06:48.14,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Logic wobbles can come in two forms.

105
0:06:52.189,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It's either the quality of your logic

106
0:06:56.752,000 --> 0:06:59,000
or it's your ability to communicate the logic.

107
0:07:00.777,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Now if the quality of your logic is at risk,

108
0:07:04.507,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I can't really help you with that.

109
0:07:06.159,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

110
0:07:07.522,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It's like, not in this much time.

111
0:07:09.191,000 --> 0:07:12,000
(Laughter)

112
0:07:12.678,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But fortunately, it's often the case that our logic is sound,

113
0:07:17.782,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but it's our ability to communicate the logic that is in jeopardy.

114
0:07:23.295,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Super fortunately, there's a very easy fix to this.

115
0:07:27.673,000 --> 0:07:32,000
If we consider that there are two ways to communicate in the world,

116
0:07:33.667,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and Harvard Business School professors are known for two-by-twos --

117
0:07:36.834,000 --> 0:07:38,000
nonsense, it's the triangle that rocks.

118
0:07:39.326,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

119
0:07:42.837,000 --> 0:07:46,000
If we consider that there are two ways to communicate in the world,

120
0:07:47.036,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and the first one is when you take us on a journey,

121
0:07:51.674,000 --> 0:07:55,000
a magnificent journey that has twists and turns

122
0:07:56.681,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and mystery and drama,

123
0:07:59.837,000 --> 0:08:01,000
until you ultimately get to the point,

124
0:08:03.536,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and some of the best communicators in the world

125
0:08:06.636,000 --> 0:08:08,000
communicate just like this.

126
0:08:09.432,000 --> 0:08:11,000
But if you have a logic wobble,

127
0:08:11.988,000 --> 0:08:13,000
this can be super dangerous.

128
0:08:15.31,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So instead, I implore you,

129
0:08:19.856,000 --> 0:08:24,000
start with your point in a crisp half-sentence,

130
0:08:25.103,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and then give your supporting evidence.

131
0:08:29.777,000 --> 0:08:31,000
This means that people will be able to get access

132
0:08:32.218,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to our awesome ideas,

133
0:08:34.435,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and just as importantly,

134
0:08:37.585,000 --> 0:08:39,000
if you get cut off before you're done ...

135
0:08:41.894,000 --> 0:08:42,000
ladies --

136
0:08:43.346,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Laughter)

137
0:08:45.965,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Applause)

138
0:08:52.794,000 --> 0:08:55,000
If you get cut off before you're done,

139
0:08:56.241,000 --> 0:08:57,000
you still get credit for the idea,

140
0:08:58.184,000 --> 0:09:01,000
as opposed to someone else coming in and snatching it from you.

141
0:09:01.765,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Applause)

142
0:09:08.359,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You just gave me goosebumps.

143
0:09:09.717,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

144
0:09:11.92,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The third wobble is authenticity, and I find it to be the most vexing.

145
0:09:17.73,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We as a human species can sniff out in a moment,

146
0:09:21.128,000 --> 0:09:22,000
literally in a moment,

147
0:09:23.14,000 --> 0:09:26,000
whether or not someone is being their authentic true self.

148
0:09:27.705,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So in many ways, the prescription is clear.

149
0:09:30.948,000 --> 0:09:33,000
You don't want to have an authenticity wobble? Be you.

150
0:09:35.675,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Great.

151
0:09:38.255,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And that is super easy to do

152
0:09:40.549,000 --> 0:09:43,000
when you're around people who are like you.

153
0:09:45.817,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But if you represent any sort of difference,

154
0:09:50.659,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the prescription to "be you" can be super challenging.

155
0:09:57.905,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I have been tempted at every step of my career,

156
0:10:02.02,000 --> 0:10:05,000
tempted personally and tempted by coaching of others,

157
0:10:05.317,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to mute who I am in the world.

158
0:10:08.688,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I'm a woman of super strong opinions,

159
0:10:11.762,000 --> 0:10:13,000
with really deep convictions,

160
0:10:14.421,000 --> 0:10:15,000
direct speech.

161
0:10:16.602,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I have a magnificent wife,

162
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and together, we have such crazy ambition.

163
0:10:23.95,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I prefer men's clothes

164
0:10:26.743,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and comfortable shoes.

165
0:10:29.045,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Thank you, Allbirds.

166
0:10:30.481,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Laughter)

167
0:10:33.642,000 --> 0:10:36,000
In some contexts, this makes me different.

168
0:10:38.229,000 --> 0:10:4,000
I hope that each person here

169
0:10:40.345,000 --> 0:10:43,000
has the beautiful luxury of representing difference

170
0:10:44.145,000 --> 0:10:45,000
in some context in your life.

171
0:10:47.295,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But with that privilege

172
0:10:50.154,000 --> 0:10:55,000
comes a very sincere temptation to hold back who we are,

173
0:10:55.935,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and if we hold back who we are,

174
0:10:58.326,000 --> 0:11:,000
we're less likely to be trusted.

175
0:11:00.419,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And if we're less likely to be trusted,

176
0:11:02.356,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we're less likely to be given stretch assignments.

177
0:11:05.133,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And without those stretch assignments, we're less likely to get promoted,

178
0:11:08.586,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and so on and so on until we are super depressed

179
0:11:12.158,000 --> 0:11:14,000
by the demographic tendencies of our senior leadership.

180
0:11:15.518,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Laughter)

181
0:11:16.99,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And it all comes back to our being our authentic selves.

182
0:11:23.77,000 --> 0:11:25,000
So here's my advice.

183
0:11:26.013,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Wear whatever makes you feel fabulous.

184
0:11:30.434,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Pay less attention to what you think people want to hear from you

185
0:11:34.749,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and far more attention to what your authentic, awesome self needs to say.

186
0:11:41.127,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And to the leaders in the room,

187
0:11:44.379,000 --> 0:11:46,000
it is your obligation

188
0:11:46.579,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to set the conditions that not only make it safe for us to be authentic

189
0:11:51.769,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but make it welcome,

190
0:11:54.713,000 --> 0:11:55,000
make it celebrated,

191
0:11:56.975,000 --> 0:11:59,000
cherish it for exactly what it is,

192
0:12:00.54,000 --> 0:12:03,000
which is the key for us achieving greater excellence

193
0:12:03.926,000 --> 0:12:05,000
than we have ever known is possible.

194
0:12:08.416,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So let's go back to Uber. What happened at Uber?

195
0:12:11.74,000 --> 0:12:15,000
When I got there, Uber was wobbling all over the place.

196
0:12:16.913,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Empathy, logic, authenticity were all wobbling like crazy.

197
0:12:22.528,000 --> 0:12:27,000
But we were able to find super effective, super quick fixes for two of the wobbles.

198
0:12:29.636,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I'll give you an illustration of empathy.

199
0:12:32.223,000 --> 0:12:33,000
In the meetings at Uber,

200
0:12:33.621,000 --> 0:12:36,000
it was not uncommon for people to be texting one another ...

201
0:12:38.965,000 --> 0:12:39,000
about the meeting.

202
0:12:40.18,000 --> 0:12:45,000
(Laughter)

203
0:12:45.956,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I had never seen anything like it.

204
0:12:48.25,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Laughter)

205
0:12:50.305,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It may have done many things,

206
0:12:51.767,000 --> 0:12:54,000
but it did not create a safe, empathetic environment.

207
0:12:55.612,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The solution though, super clear:

208
0:12:58.04,000 --> 0:12:59,000
technology, off and away.

209
0:13:00.886,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And that forced people to look up,

210
0:13:03.592,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to look at the people in front of them,

211
0:13:06.268,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to listen to them,

212
0:13:07.69,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to immerse themselves in their perspectives

213
0:13:09.793,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and to collaborate in unprecedented ways.

214
0:13:15.128,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Logic was equally wobbly,

215
0:13:18.773,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and this was because the hypergrowth of the organization

216
0:13:21.694,000 --> 0:13:23,000
meant that people, managers were getting promoted

217
0:13:24.385,000 --> 0:13:26,000
again and again and again.

218
0:13:27.281,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Soon, they were put in positions that they had no business being in.

219
0:13:31.818,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Their positions outstripped their capability,

220
0:13:34.148,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and it was not their fault.

221
0:13:36.6,000 --> 0:13:4,000
The solution: a massive influx of executive education

222
0:13:41.354,000 --> 0:13:44,000
that focused specifically on logic,

223
0:13:45.036,000 --> 0:13:47,000
on strategy and leadership.

224
0:13:48.119,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It gave people the rigor of the quality of their logic,

225
0:13:51.587,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and it turned a whole lot of triangles, right-side up,

226
0:13:56.771,000 --> 0:13:59,000
so people were able to communicate effectively with one another.

227
0:14:01.554,000 --> 0:14:05,000
The last one, authenticity, I'll say it's still mighty wobbly,

228
0:14:07.173,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but honestly, that doesn't make Uber very different

229
0:14:09.666,000 --> 0:14:12,000
from all of the other companies I've seen in Silicon Valley and beyond.

230
0:14:15.194,000 --> 0:14:19,000
It is still much easier to coach people to fit in.

231
0:14:20.627,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It is still much easier to reward people

232
0:14:23.73,000 --> 0:14:26,000
when they say something that you were going to say,

233
0:14:27.141,000 --> 0:14:29,000
as opposed to rewarding people when they say something

234
0:14:29.697,000 --> 0:14:31,000
entirely different than what you were going to say.

235
0:14:34.157,000 --> 0:14:36,000
But when we figure out this,

236
0:14:36.7,000 --> 0:14:39,000
when we figure out how to celebrate difference

237
0:14:40.394,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and how to let people bring the best version of themselves forward,

238
0:14:43.989,000 --> 0:14:47,000
well holy cow, is that the world I want my sons to grow up in.

239
0:14:49.28,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And with the collection of people here,

240
0:14:51.32,000 --> 0:14:54,000
it would be a privilege to lock arms with you

241
0:14:54.473,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and go ahead and rebuild trust in every corner of the globe.

242
0:14:58.838,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Thank you very much.

243
0:15:00.013,000 --> 0:15:04,000
(Applause)

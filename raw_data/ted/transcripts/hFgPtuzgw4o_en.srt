1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
rarely makes the front pages.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It, however, is enormous

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in both scale and importance.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Look, you all are very well traveled;

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
this is TEDGlobal after all.

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But I do hope to take you to some places

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
you've never been to before.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So, let's start off in China.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
This photo was taken two weeks ago.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Actually, one indication is that little boy on my husband's shoulders

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
has just graduated from high school.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But this is Tiananmen Square.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Many of you have been there. It's not the real China.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Let me take you to the real China.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This is in the Dabian Mountains

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
in the remote part of Hubei province in central China.

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Dai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
She lives with her parents,

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
her two brothers and her great-aunt.

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
They have a hut that has no electricity,

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
no running water,

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
no wristwatch, no bicycle.

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And they share this great splendor

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
with a very large pig.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Dai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said,

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"We're going to pull you out of school

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
because the 13-dollar school fees are too much for us.

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
You're going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies.

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Why would we waste this money on you?"

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This is what happens to girls in remote areas.

33
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Turns out that Dai Manju was

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the best pupil in her grade.

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
She still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and tried to catch every little bit of information

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that seeped out of the doors.

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We wrote about her in The New York Times.

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We got a flood of donations --

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
mostly 13-dollar checks

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
because New York Times readers are very generous

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in tiny amounts

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but then, we got a money transfer

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
for $10,000 --

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
really nice guy.

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We turned the money over to that man there, the principal of the school.

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
He was delighted.

49
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
He thought, "Oh, I can renovate the school.

50
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I can give scholarships to all the girls,

51
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
you know, if they work hard and stay in school.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So Dai Manju basically

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
finished out middle school.

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
She went to high school.

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
She went to vocational school for accounting.

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south.

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
She found a job, she scouted for jobs

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
for her classmates and her friends.

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
She sent money back to her family.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
They built a new house,

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
this time with running water,

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
electricity, a bicycle,

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
no pig.

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
What we saw was a natural experiment.

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It is rare to get an exogenous investment

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in girls' education.

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And over the years, as we followed Dai Manju, we were able to see

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and into a virtuous cycle.

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
She not only changed her own dynamic,

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
she changed her household, she changed her family, her village.

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The village became a real standout.

73
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Of course, most of China was flourishing at the time,

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but they were able to get a road built

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to link them up to the rest of China.

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And that brings me to my first major

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
of two tenets of "Half the Sky."

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And that is that

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the central moral challenge

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
of this century

81
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is gender inequity.

82
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In the 19th century, it was slavery.

83
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In the 20th century, it was totalitarianism.

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The cause of our time

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
is the brutality that so many people

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
face around the world because of their gender.

87
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So some of you may be thinking,

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
"Gosh, that's hyperbole.

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
She's exaggerating."

90
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Well, let me ask you this question.

91
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world?

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Let me take a poll. How many of you think there are more males in the world?

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Hands up, please.

94
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
How many of you think -- a few -- how many of you there are more females in the world?

95
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Okay, most of you.

96
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Well, you know this latter group, you're wrong.

97
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
There are, true enough,

98
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in Europe and the West,

99
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
when women and men

100
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
have equal access to food and health care,

101
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
there are more women, we live longer.

102
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But in most of the rest of the world, that's not the case.

103
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
In fact, demographers have shown

104
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that there are anywhere between 60 million

105
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and 100 million

106
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
missing females in the current population.

107
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And, you know, it happens for several reasons.

108
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
For instance, in the last half-century,

109
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
more girls were discriminated to death

110
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
than all the people killed on all the battlefields

111
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in the 20th century.

112
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Sometimes it's also because of the sonogram.

113
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Girls get aborted before they're even born

114
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
when there are scarce resources.

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
This girl here, for instance,

116
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is in a feeding center in Ethiopia.

117
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The entire center was filled with girls like her.

118
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
What's remarkable is that her brothers, in the same family,

119
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
were totally fine.

120
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
In India, in the first year of life,

121
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
from zero to one,

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate

123
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because they depend upon the breast,

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and the breast shows no son preference.

125
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
From one to five,

126
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate

127
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
than boys, in all of India.

128
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The second tenet of "Half the Sky"

129
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
is that, let's put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all,

130
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and just on a purely practical level,

131
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we think that

132
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism

133
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
is to educate girls

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and to bring women into the formal labor force.

135
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Poverty, for instance.

136
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
There are three reasons why this is the case.

137
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
For one, overpopulation is one of

138
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
the persistent causes of poverty.

139
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And you know, when you educate a boy,

140
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
his family tends to have fewer kids,

141
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but only slightly.

142
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
When you educate a girl,

143
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
she tends to have significantly fewer kids.

144
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
The second reason is

145
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
it has to do with spending.

146
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It's kind of like the dirty, little secret of poverty,

147
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
which is that,

148
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
not only do poor people

149
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
take in very little income,

150
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
but also, the income that they take in,

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
they don't spend it very wisely,

152
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and unfortunately, most of that spending is done by men.

153
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So research has shown,

154
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
if you look at people who live under two dollars a day --

155
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
one metric of poverty --

156
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
two percent of that take-home pay

157
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
goes to this basket here, in education.

158
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of

159
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
alcohol, tobacco, sugary drinks --

160
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and prostitution and festivals.

161
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
If you just take four percentage points

162
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and put it into this basket,

163
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
you would have a transformative effect.

164
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The last reason has to do

165
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
with women being part of the solution, not the problem.

166
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
You need to use scarce resources.

167
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It's a waste of resources if you don't use someone like Dai Manju.

168
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Bill Gates put it very well

169
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia.

170
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves.

171
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
However, two-thirds of the way there was a barrier.

172
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
On this side was men,

173
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and then the barrier, and this side was women.

174
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And someone from this side of the room got up and said,

175
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
"Mr. Gates, we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia

176
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to be one of the top 10 countries

177
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
when it comes to technology.

178
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Do you think we'll make it?"

179
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So Bill Gates, as he was staring out at the audience, he said,

180
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
"If you're not fully utilizing half the resources in your country,

181
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
there is no way you will get anywhere near the top 10."

182
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So here is Bill of Arabia.

183
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
(Laughter)

184
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So what would some of the specific challenges

185
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
look like?

186
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I would say, on the top of the agenda

187
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is sex trafficking.

188
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And I'll just say two things about this.

189
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The slavery at the peak of the slave trade

190
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in the 1780s:

191
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
there were about 80,000 slaves

192
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
transported from Africa to the New World.

193
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Now, modern slavery:

194
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
according to State Department rough statistics,

195
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number --

196
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that are trafficked across international borders.

197
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And that does not even include those

198
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that are trafficked within country borders,

199
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
which is a substantial portion.

200
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And if you look at

201
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
another factor, another contrast,

202
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
a slave back then is worth

203
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
about $40,000

204
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in today's money.

205
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Today, you can buy a girl trafficked

206
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
for a few hundred dollars,

207
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
which means she's actually more disposable.

208
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But you know, there is progress being made

209
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
in places like Cambodia and Thailand.

210
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We don't have to expect a world

211
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
where girls are bought and sold or killed.

212
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The second item on the agenda

213
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
is maternal mortality.

214
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
You know, childbirth in this part of the world

215
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
is a wonderful event.

216
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
In Niger, one in seven women

217
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
can expect to die during childbirth.

218
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Around the world,

219
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth.

220
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You know, it's not as though

221
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
we don't have the technological solution,

222
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but these women have three strikes against them:

223
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
they are poor, they are rural

224
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and they are female.

225
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You know, for every woman who does die,

226
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
there are 20 who survive

227
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but end up with an injury.

228
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And the most devastating injury

229
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
is obstetric fistula.

230
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
It's a tearing during obstructed labor

231
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that leaves a woman incontinent.

232
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Let me tell you about Mahabuba.

233
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
She lives in Ethiopia.

234
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
She was married against her will at age 13.

235
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
She got pregnant, ran to the bush to have the baby,

236
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but you know, her body was very immature,

237
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and she ended up having obstructed labor.

238
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The baby died, and she ended up with a fistula.

239
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So that meant she was incontinent;

240
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
she couldn't control her wastes.

241
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
In a word, she stank.

242
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
The villagers thought she was cursed; they didn't know what to do with her.

243
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So finally, they put her at the edge of the village in a hut.

244
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
They ripped off the door

245
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
so that the hyenas would get her at night.

246
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
That night, there was a stick in the hut.

247
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
She fought off the hyenas with that stick.

248
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And the next morning,

249
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary,

250
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
she would be saved.

251
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Because she had some damage to her nerves,

252
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
she crawled all the way -- 30 miles --

253
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to that doorstep, half dead.

254
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
The foreign missionary opened the door,

255
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
knew exactly what had happened,

256
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
took her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa,

257
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and she was repaired

258
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
with a 350-dollar operation.

259
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The doctors and nurses there noticed

260
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that she was not only a survivor,

261
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
she was really clever, and they made her a nurse.

262
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So now, Mahabuba,

263
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
she is saving the lives

264
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
of hundreds, thousands, of women.

265
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
She has become part of the solution, not the problem.

266
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
She's moved out of a vicious cycle

267
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and into a virtuous cycle.

268
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I've talked about some of the challenges,

269
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
let me talk about some of the solutions,

270
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and there are predictable solutions.

271
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I've hinted at them: education

272
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and also economic opportunity.

273
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So of course, when you educate a girl,

274
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
she tends to get married later on in life,

275
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
she tends to have kids later on in life, she tends to have fewer kids,

276
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and those kids that she does have,

277
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
she educates them in a more enlightened fashion.

278
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
With economic opportunity,

279
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
it can be transformative.

280
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Let me tell you about Saima.

281
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
She lives in a small village outside Lahore, Pakistan.

282
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And at the time, she was miserable.

283
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
She was beaten every single day

284
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
by her husband, who was unemployed.

285
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
He was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable, therefore --

286
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and took his frustrations out on her.

287
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Well, when she had her second daughter,

288
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
her mother in-law told her son,

289
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
"I think you'd better get a second wife.

290
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Saima's not going to produce you a son."

291
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
This is when she had her second daughter.

292
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
At the time, there was

293
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
a microlending group in the village

294
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that gave her a 65-dollar loan.

295
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Saima took that money,

296
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and she started an embroidery business.

297
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The merchants liked her embroidery; it sold very well,

298
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and they kept asking for more.

299
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And when she couldn't produce enough,

300
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
she hired other women in the village.

301
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Pretty soon she had 30 women in the village

302
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
working for her embroidery business.

303
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And then,

304
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
when she had to transport all of the embroidery goods

305
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
from the village to the marketplace,

306
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
she needed someone to help her do the transport,

307
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
so she hired her husband.

308
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So now they're in it together.

309
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
He does the transportation and distribution,

310
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and she does the production and sourcing.

311
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And now they have a third daughter,

312
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and the daughters, all of them, are being tutored in education

313
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
because Saima knows what's really important.

314
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
Which brings me to the final element, which is education.

315
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Larry Summers, when he was chief economist at the World Bank,

316
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
once said that, "It may well be

317
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that the highest return on investment

318
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
in the developing world

319
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
is in girls' education."

320
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira.

321
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Beatrice was living in Uganda

322
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
near the Congo border,

323
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and like Dai Manju, she didn't go to school.

324
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Actually, she had never been to school,

325
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
not to a lick, one day.

326
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Her parents, again, said,

327
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
"Why should we spend the money on her?

328
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
She's going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth."

329
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Well, it just so happens, at that time,

330
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
there was a group in Connecticut

331
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut.

332
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
They made a donation to an organization

333
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
based in Arkansas

334
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
called Heifer International.

335
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Heifer sent two goats to Africa.

336
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
One of them ended up with Beatrice's parents,

337
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and that goat had twins.

338
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
The twins started producing milk.

339
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
They sold the milk for cash.

340
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
The cash started accumulating,

341
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and pretty soon the parents said,

342
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
"You know, we've got enough money. Let's send Beatrice to school."

343
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So at nine years of age,

344
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Beatrice started in first grade --

345
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
after all, she'd never been to a lick of school --

346
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
with a six year-old.

347
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
No matter, she was just delighted to be in school.

348
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
She rocketed to the top of her class.

349
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
She stayed at the top of her class

350
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
through elementary school, middle school,

351
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and then in high school,

352
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
she scored brilliantly on the national examinations

353
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
so that she became the first person in her village,

354
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
ever, to come to the United States

355
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
on scholarship.

356
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Two years ago,

357
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
she graduated from Connecticut College.

358
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
On the day of her graduation,

359
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
she said, "I am the luckiest girl alive

360
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
because of a goat."

361
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
(Laughter)

362
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And that goat was $120.

363
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
So you see how transformative

364
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
little bits of help can be.

365
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
But I want to give you a reality check.

366
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Look: U.S. aid, helping people is not easy,

367
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid.

368
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
There's Bill Easterly's book.

369
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
There's a book called "Dead Aid."

370
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
You know, the criticism is fair;

371
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
it isn't easy.

372
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
You know, people say how

373
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
half of all water well projects, a year later, are failed.

374
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
When I was in Zimbabwe,

375
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
we were touring a place with the village chief --

376
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
he wanted to raise money for a secondary school --

377
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and there was some construction a few yards away,

378
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and I said, "What's that?"

379
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
He sort of mumbled.

380
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Turns out that it's a failed irrigation project.

381
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop.

382
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
One year, all the chickens died, and no one wanted to put the chickens in there.

383
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
It's true, but we think that you don't through the baby out with the bathwater;

384
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
you actually improve.

385
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
You learn from your mistakes, and you continuously improve.

386
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
We also think that individuals

387
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
can make a difference, and they should,

388
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
because individuals, together,

389
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
we can all help create a movement.

390
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And a movement of men and women

391
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
is what's needed to bring about social change,

392
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
change that will address

393
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
this great moral challenge.

394
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So then, I ask,

395
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
what's in it for you?

396
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
You're probably asking that. Why should you care?

397
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I will just leave you with two things.

398
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
One is that research shows

399
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
that once you have

400
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
all of your material needs taken care of --

401
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
which most of us, all of us, here in this room do --

402
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
research shows that

403
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
there are very few things in life

404
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
that can actually elevate your level of happiness.

405
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
One of those things

406
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
is contributing to a cause larger than yourself.

407
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
And the second thing,

408
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
it's an anecdote that I'll leave you with.

409
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And that is the story

410
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
of an aid worker in Darfur.

411
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Here was a woman

412
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
who had worked in Darfur,

413
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
seeing things that no human being should see.

414
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Throughout her time there,

415
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
she was strong, she was steadfast.

416
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
She never broke down.

417
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And then she came back to the United States

418
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and was on break, Christmas break.

419
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
She was in her grandmother's backyard,

420
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and she saw something that made her break down in tears.

421
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
What that was

422
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
was a bird feeder.

423
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
And she realized that she had the great fortune

424
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
to be born in a country

425
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
where we take security for granted,

426
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
where we not only can feed, clothe

427
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and house ourselves,

428
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
but also provide for wild birds

429
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
so they don't go hungry in the winter.

430
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And she realized that with that great fortune

431
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
comes great responsibility.

432
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And so, like her,

433
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
you, me,

434
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
we have all won the lottery of life.

435
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
And so the question becomes:

436
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
how do we discharge that responsibility?

437
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
So, here's the cause.

438
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Join the movement.

439
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Feel happier and help save the world.

440
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
Thank you very much.

441
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
(Applause)

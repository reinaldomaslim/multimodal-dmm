1
0:00:13.533,000 --> 0:00:15,000
As a software developer and technologist,

2
0:00:16.479,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I've worked on a number of civic technology projects

3
0:00:19.126,000 --> 0:00:2,000
over the years.

4
0:00:20.472,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Civic tech is sometimes referred to as tech for good,

5
0:00:24.118,000 --> 0:00:27,000
using technology to solve humanitarian problems.

6
0:00:27.763,000 --> 0:00:29,000
This is in 2010 in Uganda,

7
0:00:29.876,000 --> 0:00:31,000
working on a solution that allowed local populations

8
0:00:32.616,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to avoid government surveillance on their mobile phones

9
0:00:36.099,000 --> 0:00:38,000
for expressing dissent.

10
0:00:38.328,000 --> 0:00:4,000
That same technology was deployed later in North Africa

11
0:00:41.216,000 --> 0:00:44,000
for similar purposes to help activists stay connected

12
0:00:44.998,000 --> 0:00:47,000
when governments were deliberately shutting off connectivity

13
0:00:48.149,000 --> 0:00:5,000
as a means of population control.

14
0:00:51.336,000 --> 0:00:54,000
But over the years, as I have thought about these technologies

15
0:00:54.522,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and the things that I work on,

16
0:00:56.523,000 --> 0:00:59,000
a question kind of nags in the back of my mind, which is,

17
0:00:59.542,000 --> 0:01:01,000
what if we're wrong about the virtues of technology,

18
0:01:02.267,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and if it sometimes actively hurts

19
0:01:04.519,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the communities that we're intending to help?

20
0:01:07.677,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The tech industry around the world tends to operate under similar assumptions

21
0:01:11.456,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that if we build great things,

22
0:01:13.621,000 --> 0:01:15,000
it will positively affect everyone.

23
0:01:16.035,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Eventually, these innovations will get out and find everyone.

24
0:01:19.904,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But that's not always the case.

25
0:01:22.003,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I like to call this blind championing of technology "trickle-down techonomics,"

26
0:01:27.784,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to borrow a phrase. (Laughter)

27
0:01:30.129,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We tend to think that if we design things for the select few,

28
0:01:33.045,000 --> 0:01:35,000
eventually those technologies will reach everyone,

29
0:01:35.447,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and that's not always the case.

30
0:01:37.002,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Technology and innovation behaves a lot like wealth and capital.

31
0:01:42.018,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They tend to consolidate in the hands of the few,

32
0:01:44.897,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and sometimes they find their way out into the hands of the many.

33
0:01:48.287,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And so most of you aren't tackling oppressive regimes on the weekends,

34
0:01:53.488,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so I wanted to think of a few examples that might be a little bit more relatable.

35
0:01:57.714,000 --> 0:02:01,000
In the world of wearables and smartphones and apps,

36
0:02:02.066,000 --> 0:02:05,000
there's a big movement to track people's personal health

37
0:02:05.329,000 --> 0:02:08,000
with applications that track the number of calories that you burn

38
0:02:08.401,000 --> 0:02:12,000
or whether you're sitting too much or walking enough.

39
0:02:13.22,000 --> 0:02:19,000
These technologies make patient intake in medical facilities much more efficient,

40
0:02:19.561,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and in turn, these medical facilities

41
0:02:23.496,000 --> 0:02:25,000
are starting to expect these types of efficiencies.

42
0:02:26.083,000 --> 0:02:28,000
As these digital tools find their way into medical rooms,

43
0:02:28.883,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and they become digitally ready,

44
0:02:30.928,000 --> 0:02:32,000
what happens to the digitally invisible?

45
0:02:33.297,000 --> 0:02:35,000
What does the medical experience look like

46
0:02:35.321,000 --> 0:02:38,000
for someone who doesn't have the $400 phone or watch

47
0:02:38.655,000 --> 0:02:39,000
tracking their every movement?

48
0:02:40.448,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Do they now become a burden on the medical system?

49
0:02:43.281,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Is their experience changed?

50
0:02:46.079,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In the world of finance, Bitcoin and crypto-currencies

51
0:02:49.341,000 --> 0:02:51,000
are revolutionizing the way we move money around the world,

52
0:02:52.261,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but the challenge with these technologies

53
0:02:54.658,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is the barrier to entry is incredibly high, right?

54
0:02:57.247,000 --> 0:03:,000
You need access to the same phones, devices, connectivity,

55
0:03:01.043,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and even where you don't, where you can find a proxy agent,

56
0:03:04.178,000 --> 0:03:09,000
usually they require a certain amount of capital to participate.

57
0:03:09.217,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And so the question that I ask myself is, what happens to the last community

58
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:18,000
using paper notes when the rest of the world moves to digital currency?

59
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Another example from my hometown in Philadelphia:

60
0:03:23.055,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I recently went to the public library there,

61
0:03:25.22,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and they are facing an existential crisis.

62
0:03:27.792,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Public funding is dwindling,

63
0:03:29.465,000 --> 0:03:34,000
they have to reduce their footprint to stay open and stay relevant,

64
0:03:34.641,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and so one of the ways they're going about this

65
0:03:37.477,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is digitizing a number of the books and moving them to the cloud.

66
0:03:40.77,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This is great for most kids. Right?

67
0:03:42.745,000 --> 0:03:43,000
You can check out books from home,

68
0:03:44.598,000 --> 0:03:46,000
you can research on the way to school or from school,

69
0:03:47.147,000 --> 0:03:49,000
but these are really two big assumptions,

70
0:03:49.339,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that one, you have access at home,

71
0:03:51.336,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and two, that you have access to a mobile phone,

72
0:03:53.936,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and in Philadelphia, many kids do not.

73
0:03:56.812,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So what does their education experience look like

74
0:03:59.671,000 --> 0:04:02,000
in the wake of a completely cloud-based library,

75
0:04:03.108,000 --> 0:04:06,000
what used to be considered such a basic part of education?

76
0:04:06.567,000 --> 0:04:07,000
How do they stay competitive?

77
0:04:09.566,000 --> 0:04:12,000
A final example from across the world in East Africa:

78
0:04:13.466,000 --> 0:04:18,000
there's been a huge movement to digitize land ownership rights,

79
0:04:18.782,000 --> 0:04:19,000
for a number of reasons.

80
0:04:20.383,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Migrant communities, older generations dying off,

81
0:04:23.285,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and ultimately poor record-keeping

82
0:04:25.925,000 --> 0:04:28,000
have led to conflicts over who owns what.

83
0:04:29.392,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And so there was a big movement to put all this information online,

84
0:04:33.664,000 --> 0:04:36,000
to track all the ownership of these plots of land,

85
0:04:37.424,000 --> 0:04:39,000
put them in the cloud, and give them to the communities.

86
0:04:40.119,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But actually, the unintended consequence of this

87
0:04:43.161,000 --> 0:04:47,000
has been that venture capitalists, investors, real estate developers,

88
0:04:47.584,000 --> 0:04:49,000
have swooped in and they've begun buying up these plots of land

89
0:04:50.647,000 --> 0:04:51,000
right out from under these communities,

90
0:04:52.564,000 --> 0:04:54,000
because they have access to the technologies

91
0:04:54.7,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and the connectivity that makes that possible.

92
0:04:58.137,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So that's the common thread that connects these examples,

93
0:05:01.287,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the unintended consequences of the tools and the technologies that we make.

94
0:05:04.836,000 --> 0:05:06,000
As engineers, as technologists,

95
0:05:07.801,000 --> 0:05:1,000
we sometimes prefer efficiency over efficacy.

96
0:05:11.36,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We think more about doing things than the outcomes of what we are doing.

97
0:05:15.753,000 --> 0:05:16,000
This needs to change.

98
0:05:17.22,000 --> 0:05:21,000
We have a responsibility to think about the outcomes of the technologies we build,

99
0:05:21.251,000 --> 0:05:24,000
especially as they increasingly control the world in which we live.

100
0:05:24.734,000 --> 0:05:25,000
In the late '90s,

101
0:05:26.174,000 --> 0:05:3,000
there was a big push for ethics in the world of investment and banking.

102
0:05:30.283,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I think in 2014, we're long overdue for a similar movement

103
0:05:34.091,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in the area of tech and technology.

104
0:05:38.573,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So, I just encourage you, as you are all thinking about the next big thing,

105
0:05:42.535,000 --> 0:05:47,000
as entrepreneurs, as CEOs, as engineers, as makers,

106
0:05:47.907,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that you think about the unintended consequences

107
0:05:51.784,000 --> 0:05:53,000
of the things that you're building,

108
0:05:53.944,000 --> 0:05:56,000
because the real innovation is in finding ways to include everyone.

109
0:05:57.496,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Thank you.

110
0:05:59.168,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Applause)

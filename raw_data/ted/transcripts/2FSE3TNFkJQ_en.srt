1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Sergey Brin: I want to discuss a question

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I know that's been pressing on many of your minds.

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We spoke to you last several years ago.

4
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And before I get started today,

5
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
since many of you are wondering,

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I just wanted to get it out of the way.

7
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The answer is boxers.

8
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Now I hope all of you feel better.

9
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Do you know what this might be? Does anyone know what that is?

10
0:00:57,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Audience: Yes.

11
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:,000
SB: What is it?

12
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Audience: It's people logging on to Google around the world.

13
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
SB: Wow, OK. I didn't really realize what it was when I first saw it.

14
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But this is what helped me see it.

15
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
This is what we run at the office, that actually runs real time.

16
0:01:11,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Here it's slightly logged.

17
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But here you can see around the world

18
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:18,000
how people are using Google.

19
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And every one of those rising dots

20
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:23,000
represents probably about 20, 30 searches,

21
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:25,000
or something like that.

22
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And they're labeled by color right now, by language.

23
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So you can see: here we are in the U.S.,

24
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and they're all coming up red.

25
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
There we are in Monterey -- hopefully I can get it right.

26
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
You can see that Japan is busy at night,

27
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:4,000
right there.

28
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
We have Tokyo coming in in Japanese.

29
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
There's a lot of activity in China.

30
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
There's a lot of activity in India.

31
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:52,000
There's some in the Middle East, the little pockets.

32
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And Europe, which is right now in the middle of the day,

33
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is going really strong with a whole wide variety of languages.

34
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now you can also see, if I turn this around here --

35
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
hopefully I won't shake the world too much.

36
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But you can also see, there are places where there's not so much.

37
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Australia, because there just aren't very many people there.

38
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And this is something that we should really work on,

39
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
which is Africa, which is just a few trickles,

40
0:02:3,000 --> 0:02:33,000
basically in South Africa and a few other urban cities.

41
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But basically, what we've noticed is these queries,

42
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
which come in at thousands per second,

43
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
are available everywhere there is power.

44
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And pretty much everywhere there is power, there is the Internet.

45
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And even in Antarctica -- well, at least this time of year --

46
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we from time to time will see a query rising up.

47
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And if we had it plotted correctly,

48
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I think the International Space Station would have it, too.

49
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So this is

50
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:13,000
some of the challenge that we have here,

51
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:17,000
is you can see that it's actually kind of hard to get the --

52
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
there we go.

53
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:25,000
This is how we have to move the bits around

54
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to actually get the people the answers to their questions.

55
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:31,000
You can see that there's a lot of data running around.

56
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It has to go all over the world: through fibers,

57
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:36,000
through satellites, through all kinds of connections.

58
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And it's pretty tricky for us to maintain the latencies

59
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:45,000
as low as we try to. Hopefully your experience is good.

60
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But you can see also, once again -- so some places are much more wired

61
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:51,000
than others, and you can see all the bandwidth across the U.S.,

62
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:56,000
going up over to Asia, Europe in the other direction, and so forth.

63
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Now what I would like to do is just to show you

64
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:03,000
what one second of this activity would look like.

65
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And if we can switch to slides --

66
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
all right, here we go.

67
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So this is slowed down.

68
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:2,000
This is what one second looks like.

69
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And this is what we spend a lot of our time doing,

70
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
is just making sure that we can keep up

71
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
with this kind of traffic load.

72
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, each one of those queries

73
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:34,000
has an interesting life and tale of its own.

74
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I mean, it could be somebody's health,

75
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it could be somebody's career, something important to them.

76
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And it could potentially be something

77
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:48,000
as important as tomato sauce,

78
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
or in this case, ketchup.

79
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So this is a query that we had --

80
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I guess it's a popular band that was more popular in some parts of the world than others.

81
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
You can see that it got started right here.

82
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:03,000
In the U.S. and Spain, it was popular at the same time.

83
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But it didn't have quite the same pickup in the U.S.

84
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
as it did in Spain.

85
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And then from Spain, it went to Italy,

86
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and then Germany got excited, and maybe right now the U.K. is enjoying it.

87
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And so I guess the U.S. finally,

88
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
finally started to like it, too.

89
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And I just wanted to play it for you.

90
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Anyway, you can all enjoy it for yourselves --

91
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
hopefully that search will work.

92
0:05:31,000 --> 0:05:35,000
As a part of --

93
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:37,000
you know, part of what we want to do to grow our company

94
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
is to have more searches.

95
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And what that means is we want to have

96
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:46,000
more people who are healthy and educated.

97
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:5,000
More animals, if they start doing searches as well.

98
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:55,000
But partly, we want to make the world a better place,

99
0:05:55,000 --> 0:06:,000
and so one thing that we're embarking upon is the Google Foundation,

100
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and we're in the process of setting that up.

101
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We also have a program already called Google Grants

102
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that now serves over 150 different charities around the world,

103
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and these are some of the charities that are on there.

104
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And it's something I'm very excited to be a part of.

105
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
In fact, many of the organizations that are here --

106
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:21,000
the Acumen Fund, I think ApproTEC we have running, I'm not sure if that one's up yet --

107
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and many of the people who have presented here are running through Google Grants.

108
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
They run Google ads, and we just give them the ad credit

109
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:33,000
so they can let organizations know.

110
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
One of the earlier results that we got --

111
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we have a Singaporean businessman who is now sponsoring a village

112
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of 25 Vietnamese girls for their education,

113
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and that was one of the earliest results. And as I said, now there have been

114
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
many, many stories that have come in,

115
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because we do have hundreds of charities in there,

116
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and the Google Foundation will be an even broader endeavor.

117
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now does anybody know who this is?

118
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:01,000
A-ha!

119
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Audience: Orkut.

120
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:04,000
SB: Yes! Somebody got it.

121
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:07,000
This is Orkut. Is anybody here on Orkut?

122
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Do we have any?

123
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Okay, not very many people know about it.

124
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I'll explain it in a second.

125
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
This is one of our engineers.

126
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We find that they work better when they're submerged and covered with leaves.

127
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:22,000
That's how we churn those products out.

128
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Orkut had a vision to create a social network.

129
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I know all of you are thinking, "Yet another social network."

130
0:07:29,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But it was a dream of his, and we, basically,

131
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:35,000
when people really want to do something, well, we generally let them.

132
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So this is what he built.

133
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:42,000
We just released it in a test phase last month,

134
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and it's been taking off.

135
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
This is our VP of Engineering.

136
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:51,000
You can see the red hair, and I don't know if you can see the nose ring there.

137
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And these are all of his friends.

138
0:07:54,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So this is how -- we just deployed it --

139
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we just decided that people would send each other invitations to get into the service,

140
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and so we just had the people in our company initially send them out.

141
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And now we've grown to over 100,000 members.

142
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And they spread, actually, very quickly, even outside the U.S.

143
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
You can see, even though the U.S. is still the majority here --

144
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:23,000
though, by the way, search-wise, it's only about 30 percent of our traffic --

145
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but it's already going to Japan, and the U.K., and Europe,

146
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and all the rest of the countries.

147
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So it's a fun little project.

148
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:33,000
There are a variety of demographics. I won't bore you with these.

149
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But it's just the kind of thing that we just try out for fun

150
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and see where it goes.

151
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And --

152
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:42,000
well, I'll leave you in suspense.

153
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Larry, you can explain this one.

154
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Larry Page: Thank you, Sergey.

155
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So one of the things -- both Sergey and I

156
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
went to a Montessori school,

157
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and I think, for some reason,

158
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:57,000
this has been incorporated in Google.

159
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:,000
And Sergey mentioned Orkut, which is something that,

160
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:03,000
you know, Orkut wanted to do in his time,

161
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and we call this -- at Google, we've embodied this as "the 20 percent time,"

162
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and the idea is, for 20 percent of your time,

163
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:13,000
if you're working at Google, you can do what you think is the best thing to do.

164
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And many, many things at Google have come out of that,

165
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
such as Orkut and also Google News.

166
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And I think many other things in the world also have come out of this.

167
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Mendel, who was supposed to be teaching high-school students,

168
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:3,000
actually, you know, discovered the laws of genetics --

169
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:32,000
as a hobby, basically.

170
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So many, many useful things come out of this.

171
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And News, which I just mentioned,

172
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
was started by a researcher.

173
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And he just -- he -- after 9/11, he got really interested in the news.

174
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And he said, "Why don't I look at the news better?"

175
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And so he started clustering it by category,

176
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and then he started using it, and then his friends started using it.

177
0:09:56,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And then, besides just looking cute on a baby's bottom,

178
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:03,000
we made it a Googlette,

179
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:06,000
which is basically a small project at Google.

180
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So it'd be like three people, or something like that,

181
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and they would try to make a product.

182
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And we wouldn't really be sure if it's going to work or not.

183
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And in News' case, you know, they had a couple of people

184
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:19,000
working on it for a while, and then more and more people

185
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
started using it, and then we put it out on the Internet,

186
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and more and more people started using it.

187
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And now it's a real, full-blown project with more people on it.

188
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And this is how we keep our innovation running.

189
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I think usually, as companies get bigger,

190
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:35,000
they find it really hard to have small, innovative projects.

191
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And we had this problem, too, for a while, and we said,

192
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:4,000
"Oh, we really need a new concept."

193
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:44,000
You know, the Googlettes -- that's a small project that we're not quite sure if it's going to work or not,

194
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
but we hope it will, and if we do enough of them,

195
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:51,000
some of them will really work and turn out, such as News.

196
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But then we had a problem because then we had over 100 projects.

197
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And I don't know about all of you,

198
0:10:57,000 --> 0:11:,000
but I have trouble keeping 100 things in my head at once.

199
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And we found that if we just wrote all of them down

200
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and ordered them -- and these are kind of made up.

201
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Don't really pay attention to them.

202
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:12,000
For example, the "Buy Iceland" was from a media article.

203
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
We would never do such a crazy thing, but --

204
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:21,000
in any case, we found if we just basically wrote them all down and ordered them,

205
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that most people would actually agree what the ordering should be.

206
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And this was kind of a surprise to me, but

207
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we found that as long as you keep the 100 things in your head,

208
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
which you did by writing them down,

209
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that you could do a pretty good job deciding what to do

210
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and where to put your resources.

211
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And so that's basically what we've done

212
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:43,000
since we instituted that a few years ago, and I think it has really allowed us to be innovative

213
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and still stay reasonably well-organized.

214
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The other thing we discovered is that people like to work on things that are important,

215
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and so naturally,

216
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:57,000
people sort of migrate to the things that are high priorities.

217
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I just wanted to highlight a couple of things

218
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that are new, or you might not know about.

219
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And the top thing, actually, is the Deskbar.

220
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So this is a new -- how many of you use the Google Toolbar?

221
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Raise your hands.

222
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
How many of you use the Deskbar?

223
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
All right, see? You guys should try it out.

224
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But if you go to our site and search

225
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
for "Deskbar," you'll get this.

226
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And the idea is, instead of a toolbar, it's just present all the time

227
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
on your screen on the bottom,

228
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and you can do searches really easily.

229
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And it's sort of like a better version of the toolbar.

230
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Thank you, Sergey.

231
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:36,000
This is another example of a project that somebody at Google

232
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:39,000
was really passionate about, and they just, they got going,

233
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and it's really, really a great product, and really taking off.

234
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Google Answers is something we started, which is really cool,

235
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:49,000
which lets you -- for five to 100 dollars,

236
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:51,000
you can type a question in,

237
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and then there's a pool of researchers

238
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that go out and research it for you, and it's guaranteed and all that,

239
0:12:57,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and you can get actually very good answers to things

240
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:01,000
without spending all that time yourself.

241
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Froogle lets you search shopping information,

242
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and Blogger lets you publish things.

243
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:1,000
But all of these -- well, these were all sort of innovative things that we did that --

244
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
you know, we try many, many different things

245
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:14,000
in our company.

246
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:16,000
We also like to innovate in our physical space,

247
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and we noticed in meetings, you know, you have to wait a long time

248
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
for projectors to turn on and off,

249
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and they're noisy, so people shut them off.

250
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And we didn't like that, so we actually,

251
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
in maybe a couple of weeks, we built these little enclosures

252
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that enclosed the projectors, and so we can leave them on all the time

253
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and they're completely silent.

254
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And as a result, we were able to build some software

255
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that also lets us manage a meeting,

256
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
so when you walk into a meeting room now,

257
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:44,000
it lists all the meetings that are happening,

258
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:46,000
you can very easily take notes, and they just get emailed automatically

259
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:49,000
to all the people that were present in the meeting.

260
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And as we become more of a global company,

261
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:54,000
we find these things really affect us --

262
0:13:54,000 --> 0:13:57,000
you know, can we work effectively with people who aren't in the room?

263
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:,000
And things like that. And simple things like this can really make a big difference.

264
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:06,000
We also have a lot of engineers in those meetings,

265
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and they don't always do their laundry as much as they should.

266
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And so we found it was pretty helpful

267
0:14:15,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to have laundry machines, for our younger employees especially, and ...

268
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:25,000
we also allow dogs and things like that,

269
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and we've had, I think, a really fun culture at our company,

270
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:31,000
which helps people work and enjoy what they're doing.

271
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:33,000
This is actually our "cult picture."

272
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I just wanted to show quickly.

273
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We had this on our website for a while,

274
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:43,000
but we found that after we put it on our website,

275
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:46,000
we didn't get any job applications anymore.

276
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:5,000
But anyway, every year we've taken

277
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:52,000
the whole company on a ski trip.

278
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:56,000
A lot of work happens in companies from people knowing each other, and informally.

279
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And I think we've done a good job encouraging that.

280
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:02,000
It makes it a really fun place to work.

281
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Along with our logos, too, which I think really embody

282
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:08,000
our culture when we change things.

283
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:09,000
In the early days, we were actually advised

284
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:12,000
we should never change our logo because

285
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:15,000
we should establish our brand, you know,

286
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
because, you know, you'd never want to change your logo.

287
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:19,000
You want it to be consistent.

288
0:15:19,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And we said, "Well, that doesn't sound so much fun.

289
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Why don't we try changing it every day?"

290
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
One of the things that really excites me about what we're doing now

291
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:31,000
is we have this thing called AdSense,

292
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and this is a little bit foreshadowing --

293
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:38,000
this is from before Dean dropped out.

294
0:15:38,000 --> 0:15:4,000
But the idea is, like, on a newspaper, for example,

295
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:42,000
we show you relevant ads.

296
0:15:42,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And this is hard to read, but this says "Battle for New Hampshire:

297
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Howard Dean for President" -- articles on Howard Dean.

298
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And these ads are generated automatically --

299
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:52,000
like in this case, on the Washington Post --

300
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:54,000
from the content on the site.

301
0:15:54,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And so we use our over 150,000 advertisers

302
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:,000
and millions of advertisements, so we pick the one

303
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:02,000
that's most relevant to what you're actually looking at,

304
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:04,000
much as we do on search.

305
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:07,000
So the idea is we can make advertising useful,

306
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:09,000
not just annoying, right?

307
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And the nice thing about this,

308
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:13,000
we have a self-serve program,

309
0:16:13,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and many thousands of websites have signed up,

310
0:16:16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and this let's them really make money. And I --

311
0:16:18,000 --> 0:16:2,000
you know, there's a number of people I met --

312
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I met this guy who runs a conservation site at a party,

313
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and he said, "You know, I wasn't making any money.

314
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I just put this thing on my site and I'm making 10,000 dollars a month.

315
0:16:29,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And, you know, thank you.

316
0:16:31,000 --> 0:16:33,000
I don't have to do my other job now."

317
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And I think this is really important for us, because it makes the Internet work better.

318
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:39,000
It makes content get better, it makes searching work better,

319
0:16:39,000 --> 0:16:41,000
when people can really make their livelihood

320
0:16:41,000 --> 0:16:44,000
from producing great content.

321
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:49,000
So this session is supposed to be about the future,

322
0:16:49,000 --> 0:16:52,000
so I'd thought I'd talk at least briefly about it.

323
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And the idea behind this is to do the perfect job doing search,

324
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:57,000
you really have to be smart.

325
0:16:57,000 --> 0:17:,000
Because you can type, you know, any kind of thing into Google,

326
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and you expect an answer back, right?

327
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:07,000
But finding things is tricky, and so you really want intelligence.

328
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And in fact, the ultimate search engine would be smart.

329
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:12,000
It would be artificial intelligence.

330
0:17:12,000 --> 0:17:14,000
And so that's something we work on,

331
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and we even have some people who are excited enough

332
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and crazy enough to work on it now,

333
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and that's really their goal.

334
0:17:2,000 --> 0:17:22,000
So we always hope that Google will be smart,

335
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:25,000
but we're always surprised when other people think that it is.

336
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:28,000
And so I just wanted to give a funny example of this.

337
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:3,000
This is a blog from Iraq,

338
0:17:3,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and it's not really what

339
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:34,000
I'm going to talk about, but I just wanted to show you an example.

340
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Maybe, Sergey, you can highlight this.

341
0:17:36,000 --> 0:17:38,000
So we decided --

342
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:45,000
actually, the highlight's right there. Oh, thank you.

343
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:52,000
So, "related searches," right there. You can't see it that well,

344
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:54,000
but we decided we should put in this feature

345
0:17:54,000 --> 0:17:57,000
into our AdSense ads, called "related searches."

346
0:17:57,000 --> 0:18:,000
And so we'd say, you know, "Did you mean 'search for'" -- what is this,

347
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:03,000
in this case, "Saddam Hussein," because this blog is about Iraq --

348
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:05,000
and you know, in addition to the ads,

349
0:18:05,000 --> 0:18:08,000
and we thought this would be a great idea.

350
0:18:08,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And so there is this blog

351
0:18:1,000 --> 0:18:15,000
of a young person who was kind of depressed, and he said,

352
0:18:15,000 --> 0:18:17,000
"You know, I'm sleeping a lot."

353
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:19,000
He was just kind of writing about his life.

354
0:18:19,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And our algorithms -- not a person, of course,

355
0:18:22,000 --> 0:18:24,000
but our algorithms, our computers --

356
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:26,000
read his blog and decided that

357
0:18:26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
the related search was, "I am bored."

358
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:31,000
And he read this, and he thought a person had decided

359
0:18:31,000 --> 0:18:33,000
that he was boring,

360
0:18:33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
and it was very unfortunate,

361
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and he said, "You know, what are these, you know, bastards at Google doing?

362
0:18:4,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Why don't they like my blog?"

363
0:18:42,000 --> 0:18:44,000
And so then we read his blog, which was getting -- you know,

364
0:18:45,000 --> 0:18:48,000
sort of going from bad to worse,

365
0:18:48,000 --> 0:18:5,000
and we said the related search was, "Retards."

366
0:18:53,000 --> 0:18:55,000
And then, you know, he got even more mad,

367
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:57,000
and he wrote -- like, started swearing and so on.

368
0:18:57,000 --> 0:19:,000
And then we produced "You suck."

369
0:19:,000 --> 0:19:03,000
And finally, it ended with "Kiss my ass."

370
0:19:05,000 --> 0:19:07,000
And so basically, he thought he was dealing with something smart,

371
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:09,000
and of course, you know,

372
0:19:09,000 --> 0:19:11,000
we just sort of wrote this program and we tried it out,

373
0:19:11,000 --> 0:19:14,000
and it didn't quite work,

374
0:19:14,000 --> 0:19:16,000
and we don't have this feature anymore.

375
0:19:18,000 --> 0:19:21,000
So with that, maybe I can switch back to the world.

376
0:19:21,000 --> 0:19:23,000
I wanted to end just by saying that

377
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:25,000
there's a couple things that really make me excited

378
0:19:25,000 --> 0:19:28,000
to be involved with Google,

379
0:19:28,000 --> 0:19:32,000
and one of those is that we're able to make money

380
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:35,000
largely through advertising, and one of the benefits that I didn't expect from that

381
0:19:35,000 --> 0:19:38,000
was that we're able to serve everyone in the world

382
0:19:38,000 --> 0:19:43,000
without worrying about, you know, places that don't have as much money.

383
0:19:43,000 --> 0:19:46,000
So we don't have to worry about our products being sold,

384
0:19:46,000 --> 0:19:49,000
for example, for less money in places that are poor,

385
0:19:49,000 --> 0:19:51,000
and then they get re-imported into the U.S. --

386
0:19:51,000 --> 0:19:53,000
for example, with the drug industry.

387
0:19:53,000 --> 0:19:56,000
And I think we're really lucky to have that kind of business model

388
0:19:56,000 --> 0:19:59,000
because everyone in the world has access to our search,

389
0:19:59,000 --> 0:20:02,000
and I think that's a tremendous, tremendous benefit.

390
0:20:02,000 --> 0:20:05,000
The other thing I wanted to mention just briefly

391
0:20:05,000 --> 0:20:11,000
is that we have a tremendous ability and responsibility

392
0:20:11,000 --> 0:20:14,000
to provide people the right information,

393
0:20:14,000 --> 0:20:16,000
and we view ourselves like a newspaper or a magazine --

394
0:20:16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
that we should provide very objective information.

395
0:20:19,000 --> 0:20:22,000
And so in our search results, we never accept payment for our search results.

396
0:20:22,000 --> 0:20:25,000
We accept payment for advertising,

397
0:20:25,000 --> 0:20:27,000
and we mark it as such.

398
0:20:27,000 --> 0:20:29,000
And that's unlike many of our competitors.

399
0:20:29,000 --> 0:20:32,000
And I think decisions we're able to make like that

400
0:20:32,000 --> 0:20:34,000
have a tremendous impact on the world,

401
0:20:34,000 --> 0:20:36,000
and it makes me really proud to be involved with Google.

402
0:20:36,000 --> 0:20:38,000
So thank you.

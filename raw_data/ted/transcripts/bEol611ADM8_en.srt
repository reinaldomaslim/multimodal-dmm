1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I’m working a lot with motion and animation,

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and also I'm an old DJ and a musician.

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So, music videos are something that I always found interesting,

4
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
but they always seem to be so reactive.

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So I was thinking, can you remove us as creators

6
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and try to make the music be the voice

7
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and have the animation following it?

8
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So with two designers, Tolga and Christina, at my office, we took a track --

9
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
many of you probably know it. It’s about 25 years old,

10
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and it's David Byrne and Brian Eno --

11
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and we did this little animation.

12
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And I think that it's maybe interesting, also,

13
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that it deals with two problematic issues,

14
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
which are rising waters and religion.

15
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Song: Before God destroyed the people on the Earth,

16
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
he warned Noah to build an Ark.

17
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And after Noah built his Ark,

18
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I believe he told Noah to warn the people

19
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that they must change all their wicked ways

20
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
before he come upon them and destroy them.

21
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And when Noah had done built his Ark,

22
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I understand that somebody began to rend a song.

23
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And the song began to move on I understand like this.

24
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And when Noah had done built his Ark ...

25
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Move on ... In fact ... Concern ...

26
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So they get tired, has come dark and rain; they get weary and tired.

27
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And then he went and knocked an old lady house.

28
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And old lady ran to the door and say, "Who is it?"

29
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Jack say, "Me, Mama-san, could we spend the night here?

30
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Because we’re far from home, we’re very tired."

31
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And the old lady said, "Oh yes, come on in."

32
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It was come dark and rain, will make you weary and tired.

33
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Applause)

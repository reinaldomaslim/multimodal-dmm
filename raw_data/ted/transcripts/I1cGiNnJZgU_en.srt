1
0:00:12.798,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So have you ever wondered what it would be like

2
0:00:15.924,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to live in a place with no rules?

3
0:00:19.653,000 --> 0:00:2,000
That sounds pretty cool.

4
0:00:20.828,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:21.89,000 --> 0:00:22,000
You wake up one morning, however,

6
0:00:23.551,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and you discover that the reason there are no rules

7
0:00:26.055,000 --> 0:00:29,000
is because there's no government, and there are no laws.

8
0:00:29.44,000 --> 0:00:33,000
In fact, all social institutions have disappeared.

9
0:00:34.738,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So there's no schools,

10
0:00:36.095,000 --> 0:00:37,000
there's no hospitals,

11
0:00:37.285,000 --> 0:00:38,000
there's no police,

12
0:00:38.617,000 --> 0:00:39,000
there's no banks,

13
0:00:39.976,000 --> 0:00:41,000
there's no athletic clubs,

14
0:00:42.554,000 --> 0:00:43,000
there's no utilities.

15
0:00:44.704,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Well, I know a little bit about what this is like,

16
0:00:47.92,000 --> 0:00:49,000
because when I was a medical student in 1999,

17
0:00:50.793,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I worked in a refugee camp in the Balkans during the Kosovo War.

18
0:00:56.829,000 --> 0:00:57,000
When the war was over,

19
0:00:58.003,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I got permission -- unbelievably -- from my medical school

20
0:01:01.085,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to take some time off

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and follow some of the families that I had befriended in the camp

22
0:01:06.455,000 --> 0:01:08,000
back to their village in Kosovo,

23
0:01:08.902,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and understand how they navigated life in this postwar setting.

24
0:01:16.331,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Postwar Kosovo was a very interesting place

25
0:01:19.575,000 --> 0:01:22,000
because NATO troops were there,

26
0:01:22.768,000 --> 0:01:25,000
mostly to make sure the war didn't break out again.

27
0:01:26.428,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But other than that, it was actually a lawless place,

28
0:01:29.945,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and almost every social institution, both public and private,

29
0:01:33.234,000 --> 0:01:34,000
had been destroyed.

30
0:01:35.439,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So I can tell you

31
0:01:39.352,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that when you go into one of these situations and settings,

32
0:01:43.891,000 --> 0:01:46,000
it is absolutely thrilling ...

33
0:01:47.722,000 --> 0:01:48,000
for about 30 minutes,

34
0:01:49.098,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because that's about how long it takes before you run into a situation

35
0:01:53.794,000 --> 0:01:57,000
where you realize how incredibly vulnerable you are.

36
0:01:59.54,000 --> 0:02:02,000
For me, that moment came when I had to cross the first checkpoint,

37
0:02:03.331,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and I realized as I drove up

38
0:02:05.148,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that I would be negotiating passage through this checkpoint

39
0:02:09.27,000 --> 0:02:11,000
with a heavily armed individual

40
0:02:11.508,000 --> 0:02:14,000
who, if he decided to shoot me right then and there,

41
0:02:14.918,000 --> 0:02:16,000
actually wouldn't be doing anything illegal.

42
0:02:18.811,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But the sense of vulnerability that I had was absolutely nothing

43
0:02:23.698,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in comparison to the vulnerability of the families that I got to know

44
0:02:27.62,000 --> 0:02:28,000
over that year.

45
0:02:29.304,000 --> 0:02:34,000
You see, life in a society where there are no social institutions

46
0:02:34.441,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is riddled with danger and uncertainty,

47
0:02:37.909,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and simple questions like, "What are we going to eat tonight?"

48
0:02:42.245,000 --> 0:02:44,000
are very complicated to answer.

49
0:02:46.559,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Questions about security, when you don't have any security systems,

50
0:02:50.933,000 --> 0:02:51,000
are terrifying.

51
0:02:52.375,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Is that altercation I had with the neighbor down the block

52
0:02:55.162,000 --> 0:02:57,000
going to turn into a violent episode that will end my life

53
0:02:58,000 --> 0:02:59,000
or my family's life?

54
0:02:59.843,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Health concerns when there is no health system

55
0:03:02.793,000 --> 0:03:03,000
are also terrifying.

56
0:03:05.114,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I listened as many families had to sort through questions like,

57
0:03:08.756,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"My infant has a fever. What am I going to do?"

58
0:03:12.243,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"My sister, who is pregnant, is bleeding. What should I do?

59
0:03:15.947,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Who should I turn to?"

60
0:03:17.145,000 --> 0:03:19,000
"Where are the doctors, where are the nurses?

61
0:03:19.299,000 --> 0:03:21,000
If I could find one, are they trustworthy?

62
0:03:22.084,000 --> 0:03:24,000
How will I pay them? In what currency will I pay them?"

63
0:03:24.841,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"If I need medications, where will I find them?

64
0:03:28.664,000 --> 0:03:3,000
If I take those medications, are they actually counterfeits?"

65
0:03:31.583,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And on and on.

66
0:03:34.765,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So for life in these settings,

67
0:03:37.161,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the dominant theme, the dominant feature of life,

68
0:03:41.665,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is the incredible vulnerability that people have to manage

69
0:03:45.632,000 --> 0:03:46,000
day in and day out,

70
0:03:47.205,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because of the lack of social systems.

71
0:03:50.063,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And it actually turns out

72
0:03:51.323,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that this feature of life is incredibly difficult to explain

73
0:03:55.374,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and be understood by people who are living outside of it.

74
0:03:59.041,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I discovered this when I left Kosovo.

75
0:04:03.701,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I came back to Boston, I became a physician,

76
0:04:06.93,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I became a global public health policy researcher.

77
0:04:10.965,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I joined the Harvard Medical School

78
0:04:12.779,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and Brigham and Women's Hospital Division of Global Health.

79
0:04:15.645,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And I, as a researcher,

80
0:04:16.903,000 --> 0:04:18,000
really wanted to get started on this problem right away.

81
0:04:19.581,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I was like, "How do we reduce the crushing vulnerability

82
0:04:23.173,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of people living in these types of fragile settings?

83
0:04:26.968,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Is there any way we can start to think about

84
0:04:29.461,000 --> 0:04:31,000
how to protect and quickly recover

85
0:04:32.19,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the institutions that are critical to survival,

86
0:04:35.023,000 --> 0:04:36,000
like the health system?"

87
0:04:36.56,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And I have to say, I had amazing colleagues.

88
0:04:40.402,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But one interesting thing about it was,

89
0:04:42.312,000 --> 0:04:44,000
this was sort of an unusual question for them.

90
0:04:44.82,000 --> 0:04:46,000
They were kind of like, "Oh, if you work in war,

91
0:04:47.153,000 --> 0:04:49,000
doesn't that mean you work on refugee camps,

92
0:04:49.426,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and you work on documenting mass atrocities?" --

93
0:04:51.882,000 --> 0:04:53,000
which is, by the way, very, very, very important.

94
0:04:55.297,000 --> 0:05:,000
So it took me a while to explain why I was so passionate about this issue,

95
0:05:00.475,000 --> 0:05:01,000
until about six years ago.

96
0:05:02.19,000 --> 0:05:04,000
That's when this landmark study

97
0:05:04.279,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that looked at and described the public health consequences of war

98
0:05:08.412,000 --> 0:05:09,000
was published.

99
0:05:09.778,000 --> 0:05:13,000
They came to an incredible, provocative conclusion.

100
0:05:15.671,000 --> 0:05:17,000
These researchers concluded

101
0:05:18.344,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that the vast majority of death and disability from war

102
0:05:21.842,000 --> 0:05:23,000
happens after the cessation of conflict.

103
0:05:24.499,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So the most dangerous time to be a person living in a conflict-affected state

104
0:05:29.561,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is after the cessation of hostilities;

105
0:05:31.628,000 --> 0:05:33,000
it's after the peace deal has been signed.

106
0:05:33.653,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It's when that political solution has been achieved.

107
0:05:36.238,000 --> 0:05:39,000
That seems so puzzling, but of course it's not,

108
0:05:39.796,000 --> 0:05:44,000
because war kills people by robbing them of their clinics,

109
0:05:45.625,000 --> 0:05:46,000
of their hospitals,

110
0:05:46.826,000 --> 0:05:47,000
of their supply chains.

111
0:05:48.714,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Their doctors are targeted, are killed; they're on the run.

112
0:05:52.329,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And more invisible and yet more deadly is the destruction

113
0:05:56.272,000 --> 0:05:59,000
of the health governance institutions and their finances.

114
0:06:00.938,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So this is really not surprising at all to me.

115
0:06:05.61,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But what is surprising and somewhat dismaying,

116
0:06:08.184,000 --> 0:06:11,000
is how little impact this insight has had,

117
0:06:12.182,000 --> 0:06:15,000
in terms of how we think about human suffering and war.

118
0:06:16.499,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Let me give you a couple examples.

119
0:06:18.926,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Last year, you may remember,

120
0:06:20.861,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Ebola hit the West African country of Liberia.

121
0:06:25.981,000 --> 0:06:28,000
There was a lot of reporting about this group, Doctors Without Borders,

122
0:06:29.873,000 --> 0:06:31,000
sounding the alarm and calling for aid and assistance.

123
0:06:33.322,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But not a lot of that reporting answered the question:

124
0:06:37.208,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Why is Doctors Without Borders even in Liberia?

125
0:06:39.784,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Doctors Without Borders is an amazing organization,

126
0:06:42.484,000 --> 0:06:46,000
dedicated and designed to provide emergency care in war zones.

127
0:06:47.461,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Liberia's civil war had ended in 2003 --

128
0:06:50.302,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that was 11 years before Ebola even struck.

129
0:06:54.452,000 --> 0:06:55,000
When Ebola struck Liberia,

130
0:06:56.196,000 --> 0:06:59,000
there were less than 50 doctors in the entire country

131
0:06:59.847,000 --> 0:07:,000
of 4.5 million people.

132
0:07:02.529,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Doctors Without Borders is in Liberia

133
0:07:04.737,000 --> 0:07:07,000
because Liberia still doesn't really have a functioning health system,

134
0:07:08.142,000 --> 0:07:09,000
11 years later.

135
0:07:09.833,000 --> 0:07:12,000
When the earthquake hit Haiti in 2010,

136
0:07:13.169,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the outpouring of international aid was phenomenal.

137
0:07:16.726,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But did you know that only two percent of that funding

138
0:07:20.421,000 --> 0:07:22,000
went to rebuild Haitian public institutions,

139
0:07:23.287,000 --> 0:07:24,000
including its health sector?

140
0:07:25.697,000 --> 0:07:26,000
From that perspective,

141
0:07:27.138,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Haitians continue to die from the earthquake even today.

142
0:07:31.663,000 --> 0:07:33,000
I recently met this gentleman.

143
0:07:33.764,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This is Dr. Nezar Ismet.

144
0:07:35.866,000 --> 0:07:38,000
He's the Minister of Health in the northern autonomous region of Iraq,

145
0:07:39.726,000 --> 0:07:4,000
in Kurdistan.

146
0:07:41.181,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Here he is announcing that in the last nine months,

147
0:07:45.087,000 --> 0:07:49,000
his country, his region, has increased from four million people

148
0:07:49.153,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to five million people.

149
0:07:50.709,000 --> 0:07:51,000
That's a 25 percent increase.

150
0:07:52.601,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Thousands of these new arrivals have experienced incredible trauma.

151
0:07:56.979,000 --> 0:08:,000
His doctors are working 16-hour days without pay.

152
0:08:02.867,000 --> 0:08:04,000
His budget has not increased by 25 percent;

153
0:08:05.714,000 --> 0:08:07,000
it has decreased by 20 percent,

154
0:08:08.133,000 --> 0:08:12,000
as funding has flowed to security concerns and to short-term relief efforts.

155
0:08:13.569,000 --> 0:08:14,000
When his health sector fails --

156
0:08:15.197,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and if history is any guide, it will --

157
0:08:17.634,000 --> 0:08:19,000
how do you think that's going to influence

158
0:08:19.704,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the decision making of the five million people in his region

159
0:08:22.96,000 --> 0:08:24,000
as they think about whether they should flee

160
0:08:25.803,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that type of vulnerable living situation?

161
0:08:29.55,000 --> 0:08:31,000
So as you can see, this is a frustrating topic for me,

162
0:08:32.508,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and I really try to understand:

163
0:08:34.034,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Why the reluctance to protect and support

164
0:08:37.582,000 --> 0:08:4,000
indigenous health systems and security systems?

165
0:08:41.242,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I usually tier two concerns, two arguments.

166
0:08:44.747,000 --> 0:08:46,000
The first concern is about corruption,

167
0:08:46.958,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and the concern that people in these settings are corrupt

168
0:08:49.701,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and they are untrustworthy.

169
0:08:52.076,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And I will admit that I have met unsavory characters

170
0:08:55.161,000 --> 0:08:57,000
working in health sectors in these situations.

171
0:08:57.541,000 --> 0:09:,000
But I will tell you that the opposite is absolutely true

172
0:09:01.265,000 --> 0:09:03,000
in every case I have worked on,

173
0:09:03.319,000 --> 0:09:06,000
from Afghanistan to Libya, to Kosovo, to Haiti, to Liberia --

174
0:09:07.156,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I have met inspiring people,

175
0:09:09.279,000 --> 0:09:11,000
who, when the chips were down for their country,

176
0:09:11.798,000 --> 0:09:14,000
they risked everything to save their health institutions.

177
0:09:15.131,000 --> 0:09:18,000
The trick for the outsider who wants to help

178
0:09:18.503,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is identifying who those individuals are,

179
0:09:21.431,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and building a pathway for them to lead.

180
0:09:23.763,000 --> 0:09:26,000
That is exactly what happened in Afghanistan.

181
0:09:27.534,000 --> 0:09:3,000
One of the unsung and untold success stories

182
0:09:30.887,000 --> 0:09:32,000
of our nation-building effort in Afghanistan

183
0:09:33.829,000 --> 0:09:36,000
involved the World Bank in 2002 investing heavily

184
0:09:37.349,000 --> 0:09:42,000
in identifying, training and promoting Afghani health sector leaders.

185
0:09:43.869,000 --> 0:09:46,000
These health sector leaders have pulled off an incredible feat

186
0:09:47.746,000 --> 0:09:48,000
in Afghanistan.

187
0:09:49.142,000 --> 0:09:52,000
They have aggressively increased access to health care

188
0:09:53.113,000 --> 0:09:55,000
for the majority of the population.

189
0:09:55.153,000 --> 0:09:57,000
They are rapidly improving the health status

190
0:09:57.381,000 --> 0:09:58,000
of the Afghan population,

191
0:09:58.676,000 --> 0:09:59,000
which used to be the worst in the world.

192
0:10:01.765,000 --> 0:10:03,000
In fact, the Afghan Ministry of Health does things

193
0:10:04.611,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that I wish we would do in America.

194
0:10:06.331,000 --> 0:10:08,000
They use things like data to make policy.

195
0:10:08.727,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It's incredible.

196
0:10:09.936,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Laughter)

197
0:10:12.352,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The other concern I hear a lot about is:

198
0:10:14.305,000 --> 0:10:16,000
"We just can't afford it, we just don't have the money.

199
0:10:16.931,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It's just unsustainable."

200
0:10:19.239,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I would submit to you that the current situation

201
0:10:21.996,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and the current system we have

202
0:10:23.755,000 --> 0:10:27,000
is the most expensive, inefficient system we could possibly conceive of.

203
0:10:27.817,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The current situation is that when governments like the US --

204
0:10:31.219,000 --> 0:10:33,000
or, let's say, the collection of governments

205
0:10:33.307,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that make up the European Commission --

206
0:10:35.205,000 --> 0:10:37,000
every year, they spend 15 billion dollars

207
0:10:37.878,000 --> 0:10:41,000
on just humanitarian and emergency and disaster relief worldwide.

208
0:10:41.908,000 --> 0:10:44,000
That's nothing about foreign aid, that's just disaster relief.

209
0:10:45.895,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Ninety-five percent of it goes to international relief agencies,

210
0:10:50.964,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that then have to import resources into these areas,

211
0:10:55.325,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and knit together some type of temporary health system, let's say,

212
0:10:59.738,000 --> 0:11:02,000
which they then dismantle and send away when they run out of money.

213
0:11:04.001,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So our job, it turns out, is very clear.

214
0:11:09.001,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We, as the global health community policy experts,

215
0:11:13.8,000 --> 0:11:18,000
our first job is to become experts in how to monitor

216
0:11:19.369,000 --> 0:11:21,000
the strengths and vulnerabilities of health systems

217
0:11:21.84,000 --> 0:11:23,000
in threatened situations.

218
0:11:24.431,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And that's when we see doctors fleeing,

219
0:11:26.465,000 --> 0:11:27,000
when we see health resources drying up,

220
0:11:28.426,000 --> 0:11:3,000
when we see institutions crumbling --

221
0:11:30.885,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that's the emergency.

222
0:11:32.522,000 --> 0:11:35,000
That's when we need to sound the alarm and wave our arms.

223
0:11:35.656,000 --> 0:11:36,000
OK?

224
0:11:37.074,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Not now.

225
0:11:38.249,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Everyone can see that's an emergency, they don't need us to tell them that.

226
0:11:42.942,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Number two:

227
0:11:44.905,000 --> 0:11:47,000
places like where I work at Harvard need to take their cue

228
0:11:48.266,000 --> 0:11:5,000
from the World Bank experience in Afghanistan,

229
0:11:50.488,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and we need to -- and we will --

230
0:11:52.169,000 --> 0:11:57,000
build robust platforms to support health sector leaders like these.

231
0:11:58.291,000 --> 0:11:59,000
These people risk their lives.

232
0:12:00.017,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I think we can match their courage with some support.

233
0:12:04.245,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Number three:

234
0:12:05.423,000 --> 0:12:07,000
we need to reach out and make new partnerships.

235
0:12:08.025,000 --> 0:12:09,000
At our global health center,

236
0:12:09.923,000 --> 0:12:13,000
we have launched a new initiative with NATO and other security policy makers

237
0:12:13.959,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to explore with them what they can do to protect health system institutions

238
0:12:19.349,000 --> 0:12:2,000
during deployments.

239
0:12:21.088,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We want them to see

240
0:12:22.652,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that protecting health systems and other critical social institutions

241
0:12:27.376,000 --> 0:12:29,000
is an integral part of their mission.

242
0:12:29.843,000 --> 0:12:32,000
It's not just about avoiding collateral damage;

243
0:12:33.004,000 --> 0:12:34,000
it's about winning the peace.

244
0:12:36.545,000 --> 0:12:39,000
But the most important partner we need to engage is you,

245
0:12:40.152,000 --> 0:12:43,000
the American public, and indeed, the world public.

246
0:12:43.608,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Because unless you understand the value of social institutions,

247
0:12:49.328,000 --> 0:12:51,000
like health systems in these fragile settings,

248
0:12:52.886,000 --> 0:12:54,000
you won't support efforts to save them.

249
0:12:55.158,000 --> 0:12:57,000
You won't click on that article

250
0:12:57.58,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that talks about "Hey, all those doctors are on the run in country X.

251
0:13:02.57,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I wonder what that means.

252
0:13:05.011,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I wonder what that means

253
0:13:06.887,000 --> 0:13:09,000
for that health system's ability to, let's say, detect influenza."

254
0:13:11.673,000 --> 0:13:14,000
"Hmm, it's probably not good." That's what I'd tell you.

255
0:13:15.59,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Up on the screen,

256
0:13:16.778,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I've put up my three favorite American institution defenders and builders.

257
0:13:23.666,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Over here is George C. Marshall,

258
0:13:26.575,000 --> 0:13:28,000
he was the guy that proposed the Marshall Plan

259
0:13:29.428,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to save all of Europe's economic institutions after World War II.

260
0:13:34.119,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And this Eleanor Roosevelt.

261
0:13:36.496,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Her work on human rights really serves as the foundation

262
0:13:39.666,000 --> 0:13:42,000
for all of our international human rights organizations.

263
0:13:43.15,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Then my big favorite is Ben Franklin,

264
0:13:45.214,000 --> 0:13:48,000
who did many things in terms of creating institutions,

265
0:13:48.446,000 --> 0:13:5,000
but was the midwife of our constitution.

266
0:13:52.402,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And I would say to you

267
0:13:54.15,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that these are folks who, when our country was threatened,

268
0:13:57.927,000 --> 0:13:59,000
or our world was threatened,

269
0:13:59.958,000 --> 0:14:,000
they didn't retreat.

270
0:14:01.285,000 --> 0:14:03,000
They didn't talk about building walls.

271
0:14:03.65,000 --> 0:14:08,000
They talked about building institutions to protect human security,

272
0:14:09.828,000 --> 0:14:11,000
for their generation and also for ours.

273
0:14:13.014,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And I think our generation should do the same.

274
0:14:16.503,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Thank you.

275
0:14:17.687,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.52,000 --> 0:00:14,000
In case you are wondering,

2
0:00:15.28,000 --> 0:00:17,000
no, I'm not wearing a dress,

3
0:00:18.84,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and no, I'm not saying what I'm wearing underneath.

4
0:00:22.48,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:25.32,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This is a gho.

6
0:00:27.92,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This is my national dress.

7
0:00:30.2,000 --> 0:00:32,000
This is how all men dress in Bhutan.

8
0:00:34.52,000 --> 0:00:36,000
That is how our women dress.

9
0:00:38.32,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Like our women,

10
0:00:40.52,000 --> 0:00:43,000
we men get to wear pretty bright colors,

11
0:00:44.96,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but unlike our women,

12
0:00:47.24,000 --> 0:00:48,000
we get to show off our legs.

13
0:00:48.84,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:50.88,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Our national dress is unique,

15
0:00:52.32,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but this is not the only thing that's unique about my country.

16
0:00:56.04,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Our promise to remain carbon neutral is also unique,

17
0:00:59.2,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and this is what I'd like to speak about today,

18
0:01:01.44,000 --> 0:01:03,000
our promise to remain carbon neutral.

19
0:01:04.72,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But before I proceed, I should set you the context.

20
0:01:08.68,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I should tell you our story.

21
0:01:11.44,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Bhutan is a small country in the Himalayas.

22
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We've been called Shangri-La,

23
0:01:18.32,000 --> 0:01:19,000
even the last Shangri-La.

24
0:01:21.04,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But let me tell you right off the bat, we are not Shangri-La.

25
0:01:24.48,000 --> 0:01:26,000
My country is not one big monastery

26
0:01:27.24,000 --> 0:01:28,000
populated with happy monks.

27
0:01:28.92,000 --> 0:01:29,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:30.6,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The reality is that there are barely 700,000 of us

29
0:01:36.32,000 --> 0:01:4,000
sandwiched between two of the most populated countries on earth,

30
0:01:41.28,000 --> 0:01:43,000
China and India.

31
0:01:44.76,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The reality is that we are a small, underdeveloped country

32
0:01:48.56,000 --> 0:01:49,000
doing our best to survive.

33
0:01:51.6,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But we are doing OK. We are surviving.

34
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:57,000
In fact, we are thriving,

35
0:01:58.32,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and the reason we are thriving is because we've been blessed

36
0:02:02.8,000 --> 0:02:04,000
with extraordinary kings.

37
0:02:05.12,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Our enlightened monarchs have worked tirelessly

38
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to develop our country,

39
0:02:10.04,000 --> 0:02:13,000
balancing economic growth carefully

40
0:02:13.64,000 --> 0:02:15,000
with social development, environmental sustainability

41
0:02:16.56,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and cultural preservation,

42
0:02:18.44,000 --> 0:02:2,000
all within the framework of good governance.

43
0:02:22.199,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We call this holistic approach to development

44
0:02:25.08,000 --> 0:02:27,000
"Gross National Happiness," or GNH.

45
0:02:29.44,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Back in the 1970s,

46
0:02:31.48,000 --> 0:02:34,000
our fourth king famously pronounced that for Bhutan,

47
0:02:35.04,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross National Product.

48
0:02:39.6,000 --> 0:02:42,000
(Applause)

49
0:02:44.4,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Ever since,

50
0:02:46.32,000 --> 0:02:49,000
all development in Bhutan is driven by GNH,

51
0:02:51.08,000 --> 0:02:54,000
a pioneering vision that aims to improve the happiness

52
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and well-being of our people.

53
0:02:58.76,000 --> 0:03:,000
But that's easier said than done,

54
0:03:00.96,000 --> 0:03:03,000
especially when you are one of the smallest economies in the world.

55
0:03:05.36,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Our entire GDP is less than two billion dollars.

56
0:03:09.92,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I know that some of you here are worth more --

57
0:03:12.44,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:13.72,000 --> 0:03:14,000
individually

59
0:03:15.28,000 --> 0:03:17,000
than the entire economy of my country.

60
0:03:20.64,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So our economy is small,

61
0:03:22.88,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but here is where it gets interesting.

62
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Education is completely free.

63
0:03:28.36,000 --> 0:03:31,000
All citizens are guaranteed free school education,

64
0:03:31.44,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and those that work hard are given free college education.

65
0:03:34.44,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Healthcare is also completely free.

66
0:03:36.92,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Medical consultation, medical treatment, medicines:

67
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:41,000
they are all provided by the state.

68
0:03:43.44,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We manage this

69
0:03:45.56,000 --> 0:03:48,000
because we use our limited resources very carefully,

70
0:03:49.6,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and because we stay faithful to the core mission of GNH,

71
0:03:55.28,000 --> 0:03:57,000
which is development with values.

72
0:03:59.6,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Our economy is small, and we must strengthen it.

73
0:04:02.52,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Economic growth is important,

74
0:04:04.72,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but that economic growth must not come from undermining our unique culture

75
0:04:09.88,000 --> 0:04:12,000
or our pristine environment.

76
0:04:14.68,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Today, our culture is flourishing.

77
0:04:17.08,000 --> 0:04:2,000
We continue to celebrate our art and architecture,

78
0:04:20.8,000 --> 0:04:21,000
food and festivals,

79
0:04:23.88,000 --> 0:04:25,000
monks and monasteries.

80
0:04:26.76,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And yes, we celebrate our national dress, too.

81
0:04:32.48,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This is why I can wear my gho with pride.

82
0:04:37.2,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Here's a fun fact:

83
0:04:39.52,000 --> 0:04:41,000
you're looking at the world's biggest pocket.

84
0:04:42.76,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:45.12,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It starts here,

86
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
goes around the back,

87
0:04:49.36,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and comes out from inside here.

88
0:04:52.4,000 --> 0:04:53,000
In this pocket

89
0:04:53.92,000 --> 0:04:56,000
we store all manner of personal goods

90
0:04:56.96,000 --> 0:04:57,000
from phones and wallets

91
0:05:00.28,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to iPads, office files and books.

92
0:05:03.32,000 --> 0:05:04,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:04.56,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Applause)

94
0:05:06.28,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But sometimes --

95
0:05:08.84,000 --> 0:05:11,000
sometimes even precious cargo.

96
0:05:14.2,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So our culture is flourishing,

97
0:05:16.56,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but so is our environment.

98
0:05:19.04,000 --> 0:05:22,000
72 percent of my country is under forest cover.

99
0:05:23.44,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Our constitution demands that a minimum of 60 percent

100
0:05:28.44,000 --> 0:05:31,000
of Bhutan's total land shall remain under forest cover

101
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
for all time.

102
0:05:33.4,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Applause)

103
0:05:39.08,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Our constitution,

104
0:05:41.24,000 --> 0:05:42,000
this constitution,

105
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
imposes forest cover on us.

106
0:05:47.88,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Incidentally, our king used this constitution

107
0:05:52.12,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to impose democracy on us.

108
0:05:54.64,000 --> 0:05:57,000
You see, we the people didn't want democracy.

109
0:05:57.84,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We didn't ask for it, we didn't demand it,

110
0:06:00.84,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and we certainly didn't fight for it.

111
0:06:03.28,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Instead, our king imposed democracy on us

112
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
by insisting that he include it in the constitution.

113
0:06:12.52,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But he went further.

114
0:06:14.48,000 --> 0:06:16,000
He included provisions in the constitution

115
0:06:18.32,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that empower the people to impeach their kings,

116
0:06:22.08,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and included provisions in here that require all our kings to retire

117
0:06:27.64,000 --> 0:06:28,000
at the age of 65.

118
0:06:30.44,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Applause)

119
0:06:31.92,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Fact is, we already have a king in retirement:

120
0:06:36.84,000 --> 0:06:39,000
our previous king, the Great Fourth,

121
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
retired 10 years ago

122
0:06:42.64,000 --> 0:06:44,000
at the peak of his popularity.

123
0:06:45.72,000 --> 0:06:48,000
He was all of 51 years at that time.

124
0:06:51.08,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So as I was saying,

125
0:06:53.48,000 --> 0:06:56,000
72 percent of our country is under forest cover,

126
0:06:56.92,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and all that forest is pristine.

127
0:06:59.72,000 --> 0:07:01,000
That's why we are one of the few remaining

128
0:07:02.12,000 --> 0:07:05,000
global biodiversity hotspots in the world,

129
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and that's why we are a carbon neutral country.

130
0:07:08.36,000 --> 0:07:1,000
In a world that is threatened with climate change,

131
0:07:10.72,000 --> 0:07:12,000
we are a carbon neutral country.

132
0:07:15.48,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Turns out, it's a big deal.

133
0:07:17.92,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Of the 200-odd countries in the world today,

134
0:07:20.32,000 --> 0:07:21,000
it looks like we are the only one

135
0:07:22.56,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that's carbon neutral.

136
0:07:25.52,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Actually, that's not quite accurate.

137
0:07:29.04,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Bhutan is not carbon neutral.

138
0:07:31.92,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Bhutan is carbon negative.

139
0:07:35.6,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Our entire country generates 2.2 million tons of carbon dioxide,

140
0:07:42.56,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but our forests, they sequester more than three times that amount,

141
0:07:47.72,000 --> 0:07:49,000
so we are a net carbon sink

142
0:07:49.88,000 --> 0:07:52,000
for more than four million tons of carbon dioxide each year.

143
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But that's not all.

144
0:07:56.44,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Applause)

145
0:07:58.56,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We export most of the renewable electricity

146
0:08:01.68,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we generate from our fast-flowing rivers.

147
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So today, the clean energy that we export

148
0:08:08.6,000 --> 0:08:13,000
offsets about six million tons of carbon dioxide in our neighborhood.

149
0:08:14.24,000 --> 0:08:17,000
By 2020, we'll be exporting enough electricity

150
0:08:18.2,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to offset 17 million tons of carbon dioxide.

151
0:08:22.68,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And if we were to harness even half our hydropower potential,

152
0:08:25.96,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and that's exactly what we are working at,

153
0:08:29.12,000 --> 0:08:31,000
the clean, green energy that we export

154
0:08:31.52,000 --> 0:08:36,000
would offset something like 50 million tons of carbon dioxide a year.

155
0:08:38.32,000 --> 0:08:43,000
That is more CO2 than what the entire city of New York generates in one year.

156
0:08:45.159,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So inside our country, we are a net carbon sink.

157
0:08:48.28,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Outside, we are offsetting carbon.

158
0:08:50.84,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And this is important stuff.

159
0:08:53.24,000 --> 0:08:54,000
You see, the world is getting warmer,

160
0:08:55.84,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and climate change is a reality.

161
0:08:59.44,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Climate change is affecting my country.

162
0:09:02.28,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Our glaciers are melting,

163
0:09:04.36,000 --> 0:09:06,000
causing flash floods and landslides,

164
0:09:06.88,000 --> 0:09:1,000
which in turn are causing disaster and widespread destruction in our country.

165
0:09:13.56,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I was at that lake recently.

166
0:09:15.76,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It's stunning.

167
0:09:18.24,000 --> 0:09:2,000
That's how it looked 10 years ago,

168
0:09:21.24,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and that's how it looked 20 years ago.

169
0:09:24.32,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Just 20 years ago, that lake didn't exist.

170
0:09:27.88,000 --> 0:09:28,000
It was a solid glacier.

171
0:09:31.52,000 --> 0:09:33,000
A few years ago, a similar lake

172
0:09:34.76,000 --> 0:09:35,000
breached its dams

173
0:09:37.92,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and wreaked havoc in the valleys below.

174
0:09:42.36,000 --> 0:09:45,000
That destruction was caused by one glacier lake.

175
0:09:45.4,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We have 2,700 of them to contend with.

176
0:09:50.64,000 --> 0:09:51,000
The point is this:

177
0:09:52.8,000 --> 0:09:55,000
my country and my people have done nothing

178
0:09:56.64,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to contribute to global warming,

179
0:09:59.92,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but we are already bearing the brunt of its consequences.

180
0:10:05.64,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And for a small, poor country, one that is landlocked and mountainous,

181
0:10:09.6,000 --> 0:10:1,000
it is very difficult.

182
0:10:12.32,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But we are not going to sit on our hands doing nothing.

183
0:10:14.96,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We will fight climate change.

184
0:10:16.92,000 --> 0:10:19,000
That's why we have promised to remain carbon neutral.

185
0:10:22.48,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We first made this promise in 2009

186
0:10:26.84,000 --> 0:10:28,000
during COP 15 in Copenhagen,

187
0:10:30.8,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but nobody noticed.

188
0:10:32.96,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Governments were so busy arguing with one another

189
0:10:35.64,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and blaming each other for causing climate change,

190
0:10:38.6,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that when a small country raised our hands and announced,

191
0:10:42.28,000 --> 0:10:45,000
"We promise to remain carbon neutral for all time,"

192
0:10:45.4,000 --> 0:10:46,000
nobody heard us.

193
0:10:47.88,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Nobody cared.

194
0:10:51.4,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Last December in Paris,

195
0:10:54.48,000 --> 0:10:57,000
at COP 21, we reiterated our promise

196
0:10:57.76,000 --> 0:10:59,000
to remain carbon neutral for all time to come.

197
0:11:01.76,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This time, we were heard.

198
0:11:03.88,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We were noticed, and everybody cared.

199
0:11:09.2,000 --> 0:11:13,000
What was different in Paris was that governments came round together

200
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to accept the realities of climate change,

201
0:11:16.8,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and were willing to come together and act together and work together.

202
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
All countries, from the very small to the very large,

203
0:11:25.44,000 --> 0:11:28,000
committed to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions.

204
0:11:30.68,000 --> 0:11:33,000
The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change

205
0:11:33.8,000 --> 0:11:37,000
says that if these so-called intended commitments are kept,

206
0:11:39.4,000 --> 0:11:41,000
we'd be closer to containing global warming

207
0:11:41.64,000 --> 0:11:42,000
by two degrees Celsius.

208
0:11:46.44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
By the way,

209
0:11:48.64,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I've requested the TED organizers here

210
0:11:51.4,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to turn up the heat in here by two degrees,

211
0:11:56.52,000 --> 0:11:58,000
so if some of you are feeling warmer than usual,

212
0:11:59.36,000 --> 0:12:,000
you know who to blame.

213
0:12:03.52,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It's crucial that all of us keep our commitments.

214
0:12:07.6,000 --> 0:12:08,000
As far as Bhutan is concerned,

215
0:12:09.08,000 --> 0:12:12,000
we will keep our promise to remain carbon neutral.

216
0:12:13.56,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Here are some of the ways we are doing it.

217
0:12:16.76,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We are providing free electricity to our rural farmers.

218
0:12:20.24,000 --> 0:12:26,000
The idea is that, with free electricity, they will no longer have to use firewood

219
0:12:26.56,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to cook their food.

220
0:12:28.52,000 --> 0:12:3,000
We are investing in sustainable transport

221
0:12:31.36,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and subsidizing the purchase of electric vehicles.

222
0:12:34.84,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Similarly, we are subsidizing the cost of LED lights,

223
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and our entire government is trying to go paperless.

224
0:12:43.32,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We are cleaning up our entire country through Clean Bhutan, a national program,

225
0:12:47.84,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and we are planting trees throughout our country

226
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:52,000
through Green Bhutan,

227
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
another national program.

228
0:12:56.32,000 --> 0:12:58,000
But it is our protected areas

229
0:12:58.52,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that are at the core of our carbon neutral strategy.

230
0:13:02.32,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Our protected areas are our carbon sink.

231
0:13:05.56,000 --> 0:13:06,000
They are our lungs.

232
0:13:08.88,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Today, more than half our country is protected,

233
0:13:12.4,000 --> 0:13:14,000
as national parks, nature reserves

234
0:13:14.8,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and wildlife sanctuaries.

235
0:13:17.4,000 --> 0:13:21,000
But the beauty is that we've connected them all with one another

236
0:13:21.52,000 --> 0:13:23,000
through a network of biological corridors.

237
0:13:26.12,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Now, what this means

238
0:13:27.4,000 --> 0:13:3,000
is that our animals are free to roam throughout our country.

239
0:13:33.76,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Take this tiger, for example.

240
0:13:35.2,000 --> 0:13:38,000
It was spotted at 250 meters above sea level

241
0:13:38.92,000 --> 0:13:4,000
in the hot, subtropical jungles.

242
0:13:42.04,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Two years later, that same tiger

243
0:13:45.04,000 --> 0:13:48,000
was spotted near 4,000 meters

244
0:13:48.56,000 --> 0:13:5,000
in our cold alpine mountains.

245
0:13:51.84,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Isn't that awesome?

246
0:13:53.72,000 --> 0:13:57,000
(Applause)

247
0:13:57.8,000 --> 0:13:58,000
We must keep it that way.

248
0:14:00.48,000 --> 0:14:02,000
We must keep our parks awesome.

249
0:14:03.84,000 --> 0:14:07,000
So every year, we set aside resources to prevent poaching, hunting,

250
0:14:08.56,000 --> 0:14:1,000
mining and pollution in our parks,

251
0:14:10.96,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and resources to help communities who live in those parks

252
0:14:16.12,000 --> 0:14:17,000
manage their forests,

253
0:14:17.64,000 --> 0:14:18,000
adapt to climate change,

254
0:14:19.12,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and lead better lives while continuing to live in harmony with Mother Nature.

255
0:14:24.6,000 --> 0:14:25,000
But that is expensive.

256
0:14:26.64,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Over the next few years, our small economy won't have the resources

257
0:14:32.4,000 --> 0:14:35,000
to cover all the costs that are required to protect our environment.

258
0:14:37.56,000 --> 0:14:38,000
In fact, when we run the numbers,

259
0:14:39.2,000 --> 0:14:41,000
it looks like it'll take us at least 15 years

260
0:14:41.92,000 --> 0:14:45,000
before we can fully finance all our conservation efforts.

261
0:14:47.28,000 --> 0:14:48,000
But neither Bhutan,

262
0:14:49.72,000 --> 0:14:5,000
nor the world

263
0:14:51.48,000 --> 0:14:54,000
can afford to spend 15 years going backwards.

264
0:14:56.6,000 --> 0:14:58,000
This is why His Majesty the King

265
0:14:59.72,000 --> 0:15:,000
started Bhutan For Life.

266
0:15:02.32,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Bhutan For Life gives us the time we need.

267
0:15:04.92,000 --> 0:15:05,000
It gives us breathing room.

268
0:15:07.12,000 --> 0:15:09,000
It is essentially a funding mechanism

269
0:15:09.52,000 --> 0:15:1,000
to look after our parks,

270
0:15:11.48,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to protect our parks,

271
0:15:13.68,000 --> 0:15:15,000
until our government can take over on our own fully.

272
0:15:17.72,000 --> 0:15:2,000
The idea is to raise a transition fund

273
0:15:21.52,000 --> 0:15:24,000
from individual donors, corporations and institutions,

274
0:15:25.84,000 --> 0:15:29,000
but the deal is closed only after predetermined conditions are met

275
0:15:30.4,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and all funds committed.

276
0:15:32.92,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So multiparty, single closing:

277
0:15:36.36,000 --> 0:15:38,000
an idea we borrowed from Wall Street.

278
0:15:39.68,000 --> 0:15:43,000
This means that individual donors can commit without having to worry

279
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:47,000
that they'll be left supporting an underfunded plan.

280
0:15:49.48,000 --> 0:15:51,000
It's something like a Kickstarter project,

281
0:15:51.76,000 --> 0:15:53,000
only with a 15-year time horizon

282
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and millions of tons of carbon dioxide at stake.

283
0:15:58.4,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Once the deal is closed,

284
0:16:01.32,000 --> 0:16:05,000
we use the transition fund to protect our parks,

285
0:16:05.4,000 --> 0:16:1,000
giving our government time to increase our own funding gradually

286
0:16:10.6,000 --> 0:16:12,000
until the end of the 15-year period.

287
0:16:12.64,000 --> 0:16:17,000
After that, our government guarantees full funding forever.

288
0:16:20.12,000 --> 0:16:21,000
We are almost there.

289
0:16:21.8,000 --> 0:16:22,000
We expect to close later this year.

290
0:16:24.64,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Naturally, I'm pretty excited.

291
0:16:26.36,000 --> 0:16:29,000
(Applause)

292
0:16:32.28,000 --> 0:16:38,000
The World Wildlife Fund is our principle partner in this journey,

293
0:16:38.96,000 --> 0:16:4,000
and I want to give them a big shoutout

294
0:16:41.04,000 --> 0:16:43,000
for the excellent work they are doing in Bhutan

295
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and across the world.

296
0:16:45.44,000 --> 0:16:48,000
(Applause)

297
0:16:49.04,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Whew, it is getting warm in here.

298
0:17:04.32,000 --> 0:17:06,000
I thank you for listening to our story,

299
0:17:07.12,000 --> 0:17:11,000
a story of how we are keeping our promise to remain carbon neutral,

300
0:17:11.68,000 --> 0:17:14,000
a story of how we are keeping our country pristine,

301
0:17:16.359,000 --> 0:17:17,000
for ourselves, our children,

302
0:17:18.76,000 --> 0:17:2,000
for your children and for the world.

303
0:17:22.56,000 --> 0:17:24,000
But we are not here to tell stories, are we?

304
0:17:25.64,000 --> 0:17:27,000
We are here to dream together.

305
0:17:29.319,000 --> 0:17:32,000
So in closing, I'd like to share one more dream that I have.

306
0:17:34.2,000 --> 0:17:37,000
What if we could mobilize our leadership and our resources,

307
0:17:37.839,000 --> 0:17:39,000
our influence and our passion,

308
0:17:40.52,000 --> 0:17:43,000
to replicate the Bhutan For Life idea to other countries

309
0:17:43.84,000 --> 0:17:44,000
so that they too

310
0:17:46.64,000 --> 0:17:48,000
can conserve their protected areas for all time.

311
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
After all, there are many other countries who face the same issues that we face.

312
0:17:53.946,000 --> 0:17:55,000
They too have natural resources

313
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
that can help win the world's fight for sustainability,

314
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
only they may not have the ability to invest in them now.

315
0:18:03.08,000 --> 0:18:05,000
So what if we set up Earth For Life,

316
0:18:06.12,000 --> 0:18:1,000
a global fund, to kickstart the Bhutan For Life throughout the world?

317
0:18:12.32,000 --> 0:18:13,000
I invite you to help me,

318
0:18:14.72,000 --> 0:18:16,000
to carry this dream beyond our borders

319
0:18:17.2,000 --> 0:18:21,000
to all those who care about our planet's future.

320
0:18:22.88,000 --> 0:18:25,000
After all, we're here to dream together,

321
0:18:27,000 --> 0:18:28,000
to work together,

322
0:18:28.8,000 --> 0:18:31,000
to fight climate change together, to protect our planet together.

323
0:18:33.08,000 --> 0:18:34,000
Because the reality is

324
0:18:36.28,000 --> 0:18:37,000
we are in it together.

325
0:18:38.72,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Some of us might dress differently,

326
0:18:41.52,000 --> 0:18:42,000
but we are in it together.

327
0:18:43.72,000 --> 0:18:44,000
Thank you very much,

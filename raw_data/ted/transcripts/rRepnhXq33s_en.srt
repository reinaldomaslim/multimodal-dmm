1
0:00:16.307,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Over the next five minutes,

2
0:00:17.65,000 --> 0:00:2,000
my intention is to transform your relationship with sound.

3
0:00:21.323,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Let me start with the observation

4
0:00:22.922,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that most of the sound around us is accidental;

5
0:00:25.164,000 --> 0:00:27,000
much of it is unpleasant. (Traffic noise)

6
0:00:27.302,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We stand on street corners, shouting over noise like this,

7
0:00:30.089,000 --> 0:00:31,000
pretending it doesn't exist.

8
0:00:31.489,000 --> 0:00:32,000
This habit of suppressing sound has meant

9
0:00:33.49,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious.

10
0:00:36.862,000 --> 0:00:38,000
There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time,

11
0:00:39.863,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and I'd like to raise them in your consciousness today.

12
0:00:42.482,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The first is physiological.

13
0:00:44.127,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Alarm clocks ring)

14
0:00:47.021,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Sorry about that.

15
0:00:48.201,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I just gave you a shot of cortisol, your fight-flight hormone.

16
0:00:51.148,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time,

17
0:00:53.926,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but also your breathing, heart rate -- which I just also did --

18
0:00:57.19,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and your brainwaves.

19
0:00:58.639,000 --> 0:01:,000
It's not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it.

20
0:01:01.166,000 --> 0:01:02,000
This is surf. (Ocean waves)

21
0:01:02.499,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute.

22
0:01:05.016,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Most people find that very soothing,

23
0:01:06.789,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and, interestingly, 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency

24
0:01:09.909,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of the breathing of a sleeping human,

25
0:01:11.712,000 --> 0:01:13,000
so there is a deep resonance with being at rest.

26
0:01:14.053,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We also associate it with being stress-free and on holiday.

27
0:01:17.382,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The second way in which sound affects you is psychological.

28
0:01:20.749,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Music is the most powerful form of sound that we know

29
0:01:23.258,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that affects our emotional state. (Albinoni's Adagio)

30
0:01:25.791,000 --> 0:01:28,000
This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on.

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Music is not the only kind of sound, however, which affects your emotions.

32
0:01:32.761,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Natural sound can do that, too.

33
0:01:34.619,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Birdsong, for example, is a sound which most people find reassuring.

34
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
There's a reason: over hundreds of thousands of years

35
0:01:40.795,000 --> 0:01:42,000
we've learned that when the birds are singing, things are safe.

36
0:01:43.788,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It's when they stop you need to be worried.

37
0:01:45.817,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively.

38
0:01:48.469,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You can't understand two people talking at once (Voice-over)

39
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
or in this case, one person talking twice.

40
0:01:53.399,000 --> 0:01:55,000
You have to choose which me you're going to listen to.

41
0:01:55.977,000 --> 0:01:58,000
We have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input,

42
0:01:59.365,000 --> 0:02:,000
which is why noise like this ...

43
0:02:00.949,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Office noise)

44
0:02:01.988,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is extremely damaging for productivity.

45
0:02:03.898,000 --> 0:02:05,000
If you have to work in an open-plan office like this,

46
0:02:06.431,000 --> 0:02:07,000
your productivity is greatly reduced.

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And whatever number you're thinking of, it probably isn't as bad as this.

48
0:02:11.761,000 --> 0:02:14,000
[Open-plan offices productivity down 66%]

49
0:02:15.334,000 --> 0:02:18,000
You are one-third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms.

50
0:02:18.975,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I have a tip for you:

51
0:02:20.15,000 --> 0:02:22,000
if you work in spaces like that, carry headphones with you,

52
0:02:22.959,000 --> 0:02:23,000
with a soothing sound like birdsong.

53
0:02:24.721,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Put them on, and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be.

54
0:02:28.329,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally.

55
0:02:31.583,000 --> 0:02:32,000
With all that other stuff going on,

56
0:02:33.292,000 --> 0:02:35,000
it would be amazing if our behavior didn't change.

57
0:02:35.679,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Techno music)

58
0:02:36.712,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So ask yourself: Is this person ever going to drive

59
0:02:39.155,000 --> 0:02:4,000
at a steady 28 miles per hour?

60
0:02:40.653,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I don't think so.

61
0:02:41.828,000 --> 0:02:43,000
At the simplest, you move away from unpleasant sound

62
0:02:44.761,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and towards pleasant sounds.

63
0:02:46.22,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So if I were to play this ...

64
0:02:47.681,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Jackhammer)

65
0:02:48.922,000 --> 0:02:5,000
for more than a few seconds, you'd feel uncomfortable;

66
0:02:51.518,000 --> 0:02:54,000
for more than a few minutes, you'd be leaving the room in droves.

67
0:02:54.607,000 --> 0:02:56,000
For people who can't get away from noise like that,

68
0:02:57.035,000 --> 0:02:58,000
it's extremely damaging for their health.

69
0:02:59.036,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And that's not the only thing that bad sound damages.

70
0:03:01.569,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental, even hostile,

71
0:03:04.888,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and it has a dramatic effect on sales.

72
0:03:07.012,000 --> 0:03:1,000
For you retailers, you may want to look away before I show this slide.

73
0:03:10.424,000 --> 0:03:12,000
[Inappropriate retail soundscapes sales down 28%]

74
0:03:12.78,000 --> 0:03:14,000
They're losing up to 30 percent of their business

75
0:03:15.209,000 --> 0:03:18,000
with people leaving shops faster, or just turning around at the door.

76
0:03:18.491,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We've all done it, left the area,

77
0:03:20.108,000 --> 0:03:22,000
because the sound in there is so dreadful.

78
0:03:22.142,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I want to spend just a moment talking about the model we've developed,

79
0:03:25.509,000 --> 0:03:28,000
which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound,

80
0:03:28.797,000 --> 0:03:29,000
analyze the soundscape

81
0:03:29.988,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and then predict the four outcomes I just talked about.

82
0:03:32.629,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Or start at the bottom and say what outcomes we want,

83
0:03:35.523,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect.

84
0:03:38.112,000 --> 0:03:4,000
At last we've got some science we can apply.

85
0:03:40.237,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And we're in the business of designing soundscapes.

86
0:03:42.672,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Just a word on music.

87
0:03:43.973,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Music is the most powerful sound there is, often inappropriately deployed.

88
0:03:47.644,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It's powerful for two reasons:

89
0:03:49.153,000 --> 0:03:52,000
you recognize it fast, and you associate it very powerfully.

90
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I'll give you two examples.

91
0:03:53.878,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(First chord of "A Hard Day's Night")

92
0:03:55.772,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Most of you recognize that immediately.

93
0:03:57.702,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The younger, maybe not.

94
0:03:58.877,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:00.109,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(First notes of "Jaws" theme)

96
0:04:01.529,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Most of you associate that with something!

97
0:04:03.636,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now, those are one-second samples of music.

98
0:04:05.785,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Music is very powerful,

99
0:04:06.961,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and unfortunately, it's veneering commercial spaces, often inappropriately.

100
0:04:10.847,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I hope that's going to change over the next few years.

101
0:04:13.777,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Let me talk about brands for a moment, since some of you run brands.

102
0:04:16.997,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Every brand is out there making sound right now.

103
0:04:19.285,000 --> 0:04:22,000
There are eight expressions of a brand in sound; they're all important.

104
0:04:22.666,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And every brand needs to have guidelines at the center.

105
0:04:25.31,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I'm glad to say that is starting to happen now.

106
0:04:27.593,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Intel ad jingle)

107
0:04:29.195,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You all recognize that one.

108
0:04:30.784,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Nokia ringtone)

109
0:04:31.815,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This is the most-played tune in the world today --

110
0:04:34.331,000 --> 0:04:36,000
1.8 billion times a day, that tune is played.

111
0:04:36.563,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

112
0:04:37.643,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing.

113
0:04:40.025,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I'll leave you with four golden rules, for those of you who run businesses,

114
0:04:43.601,000 --> 0:04:44,000
for commercial sound.

115
0:04:44.781,000 --> 0:04:45,000
First, make it congruent,

116
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
pointing in the same direction as your visual communication.

117
0:04:49.411,000 --> 0:04:51,000
That increases impact by over 1,100 percent.

118
0:04:52.069,000 --> 0:04:55,000
If your sound is pointing the opposite direction, incongruent,

119
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
you reduce impact by 86 percent.

120
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
That's an order of magnitude, up or down.

121
0:04:59.97,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is important.

122
0:05:01.478,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Secondly, make it appropriate to the situation.

123
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Thirdly, make it valuable.

124
0:05:05.541,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Give people something with the sound, don't just bombard them with stuff.

125
0:05:09.033,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Finally, test and test it again.

126
0:05:10.616,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Sound is complex; there are many countervailing influences.

127
0:05:13.424,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti:

128
0:05:15.425,000 --> 0:05:17,000
sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens.

129
0:05:18.081,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness.

130
0:05:20.894,000 --> 0:05:21,000
If you're listening consciously,

131
0:05:22.479,000 --> 0:05:24,000
you can take control of the sound around you.

132
0:05:24.615,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It's good for your health and for your productivity.

133
0:05:27.263,000 --> 0:05:28,000
If we all do that, we move to a state

134
0:05:29.08,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that I like to think will be sound living in the world.

135
0:05:31.689,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I'll leave you with more birdsong. (Birds chirping)

136
0:05:34.11,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I recommend at least five minutes a day, but there's no maximum dose.

137
0:05:37.419,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Thank you for lending me your ears today.

138
0:05:39.475,000 --> 0:05:41,000
(Applause)

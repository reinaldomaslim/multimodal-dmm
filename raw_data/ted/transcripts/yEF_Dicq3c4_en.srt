1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I think it'll be a relief to some people and a disappointment to others

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
that I'm not going to talk about vaginas today.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I began "The Vagina Monologues" because I was worried about vaginas.

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm very worried today about this notion, this world,

5
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
this prevailing kind of force of security.

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I see this word, hear this word, feel this word everywhere.

7
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Real security, security checks, security watch, security clearance.

8
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Why has all this focus on security made me feel so much more insecure?

9
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
What does anyone mean when they talk about real security?

10
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And why have we, as Americans particularly,

11
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
become a nation that strives for security above all else?

12
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
In fact, I think that security is elusive. It's impossible.

13
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We all die. We all get old. We all get sick. People leave us.

14
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
People change us. Nothing is secure.

15
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And that's actually the good news.

16
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
This is, of course, unless your whole life is about being secure.

17
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I think that when that is the focus of your life,

18
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
these are the things that happen.

19
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
You can't travel very far or venture too far outside a certain circle.

20
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You can't allow too many conflicting ideas into your mind at one time,

21
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
as they might confuse you or challenge you.

22
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
You can't open yourself to new experiences, new people,

23
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
new ways of doing things -- they might take you off course.

24
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
You can't not know who you are, so you cling to hard-matter identity.

25
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
You become a Christian, Muslim, Jew.

26
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
You're an Indian, Egyptian, Italian, American.

27
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You're a heterosexual or a homosexual, or you never have sex.

28
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Or at least, that's what you say when you identify yourself.

29
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
You become part of an "us."

30
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
In order to be secure, you defend against "them."

31
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
You cling to your land because it is your secure place.

32
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
You must fight anyone who encroaches upon it.

33
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
You become your nation. You become your religion.

34
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
You become whatever it is that will freeze you, numb you

35
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and protect you from doubt or change.

36
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But all this does, actually, is shut down your mind.

37
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
In reality, it does not really make you safer.

38
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I was in Sri Lanka, for example, three days after the tsunami,

39
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and I was standing on the beaches

40
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and it was absolutely clear that, in a matter of five minutes,

41
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
a 30-foot wave could rise up

42
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and desecrate a people, a population and lives.

43
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
All this striving for security, in fact,

44
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
has made you much more insecure

45
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
because now you have to watch out all the time.

46
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
There are people not like you -- people who you now call enemies.

47
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You have places you cannot go, thoughts you cannot think,

48
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
worlds that you can no longer inhabit.

49
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And so you spend your days fighting things off, defending your territory

50
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and becoming more entrenched in your fundamental thinking.

51
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Your days become devoted to protecting yourself.

52
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This becomes your mission. That is all you do.

53
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Ideas get shorter. They become sound bytes.

54
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
There are evildoers and saints, criminals and victims.

55
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
There are those who, if they're not with us, are against us.

56
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It gets easier to hurt people because you do not feel what's inside them.

57
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It gets easier to lock them up, force them to be naked, humiliate them,

58
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
occupy them, invade them and kill them,

59
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because they are only obstacles now to your security.

60
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
In six years, I've had the extraordinary privilege through V-Day,

61
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
a global movement against [violence against] women,

62
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to travel probably to 60 countries,

63
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and spend a great deal of time in different portions.

64
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I've met women and men all over this planet,

65
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
who through various circumstances --

66
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
war, poverty, racism, multiple forms of violence --

67
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
have never known security,

68
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
or have had their illusion of security forever devastated.

69
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I've spent time with women in Afghanistan under the Taliban,

70
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
who were essentially brutalized and censored.

71
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I've been in Bosnian refugee camps.

72
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I was with women in Pakistan

73
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
who have had their faces melted off with acid.

74
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I've been with girls all across America who were date-raped,

75
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
or raped by their best friends when they were drugged one night.

76
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
One of the amazing things that I've discovered in my travels

77
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
is that there is this emerging species.

78
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I loved when he was talking about this other world that's right next to this world.

79
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I've discovered these people, who, in V-Day world,

80
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
we call Vagina Warriors.

81
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
These particular people, rather than getting AK-47s,

82
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
or weapons of mass destruction, or machetes,

83
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in the spirit of the warrior, have gone into the center, the heart of pain, of loss.

84
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They have grieved it, they have died into it,

85
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and allowed and encouraged poison to turn into medicine.

86
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They have used the fuel of their pain to begin to redirect that energy

87
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
towards another mission and another trajectory.

88
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
These warriors now devote themselves and their lives

89
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to making sure what happened to them doesn't happen to anyone else.

90
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
There are thousands if not millions of them on the planet.

91
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I venture there are many in this room.

92
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
They have a fierceness and a freedom

93
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that I believe is the bedrock of a new paradigm.

94
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
They have broken out of the existing frame of victim and perpetrator.

95
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Their own personal security is not their end goal,

96
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and because of that, because, rather than worrying about security,

97
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because the transformation of suffering is their end goal,

98
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I actually believe they are creating real safety

99
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and a whole new idea of security.

100
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I want to talk about a few of these people that I've met.

101
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Tomorrow, I am going to Cairo,

102
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and I'm so moved that I will be with women in Cairo

103
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
who are V-Day women, who are opening the first safe house

104
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
for battered women in the Middle East.

105
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
That will happen because women in Cairo made a decision to stand up

106
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and put themselves on the line,

107
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and talk about the degree of violence that is happening in Egypt,

108
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and were willing to be attacked and criticized.

109
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And through their work over the last years,

110
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
this is not only happening that this house is opening,

111
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
but it's being supported by many factions of the society

112
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
who never would have supported it.

113
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Women in Uganda this year,

114
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
who put on "The Vagina Monologues" during V-Day,

115
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
actually evoked the wrath of the government.

116
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And, I love this story so much.

117
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
There was a cabinet meeting and a meeting of the presidents

118
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to talk about whether "Vaginas" could come to Uganda.

119
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And in this meeting -- it went on for weeks in the press,

120
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
two weeks where there was huge discussion.

121
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The government finally made a decision

122
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that "The Vagina Monologues" could not be performed in Uganda.

123
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But the amazing news was that because they had stood up, these women,

124
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and because they had been willing to risk their security,

125
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
it began a discussion that not only happened in Uganda,

126
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but all of Africa.

127
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
As a result, this production, which had already sold out,

128
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
every single person in that 800-seat audience, except for 10 people,

129
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
made a decision to keep the money.

130
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
They raised 10,000 dollars on a production that never occurred.

131
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
There's a young woman named Carrie Rethlefsen in Minnesota.

132
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
She's a high school student.

133
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
She had seen "The Vagina Monologues" and she was really moved. And as a result,

134
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
she wore an "I heart my vagina" button to her high school in Minnesota.

135
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

136
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
She was basically threatened to be expelled from school.

137
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
They told her she couldn't love her vagina in high school,

138
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that it was not a legal thing, that it was not a moral thing,

139
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that it was not a good thing.

140
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So she really struggled with this, what to do,

141
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
because she was a senior and she was doing well in her school

142
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and she was threatened expulsion. So what she did is she got all her friends together --

143
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I believe it was 100, 150 students

144
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
all wore "I love my vagina" T-shirts,

145
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and the boys wore "I love her vagina" T-shirts to school.

146
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now this seems like a fairly, you know, frivolous,

148
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but what happened as a result of that, is that that school now

149
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is forming a sex education class. It's beginning to talk about sex,

150
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
it's beginning to look at why it would be wrong

151
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
for a young high school girl to talk about her vagina publicly

152
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
or to say that she loved her vagina publicly.

153
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I know I've talked about Agnes here before,

154
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but I want to give you an update on Agnes.

155
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I met Agnes three years ago in the Rift Valley.

156
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
When she was a young girl, she had been mutilated against her will.

157
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
That mutilation of her clitoris

158
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
had actually obviously impacted her life

159
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and changed it in a way that was devastating.

160
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
She made a decision not to go and get a razor or a glass shard,

161
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but to devote her life to stopping that happening to other girls.

162
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
For eight years, she walked through the Rift Valley.

163
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
She had this amazing box that she carried and it had a

164
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
torso of a woman's body in it, a half a torso,

165
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and she would teach people, everywhere she went,

166
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
what a healthy vagina looked like and what a mutilated vagina looked like.

167
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
In the years that she walked, she educated parents, mothers, fathers.

168
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
She saved 1,500 girls from being cut.

169
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
When V-Day met her, we asked her how we could support her

170
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and she said, "Well, if you got me a Jeep,

171
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
I could get around a lot faster." So, we bought her a Jeep.

172
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
In the year she had the Jeep, she saved 4,500 girls from being cut.

173
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So, we said, what else could we do?

174
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
She said, "If you help me get money, I could open a house."

175
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Three years ago, Agnes opened a safe house in Africa to stop mutilation.

176
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
When she began her mission eight years ago, she was reviled,

177
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
she was detested, she was completely slandered in her community.

178
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I am proud to tell you that six months ago,

179
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
she was elected the deputy mayor of Narok.

180
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Applause)

181
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I think what I'm trying to say here

182
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
is that if your end goal is security,

183
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and if that's all you're focusing on, what ends up happening

184
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
is that you create not only more insecurity in other people,

185
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but you make yourself far more insecure.

186
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Real security is contemplating death, not pretending it doesn't exist.

187
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Not running from loss, but entering grief, surrendering to sorrow.

188
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Real security is not knowing something, when you don't know it.

189
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Real security is hungering for connection rather than power.

190
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It cannot be bought or arranged or made with bombs.

191
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It is deeper, it is a process, it is acute awareness

192
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that we are all utterly inter-bended,

193
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and one action by one being in one tiny town

194
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
has consequences everywhere.

195
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Real security is not only being able

196
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to tolerate mystery, complexity, ambiguity, but hungering for them

197
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and only trusting a situation when they are present.

198
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Something happened when I began traveling in V-Day, eight years ago. I got lost.

199
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I remember being on a plane going from Kenya to South Africa,

200
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and I had no idea where I was.

201
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I didn't know where I was going, where I'd come from,

202
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and I panicked. I had a total anxiety attack.

203
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And then I suddenly realized that it absolutely didn't matter

204
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
where I was going, or where I had come from

205
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
because we are all essentially permanently displaced people.

206
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
All of us are refugees.

207
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We come from somewhere and we are hopefully traveling all the time,

208
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
moving towards a new place.

209
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Freedom means I may not be identified as any one group,

210
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
but that I can visit and find myself in every group.

211
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
It does not mean that I don't have values or beliefs,

212
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but it does mean I am not hardened around them.

213
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I do not use them as weapons.

214
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
In the shared future, it will be just that, shared.

215
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The end goal will [be] becoming vulnerable,

216
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
realizing the place of our connection to one another,

217
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
rather than becoming secure, in control and alone.

218
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Thank you very much.

219
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
(Applause)

220
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Chris Anderson: And how are you doing? Are you exhausted?

221
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
On a typical day, do you wake up with hope or gloom?

222
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Eve Ensler: You know, I think Carl Jung once said

223
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
that in order to survive the twentieth century,

224
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
we have to live with two existing thoughts, opposite thoughts, at the same time.

225
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And I think part of what I'm learning in this process

226
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
is that one must allow oneself to feel grief.

227
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And I think as long as I keep grieving, and weeping,

228
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and then moving on, I'm fine.

229
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
When I start to pretend that what I'm seeing isn't impacting me,

230
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and isn't changing my heart, then I get in trouble.

231
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Because when you spend a lot of time going from place to place,

232
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
country to country, and city to city,

233
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
the degree to which women, for example, are violated,

234
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and the epidemic of it, and the kind of ordinariness of it,

235
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
is so devastating to one's soul that you have to take the time,

236
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
or I have to take the time now, to process that.

237
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
CA: There are a lot of causes out there in the world that have been talked about,

238
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
you know, poverty, sickness and so on. You spent eight years on this one.

239
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Why this one?

240
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
EE: I think that if you think about women,

241
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
women are the primary resource of the planet. They give birth,

242
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
we come from them, they are mothers, they are visionaries,

243
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
they are the future. If you think that the U.N. now says

244
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that one out of three women on the planet

245
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
will be raped or beaten in their lifetime,

246
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
we're talking about the desecration of the primary resource of the planet,

247
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
we're talking about the place where we come from, we're talking about parenting.

248
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Imagine that you've been raped and you're bringing up a boy child.

249
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
How does it impact your ability to work, or envision a future,

250
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
or thrive, as opposed to just survive? What I believe is

251
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
if we could figure out how to make women safe and honor women,

252
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
it would be parallel or equal to honoring life itself.

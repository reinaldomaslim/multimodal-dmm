0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Imagine spending seven years at MIT and research laboratories,

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:34,000
only to find out that you're a performance artist.

3
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I'm also a software engineer,

5
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and I make lots of different kinds of art with the computer.

6
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I think the main thing that I'm interested in

7
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
is trying to find a way of

8
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
making the computer into a personal mode of expression.

9
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And many of you out there are the heads of Macromedia and Microsoft,

10
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and in a way those are my bane:

11
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I think there's a great homogenizing force

12
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that software imposes on people and limits the way they think

13
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
about what's possible on the computer.

14
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Of course, it's also a great liberating force that makes possible,

15
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:15,000
you know, publishing and so forth, and standards, and so on.

16
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But, in a way, the computer makes possible much more

17
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
than what most people think, and my art has just been about

18
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:24,000
trying to find a personal way of using the computer,

19
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and so I end up writing software to do that.

20
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Chris has asked me to do a short performance,

21
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and so I'm going to take just this time -- maybe 10 minutes --

22
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to do that, and hopefully at the end have just a moment

23
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to show you a couple of my other projects in video form.

24
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Thank you.

25
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Applause)

26
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
We've got about a minute left.

27
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I'd just like to show a clip from a most recent project.

28
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:31,000
I did a performance with two singers

29
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
who specialize in making strange noises with their mouths.

30
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And this just came off last September at ARS Electronica;

31
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:39,000
we repeated it in England.

32
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And the idea is to visualize their speech and song behind them

33
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:43,000
with a large screen.

34
0:13:43,000 --> 0:13:45,000
We used a computer vision tracking system

35
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:47,000
in order to know where they were.

36
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And since we know where their heads are,

37
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and we have a wireless mic on them

38
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that we're processing the sound from,

39
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
we're able to create visualizations

40
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:56,000
which are linked very tightly to what they're doing with their speech.

41
0:13:56,000 --> 0:13:58,000
This will take about 30 seconds or so.

42
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:04,000
He's making a, kind of, cheek-flapping sound.

43
0:14:43,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Well, suffice it to say it's not all like that, but that's part of it.

44
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Thanks very much. There's always lots more.

45
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I'm overtime, so I just wanted to say you can, if you're in New York,

46
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:52,000
you can check out my work at the Whitney Biennial next week,

47
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and also at Bitforms Gallery in Chelsea.

48
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And with that, I think I should give up the stage,

49
0:14:57,000 --> 0:14:59,000
so, thank you so much.

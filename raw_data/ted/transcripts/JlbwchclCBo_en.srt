1
0:00:12.699,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Joseph Keller used to jog around the Stanford campus,

2
0:00:16.795,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and he was struck by all the women jogging there as well.

3
0:00:21.536,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Why did their ponytails swing from side to side like that?

4
0:00:25.687,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Being a mathematician, he set out to understand why.

5
0:00:28.849,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:30.024,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Professor Keller was curious about many things:

7
0:00:32.354,000 --> 0:00:33,000
why teapots dribble

8
0:00:34.345,000 --> 0:00:35,000
or how earthworms wriggle.

9
0:00:36.667,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Until a few months ago, I hadn't heard of Joseph Keller.

10
0:00:40.401,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I read about him in the New York Times,

11
0:00:43.277,000 --> 0:00:44,000
in the obituaries.

12
0:00:44.733,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The Times had half a page of editorial dedicated to him,

13
0:00:48.529,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which you can imagine is premium space for a newspaper of their stature.

14
0:00:53.188,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I read the obituaries almost every day.

15
0:00:56.51,000 --> 0:00:59,000
My wife understandably thinks I'm rather morbid

16
0:00:59.556,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to begin my day with scrambled eggs and a "Let's see who died today."

17
0:01:03.98,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:05.845,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But if you think about it,

19
0:01:07.161,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the front page of the newspaper is usually bad news,

20
0:01:10.598,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and cues man's failures.

21
0:01:12.597,000 --> 0:01:14,000
An instance where bad news cues accomplishment

22
0:01:15.287,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is at the end of the paper, in the obituaries.

23
0:01:19.225,000 --> 0:01:2,000
In my day job,

24
0:01:20.613,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I run a company that focuses on future insights

25
0:01:23.113,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that marketers can derive from past data --

26
0:01:25.557,000 --> 0:01:27,000
a kind of rearview-mirror analysis.

27
0:01:28.912,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And we began to think:

28
0:01:30.091,000 --> 0:01:35,000
What if we held a rearview mirror to obituaries from the New York Times?

29
0:01:36.334,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Were there lessons on how you could get your obituary featured --

30
0:01:39.826,000 --> 0:01:4,000
even if you aren't around to enjoy it?

31
0:01:41.827,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:43.335,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Would this go better with scrambled eggs?

33
0:01:45.987,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:47.983,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And so, we looked at the data.

35
0:01:51.689,000 --> 0:01:55,000
2,000 editorial, non-paid obituaries

36
0:01:56.207,000 --> 0:01:59,000
over a 20-month period between 2015 and 2016.

37
0:01:59.873,000 --> 0:02:03,000
What did these 2,000 deaths -- rather, lives -- teach us?

38
0:02:04.721,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Well, first we looked at words.

39
0:02:06.778,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This here is an obituary headline.

40
0:02:08.563,000 --> 0:02:1,000
This one is of the amazing Lee Kuan Yew.

41
0:02:10.883,000 --> 0:02:12,000
If you remove the beginning and the end,

42
0:02:13.429,000 --> 0:02:16,000
you're left with a beautifully worded descriptor

43
0:02:16.787,000 --> 0:02:2,000
that tries to, in just a few words, capture an achievement or a lifetime.

44
0:02:21.486,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Just looking at these is fascinating.

45
0:02:24.121,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Here are a few famous ones, people who died in the last two years.

46
0:02:27.44,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Try and guess who they are.

47
0:02:28.783,000 --> 0:02:29,000
[An Artist who Defied Genre]

48
0:02:30.247,000 --> 0:02:31,000
That's Prince.

49
0:02:32.317,000 --> 0:02:33,000
[Titan of Boxing and the 20th Century]

50
0:02:34.178,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Oh, yes.

51
0:02:35.362,000 --> 0:02:36,000
[Muhammad Ali]

52
0:02:36.61,000 --> 0:02:37,000
[Groundbreaking Architect]

53
0:02:38.18,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Zaha Hadid.

54
0:02:40.663,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So we took these descriptors

55
0:02:42.435,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and did what's called natural language processing,

56
0:02:44.983,000 --> 0:02:45,000
where you feed these into a program,

57
0:02:46.778,000 --> 0:02:47,000
it throws out the superfluous words --

58
0:02:48.667,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"the," "and," -- the kind of words you can mime easily in "Charades," --

59
0:02:52.914,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and leaves you with the most significant words.

60
0:02:55.131,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And we did it not just for these four,

61
0:02:56.976,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but for all 2,000 descriptors.

62
0:02:59.519,000 --> 0:03:,000
And this is what it looks like.

63
0:03:02.824,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Film, theatre, music, dance and of course, art, are huge.

64
0:03:08.305,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Over 40 percent.

65
0:03:10.275,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You have to wonder why in so many societies

66
0:03:12.827,000 --> 0:03:16,000
we insist that our kids pursue engineering or medicine or business or law

67
0:03:17.286,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to be construed as successful.

68
0:03:19.691,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And while we're talking profession,

69
0:03:21.408,000 --> 0:03:22,000
let's look at age --

70
0:03:22.583,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the average age at which they achieved things.

71
0:03:25.117,000 --> 0:03:26,000
That number is 37.

72
0:03:28.094,000 --> 0:03:31,000
What that means is, you've got to wait 37 years ...

73
0:03:31.774,000 --> 0:03:34,000
before your first significant achievement that you're remembered for --

74
0:03:35.193,000 --> 0:03:36,000
on average --

75
0:03:36.368,000 --> 0:03:38,000
44 years later, when you die at the age of 81 --

76
0:03:38.87,000 --> 0:03:39,000
on average.

77
0:03:40.062,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:41.087,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Talk about having to be patient.

79
0:03:42.795,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:43.876,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Of course, it varies by profession.

81
0:03:46.386,000 --> 0:03:47,000
If you're a sports star,

82
0:03:47.603,000 --> 0:03:49,000
you'll probably hit your stride in your 20s.

83
0:03:49.754,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And if you're in your 40s like me,

84
0:03:52.423,000 --> 0:03:53,000
you can join the fun world of politics.

85
0:03:54.438,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

86
0:03:55.518,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Politicians do their first and sometimes only commendable act in their mid-40s.

87
0:03:59.457,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:00.738,000 --> 0:04:01,000
If you're wondering what "others" are,

89
0:04:02.699,000 --> 0:04:03,000
here are some examples.

90
0:04:04.641,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Isn't it fascinating, the things people do

91
0:04:06.781,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and the things they're remembered for?

92
0:04:08.687,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:11.956,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Our curiosity was in overdrive,

94
0:04:13.824,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and we desired to analyze more than just a descriptor.

95
0:04:18.818,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So, we ingested the entire first paragraph of all 2,000 obituaries,

96
0:04:23.788,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but we did this separately for two groups of people:

97
0:04:26.586,000 --> 0:04:28,000
people that are famous and people that are not famous.

98
0:04:29.387,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Famous people -- Prince, Ali, Zaha Hadid --

99
0:04:32.1,000 --> 0:04:36,000
people who are not famous are people like Jocelyn Cooper,

100
0:04:36.359,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Reverend Curry

101
0:04:37.537,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or Lorna Kelly.

102
0:04:38.73,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I'm willing to bet you haven't heard of most of their names.

103
0:04:41.942,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Amazing people, fantastic achievements, but they're not famous.

104
0:04:46.54,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So what if we analyze these two groups separately --

105
0:04:49.352,000 --> 0:04:5,000
the famous and the non-famous?

106
0:04:50.901,000 --> 0:04:51,000
What might that tell us?

107
0:04:52.344,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Take a look.

108
0:04:56.376,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Two things leap out at me.

109
0:04:58.389,000 --> 0:04:59,000
First:

110
0:04:59.926,000 --> 0:05:,000
"John."

111
0:05:01.148,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:03.734,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Anyone here named John should thank your parents --

113
0:05:07.146,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:08.499,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and remind your kids to cut out your obituary when you're gone.

115
0:05:12.881,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And second:

116
0:05:15.669,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"help."

117
0:05:18.344,000 --> 0:05:21,000
We uncovered, many lessons from lives well-led,

118
0:05:21.833,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and what those people immortalized in print could teach us.

119
0:05:24.693,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The exercise was a fascinating testament to the kaleidoscope that is life,

120
0:05:29.455,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and even more fascinating

121
0:05:32.194,000 --> 0:05:35,000
was the fact that the overwhelming majority of obituaries

122
0:05:35.286,000 --> 0:05:37,000
featured people famous and non-famous,

123
0:05:38.308,000 --> 0:05:4,000
who did seemingly extraordinary things.

124
0:05:41.394,000 --> 0:05:44,000
They made a positive dent in the fabric of life.

125
0:05:44.528,000 --> 0:05:45,000
They helped.

126
0:05:46.592,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So ask yourselves as you go back to your daily lives:

127
0:05:49.207,000 --> 0:05:51,000
How am I using my talents to help society?

128
0:05:52.151,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Because the most powerful lesson here is,

129
0:05:55.148,000 --> 0:05:59,000
if more people lived their lives trying to be famous in death,

130
0:05:59.508,000 --> 0:06:01,000
the world would be a much better place.

131
0:06:02.882,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Thank you.

132
0:06:04.075,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Applause)

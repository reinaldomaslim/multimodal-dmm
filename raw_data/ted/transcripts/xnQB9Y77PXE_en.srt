1
0:00:12.706,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Do you remember your first kiss?

2
0:00:15.548,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Or that time you burned the roof of your mouth

3
0:00:17.785,000 --> 0:00:18,000
on a hot slice of pizza?

4
0:00:19.532,000 --> 0:00:21,000
What about playing tag or duck, duck, goose as a child?

5
0:00:22.863,000 --> 0:00:25,000
These are all instances where we're using touch to understand something.

6
0:00:26.974,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And it's the basis of haptic design.

7
0:00:29.434,000 --> 0:00:31,000
"Haptic" means of or relating to the sense of touch.

8
0:00:32.252,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And we've all been using that our entire lives.

9
0:00:35.791,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I was working on my computer when my friend,

10
0:00:38.308,000 --> 0:00:4,000
seeing me hunched over typing, walked over behind me.

11
0:00:41.617,000 --> 0:00:43,000
She put her left thumb into the left side of my lower back,

12
0:00:44.537,000 --> 0:00:47,000
while reaching her right index finger around to the front of my right shoulder.

13
0:00:48.315,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Instinctively, I sat up straight.

14
0:00:50.179,000 --> 0:00:52,000
In one quick and gentle gesture,

15
0:00:52.395,000 --> 0:00:54,000
she had communicated how to improve my posture.

16
0:00:55.561,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The paper I was working on at that very moment

17
0:00:57.754,000 --> 0:01:,000
centered around developing new ways to teach movement using technology.

18
0:01:01.579,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I wanted to create a suit that could teach a person kung fu.

19
0:01:05.434,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But I had no idea how to communicate movement

21
0:01:09.403,000 --> 0:01:1,000
without an instructor being in the room.

22
0:01:12.187,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And in that moment, it became crystal clear: touch.

23
0:01:16.657,000 --> 0:01:19,000
If I had vibrating motors where she had placed each of her fingers,

24
0:01:20.18,000 --> 0:01:24,000
paired with motion-capture data of my current and optimal posture,

25
0:01:24.57,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I could simulate the entire experience

26
0:01:26.497,000 --> 0:01:28,000
without an instructor needing to be in the room.

27
0:01:28.995,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But there was still one important part of the puzzle that was missing.

28
0:01:32.727,000 --> 0:01:34,000
If I want you to raise your wrist two inches off of your lap,

29
0:01:35.624,000 --> 0:01:36,000
using vibration,

30
0:01:37.361,000 --> 0:01:38,000
how do I tell you to do that?

31
0:01:40.237,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Do I put a motor at the top of your wrist, so you know to lift up?

32
0:01:43.539,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Or do I put one at the bottom of your wrist,

33
0:01:45.658,000 --> 0:01:46,000
so it feels like you're being pushed up?

34
0:01:47.61,000 --> 0:01:48,000
There were no readily available answers

35
0:01:49.546,000 --> 0:01:51,000
because there was no commonly agreed-upon haptic language

36
0:01:52.245,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to communicate information with.

37
0:01:54.188,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So my cofounders and I set out to create that language.

38
0:01:57.987,000 --> 0:02:,000
And the first device we built was not a kung fu suit.

39
0:02:01.178,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:02.408,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But in a way, it was even more impressive

41
0:02:04.792,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because of its simplicity and usefulness.

42
0:02:07.394,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We started with the use case of navigation,

43
0:02:09.823,000 --> 0:02:11,000
which is a simplified form of movement.

44
0:02:12.687,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We then created Wayband,

45
0:02:15.561,000 --> 0:02:18,000
a wrist-wearable device that could orient a user toward a destination,

46
0:02:19.414,000 --> 0:02:2,000
using vibrating cues.

47
0:02:22.235,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We would ask people to spin around

48
0:02:25.054,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and to stop in a way that they felt was the right way to go.

49
0:02:29.061,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Informally, we tried this with hundreds of people,

50
0:02:31.458,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and most could figure it out within about 15 seconds.

51
0:02:34.441,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It was that intuitive.

52
0:02:36.847,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Initially, we were just trying to get people out of their phones

53
0:02:39.953,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and back into the real world.

54
0:02:41.776,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But the more we experimented,

55
0:02:43.76,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the more we realized that those who stood to benefit most from our work

56
0:02:47.951,000 --> 0:02:49,000
were people who had little or no sight.

57
0:02:51.387,000 --> 0:02:53,000
When we first approached a blind organization, they told us,

58
0:02:54.276,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"Don't build a blind device.

59
0:02:56.68,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Build a device that everyone can use

60
0:02:58.704,000 --> 0:03:,000
but that's optimized for the blind experience."

61
0:03:01.505,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We created our company WearWorks with three guiding principles:

62
0:03:06.792,000 --> 0:03:07,000
make cool stuff,

63
0:03:08.49,000 --> 0:03:1,000
create the greatest impact we can in our lifetimes

64
0:03:11.442,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and reimagine an entire world designed for touch.

65
0:03:15.62,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And on November 5, 2017,

66
0:03:19.446,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Wayband helped a person who was blind

67
0:03:22.382,000 --> 0:03:24,000
run the first 15 miles of the New York City Marathon

68
0:03:25.188,000 --> 0:03:26,000
without any sighted assistance.

69
0:03:27.165,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Applause)

70
0:03:35.744,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It didn't get him through the entire race due to the heavy rain,

71
0:03:38.785,000 --> 0:03:39,000
but that didn't matter.

72
0:03:39.999,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:41.03,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We had proved the point:

74
0:03:42.268,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that it was possible to navigate a complex route using only touch.

75
0:03:45.847,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So, why touch?

76
0:03:47.903,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The skin has an innate sensitivity

77
0:03:49.618,000 --> 0:03:52,000
akin to the eyes' ability to recognize millions of colors

78
0:03:53.109,000 --> 0:03:56,000
or the ears' ability to recognize complex pitch and tone.

79
0:03:56.387,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Yet, as a communications channel,

80
0:03:58.038,000 --> 0:04:01,000
it's been largely relegated to Morse code-like cell phone notifications.

81
0:04:01.696,000 --> 0:04:04,000
If you were to suddenly receive a kiss or a punch,

82
0:04:04.792,000 --> 0:04:06,000
your reaction would be instinctive and immediate.

83
0:04:08.378,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Meanwhile, your brain would be playing catch-up on the back end

84
0:04:11.397,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to understand the details of what just occurred.

85
0:04:13.714,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And compared to instincts, conscious thought is pretty slow.

86
0:04:17.706,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But it's a lightning bolt

87
0:04:18.993,000 --> 0:04:2,000
compared to the snail's pace of language acquisition.

88
0:04:22.008,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I spent a considerable amount of time

89
0:04:24.395,000 --> 0:04:29,000
learning Spanish, Japanese, German and currently Swedish,

90
0:04:30.125,000 --> 0:04:31,000
with varying degrees of failure.

91
0:04:31.856,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:35.482,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But within those failures were kernels of how different languages are organized.

93
0:04:39.659,000 --> 0:04:4,000
That gave our team insight

94
0:04:41.39,000 --> 0:04:44,000
into how to use the linguistic order of well-established languages

95
0:04:45.152,000 --> 0:04:48,000
as inspiration for an entirely new haptic language,

96
0:04:48.538,000 --> 0:04:49,000
one based purely on touch.

97
0:04:50.95,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It also showed us when using language mechanics wasn't the best way

98
0:04:54.543,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to deliver information.

99
0:04:56.823,000 --> 0:04:59,000
In the same way a smile is a smile across every culture,

100
0:05:00.339,000 --> 0:05:02,000
what if there was some underlying mechanism of touch

101
0:05:02.8,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that transcended linguistic and cultural boundaries?

102
0:05:06.235,000 --> 0:05:07,000
A universal language, of sorts.

103
0:05:08.646,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You see, I could give you buzz-buzz-buzz, buzz-buzz,

104
0:05:13.092,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and you would eventually learn

105
0:05:14.567,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that that particular vibration means "stop."

106
0:05:17.123,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But as haptic designers, we challenged ourselves.

107
0:05:21.045,000 --> 0:05:23,000
What would it be like to design "stop?"

108
0:05:24.299,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Well, based on context,

109
0:05:25.562,000 --> 0:05:27,000
most of us have the experience of being in a vehicle

110
0:05:28.03,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and having that vehicle stop suddenly, along with our body's reaction to it.

111
0:05:32.545,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So if I wanted you to stop,

112
0:05:34.298,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I could send you a vibration pattern, sure.

113
0:05:36.339,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Or, I could design a haptic experience

114
0:05:39.123,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that just made stopping feel like it was the right thing to do.

115
0:05:43.496,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And that takes more than an arbitrary assignment of haptic cues to meanings.

116
0:05:47.704,000 --> 0:05:48,000
It takes a deep empathy.

117
0:05:49.95,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It also takes the ability to distill human experience into meaningful insights

118
0:05:54.744,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and then into haptic gestures and products.

119
0:05:59.133,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Haptic design is going to expand the human ability

120
0:06:01.918,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to sense and respond to our environments,

121
0:06:04.117,000 --> 0:06:05,000
both physical and virtual.

122
0:06:06.292,000 --> 0:06:08,000
There's a new frontier: touch.

123
0:06:09.545,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And it has the power to change how we all see the world around us.

124
0:06:13.325,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Thank you.

125
0:06:14.531,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Applause)

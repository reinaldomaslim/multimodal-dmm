1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
When I was little --

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and by the way, I was little once --

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
my father told me a story

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
about an 18th century watchmaker.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And what this guy had done:

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
he used to produce these fabulously beautiful watches.

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And one day, one of his customers came into his workshop

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and asked him to clean the watch that he'd bought.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And the guy took it apart,

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and one of the things he pulled out was one of the balance wheels.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And as he did so, his customer noticed

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that on the back side of the balance wheel was an engraving,

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
were words.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And he said to the guy,

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"Why have you put stuff on the back

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that no one will ever see?"

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And the watchmaker turned around and said,

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
"God can see it."

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now I'm not in the least bit religious,

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
neither was my father,

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but at that point, I noticed something happening here.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I felt something

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
in this plexus of blood vessels and nerves,

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and there must be some muscles in there as well somewhere, I guess.

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But I felt something.

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And it was a physiological response.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And from that point on, from my age at the time,

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I began to think of things in a different way.

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And as I took on my career as a designer,

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I began to ask myself the simple question:

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Do we actually think beauty,

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or do we feel it?

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now you probably know the answer to this already.

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You probably think, well, I don't know which one you think it is,

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but I think it's about feeling beauty.

36
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And so I then moved on into my design career

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and began to find some exciting things.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
One of the most early work was done in automotive design --

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
some very exciting work was done there.

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And during a lot of this work,

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we found something, or I found something,

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that really fascinated me, and maybe you can remember it.

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Do you remember when lights used to just go on and off,

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
click click, when you closed the door in a car?

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And then somebody, I think it was BMW,

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
introduced a light that went out slowly.

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Remember that?

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I remember it clearly.

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Do you remember the first time you were in a car and it did that?

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I remember sitting there thinking, this is fantastic.

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
In fact, I've never found anybody

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that doesn't like the light that goes out slowly.

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I thought, well what the hell's that about?

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So I started to ask myself questions about it.

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And the first was, I'd ask other people: "Do you like it?" "Yes."

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
"Why?" And they'd say, "Oh, it feels so natural,"

57
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
or, "It's nice."

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I thought, well that's not good enough.

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Can we cut down a little bit further,

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
because, as a designer, I need the vocabulary, I need the keyboard,

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
of how this actually works.

62
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And so I did some experiments.

63
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And I suddenly realized

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that there was something that did exactly that --

65
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
light to dark in six seconds --

66
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
exactly that.

67
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Do you know what it is? Anyone?

68
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
You see, using this bit, the thinky bit,

69
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the slow bit of the brain -- using that.

70
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And this isn't a think, it's a feel.

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And would you do me a favor?

72
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
For the next 14 minutes or whatever it is,

73
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
will you feel stuff?

74
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I don't need you to think so much as I want you to feel it.

75
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I felt a sense of relaxation

76
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
tempered with anticipation.

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And that thing that I found

78
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
was the cinema or the theater.

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It's actually just happened here --

80
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
light to dark in six seconds.

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And when that happens, are you sitting there going,

82
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
"No, the movie's about to start,"

83
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
or are you going, "That's fantastic. I'm looking forward to it.

84
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I get a sense of anticipation"?

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now I'm not a neuroscientist.

86
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I don't know even if there is something called a conditioned reflex.

87
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But it might be.

88
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Because the people I speak to in the northern hemisphere

89
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that used to go in the cinema get this.

90
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And some of the people I speak to

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that have never seen a movie or been to the theater

92
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
don't get it in the same way.

93
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Everybody likes it,

94
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but some like it more than others.

95
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So this leads me to think of this in a different way.

96
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
We're not feeling it. We're thinking beauty is in the limbic system --

97
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
if that's not an outmoded idea.

98
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
These are the bits, the pleasure centers,

99
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and maybe what I'm seeing and sensing and feeling

100
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is bypassing my thinking.

101
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The wiring from your sensory apparatus to those bits

102
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is shorter than the bits that have to pass through the thinky bit, the cortex.

103
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
They arrive first.

104
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So how do we make that actually work?

105
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And how much of that reactive side of it

106
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
is due to what we already know,

107
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
or what we're going to learn, about something?

108
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This is one of the most beautiful things I know.

109
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's a plastic bag.

110
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And when I looked at it first, I thought, no, there's no beauty in that.

111
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Then I found out,

112
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
post exposure,

113
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that this plastic bag if I put it into a filthy puddle

114
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
or a stream filled with coliforms

115
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and all sorts of disgusting stuff,

116
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that that filthy water

117
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
will migrate through the wall of the bag by osmosis

118
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and end up inside it as pure, potable drinking water.

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And all of a sudden, this plastic bag

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
was extremely beautiful to me.

121
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Now I'm going to ask you again

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to switch on the emotional bit.

123
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Would you mind taking the brain out,

124
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and I just want you to feel something.

125
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Look at that. What are you feeling about it?

126
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Is it beautiful? Is it exciting?

127
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I'm watching your faces very carefully.

128
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
There's some rather bored-looking gentlemen

129
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and some slightly engaged-looking ladies

130
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
who are picking up something off that.

131
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Maybe there's an innocence to it.

132
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now I'm going to tell you what it is. Are you ready?

133
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This is the last act on this Earth

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
of a little girl called Heidi, five years old,

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
before she died of cancer to the spine.

136
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It's the last thing she did,

137
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the last physical act.

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Look at that picture.

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Look at the innocence. Look at the beauty in it.

140
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Is it beautiful now?

141
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Stop. Stop. How do you feel?

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Where are you feeling this?

143
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I'm feeling it here. I feel it here.

144
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And I'm watching your faces,

145
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
because your faces are telling me something.

146
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The lady over there is actually crying, by the way.

147
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But what are you doing?

148
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I watch what people do.

149
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I watch faces.

150
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I watch reactions.

151
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Because I have to know how people react to things.

152
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And one of the most common faces

153
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
on something faced with beauty,

154
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
something stupefyingly delicious,

155
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
is what I call the OMG.

156
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And by the way, there's no pleasure in that face.

157
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It's not a "this is wonderful!"

158
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
The eyebrows are doing this, the eyes are defocused,

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and the mouth is hanging open.

160
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
That's not the expression of joy.

161
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
There's something else in that.

162
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
There's something weird happening.

163
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So pleasure seems to be tempered

164
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
by a whole series of different things coming in.

165
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Poignancy is a word I love as a designer.

166
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
It means something triggering a big emotional response,

167
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
often quite a sad emotional response,

168
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but it's part of what we do.

169
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It isn't just about nice.

170
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And this is the dilemma, this is the paradox, of beauty.

171
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Sensorily, we're taking in all sorts of things --

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
mixtures of things that are good, bad, exciting, frightening --

173
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to come up with that sensorial exposure,

174
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that sensation of what's going on.

175
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Pathos appears obviously

176
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
as part of what you just saw in that little girl's drawing.

177
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And also triumph, this sense of transcendence,

178
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
this "I never knew that. Ah, this is something new."

179
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And that's packed in there as well.

180
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And as we assemble these tools,

181
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
from a design point of view, I get terribly excited about it,

182
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
because these are things, as we've already said,

183
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
they're arriving at the brain, it would seem,

184
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
before cognition, before we can manipulate them --

185
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
electrochemical party tricks.

186
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Now what I'm also interested in is:

187
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Is it possible to separate

188
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
intrinsic and extrinsic beauty?

189
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
By that, I mean intrinsically beautiful things,

190
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
just something that's exquisitely beautiful,

191
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that's universally beautiful.

192
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Very hard to find. Maybe you've got some examples of it.

193
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Very hard to find something that, to everybody,

194
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is a very beautiful thing,

195
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
without a certain amount of information packed in there before.

196
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So a lot of it tends to be extrinsic.

197
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It's mediated by information before the comprehension.

198
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Or the information's added on at the back,

199
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
like that little girl's drawing that I showed you.

200
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Now when talking about beauty

201
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
you can't get away from the fact

202
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that a lot experiments have been done in this way

203
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
with faces and what have you.

204
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And one of the most tedious ones, I think,

205
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
was saying that beauty was about symmetry.

206
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Well it obviously isn't.

207
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
This is a more interesting one

208
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
where half faces were shown to some people,

209
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and then to add them into a list

210
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
of most beautiful to least beautiful

211
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and then exposing a full face.

212
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And they found that it was almost exact coincidence.

213
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So it wasn't about symmetry.

214
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
In fact, this lady has a particularly asymmetrical face,

215
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
of which both sides are beautiful.

216
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But they're both different.

217
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And as a designer, I can't help meddling with this,

218
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
so I pulled it to bits and sort of did stuff like this,

219
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and tried to understand what the individual elements were,

220
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but feeling it as I go.

221
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Now I can feel a sensation of delight and beauty

222
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
if I look at that eye.

223
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I'm not getting it off the eyebrow.

224
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And the earhole isn't doing it to me at all.

225
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So I don't know how much this is helping me,

226
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
but it's helping to guide me to the places

227
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
where the signals are coming off.

228
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And as I say, I'm not a neuroscientist,

229
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but to understand how I can start to assemble things

230
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that will very quickly bypass

231
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
this thinking part

232
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and get me to the enjoyable precognitive elements.

233
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Anais Nin and the Talmud have told us time and time again

234
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that we see things not as they are, but as we are.

235
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So I'm going to shamelessly expose something to you,

236
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
which is beautiful to me.

237
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And this is the F1 MV Agusta.

238
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Ahhhh.

239
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It is really -- I mean, I can't express to you

240
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
how exquisite this object is.

241
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
But I also know why it's exquisite to me,

242
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
because it's a palimpsest of things.

243
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It's masses and masses of layers.

244
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
This is just the bit that protrudes into our physical dimension.

245
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It's something much bigger.

246
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Layer after layer of legend, sport, details that resonate.

247
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I mean, if I just go through some of them now --

248
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I know about laminar flow when it comes to air-piercing objects,

249
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and that does it consummately well, you can see it can.

250
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So that's getting me excited.

251
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And I feel that here.

252
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
This bit, the big secret of automotive design --

253
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
reflection management.

254
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It's not about the shapes,

255
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
it's how the shapes reflect light.

256
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Now that thing, light flickers across it as you move,

257
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
so it becomes a kinetic object,

258
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
even though it's standing still --

259
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
managed by how brilliantly that's done on the reflection.

260
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This little relief on the footplate, by the way, to a rider

261
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
means there's something going on underneath it --

262
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in this case, a drive chain running at 300 miles and hour probably,

263
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
taking the power from the engine.

264
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I'm getting terribly excited

265
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
as my mind and my eyes flick across these things.

266
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Titanium lacquer on this.

267
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I can't tell you how wonderful this is.

268
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
That's how you stop the nuts coming off at high speed on the wheel.

269
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I'm really getting into this now.

270
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And of course, a racing bike doesn't have a prop stand,

271
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but this one, because it's a road bike,

272
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
it all goes away and it folds into this little gap.

273
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So it disappears.

274
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And then I can't tell you how hard it is to do that radiator, which is curved.

275
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Why would you do that?

276
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Because I know we need to bring the wheel farther into the aerodynamics.

277
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So it's more expensive, but it's wonderful.

278
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And to cap it all,

279
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
brand royalty --

280
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Agusta, Count Agusta,

281
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
from the great histories of this stuff.

282
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
The bit that you can't see is the genius that created this.

283
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Massimo Tamburini.

284
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
They call him "The Plumber" in Italy,

285
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
as well as "Maestro,"

286
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
because he actually is engineer

287
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and craftsman and sculptor at the same time.

288
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
There's so little compromise on this, you can't see it.

289
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
But unfortunately, the likes of me and people that are like me

290
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
have to deal with compromise all the time with beauty.

291
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
We have to deal with it.

292
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So I have to work with a supply chain, and I've got to work with the technologies,

293
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
and I've got to work with everything else all the time,

294
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and so compromises start to fit into it.

295
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And so look at her.

296
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I've had to make a bit of a compromise there.

297
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I've had to move that part across, but only a millimeter.

298
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
No one's noticed, have they yet?

299
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Did you see what I did?

300
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I moved three things by a millimeter.

301
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Pretty? Yes.

302
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Beautiful? Maybe lesser.

303
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But then, of course, the consumer says that doesn't really matter.

304
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So that's okay, isn't it?

305
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Another millimeter?

306
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
No one's going to notice those split lines and changes.

307
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
It's that easy to lose beauty,

308
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
because beauty's incredibly difficult to do.

309
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And only a few people can do it.

310
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And a focus group cannot do it.

311
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And a team rarely can do it.

312
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
It takes a central cortex, if you like,

313
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
to be able to orchestrate all those elements at the same time.

314
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
This is a beautiful water bottle --

315
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
some of you know of it --

316
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
done by Ross Lovegrove, the designer.

317
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
This is pretty close to intrinsic beauty. This one,

318
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
as long as you know what water is like

319
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
then you can experience this.

320
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It's lovely because it is an embodiment

321
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
of something refreshing and delicious.

322
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I might like it more than you like it,

323
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
because I know how bloody hard it is to do it.

324
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It's stupefyingly difficult

325
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
to make something that refracts light like that,

326
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that comes out of the tool correctly,

327
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
that goes down the line without falling over.

328
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Underneath this, like the story of the swan,

329
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
is a million things very difficult to do.

330
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So all hail to that.

331
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It's a fantastic example, a simple object.

332
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And the one I showed you before was, of course, a massively complex one.

333
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And they're working in beauty

334
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
in slightly different ways because of it.

335
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
You all, I guess, like me,

336
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
enjoy watching a ballet dancer dance.

337
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And part of the joy of it is, you know the difficulty.

338
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
You also may be taking into account the fact that it's incredibly painful.

339
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Anybody seen a ballet dancer's toes

340
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
when they come out of the points?

341
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
While she's doing these graceful arabesques and plies and what have you,

342
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
something horrible's going on down here.

343
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
The comprehension of it

344
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
leads us to a greater and heightened sense

345
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
of the beauty of what's actually going on.

346
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Now I'm using microseconds wrongly here,

347
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
so please ignore me.

348
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
But what I have to do now, feeling again,

349
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
what I've got to do is to be able to supply enough of these enzymes,

350
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
of these triggers into something early on in the process,

351
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
that you pick it up,

352
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
not through your thinking, but through your feeling.

353
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
So we're going to have a little experiment.

354
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Right, are you ready? I'm going to show you something for a very, very brief moment.

355
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Are you ready? Okay.

356
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Did you think that was a bicycle when I showed it to you at the first flash?

357
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
It's not.

358
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Tell me something, did you think it was quick when you first saw it? Yes you did.

359
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Did you think it was modern? Yes you did.

360
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
That blip, that information, shot into you before that.

361
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And because your brain starter motor began there,

362
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
now it's got to deal with it.

363
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And the great thing is, this motorcycle has been styled this way

364
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
specifically to engender a sense

365
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
that it's green technology and it's good for you

366
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and it's light and it's all part of the future.

367
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
So is that wrong?

368
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Well in this case it isn't,

369
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
because it's a very, very ecologically-sound piece of technology.

370
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
But you're a slave of that first flash.

371
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
We are slaves to the first few fractions of a second --

372
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and that's where much of my work

373
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
has to win or lose,

374
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
on a shelf in a shop.

375
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
It wins or loses at that point.

376
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
You may see 50, 100, 200 things on a shelf

377
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
as you walk down it,

378
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
but I have to work within that domain,

379
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
to ensure that it gets you there first.

380
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And finally, the layer that I love, of knowledge.

381
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Some of you, I'm sure, will be familiar with this.

382
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
What's incredible about this,

383
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and the way I love to come back to it,

384
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
is this is taking something that you hate or bores you,

385
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
folding clothes,

386
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and if you can actually do this --

387
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
who can actually do this? Anybody try to do this?

388
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Yeah?

389
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
It's fantastic, isn't it?

390
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Look at that. Do you want to see it again?

391
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
No time. It says I have two minutes left, so we can't do this.

392
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
But just go to the Web, YouTube,

393
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
pull it down, "folding T-shirt."

394
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
That's how underpaid younger-aged people have to fold your T-shirt.

395
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
You didn't maybe know it.

396
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
But how do you feel about it?

397
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
It feels fantastic when you do it, you look forward to doing it,

398
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and when you tell somebody else about it -- like you probably have --

399
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
you look really smart.

400
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
The knowledge bubble that sits around the outside,

401
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
the stuff that costs nothing,

402
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
because that knowledge is free --

403
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
bundle that together and where do we come out?

404
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Form follows function?

405
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Only sometimes. Only sometimes.

406
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Form is function. Form is function.

407
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
It informs, it tells us,

408
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
it supplies us answers before we've even thought about it.

409
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And so I've stopped using words like "form,"

410
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and I've stopped using words like "function" as a designer.

411
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
What I try to pursue now

412
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
is the emotional functionality of things.

413
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Because if I can get that right,

414
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
I can make them wonderful, and I can make them repeatedly wonderful.

415
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And you know what those products and services are,

416
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
because you own some of them.

417
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
They're the things that you'd snatch if the house was on fire.

418
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Forming the emotional bond

419
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
between this thing and you

420
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
is an electrochemical party trick

421
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
that happens before you even think about it.

422
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Thank you very much.

423
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:15.814,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's wonderful to be here

3
0:00:18.045,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to talk about my journey,

4
0:00:20.131,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to talk about the wheelchair

5
0:00:21.865,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and the freedom it has bought me.

6
0:00:24.505,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I started using a wheelchair 16 years ago

7
0:00:27.142,000 --> 0:00:29,000
when an extended illness

8
0:00:29.276,000 --> 0:00:32,000
changed the way I could access the world.

9
0:00:32.862,000 --> 0:00:34,000
When I started using the wheelchair,

10
0:00:35.239,000 --> 0:00:37,000
it was a tremendous new freedom.

11
0:00:37.824,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'd seen my life slip away and become restricted.

12
0:00:40.91,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It was like having an enormous new toy.

13
0:00:43.48,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I could whiz around and feel the wind in my face again.

14
0:00:47.51,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Just being out on the street was exhilarating.

15
0:00:51.018,000 --> 0:00:55,000
But even though I had this newfound joy and freedom,

16
0:00:55.42,000 --> 0:00:58,000
people's reaction completely changed towards me.

17
0:00:58.972,000 --> 0:01:,000
It was as if they couldn't see me anymore,

18
0:01:01.452,000 --> 0:01:04,000
as if an invisibility cloak had descended.

19
0:01:05.451,000 --> 0:01:08,000
They seemed to see me in terms of their assumptions

20
0:01:08.672,000 --> 0:01:12,000
of what it must be like to be in a wheelchair.

21
0:01:12.9,000 --> 0:01:16,000
When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair,

22
0:01:17.812,000 --> 0:01:2,000
they used words like "limitation," "fear,"

23
0:01:21.366,000 --> 0:01:24,000
"pity" and "restriction."

24
0:01:24.391,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I realized I'd internalized these responses

25
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and it had changed who I was on a core level.

26
0:01:32.697,000 --> 0:01:36,000
A part of me had become alienated from myself.

27
0:01:36.887,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I was seeing myself not from my perspective,

28
0:01:40.472,000 --> 0:01:44,000
but vividly and continuously from the perspective

29
0:01:44.634,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of other people's responses to me.

30
0:01:47.531,000 --> 0:01:52,000
As a result, I knew I needed to make my own stories

31
0:01:52.656,000 --> 0:01:54,000
about this experience,

32
0:01:54.895,000 --> 0:01:56,000
new narratives to reclaim my identity.

33
0:01:57.671,000 --> 0:02:,000
["Finding Freedom: 'By creating our own stories we learn to take the texts of our lives as seriously as we do 'official' narratives.' — Davis 2009, TEDx Women"]

34
0:02:00.775,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I started making work

35
0:02:02.853,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that aimed to communicate something

36
0:02:05.669,000 --> 0:02:1,000
of the joy and freedom I felt when using a wheelchair --

37
0:02:10.787,000 --> 0:02:14,000
a power chair -- to negotiate the world.

38
0:02:15.401,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I was working to transform these internalized responses,

39
0:02:21.986,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to transform the preconceptions that had so shaped

40
0:02:25.781,000 --> 0:02:28,000
my identity when I started using a wheelchair,

41
0:02:28.962,000 --> 0:02:31,000
by creating unexpected images.

42
0:02:32.726,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The wheelchair became an object to paint and play with.

43
0:02:38.947,000 --> 0:02:4,000
When I literally started leaving

44
0:02:40.988,000 --> 0:02:43,000
traces of my joy and freedom,

45
0:02:44.554,000 --> 0:02:45,000
it was exciting to see

46
0:02:46.502,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the interested and surprised responses from people.

47
0:02:51.004,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It seemed to open up new perspectives,

48
0:02:53.893,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and therein lay the paradigm shift.

49
0:02:56.788,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It showed that an arts practice

50
0:02:58.862,000 --> 0:03:,000
can remake one's identity

51
0:03:01.205,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and transform preconceptions by revisioning the familiar.

52
0:03:05.989,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So when I began to dive, in 2005,

53
0:03:09.902,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I realized scuba gear extends your range of activity

54
0:03:13.428,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in just the same way as a wheelchair does,

55
0:03:16.087,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but the associations attached to scuba gear

56
0:03:18.679,000 --> 0:03:2,000
are ones of excitement and adventure,

57
0:03:21.279,000 --> 0:03:24,000
completely different to people's responses to the wheelchair.

58
0:03:25.103,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So I thought, "I wonder what'll happen

59
0:03:28.247,000 --> 0:03:32,000
if I put the two together?" (Laughter) (Applause)

60
0:03:32.559,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And the underwater wheelchair that has resulted

61
0:03:36.751,000 --> 0:03:38,000
has taken me on the most amazing journey

62
0:03:39.458,000 --> 0:03:41,000
over the last seven years.

63
0:03:41.727,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So to give you an idea of what that's like,

64
0:03:45.215,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I'd like to share with you one of the outcomes

65
0:03:48.101,000 --> 0:03:5,000
from creating this spectacle,

66
0:03:50.197,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and show you what an amazing journey it's taken me on.

67
0:03:53.998,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Music)

68
0:07:23.695,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Applause)

69
0:07:30.496,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It is the most amazing experience,

70
0:07:33.475,000 --> 0:07:36,000
beyond most other things I've experienced in life.

71
0:07:37.116,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I literally have the freedom to move

72
0:07:40.213,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in 360 degrees of space

73
0:07:42.852,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and an ecstatic experience of joy and freedom.

74
0:07:46.612,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And the incredibly unexpected thing

75
0:07:49.229,000 --> 0:07:53,000
is that other people seem to see and feel that too.

76
0:07:53.419,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Their eyes literally light up,

77
0:07:55.797,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and they say things like, "I want one of those,"

78
0:07:59.051,000 --> 0:08:02,000
or, "If you can do that, I can do anything."

79
0:08:02.733,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And I'm thinking, it's because in that moment

80
0:08:06.355,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of them seeing an object

81
0:08:08.908,000 --> 0:08:09,000
they have no frame of reference for,

82
0:08:10.819,000 --> 0:08:12,000
or so transcends the frames of reference

83
0:08:13.619,000 --> 0:08:14,000
they have with the wheelchair,

84
0:08:15.364,000 --> 0:08:18,000
they have to think in a completely new way.

85
0:08:18.396,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I think that moment of completely new thought

86
0:08:22.74,000 --> 0:08:24,000
perhaps creates a freedom

87
0:08:25.238,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that spreads to the rest of other people's lives.

88
0:08:29.264,000 --> 0:08:32,000
For me, this means that they're seeing

89
0:08:32.456,000 --> 0:08:34,000
the value of difference,

90
0:08:34.806,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the joy it brings

91
0:08:36.726,000 --> 0:08:39,000
when instead of focusing on loss or limitation,

92
0:08:40.546,000 --> 0:08:44,000
we see and discover the power and joy

93
0:08:44.95,000 --> 0:08:48,000
of seeing the world from exciting new perspectives.

94
0:08:49.357,000 --> 0:08:5,000
For me, the wheelchair becomes

95
0:08:51.056,000 --> 0:08:53,000
a vehicle for transformation.

96
0:08:53.401,000 --> 0:08:56,000
In fact, I now call the underwater wheelchair "Portal,"

97
0:08:57.181,000 --> 0:08:59,000
because it's literally pushed me through

98
0:08:59.385,000 --> 0:09:,000
into a new way of being,

99
0:09:01.263,000 --> 0:09:04,000
into new dimensions and into a new level of consciousness.

100
0:09:04.997,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And the other thing is,

101
0:09:06.542,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that because nobody's seen or heard

102
0:09:09.014,000 --> 0:09:11,000
of an underwater wheelchair before,

103
0:09:11.509,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and creating this spectacle is about creating

104
0:09:14.352,000 --> 0:09:16,000
new ways of seeing, being and knowing,

105
0:09:17.189,000 --> 0:09:19,000
now you have this concept in your mind.

106
0:09:20.137,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You're all part of the artwork too.

107
0:09:23.936,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Applause)

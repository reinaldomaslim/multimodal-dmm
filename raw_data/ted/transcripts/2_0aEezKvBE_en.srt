2
0:00:16.053,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So let me ask for a show of hands.

3
0:00:18.229,000 --> 0:00:22,000
How many people here are over the age of 48?

4
0:00:22.421,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Well, there do seem to be a few.

5
0:00:25.302,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Well, congratulations,

6
0:00:27.477,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because if you look at this particular slide of U.S. life expectancy,

7
0:00:31.347,000 --> 0:00:34,000
you are now in excess of the average life span

8
0:00:34.445,000 --> 0:00:36,000
of somebody who was born in 1900.

9
0:00:37.232,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But look what happened in the course of that century.

10
0:00:40.766,000 --> 0:00:41,000
If you follow that curve,

11
0:00:42.428,000 --> 0:00:44,000
you'll see that it starts way down there.

12
0:00:45.042,000 --> 0:00:47,000
There's that dip there for the 1918 flu.

13
0:00:47.511,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And here we are at 2010,

14
0:00:49.933,000 --> 0:00:52,000
average life expectancy of a child born today, age 79,

15
0:00:52.989,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and we are not done yet.

16
0:00:54.885,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Now, that's the good news.

17
0:00:56.22,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But there's still a lot of work to do.

18
0:00:58.061,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So, for instance, if you ask,

19
0:00:59.695,000 --> 0:01:01,000
how many diseases do we now know

20
0:01:02.421,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the exact molecular basis?

21
0:01:04.48,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Turns out it's about 4,000, which is pretty amazing,

22
0:01:08.038,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because most of those molecular discoveries

23
0:01:10.274,000 --> 0:01:12,000
have just happened in the last little while.

24
0:01:12.939,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It's exciting to see that in terms of what we've learned,

25
0:01:16.235,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but how many of those 4,000 diseases

26
0:01:18.342,000 --> 0:01:2,000
now have treatments available?

27
0:01:20.69,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Only about 250.

28
0:01:22.578,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So we have this huge challenge, this huge gap.

29
0:01:25.336,000 --> 0:01:27,000
You would think this wouldn't be too hard,

30
0:01:27.916,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that we would simply have the ability

31
0:01:29.442,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to take this fundamental information that we're learning

32
0:01:32.468,000 --> 0:01:35,000
about how it is that basic biology teaches us

33
0:01:35.613,000 --> 0:01:36,000
about the causes of disease

34
0:01:37.515,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and build a bridge across this yawning gap

35
0:01:40.541,000 --> 0:01:42,000
between what we've learned about basic science

36
0:01:42.921,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and its application,

37
0:01:44.416,000 --> 0:01:47,000
a bridge that would look maybe something like this,

38
0:01:47.673,000 --> 0:01:5,000
where you'd have to put together a nice shiny way

39
0:01:51.285,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to get from one side to the other.

40
0:01:54.253,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Well, wouldn't it be nice if it was that easy?

41
0:01:56.853,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Unfortunately, it's not.

42
0:01:58.998,000 --> 0:02:,000
In reality, trying to go from fundamental knowledge

43
0:02:01.589,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to its application is more like this.

44
0:02:04.253,000 --> 0:02:05,000
There are no shiny bridges.

45
0:02:06.168,000 --> 0:02:07,000
You sort of place your bets.

46
0:02:07.82,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Maybe you've got a swimmer and a rowboat

47
0:02:09.781,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and a sailboat and a tugboat

48
0:02:11.305,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and you set them off on their way,

49
0:02:13.033,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and the rains come and the lightning flashes,

50
0:02:15.697,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and oh my gosh, there are sharks in the water

51
0:02:17.211,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and the swimmer gets into trouble,

52
0:02:19.232,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and, uh oh, the swimmer drowned

53
0:02:20.816,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and the sailboat capsized,

54
0:02:24.028,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and that tugboat, well, it hit the rocks,

55
0:02:25.729,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and maybe if you're lucky, somebody gets across.

56
0:02:28.369,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Well, what does this really look like?

57
0:02:30.358,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Well, what is it to make a therapeutic, anyway?

58
0:02:32.412,000 --> 0:02:35,000
What's a drug? A drug is made up

59
0:02:35.413,000 --> 0:02:37,000
of a small molecule of hydrogen, carbon,

60
0:02:37.738,000 --> 0:02:39,000
oxygen, nitrogen, and a few other atoms

61
0:02:39.989,000 --> 0:02:41,000
all cobbled together in a shape,

62
0:02:42.212,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and it's those shapes that determine whether, in fact,

63
0:02:44.589,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that particular drug is going to hit its target.

64
0:02:47.902,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Is it going to land where it's supposed to?

65
0:02:50.125,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So look at this picture here -- a lot of shapes dancing around for you.

66
0:02:53.281,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Now what you need to do, if you're trying to develop

67
0:02:55.668,000 --> 0:02:56,000
a new treatment for autism

68
0:02:57.125,000 --> 0:02:59,000
or Alzheimer's disease or cancer

69
0:02:59.344,000 --> 0:03:,000
is to find the right shape in that mix

70
0:03:01.136,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that will ultimately provide benefit and will be safe.

71
0:03:04.053,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And when you look at what happens to that pipeline,

72
0:03:07.22,000 --> 0:03:08,000
you start out maybe with thousands,

73
0:03:08.721,000 --> 0:03:09,000
tens of thousands of compounds.

74
0:03:10.363,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You weed down through various steps

75
0:03:12.512,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that cause many of these to fail.

76
0:03:13.895,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Ultimately, maybe you can run a clinical trial with four or five of these,

77
0:03:17.235,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and if all goes well, 14 years after you started,

78
0:03:20.277,000 --> 0:03:22,000
you will get one approval.

79
0:03:22.288,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And it will cost you upwards of a billion dollars

80
0:03:24.318,000 --> 0:03:26,000
for that one success.

81
0:03:26.462,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So we have to look at this pipeline the way an engineer would,

82
0:03:29.766,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and say, "How can we do better?"

83
0:03:30.974,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And that's the main theme of what I want to say to you this morning.

84
0:03:33.651,000 --> 0:03:34,000
How can we make this go faster?

85
0:03:35.464,000 --> 0:03:38,000
How can we make it more successful?

86
0:03:38.529,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Well, let me tell you about a few examples

87
0:03:39.87,000 --> 0:03:41,000
where this has actually worked.

88
0:03:42.126,000 --> 0:03:44,000
One that has just happened in the last few months

89
0:03:45.077,000 --> 0:03:48,000
is the successful approval of a drug for cystic fibrosis.

90
0:03:48.787,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But it's taken a long time to get there.

91
0:03:50.441,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Cystic fibrosis had its molecular cause discovered in 1989

92
0:03:55.043,000 --> 0:03:57,000
by my group working with another group in Toronto,

93
0:03:57.371,000 --> 0:03:59,000
discovering what the mutation was in a particular gene

94
0:03:59.506,000 --> 0:04:,000
on chromosome 7.

95
0:04:01.134,000 --> 0:04:03,000
That picture you see there?

96
0:04:03.172,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Here it is. That's the same kid.

97
0:04:05.275,000 --> 0:04:08,000
That's Danny Bessette, 23 years later,

98
0:04:08.619,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because this is the year,

99
0:04:09.898,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and it's also the year where Danny got married,

100
0:04:12.336,000 --> 0:04:15,000
where we have, for the first time, the approval by the FDA

101
0:04:15.393,000 --> 0:04:18,000
of a drug that precisely targets the defect in cystic fibrosis

102
0:04:19.13,000 --> 0:04:2,000
based upon all this molecular understanding.

103
0:04:21.068,000 --> 0:04:22,000
That's the good news.

104
0:04:22.492,000 --> 0:04:25,000
The bad news is, this drug doesn't actually treat all cases of cystic fibrosis,

105
0:04:26.121,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and it won't work for Danny, and we're still waiting

106
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
for that next generation to help him.

107
0:04:30.665,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But it took 23 years to get this far. That's too long.

108
0:04:33.86,000 --> 0:04:34,000
How do we go faster?

109
0:04:35.553,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Well, one way to go faster is to take advantage of technology,

110
0:04:38.251,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and a very important technology that we depend on

111
0:04:40.915,000 --> 0:04:42,000
for all of this is the human genome,

112
0:04:43.211,000 --> 0:04:45,000
the ability to be able to look at a chromosome,

113
0:04:45.799,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to unzip it, to pull out all the DNA,

114
0:04:48.469,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and to be able to then read out the letters in that DNA code,

115
0:04:51.419,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the A's, C's, G's and T's

116
0:04:53.5,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that are our instruction book and the instruction book for all living things,

117
0:04:56.771,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and the cost of doing this,

118
0:04:58.285,000 --> 0:05:,000
which used to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars,

119
0:05:00.94,000 --> 0:05:01,000
has in the course of the last 10 years

120
0:05:02.853,000 --> 0:05:04,000
fallen faster than Moore's Law, down to the point

121
0:05:05.252,000 --> 0:05:09,000
where it is less than 10,000 dollars today to have your genome sequenced, or mine,

122
0:05:09.259,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and we're headed for the $1,000 genome fairly soon.

123
0:05:13.058,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Well, that's exciting.

124
0:05:14.384,000 --> 0:05:17,000
How does that play out in terms of application to a disease?

125
0:05:18.194,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I want to tell you about another disorder.

126
0:05:20.474,000 --> 0:05:22,000
This one is a disorder which is quite rare.

127
0:05:22.786,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It's called Hutchinson-Gilford progeria,

128
0:05:25.554,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and it is the most dramatic form of premature aging.

129
0:05:28.859,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Only about one in every four million kids has this disease,

130
0:05:32.642,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and in a simple way, what happens is,

131
0:05:36.002,000 --> 0:05:38,000
because of a mutation in a particular gene,

132
0:05:38.703,000 --> 0:05:4,000
a protein is made that's toxic to the cell

133
0:05:41.37,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and it causes these individuals to age

134
0:05:43.667,000 --> 0:05:45,000
at about seven times the normal rate.

135
0:05:46.251,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Let me show you a video of what that does to the cell.

136
0:05:49.394,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The normal cell, if you looked at it under the microscope,

137
0:05:52.529,000 --> 0:05:54,000
would have a nucleus sitting in the middle of the cell,

138
0:05:55.418,000 --> 0:05:58,000
which is nice and round and smooth in its boundaries

139
0:05:59.297,000 --> 0:06:,000
and it looks kind of like that.

140
0:06:01.052,000 --> 0:06:02,000
A progeria cell, on the other hand,

141
0:06:02.916,000 --> 0:06:05,000
because of this toxic protein called progerin,

142
0:06:06.018,000 --> 0:06:08,000
has these lumps and bumps in it.

143
0:06:08.302,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So what we would like to do after discovering this

144
0:06:11.317,000 --> 0:06:12,000
back in 2003

145
0:06:13.169,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is to come up with a way to try to correct that.

146
0:06:16.387,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Well again, by knowing something about the molecular pathways,

147
0:06:19.475,000 --> 0:06:2,000
it was possible to pick

148
0:06:21.474,000 --> 0:06:23,000
one of those many, many compounds that might have been useful

149
0:06:24.091,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and try it out.

150
0:06:25.552,000 --> 0:06:27,000
In an experiment done in cell culture

151
0:06:28.127,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and shown here in a cartoon,

152
0:06:30.169,000 --> 0:06:32,000
if you take that particular compound

153
0:06:32.863,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and you add it to that cell that has progeria,

154
0:06:36.119,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and you watch to see what happened,

155
0:06:38.34,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in just 72 hours, that cell becomes,

156
0:06:41.302,000 --> 0:06:43,000
for all purposes that we can determine,

157
0:06:43.57,000 --> 0:06:44,000
almost like a normal cell.

158
0:06:45.412,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Well that was exciting, but would it actually work in a real human being?

159
0:06:49.753,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This has led, in the space of only four years

160
0:06:53.138,000 --> 0:06:56,000
from the time the gene was discovered to the start of a clinical trial,

161
0:06:56.639,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to a test of that very compound.

162
0:06:58.836,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And the kids that you see here

163
0:07:00.799,000 --> 0:07:02,000
all volunteered to be part of this,

164
0:07:03.361,000 --> 0:07:04,000
28 of them,

165
0:07:04.822,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and you can see as soon as the picture comes up

166
0:07:07.917,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that they are in fact a remarkable group of young people

167
0:07:11.299,000 --> 0:07:12,000
all afflicted by this disease,

168
0:07:12.718,000 --> 0:07:14,000
all looking quite similar to each other.

169
0:07:14.967,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And instead of telling you more about it,

170
0:07:16.641,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I'm going to invite one of them, Sam Berns from Boston,

171
0:07:20.627,000 --> 0:07:22,000
who's here this morning, to come up on the stage

172
0:07:23.06,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and tell us about his experience

173
0:07:25.28,000 --> 0:07:26,000
as a child affected with progeria.

174
0:07:27.19,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Sam is 15 years old. His parents, Scott Berns and Leslie Gordon,

175
0:07:31.248,000 --> 0:07:33,000
both physicians, are here with us this morning as well.

176
0:07:33.369,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Sam, please have a seat.

177
0:07:35.907,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Applause)

178
0:07:43.227,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So Sam, why don't you tell these folks

179
0:07:45.405,000 --> 0:07:48,000
what it's like being affected with this condition called progeria?

180
0:07:48.78,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Sam Burns: Well, progeria limits me in some ways.

181
0:07:52.588,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I cannot play sports or do physical activities,

182
0:07:56.552,000 --> 0:07:59,000
but I have been able to take interest in things

183
0:07:59.756,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that progeria, luckily, does not limit.

184
0:08:02.735,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But when there is something that I really do want to do

185
0:08:05.292,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that progeria gets in the way of, like marching band

186
0:08:08.309,000 --> 0:08:11,000
or umpiring, we always find a way to do it,

187
0:08:11.735,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and that just shows that progeria isn't in control of my life.

188
0:08:15.252,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Applause)

189
0:08:16.962,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Francis Collins: So what would you like to say to researchers

190
0:08:18.998,000 --> 0:08:21,000
here in the auditorium and others listening to this?

191
0:08:22.095,000 --> 0:08:24,000
What would you say to them both about research on progeria

192
0:08:24.692,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and maybe about other conditions as well?

193
0:08:26.578,000 --> 0:08:29,000
SB: Well, research on progeria has come so far

194
0:08:29.724,000 --> 0:08:31,000
in less than 15 years,

195
0:08:31.966,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and that just shows the drive that researchers can have

196
0:08:36.335,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to get this far, and it really means a lot

197
0:08:39.753,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to myself and other kids with progeria,

198
0:08:43.004,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and it shows that if that drive exists,

199
0:08:45.828,000 --> 0:08:47,000
anybody can cure any disease,

200
0:08:48.429,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and hopefully progeria can be cured in the near future,

201
0:08:52.376,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and so we can eliminate those 4,000 diseases

202
0:08:56.133,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that Francis was talking about.

203
0:08:59.14,000 --> 0:09:02,000
FC: Excellent. So Sam took the day off from school today

204
0:09:02.269,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to be here, and he is — (Applause) --

205
0:09:07.404,000 --> 0:09:11,000
He is, by the way, a straight-A+ student in the ninth grade

206
0:09:12.22,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in his school in Boston.

207
0:09:13.553,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Please join me in thanking and welcoming Sam.

208
0:09:15.754,000 --> 0:09:18,000
SB: Thank you very much. FC: Well done. Well done, buddy.

209
0:09:19.407,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Applause)

210
0:09:32.216,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So I just want to say a couple more things

211
0:09:33.932,000 --> 0:09:36,000
about that particular story, and then try to generalize

212
0:09:37.064,000 --> 0:09:39,000
how could we have stories of success

213
0:09:39.56,000 --> 0:09:42,000
all over the place for these diseases, as Sam says,

214
0:09:43.073,000 --> 0:09:45,000
these 4,000 that are waiting for answers.

215
0:09:45.592,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You might have noticed that the drug

216
0:09:47.464,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that is now in clinical trial for progeria

217
0:09:50.233,000 --> 0:09:51,000
is not a drug that was designed for that.

218
0:09:51.997,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's such a rare disease, it would be hard for a company

219
0:09:54.859,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to justify spending hundreds of millions of dollars to generate a drug.

220
0:09:58.589,000 --> 0:10:,000
This is a drug that was developed for cancer.

221
0:10:00.749,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Turned out, it didn't work very well for cancer,

222
0:10:02.914,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but it has exactly the right properties, the right shape,

223
0:10:05.237,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to work for progeria, and that's what's happened.

224
0:10:08.129,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Wouldn't it be great if we could do that more systematically?

225
0:10:11.357,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Could we, in fact, encourage all the companies that are out there

226
0:10:15.153,000 --> 0:10:16,000
that have drugs in their freezers

227
0:10:16.991,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that are known to be safe in humans

228
0:10:19.193,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but have never actually succeeded in terms

229
0:10:21.485,000 --> 0:10:23,000
of being effective for the treatments they were tried for?

230
0:10:24.341,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Now we're learning about all these new molecular pathways --

231
0:10:26.725,000 --> 0:10:29,000
some of those could be repositioned or repurposed,

232
0:10:29.804,000 --> 0:10:31,000
or whatever word you want to use, for new applications,

233
0:10:32.203,000 --> 0:10:34,000
basically teaching old drugs new tricks.

234
0:10:35.172,000 --> 0:10:37,000
That could be a phenomenal, valuable activity.

235
0:10:37.859,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We have many discussions now between NIH and companies

236
0:10:40.905,000 --> 0:10:42,000
about doing this that are looking very promising.

237
0:10:43.029,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And you could expect quite a lot to come from this.

238
0:10:45.643,000 --> 0:10:48,000
There are quite a number of success stories one can point to

239
0:10:48.682,000 --> 0:10:5,000
about how this has led to major advances.

240
0:10:51.035,000 --> 0:10:53,000
The first drug for HIV/AIDS

241
0:10:53.242,000 --> 0:10:54,000
was not developed for HIV/AIDS.

242
0:10:54.971,000 --> 0:10:56,000
It was developed for cancer. It was AZT.

243
0:10:57.489,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It didn't work very well for cancer, but became

244
0:10:59.49,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the first successful antiretroviral,

245
0:11:01.606,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and you can see from the table there are others as well.

246
0:11:04.178,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So how do we actually make that a more generalizable effort?

247
0:11:07.822,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Well, we have to come up with a partnership

248
0:11:10.046,000 --> 0:11:12,000
between academia, government, the private sector,

249
0:11:12.906,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and patient organizations to make that so.

250
0:11:15.359,000 --> 0:11:16,000
At NIH, we have started this new

251
0:11:17.009,000 --> 0:11:2,000
National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.

252
0:11:20.209,000 --> 0:11:23,000
It just started last December, and this is one of its goals.

253
0:11:23.824,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Let me tell you another thing we could do.

254
0:11:25.265,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Wouldn't it be nice to be able to a test a drug

255
0:11:28.184,000 --> 0:11:3,000
to see if it's effective and safe

256
0:11:30.555,000 --> 0:11:32,000
without having to put patients at risk,

257
0:11:32.656,000 --> 0:11:34,000
because that first time you're never quite sure?

258
0:11:35.209,000 --> 0:11:37,000
How do we know, for instance, whether drugs are safe

259
0:11:37.36,000 --> 0:11:4,000
before we give them to people? We test them on animals.

260
0:11:40.605,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And it's not all that reliable, and it's costly,

261
0:11:43.247,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and it's time-consuming.

262
0:11:44.937,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Suppose we could do this instead on human cells.

263
0:11:47.8,000 --> 0:11:49,000
You probably know, if you've been paying attention

264
0:11:50.032,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to some of the science literature

265
0:11:51.332,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that you can now take a skin cell

266
0:11:52.988,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and encourage it to become a liver cell

267
0:11:55.869,000 --> 0:11:58,000
or a heart cell or a kidney cell or a brain cell for any of us.

268
0:11:58.944,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So what if you used those cells as your test

269
0:12:02.096,000 --> 0:12:04,000
for whether a drug is going to work and whether it's going to be safe?

270
0:12:05.041,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Here you see a picture of a lung on a chip.

271
0:12:09.272,000 --> 0:12:12,000
This is something created by the Wyss Institute in Boston,

272
0:12:12.793,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and what they have done here, if we can run the little video,

273
0:12:15.968,000 --> 0:12:17,000
is to take cells from an individual,

274
0:12:18.104,000 --> 0:12:21,000
turn them into the kinds of cells that are present in the lung,

275
0:12:21.213,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and determine what would happen

276
0:12:23.018,000 --> 0:12:26,000
if you added to this various drug compounds

277
0:12:26.095,000 --> 0:12:28,000
to see if they are toxic or safe.

278
0:12:28.56,000 --> 0:12:3,000
You can see this chip even breathes.

279
0:12:30.831,000 --> 0:12:32,000
It has an air channel. It has a blood channel.

280
0:12:33.448,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And it has cells in between

281
0:12:35.151,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that allow you to see what happens when you add a compound.

282
0:12:37.589,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Are those cells happy or not?

283
0:12:39.361,000 --> 0:12:42,000
You can do this same kind of chip technology

284
0:12:42.392,000 --> 0:12:44,000
for kidneys, for hearts, for muscles,

285
0:12:44.601,000 --> 0:12:46,000
all the places where you want to see whether a drug

286
0:12:47.065,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is going to be a problem, for the liver.

287
0:12:49.346,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And ultimately, because you can do this for the individual,

288
0:12:52.394,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we could even see this moving to the point

289
0:12:54.608,000 --> 0:12:57,000
where the ability to develop and test medicines

290
0:12:58.049,000 --> 0:13:01,000
will be you on a chip, what we're trying to say here is

291
0:13:01.235,000 --> 0:13:04,000
the individualizing of the process of developing drugs

292
0:13:04.736,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and testing their safety.

293
0:13:06.984,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So let me sum up.

294
0:13:08.636,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We are in a remarkable moment here.

295
0:13:10.896,000 --> 0:13:12,000
For me, at NIH now for almost 20 years,

296
0:13:12.999,000 --> 0:13:14,000
there has never been a time where there was more excitement

297
0:13:15.6,000 --> 0:13:17,000
about the potential that lies in front of us.

298
0:13:18.185,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We have made all these discoveries

299
0:13:19.977,000 --> 0:13:21,000
pouring out of laboratories across the world.

300
0:13:22.342,000 --> 0:13:25,000
What do we need to capitalize on this? First of all, we need resources.

301
0:13:25.704,000 --> 0:13:28,000
This is research that's high-risk, sometimes high-cost.

302
0:13:29.259,000 --> 0:13:3,000
The payoff is enormous, both in terms of health

303
0:13:31.23,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and in terms of economic growth. We need to support that.

304
0:13:34.11,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Second, we need new kinds of partnerships

305
0:13:36.411,000 --> 0:13:38,000
between academia and government and the private sector

306
0:13:38.632,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and patient organizations, just like the one I've been describing here,

307
0:13:41.979,000 --> 0:13:44,000
in terms of the way in which we could go after repurposing new compounds.

308
0:13:45.559,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And third, and maybe most important, we need talent.

309
0:13:48.795,000 --> 0:13:5,000
We need the best and the brightest

310
0:13:50.936,000 --> 0:13:52,000
from many different disciplines to come and join this effort --

311
0:13:53.793,000 --> 0:13:55,000
all ages, all different groups --

312
0:13:56.239,000 --> 0:13:58,000
because this is the time, folks.

313
0:13:58.326,000 --> 0:14:01,000
This is the 21st-century biology that you've been waiting for,

314
0:14:01.951,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and we have the chance to take that

315
0:14:04.413,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and turn it into something which will, in fact,

316
0:14:06.903,000 --> 0:14:08,000
knock out disease. That's my goal.

317
0:14:09.233,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I hope that's your goal.

318
0:14:11.117,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I think it'll be the goal of the poets and the muppets

319
0:14:13.797,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and the surfers and the bankers

320
0:14:15.806,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and all the other people who join this stage

321
0:14:18.084,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and think about what we're trying to do here

322
0:14:19.834,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and why it matters.

323
0:14:20.999,000 --> 0:14:22,000
It matters for now. It matters as soon as possible.

324
0:14:23.769,000 --> 0:14:26,000
If you don't believe me, just ask Sam.

325
0:14:26.887,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Thank you all very much.

326
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Applause)

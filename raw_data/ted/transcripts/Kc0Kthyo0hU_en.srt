1
0:00:12.804,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What is it that French people do better than all the others?

2
0:00:18.454,000 --> 0:00:19,000
If you would take polls,

3
0:00:20.404,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the top three answers might be:

4
0:00:22.235,000 --> 0:00:26,000
love, wine and whining.

5
0:00:26.298,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:27.623,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Maybe.

7
0:00:29.53,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But let me suggest a fourth one:

8
0:00:31.892,000 --> 0:00:32,000
mathematics.

9
0:00:33.76,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Did you know that Paris has more mathematicians

10
0:00:36.637,000 --> 0:00:37,000
than any other city in the world?

11
0:00:38.801,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And more streets with mathematicians' names, too.

12
0:00:42.215,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And if you look at the statistics of the Fields Medal,

13
0:00:45.688,000 --> 0:00:47,000
often called the Nobel Prize for mathematics,

14
0:00:48.205,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and always awarded to mathematicians below the age of 40,

15
0:00:52.161,000 --> 0:00:55,000
you will find that France has more Fields medalists per inhabitant

16
0:00:56.072,000 --> 0:00:57,000
than any other country.

17
0:00:58.286,000 --> 0:01:,000
What is it that we find so sexy in math?

18
0:01:02.153,000 --> 0:01:05,000
After all, it seems to be dull and abstract,

19
0:01:05.381,000 --> 0:01:08,000
just numbers and computations and rules to apply.

20
0:01:10.518,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Mathematics may be abstract,

21
0:01:12.654,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but it's not dull

22
0:01:13.829,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and it's not about computing.

23
0:01:16.178,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It is about reasoning

24
0:01:17.949,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and proving our core activity.

25
0:01:20.513,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It is about imagination,

26
0:01:22.059,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the talent which we most praise.

27
0:01:24.102,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It is about finding the truth.

28
0:01:27.613,000 --> 0:01:29,000
There's nothing like the feeling which invades you

29
0:01:30.374,000 --> 0:01:32,000
when after months of hard thinking,

30
0:01:32.569,000 --> 0:01:35,000
you finally understand the right reasoning to solve your problem.

31
0:01:37.042,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The great mathematician André Weil likened this --

32
0:01:40.642,000 --> 0:01:41,000
no kidding --

33
0:01:41.817,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to sexual pleasure.

34
0:01:44.197,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But noted that this feeling can last for hours, or even days.

35
0:01:50.804,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The reward may be big.

36
0:01:53.325,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Hidden mathematical truths permeate our whole physical world.

37
0:01:57.68,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They are inaccessible to our senses

38
0:02:00.374,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but can be seen through mathematical lenses.

39
0:02:04.092,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Close your eyes for moment

40
0:02:05.708,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and think of what is occurring right now around you.

41
0:02:10.337,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Invisible particles from the air around are bumping on you

42
0:02:13.854,000 --> 0:02:15,000
by the billions and billions at each second,

43
0:02:16.611,000 --> 0:02:18,000
all in complete chaos.

44
0:02:19.049,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And still,

45
0:02:20.224,000 --> 0:02:24,000
their statistics can be accurately predicted by mathematical physics.

46
0:02:25.715,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And open your eyes now

47
0:02:28.531,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to the statistics of the velocities of these particles.

48
0:02:32.51,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The famous bell-shaped Gauss Curve,

49
0:02:35.774,000 --> 0:02:37,000
or the Law of Errors --

50
0:02:37.979,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of deviations with respect to the mean behavior.

51
0:02:41.55,000 --> 0:02:45,000
This curve tells about the statistics of velocities of particles

52
0:02:45.876,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in the same way as a demographic curve

53
0:02:48.439,000 --> 0:02:51,000
would tell about the statistics of ages of individuals.

54
0:02:52.884,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It's one of the most important curves ever.

55
0:02:56.137,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It keeps on occurring again and again,

56
0:02:59.347,000 --> 0:03:01,000
from many theories and many experiments,

57
0:03:01.774,000 --> 0:03:04,000
as a great example of the universality

58
0:03:05.079,000 --> 0:03:08,000
which is so dear to us mathematicians.

59
0:03:09.694,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Of this curve,

60
0:03:10.945,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the famous scientist Francis Galton said,

61
0:03:14.018,000 --> 0:03:18,000
"It would have been deified by the Greeks if they had known it.

62
0:03:19.064,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It is the supreme law of unreason."

63
0:03:23.818,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And there's no better way to materialize that supreme goddess than Galton's Board.

64
0:03:31.774,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Inside this board are narrow tunnels

65
0:03:34.995,000 --> 0:03:38,000
through which tiny balls will fall down randomly,

66
0:03:40.295,000 --> 0:03:45,000
going right or left, or left, etc.

67
0:03:46.139,000 --> 0:03:49,000
All in complete randomness and chaos.

68
0:03:50.085,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Let's see what happens when we look at all these random trajectories together.

69
0:03:56.189,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Board shaking)

70
0:04:01.648,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This is a bit of a sport,

71
0:04:04.516,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because we need to resolve some traffic jams in there.

72
0:04:11.715,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Aha.

73
0:04:13.313,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We think that randomness is going to play me a trick on stage.

74
0:04:19.609,000 --> 0:04:2,000
There it is.

75
0:04:22.382,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Our supreme goddess of unreason.

76
0:04:24.989,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the Gauss Curve,

77
0:04:26.532,000 --> 0:04:32,000
trapped here inside this transparent box as Dream in "The Sandman" comics.

78
0:04:34.623,000 --> 0:04:36,000
For you I have shown it,

79
0:04:37.345,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but to my students I explain why it could not be any other curve.

80
0:04:43.128,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And this is touching the mystery of that goddess,

81
0:04:46.022,000 --> 0:04:5,000
replacing a beautiful coincidence by a beautiful explanation.

82
0:04:51.027,000 --> 0:04:53,000
All of science is like this.

83
0:04:54.213,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And beautiful mathematical explanations are not only for our pleasure.

84
0:04:59.585,000 --> 0:05:01,000
They also change our vision of the world.

85
0:05:03.04,000 --> 0:05:04,000
For instance,

86
0:05:04.301,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Einstein,

87
0:05:05.476,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Perrin,

88
0:05:06.651,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Smoluchowski,

89
0:05:07.826,000 --> 0:05:1,000
they used the mathematical analysis of random trajectories

90
0:05:11.409,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and the Gauss Curve

91
0:05:13.47,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to explain and prove that our world is made of atoms.

92
0:05:19.524,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It was not the first time

93
0:05:21.35,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that mathematics was revolutionizing our view of the world.

94
0:05:25.555,000 --> 0:05:27,000
More than 2,000 years ago,

95
0:05:27.791,000 --> 0:05:29,000
at the time of the ancient Greeks,

96
0:05:31.502,000 --> 0:05:32,000
it already occurred.

97
0:05:33.827,000 --> 0:05:34,000
In those days,

98
0:05:35.137,000 --> 0:05:38,000
only a small fraction of the world had been explored,

99
0:05:38.444,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and the Earth might have seemed infinite.

100
0:05:42.034,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But clever Eratosthenes,

101
0:05:43.825,000 --> 0:05:44,000
using mathematics,

102
0:05:45.266,000 --> 0:05:5,000
was able to measure the Earth with an amazing accuracy of two percent.

103
0:05:51.969,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Here's another example.

104
0:05:54.238,000 --> 0:05:57,000
In 1673, Jean Richer noticed

105
0:05:58.067,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that a pendulum swings slightly slower in Cayenne than in Paris.

106
0:06:06.35,000 --> 0:06:1,000
From this observation alone, and clever mathematics,

107
0:06:10.774,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Newton rightly deduced

108
0:06:13.104,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that the Earth is a wee bit flattened at the poles,

109
0:06:18.669,000 --> 0:06:19,000
like 0.3 percent --

110
0:06:20.843,000 --> 0:06:24,000
so tiny that you wouldn't even notice it on the real view of the Earth.

111
0:06:26.276,000 --> 0:06:29,000
These stories show that mathematics

112
0:06:30.228,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is able to make us go out of our intuition

113
0:06:35.512,000 --> 0:06:38,000
measure the Earth which seems infinite,

114
0:06:39.021,000 --> 0:06:41,000
see atoms which are invisible

115
0:06:41.339,000 --> 0:06:44,000
or detect an imperceptible variation of shape.

116
0:06:44.744,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And if there is just one thing that you should take home from this talk,

117
0:06:48.615,000 --> 0:06:49,000
it is this:

118
0:06:49.833,000 --> 0:06:53,000
mathematics allows us to go beyond the intuition

119
0:06:54.235,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and explore territories which do not fit within our grasp.

120
0:06:59.609,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Here's a modern example you will all relate to:

121
0:07:03.362,000 --> 0:07:04,000
searching the Internet.

122
0:07:06.037,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The World Wide Web,

123
0:07:07.403,000 --> 0:07:08,000
more than one billion web pages --

124
0:07:09.231,000 --> 0:07:1,000
do you want to go through them all?

125
0:07:11.66,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Computing power helps,

126
0:07:13.486,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but it would be useless without the mathematical modeling

127
0:07:16.696,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to find the information hidden in the data.

128
0:07:20.491,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Let's work out a baby problem.

129
0:07:23.872,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Imagine that you're a detective working on a crime case,

130
0:07:27.703,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and there are many people who have their version of the facts.

131
0:07:32.032,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Who do you want to interview first?

132
0:07:34.681,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Sensible answer:

133
0:07:36.62,000 --> 0:07:37,000
prime witnesses.

134
0:07:38.878,000 --> 0:07:39,000
You see,

135
0:07:40.136,000 --> 0:07:44,000
suppose that there is person number seven,

136
0:07:44.38,000 --> 0:07:45,000
tells you a story,

137
0:07:45.555,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but when you ask where he got if from,

138
0:07:47.593,000 --> 0:07:5,000
he points to person number three as a source.

139
0:07:50.653,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And maybe person number three, in turn,

140
0:07:52.745,000 --> 0:07:55,000
points at person number one as the primary source.

141
0:07:56.465,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Now number one is a prime witness,

142
0:07:58.15,000 --> 0:08:01,000
so I definitely want to interview him -- priority.

143
0:08:02.148,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And from the graph

144
0:08:03.323,000 --> 0:08:06,000
we also see that person number four is a prime witness.

145
0:08:06.575,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And maybe I even want to interview him first,

146
0:08:09.042,000 --> 0:08:11,000
because there are more people who refer to him.

147
0:08:12.354,000 --> 0:08:14,000
OK, that was easy,

148
0:08:15.042,000 --> 0:08:2,000
but now what about if you have a big bunch of people who will testify?

149
0:08:20.864,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And this graph,

150
0:08:22.24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I may think of it as all people who testify in a complicated crime case,

151
0:08:27.883,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but it may just as well be web pages pointing to each other,

152
0:08:31.929,000 --> 0:08:33,000
referring to each other for contents.

153
0:08:34.878,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Which ones are the most authoritative?

154
0:08:37.587,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Not so clear.

155
0:08:40.091,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Enter PageRank,

156
0:08:42.015,000 --> 0:08:44,000
one of the early cornerstones of Google.

157
0:08:45.337,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This algorithm uses the laws of mathematical randomness

158
0:08:49.603,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to determine automatically the most relevant web pages,

159
0:08:53.484,000 --> 0:08:58,000
in the same way as we used randomness in the Galton Board experiment.

160
0:08:59.341,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So let's send into this graph

161
0:09:01.706,000 --> 0:09:03,000
a bunch of tiny, digital marbles

162
0:09:04.58,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and let them go randomly through the graph.

163
0:09:08.353,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Each time they arrive at some site,

164
0:09:10.044,000 --> 0:09:14,000
they will go out through some link chosen at random to the next one.

165
0:09:14.234,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And again, and again, and again.

166
0:09:16.358,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And with small, growing piles,

167
0:09:18.01,000 --> 0:09:21,000
we'll keep the record of how many times each site has been visited

168
0:09:21.787,000 --> 0:09:22,000
by these digital marbles.

169
0:09:24.243,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Here we go.

170
0:09:25.418,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Randomness, randomness.

171
0:09:27.811,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And from time to time,

172
0:09:29.283,000 --> 0:09:32,000
also let's make jumps completely randomly to increase the fun.

173
0:09:34.471,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And look at this:

174
0:09:36.358,000 --> 0:09:38,000
from the chaos will emerge the solution.

175
0:09:39.483,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The highest piles correspond to those sites

176
0:09:41.992,000 --> 0:09:44,000
which somehow are better connected than the others,

177
0:09:45.527,000 --> 0:09:47,000
more pointed at than the others.

178
0:09:47.824,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And here we see clearly

179
0:09:49.57,000 --> 0:09:52,000
which are the web pages we want to first try.

180
0:09:53.507,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Once again,

181
0:09:54.682,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the solution emerges from the randomness.

182
0:09:57.775,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Of course, since that time,

183
0:10:00.05,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Google has come up with much more sophisticated algorithms,

184
0:10:03.781,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but already this was beautiful.

185
0:10:06.981,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And still,

186
0:10:08.481,000 --> 0:10:09,000
just one problem in a million.

187
0:10:10.734,000 --> 0:10:12,000
With the advent of digital area,

188
0:10:13.028,000 --> 0:10:18,000
more and more problems lend themselves to mathematical analysis,

189
0:10:18.068,000 --> 0:10:22,000
making the job of mathematician a more and more useful one,

190
0:10:23.166,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to the extent that a few years ago,

191
0:10:25.912,000 --> 0:10:28,000
it was ranked number one among hundreds of jobs

192
0:10:29.715,000 --> 0:10:32,000
in a study about the best and worst jobs

193
0:10:33.707,000 --> 0:10:35,000
published by the Wall Street Journal in 2009.

194
0:10:37.445,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Mathematician --

195
0:10:39.321,000 --> 0:10:4,000
best job in the world.

196
0:10:41.646,000 --> 0:10:44,000
That's because of the applications:

197
0:10:44.738,000 --> 0:10:46,000
communication theory,

198
0:10:46.901,000 --> 0:10:47,000
information theory,

199
0:10:48.745,000 --> 0:10:49,000
game theory,

200
0:10:50.029,000 --> 0:10:51,000
compressed sensing,

201
0:10:51.499,000 --> 0:10:52,000
machine learning,

202
0:10:53.085,000 --> 0:10:54,000
graph analysis,

203
0:10:54.676,000 --> 0:10:55,000
harmonic analysis.

204
0:10:56.442,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And why not stochastic processes,

205
0:10:59.106,000 --> 0:11:,000
linear programming,

206
0:11:00.76,000 --> 0:11:02,000
or fluid simulation?

207
0:11:03.292,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Each of these fields have monster industrial applications.

208
0:11:07.211,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And through them,

209
0:11:08.386,000 --> 0:11:09,000
there is big money in mathematics.

210
0:11:11.4,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And let me concede

211
0:11:13.464,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that when it comes to making money from the math,

212
0:11:15.965,000 --> 0:11:18,000
the Americans are by a long shot the world champions,

213
0:11:19.813,000 --> 0:11:23,000
with clever, emblematic billionaires and amazing, giant companies,

214
0:11:24.456,000 --> 0:11:27,000
all resting, ultimately, on good algorithm.

215
0:11:29.091,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Now with all this beauty, usefulness and wealth,

216
0:11:33.087,000 --> 0:11:35,000
mathematics does look more sexy.

217
0:11:36.399,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But don't you think

218
0:11:38.04,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that the life a mathematical researcher is an easy one.

219
0:11:42.959,000 --> 0:11:44,000
It is filled with perplexity,

220
0:11:46.347,000 --> 0:11:47,000
frustration,

221
0:11:48.172,000 --> 0:11:5,000
a desperate fight for understanding.

222
0:11:51.955,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Let me evoke for you

223
0:11:54.119,000 --> 0:11:58,000
one of the most striking days in my mathematician's life.

224
0:11:58.523,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Or should I say,

225
0:11:59.698,000 --> 0:12:,000
one of the most striking nights.

226
0:12:02.713,000 --> 0:12:03,000
At that time,

227
0:12:03.888,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I was staying at the Institute for Advanced Studies in Princeton --

228
0:12:07.063,000 --> 0:12:09,000
for many years, the home of Albert Einstein

229
0:12:09.226,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and arguably the most holy place for mathematical research in the world.

230
0:12:14.878,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And that night I was working and working on an elusive proof,

231
0:12:18.746,000 --> 0:12:19,000
which was incomplete.

232
0:12:21.304,000 --> 0:12:23,000
It was all about understanding

233
0:12:23.536,000 --> 0:12:26,000
the paradoxical stability property of plasmas,

234
0:12:27.383,000 --> 0:12:28,000
which are a crowd of electrons.

235
0:12:30.423,000 --> 0:12:32,000
In the perfect world of plasma,

236
0:12:33.183,000 --> 0:12:34,000
there are no collisions

237
0:12:34.985,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and no friction to provide the stability like we are used to.

238
0:12:39.392,000 --> 0:12:4,000
But still,

239
0:12:40.567,000 --> 0:12:43,000
if you slightly perturb a plasma equilibrium,

240
0:12:43.624,000 --> 0:12:45,000
you will find that the resulting electric field

241
0:12:46.336,000 --> 0:12:48,000
spontaneously vanishes,

242
0:12:48.699,000 --> 0:12:49,000
or damps out,

243
0:12:50.698,000 --> 0:12:53,000
as if by some mysterious friction force.

244
0:12:54.728,000 --> 0:12:55,000
This paradoxical effect,

245
0:12:56.587,000 --> 0:12:57,000
called the Landau damping,

246
0:12:58.088,000 --> 0:13:,000
is one of the most important in plasma physics,

247
0:13:01.101,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and it was discovered through mathematical ideas.

248
0:13:04.97,000 --> 0:13:05,000
But still,

249
0:13:06.145,000 --> 0:13:1,000
a full mathematical understanding of this phenomenon was missing.

250
0:13:10.399,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And together with my former student and main collaborator Clément Mouhot,

251
0:13:15.209,000 --> 0:13:16,000
in Paris at the time,

252
0:13:16.725,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we had been working for months and months on such a proof.

253
0:13:21.832,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Actually,

254
0:13:23.191,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I had already announced by mistake that we could solve it.

255
0:13:27.961,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But the truth is,

256
0:13:29.71,000 --> 0:13:31,000
the proof was just not working.

257
0:13:32.196,000 --> 0:13:36,000
In spite of more than 100 pages of complicated, mathematical arguments,

258
0:13:36.569,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and a bunch discoveries,

259
0:13:38.283,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and huge calculation,

260
0:13:39.574,000 --> 0:13:4,000
it was not working.

261
0:13:41.29,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And that night in Princeton,

262
0:13:42.995,000 --> 0:13:46,000
a certain gap in the chain of arguments was driving me crazy.

263
0:13:47.658,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I was putting in there all my energy and experience and tricks,

264
0:13:52.275,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and still nothing was working.

265
0:13:54.553,000 --> 0:13:57,000
1 a.m., 2 a.m., 3 a.m.,

266
0:13:58.459,000 --> 0:13:59,000
not working.

267
0:14:00.545,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Around 4 a.m., I go to bed in low spirits.

268
0:14:05.915,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Then a few hours later,

269
0:14:08.399,000 --> 0:14:09,000
waking up and go,

270
0:14:09.574,000 --> 0:14:12,000
"Ah, it's time to get the kids to school --"

271
0:14:12.955,000 --> 0:14:13,000
What is this?

272
0:14:14.13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
There was this voice in my head, I swear.

273
0:14:16.894,000 --> 0:14:17,000
"Take the second term to the other side,

274
0:14:18.831,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Fourier transform and invert in L2."

275
0:14:21.257,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Laughter)

276
0:14:22.432,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Damn it,

277
0:14:24.158,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that was the start of the solution!

278
0:14:27.519,000 --> 0:14:28,000
You see,

279
0:14:28.694,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I thought I had taken some rest,

280
0:14:31.001,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but really my brain had continued to work on it.

281
0:14:35.008,000 --> 0:14:36,000
In those moments,

282
0:14:36.629,000 --> 0:14:38,000
you don't think of your career or your colleagues,

283
0:14:39.254,000 --> 0:14:42,000
it's just a complete battle between the problem and you.

284
0:14:44.098,000 --> 0:14:45,000
That being said,

285
0:14:45.45,000 --> 0:14:48,000
it does not harm when you do get a promotion in reward for your hard work.

286
0:14:49.808,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And after we completed our huge analysis of the Landau damping,

287
0:14:54.992,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I was lucky enough

288
0:14:56.631,000 --> 0:14:59,000
to get the most coveted Fields Medal

289
0:14:59.685,000 --> 0:15:01,000
from the hands of the President of India,

290
0:15:02.576,000 --> 0:15:05,000
in Hyderabad on 19 August, 2010 --

291
0:15:07.453,000 --> 0:15:1,000
an honor that mathematicians never dare to dream,

292
0:15:10.728,000 --> 0:15:12,000
a day that I will remember until I live.

293
0:15:14.366,000 --> 0:15:15,000
What do you think,

294
0:15:15.837,000 --> 0:15:17,000
on such an occasion?

295
0:15:18.002,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Pride, yes?

296
0:15:19.791,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And gratitude to the many collaborators who made this possible.

297
0:15:24.304,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And because it was a collective adventure,

298
0:15:26.54,000 --> 0:15:3,000
you need to share it, not just with your collaborators.

299
0:15:31.548,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I believe that everybody can appreciate the thrill of mathematical research,

300
0:15:37.264,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and share the passionate stories of humans and ideas behind it.

301
0:15:42.494,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And I've been working with my staff at Institut Henri Poincaré,

302
0:15:47.292,000 --> 0:15:52,000
together with partners and artists of mathematical communication worldwide,

303
0:15:52.497,000 --> 0:15:56,000
so that we can found our own, very special museum of mathematics there.

304
0:15:58.537,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So in a few years,

305
0:16:00.885,000 --> 0:16:01,000
when you come to Paris,

306
0:16:02.486,000 --> 0:16:07,000
after tasting the great, crispy baguette and macaroon,

307
0:16:08.168,000 --> 0:16:11,000
please come and visit us at Institut Henri Poincaré,

308
0:16:11.856,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and share the mathematical dream with us.

309
0:16:14.395,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Thank you.

310
0:16:15.57,000 --> 0:16:22,000
(Applause)

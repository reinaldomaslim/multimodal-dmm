1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I was born in 1947, a long time ago,

2
0:00:17.28,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and when I was 18 months old, I had polio.

3
0:00:21.68,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was in an iron lung for three months

4
0:00:24.6,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and in and out of the hospital for three years.

5
0:00:27.96,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now, we had lots of neighbors in our Brooklyn neighborhood,

6
0:00:31.4,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and some of them were really very helpful for my parents.

7
0:00:35.32,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Some of them were really afraid of contagion,

8
0:00:39.04,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and they wouldn't even walk in front of our house.

9
0:00:42.28,000 --> 0:00:44,000
They would literally walk across the street.

10
0:00:45.68,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I think this was a time when my family really began to realize

11
0:00:50.68,000 --> 0:00:52,000
what disability meant to some people:

12
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
fear.

13
0:00:55.08,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And it wasn't even a sure thing that I would live at home,

14
0:00:59.4,000 --> 0:01:02,000
although I didn't learn about this until I was 36 years old.

15
0:01:02.76,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I was having a discussion with my father one night,

16
0:01:05.68,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and he said, "You know, when you were two years old,

17
0:01:08.72,000 --> 0:01:1,000
one of the doctors suggested to your mom and I

18
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that you live in an institution,

19
0:01:14.12,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that they could just go ahead with their lives

20
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and raise their kids

21
0:01:18.28,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and kind of be done with having to deal with all the disability-related things.

22
0:01:23.32,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I didn't believe my father, not because he was a liar,

23
0:01:27.44,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but I'd never heard this story,

24
0:01:29.8,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and my mother in fact validated that.

25
0:01:32.12,000 --> 0:01:34,000
She never wanted to tell me.

26
0:01:34.28,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But in reality, I don't know why I was really surprised by this story,

27
0:01:38.84,000 --> 0:01:4,000
because when I was five years old,

28
0:01:41.64,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and my mother, like mothers and fathers all across the United States,

29
0:01:45.92,000 --> 0:01:47,000
was taking me to school to enroll,

30
0:01:48.72,000 --> 0:01:52,000
she pushed my wheelchair to the school in walking distance to our house,

31
0:01:53.08,000 --> 0:01:56,000
pulled the wheelchair up the steps into the school,

32
0:01:56.2,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and we were greeted by the principal.

33
0:01:58.4,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Not really greeted.

34
0:02:00.28,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But the principal said, no, I couldn't come to that school

35
0:02:04.88,000 --> 0:02:06,000
because it wasn't accessible.

36
0:02:07.6,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But he told us not to worry,

37
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:15,000
because the Board of Education in fact would send a teacher to my house.

38
0:02:15.2,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And they did

39
0:02:17.04,000 --> 0:02:2,000
for a total of two and a half hours

40
0:02:20.759,000 --> 0:02:21,000
a week.

41
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Audience murmurs)

42
0:02:23.28,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But for good behavior,

43
0:02:25.36,000 --> 0:02:28,000
they threw in an occupational therapist

44
0:02:28.4,000 --> 0:02:3,000
who taught me that very essential skill

45
0:02:31.28,000 --> 0:02:32,000
of cross-stitching.

46
0:02:33.28,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:34.56,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I don't cross-stitch today.

48
0:02:35.92,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:38.32,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I didn't actually get to go to school in a real building

50
0:02:42.04,000 --> 0:02:44,000
until I was nine years old,

51
0:02:44.2,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and then I was in classes only with disabled children

52
0:02:47.4,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in a school that had mainly nondisabled children.

53
0:02:50.64,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And in my classes,

54
0:02:52.52,000 --> 0:02:55,000
there were students up to the age of 21.

55
0:02:56.84,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And then, after 21,

56
0:02:58.72,000 --> 0:03:01,000
they went to something called sheltered workshops

57
0:03:02.08,000 --> 0:03:03,000
with menial work

58
0:03:03.72,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and earning either nothing or below minimum wage.

59
0:03:07.48,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So I understood discrimination.

60
0:03:10.6,000 --> 0:03:12,000
My parents understood discrimination.

61
0:03:13.4,000 --> 0:03:15,000
My parents came from Germany.

62
0:03:16.04,000 --> 0:03:19,000
They were German Jews who left in the 1930s,

63
0:03:19.76,000 --> 0:03:2,000
escaping the Holocaust.

64
0:03:21.92,000 --> 0:03:24,000
My parents lost family and they lost parents.

65
0:03:25.36,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Both my parents lost their parents in the Holocaust.

66
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And so they realized

67
0:03:31.36,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that they could not be silent

68
0:03:33.48,000 --> 0:03:35,000
as things were going wrong for me in my life.

69
0:03:36.92,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Not me personally,

70
0:03:38.32,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but what was going on around me.

71
0:03:40.68,000 --> 0:03:43,000
They learned that because I used a wheelchair,

72
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
none of the high schools in New York City, in the entire city,

73
0:03:47.84,000 --> 0:03:48,000
were wheelchair accessible,

74
0:03:49.76,000 --> 0:03:51,000
so what was supposed to happen

75
0:03:52.28,000 --> 0:03:55,000
is I was supposed to go back onto home instruction

76
0:03:55.56,000 --> 0:03:57,000
along with many other students.

77
0:03:58.12,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So my parents banded together with other parents.

78
0:04:03.32,000 --> 0:04:05,000
They went to the Board of Education

79
0:04:05.44,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and they demanded that the Board of Ed make some of the high schools accessible.

80
0:04:09.96,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And they did.

81
0:04:11.64,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And so I and many others

82
0:04:14.04,000 --> 0:04:17,000
were finally able to go to high school, a regular high school,

83
0:04:17.96,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and take regular classes.

84
0:04:20.52,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So what happened next?

85
0:04:23.44,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I was learning more and more about what discrimination was,

86
0:04:26.88,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and equally important, I was learning that I needed to become my own advocate.

87
0:04:31.92,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I was entering college, Long Island University,

88
0:04:35.4,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and I had always wanted to be a teacher,

89
0:04:37.84,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and so I minored in education and I took all the appropriate courses,

90
0:04:43.08,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and then when it was time for me to go for my license,

91
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I had to take a written exam,

92
0:04:49.68,000 --> 0:04:5,000
an oral exam

93
0:04:51.36,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and a medical exam.

94
0:04:53.32,000 --> 0:04:56,000
At that time, all three of those exams

95
0:04:56.56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
were given in completely inaccessible buildings,

96
0:05:00.24,000 --> 0:05:04,000
so I had friends who carried me up and down the steps

97
0:05:04.52,000 --> 0:05:05,000
for these exams,

98
0:05:06.12,000 --> 0:05:07,000
not in a motorized wheelchair.

99
0:05:07.8,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:08.84,000 --> 0:05:09,000
In a manual wheelchair.

101
0:05:11.44,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But I passed my oral exam.

102
0:05:14.24,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I passed my written exam.

103
0:05:16.96,000 --> 0:05:19,000
My medical exam was something completely different.

104
0:05:21.6,000 --> 0:05:24,000
One of the first questions the doctor asked me

105
0:05:24.76,000 --> 0:05:29,000
was, could I please show her how I went to the bathroom.

106
0:05:31.72,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I was 22 years old

107
0:05:33.72,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and you know when you go for any kind of an interview,

108
0:05:36.32,000 --> 0:05:39,000
you think about all the kinds of questions that people could ask you?

109
0:05:39.6,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:41.32,000 --> 0:05:42,000
That was not one of them.

111
0:05:43.88,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And I was freaked out in the first place

112
0:05:46.48,000 --> 0:05:47,000
because I had heard

113
0:05:47.96,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that there were actually no disabled people using wheelchairs

114
0:05:51.48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
who were teachers in New York,

115
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
so each step along the way I was expecting something bad.

116
0:05:57.36,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So I said to her,

117
0:05:59.28,000 --> 0:06:01,000
is it a requirement that teachers show their students

118
0:06:01.8,000 --> 0:06:02,000
how to go to the bathroom?

119
0:06:04.2,000 --> 0:06:06,000
If it is, I can do that.

120
0:06:07.4,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So no surprise,

121
0:06:09.64,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I was failed

122
0:06:11.4,000 --> 0:06:13,000
because I didn't pass the medical.

123
0:06:13.84,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The official reason that I was denied my job

124
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
was paralysis of poliomyelitis sequelae of -- I'm sorry.

125
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Paralysis of both lower limbs, sequelae of poliomyelitis.

126
0:06:28.56,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Honestly, I didn't know what the word "sequelae" meant,

127
0:06:31.2,000 --> 0:06:34,000
so I went to the dictionary, and it meant "because of."

128
0:06:34.52,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So I'd been denied my license because I couldn't walk.

129
0:06:38.6,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So what was I going to do?

130
0:06:41.2,000 --> 0:06:44,000
This is a really important time in my life,

131
0:06:44.28,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because it would be the first time

132
0:06:46.24,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that I really would be challenging the system, me,

133
0:06:50.76,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and although I was working with a lot of other friends who had disabilities

134
0:06:54.52,000 --> 0:06:56,000
who were encouraging me to move forward with this,

135
0:06:57.12,000 --> 0:06:59,000
it was nonetheless quite frightening.

136
0:06:59.72,000 --> 0:07:,000
But I was really very lucky.

137
0:07:01.32,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I had a friend who was a disabled student at Long Island University

138
0:07:05.56,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and was also a stringer at the "New York Times,"

139
0:07:08.84,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and he was able to get a reporter

140
0:07:11.52,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to write a really good piece about what had happened

141
0:07:15.44,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and why he thought what had happened was wrong.

142
0:07:18.6,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The next day there was an editorial in the "New York Times"

143
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
with the title of "Heumann v. The Board of Education"

144
0:07:26.48,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and the "New York Times" came out in support

145
0:07:28.8,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of my getting my teaching license.

146
0:07:30.92,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Applause)

147
0:07:34.84,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And then the same day,

148
0:07:36.2,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I got a call from an attorney who was writing a book about civil rights.

149
0:07:41.08,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And he was calling me to interview me,

150
0:07:44.4,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and I was interviewing him.

151
0:07:46.6,000 --> 0:07:47,000
He didn't know that.

152
0:07:47.92,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And at the end of our discussion, I said,

153
0:07:50.68,000 --> 0:07:53,000
"Would you be willing to represent me? I want to sue the Board of Education."

154
0:07:54.64,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And he said yes.

155
0:07:56.28,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Now, sometimes I say that the stars were aligned around this court case,

156
0:08:01.84,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because we had an amazing judge:

157
0:08:05.32,000 --> 0:08:1,000
the first African American female federal judge --

158
0:08:10.56,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Laughter)

159
0:08:12.24,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Constance Baker Motley.

160
0:08:14.76,000 --> 0:08:19,000
(Applause)

161
0:08:20.72,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And she knew discrimination when she saw it.

162
0:08:24.68,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Laughter)

163
0:08:27.28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So she strongly encouraged the Board of Ed

164
0:08:31.28,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to give me another medical exam,

165
0:08:34.6,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which they did.

166
0:08:36.32,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And then I got my license,

167
0:08:39.36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and while it took a number of months

168
0:08:41.12,000 --> 0:08:44,000
for me to actually get a principal to offer me a job,

169
0:08:44.2,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I finally did get a job and I started teaching that fall

170
0:08:48.12,000 --> 0:08:5,000
in the same school that I had gone to,

171
0:08:51.08,000 --> 0:08:52,000
second grade.

172
0:08:53.4,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So --

173
0:08:54.64,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Applause)

174
0:08:58.2,000 --> 0:08:59,000
That's a whole other TED Talk.

175
0:08:59.8,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

176
0:09:01.44,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But I was learning as my friends were,

177
0:09:05.52,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and people I didn't know around the country,

178
0:09:08.04,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that we had to be our own advocates,

179
0:09:11.32,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that we needed to fight back people's view

180
0:09:15.6,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that if you had a disability, you needed to be cured,

181
0:09:18.96,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that equality was not part of the equation.

182
0:09:22.04,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And we were learning from the Civil Rights Movement

183
0:09:25.36,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and from the Women's Rights Movement.

184
0:09:27.52,000 --> 0:09:3,000
We were learning from them about their activism

185
0:09:30.72,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and their ability to come together,

186
0:09:32.76,000 --> 0:09:34,000
not only to discuss problems

187
0:09:35.52,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but to discuss solutions.

188
0:09:37.48,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And what was born is what we call today the Disability Rights Movement.

189
0:09:42.8,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So I'd like to tell you a couple of riddles.

190
0:09:46.84,000 --> 0:09:48,000
How many people do you think it takes

191
0:09:50.08,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to stop traffic on Madison Avenue

192
0:09:53.88,000 --> 0:09:55,000
during rush hour in New York City?

193
0:09:56.44,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Do you have a guess? How many?

194
0:09:58.08,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Audience members shout out answers)

195
0:10:01.36,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Fifty.

196
0:10:03.52,000 --> 0:10:04,000
One would be too little.

197
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Fifty people.

198
0:10:07.44,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And there were no accessible paddy wagons,

199
0:10:10.2,000 --> 0:10:12,000
so they had to just kind of deal with us.

200
0:10:12.96,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Laughter)

201
0:10:15.28,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Applause)

202
0:10:17.28,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But let me tell you another riddle.

203
0:10:19.64,000 --> 0:10:23,000
How many people does it take to stop a bus in New York City

204
0:10:24.36,000 --> 0:10:27,000
when they refuse to let you on because you're in a wheelchair?

205
0:10:29.12,000 --> 0:10:31,000
One. That is the right answer.

206
0:10:31.52,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So what you have to do though

207
0:10:34.44,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is take your wheelchair --

208
0:10:36.32,000 --> 0:10:38,000
(Laughter)

209
0:10:39.32,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Sidle in the right place right in front of the steps

210
0:10:43.2,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and give it a little push underneath,

211
0:10:46.56,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and then their bus can't move.

212
0:10:48.36,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Laughter)

213
0:10:52.04,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Any of you who want to learn how to do that,

214
0:10:55.6,000 --> 0:10:56,000
talk to me after this.

215
0:10:56.84,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Laughter)

216
0:10:58.68,000 --> 0:11:04,000
In 1972, President Nixon vetoed the Rehabilitation Act.

217
0:11:05.72,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We protested. He signed it.

218
0:11:09.12,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Then the regulations that needed to be promulgated to implement that law

219
0:11:14.12,000 --> 0:11:16,000
had not in fact been signed.

220
0:11:16.56,000 --> 0:11:18,000
We demonstrated. They were signed.

221
0:11:19.68,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And when the Americans With Disabilities Act, the ADA,

222
0:11:23.56,000 --> 0:11:26,000
our Emancipation Proclamation Act,

223
0:11:26.6,000 --> 0:11:31,000
looked as though it might not in fact be passed in the House or Senate,

224
0:11:32.04,000 --> 0:11:36,000
disabled people from all across the United States came together

225
0:11:36.32,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and they crawled up the Capitol steps.

226
0:11:41.56,000 --> 0:11:43,000
That was an amazing day,

227
0:11:44.32,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and the House and Senate passed the ADA.

228
0:11:48.52,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And then President Bush signed the ADA.

229
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It's a great picture.

230
0:11:55.6,000 --> 0:11:59,000
President Bush signed the ADA on the lawn of the White House.

231
0:11:59.68,000 --> 0:12:,000
It was an amazing day,

232
0:12:01.68,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and there are about 2,000 people there.

233
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:08,000
It was July 26, 1990.

234
0:12:09.72,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And one of the most famous statements he had in his speech

235
0:12:13.44,000 --> 0:12:18,000
was, "Let the shameful walls of exclusion finally come tumbling down."

236
0:12:2,000 --> 0:12:22,000
For any of you in the room

237
0:12:22.08,000 --> 0:12:25,000
who are 50 or older, or maybe or even 40 or older,

238
0:12:25.64,000 --> 0:12:28,000
you remember a time when there were no ramps on the streets,

239
0:12:28.84,000 --> 0:12:3,000
when buses were not accessible,

240
0:12:30.92,000 --> 0:12:31,000
when trains were not accessible,

241
0:12:32.92,000 --> 0:12:35,000
where there were no wheelchair-accessible bathrooms in shopping malls,

242
0:12:36.76,000 --> 0:12:39,000
where you certainly did not have a sign language interpreter,

243
0:12:39.92,000 --> 0:12:43,000
or captioning, or braille or other kinds of supports.

244
0:12:44.12,000 --> 0:12:45,000
These things have changed,

245
0:12:46.08,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and they have inspired the world.

246
0:12:48.76,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And disabled people around the world want laws like we have,

247
0:12:53.6,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and they want those laws enforced.

248
0:12:56.6,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And so what we've seen is something called

249
0:12:59.44,000 --> 0:13:02,000
the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.

250
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
It is a treaty that was adopted in 2006.

251
0:13:07.04,000 --> 0:13:1,000
It's celebrating is 10-year anniversary.

252
0:13:11.04,000 --> 0:13:15,000
More than 165 countries have joined this treaty.

253
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It is the first international human rights treaty

254
0:13:20.28,000 --> 0:13:22,000
fully focused on disabled people.

255
0:13:23.52,000 --> 0:13:27,000
But I am sad to say that our US Senate

256
0:13:27.68,000 --> 0:13:32,000
has failed to recommend to our president that we ratify the treaty.

257
0:13:32.96,000 --> 0:13:34,000
We signed it in 2009,

258
0:13:35.92,000 --> 0:13:39,000
but it doesn't come into force until ratification,

259
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and the president -- no president can ratify a treaty

260
0:13:43.4,000 --> 0:13:45,000
without the consent of the Senate.

261
0:13:46.56,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So we feel really strongly

262
0:13:50.04,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that our US Senate needs to do its job,

263
0:13:53.6,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that our Senate needs to enable us as Americans

264
0:13:57.8,000 --> 0:14:02,000
not only to be able to assist disabled people and governments around the world

265
0:14:02.96,000 --> 0:14:05,000
to learn about the good work that we've been doing,

266
0:14:06.84,000 --> 0:14:08,000
but it's equally important

267
0:14:08.88,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that disabled people have the same opportunities

268
0:14:12.72,000 --> 0:14:15,000
to travel, study and work abroad

269
0:14:16.4,000 --> 0:14:18,000
as anyone else in our country.

270
0:14:18.8,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And as long as many countries don't have the same laws as we do

271
0:14:22.96,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and don't enforce them if they have them,

272
0:14:25.6,000 --> 0:14:28,000
opportunities for disabled people are more limited.

273
0:14:29.84,000 --> 0:14:3,000
When I travel abroad,

274
0:14:31.8,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I am always meeting with disabled women,

275
0:14:34.64,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and those women tell me stories

276
0:14:37.12,000 --> 0:14:41,000
about how they experience violence and rape

277
0:14:41.48,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and how in many cases these forms of violence

278
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
occur from family members and people that they know,

279
0:14:50.68,000 --> 0:14:52,000
who in fact may be working for them.

280
0:14:53.28,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And frequently these cases are not adjudicated.

281
0:14:56.72,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I meet disabled people

282
0:14:58.72,000 --> 0:15:02,000
who have been offered jobs by businesses

283
0:15:03.4,000 --> 0:15:06,000
because they live in a country where there's a quota system,

284
0:15:06.8,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and in order to avoid a fine,

285
0:15:09.36,000 --> 0:15:11,000
they will hire you

286
0:15:11.64,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and then tell you,

287
0:15:12.92,000 --> 0:15:13,000
"You don't need to come to work

288
0:15:14.8,000 --> 0:15:17,000
because we really don't need you in the facility."

289
0:15:18.8,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I have visited institutions

290
0:15:21.4,000 --> 0:15:24,000
where the stench of urine is so strong

291
0:15:25.28,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that before you open the door of your vehicle,

292
0:15:28.4,000 --> 0:15:3,000
you're kind of pushed back,

293
0:15:30.44,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and then gone into those institutions

294
0:15:33.28,000 --> 0:15:37,000
where people should be living in the community with appropriate supports

295
0:15:38.2,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and seen people almost naked,

296
0:15:41.28,000 --> 0:15:43,000
people who are chemically drugged

297
0:15:43.8,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and people who are living lives of despair.

298
0:15:47.12,000 --> 0:15:52,000
These are some of the things that the US needs to be doing more to correct.

299
0:15:53.24,000 --> 0:15:56,000
We know discrimination when we see it,

300
0:15:56.44,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and we need to be fighting it together.

301
0:15:59.12,000 --> 0:16:02,000
So what is it that we can be doing together?

302
0:16:03.32,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I encourage you all to recognize

303
0:16:06.12,000 --> 0:16:11,000
that disability is a family you can join at any point in your life.

304
0:16:12.04,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I'd like to see by a show of hands how many of you have ever broken a bone?

305
0:16:18.8,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And then, when you leave today, I'd like you to maybe write a couple of sentences

306
0:16:23.6,000 --> 0:16:26,000
about what that period of time has been like for you,

307
0:16:27.48,000 --> 0:16:29,000
because frequently I hear from people,

308
0:16:30.04,000 --> 0:16:33,000
"You know, I couldn't do this, I couldn't do that.

309
0:16:33.08,000 --> 0:16:37,000
People talked to me differently. They acted differently towards me."

310
0:16:37.4,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And that's what I see and other disabled people see

311
0:16:41.28,000 --> 0:16:42,000
in flashing letters.

312
0:16:43.52,000 --> 0:16:45,000
But we -- you in this room,

313
0:16:46.28,000 --> 0:16:49,000
people listening and watching this TED Talk --

314
0:16:49.52,000 --> 0:16:52,000
together we can make a difference.

315
0:16:52.68,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Together we can speak up for justice.

316
0:16:56.28,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Together we can help change the world.

317
0:16:59.96,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Thank you. I have to go catch my bus.

318
0:17:02.56,000 --> 0:17:08,000
(Applause)

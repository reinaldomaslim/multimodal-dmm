1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I love trees, and I'm very lucky,

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
because we live near a wonderful arboretum,

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and Sundays, usually, I'd go there with my wife

4
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and now, with my four-year-old,

5
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and we'd climb in the trees, we'd play hide and seek.

6
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The second school I was at had big trees too,

7
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:47,000
had a fantastic tulip tree, I think it was the biggest in the country,

8
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and it also had a lot of wonderful bushes and vegetation

9
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:53,000
around it, around the playing fields.

10
0:00:53,000 --> 0:00:57,000
One day I was grabbed by some of my classmates,

11
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and taken in the bushes -- I was stripped; I was attacked;

12
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I was abused; and this came out of the blue.

13
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now, the reason I say that, because, afterwards, I was thinking --

14
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:16,000
well, I went back into the school -- I felt dirty; I felt betrayed;

15
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I felt ashamed, but mainly -- mainly, I felt powerless.

16
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And 30 years later I was sitting in an airplane,

17
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
next to a lady called Veronica, who came from Chile,

18
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and we were on a human rights tour,

19
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and she was starting to tell me what it was like to be tortured,

20
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and, from my very privileged position,

21
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
this was the only reference point that I had.

22
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And it was an amazing learning experience

23
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
because, for me, human rights have been something in which I had,

24
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:52,000
you know, a part-time interest, but, mainly,

25
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
it was something that happened to other people over there.

26
0:01:55,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But I got a phone call from Bono in 1985 and, as you know,

27
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:07,000
he's a great singer, but he's a magnificent hustler, and --

28
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter) --

29
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:12,000
a very hard guy to say no to, and he was saying,

30
0:02:12,000 --> 0:02:14,000
you know, just after I'd done the Biko song,

31
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:16,000
we're going to do a tour for Amnesty,

32
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
you have to be on it, and really that was the first time

33
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that I'd been out and started meeting people

34
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
who'd watched their family being shot in front of them,

35
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
who'd had a partner thrown out of an airplane into an ocean,

36
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and suddenly this world of human rights arrived in my world,

37
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and I couldn't really walk away in quite the same way as before.

38
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So I got involved with this tour, which was for Amnesty,

39
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and then in '88 I took over Bono's job trying to learn how to hustle.

40
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I didn't do it as well, but we managed to get Youssou N'Dour, Sting,

41
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Tracy Chapman, and Bruce Springsteen to go 'round the world for Amnesty,

42
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and it was an amazing experience.

43
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And, once again, I got an extraordinary education,

44
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and it was the first time, really,

45
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that I'd met a lot of these people in the different countries,

46
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and these human rights stories became very physical,

47
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and, again, I couldn't really walk away quite so comfortably.

48
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But the thing that really amazed me, that I had no idea,

49
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
was that you could suffer in this way

50
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and then have your whole experience, your story, denied,

51
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
buried and forgotten.

52
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And it seemed that whenever there was a camera around,

53
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
or a video or film camera,

54
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:5,000
it was a great deal harder to do -- for those in power to bury the story.

55
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And Reebok set up a foundation after these Human Rights Now tours

56
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and there was a decision then --

57
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
well, we made a proposal, for a couple of years,

58
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:04,000
about trying to set up a division

59
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that was going to give cameras to human rights activists.

60
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It didn't really get anywhere,

61
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and then the Rodney King incident happened, and people thought,

62
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:16,000
OK, if you have a camera in the right place at the right time,

63
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or, perhaps, the wrong time, depending who you are,

64
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:25,000
then you can actually start doing something,

65
0:04:25,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and campaigning, and being heard,

66
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and telling people about what's going on.

67
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So, WITNESS was started in '92

68
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and it's since given cameras out in over 60 countries.

69
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And we campaign with activist groups

70
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and help them tell their story and, in fact,

71
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I will show you in a moment one of the most recent campaigns,

72
0:04:55,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and I'm afraid it's a story from Uganda,

73
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and, although we had a wonderful story from Uganda yesterday,

74
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:04,000
this one isn't quite so good.

75
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
In the north of Uganda,

76
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
there are something like 1.5 million internally displaced people,

77
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:12,000
people who are not refugees in another country,

78
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:16,000
but because of the civil war, which has been going on for about 20 years,

79
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
they have nowhere to live.

80
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers,

81
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the --

82
0:05:32,000 --> 0:05:34,000
now, what's it called?

83
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I forget the name of the of the army --

84
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
it's Lord's Resistance Army, I believe --

85
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
but the government, also, doesn't have a clean sheet,

86
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:43,000
so if we could run the first video.

87
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Music)

88
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Woman: Life in the camp is never simple. Even today life is difficult.

89
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We stay because of the fear that what pushed us into the camp ...

90
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:56,000
still exists back home.

93
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
At first, we were safe in the camp.

94
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But later the government soldiers began mistreating us a lot.

Jennifer: A soldier walked onto the road, asking where we'd been.

97
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Evelyn and I hid behind my mother.

98
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Evelyn: He ordered us to sit down, so we sat down.

99
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The other soldier also came.

100
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Jennifer: The man came and started undressing me.

101
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The other one carried Evelyn aside.

102
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The one who was defiling me then left me and went to rape Evelyn.

103
0:06:56,000 --> 0:07:,000
And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also.

104
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Man: The soldiers with clubs this long beat us to get a confession.

105
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They kept telling us, "Tell the truth!" as they beat us.

106
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Woman: They insisted that I was lying.

107
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:3,000
At that moment, they fired and shot off my fingers.

108
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I fell. They ran to join the others ... leaving me for dead.

whether physical or mental,

113
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is intentionally inflicted by a person acting in an official capacity

114
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to obtain information or a confession, to punish, coerce or intimidate.

Peter Gabriel: So torture is not something that always happens on other soil.

116
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:21,000
In my country, it was --

117
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:27,000
we had been looking at pictures of British soldiers beating up young Iraqis;

118
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
we've got Abu Ghraib; we've got Guantanamo Bay.

119
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I had a driver on my way to Newark Airport,

120
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and he told me a story that, in the middle of the night, 4 a.m.,

121
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:45,000
he'd been taken out of his home in Queens -- taken to a place in the Midwest,

122
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that he was interrogated and tortured

123
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and returned to the street four weeks later,

124
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
because he had the same -- he was Middle Eastern,

125
0:08:56,000 --> 0:09:,000
and he had the same name as one of the 9/11 pilots,

126
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and that may or may not be true --

127
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I didn't think he was a liar, though.

128
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And, I think, if we look around the world,

129
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:13,000
as well as the polar ice caps melting,

130
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
human rights, which have been fought for,

131
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
for many hundreds of years in some cases,

132
0:09:19,000 --> 0:09:22,000
are, also, eroding very fast,

133
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and that is something that we need to take a look at

134
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and, maybe, start campaigning for.

135
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I mean, here, too, one of our partners was at Van Jones

136
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and the Books Not Bars project -- they have managed,

137
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
with their footage in California

138
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:47,000
to change the youth correction systems employed,

139
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and it's much -- much -- I think, more humane methods

140
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:56,000
are being looked at, how you should lock up young kids,

141
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and that's questionable to start off.

142
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And as the story of Mr. Morales, just down the road,

143
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
excuse me, Mr. Gabriel,

144
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:1,000
would you mind if we delayed your execution a little bit?

145
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:13,000
No, not at all, no problem, take your time.

146
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But this, surely, whoever that man is, whatever he's done,

147
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:22,000
this is cruel and unusual punishment.

148
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Anyway, WITNESS has been trying to arm the brave people

149
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:33,000
who often put their lives at risk around the world, with cameras,

150
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and I'd like to show you just a little more of that. Thank you.

0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:58,000
make it

167
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:03,000
right.

168
0:12:06,000 --> 0:12:1,000
WITNESS.

169
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
All the video you have just seen was recorded by

170
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
human rights groups working with WITNESS.

171
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Applause)

172
0:12:22,000 --> 0:12:26,000
PG: WITNESS was born of technological innovation --

173
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
in a sense the small, portable, DV cam

174
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:31,000
was really what allowed it to come into being.

175
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And we've also been trying to get computers out to the world,

176
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
so that groups can communicate much more effectively,

177
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:4,000
campaign much more effectively,

178
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:44,000
but now we have the wonderful possibility,

179
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:5,000
which is given to us from the mobile phone with the camera in it,

180
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:55,000
because that is cheap; it's ubiquitous; and it's moving fast

181
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:58,000
all around the world -- and it's very exciting for us.

182
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And so, the dream is that we could have a world

183
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:08,000
in which anyone who has anything bad happen to them of this sort

184
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:12,000
has a chance of getting their story uploaded,

185
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:15,000
being seen, being watched,

186
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
that they really know that they can be heard,

187
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that there would be a giant website,

188
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,000
maybe, a little like Google Earth,

189
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and you could fly over and find out the realities of what's going,

190
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:31,000
for the world's inhabitants. In a way

191
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:34,000
what this technology is allowing is, really,

192
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that a lot of the problems of the world can have a human face,

193
0:13:38,000 --> 0:13:41,000
that we can actually see who's dying of AIDS

194
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:46,000
or who's being beaten up, for the first time,

195
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and we can hear their stories in a way that the blogger culture --

196
0:13:5,000 --> 0:13:53,000
if we can move that into these sort of fields,

197
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I think we can really transform the world in all sorts of ways.

198
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:04,000
There could be a new movement growing up,

199
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:09,000
rising from the ground, reaching for the light,

200
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and growing strong, just like a tree. Thank you.

1
0:00:12.5,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My first job out of college was as an academic researcher

2
0:00:16.458,000 --> 0:00:2,000
at one of the largest juvenile detention centers in the country.

3
0:00:20.833,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And every day I would drive to this building

4
0:00:22.958,000 --> 0:00:23,000
on the West Side of Chicago,

5
0:00:24.417,000 --> 0:00:25,000
go through the security checkpoint

6
0:00:26.25,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and walk down these brown, brick hallways as I made my way down to the basement

7
0:00:31.25,000 --> 0:00:33,000
to observe the intake process.

8
0:00:33.792,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The kids coming in were about 10 to 16 years old,

9
0:00:37.042,000 --> 0:00:39,000
usually always black and brown,

10
0:00:39.167,000 --> 0:00:43,000
most likely from the same impoverished South and West Sides of Chicago.

11
0:00:43.625,000 --> 0:00:46,000
They should've been in fifth to tenth grade,

12
0:00:46.708,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but instead they were here for weeks on end

13
0:00:49.167,000 --> 0:00:51,000
awaiting trial for various crimes.

14
0:00:51.958,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Some of them came back to the facility 14 times before their 15th birthday.

15
0:00:57.375,000 --> 0:01:,000
And as I sat there on the other side of the glass from them,

16
0:01:00.5,000 --> 0:01:02,000
idealistic with a college degree,

17
0:01:03.083,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I wondered to myself:

18
0:01:04.792,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Why didn't schools do something more to prevent this from happening?

19
0:01:10.042,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's been about 10 years since then,

20
0:01:11.792,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and I still think about how some kids get tracked towards college

21
0:01:15.042,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and others towards detention,

22
0:01:17.792,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but I no longer think about schools' abilities to solve these things.

23
0:01:22.208,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You see, I've learned that so much of this problem is systemic

24
0:01:25.792,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that often our school system perpetuates the social divide.

25
0:01:30.875,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It makes worse what it's supposed to fix.

26
0:01:34.125,000 --> 0:01:35,000
That's as crazy or controversial

27
0:01:35.917,000 --> 0:01:37,000
as saying that our health care system isn't preventative

28
0:01:38.583,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but somehow profits off of keeping us sick ...

29
0:01:41.583,000 --> 0:01:42,000
oops.

30
0:01:42.875,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:43.917,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I truly do believe though that kids can achieve great things

32
0:01:46.792,000 --> 0:01:47,000
despite the odds against them,

33
0:01:48.292,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and in fact, my own research shows that.

34
0:01:51.292,000 --> 0:01:54,000
But if we're serious about helping more kids from across the board

35
0:01:55.208,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to achieve and make it in this world,

36
0:01:58.167,000 --> 0:02:01,000
we're going to have to realize that our gaps in student outcomes

37
0:02:01.292,000 --> 0:02:05,000
are not so much about achievement as much as they are about opportunity.

38
0:02:06.667,000 --> 0:02:08,000
A 2019 EdBuild report showed

39
0:02:09.375,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that majority-white districts receive about 23 billion dollars more

40
0:02:13.917,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in annual funding than nonwhite districts,

41
0:02:16.542,000 --> 0:02:18,000
even though they serve about the same number of students.

42
0:02:19.542,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Lower resource schools are dealing with lower quality equipment,

43
0:02:22.667,000 --> 0:02:23,000
obsolete technology

44
0:02:24.167,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and paying teachers way less.

45
0:02:26.042,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Here in New York,

46
0:02:27.583,000 --> 0:02:29,000
those are also the schools most likely to serve

47
0:02:29.833,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the one in 10 elementary school students

48
0:02:32.333,000 --> 0:02:35,000
who will most likely have to sleep in a homeless shelter tonight.

49
0:02:36.542,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The student, parent and teacher are dealing with a lot.

50
0:02:40.417,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Sometimes places are misplacing the blame back on them.

51
0:02:44.542,000 --> 0:02:47,000
In Atlanta, we saw that teachers felt desperate enough

52
0:02:47.958,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to have to help their students cheat on standardized tests

53
0:02:51.542,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that would impact their funding.

54
0:02:53.375,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Eight of them went to jail for that in 2015

55
0:02:56.25,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with some sentences as high as 20 years,

56
0:02:59.833,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which is more than what many states give for second-degree murder.

57
0:03:04.375,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The thing is though, in places like Tulsa,

58
0:03:07.083,000 --> 0:03:08,000
teachers' pay has been so bad

59
0:03:09.083,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that these people have had to go to food pantries

60
0:03:11.417,000 --> 0:03:13,000
or soup kitchens just to feed themselves.

61
0:03:14.375,000 --> 0:03:18,000
The same system will criminalize a parent who will use a relative's address

62
0:03:19.292,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to send their child to a better school,

63
0:03:22.208,000 --> 0:03:24,000
but for who knows how long authorities have turned a blind eye

64
0:03:25.167,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to those who can bribe their way

65
0:03:27.083,000 --> 0:03:3,000
onto the most elite and beautiful college campuses.

66
0:03:31.792,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And a lot of this feels pretty heavy to be saying --

67
0:03:34.458,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and maybe to be hearing --

68
0:03:36.25,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and since there's nothing quite like economics talk to lighten the mood --

69
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that's right, right?

70
0:03:42.75,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Let me tell you about some of the costs

71
0:03:44.667,000 --> 0:03:47,000
when we fail to tap into our students' potential.

72
0:03:47.708,000 --> 0:03:49,000
A McKinsey study showed that if in 1998

73
0:03:50.667,000 --> 0:03:53,000
we could've closed our long-standing student achievement gaps

74
0:03:53.917,000 --> 0:03:55,000
between students of different ethnic backgrounds

75
0:03:56.208,000 --> 0:03:58,000
or students of different income levels,

76
0:03:58.792,000 --> 0:04:,000
by 2008, our GDP --

77
0:04:01.542,000 --> 0:04:02,000
our untapped economic gains --

78
0:04:03.375,000 --> 0:04:06,000
could have gone up by more than 500 billion dollars.

79
0:04:06.917,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Those same gaps in 2008,

80
0:04:09.458,000 --> 0:04:13,000
between our students here in the US and those across the world,

81
0:04:13.667,000 --> 0:04:14,000
may have deprived our economy

82
0:04:15.333,000 --> 0:04:2,000
of up to 2.3 trillion dollars of economic output.

83
0:04:21.375,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But beyond economics, numbers and figures,

84
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I think there's a simpler reason that this matters,

85
0:04:26.625,000 --> 0:04:28,000
a simpler reason for fixing our system.

86
0:04:29.458,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's that in a true democracy,

87
0:04:31.625,000 --> 0:04:33,000
like the one we pride ourselves on having --

88
0:04:33.75,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and sometimes rightfully so --

89
0:04:36.417,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a child's future should not be predetermined

90
0:04:38.542,000 --> 0:04:4,000
by the circumstances of their birth.

91
0:04:40.708,000 --> 0:04:46,000
A public education system should not create a wider bottom and more narrow top.

92
0:04:46.958,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Some of us can sometimes think

93
0:04:48.5,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that these things aren't that close to home,

94
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but they are if we broaden our view,

95
0:04:53.292,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because a leaky faucet in our kitchen,

96
0:04:56.042,000 --> 0:04:58,000
broken radiator in our hallway,

97
0:04:58.583,000 --> 0:05:01,000
those parts of the house that we always say we're going to get to next week,

98
0:05:02.5,000 --> 0:05:04,000
they're devaluing our whole property.

99
0:05:05.25,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Instead of constantly looking away to solutions like privatization

100
0:05:09.958,000 --> 0:05:11,000
or the charter school movement to solve our problems,

101
0:05:12.958,000 --> 0:05:14,000
why don't we take a deeper look at public education,

102
0:05:15.667,000 --> 0:05:17,000
try to take more pride in it

103
0:05:17.708,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and maybe use it to solve some of our social problems.

104
0:05:22.167,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Why don't we try to reclaim the promise of public education

105
0:05:26.417,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and remember that it's our greatest collective responsibility?

106
0:05:30.917,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Luckily some of our communities are doing just that.

107
0:05:34.417,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The huge teacher strikes in the spring of 2019 in Denver and LA --

108
0:05:39.417,000 --> 0:05:42,000
they were successful because of community support

109
0:05:42.542,000 --> 0:05:44,000
for things like smaller class sizes

110
0:05:44.625,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and getting things into schools like more counselors

111
0:05:47.667,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in addition to teacher pay.

112
0:05:49.792,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And sometimes for the student,

113
0:05:51.708,000 --> 0:05:55,000
innovation is just daring to implement common sense.

114
0:05:55.833,000 --> 0:05:56,000
In Baltimore a few years ago,

115
0:05:57.292,000 --> 0:05:59,000
they enacted a free breakfast and lunch program,

116
0:06:00.125,000 --> 0:06:02,000
taking away the stigma of poverty and hunger

117
0:06:02.417,000 --> 0:06:03,000
for some students

118
0:06:03.958,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but increasing achievement in attendance for many others.

119
0:06:08.042,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And in Memphis,

120
0:06:09.333,000 --> 0:06:12,000
the university is recruiting local, passionate high school students

121
0:06:12.75,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and giving them scholarships to go teach in the inner city

122
0:06:16.042,000 --> 0:06:18,000
without the burden of college debt.

123
0:06:18.917,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And north of here in The Bronx,

124
0:06:20.458,000 --> 0:06:22,000
I recently researched these partnerships being built

125
0:06:22.958,000 --> 0:06:25,000
between high schools, community colleges and local businesses

126
0:06:26.25,000 --> 0:06:3,000
who are creating internships in finance, health care and technology

127
0:06:30.667,000 --> 0:06:32,000
for students without "silver spoon" connections

128
0:06:33.542,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to gain important skills

129
0:06:35.5,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and contribute to the communities that they come from.

130
0:06:39.5,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So today I don't necessarily have the same questions about education

131
0:06:43.542,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that I did when I was an idealistic, perhaps naïve college grad

132
0:06:47.917,000 --> 0:06:49,000
working in a detention center basement.

133
0:06:50.375,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's not: Can schools save more of our students?

134
0:06:54.292,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Because I think we have the answer to that --

135
0:06:56.535,000 --> 0:07:,000
and it's yes they can, if we save our schools first.

136
0:07:00.75,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We can start by caring about the education of other people's children ...

137
0:07:05.75,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And I'm saying that as someone who doesn't have kids yet

138
0:07:08.5,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but wants to worry a little bit less about the future when I do.

139
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Cultivating as much talent as possible,

140
0:07:15.5,000 --> 0:07:17,000
getting as many girls as we can from all over

141
0:07:18.375,000 --> 0:07:2,000
into science and engineering,

142
0:07:20.417,000 --> 0:07:23,000
as many boys as we can into teaching --

143
0:07:24.208,000 --> 0:07:27,000
those are investments for our future.

144
0:07:27.375,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Our students are like our most valuable resource,

145
0:07:30.833,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and when you put it that way,

146
0:07:32.625,000 --> 0:07:35,000
our teachers are like our modern-day diamond and gold miners,

147
0:07:36.083,000 --> 0:07:38,000
hoping to help make them shine.

148
0:07:38.333,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Let's contribute our voices,

149
0:07:40.333,000 --> 0:07:42,000
our votes and our support

150
0:07:42.792,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to giving them the resources that they will need

151
0:07:45.458,000 --> 0:07:47,000
not just to survive

152
0:07:47.667,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but hopefully thrive,

153
0:07:49.167,000 --> 0:07:52,000
allowing all of us to do so as well.

154
0:07:52.25,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Thank you.

155
0:07:53.542,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Applause and cheers)

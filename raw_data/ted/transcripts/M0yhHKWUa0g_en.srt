1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm here because I have a very important message:

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I think we have found

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the most important factor for success.

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And it was found close to here, Stanford.

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Psychology professor took kids that were four years old

6
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and put them in a room all by themselves.

7
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And he would tell the child, a four-year-old kid,

8
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"Johnny, I am going to leave you here with a marshmallow

9
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
for 15 minutes.

10
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
If, after I come back, this marshmallow is here,

11
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
you will get another one. So you will have two."

12
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
To tell a four-year-old kid to wait 15 minutes

13
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
for something that they like,

14
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
is equivalent to telling us, "We'll bring you coffee in two hours."

15
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Exact equivalent.

17
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So what happened when the professor left the room?

18
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
As soon as the door closed...

19
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
two out of three ate the marshmallow.

20
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Five seconds, 10 seconds, 40 seconds, 50 seconds,

21
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
two minutes, four minutes, eight minutes.

22
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes.

23
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Couldn't do it. Could not wait.

25
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
What's interesting is that one out of three

26
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
would look at the marshmallow and go like this ...

27
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Would look at it.

28
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Put it back.

29
0:01:43.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They would walk around. They would play with their skirts and pants.

30
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
That child already, at four, understood

31
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the most important principle for success,

32
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
which is the ability to delay gratification.

33
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
Self-discipline:

34
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the most important factor for success.

35
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
15 years later, 14 or 15 years later,

36
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
follow-up study.

37
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What did they find?

38
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19.

39
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And they found that 100 percent

40
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful.

41
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
They had good grades. They were doing wonderful.

42
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
They were happy. They had their plans.

43
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They had good relationships with the teachers, students.

44
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
They were doing fine.

45
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
A great percentage of the kids that ate the marshmallow,

46
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
they were in trouble.

47
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
They did not make it to university.

48
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out.

49
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
A few were still there with bad grades.

50
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
A few had good grades.

51
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I had a question in my mind: Would Hispanic kids

52
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
react the same way as the American kids?

53
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So I went to Colombia. And I reproduced the experiment.

54
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And it was very funny. I used four, five and six years old kids.

55
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And let me show you what happened.

56
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Spanish) (Laughter)

57
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So what happened in Colombia?

58
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Hispanic kids, two out of three ate the marshmallow;

59
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
one out of three did not.

60
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This little girl was interesting;

61
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
she ate the inside of the marshmallow.

62
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Laughter)

63
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
In other words, she wanted us to think that she had not eaten it, so she would get two.

64
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But she ate it.

65
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So we know she'll be successful. But we have to watch her.

66
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

67
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
She should not go into banking, for example,

68
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
or work at a cash register.

69
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But she will be successful.

70
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And this applies for everything. Even in sales.

71
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The sales person that --

72
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the customer says, "I want that." And the person says, "Okay, here you are."

73
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
That person ate the marshmallow.

74
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
If the sales person says, "Wait a second.

75
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Let me ask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice."

76
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Then you sell a lot more.

77
0:05:35.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So this has applications in all walks of life.

78
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I end with -- the Koreans did this.

79
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You know what? This is so good

80
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that we want a marshmallow book for children.

81
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We did one for children. And now it is all over Korea.

82
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They are teaching these kids exactly this principle.

83
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And we need to learn that principle here in the States,

84
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
because we have a big debt.

85
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We are eating more marshmallows than we are producing.

86
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
Thank you so much.

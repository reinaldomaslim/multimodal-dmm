1
0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Why bother?

2
0:00:16.6,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The game is rigged.

3
0:00:18.24,000 --> 0:00:19,000
My vote won't count.

4
0:00:20.72,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The choices are terrible.

5
0:00:22.84,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Voting is for suckers.

6
0:00:25.28,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Perhaps you've thought some of these things.

7
0:00:27.44,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Perhaps you've even said them.

8
0:00:29.52,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And if so, you wouldn't be alone, and you wouldn't be entirely wrong.

9
0:00:33.88,000 --> 0:00:37,000
The game of public policy today is rigged in many ways.

10
0:00:38.08,000 --> 0:00:41,000
How else would more than half of federal tax breaks

11
0:00:42.08,000 --> 0:00:44,000
flow up to the wealthiest five percent of Americans?

12
0:00:45.36,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And our choices indeed are often terrible.

13
0:00:48.36,000 --> 0:00:5,000
For many people across the political spectrum,

14
0:00:50.56,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Exhibit A is the 2016 presidential election.

15
0:00:54.76,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But in any year, you can look up and down the ballot

16
0:00:57.32,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and find plenty to be uninspired about.

17
0:01:01.56,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But in spite of all this, I still believe voting matters.

18
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And crazy as it may sound,

19
0:01:06.92,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I believe we can revive the joy of voting.

20
0:01:09.96,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Today, I want to talk about how we can do that, and why.

21
0:01:14.68,000 --> 0:01:17,000
There used to be a time in American history when voting was fun,

22
0:01:18.28,000 --> 0:01:21,000
when it was much more than just a grim duty to show up at the polls.

23
0:01:22.08,000 --> 0:01:24,000
That time is called "most of American history."

24
0:01:24.52,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:25.96,000 --> 0:01:27,000
From the Revolution to the Civil Rights Era,

26
0:01:28.96,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the United States had a vibrant,

27
0:01:30.56,000 --> 0:01:34,000
robustly participatory and raucous culture of voting.

28
0:01:35.48,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It was street theater, open-air debates, fasting and feasting and toasting,

29
0:01:39.64,000 --> 0:01:41,000
parades and bonfires.

30
0:01:41.72,000 --> 0:01:44,000
During the 19th century, immigrants and urban political machines

31
0:01:45.28,000 --> 0:01:46,000
helped fuel this culture of voting.

32
0:01:47.6,000 --> 0:01:51,000
That culture grew with each successive wave of new voters.

33
0:01:53.04,000 --> 0:01:55,000
During Reconstruction, when new African-American voters,

34
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:57,000
new African-American citizens,

35
0:01:58.56,000 --> 0:02:,000
began to exercise their power,

36
0:02:00.6,000 --> 0:02:02,000
they celebrated in jubilee parades

37
0:02:02.84,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that connected emancipation with their newfound right to vote.

38
0:02:06.92,000 --> 0:02:07,000
A few decades later, the suffragettes

39
0:02:09.68,000 --> 0:02:12,000
brought a spirit of theatricality to their fight,

40
0:02:12.8,000 --> 0:02:15,000
marching together in white dresses as they claimed the franchise.

41
0:02:16.68,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And the Civil Rights Movement,

42
0:02:18.24,000 --> 0:02:2,000
which sought to redeem the promise of equal citizenship

43
0:02:21.039,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that had been betrayed by Jim Crow,

44
0:02:23.8,000 --> 0:02:24,000
put voting right at the center.

45
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
From Freedom Summer to the march in Selma,

46
0:02:28.76,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that generation of activists knew that voting matters,

47
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and they knew that spectacle and the performance of power

48
0:02:35.12,000 --> 0:02:36,000
is key to actually claiming power.

49
0:02:38.56,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But it's been over a half century since Selma and the Voting Rights Act,

50
0:02:42.88,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and in the decades since,

51
0:02:44.88,000 --> 0:02:46,000
this face-to-face culture of voting

52
0:02:47.2,000 --> 0:02:48,000
has just about disappeared.

53
0:02:49.2,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's been killed by television

54
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and then the internet.

55
0:02:52.72,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The couch has replaced the commons.

56
0:02:55.04,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Screens have made citizens into spectators.

57
0:02:58.04,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And while it's nice to share political memes on social media,

58
0:03:01.36,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that's a rather quiet kind of citizenship.

59
0:03:04.56,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It's what the sociologist Sherry Turkle calls "being alone together."

60
0:03:09.36,000 --> 0:03:1,000
What we need today

61
0:03:10.84,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is an electoral culture that is about being together together,

62
0:03:14.72,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in person,

63
0:03:15.96,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in loud and passionate ways,

64
0:03:18.2,000 --> 0:03:22,000
so that instead of being "eat your vegetables" or "do you duty,"

65
0:03:22.48,000 --> 0:03:24,000
voting can feel more like "join the club"

66
0:03:25.48,000 --> 0:03:26,000
or, better yet, "join the party."

67
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Imagine if we had, across the country right now,

68
0:03:31.72,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in local places but nationwide,

69
0:03:34.68,000 --> 0:03:37,000
a concerted effort to revive a face-to-face set of ways

70
0:03:38.36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to engage and electioneer:

71
0:03:40.6,000 --> 0:03:43,000
outdoor shows in which candidates and their causes are mocked

72
0:03:44.48,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and praised in broad satirical style;

73
0:03:47.2,000 --> 0:03:48,000
soapbox speeches by citizens;

74
0:03:49.84,000 --> 0:03:51,000
public debates held inside pubs;

75
0:03:53.92,000 --> 0:03:57,000
streets filled with political art and handmade posters and murals;

76
0:03:58.68,000 --> 0:04:03,000
battle of the band concerts in which competing performers rep their candidates.

77
0:04:04.36,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, all of this may sound a little bit 18th century to you,

78
0:04:08.44,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but in fact, it doesn't have to be any more 18th century

79
0:04:11.8,000 --> 0:04:14,000
than, say, Broadway's "Hamilton,"

80
0:04:15.04,000 --> 0:04:17,000
which is to say vibrantly contemporary.

81
0:04:17.64,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And the fact is that all around the world,

82
0:04:19.664,000 --> 0:04:22,000
today, millions of people are voting like this.

83
0:04:23.28,000 --> 0:04:27,000
In India, elections are colorful, communal affairs.

84
0:04:27.56,000 --> 0:04:31,000
In Brazil, election day is a festive, carnival-type atmosphere.

85
0:04:32.959,000 --> 0:04:34,000
In Taiwan and Hong Kong, there is a spectacle,

86
0:04:35.48,000 --> 0:04:37,000
eye-popping, eye-grabbing spectacle

87
0:04:37.76,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to the street theater of elections.

88
0:04:40.72,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You might ask, well, here in America, who has time for this?

89
0:04:44.48,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And I would tell you

90
0:04:45.76,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that the average American watches five hours of television a day.

91
0:04:50.24,000 --> 0:04:52,000
You might ask, who has the motivation?

92
0:04:52.56,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And I'll tell you,

93
0:04:53.8,000 --> 0:04:57,000
any citizen who wants to be seen and heard

94
0:04:57.96,000 --> 0:04:59,000
not as a prop, not as a talking point,

95
0:05:00.28,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but as a participant, as a creator.

96
0:05:03.72,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Well, how do we make this happen?

97
0:05:06.8,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Simply by making it happen.

98
0:05:08.92,000 --> 0:05:09,000
That's why a group of colleagues and I

99
0:05:10.8,000 --> 0:05:13,000
launched a new project called "The Joy of Voting."

100
0:05:14.88,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In four cities across the United States --

101
0:05:17.36,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Philadelphia, Miami,

102
0:05:19.04,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Akron, Ohio, and Wichita, Kansas --

103
0:05:21.52,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we've gathered together artists and activists,

104
0:05:24.48,000 --> 0:05:27,000
educators, political folks, neighbors, everyday citizens

105
0:05:28.24,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to come together and create projects

106
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that can foster this culture of voting in a local way.

107
0:05:34.24,000 --> 0:05:37,000
In Miami, that means all-night parties with hot DJs

108
0:05:37.32,000 --> 0:05:4,000
where the only way to get in is to show that you're registered to vote.

109
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
In Akron, it means political plays

110
0:05:44.2,000 --> 0:05:46,000
being performed in the bed of a flatbed truck

111
0:05:46.76,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that moves from neighborhood to neighborhood.

112
0:05:49.96,000 --> 0:05:5,000
In Philadelphia,

113
0:05:51.2,000 --> 0:05:54,000
it's a voting-themed scavenger hunt all throughout colonial old town.

114
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
And in Wichita, it's making mixtapes and live graffiti art

115
0:06:00.2,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in the North End to get out the vote.

116
0:06:02.76,000 --> 0:06:03,000
There are 20 of these projects,

117
0:06:04.28,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and they are remarkable in their beauty and their diversity,

118
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and they are changing people.

119
0:06:08.76,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Let me tell you about a couple of them.

120
0:06:10.84,000 --> 0:06:11,000
In Miami, we've commissioned and artist,

121
0:06:12.84,000 --> 0:06:14,000
a young artist named Atomico,

122
0:06:14.88,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to create some vivid and vibrant images for a new series of "I voted" stickers.

123
0:06:19.88,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But the thing is, Atomico had never voted.

124
0:06:23.08,000 --> 0:06:24,000
He wasn't even registered.

125
0:06:24.8,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So as he got to work on creating this artwork for these stickers,

126
0:06:29.32,000 --> 0:06:33,000
he also began to get over his sense of intimidation about politics.

127
0:06:33.48,000 --> 0:06:34,000
He got himself registered,

128
0:06:35.12,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and then he got educated about the upcoming primary election,

129
0:06:38.44,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and on election day he was out there not just passing out stickers,

130
0:06:41.76,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but chatting up voters and encouraging people to vote,

131
0:06:44.36,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and talking about the election with passersby.

132
0:06:47.72,000 --> 0:06:5,000
In Akron, a theater company called the Wandering Aesthetics

133
0:06:51.52,000 --> 0:06:53,000
has been putting on these pickup truck plays.

134
0:06:54.32,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And to do so, they put out an open call to the public

135
0:06:57.12,000 --> 0:07:,000
asking for speeches, monologues, dialogues, poems,

136
0:07:00.64,000 --> 0:07:02,000
snippets of anything that could be read aloud

137
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and woven into a performance.

138
0:07:05.28,000 --> 0:07:06,000
They got dozens of submissions.

139
0:07:07.72,000 --> 0:07:08,000
One of them was a poem

140
0:07:09.64,000 --> 0:07:12,000
written by nine students in an ESL class,

141
0:07:12.8,000 --> 0:07:14,000
all of them Hispanic migrant workers

142
0:07:14.96,000 --> 0:07:16,000
from nearby Hartville, Ohio.

143
0:07:17.88,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I want to read to you from this poem.

144
0:07:21.2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It's called "The Joy of Voting."

145
0:07:24.6,000 --> 0:07:26,000
"I would like to vote for the first time

146
0:07:27.04,000 --> 0:07:29,000
because things are changing for Hispanics.

147
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I used to be afraid of ghosts.

148
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Now I am afraid of people.

149
0:07:34.48,000 --> 0:07:35,000
There's more violence and racism.

150
0:07:36.96,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Voting can change this.

151
0:07:39.84,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The border wall is nothing.

152
0:07:41.8,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's just a wall.

153
0:07:44.04,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The wall of shame is something.

154
0:07:47.8,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's very important to vote

155
0:07:49.72,000 --> 0:07:51,000
so we can break down this wall of shame.

156
0:07:53.32,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I have passion in my heart.

157
0:07:55.48,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Voting gives me a voice and power.

158
0:07:58.4,000 --> 0:08:,000
I can stand up and do something."

159
0:08:02.96,000 --> 0:08:04,000
"The Joy of Voting" project isn't just about joy.

160
0:08:05.92,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It's about this passion.

161
0:08:07.48,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's about feeling and belief,

162
0:08:09.84,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and it isn't just our organization's work.

163
0:08:12.56,000 --> 0:08:13,000
All across this country right now,

164
0:08:14.52,000 --> 0:08:17,000
immigrants, young people, veterans, people of all different backgrounds

165
0:08:17.92,000 --> 0:08:2,000
are coming together to create this kind of passionate, joyful activity

166
0:08:21.44,000 --> 0:08:22,000
around elections,

167
0:08:22.88,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in red and blue states, in urban and rural communities,

168
0:08:25.84,000 --> 0:08:27,000
people of every political background.

169
0:08:27.96,000 --> 0:08:29,000
What they have in common is simply this:

170
0:08:30.68,000 --> 0:08:32,000
their work is rooted in place.

171
0:08:34.32,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Because remember, all citizenship is local.

172
0:08:37.72,000 --> 0:08:4,000
When politics becomes just a presidential election,

173
0:08:41.28,000 --> 0:08:44,000
we yell and we scream at our screens, and then we collapse, exhausted.

174
0:08:45.679,000 --> 0:08:48,000
But when politics is about us

175
0:08:49.32,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and our neighbors and other people in our community

176
0:08:52.12,000 --> 0:08:56,000
coming together to create experiences of collective voice and imagination,

177
0:08:57.44,000 --> 0:08:59,000
then we begin to remember that this stuff matters.

178
0:09:00.56,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We begin to remember that this is the stuff of self-government.

179
0:09:05.24,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Which brings me back to where I began.

180
0:09:07.88,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Why bother?

181
0:09:09.64,000 --> 0:09:1,000
There's one way to answer this question.

182
0:09:12.44,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Voting matters because it is a self-fulfilling act of belief.

183
0:09:17.44,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It feeds the spirit of mutual interest that makes any society thrive.

184
0:09:22.96,000 --> 0:09:24,000
When we vote, even if it is in anger,

185
0:09:25.64,000 --> 0:09:27,000
we are part of a collective, creative leap of faith.

186
0:09:29.84,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Voting helps us generate the very power that we wish we had.

187
0:09:34.24,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It's no accident that democracy and theater

188
0:09:37.08,000 --> 0:09:39,000
emerged around the same time in ancient Athens.

189
0:09:40.2,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Both of them yank the individual out of the enclosure of her private self.

190
0:09:45.44,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Both of them create great public experiences of shared ritual.

191
0:09:50.2,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Both of them bring the imagination to life

192
0:09:52.76,000 --> 0:09:55,000
in ways that remind us that all of our bonds in the end

193
0:09:56.08,000 --> 0:09:58,000
are imagined, and can be reimagined.

194
0:10:02.76,000 --> 0:10:03,000
This moment right now,

195
0:10:04.8,000 --> 0:10:07,000
when we think about the meaning of imagination,

196
0:10:08.24,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is so fundamentally important,

197
0:10:12.48,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and our ability to take that spirit

198
0:10:15.68,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and to take that sense

199
0:10:17.28,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that there is something greater out there,

200
0:10:19.36,000 --> 0:10:22,000
is not just a matter of technical expertise.

201
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
It's not just a matter of making the time or having the know-how.

202
0:10:26.24,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It is a matter of spirit.

203
0:10:28.72,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But let me give you an answer to this question, "Why bother?"

204
0:10:31.68,000 --> 0:10:34,000
that is maybe a little less spiritual and a bit more pointed.

205
0:10:36.44,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Why bother voting?

206
0:10:38.24,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Because there is no such thing as not voting.

207
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Not voting is voting,

208
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:45,000
for everything that you may detest and oppose.

209
0:10:45.92,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Not voting can be dressed up

210
0:10:47.68,000 --> 0:10:5,000
as an act of principled, passive resistance,

211
0:10:50.72,000 --> 0:10:51,000
but in fact not voting

212
0:10:52.68,000 --> 0:10:54,000
is actively handing power over

213
0:10:54.92,000 --> 0:10:56,000
to those whose interests are counter to your own,

214
0:10:57.28,000 --> 0:11:,000
and those who would be very glad to take advantage of your absence.

215
0:11:00.84,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Not voting is for suckers.

216
0:11:04.8,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Imagine where this country would be

217
0:11:06.52,000 --> 0:11:09,000
if all the folks who in 2010 created the Tea Party

218
0:11:09.64,000 --> 0:11:11,000
had decided that, you know, politics is too messy,

219
0:11:12.6,000 --> 0:11:13,000
voting is too complicated.

220
0:11:13.88,000 --> 0:11:15,000
There is no possibility of our votes adding up to anything.

221
0:11:17.32,000 --> 0:11:19,000
They didn't preemptively silence themselves.

222
0:11:19.64,000 --> 0:11:2,000
They showed up,

223
0:11:21.44,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and in the course of showing up, they changed American politics.

224
0:11:25.48,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Imagine if all of the followers of Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders

225
0:11:30.28,000 --> 0:11:33,000
had decided not to upend the political status quo

226
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and blow apart the frame of the previously possible

227
0:11:37.08,000 --> 0:11:38,000
in American politics.

228
0:11:38.72,000 --> 0:11:39,000
They did that by voting.

229
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We live in a time right now,

230
0:11:45.4,000 --> 0:11:47,000
divided, often very dark,

231
0:11:47.96,000 --> 0:11:5,000
where across the left and the right, there's a lot of talk of revolution

232
0:11:51.6,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and the need for revolution to disrupt everyday democracy.

233
0:11:55.12,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Well, here's the thing:

234
0:11:56.76,000 --> 0:11:59,000
everyday democracy already gives us a playbook for revolution.

235
0:12:00.76,000 --> 0:12:02,000
In the 2012 presidential election,

236
0:12:02.84,000 --> 0:12:03,000
young voters, Latino voters,

237
0:12:04.6,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Asian-American voters, low-income voters,

238
0:12:06.88,000 --> 0:12:08,000
all showed up at less than 50 percent.

239
0:12:11.2,000 --> 0:12:15,000
In the 2014 midterm elections, turnout was 36 percent,

240
0:12:15.28,000 --> 0:12:16,000
which was a 70-year low.

241
0:12:17.92,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And in your average local election,

242
0:12:19.84,000 --> 0:12:21,000
turnout hovers somewhere around 20 percent.

243
0:12:23.32,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I invite you to imagine 100 percent.

244
0:12:27.64,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Picture 100 percent.

245
0:12:30.08,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Mobilize 100 percent,

246
0:12:32.24,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and overnight, we get revolution.

247
0:12:35.04,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Overnight, the policy priorities of this country change dramatically,

248
0:12:39.08,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and every level of government becomes radically more responsive

249
0:12:42.64,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to all the people.

250
0:12:45.24,000 --> 0:12:47,000
What would it take to mobilize 100 percent?

251
0:12:48.48,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Well, we do have to push back against efforts afoot

252
0:12:51.04,000 --> 0:12:52,000
all across the country right now

253
0:12:52.8,000 --> 0:12:53,000
to make voting harder.

254
0:12:54.48,000 --> 0:12:55,000
But at the same time,

255
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
we have to actively create a positive culture of voting

256
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
that people want to belong to,

257
0:13:00.8,000 --> 0:13:02,000
be part of, and experience together.

258
0:13:03.36,000 --> 0:13:04,000
We have to make purpose.

259
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We have to make joy.

260
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So yes, let's have that revolution,

261
0:13:09.84,000 --> 0:13:11,000
a revolution of spirit, of ideas,

262
0:13:12.36,000 --> 0:13:14,000
of policy and participation,

263
0:13:14.4,000 --> 0:13:16,000
a revolution against cynicism,

264
0:13:16.56,000 --> 0:13:19,000
a revolution against the self-fulfilling sense of powerlessness.

265
0:13:20.52,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Let's vote this revolution into existence,

266
0:13:23.88,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and while we're at it,

267
0:13:25.24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
let's have some fun.

268
0:13:26.8,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Thank you very much.

269
0:13:28.04,000 --> 0:13:3,000
(Applause)

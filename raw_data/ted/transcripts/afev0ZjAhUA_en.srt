1
0:00:13.206,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm driven by pure passion

2
0:00:15.366,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to create photographs that tell stories.

3
0:00:18.767,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Photography can be described as the recording of a single moment

4
0:00:23.269,000 --> 0:00:25,000
frozen within a fraction of time.

5
0:00:26.184,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Each moment or photograph represents a tangible piece

6
0:00:30.361,000 --> 0:00:32,000
of our memories as time passes.

7
0:00:33.547,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But what if you could capture more than one moment in a photograph?

8
0:00:37.551,000 --> 0:00:39,000
What if a photograph could actually collapse time,

9
0:00:41.222,000 --> 0:00:43,000
compressing the best moments of the day and the night

10
0:00:44.164,000 --> 0:00:46,000
seamlessly into one single image?

11
0:00:47.395,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I've created a concept called "Day to Night"

12
0:00:50.196,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I believe it's going to change

13
0:00:51.847,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the way you look at the world.

14
0:00:53.308,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I know it has for me.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
My process begins by photographing iconic locations,

16
0:00:59.894,000 --> 0:01:01,000
places that are part of what I call our collective memory.

17
0:01:03.57,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I photograph from a fixed vantage point, and I never move.

18
0:01:07.024,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I capture the fleeting moments of humanity and light as time passes.

19
0:01:11.981,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Photographing for anywhere from 15 to 30 hours

20
0:01:14.872,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and shooting over 1,500 images,

21
0:01:17.508,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I then choose the best moments of the day and night.

22
0:01:21.6,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Using time as a guide,

23
0:01:23.034,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I seamlessly blend those best moments into one single photograph,

24
0:01:27.351,000 --> 0:01:29,000
visualizing our conscious journey with time.

25
0:01:31.431,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I can take you to Paris

26
0:01:33.424,000 --> 0:01:34,000
for a view from the Tournelle Bridge.

27
0:01:36.342,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And I can show you the early morning rowers

28
0:01:38.48,000 --> 0:01:39,000
along the River Seine.

29
0:01:40.554,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And simultaneously,

30
0:01:42.42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I can show you Notre Dame aglow at night.

31
0:01:45.82,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And in between, I can show you the romance of the City of Light.

32
0:01:51.885,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I am essentially a street photographer from 50 feet in the air,

33
0:01:55.201,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and every single thing you see in this photograph

34
0:01:57.555,000 --> 0:01:58,000
actually happened on this day.

35
0:02:02.549,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Day to Night is a global project,

36
0:02:04.726,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and my work has always been about history.

37
0:02:07.975,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I'm fascinated by the concept of going to a place like Venice

38
0:02:11.441,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and actually seeing it during a specific event.

39
0:02:13.993,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And I decided I wanted to see the historical Regata,

40
0:02:17.45,000 --> 0:02:2,000
an event that's actually been taking place since 1498.

41
0:02:21.906,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The boats and the costumes look exactly as they did then.

42
0:02:26.821,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And an important element that I really want you guys to understand is:

43
0:02:30.347,000 --> 0:02:31,000
this is not a timelapse,

44
0:02:31.845,000 --> 0:02:34,000
this is me photographing throughout the day and the night.

45
0:02:37.181,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I am a relentless collector of magical moments.

46
0:02:40.848,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And the thing that drives me is the fear of just missing one of them.

47
0:02:48.227,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The entire concept came about in 1996.

48
0:02:52.893,000 --> 0:02:56,000
LIFE Magazine commissioned me to create a panoramic photograph

49
0:02:57.142,000 --> 0:03:01,000
of the cast and crew of Baz Luhrmann's film Romeo + Juliet.

50
0:03:02.71,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I got to the set and realized: it's a square.

51
0:03:06.111,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So the only way I could actually create a panoramic was to shoot a collage

52
0:03:10.533,000 --> 0:03:12,000
of 250 single images.

53
0:03:13.391,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So I had DiCaprio and Claire Danes embracing.

54
0:03:16.973,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And as I pan my camera to the right,

55
0:03:19.787,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I noticed there was a mirror on the wall

56
0:03:22.409,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and I saw they were actually reflecting in it.

57
0:03:24.848,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And for that one moment, that one image

58
0:03:26.802,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I asked them, "Would you guys just kiss

59
0:03:28.692,000 --> 0:03:29,000
for this one picture?"

60
0:03:30.085,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And then I came back to my studio in New York,

61
0:03:32.9,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and I hand-glued these 250 images together

62
0:03:36.845,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and stood back and went, "Wow, this is so cool!

63
0:03:39.694,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I'm changing time in a photograph."

64
0:03:42.422,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And that concept actually stayed with me for 13 years

65
0:03:46.636,000 --> 0:03:49,000
until technology finally has caught up to my dreams.

66
0:03:51.401,000 --> 0:03:54,000
This is an image I created of the Santa Monica Pier, Day to Night.

67
0:03:54.88,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And I'm going to show you a little video

68
0:03:56.833,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that gives you an idea of what it's like being with me

69
0:03:59.41,000 --> 0:04:,000
when I do these pictures.

70
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
To start with, you have to understand that to get views like this,

71
0:04:04.79,000 --> 0:04:07,000
most of my time is spent up high, and I'm usually in a cherry picker

72
0:04:08.543,000 --> 0:04:09,000
or a crane.

73
0:04:09.718,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So this is a typical day, 12-18 hours, non-stop

74
0:04:13.134,000 --> 0:04:15,000
capturing the entire day unfold.

75
0:04:16.29,000 --> 0:04:18,000
One of the things that's great is I love to people-watch.

76
0:04:19.29,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And trust me when I tell you,

77
0:04:20.727,000 --> 0:04:22,000
this is the greatest seat in the house to have.

78
0:04:24.226,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But this is really how I go about creating these photographs.

79
0:04:27.785,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So once I decide on my view and the location,

80
0:04:31.521,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I have to decide where day begins and night ends.

81
0:04:34.704,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And that's what I call the time vector.

82
0:04:37.476,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Einstein described time as a fabric.

83
0:04:41.257,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Think of the surface of a trampoline:

84
0:04:43.659,000 --> 0:04:45,000
it warps and stretches with gravity.

85
0:04:46.924,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I see time as a fabric as well,

86
0:04:49.742,000 --> 0:04:54,000
except I take that fabric and flatten it, compress it into single plane.

87
0:04:55.095,000 --> 0:04:57,000
One of the unique aspects of this work is also,

88
0:04:57.318,000 --> 0:04:58,000
if you look at all my pictures,

89
0:04:58.842,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the time vector changes:

90
0:05:00.376,000 --> 0:05:01,000
sometimes I'll go left to right,

91
0:05:02.086,000 --> 0:05:06,000
sometimes front to back, up or down, even diagonally.

92
0:05:07.249,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I am exploring the space-time continuum

93
0:05:10.01,000 --> 0:05:12,000
within a two-dimensional still photograph.

94
0:05:13.114,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now when I do these pictures,

95
0:05:15.042,000 --> 0:05:17,000
it's literally like a real-time puzzle going on in my mind.

96
0:05:18.75,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I build a photograph based on time,

97
0:05:21.432,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and this is what I call the master plate.

98
0:05:23.766,000 --> 0:05:25,000
This can take us several months to complete.

99
0:05:27.126,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The fun thing about this work is

100
0:05:29.449,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I have absolutely zero control when I get up there

101
0:05:32.803,000 --> 0:05:34,000
on any given day and capture photographs.

102
0:05:35.218,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So I never know who's going to be in the picture,

103
0:05:37.536,000 --> 0:05:39,000
if it's going to be a great sunrise or sunset -- no control.

104
0:05:40.543,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It's at the end of the process,

105
0:05:42.385,000 --> 0:05:45,000
if I've had a really great day and everything remained the same,

106
0:05:45.417,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that I then decide who's in and who's out,

107
0:05:48.05,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and it's all based on time.

108
0:05:49.809,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I'll take those best moments that I pick over a month of editing

109
0:05:53.256,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and they get seamlessly blended into the master plate.

110
0:05:58.168,000 --> 0:06:,000
I'm compressing the day and night

111
0:06:00.487,000 --> 0:06:01,000
as I saw it,

112
0:06:02.151,000 --> 0:06:05,000
creating a unique harmony between these two very discordant worlds.

113
0:06:07.268,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Painting has always been a really important influence in all my work

114
0:06:11.13,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and I've always been a huge fan of Albert Bierstadt,

115
0:06:13.865,000 --> 0:06:14,000
the great Hudson River School painter.

116
0:06:15.723,000 --> 0:06:18,000
He inspired a recent series that I did on the National Parks.

117
0:06:19.12,000 --> 0:06:21,000
This is Bierstadt's Yosemite Valley.

118
0:06:22.347,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So this is the photograph I created of Yosemite.

119
0:06:25.427,000 --> 0:06:28,000
This is actually the cover story of the 2016 January issue

120
0:06:29.23,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of National Geographic.

121
0:06:31.592,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I photographed for over 30 hours in this picture.

122
0:06:34.371,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I was literally on the side of a cliff,

123
0:06:37.044,000 --> 0:06:41,000
capturing the stars and the moonlight as it transitions,

124
0:06:41.109,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the moonlight lighting El Capitan.

125
0:06:42.988,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And I also captured this transition of time throughout the landscape.

126
0:06:47.641,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The best part is obviously seeing the magical moments of humanity

127
0:06:51.614,000 --> 0:06:52,000
as time changed --

128
0:06:54.831,000 --> 0:06:55,000
from day into night.

129
0:06:58.072,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And on a personal note,

130
0:06:59.634,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I actually had a photocopy of Bierstadt's painting in my pocket.

131
0:07:03.783,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And when that sun started to rise in the valley,

132
0:07:06.055,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I started to literally shake with excitement

133
0:07:08.329,000 --> 0:07:1,000
because I looked at the painting and I go,

134
0:07:10.631,000 --> 0:07:13,000
"Oh my god, I'm getting Bierstadt's exact same lighting

135
0:07:14.044,000 --> 0:07:15,000
100 years earlier."

136
0:07:17.757,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Day to Night is about all the things,

137
0:07:20.64,000 --> 0:07:22,000
it's like a compilation of all the things I love

138
0:07:22.911,000 --> 0:07:24,000
about the medium of photography.

139
0:07:25.071,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It's about landscape,

140
0:07:26.748,000 --> 0:07:27,000
it's about street photography,

141
0:07:28.371,000 --> 0:07:3,000
it's about color, it's about architecture,

142
0:07:30.697,000 --> 0:07:33,000
perspective, scale -- and, especially, history.

143
0:07:34.371,000 --> 0:07:36,000
This is one of the most historical moments

144
0:07:36.396,000 --> 0:07:37,000
I've been able to photograph,

145
0:07:37.808,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the 2013 Presidential Inauguration of Barack Obama.

146
0:07:41.682,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And if you look closely in this picture,

147
0:07:43.831,000 --> 0:07:45,000
you can actually see time changing

148
0:07:45.932,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in those large television sets.

149
0:07:47.901,000 --> 0:07:49,000
You can see Michelle waiting with the children,

150
0:07:50.541,000 --> 0:07:51,000
the president now greets the crowd,

151
0:07:52.424,000 --> 0:07:53,000
he takes his oath,

152
0:07:53.7,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and now he's speaking to the people.

153
0:07:56.698,000 --> 0:08:,000
There's so many challenging aspects when I create photographs like this.

154
0:08:01.096,000 --> 0:08:02,000
For this particular photograph,

155
0:08:03.093,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I was in a 50-foot scissor lift up in the air

156
0:08:06.732,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and it was not very stable.

157
0:08:08.05,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So every time my assistant and I shifted our weight,

158
0:08:11.242,000 --> 0:08:12,000
our horizon line shifted.

159
0:08:12.804,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So for every picture you see,

160
0:08:14.447,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and there were about 1,800 in this picture,

161
0:08:16.86,000 --> 0:08:18,000
we both had to tape our feet into position

162
0:08:19.843,000 --> 0:08:21,000
every time I clicked the shutter.

163
0:08:22.01,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Applause)

164
0:08:26.202,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I've learned so many extraordinary things doing this work.

165
0:08:30.868,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I think the two most important are patience

166
0:08:34.297,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and the power of observation.

167
0:08:36.958,000 --> 0:08:39,000
When you photograph a city like New York from above,

168
0:08:40.384,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I discovered that those people in cars

169
0:08:42.522,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that I sort of live with everyday,

170
0:08:44.856,000 --> 0:08:46,000
they don't look like people in cars anymore.

171
0:08:46.936,000 --> 0:08:48,000
They feel like a giant school of fish,

172
0:08:49.438,000 --> 0:08:5,000
it was a form of emergent behavior.

173
0:08:52.063,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And when people describe the energy of New York,

174
0:08:55.007,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I think this photograph begins to really capture that.

175
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
When you look closer in my work,

176
0:09:00.019,000 --> 0:09:02,000
you can see there's stories going on.

177
0:09:02.235,000 --> 0:09:04,000
You realize that Times Square is a canyon,

178
0:09:05.198,000 --> 0:09:07,000
it's shadow and it's sunlight.

179
0:09:07.883,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So I decided, in this photograph, I would checkerboard time.

180
0:09:11.105,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So wherever the shadows are, it's night

181
0:09:13.19,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and wherever the sun is, it's actually day.

182
0:09:16.453,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Time is this extraordinary thing

183
0:09:18.727,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that we never can really wrap our heads around.

184
0:09:21.94,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But in a very unique and special way,

185
0:09:23.966,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I believe these photographs begin to put a face on time.

186
0:09:28.703,000 --> 0:09:32,000
They embody a new metaphysical visual reality.

187
0:09:34.996,000 --> 0:09:36,000
When you spend 15 hours looking at a place,

188
0:09:38.917,000 --> 0:09:4,000
you're going to see things a little differently

189
0:09:41.148,000 --> 0:09:43,000
than if you or I walked up with our camera,

190
0:09:43.18,000 --> 0:09:44,000
took a picture, and then walked away.

191
0:09:45.175,000 --> 0:09:46,000
This was a perfect example.

192
0:09:47.175,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I call it "Sacré-Coeur Selfie."

193
0:09:49.667,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I watched over 15 hours

194
0:09:51.469,000 --> 0:09:53,000
all these people not even look at Sacré-Coeur.

195
0:09:54.041,000 --> 0:09:56,000
They were more interested in using it as a backdrop.

196
0:09:57.106,000 --> 0:09:59,000
They would walk up, take a picture,

197
0:09:59.958,000 --> 0:10:,000
and then walk away.

198
0:10:02.089,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And I found this to be an absolutely extraordinary example,

199
0:10:07.239,000 --> 0:10:11,000
a powerful disconnect between what we think the human experience is

200
0:10:11.723,000 --> 0:10:14,000
versus what the human experience is evolving into.

201
0:10:15.922,000 --> 0:10:19,000
The act of sharing has suddenly become more important

202
0:10:20.788,000 --> 0:10:21,000
than the experience itself.

203
0:10:23.416,000 --> 0:10:26,000
(Applause)

204
0:10:26.681,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And finally, my most recent image,

205
0:10:29.841,000 --> 0:10:32,000
which has such a special meaning for me personally:

206
0:10:33.135,000 --> 0:10:36,000
this is the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania.

207
0:10:36.925,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And this is photographed in the middle of the Seronera,

208
0:10:39.521,000 --> 0:10:4,000
this is not a reserve.

209
0:10:41.532,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I went specifically during the peak migration

210
0:10:44.464,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to hopefully capture the most diverse range of animals.

211
0:10:48.503,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Unfortunately, when we got there,

212
0:10:50.107,000 --> 0:10:52,000
there was a drought going on during the peak migration,

213
0:10:52.711,000 --> 0:10:53,000
a five-week drought.

214
0:10:53.886,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So all the animals were drawn to the water.

215
0:10:56.503,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I found this one watering hole,

216
0:10:58.768,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and felt if everything remained the same way it was behaving,

217
0:11:02.817,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I had a real opportunity to capture something unique.

218
0:11:06.325,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We spent three days studying it,

219
0:11:08.154,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and nothing could have prepared me

220
0:11:09.845,000 --> 0:11:11,000
for what I witnessed during our shoot day.

221
0:11:12.438,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I photographed for 26 hours

222
0:11:15.27,000 --> 0:11:18,000
in a sealed crocodile blind, 18 feet in the air.

223
0:11:19.34,000 --> 0:11:21,000
What I witnessed was unimaginable.

224
0:11:21.92,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Frankly, it was Biblical.

225
0:11:23.491,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We saw, for 26 hours,

226
0:11:25.57,000 --> 0:11:3,000
all these competitive species share a single resource called water.

227
0:11:31.115,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The same resource that humanity is supposed to have wars over

228
0:11:34.999,000 --> 0:11:35,000
during the next 50 years.

229
0:11:37.301,000 --> 0:11:4,000
The animals never even grunted at each other.

230
0:11:41.515,000 --> 0:11:44,000
They seem to understand something that we humans don't.

231
0:11:45.65,000 --> 0:11:47,000
That this precious resource called water

232
0:11:48.479,000 --> 0:11:5,000
is something we all have to share.

233
0:11:51.699,000 --> 0:11:53,000
When I created this picture,

234
0:11:55.222,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I realized that Day to Night is really a new way of seeing,

235
0:12:00.127,000 --> 0:12:01,000
compressing time,

236
0:12:02.349,000 --> 0:12:05,000
exploring the space-time continuum within a photograph.

237
0:12:06.809,000 --> 0:12:09,000
As technology evolves along with photography,

238
0:12:11.229,000 --> 0:12:15,000
photographs will not only communicate a deeper meaning of time and memory,

239
0:12:15.92,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but they will compose a new narrative of untold stories,

240
0:12:22.594,000 --> 0:12:25,000
creating a timeless window into our world.

241
0:12:27.285,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Thank you.

242
0:12:28.46,000 --> 0:12:34,000
(Applause)

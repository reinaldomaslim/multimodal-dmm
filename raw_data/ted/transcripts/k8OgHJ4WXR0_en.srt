1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm here to tell you about the real search for alien life.

2
0:00:16.675,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Not little green humanoids arriving in shiny UFOs,

3
0:00:19.93,000 --> 0:00:2,000
although that would be nice.

4
0:00:21.678,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But it's the search for planets orbiting stars far away.

5
0:00:25.924,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Every star in our sky is a sun.

6
0:00:27.783,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And if our sun has planets --

7
0:00:29.188,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, etc.,

8
0:00:31.709,000 --> 0:00:33,000
surely those other stars should have planets also,

9
0:00:34.169,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and they do.

10
0:00:35.455,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And in the last two decades,

11
0:00:36.891,000 --> 0:00:38,000
astronomers have found thousands of exoplanets.

12
0:00:40.502,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Our night sky is literally teeming with exoplanets.

13
0:00:43.337,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We know, statistically speaking,

14
0:00:44.913,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that every star has at least one planet.

15
0:00:47.984,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And in the search for planets,

16
0:00:49.985,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and in the future, planets that might be like Earth,

17
0:00:52.775,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we're able to help address

18
0:00:54.168,000 --> 0:00:56,000
some of the most amazing and mysterious questions

19
0:00:57.041,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that have faced humankind for centuries.

20
0:00:59.636,000 --> 0:01:,000
Why are we here?

21
0:01:01.215,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Why does our universe exist?

22
0:01:03.476,000 --> 0:01:05,000
How did Earth form and evolve?

23
0:01:05.912,000 --> 0:01:07,000
How and why did life originate and populate our planet?

24
0:01:09.665,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The second question that we often think about is:

25
0:01:12.744,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Are we alone?

26
0:01:14.911,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Is there life out there?

27
0:01:17.109,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Who is out there?

28
0:01:19.783,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You know, this question has been around for thousands of years,

29
0:01:22.813,000 --> 0:01:24,000
since at least the time of the Greek philosophers.

30
0:01:25.254,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But I'm here to tell you just how close we're getting

31
0:01:27.825,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to finding out the answer to this question.

32
0:01:30.73,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's the first time in human history that this really is within reach for us.

33
0:01:35.294,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Now when I think about the possibilities for life out there,

34
0:01:38.297,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I think of the fact that our sun is but one of many stars.

35
0:01:42.825,000 --> 0:01:43,000
This is a photograph of a real galaxy,

36
0:01:44.727,000 --> 0:01:46,000
we think our Milky Way looks like this galaxy.

37
0:01:47.197,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It's a collection of bound stars.

38
0:01:48.86,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But our [sun] is one of hundreds of billions of stars

39
0:01:53.271,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and our galaxy is one of upwards of hundreds of billions of galaxies.

40
0:01:58.707,000 --> 0:02:,000
Knowing that small planets are very common,

41
0:02:01.498,000 --> 0:02:02,000
you can just do the math.

42
0:02:03.424,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And there are just so many stars and so many planets out there,

43
0:02:07.449,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that surely, there must be life somewhere out there.

44
0:02:11.06,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Well, the biologists get furious with me for saying that,

45
0:02:14.504,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because we have absolutely no evidence for life beyond Earth yet.

46
0:02:18.977,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Well, if we were able to look at our galaxy from the outside

47
0:02:23.794,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and zoom in to where our sun is,

48
0:02:26.026,000 --> 0:02:27,000
we see a real map of the stars.

49
0:02:28.046,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And the highlighted stars are those with known exoplanets.

50
0:02:31.745,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This is really just the tip of the iceberg.

51
0:02:34.642,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Here, this animation is zooming in onto our solar system.

52
0:02:38.872,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And you'll see here the planets

53
0:02:40.381,000 --> 0:02:42,000
as well as some spacecraft that are also orbiting our sun.

54
0:02:44.968,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now if we can imagine going to the West Coast of North America,

55
0:02:48.356,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and looking out at the night sky,

56
0:02:50.506,000 --> 0:02:52,000
here's what we'd see on a spring night.

57
0:02:52.808,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And you can see the constellations overlaid

58
0:02:54.842,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and again, so many stars with planets.

59
0:02:57.135,000 --> 0:03:01,000
There's a special patch of the sky where we have thousands of planets.

60
0:03:01.353,000 --> 0:03:04,000
This is where the Kepler Space Telescope focused for many years.

61
0:03:05.576,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Let's zoom in and look at one of the favorite exoplanets.

62
0:03:10.863,000 --> 0:03:13,000
This star is called Kepler-186f.

63
0:03:14.529,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It's a system of about five planets.

64
0:03:16.751,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And by the way, most of these exoplanets, we don't know too much about.

65
0:03:20.6,000 --> 0:03:22,000
We know their size, and their orbit and things like that.

66
0:03:23.607,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But there's a very special planet here called Kepler-186f.

67
0:03:27.593,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This planet is in a zone that is not too far from the star,

68
0:03:31.721,000 --> 0:03:34,000
so that the temperature may be just right for life.

69
0:03:35.004,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Here, the artist's conception is just zooming in

70
0:03:38.059,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and showing you what that planet might be like.

71
0:03:43.074,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So, many people have this romantic notion of astronomers

72
0:03:48.7,000 --> 0:03:51,000
going to the telescope on a lonely mountaintop

73
0:03:52.28,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and looking at the spectacular night sky through a big telescope.

74
0:03:55.853,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But actually, we just work on our computers like everyone else,

75
0:03:59.249,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and we get our data by email or downloading from a database.

76
0:04:03.098,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So instead of coming here to tell you

77
0:04:05.645,000 --> 0:04:08,000
about the somewhat tedious nature of the data and data analysis

78
0:04:08.8,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and the complex computer models we make,

79
0:04:10.89,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I have a different way to try to explain to you

80
0:04:13.112,000 --> 0:04:15,000
some of the things that we're thinking about exoplanets.

81
0:04:15.781,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Here's a travel poster:

82
0:04:16.971,000 --> 0:04:18,000
"Kepler-186f:

83
0:04:19.315,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Where the grass is always redder on the other side."

84
0:04:22.053,000 --> 0:04:25,000
That's because Kepler-186f orbits a red star,

85
0:04:25.807,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and we're just speculating that perhaps the plants there,

86
0:04:28.523,000 --> 0:04:3,000
if there is vegetation that does photosynthesis,

87
0:04:31.165,000 --> 0:04:32,000
it has different pigments and looks red.

88
0:04:34.137,000 --> 0:04:38,000
"Enjoy the gravity on HD 40307g,

89
0:04:38.519,000 --> 0:04:39,000
a Super-Earth."

90
0:04:40.002,000 --> 0:04:42,000
This planet is more massive than Earth

91
0:04:42.183,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and has a higher surface gravity.

92
0:04:44.333,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"Relax on Kepler-16b,

93
0:04:47.254,000 --> 0:04:48,000
where your shadow always has company."

94
0:04:49.174,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:51.158,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We know of a dozen planets that orbit two stars,

96
0:04:55.364,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and there's likely many more out there.

97
0:04:57.507,000 --> 0:04:58,000
If we could visit one of those planets,

98
0:04:59.492,000 --> 0:05:,000
you literally would see two sunsets

99
0:05:01.403,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and have two shadows.

100
0:05:03.484,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So actually, science fiction got some things right.

101
0:05:05.925,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Tatooine from Star Wars.

102
0:05:08.047,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And I have a couple of other favorite exoplanets

103
0:05:10.366,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to tell you about.

104
0:05:11.587,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This one is Kepler-10b,

105
0:05:13.143,000 --> 0:05:14,000
it's a hot, hot planet.

106
0:05:15.642,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It orbits over 50 times closer to its star

107
0:05:18.601,000 --> 0:05:2,000
than our Earth does to our sun.

108
0:05:20.792,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And actually, it's so hot,

109
0:05:22.396,000 --> 0:05:24,000
we can't visit any of these planets, but if we could,

110
0:05:25.053,000 --> 0:05:26,000
we would melt long before we got there.

111
0:05:27.051,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We think the surface is hot enough to melt rock

112
0:05:29.404,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and has liquid lava lakes.

113
0:05:31.457,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Gliese 1214b.

114
0:05:33.065,000 --> 0:05:35,000
This planet, we know the mass and the size

115
0:05:35.188,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and it has a fairly low density.

116
0:05:36.8,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It's somewhat warm.

117
0:05:38.053,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We actually don't know really anything about this planet,

118
0:05:40.761,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but one possibility is that it's a water world,

119
0:05:43.29,000 --> 0:05:46,000
like a scaled-up version of one of Jupiter's icy moons

120
0:05:46.821,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that might be 50 percent water by mass.

121
0:05:49.328,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And in this case, it would have a thick steam atmosphere

122
0:05:52.313,000 --> 0:05:53,000
overlaying an ocean,

123
0:05:54.193,000 --> 0:05:55,000
not of liquid water,

124
0:05:55.727,000 --> 0:05:58,000
but of an exotic form of water, a superfluid --

125
0:05:58.756,000 --> 0:05:59,000
not quite a gas, not quite a liquid.

126
0:06:00.77,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And under that wouldn't be rock,

127
0:06:02.394,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but a form of high-pressure ice,

128
0:06:04.014,000 --> 0:06:05,000
like ice IX.

129
0:06:06.593,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So out of all these planets out there,

130
0:06:08.792,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and the variety is just simply astonishing,

131
0:06:12.03,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we mostly want to find the planets that are Goldilocks planets, we call them.

132
0:06:17.184,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Not too big, not too small,

133
0:06:19.125,000 --> 0:06:2,000
not too hot, not too cold --

134
0:06:20.996,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but just right for life.

135
0:06:22.658,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But to do that, we'd have to be able to look

136
0:06:24.8,000 --> 0:06:25,000
at the planet's atmosphere,

137
0:06:26.158,000 --> 0:06:28,000
because the atmosphere acts like a blanket trapping heat --

138
0:06:28.978,000 --> 0:06:29,000
the greenhouse effect.

139
0:06:30.338,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We have to be able to assess the greenhouse gases

140
0:06:33.182,000 --> 0:06:34,000
on other planets.

141
0:06:35.169,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Well, science fiction got some things wrong.

142
0:06:37.796,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The Star Trek Enterprise

143
0:06:39.21,000 --> 0:06:42,000
had to travel vast distances at incredible speeds

144
0:06:42.861,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to orbit other planets

145
0:06:44.614,000 --> 0:06:47,000
so that First Officer Spock could analyze the atmosphere

146
0:06:48.614,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to see if the planet was habitable

147
0:06:50.599,000 --> 0:06:51,000
or if there were lifeforms there.

148
0:06:52.745,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Well, we don't need to travel at warp speeds

149
0:06:55.259,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to see other planet atmospheres,

150
0:06:57.412,000 --> 0:06:59,000
although I don't want to dissuade any budding engineers

151
0:07:00.22,000 --> 0:07:01,000
from figuring out how to do that.

152
0:07:02.167,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We actually can and do study planet atmospheres

153
0:07:04.483,000 --> 0:07:05,000
from here, from Earth orbit.

154
0:07:06.12,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This is a picture, a photograph of the Hubble Space Telescope

155
0:07:09.321,000 --> 0:07:11,000
taken by the shuttle Atlantis as it was departing

156
0:07:12.095,000 --> 0:07:14,000
after the last human space flight to Hubble.

157
0:07:14.358,000 --> 0:07:15,000
They installed a new camera, actually,

158
0:07:16.268,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that we use for exoplanet atmospheres.

159
0:07:18.437,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And so far, we've been able to study dozens of exoplanet atmospheres,

160
0:07:23.366,000 --> 0:07:25,000
about six of them in great detail.

161
0:07:25.514,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But those are not small planets like Earth.

162
0:07:27.71,000 --> 0:07:29,000
They're big, hot planets that are easy to see.

163
0:07:30.128,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We're not ready,

164
0:07:31.39,000 --> 0:07:35,000
we don't have the right technology yet to study small exoplanets.

165
0:07:36.106,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But nevertheless,

166
0:07:37.288,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I wanted to try to explain to you how we study exoplanet atmospheres.

167
0:07:41.652,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I want you to imagine, for a moment, a rainbow.

168
0:07:44.532,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And if we could look at this rainbow closely,

169
0:07:47.302,000 --> 0:07:49,000
we would see that some dark lines are missing.

170
0:07:51.127,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And here's our sun,

171
0:07:52.572,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the white light of our sun split up,

172
0:07:54.363,000 --> 0:07:56,000
not by raindrops, but by a spectrograph.

173
0:07:56.673,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And you can see all these dark, vertical lines.

174
0:07:59.148,000 --> 0:08:,000
Some are very narrow, some are wide,

175
0:08:00.982,000 --> 0:08:01,000
some are shaded at the edges.

176
0:08:02.431,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And this is actually how astronomers have studied objects in the heavens,

177
0:08:06.059,000 --> 0:08:07,000
literally, for over a century.

178
0:08:07.578,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So here, each different atom and molecule

179
0:08:10.028,000 --> 0:08:11,000
has a special set of lines,

180
0:08:11.577,000 --> 0:08:12,000
a fingerprint, if you will.

181
0:08:13.157,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And that's how we study exoplanet atmospheres.

182
0:08:15.918,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And I'll just never forget when I started working

183
0:08:18.302,000 --> 0:08:19,000
on exoplanet atmospheres 20 years ago,

184
0:08:20.182,000 --> 0:08:21,000
how many people told me,

185
0:08:21.391,000 --> 0:08:22,000
"This will never happen.

186
0:08:22.624,000 --> 0:08:24,000
We'll never be able to study them. Why are you bothering?"

187
0:08:25.438,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And that's why I'm pleased to tell you about all the atmospheres studied now,

188
0:08:29.136,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and this is really a field of its own.

189
0:08:31.009,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So when it comes to other planets, other Earths,

190
0:08:33.555,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in the future when we can observe them,

191
0:08:35.656,000 --> 0:08:37,000
what kind of gases would we be looking for?

192
0:08:38.144,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Well, you know, our own Earth has oxygen in the atmosphere

193
0:08:41.343,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to 20 percent by volume.

194
0:08:43.445,000 --> 0:08:44,000
That's a lot of oxygen.

195
0:08:45.457,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But without plants and photosynthetic life,

196
0:08:48.226,000 --> 0:08:49,000
there would be no oxygen,

197
0:08:49.66,000 --> 0:08:5,000
virtually no oxygen in our atmosphere.

198
0:08:52.116,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So oxygen is here because of life.

199
0:08:54.063,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And our goal then is to look for gases in other planet atmospheres,

200
0:08:58.194,000 --> 0:09:,000
gases that don't belong,

201
0:09:00.255,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that we might be able to attribute to life.

202
0:09:02.662,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But which molecules should we search for?

203
0:09:04.767,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I actually told you how diverse exoplanets are.

204
0:09:07.454,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We expect that to continue in the future

205
0:09:09.475,000 --> 0:09:1,000
when we find other Earths.

206
0:09:10.8,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And that's one of the main things I'm working on now,

207
0:09:13.396,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I have a theory about this.

208
0:09:14.713,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It reminds me that nearly every day,

209
0:09:17.025,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I receive an email or emails

210
0:09:19.701,000 --> 0:09:22,000
from someone with a crazy theory about physics of gravity

211
0:09:23.352,000 --> 0:09:24,000
or cosmology or some such.

212
0:09:25.208,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So, please don't email me one of your crazy theories.

213
0:09:28.565,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Laughter)

214
0:09:29.803,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Well, I had my own crazy theory.

215
0:09:32.005,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But, who does the MIT professor go to?

216
0:09:34.703,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Well, I emailed a Nobel Laureate in Physiology or Medicine

217
0:09:38.938,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and he said, "Sure, come and talk to me."

218
0:09:40.935,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So I brought my two biochemistry friends

219
0:09:42.958,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and we went to talk to him about our crazy theory.

220
0:09:45.334,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And that theory was that life produces all small molecules,

221
0:09:48.799,000 --> 0:09:49,000
so many molecules.

222
0:09:50.497,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Like, everything I could think of, but not being a chemist.

223
0:09:53.416,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Think about it:

224
0:09:54.623,000 --> 0:09:56,000
carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide,

225
0:09:56.677,000 --> 0:09:57,000
molecular hydrogen, molecular nitrogen,

226
0:09:58.56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
methane, methyl chloride --

227
0:09:59.95,000 --> 0:10:,000
so many gases.

228
0:10:01.135,000 --> 0:10:02,000
They also exist for other reasons,

229
0:10:03.094,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but just life even produces ozone.

230
0:10:04.97,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So we go to talk to him about this,

231
0:10:06.752,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and immediately, he shot down the theory.

232
0:10:09.226,000 --> 0:10:11,000
He found an example that didn't exist.

233
0:10:11.948,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So, we went back to the drawing board

234
0:10:13.753,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and we think we have found something very interesting in another field.

235
0:10:17.205,000 --> 0:10:18,000
But back to exoplanets,

236
0:10:18.649,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the point is that life produces so many different types of gases,

237
0:10:21.952,000 --> 0:10:23,000
literally thousands of gases.

238
0:10:24.188,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And so what we're doing now is just trying to figure out

239
0:10:26.879,000 --> 0:10:27,000
on which types of exoplanets,

240
0:10:28.492,000 --> 0:10:31,000
which gases could be attributed to life.

241
0:10:34.182,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And so when it comes time when we find gases

242
0:10:36.254,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in exoplanet atmospheres

243
0:10:37.629,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that we won't know if they're being produced

244
0:10:39.749,000 --> 0:10:42,000
by intelligent aliens or by trees,

245
0:10:42.803,000 --> 0:10:43,000
or a swamp,

246
0:10:44.037,000 --> 0:10:46,000
or even just by simple, single-celled microbial life.

247
0:10:47.541,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So working on the models

248
0:10:49.115,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and thinking about biochemistry,

249
0:10:50.79,000 --> 0:10:51,000
it's all well and good.

250
0:10:52.011,000 --> 0:10:54,000
But a really big challenge ahead of us is: how?

251
0:10:54.92,000 --> 0:10:56,000
How are we going to find these planets?

252
0:10:57.106,000 --> 0:10:59,000
There are actually many ways to find planets,

253
0:10:59.31,000 --> 0:11:,000
several different ways.

254
0:11:00.853,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But the one that I'm most focused on is how can we open a gateway

255
0:11:04.736,000 --> 0:11:05,000
so that in the future,

256
0:11:05.997,000 --> 0:11:06,000
we can find hundreds of Earths.

257
0:11:07.87,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We have a real shot at finding signs of life.

258
0:11:10.227,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And actually, I just finished leading a two-year project

259
0:11:13.377,000 --> 0:11:15,000
in this very special phase

260
0:11:15.489,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of a concept we call the starshade.

261
0:11:18.167,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And the starshade is a very specially shaped screen

262
0:11:21.144,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and the goal is to fly that starshade

263
0:11:23.035,000 --> 0:11:26,000
so it blocks out the light of a star

264
0:11:26.153,000 --> 0:11:28,000
so that the telescope can see the planets directly.

265
0:11:29.116,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Here, you can see myself and two team members

266
0:11:31.533,000 --> 0:11:33,000
holding up one small part of the starshade.

267
0:11:33.746,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It's shaped like a giant flower,

268
0:11:35.35,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and this is one of the prototype petals.

269
0:11:38.907,000 --> 0:11:42,000
The concept is that a starshade and telescope could launch together,

270
0:11:43.392,000 --> 0:11:45,000
with the petals unfurling from the stowed position.

271
0:11:46.896,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The central truss would expand,

272
0:11:48.976,000 --> 0:11:51,000
with the petals snapping into place.

273
0:11:52.092,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Now, this has to be made very precisely,

274
0:11:54.346,000 --> 0:11:55,000
literally, the petals to microns

275
0:11:55.958,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and they have to deploy to millimeters.

276
0:11:58.697,000 --> 0:12:,000
And this whole structure would have to fly

277
0:12:00.776,000 --> 0:12:03,000
tens of thousands of kilometers away from the telescope.

278
0:12:04.159,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It's about tens of meters in diameter.

279
0:12:06.785,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And the goal is to block out the starlight to incredible precision

280
0:12:11.762,000 --> 0:12:13,000
so that we'd be able to see the planets directly.

281
0:12:15.333,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And it has to be a very special shape,

282
0:12:17.586,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because of the physics of defraction.

283
0:12:19.499,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Now this is a real project that we worked on,

284
0:12:21.742,000 --> 0:12:23,000
literally, you would not believe how hard.

285
0:12:24.234,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Just so you believe it's not just in movie format,

286
0:12:26.92,000 --> 0:12:27,000
here's a real photograph

287
0:12:28.58,000 --> 0:12:32,000
of a second-generation starshade deployment test bed in the lab.

288
0:12:33.595,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And in this case, I just wanted you to know

289
0:12:35.698,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that that central truss has heritage left over

290
0:12:38.212,000 --> 0:12:39,000
from large radio deployables in space.

291
0:12:41.372,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So after all of that hard work

292
0:12:43.052,000 --> 0:12:46,000
where we try to think of all the crazy gases that might be out there,

293
0:12:46.869,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and we build the very complicated space telescopes

294
0:12:49.821,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that might be out there,

295
0:12:51.072,000 --> 0:12:52,000
what are we going to find?

296
0:12:52.725,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Well, in the best case,

297
0:12:54.507,000 --> 0:12:56,000
we will find an image of another exo-Earth.

298
0:12:58.328,000 --> 0:13:,000
Here is Earth as a pale blue dot.

299
0:13:00.611,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And this is actually a real photograph of Earth

300
0:13:03.194,000 --> 0:13:04,000
taken by the Voyager 1 spacecraft,

301
0:13:05.088,000 --> 0:13:06,000
four billion miles away.

302
0:13:07.159,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And that red light is just scattered light in the camera optics.

303
0:13:11.315,000 --> 0:13:13,000
But what's so awesome to consider

304
0:13:13.735,000 --> 0:13:16,000
is that if there are intelligent aliens

305
0:13:16.808,000 --> 0:13:19,000
orbiting on a planet around a star near to us

306
0:13:20.786,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and they build complicated space telescopes

307
0:13:22.855,000 --> 0:13:23,000
of the kind that we're trying to build,

308
0:13:24.806,000 --> 0:13:26,000
all they'll see is this pale blue dot,

309
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
a pinprick of light.

310
0:13:29.456,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And so sometimes, when I pause to think

311
0:13:32.546,000 --> 0:13:36,000
about my professional struggle and huge ambition,

312
0:13:36.823,000 --> 0:13:37,000
it's hard to think about that

313
0:13:38.84,000 --> 0:13:4,000
in contrast to the vastness of the universe.

314
0:13:42.12,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But nonetheless, I am devoting the rest of my life

315
0:13:46.27,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to finding another Earth.

316
0:13:48.296,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And I can guarantee

317
0:13:50.535,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that in the next generation of space telescopes,

318
0:13:52.942,000 --> 0:13:53,000
in the second generation,

319
0:13:54.506,000 --> 0:13:59,000
we will have the capability to find and identity other Earths.

320
0:13:59.936,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And the capability to split up the starlight

321
0:14:02.634,000 --> 0:14:03,000
so that we can look for gases

322
0:14:04.211,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and assess the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere,

323
0:14:07.721,000 --> 0:14:08,000
estimate the surface temperature,

324
0:14:09.343,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and look for signs of life.

325
0:14:11.736,000 --> 0:14:12,000
But there's more.

326
0:14:13.181,000 --> 0:14:16,000
In this case of searching for other planets like Earth,

327
0:14:16.569,000 --> 0:14:18,000
we are making a new kind of map

328
0:14:19.188,000 --> 0:14:22,000
of the nearby stars and of the planets orbiting them,

329
0:14:22.472,000 --> 0:14:25,000
including [planets] that actually might be inhabitable by humans.

330
0:14:26.915,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And so I envision that our descendants,

331
0:14:29.32,000 --> 0:14:3,000
hundreds of years from now,

332
0:14:31.149,000 --> 0:14:34,000
will embark on an interstellar journey to other worlds.

333
0:14:35.059,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And they will look back at all of us

334
0:14:37.995,000 --> 0:14:4,000
as the generation who first found the Earth-like worlds.

335
0:14:41.822,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Thank you.

336
0:14:42.997,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Applause)

337
0:14:49.532,000 --> 0:14:51,000
June Cohen: And I give you, for a question,

338
0:14:51.656,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Rosetta Mission Manager Fred Jansen.

339
0:14:53.817,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Fred Jansen: You mentioned halfway through

340
0:14:55.872,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that the technology to actually look at the spectrum

341
0:14:59.683,000 --> 0:15:01,000
of an exoplanet like Earth is not there yet.

342
0:15:02.336,000 --> 0:15:03,000
When do you expect this will be there,

343
0:15:04.247,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and what's needed?

344
0:15:05.539,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Actually, what we expect is what we call our next-generation Hubble telescope.

345
0:15:10.531,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And this is called the James Webb Space Telescope,

346
0:15:12.896,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and that will launch in 2018,

347
0:15:14.623,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and that's what we're going to do,

348
0:15:16.469,000 --> 0:15:18,000
we're going to look at a special kind of planet

349
0:15:18.757,000 --> 0:15:19,000
called transient exoplanets,

350
0:15:20.237,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and that will be our first shot at studying small planets

351
0:15:23.362,000 --> 0:15:26,000
for gases that might indicate the planet is habitable.

352
0:15:27.477,000 --> 0:15:29,000
JC: I'm going to ask you one follow-up question, too, Sara,

353
0:15:30.31,000 --> 0:15:31,000
as the generalist.

354
0:15:31.54,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So I am really struck by the notion in your career

355
0:15:34.657,000 --> 0:15:35,000
of the opposition you faced,

356
0:15:36.08,000 --> 0:15:38,000
that when you began thinking about exoplanets,

357
0:15:38.248,000 --> 0:15:4,000
there was extreme skepticism in the scientific community

358
0:15:40.938,000 --> 0:15:41,000
that they existed,

359
0:15:42.113,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and you proved them wrong.

360
0:15:43.406,000 --> 0:15:44,000
What did it take to take that on?

361
0:15:45.143,000 --> 0:15:47,000
SS: Well, the thing is that as scientists,

362
0:15:47.237,000 --> 0:15:48,000
we're supposed to be skeptical,

363
0:15:49.219,000 --> 0:15:52,000
because our job to make sure that what the other person is saying

364
0:15:52.291,000 --> 0:15:53,000
actually makes sense or not.

365
0:15:53.654,000 --> 0:15:55,000
But being a scientist,

366
0:15:56.235,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I think you've seen it from this session,

367
0:15:58.679,000 --> 0:15:59,000
it's like being an explorer.

368
0:16:00.385,000 --> 0:16:01,000
You have this immense curiosity,

369
0:16:02.398,000 --> 0:16:03,000
this stubbornness,

370
0:16:03.721,000 --> 0:16:05,000
this sort of resolute will that you will go forward

371
0:16:06.127,000 --> 0:16:08,000
no matter what other people say.

372
0:16:08.182,000 --> 0:16:09,000
JC: I love that. Thank you, Sara.

373
0:16:09.882,000 --> 0:16:11,000
(Applause)

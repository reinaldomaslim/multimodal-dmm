1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Good morning. I think, as a grumpy Eastern European,

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was brought in to play the pessimist this morning. So bear with me.

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Well, I come from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus,

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
which, as some of you may know,

5
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is not exactly an oasis of liberal democracy.

6
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So that's why I've always been fascinated

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
with how technology could actually reshape

8
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and open up authoritarian societies like ours.

9
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So, I'm graduating college

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and, feeling very idealistic,

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I decided to join the NGO

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
which actually was using new media

13
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to promote democracy and media reform

14
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
in much of the former Soviet Union.

15
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
However, to my surprise,

16
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I discovered that dictatorships

17
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
do not crumble so easily.

18
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
In fact, some of them actually

19
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
survived the Internet challenge,

20
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and some got even more repressive.

21
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So this is when I ran out of my idealism and

22
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
decided to quit my NGO job

23
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and actually study how the Internet could impede democratization.

24
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now, I must tell you that this was never

25
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
a very popular argument,

26
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and it's probably not very popular yet

27
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
with some of you sitting in this audience.

28
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It was never popular with many political leaders,

29
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
especially those in the United States

30
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
who somehow thought that new media

31
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
would be able to do what missiles couldn't.

32
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
That is, promote democracy in difficult places

33
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
where everything else has already been tried and failed.

34
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I think by 2009,

35
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
this news has finally reached Britain,

36
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
so I should probably add Gordon Brown to this list as well.

37
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
However, there is an underlying argument about logistics,

38
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
which has driven so much of this debate. Right?

39
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So if you look at it close enough,

40
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
you'll actually see that much of this

41
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
is about economics.

42
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The cybertopians say, much like fax machines

43
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and Xerox machines did in the '80s,

44
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
blogs and social networks

45
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
have radically transformed the economics of protest,

46
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
so people would inevitably rebel.

47
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
To put it very simply,

48
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the assumption so far has been

49
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that if you give people enough connectivity,

50
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
if you give them enough devices,

51
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
democracy will inevitably follow.

52
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And to tell you the truth,

53
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I never really bought into this argument,

54
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in part because I never saw three American presidents

55
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
agree on anything else in the past.

56
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But, you know, even beyond that,

58
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
if you think about the logic underlying it,

59
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
is something I call iPod liberalism,

60
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
where we assume that every single Iranian or Chinese

61
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
who happens to have and love his iPod

62
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
will also love liberal democracy.

63
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And again, I think this is kind of false.

64
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But I think a much bigger problem with this

65
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
is that this logic --

66
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that we should be dropping iPods not bombs --

67
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I mean, it would make a fascinating title

68
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
for Thomas Friedman's new book.

69
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But this is rarely a good sign. Right?

71
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So, the bigger problem with this logic

72
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is that it confuses the intended

73
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
versus the actual uses of technology.

74
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
For those of you who think that

75
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
new media of the Internet

76
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
could somehow help us avert genocide,

77
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
should look no further than Rwanda,

78
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
where in the '90s it was actually two radio stations

79
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
which were responsible for fueling much of the ethnic hatred in the first place.

80
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But even beyond that, coming back to the Internet,

81
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
what you can actually see

82
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
is that certain governments

83
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
have mastered the use of cyberspace

84
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
for propaganda purposes. Right?

85
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And they are building what I call the Spinternet.

86
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The combination of spin, on the one hand,

87
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and the Internet on the other.

88
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So governments from Russia to China to Iran

89
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
are actually hiring, training and paying bloggers

90
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
in order to leave ideological comments

91
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and create a lot of ideological blog posts

92
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to comment on sensitive political issues. Right?

93
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So you may wonder, why on Earth are they doing it?

94
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Why are they engaging with cyberspace?

95
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Well my theory is that

96
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
it's happening because censorship actually

97
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is less effective than you think it is in many of those places.

98
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
The moment you put something critical in a blog,

99
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
even if you manage to ban it immediately,

100
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
it will still spread around thousands and thousands of other blogs.

101
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So the more you block it,

102
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the more it emboldens people to actually avoid the censorship

103
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and thus win in this cat-and-mouse game.

104
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So the only way to control this message

105
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is actually to try to spin it

106
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and accuse anyone who has written something critical

107
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
of being, for example, a CIA agent.

108
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And, again, this is happening quite often.

109
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Just to give you an example of how it works in China, for example.

110
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
There was a big case in February 2009

111
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
called "Elude the Cat."

112
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And for those of you who didn't know, I'll just give a little summary.

113
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So what happened is that a 24-year-old man,

114
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
a Chinese man, died in prison custody.

115
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And police said that it happened

116
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
because he was playing hide and seek,

117
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
which is "elude the cat" in Chinese slang,

118
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
with other inmates and hit his head

119
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
against the wall,

120
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
which was not an explanation which sat well with many Chinese bloggers.

121
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So they immediately began posting a lot of critical comments.

122
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
In fact, QQ.com, which is a popular Chinese website,

123
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
had 35,000 comments

124
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
on this issue within hours.

125
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But then authorities did something very smart.

126
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Instead of trying to purge these comments,

127
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
they instead went and reached out to the bloggers.

128
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And they basically said, "Look guys. We'd like you to become netizen investigators."

129
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So 500 people applied,

130
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and four were selected to actually go and tour the facility in question,

131
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and thus inspect it and then blog about it.

132
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Within days the entire incident was forgotten,

133
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which would have never happened if they simply tried to block the content.

134
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
People would keep talking about it for weeks.

135
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And this actually fits with another interesting theory

136
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
about what's happening in authoritarian states

137
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and in their cyberspace.

138
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This is what political scientists call authoritarian deliberation,

139
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and it happens when governments are actually reaching out to their critics

140
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and letting them engage with each other online.

141
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We tend to think

142
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
that somehow this is going to harm these dictatorships,

143
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
but in many cases it only strengthens them.

144
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And you may wonder why.

145
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I'll just give you a very short list of reasons

146
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
why authoritarian deliberation

147
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
may actually help the dictators.

148
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And first it's quite simple.

149
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Most of them operate in a complete information vacuum.

150
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
They don't really have the data they need

151
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
in order to identify emerging threats facing the regime.

152
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So encouraging people to actually go online

153
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and share information and data

154
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
on blogs and wikis is great

155
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
because otherwise, low level apparatchiks and bureaucrats

156
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
will continue concealing what's actually happening in the country, right?

157
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So from this perspective, having blogs and wikis

158
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
produce knowledge has been great.

159
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Secondly, involving public in any decision making

160
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is also great

161
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
because it helps you to share the blame

162
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
for the policies which eventually fail.

163
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Because they say, "Well look, we asked you,

164
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we consulted you, you voted on it.

165
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
You put it on the front page of your blog.

166
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Well, great. You are the one who is to blame."

167
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And finally, the purpose of

168
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
any authoritarian deliberation efforts

169
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is usually to increase the legitimacy of the regimes, both at home and abroad.

170
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So inviting people to all sorts of public forums,

171
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
having them participate in decision making,

172
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
it's actually great.

173
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Because what happens is that then

174
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
you can actually point to this initiative and say,

175
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
"Well, we are having a democracy. We are having a forum."

176
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Just to give you an example,

177
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
one of the Russian regions, for example,

178
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
now involves its citizens

179
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in planning its strategy up until year 2020.

180
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Right? So they can go online

181
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and contribute ideas on what that region would look like by the year 2020.

182
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I mean, anyone who has been to Russia would know

183
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that there was no planning in Russia for the next month.

184
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So having people involved in planning for 2020

185
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is not necessarily going to change anything,

186
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
because the dictators are still the ones who control the agenda.

187
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Just to give you an example from Iran,

188
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
we all heard about the Twitter revolution

189
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that happened there,

190
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
but if you look close enough, you'll actually see

191
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that many of the networks and blogs

192
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and Twitter and Facebook were actually operational.

193
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They may have become slower,

194
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but the activists could still access it

195
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and actually argue that having access to them

196
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is actually great for many authoritarian states.

197
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And it's great simply because

198
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
they can gather open source intelligence.

199
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
In the past it would take you weeks, if not months,

200
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to identify how Iranian activists connect to each other.

201
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Now you actually know how they connect to each other

202
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
by looking at their Facebook page.

203
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I mean KGB, and not just KGB,

204
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
used to torture in order to actually get this data.

205
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Now it's all available online.

206
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Laughter)

207
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But I think the biggest conceptual pitfall

208
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that cybertopians made

209
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
is when it comes to digital natives, people who have grown up online.

210
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We often hear about cyber activism,

211
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
how people are getting more active because of the Internet.

212
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Rarely hear about cyber hedonism, for example,

213
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
how people are becoming passive.

214
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Why? Because they somehow assume that the Internet

215
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
is going to be the catalyst of change

216
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that will push young people into the streets,

217
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
while in fact it may actually be the new opium for the masses

218
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
which will keep the same people in their rooms downloading pornography.

219
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
That's not an option being considered too strongly.

220
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So for every digital renegade that is revolting in the streets of Tehran,

221
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
there may as well be two digital captives

222
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
who are actually rebelling only in the World of Warcraft.

223
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And this is realistic. And there is nothing wrong about it

224
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
because the Internet has greatly empowered many of these young people

225
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and it plays a completely different social role for them.

226
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
If you look at some of the surveys

227
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
on how the young people actually benefit from the Internet,

228
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
you'll see that the number of teenagers in China, for example,

229
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
for whom the Internet actually broadens their sex life,

230
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
is three times more than in the United States.

231
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So it does play a social role,

232
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
however it may not necessarily lead to political engagement.

233
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So the way I tend to think of it

234
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
is like a hierarchy of cyber-needs in space,

235
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
a total rip-off from Abraham Maslow.

236
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But the point here is that

237
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
when we get the remote Russian village online,

238
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
what will get people to the Internet

239
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
is not going to be the reports from Human Rights Watch.

240
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
It's going to be pornography, "Sex and the City,"

241
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
or maybe watching funny videos of cats.

242
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So this is something you have to recognize.

243
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So what should we do about it?

244
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Well I say we have to stop thinking

245
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
about the number of iPods per capita

246
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and start thinking about ways in which

247
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
we can empower intellectuals,

248
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
dissidents, NGOs and then the members of civil society.

249
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Because even what has been happening up 'til now

250
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
with the Spinternet and authoritarian deliberation,

251
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
there is a great chance that those voices will not be heard.

252
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So I think we should shatter some of our utopian assumptions

253
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and actually start doing something about it.

254
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Thank you.

255
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Applause)

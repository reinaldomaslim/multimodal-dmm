1
0:00:12.86,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I've got a confession.

2
0:00:14.58,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I love looking through people's garbage.

3
0:00:17.812,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Now, it's not some creepy thing.

4
0:00:19.741,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm usually just looking for old electronics,

5
0:00:21.931,000 --> 0:00:23,000
stuff I can take to my workshop and hack.

6
0:00:24.381,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I do have a fetish for CD-ROM drives.

7
0:00:28.044,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Each one's got three different motors,

8
0:00:30.677,000 --> 0:00:31,000
so now you can build things that move.

9
0:00:32.638,000 --> 0:00:34,000
There's switches so you can turn things on and off.

10
0:00:35.377,000 --> 0:00:36,000
There's even a freaking laser,

11
0:00:37.259,000 --> 0:00:41,000
so you can make a cool robot into an awesome robot.

12
0:00:42.778,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Now, I've built a lot of stuff out of garbage,

13
0:00:45.968,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and some of these things have even been kind of useful.

14
0:00:48.773,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But here's the thing,

15
0:00:49.982,000 --> 0:00:51,000
for me, garbage is just a chance to play,

16
0:00:52.607,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to be creative and build things to amuse myself.

17
0:00:55.554,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This is what I love doing, so I just made it part of my day job.

18
0:00:59.214,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I lead a university-based biological research lab,

19
0:01:01.795,000 --> 0:01:04,000
where we value curiosity and exploration above all else.

20
0:01:05.756,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We aren't focused on any particular problem,

21
0:01:08.376,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and we're not trying to solve any particular disease.

22
0:01:10.962,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This is just a place where people can come

23
0:01:13.67,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and ask fascinating questions and find answers.

24
0:01:17.47,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And I realized a long time ago

25
0:01:19.359,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that if I challenge people to build the equipment they need

26
0:01:22.625,000 --> 0:01:24,000
out of the garbage I find,

27
0:01:24.762,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it's a great way to foster creativity.

28
0:01:27.549,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And what happened

29
0:01:28.724,000 --> 0:01:3,000
was that artists and scientists from around the world

30
0:01:31.629,000 --> 0:01:33,000
started coming to my lab.

31
0:01:33.669,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And it's not just because we value unconventional ideas,

32
0:01:36.902,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it's because we test and validate them

33
0:01:39.244,000 --> 0:01:4,000
with scientific rigor.

34
0:01:41.62,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So one day I was hacking something, I was taking it apart,

35
0:01:45.545,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and I had this sudden idea:

36
0:01:47.426,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Could I treat biology like hardware?

37
0:01:50.889,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Could I dismantle a biological system,

38
0:01:53.164,000 --> 0:01:54,000
mix and match the parts

39
0:01:54.611,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and then put it back together in some new and creative way?

40
0:01:57.946,000 --> 0:01:59,000
My lab started working on this,

41
0:02:00.054,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and I want to show you the result.

42
0:02:03.601,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Can any of you guys tell me what fruit this is?

43
0:02:07.278,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Audience: Apple!

44
0:02:08.453,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Andrew Pelling: That's right -- it's an apple.

45
0:02:10.634,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now, I actually want you to notice as well

46
0:02:12.657,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that this is a lot redder than most apples.

47
0:02:16.294,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And that's because we grew human cells into it.

48
0:02:19.044,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We took a totally innocent Macintosh apple,

49
0:02:23.246,000 --> 0:02:26,000
removed all the apple cells and DNA

50
0:02:26.289,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and then implanted human cells.

51
0:02:28.332,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And what we're left with after removing all the apple cells

52
0:02:31.405,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is this cellulose scaffold.

53
0:02:33.17,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This is the stuff that gives plants their shape and texture.

54
0:02:36.331,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And these little holes that you can see,

55
0:02:38.327,000 --> 0:02:4,000
this is where all the apple cells used to be.

56
0:02:41.254,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So then we come along,

57
0:02:42.462,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we implant some mammalian cells that you can see in blue.

58
0:02:45.548,000 --> 0:02:47,000
What happens is, these guys start multiplying

59
0:02:47.78,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and they fill up this entire scaffold.

60
0:02:50.414,000 --> 0:02:51,000
As weird as this is,

61
0:02:52.775,000 --> 0:02:56,000
it's actually really reminiscent of how our own tissues are organized.

62
0:02:56.955,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And we found in our pre-clinical work

63
0:02:59.232,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that you can implant these scaffolds into the body,

64
0:03:01.652,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and the body will send in cells and a blood supply

65
0:03:04.359,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and actually keep these things alive.

66
0:03:07.348,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This is the point when people started asking me,

67
0:03:10.469,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"Andrew, can you make body parts out of apples?"

68
0:03:15.794,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And I'm like, "You've come to the right place."

69
0:03:18.049,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:19.715,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I actually brought this up with my wife.

71
0:03:21.924,000 --> 0:03:22,000
She's a musical instrument maker,

72
0:03:23.682,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and she does a lot of wood carving for a living.

73
0:03:26.529,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So I asked her,

74
0:03:28.865,000 --> 0:03:31,000
"Could you, like, literally carve some ears

75
0:03:32.126,000 --> 0:03:33,000
out of an apple for us?"

76
0:03:33.682,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And she did.

77
0:03:35.157,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So I took her ears to the lab.

78
0:03:37.953,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We then started preparing them.

79
0:03:40.979,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Yeah, I know.

80
0:03:42.34,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:45.397,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It's a good lab, man.

82
0:03:47.139,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:48.624,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And then we grew cells on them.

84
0:03:51.008,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And this is the result.

85
0:03:53.916,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Listen, my lab is not in the ear-manufacturing business.

86
0:03:59.778,000 --> 0:04:02,000
People have actually been working on this for decades.

87
0:04:03.138,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Here's the issue:

88
0:04:04.81,000 --> 0:04:08,000
commercial scaffolds can be really expensive and problematic,

89
0:04:09.24,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because they're sourced from proprietary products,

90
0:04:11.865,000 --> 0:04:13,000
animals or cadavers.

91
0:04:19.259,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We used an apple and it cost pennies.

92
0:04:22.873,000 --> 0:04:24,000
What's also really cool here

93
0:04:24.934,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is it's not that hard to make these things.

94
0:04:27.103,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The equipment you need can be built from garbage,

95
0:04:30.059,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and the key processing step only requires soap and water.

96
0:04:34.866,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So what we did was put all the instructions online as open source.

97
0:04:39.393,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And then we founded a mission-driven company,

98
0:04:41.553,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and we're developing kits to make it easier

99
0:04:43.955,000 --> 0:04:45,000
for anyone with a sink and a soldering iron

100
0:04:46.55,000 --> 0:04:47,000
to make these things at home.

101
0:04:48.132,000 --> 0:04:52,000
What I'm really curious about is if one day,

102
0:04:52.229,000 --> 0:04:57,000
it will be possible to repair, rebuild and augment our own bodies

103
0:04:57.504,000 --> 0:04:58,000
with stuff we make in the kitchen.

104
0:05:01.321,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Speaking of kitchens,

105
0:05:03.442,000 --> 0:05:04,000
here's some asparagus.

106
0:05:05.402,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They're tasty, and they make your pee smell funny.

107
0:05:08.109,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:09.386,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Now, I was in my kitchen, and I was noticing

109
0:05:12.033,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that when you look down the stalks of these asparagus,

110
0:05:14.643,000 --> 0:05:16,000
what you can see are all these tiny little vessels.

111
0:05:17.658,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And when we image them in the lab,

112
0:05:19.331,000 --> 0:05:21,000
you can see how the cellulose forms these structures.

113
0:05:22.832,000 --> 0:05:24,000
This image reminds me of two things:

114
0:05:25.701,000 --> 0:05:26,000
our blood vessels

115
0:05:27.607,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and the structure and organization of our nerves and spinal cord.

116
0:05:31.854,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So here's the question:

117
0:05:33.86,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Can we grow axons and neurons down these channels?

118
0:05:38.064,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Because if we can,

119
0:05:39.714,000 --> 0:05:43,000
then maybe we can use asparagus to form new connections

120
0:05:44.005,000 --> 0:05:46,000
between the ends of damaged and severed nerves.

121
0:05:47.627,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Or maybe even a spinal cord.

122
0:05:50.126,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Don't get me wrong --

123
0:05:51.436,000 --> 0:05:53,000
this is exceptionally challenging

124
0:05:53.464,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and really hard work to do,

125
0:05:55.083,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and we are not the only ones working on this.

126
0:05:58.116,000 --> 0:06:,000
But we are the only ones using asparagus.

127
0:06:01.08,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:04.06,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Right now, we've got really promising pilot data.

129
0:06:07.202,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And we're working with tissue engineers

130
0:06:09.109,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and neurosurgeons

131
0:06:10.299,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to find out what's actually possible.

132
0:06:12.793,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So listen, all of the work I've shown you,

133
0:06:15.371,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the stuff that I've built that's all around me on this stage

134
0:06:18.588,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and the other projects my lab is involved in

135
0:06:21.282,000 --> 0:06:25,000
are all a direct result of me playing with your garbage.

136
0:06:25.393,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Play -- play is a key part of my scientific practice.

137
0:06:31.454,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's how I train my mind to be unconventional and to be creative

138
0:06:35.462,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and to decide to make human apple ears.

139
0:06:38.491,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So, the next time any of you are looking at some old,

140
0:06:43.166,000 --> 0:06:47,000
broken-down, malfunctioning, piece-of-crap technology,

141
0:06:47.769,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I want you to think of me.

142
0:06:50.199,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Because I want it.

143
0:06:51.381,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Laughter)

144
0:06:52.556,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Seriously, please find any way to get in touch with me,

145
0:06:56.587,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and let's see what we can build.

146
0:06:58.552,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Thank you.

147
0:06:59.727,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.667,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It may seem like we're all standing on solid earth right now,

2
0:00:15.977,000 --> 0:00:16,000
but we're not.

3
0:00:17.753,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The rocks and the dirt underneath us are crisscrossed by tiny little fractures

4
0:00:22.174,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and empty spaces.

5
0:00:23.597,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And these empty spaces are filled with astronomical quantities of microbes,

6
0:00:28.55,000 --> 0:00:29,000
such as these ones.

7
0:00:30.866,000 --> 0:00:33,000
The deepest that we found microbes so far into the earth

8
0:00:34.253,000 --> 0:00:35,000
is five kilometers down.

9
0:00:36.165,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So like, if you pointed yourself at the ground

10
0:00:38.345,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and took off running into the ground,

11
0:00:40.688,000 --> 0:00:43,000
you could run an entire 5K race and microbes would line your whole path.

12
0:00:45.044,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So you may not have ever thought about these microbes

13
0:00:47.592,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that are deep inside earth's crust,

14
0:00:49.306,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but you probably thought about the microbes living in our guts.

15
0:00:52.292,000 --> 0:00:53,000
If you add up the gut microbiomes

16
0:00:54.133,000 --> 0:00:56,000
of all the people and all the animals on the planet,

17
0:00:56.998,000 --> 0:00:59,000
collectively, this weighs about 100,000 tons.

18
0:01:00.931,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This is a huge biome that we carry in our bellies every single day.

19
0:01:05.907,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We should all be proud.

20
0:01:07.348,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:08.478,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But it pales in comparison to the number of microbes

22
0:01:12.374,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that are covering the entire surface of the earth,

23
0:01:14.883,000 --> 0:01:16,000
like in our soils, our rivers and our oceans.

24
0:01:17.738,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Collectively, these weigh about two billion tons.

25
0:01:22.174,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But it turns out that the majority of microbes on earth

26
0:01:24.794,000 --> 0:01:27,000
aren't even in oceans or our guts or sewage treatment plants.

27
0:01:28.595,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Most of them are actually inside the earth's crust.

28
0:01:31.396,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So collectively, these weigh 40 billion tons.

29
0:01:35.754,000 --> 0:01:38,000
This is one of the biggest biomes on the planet,

30
0:01:39.069,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and we didn't even know it existed until a few decades ago.

31
0:01:42.847,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So the possibilities for what life is like down there,

32
0:01:45.566,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or what it might do for humans,

33
0:01:48.135,000 --> 0:01:49,000
are limitless.

34
0:01:50.367,000 --> 0:01:51,000
This is a map showing a red dot

35
0:01:52.263,000 --> 0:01:55,000
for every place where we've gotten pretty good deep subsurface samples

36
0:01:55.645,000 --> 0:01:56,000
with modern microbiological methods,

37
0:01:57.487,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and you may be impressed

38
0:01:58.894,000 --> 0:02:,000
that we're getting a pretty good global coverage,

39
0:02:01.228,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but actually, if you remember that these are the only places

40
0:02:04.109,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that we have samples from, it looks a little worse.

41
0:02:06.514,000 --> 0:02:07,000
If we were all in an alien spaceship,

42
0:02:08.347,000 --> 0:02:11,000
trying to reconstruct a map of the globe from only these samples,

43
0:02:12.03,000 --> 0:02:14,000
we'd never be able to do it.

44
0:02:15.218,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So people sometimes say to me,

45
0:02:17.543,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"Yeah, there's a lot of microbes in the subsurface, but ...

46
0:02:21.083,000 --> 0:02:22,000
aren't they just kind of dormant?"

47
0:02:23.71,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is a good point.

48
0:02:25.251,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Relative to a ficus plant or the measles or my kid's guinea pigs,

49
0:02:30.125,000 --> 0:02:33,000
these microbes probably aren't doing much of anything at all.

50
0:02:33.18,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We know that they have to be slow, because there's so many of them.

51
0:02:37.03,000 --> 0:02:39,000
If they all started dividing at the rate of E. coli,

52
0:02:39.744,000 --> 0:02:42,000
then they would double the entire weight of the earth, rocks included,

53
0:02:43.085,000 --> 0:02:44,000
over a single night.

54
0:02:45.046,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In fact, many of them probably haven't even undergone a single cell division

55
0:02:49.603,000 --> 0:02:51,000
since the time of ancient Egypt.

56
0:02:52.18,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Which is just crazy.

57
0:02:53.664,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Like, how do you wrap your head around things that are so long-lived?

58
0:02:59.266,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But I thought of an analogy that I really love,

59
0:03:02.434,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but it's weird and it's complicated.

60
0:03:04.279,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So I hope that you can all go there with me.

61
0:03:06.474,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Alright, let's try it.

62
0:03:08.299,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's like trying to figure out the life cycle of a tree ...

63
0:03:11.172,000 --> 0:03:12,000
if you only lived for a day.

64
0:03:13.141,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So like if human life span was only a day, and we lived in winter,

65
0:03:17.546,000 --> 0:03:18,000
then you would go your entire life

66
0:03:19.195,000 --> 0:03:21,000
without ever seeing a tree with a leaf on it.

67
0:03:21.792,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And there would be so many human generations

68
0:03:23.871,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that would pass by within a single winter

69
0:03:25.919,000 --> 0:03:27,000
that you may not even have access to a history book

70
0:03:28.339,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that says anything other than the fact that trees are always lifeless sticks

71
0:03:32.165,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that don't do anything.

72
0:03:33.72,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Of course, this is ridiculous.

73
0:03:35.403,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We know that trees are just waiting for summer

74
0:03:37.577,000 --> 0:03:38,000
so they can reactivate.

75
0:03:38.95,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But if the human life span

76
0:03:41.149,000 --> 0:03:44,000
were significantly shorter than that of trees,

77
0:03:44.252,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we might be completely oblivious to this totally mundane fact.

78
0:03:48.879,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So when we say that these deep subsurface microbes are just dormant,

79
0:03:53.831,000 --> 0:03:57,000
are we like people who die after a day, trying to figure out how trees work?

80
0:03:58.601,000 --> 0:03:59,000
What if these deep subsurface organisms

81
0:04:00.515,000 --> 0:04:02,000
are just waiting for their version of summer,

82
0:04:02.846,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but our lives are too short for us to see it?

83
0:04:06.784,000 --> 0:04:09,000
If you take E. coli and seal it up in a test tube,

84
0:04:10.348,000 --> 0:04:11,000
with no food or nutrients,

85
0:04:11.714,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and leave it there for months to years,

86
0:04:14.206,000 --> 0:04:17,000
most of the cells die off, of course, because they're starving.

87
0:04:17.246,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But a few of the cells survive.

88
0:04:19.576,000 --> 0:04:21,000
If you take these old surviving cells

89
0:04:21.79,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and compete them, also under starvation conditions,

90
0:04:24.681,000 --> 0:04:27,000
against a new, fast-growing culture of E. coli,

91
0:04:27.879,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the grizzled old tough guys beat out the squeaky clean upstarts

92
0:04:31.642,000 --> 0:04:32,000
every single time.

93
0:04:33.339,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So this is evidence there's actually an evolutionary payoff

94
0:04:37.966,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to being extraordinarily slow.

95
0:04:40.736,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So it's possible

96
0:04:42.649,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that maybe we should not equate being slow with being unimportant.

97
0:04:50.402,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Maybe these out-of-sight, out-of-mind microbes

98
0:04:53.108,000 --> 0:04:55,000
could actually be helpful to humanity.

99
0:04:56.125,000 --> 0:04:57,000
OK, so as far as we know,

100
0:04:57.431,000 --> 0:04:59,000
there are two ways to do subsurface living.

101
0:04:59.871,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The first is to wait for food to trickle down from the surface world,

102
0:05:03.537,000 --> 0:05:07,000
like trying to eat the leftovers of a picnic that happened 1,000 years ago.

103
0:05:08.069,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Which is a crazy way to live,

104
0:05:10.117,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but shockingly seems to work out for a lot of microbes in earth.

105
0:05:13.698,000 --> 0:05:16,000
The other possibility is for a microbe to just say,

106
0:05:17.143,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"Nah, I don't need the surface world.

107
0:05:19.642,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I'm good down here."

108
0:05:21.119,000 --> 0:05:22,000
For microbes that go this route,

109
0:05:22.815,000 --> 0:05:25,000
they have to get everything that they need in order to survive

110
0:05:26.482,000 --> 0:05:27,000
from inside the earth.

111
0:05:30.205,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Some things are actually easier for them to get.

112
0:05:32.685,000 --> 0:05:33,000
They're more abundant inside the earth,

113
0:05:34.577,000 --> 0:05:37,000
like water or nutrients, like nitrogen and iron and phosphorus,

114
0:05:38.419,000 --> 0:05:39,000
or places to live.

115
0:05:39.616,000 --> 0:05:42,000
These are things that we literally kill each other to get ahold of

116
0:05:42.8,000 --> 0:05:43,000
up at the surface world.

117
0:05:44.038,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But in the subsurface, the problem is finding enough energy.

118
0:05:48.101,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Up at the surface,

119
0:05:49.315,000 --> 0:05:53,000
plants can chemically knit together carbon dioxide molecules into yummy sugars

120
0:05:53.427,000 --> 0:05:55,000
as fast as the sun's photons hit their leaves.

121
0:05:56.427,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But in the subsurface, of course, there's no sunlight,

122
0:05:58.979,000 --> 0:06:,000
so this ecosystem has to solve the problem

123
0:06:01.717,000 --> 0:06:04,000
of who is going to make the food for everybody else.

124
0:06:05.416,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The subsurface needs something that's like a plant

125
0:06:09.315,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but it breathes rocks.

126
0:06:11.641,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Luckily, such a thing exists,

127
0:06:14.8,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and it's called a chemolithoautotroph.

128
0:06:17.148,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:18.18,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Which is a microbe that uses chemicals -- "chemo,"

130
0:06:22.228,000 --> 0:06:24,000
from rocks -- "litho,"

131
0:06:24.482,000 --> 0:06:26,000
to make food -- "autotroph."

132
0:06:27.268,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And they can do this with a ton of different elements.

133
0:06:29.95,000 --> 0:06:32,000
They can do this with sulphur, iron, manganese, nitrogen, carbon,

134
0:06:33.807,000 --> 0:06:36,000
some of them can use pure electrons, straight up.

135
0:06:37.53,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Like, if you cut the end off of an electrical cord,

136
0:06:39.966,000 --> 0:06:4,000
they could breathe it like a snorkel.

137
0:06:41.899,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:43.235,000 --> 0:06:44,000
These chemolithoautotrophs

139
0:06:44.76,000 --> 0:06:46,000
take the energy that they get from these processes

140
0:06:47.419,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and use it to make food, like plants do.

141
0:06:49.855,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But we know that plants do more than just make food.

142
0:06:53.103,000 --> 0:06:55,000
They also make a waste product, oxygen,

143
0:06:55.443,000 --> 0:06:57,000
which we are 100 percent dependent upon.

144
0:06:57.992,000 --> 0:07:,000
But the waste product that these chemolithoautotrophs make

145
0:07:01.301,000 --> 0:07:02,000
is often in the form of minerals,

146
0:07:03.292,000 --> 0:07:07,000
like rust or pyrite, like fool's gold,

147
0:07:07.895,000 --> 0:07:09,000
or carminites, like limestone.

148
0:07:10.68,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So what we have are microbes that are really, really slow, like rocks,

149
0:07:18.243,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that get their energy from rocks,

150
0:07:21.673,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that make as their waste product other rocks.

151
0:07:25.268,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So am I talking about biology, or am I talking about geology?

152
0:07:29.466,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This stuff really blurs the lines.

153
0:07:31.633,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:32.661,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So if I'm going to do this thing,

155
0:07:34.831,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and I'm going to be a biologist who studies microbes

156
0:07:38.173,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that kind of act like rocks,

157
0:07:40.402,000 --> 0:07:43,000
then I should probably start studying geology.

158
0:07:43.8,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And what's the coolest part of geology?

159
0:07:47.292,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Volcanoes.

160
0:07:48.484,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:49.759,000 --> 0:07:52,000
This is looking inside the crater of Poás Volcano in Costa Rica.

162
0:07:53.854,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Many volcanoes on earth arise because an oceanic tectonic plate

163
0:07:57.656,000 --> 0:07:58,000
crashes into a continental plate.

164
0:07:59.49,000 --> 0:08:,000
As this oceanic plate subducts

165
0:08:01.427,000 --> 0:08:03,000
or gets moved underneath this continental plate,

166
0:08:03.816,000 --> 0:08:05,000
things like water and carbon dioxide and other materials

167
0:08:06.681,000 --> 0:08:07,000
get squeezed out of it,

168
0:08:07.94,000 --> 0:08:08,000
like ringing a wet washcloth.

169
0:08:10.382,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So in this way, subduction zones are like portals into the deep earth,

170
0:08:14.088,000 --> 0:08:17,000
where materials are exchanged between the surface and the subsurface world.

171
0:08:17.873,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So I was recently invited by some of my colleagues in Costa Rica

172
0:08:20.925,000 --> 0:08:23,000
to come and work with them on some of the volcanoes.

173
0:08:24.052,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And of course I said yes, because, I mean, Costa Rica is beautiful,

174
0:08:28.674,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but also because it sits on top of one of these subduction zones.

175
0:08:32.478,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We wanted to ask the very specific question:

176
0:08:35.296,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Why is it that the carbon dioxide

177
0:08:37.708,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that comes out of this deeply buried oceanic tectonic plate

178
0:08:40.708,000 --> 0:08:42,000
is only coming out of the volcanoes?

179
0:08:42.839,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Why don't we see it distributed throughout the entire subduction zone?

180
0:08:46.157,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Do the microbes have something to do with that?

181
0:08:48.664,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So this is a picture of me inside Poás Volcano,

182
0:08:52.311,000 --> 0:08:54,000
along with my colleague Donato Giovannelli.

183
0:08:54.519,000 --> 0:08:57,000
That lake that we're standing next to is made of pure battery acid.

184
0:08:58.145,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I know this because we were measuring the pH when this picture was taken.

185
0:09:02.362,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And at some point while we were working inside the crater,

186
0:09:05.117,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I turned to my Costa Rican colleague Carlos Ramírez and I said,

187
0:09:09.72,000 --> 0:09:12,000
"Alright, if this thing starts erupting right now,

188
0:09:13.111,000 --> 0:09:14,000
what's our exit strategy?"

189
0:09:15.269,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And he said, "Oh, yeah, great question, it's totally easy.

190
0:09:18.436,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Just turn around and enjoy the view."

191
0:09:21.538,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Laughter)

192
0:09:22.855,000 --> 0:09:23,000
"Because it will be your last."

193
0:09:24.426,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:25.585,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And it may sound like he was being overly dramatic,

195
0:09:29.054,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but 54 days after I was standing next to that lake,

196
0:09:33.831,000 --> 0:09:34,000
this happened.

197
0:09:35.276,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Audience: Oh!

198
0:09:37.204,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Freaking terrifying, right?

199
0:09:38.878,000 --> 0:09:39,000
(Laughs)

200
0:09:40.934,000 --> 0:09:44,000
This was the biggest eruption this volcano had had in 60-some-odd years,

201
0:09:45.311,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and not long after this video ends,

202
0:09:47.819,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the camera that was taking the video is obliterated

203
0:09:50.486,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and the entire lake that we had been sampling

204
0:09:52.93,000 --> 0:09:53,000
vaporizes completely.

205
0:09:54.815,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But I also want to be clear

206
0:09:56.641,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that we were pretty sure this was not going to happen

207
0:09:59.165,000 --> 0:10:01,000
on the day that we were actually in the volcano,

208
0:10:01.442,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because Costa Rica monitors its volcanoes very carefully

209
0:10:04.099,000 --> 0:10:05,000
through the OVSICORI Institute,

210
0:10:05.686,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and we had scientists from that institute with us on that day.

211
0:10:08.916,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But the fact that it erupted illustrates perfectly

212
0:10:12.03,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that if you want to look for where carbon dioxide gas

213
0:10:14.562,000 --> 0:10:15,000
is coming out of this oceanic plate,

214
0:10:16.45,000 --> 0:10:19,000
then you should look no further than the volcanoes themselves.

215
0:10:19.577,000 --> 0:10:21,000
But if you go to Costa Rica,

216
0:10:21.87,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you may notice that in addition to these volcanoes

217
0:10:24.354,000 --> 0:10:27,000
there are tons of cozy little hot springs all over the place.

218
0:10:28.069,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Some of the water in these hot springs is actually bubbling up

219
0:10:31.363,000 --> 0:10:33,000
from this deeply buried oceanic plate.

220
0:10:33.688,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And our hypothesis was that there should be carbon dioxide

221
0:10:37.208,000 --> 0:10:38,000
bubbling up with it,

222
0:10:38.411,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but something deep underground was filtering it out.

223
0:10:41.617,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So we spent two weeks driving all around Costa Rica,

224
0:10:45.823,000 --> 0:10:47,000
sampling every hot spring we could find --

225
0:10:48.744,000 --> 0:10:49,000
it was awful, let me tell you.

226
0:10:50.442,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And then we spent the next two years measuring and analyzing data.

227
0:10:56.102,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And if you're not a scientist, I'll just let you know that the big discoveries

228
0:10:59.935,000 --> 0:11:01,000
don't really happen when you're at a beautiful hot spring

229
0:11:02.792,000 --> 0:11:03,000
or on a public stage;

230
0:11:03.967,000 --> 0:11:05,000
they happen when you're hunched over a messy computer

231
0:11:06.514,000 --> 0:11:08,000
or you're troubleshooting a difficult instrument,

232
0:11:08.855,000 --> 0:11:09,000
or you're Skyping your colleagues

233
0:11:10.617,000 --> 0:11:12,000
because you are completely confused about your data.

234
0:11:13.236,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Scientific discoveries, kind of like deep subsurface microbes,

235
0:11:16.591,000 --> 0:11:17,000
can be very, very slow.

236
0:11:19.267,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But in our case, this really paid off this one time.

237
0:11:22.64,000 --> 0:11:26,000
We discovered that literally tons of carbon dioxide

238
0:11:26.942,000 --> 0:11:29,000
were coming out of this deeply buried oceanic plate.

239
0:11:30.149,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And the thing that was keeping them underground

240
0:11:32.522,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and keeping it from being released out into the atmosphere

241
0:11:35.541,000 --> 0:11:36,000
was that deep underground,

242
0:11:37.125,000 --> 0:11:4,000
underneath all the adorable sloths and toucans of Costa Rica,

243
0:11:41.133,000 --> 0:11:42,000
were chemolithoautotrophs.

244
0:11:43.338,000 --> 0:11:46,000
These microbes and the chemical processes that were happening around them

245
0:11:46.863,000 --> 0:11:48,000
were converting this carbon dioxide into carbonate mineral

246
0:11:49.639,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and locking it up underground.

247
0:11:51.591,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Which makes you wonder:

248
0:11:53.909,000 --> 0:11:56,000
If these subsurface processes are so good at sucking up

249
0:11:57.434,000 --> 0:11:59,000
all the carbon dioxide coming from below them,

250
0:12:00.039,000 --> 0:12:02,000
could they also help us with a little carbon problem

251
0:12:02.523,000 --> 0:12:04,000
we've got going on up at the surface?

252
0:12:05.006,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Humans are releasing enough carbon dioxide into our atmosphere

253
0:12:09.355,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that we are decreasing the ability of our planet

254
0:12:12.353,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to support life as we know it.

255
0:12:14.704,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And scientists and engineers and entrepreneurs

256
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
are working on methods to pull carbon dioxide

257
0:12:19.688,000 --> 0:12:2,000
out of these point sources,

258
0:12:21.005,000 --> 0:12:23,000
so that they're not released into the atmosphere.

259
0:12:23.347,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And they need to put it somewhere.

260
0:12:25.022,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So for this reason,

261
0:12:26.223,000 --> 0:12:29,000
we need to keep studying places where this carbon might be stored,

262
0:12:29.585,000 --> 0:12:31,000
possibly in the subsurface,

263
0:12:31.903,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to know what's going to happen to it when it goes there.

264
0:12:34.57,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Will these deep subsurface microbes be a problem because they're too slow

265
0:12:38.061,000 --> 0:12:39,000
to actually keep anything down there?

266
0:12:39.966,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Or will they be helpful

267
0:12:41.398,000 --> 0:12:44,000
because they'll help convert this stuff to solid carbonate minerals?

268
0:12:45.712,000 --> 0:12:47,000
If we can make such a big breakthrough

269
0:12:48.156,000 --> 0:12:5,000
just from one study that we did in Costa Rica,

270
0:12:50.566,000 --> 0:12:52,000
then imagine what else is waiting to be discovered down there.

271
0:12:53.891,000 --> 0:12:58,000
This new field of geo-bio-chemistry, or deep subsurface biology,

272
0:12:59.58,000 --> 0:13:,000
or whatever you want to call it,

273
0:13:01.145,000 --> 0:13:02,000
is going to have huge implications,

274
0:13:03.006,000 --> 0:13:05,000
not just for mitigating climate change,

275
0:13:05.403,000 --> 0:13:08,000
but possibly for understanding how life and earth have coevolved,

276
0:13:09.613,000 --> 0:13:13,000
or finding new products that are useful for industrial or medical applications.

277
0:13:14.335,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Maybe even predicting earthquakes

278
0:13:16.621,000 --> 0:13:18,000
or finding life outside our planet.

279
0:13:18.843,000 --> 0:13:21,000
It could even help us understand the origin of life itself.

280
0:13:22.827,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Fortunately, I don't have to do this by myself.

281
0:13:25.962,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I have amazing colleagues all over the world

282
0:13:29.311,000 --> 0:13:32,000
who are cracking into the mysteries of this deep subsurface world.

283
0:13:33.831,000 --> 0:13:37,000
And it may seem like life buried deep within the earth's crust

284
0:13:38.665,000 --> 0:13:41,000
is so far away from our daily experiences that it's kind of irrelevant.

285
0:13:43.363,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But the truth is that this weird, slow life

286
0:13:47.075,000 --> 0:13:5,000
may actually have the answers to some of the greatest mysteries

287
0:13:50.624,000 --> 0:13:51,000
of life on earth.

288
0:13:52.225,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Thank you.

289
0:13:53.4,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.424,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It was an afternoon in the fall of 2005.

2
0:00:17.325,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I was working at the ACLU as the organization's science advisor.

3
0:00:21.388,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I really, really loved my job,

4
0:00:24.019,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but I was having one of those days

5
0:00:25.679,000 --> 0:00:27,000
where I was feeling just a little bit discouraged.

6
0:00:29.265,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So I wandered down the hallway to my colleague Chris Hansen's office.

7
0:00:34.367,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Chris had been at the ACLU for more than 30 years,

8
0:00:38.045,000 --> 0:00:41,000
so he had deep institutional knowledge and insights.

9
0:00:41.64,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I explained to Chris that I was feeling a little bit stuck.

10
0:00:45.512,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I had been investigating a number of issues

11
0:00:47.718,000 --> 0:00:52,000
at the intersection of science and civil liberties -- super interesting.

12
0:00:53.043,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But I wanted the ACLU to engage these issues in a much bigger way,

13
0:00:56.977,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in a way that could really make a difference.

14
0:01:01.603,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So Chris cut right to the chase, and he says,

15
0:01:03.727,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"Well, of all the issues you've been looking at, what are the top five?"

16
0:01:07.524,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"Well, there's genetic discrimination,

17
0:01:10.204,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and reproductive technologies,

18
0:01:12.653,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and biobanking, and ...

19
0:01:14.818,000 --> 0:01:15,000
oh, there's this really cool issue,

20
0:01:16.684,000 --> 0:01:18,000
functional MRI and using it for lie detection, and ...

21
0:01:19.357,000 --> 0:01:21,000
oh, and of course, there's gene patents."

22
0:01:21.502,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"Gene patents?"

23
0:01:23.967,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"Yes, you know, patents on human genes."

24
0:01:26.073,000 --> 0:01:27,000
"No!

25
0:01:27.603,000 --> 0:01:29,000
You're telling me that the US government

26
0:01:30.088,000 --> 0:01:32,000
has been issuing patents on part of the human body?

27
0:01:33.543,000 --> 0:01:34,000
That can't be right."

28
0:01:35.861,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I went back to my office and sent Chris three articles.

29
0:01:39.954,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And 20 minutes later, he came bursting in my office.

30
0:01:43.305,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"Oh my god! You're right! Who can we sue?"

31
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:49.713,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now Chris is a really brilliant lawyer,

33
0:01:52.111,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but he knew almost nothing about patent law

34
0:01:55.044,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and certainly nothing about genetics.

35
0:01:57.504,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I knew something about genetics, but I wasn't even a lawyer,

36
0:02:00.406,000 --> 0:02:01,000
let alone a patent lawyer.

37
0:02:02.091,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So clearly we had a lot to learn before we could file a lawsuit.

38
0:02:06.036,000 --> 0:02:08,000
First, we needed to understand exactly what was patented

39
0:02:08.918,000 --> 0:02:09,000
when someone patented a gene.

40
0:02:11.679,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Gene patents typically contain dozens of claims,

41
0:02:15.525,000 --> 0:02:19,000
but the most controversial of these are to so-called "isolated DNA" --

42
0:02:20.699,000 --> 0:02:24,000
namely, a piece of DNA that has been removed from a cell.

43
0:02:26.073,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Gene patent proponents say,

44
0:02:27.396,000 --> 0:02:3,000
"See? We didn't patent the gene in your body,

45
0:02:30.594,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we patented an isolated gene."

46
0:02:33.148,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And that's true,

47
0:02:34.373,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but the problem is that any use of the gene requires that it be isolated.

48
0:02:42.51,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And the patents weren't just to a particular gene that they isolated,

49
0:02:46.939,000 --> 0:02:48,000
but on every possible version of that gene.

50
0:02:50.183,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So what does that mean?

51
0:02:51.981,000 --> 0:02:54,000
That means that you can't give your gene to your doctor

52
0:02:55.067,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and ask him or her to look at it,

53
0:02:57.387,000 --> 0:02:59,000
say, to see if it has any mutations,

54
0:02:59.511,000 --> 0:03:01,000
without permission of the patent holder.

55
0:03:02.363,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It also means that the patent holder has the right to stop anyone

56
0:03:06.58,000 --> 0:03:09,000
from using that gene in research or clinical testing.

57
0:03:10.871,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Allowing patent holders,

58
0:03:12.593,000 --> 0:03:13,000
often private companies,

59
0:03:13.901,000 --> 0:03:17,000
to lock up stretches of the human genome was harming patients.

60
0:03:18.958,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Consider Abigail,

61
0:03:20.134,000 --> 0:03:22,000
a 10-year-old with long QT syndrome,

62
0:03:22.551,000 --> 0:03:25,000
a serious heart condition that, if left untreated,

63
0:03:25.999,000 --> 0:03:26,000
can result in sudden death.

64
0:03:28.911,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The company that obtained a patent on two genes associated with this condition

65
0:03:32.857,000 --> 0:03:34,000
developed a test to diagnose the syndrome.

66
0:03:35.363,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But then they went bankrupt and they never offered it.

67
0:03:39.06,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So another lab tried to offer the test,

68
0:03:41.012,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but the company that held the patents threatened to sue the lab

69
0:03:44.024,000 --> 0:03:45,000
for patent infringement.

70
0:03:45.23,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So as a result,

71
0:03:46.413,000 --> 0:03:48,000
for 2 years, no test was available.

72
0:03:50.291,000 --> 0:03:51,000
During that time,

73
0:03:51.465,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Abigail died of undiagnosed long QT.

74
0:03:55.776,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Gene patents clearly were a problem and were harming patients.

75
0:03:59.467,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But was there a way we could challenge them?

76
0:04:02.266,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Turns out that the Supreme Court

77
0:04:04.022,000 --> 0:04:07,000
has made clear through a long line of cases,

78
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that certain things are not patent eligible.

79
0:04:10.925,000 --> 0:04:12,000
You can't patent products of nature --

80
0:04:14.148,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the air, the water, minerals, elements of the periodic table.

81
0:04:19.17,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And you can't patent laws of nature --

82
0:04:22.193,000 --> 0:04:24,000
the law of gravity, E = mc2.

83
0:04:24.909,000 --> 0:04:28,000
These things are just too fundamental and must remain free to all

84
0:04:29.739,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and reserved exclusively to none.

85
0:04:32.348,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It seemed to us that DNA,

86
0:04:34.519,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the most fundamental structure of life,

87
0:04:37.059,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that codes for the production of all of our proteins,

88
0:04:39.739,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is both a product of nature and a law of nature,

89
0:04:42.989,000 --> 0:04:44,000
regardless of whether it's in our bodies

90
0:04:45.715,000 --> 0:04:47,000
or sitting in the bottom of a test tube.

91
0:04:48.523,000 --> 0:04:49,000
As we delved into this issue,

92
0:04:50.002,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we traveled all over the country to speak with many different experts --

93
0:04:54.588,000 --> 0:04:57,000
scientists, medical professionals, lawyers, patent lawyers.

94
0:04:58.753,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Most of them agreed that we were right as a matter of policy,

95
0:05:02.687,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and, at least in theory, as a matter of law.

96
0:05:06.313,000 --> 0:05:07,000
All of them thought

97
0:05:07.492,000 --> 0:05:09,000
our chances of winning a gene-patent challenge

98
0:05:10.086,000 --> 0:05:11,000
were about zero.

99
0:05:13.628,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Why is that?

100
0:05:15.015,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Well, the patent office had been issuing these patents

101
0:05:18.126,000 --> 0:05:19,000
for more than 20 years.

102
0:05:20.686,000 --> 0:05:22,000
There were literally thousands of patents on human genes.

103
0:05:24.843,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The patent bar was deeply entrenched in the status quo,

104
0:05:28.581,000 --> 0:05:31,000
the biotech industry had grown up around this practice,

105
0:05:32.228,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and legislation to ban gene patents had been introduced

106
0:05:35.371,000 --> 0:05:36,000
year after year in Congress,

107
0:05:36.793,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and had gone absolutely nowhere.

108
0:05:39.401,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So the bottom line:

109
0:05:41.027,000 --> 0:05:44,000
courts just weren't going to be willing to overturn these patents.

110
0:05:44.916,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now, neither Chris nor I were the type to shy away from a challenge,

111
0:05:49.535,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and hearing, "Being right just isn't enough,"

112
0:05:52.703,000 --> 0:05:54,000
seemed all the more reason to take on this fight.

113
0:05:56.311,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So we set out to build our case.

114
0:05:59.494,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Now, patent cases tend to be: Company A sues Company B

115
0:06:03.008,000 --> 0:06:06,000
over some really narrow, obscure technical issue.

116
0:06:06.822,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We weren't really interested in that kind of case,

117
0:06:09.211,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and we thought this case was much bigger than that.

118
0:06:11.624,000 --> 0:06:13,000
This was about scientific freedom, medical progress,

119
0:06:14.136,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the rights of patients.

120
0:06:15.619,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So we decided we were going to develop a case

121
0:06:18.746,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that was not like your typical patent case --

122
0:06:21.645,000 --> 0:06:22,000
more like a civil rights case.

123
0:06:24.756,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We set out to identify a gene-patent holder

124
0:06:27.622,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that was vigorously enforcing its patents

125
0:06:30.431,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and then to organize a broad coalition of plaintiffs and experts

126
0:06:33.749,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that could tell the court

127
0:06:35.663,000 --> 0:06:39,000
about all the ways that these patents were harming patients and innovation.

128
0:06:41.404,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We found the prime candidate to sue in Myriad Genetics,

129
0:06:44.55,000 --> 0:06:46,000
a company that's based in Salt Lake City, Utah.

130
0:06:48.718,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Myriad held patents on two genes,

131
0:06:50.992,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the BRCA1 and the BRCA2 genes.

132
0:06:55.15,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Women with certain mutations along these genes

133
0:06:57.908,000 --> 0:06:59,000
are considered to be at a significantly increased risk

134
0:07:00.558,000 --> 0:07:01,000
of developing breast and ovarian cancer.

135
0:07:03.834,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Myriad had used its patents to maintain

136
0:07:05.738,000 --> 0:07:09,000
a complete monopoly on BRCA testing in the United States.

137
0:07:10.544,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It had forced multiple labs that were offering BRCA testing to stop.

138
0:07:14.756,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It charged a lot of money for its test --

139
0:07:16.939,000 --> 0:07:17,000
over 3,000 dollars.

140
0:07:19.089,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It had stopped sharing its clinical data

141
0:07:21.448,000 --> 0:07:23,000
with the international scientific community.

142
0:07:24.522,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And perhaps worst of all,

143
0:07:26.449,000 --> 0:07:28,000
for a period of several years,

144
0:07:28.909,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Myriad refused to update its test to include additional mutations

145
0:07:32.646,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that had been identified by a team of researchers in France.

146
0:07:36.974,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It has been estimated that during that period,

147
0:07:39.506,000 --> 0:07:4,000
for several years,

148
0:07:40.903,000 --> 0:07:43,000
as many as 12 percent of women undergoing testing

149
0:07:44.679,000 --> 0:07:46,000
received the wrong answer --

150
0:07:48.377,000 --> 0:07:51,000
a negative test result that should have been positive.

151
0:07:53.485,000 --> 0:07:54,000
This is Kathleen Maxian.

152
0:07:56.172,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Kathleen's sister Eileen developed breast cancer at age 40

153
0:07:59.453,000 --> 0:08:,000
and she was tested by Myriad.

154
0:08:02.032,000 --> 0:08:03,000
The test was negative.

155
0:08:03.782,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The family was relieved.

156
0:08:05.332,000 --> 0:08:08,000
That meant that Eileen's cancer most likely didn't run in the family,

157
0:08:09.144,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and that other members of her family didn't need to be tested.

158
0:08:12.843,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But two years later,

159
0:08:14.097,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Kathleen was diagnosed with advanced-stage ovarian cancer.

160
0:08:18.927,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It turned out that Kathleen's sister was among the 12 percent

161
0:08:22.823,000 --> 0:08:24,000
who received a false-negative test result.

162
0:08:26.347,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Had Eileen received the proper result,

163
0:08:29.46,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Kathleen would have then been tested,

164
0:08:31.857,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and her ovarian cancer could have been prevented.

165
0:08:36.818,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Once we settled on Myriad,

166
0:08:38.106,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we then had to form a coalition of plaintiffs and experts

167
0:08:42.015,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that could illuminate these problems.

168
0:08:44.127,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We ended up with 20 highly committed plaintiffs:

169
0:08:47.325,000 --> 0:08:48,000
genetic counselors,

170
0:08:48.887,000 --> 0:08:51,000
geneticists who had received cease and desist letters,

171
0:08:52.905,000 --> 0:08:53,000
advocacy organizations,

172
0:08:55.532,000 --> 0:08:58,000
four major scientific organizations that collectively represented

173
0:08:58.621,000 --> 0:09:01,000
more than 150,000 scientists and medical professionals,

174
0:09:02.755,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and individual women who either couldn't afford Myriad's test,

175
0:09:06.076,000 --> 0:09:09,000
or who wanted to obtain a second opinion but could not,

176
0:09:09.104,000 --> 0:09:1,000
as a result of the patents.

177
0:09:12.315,000 --> 0:09:15,000
One of the major challenges we had in preparing the case

178
0:09:15.779,000 --> 0:09:17,000
was figuring out how best to communicate the science.

179
0:09:19.079,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So in order to argue that what Myriad did was not an invention,

180
0:09:22.934,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and that isolated BRCA genes were products of nature,

181
0:09:27.124,000 --> 0:09:29,000
we had to explain a couple of basic concepts, like:

182
0:09:29.861,000 --> 0:09:31,000
What's a gene? What's DNA?

183
0:09:32.029,000 --> 0:09:35,000
How is DNA isolated, and why isn't that an invention?

184
0:09:37.168,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We spent hours and hours with our plaintiffs and experts,

185
0:09:41.054,000 --> 0:09:43,000
trying to come up with ways of explaining these concepts

186
0:09:44.014,000 --> 0:09:45,000
simply yet accurately.

187
0:09:46.306,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And we ended up relying heavily on the use of metaphors,

188
0:09:49.662,000 --> 0:09:5,000
like gold.

189
0:09:51.789,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So isolating DNA --

190
0:09:54.097,000 --> 0:09:56,000
it's like extracting gold from a mountain

191
0:09:57.105,000 --> 0:09:59,000
or taking it out of a stream bed.

192
0:09:59.145,000 --> 0:10:02,000
You might be able to patent the process for mining the gold,

193
0:10:02.843,000 --> 0:10:04,000
but you can't patent the gold itself.

194
0:10:05.929,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It might've taken a lot of hard work and effort

195
0:10:08.696,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to dig the gold out of the mountain;

196
0:10:11.127,000 --> 0:10:13,000
you still can't patent it, it's still gold.

197
0:10:13.432,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And the gold, once it's extracted,

198
0:10:15.212,000 --> 0:10:17,000
can clearly be used for all sorts of things

199
0:10:17.324,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that it couldn't be used for when it was in the mountain;

200
0:10:20.084,000 --> 0:10:22,000
you can make jewelry out of it for example --

201
0:10:22.29,000 --> 0:10:24,000
still can't patent the gold, it's still gold.

202
0:10:25.364,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So now it's 2009, and we're ready to file our case.

203
0:10:30.286,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We filed in federal court in the Southern District of New York,

204
0:10:34.355,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and the case was randomly assigned to Judge Robert Sweet.

205
0:10:38.599,000 --> 0:10:41,000
In March 2010, Judge Sweet issued his opinion --

206
0:10:42.569,000 --> 0:10:43,000
152 pages --

207
0:10:44.834,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and a complete victory for our side.

208
0:10:47.964,000 --> 0:10:48,000
In reading the opinion,

209
0:10:49.419,000 --> 0:10:53,000
we could not get over how eloquently he described the science in the case.

210
0:10:54.504,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I mean, our brief -- it was pretty good,

211
0:10:57.299,000 --> 0:10:58,000
but not this good.

212
0:10:59.778,000 --> 0:11:02,000
How did he develop such a deep understanding of this issue

213
0:11:03.179,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in such a short time?

214
0:11:04.363,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We just could not comprehend how this had happened.

215
0:11:07.995,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So it turned out,

216
0:11:09.283,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Judge Sweet's clerk working for him at the time,

217
0:11:12.617,000 --> 0:11:13,000
was not just a lawyer --

218
0:11:14.121,000 --> 0:11:15,000
he was a scientist.

219
0:11:15.859,000 --> 0:11:16,000
He was not just a scientist --

220
0:11:17.481,000 --> 0:11:2,000
he had a PhD in molecular biology.

221
0:11:20.651,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Laughter)

222
0:11:22.426,000 --> 0:11:24,000
What an incredible stroke of luck!

223
0:11:26.058,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Myriad then appealed

224
0:11:27.382,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

225
0:11:30.496,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And here things got really interesting.

226
0:11:33.465,000 --> 0:11:36,000
First, in a pivotal moment of this case,

227
0:11:37.187,000 --> 0:11:39,000
the US government switched sides.

228
0:11:40.739,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So in the district court the government submitted a brief on Myriad's side.

229
0:11:44.512,000 --> 0:11:49,000
But now in direct opposition to its own patent office,

230
0:11:49.664,000 --> 0:11:51,000
the US government files a brief that states that is has

231
0:11:52.396,000 --> 0:11:55,000
reconsidered this issue in light of the district court's opinion,

232
0:11:56.108,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and has concluded that isolated DNA is not patent eligible.

233
0:11:59.818,000 --> 0:12:,000
This was a really big deal,

234
0:12:01.653,000 --> 0:12:02,000
totally unexpected.

235
0:12:04.773,000 --> 0:12:06,000
The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit

236
0:12:06.877,000 --> 0:12:07,000
hears all patent cases,

237
0:12:08.584,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and it has a reputation for being very, very pro-patent.

238
0:12:12.305,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So even with this remarkable development,

239
0:12:14.755,000 --> 0:12:15,000
we expected to lose.

240
0:12:16.458,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And we did.

241
0:12:18.389,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Sort of.

242
0:12:20.357,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Ends up split decision, 2 to 1.

243
0:12:23.743,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But the two judges who ruled against us,

244
0:12:26.263,000 --> 0:12:28,000
did so for completely different reasons.

245
0:12:29.275,000 --> 0:12:3,000
The first one, Judge Lourie,

246
0:12:31.125,000 --> 0:12:34,000
made up his own novel, biological theory --

247
0:12:34.164,000 --> 0:12:35,000
totally wrong.

248
0:12:35.356,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Laughter)

249
0:12:36.391,000 --> 0:12:38,000
He decided Myriad had created a new chemical --

250
0:12:38.633,000 --> 0:12:39,000
made absolutely no sense.

251
0:12:40.522,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Myriad didn't even argue this, so it came out of the blue.

252
0:12:43.632,000 --> 0:12:44,000
The other, Judge Moore,

253
0:12:45.633,000 --> 0:12:48,000
said she basically agreed with us that isolated DNA is a product of nature.

254
0:12:49.987,000 --> 0:12:52,000
But she's like, "I don't want to shake up the biotech industry."

255
0:12:54.248,000 --> 0:12:56,000
The third, Judge Bryson,

256
0:12:57.233,000 --> 0:12:58,000
agreed with us.

257
0:12:59.75,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So now we sought review by the Supreme Court.

258
0:13:02.305,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And when you petition the Supreme Court,

259
0:13:05.032,000 --> 0:13:08,000
you have to present a question that you want the Court to answer.

260
0:13:08.534,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Usually these questions take the form of a super-long paragraph,

261
0:13:12.285,000 --> 0:13:15,000
like a whole page long with lots and lots of clauses,

262
0:13:15.332,000 --> 0:13:17,000
"wherein this" and "therefore that."

263
0:13:18.294,000 --> 0:13:21,000
We submitted perhaps the shortest question presented ever.

264
0:13:23.312,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Four words:

265
0:13:26.22,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Are human genes patentable?

266
0:13:28.922,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Now when Chris first asked me what I thought of these words,

267
0:13:31.77,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I said, "Well, I don't know.

268
0:13:33.168,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I think you have to say, 'Is isolated DNA patentable?'"

269
0:13:36.968,000 --> 0:13:37,000
"Nope.

270
0:13:38.487,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I want the justices to have the very same reaction that I had

271
0:13:43.132,000 --> 0:13:46,000
when you brought this issue to me seven years ago."

272
0:13:46.896,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Well, I certainly couldn't argue with that.

273
0:13:49.981,000 --> 0:13:51,000
The Supreme Court only hears about one percent

274
0:13:52.888,000 --> 0:13:53,000
of the cases that it receives,

275
0:13:54.578,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and it agreed to hear ours.

276
0:13:57.772,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The day of the oral argument arrives, and it was really, really exciting --

277
0:14:01.923,000 --> 0:14:02,000
long line of people outside,

278
0:14:03.382,000 --> 0:14:05,000
people had been standing in line since 2:30 in the morning

279
0:14:06.17,000 --> 0:14:07,000
to try to get into the courthouse.

280
0:14:07.928,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Two breast cancer organizations,

281
0:14:09.923,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Breast Cancer Action and FORCE,

282
0:14:11.615,000 --> 0:14:13,000
had organized a demonstration on the courthouse steps.

283
0:14:15.232,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Chris and I sat quietly in the hallway,

284
0:14:18.776,000 --> 0:14:21,000
moments before he was to walk in and argue

285
0:14:21.814,000 --> 0:14:23,000
the most important case of his career.

286
0:14:24.765,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I was clearly more nervous than he was.

287
0:14:28.096,000 --> 0:14:32,000
But any remaining panic subsided as I walked into the courtroom

288
0:14:32.88,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and looked around at a sea of friendly faces:

289
0:14:36.059,000 --> 0:14:37,000
our individual women clients

290
0:14:37.848,000 --> 0:14:39,000
who had shared their deeply personal stories,

291
0:14:41.21,000 --> 0:14:44,000
the geneticists who had taken huge chunks of time out of their busy careers

292
0:14:44.86,000 --> 0:14:45,000
to dedicate themselves to this fight

293
0:14:47.122,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and representatives from a diverse array

294
0:14:49.725,000 --> 0:14:5,000
of medical, patient advocacy,

295
0:14:51.636,000 --> 0:14:53,000
environmental and religious organizations,

296
0:14:53.736,000 --> 0:14:56,000
who had submitted friend of the court briefs in the case.

297
0:14:58.609,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Also in the room were three leaders of the Human Genome Project,

298
0:15:01.658,000 --> 0:15:03,000
including the co-discoverer of DNA himself,

299
0:15:04.354,000 --> 0:15:05,000
James Watson,

300
0:15:05.668,000 --> 0:15:07,000
who had submitted a brief to the court,

301
0:15:07.838,000 --> 0:15:1,000
where he referred to gene patenting as "lunacy."

302
0:15:11.373,000 --> 0:15:12,000
(Laughter)

303
0:15:13.245,000 --> 0:15:16,000
The diversity of the communities represented in this room

304
0:15:16.906,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and the contributions each had made to make this day a reality

305
0:15:20.371,000 --> 0:15:22,000
spoke volumes to what was at stake.

306
0:15:23.386,000 --> 0:15:25,000
The argument itself was riveting.

307
0:15:26.205,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Chris argued brilliantly.

308
0:15:27.892,000 --> 0:15:28,000
But for me,

309
0:15:29.161,000 --> 0:15:32,000
the most thrilling aspect was watching the Supreme Court justices grapple

310
0:15:32.949,000 --> 0:15:33,000
with isolated DNA,

311
0:15:34.542,000 --> 0:15:37,000
through a series of colorful analogies and feisty exchanges,

312
0:15:37.792,000 --> 0:15:4,000
very much the same way as our legal team had done

313
0:15:41.156,000 --> 0:15:42,000
for the past seven years.

314
0:15:43.666,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Justice Kagan likened isolating DNA

315
0:15:46.346,000 --> 0:15:48,000
to extracting a medicinal plant from the Amazon.

316
0:15:50.516,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Justice Roberts distinguished it from carving a baseball bat from a tree.

317
0:15:55.995,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And in one of my absolutely favorite moments,

318
0:15:58.501,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Justice Sotomayor proclaimed isolated DNA to be "just nature sitting there."

319
0:16:03.794,000 --> 0:16:04,000
(Laughter)

320
0:16:05.318,000 --> 0:16:07,000
We felt pretty confident leaving the courtroom that day,

321
0:16:08.217,000 --> 0:16:11,000
but I could never have anticipated the outcome:

322
0:16:12.574,000 --> 0:16:13,000
nine to zero.

323
0:16:15.025,000 --> 0:16:18,000
"A naturally occurring DNA segment is a product of nature,

324
0:16:18.771,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and not patent-eligible merely because it has been isolated.

325
0:16:22.394,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And furthermore,

326
0:16:23.765,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Myriad did not create anything."

327
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Within 24 hours of the decision,

328
0:16:30.18,000 --> 0:16:31,000
five labs had announced

329
0:16:31.596,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that they would begin to offer testing for the BRCA genes.

330
0:16:35.149,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Some of them promised to offer the tests at a lower price than Myriad's.

331
0:16:39.142,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Some promised to provide a more comprehensive test

332
0:16:42.086,000 --> 0:16:43,000
than the one Myriad was offering.

333
0:16:44.49,000 --> 0:16:46,000
But of course the decision goes far beyond Myriad.

334
0:16:47.352,000 --> 0:16:51,000
It ends a 25-year practice of allowing patents on human genes

335
0:16:51.772,000 --> 0:16:52,000
in the United States.

336
0:16:53.383,000 --> 0:16:57,000
It clears a significant barrier to biomedical discovery and innovation.

337
0:16:58.484,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And it helps to ensure that patients like Abigail, Kathleen and Eileen

338
0:17:03.409,000 --> 0:17:05,000
have access to the tests that they need.

339
0:17:06.991,000 --> 0:17:09,000
A few weeks after the court issued its decision,

340
0:17:10.23,000 --> 0:17:12,000
I received a small package in the mail.

341
0:17:13.246,000 --> 0:17:14,000
It was from Bob Cook-Deegan,

342
0:17:14.877,000 --> 0:17:16,000
a professor at Duke University

343
0:17:17.17,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and one the very first people Chris and I went to visit

344
0:17:20.418,000 --> 0:17:22,000
when we started to consider whether to bring this case.

345
0:17:24.033,000 --> 0:17:26,000
I opened it up to find a small stuffed animal.

346
0:17:28.344,000 --> 0:17:3,000
(Laughter)

347
0:17:33.568,000 --> 0:17:35,000
We took a big risk in taking this case.

348
0:17:36.722,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Part of what gave us the courage to take that risk

349
0:17:39.256,000 --> 0:17:41,000
was knowing that we were doing the right thing.

350
0:17:42.079,000 --> 0:17:45,000
The process took nearly eight years from the start to finish,

351
0:17:45.833,000 --> 0:17:47,000
with many twists and turns along the way.

352
0:17:48.578,000 --> 0:17:49,000
A little luck certainly helped,

353
0:17:50.888,000 --> 0:17:52,000
but it was the communities that we bridged,

354
0:17:53.724,000 --> 0:17:55,000
the alliances that we created,

355
0:17:55.839,000 --> 0:17:56,000
that made pigs fly.

356
0:17:57.802,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Thank you.

357
0:17:58.982,000 --> 0:18:03,000
(Applause)

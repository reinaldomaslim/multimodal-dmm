1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Is there anything unique about human beings?

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
There is.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We're the only creatures

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
with fully developed moral sentiments.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We're obsessed with morality as social creatures.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We need to know why people are doing what they're doing.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I personally am obsessed with morality.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It was all due to this woman,

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Sister Mary Marastela,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
also known as my mom.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
As an altar boy, I breathed in a lot of incense,

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and I learned to say phrases in Latin,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
but I also had time to think

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
about whether my mother's top-down morality

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
applied to everybody.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I saw that people who were religious and non-religious

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
were equally obsessed with morality.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I thought, maybe there's some earthly basis

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
for moral decisions.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But I wanted to go further

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
than to say our brains make us moral.

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I want to know if there's a chemistry of morality.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I want to know

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
if there was a moral molecule.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
After 10 years of experiments,

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I found it.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Would you like to see it? I brought some with me.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This little syringe

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
contains the moral molecule.

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's called oxytocin.

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So oxytocin is a simple and ancient molecule

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
found only in mammals.

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
In rodents, it was known

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to make mothers care for their offspring,

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and in some creatures,

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
allowed for toleration of burrowmates.

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But in humans, it was only known

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to facilitate birth and breastfeeding in women,

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and is released by both sexes during sex.

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
So I had this idea that oxytocin might be the moral molecule.

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I did what most of us do -- I tried it on some colleagues.

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
One of them told me,

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
"Paul, that is the world's stupidist idea.

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It is," he said, "only a female molecule.

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It can't be that important."

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But I countered, "Well men's brains make this too.

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
There must be a reason why."

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But he was right, it was a stupid idea.

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But it was testably stupid.

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
In other words, I thought I could design an experiment

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to see if oxytocin made people moral.

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Turns out it wasn't so easy.

54
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
First of all, oxytocin is a shy molecule.

55
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Baseline levels are near zero,

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
without some stimulus to cause its release.

57
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And when it's produced, it has a three-minute half-life,

58
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and degrades rapidly at room temperature.

59
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So this experiment would have to cause a surge of oxytocin,

60
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
have to grab it fast and keep it cold.

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I think I can do that.

62
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Now luckily, oxytocin is produced

63
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
both in the brain and in the blood,

64
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
so I could do this experiment without learning neurosurgery.

65
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Then I had to measure morality.

66
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So taking on Morality with a capital M is a huge project.

67
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So I started smaller.

68
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I studied one single virtue:

69
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
trustworthiness.

70
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Why? I had shown in the early 2000s

71
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that countries with a higher proportion of trustworthy people

72
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
are more prosperous.

73
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So in these countries, more economic transactions occur

74
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and more wealth is created,

75
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
alleviating poverty.

76
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So poor countries are by and large low trust countries.

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So if I understood the chemistry of trustworthiness,

78
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I might help alleviate poverty.

79
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But I'm also a skeptic.

80
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I don't want to just ask people, "Are you trustworthy?"

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So instead I use

82
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the Jerry Maguire approach to research.

83
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
If you're so virtuous,

84
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
show me the money.

85
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So what we do in my lab

86
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
is we tempt people with virtue and vice by using money.

87
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Let me show you how we do that.

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So we recruit some people for an experiment.

89
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They all get $10 if they agree to show up.

90
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
We give them lots of instruction, and we never ever deceive them.

91
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Then we match them in pairs by computer.

92
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And in that pair, one person gets a message saying,

93
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"Do you want to give up some of your $10

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
you earned for being here

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and ship it to someone else in the lab?"

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
The trick is you can't see them,

97
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
you can't talk to them.

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You only do it one time.

99
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Now whatever you give up

100
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
gets tripled in the other person's account.

101
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You're going to make them a lot wealthier.

102
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And they get a message by computer saying

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
person one sent you this amount of money.

104
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Do you want to keep it all,

105
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
or do you want to send some amount back?

106
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So think about this experiment for minute.

107
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
You're going to sit on these hard chairs for an hour and a half.

108
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Some mad scientist is going to jab your arm with a needle

109
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and take four tubes of blood.

110
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And now you want me to give up this money and ship it to a stranger?

111
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So this was the birth of vampire economics.

112
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Make a decision and give me some blood.

113
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So in fact, experimental economists

114
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
had run this test around the world,

115
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and for much higher stakes,

116
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and the consensus view

117
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
was that the measure from the first person to the second was a measure of trust,

118
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and the transfer from the second person back to the first

119
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
measured trustworthiness.

120
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
But in fact, economists were flummoxed

121
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
on why the second person would ever return any money.

122
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They assumed money is good,

123
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
why not keep it all?

124
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
That's not what we found.

125
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We found 90 percent of the first decision-makers sent money,

126
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and of those who received money,

127
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
95 percent returned some of it.

128
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
But why?

129
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Well by measuring oxytocin

130
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
we found that the more money the second person received,

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the more their brain produced oxytocin,

132
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and the more oxytocin on board,

133
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the more money they returned.

134
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So we have a biology of trustworthiness.

135
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But wait. What's wrong with this experiment?

136
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Two things.

137
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
One is that nothing in the body happens in isolation.

138
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So we measured nine other molecules that interact with oxytocin,

139
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but they didn't have any effect.

140
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But the second is

141
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that I still only had this indirect relationship

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
between oxytocin and trustworthiness.

143
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I didn't know for sure

144
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
oxytocin caused trustworthiness.

145
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So to make the experiment,

146
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I knew I'd have to go into the brain

147
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and manipulate oxytocin directly.

148
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I used everything short of a drill

149
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to get oxytocin into my own brain.

150
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And I found I could do it

151
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
with a nasal inhaler.

152
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So along with colleagues in Zurich,

153
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we put 200 men on oxytocin or placebo,

154
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
had that same trust test with money,

155
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and we found that those on oxytocin not only showed more trust,

156
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
we can more than double the number of people

157
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
who sent all their money to a stranger --

158
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
all without altering mood or cognition.

159
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So oxytocin is the trust molecule,

160
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
but is it the moral molecule?

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Using the oxytocin inhaler,

162
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
we ran more studies.

163
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We showed that oxytocin infusion

164
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
increases generosity

165
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
in unilateral monetary transfers

166
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
by 80 percent.

167
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We showed it increases donations to charity

168
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
by 50 percent.

169
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We've also investigated

170
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
non-pharmacologic ways to raise oxytocin.

171
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
These include massage,

172
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
dancing and praying.

173
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Yes, my mom was happy about that last one.

174
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And whenever we raise oxytocin,

175
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
people willingly open up their wallets

176
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and share money with strangers.

177
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But why do they do this?

178
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
What does it feel like

179
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
when your brain is flooded with oxytocin?

180
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
To investigate this question, we ran an experiment

181
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
where we had people watch a video

182
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
of a father and his four year-old son,

183
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and his son has terminal brain cancer.

184
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
After they watched the video, we had them rate their feelings

185
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and took blood before and after to measure oxytocin.

186
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The change in oxytocin

187
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
predicted their feelings of empathy.

188
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
So it's empathy

189
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that makes us connect to other people.

190
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's empathy that makes us help other people.

191
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
It's empathy that makes us moral.

192
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Now this idea is not new.

193
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
A then unknown philosopher named Adam Smith

194
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
wrote a book in 1759

195
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
called "The Theory of Moral Sentiments."

196
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
In this book, Smith argued

197
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that we are moral creatures, not because of a top-down reason,

198
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but for a bottom-up reason.

199
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
He said we're social creatures,

200
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
so we share the emotions of others.

201
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
So if I do something that hurts you, I feel that pain.

202
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So I tend to avoid that.

203
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
If I do something that makes you happy, I get to share your joy.

204
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So I tend to do those things.

205
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Now this is the same Adam Smith who, 17 years later,

206
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
would write a little book called "The Wealth of Nations" --

207
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
the founding document of economics.

208
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But he was, in fact, a moral philosopher,

209
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and he was right on why we're moral.

210
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I just found the molecule behind it.

211
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
But knowing that molecule is valuable,

212
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
because it tells us how to turn up this behavior

213
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and what turns it off.

214
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
In particular, it tells us

215
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
why we see immorality.

216
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So to investigate immorality,

217
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
let me bring you back now to 1980.

218
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
I'm working at a gas station

219
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
on the outskirts of Santa Barbara, California.

220
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
You sit in a gas station all day,

221
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
you see lots of morality and immorality, let me tell you.

222
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So one Sunday afternoon, a man walks into my cashier's booth

223
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
with this beautiful jewelry box.

224
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Opens it up and there's a pearl necklace inside.

225
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And he said, "Hey, I was in the men's room.

226
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I just found this. What do you think we should do with it?"

227
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
"I don't know, put it in the lost and found."

228
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
"Well this is very valuable.

229
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We have to find the owner for this." I said, "Yea."

230
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
So we're trying to decide what to do with this,

231
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and the phone rings.

232
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And a man says very excitedly,

233
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
"I was in your gas station a while ago,

234
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and I bought this jewelry for my wife, and I can't find it."

235
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I said, "Pearl necklace?" "Yeah."

236
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
"Hey, a guy just found it."

237
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
"Oh, you're saving my life. Here's my phone number.

238
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Tell that guy to wait half an hour.

239
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I'll be there and I'll give him a $200 reward."

240
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Great, so I tell the guy, "Look, relax.

241
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Get yourself a fat reward. Life's good."

242
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
He said, "I can't do it.

243
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I have this job interview in Galena in 15 minutes,

244
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and I need this job, I've got to go."

245
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Again he asked me, "What do you think we should do?"

246
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I'm in high school. I have no idea.

247
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So I said, "I'll hold it for you."

248
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
He said, "You know, you've been so nice, let's split the reward."

249
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I'll give you the jewelry, you give me a hundred dollars,

250
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and when the guy comes ... "

251
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
You see it. I was conned.

252
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So this is a classic con called the pigeon drop,

253
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and I was the pigeon.

254
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So the way many cons work

255
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is not that the conman gets the victim to trust him,

256
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
it's that he shows he trusts the victim.

257
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Now we know what happens.

258
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The victim's brain releases oxytocin,

259
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and you're opening up your wallet or purse, giving away the money.

260
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So who are these people

261
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
who manipulate our oxytocin systems?

262
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We found, testing thousands of individuals,

263
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that five percent of the population

264
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
don't release oxytocin on stimulus.

265
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So if you trust them, their brains don't release oxytocin.

266
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
If there's money on the table, they keep it all.

267
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So there's a technical word for these people in my lab.

268
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We call them bastards.

269
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
(Laughter)

270
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
These are not people you want to have a beer with.

271
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They have many of the attributes of psychopaths.

272
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Now there are other ways the system can be inhibited.

273
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
One is through improper nurturing.

274
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So we've studied sexually abused women,

275
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and about half those don't release oxytocin on stimulus.

276
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
You need enough nurturing

277
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
for this system to develop properly.

278
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Also, high stress inhibits oxytocin.

279
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So we all know this, when we're really stressed out,

280
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
we're not acting our best.

281
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
There's another way oxytocin is inhibited, which is interesting --

282
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
through the action of testosterone.

283
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
So we, in experiments, have administered testosterone to men.

284
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And instead of sharing money,

285
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
they become selfish.

286
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But interestingly,

287
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
high testosterone males are also more likely

288
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
to use their own money to punish others for being selfish.

289
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

290
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Now think about this. It means, within our own biology,

291
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
we have the yin and yang of morality.

292
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
We have oxytocin that connects us to others,

293
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
makes us feel what they feel.

294
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And we have testosterone.

295
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And men have 10 times the testosterone as women,

296
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
so men do this more than women --

297
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
we have testosterone that makes us want to punish

298
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
people who behave immorally.

299
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We don't need God or government telling us what to do.

300
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It's all inside of us.

301
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So you may be wondering:

302
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
these are beautiful laboratory experiments,

303
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
do they really apply to real life?

304
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Yeah, I've been worrying about that too.

305
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So I've gone out of the lab

306
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
to see if this really holds in our daily lives.

307
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So last summer, I attended a wedding in Southern England.

308
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
200 people in this beautiful Victorian mansion.

309
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I didn't know a single person.

310
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And I drove up in my rented Vauxhall.

311
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And I took out a centrifuge and dry ice

312
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and needles and tubes.

313
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And I took blood from the bride and the groom

314
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and the wedding party and the family and the friends

315
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
before and immediately after the vows.

316
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Laughter)

317
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And guess what?

318
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Weddings cause a release of oxytocin,

319
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
but they do so in a very particular way.

320
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Who is the center of the wedding solar system?

321
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
The bride.

322
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
She had the biggest increase in oxytocin.

323
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Who loves the wedding almost as much as the bride?

324
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Her mother, that's right.

325
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Her mother was number two.

326
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Then the groom's father, then the groom,

327
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
then the family, then the friends --

328
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
arrayed around the bride

329
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
like planets around the Sun.

330
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So I think it tells us that we've designed this ritual

331
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
to connect us to this new couple,

332
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
connect us emotionally.

333
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Why? Because we need them to be successful at reproducing

334
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to perpetuate the species.

335
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I also worried that my trust experiments with small amounts of money

336
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
didn't really capture how often we actually trust our lives to strangers.

337
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So even though I have a fear of heights,

338
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I recently strapped myself to another human being

339
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft.

340
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I took my blood before and after,

341
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and I had a huge spike of oxytocin.

342
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And there are so many ways we can connect to people.

343
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
For example, through social media.

344
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Many people are Tweeting right now.

345
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So we investigated the role of social media

346
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and found the using social media

347
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
produced a solid double-digit increase in oxytocin.

348
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So I ran this experiment recently for the Korean Broadcasting System.

349
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And they had the reporters and their producers participate.

350
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And one of these guys, he must have been 22,

351
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
he had 150 percent spike in oxytocin.

352
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
I mean, astounding; no one has this.

353
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
So he was using social media in private.

354
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
When I wrote my report to the Koreans,

355
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
I said, "Look, I don't know what this guy was doing,"

356
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
but my guess was interacting with his mother or his girlfriend.

357
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
They checked.

358
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
He was interacting on his girlfriend's Facebook page.

359
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
There you go. That's connection.

360
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
So there's tons of ways that we can connect to other people,

361
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and it seems to be universal.

362
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Two weeks ago,

363
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I just got back from Papua New Guinea

364
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
where I went up to the highlands --

365
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
very isolated tribes of subsistence farmers

366
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
living as they have lived for millenia.

367
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
There are 800 different languages in the highlands.

368
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
These are the most primitive people in the world.

369
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And they indeed also release oxytocin.

370
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
So oxytocin connects us to other people.

371
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Oxytocin makes us feel what other people feel.

372
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And it's so easy to cause people's brains

373
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to release oxytocin.

374
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I know how to do it,

375
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and my favorite way to do it is, in fact, the easiest.

376
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Let me show it to you.

377
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Come here. Give me a hug.

378
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Laughter)

379
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
There you go.

380
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Applause)

381
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
So my penchant for hugging other people

382
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
has earned me the nickname Dr. Love.

383
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I'm happy to share a little more love in the world,

384
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
it's great,

385
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
but here's your prescription from Dr. Love:

386
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
eight hugs a day.

387
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
We have found that people who release more oxytocin

388
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
are happier.

389
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And they're happier

390
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
because they have better relationships of all types.

391
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Dr. Love says eight hugs a day.

392
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Eight hugs a day -- you'll be happier

393
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and the world will be a better place.

394
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Of course, if you don't like to touch people, I can always shove this up your nose.

395
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
(Laughter)

396
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Thank you.

397
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
(Applause)

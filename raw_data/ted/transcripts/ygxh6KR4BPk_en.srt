1
0:00:13.042,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In almost all aspects of our lives

2
0:00:15.125,000 --> 0:00:19,000
we have perfect information available instantaneously.

3
0:00:20.042,000 --> 0:00:23,000
My phone can tell me everything about my finances,

4
0:00:23.333,000 --> 0:00:25,000
where precisely I am on a map

5
0:00:25.583,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and the best way to my next destination,

6
0:00:27.75,000 --> 0:00:29,000
all with a click of a button.

7
0:00:30.333,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But this availability of information and transparency

8
0:00:33.458,000 --> 0:00:36,000
almost completely disappears when it comes to consumer products.

9
0:00:38.208,000 --> 0:00:41,000
If you go to the seafood counter at your local supermarket,

10
0:00:41.542,000 --> 0:00:44,000
you can probably choose between several different types of fish.

11
0:00:45.375,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But chances are, they won't be able to tell you

12
0:00:47.958,000 --> 0:00:5,000
who caught the fish, where precisely it was caught,

13
0:00:51.125,000 --> 0:00:53,000
whether it is sustainable to catch it there

14
0:00:53.417,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and how it got transported.

15
0:00:56.083,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And that holds true for almost everything we buy.

16
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:,000
Every can of soup,

17
0:01:00.792,000 --> 0:01:02,000
every piece of meat, every T-shirt.

18
0:01:03.333,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We as humans, right now,

19
0:01:05.625,000 --> 0:01:08,000
are destroying the only thing we really need to survive:

20
0:01:09.167,000 --> 0:01:1,000
our planet.

21
0:01:10.458,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And most of the horrible problems that we're facing today,

22
0:01:13.5,000 --> 0:01:14,000
like climate change

23
0:01:14.792,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and modern slavery in supply chains,

24
0:01:17.5,000 --> 0:01:18,000
come down to decisions.

25
0:01:19.25,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Human decisions to produce something one way and not another.

26
0:01:24.958,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And that's how we, as consumers,

27
0:01:27.208,000 --> 0:01:29,000
end up making decisions that harm the planet

28
0:01:30.208,000 --> 0:01:31,000
or our fellow humans.

29
0:01:31.875,000 --> 0:01:33,000
By choosing the wrong products.

30
0:01:35.167,000 --> 0:01:38,000
But I refuse to believe that anybody here in this room,

31
0:01:38.542,000 --> 0:01:4,000
or frankly, anybody on this planet,

32
0:01:40.625,000 --> 0:01:41,000
really wants to buy a product

33
0:01:42.542,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that harms the planet or our fellow humans

34
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:47,000
if given the choice.

35
0:01:48.583,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But you see, choice is a loaded word.

36
0:01:50.792,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Choice means there's another option.

37
0:01:53.167,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Choice means you can afford that option.

38
0:01:56.208,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But choice also means

39
0:01:57.708,000 --> 0:02:01,000
you have enough information to make an informed decision.

40
0:02:01.792,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And that information nowadays simply just doesn't exist.

41
0:02:06.875,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Or at least it's really, really hard to access.

42
0:02:11.625,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But I think this is about to change.

43
0:02:13.667,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Because we can use technology to solve this information problem.

44
0:02:17.75,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And many of the specific technologies that we need to do that

45
0:02:20.833,000 --> 0:02:23,000
have become better and cheaper over the recent years,

46
0:02:24.542,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and are now ready to be used at scale.

47
0:02:27.458,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So, over the past two years,

48
0:02:28.875,000 --> 0:02:29,000
my team and I have been working

49
0:02:30.583,000 --> 0:02:34,000
with one of the world's largest conservation organizations, WWF,

50
0:02:34.833,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and we've founded a company called OpenSC,

51
0:02:38.5,000 --> 0:02:4,000
where SC stands for supply chain.

52
0:02:41.708,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And we believe that by using technology

53
0:02:44.125,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we can help to create

54
0:02:47.5,000 --> 0:02:5,000
transparency and traceability in supply chains,

55
0:02:50.833,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and through that, help to completely revolutionize

56
0:02:54.375,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the way that we buy and also produce products as humans.

57
0:03:00.333,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now, some of this is going to sound a little bit like science fiction,

58
0:03:04.208,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but it's already happening.

59
0:03:06.083,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Let me explain.

60
0:03:08.208,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So, in order to solve this information problem,

61
0:03:10.833,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we need to do three things:

62
0:03:12.542,000 --> 0:03:15,000
verify, trace and share.

63
0:03:15.833,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Verify specific sustainability

64
0:03:19.333,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and ethical production claims

65
0:03:21.167,000 --> 0:03:23,000
in a data-based and automated way.

66
0:03:24.042,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Then trace those individual physical products

67
0:03:26.917,000 --> 0:03:27,000
throughout their supply chains,

68
0:03:28.625,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and finally, share that information with consumers

69
0:03:31.667,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in a way that truly gives them a choice

70
0:03:34.125,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and lets them make consumption decisions

71
0:03:36.125,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that are more aligned with their values.

72
0:03:38.958,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I'm going to use a real product

73
0:03:42.292,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and a supply chain where we've made all of this a reality already:

74
0:03:46.75,000 --> 0:03:47,000
a Patagonian toothfish,

75
0:03:48.042,000 --> 0:03:51,000
or Chilean sea bass, as it's called in the US.

76
0:03:51.083,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Number one, verify.

77
0:03:53.792,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Verify how something is produced.

78
0:03:56.375,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But not just by saying, "Trust me, this is good,

79
0:03:59.208,000 --> 0:04:01,000
trust me, we've done all the right things,"

80
0:04:01.417,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but by producing evidence for that individual physical product,

81
0:04:05.458,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and the way it was produced.

82
0:04:07.75,000 --> 0:04:08,000
By producing evidence

83
0:04:09.042,000 --> 0:04:12,000
for a specific sustainability or ethical production claim.

84
0:04:12.833,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So for example, in the case of the fish,

85
0:04:15.708,000 --> 0:04:18,000
has this fish been caught in an area where there's enough of them,

86
0:04:19.625,000 --> 0:04:21,000
so that it's sustainable to catch it there

87
0:04:21.667,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and not in a marine protected area?

88
0:04:24.375,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So what we're doing here

89
0:04:25.75,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is we're taking almost real-time GPS data from the ship --

90
0:04:29.667,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the ship that's fishing --

91
0:04:31.208,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and that tells us where the ship is

92
0:04:33.458,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and where it's going at what speed.

93
0:04:36.042,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And we can then combine that with other types of data,

94
0:04:39.208,000 --> 0:04:41,000
like, for example, how deep the sea floor is.

95
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And combining all of this information,

96
0:04:44.667,000 --> 0:04:48,000
our machine-learning algorithms can then verify, in an automated way,

97
0:04:48.833,000 --> 0:04:51,000
whether the ship is only fishing where it's supposed to, or not.

98
0:04:53.875,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And as sensors become cheaper,

99
0:04:56.458,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we can put them in more places.

100
0:04:58.5,000 --> 0:05:,000
And that means we can capture more data,

101
0:05:00.875,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and combining that with advancements in data science,

102
0:05:03.708,000 --> 0:05:06,000
it means that we can now verify

103
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:11,000
specific sustainability and ethical production claims

104
0:05:11.042,000 --> 0:05:15,000
in an automated, real-time and ongoing manner.

105
0:05:15.25,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And that really lays the basis for this information revolution.

106
0:05:19.417,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So, number two, trace.

107
0:05:21.625,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Trace those individual physical products,

108
0:05:24.708,000 --> 0:05:26,000
so that we can truly say

109
0:05:26.75,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that the claim that we've verified about a certain product

110
0:05:29.5,000 --> 0:05:31,000
actually belongs to that individual product

111
0:05:32.5,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that we as consumers have right in front of us.

112
0:05:35.042,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Because without that level of traceability,

113
0:05:38.375,000 --> 0:05:4,000
all that we've really verified in the first place

114
0:05:41.25,000 --> 0:05:43,000
is that somebody, somewhere, at some point

115
0:05:44.125,000 --> 0:05:46,000
caught a fish in a sustainable way,

116
0:05:46.458,000 --> 0:05:5,000
or didn't harm the employee when asking them to produce a T-shirt,

117
0:05:51.375,000 --> 0:05:55,000
or didn't use pesticides when growing a vegetable that didn't actually need it.

118
0:05:57.292,000 --> 0:06:,000
Only if I give a product an identity from the start

119
0:06:01.25,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and then trace it throughout the whole supply chain,

120
0:06:04.042,000 --> 0:06:07,000
can this claim and the value that's been created

121
0:06:07.667,000 --> 0:06:09,000
by producing it in the right way

122
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:11,000
truly stay with it.

123
0:06:13.542,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now, I've talked about cheaper sensors.

124
0:06:16.167,000 --> 0:06:18,000
There are many other technological developments

125
0:06:18.667,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that make all of this much more possible today than every before.

126
0:06:22.917,000 --> 0:06:24,000
For example, the falling costs of tags.

127
0:06:26.792,000 --> 0:06:29,000
You give a product a name,

128
0:06:29.875,000 --> 0:06:31,000
a serial number, an identity,

129
0:06:31.917,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the tag is its passport.

130
0:06:34.125,000 --> 0:06:37,000
What you can see here is a toothfish being caught.

131
0:06:37.458,000 --> 0:06:39,000
This is what's called a longline fishery,

132
0:06:39.792,000 --> 0:06:43,000
so the fish are coming up onto the boat on individual hooks.

133
0:06:44.042,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And as soon as the fish is on board,

134
0:06:46.333,000 --> 0:06:48,000
it is killed, and then after that,

135
0:06:48.625,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we insert a small tag into the fish's flesh.

136
0:06:52.083,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And in that tag, there is an RFID chip with a unique serial number,

137
0:06:56.625,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and that tag follows the fish throughout the whole supply chain

138
0:06:59.667,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and makes it really easy to sense its presence

139
0:07:01.875,000 --> 0:07:04,000
at any port, on any truck or in any processing plant.

140
0:07:05.417,000 --> 0:07:08,000
But consumers can't really read RFID tags.

141
0:07:08.708,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And so, when it comes to filleting and packaging the fish,

142
0:07:12.958,000 --> 0:07:14,000
we read the RFID tag and then remove it.

143
0:07:15.875,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And then we add a unique QR code to the packaging of the fish.

144
0:07:20.125,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And that QR code then points back to the same information

145
0:07:24.625,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that we've verified about the fish in the first place.

146
0:07:29.083,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And so, depending on the type of product that we're working with,

147
0:07:32.958,000 --> 0:07:35,000
we may use QR codes, bar codes, RFID tags

148
0:07:36.75,000 --> 0:07:37,000
or other tag technologies.

149
0:07:38.542,000 --> 0:07:4,000
But there are also technologies

150
0:07:40.667,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that are at the brink of large-scale breakthrough

151
0:07:43.083,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that make tags themselves obsolete.

152
0:07:45.083,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Like, for example,

153
0:07:46.708,000 --> 0:07:48,000
analyzing a product for trace elements

154
0:07:49.458,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that can then tell you quite accurately where it is actually from.

155
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Then there's blockchain.

156
0:07:54.417,000 --> 0:07:58,000
A decentralized technology can act as a catalyst for this revolution.

157
0:07:59.25,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Because it can help mitigate some of the trust issues

158
0:08:03.042,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that are inherent to giving people information

159
0:08:06.542,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and then asking them to change their consumption behavior

160
0:08:09.75,000 --> 0:08:11,000
because of that information.

161
0:08:12.125,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And so, we use blockchain technology

162
0:08:14.833,000 --> 0:08:17,000
where it adds value to what we're doing.

163
0:08:18.083,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But importantly,

164
0:08:19.375,000 --> 0:08:22,000
we don't let the limitations that this technology still has today,

165
0:08:22.542,000 --> 0:08:24,000
like, for example, with regards to scaling,

166
0:08:24.625,000 --> 0:08:25,000
we don't let that stand in our way.

167
0:08:26.625,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And that brings us to the third point.

168
0:08:29.125,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Share.

169
0:08:30.417,000 --> 0:08:33,000
How to share the information that we've verified and tracked

170
0:08:34.292,000 --> 0:08:36,000
about where a product is from, how it was produced

171
0:08:37.125,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and how it got to where it is?

172
0:08:39.625,000 --> 0:08:4,000
How to share this information

173
0:08:41.583,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is really different from product to product.

174
0:08:44.458,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And different from where you buy it.

175
0:08:46.792,000 --> 0:08:48,000
You behave differently in those situations.

176
0:08:49.375,000 --> 0:08:52,000
You are stressed and time-poor in the supermarket.

177
0:08:53.042,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Or with short attention span over dinner,

178
0:08:55.333,000 --> 0:08:57,000
because your date is so cute.

179
0:08:57.542,000 --> 0:09:,000
Or you are critical and inquisitive

180
0:09:00.583,000 --> 0:09:03,000
when researching for a larger purchase online.

181
0:09:04.75,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And so for our fish,

182
0:09:06.375,000 --> 0:09:08,000
we've developed a digital experience

183
0:09:09.333,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that works when buying the fish in a freezer in a fish specialty store

184
0:09:15.125,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and that gives you all of the information about the fish and its journey.

185
0:09:18.958,000 --> 0:09:2,000
But we also worked with a restaurant

186
0:09:21.625,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and developed a different digital experience

187
0:09:24.625,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that only summarizes the key facts about the fish and its journey,

188
0:09:28.208,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and works better in a dinner setting

189
0:09:30.667,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and, hopefully, there doesn't annoy your date too much.

190
0:09:34.25,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Now, that brings us full circle.

191
0:09:36.625,000 --> 0:09:39,000
We've verified that the fish was caught

192
0:09:39.667,000 --> 0:09:41,000
in an area where it's sustainable to do so.

193
0:09:42.667,000 --> 0:09:44,000
We've then traced it throughout the entire supply chain

194
0:09:45.292,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to maintain its identity and all the information that's attached to it.

195
0:09:49.417,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And then, we've shared that information with consumers

196
0:09:52,000 --> 0:09:53,000
in a way that gives them a choice

197
0:09:53.833,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and lets them make consumption decisions

198
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that are more in line with their values.

199
0:09:59.542,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Now, for this fish example, this is already rolled out at scale.

200
0:10:03.667,000 --> 0:10:04,000
This season,

201
0:10:04.958,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the entire fleet of the world's largest toothfish fishing company,

202
0:10:08.542,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Austral Fisheries,

203
0:10:09.917,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is tagging every single fish that they catch

204
0:10:12.792,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and that ends up in their premium branded "Glacier 51" product.

205
0:10:17.208,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And you can already buy this fish.

206
0:10:19.375,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And with it, you can have all of the information I talked about today,

207
0:10:23.292,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and much more,

208
0:10:24.792,000 --> 0:10:28,000
attached to each individual fish or portion of the fish that you may buy.

209
0:10:30.583,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But this is not a fish or seafood thing.

210
0:10:34.667,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We're working on many, many different commodities and products

211
0:10:37.875,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and their supply chains across the globe.

212
0:10:40.292,000 --> 0:10:42,000
From dairy to fruit and vegetables,

213
0:10:42.917,000 --> 0:10:44,000
to nonfood products made out of wood.

214
0:10:45.708,000 --> 0:10:49,000
As a consumer, all of this may sound like a huge burden,

215
0:10:50.25,000 --> 0:10:53,000
because you don't have time to look at all of this information

216
0:10:53.792,000 --> 0:10:55,000
every time you buy something.

217
0:10:56.292,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And I don't expect you to,

218
0:10:58.042,000 --> 0:11:01,000
because you'll have help with that.

219
0:11:01.167,000 --> 0:11:06,000
In the future, we'll leave the decision of which specific product to buy

220
0:11:06.542,000 --> 0:11:08,000
increasingly up to machines.

221
0:11:08.75,000 --> 0:11:1,000
An algorithm will know enough about you

222
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:15,000
to make those decisions for you, so you don't have to.

223
0:11:15.5,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And maybe it will even do a better job at it.

224
0:11:18.375,000 --> 0:11:2,000
In a recent study, 85 percent of those

225
0:11:20.833,000 --> 0:11:23,000
buying a product through a virtual assistant

226
0:11:23.875,000 --> 0:11:24,000
said that they, on occasion,

227
0:11:25.708,000 --> 0:11:27,000
actually went with the top product recommendation

228
0:11:28.083,000 --> 0:11:29,000
of that virtual assistant,

229
0:11:29.375,000 --> 0:11:31,000
rather than the specific product or brand

230
0:11:31.458,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that they set out to buy in the first place.

231
0:11:34.208,000 --> 0:11:35,000
You just say you need toilet paper,

232
0:11:36.042,000 --> 0:11:4,000
it's then an algorithm that decides which brand, price point

233
0:11:40.5,000 --> 0:11:43,000
or whether you go with recycled or not.

234
0:11:43.583,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Well, nowadays this is usually based on what you bought in the past,

235
0:11:47.833,000 --> 0:11:51,000
or whoever pays the most to the company behind the virtual assistant.

236
0:11:52.042,000 --> 0:11:56,000
But why shouldn't that be also based on your values?

237
0:11:57.625,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Knowing that you want to buy planet-friendly

238
0:12:00.208,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and knowing whether and how much you're willing and able to pay for that.

239
0:12:05.708,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Now, that will make it easy and seamless,

240
0:12:09.25,000 --> 0:12:11,000
but still based on granular effects and data

241
0:12:11.542,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to choose the right products.

242
0:12:13.625,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Not by necessarily doing it yourself

243
0:12:15.875,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but by asking an algorithm

244
0:12:18.208,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that knows how much you care about this planet.

245
0:12:21.792,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Not by necessarily doing it yourself

246
0:12:23.792,000 --> 0:12:25,000
but by asking an algorithm

247
0:12:25.917,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that is never time-poor or distracted,

248
0:12:29.792,000 --> 0:12:32,000
or with short attention span because of the cute date,

249
0:12:33.625,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and that knows how much you care about this planet

250
0:12:36.375,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and the people living on it,

251
0:12:37.833,000 --> 0:12:4,000
by asking that algorithm to look at all of that information for you

252
0:12:41.708,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and to decide for you.

253
0:12:44.5,000 --> 0:12:48,000
If we have reliable and trustworthy information like that

254
0:12:48.708,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and the right systems that make use of it,

255
0:12:51.208,000 --> 0:12:54,000
consumers will support those who are doing the right thing

256
0:12:54.583,000 --> 0:12:58,000
by producing products in a sustainable and ethical way.

257
0:12:58.708,000 --> 0:13:,000
They will support them every time

258
0:13:00.75,000 --> 0:13:02,000
by choosing their goods over others.

259
0:13:04.042,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And that means that good producers and processors and retailers

260
0:13:09,000 --> 0:13:1,000
will get rewarded.

261
0:13:10.292,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And bad actors will be forced to adjust their practices

262
0:13:14.667,000 --> 0:13:15,000
or get out of business.

263
0:13:17.333,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And we need that.

264
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:22,000
If we want to continue to live together on this beautiful planet,

265
0:13:22.792,000 --> 0:13:23,000
we really need it.

266
0:13:24.667,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Thank you.

267
0:13:25.958,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.713,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When we think of games, there's all kinds of things.

3
0:00:15.183,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Maybe you're ticked off, or maybe, you're looking forward to a new game.

4
0:00:18.592,000 --> 0:00:19,000
You've been up too late playing a game.

5
0:00:20.474,000 --> 0:00:21,000
All these things happen to me.

6
0:00:21.961,000 --> 0:00:22,000
But when we think about games,

7
0:00:23.42,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a lot of times we think about stuff like this:

8
0:00:25.614,000 --> 0:00:28,000
first-person shooters, or the big, what we would call AAA games,

9
0:00:28.669,000 --> 0:00:29,000
or maybe you're a Facebook game player.

10
0:00:30.567,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This is one my partner and I worked on.

11
0:00:32.466,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Maybe you play Facebook games, and that's what we're making right now.

12
0:00:35.793,000 --> 0:00:36,000
This is a lighter form of game.

13
0:00:37.319,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Maybe you think about the tragically boring board games

14
0:00:39.946,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that hold us hostage in Thanksgiving situations.

15
0:00:42.212,000 --> 0:00:45,000
This would be one of the tragically boring board games that you can figure out.

16
0:00:45.975,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Or maybe you're in your living room,

17
0:00:47.764,000 --> 0:00:48,000
playing with the Wii with the kids,

18
0:00:49.645,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and there's this whole range of games, and that's very much what I think about.

19
0:00:53.403,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I make my living from games, I've been lucky enough to do this

20
0:00:56.368,000 --> 0:00:59,000
since I was 15, which also qualifies as I've never really had a real job.

21
0:00:59.829,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But we think about games as fun, and that's completely reasonable,

22
0:01:03.731,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but let's just think about this.

23
0:01:05.369,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So this one here, this is the 1980 Olympics.

24
0:01:08.099,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Now I don't know where you guys were,

25
0:01:09.948,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but I was in my living room.

26
0:01:11.347,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It was practically a religious event.

27
0:01:13.173,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And this is when the Americans beat the Russians,

28
0:01:15.784,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and this was -- yes, it was technically a game.

29
0:01:18.047,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Hockey is a game.

30
0:01:19.398,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But really, was this a game?

31
0:01:21.168,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I mean, people cried.

32
0:01:22.931,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I've never seen my mother cry like that at the end of Monopoly.

33
0:01:26.296,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:27.462,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And so this was an amazing experience.

35
0:01:29.838,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Or, if anybody here is from Boston --

36
0:01:32.372,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So when the Boston Red Sox won the World Series

37
0:01:35.449,000 --> 0:01:37,000
after I believe, 351 years --

38
0:01:38.38,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:39.681,000 --> 0:01:41,000
when they won the World Series, it was amazing.

40
0:01:41.964,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I happened to be living in Springfield at the time,

41
0:01:44.386,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and the best part of it was,

42
0:01:46.405,000 --> 0:01:48,000
you would close the women's door in the bathroom,

43
0:01:49.042,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and I remember seeing "Go Sox," and I thought, really?

44
0:01:51.957,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Or the houses, you'd come out, because every game,

45
0:01:55.03,000 --> 0:01:57,000
well, I think almost every game, went into overtime, right?

46
0:01:57.838,000 --> 0:02:,000
So we'd be outside, and all the other lights are on in the whole block.

47
0:02:01.211,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And kids -- the attendance was down in school,

48
0:02:04.295,000 --> 0:02:07,000
kids weren't going to school, but it's OK, it's the Red Sox, right?

49
0:02:07.467,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I mean, there's education, and then there's the Red Sox,

50
0:02:10.138,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and we know where they're stacked.

51
0:02:11.927,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So this was an amazing experience,

52
0:02:13.772,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and again, yes, it was a game, but they didn't write newspaper articles,

53
0:02:17.285,000 --> 0:02:21,000
people didn't say, "You know, really, I can die now, because the Red Sox won."

54
0:02:21.628,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And many people did.

55
0:02:23.102,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So games, it means something more to us.

56
0:02:26.071,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It absolutely means something more.

57
0:02:27.964,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So now, this is an abrupt transition here.

58
0:02:30.237,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There was three years where I actually did have a real job, sort of.

59
0:02:33.563,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I was the head of a college department teaching games,

60
0:02:36.143,000 --> 0:02:37,000
so, again, it was sort of a real job,

61
0:02:37.942,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and now I got to talk about making them as opposed to making them.

62
0:02:41.603,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Part of the job of it, when you're a chair of a department,

63
0:02:44.899,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is to eat, and I did that very well --

64
0:02:46.733,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and so I'm out at a dinner with this guy called Zig Jackson.

65
0:02:49.598,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So this is Zig in this photograph, this is also one of Zig's photographs.

66
0:02:53.176,000 --> 0:02:54,000
He's a photographer.

67
0:02:54.361,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And he goes all around the country taking pictures of himself,

68
0:02:59.427,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and you can see here he's got Zig's Indian Reservation.

69
0:03:03.126,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And this particular shot --

70
0:03:04.67,000 --> 0:03:07,000
this is one of the more traditional shots.

71
0:03:07.819,000 --> 0:03:08,000
This is a rain dancer.

72
0:03:09.506,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And this is one of my favorite shots here.

73
0:03:11.628,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So you can look at this, and maybe you've even seen things like this.

74
0:03:14.907,000 --> 0:03:15,000
This is an expression of culture, right?

75
0:03:16.855,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And this is actually from his Degradation series.

76
0:03:19.424,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And what was most fascinating to me about this series

77
0:03:21.927,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is just, look at that little boy there, can you imagine?

78
0:03:24.583,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We can see that's a traditional Native American.

79
0:03:26.858,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Now I just want to change that guy's race.

80
0:03:28.92,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Just imagine if that's a black guy.

81
0:03:30.841,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So, "Honey, come here, let's get you a picture with the black guy." Right?

82
0:03:34.345,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Like, seriously, nobody would do this.

83
0:03:36.179,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It baffles the mind.

84
0:03:37.588,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And so Zig, being Indian, likewise it baffles his mind.

85
0:03:40.493,000 --> 0:03:41,000
His favorite photograph --

86
0:03:41.763,000 --> 0:03:43,000
my favorite photograph of his, which I don't have in here --

87
0:03:44.665,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is Indian taking picture of white people taking pictures of Indians.

88
0:03:47.928,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

89
0:03:49.462,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So I happen to be at dinner with this photographer,

90
0:03:51.881,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and he was talking with another photographer

91
0:03:53.956,000 --> 0:03:54,000
about a shooting that had occurred,

92
0:03:55.669,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and it was on an Indian Reservation.

93
0:03:57.413,000 --> 0:03:59,000
He'd taken his camera up there to photograph it,

94
0:03:59.693,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but when he got there, he discovered he couldn't do it.

95
0:04:02.297,000 --> 0:04:03,000
He just couldn't capture the picture.

96
0:04:04.103,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And so they were talking back and forth about this question.

97
0:04:07.022,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Do you take the picture or not?

98
0:04:08.964,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And that was fascinating to me as a game designer,

99
0:04:11.369,000 --> 0:04:12,000
because it never occurs to me,

100
0:04:12.824,000 --> 0:04:15,000
should I make the game about this difficult topic or not?

101
0:04:15.996,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Because we just make things that are fun

102
0:04:17.934,000 --> 0:04:2,000
or will make you feel fear, that visceral excitement.

103
0:04:21.439,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But every other medium does it.

104
0:04:23.42,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So this is my kid.

105
0:04:24.613,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This is Maezza, and when she was seven years old,

106
0:04:27.31,000 --> 0:04:28,000
she came home from school one day,

107
0:04:28.974,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and like I do every single day, I asked her, "What did you do today?"

108
0:04:32.252,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So she said, "We talked about the Middle Passage."

109
0:04:34.622,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now, this was a big moment. Maezza's dad is black,

110
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and I knew this day was coming.

111
0:04:39.623,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I wasn't expecting it at seven, I don't know why, but I wasn't.

112
0:04:42.763,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Anyways, so I asked her, "How do you feel about that?"

113
0:04:46.14,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So she proceeded to tell me,

114
0:04:47.721,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and so any of you who are parents will recognize the bingo buzzwords here.

115
0:04:51.254,000 --> 0:04:53,000
"The ships start in England, they come down from England,

116
0:04:53.951,000 --> 0:04:55,000
they go to Africa, they go across the ocean --

117
0:04:56.165,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that's the Middle Passage part --

118
0:04:57.834,000 --> 0:05:,000
they come to America, where the slaves are sold," she's telling me.

119
0:05:01.057,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But Abraham Lincoln was elected president,

120
0:05:03.089,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and then he passed the Emancipation Proclamation,

121
0:05:05.404,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and now they're free.

122
0:05:06.595,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Pause for about 10 seconds.

123
0:05:07.923,000 --> 0:05:08,000
"Can I play a game, Mommy?"

124
0:05:09.261,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And I thought, that's it? And so, you know,

125
0:05:11.373,000 --> 0:05:16,000
this is the Middle Passage, this is an incredibly significant event,

126
0:05:17.185,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and she's treating it like, basically some black people went on a cruise,

127
0:05:21.124,000 --> 0:05:23,000
this is more or less how it sounds to her.

128
0:05:23.156,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

129
0:05:24.337,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And so, to me, I wanted more value in this,

130
0:05:27.227,000 --> 0:05:3,000
so when she asked if she could play a game, I said, "Yes."

131
0:05:30.431,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:31.64,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And so I happened to have all of these little pieces.

133
0:05:34.145,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I'm a game designer, so I have this stuff sitting around my house.

134
0:05:37.268,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I said, "Yeah, you can play a game," and I give her a bunch of these,

135
0:05:40.545,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and I tell her to paint them in different families.

136
0:05:42.979,000 --> 0:05:44,000
These are pictures of Maezza when she was --

137
0:05:45.09,000 --> 0:05:46,000
God, it still chokes me up seeing these.

138
0:05:47.056,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So she's painting her little families.

139
0:05:48.905,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So then I grab a bunch of them and I put them on a boat.

140
0:05:51.565,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This was the boat, it was made quickly, obviously.

141
0:05:54.476,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And so the basic gist of it is, I grabbed a bunch of families,

142
0:05:57.441,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and she's like, "Mommy, but you forgot the pink baby

143
0:05:59.901,000 --> 0:06:,000
and you forgot the blue daddy

144
0:06:01.343,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and you forgot all these other things."

145
0:06:03.239,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And she says, "They want to go."

146
0:06:04.801,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And I said, "Honey, no, they don't want to go.

147
0:06:07.041,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This is the Middle Passage, Nobody wants to go on the Middle Passage."

148
0:06:10.37,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So she gave me a look that only a daughter of a game designer would give a mother,

149
0:06:14.276,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and as we're going across the ocean, following these rules,

150
0:06:17.072,000 --> 0:06:19,000
she realizes that she's rolling pretty high,

151
0:06:19.155,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and she says to me, "We're not going to make it."

152
0:06:21.468,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And she realizes, we don't have enough food,

153
0:06:23.609,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and so she asks what to do,

154
0:06:24.95,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and I say -- remember, she's seven --

155
0:06:27.704,000 --> 0:06:29,000
"We can either put some people in the water

156
0:06:29.764,000 --> 0:06:3,000
or we can hope that they don't get sick

157
0:06:31.659,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and we make it to the other side."

158
0:06:33.305,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Just the look on her face came over --

159
0:06:35.9,000 --> 0:06:37,000
now mind you this is after a month of --

160
0:06:38.551,000 --> 0:06:39,000
this is Black History Month, right?

161
0:06:40.254,000 --> 0:06:43,000
After a month, she says to me, "Did this really happen?"

162
0:06:44.2,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And I said, "Yes." And so she said --

163
0:06:47.01,000 --> 0:06:48,000
this is her brother and sister --

164
0:06:48.681,000 --> 0:06:5,000
"If I came out of the woods, Avalon and Donovan might be gone."

165
0:06:51.683,000 --> 0:06:52,000
"Yes."

166
0:06:52.874,000 --> 0:06:53,000
"But I'd get to see them in America."

167
0:06:54.706,000 --> 0:06:55,000
"No."

168
0:06:55.881,000 --> 0:06:57,000
"But what if I saw them? Couldn't we stay together?"

169
0:06:58.434,000 --> 0:06:59,000
"So Daddy could be gone."

170
0:06:59.709,000 --> 0:07:,000
"Yes."

171
0:07:00.891,000 --> 0:07:02,000
She was fascinated by this, and she started to cry,

172
0:07:03.352,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I started to cry, her father started to cry, and now we're all crying.

173
0:07:06.775,000 --> 0:07:09,000
He didn't expect to come home from work to the Middle Passage, but there it goes.

174
0:07:10.672,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And so, we made this game, and she got it.

175
0:07:12.789,000 --> 0:07:14,000
She got it because she spent time with these people.

176
0:07:15.369,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It wasn't abstract stuff in a brochure or in a movie.

177
0:07:18.638,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And so it was just an incredibly powerful experience.

178
0:07:21.73,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This is the game, which I've ended up calling "The New World,"

179
0:07:24.734,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because I like the phrase.

180
0:07:26.04,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I don't think the New World felt too new worldly exciting

181
0:07:28.848,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to the people who were brought over on slave ships.

182
0:07:31.303,000 --> 0:07:34,000
But when this happened, I saw the whole planet; I was so excited.

183
0:07:34.413,000 --> 0:07:36,000
I'd been making games for 20-some years,

184
0:07:36.823,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and then I decided to do it again.

185
0:07:38.846,000 --> 0:07:39,000
My history is Irish.

186
0:07:40.286,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So this is a game called "Síochán Leat." It's "peace be with you."

187
0:07:43.442,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It's the entire history of my family in a single game.

188
0:07:45.997,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I made another game called "Train."

189
0:07:48.52,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I was making a series of six games that covered difficult topics,

190
0:07:51.599,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and if you're going to cover a difficult topic, this is one you need to cover,

191
0:07:55.333,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and I'll let you figure out what that's about on your own.

192
0:07:58.085,000 --> 0:08:,000
And I also made a game about the Trail of Tears.

193
0:08:00.962,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This is a game with 50,000 individual pieces.

194
0:08:03.44,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I was crazy when I decided to start it, but I'm in the middle of it now.

195
0:08:06.848,000 --> 0:08:07,000
It's the same thing.

196
0:08:08.099,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I'm hoping that I'll teach culture through these games.

197
0:08:11.05,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And the one I'm working on right now, which is --

198
0:08:13.376,000 --> 0:08:14,000
because I'm right in the middle of it,

199
0:08:15.226,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and these for some reason choke me up like crazy --

200
0:08:17.716,000 --> 0:08:19,000
is a game called "Mexican Kitchen Workers."

201
0:08:19.795,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And originally, it was a math problem, more or less.

202
0:08:22.264,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Here's the economics of illegal immigration.

203
0:08:24.355,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And the more I learned about Mexican culture --

204
0:08:26.58,000 --> 0:08:28,000
my partner is Mexican — the more I learned that,

205
0:08:28.874,000 --> 0:08:3,000
you know, for all of us, food is a basic need,

206
0:08:31.228,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and it is obviously with Mexicans, too, but it's much more than that.

207
0:08:34.558,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It's an expression of love. It's an expression of --

208
0:08:37.012,000 --> 0:08:39,000
God, I'm totally choking up way more than I thought.

209
0:08:39.486,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I'll look away from the picture.

210
0:08:41.382,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It's an expression of beauty, it's how they say they love you.

211
0:08:44.702,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It's how they say they care,

212
0:08:46.078,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and you can't hear somebody talk about their Mexican grandmother

213
0:08:49.13,000 --> 0:08:51,000
without saying "food" in the first sentence.

214
0:08:51.987,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And so to me, this beautiful culture,

215
0:08:54.167,000 --> 0:08:58,000
this beautiful expression is something that I want to capture through games.

216
0:08:58.511,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And so games, for a change, it changes how we see topics,

217
0:09:02.036,000 --> 0:09:05,000
it changes our perceptions about those people in topics,

218
0:09:05.572,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and it changes ourselves.

219
0:09:07.318,000 --> 0:09:09,000
We change as people through games,

220
0:09:09.531,000 --> 0:09:11,000
because we're involved, and we're playing,

221
0:09:11.591,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and we're learning as we do so.

222
0:09:13.104,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Thank you.

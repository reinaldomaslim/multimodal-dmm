1
0:00:19.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So, can we dare to be optimistic?

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Well, the thesis of "The Bottom Billion"

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
is that a billion people have been stuck living

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in economies that have been stagnant for 40 years,

5
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and hence diverging from the rest of mankind.

6
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And so, the real question to pose is not, "Can we be optimistic?"

7
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
It's, "How can we give credible hope to that billion people?"

8
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
That, to my mind, is the fundamental challenge now of development.

9
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
What I'm going to offer you is a recipe,

10
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
a combination of the two forces that changed the world for good,

11
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
which is the alliance of compassion and enlightened self-interest.

12
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Compassion, because a billion people are living in societies

13
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that have not offered credible hope.

14
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
That is a human tragedy.

15
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Enlightened self-interest, because if that economic divergence

16
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
continues for another 40 years,

17
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
combined with social integration globally,

18
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
it will build a nightmare for our children.

19
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We need compassion to get ourselves started,

20
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and enlightened self-interest to get ourselves serious.

21
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
That's the alliance that changes the world.

22
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So, what does it mean to get serious about providing hope for the bottom billion?

23
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
What can we actually do?

24
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Well, a good guide is to think,

25
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
"What did we do last time the rich world got serious

26
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
about developing another region of the world?"

27
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
That gives us, it turns out, quite a good clue,

28
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
except you have to go back quite a long time.

29
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The last time the rich world got serious

30
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
about developing another region was in the late 1940s.

31
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The rich world was you, America,

32
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and the region that needed to be developed was my world, Europe.

33
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
That was post-War Europe.

34
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Why did America get serious?

35
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It wasn't just compassion for Europe, though there was that.

36
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It was that you knew you had to,

37
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
because, in the late 1940s, country after country in Central Europe

38
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
was falling into the Soviet bloc, and so you knew you'd no choice.

39
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Europe had to be dragged into economic development.

40
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So, what did you do, last time you got serious?

41
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Well, yes, you had a big aid program. Thank you very much.

42
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
That was Marshall aid: we need to do it again. Aid is part of the solution.

43
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But what else did you do?

44
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Well, you tore up your trade policy, and totally reversed it.

45
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Before the war, America had been highly protectionist.

46
0:03:32.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
After the war, you opened your markets to Europe,

47
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
you dragged Europe into the then-global economy, which was your economy,

48
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and you institutionalized that trade liberalization

49
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
through founding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

50
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So, total reversal of trade policy.

51
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Did you do anything else?

52
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Yes, you totally reversed your security policy.

53
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Before the war, your security policy had been isolationist.

54
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
After the war, you tear that up, you put 100,000 troops in Europe

55
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
for over 40 years.

56
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So, total reversal of security policy. Anything else?

57
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Yes, you tear up the "Eleventh Commandment" --

58
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
national sovereignty.

59
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Before the war, you treated national sovereignty as so sacrosanct

60
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that you weren't even willing to join the League of Nations.

61
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
After the war, you found the United Nations,

62
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
you found the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,

63
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
you found the IMF, you encouraged Europe to create the European Community --

64
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
all systems for mutual government support.

65
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
That is still the waterfront of effective policies:

66
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
aid, trade, security, governments.

67
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Of course, the details of policy are going to be different,

68
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because the challenge is different.

69
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It's not rebuilding Europe, it's reversing the divergence

70
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
for the bottom billion, so that they actually catch up.

71
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Is that easier or harder?

72
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We need to be at least as serious as we were then.

73
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now, today I'm going to take just one of those four.

74
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I'm going to take the one that sounds the weakest,

75
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the one that's just motherhood and apple pie --

76
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
governments, mutual systems of support for governments --

77
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and I'm going to show you one idea

78
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in how we could do something to strengthen governance,

79
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and I'm going to show you that that is enormously important now.

80
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The opportunity we're going to look to

81
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
is a genuine basis for optimism about the bottom billion,

82
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and that is the commodity booms.

83
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The commodity booms are pumping unprecedented amounts of money

84
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
into many, though not all, of the countries of the bottom billion.

85
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Partly, they're pumping money in because commodity prices are high,

86
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but it's not just that. There's also a range of new discoveries.

87
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Uganda has just discovered oil, in about the most disastrous location on Earth;

88
0:06:27.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Ghana has discovered oil;

89
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Guinea has got a huge new exploitation of iron ore coming out of the ground.

90
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So, a mass of new discoveries.

91
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Between them, these new revenue flows dwarf aid.

92
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Just to give you one example:

93
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Angola alone is getting 50 billion dollars a year in oil revenue.

94
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The entire aid flows to the 60 countries of the bottom billion last year were 34 billion.

95
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So, the flow of resources from the commodity booms

96
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to the bottom billion are without precedent.

97
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So there's the optimism.

98
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The question is, how is it going to help their development?

99
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It's a huge opportunity for transformational development.

100
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Will it be taken?

101
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So, here comes a bit of science, and this is a bit of science I've done

102
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
since "The Bottom Billion," so it's new.

103
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I've looked to see what is the relationship between

104
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
higher commodity prices of exports,

105
0:07:32.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and the growth of commodity-exporting countries.

106
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And I've looked globally, I've taken all the countries in the world

107
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
for the last 40 years,

108
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and looked to see what the relationship is.

109
0:07:42.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And the short run -- say, the first five to seven years -- is just great.

110
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
In fact, it's hunky dory: everything goes up.

111
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
You get more money because your terms of trade have improved,

112
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but also that drives up output across the board.

113
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So GDP goes up a lot -- fantastic! That's the short run.

114
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And how about the long run?

115
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Come back 15 years later.

116
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Well, the short run, it's hunky dory,

117
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but the long run, it's humpty dumpty.

118
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
You go up in the short run, but then most societies

119
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
historically have ended up worse than if they'd had no booms at all.

120
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
That is not a forecast about how commodity prices go;

121
0:08:32.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
it's a forecast of the consequences, the long-term consequences,

122
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
for growth of an increase in prices.

123
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So, what goes wrong? Why is there this "resource curse," as it's called?

124
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And again, I've looked at that, and it turns out

125
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that the critical issue is the level of governance,

126
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the initial level of economic governance,

127
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
when the resource booms accrue.

128
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
In fact, if you've got good enough governance,

129
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
there is no resource boom.

130
0:09:02.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
You go up in the short term, and then you go up even more in the long term.

131
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
That's Norway, the richest country in Europe. It's Australia. It's Canada.

132
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The resource curse is entirely confined to countries

133
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
below a threshold of governance.

134
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They still go up in the short run.

135
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
That's what we're seeing across the bottom billion at the moment.

136
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
The best growth rates they've had -- ever.

137
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And the question is whether the short run will persist.

138
0:09:32.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And with bad governance historically, over the last 40 years, it hasn't.

139
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
It's countries like Nigeria, which are worse off than if they'd never had oil.

140
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So, there's a threshold level above which you go up in the long term,

141
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and below which you go down.

142
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Just to benchmark that threshold,

143
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
it's about the governance level of Portugal in the mid 1980s.

144
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So, the question is, are the bottom billion above or below that threshold?

145
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Now, there's one big change since the commodity booms of the 1970s,

146
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and that is the spread of democracy.

147
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So I thought, well, maybe that is the thing

148
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
which has transformed governance in the bottom billion.

149
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Maybe we can be more optimistic because of the spread of democracy.

150
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So, I looked. Democracy does have significant effects --

151
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and unfortunately, they're adverse.

152
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Democracies make even more of a mess of these resource booms than autocracies.

153
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
At that stage I just wanted to abandon the research, but --

154
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

155
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
-- it turns out that democracy is a little bit more complicated than that.

156
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Because there are two distinct aspects of democracy:

157
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
there's electoral competition, which determines how you acquire power,

158
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and there are checks and balances, which determine how you use power.

159
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
It turns out that electoral competition is the thing

160
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that's doing the damage with democracy,

161
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:07,000
whereas strong checks and balances make resource booms good.

162
0:11:07.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And so, what the countries of the bottom billion need

163
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
is very strong checks and balances.

164
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
They haven't got them.

165
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
They got instant democracy in the 1990s:

166
0:11:17.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
elections without checks and balances.

167
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
How can we help improve governance and introduce checks and balances?

168
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
In all the societies of the bottom billion,

169
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
there are intense struggles to do just that.

170
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
The simple proposal is that we should have some international standards,

171
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
which will be voluntary, but which would spell out the key decision points

172
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that need to be taken in order

173
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to harness these resource revenues.

174
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
We know these international standards work

175
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
because we've already got one.

176
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It's called the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.

177
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
That is the very simple idea that governments should report

178
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to their citizens what revenues they have.

179
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
No sooner was it proposed

180
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
than reformers in Nigeria adopted it, pushed it and published the revenues in the paper.

181
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Nigerian newspapers circulations spiked.

182
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
People wanted to know what their government was getting

183
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in terms of revenue.

184
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
So, we know it works. What would the content be of these international standards?

185
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
I can't go through all of them, but I'll give you an example.

186
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
The first is how to take the resources out of the ground --

187
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:4,000
the economic processes, taking the resources out of the ground

188
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and putting assets on top of the ground.

189
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And the first step in that is selling the rights to resource extraction.

190
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
You know how rights to resource extraction are being sold at the moment,

191
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
how they've been sold over the last 40 years?

192
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
A company flies in, does a deal with a minister.

193
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And that's great for the company,

194
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and it's quite often great for the minister --

195
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Laughter)

196
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
-- and it's not great for their country.

197
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
There's a very simple institutional technology

198
0:13:07.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
which can transform that,

199
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and it's called verified auctions.

200
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
The public agency with the greatest expertise on Earth

201
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
is of course the treasury -- that is, the British Treasury.

202
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And the British Treasury decided that it would sell the rights

203
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
to third-generation mobile phones

204
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
by working out what those rights were worth.

205
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
They worked out they were worth two billion pounds.

206
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Just in time, a set of economists got there and said,

207
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
"Why not try an auction? It'll reveal the value."

208
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
It went for 20 billion pounds through auction.

209
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
If the British Treasury can be out by a factor of 10,

210
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
think what the ministry of finance in Sierra Leone is going to be like.

211
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Laughter)

212
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
When I put that to the President of Sierra Leone,

213
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
the next day he asked the World Bank to send him a team

214
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to give expertise on how to conduct auctions.

215
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
There are five such decision points;

216
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
each one needs an international standard.

217
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
If we could do it, we would change the world.

218
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
We would be helping the reformers in these societies,

219
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
who are struggling for change.

220
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
That's our modest role. We cannot change these societies,

221
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
but we can help the people in these societies

222
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
who are struggling and usually failing,

223
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
because the odds are so stacked against them.

224
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And yet, we've not got these rules.

225
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
If you think about it, the cost of promulgating international rules

226
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
is zilch -- nothing.

227
0:14:44.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Why on Earth are they not there?

228
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
I realized that the reason they're not there

229
0:14:52.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
is that until we have a critical mass of informed citizens in our own societies,

230
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
politicians will get away with gestures.

231
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
That unless we have an informed society,

232
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
what politicians do, especially in relation to Africa, is gestures:

233
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
things that look good, but don't work.

234
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
And so I realized we had to go through the business

235
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
of building an informed citizenry.

236
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
That's why I broke all the professional rules of conduct for an economist,

237
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and I wrote an economics book that you could read on a beach.

238
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
(Laughter).

239
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
However, I have to say, the process of communication

240
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
does not come naturally to me.

241
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
This is why I'm on this stage, but it's alarming.

242
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I grew up in a culture of self-effacement.

243
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
My wife showed me a blog comment on one of my last talks,

244
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and the blog comment said, "Collier is not charismatic --

245
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
(Laughter)

246
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
-- but his arguments are compelling."

247
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:13,000
(Laughter)

248
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
(Applause)

249
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
If you agree with that sentiment,

250
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and if you agree that we need a critical mass of informed citizenry,

251
0:16:29.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
you will realize that I need you.

252
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Please, become ambassadors.

253
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Thank you.

254
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
(Applause)

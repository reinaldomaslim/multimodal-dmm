1
0:00:12.917,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, I teach college students about inequality and race in education,

2
0:00:17.761,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I like to leave my office open to any of my students

3
0:00:20.85,000 --> 0:00:22,000
who might just want to see me to chat.

4
0:00:23.405,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And a few semesters ago,

5
0:00:24.976,000 --> 0:00:26,000
one of my more cheerful students, Mahari,

6
0:00:27.905,000 --> 0:00:28,000
actually came to see me

7
0:00:29.326,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and mentioned that he was feeling a bit like an outcast because he's black.

8
0:00:34.001,000 --> 0:00:36,000
He had just transferred to NYU from a community college

9
0:00:36.898,000 --> 0:00:37,000
on a merit scholarship,

10
0:00:38.684,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and turns out,

11
0:00:40.542,000 --> 0:00:43,000
only about five percent of students at NYU are black.

12
0:00:43.848,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And so I started to remember

13
0:00:45.301,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that I know that feeling of being an outsider

14
0:00:47.854,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in your own community.

15
0:00:49.558,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It's partially what drew me to my work.

16
0:00:51.801,000 --> 0:00:52,000
At my university,

17
0:00:53.056,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I'm one of the few faculty members of color,

18
0:00:55.477,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and growing up, I experienced my family's social mobility,

19
0:00:59.326,000 --> 0:01:02,000
moving out of apartments into a nice house,

20
0:01:02.573,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but in an overwhelmingly white neighborhood.

21
0:01:05.293,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I was 12,

22
0:01:06.467,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and kids would say that were surprised that I didn't smell like curry.

23
0:01:10.443,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:11.69,000 --> 0:01:12,000
That's because school is in the morning,

25
0:01:13.659,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and I had Eggo waffles for breakfast.

26
0:01:15.555,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:17.184,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Curry is for dinner.

28
0:01:18.437,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:20.412,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So when Mahari was leaving,

30
0:01:21.817,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I asked him how he was coping with feeling isolated.

31
0:01:24.833,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And he said that despite feeling lonely,

32
0:01:27.082,000 --> 0:01:29,000
he just threw himself at his work,

33
0:01:29.182,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that he built strategies around his grit

34
0:01:31.659,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and his desire to be successful.

35
0:01:33.945,000 --> 0:01:35,000
A mentor of mine is actually Dr. Angela Duckworth,

36
0:01:36.874,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the psychologist at UPenn who has defined this stick-to-itiveness of grit

37
0:01:41.765,000 --> 0:01:44,000
as being "the perseverance and passion for long-term goals."

38
0:01:45.469,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Angela's book has become a bestseller,

39
0:01:47.67,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and schools across the country,

40
0:01:49.705,000 --> 0:01:5,000
particularly charter schools,

41
0:01:51.444,000 --> 0:01:54,000
have become interested in citing "grit" as a core value.

42
0:01:55.32,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But sometimes grit isn't enough,

43
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
especially in education.

44
0:01:59.254,000 --> 0:02:,000
So when Mahari was leaving my office,

45
0:02:01.146,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I worried that he might need something more specific

46
0:02:03.848,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to combat the challenges that he mentioned to me.

47
0:02:06.76,000 --> 0:02:09,000
As a sociologist, I also study achievement,

48
0:02:10.053,000 --> 0:02:12,000
but from a slightly different perspective.

49
0:02:12.256,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I research students who have overcome immense obstacles

50
0:02:15.453,000 --> 0:02:16,000
related to their background.

51
0:02:17.101,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Students from low-income,

52
0:02:18.757,000 --> 0:02:2,000
often single-parent households,

53
0:02:20.818,000 --> 0:02:24,000
students who have been homeless, incarcerated or perhaps undocumented,

54
0:02:25.679,000 --> 0:02:27,000
or some who have struggled with substance abuse

55
0:02:28.132,000 --> 0:02:3,000
or lived through violent or sexual trauma.

56
0:02:31.319,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So let me tell you about two of the grittiest people I've met.

57
0:02:35.077,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Tyrique was raised by a single mother,

58
0:02:37.775,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and then after high school, he fell in with the wrong crowd.

59
0:02:40.653,000 --> 0:02:41,000
He got arrested for armed robbery.

60
0:02:42.569,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But in prison, he started to work hard.

61
0:02:45.051,000 --> 0:02:46,000
He took college credit courses,

62
0:02:46.901,000 --> 0:02:48,000
so when he got out, he was able to get a master's,

63
0:02:49.571,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and today he's a manager at a nonprofit.

64
0:02:52.782,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Vanessa had to move around a lot as a kid,

65
0:02:55.486,000 --> 0:02:58,000
from the Lower East Side to Staten Island to the Bronx.

66
0:02:58.877,000 --> 0:03:,000
She was raised primarily by her extended family,

67
0:03:01.872,000 --> 0:03:03,000
because her own mother had a heroin addiction.

68
0:03:04.812,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Yet at 15,

69
0:03:05.986,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Vanessa had to drop out of school,

70
0:03:07.63,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and she had a son of her own.

71
0:03:09.313,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But eventually, she was able to go to community college,

72
0:03:12.827,000 --> 0:03:13,000
get her associate's,

73
0:03:14.346,000 --> 0:03:17,000
then go to an elite college to finish her bachelor's.

74
0:03:18.261,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So some people might hear these stories and say,

75
0:03:20.809,000 --> 0:03:22,000
"Yes, those two definitely have grit.

76
0:03:22.842,000 --> 0:03:24,000
They basically pulled themselves up by the bootstraps."

77
0:03:26.05,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But that's an incomplete picture,

78
0:03:28.512,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because what's more important

79
0:03:30.057,000 --> 0:03:34,000
is that they had factors in their lives that helped to influence their agency,

80
0:03:34.182,000 --> 0:03:35,000
or their specific capacity

81
0:03:35.882,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to actually overcome the obstacles that they were facing

82
0:03:39.47,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and navigate the system given their circumstances.

83
0:03:43.176,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So, allow me to elaborate.

84
0:03:44.965,000 --> 0:03:47,000
In prison, Tyrique was actually aimless at first,

85
0:03:48.322,000 --> 0:03:5,000
as a 22-year-old on Rikers Island.

86
0:03:50.917,000 --> 0:03:53,000
This is until an older detainee took him aside

87
0:03:54.243,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and asked him to help with the youth program.

88
0:03:56.808,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And in mentoring youth,

89
0:03:58.275,000 --> 0:04:01,000
he started to see his own mistakes and possibilities in the teens.

90
0:04:02.365,000 --> 0:04:05,000
This is what got him interested in taking college-credit courses.

91
0:04:05.963,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And when he got out,

92
0:04:07.167,000 --> 0:04:09,000
he got a job with Fortune Society,

93
0:04:09.405,000 --> 0:04:12,000
where many executives are people who have been formerly incarcerated.

94
0:04:13.543,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So then he was able to get a master's in social work,

95
0:04:16.234,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and today, he even lectures at Columbia about prison reform.

96
0:04:21.057,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And Vanessa ...

97
0:04:22.573,000 --> 0:04:24,000
well, after the birth of her son,

98
0:04:24.661,000 --> 0:04:27,000
she happened to find a program called Vocational Foundation

99
0:04:27.965,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that gave her 20 dollars biweekly,

100
0:04:30.005,000 --> 0:04:31,000
a MetroCard

101
0:04:31.187,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and her first experiences with a computer.

102
0:04:33.397,000 --> 0:04:36,000
These simple resources are what helped her get her GED,

103
0:04:36.765,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but then she suffered from a very serious kidney failure,

104
0:04:39.644,000 --> 0:04:43,000
which was particularly problematic because she was only born with one kidney.

105
0:04:43.732,000 --> 0:04:47,000
She spent 10 years on dialysis waiting for a successful transplant.

106
0:04:48.423,000 --> 0:04:49,000
After that,

107
0:04:49.752,000 --> 0:04:51,000
her mentors at community college had kept in touch with her,

108
0:04:52.598,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and so she was able to go,

109
0:04:54.259,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and they put her in an honors program.

110
0:04:56.382,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And that's the pathway that allowed her to become accepted

111
0:04:59.147,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to one of the most elite colleges for women in the country,

112
0:05:02.51,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and she received her bachelor's at 36,

113
0:05:05.011,000 --> 0:05:07,000
setting an incredible example for her young son.

114
0:05:08.782,000 --> 0:05:12,000
What these stories primarily indicate is that teaching is social

115
0:05:12.995,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and benefits from social scaffolding.

116
0:05:15.384,000 --> 0:05:17,000
There were factors pushing these two in one direction,

117
0:05:18.218,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but through tailored mentorship and opportunities,

118
0:05:21.091,000 --> 0:05:23,000
they were able to reflect on their circumstances

119
0:05:23.639,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and resist negative influences.

120
0:05:26.175,000 --> 0:05:29,000
They also learned simple skills like developing a network,

121
0:05:29.709,000 --> 0:05:3,000
or asking for help --

122
0:05:31.374,000 --> 0:05:35,000
things many of us in this room can forget that we have needed from time to time,

123
0:05:36.202,000 --> 0:05:37,000
or can take for granted.

124
0:05:38.251,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And when we think of people like this,

125
0:05:40.107,000 --> 0:05:44,000
we should only think of them as exceptional, but not as exceptions.

126
0:05:44.652,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Thinking of them as exceptions absolves us

127
0:05:47.501,000 --> 0:05:51,000
of the collective responsibility to help students in similar situations.

128
0:05:52.274,000 --> 0:05:55,000
When Presidents Bush, Obama and now even Trump,

129
0:05:55.902,000 --> 0:05:58,000
have called education "the civil rights issue of our time,"

130
0:05:59.624,000 --> 0:06:,000
perhaps we should treat it that way.

131
0:06:02.119,000 --> 0:06:05,000
If schools were able to think about the agency that their students have

132
0:06:05.855,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and bring to the table when they push them,

133
0:06:08.372,000 --> 0:06:1,000
what students learn can become more relevant to their lives,

134
0:06:11.395,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and then they can tap into those internal reservoirs of grit and character.

135
0:06:17.09,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So this here --

136
0:06:18.653,000 --> 0:06:19,000
My student Mahari

137
0:06:20.392,000 --> 0:06:23,000
got accepted to law school with scholarships,

138
0:06:23.641,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and not to brag,

139
0:06:25.181,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but I did write one of his letters of recommendation.

140
0:06:27.728,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:29.34,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And even though I know hard work is what got him this achievement,

142
0:06:33.322,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I've seen him find his voice along the way,

143
0:06:35.453,000 --> 0:06:38,000
which as someone who's grown up a little bit shy and awkward,

144
0:06:39.318,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I know it takes time and support.

145
0:06:41.655,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So even though he will rely a lot on his grit

146
0:06:44.814,000 --> 0:06:47,000
to get him through that first-year law school grind,

147
0:06:48.013,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I'll be there as a mentor for him,

148
0:06:50.442,000 --> 0:06:52,000
check in with him from time to time,

149
0:06:52.498,000 --> 0:06:53,000
maybe take him out to get some curry ...

150
0:06:54.506,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Laughter)

151
0:06:55.617,000 --> 0:06:58,000
so that he can keep growing his agency to succeed even more.

152
0:06:59.392,000 --> 0:07:,000
Thank you.

153
0:07:00.567,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Applause)

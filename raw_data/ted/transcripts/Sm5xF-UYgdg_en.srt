1
0:00:12.663,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hans Rosling: I'm going to ask you

2
0:00:15.066,000 --> 0:00:16,000
three multiple choice questions.

3
0:00:16.391,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Use this device. Use this device to answer.

4
0:00:20.122,000 --> 0:00:22,000
The first question is, how did the number

5
0:00:22.677,000 --> 0:00:24,000
of deaths per year

6
0:00:24.798,000 --> 0:00:25,000
from natural disaster,

7
0:00:26.09,000 --> 0:00:28,000
how did that change during the last century?

8
0:00:28.691,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Did it more than double,

9
0:00:30.07,000 --> 0:00:32,000
did it remain about the same in the world as a whole,

10
0:00:32.852,000 --> 0:00:34,000
or did it decrease to less than half?

11
0:00:35.226,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Please answer A, B or C.

12
0:00:37.63,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I see lots of answers. This is much faster than I do it at universities.

13
0:00:41.73,000 --> 0:00:44,000
They are so slow. They keep thinking, thinking, thinking.

14
0:00:44.887,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Oh, very, very good.

15
0:00:46.909,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And we go to the next question.

16
0:00:48.772,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So how long did women 30 years old

17
0:00:51.431,000 --> 0:00:53,000
in the world go to school:

18
0:00:53.527,000 --> 0:00:55,000
seven years, five years or three years?

19
0:00:55.561,000 --> 0:01:01,000
A, B or C? Please answer.

20
0:01:02.064,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And we go to the next question.

21
0:01:04.102,000 --> 0:01:07,000
In the last 20 years, how did the percentage

22
0:01:08.023,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of people in the world

23
0:01:09.85,000 --> 0:01:11,000
who live in extreme poverty change?

24
0:01:12.067,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Extreme poverty — not having enough food for the day.

25
0:01:14.628,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Did it almost double,

26
0:01:16.689,000 --> 0:01:17,000
did it remain more or less the same,

27
0:01:18.238,000 --> 0:01:19,000
or did it halve?

28
0:01:19.751,000 --> 0:01:23,000
A, B or C?

29
0:01:23.771,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now, answers.

30
0:01:26.927,000 --> 0:01:27,000
You see,

31
0:01:28.021,000 --> 0:01:29,000
deaths from natural disasters in the world,

32
0:01:29.746,000 --> 0:01:3,000
you can see it from this graph here,

33
0:01:31.668,000 --> 0:01:33,000
from 1900 to 2000.

34
0:01:34.448,000 --> 0:01:37,000
In 1900, there was about half a million people

35
0:01:37.703,000 --> 0:01:39,000
who died every year from natural disasters:

36
0:01:39.79,000 --> 0:01:44,000
floods, earthquakes, volcanic eruption, whatever, droughts.

37
0:01:44.887,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And then, how did that change?

38
0:01:47.607,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Gapminder asked the public in Sweden.

39
0:01:51.093,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This is how they answered.

40
0:01:52.952,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The Swedish public answered like this:

41
0:01:54.881,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Fifty percent thought it had doubled,

42
0:01:56.353,000 --> 0:01:58,000
38 percent said it's more or less the same,

43
0:01:58.558,000 --> 0:02:,000
12 said it had halved.

44
0:02:00.656,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This is the best data from the disaster researchers,

45
0:02:03.308,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and it goes up and down,

46
0:02:06.274,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and it goes to the Second World War,

47
0:02:08.826,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and after that it starts to fall and it keeps falling

48
0:02:12.226,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and it's down to much less than half.

49
0:02:14.072,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The world has been much, much more capable

50
0:02:16.68,000 --> 0:02:17,000
as the decades go by

51
0:02:18.294,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to protect people from this, you know.

52
0:02:20.685,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So only 12 percent of the Swedes know this.

53
0:02:23.551,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So I went to the zoo and I asked the chimps.

54
0:02:26.042,000 --> 0:02:35,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

55
0:02:39.458,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The chimps don't watch the evening news,

56
0:02:43.257,000 --> 0:02:44,000
so the chimps,

57
0:02:44.715,000 --> 0:02:47,000
they choose by random, so the Swedes answer worse than random.

58
0:02:48.147,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now how did you do?

59
0:02:51.086,000 --> 0:02:53,000
That's you.

60
0:02:54.048,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You were beaten by the chimps.

61
0:02:56.273,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

62
0:02:58.063,000 --> 0:03:,000
But it was close.

63
0:03:01.038,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You were three times better than the Swedes,

64
0:03:05.059,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but that's not enough.

65
0:03:06.302,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You shouldn't compare yourself to Swedes.

66
0:03:08.884,000 --> 0:03:11,000
You must have higher ambitions in the world.

67
0:03:12.415,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Let's look at the next answer here: women in school.

68
0:03:15.823,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Here, you can see men went eight years.

69
0:03:17.839,000 --> 0:03:18,000
How long did women go to school?

70
0:03:19.62,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Well, we asked the Swedes like this,

71
0:03:22.369,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and that gives you a hint, doesn't it?

72
0:03:24.586,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The right answer is probably the one

73
0:03:26.948,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the fewest Swedes picked, isn't it?

74
0:03:29.683,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:31.186,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Let's see, let's see. Here we come.

76
0:03:33.624,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Yes, yes, yes, women have almost caught up.

77
0:03:38.025,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This is the U.S. public.

78
0:03:41.438,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And this is you. Here you come.

79
0:03:45.313,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Ooh.

80
0:03:49.325,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Well, congratulations, you're twice as good as the Swedes,

81
0:03:51.154,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but you don't need me —

82
0:03:53.574,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So how come? I think it's like this,

83
0:03:58.388,000 --> 0:04:,000
that everyone is aware that there are countries

84
0:04:01.11,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and there are areas

85
0:04:02.214,000 --> 0:04:04,000
where girls have great difficulties.

86
0:04:04.352,000 --> 0:04:05,000
They are stopped when they go to school,

87
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and it's disgusting.

88
0:04:08.325,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But in the majority of the world,

89
0:04:10.222,000 --> 0:04:11,000
where most people in the world live,

90
0:04:11.909,000 --> 0:04:13,000
most countries, girls today go to school

91
0:04:14.891,000 --> 0:04:16,000
as long as boys, more or less.

92
0:04:17.43,000 --> 0:04:19,000
That doesn't mean that gender equity is achieved,

93
0:04:19.489,000 --> 0:04:21,000
not at all.

94
0:04:21.573,000 --> 0:04:25,000
They still are confined to terrible, terrible limitations,

95
0:04:26.114,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but schooling is there in the world today.

96
0:04:28.346,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Now, we miss the majority.

97
0:04:32.441,000 --> 0:04:35,000
When you answer, you answer according to the worst places,

98
0:04:35.764,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and there you are right, but you miss the majority.

99
0:04:38.62,000 --> 0:04:39,000
What about poverty?

100
0:04:40.096,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Well, it's very clear that poverty here

101
0:04:42.999,000 --> 0:04:43,000
was almost halved,

102
0:04:44.774,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and in U.S., when we asked the public,

103
0:04:46.453,000 --> 0:04:49,000
only five percent got it right.

104
0:04:50.437,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And you?

105
0:04:53.306,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Ah, you almost made it to the chimps.

106
0:04:57.164,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

107
0:04:59.525,000 --> 0:05:04,000
That little, just a few of you!

108
0:05:05.142,000 --> 0:05:08,000
There must be preconceived ideas, you know.

109
0:05:08.821,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And many in the rich countries,

110
0:05:10.615,000 --> 0:05:13,000
they think that oh, we can never end extreme poverty.

111
0:05:14.275,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Of course they think so,

112
0:05:15.928,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because they don't even know what has happened.

113
0:05:18.892,000 --> 0:05:2,000
The first thing to think about the future

114
0:05:21.242,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is to know about the present.

115
0:05:23.263,000 --> 0:05:26,000
These questions were a few of the first ones

116
0:05:26.315,000 --> 0:05:29,000
in the pilot phase of the Ignorance Project

117
0:05:29.7,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in Gapminder Foundation that we run,

118
0:05:32.72,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and it was started, this project, last year

119
0:05:35.516,000 --> 0:05:39,000
by my boss, and also my son, Ola Rosling. (Laughter)

120
0:05:39.922,000 --> 0:05:4,000
He's cofounder and director,

121
0:05:41.504,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and he wanted, Ola told me

122
0:05:43.048,000 --> 0:05:45,000
we have to be more systematic

123
0:05:45.608,000 --> 0:05:46,000
when we fight devastating ignorance.

124
0:05:47.481,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So already the pilots reveal this,

125
0:05:49.699,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that so many in the public score worse than random,

126
0:05:52.909,000 --> 0:05:54,000
so we have to think about preconceived ideas,

127
0:05:54.992,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and one of the main preconceived ideas

128
0:05:57.02,000 --> 0:05:58,000
is about world income distribution.

129
0:05:58.889,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Look here. This is how it was in 1975.

130
0:06:02.72,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It's the number of people on each income,

131
0:06:05.939,000 --> 0:06:07,000
from one dollar a day —

132
0:06:08.83,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Applause)

133
0:06:11.281,000 --> 0:06:13,000
See, there was one hump here,

134
0:06:13.356,000 --> 0:06:14,000
around one dollar a day,

135
0:06:15.254,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and then there was one hump here

136
0:06:16.71,000 --> 0:06:18,000
somewhere between 10 and 100 dollars.

137
0:06:18.725,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The world was two groups.

138
0:06:20.471,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It was a camel world, like a camel with two humps,

139
0:06:24.081,000 --> 0:06:26,000
the poor ones and the rich ones,

140
0:06:26.093,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and there were fewer in between.

141
0:06:27.657,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But look how this has changed:

142
0:06:29.826,000 --> 0:06:3,000
As I go forward, what has changed,

143
0:06:31.652,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the world population has grown,

144
0:06:33.308,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and the humps start to merge.

145
0:06:36.076,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The lower humps merged with the upper hump,

146
0:06:38.846,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and the camel dies and we have a dromedary world

147
0:06:41.973,000 --> 0:06:43,000
with one hump only.

148
0:06:44.228,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The percent in poverty has decreased.

149
0:06:46.152,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Still it's appalling

150
0:06:47.729,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that so many remain in extreme poverty.

151
0:06:50.93,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We still have this group, almost a billion, over there,

152
0:06:53.953,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but that can be ended now.

153
0:06:57.002,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The challenge we have now

154
0:06:59.305,000 --> 0:07:01,000
is to get away from that, understand where the majority is,

155
0:07:02.113,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and that is very clearly shown in this question.

156
0:07:05.357,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We asked, what is the percentage of the world's

157
0:07:07.59,000 --> 0:07:08,000
one-year-old children who have got those

158
0:07:09.244,000 --> 0:07:11,000
basic vaccines against measles and other things

159
0:07:11.854,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that we have had for many years:

160
0:07:13.347,000 --> 0:07:15,000
20, 50 or 80 percent?

161
0:07:15.369,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Now, this is what the U.S. public and the Swedish answered.

162
0:07:19.442,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Look at the Swedish result:

163
0:07:20.318,000 --> 0:07:22,000
you know what the right answer is.

164
0:07:22.38,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Laughter)

165
0:07:26.053,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Who the heck is a professor of global health in that country?

166
0:07:29.556,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Well, it's me. It's me.

167
0:07:31.228,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:33.19,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's very difficult, this. It's very difficult.

169
0:07:35.672,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Applause)

170
0:07:38.77,000 --> 0:07:41,000
However, Ola's approach

171
0:07:42.484,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to really measure what we know made headlines,

172
0:07:45.642,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and CNN published these results on their web

173
0:07:48.705,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and they had the questions there, millions answered,

174
0:07:50.852,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and I think there were about 2,000 comments,

175
0:07:54.334,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and this was one of the comments.

176
0:07:56.647,000 --> 0:07:59,000
"I bet no member of the media passed the test," he said.

177
0:08:00.191,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So Ola told me, "Take these devices.

178
0:08:02.83,000 --> 0:08:03,000
You are invited to media conferences.

179
0:08:04.535,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Give it to them and measure what the media know."

180
0:08:06.812,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And ladies and gentlemen,

181
0:08:08.736,000 --> 0:08:1,000
for the first time, the informal results

182
0:08:11.413,000 --> 0:08:14,000
from a conference with U.S. media.

183
0:08:15.338,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And then, lately, from the European Union media.

184
0:08:20.224,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:21.492,000 --> 0:08:23,000
You see, the problem is not that people

186
0:08:23.697,000 --> 0:08:24,000
don't read and listen to the media.

187
0:08:25.645,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The problem is that the media doesn't know themselves.

188
0:08:29.864,000 --> 0:08:3,000
What shall we do about this, Ola?

189
0:08:31.445,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Do we have any ideas?

190
0:08:32.943,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Applause)

191
0:08:44.037,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Ola Rosling: Yes, I have an idea, but first,

192
0:08:47.746,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I'm so sorry that you were beaten by the chimps.

193
0:08:51.561,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Fortunately, I will be able to comfort you

194
0:08:54.194,000 --> 0:08:58,000
by showing why it was not your fault, actually.

195
0:08:58.753,000 --> 0:09:,000
Then, I will equip you with some tricks

196
0:09:00.775,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for beating the chimps in the future.

197
0:09:02.865,000 --> 0:09:04,000
That's basically what I will do.

198
0:09:05.079,000 --> 0:09:07,000
But first, let's look at why are we so ignorant,

199
0:09:07.282,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and it all starts in this place.

200
0:09:09.889,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It's Hudiksvall. It's a city in northern Sweden.

201
0:09:13.579,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It's a neighborhood where I grew up,

202
0:09:17.376,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and it's a neighborhood with a large problem.

203
0:09:20.977,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Actually, it has exactly the same problem

204
0:09:22.963,000 --> 0:09:24,000
which existed in all the neighborhoods

205
0:09:25.572,000 --> 0:09:26,000
where you grew up as well.

206
0:09:26.92,000 --> 0:09:28,000
It was not representative. Okay?

207
0:09:29.582,000 --> 0:09:31,000
It gave me a very biased view

208
0:09:32.025,000 --> 0:09:34,000
of how life is on this planet.

209
0:09:34.373,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So this is the first piece of the ignorance puzzle.

210
0:09:37.365,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We have a personal bias.

211
0:09:38.637,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We have all different experiences

212
0:09:40.75,000 --> 0:09:41,000
from communities and people we meet,

213
0:09:42.39,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and on top of this, we start school,

214
0:09:45.377,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and we add the next problem.

215
0:09:47.298,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Well, I like schools,

216
0:09:48.442,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but teachers tend to teach outdated worldviews,

217
0:09:53.529,000 --> 0:09:55,000
because they learned something when they went to school,

218
0:09:56.13,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and now they describe this world to the students

219
0:09:58.683,000 --> 0:10:,000
without any bad intentions,

220
0:10:00.889,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and those books, of course, that are printed

221
0:10:03.118,000 --> 0:10:05,000
are outdated in a world that changes.

222
0:10:06.049,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And there is really no practice

223
0:10:07.296,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to keep the teaching material up to date.

224
0:10:10.545,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So that's what we are focusing on.

225
0:10:12.529,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So we have these outdated facts

226
0:10:14.098,000 --> 0:10:16,000
added on top of our personal bias.

227
0:10:17.032,000 --> 0:10:19,000
What happens next is news, okay?

228
0:10:19.508,000 --> 0:10:21,000
An excellent journalist knows how to pick

229
0:10:22.025,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the story that will make headlines,

230
0:10:24.431,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and people will read it because it's sensational.

231
0:10:27.03,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Unusual events are more interesting, no?

232
0:10:30.995,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And they are exaggerated,

233
0:10:32.71,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and especially things we're afraid of.

234
0:10:36.139,000 --> 0:10:38,000
A shark attack on a Swedish person

235
0:10:38.567,000 --> 0:10:41,000
will get headlines for weeks in Sweden.

236
0:10:42.282,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So these three skewed sources of information

237
0:10:46.001,000 --> 0:10:49,000
were really hard to get away from.

238
0:10:49.276,000 --> 0:10:5,000
They kind of bombard us

239
0:10:50.907,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and equip our mind with a lot of strange ideas,

240
0:10:54.713,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and on top of it we put the very thing

241
0:10:57.45,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that makes us humans, our human intuition.

242
0:11:02.716,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It was good in evolution.

243
0:11:04.892,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It helped us generalize

244
0:11:06.15,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and jump to conclusions very, very fast.

245
0:11:08.408,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It helped us exaggerate what we were afraid of,

246
0:11:12.376,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and we seek causality where there is none,

247
0:11:15.66,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and we then get an illusion of confidence

248
0:11:20.597,000 --> 0:11:23,000
where we believe that we are the best car drivers,

249
0:11:23.603,000 --> 0:11:24,000
above the average.

250
0:11:25.343,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Everybody answered that question,

251
0:11:26.705,000 --> 0:11:27,000
"Yeah, I drive cars better."

252
0:11:27.974,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Okay, this was good evolutionarily,

253
0:11:30.271,000 --> 0:11:31,000
but now when it comes to the worldview,

254
0:11:32.104,000 --> 0:11:34,000
it is the exact reason why it's upside down.

255
0:11:34.966,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The trends that are increasing are instead falling,

256
0:11:37.889,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and the other way around,

257
0:11:39.471,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and in this case, the chimps use our intuition against us,

258
0:11:43.471,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and it becomes our weakness instead of our strength.

259
0:11:46.911,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It was supposed to be our strength, wasn't it?

260
0:11:49.394,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So how do we solve such problems?

261
0:11:51.766,000 --> 0:11:52,000
First, we need to measure it,

262
0:11:53.441,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and then we need to cure it.

263
0:11:54.843,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So by measuring it we can understand

264
0:11:57.375,000 --> 0:11:59,000
what is the pattern of ignorance.

265
0:11:59.699,000 --> 0:12:,000
We started the pilot last year,

266
0:12:01.235,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and now we're pretty sure that we will encounter

267
0:12:03.704,000 --> 0:12:06,000
a lot of ignorance across the whole world,

268
0:12:07.285,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and the idea is really to

269
0:12:10.898,000 --> 0:12:11,000
scale it up to all domains

270
0:12:12.875,000 --> 0:12:14,000
or dimensions of global development,

271
0:12:15.423,000 --> 0:12:19,000
such as climate, endangered species, human rights,

272
0:12:19.505,000 --> 0:12:22,000
gender equality, energy, finance.

273
0:12:22.715,000 --> 0:12:24,000
All different sectors have facts,

274
0:12:25.448,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and there are organizations trying to spread

275
0:12:27.044,000 --> 0:12:28,000
awareness about these facts.

276
0:12:28.97,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So I've started actually contacting some of them,

277
0:12:32.674,000 --> 0:12:35,000
like WWF and Amnesty International and UNICEF,

278
0:12:36.015,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and asking them, what are your favorite facts

279
0:12:38.613,000 --> 0:12:39,000
which you think the public doesn't know?

280
0:12:40.506,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Okay, I gather those facts.

281
0:12:42.084,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Imagine a long list with, say, 250 facts.

282
0:12:45.619,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And then we poll the public

283
0:12:46.918,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and see where they score worst.

284
0:12:48.855,000 --> 0:12:49,000
So we get a shorter list

285
0:12:50.201,000 --> 0:12:51,000
with the terrible results,

286
0:12:51.257,000 --> 0:12:53,000
like some few examples from Hans,

287
0:12:53.806,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and we have no problem finding these kinds

288
0:12:55.723,000 --> 0:12:56,000
of terrible results.

289
0:12:56.938,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Okay, this little shortlist, what are we going to do with it?

290
0:12:59.783,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Well, we turn it into a knowledge certificate,

291
0:13:03.909,000 --> 0:13:04,000
a global knowledge certificate,

292
0:13:05.771,000 --> 0:13:07,000
which you can use, if you're a large organization,

293
0:13:08.674,000 --> 0:13:11,000
a school, a university, or maybe a news agency,

294
0:13:12.429,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to certify yourself as globally knowledgeable.

295
0:13:16.057,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Basically meaning, we don't hire people

296
0:13:19.02,000 --> 0:13:21,000
who score like chimpanzees.

297
0:13:21.29,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Of course you shouldn't.

298
0:13:23.65,000 --> 0:13:25,000
So maybe 10 years from now,

299
0:13:25.921,000 --> 0:13:26,000
if this project succeeds,

300
0:13:27.913,000 --> 0:13:29,000
you will be sitting in an interview

301
0:13:30.161,000 --> 0:13:34,000
having to fill out this crazy global knowledge.

302
0:13:34.367,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So now we come to the practical tricks.

303
0:13:37.73,000 --> 0:13:38,000
How are you going to succeed?

304
0:13:39.634,000 --> 0:13:42,000
There is, of course, one way,

305
0:13:43.213,000 --> 0:13:44,000
which is to sit down late nights

306
0:13:44.95,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and learn all the facts by heart

307
0:13:47.105,000 --> 0:13:48,000
by reading all these reports.

308
0:13:48.873,000 --> 0:13:5,000
That will never happen, actually.

309
0:13:50.885,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Not even Hans thinks that's going to happen.

310
0:13:53.594,000 --> 0:13:54,000
People don't have that time.

311
0:13:54.967,000 --> 0:13:57,000
People like shortcuts, and here are the shortcuts.

312
0:13:58.35,000 --> 0:14:,000
We need to turn our intuition into strength again.

313
0:14:01.124,000 --> 0:14:02,000
We need to be able to generalize.

314
0:14:02.568,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So now I'm going to show you some tricks

315
0:14:04.673,000 --> 0:14:06,000
where the misconceptions are turned around

316
0:14:07.223,000 --> 0:14:1,000
into rules of thumb.

317
0:14:10.431,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Let's start with the first misconception.

318
0:14:12.445,000 --> 0:14:13,000
This is very widespread.

319
0:14:14.082,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Everything is getting worse.

320
0:14:15.948,000 --> 0:14:18,000
You heard it. You thought it yourself.

321
0:14:19.218,000 --> 0:14:22,000
The other way to think is, most things improve.

322
0:14:22.247,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So you're sitting with a question in front of you

323
0:14:24.383,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and you're unsure. You should guess "improve."

324
0:14:27.616,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Okay? Don't go for the worse.

325
0:14:30.6,000 --> 0:14:32,000
That will help you score better on our tests.

326
0:14:32.963,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Applause)

327
0:14:34.179,000 --> 0:14:38,000
That was the first one.

328
0:14:38.405,000 --> 0:14:39,000
There are rich and poor

329
0:14:40.164,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and the gap is increasing.

330
0:14:41.63,000 --> 0:14:42,000
It's a terrible inequality.

331
0:14:43.285,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Yeah, it's an unequal world,

332
0:14:45.486,000 --> 0:14:47,000
but when you look at the data, it's one hump.

333
0:14:47.811,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Okay? If you feel unsure,

334
0:14:49.665,000 --> 0:14:51,000
go for "the most people are in the middle."

335
0:14:52.418,000 --> 0:14:53,000
That's going to help you get the answer right.

336
0:14:54.401,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Now, the next preconceived idea is

337
0:14:58.108,000 --> 0:15:01,000
first countries and people need to be very, very rich

338
0:15:01.733,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to get the social development

339
0:15:04.059,000 --> 0:15:07,000
like girls in school and be ready for natural disasters.

340
0:15:07.51,000 --> 0:15:08,000
No, no, no. That's wrong.

341
0:15:09.196,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Look: that huge hump in the middle

342
0:15:11.316,000 --> 0:15:13,000
already have girls in school.

343
0:15:13.759,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So if you are unsure, go for the

344
0:15:16.087,000 --> 0:15:17,000
"the majority already have this,"

345
0:15:17.482,000 --> 0:15:2,000
like electricity and girls in school, these kinds of things.

346
0:15:20.525,000 --> 0:15:22,000
They're only rules of thumb,

347
0:15:22.741,000 --> 0:15:24,000
so of course they don't apply to everything,

348
0:15:25.131,000 --> 0:15:26,000
but this is how you can generalize.

349
0:15:26.788,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Let's look at the last one.

350
0:15:28.753,000 --> 0:15:31,000
If something, yes, this is a good one,

351
0:15:32.054,000 --> 0:15:34,000
sharks are dangerous.

352
0:15:34.227,000 --> 0:15:38,000
No — well, yes, but they are not so important

353
0:15:38.626,000 --> 0:15:4,000
in the global statistics, that is what I'm saying.

354
0:15:41.602,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I actually, I'm very afraid of sharks.

355
0:15:44.133,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So as soon as I see a question about things I'm afraid of,

356
0:15:46.977,000 --> 0:15:48,000
which might be earthquakes, other religions,

357
0:15:49.91,000 --> 0:15:52,000
maybe I'm afraid of terrorists or sharks,

358
0:15:52.948,000 --> 0:15:53,000
anything that makes me feel,

359
0:15:54.107,000 --> 0:15:56,000
assume you're going to exaggerate the problem.

360
0:15:56.608,000 --> 0:15:57,000
That's a rule of thumb.

361
0:15:58.445,000 --> 0:16:,000
Of course there are dangerous things that are also great.

362
0:16:00.604,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Sharks kill very, very few. That's how you should think.

363
0:16:04.189,000 --> 0:16:07,000
With these four rules of thumb,

364
0:16:07.927,000 --> 0:16:1,000
you could probably answer better than the chimps,

365
0:16:11.287,000 --> 0:16:12,000
because the chimps cannot do this.

366
0:16:13.241,000 --> 0:16:15,000
They cannot generalize these kinds of rules.

367
0:16:15.844,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And hopefully we can turn your world around

368
0:16:19.856,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and we're going to beat the chimps. Okay?

369
0:16:22.691,000 --> 0:16:25,000
(Applause)

370
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
That's a systematic approach.

371
0:16:33.248,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Now the question, is this important?

372
0:16:35.812,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Yeah, it's important to understand poverty,

373
0:16:38.538,000 --> 0:16:41,000
extreme poverty and how to fight it,

374
0:16:41.785,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and how to bring girls in school.

375
0:16:43.83,000 --> 0:16:47,000
When we realize that actually it's succeeding, we can understand it.

376
0:16:48.17,000 --> 0:16:49,000
But is it important for everyone else

377
0:16:49.982,000 --> 0:16:51,000
who cares about the rich end of this scale?

378
0:16:52.436,000 --> 0:16:54,000
I would say yes, extremely important,

379
0:16:54.48,000 --> 0:16:55,000
for the same reason.

380
0:16:55.989,000 --> 0:16:58,000
If you have a fact-based worldview of today,

381
0:16:59.054,000 --> 0:17:,000
you might have a chance to understand

382
0:17:00.672,000 --> 0:17:01,000
what's coming next in the future.

383
0:17:02.426,000 --> 0:17:04,000
We're going back to these two humps in 1975.

384
0:17:04.864,000 --> 0:17:05,000
That's when I was born,

385
0:17:06.214,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and I selected the West.

386
0:17:09.233,000 --> 0:17:13,000
That's the current EU countries and North America.

387
0:17:13.416,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Let's now see how the rest and the West compares

388
0:17:16.799,000 --> 0:17:18,000
in terms of how rich you are.

389
0:17:18.88,000 --> 0:17:2,000
These are the people who can afford

390
0:17:21.131,000 --> 0:17:24,000
to fly abroad with an airplane for a vacation.

391
0:17:24.709,000 --> 0:17:27,000
In 1975, only 30 percent of them lived

392
0:17:28.017,000 --> 0:17:3,000
outside EU and North America.

393
0:17:30.984,000 --> 0:17:32,000
But this has changed, okay?

394
0:17:33.313,000 --> 0:17:37,000
So first, let's look at the change up till today, 2014.

395
0:17:38.056,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Today it's 50/50.

396
0:17:39.444,000 --> 0:17:42,000
The Western domination is over, as of today.

397
0:17:43.125,000 --> 0:17:45,000
That's nice. So what's going to happen next?

398
0:17:45.324,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Do you see the big hump? Did you see how it moved?

399
0:17:48.567,000 --> 0:17:54,000
I did a little experiment. I went to the IMF, International Monetary Fund, website.

400
0:17:54.598,000 --> 0:17:58,000
They have a forecast for the next five years of GDP per capita.

401
0:17:58.761,000 --> 0:18:01,000
So I can use that to go five years into the future,

402
0:18:01.778,000 --> 0:18:04,000
assuming the income inequality of each country is the same.

403
0:18:05.113,000 --> 0:18:06,000
I did that, but I went even further.

404
0:18:07.04,000 --> 0:18:1,000
I used those five years for the next 20 years

405
0:18:10.218,000 --> 0:18:15,000
with the same speed, just as an experiment what might actually happen.

406
0:18:15.495,000 --> 0:18:16,000
Let's move into the future.

407
0:18:16.862,000 --> 0:18:21,000
In 2020, it's 57 percent in the rest.

408
0:18:22.082,000 --> 0:18:25,000
In 2025, 63 percent.

409
0:18:25.118,000 --> 0:18:34,000
2030, 68. And in 2035, the West is outnumbered in the rich consumer market.

410
0:18:34.355,000 --> 0:18:37,000
These are just projections of GDP per capita into the future.

411
0:18:37.702,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Seventy-three percent of the rich consumers

412
0:18:40.057,000 --> 0:18:43,000
are going to live outside North America and Europe.

413
0:18:43.675,000 --> 0:18:47,000
So yes, I think it's a good idea for a company to use this certificate

414
0:18:47.873,000 --> 0:18:5,000
to make sure to make fact- based decisions in the future.

415
0:18:51.28,000 --> 0:18:52,000
Thank you very much.

416
0:18:52.756,000 --> 0:18:54,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
There are two groups of women

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
when it comes to screening mammography --

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
women in whom mammography works very well

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and has saved thousands of lives

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and women in whom it doesn't work well at all.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Do you know which group you're in?

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
If you don't, you're not alone.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Because the breast has become

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
a very political organ.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The truth has become lost

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in all the rhetoric

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
coming from the press, politicians,

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
radiologists

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and medical imaging companies.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I will do my best this morning

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to tell you what I think is the truth.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But first, my disclosures.

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I am not a breast cancer survivor.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I'm not a radiologist.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I don't have any patents,

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I've never received any money from a medical imaging company,

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and I am not seeking your vote.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
What I am

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is a doctor of internal medicine

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
who became passionately interested in this topic

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
about 10 years ago

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
when a patient asked me a question.

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
She came to see me

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
after discovering a breast lump.

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
in her 40s.

33
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
She and I were both very pregnant at that time,

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and my heart just ached for her,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
imagining how afraid she must be.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Fortunately, her lump proved to be benign.

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But she asked me a question:

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
how confident was I

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram

40
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
if she developed one?

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So I studied her mammogram,

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and I reviewed the radiology literature,

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and I was shocked to discover

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that, in her case,

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
were less than the toss of a coin.

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
You may recall a year ago

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
when a firestorm erupted

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
after the United States Preventive Services Task Force

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
reviewed the world's mammography screening literature

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and issued a guideline

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
recommending against screening mammograms

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in women in their 40s.

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force,

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
even though most of them weren't in anyway familiar

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
with the mammography studies.

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
It took the Senate just 17 days

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
to ban the use of the guidelines

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in determining insurance coverage.

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Radiologists were outraged

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
by the guidelines.

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
issued the following quote

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to the Washington Post.

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The radiologists were, in turn, criticized

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
for protecting their own financial self-interest.

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
But in my view,

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the radiologists are heroes.

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
There's a shortage of radiologists

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
qualified to read mammograms,

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and that's because mammograms are one of the most complex

72
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
of all radiology studies to interpret,

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and because radiologists

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
are sued more often

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
over missed breast cancer

76
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
than any other cause.

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But that very fact is telling.

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Where there is this much legal smoke,

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
there is likely to be some fire.

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The factor most responsible for that fire

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is breast density.

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat --

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
pictured here in yellow --

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
versus connective and epithelial tissues --

85
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
pictured in pink.

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And that proportion

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is primarily genetically determined.

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Two-thirds of women in their 40s

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
have dense breast tissue,

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which is why mammography doesn't work as well in them.

91
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And although breast density generally declines with age,

92
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
up to a third of women

93
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
retain dense breast tissue

94
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
for years after menopause.

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So how do you know if your breasts are dense?

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Well, you need to read the details

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
of your mammography report.

98
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Radiologists classify breast density

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
into four categories

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram.

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
If the breast is less than 25 percent dense,

102
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that's called fatty-replaced.

103
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The next category

104
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is scattered fibroglandular densities,

105
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
followed by heterogeneously dense

106
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and extremely dense.

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And breasts that fall into these two categories

108
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
are considered dense.

109
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The problem with breast density

110
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
is that it's truly the wolf in sheep's clothing.

111
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Both tumors and dense breast tissue

112
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
appear white on a mammogram,

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and the X-ray often can't distinguish between the two.

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So it's easy to see this tumor

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in the upper part of this fatty breast.

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But imagine how difficult it would be

117
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to find that tumor in this dense breast.

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
That's why mammograms find

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts,

120
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts.

121
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Now it's bad enough that breast density

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
makes it hard to find a cancer,

123
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but it turns out

124
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that it's also a powerful predictor

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
of your risk for breast cancer.

126
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It's a stronger risk factor

127
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer.

128
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
At the time my patient posed this question to me,

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
breast density was an obscure topic

130
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
in the radiology literature,

131
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and very few women having mammograms,

132
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
or the physicians ordering them,

133
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
knew about this.

134
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But what else could I offer her?

135
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Mammograms have been around since the 1960's,

136
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and it's changed very little.

137
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
There have been surprisingly few innovations,

138
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
until digital mammography was approved

139
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in 2000.

140
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast,

141
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but the images

142
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
can be stored and manipulated digitally,

143
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
just like we can with a digital camera.

144
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
The U.S. has invested

145
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
four billion dollars

146
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
converting to digital mammography equipment,

147
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and what have we gained from that investment?

148
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars,

149
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
digital mammography was found

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to be no better over all

151
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
than traditional mammography,

152
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and in fact, it was worse in older women.

153
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But it was better in one group,

154
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and that was women under 50

155
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts,

156
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and in those women,

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
digital mammography found twice as many cancers,

158
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but it still only found 60 percent.

159
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So digital mammography

160
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
has been a giant leap forward

161
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
for manufacturers

162
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
of digital mammography equipment,

163
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but it's been a very small step forward for

164
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
womankind.

165
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What about ultrasound?

166
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Ultrasound generates more biopsies

167
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that are unnecessary relative to other technologies,

168
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
so it's not widely used.

169
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors,

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but it's also very expensive.

171
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
If we think about disruptive technology,

172
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
we see an almost ubiquitous pattern

173
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
of the technology getting smaller and less expensive.

174
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Think about iPods compared to stereos.

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But it's the exact opposite in health care.

176
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The machines get ever bigger

177
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and ever more expensive.

178
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Screening the average young woman with an MRI

179
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer.

180
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's just way too much equipment.

181
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
One MRI scan

182
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs.

183
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And sooner or later, we're going to have to accept the fact

184
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that health care innovation

185
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
can't always come at a much higher price.

186
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker

187
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
on innovation,

188
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and he made the case that scientific discoveries

189
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
are rarely the product of one individual's genius.

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Rather, big ideas can be orchestrated,

191
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
if you can simply gather

192
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
people with different perspectives in a room

193
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and get them to talk about things

194
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that they don't ordinarily talk about.

195
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's like the essence of TED.

196
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
He quotes one innovator who says,

197
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
"The only time a physician and a physicist get together

198
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
is when the physicist gets sick."

199
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Laughter)

200
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
This makes no sense,

201
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
because physicians have all kinds of problems

202
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that they don't realize have solutions.

203
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things

204
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that they don't realize are problems.

205
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Now, take a look at this cartoon

206
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that accompanied Gladwell's article,

207
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and tell me if you see something disturbing

208
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
about this depiction of innovative thinkers.

209
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

210
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So if you will allow me a little creative license,

211
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I will tell you the story

212
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
of the serendipitous collision

213
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
of my patient's problem

214
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
with a physicist's solution.

215
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Shortly after her visit,

216
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I was introduced to a nuclear physicist

217
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
at Mayo

218
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
named Michael O'Conner,

219
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
who was a specialist in cardiac imaging,

220
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
something I had nothing to do with.

221
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And he happened to tell me

222
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
about a conference he'd just returned from in Israel,

223
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector.

224
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time

225
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
to image the heart,

226
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and it had even been tried to image the breast.

227
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But the problem was

228
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that the gamma detectors

229
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
were these huge, bulky tubes,

230
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and they were filled with these scintillating crystals,

231
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and you just couldn't get them close enough around the breast

232
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to find small tumors.

233
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But the potential advantage was

234
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that gamma rays, unlike X-rays,

235
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
are not influenced by breast density.

236
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But this technology

237
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
could not find tumors when they're small,

238
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and finding a small tumor is critical for survival.

239
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
If you can find a tumor

240
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
when it's less than a centimeter,

241
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
survival exceeds 90 percent,

242
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
but drops off rapidly

243
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
as tumor size increases.

244
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
But Michael told me about

245
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
a new type of gamma detector that he'd seen,

246
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and this is it.

247
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It's made

248
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
not of a bulky tube,

249
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material

250
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that serves as the gamma detector.

251
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And I started talking to him

252
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
about this problem with breast density,

253
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and we realized that we might be able to get this detector

254
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
close enough around the breast

255
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to actually find small tumors.

256
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So after putting together

257
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
a grid of these cubes with tape --

258
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Laughter)

259
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
-- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate

260
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
of a mammography machine

261
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that was about to be thrown out,

262
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and we attached the new detector,

263
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and we decided to call this machine

264
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Molecular Breast Imaging, or MBI.

265
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
This is an image from our first patient.

266
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And you can see, using the old gamma technology,

267
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that it just looked like noise.

268
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But using our new detector,

269
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
we could begin to see the outline of a tumor.

270
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So here we were, a nuclear physicist,

271
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
an internist,

272
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
soon joined by Carrie Hruska, a biomedical engineer,

273
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and two radiologists,

274
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and we were trying to take on

275
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the entrenched world of mammography

276
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
with a machine that was held together by duct tape.

277
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
To say that we faced

278
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
high doses of skepticism

279
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
in those early years

280
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
is just a huge understatement,

281
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work

282
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that we chipped away with incremental modifications

283
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to this system.

284
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
This is our current detector.

285
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And you can see that it looks a lot different.

286
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
The duct tape is gone,

287
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and we added a second detector on top of the breast,

288
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
which has further improved our tumor detection.

289
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So how does this work?

290
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer

291
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
that's taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells,

292
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but not by normal cells,

293
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and this is the key difference from mammography.

294
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Mammography relies on differences

295
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue,

296
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and we've seen that those differences

297
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
can be obscured in a dense breast.

298
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But MBI exploits

299
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
the different molecular behavior of tumors,

300
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and therefore, it's impervious to breast density.

301
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
After the injection,

302
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
the patient's breast is placed between the detectors.

303
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And if you've ever had a mammogram --

304
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
if you're old enough to have had a mammogram --

305
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
you know what comes next:

306
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
pain.

307
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
You may be surprised to know

308
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that mammography is the only radiologic study

309
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that's regulated by federal law,

310
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and the law requires

311
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery

312
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
come down on your breast during this study.

313
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
But with MBI,

314
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
we use just light, pain-free compression.

315
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Applause)

316
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And the detector

317
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
then transmits the image to the computer.

318
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
So here's an example.

319
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
You can see, on the right, a mammogram

320
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
showing a faint tumor,

321
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue.

322
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly,

323
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
as well as a second tumor,

324
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
which profoundly influence that patient's surgical options.

325
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
In this example, although the mammogram found one tumor,

326
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors --

327
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
one is small as three millimeters.

328
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Our big break came in 2004.

329
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors,

330
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
we used these images

331
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.

332
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And we were elated when they took a chance

333
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
on a team of completely unknown investigators

334
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and funded us to study

335
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
1,000 women with dense breasts,

336
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI.

337
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
Of the tumors that we found,

338
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
mammography found

339
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
only 25 percent of those tumors.

340
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
MBI found 83 percent.

341
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Here's an example from that screening study.

342
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
The digital mammogram was read as normal

343
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and shows lots of dense tissue,

344
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake,

345
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor.

346
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
In this case, a one-centimeter tumor.

347
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And in this case,

348
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo,

349
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young,

350
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
wanted to enroll in our study.

351
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue,

352
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
but her MBI showed an area

353
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
of worrisome uptake,

354
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
which we can also see on a color image.

355
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And this corresponded

356
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
to a tumor the size of a golf ball.

357
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
But fortunately it was removed

358
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
before it had spread to her lymph nodes.

359
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
So now that we knew that this technology

360
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
could find three times more tumors in a dense breast,

361
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
we had to solve one very important problem.

362
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose,

363
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and we have spent the last three years

364
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system

365
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to allow this.

366
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And I'm very happy to report that we're now using a dose of radiation

367
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
that is equivalent to the effective dose

368
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
from one digital mammogram.

369
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And at this low dose, we're continuing this screening study,

370
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and this image from three weeks ago

371
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
in a 67-year-old woman

372
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
shows a normal digital mammogram,

373
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
but an MBI image

374
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer.

375
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
So this is not just young women that it's benefiting.

376
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
It's also older women with dense tissue.

377
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And we're now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose

378
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
that's used in any other type of gamma technology.

379
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
MBI generates four images per breast.

380
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
MRI generates over a thousand.

381
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
It takes a radiologist

382
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
years of specialty training

383
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
to become expert in differentiating

384
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
the normal anatomic detail

385
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
from the worrisome finding.

386
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room

387
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
can find the tumor on the MBI image.

388
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
But this is why MBI

389
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
is so potentially disruptive --

390
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
it's as accurate as MRI,

391
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
it's far less complex to interpret,

392
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and it's a fraction of the cost.

393
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
But you can understand why there may be

394
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
forces in the breast-imaging world

395
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
who prefer the status quo.

396
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
After achieving what we felt were remarkable results,

397
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
our manuscript was rejected

398
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
by four journals.

399
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
After the fourth rejection,

400
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
we requested reconsideration of the manuscript,

401
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
because we strongly suspected

402
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
that one of the reviewers who had rejected it

403
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
had a financial conflict of interest

404
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
in a competing technology.

405
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Our manuscript was then accepted

406
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and will be published later this month

407
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
in the journal Radiology.

408
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
(Applause)

409
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose,

410
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and then our findings will need to be replicated

411
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
at other institutions,

412
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
and this could take five or more years.

413
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
If this technology is widely adopted,

414
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
I will not benefit financially in any way,

415
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
and that is very important to me,

416
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth.

417
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
But I recognize --

418
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
(Applause)

419
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
I recognize that the adoption of this technology

420
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
will depend as much on economic

421
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and political forces

422
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
as it will on the soundness of the science.

423
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
The MBI unit has now been FDA approved,

424
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
but it's not yet widely available.

425
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
So until something is available

426
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
for women with dense breasts,

427
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
there are things that you should know

428
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
to protect yourself.

429
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
First, know your density.

430
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Ninety percent of women don't,

431
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and 95 percent of women don't know

432
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
that it increases your breast cancer risk.

433
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
The State of Connecticut became the first and only state

434
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
to mandate that women receive notification

435
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
of their breast density

436
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
after a mammogram.

437
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging

438
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
last week in Chicago,

439
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and I was stunned that there was a heated debate

440
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
as to whether we should be telling women

441
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
what their breast density is.

442
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Of course we should.

443
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
And if you don't know, please ask your doctor

444
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
or read the details of your mammography report.

445
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
Second, if you're pre-menopausal,

446
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
try to schedule your mammogram

447
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle,

448
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
when breast density is relatively lower.

449
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
Third, if you notice a persistent change in your breast,

450
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
insist on additional imaging.

451
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
And fourth and most important,

452
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
the mammography debate will rage on,

453
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
but I do believe that all women 40 and older

454
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
should have an annual mammogram.

455
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
Mammography isn't perfect,

456
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
but it's the only test that's been proven

457
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
to reduce mortality from breast cancer.

458
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
But this mortality banner

459
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
is the very sword

460
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
which mammography's most ardent advocates use

461
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
to deter innovation.

462
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
Some women who develop breast cancer

463
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
die from it many years later,

464
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
and most women, thankfully, survive.

465
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
So it takes 10 or more years

466
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
for any screening method

467
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
to demonstrate a reduction

468
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
in mortality from breast cancer.

469
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
Mammography's the only one that's been around long enough

470
0:19:35.26,000 --> 0:19:38,000
to have a chance of making that claim.

471
0:19:38.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
It is time for us to accept

472
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
both the extraordinary successes of mammography

473
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
and the limitations.

474
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
We need to individualize screening

475
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:49,000
based on density.

476
0:19:49.26,000 --> 0:19:51,000
For women without dense breasts,

477
0:19:51.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
mammography is the best choice.

478
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:56,000
But for women with dense breasts;

479
0:19:56.26,000 --> 0:19:58,000
we shouldn't abandon screening altogether,

480
0:19:58.26,000 --> 0:20:01,000
we need to offer them something better.

481
0:20:03.26,000 --> 0:20:05,000
The babies that we were carrying

482
0:20:05.26,000 --> 0:20:08,000
when my patient first asked me this question

483
0:20:08.26,000 --> 0:20:11,000
are now both in middle school,

484
0:20:11.26,000 --> 0:20:14,000
and the answer has been so slow to come.

485
0:20:16.26,000 --> 0:20:18,000
She's given me her blessing

486
0:20:18.26,000 --> 0:20:21,000
to share this story with you.

487
0:20:21.26,000 --> 0:20:23,000
After undergoing biopsies

488
0:20:23.26,000 --> 0:20:26,000
that further increased her risk for cancer

489
0:20:26.26,000 --> 0:20:28,000
and losing her sister to cancer,

490
0:20:28.26,000 --> 0:20:3,000
she made the difficult decision

491
0:20:30.26,000 --> 0:20:33,000
to have a prophylactic mastectomy.

492
0:20:34.26,000 --> 0:20:37,000
We can and must do better,

493
0:20:37.26,000 --> 0:20:4,000
not just in time for her granddaughters

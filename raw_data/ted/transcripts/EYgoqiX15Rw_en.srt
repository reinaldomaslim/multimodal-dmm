2
0:00:15.671,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Today I'm going to unpack for you

3
0:00:17.931,000 --> 0:00:19,000
three examples of iconic design,

4
0:00:20.661,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and it makes perfect sense

5
0:00:21.946,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that I should be the one to do it

6
0:00:24.635,000 --> 0:00:27,000
because I have a Bachelor's degree in Literature.

7
0:00:28.562,000 --> 0:00:29,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:29.908,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But I'm also a famous

9
0:00:31.331,000 --> 0:00:33,000
minor television personality

10
0:00:33.392,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and an avid collector of

11
0:00:35.462,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Design Within Reach catalogs,

12
0:00:37.038,000 --> 0:00:39,000
so I pretty much know

13
0:00:39.345,000 --> 0:00:4,000
everything there is.

14
0:00:40.865,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now, I'm sure you

15
0:00:42.236,000 --> 0:00:43,000
recognize this object;

16
0:00:43.571,000 --> 0:00:44,000
many of you probably saw it

17
0:00:45.265,000 --> 0:00:46,000
as you were landing your private zeppelins

18
0:00:46.733,000 --> 0:00:48,000
at Los Angeles International Airport

19
0:00:49.221,000 --> 0:00:51,000
over the past couple of days.

20
0:00:51.414,000 --> 0:00:54,000
This is known as the Theme Building;

21
0:00:54.757,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that is its name for reasons

22
0:00:56.497,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that are still very murky.

23
0:00:59.248,000 --> 0:01:,000
And it is perhaps

24
0:01:00.669,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the best example we have in Los Angeles

25
0:01:03.959,000 --> 0:01:08,000
of ancient extraterrestrial architecture.

26
0:01:08.977,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It was first excavated in 1961

27
0:01:11.79,000 --> 0:01:12,000
as they were building LAX,

28
0:01:13.68,000 --> 0:01:14,000
although scientists believe that

29
0:01:15.329,000 --> 0:01:17,000
it dates back to the year 2000

30
0:01:17.916,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Before Common Era,

31
0:01:19.981,000 --> 0:01:2,000
when it was used as

32
0:01:21.322,000 --> 0:01:23,000
a busy transdimensional space port

33
0:01:23.697,000 --> 0:01:25,000
by the ancient astronauts

34
0:01:25.745,000 --> 0:01:27,000
who first colonized this planet

35
0:01:27.827,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and raised our species

36
0:01:29.337,000 --> 0:01:3,000
from savagery by giving us

37
0:01:31.053,000 --> 0:01:32,000
the gift of written language

38
0:01:32.747,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and technology and

39
0:01:34.545,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the gift of revolving restaurants.

40
0:01:37.025,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It is thought to have been

41
0:01:40.078,000 --> 0:01:42,000
a replacement for the older space ports

42
0:01:42.7,000 --> 0:01:44,000
located, of course, at Stonehenge

43
0:01:45.553,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and considered to be

44
0:01:46.749,000 --> 0:01:47,000
quite an improvement

45
0:01:47.876,000 --> 0:01:49,000
due to the uncluttered design,

46
0:01:49.953,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the lack of druids hanging around all the time

47
0:01:52.573,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and obviously, the much better

48
0:01:54.362,000 --> 0:01:55,000
access to parking.

49
0:01:56.082,000 --> 0:01:58,000
When it was uncovered,

50
0:01:58.372,000 --> 0:02:,000
it ushered in a new era

51
0:02:00.578,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of streamlined, archaically futuristic design

52
0:02:03.842,000 --> 0:02:04,000
called Googie,

53
0:02:05.271,000 --> 0:02:06,000
which came to be synonymous with

54
0:02:07.153,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the Jet Age, a misnomer.

55
0:02:09.352,000 --> 0:02:11,000
After all, the ancient astronauts who used it

56
0:02:12.086,000 --> 0:02:13,000
did not travel by jet very often,

57
0:02:13.924,000 --> 0:02:16,000
preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent

58
0:02:17.212,000 --> 0:02:19,000
powered by crystal skulls.

59
0:02:19.868,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Applause)

60
0:02:22.15,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Music)

61
0:02:25.736,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Ah yes, a table.

62
0:02:29.398,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We use these every day.

63
0:02:30.858,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And on top of it,

64
0:02:32.604,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the juicy salif.

65
0:02:34.759,000 --> 0:02:35,000
This is a design by Philippe Starck,

66
0:02:36.213,000 --> 0:02:38,000
who I believe is in the audience at this very moment.

67
0:02:38.276,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And you can tell it is a Starck design

68
0:02:40.191,000 --> 0:02:43,000
by its precision, its playfulness,

69
0:02:43.617,000 --> 0:02:45,000
its innovation and

70
0:02:45.858,000 --> 0:02:48,000
its promise of imminent violence.

71
0:02:49.11,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

72
0:02:51.175,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It is a design that challenges your intuition --

73
0:02:54.133,000 --> 0:02:56,000
it is not what you think it is when you first see it.

74
0:02:56.482,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It is not a fork designed

75
0:02:58.305,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to grab three hors d'oeuvres at a time,

76
0:03:01.679,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which would be useful out in the lobby,

77
0:03:03.455,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I would say.

78
0:03:04.624,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And despite its obvious

79
0:03:05.893,000 --> 0:03:06,000
influence by the ancient astronauts

80
0:03:07.649,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and its space agey-ness and tripodism,

81
0:03:11.839,000 --> 0:03:12,000
it is not something

82
0:03:13.281,000 --> 0:03:15,000
designed to attach to your brain

83
0:03:15.418,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and suck out your thoughts.

84
0:03:17.589,000 --> 0:03:19,000
It is in fact a citrus juicer

85
0:03:19.914,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and when I say that,

86
0:03:21.793,000 --> 0:03:23,000
you never see it as anything else again.

87
0:03:24.585,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It is also not a monument to design,

88
0:03:28.644,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it is a monument to design's utility.

89
0:03:31.237,000 --> 0:03:33,000
You can take it home with you,

90
0:03:33.309,000 --> 0:03:34,000
unlike the Theme Building,

91
0:03:35.137,000 --> 0:03:37,000
which will stay where it is forever.

92
0:03:37.698,000 --> 0:03:38,000
This is affordable

93
0:03:39.272,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and can come home with you

94
0:03:40.881,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and, as such, it can sit

95
0:03:42.941,000 --> 0:03:44,000
on your kitchen counter --

96
0:03:45.329,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it can't go in your drawers;

97
0:03:46.435,000 --> 0:03:48,000
trust me, I found that out the hard way --

98
0:03:49.155,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and make your kitchen counter into

99
0:03:51.141,000 --> 0:03:52,000
a monument to design.

100
0:03:52.714,000 --> 0:03:53,000
One other thing about it,

101
0:03:53.985,000 --> 0:03:54,000
if you do have one at home,

102
0:03:55.531,000 --> 0:03:57,000
let me tell you one of the features you may not know:

103
0:03:57.75,000 --> 0:03:58,000
when you fall asleep,

104
0:03:59.696,000 --> 0:04:02,000
it comes alive

105
0:04:03.087,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and it walks around your house

106
0:04:05.329,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and goes through your mail

107
0:04:06.668,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and watches you as you sleep.

108
0:04:08.918,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Applause)

109
0:04:13.1,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Okay, what is this object?

110
0:04:19.551,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I have no idea. I don't know what that thing is.

111
0:04:23.192,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It looks terrible. Is it a little hot plate?

112
0:04:24.994,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I don't get it.

113
0:04:26.402,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Does anyone know? Chi?

114
0:04:28.479,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It's an ... iPhone. iPhone.

115
0:04:30.282,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Oh yes, that's right, I remember those;

116
0:04:32.596,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I had my whole bathroom tiles

117
0:04:34.577,000 --> 0:04:37,000
redone with those back in the good old days.

118
0:04:37.846,000 --> 0:04:39,000
No, I have an iPhone. Of course I do.

119
0:04:39.855,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Here is my well-loved iPhone.

120
0:04:41.571,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I do so many things on this little device.

121
0:04:44.615,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I like to read books on it.

122
0:04:46.625,000 --> 0:04:48,000
More than that, I like to buy books on it

123
0:04:49.137,000 --> 0:04:5,000
that I never have to feel guilty about not reading

124
0:04:51.068,000 --> 0:04:52,000
because they go in here and I never look at them again

125
0:04:52.769,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and it's perfect.

126
0:04:55.715,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I use it every day to

127
0:04:57.871,000 --> 0:04:59,000
measure the weight of an ox,

128
0:05:00.306,000 --> 0:05:01,000
for example.

129
0:05:02.067,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Every now and then,

130
0:05:03.654,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I admit that I complete

131
0:05:05.107,000 --> 0:05:07,000
a phone call on it occasionally.

132
0:05:07.359,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And yet I forget about it all the time.

133
0:05:11.057,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This is a design

134
0:05:12.839,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that once you saw it,

135
0:05:14.46,000 --> 0:05:15,000
you forgot about it.

136
0:05:15.702,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It is easy to forget the gasp-inducement

137
0:05:18.405,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that occurred in 2007 when you first

138
0:05:21.487,000 --> 0:05:23,000
touched this thing because it became

139
0:05:24.257,000 --> 0:05:25,000
so quickly pervasive

140
0:05:25.894,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and because of how instantly

141
0:05:28.32,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we adopted these gestures

142
0:05:30.69,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and made it an extension of our life.

143
0:05:33.685,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Unlike the Theme Building,

144
0:05:36.191,000 --> 0:05:38,000
this is not alien technology.

145
0:05:38.214,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Or I should say,

146
0:05:39.976,000 --> 0:05:4,000
what it did was it took technology

147
0:05:41.775,000 --> 0:05:42,000
which, unlike people in this room,

148
0:05:43.207,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to many other people in the world,

149
0:05:44.301,000 --> 0:05:45,000
still feels very alien,

150
0:05:45.532,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and made it immediately and instantly feel

151
0:05:47.645,000 --> 0:05:49,000
familiar and intimate.

152
0:05:49.884,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And unlike the juicy salif,

153
0:05:52.083,000 --> 0:05:53,000
it does not threaten

154
0:05:53.715,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to attach itself to your brain,

155
0:05:55.907,000 --> 0:05:56,000
rather, it simply

156
0:05:57.875,000 --> 0:05:58,000
attaches itself to your brain.

157
0:05:59.718,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Laughter)

158
0:06:01.786,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And you didn't even notice it happened.

159
0:06:04.56,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So there you go. My name is John Hodgman.

160
0:06:06.682,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I just explained design.

161
0:06:09.907,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Thank you very much.

162
0:06:11.718,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Applause)

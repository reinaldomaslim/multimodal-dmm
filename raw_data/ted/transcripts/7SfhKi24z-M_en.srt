2
0:00:13.24,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I want to share with you

3
0:00:17.2,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a moment in my life

4
0:00:20.6,000 --> 0:00:24,000
when the hurt and wounds of racism

5
0:00:25.92,000 --> 0:00:29,000
were both deadly and paralyzing for me.

6
0:00:32.24,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I think what I've learned

7
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
can be a source of healing for all of us.

8
0:00:41.32,000 --> 0:00:45,000
When I was 17 years old,

9
0:00:47.92,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I was a college student at Tuskegee University,

10
0:00:54.52,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and I was a worker in the Southern freedom movement,

11
0:00:59.44,000 --> 0:01:01,000
which we call the Civil Rights Movement.

12
0:01:05.72,000 --> 0:01:06,000
During this time,

13
0:01:08.84,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I met another young 26-year-old,

14
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:17,000
white seminary and college student

15
0:01:17.04,000 --> 0:01:21,000
named Jonathan Daniels, from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

16
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
He and I

17
0:01:24.6,000 --> 0:01:29,000
were both part of a generation of idealistic young people,

18
0:01:31.64,000 --> 0:01:34,000
whose life has been ignited

19
0:01:35.12,000 --> 0:01:37,000
by the freedom fire

20
0:01:37.6,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that ordinary black people were spreading around the nation

21
0:01:42.6,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and throughout the South.

22
0:01:46.4,000 --> 0:01:48,000
We had come to Lowndes County

23
0:01:50.12,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to work in the movement.

24
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And it was a nonviolent movement

25
0:01:56.48,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to redeem the souls of America.

26
0:02:00.8,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We believe that everyone,

27
0:02:04.44,000 --> 0:02:06,000
both black and white,

28
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:08,000
people in the South,

29
0:02:09.92,000 --> 0:02:11,000
could find a redemptive pathway

30
0:02:13.4,000 --> 0:02:16,000
out of the stranglehold of racism

31
0:02:16.72,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that had gripped them for more than 400 years.

32
0:02:24.92,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And on a hot, summer day in August,

33
0:02:29.72,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Jonathan and I joined a demonstration

34
0:02:33.76,000 --> 0:02:35,000
of local young black people,

35
0:02:36.52,000 --> 0:02:39,000
who were protesting the exploitation

36
0:02:40.96,000 --> 0:02:44,000
[of] black sharecroppers

37
0:02:45.88,000 --> 0:02:5,000
by rich land holders who cheated them out of their money.

38
0:02:54.92,000 --> 0:02:58,000
We decided to demonstrate alongside them.

39
0:02:59.92,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And on the morning that we showed up for the demonstration,

40
0:03:04.56,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we were met with a mob of howling white men

41
0:03:09.32,000 --> 0:03:13,000
with baseball bats, shotguns

42
0:03:15.32,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and any weapon that you could imagine.

43
0:03:18.76,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And they were threatening to kill us.

44
0:03:22.2,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And the sheriff, seeing the danger that we faced,

45
0:03:28.56,000 --> 0:03:33,000
arrested us and put us on a garbage truck

46
0:03:33.8,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and took us to the local jail,

47
0:03:37.52,000 --> 0:03:4,000
where we were put in cells

48
0:03:41.48,000 --> 0:03:45,000
with the most inhumane conditions you can imagine.

49
0:03:46.76,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And we were threatened by the jailers

50
0:03:51.88,000 --> 0:03:55,000
with drinking water that came from toilets.

51
0:03:59.84,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We were finally released on the sixth day,

52
0:04:05.8,000 --> 0:04:08,000
without any knowledge, without any forewarning.

53
0:04:09.12,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Just out of the clear blue sky,

54
0:04:11.92,000 --> 0:04:12,000
we were made to leave.

55
0:04:14.84,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And we knew that this was a dangerous sign,

56
0:04:18.56,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because Goodman, Schwerner and Chaney had also been forced to leave jail

57
0:04:24.96,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and were murdered because no one knew what had happened to them.

58
0:04:29.64,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And so, despite our fervent resistance,

59
0:04:35.52,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the sheriff made us leave the jail,

60
0:04:38.4,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and of course, nobody was waiting for us.

61
0:04:44.04,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It was hot,

62
0:04:48.08,000 --> 0:04:5,000
one of those Southern days

63
0:04:50.84,000 --> 0:04:52,000
where you could literally feel the pavement --

64
0:04:54.96,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the vapor seeping out of the pavement.

65
0:05:00.72,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And the group of about 14 of us

66
0:05:05.84,000 --> 0:05:07,000
selected Jonathan Daniels,

67
0:05:09.44,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Father Morrisroe, who had recently come to the county,

68
0:05:13.56,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Joyce Bailey, a local 17-year-old girl

69
0:05:19.44,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and I to go and get the drinks.

70
0:05:23.44,000 --> 0:05:24,000
When we got to the door,

71
0:05:26.68,000 --> 0:05:3,000
a white man was standing in the doorway with a shotgun,

72
0:05:30.72,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and he said, "Bitch, I'll blow your brains out!"

73
0:05:36.68,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And before I could even react,

74
0:05:39.76,000 --> 0:05:42,000
before I could even process what was going on,

75
0:05:43.64,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Jonathan intentionally pulled my blouse,

76
0:05:48.28,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and I fell back, thinking that I was dead.

77
0:05:53.44,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And in that instant, when I looked up,

78
0:05:56.64,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Jonathan Daniels was standing in the line of fire,

79
0:06:01.44,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and he took the blast,

80
0:06:04.84,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and he saved my life.

81
0:06:15.12,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I was so traumatized

82
0:06:19.8,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and paralyzed by that event,

83
0:06:24.72,000 --> 0:06:28,000
where Tom Coleman deliberately,

84
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
with malicious intent,

85
0:06:33.28,000 --> 0:06:37,000
killed my beloved friend and colleague,

86
0:06:37.44,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Jonathan Myrick Daniels.

87
0:06:47.04,000 --> 0:06:48,000
On that day,

88
0:06:50.4,000 --> 0:06:53,000
which was one of the most important days in my life,

89
0:06:54.8,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I saw both love and hate

90
0:06:58.68,000 --> 0:07:02,000
coming from two very different white men

91
0:07:02.96,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that represented the best and the worst of white America.

92
0:07:10.8,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So deep was my hurt

93
0:07:12.6,000 --> 0:07:16,000
at seeing Tom Coleman murder Jonathan before my eyes,

94
0:07:17.36,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that I became a silent person,

95
0:07:20.28,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and I did not speak

96
0:07:23.76,000 --> 0:07:24,000
for six months.

97
0:07:28.36,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I finally learned to touch that hurt in me

98
0:07:33.08,000 --> 0:07:35,000
as I became older

99
0:07:35.6,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and began to talk about the Southern freedom movement,

100
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and began to connect my stories

101
0:07:42.84,000 --> 0:07:47,000
with the stories of my other colleagues and freedom fighters,

102
0:07:48.6,000 --> 0:07:53,000
who, like me, had faced deadly trauma of racism,

103
0:07:54.24,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and who had lost friends along the way,

104
0:07:57.52,000 --> 0:08:,000
and who themselves have been beaten and thrown in jail.

105
0:08:07.2,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It is 50 years later.

106
0:08:13.28,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Many people were beaten and thrown in jail.

107
0:08:18.88,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Others were murdered like Jonathan Daniels.

108
0:08:22.72,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And yet, we are still, as a nation,

109
0:08:27.84,000 --> 0:08:28,000
mired down

110
0:08:30.76,000 --> 0:08:32,000
in the quicksand of racism.

111
0:08:38.52,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And everywhere I go around the nation,

112
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I see and hear the hurt.

113
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And I ask people everywhere,

114
0:08:49.679,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"Tell me, where does it hurt?"

115
0:08:53.6,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Do you see and feel the hurt

116
0:08:57.12,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that I see and feel?

117
0:09:01.24,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I feel and see the hurt in black and brown people

118
0:09:07.88,000 --> 0:09:13,000
who every day feel the vicious volley of racism

119
0:09:16.32,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and every day have their civil and human rights stripped away.

120
0:09:22.04,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And the people who do this use stereotypes and myths

121
0:09:27.24,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to justify doing it.

122
0:09:33.92,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Everywhere I go,

123
0:09:36.88,000 --> 0:09:39,000
I see and hear women

124
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:46,000
who speak out against --

125
0:09:46.76,000 --> 0:09:5,000
who speak out against men who invade our bodies.

126
0:09:52.72,000 --> 0:09:55,000
These same men who then turn around --

127
0:09:56.52,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the same men who promote racism

128
0:09:59.04,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and then turn around and steal our labor and pay us unequal wages.

129
0:10:07.2,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I hear and feel the hurt of white men

130
0:10:11.4,000 --> 0:10:15,000
at the betrayal by the same powerful white men

131
0:10:16.76,000 --> 0:10:18,000
who tell them that their skin color

132
0:10:20.76,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is their ticket to a good life and power,

133
0:10:24.2,000 --> 0:10:26,000
only to discover,

134
0:10:27.04,000 --> 0:10:3,000
as the circle of whiteness narrows,

135
0:10:30.52,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that their tickets have expired

136
0:10:33.72,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and no longer carry first-class status.

137
0:10:39.48,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Now that we've touched the hurt,

138
0:10:42.64,000 --> 0:10:44,000
we must ask ourselves,

139
0:10:45.44,000 --> 0:10:46,000
"Where does it hurt

140
0:10:48.48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and what is the source of the hurt?"

141
0:10:55.44,000 --> 0:11:,000
I propose that we must look

142
0:11:00.64,000 --> 0:11:03,000
deeply into the culture of whiteness.

143
0:11:04.96,000 --> 0:11:08,000
That is a river that drowns out all of our identities

144
0:11:09.76,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and drowns us in false uniformity to protect the status quo.

145
0:11:16.76,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Notice, everybody, I said culture of whiteness,

146
0:11:21.92,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and not white people.

147
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Because in my estimation,

148
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:29,000
the problem is not white people.

149
0:11:30.12,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Instead, it is the culture of whiteness.

150
0:11:34.32,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And by culture of whiteness,

151
0:11:35.72,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I mean a systemic and organized set of beliefs,

152
0:11:41.72,000 --> 0:11:47,000
values, canonized knowledge and even religion,

153
0:11:49.84,000 --> 0:11:54,000
to maintain a hierarchical, over-and-against power structure

154
0:11:55.4,000 --> 0:11:58,000
based on skin color, against people of color.

155
0:12:03.64,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It is a culture

156
0:12:08.24,000 --> 0:12:14,000
where white people are seen as necessary and friendly insiders,

157
0:12:15.68,000 --> 0:12:18,000
while people of color, especially black people,

158
0:12:19.72,000 --> 0:12:21,000
are seen as dangerous

159
0:12:23.76,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and threatening outsiders,

160
0:12:26.6,000 --> 0:12:29,000
who pose a clear and present danger

161
0:12:29.88,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to the safety and the efficacy

162
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:37,000
of the culture of whiteness.

163
0:12:44.88,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Listen to me and see if you can imagine

164
0:12:49.2,000 --> 0:12:54,000
the culture of whiteness as a dehumanizing process

165
0:12:54.56,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that melts away

166
0:12:56.04,000 --> 0:13:01,000
all of our multiple and interlocking identities,

167
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:07,000
such as race, class, gender and sexualities,

168
0:13:07.84,000 --> 0:13:08,000
so that ...

169
0:13:10.88,000 --> 0:13:14,000
so that unity is maintained for power.

170
0:13:18.64,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I believe, because I know

171
0:13:22.6,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and believe that the culture of whiteness

172
0:13:27.52,000 --> 0:13:29,000
is a social construct.

173
0:13:32.72,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Each of us, from birth to death,

174
0:13:36.52,000 --> 0:13:39,000
are socialized in this culture.

175
0:13:39.84,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And it marks people of color also.

176
0:13:42.88,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And it makes people of color, like white people,

177
0:13:47.44,000 --> 0:13:5,000
vote against our interests.

178
0:13:57.08,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Some of you might ask --

179
0:13:58.56,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and my students always tell me I give hard assignments --

180
0:14:02.84,000 --> 0:14:04,000
some of you might ask, and rightfully so,

181
0:14:07.64,000 --> 0:14:09,000
"How do we fix this?

182
0:14:10.4,000 --> 0:14:13,000
It seems so all-powerful and overwhelming."

183
0:14:16.92,000 --> 0:14:19,000
I believe that we must fix it,

184
0:14:20.12,000 --> 0:14:23,000
because we cannot humanize our future

185
0:14:23.6,000 --> 0:14:26,000
if we continue to be complicit

186
0:14:27.36,000 --> 0:14:29,000
with the culture of whiteness.

187
0:14:30.68,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Each of us must connect with our authentic selves,

188
0:14:36.12,000 --> 0:14:39,000
with our authentic ethnic selves.

189
0:14:39.4,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And we must connect with the other aspects of our identities.

190
0:14:44.96,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And we must move out of the constructs

191
0:14:48.4,000 --> 0:14:52,000
of whiteness, brownness and blackness

192
0:14:53.04,000 --> 0:14:57,000
to become who we are at our fullest.

193
0:15:02.08,000 --> 0:15:05,000
How do we do this?

194
0:15:05.48,000 --> 0:15:09,000
I believe that we do this through our collective narratives.

195
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And our collective narratives must contain our individual stories,

196
0:15:16.24,000 --> 0:15:18,000
the arts,

197
0:15:18.48,000 --> 0:15:2,000
spiritual reflections,

198
0:15:22.48,000 --> 0:15:23,000
literature,

199
0:15:26.04,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and yes, even drumming.

200
0:15:28.4,000 --> 0:15:29,000
(Laughter)

201
0:15:32.08,000 --> 0:15:35,000
It must be a collective telling,

202
0:15:35.4,000 --> 0:15:39,000
because individual stories just create a paradigm

203
0:15:39.84,000 --> 0:15:42,000
where we are pitting one story against another story.

204
0:15:49.12,000 --> 0:15:52,000
These different models that I have talked about tonight

205
0:15:54.52,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I think are essential to providing us a pathway

206
0:15:59.64,000 --> 0:16:03,000
out of the quagmire of racism.

207
0:16:03.72,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And I want to talk about another very important model.

208
0:16:08.68,000 --> 0:16:1,000
And that is redemption.

209
0:16:12.68,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I believe that movements for racial justice

210
0:16:17.68,000 --> 0:16:21,000
must be redemptive rather than punitive.

211
0:16:22.56,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And yes, I believe

212
0:16:25.44,000 --> 0:16:29,000
that we must provide the possibility of redemption for everyone.

213
0:16:30.72,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And we must be willing,

214
0:16:32.96,000 --> 0:16:35,000
despite some of the vitriolic language

215
0:16:36.4,000 --> 0:16:41,000
that might come from those very people who oppress us,

216
0:16:41.44,000 --> 0:16:45,000
I think that we must listen to them

217
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and try to figure out where do they hurt.

218
0:16:50.12,000 --> 0:16:51,000
We must do this, I believe,

219
0:16:52.04,000 --> 0:16:57,000
because our redemption is tied into their redemption,

220
0:16:57.96,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And we will not be free

221
0:17:00.48,000 --> 0:17:04,000
until we've all been redeemed from unredemptive anger.

222
0:17:14.2,000 --> 0:17:16,000
The challenge is not easy.

223
0:17:17.319,000 --> 0:17:22,000
And in a technological society, it grows even more complicated,

224
0:17:22.8,000 --> 0:17:24,000
because often we use technologies

225
0:17:25.52,000 --> 0:17:3,000
to perpetuate the very values of racism that we indulge in every day.

226
0:17:33.28,000 --> 0:17:35,000
We use technology to bully,

227
0:17:37.119,000 --> 0:17:39,000
to perpetuate hate speech

228
0:17:40.72,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and to degrade each other's humanities.

229
0:17:45.12,000 --> 0:17:49,000
And so I believe that if we're going to humanize the future,

230
0:17:49.68,000 --> 0:17:52,000
we must design ways to use technology

231
0:17:52.96,000 --> 0:17:55,000
not to degrade us, but to elevate us

232
0:17:56.44,000 --> 0:18:,000
so that we can live into the fullest of our capacities.

233
0:18:00.84,000 --> 0:18:02,000
And I believe that technology

234
0:18:03.6,000 --> 0:18:07,000
must provide us larger vistas

235
0:18:07.88,000 --> 0:18:09,000
so that we might engage with each other

236
0:18:10.56,000 --> 0:18:15,000
and move beyond the segregated spaces that we live in, every day of our lives.

237
0:18:17.88,000 --> 0:18:18,000
I believe

238
0:18:21.24,000 --> 0:18:25,000
that we can achieve this if we set our minds

239
0:18:27.4,000 --> 0:18:29,000
and hopes on the prize.

240
0:18:32.88,000 --> 0:18:34,000
The question before us tonight

241
0:18:37.36,000 --> 0:18:38,000
is very serious.

242
0:18:40.84,000 --> 0:18:43,000
It is: "Do you want to be healed?

243
0:18:45.72,000 --> 0:18:47,000
Do you want to be healed?"

244
0:18:49.52,000 --> 0:18:54,000
Do you want to become whole and live into all of your identities?

245
0:18:54.64,000 --> 0:19:,000
Or do you want to continue to cannibalize your multiple identities

246
0:19:01.24,000 --> 0:19:03,000
and privilege one identity over the other?

247
0:19:07.24,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Do you want to join a long line

248
0:19:12.24,000 --> 0:19:14,000
of generations of people

249
0:19:15.88,000 --> 0:19:18,000
who believed in the promise of America

250
0:19:19.48,000 --> 0:19:23,000
and had the faith to upbuild democracy?

251
0:19:28.76,000 --> 0:19:32,000
Do you want to live into the fullest of your potential?

252
0:19:33.44,000 --> 0:19:34,000
I certainly do.

253
0:19:35.04,000 --> 0:19:36,000
And I believe you do, too.

254
0:19:39.92,000 --> 0:19:43,000
Let me just say, quite seriously,

255
0:19:44.08,000 --> 0:19:45,000
I believe in you.

256
0:19:47.08,000 --> 0:19:48,000
And despite everything,

257
0:19:49.96,000 --> 0:19:52,000
I still believe in America.

258
0:19:55.76,000 --> 0:19:58,000
I hope that this offering that I've given to you tonight,

259
0:19:59.32,000 --> 0:20:01,000
that I've shared with you tonight,

260
0:20:01.88,000 --> 0:20:04,000
will provide redemptive pathways

261
0:20:05.68,000 --> 0:20:09,000
so that you might claim the fullest of your identity

262
0:20:10.28,000 --> 0:20:12,000
and become a major participant

263
0:20:13.12,000 --> 0:20:18,000
in humanizing not only the future for yourselves,

264
0:20:18.56,000 --> 0:20:2,000
but also for our democracy.

265
0:20:21.52,000 --> 0:20:22,000
Thank you.

266
0:20:22.8,000 --> 0:20:26,000
(Applause)

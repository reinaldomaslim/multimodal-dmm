1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
"What I Will"

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I will not dance to your war drum.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I will not lend my soul nor my bones to your war drum.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I will not dance to that beating.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I know that beat.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It is lifeless.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I know intimately that skin you are hitting.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It was alive once,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
hunted, stolen,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
stretched.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I will not dance to your drummed-up war.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I will not pop, spin, break for you.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I will not hate for you

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
or even hate you.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I will not kill for you.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Especially I will not die for you.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I will not mourn the dead with murder nor suicide.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I will not side with you or dance to bombs

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
because everyone is dancing.

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Everyone can be wrong.

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Life is a right, not collateral or casual.

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I will not forget where I come from.

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I will craft my own drum.

24
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Gather my beloved near,

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and our chanting will be dancing.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Our humming will be drumming.

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I will not be played.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I will not lend my name nor my rhythm to your beat.

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I will dance and resist and dance and persist and dance.

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
This heartbeat is louder than death.

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Your war drum ain't louder

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
than this breath. Haaa.

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
What's up TED people? Let me hear you make some noise.

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Applause)

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
A bunch of pacifists.

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Confused, aspiring pacifists.

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I understand.

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I've been wrong a lot lately.

39
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Like a lot.

40
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So I couldn't figure out

41
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
what to read today.

42
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I mean, I've been saying I've been prepping.

43
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What that means is prepping my outfit,

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
prepping options,

46
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
trying to figure out what I'm coming behind

47
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and going in front of.

48
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Poetry does that.

49
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It preps you. It aims you.

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So I am going to read a poem

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that was chosen just now.

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But I'm going to need you

53
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to just sit for like 10 minutes

54
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and hold a woman who is not here.

55
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Hold her now

56
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
with you.

57
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
You don't need to say her name out loud, you can just hold her.

58
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Are you holding her?

59
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
This is "Break Clustered."

60
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
All holy history banned.

61
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Unwritten books predicted the future, projected the past.

62
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
But my head unwraps

63
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
around what appears limitless,

64
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
man's creative violence.

65
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Whose son shall it be?

66
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Which male child will perish a new day?

67
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Our boys' deaths galvanize.

68
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
We cherish corpses.

69
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
We mourn women, complicated.

70
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Bitches get beat daily.

71
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Profits made, prophets ignored.

72
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
War and tooth, enameled salted lemon childhoods.

73
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
All colors run, none of us solid.

74
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Don't look for shadow behind me. I carry it within.

75
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I live cycles of light and darkness.

76
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Rhythm is half silence.

77
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I see now, I never was one and not the other.

78
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Sickness, health, tender violence.

79
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I think now I never was pure.

80
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Before form I was storm,

81
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
blind, ign'ant -- still am.

82
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Human contracted itself blind, malignant.

83
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I never was pure.

84
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Girl spoiled before ripened.

85
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Language can't math me.

86
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I experience exponentially.

87
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Everything is everything.

88
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
One woman loses 15, maybe 20, members of her family.

89
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
One woman loses six.

90
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
One woman loses her head.

91
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
One woman searches rubble. One woman feeds on trash.

92
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
One woman shoots her face. One woman shoots her husband.

93
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
One woman straps herself.

94
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
One woman gives birth to a baby.

95
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
One woman gives birth to borders.

96
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
One woman no longer believes love will ever find her.

97
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
One woman never did.

98
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Where do refugee hearts go?

99
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Broken, dissed,

100
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
placed where they're not from, don't want to be missed.

101
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Faced with absence.

102
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We mourn each one

103
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
or we mean nothing at all.

104
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
My spine curves spiral.

105
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Precipice running to and running from human beings.

106
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Cluster bombs left behind.

107
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
De facto landmines.

108
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
A smoldering grief.

109
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Harvest contaminated tobacco.

110
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Harvest bombs.

111
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Harvest baby teeth.

112
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Harvest palms, smoke.

113
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Harvest witness, smoke.

114
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Resolutions, smoke.

115
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Salvation, smoke.

116
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Redemption, smoke.

117
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Breathe.

118
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Do not fear

119
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
what has blown up.

120
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
If you must,

121
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
fear the unexploded.

122
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Thank you.

123
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:13,000
For the last year,

2
0:00:14.24,000 --> 0:00:16,000
everyone's been watching the same show,

3
0:00:16.92,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and I'm not talking about "Game of Thrones,"

4
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but a horrifying, real-life drama

5
0:00:22.12,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that's proved too fascinating to turn off.

6
0:00:25.4,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It's a show produced by murderers

7
0:00:28.12,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and shared around the world via the Internet.

8
0:00:32.08,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Their names have become familiar:

9
0:00:34.56,000 --> 0:00:4,000
James Foley, Steven Sotloff, David Haines, Alan Henning, Peter Kassig,

10
0:00:41.48,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Haruna Yukawa, Kenji Goto Jogo.

11
0:00:45.12,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Their beheadings by the Islamic State

12
0:00:47.84,000 --> 0:00:48,000
were barbaric,

13
0:00:49.48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but if we think they were archaic,

14
0:00:53.28,000 --> 0:00:55,000
from a remote, obscure age,

15
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
then we're wrong.

16
0:00:57.84,000 --> 0:00:59,000
They were uniquely modern,

17
0:01:00.6,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because the murderers acted knowing well

18
0:01:03.48,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that millions of people would tune in to watch.

19
0:01:07.68,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The headlines called them savages and barbarians,

20
0:01:11.04,000 --> 0:01:14,000
because the image of one man overpowering another,

21
0:01:14.52,000 --> 0:01:16,000
killing him with a knife to the throat,

22
0:01:16.8,000 --> 0:01:2,000
conforms to our idea of ancient, primitive practices,

23
0:01:21.12,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the polar opposite of our urban, civilized ways.

24
0:01:26.24,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We don't do things like that.

25
0:01:29.96,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But that's the irony.

26
0:01:31.8,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We think a beheading has nothing to do with us,

27
0:01:34.48,000 --> 0:01:36,000
even as we click on the screen to watch.

28
0:01:38.28,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But it is to do with us.

29
0:01:41.84,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The Islamic State beheadings

30
0:01:44.32,000 --> 0:01:46,000
are not ancient or remote.

31
0:01:47.04,000 --> 0:01:5,000
They're a global, 21st century event,

32
0:01:50.08,000 --> 0:01:54,000
a 21st century event that takes place in our living rooms, at our desks,

33
0:01:55.04,000 --> 0:01:57,000
on our computer screens.

34
0:01:57.4,000 --> 0:02:01,000
They're entirely dependent on the power of technology to connect us.

35
0:02:02.88,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And whether we like it or not,

36
0:02:04.48,000 --> 0:02:07,000
everyone who watches is a part of the show.

37
0:02:09.28,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And lots of people watch.

38
0:02:13.56,000 --> 0:02:14,000
We don't know exactly how many.

39
0:02:15.12,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Obviously, it's difficult to calculate.

40
0:02:17.8,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But a poll taken in the UK, for example, in August 2014,

41
0:02:23.48,000 --> 0:02:27,000
estimated that 1.2 million people

42
0:02:29.32,000 --> 0:02:32,000
had watched the beheading of James Foley

43
0:02:32.8,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in the few days after it was released.

44
0:02:36.6,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And that's just the first few days,

45
0:02:39.08,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and just Britain.

46
0:02:41.68,000 --> 0:02:43,000
A similar poll taken in the United States

47
0:02:44.12,000 --> 0:02:45,000
in November 2014

48
0:02:46.96,000 --> 0:02:48,000
found that nine percent of those surveyed

49
0:02:49.72,000 --> 0:02:51,000
had watched beheading videos,

50
0:02:52.52,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and a further 23 percent

51
0:02:54.8,000 --> 0:02:58,000
had watched the videos but had stopped just before the death was shown.

52
0:03:00.72,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Nine percent may be a small minority of all the people who could watch,

53
0:03:05.72,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but it's still a very large crowd.

54
0:03:08.8,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And of course that crowd is growing all the time,

55
0:03:11.56,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because every week, every month,

56
0:03:13.72,000 --> 0:03:16,000
more people will keep downloading and keep watching.

57
0:03:18.6,000 --> 0:03:19,000
If we go back 11 years,

58
0:03:20.56,000 --> 0:03:23,000
before sites like YouTube and Facebook were born,

59
0:03:24.04,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it was a similar story.

60
0:03:25.8,000 --> 0:03:28,000
When innocent civilians like Daniel Pearl,

61
0:03:29.2,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Nick Berg, Paul Johnson, were beheaded,

62
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
those videos were shown during the Iraq War.

63
0:03:36.8,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Nick Berg's beheading

64
0:03:38.48,000 --> 0:03:42,000
quickly became one of the most searched for items on the Internet.

65
0:03:44.2,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Within a day, it was the top search term

66
0:03:47.24,000 --> 0:03:52,000
across search engines like Google, Lycos, Yahoo.

67
0:03:52.36,000 --> 0:03:55,000
In the week after Nick Berg's beheading,

68
0:03:55.56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
these were the top 10 search terms in the United States.

69
0:04:00.88,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The Berg beheading video remained the most popular search term for a week,

70
0:04:05.8,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and it was the second most popular search term for the whole month of May,

71
0:04:10.44,000 --> 0:04:12,000
runner-up only to "American Idol."

72
0:04:14.64,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The al-Qaeda-linked website that first showed Nick Berg's beheading

73
0:04:19.36,000 --> 0:04:24,000
had to close down within a couple of days due to overwhelming traffic to the site.

74
0:04:25.6,000 --> 0:04:29,000
One Dutch website owner said that his daily viewing figures

75
0:04:29.76,000 --> 0:04:33,000
rose from 300,000 to 750,000

76
0:04:34.6,000 --> 0:04:36,000
every time a beheading in Iraq was shown.

77
0:04:38.44,000 --> 0:04:41,000
He told reporters 18 months later

78
0:04:41.6,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that it had been downloaded many millions of times,

79
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and that's just one website.

80
0:04:47.76,000 --> 0:04:49,000
A similar pattern was seen again and again

81
0:04:50.28,000 --> 0:04:54,000
when videos of beheadings were released during the Iraq War.

82
0:04:56.88,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Social media sites have made these images more accessible than ever before,

83
0:05:01.92,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but if we take another step back in history,

84
0:05:05.48,000 --> 0:05:1,000
we'll see that it was the camera that first created a new kind of crowd

85
0:05:10.64,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in our history of beheadings as public spectacle.

86
0:05:14.84,000 --> 0:05:17,000
As soon as the camera appeared on the scene,

87
0:05:17.92,000 --> 0:05:2,000
a full lifetime ago on June 17, 1939,

88
0:05:21.68,000 --> 0:05:24,000
it had an immediate and unequivocal effect.

89
0:05:25.4,000 --> 0:05:3,000
That day, the first film of a public beheading was created in France.

90
0:05:31.68,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It was the execution, the guillotining, of a German serial killer, Eugen Weidmann,

91
0:05:37.44,000 --> 0:05:39,000
outside the prison Saint-Pierre in Versailles.

92
0:05:42.24,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Weidmann was due to be executed at the crack of dawn,

93
0:05:45.24,000 --> 0:05:47,000
as was customary at the time,

94
0:05:47.44,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but his executioner was new to the job,

95
0:05:50.04,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and he'd underestimated how long it would take him to prepare.

96
0:05:53.92,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So Weidmann was executed at 4:30 in the morning,

97
0:05:58.08,000 --> 0:06:,000
by which time on a June morning,

98
0:06:00.48,000 --> 0:06:02,000
there was enough light to take photographs,

99
0:06:03.88,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and a spectator in the crowd filmed the event,

100
0:06:08.04,000 --> 0:06:1,000
unbeknownst to the authorities.

101
0:06:11.04,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Several still photographs were taken as well,

102
0:06:15.36,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and you can still watch the film online today

103
0:06:19.52,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and look at the photographs.

104
0:06:22.96,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The crowd on the day of Weidmann's execution

105
0:06:26.4,000 --> 0:06:29,000
was called "unruly" and "disgusting" by the press,

106
0:06:30.4,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but that was nothing compared to the untold thousands of people

107
0:06:34.6,000 --> 0:06:36,000
who could now study the action

108
0:06:37.24,000 --> 0:06:38,000
over and over again,

109
0:06:38.48,000 --> 0:06:4,000
freeze-framed in every detail.

110
0:06:43.12,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The camera may have made these scenes more accessible than ever before,

111
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
but it's not just about the camera.

112
0:06:50.68,000 --> 0:06:52,000
If we take a bigger leap back in history,

113
0:06:53.12,000 --> 0:06:55,000
we'll see that for as long as there have been

114
0:06:55.32,000 --> 0:06:58,000
public judicial executions and beheadings,

115
0:06:58.44,000 --> 0:07:,000
there have been the crowds to see them.

116
0:07:01.92,000 --> 0:07:04,000
In London, as late as the early 19th century,

117
0:07:05.08,000 --> 0:07:09,000
there might be four or five thousand people to see a standard hanging.

118
0:07:09.76,000 --> 0:07:13,000
There could be 40,000 or 50,000 to see a famous criminal killed.

119
0:07:15.08,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And a beheading, which was a rare event in England at the time,

120
0:07:19.52,000 --> 0:07:2,000
attracted even more.

121
0:07:21.84,000 --> 0:07:23,000
In May 1820,

122
0:07:24.92,000 --> 0:07:28,000
five men known as the Cato Street Conspirators

123
0:07:28.96,000 --> 0:07:3,000
were executed in London for plotting

124
0:07:31.12,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to assassinate members of the British government.

125
0:07:34.44,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They were hung and then decapitated.

126
0:07:38.12,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It was a gruesome scene.

127
0:07:40.12,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Each man's head was hacked off in turn and held up to the crowd.

128
0:07:44.52,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And 100,000 people,

129
0:07:46.72,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that's 10,000 more than can fit into Wembley Stadium,

130
0:07:50.36,000 --> 0:07:51,000
had turned out to watch.

131
0:07:52.32,000 --> 0:07:54,000
The streets were packed.

132
0:07:54.6,000 --> 0:07:58,000
People had rented out windows and rooftops.

133
0:07:58.84,000 --> 0:08:01,000
People had climbed onto carts and wagons in the street.

134
0:08:01.88,000 --> 0:08:03,000
People climbed lamp posts.

135
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:08,000
People had been known to have died in the crush on popular execution days.

136
0:08:10.12,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Evidence suggests that throughout our history

137
0:08:13.56,000 --> 0:08:16,000
of public beheadings and public executions,

138
0:08:16.92,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the vast majority of the people who come to see

139
0:08:20.28,000 --> 0:08:24,000
are either enthusiastic or, at best, unmoved.

140
0:08:25.52,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Disgust has been comparatively rare,

141
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and even when people are disgusted and are horrified,

142
0:08:33.4,000 --> 0:08:37,000
it doesn't always stop them from coming out all the same to watch.

143
0:08:38.6,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Perhaps the most striking example

144
0:08:41.84,000 --> 0:08:46,000
of the human ability to watch a beheading and remain unmoved

145
0:08:47.159,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and even be disappointed

146
0:08:49.52,000 --> 0:08:54,000
was the introduction in France in 1792 of the guillotine,

147
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that famous decapitation machine.

148
0:08:58.24,000 --> 0:09:,000
To us in the 21st century,

149
0:09:00.88,000 --> 0:09:03,000
the guillotine may seem like a monstrous contraption,

150
0:09:04.4,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but to the first crowds who saw it, it was actually a disappointment.

151
0:09:10.88,000 --> 0:09:16,000
They were used to seeing long, drawn-out, torturous executions on the scaffold,

152
0:09:17.44,000 --> 0:09:22,000
where people were mutilated and burned and pulled apart slowly.

153
0:09:22.92,000 --> 0:09:24,000
To them, watching the guillotine in action,

154
0:09:25.92,000 --> 0:09:28,000
it was so quick, there was nothing to see.

155
0:09:29.12,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The blade fell, the head fell into a basket, out of sight immediately,

156
0:09:34.36,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and they called out,

157
0:09:36.08,000 --> 0:09:39,000
"Give me back my gallows, give me back my wooden gallows."

158
0:09:41.36,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The end of torturous public judicial executions in Europe and America

159
0:09:46.56,000 --> 0:09:49,000
was partly to do with being more humane towards the criminal,

160
0:09:50.52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but it was also partly because the crowd obstinately refused to behave

161
0:09:55.28,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in the way that they should.

162
0:09:57.56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
All too often, execution day

163
0:09:59.92,000 --> 0:10:02,000
was more like a carnival than a solemn ceremony.

164
0:10:04.52,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Today, a public judicial execution in Europe or America is unthinkable,

165
0:10:09.36,000 --> 0:10:11,000
but there are other scenarios that should make us cautious

166
0:10:12.12,000 --> 0:10:14,000
about thinking that things are different now

167
0:10:14.2,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and we don't behave like that anymore.

168
0:10:17.56,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Take, for example, the incidents of suicide baiting.

169
0:10:22.2,000 --> 0:10:24,000
This is when a crowd gathers

170
0:10:24.4,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to watch a person who has climbed to the top of a public building

171
0:10:28.04,000 --> 0:10:3,000
in order to kill themselves,

172
0:10:30.48,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and people in the crowd shout and jeer,

173
0:10:33.48,000 --> 0:10:35,000
"Get on with it! Go on and jump!"

174
0:10:36.6,000 --> 0:10:39,000
This is a well-recognized phenomenon.

175
0:10:40.12,000 --> 0:10:46,000
One paper in 1981 found that in 10 out of 21 threatened suicide attempts,

176
0:10:46.4,000 --> 0:10:5,000
there was incidents of suicide baiting and jeering from a crowd.

177
0:10:51.28,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And there have been incidents reported in the press this year.

178
0:10:56.88,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This was a very widely reported incident

179
0:10:59.68,000 --> 0:11:01,000
in Telford and Shropshire in March this year.

180
0:11:02.68,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And when it happens today,

181
0:11:04.32,000 --> 0:11:07,000
people take photographs and they take videos on their phones

182
0:11:07.76,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and they post those videos online.

183
0:11:12.12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
When it comes to brutal murderers who post their beheading videos,

184
0:11:15.84,000 --> 0:11:18,000
the Internet has created a new kind of crowd.

185
0:11:19.56,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Today, the action takes place in a distant time and place,

186
0:11:24.6,000 --> 0:11:27,000
which gives the viewer a sense of detachment from what's happening,

187
0:11:27.92,000 --> 0:11:28,000
a sense of separation.

188
0:11:29.2,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It's nothing to do with me.

189
0:11:30.96,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It's already happened.

190
0:11:33.4,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We are also offered an unprecedented sense of intimacy.

191
0:11:36.96,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Today, we are all offered front row seats.

192
0:11:39.68,000 --> 0:11:42,000
We can all watch in private, in our own time and space,

193
0:11:43.44,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and no one need ever know that we've clicked on the screen to watch.

194
0:11:48.52,000 --> 0:11:49,000
This sense of separation --

195
0:11:50.52,000 --> 0:11:52,000
from other people, from the event itself --

196
0:11:53.52,000 --> 0:11:56,000
seems to be key to understanding our ability to watch,

197
0:11:57.12,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and there are several ways

198
0:11:58.4,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in which the Internet creates a sense of detachment

199
0:12:01.68,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that seems to erode individual moral responsibility.

200
0:12:06.68,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Our activities online are often contrasted with real life,

201
0:12:10.4,000 --> 0:12:13,000
as though the things we do online are somehow less real.

202
0:12:14.28,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We feel less accountable for our actions

203
0:12:17.28,000 --> 0:12:2,000
when we interact online.

204
0:12:20.64,000 --> 0:12:24,000
There's a sense of anonymity, a sense of invisibility,

205
0:12:24.76,000 --> 0:12:26,000
so we feel less accountable for our behavior.

206
0:12:28.8,000 --> 0:12:32,000
The Internet also makes it far easier to stumble upon things inadvertently,

207
0:12:33.44,000 --> 0:12:36,000
things that we would usually avoid in everyday life.

208
0:12:37.08,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Today, a video can start playing before you even know what you're watching.

209
0:12:41.96,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Or you may be tempted to look at material that you wouldn't look at in everyday life

210
0:12:46,000 --> 0:12:49,000
or you wouldn't look at if you were with other people at the time.

211
0:12:50.12,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And when the action is pre-recorded

212
0:12:53.04,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and takes place in a distant time and space,

213
0:12:57.28,000 --> 0:13:,000
watching seems like a passive activity.

214
0:13:01.28,000 --> 0:13:02,000
There's nothing I can do about it now.

215
0:13:03.12,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It's already happened.

216
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
All these things make it easier as an Internet user

217
0:13:08.48,000 --> 0:13:11,000
for us to give in to our sense of curiosity about death,

218
0:13:12.32,000 --> 0:13:14,000
to push our personal boundaries,

219
0:13:15.04,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to test our sense of shock, to explore our sense of shock.

220
0:13:21.36,000 --> 0:13:23,000
But we're not passive when we watch.

221
0:13:23.72,000 --> 0:13:27,000
On the contrary, we're fulfilling the murderer's desire to be seen.

222
0:13:28.24,000 --> 0:13:32,000
When the victim of a decapitation is bound and defenseless,

223
0:13:32.72,000 --> 0:13:36,000
he or she essentially becomes a pawn in their killer's show.

224
0:13:38.52,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Unlike a trophy head that's taken in battle,

225
0:13:41.4,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that represents the luck and skill it takes to win a fight,

226
0:13:47.2,000 --> 0:13:49,000
when a beheading is staged,

227
0:13:49.36,000 --> 0:13:51,000
when it's essentially a piece of theater,

228
0:13:52.32,000 --> 0:13:57,000
the power comes from the reception the killer receives as he performs.

229
0:13:58.88,000 --> 0:14:02,000
In other words, watching is very much part of the event.

230
0:14:03.64,000 --> 0:14:06,000
The event no longer takes place in a single location

231
0:14:07.2,000 --> 0:14:12,000
at a certain point in time as it used to and as it may still appear to.

232
0:14:13.2,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Now the event is stretched out in time and place,

233
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and everyone who watches plays their part.

234
0:14:21.52,000 --> 0:14:22,000
We should stop watching,

235
0:14:24.12,000 --> 0:14:25,000
but we know we won't.

236
0:14:26.44,000 --> 0:14:28,000
History tells us we won't,

237
0:14:28.92,000 --> 0:14:29,000
and the killers know it too.

238
0:14:31.24,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Thank you.

239
0:14:32.48,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Applause)

240
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Let me get this back. Thank you.

241
0:14:39.92,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Let's move here. While they install for the next performance,

242
0:14:42.84,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I want to ask you the question that probably many here have,

243
0:14:45.72,000 --> 0:14:47,000
which is how did you get interested in this topic?

244
0:14:50.36,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Frances Larson: I used to work at a museum

245
0:14:52.4,000 --> 0:14:53,000
called the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford,

246
0:14:54.36,000 --> 0:14:57,000
which was famous for its display of shrunken heads from South America.

247
0:14:58.24,000 --> 0:15:01,000
People used to say, "Oh, the shrunken head museum, the shrunken head museum!"

248
0:15:02.2,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And at the time, I was working on the history

249
0:15:05.84,000 --> 0:15:07,000
of scientific collections of skulls.

250
0:15:07.88,000 --> 0:15:09,000
I was working on the cranial collections,

251
0:15:10.48,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and it just struck me as ironic

252
0:15:12.32,000 --> 0:15:16,000
that here were people coming to see this gory, primitive, savage culture

253
0:15:17.12,000 --> 0:15:2,000
that they were almost fantasizing about and creating

254
0:15:21.96,000 --> 0:15:23,000
without really understanding what they were seeing,

255
0:15:24.365,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and all the while these vast -- I mean hundreds of thousands

256
0:15:27.96,000 --> 0:15:31,000
of skulls in our museums, all across Europe and the States --

257
0:15:32.12,000 --> 0:15:37,000
were kind of upholding this Enlightenment pursuit of scientific rationality.

258
0:15:37.4,000 --> 0:15:42,000
So I wanted to kind of twist it round and say, "Let's look at us."

259
0:15:42.48,000 --> 0:15:44,000
We're looking through the glass case at these shrunken heads.

260
0:15:45.4,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Let's look at our own history and our own cultural fascination with these things.

261
0:15:49.96,000 --> 0:15:5,000
BG: Thank you for sharing that.

262
0:15:51.802,000 --> 0:15:52,000
FL: Thank you.

263
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:56,000
(Applause)

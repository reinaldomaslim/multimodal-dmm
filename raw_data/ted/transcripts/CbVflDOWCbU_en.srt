1
0:00:12.548,000 --> 0:00:13,000
This session is on natural wonders,

2
0:00:14.255,000 --> 0:00:16,000
and the bigger conference is on the pursuit of happiness.

3
0:00:17.065,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want to try to combine them all,

4
0:00:18.712,000 --> 0:00:21,000
because to me, healing is really the ultimate natural wonder.

5
0:00:21.984,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Your body has a remarkable capacity to begin healing itself,

6
0:00:25.898,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and much more quickly than people had once realized,

7
0:00:28.577,000 --> 0:00:3,000
if you simply stop doing what's causing the problem.

8
0:00:31.494,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And so, really, so much of what we do in medicine and life in general

9
0:00:35.545,000 --> 0:00:39,000
is focused on mopping up the floor without also turning off the faucet.

10
0:00:40.106,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I love doing this work,

11
0:00:41.39,000 --> 0:00:43,000
because it really gives many people new hope and new choices

12
0:00:44.256,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that they didn't have before,

13
0:00:45.877,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and it allows us to talk about things that -- not just diet,

14
0:00:50.557,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but that happiness is not --

15
0:00:52.81,000 --> 0:00:54,000
we're talking about the pursuit of happiness,

16
0:00:54.942,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but when you really look at all the spiritual traditions,

17
0:00:57.648,000 --> 0:00:59,000
what Aldous Huxley called the "perennial wisdom,"

18
0:00:59.969,000 --> 0:01:02,000
when you get past the names and forms and rituals that divide people,

19
0:01:03.251,000 --> 0:01:05,000
it's really about -- our nature is to be happy;

20
0:01:05.734,000 --> 0:01:07,000
our nature is to be peaceful, our nature is to be healthy.

21
0:01:08.52,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And so happiness is not something you get,

22
0:01:11.368,000 --> 0:01:13,000
health is generally not something that you get,

23
0:01:13.755,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but rather, all of these different practices --

24
0:01:16.358,000 --> 0:01:19,000
you know, the ancient swamis and rabbis and priests and monks and nuns

25
0:01:19.866,000 --> 0:01:21,000
didn't develop these techniques to just manage stress

26
0:01:22.478,000 --> 0:01:24,000
or lower your blood pressure or unclog your arteries,

27
0:01:24.993,000 --> 0:01:25,000
even though it can do all those things.

28
0:01:26.902,000 --> 0:01:28,000
They're powerful tools for transformation,

29
0:01:28.959,000 --> 0:01:3,000
for quieting down our mind and bodies

30
0:01:31.282,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to allow us to experience what it feels like to be happy,

31
0:01:34.395,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to be peaceful, to be joyful

32
0:01:36.375,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and to realize that it's not something that you pursue and get,

33
0:01:39.565,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but rather, it's something that you have already, until you disturb it.

34
0:01:43.219,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I studied yoga for many years with a teacher named Swami Satchidananda.

35
0:01:47.182,000 --> 0:01:49,000
People would say, "What are you, a Hindu?"

36
0:01:49.215,000 --> 0:01:5,000
He'd say, "No, I'm an undo."

37
0:01:50.59,000 --> 0:01:51,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:51.615,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It's about identifying

39
0:01:52.808,000 --> 0:01:54,000
what's causing us to disturb our innate health and happiness

40
0:01:55.821,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and then to allow that natural healing to occur.

41
0:01:58.663,000 --> 0:02:,000
To me, that's the real natural wonder.

42
0:02:00.878,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So, within that larger context,

43
0:02:03.585,000 --> 0:02:05,000
we can talk about diet, stress management --

44
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
which are really these spiritual practices --

45
0:02:08.298,000 --> 0:02:1,000
moderate exercise, smoking cessation,

46
0:02:10.95,000 --> 0:02:12,000
support groups and community, which I'll talk more about,

47
0:02:13.669,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and some vitamins and supplements.

48
0:02:15.395,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And it's not a diet.

49
0:02:16.571,000 --> 0:02:18,000
When people think about the diet I recommend,

50
0:02:18.724,000 --> 0:02:19,000
they think it's really strict.

51
0:02:20.181,000 --> 0:02:22,000
For reversing disease, that's what it takes.

52
0:02:22.273,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But if you're just trying to be healthy, you have a spectrum of choices.

53
0:02:25.698,000 --> 0:02:27,000
To the degree that you can move in a healthy direction,

54
0:02:28.325,000 --> 0:02:31,000
you're going to live longer, feel better, lose weight, and so on.

55
0:02:31.421,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And in our studies, what we've been able to do

56
0:02:33.617,000 --> 0:02:36,000
is to use very expensive, high-tech, state-of-the-art measures

57
0:02:36.831,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost --

58
0:02:40.59,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and in many ways, ancient -- interventions can be.

59
0:02:43.6,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We first began by looking at heart disease.

60
0:02:45.639,000 --> 0:02:48,000
When I began doing this work 26 or 27 years ago,

61
0:02:48.805,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it was thought that once you have heart disease, it can only get worse.

62
0:02:52.199,000 --> 0:02:54,000
What we found was, instead of getting worse and worse,

63
0:02:54.753,000 --> 0:02:56,000
in many cases, it could get better and better,

64
0:02:56.931,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and much more quickly than people had once realized.

65
0:02:59.394,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This is a representative patient who, at the time, was 73,

66
0:03:02.776,000 --> 0:03:05,000
told he needed to have a bypass, decided to do this instead.

67
0:03:05.98,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We used quantitative arteriography, showing the narrowing.

68
0:03:08.721,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This is one of the main arteries that feeds the heart,

69
0:03:11.298,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and you can see the narrowing here.

70
0:03:13.002,000 --> 0:03:16,000
A year later, it's not as clogged; normally, it goes the other direction.

71
0:03:16.476,000 --> 0:03:17,000
These minor changes in blockages

72
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
caused a 300 percent improvement in blood flow,

73
0:03:20.741,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and using cardiac positron-emission tomography, or PET, scans --

74
0:03:24.316,000 --> 0:03:25,000
blue and black is no blood flow,

75
0:03:26.121,000 --> 0:03:27,000
orange and white is maximal --

76
0:03:27.74,000 --> 0:03:3,000
huge differences can occur without drugs, without surgery.

77
0:03:31.249,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Clinically, he couldn't walk across the street

78
0:03:33.418,000 --> 0:03:34,000
without getting severe chest pain.

79
0:03:35.065,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Within a month, like most people, he was pain-free,

80
0:03:37.53,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and within a year, climbing more than 100 floors a day on a StairMaster.

81
0:03:40.945,000 --> 0:03:41,000
This is not unusual,

82
0:03:42.122,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and it's part of what enables people to maintain these kinds of changes,

83
0:03:45.545,000 --> 0:03:47,000
because it makes a big difference in their quality of life.

84
0:03:48.339,000 --> 0:03:5,000
If you looked at all the arteries in all the patients,

85
0:03:50.9,000 --> 0:03:53,000
they got worse and worse from one year to five years in the comparison group.

86
0:03:54.573,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This is the natural history of heart disease.

87
0:03:56.698,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But it's really not natural; we found it could get better and better,

88
0:03:59.99,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and much more quickly than people thought.

89
0:04:02.062,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We also found the more people changed, the better they got.

90
0:04:04.86,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It wasn't a function of how old or sick they were,

91
0:04:07.305,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but of how much they changed.

92
0:04:09.047,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The oldest patients improved as much as the young ones.

93
0:04:11.663,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I got this Christmas card a few years ago from patients in one of our programs.

94
0:04:15.619,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The younger brother is 86; the older one is 95.

95
0:04:18.485,000 --> 0:04:2,000
They wanted to show me how much more flexible they were.

96
0:04:21.155,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The following year they sent this, which I thought was funny.

97
0:04:24.041,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:25.066,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You just never know.

99
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And what we found was that 99 percent of the patients

100
0:04:28.774,000 --> 0:04:3,000
stopped or reversed the progression of their heart disease.

101
0:04:31.655,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now, I thought if we just did good science,

102
0:04:33.687,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that would change medical practice.

103
0:04:35.386,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But that was naive.

104
0:04:36.561,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's important, but not enough,

105
0:04:38.127,000 --> 0:04:4,000
because we doctors do what we get paid to do

106
0:04:40.208,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and trained to do what we get paid to do,

107
0:04:42.19,000 --> 0:04:45,000
so if we change insurance, then we change medical practice and medical education.

108
0:04:46.032,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Insurance will cover the bypass and angioplasty

109
0:04:48.351,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but won't, until recently, cover diet and lifestyle.

110
0:04:50.821,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So we began, through our nonprofit institute, training hospitals

111
0:04:53.875,000 --> 0:04:54,000
around the country,

112
0:04:55.051,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and we found that most people could avoid surgery.

113
0:04:57.425,000 --> 0:05:,000
And not only was it medically effective, it was also cost-effective.

114
0:05:00.672,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The insurance companies found that they began to save

115
0:05:03.184,000 --> 0:05:04,000
almost 30,000 dollars a patient,

116
0:05:04.749,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and Medicare is now in the middle of doing a demonstration project,

117
0:05:07.974,000 --> 0:05:09,000
paying for 1,800 people to go through the program

118
0:05:10.408,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in the sites we train.

119
0:05:11.587,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The fortuneteller says, "I give smokers a discount,

120
0:05:14.05,000 --> 0:05:15,000
because there's not as much to tell."

121
0:05:15.863,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:17.041,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I like this slide,

123
0:05:18.216,000 --> 0:05:21,000
because it's a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change

124
0:05:21.826,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and what doesn't.

125
0:05:23.001,000 --> 0:05:26,000
What doesn't work is fear of dying, and that's what's normally used.

126
0:05:26.223,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Everybody who smokes knows it's not good for you.

127
0:05:28.549,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Still, 30 percent of Americans smoke, 80 percent in some parts of the world.

128
0:05:32.169,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Why do people do it?

129
0:05:33.767,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Well, because it helps them get through the day.

130
0:05:36.04,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I'll talk more about this,

131
0:05:37.308,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but the real epidemic isn't just heart disease or obesity or smoking,

132
0:05:40.583,000 --> 0:05:41,000
it's loneliness and depression.

133
0:05:42.102,000 --> 0:05:45,000
One woman said, "I've got 20 friends in this pack of cigarettes.

134
0:05:45.134,000 --> 0:05:47,000
They're always there for me, and nobody else is.

135
0:05:47.402,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You're going to take away my 20 friends? What are you going to give me?"

136
0:05:50.823,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Or they eat when they get depressed or use alcohol to numb the pain

137
0:05:54.038,000 --> 0:05:55,000
or work too hard or watch too much TV.

138
0:05:55.883,000 --> 0:05:58,000
There are lots of ways we have of avoiding and numbing and bypassing pain,

139
0:05:59.41,000 --> 0:06:02,000
but the point of all of this is to deal with the cause of the problem.

140
0:06:02.737,000 --> 0:06:04,000
The pain is not the problem, it's the symptom.

141
0:06:04.918,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And telling people they're going to die is too scary to think about,

142
0:06:08.146,000 --> 0:06:1,000
or that they'll get emphysema or a heart attack is too scary,

143
0:06:11.035,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and they don't want to think about it, so they don't.

144
0:06:13.538,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The most effective anti-smoking ad was this one.

145
0:06:16.376,000 --> 0:06:18,000
You'll notice the limp cigarette hanging out of his mouth.

146
0:06:19.132,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And the headline is "Impotent," it's not "Emphysema."

147
0:06:21.758,000 --> 0:06:23,000
What was the biggest-selling drug of all time,

148
0:06:23.992,000 --> 0:06:24,000
when it was introduced a few years ago?

149
0:06:25.906,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Viagra, right? Why? Because a lot of guys need it.

150
0:06:28.281,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's not like you say, "Joe, I'm having erectile dysfunction. How about you?"

151
0:06:31.956,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And yet, look at the number of prescriptions that are being sold.

152
0:06:35.065,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It's not so much psychological, it's vascular,

153
0:06:37.234,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and nicotine makes your arteries constrict.

154
0:06:39.27,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So does cocaine, so does a high-fat diet, so does emotional stress.

155
0:06:43.177,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So the very behaviors that we think of as being so sexy in our culture

156
0:06:46.84,000 --> 0:06:48,000
are the very ones that leave so many people feeling tired,

157
0:06:49.593,000 --> 0:06:5,000
lethargic, depressed and impotent.

158
0:06:51.303,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And that's not much fun.

159
0:06:52.478,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But when you change those behaviors, your brain gets more blood,

160
0:06:55.513,000 --> 0:06:56,000
you think more clearly, have more energy,

161
0:06:57.519,000 --> 0:06:59,000
your heart gets more blood, as I've shown you.

162
0:06:59.694,000 --> 0:07:,000
Your sexual function improves.

163
0:07:01.156,000 --> 0:07:02,000
These things occur within hours.

164
0:07:02.711,000 --> 0:07:03,000
This is a study: a high-fat meal,

165
0:07:04.308,000 --> 0:07:06,000
within one or two hours, blood flow is measurably less.

166
0:07:06.916,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And you've all experienced this at Thanksgiving.

167
0:07:09.182,000 --> 0:07:11,000
When you eat a big fatty meal, how do you feel?

168
0:07:11.4,000 --> 0:07:12,000
You feel kind of sleepy afterwards.

169
0:07:13.102,000 --> 0:07:16,000
On a low-fat meal, the blood flow doesn't go down -- it even goes up.

170
0:07:16.375,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Many of you have kids, and you know that's a big change in your lifestyle.

171
0:07:19.88,000 --> 0:07:21,000
People are not afraid to make big changes in lifestyle

172
0:07:22.435,000 --> 0:07:23,000
if they're worth it.

173
0:07:23.632,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And the paradox is that when you make big changes, you get big benefits,

174
0:07:27.086,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and you feel so much better so quickly.

175
0:07:29.237,000 --> 0:07:31,000
For many people, those are choices worth making --

176
0:07:31.622,000 --> 0:07:33,000
not to live longer, but to live better.

177
0:07:33.794,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I want to talk a little bit about the obesity epidemic,

178
0:07:36.409,000 --> 0:07:37,000
because it really is a problem.

179
0:07:38.261,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Two-thirds of adults are overweight or obese,

180
0:07:40.955,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and diabetes in kids and 30-year-olds

181
0:07:43.641,000 --> 0:07:45,000
has increased 70 percent in the last 10 years.

182
0:07:45.835,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It's no joke, it's real.

183
0:07:47.382,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And just to show you this, this is from the CDC.

184
0:07:49.984,000 --> 0:07:5,000
These are not election returns;

185
0:07:51.488,000 --> 0:07:53,000
these are the percentage of people who are overweight.

186
0:07:54.038,000 --> 0:08:,000
And if you see from '85 to '86 to '87, '88, '89, '90, '91 --

187
0:08:00.596,000 --> 0:08:02,000
you get a new category, 15 to 20 percent;

188
0:08:02.981,000 --> 0:08:08,000
'92, '93, '94, '95, '96, '97 -- you get a new category;

189
0:08:09.126,000 --> 0:08:12,000
'98, '99, 2000 and 2001.

190
0:08:12.617,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Mississippi, more than 25 percent of people are overweight.

191
0:08:15.985,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Why is this? Well, this is one way to lose weight that works very well --

192
0:08:19.441,000 --> 0:08:2,000
(Laughter)

193
0:08:20.47,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but it doesn't last, which is the problem.

194
0:08:22.495,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

195
0:08:23.521,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now, there's no mystery in how you lose weight;

196
0:08:25.737,000 --> 0:08:27,000
you either burn more calories by exercise

197
0:08:27.783,000 --> 0:08:28,000
or you eat fewer calories.

198
0:08:29.103,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Now, one way to eat fewer calories is to eat less food,

199
0:08:32.104,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which is why you can lose weight on any diet if you eat less food,

200
0:08:35.225,000 --> 0:08:37,000
or if you restrict entire categories of foods.

201
0:08:37.412,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But the problem is, you get hungry, so it's hard to keep it off.

202
0:08:40.449,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The other way is to change the type of food.

203
0:08:42.53,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And fat has nine calories per gram,

204
0:08:44.244,000 --> 0:08:45,000
whereas protein and carbs only have four.

205
0:08:46.245,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So when you eat less fat, you eat fewer calories without having to eat less food.

206
0:08:50.246,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So you can eat the same amount of food,

207
0:08:52.134,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but you're getting fewer calories

208
0:08:53.744,000 --> 0:08:55,000
because the food is less dense in calories.

209
0:08:55.781,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And it's the volume of food that affects satiety, rather than the type.

210
0:08:59.152,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I don't like talking about the Atkins diet, but I get asked about it,

211
0:09:02.43,000 --> 0:09:03,000
so thought I'd spend a few minutes on it.

212
0:09:04.42,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The myth that you hear is, Americans have been told to eat less fat,

213
0:09:07.653,000 --> 0:09:08,000
the percent of calories from fat is down,

214
0:09:09.655,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Americans are fatter than ever, therefore fat doesn't make you fat.

215
0:09:12.828,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It's a half-truth.

216
0:09:14.004,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Actually, Americans are eating more fat than ever, and even more carbs.

217
0:09:17.384,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So the percentage is lower, but the actual amount is higher,

218
0:09:20.233,000 --> 0:09:21,000
so the goal is to reduce both.

219
0:09:21.734,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Dr. Atkins and I debated each other many times before he died,

220
0:09:24.761,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and we agreed that Americans eat too many simple carbs, the "bad carbs."

221
0:09:28.44,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And these are things like --

222
0:09:29.818,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

223
0:09:30.848,000 --> 0:09:32,000
sugar, white flour, white rice, alcohol.

224
0:09:33.146,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And you get a double whammy:

225
0:09:34.505,000 --> 0:09:36,000
you get all these calories that don't fill you up

226
0:09:36.828,000 --> 0:09:37,000
because you've removed the fiber,

227
0:09:38.431,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and they get absorbed quickly so your blood sugar zooms up.

228
0:09:41.251,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Your pancreas makes insulin to bring it back down, which is good,

229
0:09:44.332,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but insulin accelerates the conversion of calories into fat.

230
0:09:47.17,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So the goal is not to go to pork rinds, bacon and sausages --

231
0:09:50.084,000 --> 0:09:51,000
these are not health foods --

232
0:09:51.516,000 --> 0:09:53,000
but to go from "bad carbs" to "good carbs."

233
0:09:53.56,000 --> 0:09:55,000
These are things like whole foods or unrefined carbs.

234
0:09:56.078,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Fruits, vegetables, whole wheat flour, brown rice,

235
0:09:58.49,000 --> 0:10:,000
in their natural forms, are rich in fiber.

236
0:10:00.825,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The fiber fills you up before you get too many calories

237
0:10:03.598,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and it slows the absorption,

238
0:10:04.999,000 --> 0:10:06,000
so you don't get that rapid rise in blood sugar.

239
0:10:07.343,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And you get all the disease-protective substances.

240
0:10:09.728,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It's not just what you exclude from your diet,

241
0:10:11.896,000 --> 0:10:13,000
but also what you include that's protective.

242
0:10:13.994,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Just as all carbs are not bad for you, all fats are not bad; there are good fats.

243
0:10:17.831,000 --> 0:10:19,000
These are predominantly what are called omega-3 fatty acids.

244
0:10:20.674,000 --> 0:10:21,000
You find them, for example, in fish oil.

245
0:10:22.604,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Bad fats are things like trans-fatty acids in processed food

246
0:10:25.456,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and saturated fats, which we find in meat.

247
0:10:27.485,000 --> 0:10:29,000
If you remember nothing else from this talk:

248
0:10:29.566,000 --> 0:10:32,000
three grams a day of fish oil can reduce the risk of heart attack and sudden death

249
0:10:33.499,000 --> 0:10:34,000
by 50 to 80 percent.

250
0:10:34.675,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Three grams a day.

251
0:10:35.851,000 --> 0:10:36,000
They come in one-gram capsules;

252
0:10:37.354,000 --> 0:10:39,000
more than that just gives you extra fat you don't need.

253
0:10:39.958,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It also helps reduce the risk of the most common cancers,

254
0:10:42.652,000 --> 0:10:43,000
like breast, prostate and colon.

255
0:10:44.232,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The problem with the Atkins diet is,

256
0:10:45.986,000 --> 0:10:47,000
everyone knows people who've lost weight on it,

257
0:10:48.227,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but you can lose weight on amphetamines and fen-phen;

258
0:10:50.741,000 --> 0:10:53,000
there are lots of ways of losing weight that aren't good for you.

259
0:10:53.829,000 --> 0:10:55,000
You want to do it in a way that enhances your health,

260
0:10:56.338,000 --> 0:10:57,000
not one that harms it.

261
0:10:57.52,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The problem is, it's based on this half-truth:

262
0:10:59.702,000 --> 0:11:,000
Americans eat too many simple carbs,

263
0:11:01.455,000 --> 0:11:02,000
so if you eat fewer, you'll lose weight,

264
0:11:03.42,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and even more weight if you eat whole foods and less fat,

265
0:11:06.128,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and you'll enhance your health rather than harming it.

266
0:11:08.681,000 --> 0:11:09,000
He says, "I've got good news.

267
0:11:10.092,000 --> 0:11:12,000
While your cholesterol level has remained the same,

268
0:11:12.5,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the research findings have changed."

269
0:11:14.261,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Laughter)

270
0:11:15.288,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Now what happens to your heart when you go on an Atkins diet?

271
0:11:18.328,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The red is good; at the beginning and a year later.

272
0:11:20.809,000 --> 0:11:23,000
This is from a study in a peer-reviewed journal called "Angiology."

273
0:11:24.052,000 --> 0:11:27,000
There's more red after a year on a diet like I would recommend,

274
0:11:27.187,000 --> 0:11:3,000
there's less red, less blood flow after a year on an Atkins-type diet.

275
0:11:30.634,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So, yes, you can lose weight, but your heart isn't happy.

276
0:11:34.427,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Now one of the studies funded by the Atkins Center

277
0:11:36.839,000 --> 0:11:38,000
found that 70 percent of the people were constipated,

278
0:11:39.353,000 --> 0:11:4,000
65 percent had bad breath,

279
0:11:40.64,000 --> 0:11:41,000
54 percent had headaches --

280
0:11:42.061,000 --> 0:11:43,000
this is not a healthy way to eat.

281
0:11:43.887,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So you might start to lose weight and start to attract people towards you,

282
0:11:47.392,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but when they get too close, it's going to be a problem.

283
0:11:50.038,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Laughter)

284
0:11:51.067,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And more seriously, there are case reports now of 16-year-old girls

285
0:11:54.265,000 --> 0:11:56,000
who died after a few weeks on the Atkins diet,

286
0:11:56.44,000 --> 0:11:58,000
of bone disease, kidney disease, and so on.

287
0:11:58.475,000 --> 0:12:,000
And that's how your body excretes waste --

288
0:12:00.506,000 --> 0:12:02,000
through your breath, bowels and perspiration.

289
0:12:02.648,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So when you go on these kinds of diet, they begin to smell bad.

290
0:12:05.627,000 --> 0:12:07,000
An optimal diet is low in fat, low in the bad carbs,

291
0:12:08.557,000 --> 0:12:1,000
high in the good carbs and enough of the good fats.

292
0:12:11.465,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And then, again, it's a spectrum:

293
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
when you move in this direction, you're going to lose weight,

294
0:12:16.068,000 --> 0:12:18,000
you'll feel better, and you'll gain health.

295
0:12:18.102,000 --> 0:12:21,000
There are ecological reasons for eating lower on the food chain too,

296
0:12:21.394,000 --> 0:12:23,000
whether it's the deforestation in the Amazon

297
0:12:23.49,000 --> 0:12:24,000
or making more protein available

298
0:12:25.04,000 --> 0:12:27,000
to the four billion people who live on a dollar a day,

299
0:12:27.702,000 --> 0:12:29,000
not to mention whatever ethical concerns people have.

300
0:12:30.651,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So there are lots of reasons for eating this way

301
0:12:32.94,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that go beyond just your health.

302
0:12:34.508,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Now, we're about to publish the first study

303
0:12:36.538,000 --> 0:12:39,000
looking at the effects of this program on prostate cancer,

304
0:12:39.849,000 --> 0:12:42,000
in collaboration with Sloan Kettering and UCSF.

305
0:12:43.628,000 --> 0:12:46,000
We took 90 men who had biopsy-proven prostate cancer,

306
0:12:46.777,000 --> 0:12:49,000
who had elected, for reasons unrelated to the study, not to have surgery.

307
0:12:50.241,000 --> 0:12:52,000
We could randomly divide them into two groups,

308
0:12:52.42,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and then we could have one group

309
0:12:54.076,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that is a nonintervention control group to compare to,

310
0:12:56.711,000 --> 0:12:58,000
which you can't do with, say, breast cancer,

311
0:12:58.797,000 --> 0:12:59,000
because everyone gets treated.

312
0:13:00.258,000 --> 0:13:01,000
We found that after a year,

313
0:13:01.581,000 --> 0:13:04,000
none of the experimental group patients who made these lifestyle changes

314
0:13:05,000 --> 0:13:06,000
needed treatment,

315
0:13:06.175,000 --> 0:13:09,000
while six of the control group patients needed surgery or radiation.

316
0:13:09.391,000 --> 0:13:12,000
When we looked at their PSA levels, which is a marker for prostate cancer,

317
0:13:12.893,000 --> 0:13:15,000
they got worse in the control group but got better in the experimental group.

318
0:13:16.538,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And the differences were highly significant.

319
0:13:18.618,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I wondered -- was there any relationship

320
0:13:20.618,000 --> 0:13:22,000
between how much people changed their diet and lifestyle,

321
0:13:23.317,000 --> 0:13:24,000
whichever group they were in,

322
0:13:24.724,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and the changes in PSA?

323
0:13:25.899,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And sure enough, we found a dose-response relationship,

324
0:13:28.504,000 --> 0:13:31,000
just like we did in the arterial blockages in our cardiac studies.

325
0:13:31.631,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And in order for the PSA to go down, they had to make big changes.

326
0:13:34.901,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I then wondered if they're just changing their PSA,

327
0:13:37.314,000 --> 0:13:39,000
but it's not really affecting the tumor growth.

328
0:13:39.536,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So we took some of their blood serum and sent it to UCLA.

329
0:13:42.237,000 --> 0:13:44,000
They added it to a standard line of prostate tumor cells

330
0:13:44.888,000 --> 0:13:45,000
growing in tissue culture,

331
0:13:46.158,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and it inhibited the growth seven times more in the experimental group

332
0:13:49.477,000 --> 0:13:51,000
than in the control group -- 70 versus 9 percent.

333
0:13:51.797,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Finally, I wondered if there's any relationship

334
0:13:54.016,000 --> 0:13:55,000
between how much people changed

335
0:13:55.524,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and how much it inhibited their tumor growth,

336
0:13:57.652,000 --> 0:13:58,000
whichever group they were in.

337
0:13:59.059,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And this really got me excited because again,

338
0:14:01.18,000 --> 0:14:03,000
we found the same pattern: the more people change,

339
0:14:03.546,000 --> 0:14:05,000
the more it affected the growth of their tumors.

340
0:14:05.812,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Finally, we did MRI and MR spectroscopy scans on some of these patients.

341
0:14:09.223,000 --> 0:14:11,000
The tumor activity is shown in red in this patient,

342
0:14:11.63,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and you can see clearly it's better a year later, along with the PSA going down.

343
0:14:15.418,000 --> 0:14:16,000
If it's true for prostate cancer,

344
0:14:17.016,000 --> 0:14:19,000
it'll almost certainly be true for breast cancer.

345
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And whether or not you have conventional treatment,

346
0:14:21.744,000 --> 0:14:24,000
in addition, if you make these changes, it may help reduce the risk of recurrence.

347
0:14:25.63,000 --> 0:14:26,000
The last thing I want to talk about,

348
0:14:27.372,000 --> 0:14:29,000
apropos of the issue of the pursuit of happiness,

349
0:14:29.697,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is that study after study has shown

350
0:14:31.705,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that people who are lonely and depressed --

351
0:14:33.783,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and depression is the other real epidemic in our culture --

352
0:14:36.57,000 --> 0:14:38,000
are many times more likely to get sick and die prematurely,

353
0:14:39.357,000 --> 0:14:42,000
in part because, as we talked about, they're more likely to smoke,

354
0:14:42.478,000 --> 0:14:44,000
overeat, drink too much, work too hard, and so on.

355
0:14:44.887,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But also, through mechanisms that we don't fully understand,

356
0:14:47.841,000 --> 0:14:49,000
people who are lonely and depressed are many times --

357
0:14:50.35,000 --> 0:14:52,000
three to five to ten times in some studies --

358
0:14:52.471,000 --> 0:14:54,000
more likely to get sick and die prematurely.

359
0:14:54.551,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And depression is treatable. We need to do something about that.

360
0:14:57.583,000 --> 0:15:,000
Now on the other hand, anything that promotes intimacy is healing.

361
0:15:00.752,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It can be sexual intimacy --

362
0:15:02.119,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I happen to think healing energy and erotic energy

363
0:15:04.523,000 --> 0:15:06,000
are just different forms of the same thing.

364
0:15:06.826,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Friendship, altruism, compassion, service --

365
0:15:09.684,000 --> 0:15:11,000
all the perennial truths that we talked about

366
0:15:11.808,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that are part of all religion and all cultures,

367
0:15:14.029,000 --> 0:15:16,000
once you stop trying to see the differences --

368
0:15:16.199,000 --> 0:15:18,000
these are the things that are in our own self-interest,

369
0:15:18.803,000 --> 0:15:21,000
because they free us from our suffering and our disease.

370
0:15:22.132,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And it's, in a sense, the most selfish thing that we can do.

371
0:15:25.636,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Just to look at one study, done by David Spiegel at Stanford.

372
0:15:29.077,000 --> 0:15:31,000
He took women with metastatic breast cancer,

373
0:15:31.197,000 --> 0:15:32,000
randomly divided them into two groups.

374
0:15:33.057,000 --> 0:15:36,000
One group met for an hour and a half once a week in a support group.

375
0:15:36.376,000 --> 0:15:37,000
It was a nurturing, loving environment,

376
0:15:38.267,000 --> 0:15:4,000
where they were encouraged to let down their emotional defenses

377
0:15:41.253,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and talk about how awful it is to have breast cancer

378
0:15:43.715,000 --> 0:15:46,000
with people who understood because they were going through it too.

379
0:15:46.909,000 --> 0:15:47,000
They met once a week for a year.

380
0:15:48.465,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Five years later, those women lived twice as long.

381
0:15:50.841,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And that was the only difference between the groups.

382
0:15:53.3,000 --> 0:15:55,000
It was a randomized control study published in "The Lancet."

383
0:15:56.145,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Other studies have shown this as well.

384
0:15:57.987,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So these simple things that create intimacy are really healing.

385
0:16:00.97,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Even the word "healing" comes from the root "to make whole."

386
0:16:03.817,000 --> 0:16:05,000
The word "yoga" comes from the Sanskrit, meaning "union,"

387
0:16:06.51,000 --> 0:16:07,000
"to yoke, to bring together."

388
0:16:07.92,000 --> 0:16:09,000
The last slide I want to show you is from -- again,

389
0:16:10.34,000 --> 0:16:12,000
this swami that I studied with for so many years.

390
0:16:12.685,000 --> 0:16:14,000
I did a combined oncology and cardiology grand rounds

391
0:16:15.196,000 --> 0:16:18,000
at the University of Virginia medical school a couple years ago.

392
0:16:18.223,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And at the end of it, somebody said,

393
0:16:19.971,000 --> 0:16:22,000
"Hey, Swami, what's the difference between wellness and illness?"

394
0:16:23.588,000 --> 0:16:25,000
So he went up on the board and wrote the word "illness"

395
0:16:26.193,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and circled the first letter,

396
0:16:27.606,000 --> 0:16:28,000
then wrote the word "wellness,"

397
0:16:29.109,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and circled the first two letters.

398
0:16:30.758,000 --> 0:16:32,000
To me, it's just shorthand for what we're talking about:

399
0:16:33.41,000 --> 0:16:36,000
that anything that creates a sense of connection and community and love

400
0:16:36.812,000 --> 0:16:37,000
is really healing.

401
0:16:37.992,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And then we can enjoy our lives more fully without getting sick in the process.

402
0:16:42.089,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Thank you.

403
0:16:43.272,000 --> 0:16:44,000
(Applause)

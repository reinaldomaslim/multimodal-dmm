1
0:00:15.95,000 --> 0:00:17,000
How can I speak in 10 minutes

2
0:00:18.205,000 --> 0:00:21,000
about the bonds of women over three generations,

3
0:00:21.773,000 --> 0:00:24,000
about how the astonishing strength of those bonds

4
0:00:24.848,000 --> 0:00:26,000
took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl

5
0:00:28.485,000 --> 0:00:32,000
huddled with her young sister, her mother and her grandmother

6
0:00:33.34,000 --> 0:00:36,000
for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea

7
0:00:37.19,000 --> 0:00:38,000
more than 30 years ago.

8
0:00:39.733,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl

9
0:00:42.311,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and never let go --

10
0:00:44.767,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that small girl now living in San Francisco

11
0:00:47.389,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and speaking to you today.

12
0:00:50.199,000 --> 0:00:51,000
This is not a finished story.

13
0:00:52.785,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together.

14
0:00:56.377,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.

15
0:01:00.216,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Imagine the first piece: a man burning his life's work.

16
0:01:04.934,000 --> 0:01:07,000
He is a poet, a playwright,

17
0:01:08.227,000 --> 0:01:09,000
a man whose whole life

18
0:01:09.533,000 --> 0:01:13,000
had been balanced on the single hope of his country's unity and freedom.

19
0:01:14.513,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon --

20
0:01:17.825,000 --> 0:01:2,000
confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste.

21
0:01:21.71,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Words, for so long his friends, now mocked him.

22
0:01:25.511,000 --> 0:01:26,000
He retreated into silence.

23
0:01:27.987,000 --> 0:01:29,000
He died broken by history.

24
0:01:31.702,000 --> 0:01:32,000
He is my grandfather.

25
0:01:34.347,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I never knew him in real life.

26
0:01:38.271,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But our lives are much more than our memories.

27
0:01:41.67,000 --> 0:01:43,000
My grandmother never let me forget his life.

28
0:01:44.925,000 --> 0:01:47,000
My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain,

29
0:01:48.066,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and my lesson was to learn that, yes, history tried to crush us,

30
0:01:52.57,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but we endured.

31
0:01:55.276,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn

32
0:01:58.815,000 --> 0:01:59,000
slipping silently out to sea.

33
0:02:02.091,000 --> 0:02:04,000
My mother, Mai, was 18 when her father died --

34
0:02:05.582,000 --> 0:02:07,000
already in an arranged marriage,

35
0:02:07.788,000 --> 0:02:08,000
already with two small girls.

36
0:02:10.781,000 --> 0:02:13,000
For her, life had distilled itself into one task:

37
0:02:14.486,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the escape of her family and a new life in Australia.

38
0:02:18.75,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed.

39
0:02:22.934,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So after a four-year saga that defies fiction,

40
0:02:25.86,000 --> 0:02:28,000
a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel.

41
0:02:30.673,000 --> 0:02:31,000
All the adults knew the risks.

42
0:02:33.618,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The greatest fear was of pirates, rape and death.

43
0:02:38.256,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Like most adults on the boat,

44
0:02:40.172,000 --> 0:02:42,000
my mother carried a small bottle of poison.

45
0:02:43.731,000 --> 0:02:46,000
If we were captured, first my sister and I,

46
0:02:47.026,000 --> 0:02:49,000
then she and my grandmother would drink.

47
0:02:50.727,000 --> 0:02:52,000
My first memories are from the boat --

48
0:02:53.533,000 --> 0:02:54,000
the steady beat of the engine,

49
0:02:55.342,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the bow dipping into each wave,

50
0:02:58.177,000 --> 0:03:,000
the vast and empty horizon.

51
0:03:01.305,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I don't remember the pirates who came many times,

52
0:03:03.832,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat,

53
0:03:07.894,000 --> 0:03:1,000
or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours.

54
0:03:12.509,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast

55
0:03:17.043,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and the young man who collapsed and died,

56
0:03:19.801,000 --> 0:03:21,000
the journey's end too much for him,

57
0:03:23.339,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and the first apple I tasted, given to me by the men on the rig.

58
0:03:27.846,000 --> 0:03:29,000
No apple has ever tasted the same.

59
0:03:33.445,000 --> 0:03:36,000
After three months in a refugee camp, we landed in Melbourne.

60
0:03:37.507,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women

61
0:03:40.051,000 --> 0:03:43,000
across three generations shaping a new life together.

62
0:03:45.375,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We settled in Footscray,

63
0:03:47.422,000 --> 0:03:5,000
a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants.

64
0:03:51.771,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs, whose existence I was oblivious of,

65
0:03:56.096,000 --> 0:03:58,000
there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray.

66
0:03:59.163,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world.

67
0:04:02.369,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And the snippets of halting English

68
0:04:04.077,000 --> 0:04:07,000
were exchanged between people who had one thing in common:

69
0:04:07.744,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They were starting again.

70
0:04:10.713,000 --> 0:04:11,000
My mother worked on farms,

71
0:04:12.572,000 --> 0:04:13,000
then on a car assembly line,

72
0:04:14.234,000 --> 0:04:16,000
working six days, double shifts.

73
0:04:17.394,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Somehow, she found time to study English

74
0:04:19.526,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and gain IT qualifications.

75
0:04:22.514,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We were poor.

76
0:04:24.624,000 --> 0:04:25,000
All the dollars were allocated

77
0:04:26.4,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for

78
0:04:29.822,000 --> 0:04:3,000
regardless of what missed out,

79
0:04:32.869,000 --> 0:04:33,000
which was usually new clothes;

80
0:04:35.37,000 --> 0:04:36,000
they were always secondhand.

81
0:04:37.601,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Two pairs of stockings for school,

82
0:04:39.611,000 --> 0:04:4,000
each to hide the holes in the other.

83
0:04:42.234,000 --> 0:04:46,000
A school uniform down to the ankles, because it had to last for six years.

84
0:04:48.016,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And there were rare but searing chants of "slit-eye"

85
0:04:52.001,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and the occasional graffiti:

86
0:04:53.755,000 --> 0:04:54,000
"Asian, go home."

87
0:04:55.946,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Go home to where?

88
0:04:58.229,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Something stiffened inside me.

89
0:05:00.66,000 --> 0:05:02,000
There was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying,

90
0:05:04.061,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"I will bypass you."

91
0:05:07.244,000 --> 0:05:1,000
My mother, my sister and I slept in the same bed.

92
0:05:11.911,000 --> 0:05:13,000
My mother was exhausted each night,

93
0:05:14.172,000 --> 0:05:16,000
but we told one another about our day

94
0:05:16.253,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house.

95
0:05:20.415,000 --> 0:05:22,000
My mother suffered from nightmares, all about the boat.

96
0:05:24.748,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came

97
0:05:27.786,000 --> 0:05:28,000
so I could wake her.

98
0:05:31.301,000 --> 0:05:32,000
She opened a computer store,

99
0:05:33.137,000 --> 0:05:35,000
then studied to be a beautician and opened another business.

100
0:05:36.739,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And the women came with their stories

101
0:05:38.542,000 --> 0:05:4,000
about men who could not make the transition,

102
0:05:41.202,000 --> 0:05:42,000
angry and inflexible,

103
0:05:42.98,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and troubled children caught between two worlds.

104
0:05:46.424,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Grants and sponsors were sought.

105
0:05:48.461,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Centers were established.

106
0:05:51.2,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I lived in parallel worlds.

107
0:05:53.34,000 --> 0:05:56,000
In one, I was the classic Asian student,

108
0:05:56.402,000 --> 0:05:58,000
relentless in the demands that I made on myself.

109
0:05:59.83,000 --> 0:06:02,000
In the other, I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious,

110
0:06:02.949,000 --> 0:06:05,000
tragically scarred by violence, drug abuse and isolation.

111
0:06:07.979,000 --> 0:06:09,000
But so many over the years were helped.

112
0:06:10.041,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And for that work, when I was a final-year law student,

113
0:06:12.977,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I was chosen as the Young Australian of the Year.

114
0:06:15.562,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another,

115
0:06:19.514,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and their edges didn't fit.

116
0:06:22.073,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Tan Le, anonymous Footscray resident,

117
0:06:24.344,000 --> 0:06:27,000
was now Tan Le, refugee and social activist,

118
0:06:27.697,000 --> 0:06:3,000
invited to speak in venues she had never heard of

119
0:06:31.142,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined.

120
0:06:35.573,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I didn't know the protocols.

121
0:06:37.665,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I didn't know how to use the cutlery.

122
0:06:40.374,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I didn't know how to talk about wine.

123
0:06:42.764,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I didn't know how to talk about anything.

124
0:06:46.696,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort

125
0:06:49.637,000 --> 0:06:51,000
of life in an unsung suburb --

126
0:06:52.745,000 --> 0:06:54,000
a grandmother, a mother and two daughters

127
0:06:55.391,000 --> 0:06:58,000
ending each day as they had for almost 20 years,

128
0:06:59.104,000 --> 0:07:01,000
telling one another the story of their day

129
0:07:01.58,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and falling asleep, the three of us still in the same bed.

130
0:07:07.398,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I told my mother I couldn't do it.

131
0:07:10.974,000 --> 0:07:13,000
She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been

132
0:07:14.446,000 --> 0:07:15,000
when we boarded the boat.

133
0:07:16.808,000 --> 0:07:17,000
"No" had never been an option.

134
0:07:20.139,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"Just do it," she said,

135
0:07:21.49,000 --> 0:07:22,000
"and don't be what you're not."

136
0:07:24.397,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education

137
0:07:27.645,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and the neglect of the marginalized and disenfranchised.

138
0:07:31.136,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And the more candidly I spoke, the more I was asked to speak.

139
0:07:36.517,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I met people from all walks of life,

140
0:07:38.613,000 --> 0:07:4,000
so many of them doing the thing they loved,

141
0:07:41.187,000 --> 0:07:43,000
living on the frontiers of possibility.

142
0:07:43.834,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And even though I finished my degree,

143
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I realized I could not settle into a career in law.

144
0:07:49.937,000 --> 0:07:51,000
There had to be another piece of the jigsaw.

145
0:07:53.206,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And I realized, at the same time,

146
0:07:55.562,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that it is OK to be an outsider,

147
0:07:58.234,000 --> 0:07:59,000
a recent arrival,

148
0:07:59.996,000 --> 0:08:,000
new on the scene --

149
0:08:01.885,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and not just OK,

150
0:08:03.637,000 --> 0:08:05,000
but something to be thankful for,

151
0:08:05.931,000 --> 0:08:06,000
perhaps a gift from the boat.

152
0:08:08.552,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons,

153
0:08:13.15,000 --> 0:08:16,000
can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province.

154
0:08:18.228,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now

155
0:08:20.659,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to know that, yes, the world does fall apart,

156
0:08:23.403,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but not in the way that you fear.

157
0:08:25.813,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Possibilities that would not have been allowed

158
0:08:28.117,000 --> 0:08:29,000
were outrageously encouraged.

159
0:08:30.296,000 --> 0:08:31,000
There was an energy there,

160
0:08:31.795,000 --> 0:08:32,000
an implacable optimism,

161
0:08:33.874,000 --> 0:08:35,000
a strange mixture of humility and daring.

162
0:08:37.566,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So I followed my hunches.

163
0:08:39.337,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I gathered around me a small team of people

164
0:08:41.847,000 --> 0:08:44,000
for whom the label "It can't be done" was an irresistible challenge.

165
0:08:46.635,000 --> 0:08:47,000
For a year, we were penniless.

166
0:08:48.672,000 --> 0:08:5,000
At the end of each day, I made a huge pot of soup

167
0:08:51.038,000 --> 0:08:52,000
which we all shared.

168
0:08:53.207,000 --> 0:08:54,000
We worked well into each night.

169
0:08:55.588,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Most of our ideas were crazy,

170
0:08:57.873,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but a few were brilliant,

171
0:08:59.705,000 --> 0:09:,000
and we broke through.

172
0:09:02.809,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I made the decision to move to the US after only one trip.

173
0:09:06.98,000 --> 0:09:07,000
My hunches again.

174
0:09:08.926,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Three months later, I had relocated, and the adventure has continued.

175
0:09:14.917,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Before I close, though, let me tell you about my grandmother.

176
0:09:19.278,000 --> 0:09:22,000
She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm

177
0:09:22.925,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and the local mandarin was the person who mattered.

178
0:09:26.207,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Life hadn't changed for centuries.

179
0:09:29.309,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Her father died soon after she was born.

180
0:09:32.936,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Her mother raised her alone.

181
0:09:35.952,000 --> 0:09:39,000
At 17, she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her.

182
0:09:41.991,000 --> 0:09:42,000
With no support from her husband,

183
0:09:44.009,000 --> 0:09:46,000
she caused a sensation by taking him to court

184
0:09:46.739,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and prosecuting her own case,

185
0:09:48.995,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and a far greater sensation when she won.

186
0:09:51.746,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Laughter)

187
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Applause)

188
0:09:58.331,000 --> 0:10:,000
"It can't be done" was shown to be wrong.

189
0:10:03.885,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney

190
0:10:06.937,000 --> 0:10:07,000
the moment she died,

191
0:10:08.52,000 --> 0:10:1,000
600 miles away, in Melbourne.

192
0:10:12.363,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side.

193
0:10:16.518,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I knew she had come to say goodbye.

194
0:10:19.215,000 --> 0:10:2,000
My mother phoned minutes later.

195
0:10:22.576,000 --> 0:10:23,000
A few days later,

196
0:10:23.89,000 --> 0:10:26,000
we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket.

197
0:10:28.236,000 --> 0:10:31,000
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her.

198
0:10:32.985,000 --> 0:10:36,000
At midnight, the monk came and told us he had to close the casket.

199
0:10:38.658,000 --> 0:10:4,000
My mother asked us to feel her hand.

200
0:10:41.814,000 --> 0:10:42,000
She asked the monk,

201
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
"Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold?"

202
0:10:48.938,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"Because you have been holding it since this morning," he said.

203
0:10:52.939,000 --> 0:10:53,000
"You have not let it go."

204
0:10:57.502,000 --> 0:11:,000
If there is a sinew in our family, it runs through the women.

205
0:11:02.36,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Given who we were and how life had shaped us,

206
0:11:05.337,000 --> 0:11:08,000
we can now see that the men that might have come into our lives

207
0:11:08.703,000 --> 0:11:09,000
would have thwarted us.

208
0:11:10.626,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Defeat would have come too easily.

209
0:11:13.85,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now I would like to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.

210
0:11:19.052,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Who could ever wish it on their own?

211
0:11:22.197,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Yet I am afraid of privilege,

212
0:11:24.367,000 --> 0:11:25,000
of ease,

213
0:11:25.597,000 --> 0:11:26,000
of entitlement.

214
0:11:27.717,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Can I give them a bow in their lives, dipping bravely into each wave,

215
0:11:32.778,000 --> 0:11:34,000
the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine,

216
0:11:36.149,000 --> 0:11:38,000
the vast horizon that guarantees nothing?

217
0:11:40.699,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I don't know.

218
0:11:42.492,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But if I could give it

219
0:11:43.913,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and still see them safely through,

220
0:11:46.251,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I would.

221
0:11:48.585,000 --> 0:11:55,000
(Applause)

222
0:12:01.354,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Trevor Neilson: And also, Tan's mother is here today,

223
0:12:04.642,000 --> 0:12:05,000
in the fourth or fifth row.

224
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm going to talk to you about some stuff that's in this book of mine

2
0:00:28.428,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that I hope will resonate with other things you've already heard,

3
0:00:31.57,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I'll try to make some connections myself,

4
0:00:33.808,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in case you miss them.

5
0:00:35.478,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But I want to start with what I call the "official dogma."

6
0:00:39.983,000 --> 0:00:4,000
The official dogma of what?

7
0:00:41.471,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The official dogma of all Western industrial societies.

8
0:00:44.843,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And the official dogma runs like this:

9
0:00:47.146,000 --> 0:00:51,000
if we are interested in maximizing the welfare of our citizens,

10
0:00:51.839,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the way to do that is to maximize individual freedom.

11
0:00:57.965,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The reason for this is both that freedom is, in and of itself, good,

12
0:01:02.159,000 --> 0:01:05,000
valuable, worthwhile, essential to being human,

13
0:01:05.597,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and because if people have freedom,

14
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
then each of us can act on our own

15
0:01:10.387,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to do the things that will maximize our welfare,

16
0:01:12.705,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and no one has to decide on our behalf.

17
0:01:15.771,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice.

18
0:01:20.738,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The more choice people have, the more freedom they have,

19
0:01:24.618,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and the more freedom they have,

20
0:01:26.245,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the more welfare they have.

21
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This, I think, is so deeply embedded in the water supply

22
0:01:34.531,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that it wouldn't occur to anyone to question it.

23
0:01:38.379,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And it's also deeply embedded in our lives.

24
0:01:42.711,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I'll give you some examples

25
0:01:44.433,000 --> 0:01:47,000
of what modern progress has made possible for us.

26
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:49,000
This is my supermarket.

27
0:01:49.854,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Not such a big one.

28
0:01:51.84,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I want to say just a word about salad dressing.

29
0:01:54.263,000 --> 0:01:56,000
A hundred seventy-five salad dressings in my supermarket,

30
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:,000
if you don't count the 10 extra-virgin olive oils

31
0:02:00.111,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and 12 balsamic vinegars you could buy

32
0:02:03.117,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to make a very large number of your own salad dressings,

33
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in the off-chance that none of the 175 the store has on offer suit you.

34
0:02:11.511,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So this is what the supermarket is like.

35
0:02:13.494,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And then you go to the consumer electronics store

36
0:02:15.889,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to set up a stereo system --

37
0:02:17.297,000 --> 0:02:2,000
speakers, CD player, tape player, tuner, amplifier --

38
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and in this one single consumer electronics store,

39
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
there are that many stereo systems.

40
0:02:28.92,000 --> 0:02:33,000
We can construct six and a half million different stereo systems

41
0:02:33.993,000 --> 0:02:35,000
out of the components that are on offer in one store.

42
0:02:36.603,000 --> 0:02:38,000
You've got to admit that's a lot of choice.

43
0:02:39.294,000 --> 0:02:42,000
In other domains -- the world of communications.

44
0:02:43.389,000 --> 0:02:44,000
There was a time, when I was a boy,

45
0:02:45.255,000 --> 0:02:47,000
when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted,

46
0:02:48.096,000 --> 0:02:49,000
as long as it came from Ma Bell.

47
0:02:49.938,000 --> 0:02:51,000
You rented your phone, you didn't buy it.

48
0:02:52.136,000 --> 0:02:55,000
One consequence of that, by the way, is that the phone never broke.

49
0:02:55.613,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And those days are gone.

50
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:,000
We now have an almost unlimited variety of phones,

51
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
especially in the world of cell phones.

52
0:03:03.301,000 --> 0:03:05,000
These are cell phones of the future.

53
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
My favorite is the middle one --

54
0:03:08.177,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the MP3 player, nose hair trimmer, and crème brûlée torch.

55
0:03:11.833,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And if --

56
0:03:13.007,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:14.72,000 --> 0:03:17,000
if by some chance you haven't seen that in your store yet,

58
0:03:17.848,000 --> 0:03:2,000
you can rest assured that one day soon, you will.

59
0:03:20.971,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores,

60
0:03:24.048,000 --> 0:03:25,000
asking this question.

61
0:03:25.785,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And do you know what the answer to this question now is?

62
0:03:28.477,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The answer is "no."

63
0:03:30.483,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn't do too much.

64
0:03:33.654,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So, in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things,

65
0:03:39.19,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the same explosion of choice is true.

66
0:03:42.517,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Health care.

67
0:03:44.143,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It is no longer the case in the United States

68
0:03:46.604,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that you go to the doctor, and the doctor tells you what to do.

69
0:03:50.48,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Instead, you go to the doctor,

70
0:03:52.027,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and the doctor tells you, "Well, we could do A, or we could do B.

71
0:03:55.337,000 --> 0:03:57,000
A has these benefits and these risks.

72
0:03:57.743,000 --> 0:03:59,000
B has these benefits and these risks.

73
0:04:00.454,000 --> 0:04:01,000
What do you want to do?"

74
0:04:02.138,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And you say, "Doc, what should I do?"

75
0:04:04.967,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And the doc says, "A has these benefits and risks,

76
0:04:07.981,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and B has these benefits and risks.

77
0:04:09.841,000 --> 0:04:1,000
What do you want to do?"

78
0:04:11.777,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And you say, "If you were me, Doc, what would you do?"

79
0:04:15.793,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And the doc says, "But I'm not you."

80
0:04:18.999,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And the result is -- we call it "patient autonomy,"

81
0:04:21.698,000 --> 0:04:22,000
which makes it sound like a good thing,

82
0:04:23.707,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility

83
0:04:27.133,000 --> 0:04:28,000
for decision-making

84
0:04:28.318,000 --> 0:04:3,000
from somebody who knows something -- namely, the doctor --

85
0:04:31.084,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick

86
0:04:33.886,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and thus, not in the best shape to be making decisions --

87
0:04:36.658,000 --> 0:04:37,000
namely, the patient.

88
0:04:37.896,000 --> 0:04:39,000
There's enormous marketing of prescription drugs

89
0:04:40.746,000 --> 0:04:41,000
to people like you and me,

90
0:04:42.173,000 --> 0:04:44,000
which, if you think about it, makes no sense at all,

91
0:04:44.65,000 --> 0:04:45,000
since we can't buy them.

92
0:04:45.85,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Why do they market to us if we can't buy them?

93
0:04:48.215,000 --> 0:04:51,000
The answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning

94
0:04:52.237,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and ask for our prescriptions to be changed.

95
0:04:55.532,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Something as dramatic as our identity

96
0:04:59.533,000 --> 0:05:01,000
has now become a matter of choice,

97
0:05:02.419,000 --> 0:05:05,000
as this slide is meant to indicate.

98
0:05:05.794,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We don't inherit an identity; we get to invent it.

99
0:05:08.743,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And we get to reinvent ourselves as often as we like.

100
0:05:12.062,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And that means that every day, when you wake up in the morning,

101
0:05:15.127,000 --> 0:05:17,000
you have to decide what kind of person you want to be.

102
0:05:18.77,000 --> 0:05:2,000
With respect to marriage and family:

103
0:05:22.497,000 --> 0:05:26,000
there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had

104
0:05:27.479,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is that you got married as soon as you could,

105
0:05:29.649,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and then you started having kids as soon as you could.

106
0:05:32.496,000 --> 0:05:34,000
The only real choice was who,

107
0:05:34.928,000 --> 0:05:36,000
not when, and not what you did after.

108
0:05:38.159,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Nowadays, everything is very much up for grabs.

109
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I teach wonderfully intelligent students,

110
0:05:43.745,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and I assign 20 percent less work than I used to.

111
0:05:47.689,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And it's not because they're less smart,

112
0:05:50.161,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and it's not because they're less diligent.

113
0:05:52.49,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's because they are preoccupied, asking themselves,

114
0:05:55.894,000 --> 0:05:57,000
"Should I get married or not? Should I get married now?

115
0:05:58.625,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Should I get married later?

116
0:05:59.965,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Should I have kids first or a career first?"

117
0:06:02.343,000 --> 0:06:04,000
All of these are consuming questions.

118
0:06:05.096,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And they're going to answer these questions,

119
0:06:07.238,000 --> 0:06:09,000
whether or not it means not doing all the work I assign

120
0:06:09.854,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and not getting a good grade in my courses.

121
0:06:11.904,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And indeed they should.

122
0:06:13.081,000 --> 0:06:15,000
These are important questions to answer.

123
0:06:16.887,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Work.

124
0:06:18.343,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We are blessed, as Carl was pointing out,

125
0:06:20.605,000 --> 0:06:25,000
with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day

126
0:06:26.451,000 --> 0:06:28,000
from any place on the planet --

127
0:06:28.515,000 --> 0:06:29,000
except the Randolph Hotel.

128
0:06:30.777,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Laughter)

129
0:06:33.841,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Applause)

130
0:06:35.753,000 --> 0:06:37,000
There is one corner, by the way,

131
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that I'm not going to tell anybody about, where the WiFi actually works.

132
0:06:42.63,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I'm not telling you about it, because I want to use it.

133
0:06:45.528,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So what this means,

134
0:06:46.708,000 --> 0:06:49,000
this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work,

135
0:06:49.826,000 --> 0:06:5,000
is that we have to make a decision,

136
0:06:51.697,000 --> 0:06:52,000
again and again and again,

137
0:06:53.58,000 --> 0:06:55,000
about whether we should or shouldn't be working.

138
0:06:56.217,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We can go to watch our kid play soccer,

139
0:06:58.629,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and we have our cell phone on one hip and our Blackberry on our other hip,

140
0:07:02.583,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and our laptop, presumably, on our laps.

141
0:07:05.502,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And even if they're all shut off,

142
0:07:07.571,000 --> 0:07:1,000
every minute that we're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game,

143
0:07:10.837,000 --> 0:07:11,000
we are also asking ourselves,

144
0:07:12.472,000 --> 0:07:14,000
"Should I answer this cell phone call?

145
0:07:14.73,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Should I respond to this email? Should I draft this letter?"

146
0:07:17.591,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And even if the answer to the question is "no,"

147
0:07:20.191,000 --> 0:07:23,000
it's certainly going to make the experience of your kid's soccer game

148
0:07:23.507,000 --> 0:07:25,000
very different than it would've been.

149
0:07:25.666,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So everywhere we look,

150
0:07:27.731,000 --> 0:07:3,000
big things and small things, material things and lifestyle things,

151
0:07:31.513,000 --> 0:07:33,000
life is a matter of choice.

152
0:07:34.503,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And the world we used to live in looked like this.

153
0:07:38.086,000 --> 0:07:4,000
[Well, actually, they are written in stone.]

154
0:07:40.235,000 --> 0:07:41,000
That is to say, there were some choices,

155
0:07:42.201,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but not everything was a matter of choice.

156
0:07:44.287,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The world we now live in looks like this.

0:07:46.391,000 --> 0:07:48,000
[The Ten Commandments Do-It-Yourself Kit]

158
0:07:48.458,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And the question is: Is this good news or bad news?

159
0:07:53.047,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And the answer is "yes."

160
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:58.357,000 --> 0:08:,000
We all know what's good about it,

162
0:08:00.643,000 --> 0:08:02,000
so I'm going to talk about what's bad about it.

163
0:08:03.302,000 --> 0:08:06,000
All of this choice has two effects,

164
0:08:06.471,000 --> 0:08:07,000
two negative effects on people.

165
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
One effect, paradoxically,

166
0:08:11.739,000 --> 0:08:14,000
is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation.

167
0:08:15.698,000 --> 0:08:17,000
With so many options to choose from,

168
0:08:18.108,000 --> 0:08:21,000
people find it very difficult to choose at all.

169
0:08:22.293,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I'll give you one very dramatic example of this,

170
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:3,000
a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans.

171
0:08:31.109,000 --> 0:08:36,000
A colleague of mine got access to investment records from Vanguard,

172
0:08:36.564,000 --> 0:08:37,000
the gigantic mutual fund company,

173
0:08:38.312,000 --> 0:08:41,000
of about a million employees and about 2,000 different workplaces.

174
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:47,000
What she found is that for every 10 mutual funds the employer offered,

175
0:08:47.779,000 --> 0:08:5,000
rate of participation went down two percent.

176
0:08:52.27,000 --> 0:08:56,000
You offer 50 funds -- 10 percent fewer employees participate

177
0:08:56.68,000 --> 0:08:57,000
than if you only offer five.

178
0:08:59.014,000 --> 0:09:,000
Why?

179
0:09:00.197,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Because with 50 funds to choose from,

180
0:09:02.205,000 --> 0:09:05,000
it's so damn hard to decide which fund to choose,

181
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that you'll just put it off till tomorrow,

182
0:09:08.072,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and then tomorrow

183
0:09:09.295,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and then tomorrow and tomorrow,

184
0:09:11.798,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and, of course, tomorrow never comes.

185
0:09:13.652,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Understand that not only does this mean

186
0:09:15.688,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that people are going to have to eat dog food when they retire

187
0:09:18.671,000 --> 0:09:2,000
because they don't have enough money put away,

188
0:09:20.868,000 --> 0:09:22,000
it also means that making the decision is so hard

189
0:09:23.402,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that they pass up significant matching money from the employer.

190
0:09:27.082,000 --> 0:09:31,000
By not participating, they are passing up as much as 5,000 dollars a year

191
0:09:31.344,000 --> 0:09:32,000
from the employer,

192
0:09:32.527,000 --> 0:09:34,000
who would happily match their contribution.

193
0:09:35.087,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices.

194
0:09:38.798,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And I think it makes the world look like this.

195
0:09:41.871,000 --> 0:09:44,000
[And lastly, for all eternity, French, bleu cheese or ranch?]

196
0:09:45.72,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Laughter)

197
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:52,000
You really want to get the decision right if it's for all eternity, right?

198
0:09:52.036,000 --> 0:09:55,000
You don't want to pick the wrong mutual fund or wrong salad dressing.

199
0:09:55.464,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So that's one effect.

200
0:09:56.64,000 --> 0:10:,000
The second effect is that, even if we manage to overcome the paralysis

201
0:10:01.325,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and make a choice,

202
0:10:03.38,000 --> 0:10:06,000
we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice

203
0:10:07.372,000 --> 0:10:09,000
than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from.

204
0:10:10.769,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And there are several reasons for this.

205
0:10:13.359,000 --> 0:10:16,000
One of them is, with a lot of different salad dressings to choose from,

206
0:10:17.132,000 --> 0:10:2,000
if you buy one and it's not perfect -- and what salad dressing is? --

207
0:10:20.69,000 --> 0:10:23,000
it's easy to imagine that you could've made a different choice

208
0:10:23.835,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that would've been better.

209
0:10:25.864,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And what happens is,

210
0:10:27.161,000 --> 0:10:31,000
this imagined alternative induces you to regret the decision you made,

211
0:10:32.163,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and this regret subtracts from the satisfaction you get

212
0:10:35.076,000 --> 0:10:36,000
out of the decision you made,

213
0:10:36.505,000 --> 0:10:37,000
even if it was a good decision.

214
0:10:38.626,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The more options there are, the easier it is to regret anything at all

215
0:10:42.358,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that is disappointing about the option that you chose.

216
0:10:45.342,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Second, what economists call "opportunity costs."

217
0:10:48.375,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Dan Gilbert made a big point this morning

218
0:10:50.408,000 --> 0:10:54,000
of talking about how much the way in which we value things

219
0:10:55.095,000 --> 0:10:57,000
depends on what we compare them to.

220
0:10:57.391,000 --> 0:11:,000
Well, when there are lots of alternatives to consider,

221
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:06,000
it's easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject

222
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you've chosen.

223
0:11:11.692,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Here's an example.

224
0:11:12.867,000 --> 0:11:15,000
[I can't stop thinking about those other available parking spaces on W 85th Street]

225
0:11:16.865,000 --> 0:11:17,000
If you're not a New Yorker, I apologize.

226
0:11:18.805,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Here's what you're supposed to be thinking.

227
0:11:20.859,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Here's this couple on the Hamptons. Very expensive real estate.

228
0:11:23.881,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Gorgeous beach. Beautiful day. They have it all to themselves.

229
0:11:26.861,000 --> 0:11:27,000
What could be better?

230
0:11:28.077,000 --> 0:11:29,000
"Damn it," this guy is thinking,

231
0:11:29.679,000 --> 0:11:32,000
"It's August. Everybody in my Manhattan neighborhood is away.

232
0:11:33.694,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I could be parking right in front of my building."

233
0:11:37.851,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And he spends two weeks nagged by the idea

234
0:11:41.539,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that he is missing the opportunity, day after day,

235
0:11:44.644,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to have a great parking space.

236
0:11:46.386,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Laughter)

237
0:11:48.123,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Opportunity costs subtract from the satisfaction

238
0:11:51.133,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that we get out of what we choose,

239
0:11:52.798,000 --> 0:11:53,000
even when what we choose is terrific.

240
0:11:55.178,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And the more options there are to consider,

241
0:11:57.553,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the more attractive features of these options

242
0:11:59.723,000 --> 0:12:02,000
are going to be reflected by us as opportunity costs.

243
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Here's another example.

244
0:12:05.721,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Laughter)

245
0:12:08.889,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Now, this cartoon makes a lot of points.

246
0:12:11.598,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It makes points about living in the moment as well,

247
0:12:14.755,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and probably about doing things slowly.

248
0:12:16.831,000 --> 0:12:19,000
But one point it makes is that whenever you're choosing one thing,

249
0:12:19.966,000 --> 0:12:2,000
you're choosing not to do other things,

250
0:12:21.863,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and those other things may have lots of attractive features,

251
0:12:24.72,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and it's going to make what you're doing

252
0:12:26.67,000 --> 0:12:27,000
less attractive.

253
0:12:27.845,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Third: escalation of expectations.

254
0:12:29.627,000 --> 0:12:31,000
This hit me when I went to replace my jeans.

255
0:12:32.404,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I wear jeans almost all the time.

256
0:12:34.531,000 --> 0:12:36,000
There was a time when jeans came in one flavor,

257
0:12:37.045,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and you bought them, and they fit like crap.

258
0:12:39.138,000 --> 0:12:4,000
They were incredibly uncomfortable,

259
0:12:40.84,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and if you wore them long enough and washed them enough times,

260
0:12:43.793,000 --> 0:12:44,000
they started to feel OK.

261
0:12:45.132,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I went to replace my jeans after years of wearing these old ones.

262
0:12:48.246,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I said, "I want a pair of jeans. Here's my size."

263
0:12:51.468,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And the shopkeeper said,

264
0:12:52.729,000 --> 0:12:54,000
"Do you want slim fit, easy fit, relaxed fit?

265
0:12:55.15,000 --> 0:12:58,000
You want button fly or zipper fly? You want stonewashed or acid-washed?

266
0:12:58.536,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Do you want them distressed?

267
0:12:59.943,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Do you want boot cut, tapered?" Blah, blah, blah on and on he went.

268
0:13:03.202,000 --> 0:13:04,000
My jaw dropped.

269
0:13:04.728,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And after I recovered, I said,

270
0:13:06.279,000 --> 0:13:09,000
"I want the kind that used to be the only kind."

271
0:13:09.429,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Laughter)

272
0:13:14.145,000 --> 0:13:15,000
He had no idea what that was.

273
0:13:16.001,000 --> 0:13:17,000
(Laughter)

274
0:13:17.182,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So I spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans,

275
0:13:20.03,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and I walked out of the store -- truth --

276
0:13:22.149,000 --> 0:13:24,000
with the best-fitting jeans I had ever had.

277
0:13:24.881,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I did better.

278
0:13:26.08,000 --> 0:13:29,000
All this choice made it possible for me to do better.

279
0:13:29.909,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But --

280
0:13:31.084,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I felt worse.

281
0:13:33.544,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Why? I wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself.

282
0:13:37.341,000 --> 0:13:38,000
The reason is --

283
0:13:38.524,000 --> 0:13:42,000
(Laughter)

284
0:13:42.745,000 --> 0:13:47,000
The reason I felt worse is that with all of these options available,

285
0:13:47.783,000 --> 0:13:52,000
my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up.

286
0:13:54.092,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I had very low, no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor.

287
0:13:58.57,000 --> 0:14:01,000
When they came in 100 flavors, damn it, one of them should've been perfect.

288
0:14:02.192,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And what I got was good, but it wasn't perfect.

289
0:14:04.426,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And so I compared what I got to what I expected,

290
0:14:07.739,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and what I got was disappointing in comparison to what I expected.

291
0:14:11.198,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Adding options to people's lives

292
0:14:13.262,000 --> 0:14:16,000
can't help but increase the expectations people have

293
0:14:16.89,000 --> 0:14:18,000
about how good those options will be.

294
0:14:19.111,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And what that's going to produce is less satisfaction with results,

295
0:14:22.587,000 --> 0:14:23,000
even when they're good results.

296
0:14:24.248,000 --> 0:14:26,000
[It all looks so great. I can't wait to be disappointed.]

297
0:14:26.957,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Nobody in the world of marketing knows this.

298
0:14:29.143,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Because if they did, you wouldn't all know what this was about.

299
0:14:33.959,000 --> 0:14:34,000
The truth is more like this.

300
0:14:36.521,000 --> 0:14:39,000
[Everything was better back when everything was worse.]

301
0:14:39.614,000 --> 0:14:43,000
The reason that everything was better back when everything was worse

302
0:14:43.65,000 --> 0:14:45,000
is that when everything was worse,

303
0:14:45.816,000 --> 0:14:46,000
it was actually possible for people

304
0:14:47.611,000 --> 0:14:49,000
to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise.

305
0:14:50.999,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Nowadays, the world we live in -- we affluent, industrialized citizens,

306
0:14:55.535,000 --> 0:14:56,000
with perfection the expectation --

307
0:14:57.536,000 --> 0:14:58,000
the best you can ever hope for

308
0:14:59.065,000 --> 0:15:01,000
is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be.

309
0:15:01.754,000 --> 0:15:02,000
You will never be pleasantly surprised,

310
0:15:03.698,000 --> 0:15:05,000
because your expectations, my expectations,

311
0:15:05.769,000 --> 0:15:06,000
have gone through the roof.

312
0:15:07.127,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The secret to happiness -- this is what you all came for --

313
0:15:10.508,000 --> 0:15:12,000
the secret to happiness is:

314
0:15:13.081,000 --> 0:15:15,000
low expectations.

315
0:15:15.167,000 --> 0:15:18,000
(Laughter)

316
0:15:18.436,000 --> 0:15:19,000
[You'll do]

317
0:15:19.85,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Applause)

318
0:15:21.35,000 --> 0:15:22,000
(Laughter)

319
0:15:24.483,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I want to say --

320
0:15:25.697,000 --> 0:15:27,000
just a little autobiographical moment --

321
0:15:28.308,000 --> 0:15:3,000
that I actually am married to a wife,

322
0:15:31.322,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and she's really quite wonderful.

323
0:15:33.297,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I couldn't have done better.

324
0:15:34.664,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I didn't settle.

325
0:15:36.253,000 --> 0:15:38,000
But settling isn't always such a bad thing.

326
0:15:39.158,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Finally,

327
0:15:41.08,000 --> 0:15:44,000
one consequence of buying a bad-fitting pair of jeans

328
0:15:44.421,000 --> 0:15:46,000
when there is only one kind to buy

329
0:15:46.631,000 --> 0:15:49,000
is that when you are dissatisfied and you ask why, who's responsible,

330
0:15:50.376,000 --> 0:15:52,000
the answer is clear: the world is responsible.

331
0:15:52.793,000 --> 0:15:53,000
What could you do?

332
0:15:54.536,000 --> 0:15:56,000
When there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available

333
0:15:57.558,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and you buy one that is disappointing

334
0:15:59.798,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and you ask why, who's responsible,

335
0:16:02.335,000 --> 0:16:06,000
it is equally clear that the answer to the question is "you."

336
0:16:07.264,000 --> 0:16:08,000
You could have done better.

337
0:16:08.79,000 --> 0:16:11,000
With a hundred different kinds of jeans on display,

338
0:16:12,000 --> 0:16:14,000
there is no excuse for failure.

339
0:16:14.201,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And so when people make decisions,

340
0:16:16.677,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and even though the results of the decisions are good,

341
0:16:19.328,000 --> 0:16:21,000
they feel disappointed about them;

342
0:16:21.75,000 --> 0:16:22,000
they blame themselves.

343
0:16:23.751,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world

344
0:16:26.82,000 --> 0:16:27,000
in the last generation.

345
0:16:28.241,000 --> 0:16:31,000
I believe a significant -- not the only, but a significant -- contributor

346
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:35,000
to this explosion of depression and also suicide,

347
0:16:35.464,000 --> 0:16:37,000
is that people have experiences that are disappointing

348
0:16:38.065,000 --> 0:16:39,000
because their standards are so high,

349
0:16:39.827,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and then when they have to explain these experiences to themselves,

350
0:16:43.04,000 --> 0:16:44,000
they think they're at fault.

351
0:16:45,000 --> 0:16:49,000
So the net result is that we do better in general, objectively,

352
0:16:49.65,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and we feel worse.

353
0:16:51.935,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So let me remind you:

354
0:16:54.726,000 --> 0:16:58,000
this is the official dogma, the one that we all take to be true,

355
0:16:59.364,000 --> 0:17:,000
and it's all false.

356
0:17:01.68,000 --> 0:17:02,000
It is not true.

357
0:17:03.292,000 --> 0:17:06,000
There's no question that some choice is better than none.

358
0:17:07.567,000 --> 0:17:09,000
But it doesn't follow from that

359
0:17:09.638,000 --> 0:17:11,000
that more choice is better than some choice.

360
0:17:12.109,000 --> 0:17:14,000
There's some magical amount. I don't know what it is.

361
0:17:14.671,000 --> 0:17:17,000
I'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point

362
0:17:17.722,000 --> 0:17:19,000
where options improve our welfare.

363
0:17:20.452,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Now, as a policy matter -- I'm almost done --

364
0:17:23.433,000 --> 0:17:26,000
as a policy matter, the thing to think about is this:

365
0:17:26.841,000 --> 0:17:3,000
what enables all of this choice in industrial societies

366
0:17:31.814,000 --> 0:17:33,000
is material affluence.

367
0:17:34.46,000 --> 0:17:35,000
There are lots of places in the world,

368
0:17:36.31,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and we have heard about several of them,

369
0:17:38.309,000 --> 0:17:4,000
where their problem is not that they have too much choice.

370
0:17:41.066,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Their problem is they have too little.

371
0:17:42.979,000 --> 0:17:45,000
So the stuff I'm talking about is the peculiar problem

372
0:17:46.583,000 --> 0:17:49,000
of modern, affluent, Western societies.

373
0:17:49.672,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And what is so frustrating and infuriating is this:

374
0:17:52.921,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Steve Levitt talked to you yesterday

375
0:17:54.742,000 --> 0:18:,000
about how these expensive and difficult-to-install child seats

376
0:18:01.66,000 --> 0:18:02,000
don't help.

377
0:18:04.056,000 --> 0:18:05,000
It's a waste of money.

378
0:18:05.685,000 --> 0:18:09,000
What I'm telling you is that these expensive, complicated choices --

379
0:18:10.525,000 --> 0:18:11,000
it's not simply that they don't help.

380
0:18:12.407,000 --> 0:18:13,000
They actually hurt.

381
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:16,000
They actually make us worse off.

382
0:18:16.928,000 --> 0:18:19,000
If some of what enables people in our societies

383
0:18:20.703,000 --> 0:18:21,000
to make all of the choices we make

384
0:18:22.726,000 --> 0:18:26,000
were shifted to societies in which people have too few options,

385
0:18:27.454,000 --> 0:18:29,000
not only would those people's lives be improved,

386
0:18:29.809,000 --> 0:18:31,000
but ours would be improved also.

387
0:18:31.958,000 --> 0:18:34,000
This is what economists call a "Pareto-improving move."

388
0:18:35.301,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Income redistribution will make everyone better off,

389
0:18:38.737,000 --> 0:18:39,000
not just poor people,

390
0:18:40.173,000 --> 0:18:42,000
because of how all this excess choice plagues us.

391
0:18:43.722,000 --> 0:18:44,000
So to conclude.

392
0:18:44.903,000 --> 0:18:46,000
[You can be anything you want to be -- no limits.]

393
0:18:47.291,000 --> 0:18:5,000
You're supposed to read this cartoon and, being a sophisticated person, say,

394
0:18:50.97,000 --> 0:18:54,000
"Ah! What does this fish know? Nothing is possible in this fishbowl."

395
0:18:55.753,000 --> 0:18:57,000
Impoverished imagination, a myopic view of the world --

396
0:18:58.631,000 --> 0:18:59,000
that's the way I read it at first.

397
0:19:00.335,000 --> 0:19:01,000
The more I thought about it, however,

398
0:19:02.177,000 --> 0:19:05,000
the more I came to the view that this fish knows something.

399
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Because the truth of the matter is,

400
0:19:08.236,000 --> 0:19:12,000
if you shatter the fishbowl so that everything is possible,

401
0:19:12.493,000 --> 0:19:13,000
you don't have freedom.

402
0:19:13.93,000 --> 0:19:14,000
You have paralysis.

403
0:19:16.373,000 --> 0:19:19,000
If you shatter this fishbowl so that everything is possible,

404
0:19:19.929,000 --> 0:19:21,000
you decrease satisfaction.

405
0:19:23.184,000 --> 0:19:26,000
You increase paralysis, and you decrease satisfaction.

406
0:19:26.828,000 --> 0:19:27,000
Everybody needs a fishbowl.

407
0:19:29,000 --> 0:19:31,000
This one is almost certainly too limited --

408
0:19:31.368,000 --> 0:19:34,000
perhaps even for the fish, certainly for us.

409
0:19:34.397,000 --> 0:19:38,000
But the absence of some metaphorical fishbowl is a recipe for misery

410
0:19:38.889,000 --> 0:19:39,000
and, I suspect, disaster.

411
0:19:41,000 --> 0:19:42,000
Thank you very much.

412
0:19:42.294,000 --> 0:19:43,000
(Applause)

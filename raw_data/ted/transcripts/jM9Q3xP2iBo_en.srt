1
0:00:12.842,000 --> 0:00:14,000
What is a parent?

2
0:00:15.999,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What is a parent?

3
0:00:19.043,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's not an easy question.

4
0:00:21.63,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Today we have adoption,

5
0:00:24.028,000 --> 0:00:25,000
stepfamilies,

6
0:00:25.628,000 --> 0:00:26,000
surrogate mothers.

7
0:00:27.846,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Many parents face tough questions

8
0:00:31.151,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and tough decisions.

9
0:00:33.888,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Shall we tell our child about the sperm donation?

10
0:00:39.322,000 --> 0:00:4,000
If so, when?

11
0:00:41.176,000 --> 0:00:42,000
What words to use?

12
0:00:43.522,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Sperm donors are often referred to as "biological fathers,"

13
0:00:49.407,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but should we really be using the word "father?"

14
0:00:53.843,000 --> 0:00:55,000
As a philosopher and social scientist,

15
0:00:56.272,000 --> 0:01:,000
I have been studying these questions about the concept of parenthood.

16
0:01:01.088,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But today, I will talk to you about what I learned

17
0:01:04.14,000 --> 0:01:06,000
from talking to parents and children.

18
0:01:07.377,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I will show you that they know what matters most in a family,

19
0:01:11.755,000 --> 0:01:13,000
even though their family looks a little different.

20
0:01:15.133,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I will show you their creative ways of dealing with tough questions.

21
0:01:21.287,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But I will also show you the parents' uncertainties.

22
0:01:27.284,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We interviewed couples

23
0:01:28.839,000 --> 0:01:31,000
who received fertility treatment at Ghent University Hospital,

24
0:01:33.075,000 --> 0:01:34,000
using sperm from a donor.

25
0:01:35.183,000 --> 0:01:36,000
In this treatment timeline,

26
0:01:36.774,000 --> 0:01:39,000
you can see two points at which we conducted interviews.

27
0:01:40.994,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We included heterosexual couples,

28
0:01:44.055,000 --> 0:01:47,000
where the man for some reason did not have good-quality sperm,

29
0:01:48.435,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and lesbian couples who obviously needed to find sperm elsewhere.

30
0:01:54.996,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We also included children.

31
0:01:58.878,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I wanted to know

32
0:02:00.385,000 --> 0:02:04,000
how those children define concepts like parenthood and family.

33
0:02:06.15,000 --> 0:02:08,000
In fact, that is what I asked them,

34
0:02:10.259,000 --> 0:02:11,000
only not in that way.

35
0:02:13.437,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I drew an apple tree instead.

36
0:02:17.056,000 --> 0:02:2,000
This way, I could ask abstract, philosophical questions

37
0:02:20.427,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in a way that did not make them run off.

38
0:02:25.332,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So as you can see,

39
0:02:27.008,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the apple tree is empty.

40
0:02:29.63,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And that illustrates my research approach.

41
0:02:32.659,000 --> 0:02:34,000
By designing techniques like this,

42
0:02:34.966,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I can bring as little meaning and content as possible to the interview,

43
0:02:40.533,000 --> 0:02:42,000
because I want to hear that from them.

44
0:02:44.362,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I asked them:

45
0:02:46.738,000 --> 0:02:49,000
What would your family look like if it were an apple tree?

46
0:02:50.739,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And they could take a paper apple for everyone who, in their view,

47
0:02:54.513,000 --> 0:02:55,000
was a member of the family,

48
0:02:56.144,000 --> 0:02:59,000
write a name on it and hang it wherever they wanted.

49
0:02:59.342,000 --> 0:03:,000
And I would ask questions.

50
0:03:02.153,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Most children started with a parent or a sibling.

51
0:03:05.806,000 --> 0:03:07,000
One started with "Boxer,"

52
0:03:08.667,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the dead dog of his grandparents.

53
0:03:11.83,000 --> 0:03:14,000
At this point, none of the children started mentioning the donor.

54
0:03:16.465,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So, I asked them about their birth story.

55
0:03:21.161,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I said, "Before you were born,

56
0:03:23.207,000 --> 0:03:25,000
it was just your mom and dad,

57
0:03:25.594,000 --> 0:03:26,000
or mom and mommy.

58
0:03:27.421,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Can you tell me how you came into the family?"

59
0:03:31.282,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And they explained.

60
0:03:33.602,000 --> 0:03:34,000
One said,

61
0:03:35.691,000 --> 0:03:37,000
"My parents did not have good seeds,

62
0:03:38.865,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but there are friendly men out there who have spare seeds.

63
0:03:43.386,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They bring them to the hospital,

64
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and they put them in a big jar.

65
0:03:48.249,000 --> 0:03:49,000
My mommy went there,

66
0:03:49.51,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and she took two from the jar,

67
0:03:52.786,000 --> 0:03:54,000
one for me and one for my sister.

68
0:03:55.725,000 --> 0:03:57,000
She put the seeds in her belly --

69
0:03:58.161,000 --> 0:03:59,000
somehow --

70
0:04:00.236,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and her belly grew really big,

71
0:04:02.567,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and there I was."

72
0:04:05.289,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Hmm.

73
0:04:08.123,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So only when they started mentioning the donor,

74
0:04:12.215,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I asked questions about him, using their own words.

75
0:04:15.926,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I said,

76
0:04:17.349,000 --> 0:04:21,000
"If this would be an apple for the friendly man with the seeds,

77
0:04:21.839,000 --> 0:04:22,000
what would you do with it?"

78
0:04:24.069,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And one boy was thinking out loud,

79
0:04:26.451,000 --> 0:04:27,000
holding the apple.

80
0:04:27.843,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And he said,

81
0:04:29.89,000 --> 0:04:31,000
"I won't put this one up there with the others.

82
0:04:33.239,000 --> 0:04:34,000
He's not part of my family.

83
0:04:36.191,000 --> 0:04:38,000
But I will not put him on the ground.

84
0:04:38.409,000 --> 0:04:39,000
That's too cold and too hard.

85
0:04:41.024,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I think he should be in the trunk,

86
0:04:44.207,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because he made my family possible.

87
0:04:47.264,000 --> 0:04:48,000
If he would not have done this,

88
0:04:49.242,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that would really be sad because my family would not be here,

89
0:04:53.224,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and I would not be here."

90
0:04:57.845,000 --> 0:05:,000
So also, parents constructed family tales --

91
0:05:01.397,000 --> 0:05:02,000
tales to tell their children.

92
0:05:04.66,000 --> 0:05:07,000
One couple explained their insemination

93
0:05:07.811,000 --> 0:05:09,000
by taking their children to a farm

94
0:05:11.291,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to watch a vet inseminate cows.

95
0:05:15.656,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And why not?

96
0:05:17.051,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's their way of explaining;

97
0:05:19.515,000 --> 0:05:22,000
their do-it-yourself with family narratives.

98
0:05:22.981,000 --> 0:05:23,000
DIY.

99
0:05:24.533,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And we had another couple who made books --

100
0:05:26.925,000 --> 0:05:27,000
a book for each child.

101
0:05:28.752,000 --> 0:05:29,000
They were really works of art

102
0:05:30.298,000 --> 0:05:33,000
containing their thoughts and feelings throughout the treatment.

103
0:05:34.192,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They even had the hospital parking tickets in there.

104
0:05:37.553,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So it is DIY:

105
0:05:39.198,000 --> 0:05:41,000
finding ways, words and images

106
0:05:41.604,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to tell your family story to your child.

107
0:05:45.717,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And these stories were highly diverse,

108
0:05:48.94,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but they all had one thing in common:

109
0:05:53.913,000 --> 0:05:56,000
it was a tale of longing for a child

110
0:05:57.885,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and a quest for that child.

111
0:06:00.37,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It was about how special and how deeply loved their child was.

112
0:06:07.142,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And research so far shows that these children are doing fine.

113
0:06:11.814,000 --> 0:06:13,000
They do not have more problems than other kids.

114
0:06:14.854,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Yet, these parents also wanted to justify their decisions

115
0:06:19.299,000 --> 0:06:2,000
through the tales they tell.

116
0:06:21.505,000 --> 0:06:24,000
They hoped that their children would understand their reasons

117
0:06:24.663,000 --> 0:06:25,000
for making the family in this way.

118
0:06:27.865,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Underlying was a fear that their children might disapprove

119
0:06:31.843,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and would reject the non-genetic parent.

120
0:06:34.511,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And that fear is understandable,

121
0:06:37.155,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because we live in a very heteronormative

122
0:06:40.22,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and geneticized society --

123
0:06:42.438,000 --> 0:06:43,000
a world that still believes

124
0:06:43.954,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that true families consist of one mom, one dad

125
0:06:48.13,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and their genetically related children.

126
0:06:51.738,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Well.

127
0:06:54.165,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I want to tell you about a teenage boy.

128
0:06:57.29,000 --> 0:06:59,000
He was donor-conceived but not part of our study.

129
0:07:00.658,000 --> 0:07:02,000
One day, he had an argument with his father,

130
0:07:03.3,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and he yelled,

131
0:07:05.305,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"You're telling me what to do?

132
0:07:07.426,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You're not even my father!"

133
0:07:11.601,000 --> 0:07:14,000
That was exactly what the parents in our study feared.

134
0:07:15.984,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Now, the boy soon felt sorry, and they made up.

135
0:07:19.629,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But it is the reaction of his father that is most interesting.

136
0:07:24.169,000 --> 0:07:25,000
He said,

137
0:07:25.772,000 --> 0:07:3,000
"This outburst had nothing to do with the lack of a genetic link.

138
0:07:31.765,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It was about puberty --

139
0:07:35.005,000 --> 0:07:36,000
being difficult.

140
0:07:36.47,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's what they do at that age.

141
0:07:38.792,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It will pass."

142
0:07:41.462,000 --> 0:07:42,000
What this man shows us

143
0:07:43.342,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is that when something goes wrong,

144
0:07:46.564,000 --> 0:07:47,000
we should not immediately think

145
0:07:48.189,000 --> 0:07:5,000
it is because the family is a little different.

146
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
These things happen in all families.

147
0:07:55.936,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And every now and then,

148
0:07:57.818,000 --> 0:07:58,000
all parents may wonder:

149
0:08:00.412,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Am I a good enough parent?

150
0:08:03.164,000 --> 0:08:04,000
These parents, too.

151
0:08:05.099,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They, above all, wanted to do what's best for their child.

152
0:08:09.748,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But they also sometimes wondered:

153
0:08:12.034,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Am I a real parent?

154
0:08:14.288,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And their uncertainties were present long before they even were parents.

155
0:08:18.281,000 --> 0:08:19,000
At the start of treatment,

156
0:08:19.737,000 --> 0:08:2,000
when they first saw the counselor,

157
0:08:22.146,000 --> 0:08:24,000
they paid close attention to the counselor,

158
0:08:24.865,000 --> 0:08:26,000
because they wanted to do it right.

159
0:08:27.853,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Even 10 years later,

160
0:08:30.053,000 --> 0:08:32,000
they still remember the advice they were given.

161
0:08:36.981,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So when they thought about the counselor

162
0:08:40.854,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and the advice they were given,

163
0:08:42.677,000 --> 0:08:43,000
we discussed that.

164
0:08:43.864,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And we saw one lesbian couple who said,

165
0:08:48.627,000 --> 0:08:49,000
"When our son asks us,

166
0:08:50.255,000 --> 0:08:52,000
'Do I have a dad?'

167
0:08:53.482,000 --> 0:08:55,000
we will say 'No, you do not have a dad.'

168
0:08:56.839,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But we will say nothing more, not unless he asks,

169
0:09:00.287,000 --> 0:09:02,000
because he might not be ready for that.

170
0:09:02.339,000 --> 0:09:03,000
The counselor said so."

171
0:09:05.35,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Well.

172
0:09:07.091,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I don't know; that's quite different

173
0:09:09.017,000 --> 0:09:11,000
from how we respond to children's questions.

174
0:09:12.473,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Like, "Milk -- is that made in a factory?"

175
0:09:15.783,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We will say, "No, it comes from cows,"

176
0:09:18.969,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and we will talk about the farmer,

177
0:09:20.749,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and the way the milk ends up in the shop.

178
0:09:23.806,000 --> 0:09:24,000
We will not say,

179
0:09:26.102,000 --> 0:09:29,000
"No, milk is not made in a factory."

180
0:09:32.042,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So something strange happened here,

181
0:09:34.496,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and of course these children noticed that.

182
0:09:37.571,000 --> 0:09:38,000
One boy said,

183
0:09:39.445,000 --> 0:09:41,000
"I asked my parents loads of questions,

184
0:09:41.861,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but they acted really weird.

185
0:09:44.788,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So, you know, I have a friend at school, and she's made in the same way.

186
0:09:49.241,000 --> 0:09:52,000
When I have a question, I just go and ask her."

187
0:09:53.76,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Clever guy.

188
0:09:55.63,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Problem solved.

189
0:09:57.765,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But his parents did not notice,

190
0:10:00.875,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and it certainly was not what they had in mind,

191
0:10:03.481,000 --> 0:10:04,000
nor what the counselor had in mind

192
0:10:05.439,000 --> 0:10:1,000
when they were saying how important it is to be an open-communication family.

193
0:10:12.462,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And that's the strange thing about advice.

194
0:10:14.74,000 --> 0:10:17,000
When we offer people pills, we gather evidence first.

195
0:10:18.536,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We do tests,

196
0:10:19.816,000 --> 0:10:2,000
we do follow-up studies.

197
0:10:21.141,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We want to know, and rightly so, what this pill is doing

198
0:10:25.092,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and how it affects people's lives.

199
0:10:28.035,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And advice?

200
0:10:30.748,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It is not enough for advice,

201
0:10:32.618,000 --> 0:10:36,000
or for professionals to give advice that is theoretically sound,

202
0:10:37.465,000 --> 0:10:38,000
or well-meant.

203
0:10:39.447,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It should be advice that there is evidence for --

204
0:10:42.852,000 --> 0:10:45,000
evidence that it actually improves patients' lives.

205
0:10:48.174,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So the philosopher in me would now like to offer you a paradox:

206
0:10:54.308,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I advise you to stop following advice.

207
0:10:59.897,000 --> 0:11:,000
But, yes.

208
0:11:02.221,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Applause)

209
0:11:06.591,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I will not end here with what went wrong;

210
0:11:09.178,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I would not be doing justice to the warmth we found in those families.

211
0:11:14.931,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Remember the books and the trip to the farmer?

212
0:11:17.585,000 --> 0:11:2,000
When parents do things that work for them,

213
0:11:21.572,000 --> 0:11:22,000
they do brilliant things.

214
0:11:24.391,000 --> 0:11:27,000
What I want you to remember as members of families,

215
0:11:28.058,000 --> 0:11:3,000
in no matter what form or shape,

216
0:11:30.93,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is that what families need are warm relationships.

217
0:11:37.409,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And we do not need to be professionals to create those.

218
0:11:41.644,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Most of us do just fine,

219
0:11:44.986,000 --> 0:11:45,000
although it may be hard work,

220
0:11:47.038,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and from time to time, we can do with some advice.

221
0:11:51.209,000 --> 0:11:52,000
In that case,

222
0:11:52.504,000 --> 0:11:54,000
bear in mind three things.

223
0:11:55.76,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Work with advice that works for your family.

224
0:12:00.008,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Remember -- you're the expert, because you live your family life.

225
0:12:06.681,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And finally,

226
0:12:08.478,000 --> 0:12:11,000
believe in your abilities and your creativity,

227
0:12:13.027,000 --> 0:12:16,000
because you can do it yourself.

228
0:12:17.259,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Thank you.

229
0:12:18.437,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Applause)

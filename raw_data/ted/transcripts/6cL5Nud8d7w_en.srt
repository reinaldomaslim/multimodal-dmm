1
0:00:12.717,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So I'm here to talk to you about the walkable city.

2
0:00:15.63,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What is the walkable city?

3
0:00:17.013,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Well, for want of a better definition,

4
0:00:19.518,000 --> 0:00:25,000
it's a city in which the car is an optional instrument of freedom,

5
0:00:26.43,000 --> 0:00:27,000
rather than a prosthetic device.

6
0:00:28.338,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I'd like to talk about why we need the walkable city,

7
0:00:31.317,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and I'd like to talk about how to do the walkable city.

8
0:00:35.499,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Most of the talks I give these days are about why we need it,

9
0:00:39.863,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but you guys are smart.

10
0:00:44.134,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And also I gave that talk exactly a month ago,

11
0:00:47.405,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and you can see it at TED.com.

12
0:00:49.496,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So today I want to talk about how to do it.

13
0:00:52.52,000 --> 0:00:53,000
In a lot of time thinking about this,

14
0:00:54.483,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I've come up with what I call the general theory of walkability.

15
0:00:57.607,000 --> 0:00:59,000
A bit of a pretentious term, it's a little tongue-in-cheek,

16
0:01:00.561,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but it's something I've thought about for a long time,

17
0:01:03.159,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I'd like to share what I think I've figured out.

18
0:01:06.567,000 --> 0:01:08,000
In the American city, the typical American city --

19
0:01:09.43,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the typical American city is not Washington, DC,

20
0:01:11.694,000 --> 0:01:13,000
or New York, or San Francisco;

21
0:01:14.026,000 --> 0:01:17,000
it's Grand Rapids or Cedar Rapids or Memphis --

22
0:01:17.297,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in the typical American city in which most people own cars

23
0:01:20.432,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and the temptation is to drive them all the time,

24
0:01:22.777,000 --> 0:01:25,000
if you're going to get them to walk, then you have to offer a walk

25
0:01:26.58,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that's as good as a drive or better.

26
0:01:28.452,000 --> 0:01:29,000
What does that mean?

27
0:01:29.627,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It means you need to offer four things simultaneously:

28
0:01:32.192,000 --> 0:01:34,000
there needs to be a proper reason to walk,

29
0:01:34.273,000 --> 0:01:36,000
the walk has to be safe and feel safe,

30
0:01:36.647,000 --> 0:01:37,000
the walk has to be comfortable

31
0:01:38.366,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and the walk has to be interesting.

32
0:01:40.159,000 --> 0:01:42,000
You need to do all four of these things simultaneously,

33
0:01:42.793,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and that's the structure of my talk today,

34
0:01:44.847,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to take you through each of those.

35
0:01:46.5,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The reason to walk is a story I learned from my mentors,

36
0:01:49.788,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Andrés Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk,

37
0:01:52.172,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the founders of the New Urbanism movement.

38
0:01:54.197,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And I should say half the slides and half of my talk today

39
0:01:57.734,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I learned from them.

40
0:01:59.084,000 --> 0:02:,000
It's the story of planning,

41
0:02:00.887,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the story of the formation of the planning profession.

42
0:02:04.151,000 --> 0:02:08,000
When in the 19th century people were choking

43
0:02:08.926,000 --> 0:02:1,000
from the soot of the dark, satanic mills,

44
0:02:11.443,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the planners said, hey, let's move the housing away from the mills.

45
0:02:15.843,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And lifespans increased immediately, dramatically,

46
0:02:19.334,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and we like to say

47
0:02:20.509,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the planners have been trying to repeat that experience ever since.

48
0:02:23.725,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So there's the onset of what we call Euclidean zoning,

49
0:02:26.391,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the separation of the landscape into large areas of single use.

50
0:02:30.49,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And typically when I arrive in a city to do a plan,

51
0:02:32.991,000 --> 0:02:36,000
a plan like this already awaits me on the property that I'm looking at.

52
0:02:37.054,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And all a plan like this guarantees

53
0:02:38.78,000 --> 0:02:4,000
is that you will not have a walkable city,

54
0:02:40.843,000 --> 0:02:42,000
because nothing is located near anything else.

55
0:02:43.787,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The alternative, of course, is our most walkable city,

56
0:02:47.451,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and I like to say, you know, this is a Rothko,

57
0:02:50.005,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and this is a Seurat.

58
0:02:51.532,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's just a different way -- he was the pointilist --

59
0:02:54.097,000 --> 0:02:55,000
it's a different way of making places.

60
0:02:55.954,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And even this map of Manhattan is a bit misleading

61
0:02:58.787,000 --> 0:03:02,000
because the red color is uses that are mixed vertically.

62
0:03:02.991,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So this is the big story of the New Urbanists --

63
0:03:05.719,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to acknowledge that there are only two ways

64
0:03:08.255,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that have been tested by the thousands

65
0:03:10.569,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to build communities, in the world and throughout history.

66
0:03:13.533,000 --> 0:03:14,000
One is the traditional neighborhood.

67
0:03:15.435,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You see here several neighborhoods of Newburyport, Massachusetts,

68
0:03:18.873,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which is defined as being compact and being diverse --

69
0:03:23.164,000 --> 0:03:27,000
places to live, work, shop, recreate, get educated --

70
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
all within walking distance.

71
0:03:29.233,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And it's defined as being walkable.

72
0:03:31.393,000 --> 0:03:32,000
There are lots of small streets.

73
0:03:32.951,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Each one is comfortable to walk on.

74
0:03:34.701,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And we contrast that to the other way,

75
0:03:37.239,000 --> 0:03:39,000
an invention that happened after the Second World War,

76
0:03:40.082,000 --> 0:03:41,000
suburban sprawl,

77
0:03:41.364,000 --> 0:03:45,000
clearly not compact, clearly not diverse, and it's not walkable,

78
0:03:45.965,000 --> 0:03:46,000
because so few of the streets connect,

79
0:03:47.887,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that those streets that do connect become overburdened,

80
0:03:50.794,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and you wouldn't let your kid out on them.

81
0:03:52.908,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And I want to thank Alex Maclean, the aerial photographer,

82
0:03:55.783,000 --> 0:03:58,000
for many of these beautiful pictures that I'm showing you today.

83
0:03:58.862,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So it's fun to break sprawl down into its constituent parts.

84
0:04:02.506,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It's so easy to understand,

85
0:04:04.107,000 --> 0:04:07,000
the places where you only live, the places where you only work,

86
0:04:07.964,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the places where you only shop,

87
0:04:09.944,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and our super-sized public institutions.

88
0:04:13.312,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Schools get bigger and bigger,

89
0:04:14.776,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and therefore, further and further from each other.

90
0:04:17.196,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And the ratio of the size of the parking lot

91
0:04:20.349,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to the size of the school

92
0:04:21.589,000 --> 0:04:22,000
tells you all you need to know,

93
0:04:23.229,000 --> 0:04:25,000
which is that no child has ever walked to this school,

94
0:04:25.791,000 --> 0:04:26,000
no child will ever walk to this school.

95
0:04:27.72,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The seniors and juniors are driving the freshmen and the sophomores,

96
0:04:31.584,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and of course we have the crash statistics to prove it.

97
0:04:34.232,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And then the super-sizing of our other civic institutions

98
0:04:37.724,000 --> 0:04:38,000
like playing fields --

99
0:04:38.918,000 --> 0:04:41,000
it's wonderful that Westin in the Ft. Lauderdale area

100
0:04:42.815,000 --> 0:04:45,000
has eight soccer fields and eight baseball diamonds

101
0:04:45.907,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and 20 tennis courts,

102
0:04:47.79,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but look at the road that takes you to that location,

103
0:04:51.426,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and would you let your child bike on it?

104
0:04:53.396,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And this is why we have the soccer mom now.

105
0:04:55.55,000 --> 0:04:57,000
When I was young, I had one soccer field,

106
0:04:57.816,000 --> 0:04:59,000
one baseball diamond and one tennis court,

107
0:04:59.865,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but I could walk to it, because it was in my neighborhood.

108
0:05:02.747,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Then the final part of sprawl that everyone forgot to count:

109
0:05:05.622,000 --> 0:05:07,000
if you're going to separate everything from everything else

110
0:05:08.466,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and reconnect it only with automotive infrastructure,

111
0:05:11.024,000 --> 0:05:13,000
then this is what your landscape begins to look like.

112
0:05:13.57,000 --> 0:05:14,000
The main message here is:

113
0:05:14.809,000 --> 0:05:17,000
if you want to have a walkable city, you can't start with the sprawl model.

114
0:05:18.435,000 --> 0:05:2,000
you need the bones of an urban model.

115
0:05:20.53,000 --> 0:05:22,000
This is the outcome of that form of design,

116
0:05:23.402,000 --> 0:05:24,000
as is this.

117
0:05:24.817,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And this is something that a lot of Americans want.

118
0:05:27.43,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But we have to understand it's a two-part American dream.

119
0:05:30.167,000 --> 0:05:31,000
If you're dreaming for this,

120
0:05:31.551,000 --> 0:05:34,000
you're also going to be dreaming of this, often to absurd extremes,

121
0:05:34.956,000 --> 0:05:36,000
when we build our landscape to accommodate cars first.

122
0:05:37.597,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And the experience of being in these places --

123
0:05:39.862,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:40.903,000 --> 0:05:41,000
This is not Photoshopped.

125
0:05:42.307,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Walter Kulash took this slide.

126
0:05:44.333,000 --> 0:05:45,000
It's in Panama City.

127
0:05:46.054,000 --> 0:05:47,000
This is a real place.

128
0:05:47.867,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And being a driver can be a bit of a nuisance,

129
0:05:50.37,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and being a pedestrian can be a bit of a nuisance

130
0:05:52.859,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in these places.

131
0:05:54.384,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This is a slide that epidemiologists have been showing for some time now,

132
0:05:57.882,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

133
0:05:58.922,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The fact that we have a society where you drive to the parking lot

134
0:06:02.411,000 --> 0:06:03,000
to take the escalator to the treadmill

135
0:06:04.309,000 --> 0:06:05,000
shows that we're doing something wrong.

136
0:06:06.261,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But we know how to do it better.

137
0:06:07.857,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Here are the two models contrasted.

138
0:06:09.564,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I show this slide,

139
0:06:10.743,000 --> 0:06:12,000
which has been a formative document of the New Urbanism now

140
0:06:13.553,000 --> 0:06:14,000
for almost 30 years,

141
0:06:14.981,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to show that sprawl and the traditional neighborhood contain the same things.

142
0:06:19.164,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It's just how big are they,

143
0:06:20.574,000 --> 0:06:21,000
how close are they to each other,

144
0:06:22.197,000 --> 0:06:23,000
how are they interspersed together

145
0:06:23.896,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and do you have a street network, rather than a cul-de-sac

146
0:06:26.837,000 --> 0:06:28,000
or a collector system of streets?

147
0:06:28.896,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So when we look at a downtown area,

148
0:06:30.737,000 --> 0:06:32,000
at a place that has a hope of being walkable,

149
0:06:32.896,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and mostly that's our downtowns in America's cities

150
0:06:35.478,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and towns and villages,

151
0:06:37.27,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we look at them and say we want the proper balance of uses.

152
0:06:40.359,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So what is missing or underrepresented?

153
0:06:42.518,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And again, in the typical American cities in which most Americans live,

154
0:06:46.202,000 --> 0:06:48,000
it is housing that is lacking.

155
0:06:48.236,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The jobs-to-housing balance is off.

156
0:06:50.45,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And you find that when you bring housing back,

157
0:06:52.657,000 --> 0:06:54,000
these other things start to come back too,

158
0:06:54.747,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and housing is usually first among those things.

159
0:06:57.247,000 --> 0:07:,000
And, of course, the thing that shows up last and eventually

160
0:07:00.375,000 --> 0:07:01,000
is the schools,

161
0:07:01.58,000 --> 0:07:03,000
because the people have to move in,

162
0:07:03.924,000 --> 0:07:07,000
the young pioneers have to move in, get older, have kids

163
0:07:08.769,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and fight, and then the schools get pretty good eventually.

164
0:07:11.831,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The other part of this part,

165
0:07:14.157,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the useful city part,

166
0:07:17.672,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is transit,

167
0:07:19.001,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and you can have a perfectly walkable neighborhood without it.

168
0:07:22.39,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But perfectly walkable cities require transit,

169
0:07:25.719,000 --> 0:07:28,000
because if you don't have access to the whole city as a pedestrian,

170
0:07:29.184,000 --> 0:07:3,000
then you get a car,

171
0:07:30.369,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and if you get a car,

172
0:07:31.548,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the city begins to reshape itself around your needs,

173
0:07:34.12,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and the streets get wider and the parking lots get bigger

174
0:07:36.826,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and you no longer have a walkable city.

175
0:07:38.727,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So transit is essential.

176
0:07:39.906,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But every transit experience, every transit trip,

177
0:07:42.331,000 --> 0:07:43,000
begins or ends as a walk,

178
0:07:44.25,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and so we have to remember to build walkability around our transit stations.

179
0:07:48.072,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Next category, the biggest one, is the safe walk.

180
0:07:50.841,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's what most walkability experts talk about.

181
0:07:53.081,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It is essential, but alone not enough to get people to walk.

182
0:07:57.146,000 --> 0:08:,000
And there are so many moving parts that add up to a walkable city.

183
0:08:00.313,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The first is block size.

184
0:08:01.913,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This is Portland, Oregon,

185
0:08:03.284,000 --> 0:08:06,000
famously 200-foot blocks, famously walkable.

186
0:08:06.874,000 --> 0:08:07,000
This is Salt Lake City,

187
0:08:08.216,000 --> 0:08:1,000
famously 600-foot blocks,

188
0:08:10.32,000 --> 0:08:11,000
famously unwalkable.

189
0:08:11.713,000 --> 0:08:14,000
If you look at the two, it's almost like two different planets,

190
0:08:14.743,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but these places were both built by humans

191
0:08:17.083,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and in fact, the story is that when you have a 200-foot block city,

192
0:08:20.747,000 --> 0:08:21,000
you can have a two-lane city,

193
0:08:22.305,000 --> 0:08:23,000
or a two-to-four lane city,

194
0:08:23.746,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and a 600-foot block city is a six-lane city, and that's a problem.

195
0:08:27.795,000 --> 0:08:28,000
These are the crash statistics.

196
0:08:29.297,000 --> 0:08:31,000
When you double the block size --

197
0:08:31.407,000 --> 0:08:33,000
this was a study of 24 California cities --

198
0:08:33.464,000 --> 0:08:34,000
when you double the block size,

199
0:08:34.98,000 --> 0:08:37,000
you almost quadruple the number of fatal accidents

200
0:08:38.63,000 --> 0:08:4,000
on non-highway streets.

201
0:08:40.655,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So how many lanes do we have?

202
0:08:42.91,000 --> 0:08:45,000
This is where I'm going to tell you what I tell every audience I meet,

203
0:08:46.411,000 --> 0:08:48,000
which is to remind you about induced demand.

204
0:08:49.165,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Induced demand applies both to highways and to city streets.

205
0:08:53.626,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And induced demand tells us that when we widen the streets

206
0:08:57.135,000 --> 0:09:,000
to accept the congestion that we're anticipating,

207
0:09:00.257,000 --> 0:09:02,000
or the additional trips that we're anticipating

208
0:09:02.618,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in congested systems, it is principally that congestion

209
0:09:06.555,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that is constraining demand,

210
0:09:08.572,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and so that the widening comes,

211
0:09:10.358,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and there are all of these latent trips that are ready to happen.

212
0:09:13.498,000 --> 0:09:14,000
People move further from work

213
0:09:14.911,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and make other choices about when they commute,

214
0:09:17.168,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and those lanes fill up very quickly with traffic,

215
0:09:19.566,000 --> 0:09:21,000
so we widen the street again, and they fill up again.

216
0:09:22.091,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And we've learned that in congested systems,

217
0:09:24.341,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we cannot satisfy the automobile.

218
0:09:26.78,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This is from Newsweek Magazine -- hardly an esoteric publication:

219
0:09:30.254,000 --> 0:09:31,000
"Today's engineers acknowledge

220
0:09:31.946,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that building new roads usually makes traffic worse."

221
0:09:35.196,000 --> 0:09:38,000
My response to reading this was, may I please meet some of these engineers,

222
0:09:38.783,000 --> 0:09:4,000
because these are not the ones that I --

223
0:09:40.873,000 --> 0:09:42,000
there are great exceptions that I'm working with now --

224
0:09:43.487,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but these are not the engineers one typically meets working in a city,

225
0:09:46.817,000 --> 0:09:49,000
where they say, "Oh, that road is too crowded, we need to add a lane."

226
0:09:50.307,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So you add a lane, and the traffic comes,

227
0:09:52.491,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and they say, "See, I told you we needed that lane."

228
0:09:54.972,000 --> 0:09:57,000
This applies both to highways and to city streets if they're congested.

229
0:09:58.788,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But the amazing thing about most American cities that I work in,

230
0:10:01.847,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the more typical cities,

231
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
is that they have a lot of streets that are actually oversized

232
0:10:06.216,000 --> 0:10:08,000
for the congestion they're currently experiencing.

233
0:10:08.647,000 --> 0:10:09,000
This was the case in Oklahoma City,

234
0:10:10.394,000 --> 0:10:12,000
when the mayor came running to me, very upset,

235
0:10:12.937,000 --> 0:10:14,000
because they were named in Prevention Magazine

236
0:10:15.365,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the worst city for pedestrians in the entire country.

237
0:10:18.542,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now that can't possibly be true,

238
0:10:20.272,000 --> 0:10:23,000
but it certainly is enough to make a mayor do something about it.

239
0:10:23.425,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We did a walkability study,

240
0:10:24.758,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and what we found, looking at the car counts on the street --

241
0:10:28.117,000 --> 0:10:31,000
these are 3,000-, 4,000-, 7,000-car counts

242
0:10:31.816,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and we know that two lanes can handle 10,000 cars per day.

243
0:10:35.787,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Look at these numbers -- they're all near or under 10,000 cars,

244
0:10:40.468,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and these were the streets that were designated

245
0:10:43.066,000 --> 0:10:45,000
in the new downtown plan

246
0:10:45.302,000 --> 0:10:47,000
to be four lanes to six lanes wide.

247
0:10:47.96,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So you had a fundamental disconnect between the number of lanes

248
0:10:51.229,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and the number of cars that wanted to use them.

249
0:10:53.495,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So it was my job to redesign every street in the downtown

250
0:10:57.434,000 --> 0:10:58,000
from curb face to curb face,

251
0:10:59.193,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and we did it for 50 blocks of streets,

252
0:11:01.219,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and we're rebuilding it now.

253
0:11:02.6,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So a typical oversized street to nowhere

254
0:11:05.664,000 --> 0:11:07,000
is being narrowed, and now under construction,

255
0:11:07.888,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and the project is half done.

256
0:11:09.552,000 --> 0:11:1,000
The typical street like this, you know,

257
0:11:11.567,000 --> 0:11:14,000
when you do that, you find room for medians.

258
0:11:15.037,000 --> 0:11:16,000
You find room for bike lanes.

259
0:11:17.043,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We've doubled the amount of on-street parking.

260
0:11:19.234,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We've added a full bike network where one didn't exist before.

261
0:11:23.207,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But not everyone has the money that Oklahoma City has,

262
0:11:26.478,000 --> 0:11:29,000
because they have an extraction economy that's doing quite well.

263
0:11:29.586,000 --> 0:11:31,000
The typical city is more like Cedar Rapids,

264
0:11:31.662,000 --> 0:11:34,000
where they have an all four-lane system, half one-way system.

265
0:11:35.676,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And it's a little hard to see,

266
0:11:37.149,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but what we've done -- what we're doing; it's in process right now,

267
0:11:40.457,000 --> 0:11:41,000
it's in engineering right now --

268
0:11:42.085,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is turning an all four-lane system, half one-way

269
0:11:45.9,000 --> 0:11:48,000
into an all two-lane system, all two-way,

270
0:11:49.501,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and in so doing, we're adding 70 percent more on-street parking,

271
0:11:52.766,000 --> 0:11:53,000
which the merchants love,

272
0:11:54.149,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and it protects the sidewalk.

273
0:11:55.593,000 --> 0:11:56,000
That parking makes the sidewalk safe,

274
0:11:57.379,000 --> 0:12:,000
and we're adding a much more robust bicycle network.

275
0:12:01.081,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Then the lanes themselves. How wide are they?

276
0:12:03.686,000 --> 0:12:04,000
That's really important.

277
0:12:04.92,000 --> 0:12:07,000
The standards have changed such that, as Andrés Duany says,

278
0:12:08.11,000 --> 0:12:1,000
the typical road to a subdivision in America

279
0:12:10.228,000 --> 0:12:12,000
allows you to see the curvature of the Earth.

280
0:12:12.444,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Laughter)

281
0:12:13.507,000 --> 0:12:16,000
This is a subdivision outside of Washington from the 1960s.

282
0:12:16.776,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Look very carefully at the width of the streets.

283
0:12:19.121,000 --> 0:12:21,000
This is a subdivision from the 1980s.

284
0:12:21.252,000 --> 0:12:22,000
1960s, 1980s.

285
0:12:22.911,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The standards have changed to such a degree

286
0:12:24.959,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that my old neighborhood of South Beach,

287
0:12:26.936,000 --> 0:12:29,000
when it was time to fix the street that wasn't draining properly,

288
0:12:30.119,000 --> 0:12:32,000
they had to widen it and take away half our sidewalk,

289
0:12:32.687,000 --> 0:12:33,000
because the standards were wider.

290
0:12:34.45,000 --> 0:12:37,000
People go faster on wider streets.

291
0:12:37.929,000 --> 0:12:38,000
People know this.

292
0:12:39.11,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The engineers deny it, but the citizens know it,

293
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
so that in Birmingham, Michigan, they fight for narrower streets.

294
0:12:46.11,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Portland, Oregon, famously walkable,

295
0:12:48.656,000 --> 0:12:51,000
instituted its "Skinny Streets" program in its residential neighborhood.

296
0:12:52.225,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We know that skinny streets are safer.

297
0:12:54.099,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The developer Vince Graham, in his project I'On,

298
0:12:57.169,000 --> 0:12:58,000
which we worked on in South Carolina,

299
0:12:59.009,000 --> 0:13:02,000
he goes to conferences and he shows his amazing 22-foot roads.

300
0:13:02.948,000 --> 0:13:04,000
These are two-way roads, very narrow rights of way,

301
0:13:05.385,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and he shows this well-known philosopher,

302
0:13:07.408,000 --> 0:13:09,000
who said, "Broad is the road that leads to destruction ...

303
0:13:10.302,000 --> 0:13:12,000
narrow is the road that leads to life."

304
0:13:12.427,000 --> 0:13:14,000
(Laughter)

305
0:13:14.511,000 --> 0:13:16,000
(Applause)

306
0:13:16.904,000 --> 0:13:18,000
This plays very well in the South.

307
0:13:18.987,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Now: bicycles.

308
0:13:21.749,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Bicycles and bicycling are the current revolution underway

309
0:13:26.255,000 --> 0:13:27,000
in only some American cities.

310
0:13:27.962,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But where you build it, they come.

311
0:13:29.627,000 --> 0:13:33,000
As a planner, I hate to say that, but the one thing I can say

312
0:13:33.66,000 --> 0:13:37,000
is that bicycle population is a function of bicycle infrastructure.

313
0:13:37.811,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I asked my friend Tom Brennan from Nelson\Nygaard in Portland

314
0:13:41.25,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to send me some pictures of the Portland bike commute.

315
0:13:43.854,000 --> 0:13:45,000
He sent me this. I said, "Was that bike to work day?"

316
0:13:46.386,000 --> 0:13:47,000
He said, "No, that was Tuesday."

317
0:13:48.055,000 --> 0:13:52,000
When you do what Portland did and spend money on bicycle infrastructure --

318
0:13:53.043,000 --> 0:13:57,000
New York City has doubled the number of bikers in it several times now

319
0:13:57.288,000 --> 0:13:59,000
by painting these bright green lanes.

320
0:13:59.349,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Even automotive cities like Long Beach, California:

321
0:14:02.939,000 --> 0:14:06,000
vast uptick in the number of bikers based on the infrastructure.

322
0:14:07.042,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And of course, what really does it,

323
0:14:08.757,000 --> 0:14:1,000
if you know 15th Street here in Washington, DC --

324
0:14:11.157,000 --> 0:14:13,000
please meet Rahm Emanuel's new bike lanes in Chicago,

325
0:14:14.158,000 --> 0:14:17,000
the buffered lane, the parallel parking pulled off the curb,

326
0:14:17.56,000 --> 0:14:21,000
the bikes between the parked cars and the curb --

327
0:14:21.586,000 --> 0:14:22,000
these mint cyclists.

328
0:14:23.531,000 --> 0:14:26,000
If, however, as in Pasadena, every lane is a bike lane,

329
0:14:27.106,000 --> 0:14:28,000
then no lane is a bike lane.

330
0:14:29.091,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And this is the only bicyclist that I met in Pasadena, so ...

331
0:14:32.227,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Laughter)

332
0:14:33.856,000 --> 0:14:34,000
The parallel parking I mentioned --

333
0:14:35.571,000 --> 0:14:36,000
it's an essential barrier of steel

334
0:14:37.217,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that protects the curb and pedestrians from moving vehicles.

335
0:14:41.027,000 --> 0:14:44,000
This is Ft. Lauderdale; one side of the street, you can park,

336
0:14:44.647,000 --> 0:14:45,000
the other side of the street, you can't.

337
0:14:46.623,000 --> 0:14:48,000
This is happy hour on the parking side.

338
0:14:48.672,000 --> 0:14:5,000
This is sad hour on the other side.

339
0:14:51.387,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And then the trees themselves slow cars down.

340
0:14:54.4,000 --> 0:14:56,000
They move slower when trees are next to the road,

341
0:14:56.71,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and, of course, sometimes they slow down very quickly.

342
0:14:59.939,000 --> 0:15:01,000
All the little details -- the curb return radius.

343
0:15:02.915,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Is it one foot or is it 40 feet?

344
0:15:04.601,000 --> 0:15:07,000
How swoopy is that curb to determine how fast the car goes

345
0:15:08.071,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and how much room you have to cross.

346
0:15:09.81,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And then I love this, because this is objective journalism.

347
0:15:13.256,000 --> 0:15:17,000
"Some say the entrance to CityCenter is not inviting to pedestrians."

348
0:15:17.359,000 --> 0:15:19,000
When every aspect of the landscape is swoopy,

349
0:15:19.841,000 --> 0:15:21,000
is aerodynamic, is stream-form geometrics,

350
0:15:22.538,000 --> 0:15:24,000
it says: "This is a vehicular place."

351
0:15:24.879,000 --> 0:15:29,000
So no one detail, no one speciality, can be allowed to set the stage.

352
0:15:29.978,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And here, you know, this street:

353
0:15:31.566,000 --> 0:15:34,000
yes, it will drain within a minute of the hundred-year storm,

354
0:15:35.482,000 --> 0:15:37,000
but this poor woman has to mount the curb every day.

355
0:15:38.298,000 --> 0:15:4,000
So then quickly, the comfortable walk has to do with the fact

356
0:15:41.268,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that all animals seek, simultaneously, prospect and refuge.

357
0:15:46.245,000 --> 0:15:48,000
We want to be able to see our predators,

358
0:15:48.369,000 --> 0:15:5,000
but we also want to feel that our flanks are covered.

359
0:15:50.912,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And so we're drawn to places that have good edges,

360
0:15:53.427,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and if you don't supply the edges, people won't want to be there.

361
0:15:56.779,000 --> 0:15:58,000
What's the proper ratio of height to width?

362
0:15:58.942,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Is it one to one? Three to one?

363
0:16:00.741,000 --> 0:16:03,000
If you get beyond one to six, you're not very comfortable anymore.

364
0:16:04.55,000 --> 0:16:05,000
You don't feel enclosed.

365
0:16:05.893,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Now, six to one in Salzburg can be perfectly delightful.

366
0:16:09.062,000 --> 0:16:11,000
The opposite of Salzburg is Houston.

367
0:16:12.307,000 --> 0:16:15,000
The point being the parking lot is the principal problem here.

368
0:16:15.931,000 --> 0:16:18,000
However, missing teeth, those empty lots can be issues as well,

369
0:16:19.53,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and if you have a missing corner because of an outdated zoning code,

370
0:16:22.799,000 --> 0:16:24,000
then you could have a missing nose in your neighborhood.

371
0:16:25.731,000 --> 0:16:26,000
That's what we had in my neighborhood.

372
0:16:27.592,000 --> 0:16:3,000
This was the zoning code that said I couldn't build on that site.

373
0:16:30.692,000 --> 0:16:33,000
As you may know, Washington, DC is now changing its zoning

374
0:16:34.443,000 --> 0:16:37,000
to allow sites like this to become sites like this.

375
0:16:37.597,000 --> 0:16:39,000
We needed a lot of variances to do that.

376
0:16:39.787,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Triangular houses can be interesting to build,

377
0:16:42.095,000 --> 0:16:44,000
but if you get one built, people generally like it.

378
0:16:44.821,000 --> 0:16:46,000
So you've got to fill those missing noses.

379
0:16:47.298,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And then, finally, the interesting walk:

380
0:16:49.28,000 --> 0:16:5,000
signs of humanity.

381
0:16:50.976,000 --> 0:16:51,000
We are among the social primates.

382
0:16:52.815,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Nothing interests us more than other people.

383
0:16:55.027,000 --> 0:16:56,000
We want signs of people.

384
0:16:56.545,000 --> 0:16:59,000
So the perfect one-to-one ratio, it's a great thing.

385
0:16:59.572,000 --> 0:17:01,000
This is Grand Rapids, a very walkable city,

386
0:17:01.8,000 --> 0:17:02,000
but nobody walks on this street

387
0:17:03.466,000 --> 0:17:05,000
that connects the two best hotels together,

388
0:17:05.601,000 --> 0:17:09,000
because if on the left, you have an exposed parking deck,

389
0:17:09.993,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and on the right, you have a conference facility

390
0:17:12.501,000 --> 0:17:15,000
that was apparently designed in admiration for that parking deck,

391
0:17:15.954,000 --> 0:17:17,000
then you don't attract that many people.

392
0:17:18.485,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Mayor Joe Riley, in his 10th term, Mayor of Charleston, South Carolina,

393
0:17:22.483,000 --> 0:17:24,000
taught us it only takes 25 feet of building

394
0:17:24.684,000 --> 0:17:26,000
to hide 250 feet of garage.

395
0:17:27.002,000 --> 0:17:29,000
This one I call the Chia Pet Garage. It's in South Beach.

396
0:17:29.746,000 --> 0:17:3,000
That active ground floor.

397
0:17:31.214,000 --> 0:17:33,000
I want to end with this project that I love to show.

398
0:17:33.957,000 --> 0:17:35,000
It's by Meleca Architects. It's in Columbus, Ohio.

399
0:17:36.492,000 --> 0:17:39,000
To the left is the convention center neighborhood, full of pedestrians.

400
0:17:40.206,000 --> 0:17:42,000
To the right is the Short North neighborhood -- ethnic,

401
0:17:42.894,000 --> 0:17:44,000
great restaurants, great shops, struggling.

402
0:17:45.615,000 --> 0:17:47,000
It wasn't doing very well because this was the bridge,

403
0:17:48.193,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and no one was walking from the convention center

404
0:17:50.684,000 --> 0:17:51,000
into that neighborhood.

405
0:17:52.057,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Well, when they rebuilt the highway, they added an extra 80 feet to the bridge.

406
0:17:56.374,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Sorry -- they rebuilt the bridge over the highway.

407
0:17:58.872,000 --> 0:18:,000
The city paid 1.9 million dollars,

408
0:18:01.269,000 --> 0:18:03,000
they gave the site to a developer,

409
0:18:03.539,000 --> 0:18:04,000
the developer built this

410
0:18:04.954,000 --> 0:18:06,000
and now the Short North has come back to life.

411
0:18:07.297,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And everyone says, the newspapers, not the planning magazines,

412
0:18:10.537,000 --> 0:18:12,000
the newspapers say it's because of that bridge.

413
0:18:12.782,000 --> 0:18:14,000
So that's it. That's the general theory of walkability.

414
0:18:15.426,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Think about your own cities.

415
0:18:17.47,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Think about how you can apply it.

416
0:18:19.911,000 --> 0:18:2,000
You've got to do all four things at once.

417
0:18:21.889,000 --> 0:18:23,000
So find those places where you have most of them

418
0:18:24.222,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and fix what you can,

419
0:18:26.151,000 --> 0:18:28,000
fix what still needs fixing in those places.

420
0:18:28.859,000 --> 0:18:29,000
I really appreciate your attention,

421
0:18:30.651,000 --> 0:18:32,000
and thank you for coming today.

422
0:18:33.351,000 --> 0:18:35,000
(Applause)

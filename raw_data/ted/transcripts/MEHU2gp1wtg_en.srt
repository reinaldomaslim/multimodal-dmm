1
0:00:12.881,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Jeanie, Will and Adina are three senior citizens

2
0:00:16.556,000 --> 0:00:18,000
connected by a special relationship.

3
0:00:19.873,000 --> 0:00:23,000
They view their bond as a shield from the loneliness of aging.

4
0:00:24.418,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I first met them at a retirement home in Los Angeles,

5
0:00:27.499,000 --> 0:00:3,000
where I had been photographing for three years.

6
0:00:30.569,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I saw as they approached the gate one night,

7
0:00:33.268,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and felt an immediate connection to them.

8
0:00:36.522,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Although I didn't know the details of their love triangle,

9
0:00:40.458,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I intuitively felt that I had to find out who they were.

10
0:00:45.379,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Questioning a nurse a day later, she said to me,

11
0:00:49.22,000 --> 0:00:51,000
"Oh, you're talking about the threesome."

12
0:00:52.197,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:53.402,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was intrigued.

14
0:00:54.958,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:57.727,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The trio set out on a daily adventure to coffee and doughnut shops,

16
0:01:01.847,000 --> 0:01:02,000
bus stops and street corners.

17
0:01:04.188,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I soon learned that the purpose of these outings was solace

18
0:01:08.157,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and a search for meaning.

19
0:01:10.038,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The trio sought to combat their alienation

20
0:01:13.292,000 --> 0:01:16,000
by literally integrating themselves in public streets.

21
0:01:17.48,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Yet, even when arm in arm, no one saw them.

22
0:01:22.893,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We often think that as we age, we lose the desires held in our youth.

23
0:01:28.085,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Actually, as a teenage photojournalist when I met the trio,

24
0:01:32.268,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I saw their behavior as a mirror

25
0:01:34.698,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to the fears of exclusion and desires for intimacy

26
0:01:38.904,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that I also carried.

27
0:01:41.196,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I related to their invisibility,

28
0:01:43.927,000 --> 0:01:45,000
which pained me during my childhood

29
0:01:46.434,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but has become my greatest asset as an immersive documentarian,

30
0:01:51.53,000 --> 0:01:54,000
because I can just fade into my empathy.

31
0:01:55.498,000 --> 0:01:57,000
As we walked down the streets of Hollywood,

32
0:01:57.593,000 --> 0:02:,000
in a neighborhood of screenwriters, actors and filmmakers,

33
0:02:01.085,000 --> 0:02:05,000
the trio assumed the invisibility that each senior does.

34
0:02:05.8,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I would ask myself,

35
0:02:07.704,000 --> 0:02:11,000
"How is it that no one else sees these three human beings?

36
0:02:12.3,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Why is it that I am the only one who sees them?"

37
0:02:16.871,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Years later, as I began to share this work with the public,

38
0:02:20.514,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I noticed that people are largely uncomfortable with this story.

39
0:02:24.736,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Perhaps it is because the trio doesn't assume conventional notions

40
0:02:29.339,000 --> 0:02:32,000
associated with love, romance or partnership.

41
0:02:33.617,000 --> 0:02:36,000
They were unseen in public and shunned by their peers.

42
0:02:37.898,000 --> 0:02:39,000
They wanted to belong somewhere

43
0:02:40.342,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but only seemed to belong with each other.

44
0:02:43.445,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I wanted to belong somewhere, too.

45
0:02:45.919,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And my camera has been a catalyst for me to belong everywhere.

46
0:02:50.744,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But beyond challenging sociocultural norms about the elderly,

47
0:02:54.641,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the trio sheds light on fear of remoteness.

48
0:02:58.411,000 --> 0:03:02,000
At the end of each day, they return to their respective retirement homes.

49
0:03:03.58,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Under the surface of their aloneness,

50
0:03:06.438,000 --> 0:03:1,000
there is a desire for community, for their people.

51
0:03:11.315,000 --> 0:03:15,000
There was a sense that they were each yearning for their tribe,

52
0:03:15.633,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but that comfort comes with compromise,

53
0:03:18.569,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because Will cannot commit to one woman.

54
0:03:22.051,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Sitting with Jeanie one day in her apartment, she said to me,

55
0:03:26.043,000 --> 0:03:29,000
"Sharing Will is a thorn in your side.

56
0:03:29.432,000 --> 0:03:33,000
A relationship between a man and a woman is private.

57
0:03:33.926,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It is a couple, not a trio."

58
0:03:37.926,000 --> 0:03:4,000
My process is to essentially become the people I document

59
0:03:41.323,000 --> 0:03:44,000
by spending years with them as an observer-occupant,

60
0:03:45.196,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to create a safe space, to then become hidden in plain sight.

61
0:03:50.315,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I was about 17 when I met the trio,

62
0:03:52.879,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and I shadowed them for four years.

63
0:03:55.784,000 --> 0:03:58,000
We actually see, in the breakdown of social development,

64
0:03:58.998,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that adolescence and old age look strikingly alike,

65
0:04:03.402,000 --> 0:04:06,000
because both are periods of identity confusion.

66
0:04:07.68,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I identified with the women.

67
0:04:10.22,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But also with Will, who made me aware of the divide in me.

68
0:04:15.505,000 --> 0:04:18,000
The schism that we each often have

69
0:04:18.737,000 --> 0:04:22,000
about what we crave and the actuality of our situation.

70
0:04:23.847,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Before shooting this series,

71
0:04:25.721,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I was also in love with two different people who knew about each other,

72
0:04:29.41,000 --> 0:04:31,000
being the object over which they fought.

73
0:04:32.411,000 --> 0:04:35,000
But I also knew what it was like to be at the base of the triangle,

74
0:04:36.427,000 --> 0:04:37,000
like Jeanie or Adina,

75
0:04:38.173,000 --> 0:04:39,000
asking myself,

76
0:04:39.855,000 --> 0:04:41,000
"Why aren't I enough?"

77
0:04:43.442,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I would look through my viewfinder and see three elderly figures,

78
0:04:47.411,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and it became impossible to deny that regardless of age,

79
0:04:51.816,000 --> 0:04:56,000
we were each in pursuit of filling the proverbial hole through other people.

80
0:04:58.305,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Perhaps the discomfort of looking at Jeanie, Will and Adina's story

81
0:05:02.742,000 --> 0:05:07,000
is truly a reminder that even at the end of life,

82
0:05:07.831,000 --> 0:05:12,000
we may never reach the fantasy we have envisioned for ourselves.

83
0:05:13.548,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Thank you for listening.

84
0:05:14.768,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Applause)

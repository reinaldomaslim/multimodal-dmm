1
0:00:12.879,000 --> 0:00:13,000
As an archaeologist,

2
0:00:14.386,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm most often asked what my favorite discovery is.

3
0:00:18.421,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The answer's easy:

4
0:00:20.649,000 --> 0:00:21,000
my husband, Greg.

5
0:00:22.207,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:23.602,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We met in Egypt on my first dig.

7
0:00:25.969,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It was my first lesson in finding unexpected, wonderful things.

8
0:00:31.761,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This began an incredible archaeological partnership.

9
0:00:36.262,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Years later, I proposed to him in front of our favorite pair statue

10
0:00:41.429,000 --> 0:00:44,000
of the Prince and Princess Rahotep and Nofret,

11
0:00:44.614,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in the Cairo Museum,

12
0:00:45.879,000 --> 0:00:47,000
dating to 4,600 years ago.

13
0:00:48.435,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I thought if I was going to ask Greg to spend the rest of this life with me,

14
0:00:53.483,000 --> 0:00:55,000
then I should ask him in front of two people

15
0:00:56.284,000 --> 0:00:59,000
who had pledged to be together for eternity.

16
0:01:01.002,000 --> 0:01:03,000
These symbols endure because when we look at them,

17
0:01:03.902,000 --> 0:01:04,000
we're looking at mirrors.

18
0:01:05.78,000 --> 0:01:07,000
They are powerful reminders

19
0:01:07.822,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that our common humanity has not changed.

20
0:01:11.627,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The thrill of archaeological discovery is as powerful as love,

21
0:01:17.031,000 --> 0:01:22,000
because ancient history is the most seductive mistress imaginable.

22
0:01:22.936,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Many archaeologists have devoted their lives

23
0:01:25.263,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to unraveling the mysteries of the past

24
0:01:27.716,000 --> 0:01:28,000
under hot suns

25
0:01:30.405,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and Arctic winds

26
0:01:32.37,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and in dense rainforests.

27
0:01:35.338,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Many seek.

28
0:01:36.84,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Some discover.

29
0:01:38.015,000 --> 0:01:4,000
All worship at the temple of possibility

30
0:01:40.857,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that one discovery might change history.

31
0:01:45.44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
On my first day in Egypt, I worked at a site

32
0:01:47.969,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in the Northeast Egyptian Delta called Mendes, dating to 4,200 years ago,

33
0:01:53.633,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in a cemetery.

34
0:01:54.808,000 --> 0:01:55,000
That's a picture of me --

35
0:01:56.032,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I'm just in my bliss.

36
0:01:57.708,000 --> 0:02:01,000
On the dig, surrounded by emerald green rice paddies,

37
0:02:01.745,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I discovered an intact pot.

38
0:02:05.592,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Flipping it over,

39
0:02:07.242,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I discovered a human thumbprint left by whoever made the vessel.

40
0:02:12.554,000 --> 0:02:14,000
For a moment, time stood still.

41
0:02:15.888,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I didn't know where I was.

42
0:02:17.775,000 --> 0:02:19,000
It was because at that moment I realized,

43
0:02:20.756,000 --> 0:02:21,000
when we dig,

44
0:02:22.158,000 --> 0:02:23,000
we're digging for people,

45
0:02:23.839,000 --> 0:02:24,000
not things.

46
0:02:26.484,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Never are we so present as when we are in the midst of the great past.

47
0:02:32.333,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I can't tell you how many times I've stood in front of the Pyramids of Giza,

48
0:02:37.175,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and they leave me speechless.

49
0:02:39.464,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I feel like the luckiest person in the world.

50
0:02:43.795,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They're a monument to our human brilliance and everything that is possible.

51
0:02:49.677,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Many cannot process their brilliance as human --

52
0:02:52.67,000 --> 0:02:53,000
they think aliens built them.

53
0:02:55.07,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But this is ridiculous.

54
0:02:57.072,000 --> 0:03:,000
All you need to do is get up close and personal,

55
0:03:00.42,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and see the hidden hand of man

56
0:03:02.916,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in the chisel marks left by the tools that built them.

57
0:03:08.024,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The Great Pyramid of Giza was built one stone at a time

58
0:03:11.8,000 --> 0:03:14,000
with 2.3 million blocks,

59
0:03:14.992,000 --> 0:03:16,000
with incredible bureaucratic efficiency.

60
0:03:19.124,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It is not the pyramids that stand the test of time;

61
0:03:22.113,000 --> 0:03:23,000
it is human ingenuity.

62
0:03:24.376,000 --> 0:03:27,000
That is our shared human brilliance.

63
0:03:29.343,000 --> 0:03:31,000
History may be cyclical,

64
0:03:32.577,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but we are singular.

65
0:03:35.588,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I love what I do,

66
0:03:37.188,000 --> 0:03:39,000
because I learn that we haven't changed.

67
0:03:41.306,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I get to read about mother-in-law jokes from Mesopotamia

68
0:03:45.514,000 --> 0:03:46,000
from 3,500 years ago.

69
0:03:47.09,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

70
0:03:49.795,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I get to hear about neighbors cursing each other

71
0:03:53.223,000 --> 0:03:55,000
from 4,600 years ago in Egypt.

72
0:03:55.745,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And my absolute favorite, from 3,300 years ago in Luxor:

73
0:04:00.372,000 --> 0:04:05,000
an inscription that describes schoolboys who cut class to go drinking.

74
0:04:05.904,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Laughter)

75
0:04:07.898,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Kids these days.

76
0:04:09.89,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:11.702,000 --> 0:04:14,000
I get to see the most incredible architecture,

78
0:04:15.864,000 --> 0:04:17,000
see stunning sculptures --

79
0:04:18.018,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I mean, this is basically a selfie in stone --

80
0:04:20.885,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and see that we've always rocked serious bling.

81
0:04:25.037,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And also, we've been posting on walls

82
0:04:28.031,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and obsessing about cats --

83
0:04:30.134,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:31.165,000 --> 0:04:32,000
for thousands of years.

85
0:04:32.702,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:33.733,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Applause)

87
0:04:38.606,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Archaeologists are the cultural memory preservers

88
0:04:41.98,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and the spokespeople

89
0:04:43.645,000 --> 0:04:46,000
for the billions of people and the thousands of cultures

90
0:04:47.001,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that came before us.

91
0:04:48.956,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Good science, imagination and a leap of faith

92
0:04:52.075,000 --> 0:04:55,000
are the trifecta we use to raise the dead.

93
0:04:56.813,000 --> 0:04:57,000
In the last year,

94
0:04:58.008,000 --> 0:05:01,000
archaeologists have made incredible discoveries, including:

95
0:05:02.014,000 --> 0:05:04,000
new human ancestors from South Africa;

96
0:05:05.38,000 --> 0:05:08,000
tools from 3.3 million years ago --

97
0:05:08.422,000 --> 0:05:1,000
these are the oldest tools ever discovered --

98
0:05:10.682,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in Kenya.

99
0:05:12.054,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And this, from a series of medical implements found

100
0:05:15.722,000 --> 0:05:17,000
from Blackbeard's ship from 1718.

101
0:05:18.965,000 --> 0:05:23,000
What you're looking at is a medical tool used to treat syphilis.

102
0:05:25.239,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Ouch!

103
0:05:26.483,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:27.867,000 --> 0:05:28,000
For each of these,

105
0:05:29.235,000 --> 0:05:32,000
there are thousands of other incredibly important discoveries

106
0:05:32.702,000 --> 0:05:33,000
made by my colleagues,

107
0:05:34.198,000 --> 0:05:35,000
that do not make headlines.

108
0:05:36.544,000 --> 0:05:42,000
However, I believe that the most important thing we do as archaeologists

109
0:05:42.742,000 --> 0:05:45,000
is acknowledge that past people existed

110
0:05:46.457,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and lived lives worth learning about.

111
0:05:49.593,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Can you even imagine what the world would be like today

112
0:05:53.179,000 --> 0:05:56,000
if we acknowledged all human beings in this way?

113
0:05:58.54,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So, on a dig, we have a challenge:

114
0:06:02.633,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it often looks like this.

115
0:06:04.396,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You can't see anything.

116
0:06:06.254,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Where are we going to start digging?

117
0:06:08.027,000 --> 0:06:09,000
This is from a site south of Cairo.

118
0:06:09.762,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Let's have a look from space.

119
0:06:12.409,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Again, you can't really see much.

120
0:06:14.371,000 --> 0:06:17,000
What you're looking at is a WorldView-3 satellite image,

121
0:06:18.182,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which has a .3 meter resolution.

122
0:06:21.265,000 --> 0:06:22,000
That's 10 inches.

123
0:06:22.667,000 --> 0:06:26,000
This means that you can zoom in from 400 miles in space

124
0:06:26.965,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and see your tablets.

125
0:06:29.451,000 --> 0:06:3,000
How do I know about this?

126
0:06:31.684,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's because I'm a space archaeologist.

127
0:06:36.026,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Let me repeat that.

128
0:06:37.863,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I am a space archaeologist.

129
0:06:40.656,000 --> 0:06:41,000
This means --

130
0:06:41.832,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Applause)

131
0:06:43.102,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Thank you.

132
0:06:44.776,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This means I use satellite images and process them using algorithms,

133
0:06:49.271,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and look at subtle differences in the light spectrum

134
0:06:51.931,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that indicate buried things under the ground

135
0:06:54.269,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that I get to go excavate and survey.

136
0:06:57.317,000 --> 0:06:58,000
By the way --

137
0:06:58.501,000 --> 0:07:,000
NASA has a Space Archaeology program,

138
0:07:01.102,000 --> 0:07:02,000
so it's a real job.

139
0:07:02.612,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

140
0:07:04.371,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So, let's have a look again.

141
0:07:05.859,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We're back at the site just south of Cairo.

142
0:07:07.968,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You can't see anything.

143
0:07:09.675,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Keep your eye on the red rectangle.

144
0:07:13.077,000 --> 0:07:15,000
When we process the image using algorithms --

145
0:07:15.728,000 --> 0:07:17,000
think like a space-based CAT scan --

146
0:07:19.271,000 --> 0:07:21,000
this is what you see.

147
0:07:21.894,000 --> 0:07:24,000
This rectilinear form is an ancient tomb

148
0:07:25.627,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that is previously unknown and unexcavated,

149
0:07:28.252,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and you all are the first people to see it in thousands of years.

150
0:07:33.662,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Applause)

151
0:07:39.143,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I believe we have barely scratched the surface

152
0:07:41.994,000 --> 0:07:43,000
in terms of what's left to discover.

153
0:07:44.918,000 --> 0:07:45,000
In the Egyptian Delta alone,

154
0:07:46.94,000 --> 0:07:49,000
we've excavated less than one-1000th of one percent

155
0:07:50.782,000 --> 0:07:52,000
of the total volume of Egyptian sites.

156
0:07:54.136,000 --> 0:07:56,000
When you add to that the thousands of other sites

157
0:07:56.498,000 --> 0:07:58,000
my team and I have discovered,

158
0:07:58.554,000 --> 0:08:01,000
what we thought we knew pales in comparison

159
0:08:02.333,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to what we have left to discover.

160
0:08:04.938,000 --> 0:08:05,000
When you look at the incredible work

161
0:08:06.765,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that my colleagues are doing all around the world

162
0:08:09.21,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and what they're finding,

163
0:08:11.041,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I believe that there are millions of undiscovered archaeological sites

164
0:08:16.663,000 --> 0:08:17,000
left to find.

165
0:08:18.394,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Discovering them will do nothing less

166
0:08:21.033,000 --> 0:08:24,000
than unlock the full potential of our existence.

167
0:08:26.234,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But we have a challenge.

168
0:08:29.143,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Over the last year,

169
0:08:30.754,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we've seen horrible headlines

170
0:08:33.402,000 --> 0:08:37,000
of incredible destruction going on to archaeological sites,

171
0:08:37.748,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and massive looting by people like ISIL.

172
0:08:41.414,000 --> 0:08:44,000
ISIL has destroyed temples at Palmyra.

173
0:08:45.06,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Who blows up a temple?

174
0:08:47.257,000 --> 0:08:49,000
They've destroyed the Tomb of Jonah.

175
0:08:50.02,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And we've seen looting at sites so rampant,

176
0:08:54.855,000 --> 0:08:56,000
it looks like craters of the moon.

177
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Knowing ISIL's desire to destroy modern human lives,

178
0:09:03.304,000 --> 0:09:07,000
it's a natural extension for them to destroy cultural identity as well.

179
0:09:07.716,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Countless invading armies have done the same throughout history.

180
0:09:11.638,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We know that ISIL is profiting from the looting of sites,

181
0:09:15.521,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but we don't know the scale.

182
0:09:17.834,000 --> 0:09:2,000
This means that any object purchased on the market today

183
0:09:21.779,000 --> 0:09:22,000
from the Middle East

184
0:09:22.959,000 --> 0:09:24,000
could potentially be funding terrorism.

185
0:09:26.562,000 --> 0:09:27,000
When a site is looted,

186
0:09:28.433,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it's as if a puzzle already missing 90 percent of it pieces

187
0:09:34.237,000 --> 0:09:36,000
has had the rest obscured beyond recognition.

188
0:09:37.498,000 --> 0:09:39,000
This is ancient identity theft writ large.

189
0:09:40.554,000 --> 0:09:42,000
We know that there are two kinds of looting going on:

190
0:09:43.07,000 --> 0:09:45,000
looting by criminal elements like ISIL,

191
0:09:45.78,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and then more local looting by those that are desperate for money.

192
0:09:50.069,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We would all do the same to feed our families;

193
0:09:53.335,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I don't blame the local looters.

194
0:09:55.508,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I blame the middlemen, the unethical traffickers

195
0:10:00.21,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and an international art market

196
0:10:02.218,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that exploits often ambiguous or even completely nonexistent laws.

197
0:10:08.758,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We know looting is going on on a global scale and it's increasing,

198
0:10:13.165,000 --> 0:10:16,000
but presently we don't have any tools to stop it.

199
0:10:16.942,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This is beginning to change.

200
0:10:19.122,000 --> 0:10:23,000
My team and I have just completed a study looking at looting in Egypt.

201
0:10:23.584,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We looked at open-source data

202
0:10:25.955,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and mapped the entirety of looting across Egypt

203
0:10:28.914,000 --> 0:10:3,000
from 2002 to 2013.

204
0:10:32.294,000 --> 0:10:36,000
We found evidence of looting and site destruction at 267 sites,

205
0:10:36.874,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and mapped over 200,000 looting pits.

206
0:10:41.721,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It's astonishing.

207
0:10:42.918,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And putting that data together --

208
0:10:44.615,000 --> 0:10:46,000
you can see the looting pits marked here.

209
0:10:48.262,000 --> 0:10:53,000
At one site, the looting got bad from 2009, 2011, 2012 --

210
0:10:53.577,000 --> 0:10:54,000
hundreds and hundreds of pits.

211
0:10:55.604,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Putting all the data together,

212
0:10:57.059,000 --> 0:11:,000
what we found is that, contrary to popular opinion,

213
0:11:00.134,000 --> 0:11:05,000
looting did not start to get worse in Egypt in 2011 after the Arab Spring,

214
0:11:05.219,000 --> 0:11:08,000
but in 2009, after the global recession.

215
0:11:09.351,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Thus, we've shown with big data

216
0:11:12.004,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that looting is fundamentally an economic issue.

217
0:11:16.793,000 --> 0:11:19,000
If we do nothing to stop the problem,

218
0:11:19.993,000 --> 0:11:23,000
all of Egypt's sites will be affected by looting by 2040.

219
0:11:24.504,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Thus, we are at a tipping point.

220
0:11:27.7,000 --> 0:11:3,000
We are the generation with all the tools and all the technologies

221
0:11:30.847,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to stop looting,

222
0:11:32.081,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but we're not working fast enough.

223
0:11:37.788,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Sometimes an archaeological site can surprise you with its resilience.

224
0:11:43.233,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I am just back from the field,

225
0:11:45.613,000 --> 0:11:48,000
where I co-led a joint mission with Egypt's Ministry of Antiquities

226
0:11:49.216,000 --> 0:11:5,000
at a site called Lisht.

227
0:11:51.052,000 --> 0:11:55,000
This site dates to the Middle Kingdom of Egypt between 2,000 and 1,750 BC.

228
0:11:56.314,000 --> 0:11:58,000
The Middle Kingdom was Ancient Egypt's Renaissance period.

229
0:11:59.093,000 --> 0:12:02,000
After a time of intense internal strife and environmental challenges,

230
0:12:03.021,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Egypt rebounded

231
0:12:04.299,000 --> 0:12:08,000
with an incredible resurgence of art, architecture and literature.

232
0:12:09.28,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It's a favorite period of time to study in Egypt,

233
0:12:11.702,000 --> 0:12:15,000
because it teaches us so much about how we can survive and thrive

234
0:12:15.932,000 --> 0:12:16,000
after great disasters.

235
0:12:17.611,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Now at this site, we had already mapped countless looting pits.

236
0:12:22.3,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Lisht is a royal site;

237
0:12:23.487,000 --> 0:12:25,000
there would have been thousands of people buried there

238
0:12:26.185,000 --> 0:12:28,000
who lived and worked at the court of Pharaoh.

239
0:12:28.323,000 --> 0:12:31,000
You can see this before and after; you see dozens of looting pits.

240
0:12:31.515,000 --> 0:12:32,000
North Lisht.

241
0:12:32.711,000 --> 0:12:34,000
This is in South Lisht, before and after.

242
0:12:36.787,000 --> 0:12:37,000
When we first visited the site,

243
0:12:38.316,000 --> 0:12:4,000
we could see the tombs of many high-ranking officials

244
0:12:40.944,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that had been looted.

245
0:12:42.85,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Let me put into perspective for you what was taken.

246
0:12:45.71,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Imagine a two meter by two meter area full of coffins, jewelry

247
0:12:51.019,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and incredible statuary.

248
0:12:53.055,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Multiply that times over a thousand.

249
0:12:57.122,000 --> 0:12:58,000
That's what was taken.

250
0:12:59.51,000 --> 0:13:,000
So, when we started work,

251
0:13:00.752,000 --> 0:13:03,000
my Egyptian co-director, Mohamed Youssef, approached me and said,

252
0:13:03.928,000 --> 0:13:05,000
"We must work at this one particular tomb.

253
0:13:06.763,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It's been attacked by looters.

254
0:13:08.546,000 --> 0:13:1,000
If we don't do anything, they'll be back."

255
0:13:10.586,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Of course I agreed, but I didn't think we'd find anything.

256
0:13:14.006,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I thought the looters had stolen everything.

257
0:13:16.152,000 --> 0:13:18,000
What we started to find were the most incredible reliefs.

258
0:13:19.173,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Look at this painting -- it's just stunning.

259
0:13:21.363,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We started finding engraved inscriptions.

260
0:13:24.042,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And even the titles of the tomb owner --

261
0:13:26.137,000 --> 0:13:28,000
he had titles like, "Overseer of the Army,"

262
0:13:28.472,000 --> 0:13:29,000
"Overseer of the Treasury."

263
0:13:29.923,000 --> 0:13:3,000
I began to have hope.

264
0:13:31.521,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Maybe, just maybe we would find his name.

265
0:13:35.148,000 --> 0:13:37,000
For the ancient Egyptians, having their name last for eternity

266
0:13:38.159,000 --> 0:13:39,000
was their goal.

267
0:13:40.216,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And then one day,

268
0:13:41.813,000 --> 0:13:42,000
this appeared.

269
0:13:43.588,000 --> 0:13:46,000
This is the name of the tomb owner: Intef.

270
0:13:48.022,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You can see it written out here, in hieroglyphs.

271
0:13:50.679,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Working together with my Egyptian team,

272
0:13:53.459,000 --> 0:13:56,000
we had restored someone's name from 3,900 years ago.

273
0:13:57.762,000 --> 0:14:03,000
(Applause)

274
0:14:05.584,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Working together with my Egyptian colleagues,

275
0:14:07.762,000 --> 0:14:09,000
we celebrated this moment of shared discovery.

276
0:14:10.064,000 --> 0:14:12,000
What we were doing together was right and true.

277
0:14:13.39,000 --> 0:14:15,000
We found this incredible false door, mostly intact.

278
0:14:15.893,000 --> 0:14:18,000
On it we read about Intef and his inscriptions.

279
0:14:19.041,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You can actually even see him seated here.

280
0:14:23.092,000 --> 0:14:27,000
What I realized is that everything I had assumed about looted sites

281
0:14:27.709,000 --> 0:14:28,000
had been proven wrong.

282
0:14:29.4,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Every day on site we worked together with 70 Egyptians

283
0:14:32.749,000 --> 0:14:34,000
as colleagues and friends.

284
0:14:35.69,000 --> 0:14:37,000
In the face of so much hatred and ignorance

285
0:14:38.369,000 --> 0:14:4,000
against those in the Middle East,

286
0:14:40.393,000 --> 0:14:43,000
every moment on site felt like a protest for peace.

287
0:14:45.146,000 --> 0:14:47,000
When you work with those that don't look like you,

288
0:14:47.521,000 --> 0:14:49,000
or think like you, or speak like you,

289
0:14:49.637,000 --> 0:14:51,000
your shared mission of archaeological discovery

290
0:14:52.541,000 --> 0:14:54,000
erases all superficial differences.

291
0:14:56.888,000 --> 0:14:57,000
What I learned this season

292
0:14:58.452,000 --> 0:15:,000
is that archaeology isn't about what you find.

293
0:15:01.629,000 --> 0:15:03,000
It's about what you can prove possible.

294
0:15:05.193,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Sometimes when you travel, you end up finding long-lost family --

295
0:15:08.354,000 --> 0:15:1,000
not those with whom you share genes,

296
0:15:10.885,000 --> 0:15:11,000
but a shared entry in the book of life.

297
0:15:13.404,000 --> 0:15:15,000
This is Omer Farrouk, my brother.

298
0:15:16.769,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Omer's a Gufti from a village just North of Luxor, called Guft.

299
0:15:21.401,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Guftis are part of a celebrated tradition in Egyptology.

300
0:15:24.046,000 --> 0:15:26,000
They help with digging and work crew organization.

301
0:15:27.319,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Omer is my COO and CFO.

302
0:15:29.775,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I simply couldn't do work without him.

303
0:15:32.966,000 --> 0:15:35,000
One day many years ago, when I was a young graduate student

304
0:15:36.388,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and Omer was a young Gufti who couldn't speak much English,

305
0:15:40.495,000 --> 0:15:41,000
we learned, completely randomly,

306
0:15:42.495,000 --> 0:15:44,000
that we were born in the same year,

307
0:15:45.809,000 --> 0:15:46,000
the same month

308
0:15:47.434,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and the same day, six hours apart.

309
0:15:52.438,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Twins.

310
0:15:53.613,000 --> 0:15:54,000
(Laughter)

311
0:15:55.856,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Separated by an ocean, but forever connected

312
0:15:58.178,000 --> 0:16:,000
for Ancient Egypt is our mother.

313
0:16:00.867,000 --> 0:16:02,000
I knew then we'd always work together --

314
0:16:03.084,000 --> 0:16:04,000
not in my brain,

315
0:16:05.337,000 --> 0:16:09,000
but in the part of your soul that knows not everything can be explained.

316
0:16:11.35,000 --> 0:16:13,000
(Arabic) Omer by brother,

317
0:16:14.563,000 --> 0:16:16,000
I will always love you.

318
0:16:18.167,000 --> 0:16:21,000
(English) Omer my brother, I will always love you.

319
0:16:23.072,000 --> 0:16:25,000
So, just before my first dig in Egypt,

320
0:16:25.323,000 --> 0:16:28,000
my mentor, the very famous Egyptologist Professor William Kelly Simpson,

321
0:16:29.041,000 --> 0:16:3,000
called me into his office.

322
0:16:30.869,000 --> 0:16:33,000
He handed me a check for $2,000,

323
0:16:34.25,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and said, "This is to cover your expenses.

324
0:16:36.948,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Have a glorious adventure this summer.

325
0:16:39.548,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Someday you will do this for someone else."

326
0:16:43.981,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Thus, my TED Prize wish is partial payback, plus interest --

327
0:16:48.116,000 --> 0:16:49,000
(Laughter)

328
0:16:49.394,000 --> 0:16:53,000
for a great human being's generosity and kindness.

329
0:16:55.591,000 --> 0:16:56,000
So, my wish.

330
0:16:57.655,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I wish for us to discover the millions of unknown archaeological sites

331
0:17:03.346,000 --> 0:17:04,000
around the world.

332
0:17:04.981,000 --> 0:17:08,000
By creating a 21st-century army of global explorers,

333
0:17:09.443,000 --> 0:17:12,000
we'll find and protect the world's hidden heritage,

334
0:17:12.487,000 --> 0:17:16,000
which contains clues to humankind's collective resilience

335
0:17:17.122,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and creativity.

336
0:17:19.284,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Applause)

337
0:17:20.974,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Thank you.

338
0:17:22.188,000 --> 0:17:24,000
(Applause)

339
0:17:30.254,000 --> 0:17:31,000
So how are we going to do this?

340
0:17:32.899,000 --> 0:17:35,000
We are going to build with the TED Prize money

341
0:17:36.315,000 --> 0:17:4,000
an online, crowdsource, citizen science platform

342
0:17:40.397,000 --> 0:17:44,000
to allow anyone in the world to engage with discovering

343
0:17:44.707,000 --> 0:17:45,000
archaeological sites.

344
0:17:47.663,000 --> 0:17:5,000
There are only a couple hundred of us space archaeologists around the world.

345
0:17:51.313,000 --> 0:17:53,000
It is my dream to engage the world

346
0:17:54.008,000 --> 0:17:56,000
with helping to find sites and protect them.

347
0:17:57.492,000 --> 0:18:,000
What you'll do is sign in, create a username --

348
0:18:00.647,000 --> 0:18:02,000
note that this particular username is already taken.

349
0:18:03.332,000 --> 0:18:04,000
(Laughter)

350
0:18:05.214,000 --> 0:18:07,000
You'll take a tutorial and you'll start work.

351
0:18:07.399,000 --> 0:18:08,000
I want to note at the outset

352
0:18:08.838,000 --> 0:18:12,000
that in no way will be sharing GPS data or mapping data for sites.

353
0:18:12.957,000 --> 0:18:14,000
We want to treat them like human patient data,

354
0:18:15.484,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and not reveal their locations.

355
0:18:17.817,000 --> 0:18:21,000
You'll then be dealt a card from a deck -- 20 x 20 meters or 30 x 30 meters,

356
0:18:22.063,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and you'll be looking for features.

357
0:18:24.309,000 --> 0:18:25,000
My team and I will have batch-processed

358
0:18:26.303,000 --> 0:18:28,000
large amounts of satellite data using algorithms

359
0:18:28.83,000 --> 0:18:29,000
in order for you to find things,

360
0:18:30.397,000 --> 0:18:31,000
so you'll be doing really good science.

361
0:18:32.296,000 --> 0:18:33,000
You'll then be starting to look.

362
0:18:33.886,000 --> 0:18:34,000
What do you see? Do you see a temple?

363
0:18:35.832,000 --> 0:18:37,000
Do you see a tomb? Do you see a pyramid?

364
0:18:38.792,000 --> 0:18:41,000
Do you see any potential site damage or site looting?

365
0:18:42.348,000 --> 0:18:44,000
You'll then begin to mark what's there.

366
0:18:44.478,000 --> 0:18:47,000
And off to the side are always going to be rich examples

367
0:18:47.996,000 --> 0:18:49,000
of exactly what you're seeing, to help guide you.

368
0:18:50.965,000 --> 0:18:54,000
All the data that you help us collect will be shared with vetted authorities,

369
0:18:55.436,000 --> 0:18:58,000
and will help create a new global alarm system

370
0:18:58.656,000 --> 0:18:59,000
to help protect sites.

371
0:19:01.372,000 --> 0:19:02,000
But it's not just going to stop there.

372
0:19:04.488,000 --> 0:19:06,000
All the archaeologists with whom we share your discoveries

373
0:19:07.506,000 --> 0:19:1,000
will take you with them as they begin to excavate them,

374
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
by using Periscope, Google Plus and social media.

375
0:19:17.218,000 --> 0:19:2,000
A hundred years ago, archaeology was for the rich.

376
0:19:21.289,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Fifty years ago,

377
0:19:23.024,000 --> 0:19:24,000
it was for men.

378
0:19:24.675,000 --> 0:19:26,000
Now it's primarily for academics.

379
0:19:27.679,000 --> 0:19:31,000
Our goal is to democratize the process of archaeological discovery,

380
0:19:32.354,000 --> 0:19:34,000
and allow anyone to participate.

381
0:19:35.89,000 --> 0:19:36,000
Ninety-four years ago,

382
0:19:37.907,000 --> 0:19:39,000
Howard Carter discovered the tomb of King Tut.

383
0:19:41.91,000 --> 0:19:42,000
Who is the next Howard Carter?

384
0:19:45.543,000 --> 0:19:46,000
It might be you.

385
0:19:49.918,000 --> 0:19:5,000
By creating this platform,

386
0:19:51.55,000 --> 0:19:55,000
we will find the millions of places occupied by the billions of people

387
0:19:56.299,000 --> 0:19:57,000
that came before us.

388
0:19:58.53,000 --> 0:20:01,000
If we want to answer the big questions about who we are

389
0:20:01.756,000 --> 0:20:02,000
and where we've come from,

390
0:20:03.041,000 --> 0:20:07,000
the answers to those questions do not lie in pyramids or palaces,

391
0:20:07.504,000 --> 0:20:11,000
but in the cities and villages of those that came before us.

392
0:20:12.381,000 --> 0:20:14,000
If we want to learn about the past,

393
0:20:14.996,000 --> 0:20:16,000
it's time we inverted the pyramids.

394
0:20:19.098,000 --> 0:20:22,000
Acknowledging that the past is worth saving

395
0:20:22.642,000 --> 0:20:23,000
means so much more.

396
0:20:25.532,000 --> 0:20:28,000
It means that we're worth saving, too.

397
0:20:30.206,000 --> 0:20:33,000
And the greatest story ever told

398
0:20:34.77,000 --> 0:20:37,000
is the story of our shared human journey.

399
0:20:39.352,000 --> 0:20:42,000
But the only way we're going to be able to write it

400
0:20:42.669,000 --> 0:20:44,000
is if we do it together.

401
0:20:47.09,000 --> 0:20:48,000
Come with me.

402
0:20:48.778,000 --> 0:20:49,000
Thank you.

403
0:20:49.954,000 --> 0:20:52,000
(Applause)

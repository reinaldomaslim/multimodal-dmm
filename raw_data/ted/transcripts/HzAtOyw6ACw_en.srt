1
0:00:13.012,000 --> 0:00:15,000
A long time ago, there lived a Giant,

2
0:00:16.353,000 --> 0:00:2,000
a Selfish Giant, whose stunning garden was the most beautiful in all the land.

3
0:00:22.072,000 --> 0:00:23,000
One evening, this Giant came home

4
0:00:24.077,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and found all these children playing in his garden,

5
0:00:26.543,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and he became enraged.

6
0:00:28.773,000 --> 0:00:31,000
"My own garden is my own garden!"

7
0:00:32.152,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the Giant said.

8
0:00:34.359,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And he built this high wall around it.

9
0:00:37.886,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The author Oscar Wilde wrote the story of "The Selfish Giant" in 1888.

10
0:00:43.947,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Almost a hundred years later, that Giant moved into my Brooklyn childhood

11
0:00:49.084,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and never left.

12
0:00:51.06,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I was raised in a religious family,

13
0:00:53.109,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and I grew up reading both the Bible and the Quran.

14
0:00:56.566,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The hours of reading, both religious and recreational,

15
0:01:00.014,000 --> 0:01:03,000
far outnumbered the hours of television-watching.

16
0:01:03.102,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Now, on any given day, you could find my siblings and I

17
0:01:06.339,000 --> 0:01:09,000
curled up in some part of our apartment reading,

18
0:01:09.484,000 --> 0:01:1,000
sometimes unhappily,

19
0:01:11.046,000 --> 0:01:14,000
because on summer days in New York City, the fire hydrant blasted,

20
0:01:14.826,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and to our immense jealousy, we could hear our friends down there

21
0:01:18.017,000 --> 0:01:19,000
playing in the gushing water,

22
0:01:19.575,000 --> 0:01:22,000
their absolute joy making its way up through our open windows.

23
0:01:23.588,000 --> 0:01:26,000
But I learned that the deeper I went into my books,

24
0:01:26.74,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the more time I took with each sentence,

25
0:01:28.899,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the less I heard the noise of the outside world.

26
0:01:31.96,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And so, unlike my siblings, who were racing through books,

27
0:01:34.976,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I read slowly --

28
0:01:36.589,000 --> 0:01:38,000
very, very slowly.

29
0:01:39.816,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I was that child with her finger running beneath the words,

30
0:01:43.17,000 --> 0:01:47,000
until I was untaught to do this; told big kids don't use their fingers.

31
0:01:48.138,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In third grade, we were made to sit with our hands folded on our desk,

32
0:01:51.903,000 --> 0:01:55,000
unclasping them only to turn the pages, then returning them to that position.

33
0:01:57.061,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Our teacher wasn't being cruel.

34
0:01:59.576,000 --> 0:02:,000
It was the 1970s,

35
0:02:01.282,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and her goal was to get us reading not just on grade level

36
0:02:04.28,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but far above it.

37
0:02:06.199,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And we were always being pushed to read faster.

38
0:02:09.769,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But in the quiet of my apartment, outside of my teacher's gaze,

39
0:02:13.483,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I let my finger run beneath those words.

40
0:02:15.938,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And that Selfish Giant again told me his story,

41
0:02:18.828,000 --> 0:02:21,000
how he had felt betrayed by the kids sneaking into his garden,

42
0:02:22.728,000 --> 0:02:24,000
how he had built this high wall,

43
0:02:24.771,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and it did keep the children out,

44
0:02:27.286,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but a grey winter fell over his garden

45
0:02:29.684,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and just stayed and stayed.

46
0:02:32.784,000 --> 0:02:34,000
With each rereading, I learned something new

47
0:02:35.362,000 --> 0:02:38,000
about the hard stones of the roads that the kids were forced to play on

48
0:02:38.974,000 --> 0:02:4,000
when they got expelled from the garden,

49
0:02:41.108,000 --> 0:02:44,000
about the gentleness of a small boy that appeared one day,

50
0:02:44.52,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and even about the Giant himself.

51
0:02:46.686,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Maybe his words weren't rageful after all.

52
0:02:49.761,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Maybe they were a plea for empathy,

53
0:02:52.056,000 --> 0:02:53,000
for understanding.

54
0:02:54.438,000 --> 0:02:57,000
"My own garden is my own garden."

55
0:02:59.566,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Years later, I would learn of a writer named John Gardner

56
0:03:02.324,000 --> 0:03:04,000
who referred to this as the "fictive dream,"

57
0:03:04.625,000 --> 0:03:05,000
or the "dream of fiction,"

58
0:03:06.369,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and I would realize that this was where I was inside that book,

59
0:03:09.604,000 --> 0:03:12,000
spending time with the characters and the world that the author had created

60
0:03:13.415,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and invited me into.

61
0:03:15.031,000 --> 0:03:18,000
As a child, I knew that stories were meant to be savored,

62
0:03:18.143,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that stories wanted to be slow,

63
0:03:20.747,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and that some author had spent months, maybe years, writing them.

64
0:03:25.592,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And my job as the reader --

65
0:03:26.963,000 --> 0:03:29,000
especially as the reader who wanted to one day become a writer --

66
0:03:30.193,000 --> 0:03:32,000
was to respect that narrative.

67
0:03:33.445,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Long before there was cable or the internet or even the telephone,

68
0:03:39.203,000 --> 0:03:43,000
there were people sharing ideas and information and memory through story.

69
0:03:43.788,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It's one of our earliest forms of connective technology.

70
0:03:47.953,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It was the story of something better down the Nile

71
0:03:50.401,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that sent the Egyptians moving along it,

72
0:03:52.857,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the story of a better way to preserve the dead

73
0:03:55.065,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that brought King Tut's remains into the 21st century.

74
0:03:58.486,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And more than two million years ago,

75
0:04:00.455,000 --> 0:04:03,000
when the first humans began making tools from stone,

76
0:04:04.108,000 --> 0:04:05,000
someone must have said, "What if?"

77
0:04:06.203,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And someone else remembered the story.

78
0:04:09.227,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And whether they told it through words or gestures or drawings,

79
0:04:12.789,000 --> 0:04:14,000
it was passed down; remembered:

80
0:04:15.778,000 --> 0:04:17,000
hit a hammer and hear its story.

81
0:04:19.536,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The world is getting noisier.

82
0:04:21.496,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We've gone from boomboxes

83
0:04:23.521,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to Walkmen to portable CD players

84
0:04:27.863,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to iPods

85
0:04:29.831,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to any song we want, whenever we want it.

86
0:04:32.513,000 --> 0:04:35,000
We've gone from the four television channels of my childhood

87
0:04:35.887,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to the seeming infinity of cable and streaming.

88
0:04:39.44,000 --> 0:04:43,000
As technology moves us faster and faster through time and space,

89
0:04:44.216,000 --> 0:04:47,000
it seems to feel like story is getting pushed out of the way,

90
0:04:47.476,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I mean, literally pushed out of the narrative.

91
0:04:50.64,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But even as our engagement with stories change,

92
0:04:54.28,000 --> 0:04:59,000
or the trappings around it morph from book to audio to Instagram to Snapchat,

93
0:04:59.871,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we must remember our finger beneath the words.

94
0:05:02.44,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Remember that story, regardless of the format,

95
0:05:05.083,000 --> 0:05:08,000
has always taken us to places we never thought we'd go,

96
0:05:08.398,000 --> 0:05:1,000
introduced us to people we never thought we'd meet

97
0:05:11.273,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and shown us worlds that we might have missed.

98
0:05:15.043,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So as technology keeps moving faster and faster,

99
0:05:18.98,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I am good with something slower.

100
0:05:21.562,000 --> 0:05:24,000
My finger beneath the words has led me to a life of writing books

101
0:05:25.24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
for people of all ages,

102
0:05:27.66,000 --> 0:05:28,000
books meant to be read slowly,

103
0:05:29.524,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to be savored.

104
0:05:31.805,000 --> 0:05:34,000
My love for looking deeply and closely at the world,

105
0:05:35.532,000 --> 0:05:38,000
for putting my whole self into it, and by doing so,

106
0:05:38.823,000 --> 0:05:41,000
seeing the many, many possibilities of a narrative,

107
0:05:42.427,000 --> 0:05:43,000
turned out to be a gift,

108
0:05:44.11,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because taking my sweet time

109
0:05:46.227,000 --> 0:05:48,000
taught me everything I needed to know about writing.

110
0:05:49.086,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And writing taught me everything I needed to know about creating worlds

111
0:05:52.762,000 --> 0:05:55,000
where people could be seen and heard,

112
0:05:56.271,000 --> 0:05:59,000
where their experiences could be legitimized,

113
0:05:59.648,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and where my story, read or heard by another person,

114
0:06:03.089,000 --> 0:06:06,000
inspired something in them that became a connection between us,

115
0:06:06.308,000 --> 0:06:07,000
a conversation.

116
0:06:08.352,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And isn't that what this is all about --

117
0:06:11.028,000 --> 0:06:15,000
finding a way, at the end of the day, to not feel alone in this world,

118
0:06:15.749,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and a way to feel like we've changed it before we leave?

119
0:06:20.242,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Stone to hammer, man to mummy,

120
0:06:23.388,000 --> 0:06:26,000
idea to story -- and all of it, remembered.

121
0:06:28.641,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Sometimes we read to understand the future.

122
0:06:32.211,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Sometimes we read to understand the past.

123
0:06:35.156,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We read to get lost, to forget the hard times we're living in,

124
0:06:39.179,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and we read to remember those who came before us,

125
0:06:42.152,000 --> 0:06:43,000
who lived through something harder.

126
0:06:44.643,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I write for those same reasons.

127
0:06:47.893,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Before coming to Brooklyn, my family lived in Greenville, South Carolina,

128
0:06:52.03,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in a segregated neighborhood called Nicholtown.

129
0:06:55.749,000 --> 0:06:57,000
All of us there were the descendants of a people

130
0:06:58.2,000 --> 0:07:,000
who had not been allowed to learn to read or write.

131
0:07:01.651,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Imagine that:

132
0:07:03.105,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the danger of understanding how letters form words,

133
0:07:07.1,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the danger of words themselves,

134
0:07:10.248,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the danger of a literate people and their stories.

135
0:07:15.666,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But against this backdrop of being threatened with death

136
0:07:18.859,000 --> 0:07:2,000
for holding onto a narrative,

137
0:07:21.175,000 --> 0:07:23,000
our stories didn't die,

138
0:07:23.494,000 --> 0:07:26,000
because there is yet another story beneath that one.

139
0:07:26.564,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And this is how it has always worked.

140
0:07:28.699,000 --> 0:07:3,000
For as long as we've been communicating,

141
0:07:30.802,000 --> 0:07:32,000
there's been the layering to the narrative,

142
0:07:32.927,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the stories beneath the stories and the ones beneath those.

143
0:07:36.617,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This is how story has and will continue to survive.

144
0:07:41.263,000 --> 0:07:45,000
As I began to connect the dots that connected the way I learned to write

145
0:07:45.597,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and the way I learned to read

146
0:07:47.35,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to an almost silenced people,

147
0:07:50.336,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I realized that my story was bigger and older and deeper

148
0:07:55.497,000 --> 0:07:56,000
than I would ever be.

149
0:07:57.277,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And because of that, it will continue.

150
0:08:00.722,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Among these almost-silenced people

151
0:08:03.31,000 --> 0:08:05,000
there were the ones who never learned to read.

152
0:08:07.433,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Their descendants, now generations out of enslavement,

153
0:08:11.798,000 --> 0:08:12,000
if well-off enough,

154
0:08:12.99,000 --> 0:08:15,000
had gone on to college, grad school, beyond.

155
0:08:16.758,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Some, like my grandmother and my siblings, seemed to be born reading,

156
0:08:20.487,000 --> 0:08:22,000
as though history stepped out of their way.

157
0:08:23.546,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Some, like my mother, hitched onto the Great Migration wagon --

158
0:08:27.291,000 --> 0:08:29,000
which was not actually a wagon --

159
0:08:29.796,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and kissed the South goodbye.

160
0:08:32.362,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But here is the story within that story:

161
0:08:35.296,000 --> 0:08:37,000
those who left and those who stayed

162
0:08:37.829,000 --> 0:08:39,000
carried with them the history of a narrative,

163
0:08:40.293,000 --> 0:08:44,000
knew deeply that writing it down wasn't the only way they could hold on to it,

164
0:08:44.8,000 --> 0:08:48,000
knew they could sit on their porches or their stoops at the end of a long day

165
0:08:49.052,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and spin a slow tale for their children.

166
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
They knew they could sing their stories through the thick heat of picking cotton

167
0:08:56.548,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and harvesting tobacco,

168
0:08:58.326,000 --> 0:09:01,000
knew they could preach their stories and sew them into quilts,

169
0:09:02.298,000 --> 0:09:05,000
turn the most painful ones into something laughable,

170
0:09:06.152,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and through that laughter, exhale the history a country

171
0:09:08.86,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that tried again and again and again

172
0:09:11.509,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to steal their bodies,

173
0:09:13.057,000 --> 0:09:14,000
their spirit

174
0:09:14.7,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and their story.

175
0:09:17.954,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So as a child, I learned to imagine an invisible finger

176
0:09:21.56,000 --> 0:09:24,000
taking me from word to word,

177
0:09:24.98,000 --> 0:09:26,000
from sentence to sentence,

178
0:09:27.38,000 --> 0:09:29,000
from ignorance to understanding.

179
0:09:30.742,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So as technology continues to speed ahead,

180
0:09:34.346,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I continue to read slowly,

181
0:09:38.054,000 --> 0:09:41,000
knowing that I am respecting the author's work

182
0:09:41.833,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and the story's lasting power.

183
0:09:44.446,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And I read slowly to drown out the noise

184
0:09:47.697,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and remember those who came before me,

185
0:09:51.492,000 --> 0:09:57,000
who were probably the first people who finally learned to control fire

186
0:09:57.722,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and circled their new power

187
0:10:00.926,000 --> 0:10:03,000
of flame and light and heat.

188
0:10:05.853,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And I read slowly to remember the Selfish Giant,

189
0:10:09.57,000 --> 0:10:11,000
how he finally tore that wall down

190
0:10:11.896,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and let the children run free through his garden.

191
0:10:15.325,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And I read slowly to pay homage to my ancestors,

192
0:10:19.401,000 --> 0:10:21,000
who were not allowed to read at all.

193
0:10:22.171,000 --> 0:10:24,000
They, too, must have circled fires,

194
0:10:24.784,000 --> 0:10:27,000
speaking softly of their dreams,

195
0:10:28.178,000 --> 0:10:3,000
their hopes, their futures.

196
0:10:32.417,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Each time we read, write or tell a story,

197
0:10:37.025,000 --> 0:10:39,000
we step inside their circle,

198
0:10:40.339,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and it remains unbroken.

199
0:10:43.515,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And the power of story lives on.

200
0:10:48.047,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Thank you.

201
0:10:49.224,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Applause)

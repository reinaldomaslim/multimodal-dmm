1
0:00:13.868,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I've been trying to figure out what I was going to say here for months.

2
0:00:19.146,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Because there's no bigger stage than TED,

3
0:00:22.399,000 --> 0:00:24,000
it felt like getting my message right in this moment

4
0:00:24.908,000 --> 0:00:26,000
was more important than anything.

5
0:00:28.223,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And so I searched and searched for days on end,

6
0:00:30.884,000 --> 0:00:32,000
trying to find the right configuration of words.

7
0:00:34.927,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And although intellectually,

8
0:00:36.515,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I could bullet point the big ideas that I wanted to share about Me Too

9
0:00:41.842,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and this movement that I founded,

10
0:00:44.578,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I kept finding myself falling short of finding the heart.

11
0:00:50.449,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I wanted to pour myself into this moment

12
0:00:53.309,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and tell you why even the possibility of healing or interrupting sexual violence

13
0:00:59.202,000 --> 0:01:01,000
was worth standing and fighting for.

14
0:01:02.652,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I wanted to rally you to your feet with an uplifting speech

15
0:01:06.319,000 --> 0:01:12,000
about the important work of fighting for the dignity and humanity of survivors.

16
0:01:15.051,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But I don't know if I have it.

17
0:01:18.692,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The reality is,

18
0:01:20.765,000 --> 0:01:23,000
after soldiering through the Supreme Court nomination process

19
0:01:24.676,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and attacks from the White House,

20
0:01:27.179,000 --> 0:01:29,000
gross mischaracterizations,

21
0:01:29.595,000 --> 0:01:31,000
internet trolls

22
0:01:31.899,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and the rallies and marches

23
0:01:35.585,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and heart-wrenching testimonies,

24
0:01:39.23,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I'm faced with my own hard truth.

25
0:01:43.902,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I'm numb.

26
0:01:46.839,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And I'm not surprised.

27
0:01:49.458,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I've traveled all across the world giving talks,

28
0:01:52.601,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and like clockwork, after every event,

29
0:01:56.125,000 --> 0:01:57,000
more than one person approaches me

30
0:01:57.82,000 --> 0:01:59,000
so that they can say their piece in private.

31
0:02:01.355,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I always tried to reassure them.

32
0:02:05.403,000 --> 0:02:08,000
You know, I'd give them local resources

33
0:02:09.774,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and a soft reassurance that they're not alone

34
0:02:13.779,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and this is their movement, too.

35
0:02:17.042,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I'd tell them that we're stronger together

36
0:02:19.516,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and that this is a movement of survivors and advocates

37
0:02:24.062,000 --> 0:02:26,000
doing things big and small every day.

38
0:02:28.708,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And more and more people are joining this movement

39
0:02:31.106,000 --> 0:02:32,000
every single day.

40
0:02:32.35,000 --> 0:02:33,000
That part is clear.

41
0:02:34.765,000 --> 0:02:36,000
People are putting their bodies on the line

42
0:02:37.159,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and raising their voices to say, "Enough is enough."

43
0:02:42.627,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So why do I feel this way?

44
0:02:46.06,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Well ...

45
0:02:48.21,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Someone with credible accusations of sexual violence against him

46
0:02:53.103,000 --> 0:02:56,000
was confirmed to the Supreme Court of the United States of America,

47
0:02:58.153,000 --> 0:02:59,000
again.

48
0:03:00.973,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The US President,

49
0:03:02.367,000 --> 0:03:06,000
who was caught on tape talking about how he can grab women's body parts

50
0:03:06.883,000 --> 0:03:08,000
wherever he wants, however he wants,

51
0:03:09.584,000 --> 0:03:11,000
can call a survivor a liar at one of his rallies,

52
0:03:12.356,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and the crowds will roar.

53
0:03:15.817,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And all across the world, where Me Too has taken off,

54
0:03:18.857,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Australia and France,

55
0:03:20.937,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Sweden, China and now India,

56
0:03:24.325,000 --> 0:03:28,000
survivors of sexual violence are all at once being heard

57
0:03:28.405,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and then vilified.

58
0:03:31.267,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And I've read article after article bemoaning ...

59
0:03:38.45,000 --> 0:03:39,000
wealthy white men

60
0:03:40.134,000 --> 0:03:43,000
who have landed softly with their golden parachutes,

61
0:03:43.453,000 --> 0:03:45,000
following the disclosure of their terrible behavior.

62
0:03:47.745,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And we're asked to consider their futures.

63
0:03:52.096,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But what of survivors?

64
0:03:55.374,000 --> 0:04:,000
This movement is constantly being called a watershed moment,

65
0:04:00.522,000 --> 0:04:01,000
or even a reckoning,

66
0:04:02.934,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but I wake up some days feeling like all evidence points to the contrary.

67
0:04:11.707,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It's hard not to feel numb.

68
0:04:14.825,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I suspect some of you may feel numb, too.

69
0:04:19.158,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But let me tell you what else I know.

70
0:04:21.969,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Sometimes when you hear the word "numb,"

71
0:04:24.323,000 --> 0:04:27,000
you think of a void, an absence of feelings,

72
0:04:28.114,000 --> 0:04:3,000
or even the inability to feel.

73
0:04:32.029,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But that's not always true.

74
0:04:35.534,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Numbness can come from those memories that creep up in your mind

75
0:04:40.305,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that you can't fight off in the middle of the night.

76
0:04:43.863,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They can come from the tears that are locked behind your eyes

77
0:04:46.817,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that you won't give yourself permission to cry.

78
0:04:50.453,000 --> 0:04:55,000
For me, numbness comes from looking in the face of survivors

79
0:04:55.686,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and knowing everything to say

80
0:04:58.395,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but having nothing left to give.

81
0:05:01.694,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's measuring the magnitude of this task ahead of you

82
0:05:06.028,000 --> 0:05:08,000
versus your own wavering fortitude.

83
0:05:09.675,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Numbness is not always the absence of feeling.

84
0:05:13.371,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Sometimes it's an accumulation of feelings.

85
0:05:18.386,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And as survivors,

86
0:05:20.105,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we often have to hold the truth of what we experience.

87
0:05:24.139,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But now, we're all holding something,

88
0:05:26.562,000 --> 0:05:27,000
whether we want to or not.

89
0:05:29.363,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Our colleagues are speaking up and speaking out,

90
0:05:32.859,000 --> 0:05:35,000
industries across the board are reexamining workplace culture,

91
0:05:37.558,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and families and friends are having hard conversations

92
0:05:41.733,000 --> 0:05:42,000
about closely held truths.

93
0:05:45.11,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Everybody is impacted.

94
0:05:48.953,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And then, there's the backlash.

95
0:05:51.037,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We've all heard it.

96
0:05:52.609,000 --> 0:05:53,000
"The Me Too Movement is a witch hunt."

97
0:05:55.197,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Right?

98
0:05:56.371,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"Me Too is dismantling due process."

99
0:05:59.761,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Or, "Me Too has created a gender war."

100
0:06:04.467,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The media has been consistent with headline after headline

101
0:06:10.238,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that frames this movement in ways that make it difficult

102
0:06:12.93,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to move our work forward,

103
0:06:15.199,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and right-wing pundits and other critics

104
0:06:17.897,000 --> 0:06:22,000
have these talking points that shift the focus away from survivors.

105
0:06:23.978,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So suddenly, a movement that was started to support

106
0:06:26.78,000 --> 0:06:28,000
all survivors of sexual violence

107
0:06:29.23,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is being talked about like it's a vindictive plot against men.

108
0:06:33.211,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And I'm like, "Huh?"

109
0:06:34.992,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Laughter)

110
0:06:37.741,000 --> 0:06:38,000
How did we get here?

111
0:06:41.984,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We have moved so far away

112
0:06:44.328,000 --> 0:06:48,000
from the origins of this movement that started a decade ago,

113
0:06:48.442,000 --> 0:06:52,000
or even the intentions of the hashtag that started just a year ago,

114
0:06:52.832,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that sometimes, the Me Too movement that I hear some people talk about

115
0:06:56.947,000 --> 0:06:57,000
is unrecognizable to me.

116
0:07:00.777,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But be clear:

117
0:07:03.111,000 --> 0:07:06,000
This is a movement about the one in four girls

118
0:07:06.837,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and the one in six boys

119
0:07:08.842,000 --> 0:07:1,000
who are sexually assaulted every year

120
0:07:11.187,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and carry those wounds into adulthood.

121
0:07:14.403,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's about the 84 percent of trans women who will be sexually assaulted this year

122
0:07:20.082,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and the indigenous women

123
0:07:21.599,000 --> 0:07:24,000
who are three-and-a-half times more likely to be sexually assaulted

124
0:07:25.265,000 --> 0:07:26,000
than any other group.

125
0:07:27.601,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Or people with disabilities,

126
0:07:29.395,000 --> 0:07:32,000
who are seven times more likely to be sexually abused.

127
0:07:34.825,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It's about the 60 percent of black girls like me

128
0:07:38.904,000 --> 0:07:42,000
who will be experiencing sexual violence before they turn 18,

129
0:07:44.618,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and the thousands and thousands of low-wage workers

130
0:07:48.552,000 --> 0:07:5,000
who are being sexually harassed right now

131
0:07:50.775,000 --> 0:07:52,000
on jobs that they can't afford to quit.

132
0:07:55.422,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This is a movement about the far-reaching power of empathy.

133
0:08:01.045,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And so it's about the millions and millions of people

134
0:08:05.213,000 --> 0:08:08,000
who, one year ago, raised their hands to say, "Me too,"

135
0:08:09.211,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and their hands are still raised

136
0:08:12.41,000 --> 0:08:14,000
while the media that they consume erases them

137
0:08:15.835,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and politicians who they elected to represent them

138
0:08:19.708,000 --> 0:08:21,000
pivot away from solutions.

139
0:08:23.009,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It's understandable that the push-pull of this unique, historical moment

140
0:08:28.083,000 --> 0:08:31,000
feels like an emotional roller-coaster that has rendered many of us numb.

141
0:08:33.989,000 --> 0:08:35,000
This accumulation of feelings

142
0:08:37.509,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that so many of us are experiencing together, across the globe,

143
0:08:43.318,000 --> 0:08:44,000
is collective trauma.

144
0:08:46.759,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But ...

145
0:08:48.807,000 --> 0:08:51,000
it is also the first step

146
0:08:52.481,000 --> 0:08:55,000
towards actively building a world that we want right now.

147
0:08:57.758,000 --> 0:09:,000
What we do with this thing that we're all holding

148
0:09:01.251,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is the evidence that this is bigger than a moment.

149
0:09:04.211,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's the confirmation that we are in a movement.

150
0:09:09.123,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And the most powerful movements

151
0:09:11.571,000 --> 0:09:14,000
have always been built around what's possible,

152
0:09:15.968,000 --> 0:09:18,000
not just claiming what is right now.

153
0:09:21.676,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Trauma halts possibility.

154
0:09:26.152,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Movement activates it.

155
0:09:29.347,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Dr. King famously quoted Theodore Parker saying,

156
0:09:32.677,000 --> 0:09:36,000
"The arc of the moral universe is long, and it bends toward justice."

157
0:09:36.892,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We've all heard this quote.

158
0:09:39.502,000 --> 0:09:4,000
But somebody has to bend it.

159
0:09:42.997,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The possibility that we create in this movement and others

160
0:09:46.985,000 --> 0:09:49,000
is the weight leaning that arc in the right direction.

161
0:09:50.735,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Movements create possibility,

162
0:09:53.896,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and they are built on vision.

163
0:09:57.138,000 --> 0:09:59,000
My vision for the Me Too Movement

164
0:09:59.417,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is a part of a collective vision to see a world free of sexual violence,

165
0:10:05.013,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and I believe we can build that world.

166
0:10:07.403,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Full stop.

167
0:10:10.117,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But in order to get there,

168
0:10:12.335,000 --> 0:10:17,000
we have to dramatically shift a culture that propagates the idea

169
0:10:17.881,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that vulnerability is synonymous with permission

170
0:10:21.991,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and that bodily autonomy is not a basic human right.

171
0:10:27.017,000 --> 0:10:31,000
In other words, we have to dismantle the building blocks of sexual violence:

172
0:10:33.151,000 --> 0:10:35,000
power and privilege.

173
0:10:37.52,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So much of what we hear about the Me Too Movement

174
0:10:40.399,000 --> 0:10:45,000
is about individual bad actors or depraved, isolated behavior,

175
0:10:46.705,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and it fails to recognize

176
0:10:49.086,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that anybody in a position of power comes with privilege,

177
0:10:53.064,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and it renders those without that power

178
0:10:55.541,000 --> 0:10:56,000
more vulnerable.

179
0:10:57.952,000 --> 0:11:,000
Teachers and students, coaches and athletes,

180
0:11:01.38,000 --> 0:11:04,000
law enforcement and citizen, parent and child:

181
0:11:05.943,000 --> 0:11:09,000
these are all relationships that can have an incredible imbalance of power.

182
0:11:12.475,000 --> 0:11:18,000
But we reshape that imbalance by speaking out against it in unison

183
0:11:18.523,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and by creating spaces to speak truth to power.

184
0:11:22.917,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We have to reeducate ourselves and our children

185
0:11:26.537,000 --> 0:11:32,000
to understand that power and privilege doesn't always have to destroy and take --

186
0:11:33.286,000 --> 0:11:35,000
it can be used to serve and build.

187
0:11:37.019,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And we have to reeducate ourselves to understand that, unequivocally,

188
0:11:43.062,000 --> 0:11:46,000
every human being has the right to walk through this life

189
0:11:46.658,000 --> 0:11:48,000
with their full humanity intact.

190
0:11:51.554,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Part of the work of the Me Too Movement

191
0:11:54.279,000 --> 0:11:57,000
is about the restoration of that humanity for survivors,

192
0:11:59.059,000 --> 0:12:01,000
because the violence doesn't end with the act.

193
0:12:02.633,000 --> 0:12:05,000
The violence is also the trauma that we hold after the act.

194
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Remember, trauma halts possibility.

195
0:12:11.437,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It serves to impede,

196
0:12:16.011,000 --> 0:12:19,000
stagnate, confuse and kill.

197
0:12:21.498,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So our work rethinks how we deal with trauma.

198
0:12:26.241,000 --> 0:12:28,000
For instance, we don't believe

199
0:12:28.456,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that survivors should tell the details of their stories all the time.

200
0:12:35.063,000 --> 0:12:38,000
We shouldn't have to perform our pain over and over again

201
0:12:38.484,000 --> 0:12:39,000
for the sake of your awareness.

202
0:12:42.006,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We also try to teach survivors to not lean into their trauma,

203
0:12:47.378,000 --> 0:12:5,000
but to lean into the joy that they curate in their lives instead.

204
0:12:52.302,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And if you don't find it, create it and lean into that.

205
0:12:57.286,000 --> 0:13:,000
But when your life has been touched by trauma,

206
0:13:00.444,000 --> 0:13:04,000
sometimes trying to find joy feels like an insurmountable task.

207
0:13:06.598,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Now imagine trying to complete that task

208
0:13:08.964,000 --> 0:13:11,000
while world leaders are discrediting your memories

209
0:13:12.627,000 --> 0:13:15,000
or the news media keeps erasing your experience,

210
0:13:15.881,000 --> 0:13:17,000
or people continuously reduce you to your pain.

211
0:13:21.201,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Movement activates possibility.

212
0:13:27.299,000 --> 0:13:3,000
There's folklore in my family, like most black folks,

213
0:13:31.314,000 --> 0:13:33,000
about my great-great-grandaddy, Lawrence Ware.

214
0:13:35.76,000 --> 0:13:36,000
He was born enslaved,

215
0:13:38.186,000 --> 0:13:4,000
his parents were enslaved,

216
0:13:40.227,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and he had no reason to believe that a black man in America

217
0:13:43.474,000 --> 0:13:44,000
wouldn't die a slave.

218
0:13:46.434,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And yet,

219
0:13:48.404,000 --> 0:13:51,000
legend has it that when he was freed by his enslavers,

220
0:13:51.872,000 --> 0:13:56,000
he walked from Georgia to South Carolina

221
0:13:56.912,000 --> 0:13:59,000
so that he could find the wife and child that he was separated from.

222
0:14:01.114,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And every time I hear this story, I think to myself,

223
0:14:04.279,000 --> 0:14:05,000
"How could he do this?

224
0:14:05.904,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Wasn't he afraid that he would be captured and killed by white vigilantes,

225
0:14:09.945,000 --> 0:14:11,000
or he would get there and they would be gone?"

226
0:14:13.106,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And so I asked my grandmother once

227
0:14:15.171,000 --> 0:14:18,000
why she thought that he took this journey up,

228
0:14:18.377,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and she said,

229
0:14:20.491,000 --> 0:14:22,000
"I guess he had to believe it was possible."

230
0:14:24.518,000 --> 0:14:27,000
I have been propelled by possibility for most of my life.

231
0:14:29.542,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I am here because somebody, starting with my ancestors,

232
0:14:33.745,000 --> 0:14:34,000
believed I was possible.

233
0:14:38.193,000 --> 0:14:4,000
In 2006, 12 years ago,

234
0:14:41.789,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I laid across a mattress on my floor in my one-bedroom apartment,

235
0:14:47.109,000 --> 0:14:51,000
frustrated with all the sexual violence that I saw in my community.

236
0:14:51.35,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I pulled out a piece of paper, and I wrote "Me Too" on the top of it,

237
0:14:56.224,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and I proceeded to write out an action plan

238
0:14:58.891,000 --> 0:15:02,000
for building a movement based on empathy between survivors

239
0:15:03.487,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that would help us feel like we can heal,

240
0:15:06.369,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that we weren't the sum total of the things that happened to us.

241
0:15:11.7,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Possibility is a gift, y'all.

242
0:15:14.443,000 --> 0:15:16,000
It births new worlds,

243
0:15:16.616,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and it births visions.

244
0:15:20.419,000 --> 0:15:21,000
I know some of y'all are tired,

245
0:15:23.107,000 --> 0:15:24,000
because I'm tired.

246
0:15:25.34,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I'm exhausted,

247
0:15:27.92,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and I'm numb.

248
0:15:30.542,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Those who came before us didn't win every fight,

249
0:15:34.255,000 --> 0:15:36,000
but they didn't let it kill their vision.

250
0:15:37.087,000 --> 0:15:38,000
It fueled it.

251
0:15:39.578,000 --> 0:15:4,000
So I can't stop,

252
0:15:41.942,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and I'm asking you not to stop either.

253
0:15:45.795,000 --> 0:15:5,000
We owe future generations a world free of sexual violence.

254
0:15:52.121,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I believe we can build that world.

255
0:15:55.202,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Do you?

256
0:15:57.684,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Thank you.

257
0:15:58.859,000 --> 0:16:05,000
(Applause)

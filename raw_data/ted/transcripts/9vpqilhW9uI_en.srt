1
0:00:12.791,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We are going to take a quick voyage

2
0:00:15.19,000 --> 0:00:18,000
over the cognitive history of the 20th century,

3
0:00:18.697,000 --> 0:00:19,000
because during that century,

4
0:00:20.486,000 --> 0:00:22,000
our minds have altered dramatically.

5
0:00:23.4,000 --> 0:00:26,000
As you all know, the cars that people drove in 1900

6
0:00:26.724,000 --> 0:00:28,000
have altered because the roads are better

7
0:00:28.798,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and because of technology.

8
0:00:31.153,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And our minds have altered, too.

9
0:00:33.122,000 --> 0:00:36,000
We've gone from people who confronted a concrete world

10
0:00:37.066,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and analyzed that world primarily in terms

11
0:00:40.465,000 --> 0:00:42,000
of how much it would benefit them

12
0:00:42.698,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to people who confront a very complex world,

13
0:00:47.29,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and it's a world where we've had to develop

14
0:00:49.499,000 --> 0:00:52,000
new mental habits, new habits of mind.

15
0:00:52.994,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And these include things like

16
0:00:54.991,000 --> 0:00:58,000
clothing that concrete world with classification,

17
0:00:59.005,000 --> 0:01:01,000
introducing abstractions that we try to make

18
0:01:01.927,000 --> 0:01:03,000
logically consistent,

19
0:01:04.123,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and also taking the hypothetical seriously,

20
0:01:06.953,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that is, wondering about what might have been

21
0:01:09.203,000 --> 0:01:11,000
rather than what is.

22
0:01:11.595,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now, this dramatic change was drawn to my attention

23
0:01:15.147,000 --> 0:01:18,000
through massive I.Q. gains over time,

24
0:01:18.907,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and these have been truly massive.

25
0:01:21.276,000 --> 0:01:25,000
That is, we don't just get a few more questions right

26
0:01:25.687,000 --> 0:01:26,000
on I.Q. tests.

27
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We get far more questions right on I.Q. tests

28
0:01:30.619,000 --> 0:01:32,000
than each succeeding generation

29
0:01:32.867,000 --> 0:01:34,000
back to the time that they were invented.

30
0:01:35.777,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Indeed, if you score the people a century ago

31
0:01:39.075,000 --> 0:01:4,000
against modern norms,

32
0:01:40.623,000 --> 0:01:43,000
they would have an average I.Q. of 70.

33
0:01:43.994,000 --> 0:01:45,000
If you score us against their norms,

34
0:01:46.719,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we would have an average I.Q. of 130.

35
0:01:50.318,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now this has raised all sorts of questions.

36
0:01:53.675,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Were our immediate ancestors

37
0:01:55.58,000 --> 0:01:58,000
on the verge of mental retardation?

38
0:01:58.815,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Because 70 is normally the score for mental retardation.

39
0:02:02.89,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Or are we on the verge of all being gifted?

40
0:02:05.922,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Because 130 is the cutting line for giftedness.

41
0:02:10.158,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now I'm going to try and argue for a third alternative

42
0:02:13.278,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that's much more illuminating than either of those,

43
0:02:17.331,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and to put this into perspective,

44
0:02:19.953,000 --> 0:02:21,000
let's imagine that a Martian came down to Earth

45
0:02:22.858,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and found a ruined civilization.

46
0:02:25.693,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And this Martian was an archaeologist,

47
0:02:28.1,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and they found scores, target scores,

48
0:02:30.987,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that people had used for shooting.

49
0:02:33.91,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And first they looked at 1865,

50
0:02:36.413,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and they found that in a minute,

51
0:02:38.484,000 --> 0:02:41,000
people had only put one bullet in the bullseye.

52
0:02:42.193,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And then they found, in 1898,

53
0:02:44.51,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that they'd put about five bullets in the bullseye in a minute.

54
0:02:48.294,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And then about 1918 they put a hundred bullets in the bullseye.

55
0:02:53.521,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And initially, that archaeologist would be baffled.

56
0:02:57.376,000 --> 0:02:59,000
They would say, look, these tests were designed

57
0:02:59.973,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to find out how much people were steady of hand,

58
0:03:03.571,000 --> 0:03:05,000
how keen their eyesight was,

59
0:03:06.346,000 --> 0:03:08,000
whether they had control of their weapon.

60
0:03:08.684,000 --> 0:03:11,000
How could these performances have escalated

61
0:03:11.705,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to this enormous degree?

62
0:03:13.887,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Well we now know, of course, the answer.

63
0:03:16.162,000 --> 0:03:18,000
If that Martian looked at battlefields,

64
0:03:18.974,000 --> 0:03:2,000
they would find that people had only muskets

65
0:03:21.798,000 --> 0:03:23,000
at the time of the Civil War

66
0:03:23.862,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and that they had repeating rifles

67
0:03:25.669,000 --> 0:03:28,000
at the time of the Spanish-American War,

68
0:03:28.854,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and then they had machine guns

69
0:03:30.59,000 --> 0:03:32,000
by the time of World War I.

70
0:03:33.405,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And, in other words, it was the equipment

71
0:03:35.956,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that was in the hands of the average soldier

72
0:03:38.123,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that was responsible, not greater keenness of eye

73
0:03:41.186,000 --> 0:03:43,000
or steadiness of hand.

74
0:03:43.359,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Now what we have to imagine is the mental artillery

75
0:03:46.679,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that we have picked up over those hundred years,

76
0:03:50.172,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and I think again that another thinker will help us here,

77
0:03:54.235,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and that's Luria.

78
0:03:56.37,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Luria looked at people

79
0:03:58.514,000 --> 0:04:01,000
just before they entered the scientific age,

80
0:04:02.167,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and he found that these people

81
0:04:04.164,000 --> 0:04:07,000
were resistant to classifying the concrete world.

82
0:04:07.821,000 --> 0:04:08,000
They wanted to break it up

83
0:04:08.875,000 --> 0:04:1,000
into little bits that they could use.

84
0:04:11.465,000 --> 0:04:13,000
He found that they were resistant

85
0:04:13.755,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to deducing the hypothetical,

86
0:04:17.256,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to speculating about what might be,

87
0:04:19.933,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and he found finally that they didn't deal well

88
0:04:22.57,000 --> 0:04:26,000
with abstractions or using logic on those abstractions.

89
0:04:26.967,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Now let me give you a sample of some of his interviews.

90
0:04:30.107,000 --> 0:04:32,000
He talked to the head man of a person

91
0:04:32.473,000 --> 0:04:33,000
in rural Russia.

92
0:04:34.305,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They'd only had, as people had in 1900,

93
0:04:36.779,000 --> 0:04:38,000
about four years of schooling.

94
0:04:38.96,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And he asked that particular person,

95
0:04:41.32,000 --> 0:04:44,000
what do crows and fish have in common?

96
0:04:44.79,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And the fellow said, "Absolutely nothing.

97
0:04:47.857,000 --> 0:04:49,000
You know, I can eat a fish. I can't eat a crow.

98
0:04:50.85,000 --> 0:04:52,000
A crow can peck at a fish.

99
0:04:53.176,000 --> 0:04:55,000
A fish can't do anything to a crow."

100
0:04:56.027,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And Luria said, "But aren't they both animals?"

101
0:04:59.253,000 --> 0:05:,000
And he said, "Of course not.

102
0:05:00.663,000 --> 0:05:01,000
One's a fish.

103
0:05:02.65,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The other is a bird."

104
0:05:04.422,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And he was interested, effectively,

105
0:05:06.444,000 --> 0:05:09,000
in what he could do with those concrete objects.

106
0:05:10.112,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And then Luria went to another person,

107
0:05:12.99,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and he said to them,

108
0:05:15.173,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"There are no camels in Germany.

109
0:05:17.869,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Hamburg is a city in Germany.

110
0:05:20.28,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Are there camels in Hamburg?"

111
0:05:22.823,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And the fellow said,

112
0:05:23.714,000 --> 0:05:27,000
"Well, if it's large enough, there ought to be camels there."

113
0:05:27.933,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And Luria said, "But what do my words imply?"

114
0:05:31.827,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And he said, "Well, maybe it's a small village,

115
0:05:34.104,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and there's no room for camels."

116
0:05:36.673,000 --> 0:05:38,000
In other words, he was unwilling to treat this

117
0:05:38.936,000 --> 0:05:4,000
as anything but a concrete problem,

118
0:05:41.733,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and he was used to camels being in villages,

119
0:05:44.291,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and he was quite unable to use the hypothetical,

120
0:05:48.224,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to ask himself what if there were no camels in Germany.

121
0:05:53.131,000 --> 0:05:55,000
A third interview was conducted

122
0:05:55.944,000 --> 0:05:57,000
with someone about the North Pole.

123
0:05:58.928,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And Luria said, "At the North Pole, there is always snow.

124
0:06:03.033,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Wherever there is always snow, the bears are white.

125
0:06:06.988,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What color are the bears at the North Pole?"

126
0:06:10.267,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And the response was, "Such a thing

127
0:06:12.669,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is to be settled by testimony.

128
0:06:14.979,000 --> 0:06:16,000
If a wise person came from the North Pole

129
0:06:17.803,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and told me the bears were white,

130
0:06:19.654,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I might believe him,

131
0:06:21.133,000 --> 0:06:25,000
but every bear that I have seen is a brown bear."

132
0:06:25.338,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now you see again, this person has rejected

133
0:06:28.322,000 --> 0:06:3,000
going beyond the concrete world

134
0:06:30.517,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and analyzing it through everyday experience,

135
0:06:33.69,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and it was important to that person

136
0:06:35.556,000 --> 0:06:36,000
what color bears were --

137
0:06:37.118,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that is, they had to hunt bears.

138
0:06:39.399,000 --> 0:06:41,000
They weren't willing to engage in this.

139
0:06:41.808,000 --> 0:06:42,000
One of them said to Luria,

140
0:06:43.645,000 --> 0:06:46,000
"How can we solve things that aren't real problems?

141
0:06:47.145,000 --> 0:06:48,000
None of these problems are real.

142
0:06:49.036,000 --> 0:06:51,000
How can we address them?"

143
0:06:51.679,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now, these three categories --

144
0:06:55.224,000 --> 0:06:56,000
classification,

145
0:06:56.715,000 --> 0:06:58,000
using logic on abstractions,

146
0:06:58.856,000 --> 0:07:,000
taking the hypothetical seriously --

147
0:07:01.625,000 --> 0:07:03,000
how much difference do they make in the real world

148
0:07:04.063,000 --> 0:07:05,000
beyond the testing room?

149
0:07:05.956,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And let me give you a few illustrations.

150
0:07:08.926,000 --> 0:07:11,000
First, almost all of us today get a high school diploma.

151
0:07:12.315,000 --> 0:07:15,000
That is, we've gone from four to eight years of education

152
0:07:15.712,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to 12 years of formal education,

153
0:07:18.489,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and 52 percent of Americans

154
0:07:20.39,000 --> 0:07:23,000
have actually experienced some type of tertiary education.

155
0:07:24.21,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Now, not only do we have much more education,

156
0:07:28.242,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and much of that education is scientific,

157
0:07:30.935,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and you can't do science without classifying the world.

158
0:07:34.945,000 --> 0:07:37,000
You can't do science without proposing hypotheses.

159
0:07:38.804,000 --> 0:07:42,000
You can't do science without making it logically consistent.

160
0:07:42.978,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And even down in grade school, things have changed.

161
0:07:46.788,000 --> 0:07:48,000
In 1910, they looked at the examinations

162
0:07:49.722,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that the state of Ohio gave to 14-year-olds,

163
0:07:53.542,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and they found that they were all

164
0:07:55.148,000 --> 0:07:58,000
for socially valued concrete information.

165
0:07:58.583,000 --> 0:07:59,000
They were things like,

166
0:07:59.914,000 --> 0:08:01,000
what are the capitals of the 44 or 45 states

167
0:08:02.801,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that existed at that time?

168
0:08:05.175,000 --> 0:08:06,000
When they looked at the exams

169
0:08:06.753,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that the state of Ohio gave in 1990,

170
0:08:09.9,000 --> 0:08:11,000
they were all about abstractions.

171
0:08:12.286,000 --> 0:08:13,000
They were things like,

172
0:08:13.879,000 --> 0:08:18,000
why is the largest city of a state rarely the capital?

173
0:08:19.013,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And you were supposed to think, well,

174
0:08:20.577,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the state legislature was rural-controlled,

175
0:08:23.791,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and they hated the big city,

176
0:08:25.889,000 --> 0:08:27,000
so rather than putting the capital in a big city,

177
0:08:28.482,000 --> 0:08:29,000
they put it in a county seat.

178
0:08:29.92,000 --> 0:08:31,000
They put it in Albany rather than New York.

179
0:08:32.656,000 --> 0:08:35,000
They put it in Harrisburg rather than Philadelphia.

180
0:08:35.712,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And so forth.

181
0:08:37.647,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So the tenor of education has changed.

182
0:08:40.078,000 --> 0:08:44,000
We are educating people to take the hypothetical seriously,

183
0:08:44.112,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to use abstractions, and to link them logically.

184
0:08:47.69,000 --> 0:08:49,000
What about employment?

185
0:08:50.071,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Well, in 1900, three percent of Americans

186
0:08:53.971,000 --> 0:08:56,000
practiced professions that were cognitively demanding.

187
0:08:57.513,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Only three percent were lawyers or doctors or teachers.

188
0:09:01.568,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Today, 35 percent of Americans

189
0:09:04.431,000 --> 0:09:07,000
practice cognitively demanding professions,

190
0:09:07.75,000 --> 0:09:09,000
not only to the professions proper like lawyer

191
0:09:10.376,000 --> 0:09:12,000
or doctor or scientist or lecturer,

192
0:09:12.925,000 --> 0:09:13,000
but many, many sub-professions

193
0:09:14.743,000 --> 0:09:15,000
having to do with being a technician,

194
0:09:16.684,000 --> 0:09:18,000
a computer programmer.

195
0:09:18.709,000 --> 0:09:22,000
A whole range of professions now make cognitive demands.

196
0:09:23.033,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And we can only meet the terms of employment

197
0:09:25.963,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in the modern world by being cognitively

198
0:09:28.46,000 --> 0:09:3,000
far more flexible.

199
0:09:30.721,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And it's not just that we have many more people

200
0:09:33.944,000 --> 0:09:35,000
in cognitively demanding professions.

201
0:09:36.934,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The professions have been upgraded.

202
0:09:39.337,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Compare the doctor in 1900,

203
0:09:41.448,000 --> 0:09:44,000
who really had only a few tricks up his sleeve,

204
0:09:44.497,000 --> 0:09:46,000
with the modern general practitioner or specialist,

205
0:09:47.305,000 --> 0:09:49,000
with years of scientific training.

206
0:09:49.984,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Compare the banker in 1900,

207
0:09:52.253,000 --> 0:09:54,000
who really just needed a good accountant

208
0:09:54.666,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and to know who was trustworthy in the local community

209
0:09:57.842,000 --> 0:09:59,000
for paying back their mortgage.

210
0:10:00.133,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Well, the merchant bankers who brought the world to their knees

211
0:10:03.362,000 --> 0:10:04,000
may have been morally remiss,

212
0:10:05.128,000 --> 0:10:08,000
but they were cognitively very agile.

213
0:10:08.267,000 --> 0:10:12,000
They went far beyond that 1900 banker.

214
0:10:12.878,000 --> 0:10:14,000
They had to look at computer projections

215
0:10:15.045,000 --> 0:10:17,000
for the housing market.

216
0:10:17.045,000 --> 0:10:2,000
They had to get complicated CDO-squared

217
0:10:20.95,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in order to bundle debt together

218
0:10:23.4,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and make debt look as if it were actually a profitable asset.

219
0:10:27.159,000 --> 0:10:3,000
They had to prepare a case to get rating agencies

220
0:10:30.259,000 --> 0:10:31,000
to give it a AAA,

221
0:10:31.37,000 --> 0:10:35,000
though in many cases, they had virtually bribed the rating agencies.

222
0:10:35.604,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And they also, of course, had to get people

223
0:10:37.633,000 --> 0:10:39,000
to accept these so-called assets

224
0:10:40.32,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and pay money for them

225
0:10:41.82,000 --> 0:10:43,000
even though they were highly vulnerable.

226
0:10:44.407,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Or take a farmer today.

227
0:10:45.997,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I take the farm manager of today as very different

228
0:10:49.277,000 --> 0:10:51,000
from the farmer of 1900.

229
0:10:51.768,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So it hasn't just been the spread

230
0:10:53.606,000 --> 0:10:56,000
of cognitively demanding professions.

231
0:10:56.797,000 --> 0:10:58,000
It's also been the upgrading of tasks

232
0:10:59.177,000 --> 0:11:01,000
like lawyer and doctor and what have you

233
0:11:01.744,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that have made demands on our cognitive faculties.

234
0:11:05.521,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But I've talked about education and employment.

235
0:11:08.68,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Some of the habits of mind that we have developed

236
0:11:12.019,000 --> 0:11:13,000
over the 20th century

237
0:11:13.626,000 --> 0:11:15,000
have paid off in unexpected areas.

238
0:11:16.221,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I'm primarily a moral philosopher.

239
0:11:18.492,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I merely have a holiday in psychology,

240
0:11:22.18,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and what interests me in general is moral debate.

241
0:11:26.588,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Now over the last century,

242
0:11:29.319,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in developed nations like America,

243
0:11:31.669,000 --> 0:11:32,000
moral debate has escalated

244
0:11:33.65,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because we take the hypothetical seriously,

245
0:11:36.989,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and we also take universals seriously

246
0:11:40.204,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and look for logical connections.

247
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:46,000
When I came home in 1955 from university

248
0:11:46.735,000 --> 0:11:48,000
at the time of Martin Luther King,

249
0:11:49.042,000 --> 0:11:51,000
a lot of people came home at that time

250
0:11:51.364,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and started having arguments with their parents and grandparents.

251
0:11:55.114,000 --> 0:11:58,000
My father was born in 1885,

252
0:11:58.342,000 --> 0:12:,000
and he was mildly racially biased.

253
0:12:00.905,000 --> 0:12:02,000
As an Irishman, he hated the English so much

254
0:12:03.008,000 --> 0:12:05,000
he didn't have much emotion for anyone else.

255
0:12:05.329,000 --> 0:12:08,000
(Laughter)

256
0:12:08.6,000 --> 0:12:12,000
But he did have a sense that black people were inferior.

257
0:12:13.108,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And when we said to our parents and grandparents,

258
0:12:15.956,000 --> 0:12:19,000
"How would you feel if tomorrow morning you woke up black?"

259
0:12:20.449,000 --> 0:12:23,000
they said that is the dumbest thing you've ever said.

260
0:12:24.07,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Who have you ever known who woke up in the morning --

261
0:12:26.572,000 --> 0:12:28,000
(Laughter) --

262
0:12:28.974,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that turned black?

263
0:12:30.204,000 --> 0:12:33,000
In other words, they were fixed in the concrete

264
0:12:33.72,000 --> 0:12:36,000
mores and attitudes they had inherited.

265
0:12:37.233,000 --> 0:12:4,000
They would not take the hypothetical seriously,

266
0:12:40.244,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and without the hypothetical,

267
0:12:41.728,000 --> 0:12:45,000
it's very difficult to get moral argument off the ground.

268
0:12:45.747,000 --> 0:12:47,000
You have to say, imagine you were

269
0:12:48.382,000 --> 0:12:53,000
in Iran, and imagine that your relatives

270
0:12:53.967,000 --> 0:12:55,000
all suffered from collateral damage

271
0:12:56.667,000 --> 0:12:57,000
even though they had done no wrong.

272
0:12:58.613,000 --> 0:13:,000
How would you feel about that?

273
0:13:00.674,000 --> 0:13:02,000
And if someone of the older generation says,

274
0:13:03.394,000 --> 0:13:04,000
well, our government takes care of us,

275
0:13:05.324,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and it's up to their government to take care of them,

276
0:13:08.267,000 --> 0:13:12,000
they're just not willing to take the hypothetical seriously.

277
0:13:12.335,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Or take an Islamic father whose daughter has been raped,

278
0:13:15.702,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and he feels he's honor-bound to kill her.

279
0:13:18.912,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Well, he's treating his mores

280
0:13:21.272,000 --> 0:13:24,000
as if they were sticks and stones and rocks that he had inherited,

281
0:13:25.172,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and they're unmovable in any way by logic.

282
0:13:27.817,000 --> 0:13:29,000
They're just inherited mores.

283
0:13:30.393,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Today we would say something like,

284
0:13:32.594,000 --> 0:13:35,000
well, imagine you were knocked unconscious and sodomized.

285
0:13:36.171,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Would you deserve to be killed?

286
0:13:37.844,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And he would say, well that's not in the Koran.

287
0:13:40.739,000 --> 0:13:44,000
That's not one of the principles I've got.

288
0:13:44.761,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Well you, today, universalize your principles.

289
0:13:47.602,000 --> 0:13:5,000
You state them as abstractions and you use logic on them.

290
0:13:51.159,000 --> 0:13:53,000
If you have a principle such as,

291
0:13:53.432,000 --> 0:13:56,000
people shouldn't suffer unless they're guilty of something,

292
0:13:57.078,000 --> 0:13:59,000
then to exclude black people

293
0:13:59.174,000 --> 0:14:01,000
you've got to make exceptions, don't you?

294
0:14:01.672,000 --> 0:14:03,000
You have to say, well, blackness of skin,

295
0:14:04.66,000 --> 0:14:06,000
you couldn't suffer just for that.

296
0:14:07.283,000 --> 0:14:1,000
It must be that blacks are somehow tainted.

297
0:14:10.546,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And then we can bring empirical evidence to bear, can't we,

298
0:14:13.713,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and say, well how can you consider all blacks tainted

299
0:14:16.629,000 --> 0:14:19,000
when St. Augustine was black and Thomas Sowell is black.

300
0:14:20.423,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And you can get moral argument off the ground, then,

301
0:14:23.848,000 --> 0:14:27,000
because you're not treating moral principles as concrete entities.

302
0:14:28.402,000 --> 0:14:29,000
You're treating them as universals,

303
0:14:30.339,000 --> 0:14:32,000
to be rendered consistent by logic.

304
0:14:33.118,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Now how did all of this arise out of I.Q. tests?

305
0:14:36.248,000 --> 0:14:4,000
That's what initially got me going on cognitive history.

306
0:14:40.258,000 --> 0:14:41,000
If you look at the I.Q. test,

307
0:14:42.143,000 --> 0:14:45,000
you find the gains have been greatest in certain areas.

308
0:14:46.128,000 --> 0:14:48,000
The similarities subtest of the Wechsler

309
0:14:48.731,000 --> 0:14:5,000
is about classification,

310
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and we have made enormous gains

311
0:14:53.08,000 --> 0:14:56,000
on that classification subtest.

312
0:14:56.19,000 --> 0:14:59,000
There are other parts of the I.Q. test battery

313
0:14:59.471,000 --> 0:15:02,000
that are about using logic on abstractions.

314
0:15:02.567,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Some of you may have taken Raven's Progressive Matrices,

315
0:15:06.041,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and it's all about analogies.

316
0:15:08.579,000 --> 0:15:11,000
And in 1900, people could do simple analogies.

317
0:15:12.435,000 --> 0:15:16,000
That is, if you said to them, cats are like wildcats.

318
0:15:16.78,000 --> 0:15:17,000
What are dogs like?

319
0:15:18.356,000 --> 0:15:2,000
They would say wolves.

320
0:15:20.448,000 --> 0:15:23,000
But by 1960, people could attack Raven's

321
0:15:23.992,000 --> 0:15:25,000
on a much more sophisticated level.

322
0:15:26.642,000 --> 0:15:3,000
If you said, we've got two squares followed by a triangle,

323
0:15:31.149,000 --> 0:15:33,000
what follows two circles?

324
0:15:33.385,000 --> 0:15:35,000
They could say a semicircle.

325
0:15:35.672,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Just as a triangle is half of a square,

326
0:15:37.85,000 --> 0:15:39,000
a semicircle is half of a circle.

327
0:15:40.568,000 --> 0:15:43,000
By 2010, college graduates, if you said

328
0:15:44.161,000 --> 0:15:47,000
two circles followed by a semicircle,

329
0:15:47.396,000 --> 0:15:49,000
two sixteens followed by what,

330
0:15:50.186,000 --> 0:15:53,000
they would say eight, because eight is half of 16.

331
0:15:53.922,000 --> 0:15:55,000
That is, they had moved so far from the concrete world

332
0:15:56.788,000 --> 0:15:58,000
that they could even ignore

333
0:15:59.081,000 --> 0:16:03,000
the appearance of the symbols that were involved in the question.

334
0:16:03.604,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Now, I should say one thing that's very disheartening.

335
0:16:06.768,000 --> 0:16:08,000
We haven't made progress on all fronts.

336
0:16:09.64,000 --> 0:16:11,000
One of the ways in which we would like to deal

337
0:16:12.404,000 --> 0:16:14,000
with the sophistication of the modern world

338
0:16:14.602,000 --> 0:16:16,000
is through politics,

339
0:16:16.638,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and sadly you can have humane moral principles,

340
0:16:19.973,000 --> 0:16:23,000
you can classify, you can use logic on abstractions,

341
0:16:24.393,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and if you're ignorant of history and of other countries,

342
0:16:27.323,000 --> 0:16:29,000
you can't do politics.

343
0:16:29.75,000 --> 0:16:32,000
We've noticed, in a trend among young Americans,

344
0:16:32.77,000 --> 0:16:34,000
that they read less history and less literature

345
0:16:35.645,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and less material about foreign lands,

346
0:16:38.255,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and they're essentially ahistorical.

347
0:16:39.95,000 --> 0:16:41,000
They live in the bubble of the present.

348
0:16:42.067,000 --> 0:16:44,000
They don't know the Korean War from the war in Vietnam.

349
0:16:44.923,000 --> 0:16:48,000
They don't know who was an ally of America in World War II.

350
0:16:49.106,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Think how different America would be

351
0:16:51.727,000 --> 0:16:54,000
if every American knew that this is the fifth time

352
0:16:55.323,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Western armies have gone to Afghanistan to put its house in order,

353
0:16:59.417,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and if they had some idea of exactly what had happened

354
0:17:02.781,000 --> 0:17:04,000
on those four previous occasions.

355
0:17:05.106,000 --> 0:17:05,000
(Laughter)

356
0:17:06.056,000 --> 0:17:07,000
And that is, they had barely left,

357
0:17:08.004,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and there wasn't a trace in the sand.

358
0:17:10.336,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Or imagine how different things would be

359
0:17:13.544,000 --> 0:17:15,000
if most Americans knew that we had been lied

360
0:17:16.3,000 --> 0:17:18,000
into four of our last six wars.

361
0:17:19.225,000 --> 0:17:21,000
You know, the Spanish didn't sink the battleship Maine,

362
0:17:22.159,000 --> 0:17:24,000
the Lusitania was not an innocent vessel

363
0:17:24.417,000 --> 0:17:26,000
but was loaded with munitions,

364
0:17:27.05,000 --> 0:17:31,000
the North Vietnamese did not attack the Seventh Fleet,

365
0:17:31.128,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and, of course, Saddam Hussein hated al Qaeda

366
0:17:34.696,000 --> 0:17:35,000
and had nothing to do with it,

367
0:17:36.605,000 --> 0:17:39,000
and yet the administration convinced 45 percent of the people

368
0:17:40.408,000 --> 0:17:41,000
that they were brothers in arms,

369
0:17:41.952,000 --> 0:17:44,000
when he would hang one from the nearest lamppost.

370
0:17:45.831,000 --> 0:17:48,000
But I don't want to end on a pessimistic note.

371
0:17:49.3,000 --> 0:17:53,000
The 20th century has shown enormous cognitive reserves

372
0:17:53.818,000 --> 0:17:56,000
in ordinary people that we have now realized,

373
0:17:57.471,000 --> 0:17:59,000
and the aristocracy was convinced

374
0:17:59.535,000 --> 0:18:01,000
that the average person couldn't make it,

375
0:18:01.714,000 --> 0:18:03,000
that they could never share their mindset

376
0:18:04.68,000 --> 0:18:06,000
or their cognitive abilities.

377
0:18:07.286,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Lord Curzon once said

378
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:11,000
he saw people bathing in the North Sea,

379
0:18:11.264,000 --> 0:18:12,000
and he said, "Why did no one tell me

380
0:18:12.927,000 --> 0:18:14,000
what white bodies the lower orders have?"

381
0:18:15.903,000 --> 0:18:17,000
As if they were a reptile.

382
0:18:18.254,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Well, Dickens was right and he was wrong. [Correction: Rudyard Kipling]

383
0:18:21.304,000 --> 0:18:24,000
[Kipling] said, "The colonel's lady and Judy O'Grady

384
0:18:25.014,000 --> 0:18:28,000
are sisters underneath the skin."

385
0:18:28.223,000 --> 0:18:32,000
(Applause)

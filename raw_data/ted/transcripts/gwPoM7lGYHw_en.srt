1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Well, this is 2009.

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And it's the Bicentenary of Charles Darwin.

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And all over the world, eminent evolutionists

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
are anxious to celebrate this.

5
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And what they're planning to do is to enlighten us

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
on almost every aspect

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
of Darwin and his life,

8
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and how he changed our thinking.

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I say almost every aspect,

10
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
because there is one aspect of this story

11
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
which they have thrown no light on.

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And they seem anxious to skirt around it and step over it

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and to talk about something else.

14
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So I'm going to talk about it.

15
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's the question of, why are we so different from the chimpanzees?

16
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We get the geneticists keeping on telling us

17
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
how extremely closely we are related -- hardly any genes of difference,

18
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
very, very closely related.

19
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And yet, when you look at the phenotypes,

20
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
there's a chimp, there's a man;

21
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
they're astoundingly different,

22
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
no resemblance at all.

23
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I'm not talking about airy-fairy stuff

24
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
about culture or psychology, or behavior.

25
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I'm talking about ground-base, nitty-gritty,

26
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
measurable physical differences.

27
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
They, that one,

28
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
is hairy and walking on four legs.

29
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
That one is a naked biped. Why?

30
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I mean --

31
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
if I'm a good Darwinist, I've got to believe

33
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
there's a reason for that.

34
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
If we changed so much, something must have happened.

35
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
What happened?

36
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now 50 years ago, that was a laughably simple question.

37
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Everybody knew the answer.

38
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
They knew what happened.

39
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
The ancestor of the apes stayed in the trees;

40
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
our ancestors went out onto the plain.

41
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That explained everything.

42
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We had to get up on our legs to peer over the tall grass,

43
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
or to chase after animals,

44
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or to free our hands for weapons.

45
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And we got so overheated in the chase

46
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that we had to take off that fur coat and throw it away.

47
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Everybody knew that, for generations.

48
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
But then, in the '90s, something began to unravel.

49
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The paleontologists themselves looked a bit more closely

50
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
at the accompanying microfauna

51
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that lived in the same time and place as the hominids.

52
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And they weren't savanna species.

53
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And they looked at the herbivores. And they weren't savanna herbivores.

54
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And then they were so clever, they found a way to analyze

55
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
fossilized pollen.

56
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Shock, horror.

57
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The fossilized pollen was not of savanna vegetation.

58
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Some of it even came from lianas,

59
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
those things that dangle in the middle of the jungle.

60
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So we're left with a situation where

61
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we know that our earliest ancestors

62
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
were moving around on four legs in the trees,

63
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
before the savanna ecosystem even came into existence.

64
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This is not something I've made up.

65
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It's not a minority theory.

66
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Everybody agrees with it.

67
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Professor Tobias came over from South Africa

68
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and spoke to University College London.

69
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
He said, "Everything I've been telling you for the last 20 years,

70
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
forget about it. It was wrong.

71
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We've got to go back to square one and start again."

72
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It made him very unpopular. They didn't want to go back to square one.

73
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I mean, it's a terrible thing to happen.

74
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
You've got this beautiful paradigm.

75
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
You've believed it through generations.

76
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Nobody has questioned it.

77
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
You've been constructing fanciful things on top of it,

78
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
relying on it to be as solid as a rock.

79
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And now it's whipped away from under you.

80
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
What do you do? What does a scientist do in that case?

81
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Well, we know the answer because

82
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Thomas S. Kuhn

83
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
wrote a seminal treatise

84
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
about this back in 1962.

85
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
He said what scientists do

86
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
when a paradigm fails

87
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
is, guess what -- they carry on as if nothing had happened.

88
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
If they haven't got a paradigm they can't ask the question.

90
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So they say, "Yes it's wrong,

91
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but supposing it was right ..."

92
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And the only other option open to them

94
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is to stop asking the questions.

95
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So that is what they have done now.

96
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
That's why you don't hear them talking about it. It's yesterday's question.

97
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Some of them have even elevated it into a principle.

98
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It's what we ought to be doing.

99
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
Aaron Filler from Harvard said,

100
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
"Isn't it time we stopped talking about selective pressures?

101
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I mean, why don't we talk about, well, there's chromosomes, and there's genes.

102
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And we just record what we see."

103
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Charles Darwin must be spinning in his grave!

104
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
He knew all about that kind of science.

105
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And he called it hypothesis-free science.

106
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And he despised it from the bottom of his heart.

107
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And if you're going to say,

108
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
"I'm going to stop talking about selective pressures,"

109
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
you can take "The Origin of Species" and throw it out of the window,

110
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
for it's about nothing else but selective pressures.

111
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And the irony of it is,

112
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that this is one occasion of a paradigm collapse

113
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
where we didn't have to wait for a new paradigm to come up.

114
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
There was one waiting in the wings.

115
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It had been waiting there since 1960

116
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
when Alister Hardy, a marine biologist,

117
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
said, "I think what happened,

118
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
perhaps our ancestors

119
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
had a more aquatic existence

120
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
for some of the time."

121
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
He kept it to himself for 30 years.

122
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But then the press got hold of it and all hell broke loose.

123
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
All his colleagues said, "This is outrageous.

124
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
You've exposed us to public ridicule!

125
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
You must never do that again."

126
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And at that time, it became set in stone:

127
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the aquatic theory should be dumped

128
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
with the UFOs and the yetis,

129
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
as part of the lunatic fringe of science.

130
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Well I don't think that.

131
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
I think that Hardy had a lot going for him.

132
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I'd like to talk about just a handful

133
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
of what have been called the

134
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
hallmarks of mankind,

135
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the things that made us different from everybody else,

136
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and all our relatives.

137
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Let's look at our naked skin.

138
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It's obvious that most of the things we think about

139
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
that have lost their body hair, mammals without body hair,

140
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
are aquatic ones, like the dugong, the walrus,

141
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the dolphin, the hippopotamus, the manatee.

142
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And a couple of wallowers-in-mud like the babirusa.

143
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And you're tempted to think, well perhaps,

144
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
could that be why we are naked?

145
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I suggested it and people said, "No no no.

146
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I mean, look at the elephant.

147
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
You've forgotten all about the elephant haven't you?"

148
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So back in 1982 I said,

149
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
"Well perhaps the elephant had an aquatic ancestor."

150
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Peals of merry laughter!

151
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
"That crazy woman. She's off again. She'll say anything won't she?"

152
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But by now, everybody agrees that the elephant had an aquatic ancestor.

153
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This has come 'round to be that all those naked pachyderms

154
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
have aquatic ancestors.

155
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The last exception was supposed to be the rhinoceros.

156
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Last year in Florida they found extinct ancestor of a rhinoceros

157
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and said, "Seems to have spent most of its time in the water."

158
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So this is a close connection between nakedness and water.

159
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
As an absolute connection, it only works one way.

160
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
You can't say all aquatic animals are naked,

161
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because look at the sea otter.

162
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But you can say

163
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that every animal that has become naked

164
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
has been conditioned by water, in its own lifetime,

165
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
or the lifetime of its ancestors. I think this is significant.

166
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The only exception is the naked Somalian mole-rat,

167
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
which never puts its nose above the surface of the ground.

168
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And take bipedality.

169
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Here you can't find anybody to compare it with,

170
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
because we're the only animal that walks upright on two legs.

171
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But you can say this: all the apes and all the monkeys

172
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
are capable of walking on two legs,

173
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
if they want to, for a short time.

174
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
There is only one circumstance in which they

175
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
always, all of them, walk on two legs,

176
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and that is when they are wading through water.

177
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Do you think that's significant?

178
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
David Attenborough thinks it's significant,

179
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
as the possible beginning of our bipedalism.

180
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Look at the fat layer.

181
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We have got, under our skin, a layer of fat, all over:

182
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
nothing in the least like that in any other primate.

183
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Why should it be there?

184
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Well they do know, that if you look at other aquatic mammals,

185
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the fat that in most land mammals

186
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
is deposited inside the body wall,

187
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
around the kidneys and the intestines and so on,

188
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
has started to migrate to the outside,

189
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and spread out in a layer inside the skin.

190
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
In the whale it's complete:

191
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
no fat inside at all, all in blubber outside.

192
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We cannot avoid the suspicion

193
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that in our case it's started to happen.

194
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We have got skin lined with this layer.

195
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
It's the only possible explanation of why humans,

196
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
if they're very unlucky,

197
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
can become grossly obese,

198
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
in a way that would be totally impossible for any other primate, physically impossible.

199
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Something very odd, matter-of-factly, never explained.

200
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
The question of why we can speak.

201
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We can speak.

202
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And the gorilla can't speak. Why?

203
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Nothing to do with his teeth or his tongue or his lungs or anything like that --

204
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
purely has to do with its conscious control of its breath.

205
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
You can't even train a gorilla to say "Ah" on request.

206
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
The only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath

207
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
are the diving animals and the diving birds.

208
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It was an absolute precondition for our being able to speak.

209
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And then again, there is the fact that we are streamlined.

210
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Trying to imagine a diver

211
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
diving into water -- hardly makes a splash.

212
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Try to imagine a gorilla

213
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
performing the same maneuver,

214
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and you can see that, compared with gorilla,

215
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
we are halfway to being shaped like a fish.

216
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I am trying to suggest that, for 40-odd years,

217
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
this aquatic idea has been miscategorized as lunatic fringe,

218
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and it is not lunatic fringe.

219
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And the ironic thing about it is that

220
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
they are not staving off the aquatic theory

221
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to protect a theory of their own,

222
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
which they've all agreed on, and they love.

223
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
There is nothing there.

224
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
They are staving off the aquatic theory

225
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
to protect a vacuum.

226
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Laughter)

227
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Applause)

228
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
How do they react when I say these things?

229
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
One very common reaction I've heard about 20 times

230
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
is, "But it was investigated.

231
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
They conducted a serious investigation of this at the beginning,

232
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
when Hardy put forward his article."

233
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I don't believe it.

234
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
For 35 years I've been looking for any evidence

235
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
of any incident of that kind,

236
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and I've concluded that that's one of the urban myths.

237
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It's never been done.

238
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I ask people sometimes, and they say,

239
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
"I like the aquatic theory!

240
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Everybody likes the aquatic theory.

241
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Of course they don't believe it, but they like it."

242
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Well I say, "Why do you think it's rubbish?"

243
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
They say "Well ...

244
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
everybody I talk to says it's rubbish.

245
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And they can't all be wrong, can they?"

246
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The answer to that, loud and clear, is, "Yes! They can all be wrong."

247
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
History is strewn with the cases when they've all got it wrong.

248
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Applause)

249
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And if you've got a scientific problem like that,

250
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
you can't solve it by holding a head count,

251
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and saying, "More of us say yes than say no."

252
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

253
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Apart from that, some of the heads count more than others.

254
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Some of them have come over.

255
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
There was Professor Tobias. He's come over.

256
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Daniel Dennett, he's come over.

257
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Sir David Attenborough, he's come over.

258
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Anybody else out there? Come on in.

259
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
The water is lovely.

260
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Applause)

261
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And now we've got to look to the future.

262
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Ultimately one of three things is going to happen.

263
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Either they will go on for the next 40 years, 50 years, 60 years.

264
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
"Yeah well we don't talk about that. Let's talk about something interesting."

265
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
That would be very sad.

266
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
The second thing that could happen

267
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
is that some young genius will arrive,

268
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and say, "I've found it.

269
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It was not the savanna, it was not the water, it was this!"

270
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
No sign of that happening either.

271
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
I don't think there is a third option.

272
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So the third thing that might happen is

273
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
a very beautiful thing.

274
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
If you look back at the early years of the last century,

275
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
there was a stand-off, a lot of bickering and bad feeling

276
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
between the believers in Mendel,

277
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and the believers in Darwin.

278
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
It ended with a new synthesis:

279
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Darwin's ideas and Mendel's ideas

280
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
blending together.

281
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And I think the same thing will happen here.

282
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
You'll get a new synthesis.

283
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Hardy's ideas and Darwin's ideas

284
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
will be blended together.

285
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And we can move forward from there,

286
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and really get somewhere.

287
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
That would be a beautiful thing.

288
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
It would be very nice for me if it happened soon.

289
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Laughter)

290
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Because I'm older now than George Burns was when he said,

291
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
"At my age, I don't even buy green bananas."

292
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
(Laughter)

293
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
So if it's going to come and it's going to happen,

294
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
what's holding it up?

295
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
I can tell you that in three words.

296
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Academia says no.

297
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
They decided in 1960,

298
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
"That belongs with the UFOs and the yetis."

299
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And it's not easy to change their minds.

300
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
The professional journals

301
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
won't touch it with a barge pole.

302
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
The textbooks don't mention it.

303
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
The syllabus doesn't mention even the fact that we're naked,

304
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
let alone look for a reason to it.

305
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
"Horizon," which takes its cue from the academics,

306
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
won't touch it with a barge pole.

307
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So we never hear the case put for it,

308
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
except in jocular references

309
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
to people on the lunatic fringe.

310
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I don't know quite where this diktat comes from.

311
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Somebody up there

312
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
is issuing the commandment,

313
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
"Thou shalt not believe in the aquatic theory.

314
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And if you hope to make progress in this profession,

315
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and you do believe it, you'd better keep it to yourself,

316
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
because it will get in your way."

317
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
So I get the impression that some parts

318
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
of the scientific establishment

319
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
are morphing into a kind of priesthood.

320
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
But you know, that makes me feel good,

321
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
because Richard Dawkins has told us

322
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
how to treat a priesthood.

323
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
(Laughter)

324
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
He says, "Firstly, you've got to refuse to give it

325
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
all the excessive awe and reverence

326
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
it's been trained to receive."

327
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
Right. I'll go ahead with that.

328
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And secondly, he says,

329
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
"You must never be afraid to rock the boat."

330
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
I'll go along with that too.

331
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Thank you very much.

332
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
(Applause)

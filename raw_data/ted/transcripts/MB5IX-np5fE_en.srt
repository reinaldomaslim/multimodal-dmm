1
0:00:13.357,000 --> 0:00:14,000
For a really long time,

2
0:00:14.952,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I had two mysteries that were hanging over me.

3
0:00:18.689,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I didn't understand them

4
0:00:20.974,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and, to be honest, I was quite afraid to look into them.

5
0:00:24.349,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The first mystery was, I'm 40 years old,

6
0:00:27.92,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and all throughout my lifetime, year after year,

7
0:00:31.015,000 --> 0:00:34,000
serious depression and anxiety have risen,

8
0:00:34.395,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in the United States, in Britain,

9
0:00:37.109,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and across the Western world.

10
0:00:39.173,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I wanted to understand why.

11
0:00:43.108,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Why is this happening to us?

12
0:00:45.394,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Why is it that with each year that passes,

13
0:00:48.06,000 --> 0:00:51,000
more and more of us are finding it harder to get through the day?

14
0:00:51.743,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I wanted to understand this because of a more personal mystery.

15
0:00:55.324,000 --> 0:00:56,000
When I was a teenager,

16
0:00:56.737,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I remember going to my doctor

17
0:00:58.182,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and explaining that I had this feeling, like pain was leaking out of me.

18
0:01:03.237,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I couldn't control it,

19
0:01:04.657,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I didn't understand why it was happening,

20
0:01:06.966,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I felt quite ashamed of it.

21
0:01:09.045,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And my doctor told me a story

22
0:01:10.665,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that I now realize was well-intentioned,

23
0:01:12.702,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but quite oversimplified.

24
0:01:14.418,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Not totally wrong.

25
0:01:15.61,000 --> 0:01:17,000
My doctor said, "We know why people get like this.

26
0:01:18.426,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Some people just naturally get a chemical imbalance in their heads --

27
0:01:22.682,000 --> 0:01:23,000
you're clearly one of them.

28
0:01:24.127,000 --> 0:01:25,000
All we need to do is give you some drugs,

29
0:01:26.135,000 --> 0:01:28,000
it will get your chemical balance back to normal."

30
0:01:28.523,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So I started taking a drug called Paxil or Seroxat,

31
0:01:30.957,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it's the same thing with different names in different countries.

32
0:01:34.007,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I felt much better, I got a real boost.

33
0:01:36.514,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But not very long afterwards,

34
0:01:37.949,000 --> 0:01:39,000
this feeling of pain started to come back.

35
0:01:39.974,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So I was given higher and higher doses

36
0:01:41.826,000 --> 0:01:44,000
until, for 13 years, I was taking the maximum possible dose

37
0:01:45.061,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that you're legally allowed to take.

38
0:01:47.402,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And for a lot of those 13 years, and pretty much all the time by the end,

39
0:01:50.895,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I was still in a lot of pain.

40
0:01:52.419,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And I started asking myself, "What's going on here?

41
0:01:55.419,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Because you're doing everything

42
0:01:56.985,000 --> 0:01:59,000
you're told to do by the story that's dominating the culture --

43
0:02:00.149,000 --> 0:02:02,000
why do you still feel like this?"

44
0:02:02.292,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So to get to the bottom of these two mysteries,

45
0:02:05.188,000 --> 0:02:06,000
for a book that I've written

46
0:02:06.62,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I ended up going on a big journey all over the world,

47
0:02:09.149,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I traveled over 40,000 miles.

48
0:02:10.592,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I wanted to sit with the leading experts in the world

49
0:02:13.109,000 --> 0:02:15,000
about what causes depression and anxiety

50
0:02:15.3,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and crucially, what solves them,

51
0:02:17.196,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and people who have come through depression and anxiety

52
0:02:19.844,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and out the other side in all sorts of ways.

53
0:02:21.98,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And I learned a huge amount

54
0:02:23.49,000 --> 0:02:25,000
from the amazing people I got to know along the way.

55
0:02:26.069,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But I think at the heart of what I learned is,

56
0:02:29.069,000 --> 0:02:32,000
so far, we have scientific evidence

57
0:02:32.128,000 --> 0:02:35,000
for nine different causes of depression and anxiety.

58
0:02:35.859,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Two of them are indeed in our biology.

59
0:02:38.692,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Your genes can make you more sensitive to these problems,

60
0:02:41.399,000 --> 0:02:42,000
though they don't write your destiny.

61
0:02:43.357,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And there are real brain changes that can happen when you become depressed

62
0:02:46.992,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that can make it harder to get out.

63
0:02:48.714,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But most of the factors that have been proven

64
0:02:50.92,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to cause depression and anxiety

65
0:02:52.785,000 --> 0:02:53,000
are not in our biology.

66
0:02:55.52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
They are factors in the way we live.

67
0:02:58.116,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And once you understand them,

68
0:02:59.631,000 --> 0:03:02,000
it opens up a very different set of solutions

69
0:03:02.751,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that should be offered to people

70
0:03:04.323,000 --> 0:03:06,000
alongside the option of chemical antidepressants.

71
0:03:07.284,000 --> 0:03:08,000
For example,

72
0:03:09.101,000 --> 0:03:12,000
if you're lonely, you're more likely to become depressed.

73
0:03:12.573,000 --> 0:03:15,000
If, when you go to work, you don't have any control over your job,

74
0:03:15.708,000 --> 0:03:16,000
you've just got to do what you're told,

75
0:03:17.628,000 --> 0:03:18,000
you're more likely to become depressed.

76
0:03:19.541,000 --> 0:03:21,000
If you very rarely get out into the natural world,

77
0:03:22.049,000 --> 0:03:23,000
you're more likely to become depressed.

78
0:03:23.942,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And one thing unites a lot of the causes of depression and anxiety

79
0:03:27.077,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that I learned about.

80
0:03:28.276,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Not all of them, but a lot of them.

81
0:03:30.363,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Everyone here knows

82
0:03:32.053,000 --> 0:03:34,000
you've all got natural physical needs, right?

83
0:03:34.736,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Obviously.

84
0:03:35.934,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You need food, you need water,

85
0:03:38.537,000 --> 0:03:4,000
you need shelter, you need clean air.

86
0:03:40.791,000 --> 0:03:41,000
If I took those things away from you,

87
0:03:42.609,000 --> 0:03:44,000
you'd all be in real trouble, real fast.

88
0:03:44.926,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But at the same time,

89
0:03:46.752,000 --> 0:03:49,000
every human being has natural psychological needs.

90
0:03:50.147,000 --> 0:03:52,000
You need to feel you belong.

91
0:03:52.21,000 --> 0:03:55,000
You need to feel your life has meaning and purpose.

92
0:03:55.298,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You need to feel that people see you and value you.

93
0:03:57.853,000 --> 0:03:59,000
You need to feel you've got a future that makes sense.

94
0:04:00.434,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And this culture we built is good at lots of things.

95
0:04:03.506,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And many things are better than in the past --

96
0:04:05.69,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I'm glad to be alive today.

97
0:04:07.035,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But we've been getting less and less good

98
0:04:09.023,000 --> 0:04:13,000
at meeting these deep, underlying psychological needs.

99
0:04:13.895,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And it's not the only thing that's going on,

100
0:04:16.022,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but I think it's the key reason why this crisis keeps rising and rising.

101
0:04:20.919,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And I found this really hard to absorb.

102
0:04:24.173,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I really wrestled with the idea

103
0:04:26.903,000 --> 0:04:3,000
of shifting from thinking of my depression as just a problem in my brain,

104
0:04:31.333,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to one with many causes,

105
0:04:32.524,000 --> 0:04:34,000
including many in the way we're living.

106
0:04:34.609,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And it only really began to fall into place for me

107
0:04:36.998,000 --> 0:04:39,000
when one day, I went to interview a South African psychiatrist

108
0:04:40.165,000 --> 0:04:41,000
named Dr. Derek Summerfield.

109
0:04:41.99,000 --> 0:04:42,000
He's a great guy.

110
0:04:43.165,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And Dr. Summerfield happened to be in Cambodia in 2001,

111
0:04:46.903,000 --> 0:04:49,000
when they first introduced chemical antidepressants

112
0:04:50.22,000 --> 0:04:51,000
for people in that country.

113
0:04:51.976,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And the local doctors, the Cambodians, had never heard of these drugs,

114
0:04:55.297,000 --> 0:04:56,000
so they were like, what are they?

115
0:04:56.912,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And he explained.

116
0:04:58.15,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And they said to him,

117
0:04:59.706,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"We don't need them, we've already got antidepressants."

118
0:05:02.427,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And he was like, "What do you mean?"

119
0:05:04.188,000 --> 0:05:07,000
He thought they were going to talk about some kind of herbal remedy,

120
0:05:07.451,000 --> 0:05:1,000
like St. John's Wort, ginkgo biloba, something like that.

121
0:05:11.91,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Instead, they told him a story.

122
0:05:14.8,000 --> 0:05:17,000
There was a farmer in their community who worked in the rice fields.

123
0:05:18.403,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And one day, he stood on a land mine

124
0:05:20.197,000 --> 0:05:22,000
left over from the war with the United States,

125
0:05:22.411,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and he got his leg blown off.

126
0:05:23.847,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So they him an artificial leg,

127
0:05:25.307,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and after a while, he went back to work in the rice fields.

128
0:05:28.102,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But apparently, it's super painful to work under water

129
0:05:30.658,000 --> 0:05:31,000
when you've got an artificial limb,

130
0:05:32.356,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and I'm guessing it was pretty traumatic

131
0:05:34.3,000 --> 0:05:36,000
to go back and work in the field where he got blown up.

132
0:05:36.903,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The guy started to cry all day,

133
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
he refused to get out of bed,

134
0:05:40.783,000 --> 0:05:42,000
he developed all the symptoms of classic depression.

135
0:05:44.013,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The Cambodian doctor said,

136
0:05:45.402,000 --> 0:05:47,000
"This is when we gave him an antidepressant."

137
0:05:47.712,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And Dr. Summerfield said, "What was it?"

138
0:05:50.371,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They explained that they went and sat with him.

139
0:05:53.982,000 --> 0:05:54,000
They listened to him.

140
0:05:56.464,000 --> 0:05:58,000
They realized that his pain made sense --

141
0:05:59.035,000 --> 0:06:01,000
it was hard for him to see it in the throes of his depression,

142
0:06:01.98,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but actually, it had perfectly understandable causes in his life.

143
0:06:05.966,000 --> 0:06:08,000
One of the doctors, talking to the people in the community, figured,

144
0:06:09.188,000 --> 0:06:1,000
"You know, if we bought this guy a cow,

145
0:06:11.149,000 --> 0:06:13,000
he could become a dairy farmer,

146
0:06:13.173,000 --> 0:06:16,000
he wouldn't be in this position that was screwing him up so much,

147
0:06:16.292,000 --> 0:06:18,000
he wouldn't have to go and work in the rice fields."

148
0:06:18.823,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So they bought him a cow.

149
0:06:20.046,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Within a couple of weeks, his crying stopped,

150
0:06:22.25,000 --> 0:06:23,000
within a month, his depression was gone.

151
0:06:24.186,000 --> 0:06:25,000
They said to doctor Summerfield,

152
0:06:25.789,000 --> 0:06:27,000
"So you see, doctor, that cow, that was an antidepressant,

153
0:06:28.583,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that's what you mean, right?"

154
0:06:30.074,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Laughter)

155
0:06:31.249,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Applause)

156
0:06:34.326,000 --> 0:06:36,000
If you'd been raised to think about depression the way I was,

157
0:06:37.223,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and most of the people here were,

158
0:06:38.859,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that sounds like a bad joke, right?

159
0:06:40.557,000 --> 0:06:42,000
"I went to my doctor for an antidepressant,

160
0:06:42.605,000 --> 0:06:43,000
she gave me a cow."

161
0:06:43.795,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But what those Cambodian doctors knew intuitively,

162
0:06:46.846,000 --> 0:06:48,000
based on this individual, unscientific anecdote,

163
0:06:49.847,000 --> 0:06:52,000
is what the leading medical body in the world,

164
0:06:53.156,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the World Health Organization,

165
0:06:55.267,000 --> 0:06:57,000
has been trying to tell us for years,

166
0:06:57.481,000 --> 0:06:59,000
based on the best scientific evidence.

167
0:07:00.576,000 --> 0:07:01,000
If you're depressed,

168
0:07:02.529,000 --> 0:07:03,000
if you're anxious,

169
0:07:05.008,000 --> 0:07:08,000
you're not weak, you're not crazy,

170
0:07:08.292,000 --> 0:07:11,000
you're not, in the main, a machine with broken parts.

171
0:07:12.95,000 --> 0:07:14,000
You're a human being with unmet needs.

172
0:07:15.919,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And it's just as important to think here about what those Cambodian doctors

173
0:07:19.483,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and the World Health Organization are not saying.

174
0:07:21.824,000 --> 0:07:22,000
They did not say to this farmer,

175
0:07:23.38,000 --> 0:07:25,000
"Hey, buddy, you need to pull yourself together.

176
0:07:26.205,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It's your job to figure out and fix this problem on your own."

177
0:07:29.851,000 --> 0:07:3,000
On the contrary, what they said is,

178
0:07:31.867,000 --> 0:07:34,000
"We're here as a group to pull together with you,

179
0:07:35.415,000 --> 0:07:39,000
so together, we can figure out and fix this problem."

180
0:07:40.543,000 --> 0:07:44,000
This is what every depressed person needs,

181
0:07:44.583,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and it's what every depressed person deserves.

182
0:07:47.852,000 --> 0:07:49,000
This is why one of the leading doctors at the United Nations,

183
0:07:50.863,000 --> 0:07:52,000
in their official statement for World Health Day,

184
0:07:53.205,000 --> 0:07:54,000
couple of years back in 2017,

185
0:07:54.72,000 --> 0:07:56,000
said we need to talk less about chemical imbalances

186
0:07:57.561,000 --> 0:08:,000
and more about the imbalances in the way we live.

187
0:08:00.92,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Drugs give real relief to some people --

188
0:08:02.917,000 --> 0:08:04,000
they gave relief to me for a while --

189
0:08:05.071,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but precisely because this problem goes deeper than their biology,

190
0:08:09.522,000 --> 0:08:12,000
the solutions need to go much deeper, too.

191
0:08:12.601,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But when I first learned that,

192
0:08:15.212,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I remember thinking,

193
0:08:16.919,000 --> 0:08:18,000
"OK, I could see all the scientific evidence,

194
0:08:19.069,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I read a huge number of studies,

195
0:08:20.665,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I interviewed a huge number of the experts who were explaining this,"

196
0:08:23.995,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but I kept thinking, "How can we possibly do that?"

197
0:08:26.405,000 --> 0:08:27,000
The things that are making us depressed

198
0:08:28.342,000 --> 0:08:3,000
are in most cases more complex than what was going on

199
0:08:30.857,000 --> 0:08:31,000
with this Cambodian farmer.

200
0:08:32.178,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Where do we even begin with that insight?

201
0:08:34.836,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But then, in the long journey for my book,

202
0:08:38.109,000 --> 0:08:39,000
all over the world,

203
0:08:39.704,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I kept meeting people who were doing exactly that,

204
0:08:42.323,000 --> 0:08:44,000
from Sydney, to San Francisco,

205
0:08:44.799,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to São Paulo.

206
0:08:45.995,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I kept meeting people who were understanding

207
0:08:48.085,000 --> 0:08:5,000
the deeper causes of depression and anxiety

208
0:08:50.456,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and, as groups, fixing them.

209
0:08:52.895,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Obviously, I can't tell you about all the amazing people

210
0:08:55.6,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I got to know and wrote about,

211
0:08:57.1,000 --> 0:09:,000
or all of the nine causes of depression and anxiety that I learned about,

212
0:09:00.577,000 --> 0:09:02,000
because they won't let me give a 10-hour TED Talk --

213
0:09:03.083,000 --> 0:09:04,000
you can complain about that to them.

214
0:09:04.859,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But I want to focus on two of the causes

215
0:09:06.813,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and two of the solutions that emerge from them, if that's alright.

216
0:09:10.578,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Here's the first.

217
0:09:12.285,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We are the loneliest society in human history.

218
0:09:15.317,000 --> 0:09:17,000
There was a recent study that asked Americans,

219
0:09:18.174,000 --> 0:09:21,000
"Do you feel like you're no longer close to anyone?"

220
0:09:21.348,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And 39 percent of people said that described them.

221
0:09:25.023,000 --> 0:09:26,000
"No longer close to anyone."

222
0:09:26.411,000 --> 0:09:28,000
In the international measurements of loneliness,

223
0:09:28.932,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Britain and the rest of Europe are just behind the US,

224
0:09:31.514,000 --> 0:09:32,000
in case anyone here is feeling smug.

225
0:09:33.323,000 --> 0:09:34,000
(Laughter)

226
0:09:34.355,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I spent a lot of time discussing this

227
0:09:36.268,000 --> 0:09:38,000
with the leading expert in the world on loneliness,

228
0:09:38.688,000 --> 0:09:4,000
an incredible man named professor John Cacioppo,

229
0:09:40.966,000 --> 0:09:41,000
who was at Chicago,

230
0:09:42.141,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and I thought a lot about one question his work poses to us.

231
0:09:44.988,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Professor Cacioppo asked,

232
0:09:47.317,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"Why do we exist?

233
0:09:48.991,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Why are we here, why are we alive?"

234
0:09:50.968,000 --> 0:09:52,000
One key reason

235
0:09:53.198,000 --> 0:09:55,000
is that our ancestors on the savannas of Africa

236
0:09:56.039,000 --> 0:09:57,000
were really good at one thing.

237
0:09:58.287,000 --> 0:10:01,000
They weren't bigger than the animals they took down a lot of the time,

238
0:10:01.601,000 --> 0:10:04,000
they weren't faster than the animals they took down a lot of the time,

239
0:10:04.938,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but they were much better at banding together into groups

240
0:10:07.676,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and cooperating.

241
0:10:09.3,000 --> 0:10:11,000
This was our superpower as a species --

242
0:10:11.585,000 --> 0:10:12,000
we band together,

243
0:10:13.014,000 --> 0:10:15,000
just like bees evolved to live in a hive,

244
0:10:15.514,000 --> 0:10:17,000
humans evolved to live in a tribe.

245
0:10:17.77,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And we are the first humans ever

246
0:10:22.492,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to disband our tribes.

247
0:10:24.484,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And it is making us feel awful.

248
0:10:27.048,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But it doesn't have to be this way.

249
0:10:29.216,000 --> 0:10:31,000
One of the heroes in my book, and in fact, in my life,

250
0:10:31.874,000 --> 0:10:33,000
is a doctor named Sam Everington.

251
0:10:33.993,000 --> 0:10:35,000
He's a general practitioner in a poor part of East London,

252
0:10:36.755,000 --> 0:10:37,000
where I lived for many years.

253
0:10:38.358,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And Sam was really uncomfortable,

254
0:10:40.069,000 --> 0:10:41,000
because he had loads of patients

255
0:10:41.649,000 --> 0:10:43,000
coming to him with terrible depression and anxiety.

256
0:10:44.117,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And like me, he's not opposed to chemical antidepressants,

257
0:10:46.863,000 --> 0:10:48,000
he thinks they give some relief to some people.

258
0:10:49.109,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But he could see two things.

259
0:10:50.506,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Firstly, his patients were depressed and anxious a lot of the time

260
0:10:54.085,000 --> 0:10:57,000
for totally understandable reasons, like loneliness.

261
0:10:57.847,000 --> 0:11:,000
And secondly, although the drugs were giving some relief to some people,

262
0:11:01.315,000 --> 0:11:03,000
for many people, they didn't solve the problem.

263
0:11:03.607,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The underlying problem.

264
0:11:05.871,000 --> 0:11:07,000
One day, Sam decided to pioneer a different approach.

265
0:11:08.546,000 --> 0:11:1,000
A woman came to his center, his medical center,

266
0:11:11.022,000 --> 0:11:12,000
called Lisa Cunningham.

267
0:11:12.513,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I got to know Lisa later.

268
0:11:14.411,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And Lisa had been shut away in her home with crippling depression and anxiety

269
0:11:18.519,000 --> 0:11:19,000
for seven years.

270
0:11:20.898,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And when she came to Sam's center, she was told, "Don't worry,

271
0:11:23.847,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we'll carry on giving you these drugs,

272
0:11:25.701,000 --> 0:11:27,000
but we're also going to prescribe something else.

273
0:11:28.522,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We're going to prescribe for you to come here to this center twice a week

274
0:11:31.989,000 --> 0:11:33,000
to meet with a group of other depressed and anxious people,

275
0:11:34.791,000 --> 0:11:36,000
not to talk about how miserable you are,

276
0:11:37.625,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but to figure out something meaningful you can all do together

277
0:11:41.196,000 --> 0:11:44,000
so you won't be lonely and you won't feel like life is pointless."

278
0:11:44.323,000 --> 0:11:46,000
The first time this group met,

279
0:11:47.122,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Lisa literally started vomiting with anxiety,

280
0:11:49.402,000 --> 0:11:5,000
it was so overwhelming for her.

281
0:11:51.347,000 --> 0:11:53,000
But people rubbed her back, the group started talking,

282
0:11:54.005,000 --> 0:11:55,000
they were like, "What could we do?"

283
0:11:55.704,000 --> 0:11:57,000
These are inner-city, East London people like me,

284
0:11:58.022,000 --> 0:12:,000
they didn't know anything about gardening.

285
0:12:00.094,000 --> 0:12:02,000
They were like, "Why don't we learn gardening?"

286
0:12:02.363,000 --> 0:12:04,000
There was an area behind the doctors' offices

287
0:12:04.553,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that was just scrubland.

288
0:12:05.728,000 --> 0:12:06,000
"Why don't we make this into a garden?"

289
0:12:07.634,000 --> 0:12:09,000
They started to take books out of the library,

290
0:12:09.833,000 --> 0:12:1,000
started to watch YouTube clips.

291
0:12:11.342,000 --> 0:12:13,000
They started to get their fingers in the soil.

292
0:12:13.844,000 --> 0:12:16,000
They started to learn the rhythms of the seasons.

293
0:12:16.911,000 --> 0:12:17,000
There's a lot of evidence

294
0:12:18.265,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that exposure to the natural world

295
0:12:19.918,000 --> 0:12:2,000
is a really powerful antidepressant.

296
0:12:21.918,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But they started to do something even more important.

297
0:12:25.347,000 --> 0:12:27,000
They started to form a tribe.

298
0:12:27.401,000 --> 0:12:28,000
They started to form a group.

299
0:12:29.236,000 --> 0:12:31,000
They started to care about each other.

300
0:12:31.284,000 --> 0:12:32,000
If one of them didn't show up,

301
0:12:32.982,000 --> 0:12:34,000
the others would go looking for them -- "Are you OK?"

302
0:12:35.526,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Help them figure out what was troubling them that day.

303
0:12:38.161,000 --> 0:12:39,000
The way Lisa put it to me,

304
0:12:39.988,000 --> 0:12:41,000
"As the garden began to bloom,

305
0:12:42.609,000 --> 0:12:43,000
we began to bloom."

306
0:12:44.474,000 --> 0:12:46,000
This approach is called social prescribing,

307
0:12:46.53,000 --> 0:12:47,000
it's spreading all over Europe.

308
0:12:48.069,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And there's a small, but growing body of evidence

309
0:12:50.394,000 --> 0:12:52,000
suggesting it can produce real and meaningful falls

310
0:12:53.298,000 --> 0:12:54,000
in depression and anxiety.

311
0:12:55.3,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And one day, I remember standing in the garden

312
0:12:59.045,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that Lisa and her once-depressed friends had built --

313
0:13:01.55,000 --> 0:13:02,000
it's a really beautiful garden --

314
0:13:03.158,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and having this thought,

315
0:13:04.373,000 --> 0:13:07,000
it's very much inspired by a guy called professor Hugh Mackay in Australia.

316
0:13:08.268,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I was thinking, so often when people feel down in this culture,

317
0:13:12.673,000 --> 0:13:15,000
what we say to them -- I'm sure everyone here said it, I have --

318
0:13:15.761,000 --> 0:13:18,000
we say, "You just need to be you, be yourself."

319
0:13:19.742,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And I've realized, actually, what we should say to people is,

320
0:13:22.716,000 --> 0:13:23,000
"Don't be you.

321
0:13:24.306,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Don't be yourself.

322
0:13:26.218,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Be us, be we.

323
0:13:28.765,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Be part of a group."

324
0:13:30.114,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Applause)

325
0:13:33.844,000 --> 0:13:35,000
The solution to these problems

326
0:13:36.447,000 --> 0:13:39,000
does not lie in drawing more and more on your resources

327
0:13:39.622,000 --> 0:13:4,000
as an isolated individual --

328
0:13:41.085,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that's partly what got us in this crisis.

329
0:13:43.149,000 --> 0:13:45,000
It lies on reconnecting with something bigger than you.

330
0:13:45.926,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And that really connects to one of the other causes

331
0:13:48.371,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of depression and anxiety that I wanted to talk to you about.

332
0:13:51.292,000 --> 0:13:52,000
So everyone knows

333
0:13:53.006,000 --> 0:13:56,000
junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick.

334
0:13:56.776,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I don't say that with any sense of superiority,

335
0:13:59.006,000 --> 0:14:01,000
I literally came to give this talk from McDonald's.

336
0:14:01.429,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I saw all of you eating that healthy TED breakfast, I was like no way.

337
0:14:04.966,000 --> 0:14:09,000
But just like junk food has taken over our diets and made us physically sick,

338
0:14:10.133,000 --> 0:14:14,000
a kind of junk values have taken over our minds

339
0:14:14.267,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and made us mentally sick.

340
0:14:16.157,000 --> 0:14:19,000
For thousands of years, philosophers have said,

341
0:14:19.285,000 --> 0:14:23,000
if you think life is about money, and status and showing off,

342
0:14:23.897,000 --> 0:14:24,000
you're going to feel like crap.

343
0:14:25.444,000 --> 0:14:27,000
That's not an exact quote from Schopenhauer,

344
0:14:27.535,000 --> 0:14:28,000
but that is the gist of what he said.

345
0:14:29.331,000 --> 0:14:32,000
But weirdly, hardy anyone had scientifically investigated this,

346
0:14:32.381,000 --> 0:14:35,000
until a truly extraordinary person I got to know, named professor Tim Kasser,

347
0:14:36.054,000 --> 0:14:38,000
who's at Knox College in Illinois,

348
0:14:38.371,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and he's been researching this for about 30 years now.

349
0:14:40.958,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And his research suggests several really important things.

350
0:14:43.998,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Firstly, the more you believe

351
0:14:47.213,000 --> 0:14:51,000
you can buy and display your way out of sadness,

352
0:14:51.602,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and into a good life,

353
0:14:53.817,000 --> 0:14:55,000
the more likely you are to become depressed and anxious.

354
0:14:56.753,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And secondly,

355
0:14:58.07,000 --> 0:15:02,000
as a society, we have become much more driven by these beliefs.

356
0:15:02.682,000 --> 0:15:03,000
All throughout my lifetime,

357
0:15:04.119,000 --> 0:15:08,000
under the weight of advertising and Instagram and everything like them.

358
0:15:08.871,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And as I thought about this,

359
0:15:10.268,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I realized it's like we've all been fed since birth, a kind of KFC for the soul.

360
0:15:16.053,000 --> 0:15:19,000
We've been trained to look for happiness in all the wrong places,

361
0:15:19.95,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and just like junk food doesn't meet your nutritional needs

362
0:15:22.744,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and actually makes you feel terrible,

363
0:15:25.066,000 --> 0:15:28,000
junk values don't meet your psychological needs,

364
0:15:28.232,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and they take you away from a good life.

365
0:15:30.898,000 --> 0:15:32,000
But when I first spent time with professor Kasser

366
0:15:33.545,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and I was learning all this,

367
0:15:35.046,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I felt a really weird mixture of emotions.

368
0:15:37.657,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Because on the one hand, I found this really challenging.

369
0:15:40.371,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I could see how often in my own life, when I felt down,

370
0:15:43.657,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I tried to remedy it with some kind of show-offy, grand external solution.

371
0:15:49.441,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And I could see why that did not work well for me.

372
0:15:52.93,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I also thought, isn't this kind of obvious?

373
0:15:55.836,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Isn't this almost like banal, right?

374
0:15:57.605,000 --> 0:15:58,000
If I said to everyone here,

375
0:15:58.954,000 --> 0:16:,000
none of you are going to lie on your deathbed

376
0:16:01.121,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and think about all the shoes you bought and all the retweets you got,

377
0:16:04.461,000 --> 0:16:05,000
you're going to think about moments

378
0:16:06.168,000 --> 0:16:08,000
of love, meaning and connection in your life.

379
0:16:08.303,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I think that seems almost like a cliché.

380
0:16:10.272,000 --> 0:16:12,000
But I kept talking to professor Kasser and saying,

381
0:16:12.645,000 --> 0:16:14,000
"Why am I feeling this strange doubleness?"

382
0:16:15.022,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And he said, "At some level, we all know these things.

383
0:16:18.853,000 --> 0:16:2,000
But in this culture, we don't live by them."

384
0:16:21.252,000 --> 0:16:23,000
We know them so well they've become clichés,

385
0:16:23.355,000 --> 0:16:24,000
but we don't live by them.

386
0:16:24.657,000 --> 0:16:27,000
I kept asking why, why would we know something so profound,

387
0:16:27.89,000 --> 0:16:28,000
but not live by it?

388
0:16:29.2,000 --> 0:16:32,000
And after a while, professor Kasser said to me,

389
0:16:32.628,000 --> 0:16:34,000
"Because we live in a machine

390
0:16:35.073,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life."

391
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
I had to really think about that.

392
0:16:40.871,000 --> 0:16:41,000
"Because we live in a machine

393
0:16:42.3,000 --> 0:16:45,000
that is designed to get us to neglect what is important about life."

394
0:16:46.299,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And professor Kasser wanted to figure out if we can disrupt that machine.

395
0:16:50.101,000 --> 0:16:51,000
He's done loads of research into this;

396
0:16:51.998,000 --> 0:16:52,000
I'll tell you about one example,

397
0:16:53.577,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and I really urge everyone here to try this with their friends and family.

398
0:16:57.101,000 --> 0:17:,000
With a guy called Nathan Dungan, he got a group of teenagers and adults

399
0:17:00.467,000 --> 0:17:04,000
to come together for a series of sessions over a period of time, to meet up.

400
0:17:04.704,000 --> 0:17:05,000
And part of the point of the group

401
0:17:06.491,000 --> 0:17:09,000
was to get people to think about a moment in their life

402
0:17:09.815,000 --> 0:17:11,000
they had actually found meaning and purpose.

403
0:17:12.585,000 --> 0:17:14,000
For different people, it was different things.

404
0:17:14.752,000 --> 0:17:17,000
For some people, it was playing music, writing, helping someone --

405
0:17:18.393,000 --> 0:17:2,000
I'm sure everyone here can picture something, right?

406
0:17:21.22,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And part of the point of the group was to get people to ask,

407
0:17:24.125,000 --> 0:17:26,000
"OK, how could you dedicate more of your life

408
0:17:26.911,000 --> 0:17:28,000
to pursuing these moments of meaning and purpose,

409
0:17:29.619,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and less to, I don't know, buying crap you don't need,

410
0:17:32.593,000 --> 0:17:34,000
putting it on social media and trying to get people to go,

411
0:17:35.339,000 --> 0:17:36,000
'OMG, so jealous!'"

412
0:17:36.958,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And what they found was,

413
0:17:38.625,000 --> 0:17:39,000
just having these meetings,

414
0:17:39.983,000 --> 0:17:42,000
it was like a kind of Alcoholics Anonymous for consumerism, right?

415
0:17:43.807,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Getting people to have these meetings, articulate these values,

416
0:17:46.784,000 --> 0:17:48,000
determine to act on them and check in with each other,

417
0:17:49.339,000 --> 0:17:51,000
led to a marked shift in people's values.

418
0:17:52.22,000 --> 0:17:56,000
It took them away from this hurricane of depression-generating messages

419
0:17:56.657,000 --> 0:17:58,000
training us to seek happiness in the wrong places,

420
0:17:59.315,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and towards more meaningful and nourishing values

421
0:18:02.68,000 --> 0:18:04,000
that lift us out of depression.

422
0:18:05.347,000 --> 0:18:08,000
But with all the solutions that I saw and have written about,

423
0:18:08.673,000 --> 0:18:1,000
and many I can't talk about here,

424
0:18:11.436,000 --> 0:18:12,000
I kept thinking,

425
0:18:12.831,000 --> 0:18:15,000
you know: Why did it take me so long to see these insights?

426
0:18:16.554,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Because when you explain them to people --

427
0:18:18.594,000 --> 0:18:2,000
some of them are more complicated, but not all --

428
0:18:21.062,000 --> 0:18:24,000
when you explain this to people, it's not like rocket science, right?

429
0:18:24.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
At some level, we already know these things.

430
0:18:26.449,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Why do we find it so hard to understand?

431
0:18:29.11,000 --> 0:18:3,000
I think there's many reasons.

432
0:18:31.475,000 --> 0:18:35,000
But I think one reason is that we have to change our understanding

433
0:18:35.768,000 --> 0:18:38,000
of what depression and anxiety actually are.

434
0:18:39.776,000 --> 0:18:41,000
There are very real biological contributions

435
0:18:41.982,000 --> 0:18:42,000
to depression and anxiety.

436
0:18:44.117,000 --> 0:18:47,000
But if we allow the biology to become the whole picture,

437
0:18:47.895,000 --> 0:18:48,000
as I did for so long,

438
0:18:49.165,000 --> 0:18:53,000
as I would argue our culture has done pretty much most of my life,

439
0:18:53.254,000 --> 0:18:56,000
what we're implicitly saying to people is, and this isn't anyone's intention,

440
0:18:57.135,000 --> 0:19:,000
but what we're implicitly saying to people is,

441
0:19:00.196,000 --> 0:19:02,000
"Your pain doesn't mean anything.

442
0:19:02.522,000 --> 0:19:03,000
It's just a malfunction.

443
0:19:03.982,000 --> 0:19:05,000
It's like a glitch in a computer program,

444
0:19:06.475,000 --> 0:19:08,000
it's just a wiring problem in your head."

445
0:19:10.061,000 --> 0:19:13,000
But I was only able to start changing my life

446
0:19:13.192,000 --> 0:19:17,000
when I realized your depression is not a malfunction.

447
0:19:18.62,000 --> 0:19:19,000
It's a signal.

448
0:19:20.684,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Your depression is a signal.

449
0:19:23.077,000 --> 0:19:24,000
It's telling you something.

450
0:19:24.942,000 --> 0:19:28,000
(Applause)

451
0:19:29.577,000 --> 0:19:31,000
We feel this way for reasons,

452
0:19:31.99,000 --> 0:19:33,000
and they can be hard to see in the throes of depression --

453
0:19:34.729,000 --> 0:19:36,000
I understand that really well from personal experience.

454
0:19:37.363,000 --> 0:19:4,000
But with the right help, we can understand these problems

455
0:19:40.87,000 --> 0:19:42,000
and we can fix these problems together.

456
0:19:43.368,000 --> 0:19:44,000
But to do that,

457
0:19:44.584,000 --> 0:19:45,000
the very first step

458
0:19:46.346,000 --> 0:19:48,000
is we have to stop insulting these signals

459
0:19:48.988,000 --> 0:19:52,000
by saying they're a sign of weakness, or madness or purely biological,

460
0:19:53.204,000 --> 0:19:54,000
except for a tiny number of people.

461
0:19:55.163,000 --> 0:19:58,000
We need to start listening to these signals,

462
0:19:58.813,000 --> 0:20:01,000
because they're telling us something we really need to hear.

463
0:20:02.514,000 --> 0:20:07,000
It's only when we truly listen to these signals,

464
0:20:07.561,000 --> 0:20:11,000
and we honor these signals and respect these signals,

465
0:20:11.6,000 --> 0:20:13,000

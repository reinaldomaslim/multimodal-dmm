1
0:00:13.163,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Once there was a star.

2
0:00:16.082,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Like everything else, she was born;

3
0:00:18.828,000 --> 0:00:21,000
grew to be around 30 times the mass of our sun

4
0:00:22.633,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and lived for a very long time.

5
0:00:25.475,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Exactly how long,

6
0:00:26.867,000 --> 0:00:27,000
people cannot really tell.

7
0:00:29.162,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Just like everything in life,

8
0:00:30.965,000 --> 0:00:33,000
she reached the end of her regular star days

9
0:00:34.438,000 --> 0:00:36,000
when her heart, the core of her life,

10
0:00:37.039,000 --> 0:00:38,000
exhausted its fuel.

11
0:00:38.905,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But that was no end.

12
0:00:40.236,000 --> 0:00:43,000
She transformed into a supernova, and in the process

13
0:00:43.786,000 --> 0:00:45,000
releasing a tremendous amount of energy,

14
0:00:46.464,000 --> 0:00:48,000
outshining the rest of the galaxy

15
0:00:49.196,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and emitting, in one second,

16
0:00:51.554,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the same amount of energy our sun will release in 10 days.

17
0:00:55.651,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And she evolved into another role in our galaxy.

18
0:00:59.783,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Supernova explosions are very extreme.

19
0:01:02.638,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But the ones that emit gamma rays are even more extreme.

20
0:01:07.417,000 --> 0:01:09,000
In the process of becoming a supernova,

21
0:01:09.73,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the interior of the star collapses under its own weight

22
0:01:13.177,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and it starts rotating ever faster,

23
0:01:16.089,000 --> 0:01:19,000
like an ice skater when pulling their arms in close to their body.

24
0:01:20.592,000 --> 0:01:24,000
In that way, it starts rotating very fast and it increases, powerfully,

25
0:01:25.074,000 --> 0:01:26,000
its magnetic field.

26
0:01:27.011,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The matter around the star is dragged around,

27
0:01:30.124,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and some energy from that rotation is transferred to that matter

28
0:01:33.466,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and the magnetic field is increased even further.

29
0:01:37.477,000 --> 0:01:42,000
In that way, our star had extra energy to outshine the rest of the galaxy

30
0:01:43.263,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in brightness and gamma ray emission.

31
0:01:46.119,000 --> 0:01:48,000
My star, the one in my story,

32
0:01:48.632,000 --> 0:01:5,000
became what is known as a magnetar.

33
0:01:51.304,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And just for your information,

34
0:01:53.009,000 --> 0:01:56,000
the magnetic field of a magnetar is 1,000 trillion times

35
0:01:56.914,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the magnetic field of Earth.

36
0:01:59.953,000 --> 0:02:01,000
The most energetic events ever measured by astronomers

37
0:02:02.633,000 --> 0:02:04,000
carry the name gamma-ray bursts

38
0:02:04.912,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because we observe them as bursts most or explosions,

39
0:02:08.543,000 --> 0:02:1,000
most strongly measured as gamma-ray light.

40
0:02:11.886,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Our star, like the one in our story that became a magnetar,

41
0:02:16.115,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is detected as a gamma-ray burst

42
0:02:18.21,000 --> 0:02:2,000
during the most energetic portion of the explosion.

43
0:02:22.167,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Yet, even though gamma-ray bursts are the strongest events

44
0:02:27.492,000 --> 0:02:29,000
ever measured by astronomers,

45
0:02:29.605,000 --> 0:02:31,000
we cannot see them with our naked eye.

46
0:02:32.266,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We depend, we rely on other methods

47
0:02:34.618,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in order to study this gamma-ray light.

48
0:02:37.431,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We cannot see them with our naked eye.

49
0:02:39.302,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We can only see an itty bitty, tiny portion

50
0:02:42.396,000 --> 0:02:45,000
of the electromagnetic spectrum that we call visible light.

51
0:02:46.146,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And beyond that, we rely on other methods.

52
0:02:48.442,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Yet as astronomers, we study a wider range of light

53
0:02:53.726,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and we depend on other methods to do that.

54
0:02:56.514,000 --> 0:02:58,000
On the screen, it may look like this.

55
0:02:59.812,000 --> 0:03:,000
You're seeing a plot.

56
0:03:01.568,000 --> 0:03:02,000
That is a light curve.

57
0:03:03.517,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It's a plot of intensity of light over time.

58
0:03:07.09,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It is a gamma-ray light curve.

59
0:03:10.013,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Sighted astronomers depend on this kind of plot

60
0:03:13.729,000 --> 0:03:17,000
in order to interpret how this light intensity changes over time.

61
0:03:18.933,000 --> 0:03:23,000
On the left, you will be seeing the light intensity without a burst,

62
0:03:24.473,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and on the right, you will be seeing the light intensity with the burst.

63
0:03:30.381,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Early during my career, I could also see this kind of plot.

64
0:03:34.562,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But then, I lost my sight.

65
0:03:37.314,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I completely lost my sight because of extended illness,

66
0:03:40.49,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and with it, I lost the opportunity to see this plot

67
0:03:45.208,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and the opportunity to do my physics.

68
0:03:49.672,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It was a very strong transition for me in many ways.

69
0:03:53.295,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And professionally, it left me without a way to do my science.

70
0:03:57.564,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I longed to access and scrutinize this energetic light

71
0:04:02.203,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and figure out the astrophysical cause.

72
0:04:04.913,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I wanted to experience the spacious wonder, the excitement,

73
0:04:08.399,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the joy produced by the detection of such a titanic celestial event.

74
0:04:13.352,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I thought long and hard about it,

75
0:04:16.676,000 --> 0:04:19,000
when I suddenly realized that all a light curve is,

76
0:04:20.385,000 --> 0:04:23,000
is a table of numbers converted into a visual plot.

77
0:04:24.861,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So along with my collaborators,

78
0:04:26.786,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we worked really hard and we translated the numbers into sound.

79
0:04:31.765,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I achieved access to the data,

80
0:04:33.793,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and today I'm able to do physics at the level of the best astronomer,

81
0:04:38.83,000 --> 0:04:39,000
using sound.

82
0:04:40.005,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And what people have been able to do,

83
0:04:42.657,000 --> 0:04:43,000
mainly visually,

84
0:04:43.834,000 --> 0:04:44,000
for hundreds of years,

85
0:04:45.202,000 --> 0:04:47,000
now I do it using sound.

86
0:04:47.892,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Applause)

87
0:04:48.953,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Listening to this gamma-ray burst

88
0:04:50.679,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that you're seeing on the -- (Applause continues)

89
0:04:53.023,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Thank you.

90
0:04:54.198,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Listening to this burst that you're seeing on the screen

91
0:04:56.93,000 --> 0:04:58,000
brought something to the ear beyond the obvious burst.

92
0:04:59.973,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now I'm going to play the burst for you.

93
0:05:01.932,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's not music, it's sound.

94
0:05:05.264,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Digital beeping sounds)

95
0:05:08.539,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This is scientific data converted into sound,

96
0:05:11.854,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and it's mapped in pitch.

97
0:05:13.112,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The process is called sonification.

98
0:05:18.958,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So listening to this brought something to the ear

99
0:05:21.292,000 --> 0:05:22,000
besides the obvious burst.

100
0:05:22.665,000 --> 0:05:26,000
When I examine the very strong low-frequency regions,

101
0:05:27.21,000 --> 0:05:31,000
or bass line -- I'm zooming into the bass line now.

102
0:05:33.5,000 --> 0:05:38,000
We noted resonances characteristic of electrically charged gasses

103
0:05:39.043,000 --> 0:05:4,000
like the solar wind.

104
0:05:40.669,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And I want you to hear what I heard.

105
0:05:43.196,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You will hear it as a very fast decrease in volume.

106
0:05:47.001,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And because you're sighted, I'm giving you a red line

107
0:05:49.788,000 --> 0:05:52,000
indicating what intensity of light is being converted into sound.

108
0:05:55.672,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Digital hum and whistling sound)

109
0:05:58.11,000 --> 0:06:01,000
The (Whistles) is frogs at home, don't pay attention to that.

110
0:06:01.428,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

111
0:06:03.298,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Digital hum and whistling sound)

112
0:06:08.549,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I think you heard it, right?

113
0:06:11.503,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So what we found

114
0:06:12.804,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is that the bursts last long enough in order to support wave resonances,

115
0:06:17.742,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which are things caused by exchanges of energy between particles

116
0:06:21.983,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that may have been excited,

117
0:06:23.325,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that depend on the volume.

118
0:06:25.151,000 --> 0:06:28,000
You may remember that I said that the matter around the star

119
0:06:28.265,000 --> 0:06:29,000
is dragged around?

120
0:06:29.945,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It transmits power with frequency and field distribution

121
0:06:33.783,000 --> 0:06:34,000
determined by the dimensions.

122
0:06:36.434,000 --> 0:06:39,000
You may remember that we were talking about a super-massive star

123
0:06:40.408,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that became a very strong magnetic field magnetar.

124
0:06:44.264,000 --> 0:06:48,000
If this is the case, then outflows from the exploding star

125
0:06:48.661,000 --> 0:06:5,000
may be associated with this gamma-ray burst.

126
0:06:51.168,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What does that mean?

127
0:06:52.76,000 --> 0:06:54,000
That star formation may be a very important part

128
0:06:55.751,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of these supernova explosions.

129
0:06:58.047,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Listening to this very gamma-ray burst brought us to the notion

130
0:07:02.458,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that the use of sound as an adjunctive visual display

131
0:07:05.281,000 --> 0:07:07,000
may also support sighted astronomers

132
0:07:07.53,000 --> 0:07:09,000
in the search for more information in the data.

133
0:07:10.562,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Simultaneously, I worked on analyzing measurements from other telescopes,

134
0:07:15.904,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and my experiments demonstrated

135
0:07:18.131,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that when you use sound as an adjunctive visual display,

136
0:07:22.369,000 --> 0:07:24,000
astronomers can find more information

137
0:07:25.309,000 --> 0:07:27,000
in this now more accessible data set.

138
0:07:29.086,000 --> 0:07:32,000
This ability to transform data into sound

139
0:07:32.854,000 --> 0:07:35,000
gives astronomy a tremendous power of transformation.

140
0:07:36.381,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And the fact that a field that is so visual may be improved

141
0:07:40.346,000 --> 0:07:44,000
in order to include anyone with interest in understanding what lies in the heavens

142
0:07:45.043,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is a spirit-lifter.

143
0:07:47.39,000 --> 0:07:48,000
When I lost my sight,

144
0:07:49.303,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I noticed that I didn't have access

145
0:07:51.403,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to the same amount and quality of information

146
0:07:54.053,000 --> 0:07:55,000
a sighted astronomer had.

147
0:07:56.22,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It was not until we innovated with the sonification process

148
0:07:59.724,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that I regained the hope to be a productive member of the field

149
0:08:03.7,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that I had worked so hard to be part of.

150
0:08:07.429,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Yet, information access is not the only area in astronomy

151
0:08:11.904,000 --> 0:08:13,000
where this is important.

152
0:08:14.602,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The situation is systemic

153
0:08:17.15,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and scientific fields are not keeping up.

154
0:08:20.825,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The body is something changeable --

155
0:08:23.501,000 --> 0:08:26,000
anyone may develop a disability at any point.

156
0:08:26.89,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Let's think about, for example,

157
0:08:29.152,000 --> 0:08:31,000
scientists that are already at the top of their careers.

158
0:08:31.963,000 --> 0:08:33,000
What happens to them if they develop a disability?

159
0:08:34.827,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Will they feel excommunicated as I did?

160
0:08:37.839,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Information access empowers us to flourish.

161
0:08:41.499,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It gives us equal opportunities to display our talents

162
0:08:45.123,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and choose what we want to do with our lives,

163
0:08:48.01,000 --> 0:08:51,000
based on interest and not based on potential barriers.

164
0:08:52.294,000 --> 0:08:56,000
When we give people the opportunity to succeed without limits,

165
0:08:56.685,000 --> 0:09:,000
that will lead to personal fulfillment and prospering life.

166
0:09:01.267,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And I think that the use of sound in astronomy

167
0:09:03.724,000 --> 0:09:06,000
is helping us to achieve that and to contribute to science.

168
0:09:08.119,000 --> 0:09:12,000
While other countries told me that the study of perception techniques

169
0:09:12.675,000 --> 0:09:15,000
in order to study astronomy data is not relevant to astronomy

170
0:09:16.276,000 --> 0:09:19,000
because there are no blind astronomers in the field,

171
0:09:19.5,000 --> 0:09:22,000
South Africa said, "We want people with disabilities

172
0:09:22.928,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to contribute to the field."

173
0:09:24.928,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Right now, I'm working

174
0:09:26.278,000 --> 0:09:28,000
at the South African Astronomical Observatory,

175
0:09:29.034,000 --> 0:09:32,000
at the Office of Astronomy for Development.

176
0:09:32.436,000 --> 0:09:36,000
There, we are working on sonification techniques and analysis methods

177
0:09:37.201,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to impact the students of the Athlone School for the Blind.

178
0:09:41.603,000 --> 0:09:43,000
These students will be learning radio astronomy,

179
0:09:44.113,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and they will be learning the sonification methods

180
0:09:47.375,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in order to study astronomical events like huge ejections of energy

181
0:09:51.87,000 --> 0:09:53,000
from the sun, known as coronal mass ejections.

182
0:09:55.194,000 --> 0:09:56,000
What we learn with these students --

183
0:09:56.977,000 --> 0:09:59,000
these students have multiple disabilities and coping strategies

184
0:10:00.798,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that will be accommodated --

185
0:10:02.698,000 --> 0:10:04,000
what we learn with these students will directly impact

186
0:10:05.561,000 --> 0:10:08,000
the way things are being done at the professional level.

187
0:10:08.742,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I humbly call this development.

188
0:10:10.825,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And this is happening right now.

189
0:10:14.35,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I think that science is for everyone.

190
0:10:18.275,000 --> 0:10:19,000
It belongs to the people,

191
0:10:19.747,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and it has to be available to everyone,

192
0:10:22.022,000 --> 0:10:24,000
because we are all natural explorers.

193
0:10:24.956,000 --> 0:10:29,000
I think that if we limit people with disabilities

194
0:10:30.171,000 --> 0:10:31,000
from participating in science,

195
0:10:32.024,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we'll sever our links with history and with society.

196
0:10:35.696,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I dream of a level scientific playing field,

197
0:10:39.166,000 --> 0:10:43,000
where people encourage respect and respect each other,

198
0:10:44.178,000 --> 0:10:47,000
where people exchange strategies and discover together.

199
0:10:47.81,000 --> 0:10:51,000
If people with disabilities are allowed into the scientific field,

200
0:10:52.131,000 --> 0:10:56,000
an explosion, a huge titanic burst of knowledge will take place,

201
0:10:56.864,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I am sure.

202
0:11:01.251,000 --> 0:11:02,000
(Digital beeping sounds)

203
0:11:03.124,000 --> 0:11:04,000
That is the titanic burst.

204
0:11:06.42,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Thank you.

205
0:11:07.595,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Thank you.

206
0:11:08.77,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Applause)

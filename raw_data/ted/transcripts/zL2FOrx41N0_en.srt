1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I heard this amazing story about Miuccia Prada.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
She's an Italian fashion designer.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
She goes to this vintage store in Paris

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
with a friend of hers.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
She's rooting around, she finds this one jacket by Balenciaga --

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
she loves it.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
She's turning it inside out.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
She's looking at the seams. She's looking at the construction.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Her friend says, "Buy it already."

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
She said, "I'll buy it, but I'm also going to replicate it."

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Now, the academics in this audience may think,

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
"Well, that sounds like plagiarism."

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But to a fashionista, what it really is

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
is a sign of Prada's genius:

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that she can root through the history of fashion

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and pick the one jacket

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that doesn't need to be changed by one iota,

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and to be current and to be now.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
You might also be asking whether it's possible

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that this is illegal for her to do this.

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Well, it turns out that it's actually not illegal.

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In the fashion industry, there's very little

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
intellectual property protection.

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
They have trademark protection,

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but no copyright protection

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and no patent protection to speak of.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
All they have, really, is trademark protection,

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and so it means that anybody

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
could copy any garment

30
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
on any person in this room

31
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and sell it as their own design.

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The only thing that they can't copy

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is the actual trademark label

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
within that piece of apparel.

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
That's one reason that you see logos

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
splattered all over these products.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It's because it's a lot harder for knock-off artists

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to knock off these designs

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
because they can't knock off the logo.

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But if you go to Santee Alley, yeah.

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter) Well, yeah.

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Canal Street, I know.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And sometimes these are fun, right?

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now, the reason for this, the reason that the fashion industry

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
doesn't have any copyright protection

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
is because the courts decided long ago

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that apparel is too utilitarian

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to qualify for copyright protection.

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
They didn't want a handful of designers

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
owning the seminal building blocks of our clothing.

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And then everybody else would have to license this cuff or this sleeve

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because Joe Blow owns it.

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But too utilitarian? I mean is that the way you think of fashion?

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This is Vivienne Westwood. No!

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We think of it as maybe too silly,

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
too unnecessary.

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, those of you who are familiar with the logic

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
behind copyright protection --

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
which is that without ownership, there is no incentive to innovate --

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
might be really surprised

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
by both the critical success of the fashion industry

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and the economic success of this industry.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
What I'm going to argue today is that

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
because there's no copyright protection

65
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in the fashion industry,

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
fashion designers have actually been able to elevate

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
utilitarian design,

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
things to cover our naked bodies,

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
into something that we consider art.

70
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Because there's no copyright protection

71
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in this industry,

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
there's a very open and creative

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
ecology of creativity.

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Unlike their creative brothers and sisters,

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
who are sculptors or photographers

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
or filmmakers or musicians,

77
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
fashion designers can sample

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
from all their peers' designs.

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They can take any element from any garment

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
from the history of fashion

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and incorporate it into their own design.

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They're also notorious for riffing off of the zeitgeist.

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And here, I suspect,

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
they were influenced by the costumes in Avatar.

85
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Maybe just a little.

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Can't copyright a costume either.

87
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Now, fashion designers have

88
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the broadest palette imaginable

89
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in this creative industry.

90
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
This wedding dress here

91
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is actually made of sporks,

92
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and this dress is actually made of aluminum.

93
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I've heard this dress actually sort of sounds like wind chimes

94
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
as they walk through.

95
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So, one of the magical side effects

96
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
of having a culture of copying,

97
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
which is really what it is,

98
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
is the establishment of trends.

99
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
People think this is a magical thing. How does it happen?

100
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Well, it's because it's legal for people to copy one another.

101
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Some people believe that

102
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
there are a few people at the top of the fashion food chain

103
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
who sort of dictate to us what we're all going to wear,

104
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but if you talk to any designer at any level,

105
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
including these high-end designers,

106
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
they always say

107
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
their main inspiration comes from the street:

108
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
where people like you and me remix and match

109
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
our own fashion looks.

110
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And that's where they really get a lot of their

111
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
creative inspiration,

112
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
so it's both a top-down and a bottom-up kind of industry.

113
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now, the fast fashion giants have

114
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
probably benefited the most

115
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
from the lack of copyright protection in the fashion industry.

116
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
They are notorious for knocking off high-end designs

117
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and selling them at very low prices.

118
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And they've been faced with a lot of lawsuits,

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but those lawsuits are usually not won by fashion designers.

120
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
The courts have said over and over again, "You don't need

121
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
any more intellectual property protection."

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
When you look at copies like this,

123
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
you wonder: How do the luxury high-end brands

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
remain in business?

125
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
If you can get it for 200 bucks, why pay a thousand?

126
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Well, that's one reason we had a conference here at USC a few years ago.

127
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
We invited Tom Ford to come --

128
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the conference was called, "Ready to Share:

129
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Fashion and the Ownership of Creativity" --

130
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and we asked him exactly this question.

131
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Here's what he had to say.

132
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
He had just come off a successful stint as the lead designer at Gucci,

133
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
in case you didn't know.

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Tom Ford: And we found after much research

135
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that -- actually not much research, quite simple research --

136
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that the counterfeit customer was not our customer.

137
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Johanna Blakley: Imagine that.

138
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
The people on Santee Alley

139
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
are not the ones who shop at Gucci.

140
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughter)

141
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
This is a very different demographic.

142
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And, you know, a knock-off is never the same

143
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
as an original high-end design,

144
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
at least in terms of the materials; they're always made of cheaper materials.

145
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But even sometimes a cheaper version

146
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
can actually have some charming aspects,

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
can breathe a little extra life into a dying trend.

148
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
There's lots of virtues of copying.

149
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
One that a lot of cultural critics have pointed to

150
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is that we now have

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
a much broader palette

152
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
of design choices to choose from than we ever have before,

153
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and this is mainly because of the fast fashion industry, actually.

154
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And this is a good thing. We need lots of options.

155
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Fashion, whether you like it or not,

156
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
helps you project who you are to the world.

157
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Because of fast fashion,

158
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
global trends actually get established much more quickly than they used to.

159
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And this, actually, is good news to trendsetters;

160
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
they want trends to be set

161
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
so that they can move product.

162
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
For fashionistas,

163
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
they want to stay ahead of the curve.

164
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
They don't want to be wearing what everybody else is wearing.

165
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And so, they want to move on to the next trend

166
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
as soon as possible.

167
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I tell you, there is no rest for the fashionable.

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Every season, these designers have to struggle

169
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to come up with the new fabulous idea that everybody's going to love.

170
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And this, let me tell you,

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
is very good for the bottom line.

172
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now of course, there's a bunch of effects

173
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that this culture of copying has

174
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
on the creative process.

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And Stuart Weitzman is a very successful shoe designer.

176
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
He has complained a lot about people copying him,

177
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but in one interview I read,

178
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
he said it has really forced him to up his game.

179
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
He had to come up with new ideas,

180
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
new things that would be hard to copy.

181
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
He came up with this Bowden-wedge heel

182
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that has to be made out of steel or titanium;

183
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
if you make it from some sort of cheaper material,

184
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
it'll actually crack in two.

185
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It forced him to be a little more innovative. (Music)

186
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And that actually reminded me

187
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
of jazz great, Charlie Parker.

188
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I don't know if you've heard this anecdote, but I have.

189
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
He said that one of the reasons he invented bebop

190
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
was that he was pretty sure

191
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that white musicians wouldn't be able to replicate the sound. (Laughter)

192
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
He wanted to make it too difficult to copy,

193
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and that's what fashion designers are doing all the time.

194
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They're trying to put together

195
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
a signature look, an aesthetic

196
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that reflects who they are.

197
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
When people knock it off, everybody knows

198
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
because they've put that look out on the runway,

199
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and it's a coherent aesthetic.

200
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I love these Gallianos.

201
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Okay, we'll move on. (Laughter)

202
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
This is not unlike the world of comedy.

203
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I don't know if you know that jokes

204
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
also can't be copyright protected.

205
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So when one-liners were really popular,

206
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
everybody stole them from one another.

207
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But now, we have a different kind of comic.

208
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They develop a persona,

209
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
a signature style, much like fashion designers.

210
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And their jokes,

211
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
much like the fashion designs by a fashion designer,

212
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
really only work within that aesthetic.

213
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
If somebody steals a joke

214
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
from Larry David, for instance,

215
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
it's not as funny.

216
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now, the other thing that fashion designers have done

217
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to survive in this culture of copying

218
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is they've learned how to copy themselves.

219
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
They knock themselves off.

220
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
They make deals with the fast fashion giants

221
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and they come up with a way to sell their product

222
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to a whole new demographic:

223
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
the Santee Alley demographic.

224
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now, some fashion designers will say,

225
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
"It's only in the United States that we don't have any respect.

226
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
In other countries there is protection

227
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
for our artful designs."

228
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But if you take a look at the two other biggest markets in the world,

229
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
it turns out that the protection that's offered

230
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
is really ineffectual.

231
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
In Japan, for instance, which I think is the third largest market,

232
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they have a design law; it protects apparel,

233
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but the novelty standard is so high,

234
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
you have to prove that your garment has never existed before,

235
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
it's totally unique.

236
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And that's sort of like

237
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
the novelty standard for a U.S. patent,

238
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
which fashion designers never get --

239
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
rarely get here in the states.

240
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
In the European Union, they went in the other direction.

241
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Very low novelty standard,

242
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
anybody can register anything.

243
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But even though it's the home of the fast fashion industry

244
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and you have a lot of luxury designers there,

245
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
they don't register their garments, generally,

246
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and there's not a lot of litigation.

247
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It turns out it's because the novelty standard is too low.

248
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
A person can come in and take somebody else's gown,

249
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
cut off three inches from the bottom,

250
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
go to the E.U. and register it as a new, original design.

251
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So, that does not stop the knock-off artists.

252
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
If you look at the registry, actually,

253
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
a lot of the registered things in the E.U.

254
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
are Nike T-shirts

255
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that are almost identical to one another.

256
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But this has not stopped Diane von Furstenberg.

257
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
She is the head of

258
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
the Council of Fashion Designers of America,

259
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and she has told her constituency that

260
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
she is going to get copyright protection

261
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
for fashion designs.

262
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The retailers have kind of quashed this notion though.

263
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I don't think the legislation is going anywhere,

264
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
because they realized it is so hard

265
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
to tell the difference between a pirated design

266
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and something that's just part of a global trend.

267
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
Who owns a look?

268
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
That is a very difficult question to answer.

269
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It takes lots of lawyers and lots of court time,

270
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and the retailers decided that would be way too expensive.

271
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
You know, it's not just the fashion industry

272
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that doesn't have copyright protection.

273
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
There's a bunch of other industries that don't have copyright protection,

274
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
including the food industry.

275
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
You cannot copyright a recipe

276
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
because it's a set of instructions, it's fact,

277
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and you cannot copyright the look and feel

278
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
of even the most unique dish.

279
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Same with automobiles.

280
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It doesn't matter how wacky they look or how cool they look,

281
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
you cannot copyright the sculptural design.

282
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
It's a utilitarian article, that's why.

283
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Same with furniture,

284
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
it's too utilitarian.

285
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Magic tricks, I think they're instructions, sort of like recipes:

286
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
no copyright protection.

287
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Hairdos, no copyright protection.

288
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Open source software, these guys decided

289
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
they didn't want copyright protection.

290
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
They thought it'd be more innovative without it.

291
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
It's really hard to get copyright for databases.

292
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Tattoo artists, they don't want it; it's not cool.

293
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
They share their designs.

294
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Jokes, no copyright protection.

295
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Fireworks displays,

296
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the rules of games,

297
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
the smell of perfume: no.

298
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And some of these industries may seem

299
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
sort of marginal to you,

300
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
but these are the gross sales

301
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
for low I.P. industries,

302
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
industries with very little copyright protection,

303
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and there's the gross sales of

304
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
films and books.

305
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Applause)

306
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
It ain't pretty.

307
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Applause)

308
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So you talk to people in the fashion industry

309
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and they're like, "Shhh!

310
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Don't tell anybody

311
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
we can actually steal from each other's designs.

312
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
It's embarrassing."

313
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
But you know what? It's revolutionary,

314
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and it's a model that a lot of other industries --

315
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
like the ones we just saw with the really small bars --

316
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
they might have to think about this.

317
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Because right now, those industries with a lot of copyright protection

318
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
are operating in an atmosphere

319
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
where it's as if they don't have any protection,

320
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and they don't know what to do.

321
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
When I found out that there are a whole bunch of industries

322
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that didn't have copyright protection,

323
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
I thought, "What exactly is the underlying logic?

324
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
I want a picture." And the lawyers do not provide a picture,

325
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
so I made one.

326
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
These are the two main

327
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
sort of binary oppositions within the logic of copyright law.

328
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
It is more complex than this, but this will do.

329
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
First: Is something an artistic object?

330
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Then it deserves protection.

331
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Is it a utilitarian object?

332
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Then no, it does not deserve protection.

333
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
This is a difficult, unstable binary.

334
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
The other one is: Is it an idea?

335
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Is it something that needs to

336
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
freely circulate in a free society?

337
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
No protection.

338
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Or is it a physically fixed

339
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
expression of an idea:

340
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
something that somebody made

341
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and they deserve to own it for a while and make money from it?

342
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
The problem is that digital technology

343
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
has completely subverted the logic

344
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
of this physically fixed, expression

345
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
versus idea concept.

346
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Nowadays,

347
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
we don't really recognize a book

348
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
as something that sits on our shelf

349
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
or music as something that is

350
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
a physical object that we can hold.

351
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
It's a digital file.

352
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
It is barely tethered to any sort of

353
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
physical reality in our minds.

354
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And these things, because we can copy and transmit them so easily,

355
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
actually circulate within our culture

356
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
a lot more like ideas

357
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
than like physically instantiated objects.

358
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Now, the conceptual issues are truly profound

359
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
when you talk about creativity

360
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and ownership

361
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and, let me tell you, we don't want to leave this just to lawyers to figure out.

362
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
They're smart.

363
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I'm with one. He's my boyfriend, he's okay.

364
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
He's smart, he's smart.

365
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
But you want an interdisciplinary team of people

366
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
hashing this out,

367
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
trying to figure out: What is the kind of ownership model,

368
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
in a digital world,

369
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
that's going to lead to the most innovation?

370
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And my suggestion is that

371
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
fashion might be a really good place

372
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
to start looking for a model

373
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
for creative industries in the future.

374
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000

And I really want to thank Veronica Jauriqui

377
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
for making this very fashionable presentation.

378
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Thank you so much. (Applause)

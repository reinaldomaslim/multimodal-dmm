1
0:00:12.552,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Dre Urhahn: This theater is built on Copacabana,

2
0:00:15.38,000 --> 0:00:18,000
which is the most famous beach in the world,

3
0:00:18.483,000 --> 0:00:19,000
but 25 kilometers away from here

4
0:00:20.281,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in the North Zone of Rio

5
0:00:22.297,000 --> 0:00:25,000
lies a community called Vila Cruzeiro,

6
0:00:25.359,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and roughly 60,000 people live there.

7
0:00:28.419,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now, the people here in Rio mostly know

8
0:00:30.522,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Vila Cruzeiro from the news,

9
0:00:32.397,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and unfortunately, news from Vila Cruzeiro often

10
0:00:36.034,000 --> 0:00:38,000
is not good news.

11
0:00:38.466,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But Vila Cruzeiro is also the place

12
0:00:41.367,000 --> 0:00:43,000
where our story begins.

13
0:00:43.392,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Jeroen Koolhaas: Ten years ago, we first came to Rio

14
0:00:46.165,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to shoot a documentary about life in the favelas.

15
0:00:49.792,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now, we learned that favelas are informal communities.

16
0:00:52.694,000 --> 0:00:53,000
They emerged over the years

17
0:00:53.911,000 --> 0:00:54,000
when immigrants from the countryside

18
0:00:55.771,000 --> 0:00:57,000
came to the cities looking for work,

19
0:00:57.783,000 --> 0:00:59,000
like cities within the cities,

20
0:01:00.029,000 --> 0:01:02,000
known for problems like crime, poverty,

21
0:01:02.595,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and the violent drug war between

22
0:01:04.356,000 --> 0:01:05,000
police and the drug gangs.

23
0:01:05.768,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So what struck us was that

24
0:01:09.013,000 --> 0:01:1,000
these were communities that the people

25
0:01:10.57,000 --> 0:01:12,000
who lived there had built with their own hands,

26
0:01:13.05,000 --> 0:01:14,000
without a master plan

27
0:01:14.6,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and like a giant work in progress.

28
0:01:17.5,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Where we're from, in Holland,

29
0:01:19.374,000 --> 0:01:21,000
everything is planned.

30
0:01:21.457,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We even have rules for how to follow the rules.

31
0:01:24.121,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:25.677,000 --> 0:01:27,000
DU: So the last day of filming, we ended up

33
0:01:27.795,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in Vila Cruzeiro, and we were sitting down

34
0:01:29.944,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and we had a drink,

35
0:01:31.332,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and we were overlooking this hill

36
0:01:33.007,000 --> 0:01:34,000
with all these houses,

37
0:01:34.617,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and most of these houses looked unfinished,

38
0:01:36.952,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and they had walls of bare brick,

39
0:01:38.382,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but we saw some of these houses

40
0:01:40.132,000 --> 0:01:41,000
which were plastered and painted,

41
0:01:42.074,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and suddenly we had this idea:

42
0:01:43.77,000 --> 0:01:45,000
what would it look like if all these houses

43
0:01:46.45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
would be plastered and painted?

44
0:01:48.625,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And then we imagined one big design,

45
0:01:51.667,000 --> 0:01:54,000
one big work of art.

46
0:01:54.767,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Who would expect something like that

47
0:01:56.423,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in a place like this?

48
0:01:58.289,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So we thought, would that even be possible?

49
0:02:01.452,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So first we started to count the houses,

50
0:02:04.14,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but we soon lost count.

51
0:02:06.038,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But somehow the idea stuck.

52
0:02:09.234,000 --> 0:02:1,000
JK: We had a friend.

53
0:02:10.909,000 --> 0:02:12,000
He ran an NGO in Vila Cruzeiro.

54
0:02:13.52,000 --> 0:02:14,000
His name was Nanko,

55
0:02:14.805,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and he also liked the idea.

56
0:02:16.866,000 --> 0:02:17,000
He said, "You know, everybody here

57
0:02:18.538,000 --> 0:02:19,000
would pretty much love to have their houses

58
0:02:20.411,000 --> 0:02:21,000
plastered and painted.

59
0:02:21.862,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's when a house is finished."

60
0:02:24.097,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So he introduced us to the right people,

61
0:02:26.066,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and Vitor and Maurinho became our crew.

62
0:02:29.097,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We picked three houses in the center of the community

63
0:02:32.014,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and we start here. We made a few designs,

64
0:02:34.494,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and everybody liked this design

65
0:02:36.114,000 --> 0:02:38,000
of a boy flying a kite the best.

66
0:02:38.527,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So we started painting, and the first thing we did

67
0:02:40.668,000 --> 0:02:42,000
was to paint everything blue,

68
0:02:43.059,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and we thought that looked already pretty good.

69
0:02:45.65,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But they hated it. The people who lived there really hated it.

70
0:02:48.181,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They said, "What did you do?

71
0:02:49.824,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You painted our house in exactly the same color

72
0:02:51.713,000 --> 0:02:52,000
as the police station."

73
0:02:53.513,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

74
0:02:55.426,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In a favela, that is not a good thing.

75
0:02:57.652,000 --> 0:03:,000
Also the same color as the prison cell.

76
0:03:01.477,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So we quickly went ahead and we painted the boy,

77
0:03:04.931,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and then we thought we were finished,

78
0:03:06.139,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we were really happy, but still,

79
0:03:08.676,000 --> 0:03:1,000
it wasn't good because the little kids started coming up to us,

80
0:03:11.069,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and they said, "You know, there's a boy flying the kite,

81
0:03:13.131,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but where is his kite?"

82
0:03:15.178,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We said, "Uh, it's art.

83
0:03:17.293,000 --> 0:03:19,000
You know, you have to imagine the kite."

84
0:03:19.81,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Laughter)

85
0:03:20.862,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And they said, "No, no, no, we want to see the kite."

86
0:03:24.526,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So we quickly installed a kite

87
0:03:26.423,000 --> 0:03:27,000
way up high on the hill,

88
0:03:27.788,000 --> 0:03:29,000
so that you could see the boy flying the kite

89
0:03:29.92,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and you could actually see a kite.

90
0:03:32.333,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So the local news started writing about it,

91
0:03:34.188,000 --> 0:03:35,000
which was great,

92
0:03:35.501,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and then even The Guardian wrote about it:

93
0:03:37.088,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"Notorious slum becomes open-air gallery."

94
0:03:41.264,000 --> 0:03:43,000
JK: So, encouraged by this success,

95
0:03:44.182,000 --> 0:03:47,000
we went back to Rio for a second project,

96
0:03:47.71,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and we stumbled upon this street.

97
0:03:50.336,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It was covered in concrete to prevent mudslides,

98
0:03:53.609,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and somehow we saw a sort of river in it,

99
0:03:56.96,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and we imagined this river to be a river in Japanese style

100
0:04:00.444,000 --> 0:04:02,000
with koi carp swimming upstream.

101
0:04:03.19,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So we decided to paint that river,

102
0:04:05.291,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and we invited Rob Admiraal,

103
0:04:07.913,000 --> 0:04:08,000
who is a tattoo artist,

104
0:04:09.313,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and he specialized in the Japanese style.

105
0:04:12.333,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So little did we know that we would spend

106
0:04:14.02,000 --> 0:04:17,000
almost an entire year painting that river,

107
0:04:17.455,000 --> 0:04:2,000
together with Geovani and Robinho and Vitor,

108
0:04:21.175,000 --> 0:04:23,000
who lived nearby.

109
0:04:23.301,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And we even moved into the neighborhood

110
0:04:25.371,000 --> 0:04:28,000
when one of the guys that lived on the street, Elias,

111
0:04:28.734,000 --> 0:04:3,000
told us that we could come and live in his house,

112
0:04:31.659,000 --> 0:04:32,000
together with his family,

113
0:04:33.007,000 --> 0:04:34,000
which was fantastic.

114
0:04:34.477,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Unfortunately, during that time,

115
0:04:35.805,000 --> 0:04:37,000
another war broke out between the police

116
0:04:38.086,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and the drug gangs.

117
0:04:39.861,000 --> 0:04:43,000
(Video) (Gunfire)

118
0:04:54.218,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We learned that during those times,

119
0:04:57.124,000 --> 0:04:59,000
people in communities really stick together

120
0:04:59.494,000 --> 0:05:,000
during these times of hardship,

121
0:05:01.282,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but we also learned a very important element,

122
0:05:03.892,000 --> 0:05:06,000
the importance of barbecues. (Laughter)

123
0:05:07.199,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Because, when you throw a barbecue,

124
0:05:08.92,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it turns you from a guest into a host,

125
0:05:11.361,000 --> 0:05:12,000
so we decided to throw one

126
0:05:12.574,000 --> 0:05:13,000
almost every other week,

127
0:05:13.797,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and we got to know everybody in the neighborhood.

128
0:05:16.806,000 --> 0:05:18,000
JK: We still had this idea of the hill, though.

129
0:05:18.831,000 --> 0:05:19,000
DU: Yeah, yeah, we were talking about

130
0:05:20.191,000 --> 0:05:21,000
the scale of this, because this painting

131
0:05:22.137,000 --> 0:05:24,000
was incredibly big,

132
0:05:24.398,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and it was insanely detailed,

133
0:05:26.546,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and this process almost drove us completely insane ourselves.

134
0:05:32.285,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But we figured that maybe, during this process,

135
0:05:35.48,000 --> 0:05:37,000
all the time that we had spent in the neighborhood

136
0:05:37.651,000 --> 0:05:38,000
was maybe actually even more important

137
0:05:39.225,000 --> 0:05:41,000
than the painting itself.

138
0:05:41.926,000 --> 0:05:42,000
JK: So after all that time,

139
0:05:43.444,000 --> 0:05:45,000
this hill, this idea was still there,

140
0:05:45.873,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and we started to make sketches,

141
0:05:48.258,000 --> 0:05:51,000
models, and we figured something out.

142
0:05:51.442,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We figured that our ideas, our designs

143
0:05:53.545,000 --> 0:05:56,000
had to be a little bit more simple than that last project

144
0:05:57.314,000 --> 0:05:59,000
so that we could paint with more people

145
0:05:59.458,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and cover more houses at the same time.

146
0:06:03.114,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And we had an opportunity to try that out

147
0:06:05.47,000 --> 0:06:07,000
in a community in the central part of Rio,

148
0:06:08.04,000 --> 0:06:09,000
which is called Santa Marta,

149
0:06:09.788,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and we made a design for this place

150
0:06:11.971,000 --> 0:06:12,000
which looked like this,

151
0:06:13.362,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and then we got people to go along with it

152
0:06:14.907,000 --> 0:06:18,000
because turns out that if your idea is ridiculously big,

153
0:06:18.93,000 --> 0:06:21,000
it's easier to get people to go along with this. (Laughter)

154
0:06:22.5,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And the people of Santa Marta

155
0:06:25.468,000 --> 0:06:27,000
got together and in a little over a month

156
0:06:28.216,000 --> 0:06:3,000
they turned that square into this.

157
0:06:30.589,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Applause)

158
0:06:37.676,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And this image somehow went all over the world.

159
0:06:40.87,000 --> 0:06:43,000
DU: So then we received an unexpected phone call

160
0:06:44.638,000 --> 0:06:47,000
from the Philadelphia Mural Arts Program,

161
0:06:48.305,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and they had this question

162
0:06:49.88,000 --> 0:06:5,000
if this idea, our approach,

163
0:06:51.781,000 --> 0:06:53,000
if this would actually work in North Philly,

164
0:06:54.695,000 --> 0:06:56,000
which is one of the poorest neighborhoods

165
0:06:57.126,000 --> 0:06:58,000
in the United States.

166
0:06:58.778,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So we immediately said yes.

167
0:07:01.838,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We had no idea how,

168
0:07:03.748,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but it seemed like a very interesting challenge,

169
0:07:06.169,000 --> 0:07:08,000
so we did exactly the same as we did in Rio,

170
0:07:08.43,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and we moved into the neighborhood

171
0:07:10.101,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and started barbecuing.

172
0:07:12.243,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

173
0:07:17.102,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So the project took almost two years to complete,

174
0:07:20.871,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and we made individual designs

175
0:07:22.761,000 --> 0:07:24,000
for every single house on the avenue that we painted,

176
0:07:25.304,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and we made these designs together

177
0:07:26.908,000 --> 0:07:28,000
with the local store owners, the building owners,

178
0:07:29.521,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and a team of about a dozen young men and women.

179
0:07:34.459,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They were hired, and then they were trained as painters,

180
0:07:37.958,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and together they transformed their own neighborhood,

181
0:07:41.523,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the whole street, into a giant patchwork of color.

182
0:07:46.34,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Applause)

183
0:07:52.142,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And at the end, the city of Philadelphia

184
0:07:55.765,000 --> 0:07:57,000
thanked every single one of them

185
0:07:57.778,000 --> 0:08:,000
and gave them a merit for their accomplishment.

186
0:08:01.094,000 --> 0:08:04,000
JK: So now we had painted a whole street.

187
0:08:04.246,000 --> 0:08:07,000
How about we do this whole hill now?

188
0:08:07.801,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We started looking for funding,

189
0:08:09.679,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but instead, we just ran into questions,

190
0:08:12.92,000 --> 0:08:15,000
like, how many houses are you going to paint?

191
0:08:16.339,000 --> 0:08:18,000
How many square meters is that?

192
0:08:18.495,000 --> 0:08:2,000
How much paint are you going to use,

193
0:08:20.546,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and how many people are you going to employ?

194
0:08:23.189,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And we did try for years to write plans

195
0:08:25.9,000 --> 0:08:28,000
for the funding and answer all those questions,

196
0:08:29.219,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but then we thought,

197
0:08:30.759,000 --> 0:08:31,000
in order to answer all those questions,

198
0:08:32.672,000 --> 0:08:34,000
you have to know exactly what you're going to do

199
0:08:35.259,000 --> 0:08:38,000
before you actually get there and start.

200
0:08:38.443,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And maybe it's a mistake to think like that.

201
0:08:41.694,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It would lose some of the magic that we had learned

202
0:08:44.222,000 --> 0:08:45,000
about that if you go somewhere

203
0:08:45.848,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and you spend time there,

204
0:08:48.263,000 --> 0:08:49,000
you can let the project grow organically

205
0:08:50.231,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and have a life of its own.

206
0:08:53.719,000 --> 0:08:55,000
DU: So what we did is

207
0:08:55.931,000 --> 0:08:58,000
we decided to take this plan and strip it away

208
0:08:59.14,000 --> 0:09:,000
from all the numbers

209
0:09:01.03,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and all the ideas and presumptions

210
0:09:02.999,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and just go back to the base idea,

211
0:09:05.362,000 --> 0:09:07,000
which was to transform this hill

212
0:09:07.364,000 --> 0:09:09,000
into a giant work of art.

213
0:09:09.805,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And instead of looking for funding,

214
0:09:12.207,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we started a crowdfunding campaign,

215
0:09:15.097,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and in a little over a month,

216
0:09:16.68,000 --> 0:09:18,000
more than 1,500 people put together

217
0:09:18.852,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and donated over 100,000 dollars.

218
0:09:22.127,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So for us, this was an amazing moment, because now —

219
0:09:25.73,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Applause) —

220
0:09:29.246,000 --> 0:09:32,000
because now we finally had the freedom

221
0:09:32.295,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to use all the lessons that we had learned

222
0:09:34.466,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and create a project that was built

223
0:09:37.562,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the same way that the favela was built,

224
0:09:39.474,000 --> 0:09:4,000
from the ground on up, bottom up,

225
0:09:41.128,000 --> 0:09:43,000
with no master plan.

226
0:09:43.703,000 --> 0:09:46,000
JK: So we went back, and we employed Angelo,

227
0:09:46.8,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and he's a local artist from Vila Cruzeiro,

228
0:09:48.722,000 --> 0:09:5,000
very talented guy, and he knows almost everybody there,

229
0:09:51.518,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and then we employed Elias, our former landlord

230
0:09:53.94,000 --> 0:09:54,000
who invited us into his house,

231
0:09:55.537,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and he's a master of construction.

232
0:09:57.551,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Together with them, we decided where to start.

233
0:09:59.992,000 --> 0:10:,000
We picked this spot in Vila Cruzeiro,

234
0:10:01.678,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and houses are being plastered as we speak.

235
0:10:04.491,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And the good thing about them is that

236
0:10:06.071,000 --> 0:10:07,000
they are deciding which houses go next.

237
0:10:08.066,000 --> 0:10:09,000
They're even printing t-shirts,

238
0:10:09.752,000 --> 0:10:1,000
they're putting up banners

239
0:10:11.318,000 --> 0:10:12,000
explaining everything to everybody,

240
0:10:13.302,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and talking to the press.

241
0:10:15.143,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This article about Angelo appeared.

242
0:10:17.61,000 --> 0:10:18,000
DU: So while this is happening,

243
0:10:18.788,000 --> 0:10:2,000
we are bringing this idea all over the world.

244
0:10:20.973,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So, like the project we did in Philadelphia,

245
0:10:24.29,000 --> 0:10:26,000
we are also invited to do workshops,

246
0:10:26.438,000 --> 0:10:27,000
for instance in Curaçao,

247
0:10:28.35,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and right now we're planning a huge project in Haiti.

248
0:10:32.456,000 --> 0:10:34,000
JK: So the favela was not only the place

249
0:10:35.2,000 --> 0:10:36,000
where this idea started:

250
0:10:36.787,000 --> 0:10:39,000
it was also the place that made it possible

251
0:10:40.342,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to work without a master plan,

252
0:10:43.468,000 --> 0:10:45,000
because these communities are informal —

253
0:10:45.538,000 --> 0:10:46,000
this was the inspiration —

254
0:10:46.977,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and in a communal effort, together with the people,

255
0:10:49.577,000 --> 0:10:5,000
you can almost work like in an orchestra,

256
0:10:51.488,000 --> 0:10:52,000
where you can have a hundred instruments

257
0:10:53.062,000 --> 0:10:55,000
playing together to create a symphony.

258
0:10:55.415,000 --> 0:10:56,000
DU: So we want to thank everybody who

259
0:10:57.372,000 --> 0:10:58,000
wanted to become part of this dream

260
0:10:58.99,000 --> 0:11:,000
and supported us along the way,

261
0:11:01.174,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and we are looking at continuing.

262
0:11:03.885,000 --> 0:11:04,000
JK: Yeah. And so one day pretty soon,

263
0:11:05.696,000 --> 0:11:07,000
when the colors start going up on these walls,

264
0:11:08.205,000 --> 0:11:09,000
we hope more people will join us,

265
0:11:10.184,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and join this big dream,

266
0:11:12.997,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and maybe one day, the whole of Vila Cruzeiro

267
0:11:15.617,000 --> 0:11:16,000
will be painted.

268
0:11:17.372,000 --> 0:11:18,000
DU: Thank you.

269
0:11:19.284,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Applause)

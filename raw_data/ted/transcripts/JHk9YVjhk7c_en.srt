1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I bring to you

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a message from

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
tens of thousands of people --

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
in the villages, in the slums,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in the hinterland of the country --

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
who have solved problems

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
through their own genius,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
without any

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
outside help.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
When our home minister announces

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
a few weeks ago

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
a war on

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
one third of India,

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
about 200 districts that he mentioned

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
were ungovernable,

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
he missed the point.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The point that we have been stressing

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
for the last 21 years,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the point that

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
people may be economically poor,

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but they're not poor in the mind.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
In other words,

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the minds on the margin

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
are not the marginal minds.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
That is the message,

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
which we started 31 years ago.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And what did it start?

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Let me just tell you, briefly, my personal journey,

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
which led me to come to this point.

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
In '85, '86, I was in Bangladesh

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
advising the government and the research council there

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
how to help scientists work on the lands,

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
on the fields of the poor people,

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and how to develop research technologies,

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
which are based on the knowledge of the people.

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I came back in '86.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I had been tremendously invigorated

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
by the knowledge and creativity that I found in that country,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which had 60 percent landlessness

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but amazing creativity.

41
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I started looking at my own work:

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The work that I had done

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
for the previous 10 years,

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
almost every time,

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
had instances of knowledge

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that people had shared.

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Now, I was paid in dollars as a consultant,

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and I looked at my income tax return

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and tried to ask myself: "Is there a line in my return,

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
which shows how much of this income has gone

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to the people whose knowledge

52
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
has made it possible?

53
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Was it because I'm brilliant

54
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that I'm getting this reward, or because of the revolution?

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Is it that I write very well?

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Is it that I articulate very well?

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Is it that I analyze the data very well?

58
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Is it because I'm a professor, and, therefore,

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I must be entitled to this reward from society?"

60
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I tried to convince myself that, "No, no,

61
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I have worked for the policy changes.

62
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
You know, the public policy will become

63
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
more responsive to the needs of the poor,

64
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and, therefore I think it's okay."

65
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But it appeared to me

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that all these years that I'd been working on exploitation --

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
exploitation by landlords,

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
by moneylenders, by traders --

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
gave me an insight that

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
probably I was also an exploiter,

71
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
because there was no line in my income tax return

72
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which showed this income accrued

73
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because of the brilliance of the people --

74
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
those people who have shared their knowledge and good faith and trust with me --

75
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and nothing ever went back to them.

76
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So much so, that much of my work till that time

77
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
was in the English language.

78
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
The majority of the people from whom I learned didn't know English.

79
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So what kind of a contributor was I?

80
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I was talking about social justice,

81
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and here I was, a professional

82
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
who was pursuing the most unjust act --

83
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
of taking knowledge from the people, making them anonymous,

84
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
getting rent from that knowledge

85
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
by sharing it and doing consultancy, writing papers and

86
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
publishing them in the papers,

87
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
getting invited to the conferences,

88
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
getting consultancies and whatever have you.

89
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So then, a dilemma rose in the mind that,

90
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
if I'm also an exploiter, then this is not right;

91
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
life cannot go on like that.

92
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And this was a moment of great pain and trauma

93
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
because I couldn't live with it any longer.

94
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So I did a review of

95
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
ethical dilemma and value conflicts and management research,

96
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
wrote, read about 100 papers.

97
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And I came to the conclusion that

98
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
while dilemma is unique,

99
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
dilemma is not unique; the solution had to be unique.

100
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And one day -- I don't know what happened --

101
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
while coming back from the office towards home,

102
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
maybe I saw a honey bee

103
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
or it occurred to my mind that if I only could be like the honey bee,

104
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
life would be wonderful.

105
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
What the honey bee does: it pollinates,

106
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
takes nectar from the flower,

107
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
pollinates another flower, cross-pollinates.

108
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And when it takes the nectar,

109
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the flowers don't feel shortchanged.

110
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
In fact, they invite the honey bees

111
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
through their colors,

112
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and the bees don't keep all the honey for themselves.

113
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
These are the three guiding principles of the Honey Bee Network:

114
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that whenever we learn something from people

115
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
it must be shared with them in their language.

116
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
They must not remain anonymous.

117
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I must tell you that after 20 years,

118
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I have not made one percent of change

119
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
in the professional practice of this art.

120
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
That is a great tragedy -- which I'm carrying still with me

121
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and I hope that all of you will carry this with you --

122
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that the profession still legitimizes publication

123
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
of knowledge of people without attributing them

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
by making them anonymous.

125
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The research guidelines of U.S. National Academy of Sciences

126
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
or Research Councils of the U.K.

127
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
or of Indian Councils of Science Research

128
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
do not require

129
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that whatever you learn from people, you must share back with them.

130
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We are talking about an accountable society,

131
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
a society that is fair and just,

132
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and we don't even do justice in the knowledge market.

133
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And India wants to be a knowledge society.

134
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
How will it be a knowledge society?

135
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So, obviously, you cannot have two principles of justice,

136
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
one for yourself and one for others.

137
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It must be the same.

138
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
You cannot discriminate.

139
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You cannot be in favor of your own values,

140
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
which are at a distance from

141
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
the values that you espouse.

142
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So, fairness to one and to the other

143
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
is not divisible.

144
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Look at this picture.

145
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Can you tell me where has it been taken from,

146
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and what is it meant for? Anybody?

147
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I'm a professor; I must quiz you. (Laughter)

148
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Anybody? Any guess at all?

149
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Pardon? (Audience Member: Rajasthan.)

150
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Anil Gupta: But what has it been used for? What has it been used for?

151
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Murmuring)

152
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Pardon?

153
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You know, you're so right. We must give him a hand,

154
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
because this man knows how insensitive our government is.

155
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Look at this. This is the site of the government of India.

156
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It invites tourists

157
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
to see the shame of our country.

158
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I'm so sorry to say that.

159
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Is this a beautiful picture

160
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
or is it a terrible picture?

161
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It depends upon how you look at the life of the people.

162
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
If this woman has to carry water on her head

163
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
for miles and miles and miles,

164
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
you cannot be celebrating that.

165
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We should be doing something about it.

166
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And let me tell you, with all the science and technology at our command,

167
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
millions of women still carry water on their heads.

168
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And we do not ask this question.

169
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You must have taken tea in the morning.

170
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Think for a minute.

171
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The leaves of the tea, plucked from the bushes;

172
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
you know what the action is? The action is:

173
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The lady picks up a few leaves, puts them in the basket on the backside.

174
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Just do it 10 times;

175
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
you will realize the pain in this shoulder.

176
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And she does it a few thousand times

177
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
every day.

178
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The rice that you ate in the lunch, and you will eat today,

179
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is transplanted by women

180
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
bending in a very awkward posture,

181
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
millions of them,

182
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
every season, in the paddy season,

183
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
when they transplant paddy

184
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
with their feet in the water.

185
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And feet in the water will develop fungus,

186
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
infections,

187
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and that infection pains

188
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
because then other insects bite that point.

189
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And every year,

190
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
99.9 percent of the paddy is transplanted manually.

191
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
No machines have been developed.

192
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So the silence of scientists,

193
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
of technologists, of public policy makers,

194
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
of the change agent, drew our attention that this is not on, this is not on;

195
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
this is not the way society will work.

196
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
This is not what our parliament would do. You know,

197
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
we have a program for employment:

198
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
One hundred, 250 million people

199
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
have to be given jobs for 100 days by this great country.

200
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Doing what? Breaking stones, digging earth.

201
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So we asked a question to the parliament:

202
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Do poor have heads?

203
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Do poor have legs, mouth and hands, but no head?

204
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So Honey Bee Network builds upon the resource in which poor people are rich.

205
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And what has happened?

206
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
An anonymous, faceless, nameless person

207
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
gets in contact with the network,

208
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and then gets an identity.

209
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
This is what Honey Bee Network is about.

210
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And this network grew voluntarily,

211
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
continues to be voluntary,

212
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and has tried to map the minds

213
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
of millions of people

214
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
of our country and other parts of the world who are creative.

215
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
They could be creative in terms of education,

216
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
they may be creative in terms of culture,

217
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
they may be creative in terms of institutions;

218
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but a lot of our work is in the field of technological creativity,

219
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the innovations,

220
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
either in terms of contemporary innovations,

221
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
or in terms of traditional knowledge.

222
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And it all begins with curiosity.

223
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
It all begins with curiosity.

224
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This person, whom we met -- and you will see it on the website,

225
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
www.sristi.org -- this tribal person,

226
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
he had a wish.

227
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And he said, "If my wish gets fulfilled" --

228
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
somebody was sick and he had to monitor --

229
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
"God, please cure him.

230
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And if you cure him, I will get my wall painted."

231
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And this is what he got painted.

232
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Somebody was talking yesterday about Maslowian hierarchy.

233
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
There could be nothing more wrong than

234
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
the Maslowian model of hierarchy of needs

235
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
because the poorest people in this country can get enlightenment.

236
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Kabir, Rahim, all the great Sufi saints,

237
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
they were all poor people,

238
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and they had a great reason. (Applause)

239
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Please do not ever think that

240
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
only after meeting your physiological needs and other needs

241
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
can you be thinking about your spiritual needs or your enlightenment.

242
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Any person anywhere is capable

243
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
of rising to that highest point of attainment,

244
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
only by the resolve that they have in their mind that they must achieve something.

245
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Look at this.

246
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
We saw it in Shodh Yatra. Every six months we walk

247
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in different parts of the country.

248
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I've walked about 4,000 kilometers in the last 12 years.

249
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So on the wayside

250
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
we found these dung cakes,

251
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
which are used as a fuel.

252
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Now, this lady, on the wall of the dung cake heap,

253
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
has made a painting.

254
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
That's the only space she could express her creativity.

255
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And she's so marvelous.

256
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Look at this lady, Ram Timari Devi,

257
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
on a grain bin. In Champaran, we had a Shodh Yatra

258
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and we were walking

259
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
in the land where Gandhiji went

260
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to hear about the tragedy, pain

261
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
of indigo growers.

262
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Bhabi Mahato in Purulia and Bankura.

263
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Look at what she has done.

264
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
The whole wall is her canvas. She's sitting there with a broom.

265
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Is she an artisan or an artist?

266
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Obviously she's an artist; she's a creative person.

267
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
If we can create markets for these artists,

268
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
we will not have to employ them for digging earth and breaking stones.

269
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
They will be paid for what they are good at, not what they're bad at.

270
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Applause)

271
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Look at what Rojadeen has done.

272
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
In Motihari in Champaran,

273
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
there are a lot of people who sell tea on the shack

274
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
and, obviously, there's a limited market for tea.

275
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Every morning you have tea, as well as coffee.

276
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So he thought, why don't I convert

277
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
a pressure cooker into a coffee machine?

278
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So this is a coffee machine. Just takes a few hundred rupees.

279
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
People bring their own cooker,

280
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
he attaches a valve and a steam pipe,

281
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and now he gives you espresso coffee. (Laughter)

282
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Now, this is a real, affordable

283
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
coffee percolator that works on gas.

284
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Applause)

285
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Look at what Sheikh Jahangir has done.

286
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
A lot of poor people do not have

287
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
enough grains to get ground.

288
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So this fellow is bringing

289
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
a flour-grinding machine on a two-wheeler.

290
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
If you have 500 grams, 1000, one kilogram,

291
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
he will grind it for it for you; the flourmill will not grind such a small quantity.

292
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Please understand the problem of poor people.

293
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
They have needs which

294
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
have to be met efficiently

295
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
in terms of energy, in terms of cost, in terms of quality.

296
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
They don't want second-standard, second-quality outputs.

297
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
But to be able to give them high-quality output

298
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
you need to adapt technology to their needs.

299
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And that is what Sheikh Jahangir did.

300
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But that's not enough, what he did. Look at what he did here.

301
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
If you have clothes, and you don't have enough time to wash them,

302
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
he brought a washing machine

303
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
to your doorstep, mounted on a two-wheeler.

304
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So here's a model where

305
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
a two-wheeler washing machine ...

306
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
He is washing your clothes and drying them at your doorstep.

307
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
(Applause)

308
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
You bring your water, you bring your soap,

309
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I wash the clothes for you. Charge 50 paisa, one rupee

310
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
for you per lot,

311
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and a new business model can emerge.

312
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Now, what we need is, we need

313
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
people who will be able to scale them up.

314
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Look at this.

315
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
It looks like a beautiful photograph.

316
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But you know what it is? Can anybody guess what it is?

317
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Somebody from India would know, of course.

318
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It's a tawa.

319
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
It's a hot plate made of clay.

320
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Now, what is the beauty in it?

321
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
When you have a non-stick pan,

322
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
it costs about,

323
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
maybe, 250 rupees,

324
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
five dollars, six dollars.

325
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
This is less than a dollar

326
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and this is non-stick;

327
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
it is coated with one of these

328
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
food-grade materials.

329
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And the best part is that,

330
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
while you use a costly non-stick pan,

331
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
you eat the so-called Teflon

332
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
or Teflon-like material

333
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
because after some time the stuff disappears. Where has it gone?

334
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
It has gone in your stomach. It was not meant for that. (Laughter)

335
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
You know? But here

336
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
in this clay hot plate,

337
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
it will never go into your stomach.

338
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So it is better, it is safer;

339
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
it is affordable, it is energy-efficient.

340
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
In other words, solutions by the poor people need not be cheaper,

341
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
need not be, so-called, jugaad, need not be some kind of makeshift arrangement.

342
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
They have to be better, they have to be more efficient,

343
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
they have to be affordable.

344
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And that is what Mansukh Bhai Prajapati has done.

345
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
He has designed this plate with a handle.

346
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And now with one dollar,

347
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
you can afford a better alternative

348
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
than the people market is offering you.

349
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
This lady, she developed

350
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
a herbal pesticide formulation.

351
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We filed the patent for her,

352
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the National Innovation Foundation.

353
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And who knows? Somebody will license this technology

354
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and develop marketable products,

355
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and she would get revenue.

356
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Now, let me mention one thing:

357
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I think we need a polycentric model of development,

358
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
where a large number of initiatives in different parts of the country,

359
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
in different parts of the world,

360
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
would solve the needs of locality

361
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
in a very efficient and adaptive manner.

362
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Higher the local fit,

363
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
greater is the chance of scaling up.

364
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
In the scaling up,

365
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
there's an inherent inadequacy

366
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to match the needs of the local people,

367
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
point by point, with the supply that you're making.

368
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So why are people willing to adjust with that mismatch?

369
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Things can scale up, and they have scaled up.

370
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
For example, cell phones: We have 400 million cellphones in this country.

371
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Now, it is possible that I use only two buttons on the cellphone,

372
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
only three options on the cellphone.

373
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
It has 300 options, I'm paying for 300; I'm using only three

374
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
but I'm willing to live with it, therefore it is scaling up.

375
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
But if I had to get a match to match,

376
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
obviously, I would need a different design of a cellphone.

377
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
So what we're saying is that scalability

378
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
should not become an enemy of sustainability.

379
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
There must be a place in the world

380
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
for solutions that are only relevant for a locality,

381
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and yet, one can be able to fund them.

382
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
One of the greatest studies that we've been finding is

383
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that many times investors would ask this question --

384
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
"What is a scalable model?" --

385
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
as if the need of a community, which is only

386
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
located in a space and time

387
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and has those needs only located in those places,

388
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
has no legitimate right to get them for free

389
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
because it's not part of a larger scale.

390
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
So either you sub-optimize your needs to a larger scale

391
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
or else you remain out.

392
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Now, the eminent model, the long-tail model

393
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
tells you that small sales

394
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
of a large number of books, for example,

395
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
having only a few copies sold

396
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
can still be a viable model.

397
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And we must find a mechanism where

398
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
people will pool in the portfolio, will invest in the portfolio,

399
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
where different innovations will go to

400
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
a small number of people in their localities,

401
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and yet, the overall platform of the model will become viable.

402
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Look at what he is doing.

403
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Saidullah Sahib is an amazing man.

404
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
At the age of 70,

405
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
he is linking up something very creative.

406
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
(Music)

407
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
Saidullah Sahib: I couldn't wait for the boat.

408
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
I had to meet my love.

409
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
My desperation made me an innovator.

410
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Even love needs help from technology.

411
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Innovation is the light of my wife, Noor.

412
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
New inventions are the passion of my life.

413
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
My technology.

414
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
(Applause)

415
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
AG: Saidulluh Sahib is

416
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
in Motihari, again in Champaran.

417
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Wonderful human being,

418
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
but he stills sells, at this age,

419
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
honey on a cycle to earn his livelihood,

420
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
because we haven't been able to convince the water park people,

421
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
the lake people, in [unclear] operations.

422
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
And we have not been able to convince the fire brigade people

423
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
in Mumbai -- where there was a flood a few years ago

424
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
and people had to walk 20 kilometers, wading in the water --

425
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
that, look, you should have this cycle in your fire brigade office

426
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
because you can then go to those lanes

427
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
where your buses will not go, where your transport will not go.

428
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
So we have not yet cracked the problem

429
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
of making it available as a rescue device,

430
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
as a vending device during the floods in eastern India,

431
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
when you have to deliver things to people

432
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
in different islands

433
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
where they're marooned.

434
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
But the idea has a merit. The idea has a merit.

435
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
What has Appachan done? Appachan, unfortunately, is no more,

436
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
but he has left behind a message.

437
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
A very powerful message

438
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
Appachan: I watch the world wake up every day.

439
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
(Music)

440
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
It's not that a coconut fell on my head,

441
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
and I came upon this idea.

442
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
With no money to fund my studies,

443
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
I scaled new heights.

444
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:41,000
Now, they call me the local Spiderman.

445
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
My technology.

446
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
(Applause)

447
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
AG: Many of you

448
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
might not realize and believe

449
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:02,000
that we have sold this product internationally --

450
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
what I call a G2G model,

451
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
grassroots to global.

452
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
And a professor in the University of Massachusetts,

453
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
in the zoology department,

454
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
bought this climber because she wanted

455
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
to study the insect diversity

456
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
of the top of the tree canopy.

457
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
And this device makes it possible

458
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
for her to take samples from a larger number of palms,

459
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
rather than only a few,

460
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:26,000
because otherwise she had to make a big platform

461
0:19:26.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
and then climb her [unclear] would climb on that.

462
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
So, you know, we are advancing the frontiers of science.

463
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
Remya Jose has developed ...

464
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
you can go to the YouTube and find India Innovates

465
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
and then you will find these videos.

466
0:19:36.26,000 --> 0:19:38,000
Innovation by her when she was in class 10th:

467
0:19:38.26,000 --> 0:19:4,000
a washing machine-cum-exercising machine.

468
0:19:40.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
Mr. Kharai who is a physically challenged person,

469
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
one and a half foot height, only.

470
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:48,000
But he has modified a two-wheeler so that he can get autonomy

471
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:51,000
and freedom and flexibility.

472
0:19:51.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
This innovation is from the slums of Rio.

473
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:56,000
And this person, Mr. Ubirajara.

474
0:19:56.26,000 --> 0:19:58,000
We were talking about, my friends in Brazil,

475
0:19:58.26,000 --> 0:20:,000
how we scale up this model in China and Brazil.

476
0:20:00.26,000 --> 0:20:03,000
And we have a very vibrant network in China, particularly,

477
0:20:03.26,000 --> 0:20:06,000
but also emerging in Brazil and other parts of the world.

478
0:20:06.26,000 --> 0:20:09,000
This stand on the front wheel, you will not find on any cycle.

479
0:20:09.26,000 --> 0:20:11,000
India and China have the largest number of cycles.

480
0:20:11.26,000 --> 0:20:14,000
But this innovation emerged in Brazil.

481
0:20:14.26,000 --> 0:20:17,000
The point is, none of us should be parochial,

482
0:20:17.26,000 --> 0:20:19,000
none of us should be so nationalistic to believe

483
0:20:19.26,000 --> 0:20:21,000
that all good ideas will come only from our country.

484
0:20:21.26,000 --> 0:20:24,000
No, we have to have the humility to learn

485
0:20:24.26,000 --> 0:20:27,000
from knowledge of economically poor people, wherever they are.

486
0:20:27.26,000 --> 0:20:3,000
And look at this whole range of cycle-based innovations:

487
0:20:30.26,000 --> 0:20:32,000
cycle that's a sprayer, cycle that

488
0:20:32.26,000 --> 0:20:34,000
generates energy from the shocks on the road.

489
0:20:34.26,000 --> 0:20:35,000
I can't change the condition of the road,

490
0:20:35.26,000 --> 0:20:37,000
but I can make the cycle run faster.

491
0:20:37.26,000 --> 0:20:39,000
That is what Kanak Das has done.

492
0:20:39.26,000 --> 0:20:41,000
And in South Africa,

493
0:20:41.26,000 --> 0:20:43,000
we had taken our innovators,

494
0:20:43.26,000 --> 0:20:46,000
and many of us had gone there share with the colleagues in South Africa

495
0:20:46.26,000 --> 0:20:48,000
as to how innovation can become

496
0:20:48.26,000 --> 0:20:5,000
a means of liberation

497
0:20:50.26,000 --> 0:20:52,000
from the drudgery that people have.

498
0:20:52.26,000 --> 0:20:54,000
And this is a donkey cart which they modified.

499
0:20:54.26,000 --> 0:20:56,000
There's an axle here, of 30, 40 kg,

500
0:20:56.26,000 --> 0:20:58,000
serving no purpose.

501
0:20:58.26,000 --> 0:21:01,000
Remove it, the cart needs one donkey less.

502
0:21:01.26,000 --> 0:21:04,000
This is in China. This girl needed a breathing apparatus.

503
0:21:04.26,000 --> 0:21:06,000
These three people in the village

504
0:21:06.26,000 --> 0:21:08,000
sat down and decided to think,

505
0:21:08.26,000 --> 0:21:1,000
"How do we elongate the life of this girl of our village?"

506
0:21:10.26,000 --> 0:21:12,000
They were not related to her, but they tried to find out,

507
0:21:12.26,000 --> 0:21:15,000
"How can we use ... "

508
0:21:15.26,000 --> 0:21:18,000
They used a cycle, they put together a breathing apparatus.

509
0:21:18.26,000 --> 0:21:2,000
And this breathing apparatus now saved the life,

510
0:21:20.26,000 --> 0:21:22,000
and she's very welcome.

511
0:21:22.26,000 --> 0:21:24,000
There's a whole range of innovations that we have.

512
0:21:24.26,000 --> 0:21:27,000
A car, which runs on compressed air

513
0:21:27.26,000 --> 0:21:29,000
with six paisa per kilometer.

514
0:21:29.26,000 --> 0:21:31,000
Assam, Kanak Gogoi.

515
0:21:31.26,000 --> 0:21:33,000
And you would not find this car in U.S. or Europe,

516
0:21:33.26,000 --> 0:21:35,000
but this is available in India.

517
0:21:35.26,000 --> 0:21:38,000
Now, this lady, she used to do the winding of the yarn

518
0:21:38.26,000 --> 0:21:4,000
for Pochampally Saree.

519
0:21:40.26,000 --> 0:21:42,000
In one day, 18,000 times,

520
0:21:42.26,000 --> 0:21:44,000
she had to do this winding

521
0:21:44.26,000 --> 0:21:46,000
to generate two sarees.

522
0:21:46.26,000 --> 0:21:49,000
This is what her son has done after seven years of struggle.

523
0:21:49.26,000 --> 0:21:51,000
She said, "Change your profession."

524
0:21:51.26,000 --> 0:21:53,000
He said, "I can't. This is the only thing I know, but I'll invent a machine,

525
0:21:53.26,000 --> 0:21:55,000
which will solve your problem."

526
0:21:55.26,000 --> 0:21:57,000
And this is what he did, a sewing machine in Uttar Pradesh.

527
0:21:57.26,000 --> 0:21:59,000
So, this is what SRISTI is saying:

528
0:21:59.26,000 --> 0:22:02,000
"Give me a place to stand, and I will move the world."

529
0:22:02.26,000 --> 0:22:05,000
I will just tell you that we are also doing a competition among children

530
0:22:05.26,000 --> 0:22:08,000
for creativity, a whole range of things.

531
0:22:08.26,000 --> 0:22:1,000
We have sold things all over the world,

532
0:22:10.26,000 --> 0:22:13,000
from Ethiopia to Turkey to U.S. to wherever.

533
0:22:13.26,000 --> 0:22:15,000
Products have gone to the market, a few.

534
0:22:15.26,000 --> 0:22:17,000
These are the people whose knowledge made

535
0:22:17.26,000 --> 0:22:19,000
this Herbavate cream for eczema possible.

536
0:22:19.26,000 --> 0:22:21,000
And here, a company which licensed this herbal pesticide

537
0:22:21.26,000 --> 0:22:23,000
put a photograph of the innovator on the packing

538
0:22:23.26,000 --> 0:22:25,000
so that every time a user uses it,

539
0:22:25.26,000 --> 0:22:27,000
it asks the user, "You can also be an innovator.

540
0:22:27.26,000 --> 0:22:3,000
If you have an idea, send it back to us."

541
0:22:30.26,000 --> 0:22:33,000
So, creativity counts, knowledge matters,

542
0:22:33.26,000 --> 0:22:36,000
innovations transform, incentives inspire.

543
0:22:36.26,000 --> 0:22:39,000
And incentives: not just material, but also non-material incentives.

544
0:22:39.26,000 --> 0:22:41,000
Thank you.

545
0:22:41.26,000 --> 0:22:47,000
(Applause)

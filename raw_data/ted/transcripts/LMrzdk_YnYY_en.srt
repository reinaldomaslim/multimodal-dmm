1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm here to talk about

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the wonder and the mystery

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of conscious minds.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The wonder is about the fact

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that we all woke up this morning

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and we had with it

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the amazing return of our conscious mind.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We recovered minds with a complete sense of self

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and a complete sense of our own existence,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
yet we hardly ever pause to consider this wonder.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We should, in fact,

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
because without having this possibility of conscious minds,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
we would have no knowledge whatsoever

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
about our humanity;

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we would have no knowledge whatsoever about the world.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
We would have no pains, but also no joys.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We would have no access to love

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
or to the ability to create.

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And of course, Scott Fitzgerald said famously

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that "he who invented consciousness

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
would have a lot to be blamed for."

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But he also forgot

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that without consciousness,

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
he would have no access to true happiness

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and even the possibility of transcendence.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So much for the wonder, now for the mystery.

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
This is a mystery

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that has really been extremely hard to elucidate.

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
All the way back into early philosophy

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and certainly throughout the history of neuroscience,

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
this has been one mystery

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that has always resisted elucidation,

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
has got major controversies.

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And there are actually many people

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that think we should not even touch it;

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
we should just leave it alone, it's not to be solved.

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I don't believe that,

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and I think the situation is changing.

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It would be ridiculous to claim

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that we know how we make consciousness

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in our brains,

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but we certainly can begin

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to approach the question,

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and we can begin to see the shape of a solution.

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And one more wonder to celebrate

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is the fact that we have imaging technologies

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that now allow us to go inside the human brain

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and be able to do, for example,

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
what you're seeing right now.

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
These are images that come from Hanna Damasio's lab,

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and which show you, in a living brain,

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the reconstruction of that brain.

53
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And this is a person who is alive.

54
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
This is not a person

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that is being studied at autopsy.

56
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And even more --

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and this is something that one can be really amazed about --

58
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is what I'm going to show you next,

59
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
which is going underneath the surface of the brain

60
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and actually looking in the living brain

61
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
at real connections, real pathways.

62
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So all of those colored lines

63
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
correspond to bunches of axons,

64
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the fibers that join cell bodies

65
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to synapses.

66
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And I'm sorry to disappoint you, they don't come in color.

67
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But at any rate, they are there.

68
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The colors are codes for the direction,

69
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
from whether it is back to front

70
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
or vice versa.

71
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
At any rate, what is consciousness?

72
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
What is a conscious mind?

73
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And we could take a very simple view

74
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and say, well, it is that which we lose

75
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
when we fall into deep sleep without dreams,

76
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
or when we go under anesthesia,

77
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and it is what we regain

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
when we recover from sleep

79
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
or from anesthesia.

80
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But what is exactly that stuff that we lose under anesthesia,

81
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
or when we are in deep, dreamless sleep?

82
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Well first of all,

83
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it is a mind,

84
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
which is a flow of mental images.

85
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And of course consider images

86
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that can be sensory patterns,

87
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
visual, such as you're having right now

88
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in relation to the stage and me,

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
or auditory images,

90
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
as you are having now in relation to my words.

91
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That flow of mental images

92
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
is mind.

93
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But there is something else

94
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that we are all experiencing in this room.

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We are not passive exhibitors

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
of visual or auditory

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
or tactile images.

98
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We have selves.

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We have a Me

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that is automatically present

101
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in our minds right now.

102
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
We own our minds.

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And we have a sense that it's everyone of us

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that is experiencing this --

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
not the person who is sitting next to you.

106
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So in order to have a conscious mind,

107
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
you have a self within the conscious mind.

108
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So a conscious mind is a mind with a self in it.

109
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The self introduces the subjective perspective in the mind,

110
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and we are only fully conscious

111
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
when self comes to mind.

112
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So what we need to know to even address this mystery

113
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is, number one, how are minds are put together in the brain,

114
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and, number two, how selves are constructed.

115
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now the first part, the first problem,

116
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
is relatively easy -- it's not easy at all --

117
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
but it is something that has been approached gradually in neuroscience.

118
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And it's quite clear that, in order to make minds,

119
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we need to construct neural maps.

120
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So imagine a grid, like the one I'm showing you right now,

121
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and now imagine, within that grid,

122
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that two-dimensional sheet,

123
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
imagine neurons.

124
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And picture, if you will,

125
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
a billboard, a digital billboard,

126
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
where you have elements

127
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that can be either lit or not.

128
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And depending on how you create the pattern

129
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
of lighting or not lighting,

130
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the digital elements,

131
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
or, for that matter, the neurons in the sheet,

132
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
you're going to be able to construct a map.

133
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This, of course, is a visual map that I'm showing you,

134
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but this applies to any kind of map --

135
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
auditory, for example, in relation to sound frequencies,

136
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
or to the maps that we construct with our skin

137
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in relation to an object that we palpate.

138
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Now to bring home the point

139
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
of how close it is --

140
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
the relationship between the grid of neurons

141
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and the topographical arrangement

142
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
of the activity of the neurons

143
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and our mental experience --

144
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I'm going to tell you a personal story.

145
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So if I cover my left eye --

146
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I'm talking about me personally, not all of you --

147
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
if I cover my left eye,

148
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I look at the grid -- pretty much like the one I'm showing you.

149
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Everything is nice and fine and perpendicular.

150
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But sometime ago, I discovered

151
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that if I cover my left eye,

152
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
instead what I get is this.

153
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I look at the grid and I see a warping

154
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
at the edge of my central-left field.

155
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Very odd -- I've analyzed this for a while.

156
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
But sometime ago,

157
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
through the help of an opthamologist colleague of mine,

158
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Carmen Puliafito,

159
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
who developed a laser scanner of the retina,

160
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I found out the the following.

161
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
If I scan my retina

162
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
through the horizontal plane that you see there in the little corner,

163
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
what I get is the following.

164
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
On the right side, my retina is perfectly symmetrical.

165
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You see the going down towards the fovea

166
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
where the optic nerve begins.

167
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But on my left retina there is a bump,

168
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
which is marked there by the red arrow.

169
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And it corresponds to a little cyst

170
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that is located below.

171
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And that is exactly what causes

172
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the warping of my visual image.

173
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So just think of this:

174
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
you have a grid of neurons,

175
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and now you have a plane mechanical change

176
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in the position of the grid,

177
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and you get a warping of your mental experience.

178
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So this is how close

179
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
your mental experience

180
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and the activity of the neurons in the retina,

181
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
which is a part of the brain located in the eyeball,

182
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
or, for that matter, a sheet of visual cortex.

183
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So from the retina

184
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
you go onto visual cortex.

185
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And of course, the brain adds on

186
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
a lot of information

187
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to what is going on

188
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in the signals that come from the retina.

189
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And in that image there,

190
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
you see a variety of islands

191
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
of what I call image-making regions in the brain.

192
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You have the green for example,

193
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that corresponds to tactile information,

194
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
or the blue that corresponds to auditory information.

195
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And something else that happens

196
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is that those image-making regions

197
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
where you have the plotting

198
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
of all these neural maps,

199
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
can then provide signals

200
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to this ocean of purple that you see around,

201
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
which is the association cortex,

202
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
where you can make records of what went on

203
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in those islands of image-making.

204
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And the great beauty

205
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is that you can then go from memory,

206
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
out of those association cortices,

207
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and produce back images

208
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in the very same regions that have perception.

209
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So think about how wonderfully convenient and lazy

210
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
the brain is.

211
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So it provides certain areas

212
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
for perception and image-making.

213
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
And those are exactly the same

214
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that are going to be used for image-making

215
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
when we recall information.

216
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So far the mystery of the conscious mind

217
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is diminishing a little bit

218
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
because we have a general sense

219
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
of how we make these images.

220
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But what about the self?

221
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The self is really the elusive problem.

222
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And for a long time,

223
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
people did not even want to touch it,

224
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
because they'd say,

225
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
"How can you have this reference point, this stability,

226
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that is required to maintain

227
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the continuity of selves day after day?"

228
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And I thought about a solution to this problem.

229
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It's the following.

230
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We generate brain maps

231
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
of the body's interior

232
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and use them as the reference for all other maps.

233
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
So let me tell you just a little bit about how I came to this.

234
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I came to this because,

235
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
if you're going to have a reference that we know as self --

236
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
the Me, the I

237
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
in our own processing --

238
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
we need to have something that is stable,

239
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
something that does not deviate much

240
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
from day to day.

241
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Well it so happens that we have a singular body.

242
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We have one body, not two, not three.

243
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And so that is a beginning.

244
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
There is just one reference point, which is the body.

245
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But then, of course, the body has many parts,

246
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and things grow at different rates,

247
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and they have different sizes and different people;

248
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
however, not so with the interior.

249
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
The things that have to do

250
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
with what is known as our internal milieu --

251
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
for example, the whole management

252
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
of the chemistries within our body

253
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
are, in fact, extremely maintained

254
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
day after day

255
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
for one very good reason.

256
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
If you deviate too much

257
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in the parameters

258
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that are close to the midline

259
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
of that life-permitting survival range,

260
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
you go into disease or death.

261
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So we have an in-built system

262
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
within our own lives

263
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that ensures some kind of continuity.

264
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I like to call it an almost infinite sameness from day to day.

265
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Because if you don't have that sameness, physiologically,

266
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
you're going to be sick or you're going to die.

267
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So that's one more element for this continuity.

268
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And the final thing

269
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is that there is a very tight coupling

270
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
between the regulation of our body within the brain

271
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and the body itself,

272
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
unlike any other coupling.

273
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So for example, I'm making images of you,

274
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
but there's no physiological bond

275
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
between the images I have of you as an audience

276
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and my brain.

277
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
However, there is a close, permanently maintained bond

278
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
between the body regulating parts of my brain

279
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and my own body.

280
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
So here's how it looks. Look at the region there.

281
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
There is the brain stem in between the cerebral cortex

282
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and the spinal cord.

283
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And it is within that region

284
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that I'm going to highlight now

285
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that we have this housing

286
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
of all the life-regulation devices

287
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
of the body.

288
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
This is so specific that, for example,

289
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
if you look at the part that is covered in red

290
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
in the upper part of the brain stem,

291
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
if you damage that as a result of a stroke, for example,

292
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
what you get is coma

293
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
or vegetative state,

294
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
which is a state, of course,

295
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
in which your mind disappears,

296
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
your consciousness disappears.

297
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
What happens then actually

298
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
is that you lose the grounding of the self,

299
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
you have no longer access to any feeling of your own existence,

300
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and, in fact, there can be images going on,

301
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
being formed in the cerebral cortex,

302
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
except you don't know they're there.

303
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
You have, in effect, lost consciousness

304
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
when you have damage to that red section of the brain stem.

305
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
But if you consider the green part of the brain stem,

306
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
nothing like that happens.

307
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It is that specific.

308
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So in that green component of the brain stem,

309
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
if you damage it, and often it happens,

310
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
what you get is complete paralysis,

311
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
but your conscious mind is maintained.

312
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
You feel, you know, you have a fully conscious mind

313
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
that you can report very indirectly.

314
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
This is a horrific condition. You don't want to see it.

315
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And people are, in fact, imprisoned

316
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
within their own bodies,

317
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
but they do have a mind.

318
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
There was a very interesting film,

319
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
one of the rare good films done

320
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
about a situation like this,

321
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
by Julian Schnabel some years ago

322
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
about a patient that was in that condition.

323
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So now I'm going to show you a picture.

324
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I promise not to say anything about this,

325
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
except this is to frighten you.

326
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
It's just to tell you

327
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that in that red section of the brain stem,

328
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
there are, to make it simple,

329
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
all those little squares that correspond to modules

330
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
that actually make brain maps

331
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
of different aspects of our interior,

332
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
different aspects of our body.

333
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
They are exquisitely topographic

334
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
and they are exquisitely interconnected

335
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
in a recursive pattern.

336
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And it is out of this and out of this tight coupling

337
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
between the brain stem and the body

338
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that I believe -- and I could be wrong,

339
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
but I don't think I am --

340
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
that you generate this mapping of the body

341
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
that provides the grounding for the self

342
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and that comes in the form of feelings --

343
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
primordial feelings, by the way.

344
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
So what is the picture that we get here?

345
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Look at "cerebral cortex," look at "brain stem,"

346
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
look at "body,"

347
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and you get the picture of the interconnectivity

348
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
in which you have the brain stem providing the grounding for the self

349
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
in a very tight interconnection with the body.

350
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
And you have the cerebral cortex

351
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
providing the great spectacle of our minds

352
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
with the profusion of images

353
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
that are, in fact, the contents of our minds

354
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and that we normally pay most attention to,

355
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
as we should, because that's really

356
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
the film that is rolling in our minds.

357
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
But look at the arrows.

358
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
They're not there for looks.

359
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
They're there because there's this very close interaction.

360
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
You cannot have a conscious mind

361
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
if you don't have the interaction

362
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
between cerebral cortex and brain stem.

363
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
You cannot have a conscious mind

364
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
if you don't have the interaction

365
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
between the brain stem and the body.

366
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Another thing that is interesting

367
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
is that the brain stem that we have

368
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
is shared with a variety of other species.

369
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
So throughout vertebrates,

370
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
the design of the brain stem is very similar to ours,

371
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
which is one of the reasons why I think

372
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
those other species have conscious minds like we do.

373
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Except that they're not as rich as ours,

374
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
because they don't have a cerebral cortex like we do.

375
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
That's where the difference is.

376
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And I strongly disagree with the idea

377
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that consciousness should be considered

378
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
as the great product of the cerebral cortex.

379
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Only the wealth of our minds is,

380
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
not the very fact that we have a self

381
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that we can refer

382
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
to our own existence,

383
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and that we have any sense of person.

384
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Now there are three levels of self to consider --

385
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
the proto, the core and the autobiographical.

386
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
The first two are shared

387
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
with many, many other species,

388
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
and they are really coming out

389
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
largely of the brain stem

390
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and whatever there is of cortex in those species.

391
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
It's the autobiographical self

392
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
which some species have, I think.

393
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Cetaceans and primates have also

394
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
an autobiographical self to a certain degree.

395
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And everybody's dogs at home

396
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
have an autobiographical self to a certain degree.

397
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
But the novelty is here.

398
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
The autobiographical self is built

399
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
on the basis of past memories

400
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and memories of the plans that we have made;

401
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
it's the lived past and the anticipated future.

402
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And the autobiographical self

403
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
has prompted extended memory, reasoning,

404
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
imagination, creativity and language.

405
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And out of that came the instruments of culture --

406
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
religions, justice,

407
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
trade, the arts, science, technology.

408
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And it is within that culture

409
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
that we really can get --

410
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
and this is the novelty --

411
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
something that is not entirely set by our biology.

412
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
It is developed in the cultures.

413
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
It developed in collectives of human beings.

414
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And this is, of course, the culture

415
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
where we have developed something that I like to call

416
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
socio-cultural regulation.

417
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
And finally, you could rightly ask,

418
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
why care about this?

419
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Why care if it is the brain stem or the cerebral cortex

420
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and how this is made?

421
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Three reasons. First, curiosity.

422
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Primates are extremely curious --

423
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and humans most of all.

424
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
And if we are interested, for example,

425
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
in the fact that anti-gravity

426
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
is pulling galaxies away from the Earth,

427
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
why should we not be interested in what is going on

428
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
inside of human beings?

429
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Second, understanding society and culture.

430
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
We should look

431
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
at how society and culture

432
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
in this socio-cultural regulation

433
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
are a work in progress.

434
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And finally, medicine.

435
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Let's not forget that some of the worst diseases

436
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
of humankind

437
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
are diseases such as depression,

438
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Alzheimer's disease, drug addiction.

439
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Think of strokes that can devastate your mind

440
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
or render you unconscious.

441
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
You have no prayer

442
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
of treating those diseases effectively

443
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and in a non-serendipitous way

444
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
if you do not know how this works.

445
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
So that's a very good reason

446
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
beyond curiosity

447
0:18:24.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
to justify what we're doing,

448
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
and to justify having some interest in what is going on in our brains.

449
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Thank you for your attention.

450
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
(Applause)

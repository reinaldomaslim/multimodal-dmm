1
0:00:12.857,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Most people think

2
0:00:17.469,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that new technology or advanced technology can never start in Africa.

3
0:00:22.149,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Instead, they think that the best way to help the continent advance

4
0:00:25.877,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is by providing aid or services

5
0:00:28.473,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that the continent can't provide for itself.

6
0:00:31.864,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So while we see advanced technology like robotics

7
0:00:35.217,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and artificial intelligence

8
0:00:36.584,000 --> 0:00:38,000
growing exponentially in the developed world,

9
0:00:39.416,000 --> 0:00:4,000
those same people are worried

10
0:00:40.998,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that a technologically backward Africa is falling behind.

11
0:00:45.19,000 --> 0:00:47,000
That attitude couldn't be more wrong.

12
0:00:49.585,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'm a robotics entrepreneur who's spent a lot of time here in Africa.

13
0:00:53.433,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And in 2014 we created Zipline,

14
0:00:57.777,000 --> 0:01:01,000
which is a company that uses electric autonomous aircraft

15
0:01:01.906,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to deliver medicine to hospitals and health centers on demand.

16
0:01:05.582,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Last year, we launched the world's first automated delivery system

17
0:01:09.777,000 --> 0:01:1,000
operating at national scale.

18
0:01:11.928,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And guess what?

19
0:01:13.692,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We did not do that in the US,

20
0:01:16.661,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we didn't do it in Japan,

21
0:01:18.131,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and we didn't do it in Europe.

22
0:01:20.035,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It was actually President Paul Kagame

23
0:01:23.282,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and the Rwandan Ministry of Health

24
0:01:26.098,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that made a big bet on the potential of this technology

25
0:01:29.468,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and signed a commercial contract

26
0:01:31.172,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to deliver a majority of the country's blood on demand.

27
0:01:35.695,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Applause)

28
0:01:41.395,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Yeah, they deserve the applause.

29
0:01:44.78,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So why is blood important?

30
0:01:46.58,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Rwanda collects between 60- and 80,000 units of blood a year.

31
0:01:50.487,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So this is a product that when you need it,

32
0:01:52.511,000 --> 0:01:53,000
you really, really need it.

33
0:01:54.668,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But blood is also challenging,

34
0:01:56.843,000 --> 0:01:58,000
because it has a very short shelf life,

35
0:01:59.531,000 --> 0:02:01,000
there are lots of different storage requirements,

36
0:02:02.201,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and it's really hard to predict the demand

37
0:02:04.585,000 --> 0:02:05,000
for all of these different blood groups

38
0:02:06.531,000 --> 0:02:08,000
before a patient actually needs something.

39
0:02:09.477,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But the cool thing is that using this technology,

40
0:02:12.029,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Rwanda has been able to keep more blood centralized

41
0:02:15.585,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and then provide it when a patient needs something

42
0:02:18.32,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to any hospital or health center in an average of just 20 or 30 minutes.

43
0:02:23.032,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Do you guys want to see how it works?

44
0:02:24.863,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Audience) Yes.

45
0:02:26.042,000 --> 0:02:28,000
All right. Nobody believes me, so ... better to show.

46
0:02:28.985,000 --> 0:02:29,000
This is our distribution center,

47
0:02:30.533,000 --> 0:02:33,000
which is about 20 kilometers outside of Kigali.

48
0:02:34.34,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This actually used to be a cornfield nine months ago,

49
0:02:37.312,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and with the Rwandan government,

50
0:02:38.861,000 --> 0:02:4,000
we leveled it and built this center in a couple weeks.

51
0:02:41.599,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So when a patient is having an emergency,

52
0:02:43.979,000 --> 0:02:46,000
a doctor or a nurse at that hospital can send us a WhatsApp,

53
0:02:47.323,000 --> 0:02:48,000
telling us what they need.

54
0:02:48.988,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And then our team will immediately spring into action.

55
0:02:51.777,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We pull the blood from our stock,

56
0:02:53.479,000 --> 0:02:56,000
which is delivered from the National Center for Blood Transfusion;

57
0:02:56.694,000 --> 0:02:57,000
we scan the blood into our system

58
0:02:58.556,000 --> 0:03:01,000
so the Ministry of Health knows where the blood is going;

59
0:03:01.673,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and then we'll basically pack it into a Zip,

60
0:03:03.956,000 --> 0:03:05,000
which is what we call these little autonomous airplanes

61
0:03:06.7,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that run on batteries.

62
0:03:08.035,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And then once that Zip is ready to go,

63
0:03:10.074,000 --> 0:03:13,000
we accelerate it from zero to 100 kilometers an hour

64
0:03:13.305,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in about half of a second.

65
0:03:18.711,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Audience) Whoa!

66
0:03:19.892,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And from the moment it leaves the end of the launcher,

67
0:03:22.6,000 --> 0:03:23,000
it's completely autonomous.

68
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Video: Air traffic controller directs traffic)

69
0:03:26.886,000 --> 0:03:28,000
This is our air traffic controller calling it in

70
0:03:29.289,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to Kigali International Airport.

71
0:03:31.155,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And when the Zip arrives at the hospital,

72
0:03:33.132,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it descends to about 30 feet and drops the package.

73
0:03:35.88,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We use a really simple paper parachute -- simple things are best --

74
0:03:39.454,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that allows the package to come to the ground gently and reliably

75
0:03:42.527,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in the same place every time.

76
0:03:44.425,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So it's just like ride sharing;

77
0:03:46.783,000 --> 0:03:49,000
the doctors get a text message one minute before we arrive, saying,

78
0:03:50.073,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"Walk outside and receive your delivery."

79
0:03:52.055,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:53.146,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And then --

81
0:03:54.525,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Applause)

82
0:04:01.892,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and then the doctors have what they need to save a patient's life.

83
0:04:05.554,000 --> 0:04:08,000
This is actually watching a delivery happen from our distribution center;

84
0:04:09.395,000 --> 0:04:11,000
this vehicle is about 50 kilometers away.

85
0:04:12.042,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We're able to watch the vehicle as it makes a delivery at a hospital

86
0:04:16.097,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in real time.

87
0:04:17.31,000 --> 0:04:19,000
You may have noticed there are pings

88
0:04:19.564,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that are coming off of that vehicle on the screen.

89
0:04:22.14,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Those pings are actually data packets

90
0:04:23.941,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that we're getting over the cell phone networks.

91
0:04:26.246,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So these planes have SIM cards just like your cell phone does,

92
0:04:29.456,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and they're communicating over the cell network

93
0:04:31.681,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to tell us where they are and how they're doing at all times.

94
0:04:34.584,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Believe it or not, we actually buy family plans --

95
0:04:37.028,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:38.062,000 --> 0:04:39,000
for this fleet of vehicles,

97
0:04:39.442,000 --> 0:04:41,000
because that's how we get the best rates.

98
0:04:41.513,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:42.62,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It's actually not a joke.

100
0:04:44.06,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:47.7,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So today, we're delivering about 20 percent

102
0:04:51.024,000 --> 0:04:53,000
of the national blood supply of Rwanda

103
0:04:53.286,000 --> 0:04:54,000
outside of Kigali.

104
0:04:55.339,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We serve about 12 hospitals,

105
0:04:57.037,000 --> 0:05:,000
and we're adding hospitals to that network at an accelerating rate.

106
0:05:00.573,000 --> 0:05:03,000
All of those hospitals only receive blood in this way,

107
0:05:03.599,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and most of those hospitals actually place multiple orders every day.

108
0:05:09.289,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So the reason --

109
0:05:10.509,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in all of health care logistics,

110
0:05:12.059,000 --> 0:05:15,000
you're always trading off waste against access.

111
0:05:15.637,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So if you want to solve waste, you keep everything centralized.

112
0:05:19.732,000 --> 0:05:21,000
As a result, when patients are having emergencies,

113
0:05:22.746,000 --> 0:05:25,000
sometimes they don't have the medical product they need.

114
0:05:25.86,000 --> 0:05:28,000
If you want to solve access, you stock a lot of medicine at the last mile,

115
0:05:29.363,000 --> 0:05:3,000
at hospitals or health centers,

116
0:05:30.908,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and then patients have the medicine they need.

117
0:05:33.096,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But you end up throwing a lot of medicine out,

118
0:05:35.292,000 --> 0:05:36,000
which is very expensive.

119
0:05:36.519,000 --> 0:05:38,000
What's so amazing is that the Rwandan government has been able

120
0:05:39.488,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to break this cycle permanently.

121
0:05:41.983,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Because doctors can get what they need instantly,

122
0:05:45.455,000 --> 0:05:47,000
they actually stock less blood at the hospitals.

123
0:05:48.818,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So although use of blood products has increased substantially

124
0:05:52.652,000 --> 0:05:53,000
at all the hospitals we serve,

125
0:05:54.357,000 --> 0:05:58,000
in the last nine months, zero units of blood have expired

126
0:05:58.442,000 --> 0:05:59,000
at any of these hospitals.

127
0:06:00.579,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Applause)

128
0:06:06.666,000 --> 0:06:07,000
That's an amazing result.

129
0:06:08.535,000 --> 0:06:11,000
That's actually not been achieved by any other health care system

130
0:06:11.687,000 --> 0:06:12,000
on the planet,

131
0:06:12.865,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and it happened here.

132
0:06:15.375,000 --> 0:06:19,000
But obviously, when we're talking about delivering medical products instantly,

133
0:06:19.801,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the most important thing is patients.

134
0:06:22.267,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Let me give you an example.

135
0:06:24.55,000 --> 0:06:27,000
A couple months ago, a 24-year-old mother came into one of the hospitals

136
0:06:28.198,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that we serve,

137
0:06:29.39,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and she gave birth via C-section.

138
0:06:31.749,000 --> 0:06:33,000
But that led to complications, and she started to bleed.

139
0:06:35.366,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Luckily, the doctors had some blood of her blood type on hand

140
0:06:39.282,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that had been delivered via Zipline's routine service,

141
0:06:42.266,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and so they transfused her with a couple units of blood.

142
0:06:45.317,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But she bled out of those units in about 10 minutes.

143
0:06:49.199,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In this case, that mother's life is in grave danger --

144
0:06:53.529,000 --> 0:06:55,000
in any hospital in the world.

145
0:06:56.952,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But luckily, the doctors who were taking care of her

146
0:06:59.917,000 --> 0:07:01,000
immediately called our distribution center,

147
0:07:02.318,000 --> 0:07:04,000
they placed an emergency order,

148
0:07:04.432,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and our team actually did emergency delivery after emergency delivery

149
0:07:08.868,000 --> 0:07:09,000
after emergency delivery.

150
0:07:10.59,000 --> 0:07:12,000
They ended up sending seven units of red blood cells,

151
0:07:13.158,000 --> 0:07:14,000
four units of plasma

152
0:07:14.496,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and two units of platelets.

153
0:07:15.845,000 --> 0:07:17,000
That's more blood than you have in your entire body.

154
0:07:19.164,000 --> 0:07:21,000
All of it was transfused into her,

155
0:07:21.242,000 --> 0:07:23,000
the doctors were able to stabilize her,

156
0:07:23.425,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and she is healthy today.

157
0:07:26.095,000 --> 0:07:28,000
(Applause)

158
0:07:32.645,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Since we launched, we've done about 400 emergency deliveries like that,

159
0:07:37.541,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and there's a story like that one behind most of those emergencies.

160
0:07:40.828,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Here are just a couple of the moms

161
0:07:42.691,000 --> 0:07:44,000
who have received transfusions in this way

162
0:07:44.86,000 --> 0:07:45,000
in the last couple months.

163
0:07:47.132,000 --> 0:07:51,000
We're always reminded: when we can help a doctor save a mom's life,

164
0:07:51.256,000 --> 0:07:53,000
it's not just her life that you're saving.

165
0:07:53.755,000 --> 0:07:56,000
That's also a baby boy or a baby girl

166
0:07:56.87,000 --> 0:07:58,000
who has a mother while they're growing up.

167
0:08:00.757,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Applause)

168
0:08:05.507,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But I want to be clear:

169
0:08:06.778,000 --> 0:08:08,000
postpartum hemorrhaging -- it's not a Rwanda problem,

170
0:08:09.384,000 --> 0:08:1,000
it's not a developing-world problem --

171
0:08:11.255,000 --> 0:08:12,000
this is a global problem.

172
0:08:12.5,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Maternal health is a challenge everywhere.

173
0:08:14.585,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The main difference is that Rwanda was the first country

174
0:08:17.532,000 --> 0:08:2,000
to use radical technology to do something about it.

175
0:08:20.783,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And that's the reason this attitude of Africa being disrupted

176
0:08:25.111,000 --> 0:08:26,000
or advanced technology not working here

177
0:08:27.048,000 --> 0:08:28,000
or needing aid

178
0:08:28.25,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is so totally wrong.

179
0:08:29.659,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Africa can be the disrupter.

180
0:08:32.423,000 --> 0:08:37,000
These small, agile, developing economies can out-innovate large, rich ones.

181
0:08:37.706,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And they can totally leapfrog over the absence of legacy infrastructure

182
0:08:41.61,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to go straight to newer and better systems.

183
0:08:44.237,000 --> 0:08:45,000
In 2000,

184
0:08:45.703,000 --> 0:08:48,000
if you had said that high-quality cellular networks were about to roll out

185
0:08:49.543,000 --> 0:08:5,000
across all of Africa,

186
0:08:50.803,000 --> 0:08:52,000
people would have told you that you were crazy.

187
0:08:53.493,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And yet, no one anticipated

188
0:08:56.493,000 --> 0:09:,000
how fast those networks were going to connect and empower people.

189
0:09:00.951,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Today, 44 percent of the GDP of Kenya flows through M-Pesa,

190
0:09:04.901,000 --> 0:09:05,000
their mobile payment platform.

191
0:09:06.598,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And not only that,

192
0:09:07.93,000 --> 0:09:1,000
but our autonomous fleet of vehicles relies on that cellular network.

193
0:09:11.55,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Over the next few years as we start serving private health care facilities,

194
0:09:15.468,000 --> 0:09:17,000
we'll also use that mobile payment platform

195
0:09:17.762,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to collect fees for deliveries.

196
0:09:19.965,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So innovation leads to more innovation leads to more innovation.

197
0:09:23.774,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And meanwhile,

198
0:09:25.653,000 --> 0:09:28,000
most people who live in developed economies

199
0:09:28.683,000 --> 0:09:31,000
think that drone delivery is technologically impossible,

200
0:09:32.477,000 --> 0:09:35,000
let alone happening at national scale in East Africa.

201
0:09:36.335,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And I do mean East Africa, not just Rwanda.

202
0:09:40.483,000 --> 0:09:42,000
On Thursday, just a couple days ago,

203
0:09:42.777,000 --> 0:09:44,000
the Tanzanian Ministry of Health announced

204
0:09:45.36,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that they are going to use this same technology

205
0:09:48.116,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to provide instant delivery of a wide range of medical products

206
0:09:51.728,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to 10 million of the hardest to reach people in the country.

207
0:09:55.789,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Applause)

208
0:10:02.387,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It's actually going to be the largest autonomous system anywhere in the world.

209
0:10:06.625,000 --> 0:10:08,000
To give you a sense of what this looks like,

210
0:10:08.748,000 --> 0:10:1,000
this is one of the first distribution centers.

211
0:10:10.97,000 --> 0:10:13,000
You can see a 75-kilometer service radius around the distribution center,

212
0:10:14.548,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and that allows us to serve hundreds of health facilities and hospitals,

213
0:10:18.12,000 --> 0:10:19,000
all of which are rural,

214
0:10:19.41,000 --> 0:10:2,000
from that single distribution center.

215
0:10:21.327,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But to serve over 20 percent of the population of Tanzania,

216
0:10:24.387,000 --> 0:10:26,000
we're going to need multiple distribution centers.

217
0:10:26.87,000 --> 0:10:27,000
We'll actually need four.

218
0:10:28.235,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And from these distribution centers,

219
0:10:30.296,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we expect to be doing several hundred lifesaving deliveries every day,

220
0:10:35.558,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and this system will ultimately serve over 1,000 health facilities

221
0:10:39.821,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and hospitals in the country.

222
0:10:41.695,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So yeah, East Africa is moving really fast.

223
0:10:47.179,000 --> 0:10:49,000
One thing that people, I think, often miss

224
0:10:49.987,000 --> 0:10:52,000
is that these kinds of leaps generate compounding gains.

225
0:10:53.243,000 --> 0:10:57,000
For example, Rwanda, by investing in this infrastructure for health care,

226
0:10:57.852,000 --> 0:11:,000
now has an aerial logistics network that they can use

227
0:11:01.761,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to catalyze other parts of their economy,

228
0:11:05.168,000 --> 0:11:07,000
like agriculture or e-commerce.

229
0:11:07.254,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Even more importantly,

230
0:11:08.565,000 --> 0:11:13,000
100 percent of the teams we hire at these distribution centers are local.

231
0:11:13.881,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So here's our Rwandan team,

232
0:11:15.585,000 --> 0:11:18,000
which is a group of extraordinary engineers and operators.

233
0:11:19.489,000 --> 0:11:24,000
They run the world's only automated delivery system

234
0:11:24.816,000 --> 0:11:25,000
operating at national scale.

235
0:11:27.099,000 --> 0:11:29,000
They have been able to master something

236
0:11:29.326,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that the largest technology companies in the world

237
0:11:32.223,000 --> 0:11:34,000
have not yet been able to figure out.

238
0:11:34.679,000 --> 0:11:35,000
So they are total heroes.

239
0:11:36.3,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Applause)

240
0:11:41.015,000 --> 0:11:42,000
They're total heroes.

241
0:11:42.971,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Our team's mission is to deliver basic access to medicine

242
0:11:47.409,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to all seven billion people on the planet,

243
0:11:49.522,000 --> 0:11:51,000
no matter how hard it is to reach them.

244
0:11:51.785,000 --> 0:11:52,000
We often tell people about that mission,

245
0:11:53.764,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and they say, "That's so generous of you, it's so philanthropic."

246
0:11:56.907,000 --> 0:11:57,000
No!

247
0:11:58.293,000 --> 0:12:,000
Philanthropy has nothing to do with it.

248
0:12:00.347,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Because of the commercial contracts that we sign with ministries of health,

249
0:12:03.985,000 --> 0:12:06,000
these networks are 100 percent sustainable and scalable.

250
0:12:08.019,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And the reason we feel so strongly about correcting that misperception

251
0:12:11.606,000 --> 0:12:14,000
is that entrepreneurship is the only force in human history

252
0:12:14.685,000 --> 0:12:16,000
that has lifted millions of people out of poverty.

253
0:12:17.43,000 --> 0:12:19,000
(Applause)

254
0:12:21.987,000 --> 0:12:24,000
No amount of foreign aid is going to sustainably employ

255
0:12:25.884,000 --> 0:12:27,000
250 million African youth.

256
0:12:30.734,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And the jobs that these kids may have gotten 10 years ago

257
0:12:35.226,000 --> 0:12:36,000
are largely being automated

258
0:12:36.688,000 --> 0:12:38,000
or are being changed dramatically by technology.

259
0:12:39.169,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So they are looking for new skill sets,

260
0:12:41.355,000 --> 0:12:42,000
new competitive advantages.

261
0:12:42.947,000 --> 0:12:43,000
They're looking for start-ups.

262
0:12:45.097,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So why aren't there more start-ups that are tackling these global problems

263
0:12:50.817,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that are faced by billions of people in developing economies?

264
0:12:54.933,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The reason is that investors and entrepreneurs are totally blind

265
0:12:58.021,000 --> 0:12:59,000
to the opportunity.

266
0:12:59.323,000 --> 0:13:03,000
We think these problems are the domain of NGOs or governments,

267
0:13:03.7,000 --> 0:13:04,000
not private companies.

268
0:13:05.262,000 --> 0:13:06,000
That's what we have to change.

269
0:13:09.693,000 --> 0:13:11,000
You may have noticed I left something out of the video

270
0:13:12.504,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that I showed you.

271
0:13:14.054,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I didn't show you how the planes land

272
0:13:15.923,000 --> 0:13:17,000
when they get back to the distribution center.

273
0:13:18.496,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So, it might be obvious to you:

274
0:13:21.2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
none of our planes have landing gear.

275
0:13:23.036,000 --> 0:13:25,000
We also don't have runways where we operate.

276
0:13:25.156,000 --> 0:13:27,000
So we have to be able to decelerate the plane

277
0:13:27.39,000 --> 0:13:3,000
from about 100 kilometers an hour to zero in half of a second.

278
0:13:30.786,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And the way we do that

279
0:13:32.38,000 --> 0:13:35,000
is we actually use a wire that tracks that plane as it comes in,

280
0:13:36.152,000 --> 0:13:37,000
with centimeter-level accuracy.

281
0:13:37.989,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We snag the plane out of the sky,

282
0:13:40.124,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and then we gently plop it onto an actively inflated cushion.

283
0:13:44.419,000 --> 0:13:46,000
This is basically a combination of an aircraft carrier

284
0:13:47.094,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and a bouncy castle.

285
0:13:48.286,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Laughter)

286
0:13:50.063,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So let me show you.

287
0:13:58.06,000 --> 0:14:,000
(Laughter)

288
0:14:00.773,000 --> 0:14:03,000
(Applause)

289
0:14:06.99,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And it might be obvious to you why I wanted to end with this video.

290
0:14:10.25,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I wanted to show you the kids and the teenagers

291
0:14:12.481,000 --> 0:14:14,000
who line up on the fence every day.

292
0:14:15.509,000 --> 0:14:17,000
They cheer every launch and every landing.

293
0:14:18.219,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Laughter)

294
0:14:19.553,000 --> 0:14:21,000
(Applause)

295
0:14:24.436,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Sometimes I actually show up at the distribution center early

296
0:14:27.334,000 --> 0:14:28,000
because I'm jet-lagged.

297
0:14:28.522,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I'll show up an hour before we begin operation.

298
0:14:30.839,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And there will be kids on the fence getting good seats.

299
0:14:33.503,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Laughter)

300
0:14:34.737,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And you go up and you ask them,

301
0:14:36.287,000 --> 0:14:37,000
"What do you think about the planes?"

302
0:14:38.13,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And they'll say, "Oh, it's a sky ambulance."

303
0:14:41.757,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So they get it.

304
0:14:42.932,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I mean, they get it more than most adults.

305
0:14:45.917,000 --> 0:14:46,000
So I was asking earlier:

306
0:14:47.209,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Who is going to be creating the disruptive technology companies of Africa

307
0:14:52.991,000 --> 0:14:53,000
over the next decade?

308
0:14:54.987,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Ultimately, it's going to be up to these kids.

309
0:14:58.694,000 --> 0:15:01,000
They are the engineers of Rwanda and Africa.

310
0:15:02.997,000 --> 0:15:04,000
They are the engineers of our shared future.

311
0:15:07.326,000 --> 0:15:1,000
But the only way they can build that future is if we realize

312
0:15:11.108,000 --> 0:15:14,000
that world-changing companies can scale in Africa,

313
0:15:14.615,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and that disruptive technology can start here first.

314
0:15:18.822,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Thanks.

315
0:15:19.997,000 --> 0:15:22,000
(Applause)

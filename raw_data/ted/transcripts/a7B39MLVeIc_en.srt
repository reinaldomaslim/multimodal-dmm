1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I have had the distinct pleasure

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
of living inside two biospheres.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Of course we all here in this room live in Biosphere 1.

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I've also lived in Biosphere 2.

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And the wonderful thing about that is that I get to compare biospheres.

6
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And hopefully from that I get to learn something.

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So what did I learn? Well,

8
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
here I am inside Biosphere 2, making a pizza.

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So I am harvesting the wheat, in order to make the dough.

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And then of course I have to milk the goats

11
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and feed the goats in order to make the cheese.

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It took me four months in Biosphere 2 to make a pizza.

13
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Here in Biosphere 1, well it takes me about two minutes,

14
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because I pick up the phone and I call and say,

15
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
"Hey, can you deliver the pizza?"

16
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So Biosphere 2

17
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
was essentially a three-acre,

18
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
entirely sealed, miniature world

19
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that I lived in for two years and 20 minutes.

20
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Over the top it was sealed with steel and glass,

22
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
underneath it was sealed with a pan of steel --

23
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
essentially entirely sealed.

24
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
So we had our own miniature rainforest,

25
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a private beach with a coral reef.

26
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We had a savanna, a marsh, a desert.

27
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We had our own half-acre farm that we had to grow everything.

28
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And of course we had our human habitat, where we lived.

29
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Back in the mid-'80s when we were designing Biosphere 2,

30
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
we had to ask ourselves some pretty basic questions.

31
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I mean, what is a biosphere?

32
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Back then, yes, I guess we all know now

33
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth, right?

34
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Well, you have to get a little more specific than that if you're going to build one.

35
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And so we decided that what it really is

36
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is that it is entirely materially closed --

37
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that is, nothing goes in or out at all, no material --

38
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and energetically open,

39
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
which is essentially what planet Earth is.

40
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This is a chamber that was 1/400th the size of Biosphere 2

41
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that we called our Test Module.

42
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And the very first day that this fellow, John Allen,

43
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
walked in, to spend a couple of days in there

44
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
with all the plants and animals and bacteria that we'd put in there

45
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to hopefully keep him alive,

46
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the doctors were incredibly concerned

47
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that he was going to succumb to some dreadful toxin,

48
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
or that his lungs were going to get choked with bacteria or something, fungus.

49
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
But of course none of that happened.

50
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And over the ensuing few years,

51
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
there were great sagas about designing Biosphere 2.

52
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But by 1991

53
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
we finally had this thing built.

54
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And it was time for us to go in

55
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and give it a go.

56
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We needed to know,

57
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
is life this malleable?

58
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Can you take this biosphere,

59
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that has evolved on a planetary scale,

60
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and jam it into a little bottle,

61
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and will it survive?

62
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Big questions.

63
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And we wanted to know this both for being able to go somewhere else

64
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in the universe -- if we were going to go to Mars, for instance,

65
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
would we take a biosphere with us, to live in it?

66
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We also wanted to know so we can understand more about

67
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the Earth that we all live in.

68
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Well, in 1991 it was finally time for us to go in

69
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and try out this baby.

70
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Let's take it on a maiden voyage.

71
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Will it work? Or will something happen

72
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that we can't understand and we can't fix,

73
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
thereby negating the concept of man-made biospheres?

74
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So eight of us went in: four men and four women.

75
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
More on that later.

76
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And this is the world that we lived in.

78
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So, on the top, we had

79
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
these beautiful rainforests and an ocean,

80
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and underneath we had all this technosphere, we called it,

81
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
which is where all the pumps and the valves

82
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and the water tanks and the air handlers, and all of that.

83
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
One of the Biospherians called it "garden of Eden

84
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
on top of an aircraft carrier."

85
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And then also we had the human habitat of course,

86
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
with the laboratories, and all of that.

87
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
This is the agriculture.

88
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
It was essentially an organic farm.

89
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The day I walked into Biosphere 2,

90
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I was, for the first time,

91
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
breathing a completely different atmosphere

92
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
than everybody else in the world,

93
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
except seven other people.

94
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
At that moment I became part of that biosphere.

95
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And I don't mean that in an abstract sense;

96
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I mean it rather literally.

97
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
When I breathed out, my CO2

98
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
fed the sweet potatoes that I was growing.

99
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And we ate an awful lot of the sweet potatoes.

100
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And those sweet potatoes

102
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
became part of me.

103
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
In fact, we ate so many sweet potatoes

104
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I became orange with sweet potato.

105
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I literally was eating the same carbon over and over again.

106
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I was eating myself in some strange sort of bizarre way.

107
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
When it came to our atmosphere, however,

108
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
it wasn't that much of a joke over the long term,

109
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because it turned out that we were losing oxygen, quite a lot of oxygen.

110
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And we knew that we were losing CO2.

111
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And so we were working to sequester carbon.

112
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Good lord -- we know that term now.

113
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
We were growing plants like crazy.

114
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
We were taking their biomass, storing them in the basement,

115
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
growing plants, going around, around, around,

116
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
trying to take all of that carbon out of the atmosphere.

117
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We were trying to stop carbon from going into the atmosphere.

118
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We stopped irrigating our soil, as much as we could.

119
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We stopped tilling, so that we could prevent greenhouse gasses from going into the air.

120
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But our oxygen was going down faster

121
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
than our CO2 was going up, which was quite unexpected,

122
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
because we had seen them going in tandem in the test module.

123
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And it was like playing atomic hide-and-seek.

124
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We had lost seven tons of oxygen.

125
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And we had no clue where it was.

126
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And I tell you, when you lose a lot of oxygen --

127
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and our oxygen went down quite far;

128
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
it went from 21 percent down to 14.2 percent --

129
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
my goodness, do you feel dreadful.

130
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I mean we were dragging ourselves around the Biosphere.

131
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And we had sleep apnea at night.

132
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So you'd wake up gasping with breath,

133
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
because your blood chemistry has changed.

134
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And that you literally do that. You stop breathing and then you -- (Gasps) --

135
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
take a breath and it wakes you up. And it's very irritating.

136
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And everybody outside thought we were dying.

137
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I mean, the media was making it sound like were were dying.

138
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And I had to call up my mother every other day saying, "No, Mum, it's fine, fine.

139
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We're not dead. We're fine. We're fine."

140
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And the doctor was, in fact, checking us

141
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to make sure we were, in fact, fine.

142
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But in fact he was the person who was most susceptible to the oxygen.

143
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And one day he couldn't add up a line of figures.

144
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And it was time for us to put oxygen in.

145
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And you might think, well,

146
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
"Boy, your life support system

147
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
was failing you. Wasn't that dreadful?"

148
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Yes. In a sense it was terrifying.

149
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Except that I knew I could walk out the airlock door

150
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
at any time, if it really got bad,

151
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
though who was going to say, "I can't take it anymore!"?

152
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Not me, that was for sure.

153
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But on the other hand, it was the scientific gold of the project,

154
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
because we could really crank this baby up,

155
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
as a scientific tool,

156
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and see if we could, in fact, find

157
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
where those seven tons of oxygen had gone.

158
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And we did indeed find it.

159
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And we found it in the concrete.

160
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Essentially it had done something very simple.

161
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We had put too much carbon in the soil in the form of compost.

162
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It broke down; it took oxygen out of the air;

163
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
it put CO2 into the air; and it went into the concrete.

164
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Pretty straightforward really.

165
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So at the end of the two years

166
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
when we came out, we were elated,

167
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
because, in fact, although you might say

168
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
we had discovered something that was quite "uhh,"

169
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
when your oxygen is going down,

170
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
stopped working, essentially, in your life support system,

171
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that's a very bad failure.

172
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Except that we knew what it was. And we knew how to fix it.

173
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And nothing else emerged

174
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that really was as serious as that.

175
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And we proved the concept, more or less.

176
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
People, on the other hand, was a different subject.

177
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We were -- yeah I don't know that we were fixable.

178
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
We all went quite nuts, I will say.

179
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And the day I came out of Biosphere 2,

180
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I was thrilled I was going to see all my family and my friends.

181
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
For two years I'd been seeing people through the glass.

182
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And everybody ran up to me.

183
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And I recoiled. They stank!

184
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
People stink!

185
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
We stink of hairspray and underarm deodorant,

186
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and all kinds of stuff.

187
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now we had stuff inside Biosphere to keep ourselves clean,

188
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but nothing with perfume.

189
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And boy do we stink out here.

190
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Not only that,

191
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but I lost touch of where my food came from.

192
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I had been growing all my own food.

193
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
I had no idea what was in my food, where it came from.

194
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I didn't even recognize half the names in most of the food that I was eating.

195
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
In fact, I would stand for hours in the aisles of shops,

196
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
reading all the names on all of the things.

197
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
People must have thought I was nuts.

198
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
It was really quite astonishing.

199
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And I slowly lost track

200
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
of where I was in this big biosphere, in this big biosphere that we all live in.

201
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
In Biosphere 2 I totally understood

202
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
that I had a huge impact on my biosphere, everyday,

203
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and it had an impact on me,

204
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
very viscerally, very literally.

205
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So I went about my business:

206
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
Paragon Space Development Corporation,

207
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere,

208
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
because I had nothing else to do.

209
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And one of the things we did was

210
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
try to figure out: how small can you make these biospheres,

211
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and what can you do with them?

212
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And so we sent one onto the Mir Space Station.

213
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station,

214
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
for 16 months, where we managed to produce

215
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the first organisms to go through

216
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
complete multiple life cycles in space --

217
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
really pushing the envelope

218
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
of understanding how malleable

219
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
our life systems are.

220
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And I'm also proud to announce

221
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that you're getting a sneak preview -- on Friday we're going to announce

222
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that we're actually forming a team

223
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
to develop a system to grow plants on the Moon,

224
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
which is going to be pretty fun.

225
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And the legacy of that is a system that we were designing:

226
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
an entirely sealed system to grow plants to grow on Mars.

227
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And part of that is that we had to model

228
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
very rapid circulation of CO2

229
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and oxygen and water through this plant system.

230
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
As a result of that modeling

231
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I ended up in all places,

232
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in Eritrea, in the Horn of Africa.

233
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Eritrea, formerly part of Ethiopia,

234
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
is one of those places that is astonishingly beautiful,

235
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
incredibly stark, and I have no understanding

236
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
of how people eke out a living there.

237
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It is so dry.

238
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
This is what I saw.

239
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But this is also what I saw.

240
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I saw a company that had

241
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
taken seawater

242
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and sand, and they were growing

243
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
a kind of crop that will grow on pure salt water without having to treat it.

244
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And it will produce a food crop.

245
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
In this case it was oilseed.

246
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It was astonishing. They were also producing mangroves

247
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
in a plantation.

248
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And the mangroves were providing wood

249
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and honey and leaves for the animals,

250
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
so that they could produce milk and whatnot,

251
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
like we had in the Biosphere.

252
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And all of it was coming from this: shrimp farms.

253
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth,

254
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
frankly, from an environmental point of view.

255
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean.

256
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
They also pollute their next-door neighbors.

257
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So they're all shitting each other's ponds, quite literally.

258
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And what this project was doing

259
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
was taking the effluent of these,

260
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and turning them into all of this food.

261
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
They were literally turning pollution into abundance for a desert people.

262
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
They had created an industrial ecosystem, of a sense.

263
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I was there because I was actually modeling the mangrove portion

264
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
for a carbon credit program, under the U.N.

265
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Kyoto Protocol system.

266
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And as I was modeling this mangrove swamp,

267
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I was thinking to myself, "How do you put a box around this?"

268
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
When I'm modeling a plant in a box, literally,

269
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I know where to draw the boundary.

270
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
In a mangrove forest like this I have no idea.

271
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Well, of course you have to draw the boundary around the whole of the Earth.

272
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And understand its interactions with the entire Earth.

273
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And put your project in that context.

274
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Around the world today we're seeing an incredible transformation,

275
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
from what I would call a biocidal species,

276
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
one that -- whether we intentionally or unintentionally --

277
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
have designed our systems to kill life, a lot of the time.

278
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
This is in fact, this beautiful photograph,

279
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
is in fact over the Amazon.

280
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And here the light green are areas of massive deforestation.

281
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And those beautiful wispy clouds

282
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
are, in fact, fires, human-made fires.

283
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
We're in the process of transforming from this,

284
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
to what I would call a biophilic society,

285
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
one where we learn to nurture society.

286
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Now it may not seem like it, but we are.

287
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
It is happening all across the world,

288
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
in every kind of walk of life,

289
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and every kind of career

290
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and industry that you can think of.

291
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And I think often times people get lost in that.

292
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
They go, "But how can I possibly find my way in that?

293
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It's such a huge subject."

294
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And I would say that the small stuff counts. It really does.

295
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
This is the story of a rake in my backyard.

296
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
This was my backyard,

297
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
very early on, when I bought my property.

298
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And in Arizona, of course, everybody puts gravel down.

299
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And they like to keep everything beautifully raked. And they keep all the leaves away.

300
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And on Sunday morning the neighbors leaf blower comes out,

301
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and I want to throttle them.

302
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It's a certain type of aesthetic.

303
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
We're very uncomfortable with untidiness.

304
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And I threw away my rake.

305
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And I let all of the leaves fall from the trees that I have on my property.

306
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And over time, essentially what have I been doing?

307
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I've been building topsoil.

308
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And so now all the birds come in. And I have hawks.

309
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And I have an oasis.

310
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
This is what happens every spring. For six weeks,

311
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
six to eight weeks, I have this flush of green oasis.

312
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
This is actually in a riparian area.

313
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And all of Tucson could be like this

314
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
if everybody would just revolt and throw away the rake.

315
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
The small stuff counts.

316
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
The Industrial Revolution -- and Prometheus --

317
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
has given us this, the ability to light up the world.

318
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
It has also given us this,

319
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
the ability to look at the world from the outside.

320
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Now we may not all have

321
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
another biosphere that we can run to,

322
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and compare it to this biosphere.

323
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
But we can look at the world,

324
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and try to understand where we are in its context,

325
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and how we choose to interact with it.

326
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And if you lose where you are in your biosphere,

327
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
or are perhaps having a difficulty connecting

328
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
with where you are in the biosphere,

329
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I would say to you,

330
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
take a deep breath.

331
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
The yogis had it right.

332
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Breath does, in fact, connect us all

333
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
in a very literal way.

334
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Take a breath now.

335
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And as you breathe, think

336
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
about what is in your breath.

337
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
There perhaps is the CO2 from the person sitting next-door to you.

338
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Maybe there is a little bit of oxygen

339
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
from some algae on the beach not far from here.

340
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
It also connects us in time.

341
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
There may be some carbon in your breath

342
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
from the dinosaurs.

343
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
There could also be carbon that you are exhaling now

344
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that will be in the breath

345
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
of your great-great-great-grandchildren.

346
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Thank you. (Applause)

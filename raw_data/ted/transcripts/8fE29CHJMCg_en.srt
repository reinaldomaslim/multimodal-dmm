0:00:15.805,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Two years ago, after having served four years

3
0:00:18.23,000 --> 0:00:19,000
in the United States Marine Corps

4
0:00:19.89,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and deployments to both Iraq and Afghanistan,

5
0:00:22.25,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I found myself in Port-au-Prince, leading a team

6
0:00:25.199,000 --> 0:00:27,000
of veterans and medical professionals

7
0:00:27.436,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in some of the hardest-hit areas of that city,

8
0:00:29.869,000 --> 0:00:3,000
three days after the earthquake.

9
0:00:31.395,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We were going to the places that nobody else wanted to go,

10
0:00:33.558,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the places nobody else could go, and after three weeks,

11
0:00:37.089,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we realized something. Military veterans

12
0:00:40.095,000 --> 0:00:43,000
are very, very good at disaster response.

13
0:00:43.108,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And coming home, my cofounder and I,

14
0:00:45.583,000 --> 0:00:48,000
we looked at it, and we said, there are two problems.

15
0:00:48.846,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The first problem is there's inadequate disaster response.

16
0:00:51.852,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It's slow. It's antiquated. It's not using the best technology,

17
0:00:55.166,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and it's not using the best people.

18
0:00:57.547,000 --> 0:00:59,000
The second problem that we became aware of

19
0:00:59.752,000 --> 0:01:01,000
was a very inadequate veteran reintegration,

20
0:01:02.23,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and this is a topic that is front page news right now

21
0:01:04.375,000 --> 0:01:06,000
as veterans are coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan,

22
0:01:06.536,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and they're struggling to reintegrate into civilian life.

23
0:01:09.686,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And we sat here and we looked at these two problems,

24
0:01:11.566,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and finally we came to a realization. These aren't problems.

25
0:01:14.3,000 --> 0:01:17,000
These are actually solutions. And what do I mean by that?

26
0:01:17.762,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Well, we can use disaster response as an opportunity

27
0:01:20.832,000 --> 0:01:22,000
for service for the veterans coming home.

28
0:01:23.233,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Recent surveys show that 92 percent of veterans want

29
0:01:25.733,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to continue their service when they take off their uniform.

30
0:01:27.973,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And we can use veterans to improve disaster response.

31
0:01:31.643,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Now on the surface, this makes a lot of sense, and in 2010,

32
0:01:34.706,000 --> 0:01:37,000
we responded to the tsunami in Chile,

33
0:01:37.715,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the floods in Pakistan, we sent training teams to the Thai-Burma border.

34
0:01:41.609,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But it was earlier this year, when one of our

35
0:01:44.241,000 --> 0:01:48,000
original members caused us to shift focus in the organization.

36
0:01:48.346,000 --> 0:01:5,000
This is Clay Hunt. Clay was a Marine with me.

37
0:01:51.091,000 --> 0:01:53,000
We served together in Iraq and Afghanistan.

38
0:01:53.417,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Clay was with us in Port-au-Prince. He was also with us in Chile.

39
0:01:57.351,000 --> 0:02:,000
Earlier this year, in March, Clay took his own life.

40
0:02:01.237,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This was a tragedy, but it really forced us

41
0:02:03.967,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to refocus what it is that we were doing.

42
0:02:07.245,000 --> 0:02:1,000
You know, Clay didn't kill himself because of what happened

43
0:02:10.709,000 --> 0:02:12,000
in Iraq and Afghanistan. Clay killed himself

44
0:02:13.317,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because of what he lost when he came home.

45
0:02:16.466,000 --> 0:02:19,000
He lost purpose. He lost his community.

46
0:02:19.931,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And perhaps most tragically, he lost his self-worth.

47
0:02:24.366,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And so, as we evaluated, and as the dust settled

48
0:02:27.54,000 --> 0:02:31,000
from this tragedy, we realized that, of those two problems --

49
0:02:31.854,000 --> 0:02:34,000
in the initial iteration of our organization,

50
0:02:35.094,000 --> 0:02:37,000
we were a disaster response organization that was using

51
0:02:37.967,000 --> 0:02:39,000
veteran service. We had a lot of success,

52
0:02:40.206,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and we really felt like we were changing the disaster response paradigm.

53
0:02:44.419,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But after Clay, we shifted that focus, and suddenly,

54
0:02:47.828,000 --> 0:02:49,000
now moving forward, we see ourselves

55
0:02:50.304,000 --> 0:02:54,000
as a veteran service organization that's using disaster response.

56
0:02:55.197,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Because we think that we can give that purpose

57
0:02:57.807,000 --> 0:03:,000
and that community and that self-worth back to the veteran.

58
0:03:00.988,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And tornadoes in Tuscaloosa and Joplin, and then later

59
0:03:03.219,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Hurricane Irene, gave us an opportunity to look at that.

60
0:03:06.92,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Now I want you to imagine for a second an 18-year-old boy

61
0:03:10.329,000 --> 0:03:12,000
who graduates from high school in Kansas City, Missouri.

62
0:03:12.805,000 --> 0:03:14,000
He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.

63
0:03:15.369,000 --> 0:03:16,000
They send him to Iraq.

64
0:03:17.041,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Every day he leaves the wire with a mission.

65
0:03:19.768,000 --> 0:03:22,000
That mission is to defend the freedom of the family that he left at home.

66
0:03:23.372,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's to keep the men around him alive.

67
0:03:25.461,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It's to pacify the village that he works in.

68
0:03:27.647,000 --> 0:03:3,000
He's got a purpose. But he comes home [to] Kansas City, Missouri,

69
0:03:31.311,000 --> 0:03:33,000
maybe he goes to college, maybe he's got a job,

70
0:03:33.909,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but he doesn't have that same sense of purpose.

71
0:03:36.273,000 --> 0:03:38,000
You give him a chainsaw. You send him to Joplin, Missouri

72
0:03:38.413,000 --> 0:03:4,000
after a tornado, he regains that.

73
0:03:40.773,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Going back, that same 18-year-old boy graduates from high school

74
0:03:43.822,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in Kansas City, Missouri, joins the Army,

75
0:03:45.767,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the Army gives him a rifle, they send him to Iraq.

76
0:03:48.475,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Every day he looks into the same sets of eyes around him.

77
0:03:51.382,000 --> 0:03:54,000
He leaves the wire. He knows that those people have his back.

78
0:03:54.543,000 --> 0:03:56,000
He's slept in the same sand. They've lived together.

79
0:03:56.726,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They've eaten together. They've bled together.

80
0:03:59.425,000 --> 0:04:01,000
He goes home to Kansas City, Missouri.

81
0:04:01.823,000 --> 0:04:04,000
He gets out of the military. He takes his uniform off.

82
0:04:04.883,000 --> 0:04:05,000
He doesn't have that community anymore.

83
0:04:06.222,000 --> 0:04:09,000
But you drop 25 of those veterans in Joplin, Missouri,

84
0:04:09.456,000 --> 0:04:11,000
they get that sense of community back.

85
0:04:11.947,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Again, you have an 18-year-old boy who graduates

86
0:04:14.386,000 --> 0:04:15,000
high school in Kansas City.

87
0:04:16.042,000 --> 0:04:17,000
He joins the Army. The Army gives him a rifle.

88
0:04:17.758,000 --> 0:04:18,000
They send him to Iraq.

89
0:04:19.297,000 --> 0:04:23,000
They pin a medal on his chest. He goes home to a ticker tape parade.

90
0:04:23.652,000 --> 0:04:25,000
He takes the uniform off. He's no longer Sergeant Jones

91
0:04:26.07,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in his community. He's now Dave from Kansas City.

92
0:04:28.683,000 --> 0:04:3,000
He doesn't have that same self-worth.

93
0:04:30.956,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But you send him to Joplin after a tornado,

94
0:04:33.568,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and somebody once again is walking up to him

95
0:04:35.388,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and shaking their hand and thanking them for their service,

96
0:04:37.762,000 --> 0:04:39,000
now they have self-worth again.

97
0:04:40.079,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I think it's very important, because right now

98
0:04:42.4,000 --> 0:04:43,000
somebody needs to step up,

99
0:04:44.163,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and this generation of veterans has the opportunity

100
0:04:46.114,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to do that if they are given the chance.

101
0:04:48.399,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.965,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I could never have imagined

2
0:00:15.531,000 --> 0:00:18,000
that a 19-year-old suicide bomber

3
0:00:19.507,000 --> 0:00:22,000
would actually teach me a valuable lesson.

4
0:00:24.64,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But he did.

5
0:00:26.64,000 --> 0:00:3,000
He taught me to never presume anything

6
0:00:31.283,000 --> 0:00:34,000
about anyone you don't know.

7
0:00:36.414,000 --> 0:00:4,000
On a Thursday morning in July 2005,

8
0:00:40.567,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the bomber and I, unknowingly,

9
0:00:43.649,000 --> 0:00:47,000
boarded the same train carriage at the same time,

10
0:00:48.22,000 --> 0:00:52,000
standing, apparently, just feet apart.

11
0:00:54.345,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I didn't see him.

12
0:00:56.185,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Actually, I didn't see anyone.

13
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:,000
You know not to look at anyone on the Tube,

14
0:01:00.611,000 --> 0:01:03,000
but I guess he saw me.

15
0:01:04.916,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I guess he looked at all of us,

16
0:01:08.687,000 --> 0:01:12,000
as his hand hovered over the detonation switch.

17
0:01:14.439,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I've often wondered: What was he thinking?

18
0:01:18.908,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Especially in those final seconds.

19
0:01:24.765,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I know it wasn't personal.

20
0:01:26.977,000 --> 0:01:3,000
He didn't set out to kill or maim me, Gill Hicks.

21
0:01:31.018,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I mean -- he didn't know me.

22
0:01:33.758,000 --> 0:01:34,000
No.

23
0:01:35.666,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Instead, he gave me

24
0:01:38.636,000 --> 0:01:42,000
an unwarranted and an unwanted label.

25
0:01:44.272,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I had become the enemy.

26
0:01:49.39,000 --> 0:01:52,000
To him, I was the "other,"

27
0:01:52.99,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the "them," as opposed to "us."

28
0:01:57.581,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The label "enemy" allowed him to dehumanize us.

29
0:02:03.674,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It allowed him to push that button.

30
0:02:07.339,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And he wasn't selective.

31
0:02:10.875,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Twenty-six precious lives were taken in my carriage alone,

32
0:02:17.042,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and I was almost one of them.

33
0:02:20.855,000 --> 0:02:22,000
In the time it takes to draw a breath,

34
0:02:23.62,000 --> 0:02:26,000
we were plunged into a darkness so immense

35
0:02:27.314,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that it was almost tangible;

36
0:02:29.72,000 --> 0:02:33,000
what I imagine wading through tar might be like.

37
0:02:35.398,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We didn't know we were the enemy.

38
0:02:38.321,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We were just a bunch of commuters who, minutes earlier,

39
0:02:42.403,000 --> 0:02:44,000
had followed the Tube etiquette:

40
0:02:44.911,000 --> 0:02:46,000
no direct eye contact,

41
0:02:47.141,000 --> 0:02:48,000
no talking

42
0:02:48.894,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and absolutely no conversation.

43
0:02:53.948,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But in the lifting of the darkness,

44
0:02:57.776,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we were reaching out.

45
0:03:00.179,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We were helping each other.

46
0:03:02.808,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We were calling out our names,

47
0:03:05.293,000 --> 0:03:07,000
a little bit like a roll call,

48
0:03:08.389,000 --> 0:03:1,000
waiting for responses.

49
0:03:12.559,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"I'm Gill. I'm here.

50
0:03:17.111,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I'm alive.

51
0:03:20.279,000 --> 0:03:21,000
OK."

52
0:03:23.697,000 --> 0:03:24,000
"I'm Gill.

53
0:03:25.679,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Here.

54
0:03:28.318,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Alive.

55
0:03:31.329,000 --> 0:03:32,000
OK."

56
0:03:35.096,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I didn't know Alison.

57
0:03:38.399,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But I listened for her check-ins every few minutes.

58
0:03:43.34,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I didn't know Richard.

59
0:03:45.839,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But it mattered to me that he survived.

60
0:03:50.752,000 --> 0:03:51,000
All I shared with them

61
0:03:52.57,000 --> 0:03:53,000
was my first name.

62
0:03:55.013,000 --> 0:03:56,000
They didn't know

63
0:03:56.188,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that I was a head of a department at the Design Council.

64
0:04:01.185,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And here is my beloved briefcase,

65
0:04:04.766,000 --> 0:04:06,000
also rescued from that morning.

66
0:04:08.479,000 --> 0:04:11,000
They didn't know that I published architecture and design journals,

67
0:04:12.469,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that I was a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts,

68
0:04:15.809,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that I wore black --

69
0:04:18.695,000 --> 0:04:19,000
still do --

70
0:04:20.566,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that I smoked cigarillos.

71
0:04:23.888,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I don't smoke cigarillos anymore.

72
0:04:26.215,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I drank gin and I watched TED Talks,

73
0:04:30.423,000 --> 0:04:36,000
of course, never dreaming that one day I would be standing,

74
0:04:37.593,000 --> 0:04:39,000
balancing on prosthetic legs,

75
0:04:40.512,000 --> 0:04:41,000
giving a talk.

76
0:04:42.651,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I was a young Australian woman doing extraordinary things in London.

77
0:04:48.319,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And I wasn't ready for that all to end.

78
0:04:52.882,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I was so determined to survive

79
0:04:56.064,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that I used my scarf to tie tourniquets around the tops of my legs,

80
0:05:01.29,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I just shut everything and everyone out,

81
0:05:07.345,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to focus, to listen to myself,

82
0:05:10.629,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to be guided by instinct alone.

83
0:05:15.085,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I lowered my breathing rate.

84
0:05:17.847,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I elevated my thighs.

85
0:05:19.651,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I held myself upright

86
0:05:21.343,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and I fought the urge to close my eyes.

87
0:05:26.681,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I held on for almost an hour,

88
0:05:31.03,000 --> 0:05:35,000
an hour to contemplate the whole of my life

89
0:05:35.435,000 --> 0:05:36,000
up until this point.

90
0:05:39.199,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Perhaps I should have done more.

91
0:05:43.223,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Perhaps I could have lived more, seen more.

92
0:05:46.451,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Maybe I should have gone running, dancing, taken up yoga.

93
0:05:52.317,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But my priority and my focus was always my work.

94
0:05:57.279,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I lived to work.

95
0:05:59.73,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Who I was on my business card

96
0:06:02.561,000 --> 0:06:03,000
mattered to me.

97
0:06:05.688,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But it didn't matter down in that tunnel.

98
0:06:11.226,000 --> 0:06:15,000
By the time I felt that first touch

99
0:06:15.72,000 --> 0:06:17,000
from one of my rescuers,

100
0:06:18.472,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I was unable to speak,

101
0:06:20.613,000 --> 0:06:24,000
unable to say even a small word, like "Gill."

102
0:06:27.183,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I surrendered my body to them.

103
0:06:29.942,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I had done all I possibly could,

104
0:06:32.839,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and now I was in their hands.

105
0:06:39.091,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I understood

106
0:06:41.283,000 --> 0:06:47,000
just who and what humanity really is,

107
0:06:47.972,000 --> 0:06:5,000
when I first saw the ID tag

108
0:06:51.195,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that was given to me when I was admitted to hospital.

109
0:06:54.478,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And it read:

110
0:06:56.218,000 --> 0:07:01,000
"One unknown estimated female."

111
0:07:03.162,000 --> 0:07:07,000
One unknown estimated female.

112
0:07:09.004,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Those four words were my gift.

113
0:07:13.125,000 --> 0:07:15,000
What they told me very clearly

114
0:07:15.896,000 --> 0:07:17,000
was that my life was saved,

115
0:07:18.625,000 --> 0:07:21,000
purely because I was a human being.

116
0:07:22.61,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Difference of any kind made no difference

117
0:07:26.818,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to the extraordinary lengths that the rescuers were prepared to go

118
0:07:32.129,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to save my life,

119
0:07:34.458,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to save as many unknowns as they could,

120
0:07:37.205,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and putting their own lives at risk.

121
0:07:40.405,000 --> 0:07:44,000
To them, it didn't matter if I was rich or poor,

122
0:07:45.298,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the color of my skin,

123
0:07:47.463,000 --> 0:07:48,000
whether I was male or female,

124
0:07:49.049,000 --> 0:07:5,000
my sexual orientation,

125
0:07:51.613,000 --> 0:07:52,000
who I voted for,

126
0:07:53.24,000 --> 0:07:54,000
whether I was educated,

127
0:07:54.782,000 --> 0:07:57,000
if I had a faith or no faith at all.

128
0:07:59.409,000 --> 0:08:,000
Nothing mattered

129
0:08:01.377,000 --> 0:08:05,000
other than I was a precious human life.

130
0:08:07.881,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I see myself as a living fact.

131
0:08:12.223,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I am proof

132
0:08:14.276,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that unconditional love and respect can not only save,

133
0:08:21.028,000 --> 0:08:24,000
but it can transform lives.

134
0:08:25.226,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Here is a wonderful image of one of my rescuers, Andy, and I

135
0:08:29.718,000 --> 0:08:3,000
taken just last year.

136
0:08:32.08,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Ten years after the event,

137
0:08:34.665,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and here we are, arm in arm.

138
0:08:39.559,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Throughout all the chaos,

139
0:08:41.701,000 --> 0:08:43,000
my hand was held tightly.

140
0:08:45.2,000 --> 0:08:47,000
My face was stroked gently.

141
0:08:49.161,000 --> 0:08:5,000
What did I feel?

142
0:08:51.541,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I felt loved.

143
0:08:53.685,000 --> 0:08:57,000
What's shielded me from hatred and wanting retribution,

144
0:08:58.526,000 --> 0:09:,000
what's given me the courage to say:

145
0:09:01.539,000 --> 0:09:03,000
this ends with me

146
0:09:06.006,000 --> 0:09:07,000
is love.

147
0:09:08.585,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I was loved.

148
0:09:13.234,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I believe the potential for widespread positive change

149
0:09:19.523,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is absolutely enormous

150
0:09:21.127,000 --> 0:09:23,000
because I know what we're capable of.

151
0:09:24.055,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I know the brilliance of humanity.

152
0:09:27.93,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So this leaves me with some pretty big things to ponder

153
0:09:31.864,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and some questions for us all to consider:

154
0:09:36.512,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Is what unites us not far greater than what can ever divide?

155
0:09:43.663,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Does it have to take a tragedy or a disaster

156
0:09:47.477,000 --> 0:09:51,000
for us to feel deeply connected as one species,

157
0:09:52.902,000 --> 0:09:53,000
as human beings?

158
0:09:55.755,000 --> 0:10:,000
And when will we embrace the wisdom of our era

159
0:10:01.764,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to rise above mere tolerance

160
0:10:05.931,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and move to an acceptance

161
0:10:08.892,000 --> 0:10:13,000
for all who are only a label until we know them?

162
0:10:15.55,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Thank you.

163
0:10:16.734,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Applause)

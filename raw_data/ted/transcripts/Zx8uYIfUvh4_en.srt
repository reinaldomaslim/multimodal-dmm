1
0:00:16.769,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's the fifth time I stand on this shore,

2
0:00:21.725,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the Cuban shore,

3
0:00:23.801,000 --> 0:00:26,000
looking out at that distant horizon,

4
0:00:28.389,000 --> 0:00:3,000
believing, again,

5
0:00:31.887,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that I'm going to make it all the way

6
0:00:34.454,000 --> 0:00:38,000
across that vast, dangerous wilderness of an ocean.

7
0:00:39.547,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Not only have I tried four times,

8
0:00:41.295,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but the greatest swimmers in the world have been trying since 1950,

9
0:00:45.847,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and it's still never been done.

10
0:00:49.378,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The team is proud of our four attempts.

11
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It's an expedition of some 30 people.

12
0:00:55.884,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Bonnie is my best friend and head handler,

13
0:01:00.484,000 --> 0:01:02,000
who somehow summons will,

14
0:01:03.148,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that last drop of will within me, when I think it's gone,

15
0:01:06.931,000 --> 0:01:08,000
after many, many hours and days out there.

16
0:01:10.526,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The shark experts are the best in the world --

17
0:01:12.916,000 --> 0:01:14,000
large predators below.

18
0:01:16.694,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The box jellyfish, the deadliest venom in all of the ocean,

19
0:01:21.527,000 --> 0:01:22,000
is in these waters,

20
0:01:23.127,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I have come close to dying from them on a previous attempt.

21
0:01:28.12,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The conditions themselves,

22
0:01:30.556,000 --> 0:01:34,000
besides the sheer distance of over 100 miles in the open ocean --

23
0:01:35.849,000 --> 0:01:39,000
the currents and whirling eddies and the Gulf Stream itself,

24
0:01:39.886,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the most unpredictable of all of the planet Earth.

25
0:01:45.639,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And by the way -- it's amusing to me

26
0:01:49.815,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that journalists and people, before these attempts, often ask me,

27
0:01:54.489,000 --> 0:01:57,000
"Well, are you going to go with any boats or any people or anything?"

28
0:01:57.917,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:59.404,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I'm thinking, what are they imagining?

30
0:02:01.564,000 --> 0:02:04,000
That I'll just sort of do some celestial navigation --

31
0:02:04.608,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

32
0:02:05.739,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And carry a bowie knife in my mouth,

33
0:02:09.267,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and I'll hunt fish and skin them alive and eat them,

34
0:02:12.83,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and maybe drag a desalinization plant behind me for fresh water.

35
0:02:17.601,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:22.331,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Yes, I have a team.

37
0:02:23.612,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:26.139,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And the team is expert,

39
0:02:28.442,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and the team is courageous,

40
0:02:30.614,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and brimming with innovation and scientific discovery,

41
0:02:34.8,000 --> 0:02:38,000
as is true of any major expedition on the planet.

42
0:02:40.035,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And we've been on a journey.

43
0:02:42.96,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And the debate has raged, hasn't it,

44
0:02:45.203,000 --> 0:02:46,000
since the Greeks,

45
0:02:46.583,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of isn't it what it's all about?

46
0:02:49.446,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Isn't life about the journey, not really the destination?

47
0:02:54.415,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And here we've been on this journey,

48
0:02:56.154,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and the truth is, it's been thrilling.

49
0:02:58.426,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We haven't reached that other shore,

50
0:03:00.197,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and still, our sense of pride and commitment,

51
0:03:03.949,000 --> 0:03:05,000
unwavering commitment.

52
0:03:06.112,000 --> 0:03:09,000
When I turned 60, the dream was still alive

53
0:03:10.566,000 --> 0:03:14,000
from having tried this in my 20s -- dreamed it and imagined it.

54
0:03:16.303,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The most famous body of water on the Earth today, I imagine,

55
0:03:20.932,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Cuba to Florida.

56
0:03:22.894,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And it was deep. It was deep in my soul.

57
0:03:27.121,000 --> 0:03:28,000
When I turned 60,

58
0:03:29.411,000 --> 0:03:31,000
it wasn't so much about the athletic accomplishment,

59
0:03:32.064,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it wasn't the ego of "I want to be the first."

60
0:03:35.379,000 --> 0:03:37,000
That's always there and it's undeniable.

61
0:03:38.101,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But it was deeper.

62
0:03:39.898,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It was "how much life is there left?"

63
0:03:41.955,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Let's face it -- we're all on a one-way street, aren't we?

64
0:03:45.219,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And what are we going to do?

65
0:03:46.786,000 --> 0:03:5,000
What are we going to do as we go forward, to have no regrets looking back?

66
0:03:52.194,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And all this past year in training,

67
0:03:54.856,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I had that Teddy Roosevelt quote

68
0:03:57.567,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to paraphrase it, floating around in my brain.

69
0:03:59.844,000 --> 0:04:,000
It says, "You go ahead.

70
0:04:01.683,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You go ahead and sit back in your comfortable chair

71
0:04:04.803,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and you be the critic, you be the observer,

72
0:04:08.775,000 --> 0:04:11,000
while the brave one gets in the ring and engages

73
0:04:12.943,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and gets bloody and gets dirty and fails over and over and over again,

74
0:04:17.424,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but yet isn't afraid and isn't timid and lives life in a bold way."

75
0:04:22.944,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And so of course I want to make it across.

76
0:04:25.401,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It is the goal, and I should be so shallow to say that this year,

77
0:04:30.673,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the destination was even sweeter than the journey.

78
0:04:34.198,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:36.125,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Applause)

80
0:04:39.557,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But the journey itself was worthwhile taking.

81
0:04:42.839,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And at this point, by this summer,

82
0:04:45.281,000 --> 0:04:48,000
everybody -- scientists, sports scientists,

83
0:04:49.016,000 --> 0:04:52,000
endurance experts, neurologists,

84
0:04:53.319,000 --> 0:04:55,000
my own team, Bonnie --

85
0:04:57.755,000 --> 0:04:58,000
said it's impossible.

86
0:04:59.582,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It just simply can't be done, and Bonnie said to me,

87
0:05:02.154,000 --> 0:05:03,000
"But if you're going to take the journey,

88
0:05:04.164,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I'm going to see you through to the end of it,

89
0:05:06.379,000 --> 0:05:07,000
so I'll be there."

90
0:05:07.566,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And now we're there.

91
0:05:12.132,000 --> 0:05:14,000
As we're looking out, kind of a surreal moment

92
0:05:15.029,000 --> 0:05:16,000
before the first stroke,

93
0:05:16.357,000 --> 0:05:18,000
standing on the rocks at Marina Hemingway,

94
0:05:18.883,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the Cuban flag is flying above,

95
0:05:21.576,000 --> 0:05:25,000
all my team is out in their boats, hands up in the air,

96
0:05:25.85,000 --> 0:05:26,000
"We're here!

97
0:05:27.914,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We're here for you!"

98
0:05:31.017,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Bonnie and I look at each other and say,

99
0:05:33.13,000 --> 0:05:36,000
this year, the mantra is -- and I've been using it in training --

100
0:05:37.216,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Find a way.

101
0:05:39.137,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You have a dream

102
0:05:41.871,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and you have obstacles in front of you, as we all do.

103
0:05:44.886,000 --> 0:05:46,000
None of us ever get through this life

104
0:05:48.538,000 --> 0:05:49,000
without heartache,

105
0:05:52.058,000 --> 0:05:53,000
without turmoil,

106
0:05:54.379,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and if you believe and you have faith

107
0:05:57.197,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and you can get knocked down and get back up again

108
0:05:59.593,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and you believe in perseverance

109
0:06:02.518,000 --> 0:06:05,000
as a great human quality,

110
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you find your way.

111
0:06:07.473,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And Bonnie grabbed my shoulders,

112
0:06:09.118,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and she said, "Let's find our way to Florida."

113
0:06:13.374,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And we started, and for the next 53 hours,

114
0:06:15.947,000 --> 0:06:19,000
it was an intense, unforgettable life experience.

115
0:06:21.647,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The highs were high, the awe --

116
0:06:23.888,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I'm not a religious person, but I'll tell you,

117
0:06:26.237,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to be in the azure blue of the Gulf Stream

118
0:06:29.686,000 --> 0:06:3,000
as if, as you're breathing,

119
0:06:31.59,000 --> 0:06:35,000
you're looking down miles and miles and miles,

120
0:06:36.253,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to feel the majesty of this blue planet we live on --

121
0:06:41.186,000 --> 0:06:44,000
it's awe-inspiring.

122
0:06:45.055,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I have a playlist of about 85 songs,

123
0:06:47.557,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and especially in the middle of the night ...

124
0:06:49.694,000 --> 0:06:52,000
That night, because we use no lights -- lights attract jellyfish,

125
0:06:52.834,000 --> 0:06:53,000
lights attract sharks,

126
0:06:54.054,000 --> 0:06:56,000
lights attract baitfish that attract sharks,

127
0:06:56.439,000 --> 0:06:58,000
so we go in the pitch black of the night.

128
0:06:58.94,000 --> 0:07:,000
You've never seen black this black.

129
0:07:02.271,000 --> 0:07:04,000
You can't see the front of your hand,

130
0:07:04.357,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and the people on the boat, Bonnie and my team on the boat --

131
0:07:07.37,000 --> 0:07:09,000
they just hear the slapping of the arms,

132
0:07:09.427,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and they know where I am,

133
0:07:10.642,000 --> 0:07:11,000
because there's no visual at all.

134
0:07:12.584,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And I'm out there kind of tripping out on my little playlist.

135
0:07:16.721,000 --> 0:07:18,000
(Laughter)

136
0:07:19.249,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I've got tight rubber caps, I don't hear a thing.

137
0:07:22.317,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I've got goggles and I'm turning my head 50 times a minute,

138
0:07:25.458,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and I'm singing ...

139
0:07:27.5,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven

140
0:07:30.123,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Laughter)

141
0:07:31.734,000 --> 0:07:32,000
doo doo doo doo doo

142
0:07:33.44,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's easy if you try

143
0:07:36.284,000 --> 0:07:37,000
doo doo doo doo doo

144
0:07:37.512,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And I can sing that song a thousand times in a row.

145
0:07:40.07,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Laughter)

146
0:07:42.329,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Now there's a talent unto itself.

147
0:07:44.979,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:46.807,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Applause)

149
0:07:49.411,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And each time I get done with,

150
0:07:51.809,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Singing) Oh, you may say I'm a dreamer but I'm not the only one

151
0:07:58.627,000 --> 0:07:59,000
222.

152
0:08:01.57,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Singing) Imagine there's no heaven

153
0:08:04.03,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Laughter)

154
0:08:06.136,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And when I get through the end

155
0:08:07.675,000 --> 0:08:09,000
of a thousand of John Lennon's "Imagine,"

156
0:08:09.755,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I have swum nine hours and 45 minutes ...

157
0:08:12.783,000 --> 0:08:13,000
exactly.

158
0:08:13.982,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

159
0:08:16.403,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And then there are the crises.

160
0:08:18.379,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Of course there are.

161
0:08:20.957,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And the vomiting starts, the seawater -- you're not well.

162
0:08:24.299,000 --> 0:08:27,000
You're wearing a jellyfish mask for the ultimate protection.

163
0:08:27.932,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It's difficult to swim in.

164
0:08:29.415,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It's causing abrasions on the inside of the mouth,

165
0:08:32.073,000 --> 0:08:33,000
but the tentacles can't get you.

166
0:08:34.707,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And the hypothermia sets in.

167
0:08:37.292,000 --> 0:08:4,000
The water's 85 degrees, and yet you're losing weight

168
0:08:40.701,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and using calories.

169
0:08:42.044,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And as you come over toward the side of the boat --

170
0:08:44.506,000 --> 0:08:46,000
not allowed to touch it, not allowed to get out,

171
0:08:46.87,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but Bonnie and her team hand me nutrition

172
0:08:49.024,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and ask me how I'm doing, am I all right.

173
0:08:52.377,000 --> 0:08:54,000
I am seeing the Taj Mahal --

174
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:56.505,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Over here.

176
0:08:57.812,000 --> 0:09:,000
I'm in a very different state --

177
0:09:01.599,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Laughter)

178
0:09:02.995,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And I'm thinking, "Wow!

179
0:09:05.781,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I never thought I'd be running into the Taj Mahal out here.

180
0:09:09.663,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It's gorgeous!

181
0:09:11.448,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I mean, how long did it take them to build that?

182
0:09:14.061,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It's just ...

183
0:09:16.315,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So, uh -- wooo -- you know?

184
0:09:18.439,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Laughter)

185
0:09:22.626,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We kind of have a cardinal rule

186
0:09:24.518,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that I'm never told how far it is, because we don't know how far it is.

187
0:09:28.011,000 --> 0:09:31,000
What's going to happen to you between this point and that point?

188
0:09:31.212,000 --> 0:09:33,000
What's going to happen to the weather and the currents

189
0:09:33.84,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and, God forbid, you're stung,

190
0:09:35.824,000 --> 0:09:38,000
when you don't think you could be stung in all this armor.

191
0:09:40.393,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Bonnie made a decision coming into that third morning

192
0:09:44.772,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that I was suffering,

193
0:09:46.567,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and I was hanging on by a thread.

194
0:09:50.459,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And she said, "Come here,"

195
0:09:51.728,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and I came close to the boat, and she said,

196
0:09:53.839,000 --> 0:09:54,000
"Look, look out there."

197
0:09:55.061,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And I saw light,

198
0:09:56.238,000 --> 0:09:58,000
because the day is easier than the night,

199
0:09:58.264,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and I thought we were coming into day.

200
0:10:00.118,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I saw a stream of white light along the horizon,

201
0:10:03.8,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and I said, "It's going to be morning soon."

202
0:10:06.102,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And she said, "No, those are the lights of Key West."

203
0:10:11.65,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It was 15 more hours,

204
0:10:13.516,000 --> 0:10:15,000
which for most swimmers would be a long time.

205
0:10:15.749,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:18.899,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Applause)

207
0:10:22.24,000 --> 0:10:26,000
You have no idea how many 15-hour training swims I had done.

208
0:10:26.785,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So here we go, and I somehow, without a decision,

209
0:10:30.626,000 --> 0:10:32,000
went into no counting of strokes

210
0:10:32.968,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and no singing

211
0:10:34.301,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and no quoting Stephen Hawking on the parameters of the universe.

212
0:10:39.516,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I just went into thinking about this dream, and why and how.

213
0:10:46.188,000 --> 0:10:48,000
As I said, when I turned 60,

214
0:10:48.354,000 --> 0:10:52,000
it wasn't about that concrete "Can you do it?"

215
0:10:52.382,000 --> 0:10:54,000
That's the everyday machinations.

216
0:10:55.342,000 --> 0:10:57,000
That's the discipline, and it's the preparation,

217
0:10:58.113,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and there's a pride in that.

218
0:10:59.842,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But I decided to think, as I went along,

219
0:11:04.391,000 --> 0:11:07,000
about -- you know, the phrase usually is, "reaching for the stars."

220
0:11:08.28,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And in my case, it's reaching for the horizon.

221
0:11:11.438,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And when you reach for the horizon,

222
0:11:13.333,000 --> 0:11:15,000
as I've proven, you may not get there.

223
0:11:16.036,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But what a tremendous build of character and spirit

224
0:11:22.392,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that you lay down;

225
0:11:24.409,000 --> 0:11:27,000
what a foundation you lay down in reaching for those horizons.

226
0:11:29.889,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And now, the shore is coming.

227
0:11:32.432,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And there's just a little part of me that's sad.

228
0:11:35.579,000 --> 0:11:37,000
The epic journey is going to be over.

229
0:11:37.82,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So many people come up to me now and say,

230
0:11:39.91,000 --> 0:11:4,000
"What's next?"

231
0:11:41.127,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Laughter)

232
0:11:42.573,000 --> 0:11:43,000
"We love that!"

233
0:11:43.902,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Laughter)

234
0:11:45.013,000 --> 0:11:46,000
"That little tracker on the computer?

235
0:11:46.917,000 --> 0:11:47,000
When are you going to do the next one?

236
0:11:48.782,000 --> 0:11:49,000
We can't wait to follow the next one."

237
0:11:50.638,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Well, they were just there for 53 hours,

238
0:11:52.842,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and I was there for years.

239
0:11:55.229,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And so there won't be another epic journey in the ocean.

240
0:11:58.658,000 --> 0:12:01,000
But the point is, and the point was,

241
0:12:02.233,000 --> 0:12:06,000
that every day of our lives is epic.

242
0:12:07.417,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And I'll tell you, when I walked up onto that beach,

243
0:12:09.913,000 --> 0:12:1,000
staggered up onto that beach ...

244
0:12:11.908,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I had so many times, in a very puffed-up ego way,

245
0:12:18.359,000 --> 0:12:2,000
rehearsed what I would say ...

246
0:12:20.418,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Laughter)

247
0:12:22.089,000 --> 0:12:23,000
on the beach.

248
0:12:23.363,000 --> 0:12:25,000
When Bonnie thought the back of my throat was swelling up,

249
0:12:26.327,000 --> 0:12:28,000
she brought the medical team over to our boat

250
0:12:28.52,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to say, "She's really beginning to have trouble breathing;

251
0:12:32.752,000 --> 0:12:35,000
another 12, 24 hours in the saltwater ..." --

252
0:12:35.831,000 --> 0:12:38,000
the whole thing -- I just thought, in my hallucinatory moment,

253
0:12:39.6,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that I heard the word "tracheotomy."

254
0:12:42.01,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Laughter)

255
0:12:44.871,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Bonnie said to the doctor, "I'm not worried about her not breathing.

256
0:12:48.165,000 --> 0:12:5,000
If she can't talk when she gets to the shore,

257
0:12:50.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
she's going to be pissed off."

258
0:12:51.881,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Laughter)

259
0:12:57.112,000 --> 0:13:,000
But the truth is, all those orations that I had practiced,

260
0:13:01.041,000 --> 0:13:04,000
just to get myself through some training swims as motivation --

261
0:13:04.941,000 --> 0:13:05,000
it wasn't like that.

262
0:13:06.433,000 --> 0:13:08,000
It was a very real moment,

263
0:13:08.905,000 --> 0:13:1,000
with that crowd, with my team.

264
0:13:11.368,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We did it. I didn't do it. We did it.

265
0:13:13.877,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And we'll never forget it. It'll always be part of us.

266
0:13:17.181,000 --> 0:13:21,000
The three things I did sort of blurt out when we got there, was first:

267
0:13:21.223,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Never, ever give up.

268
0:13:24.55,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I live it.

269
0:13:25.976,000 --> 0:13:27,000
What's the phrase from today from Socrates?

270
0:13:28.867,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Audience: To be is to do.

271
0:13:30.087,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Diana Nyad: To be is to do.

272
0:13:31.419,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So I don't stand up and say, "Don't ever give up."

273
0:13:34.432,000 --> 0:13:35,000
I didn't give up.

274
0:13:36.341,000 --> 0:13:37,000
There was action behind these words.

275
0:13:38.292,000 --> 0:13:39,000
The second is:

276
0:13:40.01,000 --> 0:13:43,000
You can chase your dreams at any age; you're never too old.

277
0:13:43.31,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Sixty-four; a thing no one, at any age, any gender, could ever do

278
0:13:48.413,000 --> 0:13:49,000
has done it.

279
0:13:49.593,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And there's no doubt in my mind

280
0:13:51.156,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that I am at the prime of my life today.

281
0:13:53.848,000 --> 0:13:55,000
(Applause)

282
0:13:56.676,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Yeah.

283
0:13:57.948,000 --> 0:14:01,000
(Applause)

284
0:14:02.258,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Thank you.

285
0:14:04.081,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And the third thing I said on that beach was,

286
0:14:06.248,000 --> 0:14:08,000
it looks like the most solitary endeavor in the world,

287
0:14:08.924,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and in many ways, of course, it is.

288
0:14:11.051,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And in other ways, and the most important ways,

289
0:14:14.724,000 --> 0:14:15,000
it's a team.

290
0:14:15.936,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And if you think I'm a badass, you want to meet Bonnie.

291
0:14:18.669,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Laughter)

292
0:14:20.145,000 --> 0:14:21,000
Bonnie, where are you?

293
0:14:22.741,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Where are you?

294
0:14:25.236,000 --> 0:14:26,000
There's Bonnie Stoll.

295
0:14:26.639,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Applause)

296
0:14:29.05,000 --> 0:14:3,000
My buddy.

297
0:14:30.368,000 --> 0:14:33,000
(Applause)

298
0:14:33.397,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The Henry David Thoreau quote goes,

299
0:14:35.741,000 --> 0:14:38,000
"When you achieve your dreams, it's not so much what you get

300
0:14:39.035,000 --> 0:14:41,000
as who you have become in achieving them."

301
0:14:41.904,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And yeah, I stand before you now.

302
0:14:43.839,000 --> 0:14:45,000
In the three months since that swim ended,

303
0:14:45.863,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I've sat down with Oprah,

304
0:14:47.691,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and I've been in President Obama's Oval Office;

305
0:14:51.473,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I've been invited to speak in front of esteemed groups

306
0:14:54.048,000 --> 0:14:55,000
such as yourselves;

307
0:14:55.223,000 --> 0:14:57,000
I've signed a wonderful major book contract.

308
0:14:57.498,000 --> 0:14:59,000
All of that's great, and I don't denigrate it.

309
0:15:00.233,000 --> 0:15:01,000
I'm proud of it all, but the truth is,

310
0:15:02.148,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I'm walking around tall

311
0:15:03.465,000 --> 0:15:08,000
because I am that bold, fearless person, and I will be, every day,

312
0:15:09.432,000 --> 0:15:13,000
until it's time for these days to be done.

313
0:15:13.605,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Thank you very much and enjoy the conference.

314
0:15:15.787,000 --> 0:15:17,000

2
0:00:15.566,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Hi. My name is Cameron Russell,

3
0:00:18.21,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and for the last little while, I've been a model.

4
0:00:24.263,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Actually, for 10 years.

5
0:00:28.25,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And I feel like

6
0:00:30.43,000 --> 0:00:32,000
there's an uncomfortable tension in the room right now

7
0:00:33.254,000 --> 0:00:35,000
because I should not have worn this dress.

8
0:00:35.301,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:37.083,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So luckily, I brought an outfit change.

10
0:00:39.581,000 --> 0:00:42,000
This is the first outfit change on the TED stage,

11
0:00:43.23,000 --> 0:00:46,000
so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it, I think.

12
0:00:46.276,000 --> 0:00:48,000
If some of the women were really horrified when I came out,

13
0:00:49.217,000 --> 0:00:52,000
you don't have to tell me now, but I'll find out later on Twitter.

14
0:00:52.384,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:57.575,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I'd also note that I'm quite privileged

16
0:00:59.457,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to be able to transform what you think of me

17
0:01:02.535,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in a very brief 10 seconds.

18
0:01:05.198,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Not everybody gets to do that.

19
0:01:08.66,000 --> 0:01:11,000
These heels are very uncomfortable, so good thing I wasn't going to wear them.

20
0:01:14.499,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The worst part is putting this sweater over my head,

21
0:01:17.044,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because that's when you'll all laugh at me,

22
0:01:19.117,000 --> 0:01:21,000
so don't do anything while it's over my head.

23
0:01:23.005,000 --> 0:01:24,000
All right.

24
0:01:26.243,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So, why did I do that?

25
0:01:28.974,000 --> 0:01:29,000
That was awkward.

26
0:01:30.204,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:32.156,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Well --

28
0:01:33.291,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:35.681,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Hopefully not as awkward as that picture.

30
0:01:40.566,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Image is powerful,

31
0:01:43.348,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but also, image is superficial.

32
0:01:48.296,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I just totally transformed what you thought of me, in six seconds.

33
0:01:52.739,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And in this picture,

34
0:01:54.578,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life.

35
0:01:57.903,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I was totally uncomfortable,

36
0:01:59.72,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and the photographer was telling me to arch my back

37
0:02:02.222,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and put my hand in that guy's hair.

38
0:02:06.273,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And of course, barring surgery,

39
0:02:08.273,000 --> 0:02:11,000
or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work,

40
0:02:11.714,000 --> 0:02:14,000
there's very little that we can do to transform how we look,

41
0:02:15.475,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and how we look, though it is superficial and immutable,

42
0:02:18.931,000 --> 0:02:2,000
has a huge impact on our lives.

43
0:02:23.294,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So today, for me, being fearless means being honest.

44
0:02:27.922,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And I am on this stage because I am a model.

45
0:02:30.807,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I am on this stage because I am a pretty, white woman,

46
0:02:34.534,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and in my industry, we call that a sexy girl.

47
0:02:37.299,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me,

48
0:02:40.17,000 --> 0:02:41,000
but with an honest twist.

49
0:02:41.492,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So the first question is, how do you become a model?

50
0:02:44.394,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I always just say, "Oh, I was scouted,"

51
0:02:46.427,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but that means nothing.

52
0:02:47.609,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The real way that I became a model

53
0:02:50.714,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is I won a genetic lottery, and I am the recipient of a legacy,

54
0:02:54.201,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and maybe you're wondering what is a legacy.

55
0:02:56.321,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Well, for the past few centuries

56
0:02:59.067,000 --> 0:03:04,000
we have defined beauty not just as health and youth

57
0:03:04.585,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and symmetry that we're biologically programmed to admire,

58
0:03:08.371,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but also as tall, slender figures,

59
0:03:11.907,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and femininity and white skin.

60
0:03:15.154,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And this is a legacy that was built for me,

61
0:03:17.226,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and it's a legacy that I've been cashing out on.

62
0:03:19.7,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And I know there are people in the audience

63
0:03:21.754,000 --> 0:03:22,000
who are skeptical at this point,

64
0:03:23.47,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and maybe there are some fashionistas who are like,

65
0:03:25.971,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"Wait. Naomi. Tyra. Joan Smalls. Liu Wen."

66
0:03:28.514,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And first, I commend you on your model knowledge. Very impressive.

67
0:03:31.681,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:33.337,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But unfortunately, I have to inform you that in 2007,

69
0:03:36.89,000 --> 0:03:38,000
a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student

70
0:03:39.4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
counted all the models on the runway, every single one that was hired,

71
0:03:43.026,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and of the 677 models that were hired,

72
0:03:46.154,000 --> 0:03:49,000
only 27, or less than four percent, were non-white.

73
0:03:50.897,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The next question people always ask is,

74
0:03:52.854,000 --> 0:03:53,000
"Can I be a model when I grow up?"

75
0:03:54.503,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And the first answer is, "I don't know, they don't put me in charge of that."

76
0:03:58.161,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But the second answer,

77
0:03:59.578,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and what I really want to say to these little girls is,

78
0:04:02.356,000 --> 0:04:03,000
"Why? You know? You can be anything.

79
0:04:04.37,000 --> 0:04:06,000
You could be the President of the United States,

80
0:04:06.64,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or the inventor of the next Internet,

81
0:04:08.441,000 --> 0:04:09,000
or a ninja cardiothoracic surgeon poet,

82
0:04:10.423,000 --> 0:04:12,000
which would be awesome, because you'd be the first one."

83
0:04:13.114,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:15.3,000 --> 0:04:17,000
If, after this amazing list, they still are like,

85
0:04:17.658,000 --> 0:04:18,000
"No, no, Cameron, I want to be a model,"

86
0:04:19.587,000 --> 0:04:2,000
well, then I say, "Be my boss."

87
0:04:21.225,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Because I'm not in charge of anything,

88
0:04:23.115,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue

89
0:04:25.666,000 --> 0:04:27,000
or the CEO of H&M, or the next Steven Meisel.

90
0:04:28.291,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up

91
0:04:30.696,000 --> 0:04:33,000
is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up.

92
0:04:34.054,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It's out of your control, and it's awesome,

93
0:04:37.498,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and it's not a career path.

94
0:04:39.576,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge,

95
0:04:43.567,000 --> 0:04:44,000
because unlike cardiothoracic surgeons,

96
0:04:45.496,000 --> 0:04:47,000
it can just be distilled right now.

97
0:04:48.222,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So, if the photographer is right there,

98
0:04:51.306,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the light is right there, like a nice HMI,

99
0:04:53.387,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and the client says, "We want a walking shot,"

100
0:04:55.558,000 --> 0:04:58,000
this leg goes first, nice and long, this arm goes back, this arm goes forward,

101
0:04:59.266,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the head is at three quarters, and you just go back and forth,

102
0:05:02.208,000 --> 0:05:05,000
just do that, and then you look back at your imaginary friends,

103
0:05:05.232,000 --> 0:05:06,000
300, 400, 500 times.

104
0:05:06.975,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:08.679,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It will look something like this.

106
0:05:10.49,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:12.701,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle.

108
0:05:15.653,000 --> 0:05:17,000
That was -- I don't know what happened there.

109
0:05:18.228,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Unfortunately, after you've gone to school,

110
0:05:20.359,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and you have a résumé and you've done a few jobs,

111
0:05:22.713,000 --> 0:05:23,000
you can't say anything anymore,

112
0:05:24.229,000 --> 0:05:27,000
so if you say you want to be the President of the United States,

113
0:05:27.3,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but your résumé reads, "Underwear Model: 10 years,"

114
0:05:29.73,000 --> 0:05:3,000
people give you a funny look.

115
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
The next question is, "Do they retouch all the photos?"

116
0:05:33.772,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And yeah, they pretty much retouch all the photos,

117
0:05:36.177,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but that is only a small component of what's happening.

118
0:05:39.266,000 --> 0:05:41,000
This picture is the very first picture that I ever took,

119
0:05:42.008,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and it's also the very first time that I had worn a bikini,

120
0:05:44.841,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and I didn't even have my period yet.

121
0:05:46.645,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I know we're getting personal, but I was a young girl.

122
0:05:49.796,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier.

123
0:05:54.276,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Here's me on the same day as this shoot.

124
0:05:56.476,000 --> 0:05:57,000
My friend got to come.

125
0:05:57.844,000 --> 0:06:,000
Here's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue.

126
0:06:01.939,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Here's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine.

127
0:06:06.047,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And here's me today.

128
0:06:07.507,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And I hope what you're seeing

129
0:06:09.567,000 --> 0:06:11,000
is that these pictures are not pictures of me.

130
0:06:11.765,000 --> 0:06:12,000
They are constructions,

131
0:06:13.203,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and they are constructions by a group of professionals,

132
0:06:16.131,000 --> 0:06:19,000
by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists

133
0:06:19.251,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production,

134
0:06:22.467,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and they build this.

135
0:06:23.499,000 --> 0:06:24,000
That's not me.

136
0:06:24.593,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Okay, so the next question people always ask me is,

137
0:06:27.014,000 --> 0:06:28,000
"Do you get free stuff?"

138
0:06:28.364,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:29.434,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear,

140
0:06:32.705,000 --> 0:06:33,000
except for earlier,

141
0:06:34.324,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life,

142
0:06:37.809,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and that's what we don't like to talk about.

143
0:06:40.063,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I grew up in Cambridge,

144
0:06:41.354,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money

145
0:06:43.95,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and they gave me the dress for free.

146
0:06:46.082,000 --> 0:06:48,000
When I was a teenager, I was driving with my friend

147
0:06:48.602,000 --> 0:06:5,000
who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course,

148
0:06:51.293,000 --> 0:06:52,000
we got pulled over,

149
0:06:52.506,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and all it took was a "Sorry, officer," and we were on our way.

150
0:06:57.623,000 --> 0:07:,000
And I got these free things because of how I look,

151
0:07:00.829,000 --> 0:07:02,000
not who I am, and there are people paying a cost

152
0:07:03.648,000 --> 0:07:05,000
for how they look and not who they are.

153
0:07:05.89,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I live in New York, and last year,

154
0:07:07.534,000 --> 0:07:1,000
of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked,

155
0:07:11.337,000 --> 0:07:15,000
86% of them were black and Latino, and most of them were young men.

156
0:07:15.376,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York,

157
0:07:19.862,000 --> 0:07:21,000
so for them, it's not a question of, "Will I get stopped?"

158
0:07:22.601,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but "How many times will I get stopped? When will I get stopped?"

159
0:07:25.683,000 --> 0:07:26,000
When I was researching this talk,

160
0:07:27.279,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States,

161
0:07:30.458,000 --> 0:07:32,000
53% don't like their bodies,

162
0:07:33.145,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and that number goes to 78% by the time that they're 17.

163
0:07:37.241,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So, the last question people ask me is,

164
0:07:40.163,000 --> 0:07:41,000
"What is it like to be a model?"

165
0:07:41.787,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And I think the answer that they're looking for is,

166
0:07:44.194,000 --> 0:07:46,000
"If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair,

167
0:07:47.138,000 --> 0:07:49,000
you will be so happy and fabulous."

168
0:07:49.935,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And when we're backstage,

169
0:07:51.494,000 --> 0:07:53,000
we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that.

170
0:07:54.041,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We say, "It's really amazing to travel, and it's amazing to get to work

171
0:07:57.545,000 --> 0:07:59,000
with creative, inspired, passionate people."

172
0:08:00.169,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And those things are true, but they're only one half of the story,

173
0:08:03.336,000 --> 0:08:05,000
because the thing that we never say on camera,

174
0:08:05.938,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that I have never said on camera, is,

175
0:08:08.034,000 --> 0:08:09,000
"I am insecure."

176
0:08:10.418,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And I'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day.

177
0:08:15.86,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And if you ever are wondering,

178
0:08:18.856,000 --> 0:08:21,000
"If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair, will I be happier?"

179
0:08:22.81,000 --> 0:08:23,000
you just need to meet a group of models,

180
0:08:24.739,000 --> 0:08:27,000
because they have the thinnest thighs, the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes,

181
0:08:28.689,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and they're the most physically insecure women probably on the planet.

182
0:08:32.156,000 --> 0:08:33,000
When I was writing this talk,

183
0:08:33.562,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance,

184
0:08:36.555,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because on the one hand,

185
0:08:38.013,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say,

186
0:08:40.449,000 --> 0:08:43,000
"Look I've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor,"

187
0:08:44.068,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with,

188
0:08:47.283,000 --> 0:08:49,000
"and it doesn't always make me happy."

189
0:08:49.671,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression

190
0:08:55.57,000 --> 0:08:57,000
when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries.

191
0:08:59.082,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But I'm also happy and honored to be up here

192
0:09:01.563,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and I think that it's great that I got to come

193
0:09:04.799,000 --> 0:09:07,000
before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I'd had more agency in my career,

194
0:09:08.496,000 --> 0:09:11,000
because maybe then I wouldn't tell the story of how I got my first job,

195
0:09:11.994,000 --> 0:09:13,000
or maybe I wouldn't tell the story of how I paid for college,

196
0:09:14.891,000 --> 0:09:15,000
which seems so important right now.

197
0:09:17.334,000 --> 0:09:18,000
If there's a takeaway to this talk,

198
0:09:19.256,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I hope it's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging

199
0:09:22.883,000 --> 0:09:25,000
the power of image in our perceived successes

200
0:09:26.85,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and our perceived failures.

201
0:09:28.75,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Thank you.

202
0:09:30.126,000 --> 0:09:32,000

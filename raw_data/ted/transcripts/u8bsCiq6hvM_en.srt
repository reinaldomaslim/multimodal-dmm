1
0:00:16.331,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
0:00:17.507,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I present to you the human genome.

3
0:00:19.658,000 --> 0:00:22,000
(Applause)

4
0:00:23.561,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Chromosome one -- top left, bottom right -- are the sex chromosomes.

5
0:00:27.518,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Women have two copies of that big X chromosome;

6
0:00:30.27,000 --> 0:00:33,000
men have the X and, of course, that small copy of the Y.

7
0:00:33.459,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Sorry boys, but it's just a tiny little thing that makes you different.

8
0:00:37.174,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So if you zoom in on this genome,

9
0:00:40.19,000 --> 0:00:43,000
then what you see, of course, is this double-helix structure --

10
0:00:43.832,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the code of life spelled out with these four biochemical letters,

11
0:00:46.99,000 --> 0:00:48,000
or we call them bases: A, C, G and T.

12
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
How many are there in the human genome? Three billion.

13
0:00:51.856,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Is that a big number?

14
0:00:53.06,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Well, everybody can throw around big numbers.

15
0:00:55.303,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But in fact, if I were to place one base

16
0:00:57.427,000 --> 0:01:,000
on each pixel of this 1280x800-resolution screen,

17
0:01:01.214,000 --> 0:01:04,000
we would need 3,000 screens to take a look at the genome.

18
0:01:04.517,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So it's really quite big.

19
0:01:05.749,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And perhaps because of its size,

20
0:01:07.668,000 --> 0:01:09,000
a group of people -- all, by the way, with Y chromosomes --

21
0:01:10.543,000 --> 0:01:12,000
decided they would want to sequence it.

22
0:01:12.577,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:14.616,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And so 15 years, actually, and about four billion dollars later,

24
0:01:17.897,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the genome was sequenced and published.

25
0:01:19.796,000 --> 0:01:22,000
In 2003, the final version was published, and they keep working on it.

26
0:01:23.14,000 --> 0:01:24,000
That was all done on a machine like this.

27
0:01:25.153,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It costs about a dollar for each base -- a very slow way of doing it.

28
0:01:28.494,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Well, folks, I'm here to tell you

29
0:01:30.113,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that the world has completely changed,

30
0:01:32.228,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and none of you know about it.

31
0:01:34.062,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So now what we do is take a genome,

32
0:01:36.775,000 --> 0:01:37,000
we make maybe 50 copies of it,

33
0:01:38.338,000 --> 0:01:41,000
we cut all those copies up into little 50-base reads,

34
0:01:41.382,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and then we sequence them, massively parallel.

35
0:01:43.747,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Then we bring that into software and reassemble it,

36
0:01:46.858,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and tell you what the story is.

37
0:01:48.452,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So to give you a picture of what this looks like,

38
0:01:50.791,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the Human Genome Project: 3 gigabases, right?

39
0:01:53.298,000 --> 0:01:57,000
One run on one of these modern machines: 200 gigabases in a week.

40
0:01:57.974,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And that 200 is going to change to 600 this summer,

41
0:02:00.511,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and there's no sign of this pace slowing.

42
0:02:03.069,000 --> 0:02:06,000
The price of a base, to sequence a base,

43
0:02:06.678,000 --> 0:02:08,000
has fallen 100 million times.

44
0:02:09.455,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That's the equivalent of you filling up your car with gas in 1998,

45
0:02:13.255,000 --> 0:02:14,000
waiting until 2011,

46
0:02:14.508,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and now you can drive to Jupiter and back twice.

47
0:02:16.945,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:21.709,000 --> 0:02:22,000
World population,

49
0:02:24.121,000 --> 0:02:25,000
PC placements,

50
0:02:25.971,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the archive of all of medical literature,

51
0:02:28.757,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Moore's law,

52
0:02:30.479,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the old way of sequencing,

53
0:02:32.332,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and here's all the new stuff.

54
0:02:34.113,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Guys, this is a long scale;

55
0:02:35.478,000 --> 0:02:37,000
you don't typically see lines that go up like that.

56
0:02:38.702,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So the worldwide capacity to sequence human genomes

57
0:02:42.184,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is something like 50,000 to 100,000 human genomes this year.

58
0:02:45.377,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We know this based on the machines that are being placed.

59
0:02:48.104,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This is expected to double, triple or maybe quadruple

60
0:02:50.645,000 --> 0:02:52,000
year over year for the foreseeable future.

61
0:02:52.879,000 --> 0:02:53,000
In fact, there's one lab in particular

62
0:02:54.888,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that represents 20 percent of all that capacity:

63
0:02:57.848,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It's called the Beijing Genomics Institute.

64
0:03:00.666,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The Chinese are absolutely winning this race to the new Moon, by the way.

65
0:03:04.395,000 --> 0:03:05,000
What does this mean for medicine?

66
0:03:06.72,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So a woman, age 37,

67
0:03:09.468,000 --> 0:03:12,000
presents with stage 2 estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer.

68
0:03:12.706,000 --> 0:03:15,000
She is treated with surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.

69
0:03:15.897,000 --> 0:03:16,000
She goes home.

70
0:03:17.105,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Two years later,

71
0:03:18.28,000 --> 0:03:21,000
she comes back with stage 3C ovarian cancer, unfortunately;

72
0:03:21.478,000 --> 0:03:23,000
treated again with surgery and chemotherapy.

73
0:03:23.939,000 --> 0:03:25,000
She comes back three years later at age 42

74
0:03:26.217,000 --> 0:03:28,000
with more ovarian cancer, more chemotherapy.

75
0:03:28.598,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Six months later,

76
0:03:30.091,000 --> 0:03:33,000
she comes back with acute myeloid leukemia.

77
0:03:34.819,000 --> 0:03:37,000
She goes into respiratory failure and dies eight days later.

78
0:03:37.849,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So first: the way in which this woman was treated,

79
0:03:40.231,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in as little as 10 years, will look like bloodletting.

80
0:03:43.698,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And it's because of people like my colleague, Rick Wilson,

81
0:03:46.547,000 --> 0:03:48,000
at the Genome Institute at Washington University,

82
0:03:48.91,000 --> 0:03:5,000
who decided to take a look at this woman postmortem.

83
0:03:51.393,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And he took skin cells, healthy skin

84
0:03:53.9,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and cancerous bone marrow,

85
0:03:55.862,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and sequenced the whole genomes of both of them

86
0:03:58.172,000 --> 0:04:,000
in a couple of weeks, no big deal.

87
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Then he compared those two genomes in software,

88
0:04:02.485,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and what he found, among other things,

89
0:04:04.334,000 --> 0:04:08,000
was a deletion -- a 2,000-base deletion across three billion bases

90
0:04:08.971,000 --> 0:04:1,000
in a particular gene called TP53.

91
0:04:11.154,000 --> 0:04:13,000
If you have this deleterious mutation in this gene,

92
0:04:13.59,000 --> 0:04:15,000
you're 90 percent likely to get cancer in your life.

93
0:04:16.336,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So unfortunately, this doesn't help this woman,

94
0:04:18.584,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but it does have severe -- profound, if you will --

95
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
implications to her family.

96
0:04:24.061,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I mean, if they have the same mutation,

97
0:04:25.968,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and they get this genetic test and they understand it,

98
0:04:28.537,000 --> 0:04:3,000
then they can get regular screens and can catch cancer early,

99
0:04:31.442,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and potentially live a significantly longer life.

100
0:04:33.786,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Let me introduce you to the Beery twins,

101
0:04:35.74,000 --> 0:04:37,000
diagnosed with cerebral palsy at the age of two.

102
0:04:38.096,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Their mom is a very brave woman who didn't believe it;

103
0:04:40.668,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the symptoms weren't matching up.

104
0:04:42.295,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And through some heroic efforts and a lot of Internet searching,

105
0:04:45.327,000 --> 0:04:47,000
she was able to convince the medical community

106
0:04:47.522,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that, in fact, they had something else.

107
0:04:49.442,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They had dopa-responsive dystonia.

108
0:04:51.632,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And so they were given L-Dopa,

109
0:04:53.635,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and their symptoms did improve,

110
0:04:55.976,000 --> 0:04:56,000
but they weren't totally asymptomatic.

111
0:04:57.843,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Significant problems remained.

112
0:04:59.334,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Turns out the gentleman in this picture is a guy named Joe Beery,

113
0:05:02.527,000 --> 0:05:03,000
who was lucky enough to be the CIO

114
0:05:04.194,000 --> 0:05:06,000
of a company called Life Technologies.

115
0:05:06.339,000 --> 0:05:07,000
They're one of two companies

116
0:05:07.705,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that makes these massive whole-genome sequencing tools.

117
0:05:10.879,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And so he got his kids sequenced.

118
0:05:13.916,000 --> 0:05:16,000
What they found was a series of mutations in a gene called SPR,

119
0:05:17.018,000 --> 0:05:2,000
which is responsible for producing serotonin, among other things.

120
0:05:20.439,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So on top of L-Dopa, they gave these kids a serotonin precursor drug,

121
0:05:23.952,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and they're effectively normal now.

122
0:05:25.698,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Guys, this would never have happened without whole-genome sequencing.

123
0:05:29.013,000 --> 0:05:31,000
At the time -- this was a few years ago -- it cost $100,000.

124
0:05:31.877,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Today it's $10,000, next year, $1,000,

125
0:05:33.728,000 --> 0:05:35,000
the year after, $100, give or take a year.

126
0:05:35.781,000 --> 0:05:36,000
That's how fast this is moving.

127
0:05:37.305,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So here's little Nick --

128
0:05:39.186,000 --> 0:05:4,000
likes Batman and squirt guns.

129
0:05:40.926,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And it turns out Nick shows up at the children's hospital

130
0:05:44.645,000 --> 0:05:46,000
with this distended belly, like a famine victim.

131
0:05:46.931,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And it's not that he's not eating; it's that when he eats,

132
0:05:49.791,000 --> 0:05:52,000
his intestine basically opens up and feces spill out into his gut.

133
0:05:53.226,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So a hundred surgeries later,

134
0:05:54.885,000 --> 0:05:57,000
he looks at his mom and says, "Mom, please pray for me.

135
0:05:58.584,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I'm in so much pain."

136
0:06:00.408,000 --> 0:06:03,000
His pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics

137
0:06:03.547,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and he has no idea what's going on,

138
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
but he says, "Let's get this kid's genome sequenced."

139
0:06:07.827,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And what they find is a single-point mutation

140
0:06:09.991,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in a gene responsible for controlling programmed cell death.

141
0:06:12.864,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So the theory is that he's having some immunological reaction

142
0:06:15.966,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to what's going on -- to the food, essentially.

143
0:06:18.405,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And that's a natural reaction, which causes some programmed cell death,

144
0:06:21.799,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but the gene that regulates that down is broken.

145
0:06:24.093,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And so this informs, among other things, of course,

146
0:06:26.535,000 --> 0:06:28,000
a treatment for bone marrow transplant, which he undertakes.

147
0:06:29.53,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And after nine months of grueling recovery,

148
0:06:31.574,000 --> 0:06:32,000
he's now eating steak with A1 sauce.

149
0:06:33.503,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Laughter)

150
0:06:34.624,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The prospect of using the genome as a universal diagnostic

151
0:06:38.747,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is upon us today.

152
0:06:41.462,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Today. It's here.

153
0:06:43.025,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And what it means for all of us

154
0:06:44.541,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is that everybody in this room could live an extra 5, 10, 20 years,

155
0:06:47.852,000 --> 0:06:48,000
just because of this one thing.

156
0:06:49.543,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Which is a fantastic story,

157
0:06:51.63,000 --> 0:06:53,000
unless you think about humanity's footprint on the planet,

158
0:06:54.532,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and our ability to keep up food production.

159
0:06:57.031,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So it turns out

160
0:06:58.627,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that the very same technology is also being used to grow new lines

161
0:07:02.592,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of corn, wheat, soybean and other crops

162
0:07:05.745,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that are highly tolerant of drought, of flood,

163
0:07:07.944,000 --> 0:07:08,000
of pests and pesticides.

164
0:07:09.491,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now, look --

165
0:07:11.184,000 --> 0:07:13,000
as long as we continue to increase the population,

166
0:07:13.582,000 --> 0:07:16,000
we'll have to continue to grow and eat genetically modified foods.

167
0:07:16.785,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And that's the only position I'll take today.

168
0:07:18.96,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Unless there's anybody in the audience

169
0:07:20.802,000 --> 0:07:22,000
who'd like to volunteer to stop eating?

170
0:07:23.047,000 --> 0:07:24,000
None, not one.

171
0:07:24.961,000 --> 0:07:25,000
This is a typewriter,

172
0:07:26.696,000 --> 0:07:28,000
a staple of every desktop for decades.

173
0:07:29.339,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And, in fact, the typewriter was essentially deleted by this thing.

174
0:07:33.503,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And then more general versions of word processors came about.

175
0:07:36.792,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But ultimately, it was a disruption on top of a disruption.

176
0:07:39.595,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It was Bob Metcalfe inventing the Ethernet,

177
0:07:41.687,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and the connection of all these computers

178
0:07:43.68,000 --> 0:07:44,000
that fundamentally changed everything.

179
0:07:45.554,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Suddenly we had Netscape, we had Yahoo.

180
0:07:48.379,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And we had, indeed, the entire dot-com bubble.

181
0:07:51.948,000 --> 0:07:52,000
(Laughter)

182
0:07:54.78,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Not to worry though,

183
0:07:56.027,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that was quickly rescued by the iPod, Facebook

184
0:07:58.626,000 --> 0:08:,000
and, indeed, Angry Birds.

185
0:08:00.753,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:03.125,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Look, this is where we are today.

187
0:08:05.675,000 --> 0:08:07,000
This is the genomic revolution today. This is where we are.

188
0:08:08.489,000 --> 0:08:09,000
What I'd like you to consider is:

189
0:08:10.093,000 --> 0:08:11,000
What does it mean

190
0:08:11.522,000 --> 0:08:14,000
when these dots don't represent the individual bases of your genome,

191
0:08:14.903,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but they connect to genomes all across the planet?

192
0:08:17.778,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I just recently had to buy life insurance, and I was required to answer:

193
0:08:21.39,000 --> 0:08:23,000
A. I have never had a genetic test;

194
0:08:23.545,000 --> 0:08:24,000
B. I've had one, here you go;

195
0:08:25.052,000 --> 0:08:26,000
or C. I've had one and I'm not telling.

196
0:08:27.021,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Thankfully, I was able to answer A,

197
0:08:28.761,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and I say that honestly, in case my life insurance agent is listening.

198
0:08:32.333,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But what would have happened if I had said C?

199
0:08:34.756,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Consumer applications for genomics will flourish.

200
0:08:37.181,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Do you want to see if you're genetically compatible

201
0:08:39.654,000 --> 0:08:4,000
with your girlfriend?

202
0:08:40.908,000 --> 0:08:42,000
DNA sequencing on your iPhone? There's an app for that.

203
0:08:43.895,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

204
0:08:45.705,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Personalized genomic massage, anyone?

205
0:08:49.038,000 --> 0:08:53,000
There's already a lab today that tests for allele 334 of the AVPR1 gene,

206
0:08:53.629,000 --> 0:08:54,000
the so-called cheating gene.

207
0:08:55.037,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Laughter)

208
0:08:57.076,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So anybody who's here today with your significant other,

209
0:08:59.727,000 --> 0:09:01,000
just turn over to them, swab their mouth, send it to the lab

210
0:09:02.618,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and you'll know for sure.

211
0:09:03.911,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Laughter)

212
0:09:05.046,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Do you really want to elect a president

213
0:09:07.012,000 --> 0:09:09,000
whose genome suggests cardiomyopathy?

214
0:09:09.298,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Think of it -- it's 2016,

215
0:09:11.182,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and the leading candidate releases

216
0:09:12.912,000 --> 0:09:14,000
not only her four years of back-tax returns,

217
0:09:15.018,000 --> 0:09:16,000
but also her personal genome.

218
0:09:16.495,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And it looks really good.

219
0:09:17.729,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Then she challenges all her competitors to do the same.

220
0:09:20.349,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Do you think that's not going to happen?

221
0:09:22.308,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Do you think it would have helped John McCain?

222
0:09:24.566,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Laughter)

223
0:09:26.383,000 --> 0:09:29,000
How many people in the audience have the last name Resnick, like me?

224
0:09:29.625,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Raise your hand.

225
0:09:30.807,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Anybody? Nobody.

226
0:09:32.435,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Typically, there's one or two.

227
0:09:33.904,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So my father's father was one of 10 Resnick brothers.

228
0:09:36.481,000 --> 0:09:4,000
They all hated each other, and all moved to different parts of the planet.

229
0:09:40.59,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So it's likely I'm related to every Resnick that I ever meet,

230
0:09:43.533,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but I don't know.

231
0:09:44.708,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So imagine if my genome were De-identified, sitting in software,

232
0:09:47.769,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And a third cousin's genome was also sitting there,

233
0:09:50.177,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and there was software that could compare the two

234
0:09:52.502,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and make these associations.

235
0:09:53.883,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Not hard to imagine. My company has software that does this right now.

236
0:09:57.215,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Imagine one more thing,

237
0:09:58.407,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that that software is able to ask both parties for mutual consent:

238
0:10:01.666,000 --> 0:10:03,000
"Would you be willing to meet your third cousin?"

239
0:10:04.015,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And if we both say yes -- voilà!

240
0:10:05.689,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Welcome to Chromosomally LinkedIn.

241
0:10:07.49,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Laughter)

242
0:10:11.808,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Now this is probably a good thing, right?

243
0:10:13.825,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Bigger clan gatherings and so on.

244
0:10:15.437,000 --> 0:10:16,000
But maybe it's a bad thing as well.

245
0:10:17.162,000 --> 0:10:19,000
How many fathers in the room? Raise your hands.

246
0:10:19.467,000 --> 0:10:22,000
OK, so experts think that one to three percent of you

247
0:10:22.819,000 --> 0:10:24,000
are not actually the father of your child.

248
0:10:24.946,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Laughter)

249
0:10:26.724,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Look --

250
0:10:27.924,000 --> 0:10:3,000
(Laughter)

251
0:10:32.871,000 --> 0:10:34,000
These genomes, these 23 chromosomes,

252
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
they don't in any way represent the quality of our relationships

253
0:10:38.649,000 --> 0:10:4,000
or the nature of our society -- at least not yet.

254
0:10:41.366,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And like any new technology,

255
0:10:43.185,000 --> 0:10:44,000
it's really in humanity's hands

256
0:10:44.998,000 --> 0:10:46,000
to wield it for the betterment of mankind

257
0:10:47.22,000 --> 0:10:48,000
or not.

258
0:10:48.395,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And so I urge you all to wake up and to tune in

259
0:10:50.642,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and to influence the genomic revolution that's happening all around you.

260
0:10:54.062,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Thank you.

261
0:10:55.237,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Applause)

Translator: Jenny Zurawell

2
0:00:16.982,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So I want to talk today about money and happiness,

3
0:00:19.419,000 --> 0:00:22,000
which are two things a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about,

4
0:00:23.001,000 --> 0:00:25,000
either trying to earn them or trying to increase them.

5
0:00:25.855,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And a lot of us resonate with this phrase,

6
0:00:28.158,000 --> 0:00:3,000
we see it in religions and self-help books:

7
0:00:30.991,000 --> 0:00:31,000
money can't buy happiness.

8
0:00:32.31,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And I want to suggest today that, in fact, that's wrong.

9
0:00:35.109,000 --> 0:00:37,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:37.184,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I'm at a business school, so that's what we do.

11
0:00:39.425,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So that's wrong,

12
0:00:40.602,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and in fact, if you think that, you're just not spending it right.

13
0:00:43.849,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So instead of spending it the way you usually spend it,

14
0:00:46.521,000 --> 0:00:49,000
maybe if you spent it differently, that might work a little bit better.

15
0:00:50.032,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Before I tell you the ways you can spend it that will make you happier,

16
0:00:53.501,000 --> 0:00:55,000
let's think about the ways we usually spend it

17
0:00:55.708,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that don't, in fact, make us happier.

18
0:00:57.544,000 --> 0:00:58,000
We had a little natural experiment.

19
0:00:59.304,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So CNN, a little while ago, wrote this interesting article

20
0:01:02.111,000 --> 0:01:04,000
on what happens to people when they win the lottery.

21
0:01:04.627,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It turns out people think when they win the lottery

22
0:01:07.089,000 --> 0:01:08,000
their lives will be amazing.

23
0:01:08.47,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This article's about how their lives get ruined.

24
0:01:10.804,000 --> 0:01:11,000
What happens when people win the lottery

25
0:01:12.749,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is, one, they spend all the money and go into debt;

26
0:01:15.171,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and two, all of their friends and everyone they've ever met

27
0:01:18.263,000 --> 0:01:19,000
find them and bug them for money.

28
0:01:20.032,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It ruins their social relationships, in fact.

29
0:01:22.228,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So they have more debt and worse friendships

30
0:01:24.336,000 --> 0:01:26,000
than they had before they won the lottery.

31
0:01:26.387,000 --> 0:01:28,000
What was interesting about the article was,

32
0:01:28.431,000 --> 0:01:3,000
people started commenting on the article, readers of the thing.

33
0:01:31.447,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And instead of talking about how it made them realize

34
0:01:33.983,000 --> 0:01:34,000
that money doesn't lead to happiness,

35
0:01:35.805,000 --> 0:01:38,000
everyone started saying, "You know what I'd do if I won the lottery ...?"

36
0:01:39.273,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and fantasizing about what they'd do.

37
0:01:41.096,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Here's just two of the ones we saw that are interesting to think about.

38
0:01:44.49,000 --> 0:01:47,000
One person wrote, "When I win, I'm going to buy my own little mountain

39
0:01:47.85,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and have a little house on top."

40
0:01:49.442,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

41
0:01:50.781,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And another person wrote, "I would fill a big bathtub with money

42
0:01:53.854,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar

43
0:01:56.118,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and sipping a glass of champagne."

44
0:01:57.988,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This is even worse: "... then I'd have a picture taken

45
0:02:00.572,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and dozens of glossies made.

46
0:02:01.94,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me

47
0:02:04.46,000 --> 0:02:06,000
would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else."

48
0:02:07.235,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:09.704,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And so many of the comments were exactly of this type,

50
0:02:12.301,000 --> 0:02:15,000
where people got money and, in fact, it made them antisocial.

51
0:02:15.593,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So I told you it ruins people's lives and their friends bug them.

52
0:02:18.805,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Also, money often makes us feel very selfish

53
0:02:21.021,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and we do things only for ourselves.

54
0:02:22.86,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We thought maybe the reason money doesn't make us happy

55
0:02:25.5,000 --> 0:02:27,000
is that we're spending it on the wrong things;

56
0:02:27.696,000 --> 0:02:29,000
in particular, we're always spending it on ourselves.

57
0:02:30.246,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And we wondered what would happen

58
0:02:31.857,000 --> 0:02:33,000
if we made people spend more of their money on others.

59
0:02:34.421,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So instead of being antisocial with your money,

60
0:02:36.668,000 --> 0:02:38,000
what if you were more pro-social with it?

61
0:02:38.695,000 --> 0:02:4,000
We thought, let's make people do it and see what happens.

62
0:02:41.563,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Let's have some people do what they usually do,

63
0:02:43.789,000 --> 0:02:44,000
spend money on themselves,

64
0:02:45.091,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and let's make some people give money away,

65
0:02:47.146,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and measure their happiness and see if, in fact, they get happier.

66
0:02:50.284,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The first way we did this was, one Vancouver morning,

67
0:02:52.861,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia,

68
0:02:55.86,000 --> 0:02:58,000
approached people and said, "Do you want to be in an experiment?"

69
0:02:58.948,000 --> 0:02:59,000
They said, "Yes."

70
0:03:00.14,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We asked them how happy they were, and then gave them an envelope.

71
0:03:03.265,000 --> 0:03:05,000
One of the envelopes had things in it that said,

72
0:03:05.603,000 --> 0:03:07,000
"By 5pm today, spend this money on yourself."

73
0:03:08.622,000 --> 0:03:1,000
We gave some examples of what you could spend it on.

74
0:03:11.219,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Other people got a slip of paper that said,

75
0:03:13.308,000 --> 0:03:16,000
"By 5pm today, spend this money on somebody else."

76
0:03:16.447,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Also inside the envelope was money.

77
0:03:18.661,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And we manipulated how much money we gave them;

78
0:03:20.896,000 --> 0:03:22,000
some people got this slip of paper and five dollars,

79
0:03:23.547,000 --> 0:03:25,000
some got this slip of paper and 20 dollars.

80
0:03:26.183,000 --> 0:03:29,000
We let them go about their day and do whatever they wanted.

81
0:03:29.214,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We found out they did spend it in the way we asked them to.

82
0:03:32.215,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We called them up and asked them, "What did you spend it on?

83
0:03:35.156,000 --> 0:03:36,000
How happy do you feel now?"

84
0:03:36.496,000 --> 0:03:37,000
What did they spend it on?

85
0:03:37.771,000 --> 0:03:38,000
These are college undergrads;

86
0:03:39.192,000 --> 0:03:41,000
a lot of what they spent it on for themselves

87
0:03:41.331,000 --> 0:03:42,000
were things like earrings and makeup.

88
0:03:43.151,000 --> 0:03:45,000
One woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece.

89
0:03:45.854,000 --> 0:03:46,000
People gave money to homeless people.

90
0:03:47.657,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Huge effect here of Starbucks.

91
0:03:49.724,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter)

92
0:03:51.472,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So if you give undergraduates five dollars,

93
0:03:53.512,000 --> 0:03:54,000
it looks like coffee to them,

94
0:03:54.934,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can.

95
0:03:58.006,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Some people bought coffee for themselves, the way they usually would,

96
0:04:01.34,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but others bought coffee for somebody else.

97
0:04:03.483,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So the very same purchase,

98
0:04:05.183,000 --> 0:04:08,000
just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else.

99
0:04:08.521,000 --> 0:04:1,000
What did we find when we called at the end of the day?

100
0:04:11.108,000 --> 0:04:13,000
People who spent money on others got happier;

101
0:04:13.267,000 --> 0:04:15,000
people who spent it on themselves, nothing happened.

102
0:04:15.781,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It didn't make them less happy, it just didn't do much for them.

103
0:04:18.833,000 --> 0:04:21,000
The other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn't matter much.

104
0:04:21.96,000 --> 0:04:23,000
People thought 20 dollars would be way better than five.

105
0:04:24.629,000 --> 0:04:26,000
In fact, it doesn't matter how much money you spent.

106
0:04:27.11,000 --> 0:04:29,000
What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else

107
0:04:29.83,000 --> 0:04:3,000
rather than on yourself.

108
0:04:31.025,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We see this again and again

109
0:04:32.355,000 --> 0:04:35,000
when we give people money to spend on others instead of on themselves.

110
0:04:35.737,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Of course, these are undergraduates in Canada --

111
0:04:38.027,000 --> 0:04:4,000
not the world's most representative population.

112
0:04:40.266,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They're also fairly wealthy and affluent and other sorts of things.

113
0:04:43.444,000 --> 0:04:45,000
We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world

114
0:04:46.234,000 --> 0:04:47,000
or just among wealthy countries.

115
0:04:47.803,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So we went to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment.

116
0:04:50.633,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Imagine, instead of just people in Canada, we say,

117
0:04:53.01,000 --> 0:04:55,000
"Name the last time you spent money on yourself or others.

118
0:04:55.792,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Describe it. How happy did it make you?"

119
0:04:57.733,000 --> 0:05:,000
Or in Uganda, "Name the last time you spent money on yourself or others

120
0:05:01.175,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and describe that."

121
0:05:02.356,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Then we asked them how happy they are, again.

122
0:05:04.541,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And what we see is sort of amazing,

123
0:05:06.245,000 --> 0:05:09,000
because there's human universals on what you do with your money,

124
0:05:09.314,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and real cultural differences on what you do as well.

125
0:05:11.825,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So for example, one guy from Uganda says this:

126
0:05:15.153,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"I called a girl I wished to love."

127
0:05:17.053,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They basically went out on a date,

128
0:05:18.86,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and he says at the end that he didn't "achieve" her up till now.

129
0:05:22.136,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:23.324,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Here's a guy from Canada.

131
0:05:25.319,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Very similar thing.

132
0:05:27.05,000 --> 0:05:28,000
"I took my girlfriend out for dinner.

133
0:05:29.065,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We went to a movie, we left early,

134
0:05:30.93,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and then went back to her room for ... cake," just cake.

135
0:05:34.753,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

136
0:05:36.131,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Human universal:

137
0:05:37.308,000 --> 0:05:39,000
you spend money on others, you're being nice.

138
0:05:39.568,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Maybe you have something in mind, maybe not.

139
0:05:41.657,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But then we see extraordinary differences.

140
0:05:43.733,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So look at these two.

141
0:05:44.91,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This is a woman from Canada.

142
0:05:46.288,000 --> 0:05:48,000
We say, "Name a time you spent money on somebody else."

143
0:05:48.888,000 --> 0:05:49,000
She says, "I bought a present for my mom.

144
0:05:50.889,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I drove to the mall, bought a present, gave it to my mom."

145
0:05:53.639,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Perfectly nice thing to do.

146
0:05:54.966,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It's good to get gifts for people you know.

147
0:05:57.045,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Compare that to this woman from Uganda:

148
0:05:59.401,000 --> 0:06:02,000
"I was walking and met a longtime friend whose son was sick with malaria.

149
0:06:03.119,000 --> 0:06:06,000
They had no money, they went to a clinic and I gave her this money."

150
0:06:06.517,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This isn't $10,000, it's the local currency.

151
0:06:08.75,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So it's a very small amount of money, in fact.

152
0:06:10.966,000 --> 0:06:12,000
But enormously different motivations here.

153
0:06:13.099,000 --> 0:06:16,000
This is a real medical need, literally a lifesaving donation.

154
0:06:16.651,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Above, it's just kind of, I bought a gift for my mother.

155
0:06:19.423,000 --> 0:06:2,000
What we see again, though,

156
0:06:21.058,000 --> 0:06:24,000
is that the specific way you spend on other people isn't nearly as important

157
0:06:24.732,000 --> 0:06:27,000
as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy,

158
0:06:28.706,000 --> 0:06:29,000
which is really quite important.

159
0:06:30.289,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So you don't have to do amazing things with your money

160
0:06:32.854,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to make yourself happy.

161
0:06:34.029,000 --> 0:06:37,000
You can do small, trivial things and still get the benefits from doing this.

162
0:06:37.656,000 --> 0:06:38,000
These are only two countries.

163
0:06:39.089,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We wanted to look at every country in the world if we could,

164
0:06:42.062,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to see what the relationship is between money and happiness.

165
0:06:44.985,000 --> 0:06:45,000
We got data from the Gallup Organization,

166
0:06:46.993,000 --> 0:06:48,000
which you know from all the political polls happening lately.

167
0:06:49.892,000 --> 0:06:51,000
They asked people, "Did you donate money to charity recently?"

168
0:06:52.849,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and, "How happy are you with life in general?"

169
0:06:55.046,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We can see what the relationship is between those two things.

170
0:06:57.947,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Are they positively correlated, giving money makes you happy?

171
0:07:00.883,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Or are they negatively correlated?

172
0:07:02.547,000 --> 0:07:04,000
On this map, green will mean they're positively correlated,

173
0:07:05.366,000 --> 0:07:06,000
red means they're negatively correlated.

174
0:07:07.31,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And you can see, the world is crazily green.

175
0:07:09.431,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So in almost every country in the world where we have this data,

176
0:07:12.718,000 --> 0:07:14,000
people who give money to charity are happier people

177
0:07:15.199,000 --> 0:07:17,000
than people who don't give money to charity.

178
0:07:17.353,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I know you're looking at the red country in the middle.

179
0:07:19.991,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is,

180
0:07:22.169,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but it's Central African Republic.

181
0:07:23.828,000 --> 0:07:24,000
You can make up stories.

182
0:07:25.004,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Maybe it's different there for some reason.

183
0:07:27.04,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Just below that to the right is Rwanda, though,

184
0:07:29.278,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which is amazingly green.

185
0:07:30.516,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So almost everywhere we look,

186
0:07:31.926,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we see that giving money away makes you happier

187
0:07:34.383,000 --> 0:07:35,000
than keeping it for yourself.

188
0:07:35.953,000 --> 0:07:37,000
What about work, which is where we spend the rest of our time,

189
0:07:38.942,000 --> 0:07:39,000
when we're not with the people we know.

190
0:07:40.828,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing.

191
0:07:44.075,000 --> 0:07:45,000
These are sales teams in Belgium.

192
0:07:45.904,000 --> 0:07:48,000
They work in teams, go out and sell to doctors

193
0:07:48.977,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and try to get them to buy drugs.

194
0:07:50.577,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We can look and see how well they sell things

195
0:07:52.747,000 --> 0:07:54,000
as a function of being a member of a team.

196
0:07:55.014,000 --> 0:07:57,000
We give people on some teams some money

197
0:07:57.644,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"Spend it however you want on yourself,"

198
0:07:59.632,000 --> 0:08:01,000
just like we did with the undergrads in Canada.

199
0:08:01.906,000 --> 0:08:04,000
To other teams we say, "Here's 15 euro. Spend it on one of your teammates.

200
0:08:05.6,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Buy them something as a gift and give it to them.

201
0:08:08.288,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Then we can see, we've got teams that spend on themselves

202
0:08:11.012,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and these pro-social teams who we give money to make the team better.

203
0:08:14.807,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The reason I have a ridiculous pinata there

204
0:08:16.86,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is one team pooled their money and bought a pinata,

205
0:08:19.299,000 --> 0:08:22,000
they smashed the pinata, the candy fell out and things like that.

206
0:08:22.404,000 --> 0:08:23,000
A silly, trivial thing to do,

207
0:08:23.868,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but think of the difference on a team that didn't do that at all,

208
0:08:27.197,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that got 15 euro, put it in their pocket, maybe bought themselves a coffee,

209
0:08:30.795,000 --> 0:08:32,000
or teams that had this pro-social experience

210
0:08:32.879,000 --> 0:08:35,000
where they bonded together to buy something and do a group activity.

211
0:08:36.194,000 --> 0:08:39,000
What we see is that the teams that are pro-social sell more stuff

212
0:08:39.287,000 --> 0:08:41,000
than the teams that only got money for themselves.

213
0:08:41.706,000 --> 0:08:44,000
One way to think of it is: for every 15 euro you give people for themselves,

214
0:08:45.373,000 --> 0:08:48,000
they put it in their pocket and don't do anything different than before.

215
0:08:48.805,000 --> 0:08:49,000
You don't get money from that;

216
0:08:50.27,000 --> 0:08:53,000
you lose money, since it doesn't motivate them to perform better.

217
0:08:53.373,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates,

218
0:08:56.199,000 --> 0:08:57,000
they do so much better on their teams

219
0:08:57.997,000 --> 0:09:,000
that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money.

220
0:09:01.115,000 --> 0:09:03,000
You're probably thinking to yourselves, this is all fine,

221
0:09:03.821,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but there's a context that's incredibly important for public policy,

222
0:09:07.048,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and I can't imagine it would work there.

223
0:09:08.986,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And if he doesn't show me that it works here,

224
0:09:11.117,000 --> 0:09:12,000
I don't believe anything he said.

225
0:09:12.755,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I know what you're all thinking about are dodgeball teams.

226
0:09:15.566,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Laughter)

227
0:09:16.981,000 --> 0:09:17,000
This was a huge criticism that we got,

228
0:09:18.86,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that if you can't show it with dodgeball teams, this is all stupid.

229
0:09:22.065,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So we went and found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them,

230
0:09:26.272,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and did the exact same thing as before.

231
0:09:28.174,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So we give people on some teams money to spend on themselves.

232
0:09:31.118,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Other teams, we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates.

233
0:09:34.86,000 --> 0:09:35,000
The teams that spend money on themselves

234
0:09:36.86,000 --> 0:09:38,000
have the same winning percentages as before.

235
0:09:39.07,000 --> 0:09:41,000
The teams we give the money to spend on each other

236
0:09:41.513,000 --> 0:09:42,000
become different teams;

237
0:09:42.692,000 --> 0:09:44,000
they dominate the league by the time they're done.

238
0:09:45.267,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Across all of these different contexts --

239
0:09:47.3,000 --> 0:09:5,000
your personal life, you work life, even things like intramural sports --

240
0:09:50.932,000 --> 0:09:52,000
we see spending on other people has a bigger return for you

241
0:09:53.766,000 --> 0:09:54,000
than spending on yourself.

242
0:09:55.764,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So if you think money can't buy happiness, you're not spending it right.

243
0:09:59.589,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The implication isn't you should buy this product instead of that product,

244
0:10:03.193,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and that's the way to make yourself happier.

245
0:10:05.347,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself,

246
0:10:09.006,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and try giving some of it to other people instead.

247
0:10:11.86,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And we luckily have an opportunity for you.

248
0:10:14.388,000 --> 0:10:18,000
DonorsChoose.org is a nonprofit for mainly public school teachers

249
0:10:18.482,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in low-income schools.

250
0:10:19.939,000 --> 0:10:2,000
They post projects like,

251
0:10:21.256,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"I want to teach Huckleberry Finn and we don't have the books,"

252
0:10:24.3,000 --> 0:10:26,000
or, "I want a microscope to teach my students science

253
0:10:26.81,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and we don't have a microscope."

254
0:10:28.363,000 --> 0:10:29,000
You and I can go on and buy it for them.

255
0:10:30.338,000 --> 0:10:32,000
The teacher and the kids write you thank-you notes,

256
0:10:32.837,000 --> 0:10:34,000
sometimes they send pictures of them using the microscope.

257
0:10:35.674,000 --> 0:10:36,000
It's an extraordinary thing.

258
0:10:37.044,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking

259
0:10:40.184,000 --> 0:10:42,000
less about "How can I spend money on myself?"

260
0:10:42.312,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and more about "If I've got five dollars or 15 dollars,

261
0:10:45.193,000 --> 0:10:47,000
what can I do to benefit other people?"

262
0:10:47.362,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Ultimately, when you do that, you'll find you benefit yourself much more.

263
0:10:50.872,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Thank you.

264
0:10:52.087,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.865,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I would like to invite you

2
0:00:14.611,000 --> 0:00:15,000
to come along on a visit

3
0:00:16.341,000 --> 0:00:17,000
to a dark continent.

4
0:00:18.399,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It is the continent hidden

5
0:00:20.037,000 --> 0:00:22,000
under the surface of the earth.

6
0:00:22.113,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It is largely unexplored,

7
0:00:24.43,000 --> 0:00:26,000
poorly understood, and the stuff of legends.

8
0:00:27.137,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But it is made also of dramatic landscapes

9
0:00:29.999,000 --> 0:00:31,000
like this huge underground chamber,

10
0:00:32.518,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and it is rich with surprising biological and mineralogical worlds.

11
0:00:38.149,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Thanks to the efforts of intrepid voyagers in the last three centuries --

12
0:00:42.999,000 --> 0:00:45,000
actually, we know also thanks to satellite technology, of course --

13
0:00:46.857,000 --> 0:00:5,000
we know almost every single square meter of our planet's surface.

14
0:00:51.085,000 --> 0:00:55,000
However, we know still very little about what is hidden inside the earth.

15
0:00:56.05,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Because a cave landscape, like this deep shaft in Italy, is hidden,

16
0:01:01.999,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the potential of cave exploration -- the geographical dimension --

17
0:01:05.377,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is poorly understood and unappreciated.

18
0:01:07.769,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Because we are creatures living on the surface,

19
0:01:10.828,000 --> 0:01:14,000
our perception of the inner side of the planet

20
0:01:14.999,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is in some ways skewed,

21
0:01:16.987,000 --> 0:01:18,000
as is that of the depth of the oceans

22
0:01:19.463,000 --> 0:01:21,000
or of the upper atmosphere.

23
0:01:23.094,000 --> 0:01:29,000
However, since systematic cave exploration started about one century ago,

24
0:01:30.076,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we know actually that caves exist in every continent of the world.

25
0:01:34.471,000 --> 0:01:38,000
A single cave system, like Mammoth Cave, which is in Kentucky,

26
0:01:38.539,000 --> 0:01:41,000
can be as long as more than 600 kilometers.

27
0:01:43.27,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And an abyss like Krubera Voronya, which is in the Caucasus region,

28
0:01:47.401,000 --> 0:01:49,000
actually the deepest cave explored in the world,

29
0:01:50.203,000 --> 0:01:54,000
can go as far as more than 2,000 meters below the surface.

30
0:01:54.548,000 --> 0:01:57,000
That means a journey of weeks for a cave explorer.

31
0:01:59.545,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Caves form in karstic regions.

32
0:02:02.795,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So karstic regions are areas of the world

33
0:02:05.999,000 --> 0:02:08,000
where the infiltrating water along cracks, fractures,

34
0:02:09.513,000 --> 0:02:12,000
can easily dissolve soluble lithologies,

35
0:02:13.497,000 --> 0:02:15,000
forming a drainage system of tunnels, conduits --

36
0:02:16.301,000 --> 0:02:18,000
a three-dimensional network, actually.

37
0:02:18.804,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Karstic regions cover almost 20 percent of the continents' surface,

38
0:02:24.707,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and we know actually that speleologists in the last 50 years

39
0:02:29.855,000 --> 0:02:34,000
have explored roughly 30,000 kilometers of cave passages around the world,

40
0:02:35.543,000 --> 0:02:36,000
which is a big number.

41
0:02:36.935,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But geologists have estimated that what is still missing,

42
0:02:41.458,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to be discovered and mapped,

43
0:02:43.712,000 --> 0:02:46,000
is something around 10 million kilometers.

44
0:02:47.287,000 --> 0:02:5,000
That means that for each meter of a cave that we already know,

45
0:02:50.601,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that we have explored,

46
0:02:52.158,000 --> 0:02:57,000
there are still some tens of kilometers of undiscovered passages.

47
0:02:57.576,000 --> 0:02:59,000
That means that this is really an endless continent,

48
0:03:00.515,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and we will never be able to explore it completely.

49
0:03:04.597,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And this estimation is made without considering other types of caves,

50
0:03:08.117,000 --> 0:03:12,000
like, for example, inside glaciers or even volcanic caves,

51
0:03:12.58,000 --> 0:03:15,000
which are not karstic, but are formed by lava flows.

52
0:03:16.136,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And if we have a look at other planets like, for example, Mars,

53
0:03:21.816,000 --> 0:03:22,000
you will see that this characteristic

54
0:03:23.69,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is not so specific of our home planet.

55
0:03:27.623,000 --> 0:03:31,000
However, I will show to you now that we do not need to go to Mars

56
0:03:31.999,000 --> 0:03:33,000
to explore alien worlds.

57
0:03:35.75,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I'm a speleologist, that means a cave explorer.

58
0:03:39.714,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And I started with this passion when I was really young

59
0:03:43.646,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in the mountains not far from my hometown in North Italy,

60
0:03:47.731,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in the karstic regions of the Alps and the Dolomites.

61
0:03:51.252,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But soon, the quest for exploration brought me to the farthest corner

62
0:03:55.117,000 --> 0:03:57,000
of the planet, searching for new potential entrances

63
0:03:57.87,000 --> 0:03:58,000
of this undiscovered continent.

64
0:04:00.578,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And in 2009, I had the opportunity to visit the tepui table mountains,

65
0:04:05.663,000 --> 0:04:07,000
which are in the Orinoco and Amazon basins.

66
0:04:08.683,000 --> 0:04:12,000
These massifs enchanted me from the first time I saw them.

67
0:04:13.259,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They are surrounded by vertical, vertiginous rock walls

68
0:04:16.65,000 --> 0:04:19,000
with silvery waterfalls that are lost in the forest.

69
0:04:20.145,000 --> 0:04:23,000
They really inspired in me a sense of wilderness,

70
0:04:23.501,000 --> 0:04:26,000
with a soul older than millions and millions of years.

71
0:04:27.48,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And this dramatic landscape inspired among other things

72
0:04:31.415,000 --> 0:04:35,000
also Conan Doyle's "The Lost World" novel in 1912.

73
0:04:35.999,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And they are, really, a lost world.

74
0:04:41.001,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Scientists consider those mountains as islands in time,

75
0:04:46.31,000 --> 0:04:48,000
being separated from the surrounding lowlands

76
0:04:48.972,000 --> 0:04:5,000
since tens of millions of years ago.

77
0:04:51.68,000 --> 0:04:54,000
They are surrounded by up to 1,000-meter-high walls,

78
0:04:55.605,000 --> 0:04:58,000
resembling a fortress, impregnable by humans.

79
0:04:58.761,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And, in fact, only a few of these mountains have been climbed

80
0:05:01.999,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and explored on their top.

81
0:05:04.74,000 --> 0:05:06,000
These mountains contain also a scientific paradox:

82
0:05:07.633,000 --> 0:05:09,000
They are made by quartz,

83
0:05:09.717,000 --> 0:05:12,000
which is a very common mineral on the earth's crust,

84
0:05:12.908,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and the rock made up by quartz is called quartzite,

85
0:05:17.31,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and quartzite is one of the hardest and least soluble minerals on earth.

86
0:05:22.642,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So we do not expect at all to find a cave there.

87
0:05:26.057,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Despite this, in the last 10 years, speleologists from Italy,

88
0:05:30.999,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Slovakia, Czech Republic, and, of course, Venezuela and Brazil,

89
0:05:34.828,000 --> 0:05:36,000
have explored several caves in this area.

90
0:05:37.831,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So how can it be possible?

91
0:05:40.342,000 --> 0:05:44,000
To understand this contradiction, we have to consider the time factor,

92
0:05:44.427,000 --> 0:05:47,000
because the history of the tepuis is extremely long,

93
0:05:47.754,000 --> 0:05:51,000
starting about 1.6 billion years ago with the formation of the rock,

94
0:05:52.435,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and then evolving with the uplift of the region 150 million years ago,

95
0:05:58.999,000 --> 0:06:,000
after the disruption of the Pangaea supercontinent

96
0:06:01.999,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and the opening of the Atlantic Ocean.

97
0:06:04.376,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So you can imagine that the water had tens or even hundreds of millions of years

98
0:06:10.71,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to sculpt the strangest forms on the tepuis' surfaces,

99
0:06:14.792,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but also to open the fractures and form stone cities, rock cities,

100
0:06:20.83,000 --> 0:06:25,000
fields of towers which are characterized in the famous landscape of the tepuis.

101
0:06:26.375,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But nobody could have imagined

102
0:06:27.843,000 --> 0:06:31,000
what was happening inside a mountain in so long a time frame.

103
0:06:32.603,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And so I was focusing in 2010 on one of those massifs,

104
0:06:37.104,000 --> 0:06:4,000
the Auyán-tepui, which is very famous because it hosts Angel Falls,

105
0:06:40.979,000 --> 0:06:42,000
which is the highest waterfall in the world --

106
0:06:43.592,000 --> 0:06:47,000
about 979 meters of vertical drop.

107
0:06:47.675,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And I was searching for hints of the existence of cave systems

108
0:06:52.585,000 --> 0:06:53,000
through satellite images,

109
0:06:54.477,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and finally we identified an area of collapses of the surface --

110
0:06:59.191,000 --> 0:07:01,000
so, big boulders, rock piles --

111
0:07:01.461,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and that means that there was a void below.

112
0:07:04.796,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It was a clear indication that there was something inside the mountain.

113
0:07:08.769,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So we did several attempts to reach this area,

114
0:07:13.639,000 --> 0:07:14,000
by land and with a helicopter,

115
0:07:15.425,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but it was really difficult because -- you have to imagine

116
0:07:18.999,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that these mountains are covered by clouds most of the year, by fog.

117
0:07:23.402,000 --> 0:07:24,000
There are strong winds,

118
0:07:24.799,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and there are almost 4,000 millimeters of rainfall per year,

119
0:07:29.405,000 --> 0:07:32,000
so it's really, really difficult to find good conditions.

120
0:07:32.691,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And only in 2013 we finally landed on the spot

121
0:07:37.498,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and we started the exploration of the cave.

122
0:07:40.723,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The cave is huge.

123
0:07:42.664,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It's a huge network under the surface of the tepui plateau,

124
0:07:46.515,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and in only ten days of expedition,

125
0:07:50.233,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we explored more than 20 kilometers of cave passages.

126
0:07:54.38,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And it's a huge network of underground rivers,

127
0:07:59.801,000 --> 0:08:04,000
channels, big rooms, extremely deep shafts.

128
0:08:04.999,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So it's really an incredible place.

129
0:08:08.047,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And we named it Imawarì Yeuta.

130
0:08:10.612,000 --> 0:08:16,000
That means, in the Pemón indigenous language, "The House of the Gods."

131
0:08:16.897,000 --> 0:08:19,000
You have to imagine that indigenous people have never been there.

132
0:08:20.703,000 --> 0:08:23,000
It was impossible for them to reach this area.

133
0:08:24.232,000 --> 0:08:26,000
However, there were legends about the existence

134
0:08:26.462,000 --> 0:08:28,000
of a cave in the mountain.

135
0:08:28.513,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So when we started the exploration,

136
0:08:30.307,000 --> 0:08:32,000
we had to explore with a great respect,

137
0:08:32.561,000 --> 0:08:35,000
both because of the religious beliefs of the indigenous people,

138
0:08:36.146,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but also because it was really a sacred place,

139
0:08:38.535,000 --> 0:08:41,000
because no human had entered there before.

140
0:08:41.894,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So we had to use special protocols

141
0:08:43.721,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to not contaminate the environment with our presence,

142
0:08:46.534,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and we tried also to share with the community,

143
0:08:48.733,000 --> 0:08:5,000
with the indigenous community, our discoveries.

144
0:08:51.43,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And the caves represent, really, a snapshot of the past.

145
0:08:56.503,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The time needed for their formation

146
0:08:59.239,000 --> 0:09:03,000
could be as long as 50 or even 100 million years,

147
0:09:04.187,000 --> 0:09:08,000
which makes them possibly the oldest caves that we can explore on earth.

148
0:09:10.921,000 --> 0:09:15,000
What you can find there is really evidence of a lost world.

149
0:09:17.301,000 --> 0:09:18,000
When you enter a quartzite cave,

150
0:09:19.312,000 --> 0:09:22,000
you have to completely forget what you know about caves --

151
0:09:22.784,000 --> 0:09:24,000
classic limestone caves or the touristic caves

152
0:09:25.805,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that you can visit in several places in the world.

153
0:09:28.186,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Because what seems a simple stalactite here

154
0:09:31.135,000 --> 0:09:36,000
is not made by calcium carbonate, but is made by opal,

155
0:09:36.244,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and one of those stalactites can require tens of millions of years to be formed.

156
0:09:42.685,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But you can find even stranger forms, like these mushrooms of silica

157
0:09:46.786,000 --> 0:09:48,000
growing on a boulder.

158
0:09:48.884,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And you can imagine our talks when we were exploring the cave.

159
0:09:52.694,000 --> 0:09:56,000
We were the first entering and discovering those unknown things,

160
0:09:57.711,000 --> 0:09:59,000
things like those monster eggs.

161
0:10:00.573,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And we were a bit scared because it was all a discovery,

162
0:10:04.993,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and we didn't want to find a dinosaur.

163
0:10:07.1,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We didn't find a dinosaur.

164
0:10:08.628,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Laughter)

165
0:10:10.249,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Anyway, actually, we know that this kind of formation,

166
0:10:13.57,000 --> 0:10:15,000
after several studies,

167
0:10:16.127,000 --> 0:10:19,000
we know that these kinds of formations are living organisms.

168
0:10:19.376,000 --> 0:10:24,000
They are bacterial colonies using silica to build mineral structures

169
0:10:24.834,000 --> 0:10:25,000
resembling stromatolites.

170
0:10:26.788,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Stromatolites are some of the oldest forms of life that we can find on earth.

171
0:10:31.333,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And here in the tepuis,

172
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
the interesting thing is that these bacteria colonies have evolved

173
0:10:37.867,000 --> 0:10:41,000
in complete isolation from the external surface,

174
0:10:42.12,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and without being in contact with humans.

175
0:10:44.768,000 --> 0:10:46,000
They have never been in contact with humans.

176
0:10:47.389,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So the implications for science are enormous,

177
0:10:50.48,000 --> 0:10:54,000
because here you could find, for example, microbes

178
0:10:54.506,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that could be useful to resolve diseases in medicine,

179
0:10:59.482,000 --> 0:11:02,000
or you could find even a new kind of material with unknown properties.

180
0:11:03.442,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And, in fact, we discovered in the cave a new mineral structure for science,

181
0:11:07.525,000 --> 0:11:1,000
which is rossiantonite, a phosphate-sulfate.

182
0:11:11.606,000 --> 0:11:15,000
So whatever you find in the cave, even a small cricket,

183
0:11:16.344,000 --> 0:11:19,000
has evolved in the dark in complete isolation.

184
0:11:20.336,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And, really, everything that you can feel in the cave are real connections

185
0:11:24.613,000 --> 0:11:27,000
between the biological and the mineralogical world.

186
0:11:28.544,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So as we explore this dark continent

187
0:11:34.384,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and discover its mineralogical and biological diversity and uniqueness,

188
0:11:40.812,000 --> 0:11:44,000
we will find probably clues about the origin of life on our planet

189
0:11:45.205,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and on the relationship and evolution of life

190
0:11:48.206,000 --> 0:11:5,000
in relationship with the mineral world.

191
0:11:51.216,000 --> 0:11:54,000
What seems only a dark, empty environment

192
0:11:55.182,000 --> 0:11:57,000
could be in reality a chest of wonders

193
0:11:57.999,000 --> 0:11:59,000
full of useful information.

194
0:12:02.102,000 --> 0:12:05,000
With a team of Italian, Venezuelan and Brazilian speleologists,

195
0:12:05.999,000 --> 0:12:08,000
which is called La Venta Teraphosa,

196
0:12:09.214,000 --> 0:12:11,000
we will be back soon to Latin America,

197
0:12:11.306,000 --> 0:12:16,000
because we want to explore other tepuis in the farthest areas of the Amazon.

198
0:12:16.778,000 --> 0:12:19,000
There are still very unknown mountains,

199
0:12:19.822,000 --> 0:12:23,000
like Marahuaca, which is almost 3,000 meters high above sea level,

200
0:12:24.54,000 --> 0:12:28,000
or Aracà, which is in the upper region of Rio Negro in Brazil.

201
0:12:28.663,000 --> 0:12:32,000
And we suppose that we could find there even bigger cave systems,

202
0:12:33.606,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and each one with its own undiscovered world.

203
0:12:38.636,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Thank you.

204
0:12:39.834,000 --> 0:12:44,000
(Applause)

205
0:12:45.312,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Francesco. Give me that to start so we don't forget.

206
0:12:49.073,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Francesco, you said we don't need to go to Mars to find alien life,

207
0:12:52.935,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and indeed, last time we spoke, you were in Sardinia

208
0:12:55.884,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and you were training European astronauts.

209
0:12:58.151,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So what do you, a speleologist, tell and teach to the astronauts?

210
0:13:01.649,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Francesco Sauro: Yeah, we are -- it's a program of training

211
0:13:04.456,000 --> 0:13:08,000
for not only European, but also NASA, Roskosmos, JAXA astronauts, in a cave.

212
0:13:09.381,000 --> 0:13:12,000
So they stay in a cave for about one week in isolation.

213
0:13:12.933,000 --> 0:13:15,000
They have to work together in a real, real dangerous environment,

214
0:13:16.837,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and it's a real alien environment for them because it's unusual.

215
0:13:20.671,000 --> 0:13:24,000
It's always dark. They have to do science. They have a lot of tasks.

216
0:13:24.999,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And it's very similar to a journey to Mars

217
0:13:27.555,000 --> 0:13:28,000
or the International Space Station.

218
0:13:29.251,000 --> 0:13:3,000
BG: In principle. FS: Yes.

219
0:13:30.534,000 --> 0:13:32,000
BG: I want to go back to one of the pictures

220
0:13:32.635,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that was in your slide show,

221
0:13:34.492,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and it's just representative of the other photos --

222
0:13:36.905,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Weren't those photos amazing? Yeah?

223
0:13:39.227,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Audience: Yeah!

224
0:13:40.409,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(Applause)

225
0:13:44.169,000 --> 0:13:47,000
FS: I have to thank the photographers from the team La Venta,

226
0:13:47.319,000 --> 0:13:5,000
because all of those photos are from the photographers.

227
0:13:51.116,000 --> 0:13:54,000
BG: You bring, actually, photographers with you in the expedition.

228
0:13:54.842,000 --> 0:13:56,000
They're professionals, they're speleologists and photographers.

229
0:13:57.833,000 --> 0:14:01,000
But when I look at these pictures, I wonder: there is zero light down there,

230
0:14:02.757,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and yet they look incredibly well-exposed.

231
0:14:05.564,000 --> 0:14:06,000
How do you take these pictures?

232
0:14:07.076,000 --> 0:14:1,000
How do your colleagues, the photographers, take these pictures?

233
0:14:10.151,000 --> 0:14:12,000
FS: Yeah. They are working in a darkroom, basically,

234
0:14:12.666,000 --> 0:14:14,000
so you can open the shutter of the camera

235
0:14:14.809,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and use the lights to paint the environment.

236
0:14:17.251,000 --> 0:14:18,000
BG: So you're basically --

237
0:14:18.53,000 --> 0:14:2,000
FS: Yes. You can even keep the shutter open for one minute

238
0:14:21.289,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and then paint the environment.

239
0:14:22.837,000 --> 0:14:24,000
The final result is what you want to achieve.

240
0:14:25.565,000 --> 0:14:28,000
BG: You spray the environment with light and that's what you get.

241
0:14:28.662,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Maybe we can try this at home someday, I don't know.

242
0:14:31.128,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Laughter)

243
0:14:32.156,000 --> 0:14:33,000
BG: Francesco, grazie. FS: Grazie.

244
0:14:33.771,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Applause)

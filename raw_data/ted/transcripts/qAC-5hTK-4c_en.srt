2
0:00:12.708,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So I have a confession to make.

3
0:00:15.583,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I only recently learned how to drive.

4
0:00:18.75,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And it was really hard.

5
0:00:21.125,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Now, this wasn't an older brain thing.

6
0:00:24.208,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Do you remember what it was like when you first learned how to drive?

7
0:00:27.5,000 --> 0:00:29,000
When every decision you made was so conscious and deliberate?

8
0:00:31.208,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I'd come home from my lessons completely wiped out mentally.

9
0:00:35.458,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now, as a cognitive scientist I know that this is because I was using

10
0:00:38.917,000 --> 0:00:41,000
a lot of something called executive function.

11
0:00:43.375,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Executive function is our amazing ability to consciously control our thoughts,

12
0:00:48.792,000 --> 0:00:49,000
emotions and actions

13
0:00:50.625,000 --> 0:00:52,000
in order to achieve goals ...

14
0:00:52.667,000 --> 0:00:53,000
like learning how to drive.

15
0:00:55,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's what we use when we need to break away from habit,

16
0:00:58.042,000 --> 0:01:,000
inhibit our impulses and plan ahead.

17
0:01:01.708,000 --> 0:01:03,000
But we can see it most clearly when things go wrong.

18
0:01:05.25,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Like, have you ever accidentally poured orange juice on your cereal?

19
0:01:08.667,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:10.75,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Or, ever start scrolling on Facebook

21
0:01:12.667,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and suddenly realize you've missed a meeting?

22
0:01:14.833,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:16.167,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Or maybe this one's more familiar:

24
0:01:17.833,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Ever plan to stop at the store on the way home from work

25
0:01:20.542,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and then drive all the way home instead on autopilot?

26
0:01:23.417,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:25.625,000 --> 0:01:27,000
These things happen to everyone.

28
0:01:28.042,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And we usually call it absentmindedness,

29
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but what's really happening

30
0:01:31.333,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is we're experiencing a lapse in executive function.

31
0:01:35.625,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So we use executive function every day in all aspects of our lives.

32
0:01:40.042,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And over the past 30 years,

33
0:01:41.5,000 --> 0:01:44,000
researchers have found that it predicts all kinds of good things

34
0:01:45.292,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in childhood and beyond,

35
0:01:47.5,000 --> 0:01:51,000
like social skills, academic achievement, mental and physical health,

36
0:01:52.083,000 --> 0:01:54,000
making money, saving money

37
0:01:54.125,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and even staying out of jail.

38
0:01:56.292,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Sounds great, doesn't it?

39
0:01:58.333,000 --> 0:01:59,000
So it's no surprise

40
0:01:59.792,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that researchers like me are so interested in understanding it

41
0:02:03.25,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and figuring out ways to improve it.

42
0:02:07.167,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But lately, executive function has become a huge self-improvement buzzword.

43
0:02:13.042,000 --> 0:02:16,000
People think you can improve it through brain-training iPhone apps

44
0:02:16.417,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and computer games,

45
0:02:17.875,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or by practicing it in a specific way, like playing chess.

46
0:02:22.25,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And researchers are trying to train it in the lab

47
0:02:25.333,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in the hopes of improving it and other things related to it,

48
0:02:28.292,000 --> 0:02:29,000
like intelligence.

49
0:02:31.333,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Well, I'm here to tell you

50
0:02:32.833,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that this way of thinking about executive function is all wrong.

51
0:02:36.792,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Brain training won't improve executive function in a broad sense

52
0:02:40.375,000 --> 0:02:43,000
because it involves exercising it in a narrow way,

53
0:02:43.625,000 --> 0:02:47,000
outside of the real-world contexts in which we actually use it.

54
0:02:48.875,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So you can master that executive function app on your phone,

55
0:02:51.75,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but that's not going to help you stop pouring OJ on your Cheeerios twice a week.

56
0:02:55.538,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:56.667,000 --> 0:02:58,000
If you really want to improve your executive function

58
0:02:59.208,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in a way that matters for your life,

59
0:03:01.417,000 --> 0:03:04,000
you have to understand how it's influenced by context.

60
0:03:06.083,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Let me show you what I mean.

61
0:03:07.708,000 --> 0:03:09,000
There's a great test that we use in the lab

62
0:03:10.083,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to measure executive function in young children

63
0:03:12.333,000 --> 0:03:14,000
called the "dimensional change card sort."

64
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
In this task, kids have to sort cards in one way --

65
0:03:19.458,000 --> 0:03:2,000
like by shape --

66
0:03:21,000 --> 0:03:23,000
over and over until they build up a habit.

67
0:03:23.792,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And then they're asked to switch

68
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and sort the same cards in another way,

69
0:03:28.875,000 --> 0:03:29,000
like by color.

70
0:03:31.083,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now, really young kids struggle with this.

71
0:03:34.333,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Three- and four-year-olds will usually keep sorting the cards in the old way

72
0:03:37.958,000 --> 0:03:4,000
no matter how many times you remind them of what they should be doing.

73
0:03:42.125,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Video) Woman: If it's blue, put it here. If it's red, put it here.

74
0:03:45.333,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Here's a blue one.

75
0:03:47.083,000 --> 0:03:49,000
OK, so now we're going to play a different game.

76
0:03:49.375,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We're not going to play the color game anymore.

77
0:03:51.625,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Now we're going to play the shape game,

78
0:03:53.542,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and in the shape game,

79
0:03:54.833,000 --> 0:03:57,000
all the stars go here and all the trucks go here, OK?

80
0:03:58.083,000 --> 0:04:,000
Stars go here, trucks go here.

81
0:04:00.167,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Where do the stars go?

82
0:04:02.667,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And where do the trucks go?

83
0:04:04.25,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Excellent.

84
0:04:05.542,000 --> 0:04:07,000
OK, stars go here, trucks go here.

85
0:04:07.875,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Here's a truck.

86
0:04:10.542,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:12.375,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Stars go here, trucks go here.

88
0:04:14.667,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Here's a star.

89
0:04:17.208,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:19.583,000 --> 0:04:2,000
SB: So it's really compelling,

91
0:04:21.5,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and it's really obvious when she fails to use her executive function.

92
0:04:25.625,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But here's the thing:

93
0:04:26.917,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we could train her on this task and others like it

94
0:04:29.666,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and eventually she'd improve,

95
0:04:31.708,000 --> 0:04:32,000
but does that mean

96
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that she would've improved her executive function outside of the lab?

97
0:04:36.292,000 --> 0:04:39,000
No, because in the real world, she'll need to use executive function

98
0:04:39.75,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to do a lot more than switching between shape and color.

99
0:04:43.25,000 --> 0:04:45,000
She'll need to switch from adding to multiplying

100
0:04:46.25,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or from playing to tidying up

101
0:04:48.542,000 --> 0:04:51,000
or from thinking about her own feelings to thinking about her friend.

102
0:04:52.417,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And success in real-world situations depends on things

103
0:04:55.417,000 --> 0:04:58,000
like how motivated you are and what your peers are doing.

104
0:04:59.25,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And it also depends on the strategies that you execute

105
0:05:02.375,000 --> 0:05:05,000
when you're using executive function in a particular situation.

106
0:05:06.667,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So what I'm saying is that context really matters.

107
0:05:11.25,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now let me give you an example from my research.

108
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I recently brought in a bunch of kids to do the classic marshmallow test,

109
0:05:18.417,000 --> 0:05:2,000
which is a measure of delay of gratification

110
0:05:20.625,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that also likely requires a lot of executive function.

111
0:05:24.708,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So you may have heard about this test,

112
0:05:26.583,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but basically, kids are given a choice.

113
0:05:28.625,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They can have one marshmallow right away,

114
0:05:30.958,000 --> 0:05:32,000
or if they can wait for me to go to the other room

115
0:05:33.375,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and get more marshmallows,

116
0:05:34.917,000 --> 0:05:35,000
they can have two instead.

117
0:05:37.417,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Now, most kids really want that second marshmallow,

118
0:05:41.458,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but the key question is: How long can they wait?

119
0:05:44.708,000 --> 0:05:45,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:45.833,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Now, I added a twist to look at the effects of context.

121
0:05:50.75,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I told each kid that they were in a group,

122
0:05:53.75,000 --> 0:05:54,000
like the green group,

123
0:05:55.417,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and I even gave them a green T-shirt to wear.

124
0:05:58.583,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And I said, "Your group waited for two marshmallows,

125
0:06:02.708,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and this other group, the orange group,

126
0:06:05.083,000 --> 0:06:06,000
did not."

127
0:06:06.375,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Or I said the opposite:

128
0:06:07.875,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"Your group didn't wait for two marshmallows

129
0:06:09.958,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and this other group did."

130
0:06:12.042,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And then I left the kid alone in the room

131
0:06:14.375,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and I watched on a webcam to see how long they waited.

132
0:06:17.792,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

133
0:06:21.875,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So what I found was that kids who believed

134
0:06:25.667,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that their group waited for two marshmallows

135
0:06:27.833,000 --> 0:06:29,000
were themselves more likely to wait.

136
0:06:32.042,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So they were influenced by a peer group that they'd never even met.

137
0:06:36.5,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:37.917,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Pretty cool, isn't it?

139
0:06:39.625,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Well, so with this result I still didn't know

140
0:06:42.25,000 --> 0:06:46,000
if they were just copying their group or if it was something deeper than that.

141
0:06:47.333,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So I brought in some more kids,

142
0:06:49.042,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and after the marshmallow test, I showed them pictures of pairs of kids,

143
0:06:54.083,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and I told them, "One of these kids likes to have things right away,

144
0:06:57.792,000 --> 0:06:58,000
like cookies and stickers.

145
0:06:59.792,000 --> 0:07:,000
And the other kid likes to wait

146
0:07:01.333,000 --> 0:07:03,000
so that they can have more of these things."

147
0:07:03.833,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And then I asked them,

148
0:07:05.125,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"Which one of these two kids do you like more

149
0:07:07.292,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and who would you want to play with?"

150
0:07:09.833,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And what I found was that kids who believed that their group waited

151
0:07:13.708,000 --> 0:07:16,000
tended to prefer other kids who liked to wait for things.

152
0:07:17.958,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So learning what their group did made them value waiting more.

153
0:07:22.958,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And not only that,

154
0:07:24.75,000 --> 0:07:26,000
these kids likely used executive function

155
0:07:27.083,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to generate strategies to help themselves wait,

156
0:07:30.167,000 --> 0:07:33,000
like sitting on their hands or turning away from the marshmallow

157
0:07:33.667,000 --> 0:07:36,000
or singing a song to distract themselves.

158
0:07:36.792,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:39.5,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So what this all shows is just how much context matters.

160
0:07:44.083,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It's not that these kids had good executive function or bad,

161
0:07:47.667,000 --> 0:07:5,000
it's that the context helped them use it better.

162
0:07:52.417,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So what does this mean for you and for your kids?

163
0:07:56.5,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Well, let's say that you want to learn Spanish.

164
0:07:59.167,000 --> 0:08:,000
You could try changing your context

165
0:08:00.917,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and surrounding yourself with other people who also want to learn,

166
0:08:04.875,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and even better if these are people that you really like.

167
0:08:07.917,000 --> 0:08:1,000
That way you'll be more motivated to use executive function.

168
0:08:12.167,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Or let's say that you want to help your child do better on her math homework.

169
0:08:16.458,000 --> 0:08:19,000
You could teach her strategies to use executive function

170
0:08:19.625,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in that particular context,

171
0:08:21.583,000 --> 0:08:24,000
like putting her phone away before she starts studying

172
0:08:24.75,000 --> 0:08:27,000
or planning to reward herself after studying for an hour.

173
0:08:29.083,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Now, I don't want to make it sound like context is everything.

174
0:08:32.375,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Executive function is really complex, and it's shaped by numerous factors.

175
0:08:37.375,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But what I want you to remember

176
0:08:38.917,000 --> 0:08:4,000
is if you want to improve your executive function

177
0:08:41.458,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in some aspect of your life,

178
0:08:43.833,000 --> 0:08:45,000
don't look for quick fixes.

179
0:08:46,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Think about the context

180
0:08:47.292,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and how you can make your goals matter more to you,

181
0:08:50.25,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and how you can use strategies

182
0:08:51.75,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to help yourself in that particular situation.

183
0:08:55.332,000 --> 0:09:,000
I think the ancient Greeks said it best when they said, "Know thyself."

184
0:09:00.75,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And a key part of this is knowing how context shapes your behavior

185
0:09:05.083,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and how you can use that knowledge to change for the better.

186
0:09:08.917,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Thank you.

187
0:09:10.208,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.167,000 --> 0:00:17,000
We are all trapped

2
0:00:17.542,000 --> 0:00:19,000
inside our own heads,

3
0:00:19.667,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and our beliefs and our understandings about the world are limited

4
0:00:23.667,000 --> 0:00:24,000
by that perspective,

5
0:00:25.417,000 --> 0:00:28,000
which means we tell ourselves stories.

6
0:00:29.583,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Right? So here we are in this infinite data source.

7
0:00:33.375,000 --> 0:00:35,000
There's an infinite number of things that we could think about,

8
0:00:36.375,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but we edit and delete.

9
0:00:38.708,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We choose what to think about, what to pay attention to.

10
0:00:42.167,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We make up a story ...

11
0:00:47.333,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to make sense of what's going on,

12
0:00:50.125,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and we all get it wrong.

13
0:00:52.208,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Because we're all trying to navigate with our own skewed compasses,

14
0:00:55.458,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and we all have our own baggage,

15
0:00:57.083,000 --> 0:01:,000
but the stories themselves are utterly convincing.

16
0:01:00.292,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And we all do this,

17
0:01:01.625,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and a lot of the stories that we live by aren't even our own.

18
0:01:04.542,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The first ones we inherit at a young age from our parents,

19
0:01:07.292,000 --> 0:01:09,000
who of course have their own skewed beliefs,

20
0:01:09.417,000 --> 0:01:11,000
their own frustrations, their own unlived lives.

21
0:01:13.375,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And for better or worse, we take all that onboard,

22
0:01:15.724,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and then we go out into the world

23
0:01:17.339,000 --> 0:01:2,000
thinking maybe we have to be successful to be loved;

24
0:01:20.667,000 --> 0:01:23,000
or that we always have to put other people's needs first;

25
0:01:24.333,000 --> 0:01:28,000
or that we have some big terrible secret we couldn't possible tell people.

26
0:01:28.417,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And it's just fiction, it's just stories,

27
0:01:30.417,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and we'd worry a lot less about what other people think of us

28
0:01:33.333,000 --> 0:01:35,000
if we realized how seldom they do.

29
0:01:35.75,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:38.25,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So I feel that magic is a great analogy for how we edit reality and form a story

31
0:01:45.417,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and then mistake that story for the truth,

32
0:01:49.083,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and I've had a 20-year career in the UK

33
0:01:52.333,000 --> 0:01:56,000
staging big psychological experiments on TV,

34
0:01:56.708,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and now that's on Netflix.

35
0:01:58.375,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I also have a stage show.

36
0:02:00.292,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I've got my first Broadway show actually coming up, called "Secret."

37
0:02:04.083,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Just throwing that out there. No pressure.

38
0:02:06.11,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:07.125,000 --> 0:02:09,000
That should be this year.

40
0:02:09.333,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And I try to do something new with mentalism, mentalism,

41
0:02:14.208,000 --> 0:02:19,000
which is the dubious art of getting inside your head.

42
0:02:21.792,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So there was a heyday for this kind of stage mind-reading,

43
0:02:25.083,000 --> 0:02:26,000
which was the 1930s.

44
0:02:26.75,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That's why I'm dressed like this,

45
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:31,000
in my most un-TED-like garb.

46
0:02:32.292,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And there was an act, an act known as the Oracle Act.

47
0:02:35.625,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And in the Oracle Act, members of the audience,

48
0:02:37.875,000 --> 0:02:38,000
as I know you have done,

49
0:02:39.5,000 --> 0:02:4,000
would write down secret questions,

50
0:02:41.417,000 --> 0:02:43,000
the sort of questions you might ask a psychic,

51
0:02:44.083,000 --> 0:02:47,000
seal that question into an envelope,

52
0:02:47.208,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and on the outside of the envelope they would write their initials

53
0:02:50.375,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and then roughly where they sat in the audience.

54
0:02:55.417,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And then the Oracle, the mind reader, would take an envelope one at a time,

55
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:,000
he wouldn't open it,

56
0:03:00.333,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but he would attempt to divine what question was sealed inside.

57
0:03:04.292,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And if he got that right, he would try and answer the question

58
0:03:07.417,000 --> 0:03:08,000
for the person too.

59
0:03:08.875,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And the act spread like wildfire.

60
0:03:11.333,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's a testament, I think, to the seductive appeal

61
0:03:14.958,000 --> 0:03:17,000
of some powerful figure offering you easy, simple answers

62
0:03:18.792,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to life's complex and subtle questions

63
0:03:21.292,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and anxieties.

64
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So thank you all of you that wrote questions.

65
0:03:25.167,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I haven't seen these. I know somebody's guarding them.

66
0:03:27.75,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Thank you so much.

67
0:03:29.083,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I will take those now. Thank you all of you that did this.

68
0:03:31.833,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I should say, probably, a couple of things before I start.

69
0:03:37.75,000 --> 0:03:38,000
In absolute honesty,

70
0:03:40.042,000 --> 0:03:42,000
first of all I can't see through these envelopes.

71
0:03:42.375,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They are sealed. They are thick black envelopes.

72
0:03:44.667,000 --> 0:03:46,000
You'll know if you wrote one. I can't see through them.

73
0:03:47.292,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Secondly, importantly, I don't know any of you

74
0:03:49.792,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and nobody is playing along.

75
0:03:51.833,000 --> 0:03:52,000
That's not what this is.

76
0:03:54.542,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Thirdly ...

77
0:03:57.542,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I don't believe for a second that I have any special psychological gifts,

78
0:04:02.333,000 --> 0:04:04,000
let alone any psychic ones.

79
0:04:05.75,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So let's begin.

80
0:04:12.542,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Nope.

81
0:04:13.833,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:20.375,000 --> 0:04:21,000
OK, this --

83
0:04:21.667,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Oh, nice.

84
0:04:23.333,000 --> 0:04:25,000
OK, this one's interesting. There's a couple here.

85
0:04:25.75,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I will start with maybe this one.

86
0:04:27.583,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This one's interesting, because the writing undulates.

87
0:04:30.583,000 --> 0:04:31,000
There's a sort of an up and down thing,

88
0:04:32.5,000 --> 0:04:34,000
which normally -- not always -- normally means

89
0:04:34.708,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that the person doesn't know the answer to the question themselves,

90
0:04:37.917,000 --> 0:04:39,000
so it's normally a question about the future, right?

91
0:04:40.417,000 --> 0:04:41,000
That sort of suggests uncertainty.

92
0:04:42.083,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So I would say it's a lady,

93
0:04:44.417,000 --> 0:04:47,000
age-wise it's a little difficult to tell from this minimal handwriting,

94
0:04:47.833,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but I would expect maybe 30s, maybe 40s, but let's find out.

95
0:04:51.625,000 --> 0:04:53,000
It says -- and a question about the future --

96
0:04:53.738,000 --> 0:04:56,000
it says, "JN, center."

97
0:04:57.208,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So it's going to be somebody in this big central section here.

98
0:05:00.167,000 --> 0:05:02,000
If you think this is you, if you wrote one,

99
0:05:02.25,000 --> 0:05:03,000
could you make a fuss?

100
0:05:03.542,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's a bit difficult for me to see in the center.

101
0:05:05.875,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Hi, give us a wave.

102
0:05:07.167,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So J ...

103
0:05:08.5,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Jane? Jessica?

104
0:05:10.042,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Jessica: Yes.

105
0:05:11.333,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Derren Brown: Which one? Jessica: Jessica.

106
0:05:13.322,000 --> 0:05:16,000
DB: Thank you. Just a guess. Little murmur of approval, thank you?

107
0:05:16.458,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:18.083,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I'll take it.

109
0:05:20.583,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Alright, so Jessica, I won't ask your age,

110
0:05:22.583,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but is it a question essentially about the future?

111
0:05:24.958,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Jessica: Mhm? DB: Yes?

112
0:05:26.25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Jessica: Yes. DB: Yes. OK.

113
0:05:27.542,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Alright. So what did we ask? What did Jessica ask about the future?

114
0:05:32.542,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So am I OK with late-30s, early-40s?

115
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Jessica: I'll take it. I'm taking it.

116
0:05:38.833,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:42.708,000 --> 0:05:43,000
DB: OK, so it's important,

118
0:05:44.042,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because we ask different questions depending how old we are.

119
0:05:46.917,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Just say, "I'll take it" again.

120
0:05:48.958,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Jessica: I'll take it.

121
0:05:50.75,000 --> 0:05:53,000
DB: Virginia? You're from Virginia? Jessica: Yes, I am.

122
0:05:53.833,000 --> 0:05:54,000
DB: Yeah. So --

123
0:05:55.542,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:56.833,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I think this is a lady,

125
0:05:58.583,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I think this is a lady who wants to leave Virginia.

126
0:06:03.958,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I think you're looking at plans,

127
0:06:06.542,000 --> 0:06:09,000
it's whether or not things are going to come together to get out.

128
0:06:09.625,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Just show me your hands.

129
0:06:12.042,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Other sides so I can see fingernails?

130
0:06:16.125,000 --> 0:06:18,000
OK, I think you have a farm

131
0:06:19.083,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and it's whether or not you're going to sell your farm and get out of Virginia?

132
0:06:22.833,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Is this right?

133
0:06:24.125,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Jessica: Absolutely, that's the question.

134
0:06:26.125,000 --> 0:06:28,000
DB: Alright. Great. Thank you. It's a great question!

135
0:06:28.875,000 --> 0:06:3,000
What was the actual question? What did you put?

136
0:06:31.833,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Jessica: "Will I sell the farm in Virginia?"

137
0:06:33.958,000 --> 0:06:34,000
DB: Will you sell the farm?

138
0:06:35.292,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Alright, so look, it's a great question if you are pretending to be psychic,

139
0:06:38.917,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because it's about the future,

140
0:06:40.417,000 --> 0:06:42,000
which means I can give you a yes or no on this.

141
0:06:42.667,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It means nothing. You have no way of verifying it.

142
0:06:46.458,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And a dangerous thing to do --

143
0:06:47.958,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and if I say yes or no, it'll just stick in the back of your mind,

144
0:06:51.082,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and it can't not start to affect decisions you make.

145
0:06:53.542,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So a dangerous thing to do. However --

146
0:06:55.417,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Laughter)

147
0:06:57.792,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Yes, I think you will sell the farm,

148
0:07:01.5,000 --> 0:07:02,000
because I think you're the sort of person

149
0:07:03.5,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that in the nicest way will get what you want.

150
0:07:05.708,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I think when there are things you want, you tend to focus on them

151
0:07:10.083,000 --> 0:07:11,000
at the expense of other things

152
0:07:11.583,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that you know you probably should be focusing on more,

153
0:07:14.167,000 --> 0:07:15,000
would you agree?

154
0:07:16.708,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Educated, you spent a few years in --

155
0:07:20.042,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Say yes again, the word "yes" quickly? Jessica: Yes.

156
0:07:22.542,000 --> 0:07:23,000
DB: No? Jessica: No.

157
0:07:24.333,000 --> 0:07:26,000
DB: California? Berkeley? A bit of a guess, but ...

158
0:07:26.75,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Jessica: I went to Berkeley, yes. Stop doing this!

159
0:07:29.667,000 --> 0:07:3,000
DB: So it's a yes.

160
0:07:31.333,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Oh, and you've been to India recently as well.

161
0:07:33.542,000 --> 0:07:36,000
There's just a tiny, tiny little thing going on there. Yes? No?

162
0:07:36.875,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Jessica: Yes, I just got back from India.

163
0:07:38.875,000 --> 0:07:41,000
DB: It's a yes from me, I just don't want to say it like it's written in the stars

164
0:07:42.792,000 --> 0:07:45,000
because it isn't, and you need to take responsibility for it.

165
0:07:45.833,000 --> 0:07:47,000
DB: Have a seat. Thank you. Let's do another one.

166
0:07:48.167,000 --> 0:07:51,000
(Applause)

167
0:07:53.625,000 --> 0:07:56,000
AH, also in the center? AH.

168
0:07:56.958,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This will be a man, a little older, maybe late 40s, I would say from this.

169
0:08:00.625,000 --> 0:08:02,000
AH, center, stand up for me if you think this is you.

170
0:08:04.375,000 --> 0:08:06,000
AH. Hi, let's get a microphone to this guy.

171
0:08:06.583,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Quick as we can, on camera would be amazing.

172
0:08:09.125,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Oh, look at that! Freeze. Don't move. Don't move.

173
0:08:11.708,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Keep absolutely still.

174
0:08:13.417,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Are you standing? Where are you?

175
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Man: I am standing. I'm not that short.

176
0:08:16.917,000 --> 0:08:17,000
DB: OK.

177
0:08:19.375,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Alright, now you changed that.

178
0:08:21.708,000 --> 0:08:23,000
There was just something you did as you got up.

179
0:08:23.958,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Yes or no, have you put something on here --

180
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
you're not doing it now, but you did it as you stood up --

181
0:08:29.75,000 --> 0:08:33,000
to do with your left or your left leg or your left foot, yes or no?

182
0:08:34.292,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Man: Yes.

183
0:08:35.583,000 --> 0:08:38,000
DB: Alright. He was giving us a nice clear signal as he stood up.

184
0:08:38.792,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Put your weight on your left-hand side and say "yes."

185
0:08:41.333,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Man: Yes.

186
0:08:42.625,000 --> 0:08:45,000
DB: Take your hand out of that pocket, put your weight on the other side,

187
0:08:46.125,000 --> 0:08:48,000
change hands with the mic and say "yes" again.

188
0:08:48.317,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Man: Yes.

189
0:08:49.5,000 --> 0:08:53,000
DB: You have a dislocation

190
0:08:55.707,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in the big toe on your left-hand side?

191
0:08:58.375,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Man: Yes.

192
0:08:59.667,000 --> 0:09:02,000
DB: Thank you so much. Great. Good one! Take a seat. Take a seat.

193
0:09:02.792,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Can I get the microphone? I'm going to change microphone for this.

194
0:09:05.958,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Can I grab a mic up? Thank you.

195
0:09:08.625,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Thank you so much. That would be great there.

196
0:09:10.792,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I'm going to change mic because,

197
0:09:14.208,000 --> 0:09:15,000
hopefully you can now still hear me?

198
0:09:17.208,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So I'm going to blindfold myself.

199
0:09:21.625,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And I'm doing this now so I don't have the clues as you stand up.

200
0:09:26.542,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I can't see where you put your hands.

201
0:09:28.375,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I can't see how you respond to what I'm saying.

202
0:09:30.625,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I can't see what the people next to you are doing either.

203
0:09:33.333,000 --> 0:09:36,000
If they know the answers to the question, that's always very helpful.

204
0:09:36.625,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I won't have those advantages,

205
0:09:38.125,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but strangely,

206
0:09:42.292,000 --> 0:09:44,000
this frees me up,

207
0:09:44.333,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and I want this to free you up as well,

208
0:09:46.25,000 --> 0:09:47,000
so if you didn't write a question

209
0:09:47.875,000 --> 0:09:49,000
but you wish that you had done,

210
0:09:50.667,000 --> 0:09:51,000
you can still take part.

211
0:09:51.958,000 --> 0:09:54,000
The point of writing the question is only that it just kind of gets

212
0:09:55.167,000 --> 0:09:57,000
a nice, clear, succinct wording in your head.

213
0:09:57.917,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So if you can just find a question in your head,

214
0:10:00.625,000 --> 0:10:02,000
make it clear and succinct, just send it to me,

215
0:10:02.853,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and I'll try and do this now without anything written down.

216
0:10:05.667,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So just start to form questions but send me your name as well.

217
0:10:08.625,000 --> 0:10:1,000
"My name is," whatever that last guy was,

218
0:10:10.708,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and "what's strange about my feet," or whatever the question was.

219
0:10:14.542,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So name and question.

220
0:10:16.792,000 --> 0:10:19,000
There is somebody already, I'm guessing you're quite near the front,

221
0:10:20.042,000 --> 0:10:23,000
because your name is quite clear.

222
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Feels like you're in the center at the front.

223
0:10:26.167,000 --> 0:10:27,000
OK, let me just ... Allan?

224
0:10:27.833,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Feels like there's an Allan.

225
0:10:29.25,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And you're going to be quite near the front, vaguely central, I think.

226
0:10:32.583,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Feels like it's coming from right there.

227
0:10:34.542,000 --> 0:10:36,000
There's like a man, maybe early 60s, something like that.

228
0:10:37.292,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Allan: Yes.

229
0:10:38.583,000 --> 0:10:39,000
DB: You've got a mic? Great, thank you.

230
0:10:40.5,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Allan, just say "stop" when I get to you so that I know where you are,

231
0:10:44.542,000 --> 0:10:45,000
where to face.

232
0:10:47.417,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Allan: Stop.

233
0:10:49.292,000 --> 0:10:51,000
DB: You a Capricorn? Allan: Yes.

234
0:10:53.458,000 --> 0:10:56,000
DB: So Allan has something in his head.

235
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
Now, did you hear it, hear the reserve in his voice?

236
0:11:00.5,000 --> 0:11:01,000
It's going to be something really tricky.

237
0:11:02.5,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I think with you ... Just say "yes" again for me?

238
0:11:04.833,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Allan: Yes.

239
0:11:08.042,000 --> 0:11:09,000
DB: It's going to be either --

240
0:11:09.5,000 --> 0:11:1,000
no it's not.

241
0:11:10.792,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It's access, it's a password or access to something.

242
0:11:15.292,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Have you got something, just yes or no, with a password in your head?

243
0:11:18.583,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Allan: Yes.

244
0:11:19.875,000 --> 0:11:21,000
DB: A computer password, that sort of thing?

245
0:11:22,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Allan: Yes.

246
0:11:23.292,000 --> 0:11:24,000
DB: Excellent!

247
0:11:24.583,000 --> 0:11:25,000
(Laughter)

248
0:11:26.292,000 --> 0:11:28,000
In that case, I'm going to finish on this one. Let me ---

249
0:11:29.125,000 --> 0:11:3,000
If I get this right,

250
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:34,000
they're all going to know what it is, and millions of people potentially.

251
0:11:34.458,000 --> 0:11:35,000
You will change it, won't you?

252
0:11:35.958,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Allan: Of course.

253
0:11:37.292,000 --> 0:11:39,000
(Laughter)

254
0:11:40.958,000 --> 0:11:42,000
DB: Just say "of course" again? Allan: Of course.

255
0:11:43.458,000 --> 0:11:46,000
DB: Alright. If it's a word -- I imagine it's a word, right --

256
0:11:46.583,000 --> 0:11:48,000
just see the password written in front of you,

257
0:11:48.792,000 --> 0:11:49,000
big clear block capital letters,

258
0:11:50.708,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and as you look at it, think for me of a letter somewhere in the middle,

259
0:11:54.833,000 --> 0:11:55,000
don't say it out loud,

260
0:11:56.375,000 --> 0:11:58,000
just get a letter in your head that's in the middle.

261
0:11:58.875,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Have you got one? Allan: Yeah.

262
0:12:00.333,000 --> 0:12:01,000
DB: OK, stick with that for me.

263
0:12:02.875,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Ah, you changed it, OK.

264
0:12:05.292,000 --> 0:12:06,000
You changed your mind there.

265
0:12:06.708,000 --> 0:12:07,000
I think you settled on a --

266
0:12:08.833,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I think that's a "B", yes?

267
0:12:11.125,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Allan: No.

268
0:12:13.625,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I didn't.

269
0:12:14.917,000 --> 0:12:15,000
DB: Then it's an "I"? Allan: Correct.

270
0:12:16.625,000 --> 0:12:17,000
DB: But you had a B. Allan: Yes.

271
0:12:18.333,000 --> 0:12:2,000
DB: Yeah, he changed his mind. He changed his mind.

272
0:12:20.792,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Laughter)

273
0:12:22.125,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So see it written there.

274
0:12:25.083,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Just keep saying it to yourself in your head.

275
0:12:27.917,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Oh, you play drums, don't you.

276
0:12:30.167,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Allan: I do.

277
0:12:31.458,000 --> 0:12:33,000
DB: Just get that out of your head, get that out of your head,

278
0:12:34.417,000 --> 0:12:35,000
just focus on this one thing for me.

279
0:12:36.208,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Laughter)

280
0:12:38.417,000 --> 0:12:39,000
My job is to sell you a story, right?

281
0:12:40.25,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I try and do this to all of you, to get you to pay attention

282
0:12:43.125,000 --> 0:12:45,000
to one thing that I want you to find important,

283
0:12:46.125,000 --> 0:12:48,000
ignore other things that I want you to ignore,

284
0:12:48.333,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and then join up those narrative dots

285
0:12:50.167,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to tell yourself a certain story about what I'm doing,

286
0:12:52.75,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and this only works because we are story-forming creatures,

287
0:12:55.708,000 --> 0:12:56,000
which means we do this every day.

288
0:12:57.333,000 --> 0:12:59,000
We go out into this complex and subtle world

289
0:13:00.125,000 --> 0:13:02,000
full of a complex and subtle people like you and me, Allan,

290
0:13:02.958,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and we reduce them to these neat characters

291
0:13:07.083,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that fit whatever story we're telling ourselves,

292
0:13:09.375,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and we say, "She's insecure," "He's arrogant," "They can't be trusted."

293
0:13:12.958,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And these are just stories like the story that I can somehow read your mind.

294
0:13:19.5,000 --> 0:13:22,000
You're thinking of selling your company as well, aren't you, at the moment.

295
0:13:23.083,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Allan: Correct.

296
0:13:24.375,000 --> 0:13:26,000
DB: Which is something to do with skin?

297
0:13:27.042,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Allan: Yes.

298
0:13:28.333,000 --> 0:13:29,000
DB: Skin care or something like this.

299
0:13:30.167,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Allan: Uh, yes.

300
0:13:31.458,000 --> 0:13:33,000
DB: And I think the reason why I love doing this

301
0:13:33.75,000 --> 0:13:36,000
is that it reminds me at least to try and be more alive and alert

302
0:13:36.833,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to the complexity and the subtlety of what's real,

303
0:13:39.208,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that there's always other stuff going on that we don't know about,

304
0:13:42.375,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and it means we can get less stuck, we can be kinder to people

305
0:13:45.333,000 --> 0:13:48,000
because we can recognize there's always fear behind their stress,

306
0:13:48.458,000 --> 0:13:5,000
so we don't need to meet it as defensively,

307
0:13:50.542,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and we can start to see the stories for what they are

308
0:13:53.083,000 --> 0:13:56,000

2
0:00:15.963,000 --> 0:00:17,000
This is how war starts.

3
0:00:18.775,000 --> 0:00:21,000
One day you're living your ordinary life,

4
0:00:22.041,000 --> 0:00:24,000
you're planning to go to a party,

5
0:00:24.557,000 --> 0:00:26,000
you're taking your children to school,

6
0:00:26.941,000 --> 0:00:28,000
you're making a dentist appointment.

7
0:00:29.654,000 --> 0:00:32,000
The next thing, the telephones go out,

8
0:00:33.28,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the TVs go out, there's armed men on the street,

9
0:00:37.217,000 --> 0:00:39,000
there's roadblocks.

10
0:00:39.533,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation.

11
0:00:44.01,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It stops.

12
0:00:46.215,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I'm going to steal a story from a friend of mine,

13
0:00:48.773,000 --> 0:00:5,000
a Bosnian friend, about what happened to her,

14
0:00:51.751,000 --> 0:00:55,000
because I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like.

15
0:00:56.128,000 --> 0:01:,000
She was walking to work one day in April, 1992,

16
0:01:00.222,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in a miniskirt and high heels. She worked in a bank.

17
0:01:03.37,000 --> 0:01:06,000
She was a young mother. She was someone who liked to party.

18
0:01:06.894,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Great person.

19
0:01:08.728,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And suddenly she sees a tank

20
0:01:12.035,000 --> 0:01:15,000
ambling down the main road of Sarajevo

21
0:01:15.241,000 --> 0:01:18,000
knocking everything out of its path.

22
0:01:18.793,000 --> 0:01:22,000
She thinks she's dreaming, but she's not.

23
0:01:22.824,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And she runs as any of us would have done

24
0:01:25.569,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and takes cover, and she hides behind a trash bin,

25
0:01:29.586,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in her high heels and her miniskirt.

26
0:01:32.185,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And as she's hiding there, she's feeling ridiculous,

27
0:01:36.404,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but she's seeing this tank go by with soldiers

28
0:01:39.1,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and people all over the place and chaos

29
0:01:41.46,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and she thinks, "I feel like Alice in Wonderland

30
0:01:46.087,000 --> 0:01:48,000
going down the rabbit hole,

31
0:01:48.422,000 --> 0:01:51,000
down, down, down into chaos,

32
0:01:51.49,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and my life will never be the same again."

33
0:01:56.891,000 --> 0:01:59,000
A few weeks later, my friend was in a crowd of people

34
0:02:00.678,000 --> 0:02:04,000
pushing with her infant son in her arms

35
0:02:05.628,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to give him to a stranger on a bus,

36
0:02:08.164,000 --> 0:02:11,000
which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo

37
0:02:11.188,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to take children out so they could be safe.

38
0:02:14.353,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And she remembers struggling with her mother to the front,

39
0:02:18.463,000 --> 0:02:21,000
crowds and crowds of people, "Take my child! Take my child!"

40
0:02:21.889,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and passing her son to someone through a window.

41
0:02:27.942,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And she didn't see him for years.

42
0:02:30.81,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The siege went on for three and a half years,

43
0:02:34.529,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and it was a siege without water,

44
0:02:36.818,000 --> 0:02:41,000
without power, without electricity, without heat, without food,

45
0:02:42.107,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in the middle of Europe, in the middle of the 20th century.

46
0:02:47.462,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I had the honor of being one of those reporters

47
0:02:51.264,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that lived through that siege,

48
0:02:53.683,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there

49
0:02:56.721,000 --> 0:02:58,000
because it's taught me everything,

50
0:02:58.911,000 --> 0:03:02,000
not just about being a reporter, but about being a human being.

51
0:03:03.04,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I learned about compassion.

52
0:03:05.395,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I learned about ordinary people who could be heroes.

53
0:03:09.206,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I learned about sharing. I learned about camaraderie.

54
0:03:13.577,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Most of all, I learned about love.

55
0:03:16.488,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos,

56
0:03:21.767,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors,

57
0:03:24.903,000 --> 0:03:26,000
share food, raise their children,

58
0:03:27.547,000 --> 0:03:3,000
drag someone who's being sniped at from the middle of the road

59
0:03:30.799,000 --> 0:03:32,000
even though you yourself were endangering your life,

60
0:03:33.656,000 --> 0:03:36,000
helping people get into taxis who were injured

61
0:03:36.907,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to try to take them to hospitals.

62
0:03:39.528,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I learned so much about myself.

63
0:03:42.747,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Martha Gellhorn, who's one of my heroes, once said,

64
0:03:45.772,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"You can only love one war. The rest is responsibility."

65
0:03:50.97,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I went on to cover many, many, many wars after that,

66
0:03:54.506,000 --> 0:03:56,000
so many that I lost count,

67
0:03:57.135,000 --> 0:04:,000
but there was nothing like Sarajevo.

68
0:04:00.218,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Last April, I went back to a very strange --

69
0:04:04.173,000 --> 0:04:07,000
what I called a deranged high school reunion.

70
0:04:07.947,000 --> 0:04:11,000
What it was, was the 20th anniversary of the siege,

71
0:04:12.29,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo,

72
0:04:14.762,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and I don't like the word "anniversary," because it sounds like a party,

73
0:04:19.202,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and this was not a party.

74
0:04:20.605,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It was a very somber gathering of the reporters

75
0:04:24.593,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that worked there during the war, humanitarian aid workers,

76
0:04:27.984,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves.

77
0:04:32.453,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And the thing that struck me the most,

78
0:04:34.872,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that broke my heart,

79
0:04:36.613,000 --> 0:04:38,000
was walking down the main street of Sarajevo,

80
0:04:38.783,000 --> 0:04:42,000
where my friend Aida saw the tank coming 20 years ago,

81
0:04:42.858,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs,

82
0:04:49.555,000 --> 0:04:5,000
empty,

83
0:04:51.181,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and every single one of them symbolized

84
0:04:53.45,000 --> 0:04:56,000
a person who had died during the siege,

85
0:04:57.167,000 --> 0:05:01,000
just in Sarajevo, not in all of Bosnia,

86
0:05:01.454,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and it stretched from one end of the city

87
0:05:04.041,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to a large part of it,

88
0:05:06.315,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs

89
0:05:09.818,000 --> 0:05:11,000
for the children.

90
0:05:12.674,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I now cover Syria,

91
0:05:15.801,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and I started reporting it because I believed that

92
0:05:18.991,000 --> 0:05:2,000
it needs to be done.

93
0:05:21.247,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I believe a story there has to be told.

94
0:05:24.252,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I see, again, a template of the war in Bosnia.

95
0:05:28.222,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And when I first arrived in Damascus,

96
0:05:30.451,000 --> 0:05:32,000
I saw this strange moment where people

97
0:05:32.853,000 --> 0:05:35,000
didn't seem to believe that war was going to descend,

98
0:05:36.413,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and it was exactly the same in Bosnia

99
0:05:38.348,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and nearly every other country I've seen where war comes.

100
0:05:41.162,000 --> 0:05:43,000
People don't want to believe it's coming,

101
0:05:43.705,000 --> 0:05:46,000
so they don't leave, they don't leave before they can.

102
0:05:47.172,000 --> 0:05:48,000
They don't get their money out.

103
0:05:48.842,000 --> 0:05:51,000
They stay because you want to stay in your home.

104
0:05:52.737,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And then war and chaos descend.

105
0:05:56.776,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot.

106
0:06:00.579,000 --> 0:06:06,000
In 1994, I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda.

107
0:06:06.733,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Between April and August, 1994,

108
0:06:11.582,000 --> 0:06:15,000
one million people were slaughtered.

109
0:06:15.783,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out

110
0:06:21.01,000 --> 0:06:23,000
with the sheer number,

111
0:06:23.082,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I want you just for a second to think of a million people.

112
0:06:26.713,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And to give you some example, I remember

113
0:06:29.25,000 --> 0:06:34,000
standing and looking down a road as far as I could see,

114
0:06:34.331,000 --> 0:06:4,000
at least a mile, and there were bodies piled twice my height

115
0:06:40.42,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of the dead.

116
0:06:42.144,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And that was just a small percentage of the dead.

117
0:06:45.479,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And there were mothers holding their children

118
0:06:47.448,000 --> 0:06:5,000
who had been caught in their last death throes.

119
0:06:50.789,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So we learn a lot from war,

120
0:06:54.119,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and I mention Rwanda

121
0:06:56.471,000 --> 0:07:,000
because it is one place, like South Africa,

122
0:07:00.589,000 --> 0:07:03,000
where nearly 20 years on, there is healing.

123
0:07:04.571,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Fifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women,

124
0:07:08.039,000 --> 0:07:1,000
which is fantastic,

125
0:07:10.491,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and there's also within the national constitution now,

126
0:07:14.517,000 --> 0:07:17,000
you're actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi.

127
0:07:17.69,000 --> 0:07:2,000
You're not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity,

128
0:07:21.559,000 --> 0:07:25,000
which is, of course, what started the slaughter in the first place.

129
0:07:26.105,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story,

130
0:07:29.212,000 --> 0:07:3,000
or I find it beautiful.

131
0:07:30.695,000 --> 0:07:34,000
There was a group of children, mixed Hutus and Tutsis,

132
0:07:35.612,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and a group of women who were adopting them,

133
0:07:38.326,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and they lined up and one was just given to the next.

134
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
There was no kind of compensation for, you're a Tutsi,

135
0:07:45.426,000 --> 0:07:47,000
you're a Hutu, you might have killed my mother,

136
0:07:48.341,000 --> 0:07:49,000
you might have killed my father.

137
0:07:50.187,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation,

138
0:07:55.493,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and I find this remarkable.

139
0:07:59.077,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So when people ask me how I continue to cover war,

140
0:08:01.919,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and why I continue to do it,

141
0:08:04.131,000 --> 0:08:05,000
this is why.

142
0:08:05.6,000 --> 0:08:08,000
When I go back to Syria, next week in fact,

143
0:08:08.991,000 --> 0:08:11,000
what I see is incredibly heroic people,

144
0:08:12.952,000 --> 0:08:14,000
some of them fighting for democracy,

145
0:08:15.225,000 --> 0:08:19,000
for things we take for granted every single day.

146
0:08:19.242,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And that's pretty much why I do it.

147
0:08:22.48,000 --> 0:08:26,000
In 2004, I had a little baby boy,

148
0:08:26.948,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and I call him my miracle child,

149
0:08:30.143,000 --> 0:08:33,000
because after seeing so much death

150
0:08:33.189,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life,

151
0:08:37.366,000 --> 0:08:4,000
this ray of hope was born.

152
0:08:41.225,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And I called him Luca, which means "The bringer of light,"

153
0:08:45.422,000 --> 0:08:49,000
because he does bring light to my life.

154
0:08:50.345,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But I'm talking about him because when he was four months old,

155
0:08:53.796,000 --> 0:08:57,000
my foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad

156
0:08:58.468,000 --> 0:09:01,000
where I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime

157
0:09:01.8,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards,

158
0:09:04.679,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and I remember getting on the plane in tears,

159
0:09:07.773,000 --> 0:09:09,000
crying to be separated from my son,

160
0:09:10.759,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and while I was there,

161
0:09:12.992,000 --> 0:09:14,000
a quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine

162
0:09:15.727,000 --> 0:09:17,000
said to me, "What are you doing here?

163
0:09:18.201,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Why aren't you home with Luca?"

164
0:09:20.042,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And I said, "Well, I have to see." It was 2004

165
0:09:23.827,000 --> 0:09:27,000
which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq,

166
0:09:28.214,000 --> 0:09:31,000
"I have to see, I have to see what is happening here.

167
0:09:31.454,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I have to report it."

168
0:09:32.319,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And he said, "Go home,

169
0:09:35.883,000 --> 0:09:38,000
because if you miss his first tooth,

170
0:09:39.169,000 --> 0:09:41,000
if you miss his first step, you'll never forgive yourself.

171
0:09:42.167,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But there will always be another war."

172
0:09:46.03,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And there, sadly, will always be wars.

173
0:09:50.371,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And I am deluding myself if I think, as a journalist,

174
0:09:54.225,000 --> 0:09:55,000
as a reporter, as a writer,

175
0:09:55.991,000 --> 0:09:59,000
what I do can stop them. I can't.

176
0:10:00.829,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I'm not Kofi Annan. He can't stop a war.

177
0:10:03.376,000 --> 0:10:05,000
He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn't do it.

178
0:10:06.353,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I'm not a U.N. conflict resolution person.

179
0:10:10.349,000 --> 0:10:12,000
I'm not even a humanitarian aid doctor,

180
0:10:12.632,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and I can't tell you the times of how helpless I've felt

181
0:10:15.458,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to have people dying in front of me, and I couldn't save them.

182
0:10:18.729,000 --> 0:10:21,000
All I am is a witness.

183
0:10:22.564,000 --> 0:10:27,000
My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless.

184
0:10:27.618,000 --> 0:10:3,000
A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light

185
0:10:30.851,000 --> 0:10:32,000
in the darkest corners of the world.

186
0:10:33.613,000 --> 0:10:35,000
And that's what I try to do.

187
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I'm not always successful,

188
0:10:39.296,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and sometimes it's incredibly frustrating,

189
0:10:41.837,000 --> 0:10:43,000
because you feel like you're writing into a void,

190
0:10:44.043,000 --> 0:10:46,000
or you feel like no one cares.

191
0:10:46.372,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Who cares about Syria? Who cares about Bosnia?

192
0:10:48.621,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Who cares about the Congo,

193
0:10:50.634,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the Ivory Coast, Liberia, Sierra Leone,

194
0:10:52.908,000 --> 0:10:54,000
all of these strings of places that

195
0:10:55.023,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I will remember for the rest of my life?

196
0:10:58.996,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But my métier is to bear witness

197
0:11:02.249,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and that is the crux, the heart of the matter,

198
0:11:05.431,000 --> 0:11:07,000
for us reporters who do this.

199
0:11:07.972,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And all I can really do is hope,

200
0:11:11.563,000 --> 0:11:13,000
not to policymakers or politicians,

201
0:11:14.171,000 --> 0:11:16,000
because as much as I'd like to have faith

202
0:11:16.568,000 --> 0:11:18,000
that they read my words and do something,

203
0:11:19.033,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I don't delude myself.

204
0:11:22.193,000 --> 0:11:26,000
But what I do hope is that if you remember anything I said

205
0:11:26.41,000 --> 0:11:29,000
or any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast,

206
0:11:29.963,000 --> 0:11:31,000
if you can remember the story of Sarajevo,

207
0:11:32.645,000 --> 0:11:35,000
or the story of Rwanda,

208
0:11:36.136,000 --> 0:11:38,000
then I've done my job.

209
0:11:38.709,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Thank you very much.

210
0:11:40.747,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.776,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm used to thinking of the TED audience

2
0:00:17.767,000 --> 0:00:19,000
as a wonderful collection of some of the most effective,

3
0:00:20.475,000 --> 0:00:22,000
intelligent, intellectual, savvy,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
worldly and innovative people in the world.

5
0:00:25.378,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And I think that's true.

6
0:00:26.919,000 --> 0:00:3,000
However, I also have reason to believe that many, if not most, of you

7
0:00:31.703,000 --> 0:00:33,000
are actually tying your shoes incorrectly.

8
0:00:34.156,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Now I know that seems ludicrous.

10
0:00:38.216,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I know that seems ludicrous.

11
0:00:39.703,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And believe me, I lived the same sad life until about three years ago.

12
0:00:43.82,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And what happened to me

13
0:00:45.431,000 --> 0:00:48,000
was I bought, what was for me, a very expensive pair of shoes.

14
0:00:48.859,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But those shoes came with round nylon laces,

15
0:00:51.799,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I couldn't keep them tied.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So I went back to the store and said to the owner,

17
0:00:55.64,000 --> 0:00:57,000
"I love the shoes, but I hate the laces."

18
0:00:57.878,000 --> 0:00:59,000
He took a look and said, "Oh, you're tying them wrong."

19
0:01:01.229,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now up until that moment,

20
0:01:02.841,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I would have thought that, by age 50,

21
0:01:05.523,000 --> 0:01:08,000
one of the life skills that I had really nailed

22
0:01:08.654,000 --> 0:01:09,000
was tying my shoes.

23
0:01:09.893,000 --> 0:01:1,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:10.918,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But not so -- let me demonstrate.

25
0:01:15.132,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This is the way

26
0:01:17.149,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that most of us were taught to tie our shoes.

27
0:01:22.917,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Now as it turns out -- thank you.

28
0:01:24.8,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Applause)

29
0:01:25.949,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Wait, there's more.

30
0:01:27.733,000 --> 0:01:28,000
As it turns out --

31
0:01:29.235,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
there's a strong form and a weak form of this knot,

33
0:01:33.372,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and we were taught the weak form.

34
0:01:34.981,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And here's how to tell.

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
If you pull the strands at the base of the knot,

36
0:01:38.975,000 --> 0:01:4,000
you will see that the bow will orient itself

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
down the long axis of the shoe.

38
0:01:43.669,000 --> 0:01:44,000
That's the weak form of the knot.

39
0:01:45.542,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But not to worry.

40
0:01:47.732,000 --> 0:01:48,000
If we start over

41
0:01:49.748,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and simply go the other direction around the bow,

42
0:01:54.206,000 --> 0:01:56,000
we get this, the strong form of the knot.

43
0:01:57.214,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And if you pull the cords under the knot,

44
0:01:59.379,000 --> 0:02:01,000
you will see that the bow orients itself

45
0:02:02.125,000 --> 0:02:04,000
along the transverse axis of the shoe.

46
0:02:04.633,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This is a stronger knot.

47
0:02:06.228,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It will come untied less often.

48
0:02:08.244,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It will let you down less, and not only that, it looks better.

49
0:02:12.848,000 --> 0:02:13,000
We're going to do this one more time.

50
0:02:14.697,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Applause)

51
0:02:18.119,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Start as usual --

52
0:02:19.436,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Applause)

53
0:02:21.73,000 --> 0:02:22,000
go the other way around the loop.

54
0:02:23.651,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is a little hard for children,

55
0:02:25.402,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but I think you can handle it.

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Pull the knot.

57
0:02:31.404,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There it is: the strong form of the shoe knot.

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now, in keeping with today's theme,

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I'd like to point out -- something you already know --

60
0:02:40.815,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that sometimes a small advantage someplace in life

61
0:02:44.671,000 --> 0:02:46,000
can yield tremendous results someplace else.

62
0:02:47.488,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

63
0:02:48.587,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Live long and prosper.

64
0:02:50.017,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Applause)

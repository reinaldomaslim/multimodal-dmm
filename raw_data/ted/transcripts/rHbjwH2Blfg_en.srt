1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Everyone's familiar with cancer,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but we don't normally think of cancer

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
as being a contagious disease.

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The Tasmanian devil has shown us

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that, not only can cancer be a contagious disease,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but it can also threaten

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
an entire species with extinction.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So first of all, what is a Tasmanian devil?

9
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Many of you might be familiar with Taz, the cartoon character,

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the one that spins around and around and around.

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But not many people know

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that there actually is a real animal called the Tasmanian devil,

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and it's the world's largest carnivorous marsupial.

14
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
A marsupial is a mammal with a pouch

15
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
like a kangaroo.

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
The Tasmanian devil got its name

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
from the terrifying nocturnal scream that it makes.

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Screaming)

19
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The Tasmanian devil is predominantly a scavenger,

21
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and it uses its powerful jaws

22
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and its sharp teeth

23
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to chomp on the bones of rotting dead animals.

24
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
[The] Tasmanian devil is found only on the island of Tasmania,

25
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
which is that small island

26
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
just to the south of the mainland of Australia.

27
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And despite their ferocious appearance,

28
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Tasmanian devils are actually

29
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
quite adorable little animals.

30
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
In fact, growing up in Tasmania,

31
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
it always was incredibly exciting

32
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when we got a chance to see

33
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
a Tasmanian devil in the wild.

34
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
But the Tasmanian devil population

35
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
has been undergoing a really extremely fast decline.

36
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And in fact, there's concern

37
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that the species could go extinct in the wild

38
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
within 20 to 30 years.

39
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And the reason for that

40
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
is the emergence of a new disease,

41
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
a contagious cancer.

42
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The story begins in 1996

43
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
when a wildlife photographer took this photograph here

44
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
of a Tasmanian devil

45
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
with a large tumor on its face.

46
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
At the time, this was thought to be a one-off.

47
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Animals, just like humans,

48
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
sometimes get strange tumors.

49
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
However, we now believe

50
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that this is the first sighting of a new disease,

51
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
which is now an epidemic spreading through Tasmania.

52
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The disease was first sighted

53
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in the northeast of Tasmania in 1996

54
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and has spread across Tasmania like a huge wave.

55
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now there's only a small part of the population,

56
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
which remains unaffected.

57
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This disease appears first as tumors,

58
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
usually on the face or inside the mouth

59
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of affected Tasmanian devils.

60
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
These tumors inevitably grow into larger tumors,

61
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
such as these ones here.

62
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And the next image I'm going to show

63
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is quite gruesome.

64
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But inevitably, these tumors progress

65
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
towards being enormous, ulcerating tumors like this one here.

66
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
This one in particular sticks in my mind,

67
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because this is the first case of this disease

68
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that I saw myself.

69
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And I remember the horror of seeing this little female devil

70
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
with this huge ulcerating, foul-smelling tumor

71
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
inside her mouth

72
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that had actually cracked off her entire lower jaw.

73
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
She hadn't eaten for days.

74
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Her guts were swimming with parasitic worms.

75
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Her body was riddled with secondary tumors.

76
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And yet, she was feeding three little baby Tasmanian devils

77
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in her pouch.

78
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Of course, they died along with the mother.

79
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
They were too young to survive without their mother.

80
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In fact, in the area where she comes from,

81
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
more than 90 percent of the Tasmanian devil population

82
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
has already died of this disease.

83
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Scientists around the world

84
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
were intrigued by this cancer,

85
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
this infectious cancer,

86
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that was spreading through the Tasmanian devil population.

87
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And our minds immediately turned to cervical cancer in women,

88
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
which is spread by a virus,

89
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and to the AIDS epidemic,

90
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
which is associated with a number of different types of cancer.

91
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
All the evidence suggested that this devil cancer

92
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
was spread by a virus.

93
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
However, we now know -- and I'll tell you right now --

94
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that we know that this cancer is not spread by a virus.

95
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
In fact, the infectious agent of disease in this cancer

96
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is something altogether more sinister,

97
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and something that we hadn't really thought of before.

98
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But in order for me to explain what that is,

99
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I need to spend just a couple of minutes

100
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
talking more about cancer itself.

101
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Cancer is a disease

102
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that affects millions of people around the world every year.

103
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
One in three people in this room

104
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
will develop cancer at some stage in their lives.

105
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine

106
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
when I was only 14.

107
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Cancer occurs

108
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
when a single cell in your body

109
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
acquires a set of random mutations in important genes

110
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that cause that cell to start to produce

111
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
more and more and more copies of itself.

112
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Paradoxically, once established,

113
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
natural selection actually favors

114
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the continued growth of cancer.

115
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Natural selection is survival of the fittest.

116
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And when you have a population of fast-dividing cancer cells,

117
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
if one of them acquires new mutations,

118
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which allow them to grow more quickly,

119
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
acquire nutrients more successfully,

120
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
invade the body,

121
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
they'll be selected for by evolution.

122
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
That's why cancer is such a difficult disease to treat.

123
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It evolves.

124
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Throw a drug at it,

125
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and resistant cells will grow back.

126
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
An amazing fact is that,

127
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
given the right environment and the right nutrients,

128
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
a cancer cell has the potential

129
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to go on growing forever.

130
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
However cancer is constrained

131
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
by living inside our bodies,

132
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and its continued growth,

133
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
its spreading through our bodies

134
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and eating away at our tissues,

135
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
leads to the death of the cancer patient

136
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and also to the death of the cancer itself.

137
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So cancer could be thought of

138
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
as a strange, short-lived, self-destructive life form --

139
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
an evolutionary dead end.

140
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But that is where the Tasmanian devil cancer

141
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
has acquired an absolutely amazing

142
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
evolutionary adaptation.

143
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And the answer came from studying

144
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the Tasmanian devil cancer's DNA.

145
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This was work from many people,

146
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
but I'm going to explain it through a confirmatory experiment

147
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that I did a few years ago.

148
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The next slide is going to be gruesome.

149
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This is Jonas.

150
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
He's a Tasmanian devil that we found

151
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
with a large tumor on his face.

152
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And being a geneticist,

153
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I'm always interested to look at DNA and mutations.

154
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So I took this opportunity

155
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
to collect some samples from Jonas' tumor

156
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and also some samples from other parts of his body.

157
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I took these back to the lab.

158
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I extracted DNA from them.

159
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And when I looked at the sequence of the DNA,

160
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and compared the sequence of Jonas' tumor

161
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to that of the rest of his body,

162
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I discovered that they had a completely different genetic profile.

163
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
In fact, Jonas and his tumor

164
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
were as different from each other

165
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
as you and the person sitting next to you.

166
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
What this told us was that Jonas' tumor

167
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
did not arise from cells of his own body.

168
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
In fact, more genetic profiling

169
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
told us that this tumor in Jonas

170
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
actually probably first arose

171
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
from the cells of a female Tasmanian devil --

172
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and Jonas was clearly a male.

173
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So how come

174
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
a tumor that arose from the cells of another individual

175
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is growing on Jonas' face?

176
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Well the next breakthrough

177
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
came from studying hundreds of Tasmanian devil cancers

178
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
from all around Tasmania.

179
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We found that all of these cancers

180
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
shared the same DNA.

181
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Think about that for a minute.

182
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
That means that all of these cancers

183
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
actually are the same cancer

184
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that arose once from one individual devil,

185
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that have broken free of that first devil's body

186
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and spread through the entire Tasmanian devil population.

187
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But how can a cancer spread in a population?

188
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Well the final piece of the puzzle came

189
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
when we remember how devils behave when they meet each other in the wild.

190
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
They tend to bite each other,

191
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
often quite ferociously and usually on the face.

192
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
We think that cancer cells

193
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
actually come off the tumor, get into the saliva.

194
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
When the devil bites another devil,

195
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
it actually physically implants living cancer cells into the next devil,

196
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
so the tumor continues to grow.

197
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So this Tasmanian devil cancer

198
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
is perhaps the ultimate cancer.

199
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
It's not constrained by living within the body that gave rise to it.

200
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It spreads through the population,

201
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
has mutations that allow it to evade the immune system,

202
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and it's the only cancer that we know of

203
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that's threatening an entire species with extinction.

204
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But if this can happen in Tasmanian devils,

205
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
why hasn't it happened in other animals

206
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
or even humans?

207
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Well the answer is, it has.

208
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
This is Kimbo.

209
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
He's a dog that belongs to a family in Mombasa in Kenya.

210
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Last year, his owner noticed some blood

211
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
trickling from his genital region.

212
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
She took him to the vet

213
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and the vet discovered something quite disgusting.

214
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And if you're squeamish, please look away now.

215
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
He discovered this,

216
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
a huge bleeding tumor

217
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
at the base of Kimbo's penis.

218
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The vet diagnosed this as transmissible venereal tumor,

219
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
a sexually transmitted cancer

220
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that affects dogs.

221
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And just as the Tasmanian devil cancer is contagious

222
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
through the spread of living cancer cells,

223
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
so is this dog cancer.

224
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But this dog cancer is quite remarkable,

225
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
because it spread all around the world.

226
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And in fact, these same cells

227
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that are affecting Kimbo here

228
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
are also found affecting dogs

229
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
in New York City,

230
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in mountain villages in the Himalayas

231
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and in Outback Australia.

232
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We also believe this cancer might be very old.

233
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
In fact, genetic profiling tells

234
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that it may be tens of thousands of years old,

235
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
which means that this cancer

236
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
may have first arisen

237
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
from the cells of a wolf

238
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that lived alongside the Neanderthals.

239
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This cancer is remarkable.

240
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It's the oldest mammalian-derived life form that we know of.

241
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It's a living relic

242
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
of the distant past.

243
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So we've seen that this can happen in animals.

244
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Could cancers be contagious between people?

245
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Well this is a question

246
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
which fascinated Chester Southam,

247
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
a cancer doctor in the 1950s.

248
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Ad he decided to put this to the test

249
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
by actually deliberately inoculating people

250
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
with cancer from somebody else.

251
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And this is a photograph of Dr. Southam in 1957

252
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
injecting cancer into a volunteer,

253
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
who in this case was an inmate

254
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
in Ohio State Penitentiary.

255
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Most of the people that Dr. Southam injected

256
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
did not go on to develop cancer

257
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
from the injected cells.

258
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But a small number of them did,

259
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and they were mostly people who were otherwise ill --

260
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
whose immune systems were probably compromised.

261
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
What this tells us,

262
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
ethical issues aside,

263
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
is that ...

264
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
(Laughter)

265
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
it's probably extremely rare

266
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
for cancers to be transferred between people.

267
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
However, under some circumstances,

268
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
it can happen.

269
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And I think that this is something

270
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that oncologists and epidemiologists

271
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
should be aware of in the future.

272
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So just finally,

273
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
cancer is an inevitable outcome

274
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
of the ability of our cells

275
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
to divide

276
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and to adapt to their environments.

277
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
But that does not mean that we should give up hope

278
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in the fight against cancer.

279
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
In fact, I believe, given more knowledge

280
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
of the complex evolutionary processes that drive cancer's growth,

281
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
we can defeat cancer.

282
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
My personal aim

283
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
is to defeat the Tasmanian devil cancer.

284
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Let's prevent the Tasmanian devil

285
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
from being the first animal

286
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
to go extinct from cancer.

287
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Thank you.

288
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Applause)

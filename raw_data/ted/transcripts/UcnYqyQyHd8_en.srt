1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I am going to be talking about secrets.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Obviously the best way to divulge a secret

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
is to tell someone to not say anything about it.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Secrets. I'm using PowerPoint this year

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
just because, you know, I'm into the TED thing.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And when you use these things you don't have to go like that.

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
You just press it.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Oh, man. Um, yes.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Yes. I'm sure! Just change it!

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Is Bill Gates here?

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Change it! Come on! What?

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Ah! Okay.

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That's not my slides, but it's okay.

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
As you can see, these are all maps.

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And maps are important devices for transferring information,

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
especially if you have human cognitive ability.

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
We can see that all formulas are really maps.

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Now, as humans, we make maps of places

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that we seldom even go,

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
which seems a little wasteful of time.

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
This, of course, is a map of the moon.

29
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
There're some very delightful names.

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Tranquilacalitis, [unclear]. My favorite is Frigoris.

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
What are these people thinking? Frigoris?

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
What the Frigoris you doing? Names are important.

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Frigoris? This is the Moon. People could live there one day.

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I'll meet you at Frigoris. No. I don't think so.

35
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
There we see Mars, again with various names.

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And this is all done, by the way,

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
by the International Astronomical Union.

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This is an actual group of people

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that sit around naming planetary objects.

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This is from their actual book.

42
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
These are some of the names that they have chosen, ladies and gentlemen.

43
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I'll go through a little of them. Bolotnitsa.

44
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That, of course, is the Slavic swamp mermaid.

45
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Now I think the whole concept of a mermaid

47
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
doesn't really blend into the swamp feel.

48
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
"Oh look! Mermaid come out of swamp. Oh boy!

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's time for Bolotnitsa!"

51
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Djabran Fluctus.

53
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
If that don't flow off the tongue, what does?

54
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I mean kids are studying this stuff

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and they've got the word "fluctus" up there. That's wrong.

57
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
One dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life.

59
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
"It fluctus up, Mama."

61
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Hikuleo Fluctus.

62
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
That's a little more flowing. Hikuleo

63
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
sounds like a kind of a Leonardo DiCaprio

64
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
17 syllable thing.

65
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And that's the Tonga underworld.

66
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And one of my favorites is the Itoki Fluctus,

67
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
who is the Nicaraguan goddess of insects, stars, and planets.

68
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now, if you're a goddess of stars and planets

69
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
wouldn't you relegate insects to somebody else?

70
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"No, no, really, I'm so busy with the stars.

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Would you mind taking the insects? Thank you darling.

73
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Oh take the spiders too. I know they're not insects, but I don't care.

74
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Monkeys, chimps, just get rid of the hairy creatures."

75
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Now, we're going to be going to Mars one day. And when we do,

77
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it's going to be unfair for the people that are living there

78
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to have to live with these ridiculous names.

79
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So, you'll be on Mars, and you're at

80
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Hellespointica Depressio

81
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
which has got to be a really "up" place.

82
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Yeah, I'm at the Depressio, and I want to get over to Amazonis

84
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
so I plug it into the Mars map,

85
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and click the button and there's my directions.

86
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I go to Chrysokeras.

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
(Laughter) Left to the Thymiamata.

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Then to Niliacus Lacus,

89
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
which is not a bad name.

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Niliacus Lacus, try to get the practice, slick-a-tick-a-bacus.

91
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That's a cool name. I will say that.

92
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So, I hold back a little of my venom

93
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
for these astronomical misnomers.

94
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And then of course Arnon to Thoth.

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And of course there will be advertisements.

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
This is from their rule book, the International Astronomical Union.

97
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And you know they're international because

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
they put it "en Francais" as well.

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
L'Union Astronomique Internationale,

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
for those of you who don't speak French.

101
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I thought I'd translate for you.

102
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
From the rulebook: Nomenclature is a tool.

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The first consideration, make it clear, simple and unambiguous.

104
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And I think that Djabran Fluctus,

105
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that fits that mode.

106
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Laughter)

107
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
That's simple, the goddess of goats, very simple.

108
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Djabran Fluctus.

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
"Now, Frank is this clear to you, Djabran Fluctus?"

110
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
"Yeah, that's the goat goddess right? The Abacazanian?

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

112
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's clear to me."

113
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
"Listen, I'm going back to the swamp mermaid. Can you call me in a little while?"

114
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

115
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Also, from the actual document

116
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I highlighted a part I thought may be of interest.

117
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Anyone can suggest changing a name.

118
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So, I look to you, fellow member of the Earth community.

119
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We've got to change this stuff up fast.

120
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So, these are actual names of people that work there.

121
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I did some more investigation.

122
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
These are more people working for this group.

123
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And, as you can see, they don't use their first names.

124
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

125
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
These are people naming planets, and they won't use their first names.

126
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Something is askew here.

127
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Is it because his name is really Jupiter Blunck?

129
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Is that Ganymede Andromeda Burba?

131
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

132
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Is that Mars Ya Marov?

133
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I don't know. But it's investigative material, no doubt.

134
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
There are some mapping people who do use their names.

135
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Witness please, Eugene Shoemaker,

136
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
who, diligently, from a young boy

137
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies.

138
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Must have been a very interesting day in the Shoemaker house.

139
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
"Mom, I want to make maps."

140
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
"That's wonderful Eugene. You could make maps of Toronto."

141
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
"No, I want to make maps of planets."

142
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"Yeah, go to your room."

143
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Laughter)

144
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Martians, Venusians, Jovians.

145
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We have names for places where people don't exist.

146
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
That seems a little silly to me.

147
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
There are no Jovians.

148
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Getting back to my premise, I used stamps, by the way,

149
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
because you don't have to pay anybody for the rights.

150
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

151
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Applause)

152
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
There is obviously Einstein, Niels Bohr,

153
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
de Fermat's last theorem, and I'm not sure whether that's James Coburn

154
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
or Richard Harris.

155
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Laughter)

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
It's definitely one of the two. I'm not really clear which one.

157
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But obviously the point is that numbers are maps.

158
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And within numbers, is there an underlying secret to the universe?

159
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
That is the premise of this particular presentation.

160
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
By the way, that's a natural picture of Saturn,

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
no adjustments. I mean that's just beautiful.

162
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So beautiful that I will even give up a laugh

163
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
to explain my love of this particular planet,

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and the day Saturday, named after it, wonderfully.

165
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So, formulas relate number to form.

166
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
That's Euler, his formula

167
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory

168
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
which is kind of cool, not that funny, but it is cool.

169
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
He was also famous for having no body.

171
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Laughter)

172
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Which a lot of you are like, "How did he figure that out?"

173
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
He's got no body, no man, just a head floating high.

174
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Here comes Euler.

175
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

176
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And that's an icosahedron,

177
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
which is one of the five sacred solids, very important shapes.

178
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You see the icosahedron again.

179
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The dodecahedron, it's dual.

180
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
There is a dodecahedron which I had to do in my room last night.

181
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The five sacred solids, as you can see there.

182
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads.

183
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

184
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Blue cheese, ranch, oil and vinegar, thousand islands and house.

185
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I suggest the house.

186
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The reality, now here is something important.

187
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
What's important about this is

188
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
these shapes are duals of each other.

189
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And you can see how the icosahedron

190
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
withdraws into the dodecahedron

191
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and then they just merge into each other.

192
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So, the whole concept of branes in the universe,

193
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron

194
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
this is a very good map of what could possibly be.

195
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And that is, of course, what we are here to talk about.

196
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
What a coincidence!

197
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
October 9th, in France, Jean-Pierre Luminet

198
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron,

199
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
based on information that they got from this probe.

200
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This would be a normal wave pattern.

201
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But what they're seeing, way out there in the far reaches

202
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
of the microwave background,

203
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
is this kind of odd undulation.

204
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It doesn't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be.

205
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So, you can kind of get an idea from this

206
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
extrapolating that back under this huge picture,

207
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like.

208
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And judging from this, it looks a little like a cheeseburger.

209
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
(Laughter)

210
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So, I'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger.

211
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And for me, that's a win-win.

212
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Everybody goes, I'm happy.

213
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Laughter)

214
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Better really hurry up.

215
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I just threw this in because

216
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
as important as all of our intellectual abilities are,

217
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
without heart and without love it's just -- it's all meaningless.

218
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And that, to me, is really beautiful.

219
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Laughter)

220
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Except for that creepy guy in the background.

221
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
(Laughter)

222
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Getting back to the point of my particular presentation,

223
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Kepler, one of my great heroes,

224
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
who realized that these five solids, which I spoke of earlier,

225
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
were related somehow to the planets,

226
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but he couldn't prove it. It freaked him out.

227
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
But it did lead to Newton discovering gravity.

228
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So, maps of things leading to organized understandings

229
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
of the universe in which we emerge.

230
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Now this is Isaac from a Vietnamese stamp.

231
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughter)

232
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I am not suggesting at all that my Vietnamese brothers and sisters

233
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
could maybe use a little art class here and there. But ...

234
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
(Laughter)

235
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that's not a good picture.

236
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Laughter)

237
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Not a good picture. Now, my friends in the island of Nevis

238
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
are a little better. Look at that! That's Isaac Newton.

239
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
That guy is rockin'.

240
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Laughter)

241
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
What a handsome cat.

242
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Once again, Nicaragua let me down.

243
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
(Laughter)

244
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And Copernicus looks like Johnny Carson, which is really weird.

245
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Laughter)

246
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I don't get that at all.

247
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Once again, these guys rock it out.

248
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Isaac is kickin' ass. Man, he looks like a rock star.

249
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
This is freaky is a major way.

250
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
This is Sierra Leone.

251
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
They got little babies in there, floating in there.

252
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Laughter)

253
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Man. I don't really need to comment on this.

254
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
But I didn't know that Isaac Newton was in the Moody Blues. Did you?

255
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Laughter)

256
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
When did this happen?

257
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Laughter)

258
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
It's a different kind of course. And they've got five apples?

259
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I mean these guys are extrapolating in realms

260
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that are not necessarily valid.

261
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Although five is a good number, of course.

262
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
Ecuador, my friend Kepler,

263
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
as you can see, they call him Juan.

264
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Laughter)

265
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Juan? No! Johannes, not Juan.

266
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It wasn't Carlos Chaplain. It's wrong.

267
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Laughter)

268
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
René Descartes, of course. Once again

269
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
these Grenada people, this is like way too sick

270
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
for anybody's imagination.

271
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
He's all murky. There is little kids leaning on his leg,

272
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
little ghosts flying around. We gotta clean this stuff up

273
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
fast, ladies and gentlemen.

274
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Laughter)

275
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
This is, of course, the Cartesian coordinates.

276
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Once again, that's Sierra Leone.

277
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
This is again, indicating how numbers

278
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
relate to space relate to form, maps of the universe.

279
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Because that's why we're here, really, I think to figure stuff out and to love each other.

280
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Descartes. (Laughter)

281
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Before the horse. (Laughter)

282
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Now, Monaco took Descartes, and just flipped him around.

283
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Now, Monaco is problematic for me, and I'll show you why.

284
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Here is a map. All they have is a casino on it.

285
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
(Laughter)

286
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And why Franklin Delano Roosevelt is on their map

287
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I don't even want to hazard a guess.

288
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But I'd say he'd been to Hellespointica Depressio recently.

289
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Laughter)

290
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
This is the flag of Monaco. Ladies and gentlemen,

291
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
the flag of Indonesia. Please examine.

292
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Laughter)

293
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Applause)

294
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Not sure how this came to be, but it's not right.

295
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
In Monaco, "No, what are you talking about?

296
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
They are so different.

297
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Look, ours is more red, it's longer.

298
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
They stole our flag! They stole our flag!"

299
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
(Laughter)

300
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Bode's law wasn't even his law. It was a guy named Titus.

301
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And the reason I just bring this up because it is a law that doesn't really work.

302
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
That's Jude Law and some of his films recently didn't work.

303
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

304
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted.

305
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And I wonder if the photographer said, "Okay, Jude,

306
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
could you touch your tooth? That's good."

307
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Just a tip, if you're being photographed

308
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
for press pictures, don't touch your teeth.

309
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Laughter)

310
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Prime numbers, Gauss, one of my favorites.

311
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Golden section, I've been obsessed with this thing

312
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
since before I was born.

313
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I know that scares a lot of you,

314
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
but that was my purpose entirely.

315
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
There we can see Fibonacci numbers related to the Golden Section,

316
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
because Fibonacci and Golden Section

317
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter, as I refer to it.

318
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
If Fibonacci had been on Paxil,

319
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Laughter)

320
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
that would be the Fibonacci series.

321
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
"Ten milligram, 20 milligram."

322
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
"Leonardo, dinner's ready, put down those books and take your pills."

323
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
"Yes, Mama."

324
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Laughter)

325
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Alright where is this going? That's a good question.

326
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Here is the premise that I began 27 years ago.

327
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
If numbers can express

328
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
the laws of this incredible universe that we live,

329
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
I reason, through some sort of reverse engineering,

330
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
we could extrapolate from them

331
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
some basic structural element of this universe.

332
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And that's what I did. Twenty-seven years ago

333
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I started working on this.

334
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And I tried to build a particle accelerator.

335
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Laughter)

336
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And that didn't work out well.

337
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So, then I thought a calculator is a metaphor.

338
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I can just divide numbers, that's like atom smashing.

339
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
That's what I did. That's how I found Moleeds.

340
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Moleeds are what I believe

341
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
the thing that will allow string theory to be proved.

342
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
They are the nodes on the string,

343
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
patterns and relationships, 27, 37.

344
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
That was the first chart I came up with.

345
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
You can see, even if you don't go for the numbers,

346
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
the beauty of the symmetry.

347
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
The numbers from one to 36, divided into six groups.

348
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Symmetry, pairs.

349
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Every top adds up to 37.

350
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Bottom, all 74.

351
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
There is so many intricate relationships that I'm not going to go there now,

352
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
because you would say, "Hey, go back to the Fluctus part."

353
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Laughter)

354
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Circle of Fifths, acoustic harmony, geometric symmetry.

355
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I knew those two were related.

356
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Once again, the Cartesian kind of cross-over.

357
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
So, I said if I'm going to put a circle,

358
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
see what kind of patterns I get, boom, the Red System.

359
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Look at that. You can't just make this stuff up, ladies and gentlemen.

360
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
(Laughter)

361
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
You can't just go around going, "Oh, I'm going to put some triangles in a circle

362
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and they're going to be symmetrical. And they're all going to add up,

363
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and it's going to be, oh yeah, I figured that out."

364
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
This is beyond anything anybody could just make up.

365
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
There is the Orange System.

366
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
(Laughter)

367
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And you'll see over here, these are multiples of the number 27.

368
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And they recapitulate that shape,

369
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
even though that's a circle of nine and that's a circle of 36. It's nuts.

370
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Laughter)

371
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
That's the Green System. It all folds in half

372
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
on the Green System, right between 18 and 19.

373
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
The Blue System. The Violet. It's all there.

374
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Laughter)

375
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Look at that! I mean you cannot make that stuff up.

376
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Laughter)

377
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
That just doesn't fall out of a tree, ladies and gentlemen.

378
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Twenty-seven years of my life!

379
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
(Laughter)

380
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And I'm presenting it here at TED. Why?

381
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Because this is the place if aliens land, I hope they come here.

382
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
(Laughter)

383
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
"We are going to destroy the Earth. Hmmm ... maybe not."

384
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
(Laughter)

385
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
In this last year I have found these subsequent systems

386
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
which allow for the mathematic possibilities

387
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
of the Calabi-Yau manifolds

388
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
in a way that doesn't necessitate these little hidden dimensions.

389
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Which works mathematically, but it just doesn't seem God-like to me.

390
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
It just seems like it's not sexy and elegant, it's hidden.

391
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
I don't want hidden, I want to see it.

392
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
(Laughter)

393
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
I found other pairs all have symmetry,

394
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
even though, unlike the master one, their symmetry is split.

395
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Unbelievable. This is like crazy.

396
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Am I the only one that sees this?

397
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
(Laughter)

398
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
You know, I didn't just draw this in a day, by the way.

399
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
You know, try making some charts like this at home.

400
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
You gotta be accurate! There's measurement involved, increments.

401
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
These are maps, by the way.

402
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Not stamps, but one day.

403
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
(Laughter)

404
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Okay, I'm getting to the punch. Golden Ratio, it's crazy.

405
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And look at this, built within it is the Golden Ratio.

406
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I start looking at that, and look at them again.

407
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
They start looking like planets.

408
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
I go to JPL.

409
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
I look at the orbits of the planets.

410
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
I find 18 examples of it in our solar system.

411
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
I never told anybody. This is the first thing. This could be history.

412
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Laughter)

413
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Kepler was right.

414
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
(Laughter)

415
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Eighteen and 19, the middle of the Moleeds, 0.618 is the golden section.

416
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Multiply them together, 18.618 x 19.618 is 365.247.

417
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Which is .005 different from the number of days in a year.

418
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Hey, you can't make this up.

419
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
(Laughter)

420
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Thank you very much.

421
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
(Applause)

422
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Thank you.

423
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
(Applause)

424
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Thank you.

425
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.892,000 --> 0:00:15,000
"Don't talk to strangers."

3
0:00:16.18,000 --> 0:00:18,000
You have heard that phrase uttered

4
0:00:18.219,000 --> 0:00:22,000
by your friends, family, schools and the media for decades.

5
0:00:22.532,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's a norm. It's a social norm.

6
0:00:25.444,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But it's a special kind of social norm,

7
0:00:27.802,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because it's a social norm that wants to tell us

8
0:00:30.332,000 --> 0:00:34,000
who we can relate to and who we shouldn't relate to.

9
0:00:34.796,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"Don't talk to strangers" says,

10
0:00:37.3,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"Stay from anyone who's not familiar to you.

11
0:00:41.476,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Stick with the people you know.

12
0:00:43.891,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Stick with people like you."

13
0:00:46.865,000 --> 0:00:48,000
How appealing is that?

14
0:00:49.217,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's not really what we do, is it, when we're at our best?

15
0:00:52.442,000 --> 0:00:54,000
When we're at our best, we reach out to people

16
0:00:55.226,000 --> 0:00:56,000
who are not like us,

17
0:00:56.844,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because when we do that, we learn from people

18
0:00:59.711,000 --> 0:01:01,000
who are not like us.

19
0:01:01.98,000 --> 0:01:05,000
My phrase for this value of being with "not like us"

20
0:01:06.081,000 --> 0:01:07,000
is "strangeness,"

21
0:01:07.953,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and my point is that in today's digitally intensive world,

22
0:01:11.853,000 --> 0:01:14,000
strangers are quite frankly not the point.

23
0:01:15.219,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The point that we should be worried about is,

24
0:01:17.402,000 --> 0:01:19,000
how much strangeness are we getting?

25
0:01:20.289,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Why strangeness? Because our social relations

26
0:01:23.295,000 --> 0:01:25,000
are increasingly mediated by data,

27
0:01:26.089,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and data turns our social relations into digital relations,

28
0:01:30.646,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and that means that our digital relations

29
0:01:32.995,000 --> 0:01:35,000
now depend extraordinarily on technology

30
0:01:36.797,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to bring to them a sense of robustness,

31
0:01:39.715,000 --> 0:01:4,000
a sense of discovery,

32
0:01:41.302,000 --> 0:01:44,000
a sense of surprise and unpredictability.

33
0:01:44.572,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Why not strangers?

34
0:01:46.339,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Because strangers are part of a world

35
0:01:48.633,000 --> 0:01:5,000
of really rigid boundaries.

36
0:01:50.898,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They belong to a world of people I know

37
0:01:53.85,000 --> 0:01:55,000
versus people I don't know,

38
0:01:56.364,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and in the context of my digital relations,

39
0:01:58.843,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I'm already doing things with people I don't know.

40
0:02:02.864,000 --> 0:02:05,000
The question isn't whether or not I know you.

41
0:02:06.082,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The question is, what can I do with you?

42
0:02:08.586,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What can I learn with you?

43
0:02:11.195,000 --> 0:02:15,000
What can we do together that benefits us both?

44
0:02:15.496,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I spend a lot of time thinking about

45
0:02:17.858,000 --> 0:02:19,000
how the social landscape is changing,

46
0:02:20.618,000 --> 0:02:22,000
how new technologies create new constraints

47
0:02:23.09,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and new opportunities for people.

48
0:02:25.88,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The most important changes facing us today

49
0:02:28.531,000 --> 0:02:3,000
have to do with data and what data is doing

50
0:02:31.337,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to shape the kinds of digital relations

51
0:02:33.442,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that will be possible for us in the future.

52
0:02:35.906,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The economies of the future depend on that.

53
0:02:38.139,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Our social lives in the future depend on that.

54
0:02:41.058,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The threat to worry about isn't strangers.

55
0:02:44.09,000 --> 0:02:46,000
The threat to worry about is whether or not

56
0:02:46.202,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we're getting our fair share of strangeness.

57
0:02:49.194,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Now, 20th-century psychologists and sociologists

58
0:02:51.786,000 --> 0:02:53,000
were thinking about strangers,

59
0:02:53.939,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but they weren't thinking so dynamically about human relations,

60
0:02:56.676,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and they were thinking about strangers

61
0:02:58.045,000 --> 0:03:,000
in the context of influencing practices.

62
0:03:00.999,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Stanley Milgram from the '60s and '70s,

63
0:03:03.747,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the creator of the small-world experiments,

64
0:03:05.733,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which became later popularized as six degrees of separation,

65
0:03:08.687,000 --> 0:03:11,000
made the point that any two arbitrarily selected people

66
0:03:12.199,000 --> 0:03:15,000
were likely connected from between five to seven intermediary steps.

67
0:03:15.921,000 --> 0:03:18,000
His point was that strangers are out there.

68
0:03:18.951,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We can reach them. There are paths

69
0:03:20.523,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that enable us to reach them.

70
0:03:23.209,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Mark Granovetter, Stanford sociologist, in 1973

71
0:03:26.978,000 --> 0:03:28,000
in his seminal essay "The Strength of Weak Ties,"

72
0:03:29.776,000 --> 0:03:31,000
made the point that these weak ties

73
0:03:32.602,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that are a part of our networks, these strangers,

74
0:03:35.089,000 --> 0:03:37,000
are actually more effective at diffusing information to us

75
0:03:38.081,000 --> 0:03:42,000
than are our strong ties, the people closest to us.

76
0:03:42.617,000 --> 0:03:45,000
He makes an additional indictment of our strong ties

77
0:03:46.114,000 --> 0:03:48,000
when he says that these people who are so close to us,

78
0:03:48.743,000 --> 0:03:49,000
these strong ties in our lives,

79
0:03:50.676,000 --> 0:03:53,000
actually have a homogenizing effect on us.

80
0:03:54.103,000 --> 0:03:56,000
They produce sameness.

81
0:03:56.938,000 --> 0:03:58,000
My colleagues and I at Intel have spent the last few years

82
0:03:59.777,000 --> 0:04:01,000
looking at the ways in which digital platforms

83
0:04:02.393,000 --> 0:04:03,000
are reshaping our everyday lives,

84
0:04:04.264,000 --> 0:04:06,000
what kinds of new routines are possible.

85
0:04:06.881,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We've been looking specifically at the kinds

86
0:04:08.177,000 --> 0:04:1,000
of digital platforms that have enabled us

87
0:04:10.888,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to take our possessions, those things that used to be

88
0:04:14.023,000 --> 0:04:17,000
very restricted to us and to our friends in our houses,

89
0:04:17.145,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and to make them available to people we don't know.

90
0:04:20.967,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Whether it's our clothes, whether it's our cars,

91
0:04:23.69,000 --> 0:04:25,000
whether it's our bikes, whether it's our books or music,

92
0:04:26.313,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we are able to take our possessions now

93
0:04:29.306,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and make them available to people we've never met.

94
0:04:32.737,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And we concluded a very important insight,

95
0:04:35.548,000 --> 0:04:36,000
which was that as people's relationships

96
0:04:37.336,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to the things in their lives change,

97
0:04:39.877,000 --> 0:04:42,000
so do their relations with other people.

98
0:04:43.321,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And yet recommendation system

99
0:04:44.729,000 --> 0:04:48,000
after recommendation system continues to miss the boat.

100
0:04:49.004,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It continues to try to predict what I need

101
0:04:51.553,000 --> 0:04:54,000
based on some past characterization of who I am,

102
0:04:54.793,000 --> 0:04:56,000
of what I've already done.

103
0:04:57.089,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Security technology after security technology

104
0:04:59.593,000 --> 0:05:01,000
continues to design data protection

105
0:05:01.769,000 --> 0:05:03,000
in terms of threats and attacks,

106
0:05:04.174,000 --> 0:05:07,000
keeping me locked into really rigid kinds of relations.

107
0:05:07.769,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Categories like "friends" and "family"

108
0:05:10.265,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and "contacts" and "colleagues"

109
0:05:12.742,000 --> 0:05:15,000
don't tell me anything about my actual relations.

110
0:05:16.529,000 --> 0:05:18,000
A more effective way to think about my relations

111
0:05:18.773,000 --> 0:05:2,000
might be in terms of closeness and distance,

112
0:05:21.465,000 --> 0:05:24,000
where at any given point in time, with any single person,

113
0:05:25.285,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I am both close and distant from that individual,

114
0:05:28.776,000 --> 0:05:32,000
all as a function of what I need to do right now.

115
0:05:33.284,000 --> 0:05:35,000
People aren't close or distant.

116
0:05:35.922,000 --> 0:05:38,000
People are always a combination of the two,

117
0:05:38.983,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and that combination is constantly changing.

118
0:05:42.703,000 --> 0:05:44,000
What if technologies could intervene

119
0:05:45.143,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to disrupt the balance of certain kinds of relationships?

120
0:05:49.12,000 --> 0:05:5,000
What if technologies could intervene

121
0:05:51.081,000 --> 0:05:55,000
to help me find the person that I need right now?

122
0:05:55.492,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Strangeness is that calibration

123
0:05:57.916,000 --> 0:05:59,000
of closeness and distance

124
0:06:00.135,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that enables me to find the people that I need right now,

125
0:06:04.038,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that enables me to find the sources of intimacy,

126
0:06:07.028,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of discovery, and of inspiration that I need right now.

127
0:06:11.676,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Strangeness is not about meeting strangers.

128
0:06:13.985,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It simply makes the point that we need

129
0:06:16.18,000 --> 0:06:19,000
to disrupt our zones of familiarity.

130
0:06:19.462,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness,

131
0:06:23.119,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and it's a problem faced not just by individuals today,

132
0:06:25.823,000 --> 0:06:27,000
but also by organizations,

133
0:06:28.053,000 --> 0:06:32,000
organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities.

134
0:06:32.576,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Whether you're a political party

135
0:06:34.682,000 --> 0:06:36,000
insisting to your detriment on a very rigid notion

136
0:06:37.55,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of who belongs and who does not,

137
0:06:39.938,000 --> 0:06:4,000
whether you're the government

138
0:06:41.431,000 --> 0:06:43,000
protecting social institutions like marriage

139
0:06:44.129,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and restricting access of those institutions to the few,

140
0:06:48.022,000 --> 0:06:5,000
whether you're a teenager in her bedroom

141
0:06:50.43,000 --> 0:06:53,000
who's trying to jostle her relations with her parents,

142
0:06:53.618,000 --> 0:06:56,000
strangeness is a way to think about how we pave the way

143
0:06:56.78,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to new kinds of relations.

144
0:06:59.254,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We have to change the norms.

145
0:07:02.612,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We have to change the norms in order to enable

146
0:07:05.642,000 --> 0:07:06,000
new kinds of technologies

147
0:07:07.58,000 --> 0:07:09,000
as a basis for new kinds of businesses.

148
0:07:10.369,000 --> 0:07:13,000
What interesting questions lie ahead for us

149
0:07:14.102,000 --> 0:07:16,000
in this world of no strangers?

150
0:07:16.773,000 --> 0:07:19,000
How might we think differently about our relations with people?

151
0:07:20.579,000 --> 0:07:23,000
How might we think differently about our relations

152
0:07:23.7,000 --> 0:07:25,000
with distributed groups of people?

153
0:07:25.792,000 --> 0:07:29,000
How might we think differently about our relations with technologies,

154
0:07:30.233,000 --> 0:07:33,000
things that effectively become social participants

155
0:07:33.239,000 --> 0:07:35,000
in their own right?

156
0:07:35.313,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The range of digital relations is extraordinary.

157
0:07:39.126,000 --> 0:07:43,000
In the context of this broad range of digital relations,

158
0:07:43.683,000 --> 0:07:45,000
safely seeking strangeness might very well be

159
0:07:46.657,000 --> 0:07:48,000

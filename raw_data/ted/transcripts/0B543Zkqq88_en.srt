1
0:00:13.548,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Four years ago,

2
0:00:14.992,000 --> 0:00:16,000
a teenage girl changed my life

3
0:00:18.008,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in one conversation.

4
0:00:20.262,000 --> 0:00:21,000
She was 13 years old,

5
0:00:21.603,000 --> 0:00:22,000
she was a friend's little cousin

6
0:00:23.284,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and she casually told me

7
0:00:24.506,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that she had met the man she was going to marry.

8
0:00:28.577,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So I said, "OK, tell me about him."

9
0:00:31.894,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And she told me that his name was Harry Styles.

10
0:00:35.045,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:36.688,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So I laughed a little, like you,

12
0:00:38.688,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and then she said, "I know you don't think I'm serious,

13
0:00:41.307,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but I'm actually going to be with him.

14
0:00:43.245,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Because I love him so much

15
0:00:44.924,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that I would slit someone's throat to be with him."

16
0:00:47.376,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:50.877,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And that was the moment

18
0:00:52.639,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that I became obsessed with fangirls.

19
0:00:57.084,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I didn't know it then,

20
0:00:58.342,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but that moment would transform the course of my life

21
0:01:02.14,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and go on to change everything that I thought I knew

22
0:01:05.394,000 --> 0:01:06,000
about being an adult,

23
0:01:06.95,000 --> 0:01:07,000
being a woman

24
0:01:08.149,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and being truly happy.

25
0:01:09.95,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But before we get started,

26
0:01:11.95,000 --> 0:01:12,000
what is a fangirl,

27
0:01:13.252,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and what is a Harry Styles?

28
0:01:15.427,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Well, according to the dictionary, the Merriam-Webster dictionary,

29
0:01:18.895,000 --> 0:01:2,000
a fangirl is a "girl or woman

30
0:01:21.688,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who is an extremely or overly enthusiastic fan

31
0:01:24.974,000 --> 0:01:26,000
of someone or something."

32
0:01:27.243,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Technically, you can have fangirls of anything,

33
0:01:29.506,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but my specific interest was in fangirls of boy bands.

34
0:01:33.149,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Because of their somewhat lethal reputation.

35
0:01:36.554,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I remember, my dad had told me this story of some Beatles fans in the '60s,

36
0:01:40.776,000 --> 0:01:44,000
who apparently had torn a parked BMW to literal pieces,

37
0:01:45.165,000 --> 0:01:47,000
because the band had supposedly just been sat in it.

38
0:01:48.416,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In the '60s, the Beatles were the biggest boy band on the planet,

39
0:01:52.432,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but when I met this girl in 2015,

40
0:01:55.289,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the biggest boy band on the planet was none other than One Direction.

41
0:02:00.114,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And Harry Styles was a member of One Direction.

42
0:02:04.807,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Harry Styles was reputed for his compassionate demeanor

43
0:02:07.982,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and perfect hair.

44
0:02:10.188,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I learn this when I read thousands of tweets about him.

45
0:02:13.847,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I learn that he is a sweet cupcake.

46
0:02:15.871,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I learn that he is a perfect angel.

47
0:02:17.943,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I learn that one time,

48
0:02:19.133,000 --> 0:02:21,000
he vomited on the side of a freeway in California

49
0:02:21.784,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and that within two hours,

50
0:02:23.419,000 --> 0:02:25,000
fans had turned the site of the vomit into a sacred shrine.

51
0:02:26.355,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:27.688,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I scroll through --

53
0:02:28.98,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:31.559,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I scroll through fan-made paintings of Harry,

55
0:02:34.551,000 --> 0:02:35,000
baby photos of him,

56
0:02:35.987,000 --> 0:02:37,000
paintings of baby photos of him.

57
0:02:38.344,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I watch videos that show me how to make DIY love totems for Harry --

58
0:02:42.151,000 --> 0:02:45,000
for example, a lampshade covered in photos of his face,

59
0:02:45.546,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or a key ring that states the exact time of his birth.

60
0:02:49.188,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I read hours of fan fiction,

61
0:02:50.911,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and I fall down this specific rabbit hole

62
0:02:53.323,000 --> 0:02:56,000
of stories that actually place me as a protagonist

63
0:02:56.569,000 --> 0:02:58,000
inside of various imagined romances with him.

64
0:02:59.427,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So in one, I tell him that I'm pregnant with his child.

65
0:03:03.315,000 --> 0:03:06,000
In another, we meet in hospital where we're both fighting cancer,

66
0:03:06.552,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and in another, we fall so deeply in love

67
0:03:09.353,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that we become fugitives who kill people.

68
0:03:11.721,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:13.679,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But then ...

70
0:03:15.784,000 --> 0:03:17,000
something unthinkable happens.

71
0:03:19.252,000 --> 0:03:22,000
One Direction, the biggest boy band on the planet,

72
0:03:23.22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
loses a member.

73
0:03:25.514,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Zayn Malik quits the band,

74
0:03:28.498,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and the internet explodes with feels.

75
0:03:32.797,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I read tweets as these girls describe the physical pain of this loss,

76
0:03:36.972,000 --> 0:03:39,000
how they can't eat or sleep or walk.

77
0:03:40.249,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I read them describe how much Zayn had meant to them.

78
0:03:43.738,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And I watch videos of 10-year-old girls crying.

79
0:03:48.079,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But, like, really crying.

80
0:03:50.968,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And then I watch as people repost these videos but with new titles

81
0:03:54.308,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that contain words like "crazy" and "creepy" and "insane."

82
0:03:58.192,000 --> 0:04:,000
And suddenly, my YouTube sidebar contains

83
0:04:00.922,000 --> 0:04:03,000
"Compilation: Fans react to Zayn leaving.

84
0:04:04.446,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Psycho alert!"

85
0:04:06.359,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Then I watch as mainstream news outlets cover the story.

86
0:04:10.014,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I read them describe these "young banshees."

87
0:04:12.847,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I read one journalist say,

88
0:04:14.656,000 --> 0:04:16,000
"It's a commonly known fact since the age of the Beatles

89
0:04:17.665,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that there is nothing scarier in this world

90
0:04:19.838,000 --> 0:04:21,000
than a group of excited teenage girls."

91
0:04:22.23,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:24.205,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And then I ask myself a question I've never considered in my life.

93
0:04:28.967,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Why is it that the image of young girls screaming their lungs out with excitement

94
0:04:34.981,000 --> 0:04:35,000
for a pop star

95
0:04:36.466,000 --> 0:04:39,000
is considered crazy, psycho,

96
0:04:40.339,000 --> 0:04:42,000
scary, a bit much?

97
0:04:42.958,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But the image of young boys screaming their lungs out for a footballer

98
0:04:48.553,000 --> 0:04:49,000
is perfectly normal?

99
0:04:50.919,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Boys crying at the footie,

100
0:04:52.677,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that's the love of the game.

101
0:04:54.903,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Girls crying at a Justin Bieber concert?

102
0:04:57.981,000 --> 0:04:58,000
That's pathetic.

103
0:04:59.895,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And as soon as I realized this double standard,

104
0:05:02.339,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I realized that all of my curiosity about fangirls

105
0:05:05.046,000 --> 0:05:07,000
had been sparked by exactly the same judgments.

106
0:05:07.8,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I, too, had suspected that they were a bit crazy.

107
0:05:11.624,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I'd looked at images of girls screaming for the Beatles,

108
0:05:14.547,000 --> 0:05:15,000
the Backstreet Boys, One Direction,

109
0:05:16.324,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and the word that had come to mind was not "excitement"

110
0:05:19.246,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but "hysteria."

111
0:05:21.102,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And what I did not know was the history of that word.

112
0:05:24.086,000 --> 0:05:25,000
That in the 19th century,

113
0:05:26.023,000 --> 0:05:3,000
hysteria was considered to be a legitimate female mental disorder

114
0:05:30.405,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that could be diagnosed by doctors

115
0:05:32.561,000 --> 0:05:36,000
if women displayed excessive emotion or difficult behavior.

116
0:05:37.847,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The word "hysterical" comes from the Latin word "hystericus,"

117
0:05:40.863,000 --> 0:05:41,000
meaning "of the womb,"

118
0:05:42.538,000 --> 0:05:46,000
because it was thought that this condition was caused by a dysfunction of the uterus.

119
0:05:46.679,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And so, a treatment for hysteria

120
0:05:50.363,000 --> 0:05:51,000
was a hysterectomy.

121
0:05:52.49,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Which is what we still call a removal of the womb.

122
0:05:55.781,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And at this point,

123
0:05:57.051,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I decide to redeclare my obsession.

124
0:06:00.019,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Because I am no longer just obsessed with fangirls.

125
0:06:03.456,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now, I'm obsessed with the way that the world talks about fangirls

126
0:06:08.518,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and the way that the world looks at young, female enthusiasm.

127
0:06:15.51,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Because, I want to know,

128
0:06:18.269,000 --> 0:06:2,000
if girls grow up in a world

129
0:06:21.118,000 --> 0:06:26,000
where words like "crazy" and "psycho" and "hysterical" are casually used

130
0:06:26.166,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to describe female enthusiasm,

131
0:06:29.109,000 --> 0:06:33,000
then how does that shape the way that those girls get to see themselves?

132
0:06:33.601,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And if girls grow up in a world that tells them

133
0:06:37.926,000 --> 0:06:41,000
that they are designed just a bit crazier than the boys,

134
0:06:42.411,000 --> 0:06:44,000
then isn't that a little bit like telling them

135
0:06:44.73,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that they are born less capable of rationality than men,

136
0:06:49.077,000 --> 0:06:5,000
less capable of reason

137
0:06:51.133,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and unworthy of the same intellectual respect as their brothers.

138
0:06:56.522,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Separately, I become obsessed with female screams.

139
0:07:00.665,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Not in a creepy way.

140
0:07:01.927,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I'm talking about, like, those shrieks and squeals

141
0:07:04.285,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that fangirls let out at concerts.

142
0:07:06.307,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I want to know why it is

143
0:07:07.641,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that some people instinctively flinch when I merely describe the sound,

144
0:07:11.061,000 --> 0:07:13,000
like it's painful just to think about it.

145
0:07:13.847,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Then I meet Amy Hume.

146
0:07:16.609,000 --> 0:07:17,000
She's a voice coach.

147
0:07:18.228,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And she blows my mind.

148
0:07:21.3,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Because she tells me that the female voice

149
0:07:23.347,000 --> 0:07:25,000
between the ages of 11 and 13

150
0:07:25.822,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is one of the most interesting things to study.

151
0:07:28.814,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Why?

152
0:07:29.996,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Because there's this research by Carol Gilligan

153
0:07:32.298,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that says that is the age

154
0:07:33.711,000 --> 0:07:36,000
when girls begin to perform and alter their voices.

155
0:07:36.972,000 --> 0:07:39,000
For example, adding breath for maturity,

156
0:07:40.369,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Imitating vocal fry) or adding vocal fry for apathy.

157
0:07:43.163,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:45.258,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But tell me, according to this research,

159
0:07:48.053,000 --> 0:07:51,000
when do you reckon boys begin to perform and alter their voices?

160
0:07:51.934,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Now, I guessed 18,

161
0:07:53.148,000 --> 0:07:55,000
because "men mature later," right?

162
0:07:56.299,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Wrong.

163
0:07:57.696,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The answer was four years old.

164
0:07:59.777,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Because that is when boys learn not to cry or squeal.

165
0:08:04.23,000 --> 0:08:06,000
That those are not manly sounds.

166
0:08:07.46,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And that's when I realized

167
0:08:09.015,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that a fangirl's shriek is therefore like a superpower.

168
0:08:13.728,000 --> 0:08:14,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:15.014,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Because it's this fearless and honest expression

170
0:08:18.941,000 --> 0:08:2,000
of pure celebration and joy,

171
0:08:21.334,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and it's a sound

172
0:08:23.179,000 --> 0:08:25,000
they have not forgotten how to make.

173
0:08:26.704,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I actually reckon that fangirls have a second superpower,

174
0:08:29.879,000 --> 0:08:3,000
because they know how to do something

175
0:08:31.68,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that most of my adult friends have no idea how to do.

176
0:08:35.133,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Fangirls know how to love something without apology or fear.

177
0:08:40.364,000 --> 0:08:41,000
My years of researching fangirls

178
0:08:42.228,000 --> 0:08:44,000
culminated in this determination

179
0:08:44.355,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to write something that celebrates and vindicates them.

180
0:08:47.466,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So I decided to make this thriller comedy musical

181
0:08:50.68,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that sounds like a Beyoncé concert meets rave meets church.

182
0:08:54.436,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I called it "Fangirls,"

183
0:08:55.927,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and I designed it like a Trojan horse.

184
0:08:58.688,000 --> 0:09:,000
So it appears to make fun of these young women,

185
0:09:00.958,000 --> 0:09:02,000
only to, like, smuggle them into your heart.

186
0:09:03.325,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Laughter)

187
0:09:06.199,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Thanks.

188
0:09:07.374,000 --> 0:09:09,000
(Applause)

189
0:09:09.618,000 --> 0:09:1,000
At one point --

190
0:09:11.459,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Thanks.

191
0:09:12.634,000 --> 0:09:14,000
At one point, a girl sings,

192
0:09:15.109,000 --> 0:09:16,000
"Why should I hide my feelings?

193
0:09:17.03,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Because they annoy you?

194
0:09:18.791,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Or because it isn't what the boys do?"

195
0:09:22.347,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And as a former fangirl cynic,

196
0:09:24.331,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that is the question that I want to leave you all with.

197
0:09:27.744,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Why should fangirls tone it down?

198
0:09:30.014,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Because they're crazy?

199
0:09:31.665,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Or because our definition of "reasonable"

200
0:09:34.125,000 --> 0:09:36,000
is based on what it is acceptable for men to do?

201
0:09:38.129,000 --> 0:09:41,000
What if we rethink the judgments we've been conditioned to feel

202
0:09:41.422,000 --> 0:09:44,000
when we see young women screaming their lungs out with excitement?

203
0:09:45.105,000 --> 0:09:47,000
What if we decided to rethink the words we use

204
0:09:47.712,000 --> 0:09:48,000
to describe that joy,

205
0:09:49.157,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and what if we didn't allow ourselves to diminish girls

206
0:09:53.093,000 --> 0:09:55,000
with words that undermine their intelligence,

207
0:09:55.993,000 --> 0:09:57,000
their interests and their capability?

208
0:09:58.755,000 --> 0:10:,000
Because, according to my research,

209
0:10:01.755,000 --> 0:10:04,000
they are capable of building a shrine to Harry Styles's vomit

210
0:10:05.704,000 --> 0:10:07,000
on the side of a freeway within two hours.

211
0:10:08.53,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Laughter)

212
0:10:09.823,000 --> 0:10:12,000
That takes some executive skills in logistics and communication.

213
0:10:13.792,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Laughter)

214
0:10:15.468,000 --> 0:10:17,000
If that isn't "capable," I don't know what is.

215
0:10:17.687,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Applause)

216
0:10:24.461,000 --> 0:10:27,000
I reckon, instead of judging fangirls, we can learn from them.

217
0:10:28.59,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We can all die tomorrow,

218
0:10:29.772,000 --> 0:10:31,000
so why not love things while we're still breathing?

219
0:10:32.662,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And with that,

220
0:10:34.257,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I'd like to ask you all to try something with me.

221
0:10:36.974,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Can I get you all to stand up?

222
0:10:38.807,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Stand up if you can, stand up.

223
0:10:40.942,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Alright, so here's what's going to happen.

224
0:10:43.005,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I'm going to count to three

225
0:10:44.748,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and when I finish,

226
0:10:45.923,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I'm going to ask every single one of you

227
0:10:48.114,000 --> 0:10:5,000
to let out your very best fangirl scream.

228
0:10:51.003,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter)

229
0:10:52.185,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Yeah?

230
0:10:53.375,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Here is why I am asking you to do this.

231
0:10:55.609,000 --> 0:11:,000
Because if all five-or-so thousand of you do this and really commit,

232
0:11:01.228,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we all get our first chance to hear that sound

233
0:11:05.117,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and to decide that it is not a crazy sound.

234
0:11:08.577,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It is a hopeful sound.

235
0:11:10.577,000 --> 0:11:11,000
So shall we do this?

236
0:11:12.363,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I said, shall we do this?

237
0:11:13.839,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Audience: Yes!)

238
0:11:15.014,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Alright. OK, I am going to cheat and I'm not going to go full volume,

239
0:11:18.548,000 --> 0:11:2,000
because I'm miked and we don't want to hear that.

240
0:11:20.858,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But it means you all have to go 110 percent.

241
0:11:23.221,000 --> 0:11:25,000
You ready? Take a deep breath with me.

242
0:11:25.712,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Think of someone you love, let's go,

243
0:11:27.485,000 --> 0:11:29,000
one, two, three.

244
0:11:30.181,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Audience screams)

245
0:11:36.67,000 --> 0:11:43,000
(Laughter and applause)

246
0:11:45.482,000 --> 0:11:49,000
You all just sounded stunning

247
0:11:49.608,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and as sane and as intelligent

248
0:11:54.27,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and as dignified

249
0:11:55.468,000 --> 0:11:56,000
as when you walked in this room.

250
0:11:57.19,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Laughter)

251
0:11:58.214,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Thank you.

252
0:11:59.389,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Applause)

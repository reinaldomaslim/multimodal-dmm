1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
A few words about how I got started,

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and it has a lot to do with happiness, actually.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
When I was a very young child, I was extremely introverted

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and very much to myself.

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And, kind of as a way of surviving,

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I would go into my own very personal space,

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I would make things.

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I would make things for people

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
as a way of, you know, giving, showing them my love.

10
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I would go into these private places,

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and I would put my ideas and my passions into objects --

12
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and sort of learning how to speak with my hands.

13
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So, the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects

14
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is very much connected with not only the idea realm,

15
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but also with very much the feeling realm.

16
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And the ideas are very disparate.

17
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I'm going to show you many different kinds of pieces,

18
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and there's no real connection between one or the other,

19
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
except that they sort of come out of my brain,

20
0:01:19.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and they're all different sort of thoughts that are triggered

21
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
by looking at life, and seeing nature and seeing objects,

22
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and just having kind of playful random thoughts about things.

23
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
When I was a child, I started to explore motion.

24
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I fell in love with the way things moved,

25
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:46,000
so I started to explore motion by making little flipbooks.

26
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And this is one that I did, probably like when I was around seventh grade,

27
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and I remember when I was doing this,

28
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I was thinking about that little rock there,

29
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and the pathway of the vehicles as they would fly through the air,

30
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and how the characters --

31
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter) --

32
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:06,000
would come shooting out of the car,

33
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
so, on my mind, I was thinking about the trajectory of the vehicles.

34
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And of course, when you're a little kid, there's always destruction.

35
0:02:16.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So, it has to end with this --

36
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter) --

37
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
gratuitous violence.

38
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So that was how I first started to explore the way things moved,

40
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and expressed it.

41
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, when I went to college,

42
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I found myself making fairly complicated, fragile machines.

43
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And this really came about

44
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
from having many different kinds of interests.

45
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
When I was in high school, I loved to program computers,

46
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
so I sort of liked the logical flow of events.

47
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I was also very interested in perhaps going into surgery

48
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and becoming a surgeon,

49
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
because it meant working with my hands

50
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in a very focused, intense way.

51
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So, I started taking art courses,

52
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and I found a way to make sculpture

53
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that brought together my love for being very precise with my hands,

54
0:03:15.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
with coming up with different kinds of logical flows of energy through a system.

55
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And also, working with wire -- everything that I did

56
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
was both a visual and a mechanical engineering decision

57
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
at the same time.

58
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So, I was able to sort of exercise all of that.

59
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Now, this kind of machine is as close as I can get to painting.

60
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And it's full of many little trivial end points,

61
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
like there's a little foot here that just drags around in circles

62
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and it doesn't really mean anything.

63
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's really just for the sort of joy of its own triviality.

64
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The connection I have with engineering

65
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is the same as any other engineer, in that I love to solve problems.

66
0:04:13.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I love to figure things out,

67
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but the end result of what I'm doing is really completely ambiguous.

68
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

69
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:25,000
That's pretty ambiguous.

70
0:04:25.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

71
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The next piece that is going to come up

72
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is an example of a kind of machine that is fairly complex.

73
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I gave myself the problem.

74
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Since I'm always liking to solve problems,

75
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I gave myself the problem of turning a crank in one direction,

76
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and solving all of the mechanical problems

77
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
for getting this little man to walk back and forth.

78
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So, when I started this, I didn't have an overall plan for the machine,

79
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but I did have a sense of the gesture,

80
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and a sense of the shape and how it would occupy space.

81
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And then it was a matter of starting from one point

82
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and sort of building to that final point.

83
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That little gear there switches back and forth to change direction.

84
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And that's a little found object.

85
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So a lot of the pieces that I've made,

86
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
they involve found objects.

87
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And it really -- it's almost like doing visual puns all the time.

88
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
When I see objects, I imagine them in motion.

89
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I imagine what can be said with them.

90
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
This next one here, "Machine with Wishbone,"

91
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
it came about from playing with this wishbone after dinner.

92
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You know, they say, never play with your food --

93
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
but I always play with things.

94
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So, I had this wishbone, and I thought,

95
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
it's kind of like a cowboy who's been on his horse for too long.

96
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Laughter)

97
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And I started to make him walk across the table,

98
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and I thought, "Oh, I can make a little machine that will do that."

99
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So, I made this device, linked it up, and the wishbone walks.

100
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And because the wishbone is bone -- it's animal --

101
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
it's sort of a point where I think we can enter into it.

102
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And that's the whole piece.

103
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

104
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
That's about that big.

105
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Applause)

106
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
This kind of work is also very much like puppetry,

107
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
where the found object is, in a sense, the puppet,

108
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and I'm the puppeteer at first, because I'm playing with an object.

109
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But then I make the machine, which is sort of the stand-in for me,

110
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and it is able to achieve the action that I want.

111
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The next piece I'll show you is a much more conceptual thought,

112
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and it's a little piece called "Cory's Yellow Chair."

113
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I had this image in my mind, when I saw my son's little chair,

114
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and I saw it explode up and out.

115
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And --

116
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
so the way I saw this in my mind at first,

117
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
was that the pieces would explode up and out with infinite speed,

118
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and the pieces would move far out,

119
0:07:37.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and then they would begin to be pulled back

120
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
with a kind of a gravitational feel,

121
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to the point where they would approach infinite speed back to the center.

122
0:07:45.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And they would coalesce for just a moment,

123
0:07:48.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
so you could perceive that there was a chair there.

124
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
For me, it's kind of a feeling about the fleetingness of the present moment,

125
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and I wanted to express that.

126
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Now, the machine is -- in this case, it's a real approximation of that,

127
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because obviously you can't move physical matter

128
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
infinitely with infinite speed and have it stop instantaneously.

129
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
This whole thing is about four feet wide,

130
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and the chair itself is only about a few inches.

131
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Applause)

132
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now, this is a funny sort of conceptual thing,

133
0:08:26.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and yesterday we were talking about Danny Hillis' "10,000 Year Clock."

134
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So, we have a motor here on the left,

135
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and it goes through a gear train.

136
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
There are 12 pairs of 50:1 reductions,

137
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
so that means that the final speed of that gear on the end

138
0:08:46.33,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is so slow that it would take two trillion years to turn once.

139
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So I've invented it in concrete, because it doesn't really matter.

140
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

141
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Because it could run all the time.

142
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Laughter)

143
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Now, a completely different thought.

144
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I'm always imagining myself in different situations.

145
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I'm imagining myself as a machine.

146
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
What would I love?

147
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I would love to be bathed in oil.

148
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter)

149
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So, this machine does nothing but just bathe itself in oil.

150
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Laughter)

151
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Applause)

152
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And it's really, just sort of --

153
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
for me, it was just really about the lusciousness of oil.

154
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Laughter)

155
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And then, I got a call from a friend

156
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
who wanted to have a show of erotic art,

157
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and I didn't have any pieces.

158
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
But when she suggested to be in the show, this piece came to mind.

159
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So, it's sort of related, but you can see it's much more overtly erotic.

160
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And this one I call "Machine with Grease."

161
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's just continually ejaculating, and it's --

162
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Laughter) --

163
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
this is a happy machine, I'll tell you.

164
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Laughter)

165
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
It's definitely happy.

166
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
From an engineering point of view,

167
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
this is just a little four-bar linkage.

168
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And then again, this is a found object, a little fan that I found.

169
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And I thought, what about the gesture of opening the fan,

170
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and how simply could I state something.

171
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And, in a case like this, I'm trying to make something which is clear

172
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but also not suggestive of any particular kind of animal or plant.

173
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
For me, the process is very important,

174
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
because I'm inventing machines,

175
0:10:40.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
but I'm also inventing tools to make machines,

176
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning.

177
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
So this is a little wire-bending tool.

178
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
After many years of bending gears with a pair of pliers,

179
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I made that tool, and then I made this other tool

180
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
for sort of centering gears very quickly --

181
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
sort of developing my own little world of technology.

182
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
My life completely changed when I found a spot welder.

183
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Laughter)

184
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And that was that tool.

185
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It completely changed what I could do.

186
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Now here, I'm going to do a very poor job of silver soldering.

187
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
This is not the way they teach you to silver solder when you're in school.

188
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I just like, throw it in.

189
0:11:25.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I mean, real jewelers put little bits of solder in.

190
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So, that's a finished gear.

191
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
When I moved to Boston,

192
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I joined a group called the World Sculpture Racing Society.

193
0:11:39.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

194
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And the idea, their premise was that we wanted to show

195
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
pieces of sculpture on the street,

196
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and there'd be no subjective decision about what was the best.

197
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It would be -- whatever came across the finish line first would be the winner.

198
0:11:55.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Laughter)

199
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
So I made -- this is my first racing sculpture,

200
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and I thought, "Oh, I'm going to make a cart,

201
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and I'm going to have it --

202
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I'm going to have my hand writing 'faster,'

203
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
so as I run down the street, the cart's going to talk to me

204
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and it's going to go, 'Faster, faster!' "

205
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So, that's what it does.

206
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:16,000
(Laughter)

207
0:12:16.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But then in the end, what I decided

208
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
was every time you finish writing the word,

209
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I would stop and I would give the card to somebody on the side of the road.

210
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So I would never win the race because I'm always stopping.

211
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But I had a lot of fun.

212
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Applause)

213
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Now, I only have two and a half minutes -- I'm going to play this.

214
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
This is a piece that, for me, is in some ways

215
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
the most complete kind of piece.

216
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Because when I was a kid, I also played a lot of guitar.

217
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And when I had this thought,

218
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I was imagining that I would make --

219
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I would have a whole machine theater evening,

220
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
where I would -- you would have an audience,

221
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
the curtain would open, and you'd be entertained by machines on stage.

222
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So, I imagined a very simple gestural dance

223
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that would be between a machine and just a very simple chair, and ...

224
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
When I'm making these pieces, I'm always trying to find a point

225
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
where I'm saying something very clearly and it's very simple,

226
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
but also at the same time it's very ambiguous.

227
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And I think there's a point between simplicity and ambiguity

228
0:13:50.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
which can allow a viewer to perhaps take something from it.

229
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And that leads me to the thought that all of these pieces

230
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
start off in my own mind, in my heart,

231
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and I do my best at finding ways to express them with materials,

232
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and it always feels really crude.

233
0:14:16.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
It's always a struggle,

234
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
but somehow I manage to sort of get this thought

235
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:27,000
out into an object, and then it's there, OK.

236
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
It means nothing at all.

237
0:14:29.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
The object itself just means nothing.

238
0:14:31.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Once it's perceived, and someone brings it into their own mind,

239
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
then there's a cycle that has been completed.

240
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And to me, that's the most important thing

241
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
because, ever since being a kid, I've wanted to communicate my passion and love.

242
0:14:48.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And that means the complete cycle of coming from inside,

243
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
out to the physical, to someone perceiving it.

244
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So I'll just let this chair come down.

245
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Applause)

246
0:15:34.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Thank you.

247
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
(Applause)

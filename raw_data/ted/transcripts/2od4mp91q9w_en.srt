1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
How can we investigate

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
this flora of viruses that surround us, and aid medicine?

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
How can we turn our cumulative knowledge of virology

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
into a simple, hand-held, single diagnostic assay?

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I want to turn everything we know right now about detecting viruses

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and the spectrum of viruses that are out there

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
into, let's say, a small chip.

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
When we started thinking about this project --

9
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
how we would make a single diagnostic assay

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to screen for all pathogens simultaneously --

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
well, there's some problems with this idea.

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
First of all, viruses are pretty complex,

13
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but they're also evolving very fast.

14
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This is a picornavirus.

15
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Picornaviruses -- these are things that include

16
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
the common cold and polio, things like this.

17
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
You're looking at the outside shell of the virus,

18
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and the yellow color here are those parts of the virus

19
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that are evolving very, very fast,

20
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and the blue parts are not evolving very fast.

21
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
When people think about making pan-viral detection reagents,

22
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
usually it's the fast-evolving problem that's an issue,

23
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because how can we detect things if they're always changing?

24
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But evolution is a balance:

25
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
where you have fast change, you also have ultra-conservation --

26
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
things that almost never change.

27
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And so we looked into this a little more carefully,

28
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I'm going to show you data now.

29
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
This is just some stuff you can do on the computer from the desktop.

30
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I took a bunch of these small picornaviruses,

31
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
like the common cold, like polio and so on,

32
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and I just broke them down into small segments.

33
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And so took this first example, which is called coxsackievirus,

34
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and just break it into small windows.

35
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I'm coloring these small windows blue

36
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
if another virus shares an identical sequence in its genome

37
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to that virus.

38
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
These sequences right up here --

39
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
which don't even code for protein, by the way --

40
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
are almost absolutely identical across all of these,

41
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
so I could use this sequence as a marker

42
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to detect a wide spectrum of viruses,

43
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
without having to make something individual.

44
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now, over here there's great diversity:

45
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that's where things are evolving fast.

46
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Down here you can see slower evolution: less diversity.

47
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Now, by the time we get out here to, let's say,

48
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
acute bee paralysis virus --

49
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
probably a bad one to have if you're a bee ---

50
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
this virus shares almost no similarity to coxsackievirus,

51
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but I can guarantee you that the sequences that are most conserved

52
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
among these viruses on the right-hand of the screen

53
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
are in identical regions right up here.

54
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And so we can encapsulate these regions of ultra-conservation

55
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
through evolution -- how these viruses evolved --

56
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
by just choosing DNA elements or RNA elements

57
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in these regions to represent on our chip as detection reagents.

58
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
OK, so that's what we did, but how are we going to do that?

59
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Well, for a long time, since I was in graduate school,

60
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I've been messing around making DNA chips --

61
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that is, printing DNA on glass.

62
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And that's what you see here:

63
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
These little salt spots are just DNA tacked onto glass,

64
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and so I can put thousands of these on our glass chip

65
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and use them as a detection reagent.

66
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We took our chip over to Hewlett-Packard

67
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and used their atomic force microscope on one of these spots,

68
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and this is what you see:

69
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you can actually see the strands of DNA lying flat on the glass here.

70
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So, what we're doing is just printing DNA on glass --

71
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
little flat things -- and these are going to be markers for pathogens.

72
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
OK, I make little robots in lab to make these chips,

73
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and I'm really big on disseminating technology.

74
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
If you've got enough money to buy just a Camry,

75
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
you can build one of these too,

76
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and so we put a deep how-to guide on the Web, totally free,

77
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
with basically order-off-the-shelf parts.

78
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
You can build a DNA array machine in your garage.

79
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Here's the section on the all-important emergency stop switch.

80
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Every important machine's got to have a big red button.

82
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But really, it's pretty robust.

83
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
You can actually be making DNA chips in your garage

84
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and decoding some genetic programs pretty rapidly. It's a lot of fun.

85
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And so what we did -- and this is a really cool project --

87
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we just started by making a respiratory virus chip.

88
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I talked about that --

89
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
you know, that situation where you go into the clinic

90
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and you don't get diagnosed?

91
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Well, we just put basically all the human respiratory viruses

92
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
on one chip, and we threw in herpes virus for good measure --

93
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I mean, why not?

94
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The first thing you do as a scientist is,

95
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you make sure stuff works.

96
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And so what we did is, we take tissue culture cells

97
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and infect them with various viruses,

98
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and we take the stuff and fluorescently label the nucleic acid,

99
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
the genetic material that comes out of these tissue culture cells --

100
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
mostly viral stuff -- and stick it on the array to see where it sticks.

101
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now, if the DNA sequences match, they'll stick together,

102
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and so we can look at spots.

103
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And if spots light up, we know there's a certain virus in there.

104
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
That's what one of these chips really looks like,

105
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and these red spots are, in fact, signals coming from the virus.

106
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And each spot represents a different family of virus

107
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
or species of virus.

108
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And so, that's a hard way to look at things,

109
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
so I'm just going to encode things as a little barcode,

110
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
grouped by family, so you can see the results in a very intuitive way.

111
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
What we did is, we took tissue culture cells

112
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and infected them with adenovirus,

113
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and you can see this little yellow barcode next to adenovirus.

114
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And, likewise, we infected them with parainfluenza-3 --

115
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that's a paramyxovirus -- and you see a little barcode here.

116
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And then we did respiratory syncytial virus.

117
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
That's the scourge of daycare centers everywhere --

118
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
it's like boogeremia, basically.

119
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You can see that this barcode is the same family,

121
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but it's distinct from parainfluenza-3,

122
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
which gives you a very bad cold.

123
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And so we're getting unique signatures, a fingerprint for each virus.

124
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Polio and rhino: they're in the same family, very close to each other.

125
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Rhino's the common cold, and you all know what polio is,

126
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and you can see that these signatures are distinct.

127
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpes virus

128
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
gives a nice signature down here.

129
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And so it is not any one stripe or something

130
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that tells me I have a virus of a particular type here;

131
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
it's the barcode that in bulk represents the whole thing.

132
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
All right, I can see a rhinovirus --

133
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and here's the blow-up of the rhinovirus's little barcode --

134
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but what about different rhinoviruses?

135
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
How do I know which rhinovirus I have?

136
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
There're 102 known variants of the common cold,

137
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and there're only 102 because people got bored collecting them:

138
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
there are just new ones every year.

139
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And so, here are four different rhinoviruses,

140
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and you can see, even with your eye,

141
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
without any fancy computer pattern-matching

142
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
recognition software algorithms,

143
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that you can distinguish each one of these barcodes from each other.

144
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Now, this is kind of a cheap shot,

145
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because I know what the genetic sequence of all these rhinoviruses is,

146
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and I in fact designed the chip

147
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
expressly to be able to tell them apart,

148
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but what about rhinoviruses that have never seen a genetic sequencer?

149
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We don't know what the sequence is; just pull them out of the field.

150
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So, here are four rhinoviruses

151
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we never knew anything about --

152
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
no one's ever sequenced them -- and you can also see

153
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that you get unique and distinguishable patterns.

154
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
You can imagine building up some library, whether real or virtual,

155
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
of fingerprints of essentially every virus.

156
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But that's, again, shooting fish in a barrel, you know, right?

157
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
You have tissue culture cells. There are a ton of viruses.

158
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
What about real people?

159
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
You can't control real people, as you probably know.

160
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
You have no idea what someone's going to cough into a cup,

161
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and it's probably really complex, right?

162
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It could have lots of bacteria, it could have more than one virus,

163
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and it certainly has host genetic material.

164
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So how do we deal with this?

165
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And how do we do the positive control here?

166
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Well, it's pretty simple.

167
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
That's me, getting a nasal lavage.

168
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And the idea is, let's experimentally inoculate people with virus.

169
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
This is all IRB-approved, by the way; they got paid.

170
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And basically we experimentally inoculate people

171
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
with the common cold virus.

172
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Or, even better, let's just take people

173
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
right out of the emergency room --

174
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
undefined, community-acquired respiratory tract infections.

175
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
You have no idea what walks in through the door.

176
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So, let's start off with the positive control first,

177
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
where we know the person was healthy.

178
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They got a shot of virus up the nose,

179
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
let's see what happens.

180
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Day zero: nothing happening.

181
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
They're healthy; they're clean -- it's amazing.

182
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Actually, we thought the nasal tract might be full of viruses

183
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
even when you're walking around healthy.

184
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
It's pretty clean. If you're healthy, you're pretty healthy.

185
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Day two: we get a very robust rhinovirus pattern,

186
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and it's very similar to what we get in the lab

187
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
doing our tissue culture experiment.

188
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So that's great, but again, cheap shot, right?

189
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We put a ton of virus up this guy's nose. So --

190
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Laughter)

191
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
-- I mean, we wanted it to work. He really had a cold.

192
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So, how about the people who walk in off the street?

193
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Here are two individuals represented by their anonymous ID codes.

194
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
They both have rhinoviruses; we've never seen this pattern in lab.

195
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We sequenced part of their viruses;

196
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
they're new rhinoviruses no one's actually even seen.

197
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Remember, our evolutionary-conserved sequences

198
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
we're using on this array allow us to detect

199
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
even novel or uncharacterized viruses,

200
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
because we pick what is conserved throughout evolution.

201
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Here's another guy. You can play the diagnosis game yourself here.

202
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
These different blocks represent

203
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
the different viruses in this paramyxovirus family,

204
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
so you can kind of go down the blocks

205
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and see where the signal is.

206
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Well, doesn't have canine distemper; that's probably good.

207
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Laughter)

208
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But by the time you get to block nine,

209
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
you see that respiratory syncytial virus.

210
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Maybe they have kids. And then you can see, also,

211
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the family member that's related: RSVB is showing up here.

212
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So, that's great.

213
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Here's another individual, sampled on two separate days --

214
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
repeat visits to the clinic.

215
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
This individual has parainfluenza-1,

216
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and you can see that there's a little stripe over here

217
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
for Sendai virus: that's mouse parainfluenza.

218
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
The genetic relationships are very close there. That's a lot of fun.

219
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So, we built out the chip.

220
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
We made a chip that has every known virus ever discovered on it.

221
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Why not? Every plant virus, every insect virus, every marine virus.

222
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Everything that we could get out of GenBank --

223
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that is, the national repository of sequences.

224
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Now we're using this chip. And what are we using it for?

225
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Well, first of all, when you have a big chip like this,

226
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
you need a little bit more informatics,

227
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
so we designed the system to do automatic diagnosis.

228
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And the idea is that we simply have virtual patterns,

229
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
because we're never going to get samples of every virus --

230
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
it would be virtually impossible. But we can get virtual patterns,

231
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and compare them to our observed result --

232
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
which is a very complex mixture -- and come up with some sort of score

233
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
of how likely it is this is a rhinovirus or something.

234
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And this is what this looks like.

235
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
If, for example, you used a cell culture

236
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
that's chronically infected with papilloma,

237
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
you get a little computer readout here,

238
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and our algorithm says it's probably papilloma type 18.

239
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And that is, in fact, what these particular cell cultures

240
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
are chronically infected with.

241
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So let's do something a little bit harder.

242
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We put the beeper in the clinic.

243
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
When somebody shows up, and the hospital doesn't know what to do

244
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
because they can't diagnose it, they call us.

245
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
That's the idea, and we're setting this up in the Bay Area.

246
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And so, this case report happened three weeks ago.

247
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We have a 28-year-old healthy woman, no travel history,

248
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
[unclear], doesn't smoke, doesn't drink.

249
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
10-day history of fevers, night sweats, bloody sputum --

250
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
she's coughing up blood -- muscle pain.

251
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
She went to the clinic, and they gave her antibiotics

252
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and then sent her home.

253
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
She came back after ten days of fever, right? Still has the fever,

254
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and she's hypoxic -- she doesn't have much oxygen in her lungs.

255
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
They did a CT scan.

256
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
A normal lung is all sort of dark and black here.

257
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
All this white stuff -- it's not good.

258
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This sort of tree and bud formation indicates there's inflammation;

259
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
there's likely to be infection.

260
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
OK. So, the patient was treated then

261
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
with a third-generation cephalosporin antibiotic and doxycycline,

262
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and on day three, it didn't help: she had progressed to acute failure.

263
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
They had to intubate her, so they put a tube down her throat

264
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and they began to mechanically ventilate her.

265
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
She could no longer breathe for herself.

266
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
What to do next? Don't know.

267
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Switch antibiotics: so they switched to another antibiotic,

268
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Tamiflu.

269
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It's not clear why they thought she had the flu,

270
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but they switched to Tamiflu.

271
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And on day six, they basically threw in the towel.

272
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
You do an open lung biopsy when you've got no other options.

273
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
There's an eight percent mortality rate with just doing this procedure,

274
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and so basically -- and what do they learn from it?

275
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
You're looking at her open lung biopsy.

276
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And I'm no pathologist, but you can't tell much from this.

277
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
All you can tell is, there's a lot of swelling: bronchiolitis.

278
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
It was "unrevealing": that's the pathologist's report.

279
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And so, what did they test her for?

280
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
They have their own tests, of course,

281
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and so they tested her for over 70 different assays,

282
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
for every sort of bacteria and fungus and viral assay

283
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
you can buy off the shelf:

284
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
SARS, metapneumovirus, HIV, RSV -- all these.

285
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Everything came back negative, over 100,000 dollars worth of tests.

286
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I mean, they went to the max for this woman.

287
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And basically on hospital day eight, that's when they called us.

288
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
They gave us endotracheal aspirate --

289
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
you know, a little fluid from the throat,

290
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
from this tube that they got down there -- and they gave us this.

291
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We put it on the chip; what do we see? Well, we saw parainfluenza-4.

292
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Well, what the hell's parainfluenza-4?

293
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
No one tests for parainfluenza-4. No one cares about it.

294
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
In fact, it's not even really sequenced that much.

295
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
There's just a little bit of it sequenced.

296
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
There's almost no epidemiology or studies on it.

297
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
No one would even consider it,

298
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
because no one had a clue that it could cause respiratory failure.

299
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And why is that? Just lore. There's no data --

300
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
no data to support whether it causes severe or mild disease.

301
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Clearly, we have a case of a healthy person that's going down.

302
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
OK, that's one case report.

303
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I'm going to tell you one last thing in the last two minutes

304
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that's unpublished -- it's going to come out tomorrow --

305
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and it's an interesting case of how you might use this chip

306
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
to find something new and open a new door.

307
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Prostate cancer. I don't need to give you many statistics

308
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
about prostate cancer. Most of you already know it:

309
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S.

310
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Lots of risk factors,

311
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
but there is a genetic predisposition to prostate cancer.

312
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
For maybe about 10 percent of prostate cancer,

313
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
there are folks that are predisposed to it.

314
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And the first gene that was mapped in association studies

315
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
for this, early-onset prostate cancer, was this gene called RNASEL.

316
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
What is that? It's an antiviral defense enzyme.

317
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So, we're sitting around and thinking,

318
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
"Why would men who have the mutation --

319
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
a defect in an antiviral defense system -- get prostate cancer?

320
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It doesn't make sense -- unless, maybe, there's a virus?"

321
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
So, we put tumors --- and now we have over 100 tumors -- on our array.

322
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And we know who's got defects in RNASEL and who doesn't.

323
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And I'm showing you the signal from the chip here,

324
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and I'm showing you for the block of retroviral oligos.

325
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And what I'm telling you here from the signal, is

326
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
that men who have a mutation in this antiviral defense enzyme,

327
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and have a tumor, often have -- 40 percent of the time --

328
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
a signature which reveals a new retrovirus.

329
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
OK, that's pretty wild. What is it?

330
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
So, we clone the whole virus.

331
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
First of all, I'll tell you that a little automated prediction told us

332
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
it was very similar to a mouse virus.

333
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
But that doesn't tell us too much,

334
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
so we actually clone the whole thing.

335
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
And the viral genome I'm showing you right here?

336
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It's a classic gamma retrovirus, but it's totally new;

337
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
no one's ever seen it before.

338
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Its closest relative is, in fact, from mice,

339
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and so we would call this a xenotropic retrovirus,

340
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
because it's infecting a species other than mice.

341
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And this is a little phylogenetic tree

342
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
to see how it's related to other viruses.

343
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We've done it for many patients now,

344
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and we can say that they're all independent infections.

345
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
They all have the same virus,

346
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
but they're different enough that there's reason to believe

347
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
that they've been independently acquired.

348
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Is it really in the tissue? And I'll end up with this: yes.

349
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
We take slices of these biopsies of tumor tissue

350
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and use material to actually locate the virus,

351
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and we find cells here with viral particles in them.

352
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
These guys really do have this virus.

353
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
Does this virus cause prostate cancer?

354
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Nothing I'm saying here implies causality. I don't know.

355
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Is it a link to oncogenesis? I don't know.

356
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Is it the case that these guys are just more susceptible to viruses?

357
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Could be. And it might have nothing to do with cancer.

358
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
But now it's a door.

359
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
We have a strong association between the presence of this virus

360
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and a genetic mutation that's been linked to cancer.

361
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
That's where we're at.

362
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
So, it opens up more questions than it answers, I'm afraid,

363
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
but that's what, you know, science is really good at.

364
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
This was all done by folks in the lab --

365
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
I cannot take credit for most of this.

366
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
This is a collaboration between myself and Don.

367
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
This is the guy who started the project in my lab,

368
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and this is the guy who's been doing prostate stuff.

369
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

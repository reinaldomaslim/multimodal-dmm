1
0:00:12.901,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The informal markets of Africa are stereotypically seen

2
0:00:16.856,000 --> 0:00:17,000
as chaotic and lackadaisical.

3
0:00:19.234,000 --> 0:00:21,000
The downside of hearing the word "informal"

4
0:00:21.911,000 --> 0:00:23,000
is this automatic grand association we have,

5
0:00:24.604,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which is very negative,

6
0:00:26.254,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and it's had significant consequences and economic losses,

7
0:00:30.787,000 --> 0:00:35,000
easily adding -- or subtracting -- 40 to 60 percent of the profit margin

8
0:00:36.297,000 --> 0:00:38,000
for the informal markets alone.

9
0:00:39.157,000 --> 0:00:43,000
As part of a task of mapping the informal trade ecosystem,

10
0:00:43.483,000 --> 0:00:45,000
we've done an extensive literature review

11
0:00:46.04,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of all the reports and research on cross-border trade in East Africa,

12
0:00:51.015,000 --> 0:00:52,000
going back 20 years.

13
0:00:52.85,000 --> 0:00:56,000
This was to prepare us for fieldwork to understand what was the problem,

14
0:00:57.208,000 --> 0:01:01,000
what was holding back informal trade in the informal sector.

15
0:01:01.99,000 --> 0:01:04,000
What we discovered over the last 20 years was,

16
0:01:05.518,000 --> 0:01:08,000
nobody had distinguished between illicit --

17
0:01:09.295,000 --> 0:01:13,000
which is like smuggling or contraband in the informal sector --

18
0:01:13.764,000 --> 0:01:15,000
from the legal but unrecorded,

19
0:01:16.128,000 --> 0:01:19,000
such as tomatoes, oranges, fruit.

20
0:01:19.697,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This criminalization --

21
0:01:22.041,000 --> 0:01:27,000
what in Swahili refers to as "biashara," which is the trade or the commerce,

22
0:01:27.263,000 --> 0:01:3,000
versus "magendo," which is the smuggling or contraband --

23
0:01:30.721,000 --> 0:01:33,000
this criminalization of the informal sector,

24
0:01:34.266,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in English, by not distinguishing between these aspects,

25
0:01:38.159,000 --> 0:01:43,000
easily can cost each African economy between 60 to 80 percent addition

26
0:01:43.776,000 --> 0:01:45,000
on the annual GDP growth rate,

27
0:01:46.568,000 --> 0:01:49,000
because we are not recognizing the engine

28
0:01:50.326,000 --> 0:01:52,000
of what keeps the economies running.

29
0:01:52.924,000 --> 0:01:55,000
The informal sector is growing jobs at four times the rate

30
0:01:56.425,000 --> 0:01:57,000
of the traditional formal economy,

31
0:01:58.391,000 --> 0:02:,000
or "modern" economy, as many call it.

32
0:02:00.972,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It offers employment and income generation opportunities

33
0:02:04.462,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to the most "unskilled" in conventional disciplines.

34
0:02:08.183,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But can you make a french fry machine out of an old car?

35
0:02:12.403,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So, this, ladies and gentlemen,

36
0:02:15.888,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is what so desperately needs to be recognized.

37
0:02:19.128,000 --> 0:02:23,000
As long as the current assumptions hold that this is criminal,

38
0:02:23.41,000 --> 0:02:24,000
this is shadow,

39
0:02:24.661,000 --> 0:02:25,000
this is illegal,

40
0:02:26.303,000 --> 0:02:3,000
there will be no attempt at integrating the informal economic ecosystem

41
0:02:30.787,000 --> 0:02:32,000
with the formal or even the global one.

42
0:02:34.968,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I'm going to tell you a story of Teresia,

43
0:02:37.796,000 --> 0:02:41,000
a trader who overturned all our assumptions,

44
0:02:41.896,000 --> 0:02:44,000
made us question all the stereotypes that we'd gone in on,

45
0:02:45.27,000 --> 0:02:47,000
based on 20 years of literature review.

46
0:02:49.675,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Teresia sells clothes under a tree in a town called Malaba,

47
0:02:55.188,000 --> 0:02:57,000
on the border of Uganda and Kenya.

48
0:02:57.876,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You think it's very simple, don't you?

49
0:03:00.81,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We'll go hang up new clothes from the branches,

50
0:03:03.491,000 --> 0:03:05,000
put out the tarp, settle down, wait for customers,

51
0:03:06.447,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and there we have it.

52
0:03:07.816,000 --> 0:03:1,000
She was everything we were expecting according to the literature,

53
0:03:11.225,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to the research,

54
0:03:12.517,000 --> 0:03:15,000
right down to she was a single mom driven to trade,

55
0:03:16.318,000 --> 0:03:17,000
supporting her kids.

56
0:03:19.092,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So what overturned our assumptions?

57
0:03:21.726,000 --> 0:03:22,000
What surprised us?

58
0:03:23.269,000 --> 0:03:26,000
First, Teresia paid the county government market fees

59
0:03:27.015,000 --> 0:03:28,000
every single working day

60
0:03:28.87,000 --> 0:03:31,000
for the privilege of setting up shop under her tree.

61
0:03:32.147,000 --> 0:03:34,000
She's been doing it for seven years,

62
0:03:34.222,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and she's been getting receipts.

63
0:03:36.56,000 --> 0:03:37,000
She keeps records.

64
0:03:38.061,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We're seeing not a marginal,

65
0:03:41.252,000 --> 0:03:42,000
underprivileged,

66
0:03:42.623,000 --> 0:03:47,000
vulnerable African woman trader by the side of the road -- no.

67
0:03:48.463,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We were seeing somebody who's keeping sales records for years;

68
0:03:52.586,000 --> 0:03:58,000
somebody who had an entire ecosystem of retail that comes in from Uganda

69
0:03:58.931,000 --> 0:04:,000
to pick up inventory;

70
0:04:01.27,000 --> 0:04:04,000
someone who's got handcarts bringing the goods in,

71
0:04:05.156,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or the mobile money agent who comes to collect cash

72
0:04:08.096,000 --> 0:04:09,000
at the end of the evening.

73
0:04:09.548,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Can you guess how much Teresia spends, on average,

74
0:04:13.98,000 --> 0:04:15,000
each month on inventory --

75
0:04:16.601,000 --> 0:04:18,000
stocks of new clothes that she gets from Nairobi?

76
0:04:19.819,000 --> 0:04:21,000
One thousand five hundred US dollars.

77
0:04:22.525,000 --> 0:04:27,000
That's around 20,000 US dollars invested in trade goods and services

78
0:04:27.989,000 --> 0:04:28,000
every year.

79
0:04:29.568,000 --> 0:04:3,000
This is Teresia,

80
0:04:31.042,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the invisible one,

81
0:04:32.463,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the hidden middle.

82
0:04:34.442,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And she's only the first rung of the small entrepreneurs,

83
0:04:38.559,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the micro-businesses that can be found in these market towns.

84
0:04:42.674,000 --> 0:04:46,000
At least in the larger Malaba border, she's at the first rung.

85
0:04:48.523,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The people further up the value chain

86
0:04:51.183,000 --> 0:04:54,000
are easily running three lines of business,

87
0:04:54.252,000 --> 0:04:59,000
investing 2,500 to 3,000 US dollars every month.

88
0:04:59.772,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So the problem turned out that it wasn't the criminalization;

89
0:05:03.776,000 --> 0:05:07,000
you can't really criminalize someone you're charging receipts from.

90
0:05:08.957,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's the lack of recognition of their skilled occupations.

91
0:05:15.048,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The bank systems and structures have no means to recognize them

92
0:05:19.068,000 --> 0:05:2,000
as micro-businesses,

93
0:05:20.58,000 --> 0:05:22,000
much less the fact that, you know,

94
0:05:23.182,000 --> 0:05:25,000
her tree doesn't have a forwarding address.

95
0:05:25.912,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So she's trapped in the middle.

96
0:05:28.262,000 --> 0:05:3,000
She's falling through the cracks of our assumptions.

97
0:05:30.717,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You know all those microloans to help African women traders?

98
0:05:34.646,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They're going to loan her 50 dollars or 100 dollars.

99
0:05:37.5,000 --> 0:05:38,000
What's she going to do with it?

100
0:05:39.13,000 --> 0:05:41,000
She spends 10 times that amount every month

101
0:05:41.496,000 --> 0:05:42,000
just on inventory --

102
0:05:43.122,000 --> 0:05:45,000
we're not talking about the additional services

103
0:05:45.433,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or the support ecosystem.

104
0:05:47.864,000 --> 0:05:5,000
These are the ones who fit neither the policy stereotype

105
0:05:51.476,000 --> 0:05:53,000
of the low-skilled and the marginalized,

106
0:05:53.904,000 --> 0:05:55,000
nor the white-collar, salaried office worker

107
0:05:56.799,000 --> 0:05:57,000
or civil servant with a pension

108
0:05:58.684,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that the middle classes are allegedly composed of.

109
0:06:02.08,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Instead, what we have here are the proto-SMEs

110
0:06:06.656,000 --> 0:06:09,000
these are the fertile seeds of businesses and enterprises

111
0:06:10.475,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that keep the engines running.

112
0:06:12.442,000 --> 0:06:13,000
They put food on your table.

113
0:06:14.201,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Even here in this hotel, the invisible ones --

114
0:06:17.298,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the butchers, the bakers the candlestick makers --

115
0:06:20.774,000 --> 0:06:22,000
they make the machines that make your french fries

116
0:06:23.191,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and they make your beds.

117
0:06:24.441,000 --> 0:06:27,000
These are the invisible businesswomen trading across borders,

118
0:06:29.037,000 --> 0:06:31,000
all on the side of the road,

119
0:06:31.43,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and so they're invisible to data gatherers.

120
0:06:34.704,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And they're mashed together with the vast informal sector

121
0:06:38.384,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that doesn't bother to distinguish between smugglers and tax evaders

122
0:06:43.481,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and those running illegal whatnot,

123
0:06:46.113,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and the ladies who trade,

124
0:06:48.168,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and who put food on the table and send their kids to university.

125
0:06:52.337,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So that's really what I'm asking here.

126
0:06:55.586,000 --> 0:06:57,000
That's all that we need to start by doing.

127
0:06:58.868,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Can we start by recognizing the skills, the occupations?

128
0:07:03.501,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We could transform the informal economy by beginning with this recognition

129
0:07:08.149,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and then designing the customized doorways for them to enter

130
0:07:12.854,000 --> 0:07:14,000
or integrate with the formal,

131
0:07:15.087,000 --> 0:07:16,000
with the global,

132
0:07:16.415,000 --> 0:07:17,000
with the entire system.

133
0:07:18.15,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

134
0:07:19.738,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Applause)

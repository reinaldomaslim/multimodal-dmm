1
0:00:18.861,000 --> 0:00:19,000
By day, I'm a venture capitalist.

2
0:00:20.489,000 --> 0:00:21,000
On weekends, I love rockets.

3
0:00:22.06,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I love photography, I love rockets.

4
0:00:23.833,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I'm going to talk about a hobby that can scale

5
0:00:26.015,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and show you photos I've taken over the years

6
0:00:28.147,000 --> 0:00:31,000
with kids like these, that hopefully will grow up to love rocketry

7
0:00:31.276,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and eventually become a Richard Branson or Diamandis.

8
0:00:33.798,000 --> 0:00:36,000
My son designed a rocket that became stable, a golf ball rocket.

9
0:00:36.831,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I thought it was quite an interesting experiment

10
0:00:39.108,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in the principles of rocket science.

11
0:00:40.874,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And it flies straight as an arrow.

12
0:00:42.624,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Baking soda and vinegar.

13
0:00:44.001,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Night shots are beautiful,

14
0:00:45.335,000 --> 0:00:48,000
piercing the Big Dipper and the Milky Way.

15
0:00:48.886,000 --> 0:00:5,000
2-stage rockets with video cameras on them,

16
0:00:51.109,000 --> 0:00:54,000
onboard computers logging their flights, rocket gliders that fly back to Earth.

17
0:00:54.911,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I use RockSim to simulate flights before they go

18
0:00:57.178,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to see if they'll break supersonic,

19
0:00:58.877,000 --> 0:01:,000
then fly them with onboard computers to verify performance.

20
0:01:01.722,000 --> 0:01:03,000
To launch the big stuff, you go to the middle of nowhere:

21
0:01:04.423,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Black Rock Desert, where dangerous things happen.

22
0:01:06.782,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The boys and the rockets get bigger.

23
0:01:08.545,000 --> 0:01:1,000
They use motors used on cruise-missile boosters.

24
0:01:11.18,000 --> 0:01:13,000
They rumble the belly and leave even photographers in awe,

25
0:01:13.933,000 --> 0:01:14,000
watching the spectacle.

26
0:01:15.108,000 --> 0:01:17,000
These rockets use experimental motors like nitrous oxide.

27
0:01:17.918,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They use solid propellant most frequently.

28
0:01:19.943,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It's a strange kind of love.

29
0:01:21.306,000 --> 0:01:24,000
RocketMavericks.com with my photos, if you want to learn about this,

30
0:01:24.538,000 --> 0:01:25,000
participate, be a spectator.

31
0:01:25.898,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We had to call it Rocket Mavericks.

32
0:01:27.899,000 --> 0:01:29,000
This one was great, went to 100,000 feet -- but didn't quite.

33
0:01:30.797,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Actually, it went 11 feet into solid clay and became a bunker-buster.

34
0:01:34.098,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It had to be dug out.

35
0:01:35.546,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Rockets often spiral out of control if you put too much propellant in them.

36
0:01:39.322,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Here was a drag race.

37
0:01:40.505,000 --> 0:01:42,000
At night you can see what happened in a second;

38
0:01:42.769,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in daytime, we call them land sharks.

39
0:01:44.565,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic.

40
0:01:47.876,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

41
0:01:48.909,000 --> 0:01:51,000
To take this shot, I did what I often do, which is go way beyond the pads,

42
0:01:52.41,000 --> 0:01:53,000
where none of the spectators are.

43
0:01:54.034,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And if we can run the video, I'll show you what it took

44
0:01:56.638,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to get this DreamWorks shot.

45
0:01:58.69,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Video) Voices: Woo-hoo! Yeah. Nice.

46
0:02:00.69,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Steve Jurvetson: They realize the computer failed, they're yelling "Deploy!"

47
0:02:04.6,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Video) Man: Oh, shit.

48
0:02:05.775,000 --> 0:02:07,000
SJ: This is when they realize everything's gone haywire.

49
0:02:08.428,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Video) Man: It's going ballistic.

50
0:02:10.073,000 --> 0:02:11,000
SJ: I'll just be quiet.

51
0:02:11.248,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Video) Woman: No!

52
0:02:12.423,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Come on, come on, come on.

53
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
SJ: And that's me over there, taking photos the whole way.

54
0:02:22.321,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Things often go wrong.

55
0:02:23.496,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Some people watch this because of a NASCAR-like fascination

56
0:02:26.793,000 --> 0:02:27,000
with things bumping and grinding.

57
0:02:28.452,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Burning the parachute as it fell. That was last weekend.

58
0:02:31.193,000 --> 0:02:33,000
This guy went up, went supersonic, ripped the fin can off.

59
0:02:33.947,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The art sale in the sky.

60
0:02:35.122,000 --> 0:02:36,000
A burning metal hunk coming back.

61
0:02:36.725,000 --> 0:02:38,000
These things dropped down from above all through the weekend

62
0:02:39.567,000 --> 0:02:4,000
of rocket launch after rocket launch.

63
0:02:41.381,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It's a cadence you can't quite imagine.

64
0:02:43.299,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I try to capture the mishaps; it's a challenge in photography

65
0:02:46.199,000 --> 0:02:48,000
when these things take place in a fraction of a second.

66
0:02:48.817,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Why do it? For things like this:

67
0:02:50.372,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Gene from Alabama drives out there

68
0:02:52.543,000 --> 0:02:55,000
with this rocket he's built with X-ray sensors, video cameras,

69
0:02:55.639,000 --> 0:02:56,000
festooned with electronics.

70
0:02:56.954,000 --> 0:02:57,000
He succeeds getting to 100,000 feet,

71
0:02:58.699,000 --> 0:03:,000
leaving the atmosphere, seeing a thin blue line of space.

72
0:03:01.403,000 --> 0:03:04,000
It is this breathtaking image -- success, of course -- that motivates us

73
0:03:04.819,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and motivates kids to follow and understand rocket science,

74
0:03:07.63,000 --> 0:03:09,000
understand the importance of physics and math

75
0:03:09.758,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and, in many ways, to have that awe at exploration

76
0:03:12.117,000 --> 0:03:13,000
of the frontiers of the unknown.

77
0:03:13.675,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Thank you.

78
0:03:14.85,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Applause)

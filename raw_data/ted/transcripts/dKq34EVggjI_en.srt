1
0:00:13.44,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The world needs bridges.

2
0:00:17.92,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Have you ever thought about what it would be like not to have any?

3
0:00:21.88,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's hard to imagine a civilization without bridges

4
0:00:25.04,000 --> 0:00:26,000
because they're so essential

5
0:00:26.44,000 --> 0:00:28,000
for growth and development of human society,

6
0:00:29.2,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but they're not just about a safe way across a river or an obstacle.

7
0:00:35.72,000 --> 0:00:38,000
They shout about connectivity --

8
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:4,000
community.

9
0:00:40.96,000 --> 0:00:41,000
They reveal something about creativity,

10
0:00:42.88,000 --> 0:00:43,000
our ingenuity --

11
0:00:44.119,000 --> 0:00:46,000
they even hint at our identity.

12
0:00:49.24,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And when bridges fail,

13
0:00:51.52,000 --> 0:00:52,000
or are destroyed in conflict,

14
0:00:53.44,000 --> 0:00:54,000
communities struggle,

15
0:00:55.24,000 --> 0:00:57,000
development stagnates, people suffer.

16
0:00:59.28,000 --> 0:01:,000
Even today,

17
0:01:01.12,000 --> 0:01:04,000
there are over one billion people living in poor, rural communities

18
0:01:05.04,000 --> 0:01:06,000
around the world

19
0:01:06.28,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that do not have safe, year-round access

20
0:01:08.24,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to the things that you and I take for granted:

21
0:01:10.72,000 --> 0:01:12,000
education, medical care, access to markets ...

22
0:01:14.96,000 --> 0:01:17,000
which is why wonderful organizations like Bridges to Prosperity

23
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
build bridges in this kind of place -- this is in Rwanda.

24
0:01:21.24,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And they make such a difference,

25
0:01:23.64,000 --> 0:01:26,000
not only to those lives immediately around the bridge,

26
0:01:26.8,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but the impact of these bridges is huge,

27
0:01:28.79,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and it spreads over the whole community,

28
0:01:31.28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
far, far away.

29
0:01:34.04,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Of course bridges have been around for an awfully long time.

30
0:01:37.24,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The oldest ones are stone because it's a very durable material.

31
0:01:41.2,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I don't know about you --

32
0:01:42.48,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I love to look at the development of technology

33
0:01:44.72,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to learn about what people did with the materials

34
0:01:47.08,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and tools available to them at the time.

35
0:01:50.2,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So the Pont Du Gard in the center is a wonderful example --

36
0:01:53.04,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Roman aqueduct in the South of France --

37
0:01:55.4,000 --> 0:01:58,000
fantastic piece of technology built using massive stones put together,

38
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
dry -- there's no mortar in those joints.

39
0:02:01.4,000 --> 0:02:02,000
They're just dry stone joints --

40
0:02:03.36,000 --> 0:02:04,000
fantastic

41
0:02:04.6,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and almost as good as new today.

42
0:02:08.36,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Or sometimes up in the mountains,

43
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:12,000
people would build these suspension bridges,

44
0:02:12.88,000 --> 0:02:13,000
often across some dizzy canyon,

45
0:02:14.68,000 --> 0:02:15,000
using a vine.

46
0:02:15.92,000 --> 0:02:16,000
In this case, this is in Peru.

47
0:02:17.48,000 --> 0:02:19,000
This is using grass which grows locally

48
0:02:19.84,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and is woven into ropes to build these bridges.

49
0:02:22.08,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And do you know they rebuild this every year?

50
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Because of course grass is not a durable material.

51
0:02:29.6,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So this bridge is unchanged since Inca times.

52
0:02:34.72,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And bridges can be symbols of their location.

53
0:02:38.4,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Of course, Golden Gate and Sydney are well familiar.

54
0:02:40.88,000 --> 0:02:43,000
In Mostar the bridge was synonymous with the name of the place,

55
0:02:44.44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and to such an extent that in the war in 1993

56
0:02:47.96,000 --> 0:02:48,000
when the bridge was destroyed,

57
0:02:49.44,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the town all but lost its identity until the bridge was reconstructed.

58
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And bridges are enormous features in our landscape --

59
0:02:57.6,000 --> 0:02:59,000
not just enormous, sometimes there's small ones --

60
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and they are really significant features,

61
0:03:02.72,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and I believe we have a duty to make our bridges beautiful.

62
0:03:08.32,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Thankfully, many people do.

63
0:03:09.68,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Think of the stunning Millau Viaduct in the South of France.

64
0:03:13.6,000 --> 0:03:16,000
French engineer Michel Virlogeux and British architect Lord Foster

65
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
collaborated together to produce something

66
0:03:19.24,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which is a really spectacular synergy of architecture and engineering.

67
0:03:22.96,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Or Robert Maillart's Salginatobel Bridge in the mountains in Switzerland --

68
0:03:27.48,000 --> 0:03:28,000
absolutely sublime.

69
0:03:29.88,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Or more recently,

70
0:03:31.12,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Laurent Ney's beautiful and rather delicate bridge

71
0:03:34.2,000 --> 0:03:35,000
for Tintagel Castle in the UK.

72
0:03:37.52,000 --> 0:03:39,000
These are spectacular and beautiful designs

73
0:03:39.76,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and we need to see more of this.

74
0:03:43.04,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Bridges can be considered in three convenient categories,

75
0:03:48.8,000 --> 0:03:5,000
depending on the nature of the structural system

76
0:03:51.32,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that they adopt as their principal support.

77
0:03:54.24,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So, bending, of course, is the way a beam will behave --

78
0:03:57.4,000 --> 0:03:58,000
so, beams and bending.

79
0:03:59.88,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Or compression is the principal way of operating for an arch.

80
0:04:04.72,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Or for the really long spans you need to go lightweight,

81
0:04:07.4,000 --> 0:04:08,000
as we'll see in a minute,

82
0:04:08.76,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and you'll use tension, cables --

83
0:04:11.44,000 --> 0:04:12,000
suspension bridges.

84
0:04:12.92,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And the opportunity for variety is enormous.

85
0:04:16.4,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Engineers have a fantastic scope for innovation and ingenuity

86
0:04:19.64,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and developing different forms around these types.

87
0:04:25.52,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But technological change happens relatively slowly in my world,

88
0:04:29.24,000 --> 0:04:3,000
believe it or not,

89
0:04:30.48,000 --> 0:04:34,000
compared to the changes that happen in mobile phone technology

90
0:04:35.04,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and computers and digital technologies and so on.

91
0:04:37.4,000 --> 0:04:39,000
In our world of construction,

92
0:04:39.68,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the changes seem positively glacial.

93
0:04:44.04,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And the reason for this can be summarized in one word:

94
0:04:48.04,000 --> 0:04:49,000
risk.

95
0:04:50.68,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Structural engineers like me manage risk.

96
0:04:52.72,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We are responsible for structural safety.

97
0:04:54.72,000 --> 0:04:55,000
That's what we do.

98
0:04:55.96,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And when we design bridges like these,

99
0:04:57.84,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I have to balance the probability that loads will be excessive on one side

100
0:05:02.76,000 --> 0:05:05,000
or the strength will be too low on the other side.

101
0:05:05.92,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Both of which, incidentally, are full of uncertainty usually,

102
0:05:09.71,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and so it's a probabilistic problem,

103
0:05:11.49,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and we have to make sure

104
0:05:12.72,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that there's an adequate margin for safety between the two, of course.

105
0:05:16.08,000 --> 0:05:18,000
There's no such thing, I have to tell you,

106
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
as absolute safety.

107
0:05:19.44,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Contrary to popular belief,

108
0:05:21.84,000 --> 0:05:22,000
zero risk doesn't exist.

109
0:05:25.72,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Engineers have to do their calculations and get their sums right

110
0:05:28.8,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to make sure that those margins are there,

111
0:05:30.88,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and society expects them to do so,

112
0:05:32.56,000 --> 0:05:35,000
which is why it's all the more alarming when things like this happen.

113
0:05:39.08,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I'm not going to go into the reasons for these tragedies,

114
0:05:42.84,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but they are part of the reason

115
0:05:45.2,000 --> 0:05:47,000
why technological change happens quite slowly.

116
0:05:47.6,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Nobody wants this to happen.

117
0:05:50.28,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Clients don't want this to happen on their projects, obviously.

118
0:05:54.12,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And yet of course they want innovation.

119
0:05:56.12,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Innovation is vital.

120
0:05:58.08,000 --> 0:06:,000
As an engineer, it's part of my DNA.

121
0:06:01.08,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It's in my blood.

122
0:06:02.92,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I couldn't be a very good engineer if I wasn't wanting to innovate,

123
0:06:06.68,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but we have to do so from a position of knowledge and strength

124
0:06:09.64,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and understanding.

125
0:06:12.08,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's no good taking a leap in the dark,

126
0:06:13.96,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and civilization has learned from mistakes since the beginning of time --

127
0:06:17.44,000 --> 0:06:18,000
no one more so than engineers.

128
0:06:22.04,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Some of you may have seen this film before --

129
0:06:24.2,000 --> 0:06:26,000
this is the very famous Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapse

130
0:06:26.8,000 --> 0:06:27,000
in Tacoma, Washington state,

131
0:06:30.2,000 --> 0:06:31,000
1940.

132
0:06:32.2,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The bridge became known as "Galloping Gertie"

133
0:06:34.36,000 --> 0:06:35,000
because she -- she?

134
0:06:35.64,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Is a bridge female? I don't know.

135
0:06:37.44,000 --> 0:06:4,000
She was wobbling like this for quite a long time,

136
0:06:40.76,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and notice this twisting motion.

137
0:06:43.8,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The bridge was far too flexible.

138
0:06:45.4,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It was designed by a chap called Leon Moisseiff,

139
0:06:47.68,000 --> 0:06:48,000
no stranger to suspension bridge design,

140
0:06:49.64,000 --> 0:06:52,000
but in this case he pushed the limits just that little bit too far

141
0:06:52.8,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and paid the price.

142
0:06:54.52,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Thankfully, nobody was killed.

143
0:06:56.92,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But this bridge collapse stopped suspension bridge development

144
0:07:00.76,000 --> 0:07:01,000
dead in its tracks.

145
0:07:02.68,000 --> 0:07:05,000
For 10 years nobody thought about doing another suspension bridge.

146
0:07:06.28,000 --> 0:07:07,000
There were none.

147
0:07:07.56,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And when they did emerge in the 1950s,

148
0:07:09.44,000 --> 0:07:1,000
they were an understandable overreaction,

149
0:07:11.417,000 --> 0:07:14,000
this sort of oversafe response to what had happened.

150
0:07:15.88,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But when it did occur in the mid-60s,

151
0:07:19.32,000 --> 0:07:2,000
there was indeed a step change --

152
0:07:20.96,000 --> 0:07:22,000
an innovation, a technological step change.

153
0:07:23.84,000 --> 0:07:24,000
This is the Severn Bridge in the UK.

154
0:07:26.2,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Notice the aerodynamically streamlined cross section

155
0:07:29.64,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in the center there.

156
0:07:30.88,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It's also a box which makes it very torsionally stiff --

157
0:07:33.64,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that twisting motion which we saw at Tacoma would not happen here.

158
0:07:37.52,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And it's also really lightweight,

159
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and as we'll see in a moment,

160
0:07:40.6,000 --> 0:07:42,000
lightweight is really important for long spans,

161
0:07:43.44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and everybody seems to want us to build longer spans.

162
0:07:47.04,000 --> 0:07:48,000
The longest at the moment is in Japan.

163
0:07:48.92,000 --> 0:07:51,000

1
0:00:12.571,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Raise your hand if you've ever been asked the question

2
0:00:15.382,000 --> 0:00:18,000
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

3
0:00:18.737,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Now if you had to guess,

4
0:00:20.346,000 --> 0:00:23,000
how old would you say you were when you were first asked this question?

5
0:00:23.787,000 --> 0:00:24,000
You can just hold up fingers.

6
0:00:25.999,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five. OK.

7
0:00:30.656,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Now, raise your hand if the question

8
0:00:35.356,000 --> 0:00:37,000
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

9
0:00:37.402,000 --> 0:00:39,000
has ever caused you any anxiety.

10
0:00:39.956,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:41.61,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Any anxiety at all.

12
0:00:45.342,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I'm someone who's never been able to answer the question

13
0:00:47.999,000 --> 0:00:49,000
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

14
0:00:50.313,000 --> 0:00:53,000
See, the problem wasn't that I didn't have any interests --

15
0:00:53.773,000 --> 0:00:55,000
it's that I had too many.

16
0:00:55.999,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In high school, I liked English and math and art and I built websites

17
0:01:00.474,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and I played guitar in a punk band called Frustrated Telephone Operator.

18
0:01:04.834,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Maybe you've heard of us.

19
0:01:06.999,000 --> 0:01:08,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:09.323,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This continued after high school,

21
0:01:11.252,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and at a certain point, I began to notice this pattern in myself

22
0:01:15.684,000 --> 0:01:17,000
where I would become interested in an area

23
0:01:18.261,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and I would dive in, become all-consumed,

24
0:01:21.444,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and I'd get to be pretty good at whatever it was,

25
0:01:24.999,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and then I would hit this point where I'd start to get bored.

26
0:01:30.046,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And usually I would try and persist anyway,

27
0:01:32.846,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because I had already devoted so much time and energy

28
0:01:35.767,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and sometimes money into this field.

29
0:01:38.287,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But eventually this sense of boredom,

30
0:01:40.614,000 --> 0:01:44,000
this feeling of, like, yeah, I got this, this isn't challenging anymore --

31
0:01:45.418,000 --> 0:01:46,000
it would get to be too much.

32
0:01:47.751,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I would have to let it go.

33
0:01:50.262,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But then I would become interested in something else,

34
0:01:52.787,000 --> 0:01:55,000
something totally unrelated, and I would dive into that,

35
0:01:55.999,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and become all-consumed, and I'd be like, "Yes! I found my thing,"

36
0:02:00.285,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and then I would hit this point again where I'd start to get bored.

37
0:02:05.352,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And eventually, I would let it go.

38
0:02:09.106,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But then I would discover something new and totally different,

39
0:02:12.198,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and I would dive into that.

40
0:02:15.103,000 --> 0:02:18,000
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety,

41
0:02:18.866,000 --> 0:02:19,000
for two reasons.

42
0:02:20.46,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The first was that I wasn't sure

43
0:02:23.316,000 --> 0:02:26,000
how I was going to turn any of this into a career.

44
0:02:26.353,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I thought that I would eventually have to pick one thing,

45
0:02:29.175,000 --> 0:02:31,000
deny all of my other passions,

46
0:02:31.413,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and just resign myself to being bored.

47
0:02:35.595,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The other reason it caused me so much anxiety

48
0:02:37.938,000 --> 0:02:38,000
was a little bit more personal.

49
0:02:40.23,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I worried that there was something wrong with this,

50
0:02:42.972,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and something wrong with me for being unable to stick with anything.

51
0:02:47.677,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I worried that I was afraid of commitment,

52
0:02:50.088,000 --> 0:02:53,000
or that I was scattered, or that I was self-sabotaging,

53
0:02:53.573,000 --> 0:02:54,000
afraid of my own success.

54
0:02:57.261,000 --> 0:03:,000
If you can relate to my story and to these feelings,

55
0:03:00.999,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I'd like you to ask yourself a question

56
0:03:03.297,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that I wish I had asked myself back then.

57
0:03:06.796,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Ask yourself where you learned to assign the meaning of wrong or abnormal

58
0:03:12.246,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to doing many things.

59
0:03:15.741,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I'll tell you where you learned it:

60
0:03:17.504,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you learned it from the culture.

61
0:03:22.074,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We are first asked the question "What do you want to be when you grow up?"

62
0:03:25.889,000 --> 0:03:26,000
when we're about five years old.

63
0:03:27.481,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And the truth is that no one really cares what you say when you're that age.

64
0:03:31.198,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:32.223,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's considered an innocuous question,

66
0:03:34.622,000 --> 0:03:36,000
posed to little kids to elicit cute replies,

67
0:03:37.006,000 --> 0:03:4,000
like, "I want to be an astronaut," or "I want to be a ballerina,"

68
0:03:40.703,000 --> 0:03:41,000
or "I want to be a pirate."

69
0:03:42.61,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Insert Halloween costume here.

70
0:03:44.584,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:46.119,000 --> 0:03:5,000
But this question gets asked of us again and again as we get older

72
0:03:50.555,000 --> 0:03:53,000
in various forms -- for instance, high school students might get asked

73
0:03:54.456,000 --> 0:03:56,000
what major they're going to pick in college.

74
0:03:57.088,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And at some point,

75
0:03:58.994,000 --> 0:04:,000
"What do you want to be when you grow up?"

76
0:04:01.046,000 --> 0:04:04,000
goes from being the cute exercise it once was

77
0:04:04.428,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to the thing that keeps us up at night.

78
0:04:07.137,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Why?

79
0:04:09.049,000 --> 0:04:14,000
See, while this question inspires kids to dream about what they could be,

80
0:04:14.518,000 --> 0:04:17,000
it does not inspire them to dream about all that they could be.

81
0:04:17.954,000 --> 0:04:19,000
In fact, it does just the opposite,

82
0:04:20.376,000 --> 0:04:23,000
because when someone asks you what you want to be,

83
0:04:23.416,000 --> 0:04:25,000
you can't reply with 20 different things,

84
0:04:26.236,000 --> 0:04:28,000
though well-meaning adults will likely chuckle and be like,

85
0:04:29.155,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"Oh, how cute, but you can't be a violin maker and a psychologist.

86
0:04:33.231,000 --> 0:04:34,000
You have to choose."

87
0:04:36.105,000 --> 0:04:37,000
This is Dr. Bob Childs --

88
0:04:37.898,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:40.999,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and he's a luthier and psychotherapist.

90
0:04:44.835,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And this is Amy Ng, a magazine editor turned illustrator, entrepreneur,

91
0:04:49.148,000 --> 0:04:5,000
teacher and creative director.

92
0:04:51.119,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But most kids don't hear about people like this.

93
0:04:53.849,000 --> 0:04:55,000
All they hear

94
0:04:55.999,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is that they're going to have to choose.

95
0:04:59.418,000 --> 0:05:,000
But it's more than that.

96
0:05:01.403,000 --> 0:05:03,000
The notion of the narrowly focused life

97
0:05:04.419,000 --> 0:05:06,000
is highly romanticized in our culture.

98
0:05:07.218,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It's this idea of destiny or the one true calling,

99
0:05:11.422,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the idea that we each have one great thing

100
0:05:14.203,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we are meant to do during our time on this earth,

101
0:05:16.56,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and you need to figure out what that thing is

102
0:05:19.467,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and devote your life to it.

103
0:05:23.135,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But what if you're someone who isn't wired this way?

104
0:05:26.999,000 --> 0:05:29,000
What if there are a lot of different subjects that you're curious about,

105
0:05:30.428,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and many different things you want to do?

106
0:05:33.246,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Well, there is no room for someone like you in this framework.

107
0:05:37.814,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And so you might feel alone.

108
0:05:40.412,000 --> 0:05:42,000
You might feel like you don't have a purpose.

109
0:05:43.017,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And you might feel like there's something wrong with you.

110
0:05:46.758,000 --> 0:05:47,000
There's nothing wrong with you.

111
0:05:48.908,000 --> 0:05:51,000
What you are is a multipotentialite.

112
0:05:52.525,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

113
0:05:54.999,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Applause)

114
0:06:02.312,000 --> 0:06:06,000
A multipotentialite is someone with many interests and creative pursuits.

115
0:06:07.852,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It's a mouthful to say.

116
0:06:09.822,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It might help if you break it up into three parts:

117
0:06:12.696,000 --> 0:06:15,000
multi, potential, and ite.

118
0:06:16.712,000 --> 0:06:19,000
You can also use one of the other terms that connote the same idea,

119
0:06:19.956,000 --> 0:06:21,000
such as polymath, the Renaissance person.

120
0:06:22.946,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Actually, during the Renaissance period,

121
0:06:24.914,000 --> 0:06:27,000
it was considered the ideal to be well-versed in multiple disciplines.

122
0:06:29.026,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Barbara Sher refers to us as "scanners."

123
0:06:32.214,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Use whichever term you like, or invent your own.

124
0:06:35.461,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I have to say I find it sort of fitting that as a community,

125
0:06:38.54,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we cannot agree on a single identity.

126
0:06:41.026,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:45.017,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It's easy to see your multipotentiality

128
0:06:47.438,000 --> 0:06:5,000
as a limitation or an affliction that you need to overcome.

129
0:06:51.375,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But what I've learned through speaking with people

130
0:06:53.792,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and writing about these ideas on my website,

131
0:06:56.284,000 --> 0:07:,000
is that there are some tremendous strengths to being this way.

132
0:07:01.656,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Here are three

133
0:07:03.641,000 --> 0:07:05,000
multipotentialite super powers.

134
0:07:07.384,000 --> 0:07:1,000
One: idea synthesis.

135
0:07:10.584,000 --> 0:07:12,000
That is, combining two or more fields

136
0:07:13.301,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and creating something new at the intersection.

137
0:07:17.633,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Sha Hwang and Rachel Binx drew from their shared interests

138
0:07:20.923,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in cartography, data visualization, travel, mathematics and design,

139
0:07:26.443,000 --> 0:07:27,000
when they founded Meshu.

140
0:07:28.999,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Meshu is a company that creates custom geographically-inspired jewelry.

141
0:07:35.409,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Sha and Rachel came up with this unique idea

142
0:07:37.859,000 --> 0:07:42,000
not despite, but because of their eclectic mix of skills and experiences.

143
0:07:45.077,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Innovation happens at the intersections.

144
0:07:48.797,000 --> 0:07:5,000
That's where the new ideas come from.

145
0:07:51.519,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And multipotentialites, with all of their backgrounds,

146
0:07:54.702,000 --> 0:07:57,000
are able to access a lot of these points of intersection.

147
0:07:59.999,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The second multipotentialite superpower

148
0:08:03.095,000 --> 0:08:04,000
is rapid learning.

149
0:08:05.404,000 --> 0:08:07,000
When multipotentialites become interested in something,

150
0:08:08.29,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we go hard.

151
0:08:10.369,000 --> 0:08:12,000
We observe everything we can get our hands on.

152
0:08:13.164,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We're also used to being beginners,

153
0:08:14.931,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because we've been beginners so many times in the past,

154
0:08:18.077,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and this means that we're less afraid of trying new things

155
0:08:21.38,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and stepping out of our comfort zones.

156
0:08:23.786,000 --> 0:08:27,000
What's more, many skills are transferable across disciplines,

157
0:08:27.839,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and we bring everything we've learned to every new area we pursue,

158
0:08:31.718,000 --> 0:08:33,000
so we're rarely starting from scratch.

159
0:08:34.971,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Nora Dunn is a full-time traveler and freelance writer.

160
0:08:39.121,000 --> 0:08:42,000
As a child concert pianist, she honed an incredible ability

161
0:08:42.952,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to develop muscle memory.

162
0:08:45.07,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Now, she's the fastest typist she knows.

163
0:08:47.834,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:49.322,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Before becoming a writer, Nora was a financial planner.

165
0:08:52.583,000 --> 0:08:54,000
She had to learn the finer mechanics of sales

166
0:08:54.813,000 --> 0:08:55,000
when she was starting her practice,

167
0:08:56.583,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and this skill now helps her write compelling pitches to editors.

168
0:09:01.727,000 --> 0:09:04,000
It is rarely a waste of time to pursue something you're drawn to,

169
0:09:05.621,000 --> 0:09:06,000
even if you end up quitting.

170
0:09:07.335,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You might apply that knowledge in a different field entirely,

171
0:09:10.663,000 --> 0:09:12,000
in a way that you couldn't have anticipated.

172
0:09:14.643,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The third multipotentialite superpower

173
0:09:17.438,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is adaptability;

174
0:09:19.309,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that is, the ability to morph into whatever you need to be

175
0:09:22.876,000 --> 0:09:23,000
in a given situation.

176
0:09:26.295,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Abe Cajudo is sometimes a video director, sometimes a web designer,

177
0:09:31.21,000 --> 0:09:34,000
sometimes a Kickstarter consultant, sometimes a teacher,

178
0:09:34.947,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and sometimes, apparently, James Bond.

179
0:09:37.362,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:39.076,000 --> 0:09:41,000
He's valuable because he does good work.

181
0:09:41.568,000 --> 0:09:44,000
He's even more valuable because he can take on various roles,

182
0:09:44.853,000 --> 0:09:46,000
depending on his clients' needs.

183
0:09:47.737,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Fast Company magazine identified adaptability

184
0:09:50.999,000 --> 0:09:53,000
as the single most important skill to develop in order to thrive

185
0:09:54.378,000 --> 0:09:55,000
in the 21st century.

186
0:09:56.808,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The economic world is changing so quickly and unpredictably

187
0:10:00.047,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that it is the individuals and organizations that can pivot

188
0:10:03.842,000 --> 0:10:06,000
in order to meet the needs of the market that are really going to thrive.

189
0:10:09.615,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Idea synthesis, rapid learning and adaptability:

190
0:10:13.93,000 --> 0:10:16,000
three skills that multipotentialites are very adept at,

191
0:10:17.877,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and three skills that they might lose if pressured to narrow their focus.

192
0:10:25.181,000 --> 0:10:29,000
As a society, we have a vested interest in encouraging multipotentialites

193
0:10:29.661,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to be themselves.

194
0:10:32.073,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We have a lot of complex, multidimensional problems in the world right now,

195
0:10:36.024,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and we need creative, out-of-the-box thinkers to tackle them.

196
0:10:41.81,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Now, let's say that you are, in your heart, a specialist.

197
0:10:46.498,000 --> 0:10:5,000
You came out of the womb knowing you wanted to be a pediatric neurosurgeon.

198
0:10:51.879,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Don't worry -- there's nothing wrong with you, either.

199
0:10:54.718,000 --> 0:10:55,000
(Laughter)

200
0:10:55.782,000 --> 0:10:58,000
In fact, some of the best teams are comprised of a specialist

201
0:10:58.849,000 --> 0:11:,000
and multipotentialite paired together.

202
0:11:01.48,000 --> 0:11:04,000
The specialist can dive in deep and implement ideas,

203
0:11:04.538,000 --> 0:11:07,000
while the multipotentialite brings a breadth of knowledge to the project.

204
0:11:08.164,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It's a beautiful partnership.

205
0:11:11.066,000 --> 0:11:13,000
But we should all be designing lives and careers

206
0:11:13.559,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that are aligned with how we're wired.

207
0:11:16.092,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And sadly, multipotentialites are largely being encouraged

208
0:11:20.534,000 --> 0:11:23,000
simply to be more like their specialist peers.

209
0:11:24.621,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So with that said,

210
0:11:27.124,000 --> 0:11:3,000
if there is one thing you take away from this talk,

211
0:11:30.219,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I hope that it is this:

212
0:11:33.341,000 --> 0:11:36,000
embrace your inner wiring, whatever that may be.

213
0:11:37.687,000 --> 0:11:39,000
If you're a specialist at heart,

214
0:11:39.879,000 --> 0:11:4,000
then by all means, specialize.

215
0:11:41.902,000 --> 0:11:43,000
That is where you'll do your best work.

216
0:11:44.624,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But to the multipotentialites in the room,

217
0:11:47.628,000 --> 0:11:49,000
including those of you who may have just realized

218
0:11:49.969,000 --> 0:11:51,000
in the last 12 minutes that you are one --

219
0:11:52.009,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Laughter)

220
0:11:53.638,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to you I say:

221
0:11:55.814,000 --> 0:11:57,000
embrace your many passions.

222
0:11:58.614,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Follow your curiosity down those rabbit holes.

223
0:12:02.643,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Explore your intersections.

224
0:12:06.264,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Embracing our inner wiring leads to a happier, more authentic life.

225
0:12:12.028,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And perhaps more importantly --

226
0:12:14.769,000 --> 0:12:17,000
multipotentialites, the world needs us.

227
0:12:19.852,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Thank you.

228
0:12:21.037,000 --> 0:12:23,000
(Applause)

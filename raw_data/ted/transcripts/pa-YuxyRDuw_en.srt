1
0:00:13.37,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is Charley Williams.

2
0:00:15.111,000 --> 0:00:17,000
He was 94 when this photograph was taken.

3
0:00:17.387,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In the 1930s, Roosevelt put

4
0:00:20.444,000 --> 0:00:21,000
thousands and thousands of Americans back to work

5
0:00:22.424,000 --> 0:00:24,000
by building bridges and infrastructure and tunnels,

6
0:00:24.95,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but he also did something interesting,

7
0:00:26.365,000 --> 0:00:28,000
which was to hire a few hundred writers

8
0:00:28.677,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to scour America to capture the stories of ordinary Americans.

9
0:00:32.638,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Charley Williams, a poor sharecropper,

10
0:00:34.799,000 --> 0:00:36,000
wouldn't ordinarily be the subject of a big interview,

11
0:00:37.461,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but Charley had actually been a slave

12
0:00:39.889,000 --> 0:00:41,000
until he was 22 years old.

13
0:00:42.447,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And the stories that were captured of his life

14
0:00:44.761,000 --> 0:00:46,000
make up one of the crown jewels

15
0:00:47.54,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of histories, of human-lived experiences

16
0:00:50.865,000 --> 0:00:52,000
filled with ex-slaves.

17
0:00:53.14,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Anna Deavere Smith famously said that

18
0:00:55.24,000 --> 0:00:57,000
there's a literature inside of each of us,

19
0:00:57.728,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and three generations later, I was part of a project

20
0:00:59.991,000 --> 0:01:,000
called StoryCorps,

21
0:01:01.552,000 --> 0:01:02,000
which set out to capture

22
0:01:03.544,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the stories of ordinary Americans

23
0:01:05.569,000 --> 0:01:07,000
by setting up a soundproof booth in public spaces.

24
0:01:08.466,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The idea is very, very simple.

25
0:01:09.696,000 --> 0:01:11,000
You go into these booths, you interview your grandmother

26
0:01:12.567,000 --> 0:01:14,000
or relative, you leave with a copy of the interview

27
0:01:14.855,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and an interview goes into the Library of Congress.

28
0:01:17.642,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It's essentially a way to make a national oral histories archive

29
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:23,000
one conversation at a time.

30
0:01:23.272,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And the question is, who do you want to remember --

31
0:01:25.746,000 --> 0:01:28,000
if you had just 45 minutes with your grandmother?

32
0:01:28.818,000 --> 0:01:3,000
What's interesting, in conversations with the founder, Dave Isay,

33
0:01:31.19,000 --> 0:01:32,000
we always actually talked about this

34
0:01:32.338,000 --> 0:01:34,000
as a little bit of a subversive project,

35
0:01:34.588,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because when you think about it,

36
0:01:35.989,000 --> 0:01:37,000
it's actually not really about the stories that are being told,

37
0:01:38.505,000 --> 0:01:39,000
it's about listening,

38
0:01:39.811,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and it's about the questions that you get to ask,

39
0:01:41.845,000 --> 0:01:43,000
questions that you may not have permission to

40
0:01:43.923,000 --> 0:01:44,000
on any other day.

41
0:01:45.193,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I'm going to play you just a couple of quick excerpts from the project.

42
0:01:50.131,000 --> 0:01:51,000
[Jesus Melendez talking about poet Pedro Pietri's final moments]

43
0:01:52.109,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Jesus Melendez: We took off, and as we were ascending,

44
0:01:54.675,000 --> 0:01:55,000
before we had leveled off,

45
0:01:56.318,000 --> 0:01:58,000
our level-off point was 45,000 feet,

46
0:01:58.747,000 --> 0:01:59,000
so before we had leveled off,

47
0:02:00.649,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Pedro began leaving us,

48
0:02:02.934,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and the beauty about it

49
0:02:05.147,000 --> 0:02:08,000
is that I believe that there's something after life.

50
0:02:08.979,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You can see it in Pedro.

51
0:02:12.273,000 --> 0:02:15,000
[Danny Perasa to his wife Annie Perasa married 26 years]

52
0:02:15.849,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Danny Perasa: See, the thing of it is,

53
0:02:17.579,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I always feel guilty when I say "I love you" to you,

54
0:02:20.282,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and I say it so often. I say it to remind you

55
0:02:23.174,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that as dumpy as I am, it's coming from me,

56
0:02:26.228,000 --> 0:02:3,000
it's like hearing a beautiful song from a busted old radio,

57
0:02:30.5,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and it's nice of you to keep the radio around the house.

58
0:02:32.625,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:34.938,000 --> 0:02:36,000
[Michael Wolmetz with his girlfriend Debora Brakarz]

60
0:02:37.638,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Michael Wolmetz: So this is the ring that my father gave to my mother,

61
0:02:40.696,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and we can leave it there.

62
0:02:42.228,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And he saved up and he purchased this,

63
0:02:44.036,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and he proposed to my mother with this,

64
0:02:45.921,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and so I thought that I would give it to you

65
0:02:47.862,000 --> 0:02:5,000
so that he could be with us for this also.

66
0:02:51.592,000 --> 0:02:54,000
So I'm going to share a mic with you right now, Debora.

67
0:02:54.95,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Where's the right finger?

68
0:02:56.767,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Debora Brakarz: (Crying)

69
0:02:58.54,000 --> 0:03:01,000
MW: Debora, will you please marry me?

70
0:03:02.258,000 --> 0:03:05,000
DB: Yes. Of course. I love you.

71
0:03:05.697,000 --> 0:03:07,000
(Kissing)

72
0:03:08.358,000 --> 0:03:12,000
MW: So kids, this is how your mother and I got married,

73
0:03:12.919,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in a booth in Grand Central Station with my father's ring.

74
0:03:16.618,000 --> 0:03:18,000
My grandfather was a cab driver for 40 years.

75
0:03:18.752,000 --> 0:03:2,000
He used to pick people up here every day.

76
0:03:20.855,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So it seems right.

77
0:03:22.982,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Jake Barton: So I have to say

78
0:03:24.621,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I did not actually choose those individual samples to make you cry

79
0:03:27.628,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because they all make you cry.

80
0:03:29.628,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The entire project is predicated on this act of love

81
0:03:32.342,000 --> 0:03:33,000
which is listening itself.

82
0:03:33.893,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And that motion of building an institution

83
0:03:36.678,000 --> 0:03:37,000
out of a moment of conversation and listening

84
0:03:38.519,000 --> 0:03:39,000
is actually a lot of what my firm, Local Projects,

85
0:03:40.371,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is doing with our engagements in general.

86
0:03:43.37,000 --> 0:03:44,000
So we're a media design firm, and we're working

87
0:03:45.1,000 --> 0:03:47,000
with a broad array of different institutions

88
0:03:47.249,000 --> 0:03:5,000
building media installations for museums and public spaces.

89
0:03:50.482,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Our latest engagement is the Cleveland Museum of Art,

90
0:03:53.158,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which we've created an engagement called Gallery One for.

91
0:03:56.238,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And Gallery One is an interesting project

92
0:03:58.384,000 --> 0:04:02,000
because it started with this massive, $350 million expansion

93
0:04:02.576,000 --> 0:04:03,000
for the Cleveland Museum of Art,

94
0:04:04.055,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and we actually brought in this piece

95
0:04:06.382,000 --> 0:04:08,000
specifically to grow new capacity, new audiences,

96
0:04:08.885,000 --> 0:04:1,000
at the same time that the museum itself is growing.

97
0:04:11.694,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Glenn Lowry, the head of MoMA, put it best when he said,

98
0:04:13.898,000 --> 0:04:15,000
"We want visitors to actually cease being visitors.

99
0:04:16.752,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Visitors are transient. We want people who live here,

100
0:04:18.931,000 --> 0:04:19,000
people who have ownership."

101
0:04:20.604,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And so what we're doing is making a broad array

102
0:04:22.389,000 --> 0:04:23,000
of different ways for people to actually engage

103
0:04:24.087,000 --> 0:04:26,000
with the material inside of these galleries,

104
0:04:26.286,000 --> 0:04:28,000
so you can still have a traditional gallery experience,

105
0:04:29.069,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but if you're interested, you can actually engage

106
0:04:31.577,000 --> 0:04:33,000
with any individual artwork and see the original context

107
0:04:34.378,000 --> 0:04:36,000
from where it's from, or manipulate the work itself.

108
0:04:37.12,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So, for example, you can click on this individual lion head,

109
0:04:39.835,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and this is where it originated from, 1300 B.C.

110
0:04:43.109,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Or this individual piece here,

111
0:04:45.219,000 --> 0:04:47,000
you can see the actual bedroom. It really changes the way

112
0:04:47.734,000 --> 0:04:5,000
you think about this type of a tempera painting.

113
0:04:51.074,000 --> 0:04:53,000
This is one of my favorites because you see the studio itself.

114
0:04:53.572,000 --> 0:04:54,000
This is Rodin's bust. You get the sense

115
0:04:55.417,000 --> 0:04:57,000
of this incredible factory for creativity.

116
0:04:57.885,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And it makes you think about literally the hundreds

117
0:04:59.717,000 --> 0:05:01,000
or thousands of years of human creativity and how

118
0:05:02.312,000 --> 0:05:05,000
each individual artwork stands in for part of that story.

119
0:05:05.367,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This is Picasso,

120
0:05:06.658,000 --> 0:05:08,000
of course embodying so much of it from the 20th century.

121
0:05:09.636,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And so our next interface, which I'll show you,

122
0:05:11.937,000 --> 0:05:14,000
actually leverages that idea of this lineage of creativity.

123
0:05:15.12,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It's an algorithm that actually allows you to browse

124
0:05:18.738,000 --> 0:05:21,000
the actual museum's collection using facial recognition.

125
0:05:21.937,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So this person's making different faces,

126
0:05:23.863,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and it's actually drawing forth different objects

127
0:05:26.27,000 --> 0:05:29,000
from the collection that connect with exactly how she's looking.

128
0:05:29.51,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And so you can imagine that, as people are performing

129
0:05:33.555,000 --> 0:05:35,000
inside of the museum itself, you get this sense

130
0:05:36.085,000 --> 0:05:37,000
of this emotional connection,

131
0:05:37.085,000 --> 0:05:39,000
this way in which our face connects with the thousands

132
0:05:39.438,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and tens of thousands of years.

133
0:05:41.351,000 --> 0:05:43,000
This is an interface that actually allows you to draw

134
0:05:43.546,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and then draws forth objects using those same shapes.

135
0:05:47.49,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So more and more we're trying to find ways

136
0:05:49.155,000 --> 0:05:52,000
for people to actually author things inside of the museums themselves,

137
0:05:52.241,000 --> 0:05:54,000
to be creative even as they're looking

138
0:05:54.241,000 --> 0:05:56,000
at other people's creativity and understanding them.

139
0:05:56.929,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So in this wall, the collections wall,

140
0:05:59.25,000 --> 0:06:02,000
you can actually see all 3,000 artworks all at the same time,

141
0:06:02.749,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and you can actually author your own

142
0:06:04.625,000 --> 0:06:07,000
individual walking tours of the museum, so you can share them,

143
0:06:07.99,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and someone can take a tour with the museum director

144
0:06:10.792,000 --> 0:06:12,000
or a tour with their little cousin.

145
0:06:13.022,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But all the while that we've been working

146
0:06:14.112,000 --> 0:06:16,000
on this engagement for Cleveland,

147
0:06:16.25,000 --> 0:06:17,000
we've also been working in the background

148
0:06:17.685,000 --> 0:06:19,000
on really our largest engagement to date,

149
0:06:19.686,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and that's the 9/11 Memorial and Museum.

150
0:06:23.27,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So we started in 2006

151
0:06:25.879,000 --> 0:06:27,000
as part of a team with Thinc Design

152
0:06:28.423,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to create the original master plan for the museum,

153
0:06:30.92,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and then we've done all the media design

154
0:06:32.62,000 --> 0:06:34,000
both for the museum and the memorial and then the media production.

155
0:06:35.207,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So the memorial opened in 2011,

156
0:06:38.077,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and the museum's going to open next year in 2014.

157
0:06:40.602,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And you can see from these images,

158
0:06:41.886,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the site is so raw and almost archaeological.

159
0:06:45.494,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And of course the event itself is so recent,

160
0:06:47.468,000 --> 0:06:49,000
somewhere between history and current events,

161
0:06:50.22,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it was a huge challenge to imagine

162
0:06:51.703,000 --> 0:06:53,000
how do you actually live up to a space like this,

163
0:06:54.653,000 --> 0:06:56,000
an event like this, to actually tell that story.

164
0:06:56.847,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And so what we started with

165
0:06:58.86,000 --> 0:07:01,000
was really a new way of thinking about building an institution,

166
0:07:02.491,000 --> 0:07:03,000
through a project called Make History,

167
0:07:03.998,000 --> 0:07:04,000
which we launched in 2009.

168
0:07:05.833,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So it's estimated that a third of the world

169
0:07:08.766,000 --> 0:07:09,000
watched 9/11 live,

170
0:07:10.446,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and a third of the world

171
0:07:11.769,000 --> 0:07:12,000
heard about it within 24 hours,

172
0:07:13.248,000 --> 0:07:15,000
making it really by nature of when it happened,

173
0:07:15.616,000 --> 0:07:18,000
this unprecedented moment of global awareness.

174
0:07:18.816,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And so we launched this to capture the stories

175
0:07:21.107,000 --> 0:07:22,000
from all around the world,

176
0:07:22.21,000 --> 0:07:23,000
through video, through photos,

177
0:07:23.876,000 --> 0:07:24,000
through written history,

178
0:07:25.053,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and so people's experiences on that day,

179
0:07:26.777,000 --> 0:07:28,000
which was, in fact, this huge risk for the institution

180
0:07:28.843,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to make its first move this open platform.

181
0:07:31.312,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But that was coupled together with this oral histories booth,

182
0:07:34.27,000 --> 0:07:35,000
really the simplest we've ever made,

183
0:07:35.387,000 --> 0:07:36,000
where you locate yourself on a map.

184
0:07:36.515,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's in six languages, and you can tell your own story

185
0:07:39.091,000 --> 0:07:41,000
about what happened to you on that day.

186
0:07:41.103,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And when we started seeing the incredible images

187
0:07:44.46,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and stories that came forth

188
0:07:45.908,000 --> 0:07:46,000
from all around the world --

189
0:07:47.177,000 --> 0:07:49,000
this is obviously part of the landing gear --

190
0:07:49.249,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we really started to understand

191
0:07:51.438,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that there was this amazing symmetry

192
0:07:53.523,000 --> 0:07:54,000
between the event itself,

193
0:07:55.046,000 --> 0:07:57,000
between the way that people were telling the stories of the event,

194
0:07:57.345,000 --> 0:08:,000
and how we ourselves needed to tell that story.

195
0:08:00.641,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This image in particular really captured

196
0:08:02.795,000 --> 0:08:03,000
our attention at the time,

197
0:08:03.976,000 --> 0:08:05,000
because it so much sums up that event.

198
0:08:06.464,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This is a shot from the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel.

199
0:08:09.071,000 --> 0:08:12,000
There's a firefighter that's stuck, actually, in traffic,

200
0:08:12.2,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and so the firefighters themselves are running

201
0:08:15.028,000 --> 0:08:16,000
a mile and a half to the site itself

202
0:08:16.637,000 --> 0:08:18,000
with upwards of 70 pounds of gear on their back.

203
0:08:19.607,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And we got this amazing email that said,

204
0:08:22.4,000 --> 0:08:23,000
"While viewing the thousands of photos on the site,

205
0:08:24.238,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I unexpectedly found a photo of my son.

206
0:08:27.211,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It was a shock emotionally, yet a blessing to find this photo,"

207
0:08:30.171,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and he was writing because he said,

208
0:08:31.492,000 --> 0:08:33,000
"I'd like to personally thank the photographer

209
0:08:33.832,000 --> 0:08:34,000
for posting the photo,

210
0:08:34.981,000 --> 0:08:36,000
as it meant more than words can describe to me

211
0:08:37.083,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to have access to what is probably

212
0:08:38.876,000 --> 0:08:42,000
the last photo ever taken of my son."

213
0:08:43.319,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And it really made us recognize

214
0:08:45.62,000 --> 0:08:47,000
what this institution needed to be

215
0:08:48.221,000 --> 0:08:5,000
in order to actually tell that story.

216
0:08:50.591,000 --> 0:08:53,000
We can't have just a historian or a curator narrating

217
0:08:54.387,000 --> 0:08:57,000
objectively in the third person about an event like that,

218
0:08:57.634,000 --> 0:08:59,000
when you have the witnesses to history

219
0:09:00.164,000 --> 0:09:,000
who are going to make their way

220
0:09:01.01,000 --> 0:09:04,000
through the actual museum itself.

221
0:09:04.155,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And so we started imagining the museum,

222
0:09:06.028,000 --> 0:09:09,000
along with the creative team at the museum and the curators,

223
0:09:09.4,000 --> 0:09:1,000
thinking about how the first voice that you would hear

224
0:09:11.297,000 --> 0:09:13,000
inside the museum would actually be of other visitors.

225
0:09:13.906,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And so we created this idea of an opening gallery

226
0:09:16.394,000 --> 0:09:17,000
called We Remember.

227
0:09:17.831,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And I'll just play you part of a mockup of it,

228
0:09:19.656,000 --> 0:09:2,000
but you get a sense of what it's like to actually enter

229
0:09:21.603,000 --> 0:09:22,000
into that moment in time

230
0:09:22.866,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and be transported back in history.

231
0:09:26.119,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Video) Voice 1: I was in Honolulu, Hawaii. Voice 2: I was in Cairo, Egypt.

232
0:09:29.93,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Voice 3: Sur les Champs-Élysées, à Paris. Voice 4: In college, at U.C. Berkeley.

233
0:09:33.368,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Voice 5: I was in Times Square. Voice 6: São Paolo, Brazil.

234
0:09:36.574,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Multiple voices)

235
0:09:41.19,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Voice 7: It was probably about 11 o'clock at night.

236
0:09:43.986,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Voice 8: I was driving to work at 5:45 local time in the morning.

237
0:09:47.734,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Voice 9: We were actually in a meeting

238
0:09:48.995,000 --> 0:09:49,000
when someone barged in and said,

239
0:09:50.722,000 --> 0:09:53,000
"Oh my God, a plane has just crashed into the World Trade Center."

240
0:09:54.515,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Voice 10: Trying to frantically get to a radio.

241
0:09:56.69,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Voice 11: When I heard it over the radio --

242
0:09:58.119,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Voice 12: Heard it on the radio.

243
0:09:59.495,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Multiple voices)

244
0:10:01.245,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Voice 13: I got a call from my father. Voice 14: The phone rang, it woke me up.

245
0:10:04.179,000 --> 0:10:05,000
My business partner told me to turn on the television.

246
0:10:06.12,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Voice 15: So I switched on the television.

247
0:10:08.489,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Voice 16: All channels in Italy were displaying the same thing.

248
0:10:10.877,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Voice 17: The Twin Towers. Voice 18: The Twin Towers.

249
0:10:13.719,000 --> 0:10:14,000
JB: And you move from there

250
0:10:14.816,000 --> 0:10:16,000
into that open, cavernous space.

251
0:10:16.9,000 --> 0:10:17,000
This is the so-called slurry wall.

252
0:10:18.785,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's the original, excavated wall at the base of the World Trade Center

253
0:10:21.959,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that withstood the actual pressure from the Hudson River

254
0:10:24.961,000 --> 0:10:26,000
for a full year after the event itself.

255
0:10:26.998,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And so we thought about carrying that sense of authenticity,

256
0:10:30.199,000 --> 0:10:32,000
of presence of that moment

257
0:10:32.574,000 --> 0:10:33,000
into the actual exhibition itself.

258
0:10:34.099,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And we tell the stories of being inside the towers

259
0:10:36.849,000 --> 0:10:37,000
through that same audio collage,

260
0:10:38.383,000 --> 0:10:39,000
so you're hearing people literally talking about

261
0:10:40.35,000 --> 0:10:42,000
seeing the planes as they make their way into the building,

262
0:10:43.274,000 --> 0:10:45,000
or making their way down the stairwells.

263
0:10:45.377,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And as you make your way into the exhibition

264
0:10:47.624,000 --> 0:10:48,000
where it talks about the recovery,

265
0:10:49.47,000 --> 0:10:51,000
we actually project directly onto these moments

266
0:10:51.958,000 --> 0:10:54,000
of twisted steel all of the experiences from people

267
0:10:55.155,000 --> 0:10:58,000
who literally excavated on top of the pile itself.

268
0:10:58.49,000 --> 0:11:,000
And so you can hear oral histories --

269
0:11:00.494,000 --> 0:11:02,000
so people who were actually working the so-called bucket brigades

270
0:11:02.965,000 --> 0:11:05,000
as you're seeing literally the thousands of experiences

271
0:11:06.15,000 --> 0:11:07,000
from that moment.

272
0:11:07.985,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And as you leave that storytelling moment

273
0:11:09.839,000 --> 0:11:1,000
understanding about 9/11,

274
0:11:11.702,000 --> 0:11:14,000
we then turn the museum back into a moment of listening

275
0:11:14.75,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and actually talk to the individual visitors

276
0:11:17.522,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and ask them their own experiences about 9/11.

277
0:11:20.153,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And we ask them questions that are actually

278
0:11:21.37,000 --> 0:11:23,000
not really answerable, the types of questions

279
0:11:23.408,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that 9/11 itself draws forth for all of us.

280
0:11:26.904,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And so these are questions like,

281
0:11:28.326,000 --> 0:11:31,000
"How can a democracy balance freedom and security?"

282
0:11:31.483,000 --> 0:11:34,000
"How could 9/11 have happened?"

283
0:11:35.057,000 --> 0:11:37,000
"And how did the world change after 9/11?"

284
0:11:37.192,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And so these oral histories,

285
0:11:38.723,000 --> 0:11:4,000
which we've actually been capturing already for years,

286
0:11:41.606,000 --> 0:11:43,000
are then mixed together with interviews

287
0:11:43.745,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that we're doing with people like Donald Rumsfeld,

288
0:11:45.971,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Bill Clinton, Rudy Giuliani,

289
0:11:47.843,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and you mix together these different players

290
0:11:49.963,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and these different experiences,

291
0:11:50.994,000 --> 0:11:52,000
these different reflection points about 9/11.

292
0:11:53.36,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And suddenly the institution, once again,

293
0:11:55.055,000 --> 0:11:57,000
turns into a listening experience.

294
0:11:57.396,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So I'll play you just a short excerpt

295
0:11:59.217,000 --> 0:12:,000
of a mockup that we made of a couple of these voices,

296
0:12:01.171,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but you really get a sense

297
0:12:02.968,000 --> 0:12:05,000
of the poetry of everyone's reflection on the event.

298
0:12:06.915,000 --> 0:12:09,000
(Video) Voice 1: 9/11 was not just a New York experience.

299
0:12:10.258,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Voice 2: It's something that we shared, and it's something that united us.

300
0:12:14.268,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Voice 3: And I knew when I saw that,

301
0:12:15.822,000 --> 0:12:17,000
people who were there that day who immediately

302
0:12:17.877,000 --> 0:12:2,000
went to help people known and unknown to them

303
0:12:20.937,000 --> 0:12:22,000
was something that would pull us through.

304
0:12:22.955,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Voice 4: All the outpouring of affection and emotion

305
0:12:25.774,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that came from our country was something really

306
0:12:27.742,000 --> 0:12:29,000
that will forever, ever stay with me.

307
0:12:30.56,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Voice 5: Still today I pray and think about those

308
0:12:32.306,000 --> 0:12:33,000
who lost their lives,

309
0:12:33.995,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and those who gave their lives to help others,

310
0:12:36.672,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but I'm also reminded of the fabric of this country,

311
0:12:40.091,000 --> 0:12:42,000
the love, the compassIon, the strength,

312
0:12:42.411,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and I watched a nation come together

313
0:12:44.84,000 --> 0:12:47,000
in the middle of a terrible tragedy.

314
0:12:50.013,000 --> 0:12:52,000
JB: And so as people make their way out of the museum,

315
0:12:52.72,000 --> 0:12:55,000
reflecting on the experience, reflecting on their own thoughts of it,

316
0:12:55.808,000 --> 0:12:58,000
they then move into the actual space of the memorial itself,

317
0:12:58.984,000 --> 0:13:,000
because they've gone back up to grade,

318
0:13:01.062,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and we actually got involved in the memorial

319
0:13:03.129,000 --> 0:13:05,000
after we'd done the museum for a few years.

320
0:13:05.368,000 --> 0:13:07,000
The original designer of the memorial, Michael Arad,

321
0:13:08.177,000 --> 0:13:1,000
had this image in his mind of all the names appearing

322
0:13:10.707,000 --> 0:13:12,000
undifferentiated, almost random,

323
0:13:13.103,000 --> 0:13:16,000
really a poetic reflection on top of the nature

324
0:13:16.935,000 --> 0:13:17,000
of a terrorism event itself,

325
0:13:18.452,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but it was a huge challenge for the families, for the foundation,

326
0:13:21.56,000 --> 0:13:22,000
certainly for the first responders,

327
0:13:23.436,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and there was a negotiation that went forth

328
0:13:25.566,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and a solution was found

329
0:13:27.079,000 --> 0:13:3,000
to actually create not an order in terms of chronology,

330
0:13:30.442,000 --> 0:13:31,000
or in terms of alphabetical,

331
0:13:31.806,000 --> 0:13:33,000
but through what's called meaningful adjacency.

332
0:13:33.952,000 --> 0:13:35,000
So these are groupings of the names themselves

333
0:13:36.703,000 --> 0:13:38,000
which appear undifferentiated but actually have an order,

334
0:13:39.371,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and we, along with Jer Thorp, created an algorithm

335
0:13:42.607,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to take massive amounts of data

336
0:13:44.602,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to actually start to connect together all these different names themselves.

337
0:13:47.927,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So this is an image of the actual algorithm itself

338
0:13:50.959,000 --> 0:13:52,000
with the names scrambled for privacy,

339
0:13:53.315,000 --> 0:13:55,000
but you can see that these blocks of color

340
0:13:55.695,000 --> 0:13:56,000
are actually the four different flights,

341
0:13:57.645,000 --> 0:13:59,000
the two different towers, the first responders,

342
0:14:00.422,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and you can actually see within that different floors,

343
0:14:02.994,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and then the green lines are the interpersonal connections

344
0:14:05.785,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that were requested by the families themselves.

345
0:14:08.959,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And so when you go to the memorial,

346
0:14:11.34,000 --> 0:14:13,000
you can actually see the overarching organization

347
0:14:13.99,000 --> 0:14:15,000
inside of the individual pools themselves.

348
0:14:16.874,000 --> 0:14:18,000
You can see the way that the geography of the event

349
0:14:19.244,000 --> 0:14:21,000
is reflected inside of the memorial,

350
0:14:22.127,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and you can search for an individual name,

351
0:14:23.955,000 --> 0:14:25,000
or in this case an employer, Cantor Fitzgerald,

352
0:14:26.53,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and see the way in which all of those names,

353
0:14:28.926,000 --> 0:14:3,000
those hundreds of names, are actually organized

354
0:14:31.036,000 --> 0:14:32,000
onto the memorial itself,

355
0:14:32.728,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and use that to navigate the memorial.

356
0:14:35.346,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And more importantly, when you're actually at the site

357
0:14:37.282,000 --> 0:14:38,000
of the memorial, you can see those connections.

358
0:14:38.761,000 --> 0:14:41,000
You can see the relationships between the different names themselves.

359
0:14:42.381,000 --> 0:14:45,000
So suddenly what is this undifferentiated, anonymous

360
0:14:45.65,000 --> 0:14:49,000
group of names springs into reality as an individual life.

361
0:14:50.328,000 --> 0:14:52,000
In this case, Harry Ramos,

362
0:14:52.496,000 --> 0:14:54,000
who was the head trader at an investment bank,

363
0:14:54.835,000 --> 0:14:59,000
who stopped to aid Victor Wald on the 55th floor of the South Tower.

364
0:14:59.873,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And Ramos told Wald, according to witnesses,

365
0:15:02.558,000 --> 0:15:04,000
"I'm not going to leave you."

366
0:15:05.028,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And Wald's widow requested that they be listed next to each other.

367
0:15:10.604,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Three generations ago, we had to actually get people

368
0:15:13.806,000 --> 0:15:16,000
to go out and capture the stories for common people.

369
0:15:17.203,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Today, of course, there's an unprecedented amount of stories

370
0:15:20.671,000 --> 0:15:23,000
for all of us that are being captured for future generations.

371
0:15:24.569,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And this is our hope, that's there's poetry inside of each of our stories.

372
0:15:28.097,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Thank you very much.

373
0:15:29.021,000 --> 0:15:33,000
(Applause)

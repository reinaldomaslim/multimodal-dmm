1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
To be new at TED -- it's like being the last high-school virgin.

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
You know that all of the cool people are -- they're doing it.

4
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And you're on the outside, you're at home.

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
You're like the Raspyni Brothers,

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
where you've got your balls in cold water. And --

7
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter) --

8
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
you just play with your fingers all day. And then you get invited.

9
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And you're on the inside, and it's everything you hoped it would be.

10
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It's exciting and there's music playing all of the time

11
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and then suddenly it's over. And it's only taken five minutes.

12
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And you want to go back and do it again.

13
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But I really appreciate being here. And thank you, Chris,

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and also, thank you, Deborah Patton, for making this possible.

15
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So anyway, today we'll talk about architecture a little bit,

16
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
within the subject of creation and optimism.

17
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And if you put creation and optimism together,

18
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
you've got two choices that you can talk about.

19
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
You can talk about creationism --

20
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
which I think wouldn't go down well with this audience,

21
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it --

22
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or you can talk about optimisations, spelled the British way, with an S, instead of a Z.

23
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And I think that's what I'd like to talk about today.

24
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But any kind of conversation about architecture --

25
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
which is, in fact, what you were just talking about, what was going on here,

26
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
setting up TED, small-scale architecture --

27
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
at the present time can't really happen without a conversation about this,

28
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the World Trade Center, and what's been going on there, what it means to us.

29
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Because if architecture is what I believe it to be,

30
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
which is the built form of our cultural ambitions,

31
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation

32
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that represents somebody else's cultural ambitions relative to us?

33
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And our own opportunity to make something new there?

34
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time.

35
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I think that the World Trade Center in, rather an unfortunate way,

36
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
brought architecture into focus

37
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
in a way that I don't think people had thought of in a long time,

38
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and made it a subject for common conversation.

39
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I don't remember, in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture,

40
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
a time when five people sat me down at a table

41
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and asked me very serious questions about zoning, fire exiting,

42
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
safety concerns and whether carpet burns.

43
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
These are just not things we talked about very often.

44
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And yet, now, it's talked about all the time.

45
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
At the point where you can weaponize your buildings,

46
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way.

47
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And so now we're going to think about architecture in a very different way,

48
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
we're going to think about it like this.

49
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
How many of you saw USA Today, today? There it is. Looks like that.

50
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
There's the World Trade Center site, on the front cover.

51
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They've made a selection.

52
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They've chosen a project by Daniel Libeskind,

53
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture.

54
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Child-prodigy piano player, he started on the squeezebox,

55
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and moved to a little more serious issue, a bigger instrument,

56
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and now to an even larger instrument,

57
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic,

58
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
as you see here.

59
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
He was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition,

60
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
after six previous firms struck out

61
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
with things that were so stupid and banal

62
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that even the city of New York was forced to go,

63
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
"Oh, I'm really sorry, we screwed up."

64
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Right. Can we do this again from the top,

65
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
except use some people with a vague hint of talent,

66
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time,

67
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities.

68
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Let's bring in some real architects for a change.

69
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And so we got this, or we had a choice of that. Oh, stop clapping.

70
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

71
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It's too late. That is gone.

72
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This was a scheme by a team called THINK, a New York-based team,

73
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and then there was that one, which was the Libeskind scheme.

74
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This one, this is going to be the new World Trade Center:

75
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it.

76
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Now, I don't know what you think, but I think this is a pretty stupid decision,

77
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
because what you've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction

78
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever.

79
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But that's what we're going to do.

80
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
But I want you to think about these things

81
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that American architecture represents,

82
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and that these two things talk about very specifically.

83
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects,

84
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in trying to decide whether we want architecture

85
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
from the kind of technocratic solution to everything --

86
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that there is a large, technical answer that can solve all problems,

87
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
be they social, be they physical, be they chemical --

88
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
or something that's more of a romantic solution.

89
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now, I don't mean romantic as in, this is a nice place to take someone on a date.

90
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I mean romantic in the sense of, there are things larger and grander than us.

91
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So, in the American tradition,

92
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the difference between the technocratic and the romantic,

93
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
would be the difference between Thomas Jefferson's

94
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Cartesian grids spreading across the United States,

95
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that gives us basically the whole shape

96
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of every western state in the United States,

97
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
as a really, truly, technocratic solution, a bowing to the --

98
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
in Jefferson's time -- current, popular philosophy of rationalism.

99
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Or the way we went to describe that later: manifest destiny.

100
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Now, which would you rather be? A grid, or manifest destiny?

101
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Manifest destiny.

102
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Laughter)

103
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's a big deal. It sounds big, it sounds important,

104
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
it sounds solid. It sounds American. Ballsy, serious, male.

105
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time.

106
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I mean, it goes on in our private lives, too, every single day.

107
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
We all want to go out and buy an Audi TT, don't we?

108
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Everyone here must own one, or at least they craved one

109
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the moment they saw one.

110
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And then they hopped in it, turned the little electronic key,

111
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
rather than the real key, zipped home on their new superhighway,

112
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and drove straight into a garage that looks like a Tudor castle.

113
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Laughter)

114
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Why? Why? Why do you want to do that?

115
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Why do we all want to do that? I even owned a Tudor thing once myself.

116
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

117
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It's in our nature to go ricocheting

118
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
back and forth between this technocratic solution

119
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and a larger, sort of more romantic image of where we are.

120
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So we're going to go straight into this.

121
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Can I have the lights off for a moment?

122
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I'm going to talk about two architects very, very briefly

123
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that represent the current split, architecturally,

124
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
between these two traditions of a technocratic

125
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
or technological solution and a romantic solution.

126
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And these are two of the top architectural practices in the United States today.

127
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
One very young, one a little more mature.

128
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This is the work of a firm called SHoP,

129
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and what you're seeing here, is their isometric drawings

130
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park.

131
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Does everybody know what a camera obscura is?

132
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Yeah, it's one of those giant camera lenses

133
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that takes a picture of the outside world --

134
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
it's sort of a little movie, without any moving parts --

135
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and projects it on a page, and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it.

136
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
This is just the outline of it, and you can see,

137
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
does it look like a regular building? No.

138
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
It's actually non-orthogonal: it's not up and down,

139
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
square, rectangular, anything like that,

140
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that you'd see in a normal shape of a building.

141
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
The computer revolution, the technocratic, technological revolution,

142
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings,

143
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
traditionally shaped buildings, in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this.

144
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
What's interesting about it is not the shape.

145
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
What's interesting about it is how it's made. How it's made.

146
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
A brand-new way to put buildings together,

147
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
something called mass customization. No, it is not an oxymoron.

148
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
What makes the building expensive, in the traditional sense,

149
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
is making individual parts custom, that you can't do over and over again.

150
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
That's why we all live in developer houses.

151
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
They all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times.

152
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
That's because it's cheaper.

153
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer,

154
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
a program that says, manufacture these parts.

155
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
The computer then talks to a machine --

156
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
a computer-operated machine, a cad-cam machine --

157
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that can make a zillion different changes, at a moment's notice,

158
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
because the computer is just a machine.

159
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It doesn't care. It's manufacturing the parts.

160
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It doesn't see any excess cost. It doesn't spend any extra time.

161
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It's not a laborer -- it's simply an electronic lathe,

162
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
so the parts can all be cut at the same time.

163
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Meanwhile, instead of sending someone working drawings,

164
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
which are those huge sets of blueprints that you've seen your whole life,

165
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions,

166
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
like you used to get when you were a child,

167
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
when you bought little models that said, "Bolt A to B, and C to D."

168
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And so what the builder will get is every single individual part

169
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck

170
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to the site, to that builder, and a set of these instruction manuals.

171
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Just simple "Bolt A to B" and they will be able to put them together.

172
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Here's the little drawing that tells them how that works --

173
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and that's what will happen in the end.

174
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
You're underneath it, looking up into the lens of the camera obscura.

175
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Lest you think this is all fiction, lest you think this is all fantasy, or romance,

176
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
these same architects were asked to produce something

177
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
for the central courtyard of PS1, which is a museum in Brooklyn, New York,

178
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
as part of their young architects summer series.

179
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And they said, well, it's summer, what do you do?

180
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
In the summer, you go to the beach.

181
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And when you go to the beach, what do you get? You get sand dunes.

182
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So let's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana.

183
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune.

184
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
They took photographs, they fed the photographs into their computer program,

185
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and that computer program shaped a sand dune

186
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into --

187
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
at their instructions, using standard software with slight modifications --

188
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
a set of instructions for pieces of wood.

189
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And those are the pieces of wood. Those are the instructions.

190
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
These are the pieces, and here's a little of that blown up.

191
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
What you can see is there's about six different colors,

192
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and each color represents a type of wood to be cut, a piece of wood to be cut.

193
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
All of which were delivered by flat bed, on a truck,

194
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people,

195
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.

196
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Only one of whom had ever seen the plans before.

197
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And here comes dune-scape, coming up out of the courtyard,

198
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and there it is fully built.

199
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
There are only 16 different pieces of wood,

200
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
only 16 different assembly parts here.

201
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside.

202
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It has its own built-in swimming pool, very, very cool.

203
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It's a great place for parties -- it was, it was only up for six weeks.

204
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
It's got little dressing rooms and cabanas,

205
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
where lots of interesting things went on, all summer long.

206
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Now, lest you think that this is only for the light at heart, or just temporary installations,

207
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
this is the same firm working at the World Trade Center,

208
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
replacing the bridge that used to go across West Street,

209
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that very important pedestrian connection

210
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
between the city of New York and the redevelopment of the West Side.

211
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
They were asked to design, replace that bridge in six weeks,

212
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
building it, including all of the parts, manufactured.

213
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And they were able to do it. That was their design,

214
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
using that same computer modeling system

215
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and only five or six really different kinds of parts,

216
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
a couple of struts, like this, some exterior cladding material

217
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and a very simple framing system

218
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck.

219
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
They were able to create that.

220
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
They were able to create something wonderful.

221
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
They're now building a 16-story building on the side of New York,

222
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
using the same technology.

223
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Here we're going to walk across the bridge at night.

224
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It's self-lit, you don't need any overhead lighting,

225
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
so the neighbors don't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face.

226
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Here it is going across. And there, down the other side,

227
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and you get the same kind of grandeur.

228
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Now, let me show you, quickly, the opposite, if I may.

229
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Woo, pretty, huh. This is the other side of the coin.

230
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
This is the work of David Rockwell from New York City,

231
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
whose work you can see out here today.

232
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
The current king of the romantics, who approaches his work

233
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
in a very different fashion.

234
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
It's not to create a technological solution, it's to seduce you

235
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
into something that you can do, into something that will please you,

236
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
something that will lift your spirits,

237
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
something that will make you feel as if are in another world --

238
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
such as his Nobu restaurant in New York,

239
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
which is supposed to take you from the clutter of New York City

240
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to the simplicity of Japan and the elegance of Japanese tradition.

241
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
"When it's all said and done, it's got to look like seaweed," said the owner.

242
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Or his restaurant, Pod, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

243
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I want you to know the room you're looking at is stark white.

244
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Every single surface of this restaurant is white.

245
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
The reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting.

246
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
It's all about sensuality. It's all about transforming.

247
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Watch this -- I'm not touching any buttons, ladies and gentlemen.

248
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
This is happening by itself.

249
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
It transforms through the magic of lighting.

250
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
It's all about sensuality. It's all about touch.

251
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Rosa Mexicano restaurant, where he transports us to the shores of Acapulco,

252
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
up on the Upper West Side,

253
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go, like that.

254
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Let's see it one more time.

255
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Okay, just to make sure that you've enjoyed it.

256
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And finally, it's about comfort, it's about making you feel good

257
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
in places that you wouldn't have felt good before.

258
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
It's about bringing nature to the inside.

259
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
In the Guardian Tower of New York, converted to a W Union Square --

260
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
I'm sorry I'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world

261
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space

262
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
of the court garden of the Union Square into the building itself.

263
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
It's about stimulation.

264
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
This is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste.

265
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Fizzy, fresh, soft, luscious, juicy, smooth, big and sweet wines,

266
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
all explained to you by color and texture on the wall.

267
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And finally, it's about entertainment, as in his headquarters

268
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
for the Cirque du Soleil, Orlando, Florida,

269
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
where you're asked to enter the Greek theater,

270
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
look under the tent and join the magic world of Cirque du Soleil.

271
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And I think I'll probably leave it at that. Thank you very much.

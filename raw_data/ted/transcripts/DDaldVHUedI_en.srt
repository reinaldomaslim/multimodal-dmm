1
0:00:12.706,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I love museums.

2
0:00:16.3,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Have you guys ever been to the Natural History Museum?

3
0:00:18.86,000 --> 0:00:19,000
In New York City?

4
0:00:20.3,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Applause)

5
0:00:21.98,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So one of the things that I do is I take my kids to the museum.

6
0:00:27.7,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Recently I took them to the Natural History Museum.

7
0:00:30.3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I had my two sons with me, Sabian and Dabith.

8
0:00:33.46,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And we go into the front entrance of the museum,

9
0:00:36.1,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and there's that amazing sculpture of Teddy Roosevelt out there.

10
0:00:39.756,000 --> 0:00:41,000
You guys know which one I'm talking about.

11
0:00:41.78,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Teddy Roosevelt is sitting there with one hand on the horse,

12
0:00:44.9,000 --> 0:00:46,000
bold, strong, sleeves rolled up.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I don't know if he's bare-chested, but it kind of feels like it.

14
0:00:50.3,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:51.66,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And on the left-hand side of him is a Native American walking.

16
0:00:56.34,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And on the right-hand side of him is an African-American walking.

17
0:01:01.54,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And as we're moving up the stairs,

18
0:01:05.02,000 --> 0:01:07,000
getting closer to the sculpture,

19
0:01:07.98,000 --> 0:01:09,000
my oldest son, who's nine, says,

20
0:01:10.06,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"Dad, how come he gets to ride,

21
0:01:14.94,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and they have to walk?"

22
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It stopped me in my tracks.

23
0:01:20.34,000 --> 0:01:22,000
It stopped me in my tracks.

24
0:01:22.42,000 --> 0:01:23,000
There was so much history

25
0:01:23.9,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that we would have to go through to try to explain that,

26
0:01:26.58,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and that's something I try to do with them anyways.

27
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's a question that I probably would have never really asked.

28
0:01:34.54,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But fundamentally what he was saying was,

29
0:01:36.74,000 --> 0:01:37,000
"That doesn't look fair.

30
0:01:38.54,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Dad, that doesn't look fair.

31
0:01:40.86,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And why is this thing that's so not fair

32
0:01:43.46,000 --> 0:01:46,000
sitting outside of such an amazing institution."

33
0:01:47.46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And his question got me wondering,

34
0:01:49.14,000 --> 0:01:53,000
is there a way for us to amend our public sculptures,

35
0:01:54.02,000 --> 0:01:55,000
our national monuments?

36
0:01:56.14,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Not erase them,

37
0:01:58.14,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but is there a way to amend them?

38
0:02:00.42,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Now, I didn't grow up going to museums.

39
0:02:04.9,000 --> 0:02:06,000
That's not my history.

40
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
My mother was 15 years old when I was born.

41
0:02:09.46,000 --> 0:02:1,000
She is amazing.

42
0:02:11.94,000 --> 0:02:13,000
My father was struggling with his own things

43
0:02:14.3,000 --> 0:02:15,000
for most of my life.

44
0:02:17.66,000 --> 0:02:19,000
If you really want to know the truth,

45
0:02:19.7,000 --> 0:02:21,000
the only reason I got into art is because of a woman.

46
0:02:23.78,000 --> 0:02:27,000
There was this amazing, amazing, fantastic, beautiful, smart woman,

47
0:02:28.66,000 --> 0:02:29,000
four years older than me,

48
0:02:30.02,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and I wanted to go out with her.

49
0:02:31.86,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But she said, "You're too young

50
0:02:33.38,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and you're not thinking about your future."

51
0:02:35.62,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So I ran on down to the junior college,

52
0:02:39.3,000 --> 0:02:41,000
registered for some classes,

53
0:02:41.5,000 --> 0:02:42,000
ran on back,

54
0:02:43.18,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and basically was like, "I'm thinking about my future now."

55
0:02:46.02,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:48.46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
"Can we go out?"

57
0:02:50.9,000 --> 0:02:52,000
For the record, she's even more amazing.

58
0:02:53.34,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I married her.

59
0:02:54.58,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Applause)

60
0:03:00.18,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So when I randomly ran down to the junior college

61
0:03:04.86,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and registered for classes,

62
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I really wasn't paying attention to what I was registering to.

63
0:03:09.98,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So I ended up with an art history class,

65
0:03:14.02,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and I didn't know a thing about art history.

66
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But something amazing happened when I went into that class.

67
0:03:21.5,000 --> 0:03:24,000
For the first time in my academic career,

68
0:03:25.34,000 --> 0:03:28,000
my visual intelligence was required of me.

69
0:03:28.74,000 --> 0:03:29,000
For the first time.

70
0:03:30.38,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The professor would put up an image,

71
0:03:32.46,000 --> 0:03:36,000
bold strokes of blues and yellows, and say, "Who's that?"

72
0:03:36.62,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And I'd go, "That's Van Gogh. Clearly that is Van Gogh.

73
0:03:39.54,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I got this."

74
0:03:41.14,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:43.1,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I got a B in that class.

76
0:03:46.06,000 --> 0:03:49,000
For me, that was amazing.

77
0:03:50.18,000 --> 0:03:54,000
In high school, let's just say I wasn't a great student. OK?

78
0:03:54.5,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In high school, my GPA was .65.

79
0:03:56.94,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:58.46,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Decimal point first, six five.

81
0:04:02.78,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So me getting a B was huge, huge,

82
0:04:06.94,000 --> 0:04:07,000
absolutely huge.

83
0:04:08.7,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And because of the fact that I realized that I was able to learn things visually

84
0:04:13.66,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that I couldn't learn in other ways,

85
0:04:15.42,000 --> 0:04:17,000
this became my strategy, this became my tactic

86
0:04:18.3,000 --> 0:04:19,000
for understanding everything else.

87
0:04:21.58,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I wanted to stay in this relationship. Things were going well.

88
0:04:24.54,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I decided, let me keep taking these art history classes.

89
0:04:27.22,000 --> 0:04:3,000
One of the last art history classes, I will not forget, I will never forget.

90
0:04:30.82,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It was one of those survey art history classes.

91
0:04:33.06,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Anybody ever have one of those survey art history classes,

92
0:04:35.82,000 --> 0:04:37,000
where they try to teach you the entire history of art

93
0:04:38.78,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in a single semester?

94
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I'm talking about cave paintings and Jackson Pollock

95
0:04:45.3,000 --> 0:04:47,000
just crunched together all in the same --

96
0:04:47.58,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It doesn't really work, but they try anyway.

97
0:04:51.5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Well, at the beginning of the semester,

98
0:04:54.02,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I looked at the book,

99
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and in this 400-page book was about a 14-page section

100
0:04:59.22,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that was on black people in painting.

101
0:05:01.34,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Now, this was a crammed in section

102
0:05:03.38,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that had representations of black people in painting

103
0:05:07.78,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and black people who painted.

104
0:05:10.54,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It was poorly curated, let's just put it that way.

105
0:05:14.86,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:16.1,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Nonetheless I was really excited about it,

107
0:05:19.46,000 --> 0:05:21,000
because in all the other classes that I had,

108
0:05:21.78,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we didn't even have that conversation.

109
0:05:24.94,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We didn't talk about it at all.

110
0:05:27.54,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So imagine my surprise

111
0:05:29.3,000 --> 0:05:3,000
when I get to class

112
0:05:30.9,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and on the day that we're supposed to go over that particular chapter,

113
0:05:35.14,000 --> 0:05:36,000
my professor announces,

114
0:05:37.98,000 --> 0:05:38,000
"We're going to skip this chapter today

115
0:05:39.9,000 --> 0:05:41,000
because we do not have time to go through it."

116
0:05:42.66,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"Whoa, I'm sorry, hold on, professor, professor.

117
0:05:45.54,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I'm sorry. This is a really important chapter to me.

118
0:05:49.14,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Are we going to go over it at any point?"

119
0:05:51.42,000 --> 0:05:52,000
"Titus, we don't have time for this."

120
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

121
0:05:55.38,000 --> 0:05:56,000
please, I really need to understand.

122
0:05:57.14,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Clearly the author thinks that this is significant.

123
0:05:59.58,000 --> 0:06:,000
Why are we skipping over this?"

124
0:06:01.14,000 --> 0:06:03,000
"Titus, I do not have time for this."

125
0:06:03.18,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"OK, last question, I'm really sorry here.

126
0:06:05.46,000 --> 0:06:07,000
When can we talk, because we need to talk."

127
0:06:07.54,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:09.38,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I went to her office hours.

129
0:06:11.62,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I ended up getting kicked out of her office.

130
0:06:14.18,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I went to the dean.

131
0:06:15.7,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The dean finally told me, "I can't force her to teach anything."

132
0:06:18.78,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And I knew in that moment if I wanted to understand this history,

133
0:06:22.86,000 --> 0:06:26,000
if I wanted to understand the roles of those folks who had to walk,

134
0:06:27.3,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I was probably going to have to figure that out myself.

135
0:06:33.42,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So ...

136
0:06:39.78,000 --> 0:06:4,000
above you right here on the slide

137
0:06:43.14,000 --> 0:06:45,000
is a painting by Frans Hals.

138
0:06:47.02,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This is one of the kinds of images

139
0:06:51.78,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that was in that chapter.

140
0:06:55.14,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I taught myself how to paint

141
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
by going to museums and looking at images like this.

142
0:07:03.46,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I want to show you something.

143
0:07:17.94,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I made this.

144
0:07:20.14,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I --

145
0:07:21.38,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Applause)

146
0:07:22.82,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I made some alterations.

147
0:07:24.1,000 --> 0:07:26,000
You'll see there are some slight differences in the painting.

148
0:07:28.66,000 --> 0:07:32,000
All this art history that I had been absorbing

149
0:07:33.38,000 --> 0:07:36,000
helped me to realize that painting is a language.

150
0:07:41.1,000 --> 0:07:42,000
There is a reason

151
0:07:47.66,000 --> 0:07:5,000
why he is the highest in the composition here.

152
0:07:57.62,000 --> 0:07:58,000
There is a reason

153
0:08:01.38,000 --> 0:08:04,000
why the painter is showing us this gold necklace here.

154
0:08:08.46,000 --> 0:08:1,000
He's trying to tell us something about the economic status

155
0:08:11.22,000 --> 0:08:12,000
of these people in these paintings.

156
0:08:16.14,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Painting is a visual language

157
0:08:20.1,000 --> 0:08:23,000
where everything in the painting

158
0:08:23.62,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is meaningful, is important.

159
0:08:26.34,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It's coded.

160
0:08:32.42,000 --> 0:08:35,000
But sometimes, because of the compositional structure,

161
0:08:35.54,000 --> 0:08:36,000
because of compositional hierarchy,

162
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
it's hard to see other things.

163
0:08:56.14,000 --> 0:09:,000
This silk is supposed to tell us also that they have quite a bit of money.

164
0:09:02.66,000 --> 0:09:03,000
There's more written

165
0:09:04.34,000 --> 0:09:06,000
about dogs in art history

166
0:09:08.34,000 --> 0:09:1,000
than there are about this other character here.

167
0:09:13.02,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Historically speaking, in research on these kinds of paintings,

168
0:09:16.14,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I can find out more about the lace

169
0:09:20.14,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that the woman is wearing in this painting --

170
0:09:23.14,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the manufacturer of the lace -- than I can about this character here,

171
0:09:27.9,000 --> 0:09:29,000
about his dreams, about his hopes,

172
0:09:30.06,000 --> 0:09:31,000
about what he wanted out of life.

173
0:09:35.1,000 --> 0:09:36,000
I want to show you something.

174
0:09:39.02,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I don't want you to think

175
0:09:40.9,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that this is about eradication.

176
0:09:44.86,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It's not.

177
0:09:46.1,000 --> 0:09:5,000
The oil that you saw me just put inside of this paint

178
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
is linseed oil.

179
0:09:51.78,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It becomes transparent over time,

180
0:09:54.62,000 --> 0:09:55,000
so eventually what's going to happen

181
0:09:57.7,000 --> 0:09:58,000
is these faces

182
0:10:00.14,000 --> 0:10:01,000
will emerge a little bit.

183
0:10:04.22,000 --> 0:10:05,000
What I'm trying to do,

184
0:10:06.14,000 --> 0:10:07,000
what I'm trying to show you,

185
0:10:08.22,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is how to shift your gaze just slightly,

186
0:10:11.62,000 --> 0:10:12,000
just momentarily,

187
0:10:13.54,000 --> 0:10:14,000
just momentarily,

188
0:10:14.98,000 --> 0:10:15,000
to ask yourself the question,

189
0:10:18.18,000 --> 0:10:19,000
why do some have to walk?

190
0:10:20.18,000 --> 0:10:24,000
What is the impact of these kinds of sculptures at museums?

191
0:10:24.46,000 --> 0:10:27,000
What is the impact of these kinds of paintings

192
0:10:28.06,000 --> 0:10:3,000
on some of our most vulnerable in society,

193
0:10:30.98,000 --> 0:10:32,000
seeing these kinds of depictions of themselves all the time?

194
0:10:34.98,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I'm not saying erase it.

195
0:10:36.82,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We can't erase this history.

196
0:10:39.02,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's real. We have to know it.

197
0:10:41.7,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I think of it in the same way

198
0:10:43.66,000 --> 0:10:44,000
we think of --

199
0:10:47.58,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Let me step back a second.

200
0:10:49.7,000 --> 0:10:51,000
You remember old-school cameras,

201
0:10:52.06,000 --> 0:10:55,000
where when you took a picture, you actually had to focus. Right?

202
0:10:55.38,000 --> 0:10:56,000
You'd put the camera up,

203
0:10:56.66,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and if I wanted you in focus,

204
0:10:58.66,000 --> 0:11:,000
I would move the lens a little to the left

205
0:11:00.684,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and you would come forward.

206
0:11:02.02,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I could move the lens a little to the right,

207
0:11:04.14,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and you would go back and the folks in the background would come out.

208
0:11:07.42,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I'm just trying to do that here.

209
0:11:09.46,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I'm trying to give you that opportunity.

210
0:11:13.06,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I'm trying to answer that question

211
0:11:15.3,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that my son had.

212
0:11:19.9,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I want to make paintings,

213
0:11:21.9,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I want to make sculptures

214
0:11:24.18,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that are honest,

215
0:11:26.42,000 --> 0:11:3,000
that wrestle with the struggles of our past

216
0:11:31.22,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but speak to the diversity and the advances of our present.

217
0:11:36.7,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And we can't do that by taking an eraser and getting rid of stuff.

218
0:11:39.9,000 --> 0:11:4,000
That's just not going to work.

219
0:11:41.66,000 --> 0:11:43,000
I think that we should do it in the same way

220
0:11:43.78,000 --> 0:11:44,000
the American Constitution works.

221
0:11:45.38,000 --> 0:11:46,000
When we have a situation

222
0:11:46.66,000 --> 0:11:49,000
where we want to change a law in the American Constitution,

223
0:11:50.54,000 --> 0:11:52,000
we don't erase the other one.

224
0:11:53.34,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Alongside that is an amendment,

225
0:11:55.58,000 --> 0:11:56,000
something that says,

226
0:11:56.86,000 --> 0:11:59,000
"This is where we were, but this is where we are right now."

227
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I figure if we can do that,

228
0:12:03.74,000 --> 0:12:05,000
then that will help us understand a little bit

229
0:12:06.1,000 --> 0:12:07,000
about where we're going.

230
0:12:38.3,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Thank you.

231
0:12:39.54,000 --> 0:12:42,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want to share with you

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
over the next 18 minutes

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a pretty incredible idea.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Actually, it's a really big idea.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But to get us started,

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I want to ask if everyone

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
could just close your eyes for two seconds

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and try and think of a technology or a bit of science

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that you think has changed the world.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Now I bet, in this audience,

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
you're thinking of some really incredible technology,

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
some stuff that I haven't even heard of,

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I'm absolutely sure.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But I'm also sure, pretty sure,

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that absolutely nobody is thinking of this.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
This is a polio vaccine.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And it's a great thing actually

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
that nobody's had to think about it here today

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because it means that we can take this for granted.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
This is a great technology.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We can take it completely for granted.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But it wasn't always that way.

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Even here in California,

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
if we were to go back just a few years,

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
it was a very different story.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
People were terrified of this disease.

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
They were terrified of polio, and it would cause public panic.

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And it was because of scenes like this.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
In this scene,

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
people are living in an iron lung.

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before,

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and then two days later,

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
they can no longer breathe,

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and this polio virus has paralyzed

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
not only their arms and their legs,

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but also their breathing muscles.

37
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives, usually,

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
in this iron lung to breathe for them.

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This disease was terrifying.

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
There was no cure,

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and there was no vaccine.

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The disease was so terrifying

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that the president of the United States

44
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
launched an extraordinary national effort

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to find a way to stop it.

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Twenty years later, they succeeded

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and developed the polio vaccine.

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
It was hailed as a scientific miracle

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in the late 1950s.

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Finally, a vaccine that could stop this awful disease,

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and here in the United States

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
it had an incredible impact.

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
As you can see, the virus stopped,

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and it stopped very, very fast.

55
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But this wasn't the case

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
everywhere in the world.

57
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And it happened so fast in the United States, however,

58
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that even just last month Jon Stewart said this:

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Video) Jon Stewart: Where is polio still active?

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Because I thought that had been eradicated

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
in the way that smallpox had been eradicated.

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Bruce Aylward: Oops. Jon, polio's almost been eradicated.

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But the reality is

64
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that polio still exists today.

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists.

66
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
This is the picture.

67
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
There's not very much left in the world.

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But the reason there's not very much left

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is because there's been an extraordinary public/private partnership

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
working behind the scenes, almost unknown,

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I'm sure to most of you here today.

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's been working for 20 years

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to try and eradicate this disease,

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and it's got it down to these few cases

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that you can see here on this graphic.

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But just last year,

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we had an incredible shock

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and realized that almost just isn't good enough

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
with a virus like polio.

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And this is the reason:

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
in two countries

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that hadn't had this disease for more than probably a decade,

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
on opposite sides of the globe,

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks.

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Hundreds of people were paralyzed.

86
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Hundreds of people died --

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
children as well as adults.

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And in both cases,

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses,

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries.

91
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
They had come from thousands of miles away.

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And in one case, it originated on another continent.

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And not only that, but when they came into these countries,

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
then they got on commercial jetliners probably

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and they traveled even farther

96
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to other places like Russia,

97
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
where, for the first time in over a decade last year,

98
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
children were crippled and paralyzed

99
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
by a disease that they had not seen for years.

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you,

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
these are under control now,

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and it looks like they'll probably stop very, very quickly.

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But the message was very clear.

104
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Polio is still

105
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
a devastating, explosive disease.

106
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It's just happening in another part of the world.

107
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And our big idea

108
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
is that the scientific miracle of this decade

109
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
should be the complete eradication

110
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
of poliomyelitis.

111
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So I want to tell you a little bit

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
about what this partnership, the Polio Partnership,

113
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is trying to do.

114
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
We're not trying to control polio.

115
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We're not trying to get it down to just a few cases,

116
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because this disease is like a root fire;

117
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
it can explode again if you don't snuff it out completely.

118
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So what we're looking for

119
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is a permanent solution.

120
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We want a world in which every child, just like you guys,

121
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
can take for granted

122
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a polio-free world.

123
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So we're looking for a permanent solution,

124
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and this is where we get lucky.

125
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
This is one of the very few viruses in the world

126
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
where there are big enough cracks in its armor

127
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that we can try to do something truly extraordinary.

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
This virus can only survive in people.

129
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It can't live for a very long time in people.

130
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It doesn't survive in the environment hardly at all.

131
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And we've got pretty good vaccines, as I've just showed you.

132
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So we are trying

133
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to wipe out this virus completely.

134
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
What the polio eradication program is trying to do

135
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is to kill the virus itself

136
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that causes polio

137
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
everywhere on Earth.

138
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Now we don't have a great track record

139
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
when it comes to doing something like this,

140
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
to eradicating diseases.

141
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It's been tried six times in the last century,

142
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and it's been successful exactly once.

143
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And this is because disease eradication,

144
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
it's still the venture capital of public health.

145
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The risks are massive,

146
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but the pay-off --

147
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
economic, humanitarian, motivational --

148
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
it's absolutely huge.

149
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
One congressman here in the United States

150
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
thinks that the entire investment

151
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication

152
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
pays itself off every 26 days --

153
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
in foregone treatment costs

154
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and vaccination costs.

155
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And if we can finish polio eradication,

156
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the poorest countries in the world

157
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
are going to save over 50 billion dollars

158
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
in the next 25 years alone.

159
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So those are the kind of stakes that we're after.

160
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But smallpox eradication was hard;

161
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
it was very, very hard.

162
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And polio eradication, in many ways, is even tougher,

163
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and there's a few reasons for that.

164
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The first is that,

165
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
when we started trying to eradicate polio

166
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
about 20 years ago,

167
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
more than twice as many countries were infected

168
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
than had been when we started off with smallpox.

169
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And there were more than 10 times as many people

170
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
living in these countries.

171
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So it was a massive effort.

172
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The second challenge we had was --

173
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
in contrast to the smallpox vaccine,

174
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
which was very stable, and a single dose protected you for life --

175
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile.

176
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics

177
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that we've had to put this special vaccine monitor

178
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
on every single vial

179
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
so that it will change very quickly

180
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
when it's exposed to too much heat,

181
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and we can tell that it's not a good vaccine to use on a child --

182
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
it's not potent; it's not going to protect them.

183
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Even then, kids need many doses of the vaccine.

184
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But the third challenge we have --

185
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and probably even bigger one, the biggest challenge --

186
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is that, in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy --

187
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
every single person almost who was infected with smallpox

188
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
had this telltale rash.

189
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So you could get around the disease;

190
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off.

191
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
With polio it's almost completely different.

192
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus

193
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
show absolutely no sign of the disease.

194
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So you can't see the enemy most of the time,

195
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and as a result,

196
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
we've needed a very different approach to eradicate polio

197
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
than what was done with smallpox.

198
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
We've had to create

199
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
one of the largest social movements in history.

200
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
There's over 10 million people,

201
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
probably 20 million people,

202
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
largely volunteers,

203
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
who have been working over the last 20 years

204
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
in what has now been called

205
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime.

206
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
These people, these 20 million people,

207
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
vaccinate over 500 million children

208
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
every single year,

209
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
multiple times

210
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
at the peak of our operation.

211
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple.

212
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It's just two drops, like that.

213
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But reaching 500 million people

214
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
is much, much tougher.

215
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And these vaccinators, these volunteers,

216
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
they have got to dive headlong

217
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
into some of the toughest, densest

218
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
urban slums in the world.

219
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They've got to trek under sweltering suns

220
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to some of the most remote, difficult to reach places in the world.

221
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And they also have to dodge bullets,

222
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
because we have got to operate

223
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
during shaky cease-fires and truces

224
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to try and vaccinate children,

225
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
even in areas affected by conflict.

226
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
One reporter

227
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago --

228
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
a place which has eradicated polio,

229
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
not once, but twice, because they got reinfected.

230
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
He was sitting outside of the road,

231
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
watching one of these polio campaigns unfold,

232
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and a few months later he wrote:

233
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
"This is foreign aid at its most heroic."

234
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And these heroes, they come from every walk of life,

235
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
all sorts of backgrounds.

236
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International.

237
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
This is a group

238
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
whose million-strong army of volunteers

239
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
have been working to eradicate polio

240
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
for over 20 years.

241
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
They're right at the center of the whole thing.

242
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure

243
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
for polio eradication --

244
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
more than 15 years, much longer than it should have --

245
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but once it was built, the results were striking.

246
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Within a couple of years,

247
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
every country that started polio eradication

248
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses,

249
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
with the exception of four countries that you see here.

250
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And in each of those, it was only part of the country.

251
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And then, by 1999,

252
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
one of the three polio viruses

253
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that we were trying to eradicate

254
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
had been completely eradicated worldwide --

255
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
proof of concept.

256
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And then today,

257
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
there's been a 99 percent reduction --

258
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
greater than 99 percent reduction --

259
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
in the number of children

260
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
who are being paralyzed by this awful disease.

261
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
When we started, over 20 years ago,

262
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
1,000 children were being paralyzed

263
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
every single day by this virus.

264
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Last year, it was 1,000.

265
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And at the same time,

266
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the polio eradication program

267
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
has been working to help with a lot of other areas.

268
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
It's been working to help control pandemic flu,

269
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
SARS for example.

270
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It's also tried to save children by doing other things --

271
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
giving vitamin A drops, giving measles shots,

272
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
giving bed nets against malaria even

273
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
during some of these campaigns.

274
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But the most exciting thing

275
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that the polio eradication program has been doing

276
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
has been to force us,

277
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
the international community,

278
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to reach every single child, every single community,

279
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
the most vulnerable people in the world,

280
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
with the most basic of health services,

281
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
irrespective of geography, poverty,

282
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
culture and even conflict.

283
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So things were looking very exciting,

284
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and then about five years ago,

285
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
this virus, this ancient virus, started to fight back.

286
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
The first problem we ran into

287
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
was that, in these last four countries, the strongholds of this virus,

288
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
we just couldn't seem to get the virus rooted out.

289
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And then to make the matters even worse,

290
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
the virus started to spread out of these four places,

291
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
especially northern India and northern Nigeria,

292
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
into much of Africa, Asia, and even into Europe,

293
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
causing horrific outbreaks

294
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
in places that had not seen this disease for decades.

295
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And then,

296
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
in one of the most important, tenacious

297
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world,

298
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
we found that our vaccine was working

299
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
half as well as it should have.

300
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
In conditions like this,

301
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
the vaccine just couldn't get the grip it needed to

302
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
in the guts of these children

303
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and protect them the way that it needed to.

304
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Now at that time,

305
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
there was a great, as you can imagine,

306
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
frustration -- let's call it frustration --

307
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
it started to grow very, very quickly.

308
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And all of a sudden, some very important voices

309
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
in the world of public health

310
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
started to say, "Hang on.

311
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We should abandon this idea of eradication.

312
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Let's settle for control -- that's good enough."

313
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds,

314
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
it's a false premise.

315
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
The brutal truth is,

316
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
if we don't have the will or the skill,

317
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
or even the money that we need

318
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
to reach children, the most vulnerable children in the world,

319
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
with something as simple

320
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
as an oral polio vaccine,

321
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
then pretty soon,

322
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
more than 200,000 children

323
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
are again going to be paralyzed by this disease

324
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
every single year.

325
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
There's absolutely no question.

326
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
These are children like Umar.

327
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Umar is seven years old,

328
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and he's from northern Nigeria.

329
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
He lives in a family home there

330
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
with his eight brothers and sisters.

331
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Umar also has polio.

332
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Umar was paralyzed for life.

333
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
His right leg was paralyzed

334
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
in 2004.

335
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
This leg, his right leg,

336
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
now takes an awful beating

337
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
because he has to half-crawl,

338
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
because it's faster to move that way

339
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
to keep up with his friends, keep up with his brothers and sisters,

340
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
than to get up on his crutches and walk.

341
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
But Umar is a fantastic student. He's an incredible kid.

342
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
As you probably can't see the detail here,

343
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
but this is his report card,

344
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and you'll see, he's got perfect scores.

345
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
He got 100 percent in all the important things,

346
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
like nursery rhymes, for example there.

347
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
But you know I'd love to be able to tell you

348
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days,

349
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
but it's not true.

350
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Umar is an exceptional kid

351
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
in exceptional circumstances.

352
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
The reality of polio today

353
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
is something very different.

354
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world.

355
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
It leaves their children paralyzed,

356
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and it drags their families

357
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
deeper into poverty,

358
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
because they're desperately searching

359
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and they're desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have,

360
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
trying in vain

361
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
to find a cure for their children.

362
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We think children deserve better.

363
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And so when the going got really tough

364
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
in the polio eradication program

365
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
about two years ago,

366
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
when people were saying, "We should call it off,"

367
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
the Polio Partnership

368
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
decided to buckle down once again

369
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and try and find innovative new solutions,

370
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
new ways to get to the children

371
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
that we were missing again and again.

372
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
In northern India, we started mapping the cases

373
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
using satellite imaging like this,

374
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters,

375
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
so we could get to the millions of children

376
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
on the Koshi River basin

377
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
where there are no other health services.

378
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
In northern Nigeria,

379
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders,

380
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
they got directly involved in the program

381
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
to help solve the problems of logistics

382
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and community confidence.

383
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And now they've even started using these devices --

384
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
speaking of cool technology --

385
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
these little devices, little GIS trackers like this,

386
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators.

387
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
And then they can track them,

388
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and at the end of the day, they look and see,

389
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
did these guys get every single street, every single house.

390
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
This is the kind of commitment now we're seeing

391
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to try and reach all of the children we've been missing.

392
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And in Afghanistan, we're trying new approaches --

393
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
access negotiators.

394
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
We're working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross

395
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
to ensure that we can reach every child.

396
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
But as we tried these extraordinary things,

397
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
as people went to this trouble

398
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
to try and rework their tactics,

399
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
we went back to the vaccine -- it's a 50-year-old vaccine --

400
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and we thought, surely we can make a better vaccine,

401
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
so that when they finally get to these kids,

402
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
we can have a better bang for our buck.

403
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And this started an incredible collaboration with industry,

404
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and within six months,

405
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
we were testing a new polio vaccine

406
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
that targeted, just two years ago,

407
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
the last two types of polio in the world.

408
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Now June the ninth, 2009,

409
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine,

410
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and it turned out to be a game-changer.

411
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
The new vaccine

412
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses

413
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
as the old vaccine had,

414
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and we immediately started using this.

415
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Well, in a couple of months we had to get it out of production.

416
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And it started rolling off the production lines

417
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and into the mouths of children around the world.

418
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And we didn't start with the easy places.

419
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
The first place this vaccine was used

420
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
was in southern Afghanistan,

421
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
because it's in places like that

422
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
where kids are going to benefit the most

423
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
from technologies like this.

424
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Now here at TED, over the last couple of days,

425
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
I've seen people challenging the audience again and again

426
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
to believe in the impossible.

427
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
So this morning at about seven o'clock,

428
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
I decided that we'd try to drive Chris

429
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and the production crew here berserk

430
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
by downloading all of our data from India again,

431
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
so that you could see something

432
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
that's just unfolding today,

433
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
which proves that the impossible is possible.

434
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
And only two years ago, people were saying that this is impossible.

435
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Now remember, northern India is the perfect storm

436
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
when it comes to polio.

437
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Over 500,000 children

438
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
are born in the two states that have never stopped polio --

439
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Uttar Pradesh and Bihar --

440
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
500,000 children every single month.

441
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
Sanitation is terrible,

442
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and our old vaccine, you remember,

443
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
worked half as well as it should have.

444
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
And yet, the impossible is happening.

445
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Today marks exactly six months --

446
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
and for the first time in history,

447
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
not a single child has been paralyzed

448
0:18:31.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar.

449
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
(Applause)

450
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
India's not unique.

451
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
In Umar's home country of Nigeria,

452
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
a 95 percent reduction

453
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year.

454
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
And in the last six months,

455
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
we've had less places reinfected by polio

456
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
than at any other time in history.

457
0:19:02.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
Ladies and gentlemen, with a combination

458
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
of smart people, smart technology

459
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
and smart investments,

460
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
polio can now be eradicated anywhere.

461
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
We have major challenges, you can imagine,

462
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:16,000
to finish this job,

463
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
but as you've also seen,

464
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
it's doable,

465
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
it has great secondary benefits,

466
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
and polio eradication is a great buy.

467
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
And as long as any child anywhere

468
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
is paralyzed by this virus,

469
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
it's a stark reminder

470
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
that we are failing, as a society, to reach children

471
0:19:35.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
with the most basic of services.

472
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
And for that reason, polio eradication:

473
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:42,000
it's the ultimate in equity

474
0:19:42.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
and it's the ultimate in social justice.

475
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
The huge social movement

476
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:49,000
that's been involved in polio eradication

477
0:19:49.26,000 --> 0:19:51,000
is ready to do way more for these children.

478
0:19:51.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
It's ready to reach them with bed nets, with other things.

479
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
But capitalizing on their enthusiasm,

480
0:19:57.26,000 --> 0:19:59,000
capitalizing on their energy

481
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:01,000
means finishing the job

482
0:20:01.26,000 --> 0:20:04,000
that they started 20 years ago.

483
0:20:04.26,000 --> 0:20:07,000
Finishing polio is a smart thing to do,

484
0:20:07.26,000 --> 0:20:09,000
and it's the right thing to do.

485
0:20:09.26,000 --> 0:20:12,000
Now we're in tough times economically.

486
0:20:12.26,000 --> 0:20:15,000
But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom

487
0:20:15.26,000 --> 0:20:18,000
said about a month ago when he was talking about polio,

488
0:20:18.26,000 --> 0:20:2,000
"There's never a wrong time

489
0:20:20.26,000 --> 0:20:22,000
to do the right thing."

490
0:20:22.26,000 --> 0:20:24,000
Finishing polio eradication

491
0:20:24.26,000 --> 0:20:26,000
is the right thing to do.

492
0:20:26.26,000 --> 0:20:28,000
And we are at a crossroads right now

493
0:20:28.26,000 --> 0:20:3,000
in this great effort over the last 20 years.

494
0:20:30.26,000 --> 0:20:32,000
We have a new vaccine,

495
0:20:32.26,000 --> 0:20:34,000
we have new resolve,

496
0:20:34.26,000 --> 0:20:36,000
and we have new tactics.

497
0:20:36.26,000 --> 0:20:38,000
We have the chance

498
0:20:38.26,000 --> 0:20:41,000
to write an entirely new polio-free chapter

499
0:20:41.26,000 --> 0:20:44,000
in human history.

500
0:20:44.26,000 --> 0:20:47,000
But if we blink now,

501
0:20:47.26,000 --> 0:20:49,000
we will lose forever

502
0:20:49.26,000 --> 0:20:53,000
the chance to eradicate an ancient disease.

503
0:20:54.26,000 --> 0:20:57,000
Here's a great idea to spread:

504
0:20:57.26,000 --> 0:20:59,000
End polio now.

505
0:20:59.26,000 --> 0:21:01,000
Help us tell the story.

506
0:21:01.26,000 --> 0:21:03,000
Help us build the momentum

507
0:21:03.26,000 --> 0:21:05,000
so that very soon

508
0:21:05.26,000 --> 0:21:07,000
every child, every parent

509
0:21:07.26,000 --> 0:21:09,000
everywhere

510
0:21:09.26,000 --> 0:21:11,000
can also take for granted

511
0:21:11.26,000 --> 0:21:14,000
a polio-free life forever.

512
0:21:14.26,000 --> 0:21:16,000
Thank you.

513
0:21:16.26,000 --> 0:21:38,000
(Applause)

514
0:21:38.26,000 --> 0:21:41,000
Bill Gates: Well Bruce, where do you think the toughest places are going to be?

515
0:21:41.26,000 --> 0:21:44,000
Where would you say we need to be the smartest?

516
0:21:44.26,000 --> 0:21:47,000
BA: The four places where you saw, that we've never stopped --

517
0:21:47.26,000 --> 0:21:49,000
northern Nigeria, northern India,

518
0:21:49.26,000 --> 0:21:51,000
the southern corner of Afghanistan

519
0:21:51.26,000 --> 0:21:53,000
and bordering areas of Pakistan --

520
0:21:53.26,000 --> 0:21:55,000
they're going to be the toughest.

521
0:21:55.26,000 --> 0:21:57,000
But the interesting thing is, of those three,

522
0:21:57.26,000 --> 0:21:59,000
India's looking real good, as you just saw in the data.

523
0:21:59.26,000 --> 0:22:01,000
And Afghanistan, Afghanistan, we think

524
0:22:01.26,000 --> 0:22:03,000
has probably stopped polio repeatedly.

525
0:22:03.26,000 --> 0:22:05,000
It keeps getting reinfected.

526
0:22:05.26,000 --> 0:22:07,000
So the tough ones: going to get the top of Nigeria finished

527
0:22:07.26,000 --> 0:22:09,000
and getting Pakistan finished.

528
0:22:09.26,000 --> 0:22:11,000
They're going to be the tough ones.

529
0:22:11.26,000 --> 0:22:13,000
BG: Now what about the money?

530
0:22:13.26,000 --> 0:22:16,000
Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year.

531
0:22:16.26,000 --> 0:22:19,000
And is it easy to raise that money?

532
0:22:19.26,000 --> 0:22:21,000
And what's it going to be like the next couple of years?

533
0:22:21.26,000 --> 0:22:23,000
BA: It's interesting.

534
0:22:23.26,000 --> 0:22:25,000
We spend right now about 750 million

535
0:22:25.26,000 --> 0:22:28,000
to 800 million dollars a year.

536
0:22:28.26,000 --> 0:22:3,000
That's what it costs to reach 500 million children.

537
0:22:30.26,000 --> 0:22:33,000
It sounds like a lot of money; it is a lot of money.

538
0:22:33.26,000 --> 0:22:36,000
But when you're reaching 500 million children multiple times --

539
0:22:36.26,000 --> 0:22:38,000
20, 30 cents to reach a child --

540
0:22:38.26,000 --> 0:22:4,000
that's not very much money.

541
0:22:40.26,000 --> 0:22:42,000
But right now we don't have enough of that.

542
0:22:42.26,000 --> 0:22:44,000
We have a big gap in that money. We're cutting corners,

543
0:22:44.26,000 --> 0:22:46,000
and every time we cut corners,

544
0:22:46.26,000 --> 0:22:49,000
more places get infected that shouldn't have, and it just slows us down.

545
0:22:49.26,000 --> 0:22:52,000
And that great buy costs us a little bit more.

546
0:22:52.26,000 --> 0:22:55,000
BG: Well, hopefully we'll get the word out,

547
0:22:55.26,000 --> 0:22:58,000
and the governments will keep their generosity up.

548
0:22:58.26,000 --> 0:23:,000
So good luck. We're all in this with you.

549
0:23:00.26,000 --> 0:23:02,000
Thank you. (BA: Thank you.)

550
0:23:02.26,000 --> 0:23:04,000
(Applause)

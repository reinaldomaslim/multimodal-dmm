1
0:00:06.58,000 --> 0:00:11,000
is it possible to experience the

2
0:00:08.86,000 --> 0:00:14,000
stratosphere is it possible to build a

3
0:00:12.129,000 --> 0:00:18,000
system to go into the stratosphere we

4
0:00:14.889,000 --> 0:00:17,000
proceeded to do just that

5
0:00:22.71,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I can guarantee that in the next

6
0:00:25.32,000 --> 0:00:29,000
generation of space telescopes we will

7
0:00:27.269,000 --> 0:00:31,000
have the capability to find and identify

8
0:00:29.97,000 --> 0:00:32,000
other Earth's

9
0:00:31.5,000 --> 0:00:34,000
what Mayton blazed are so special is

10
0:00:33.809,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that they're some of the universe's most

11
0:00:35.309,000 --> 0:00:38,000
efficient particle accelerators

12
0:00:37.019,000 --> 0:00:44,000
transporting incredible amounts of

13
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:47,000
energy throughout a galaxy now we were

14
0:00:44.22,000 --> 0:00:49,000
inspired by the Terminator 2 scene

15
0:00:47.12,000 --> 0:00:52,000
41,000 and we fought why couldn't a 3d

16
0:00:50.19,000 --> 0:00:54,000
printer operate in this fashion arise

17
0:00:52.649,000 --> 0:00:56,000
out of a puddle in essentially real time

18
0:00:55.17,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to make a great object

19
0:00:57.059,000 --> 0:01:01,000
it's called CRISPR cast line the CRISPR

20
0:00:59.55,000 --> 0:01:04,000
technology allows scientists to make

21
0:01:01.92,000 --> 0:01:06,000
changes to the DNA in cells that could

22
0:01:04.89,000 --> 0:01:09,000
allow us to cure genetic disease so what

23
0:01:07.74,000 --> 0:01:11,000
we found is that an old mouse that gets

24
0:01:10.77,000 --> 0:01:14,000
young blood through the shared

25
0:01:12.72,000 --> 0:01:18,000
circulation looks younger and functions

26
0:01:15.69,000 --> 0:01:18,000
younger in its brain

27
0:01:20.06,000 --> 0:01:24,000
we looked for the possibility of

28
0:01:21.74,000 --> 0:01:26,000
creating life-sustaining clothing for

29
0:01:24.65,000 --> 0:01:29,000
interplanetary voyages this wearable

30
0:01:27.32,000 --> 0:01:33,000
digestive system when it stretched

31
0:01:30.11,000 --> 0:01:35,000
end to end it spans 60 meters and here

32
0:01:33.35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
it is for the first time unveiled at Ted

33
0:01:35.36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
our first photosynthetic wearable liquid

34
0:01:38.24,000 --> 0:01:45,000
channels glowing with life inside a

35
0:01:39.92,000 --> 0:01:46,000
wearable clothing what if our technology

36
0:01:45.46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
could sense our emotions what if my

37
0:01:47.84,000 --> 0:01:51,000
devices could sense how we felt and

38
0:01:49.79,000 --> 0:01:53,000
reacted accordingly just the way an

39
0:01:52.13,000 --> 0:01:56,000
emotionally intelligent friend would we

40
0:01:54.259,000 --> 0:01:59,000
just start to scratch the surface of the

41
0:01:57.11,000 --> 0:02:02,000
true power of virtual reality

42
0:01:59.479,000 --> 0:02:03,000
it connects humans to other humans in a

43
0:02:02.42,000 --> 0:02:06,000
profound way that I've never seen before

44
0:02:04.28,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and any other form of media as I'm

45
0:02:06.56,000 --> 0:02:11,000
speaking my sound is getting captured by

46
0:02:09.35,000 --> 0:02:14,000
the tablet and then it's getting mapped

47
0:02:11.84,000 --> 0:02:17,000
onto a vest that's covered in vibratory

48
0:02:15.14,000 --> 0:02:22,000
motors and I'm wearing the vest right

49
0:02:17.93,000 --> 0:02:24,000
now so as I'm speaking I'm feeling the

50
0:02:22.34,000 --> 0:02:27,000
sonic world around me we've been testing

51
0:02:25.34,000 --> 0:02:29,000
this with deaf people now and it turns

52
0:02:27.769,000 --> 0:02:31,000
out that after just a little bit of time

53
0:02:29.87,000 --> 0:02:34,000
people can start feeling they can start

54
0:02:32.39,000 --> 0:02:37,000
understanding the language of the vest

55
0:02:34.94,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we do 3 million miles of testing in our

56
0:02:37.549,000 --> 0:02:41,000
simulators every single day so you can

57
0:02:40.459,000 --> 0:02:43,000
imagine the experience our vehicles have

58
0:02:42.019,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we are looking forward to having this

59
0:02:43.85,000 --> 0:02:47,000
technology on the road how soon can we

60
0:02:45.83,000 --> 0:02:49,000
bring it out these are my two boys my

61
0:02:48.5,000 --> 0:02:51,000
oldest son is 11 and that means in four

62
0:02:50.69,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and a half years he's going to be able

63
0:02:52.31,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to get his driver's license my team and

64
0:02:54.53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I are committed to making sure that

65
0:02:55.489,000 --> 0:02:59,000
doesn't happen

66
0:02:56.299,000 --> 0:02:59,000
okay so relax don't hit it

67
0:03:01.23,000 --> 0:03:06,000
right now your brain is controlling your

68
0:03:04.659,000 --> 0:03:07,000
arm and it's also controlling his arm so

69
0:03:06.519,000 --> 0:03:12,000
go ahead and just do it one more time

70
0:03:07.78,000 --> 0:03:14,000
it says perfect machine intelligence is

71
0:03:12.939,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the last invention that humanity will

72
0:03:15.04,000 --> 0:03:18,000
ever need to make the machines would

73
0:03:17.17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
them be better at the bending than we

74
0:03:18.489,000 --> 0:03:21,000
are we should not be confident in our

75
0:03:20.439,000 --> 0:03:23,000
ability to keep a superintelligence

76
0:03:21.819,000 --> 0:03:25,000
genie locked up in its bottle forever

77
0:03:24.34,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the answer here is to figure out how to

78
0:03:26.799,000 --> 0:03:31,000
create super intelligent AI such that

79
0:03:28.719,000 --> 0:03:33,000
even if when it escaped it is still safe

80
0:03:32.379,000 --> 0:03:36,000
because it is fundamentally on our side

81
0:03:34.569,000 --> 0:03:39,000
because it shares our values the Islamic

82
0:03:36.819,000 --> 0:03:42,000
state beheadings are not ancient or

83
0:03:39.969,000 --> 0:03:44,000
remote they're entirely dependent on the

84
0:03:43.06,000 --> 0:03:49,000
power of technology to connect us there

85
0:03:45.939,000 --> 0:03:51,000
is a very personal price to public

86
0:03:49.209,000 --> 0:03:56,000
humiliation and the growth of the

87
0:03:52.48,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Internet has jacked up that price

88
0:03:58.49,000 --> 0:04:02,000
when we say that black lives matter it's

89
0:04:00.92,000 --> 0:04:03,000
not because others don't it's simply

90
0:04:02.63,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because we must affirm that we are

91
0:04:04.07,000 --> 0:04:08,000
worthy of existing without fear when so

92
0:04:06.35,000 --> 0:04:1,000
many things tell us we are not I want to

93
0:04:08.39,000 --> 0:04:11,000
live in a world where my son will not be

94
0:04:10.46,000 --> 0:04:13,000
presumed guilty the moment he is born

95
0:04:12.14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
where a toy in his hand isn't mistaken

96
0:04:14.39,000 --> 0:04:17,000
for anything other than a toy can we

97
0:04:16.55,000 --> 0:04:21,000
imagine in a criminal justice system

98
0:04:18.38,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that prioritizes recovery prevention

99
0:04:21.56,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Civic inclusion rather than punishment a

100
0:04:24.74,000 --> 0:04:28,000
criminal justice system that believes in

101
0:04:27.29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
black young people rather than treating

102
0:04:29.69,000 --> 0:04:32,000
black young people as the enemy to be

103
0:04:31.67,000 --> 0:04:35,000
rounded up if you are fleeing a war zone

104
0:04:33.59,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a better life is alive in safety its

105
0:04:36.2,000 --> 0:04:41,000
life in dignity a better life means not

106
0:04:39.17,000 --> 0:04:43,000
having a house bombs not fearing being

107
0:04:41.24,000 --> 0:04:45,000
kidnapped it means being able to send a

108
0:04:43.28,000 --> 0:04:47,000
children to school or just find work to

109
0:04:45.77,000 --> 0:04:48,000
be able to provide for yourself and the

110
0:04:47.42,000 --> 0:04:5,000
ones you love there are still tragedies

111
0:04:49.37,000 --> 0:04:53,000
that happen in the bumpy road to

112
0:04:50.99,000 --> 0:04:55,000
equality but there are also stories of

113
0:04:53.54,000 --> 0:04:58,000
hope and courage in every corner of the

114
0:04:56.93,000 --> 0:05:,000
world

115
0:04:58.88,000 --> 0:05:02,000
unconscious bias is not the same as

116
0:05:01.199,000 --> 0:05:04,000
conscious discrimination I'm not saying

117
0:05:02.91,000 --> 0:05:06,000
that in all of you there's a secret

118
0:05:04.47,000 --> 0:05:09,000
sexist or racist or urges like lurking

119
0:05:07.41,000 --> 0:05:11,000
within waiting to get out bias is not an

120
0:05:09.6,000 --> 0:05:13,000
accusation rather it's something that

121
0:05:11.699,000 --> 0:05:15,000
has to be identified acknowledged and

122
0:05:13.979,000 --> 0:05:19,000
mitigated against we have to start

123
0:05:16.62,000 --> 0:05:21,000
making stopping violence indispensable

124
0:05:20.31,000 --> 0:05:23,000
to the fight against poverty in fact any

125
0:05:22.38,000 --> 0:05:25,000
conversation about global poverty that

126
0:05:24.18,000 --> 0:05:28,000
doesn't include the problem of violence

127
0:05:25.77,000 --> 0:05:3,000
must be deemed not serious the quarter

128
0:05:28.68,000 --> 0:05:33,000
truths and limited plot lines have us

129
0:05:30.9,000 --> 0:05:34,000
convinced that poor people are a problem

130
0:05:33.78,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that needs fixing what if we realized

131
0:05:35.82,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that the experts we are looking for the

132
0:05:38.43,000 --> 0:05:44,000
experts we need to follow are poor

133
0:05:40.56,000 --> 0:05:46,000
people themselves these big issues that

134
0:05:45.419,000 --> 0:05:49,000
will change the world change national

135
0:05:47.52,000 --> 0:05:53,000
security change economics create hope

136
0:05:50.099,000 --> 0:05:56,000
create threats can only be resolved when

137
0:05:54.12,000 --> 0:05:58,000
you bring together groups of people who

138
0:05:56.43,000 --> 0:06:,000
understand science and technology back

139
0:05:58.8,000 --> 0:06:02,000
together with government we won't solve

140
0:06:00.96,000 --> 0:06:05,000
our problems if we expect it to be

141
0:06:03.599,000 --> 0:06:11,000
solved by a few Superman or super women

142
0:06:06.63,000 --> 0:06:13,000
now we need everybody everybody

143
0:06:12.18,000 --> 0:06:15,000
underestimates how often they laugh when

144
0:06:14.25,000 --> 0:06:18,000
you laugh with people that's actually

145
0:06:16.139,000 --> 0:06:21,000
letting you access a really ancient

146
0:06:18.51,000 --> 0:06:22,000
evolutionary system to regulate emotions

147
0:06:21.63,000 --> 0:06:25,000
to make ourselves feel better some

148
0:06:23.159,000 --> 0:06:27,000
affairs add bethe nails for

149
0:06:25.77,000 --> 0:06:3,000
relationships that were already dying on

150
0:06:27.72,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the vine but others will jolt us into

151
0:06:31.08,000 --> 0:06:37,000
new possibilities the opposite of

152
0:06:33.75,000 --> 0:06:41,000
addiction is not sobriety the opposite

153
0:06:37.65,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of addiction is connection

154
0:06:42.5,000 --> 0:06:47,000
for most people the scariest thing about

155
0:06:44.21,000 --> 0:06:52,000
death isn't being dead it's dying I am

156
0:06:48.08,000 --> 0:06:54,000
asking we make space physical psychic

157
0:06:52.22,000 --> 0:06:58,000
room to allow life to play itself all

158
0:06:54.59,000 --> 0:07:,000
the way out so that rather than just

159
0:06:58.61,000 --> 0:07:02,000
getting out of the way aging and dying

160
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
can become a process of crescendo

161
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
through to the end

162
0:07:07.35,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I've learned about the poetry and the

163
0:07:09.84,000 --> 0:07:12,000
wisdom and the grace that can be found

164
0:07:11.85,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in the words of people all around us

165
0:07:13.62,000 --> 0:07:17,000
when we simply take the time to listen

166
0:07:16.14,000 --> 0:07:21,000
you might have noticed that I don't have

167
0:07:18.36,000 --> 0:07:24,000
much inflection in my voice that's why

168
0:07:21.24,000 --> 0:07:28,000
people often confuse me with the GPS I

169
0:07:24.41,000 --> 0:07:29,000
am a bad feminist I am a good woman I am

170
0:07:28.44,000 --> 0:07:32,000
trying to become better and how I think

171
0:07:30.18,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and what I say and what I do without

172
0:07:33.03,000 --> 0:07:37,000
abandoning everything that makes me

173
0:07:34.98,000 --> 0:07:4,000
human the tool was bought four days in

174
0:07:37.17,000 --> 0:07:46,000
your life the day you're born and they

175
0:07:41.55,000 --> 0:07:48,000
do discover why and sound is so powerful

176
0:07:46.83,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that it could either disempower me and

177
0:07:49.23,000 --> 0:07:55,000
my artwork or it could empower me I

178
0:07:53.48,000 --> 0:07:57,000
chose to be empowered

179
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
maybe these conversations will remind us

180
0:07:57.48,000 --> 0:08:03,000
what's really important and maybe just

181
0:08:01.59,000 --> 0:08:06,000
maybe it will help us recognize that

182
0:08:04.11,000 --> 0:08:1,000
simple truth that every life every

183
0:08:07.07,000 --> 0:08:13,000
single life matters equally and

184
0:08:10.85,000 --> 0:08:13,000
infinitely

2
0:00:13.31,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So I'd like you to join me on a field trip,

3
0:00:15.76,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I want to go to the beach and take you all to the beach

4
0:00:18.586,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and so enjoy the sea air and the salt spray.

5
0:00:20.826,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And let's go down to the water's edge,

6
0:00:23.06,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and you'll notice we're getting knocked around by the waves,

7
0:00:25.864,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and it's really difficult to stay in place, right?

8
0:00:28.441,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But now, look down,

9
0:00:30.699,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and what you're going to see

10
0:00:32.095,000 --> 0:00:34,000
is that the rocks are covered by all sorts of sea creatures

11
0:00:35.041,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that are just staying there in place, no problem.

12
0:00:37.351,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It turns out that if you want to survive in this really demanding environment,

13
0:00:41.63,000 --> 0:00:46,000
your very existence is dependent upon your ability to make glue, actually.

14
0:00:46.736,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So let me introduce you to some of the heroes of our story,

15
0:00:50.04,000 --> 0:00:51,000
just a few of them.

16
0:00:51.5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So these are mussels,

17
0:00:52.623,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and you'll notice they're covering the rocks,

18
0:00:54.937,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and what they've done is made adhesives,

19
0:00:56.96,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and they're sticking down on the rocks,

20
0:00:58.939,000 --> 0:01:,000
and they're sticking to each other, actually.

21
0:01:01.058,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So they're hunkered down together as a group.

22
0:01:03.667,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This is a close-up photograph of an oyster reef,

23
0:01:06.431,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and oysters, they're amazing.

24
0:01:08.581,000 --> 0:01:1,000
What they do is they cement to each other,

25
0:01:11.707,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and they build these huge, extensive reef systems.

26
0:01:14.523,000 --> 0:01:16,000
They can be kilometers long, they can be meters deep,

27
0:01:17.115,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and arguably, they are the most dominant influence

28
0:01:20.751,000 --> 0:01:22,000
on how healthy any coastal marine ecosystem is going to be

29
0:01:23.601,000 --> 0:01:25,000
because what they do is they're filtering the water constantly,

30
0:01:26.558,000 --> 0:01:27,000
they're holding sand and dirt in place.

31
0:01:28.439,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Actually, other species live inside of these reefs.

32
0:01:31.461,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And then, if you think about what happens when a storm comes in,

33
0:01:34.843,000 --> 0:01:38,000
if the storm surge first has to hit miles of these reefs,

34
0:01:38.861,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the coast behind it is going to be protected.

35
0:01:40.981,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So they're really quite influential.

36
0:01:43.679,000 --> 0:01:46,000
If you've been to any rocky beach pretty much anywhere in the world,

37
0:01:46.929,000 --> 0:01:48,000
you're probably familiar with what barnacles look like.

38
0:01:49.51,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And so what these animals do -

39
0:01:50.944,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and there's many others, these are just three of them -

40
0:01:53.621,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is they make adhesives,

41
0:01:54.752,000 --> 0:01:57,000
they stick to each other and to the rocks and they build communities,

42
0:01:57.992,000 --> 0:02:,000
and by doing this, there's a lot of survival advantages they get.

43
0:02:01.631,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So one of them is that just any individual is subjected to less of the turbulence

44
0:02:07.54,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and all the damaging features that can happen from that environment.

45
0:02:11.203,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So they're all hunkered down there.

46
0:02:12.94,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Then, also, there's a safety in numbers thing

47
0:02:16.049,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because it also helps you keep away the predators,

48
0:02:19.241,000 --> 0:02:21,000
because if, say, a seagull wants to pick you up and eat you,

49
0:02:22.073,000 --> 0:02:24,000
it's more difficult for the seagull if they're stuck together.

50
0:02:24.994,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And then another thing is it also helps with reproductive efficiency.

51
0:02:28.69,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So you can imagine that when Mr. and Mrs. Barnacle decide,

52
0:02:32.147,000 --> 0:02:34,000
"OK, it's time to have little baby barnacles" -

53
0:02:34.35,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I won't tell you how they do that just yet -

54
0:02:36.769,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but when they decide it's time to do that,

55
0:02:39.17,000 --> 0:02:4,000
it's a lot easier,

56
0:02:40.3,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and their reproductive efficiency's higher if they're all living close together.

57
0:02:44.918,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So we want to understand how they do this:

58
0:02:48.722,000 --> 0:02:49,000
How do they stick?

59
0:02:49.766,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And I can't really tell you all the details,

60
0:02:51.819,000 --> 0:02:53,000
because we're still trying to figure it out,

61
0:02:53.918,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but let me give you a little flavor

62
0:02:56.07,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of some of the things that we're trying to do.

63
0:02:58.262,000 --> 0:03:01,000
This is a picture of one of the aquarium systems we have in our lab,

64
0:03:02.221,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and everything in the image is part of the system,

65
0:03:05.379,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and so what we do is we keep -

66
0:03:07.361,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and you can see in the glass tank there, at the bottom, a bunch of mussels.

67
0:03:10.89,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We have the water chilled, we have the lights cycled,

68
0:03:13.549,000 --> 0:03:15,000
we actually have turbulence in the system

69
0:03:15.581,000 --> 0:03:17,000
because the animals make more adhesives for us

70
0:03:17.9,000 --> 0:03:18,000
when the water is turbulent.

71
0:03:19.44,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So we induce them to make the adhesive,

72
0:03:21.34,000 --> 0:03:22,000
we collect it, we study it.

73
0:03:23.24,000 --> 0:03:24,000
They're here in Indiana;

74
0:03:24.87,000 --> 0:03:26,000
as far as they know, they're in Maine in February,

75
0:03:27.673,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and they seem to be pretty happy, as far as we can tell.

76
0:03:30.79,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And then we also work with oysters,

77
0:03:32.77,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and up top, it's a photo of a small reef in South Carolina,

78
0:03:37.759,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and what we're most interested in is how they attach to each other,

79
0:03:41.08,000 --> 0:03:42,000
how they connect.

80
0:03:42.09,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So what you can see in the bottom image is two oysters cementing to each other.

81
0:03:46.731,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We want to know what's in between,

82
0:03:48.361,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and so a lot of times, we'll cut them and look down,

83
0:03:50.923,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and in the next series of images we have here,

84
0:03:53.52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
you can see, on the bottom, we'll have two shells,

85
0:03:56.13,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the shell of one animal and the shell of another animal,

86
0:03:58.773,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and the cement's in between.

87
0:04:00.15,000 --> 0:04:01,000
If you look at the image on the right,

88
0:04:01.958,000 --> 0:04:02,000
what you can maybe see

89
0:04:03.49,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is that there's structure in the shell of each animal,

90
0:04:06.98,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but then, the cement actually looks different.

91
0:04:09.137,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And so we're using all sorts of fancy biology and chemistry tools

92
0:04:13.115,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to understand what's going on in there,

93
0:04:14.991,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and what we're finding is the structures are different

94
0:04:17.527,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and the chemistry is actually different, and it's quite interesting.

95
0:04:22.731,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And in this picture -

96
0:04:24.161,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I guess, let me step back before I tell you what this is.

97
0:04:27.309,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So do you know the cartoon "The Magic School Bus"?

98
0:04:32.38,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Or if you're a little bit older, "Fantastic Voyage," right?

99
0:04:35.49,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And you remember, they had characters

100
0:04:37.299,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that they would shrink down to these microscopic levels,

101
0:04:39.92,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and then they would sort of swirl in

102
0:04:41.96,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and swim around and fly around all these biological structures?

103
0:04:45.063,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I think of this as like that, except for it's real in this case.

104
0:04:49.28,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And so what we did is we have two oysters that are stuck together,

105
0:04:54.04,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and this area used to be completely filled in with the cement,

106
0:04:57.271,000 --> 0:05:,000
and what we're finding is that the cement has lots of different components in there,

107
0:05:01.231,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but broadly speaking, there are hard, non-sticky parts

108
0:05:04.44,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and there are soft, sticky parts,

109
0:05:06.031,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and what we did is we removed the non-sticky parts selectively

110
0:05:09.019,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to see what's left -

111
0:05:10.389,000 --> 0:05:12,000
for what's actually attaching the animals -

112
0:05:12.6,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and what we got is this,

113
0:05:13.759,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and we can see there's a sticky adhesive that's holding them together.

114
0:05:17.36,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And I just think it's a really cool image

115
0:05:19.389,000 --> 0:05:22,000
because you can imagine yourself flying in and going back there.

116
0:05:22.459,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Anyways, those are some of the things we're doing to understand

117
0:05:25.619,000 --> 0:05:27,000
how marine biology is making these materials.

118
0:05:28.61,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And from a fundamental perspective, it's really exciting to learn.

119
0:05:32.018,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But what do we want to do with this information?

120
0:05:34.271,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Well, there's a lot of technological applications

121
0:05:36.65,000 --> 0:05:38,000
if we can harness what the animals are doing.

122
0:05:39.34,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So let me give you one example.

123
0:05:41.182,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So imagine you're at home

124
0:05:43.185,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and you break your favorite figurine or a mug or something like that.

125
0:05:46.817,000 --> 0:05:47,000
You want to put it back together.

126
0:05:48.44,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So where do you go?

127
0:05:49.56,000 --> 0:05:51,000
You go to my favorite place in town,

128
0:05:52.183,000 --> 0:05:54,000
which is the glue aisle of the hardware store.

129
0:05:54.983,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I know where you spend your nights

130
0:05:56.951,000 --> 0:05:58,000
because you're all hip, cool people, because you're here,

131
0:05:59.631,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and you're going to bars and concerts -

132
0:06:01.96,000 --> 0:06:02,000
this is where I hang out every night.

133
0:06:03.73,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So anyways,

134
0:06:04.744,000 --> 0:06:07,000
so what I want you to do is get one of every adhesive that's on the shelf,

135
0:06:08.496,000 --> 0:06:09,000
bring it home,

136
0:06:09.544,000 --> 0:06:11,000
but before you try to put things back together,

137
0:06:12.47,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I want you to try to do it in a bucket of water.

138
0:06:15.369,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's won't work, right? We all know this.

139
0:06:17.491,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So obviously, marine biology has solved this,

140
0:06:19.89,000 --> 0:06:23,000
so what we need to do is figure out ways to be able to copy this ourselves.

141
0:06:24.811,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And one of the issues here

142
0:06:26.364,000 --> 0:06:28,000
is you can't just go and get the materials from the beach,

143
0:06:29.29,000 --> 0:06:32,000
because if you get some mussels and try to milk them for their adhesive,

144
0:06:32.727,000 --> 0:06:33,000
you'll get a little bit of material,

145
0:06:34.45,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but you're never going to have enough to do anything with, just enough to see.

146
0:06:38.149,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We need to scale this up, ideally maybe train-car scale.

147
0:06:41.722,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So on the top is an image of one of the types of molecules

148
0:06:45.709,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that the animals use to make their glue,

149
0:06:47.729,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and what they are is very long molecules called proteins,

150
0:06:50.927,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and these proteins happen to have some fairly unique parts in them

151
0:06:54.956,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that bring about the adhesive properties.

152
0:06:57.744,000 --> 0:06:59,000
What we want to do is take those little parts of that chemistry,

153
0:07:00.742,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and we want to put it into other long molecules that we can get,

154
0:07:04.173,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but that we can make on a really large scale,

155
0:07:06.563,000 --> 0:07:08,000
so you might know them as plastics or polymers,

156
0:07:08.756,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and so we're sort of simplifying what they do

157
0:07:11.093,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but then putting that adhesion chemistry into these large molecules.

158
0:07:14.377,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And we've developed many different adhesive systems in doing this.

159
0:07:17.504,000 --> 0:07:2,000
When you make a new adhesive that looks pretty good, what do you do?

160
0:07:20.713,000 --> 0:07:23,000
You start running around the lab, just sticking stuff together.

161
0:07:23.773,000 --> 0:07:26,000
In this case, we took a bit of a glue and glued together two pieces of metal.

162
0:07:27.633,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We hung something from it to see what it looked like,

163
0:07:30.132,000 --> 0:07:33,000
so we used a pot of live mussels, and we thought we were very clever.

164
0:07:33.614,000 --> 0:07:34,000
(Laughs)

165
0:07:34.621,000 --> 0:07:37,000
We're obviously much more quantitative about this most often,

166
0:07:37.623,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and so we benchmark against commercial adhesives,

167
0:07:39.992,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and we actually have some materials now that are stronger than superglue.

168
0:07:44.013,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So to me, that's really cool.

169
0:07:45.419,000 --> 0:07:48,000
That's a good day in the lab: it's stronger than superglue.

170
0:07:48.428,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And here's something else that we can do.

171
0:07:51.084,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So this is a tank of seawater,

172
0:07:53.219,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and then in that syringe is one of our adhesive formulations.

173
0:07:56.992,000 --> 0:07:59,000
What we're doing is we're dispensing it completely underwater

174
0:08:00.302,000 --> 0:08:01,000
on a piece of metal.

175
0:08:01.612,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And then we want to make an adhesive bond, or joint.

176
0:08:04.153,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So we take another piece of metal,

177
0:08:06.596,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and we put it on there and just position it.

178
0:08:09.543,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And you want to let it set up for a while, give it a chance,

179
0:08:13.321,000 --> 0:08:15,000
so we'll just put a weight on it, nothing fancy.

180
0:08:15.57,000 --> 0:08:18,000
This is a tube with lead shot in it, nothing fancy.

181
0:08:18.753,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And then you let it sit for a while.

182
0:08:20.692,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So this has never seen air; it's completely underwater.

183
0:08:23.397,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And you pick it up.

184
0:08:24.711,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I never know what's going to happen; I'm always very anxious here.

185
0:08:28.042,000 --> 0:08:29,000
You pick it up ...

186
0:08:29.892,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and it stuck.

187
0:08:31.277,000 --> 0:08:32,000
To me, this is really cool.

188
0:08:32.822,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So we can actually get very strong underwater adhesion.

189
0:08:36.522,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Possibly, it's the strongest or one of the strongest underwater adhesives

190
0:08:40.087,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that's ever been seen.

191
0:08:41.572,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It's even stronger than the materials that the animals produce,

192
0:08:44.538,000 --> 0:08:46,000
so for us, it's pretty exciting, it's pretty cool.

193
0:08:47.223,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So what do we want to do with these things?

194
0:08:49.922,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Well, here are some products that you're probably really familiar with.

195
0:08:53.257,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So think about your cell phone, your laptop, plywood in most structures,

196
0:08:58.043,000 --> 0:09:01,000
the interior of your car, shoes, phone books - things like this.

197
0:09:01.469,000 --> 0:09:03,000
They're all held together with adhesives,

198
0:09:04.058,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and there's two main problems

199
0:09:05.662,000 --> 0:09:07,000
with the adhesives used in these materials.

200
0:09:07.702,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The first one is that they're toxic.

201
0:09:09.762,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So the worst offender here is plywood.

202
0:09:12.122,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Plywood or a lot of furniture or wood laminate in floors -

203
0:09:17.163,000 --> 0:09:2,000
a main component of the adhesives here is formaldehyde,

204
0:09:20.451,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and it's maybe a compound you've heard of.

205
0:09:22.465,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It's a gas, and it's also a carcinogen,

206
0:09:25.298,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and so we're constructing a lot of structures from these adhesives,

207
0:09:29.201,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and we're also breathing a lot of this carcinogen.

208
0:09:31.567,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So not good, obviously, right?

209
0:09:33.312,000 --> 0:09:35,000
The other issue is that these adhesives are all permanent.

210
0:09:36.118,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And so what do you do with your shoes or your car or even your laptop

211
0:09:39.386,000 --> 0:09:41,000
at the end of life, when you're done using it?

212
0:09:41.598,000 --> 0:09:43,000
For the most part, they end up in landfills.

213
0:09:43.656,000 --> 0:09:44,000
There's precious materials in there

214
0:09:45.372,000 --> 0:09:47,000
we'd love to be able to get out and recycle them,

215
0:09:47.692,000 --> 0:09:48,000
but we can't do it so easily,

216
0:09:49.153,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because they're all stuck together permanently, right?

217
0:09:51.695,000 --> 0:09:55,000
So here's one approach we're taking to try and solve some of these problems,

218
0:09:55.942,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and what we've done here is we've taken another long molecule

219
0:10:00.782,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that we can actually get from corn,

220
0:10:02.519,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and then into that molecule,

221
0:10:03.947,000 --> 0:10:05,000
we've put some of the adhesion chemistry from the mussels.

222
0:10:06.655,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So because we've got the corn and we've got the mussels,

223
0:10:09.282,000 --> 0:10:11,000
we call this our surf-and-turf polymer.

224
0:10:11.681,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And it sticks. It sticks really well.

225
0:10:13.83,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It's very strong.

226
0:10:15.022,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It's also bio-based. That's nice.

227
0:10:16.922,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But maybe more importantly, here, it's also degradable;

228
0:10:20.026,000 --> 0:10:22,000
we can degrade it under very mild conditions,

229
0:10:22.299,000 --> 0:10:23,000
just with water.

230
0:10:23.313,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And so what we can do is we can set things up

231
0:10:25.483,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and we can bond them strongly when we want,

232
0:10:27.654,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but we can also take them apart when we want.

233
0:10:29.921,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It's something we're thinking about.

234
0:10:31.657,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And here is a place where a lot of us want to be.

235
0:10:35.23,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Actually, in this specific case, this is a place we do not want to be,

236
0:10:38.594,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but we'd like to replace this.

237
0:10:40.043,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So sutures, staples, screws:

238
0:10:42.674,000 --> 0:10:45,000
this is how we put you back together if you've had some surgery or an injury.

239
0:10:46.292,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It's just awful. It hurts.

240
0:10:48.468,000 --> 0:10:49,000
In the case of the sutures,

241
0:10:50.1,000 --> 0:10:55,000
look at how much you're making concentrated, mechanical stresses

242
0:10:55.193,000 --> 0:10:56,000
as you pull things together;

243
0:10:56.524,000 --> 0:10:57,000
you're making sites for infection;

244
0:10:58.888,000 --> 0:11:,000
poke holes in healthy tissue - it's not so good.

245
0:11:01.63,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Or if you need a plate to hold together your bones,

246
0:11:04.433,000 --> 0:11:06,000
look at how much healthy bone you have to drill out

247
0:11:06.815,000 --> 0:11:08,000
just to hold the plate in place - so this is awful.

248
0:11:09.192,000 --> 0:11:12,000
To me, it looks like these were devised in a medieval torture chamber,

249
0:11:12.502,000 --> 0:11:13,000
but it's our modern surgical joinery.

250
0:11:14.413,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So I'd love it if we'd get to a place where we can replace systems like this

251
0:11:18.146,000 --> 0:11:19,000
with adhesives, right?

252
0:11:20.429,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It's not easy.

253
0:11:21.439,000 --> 0:11:23,000
We're working on this, but this is not easy.

254
0:11:23.486,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So think about what you would need for adhesives in these cases.

255
0:11:26.566,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So first of all,

256
0:11:28.004,000 --> 0:11:31,000
you would need an adhesive that will set in a wet environment.

257
0:11:31.042,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And if you look at the silly little picture there,

258
0:11:33.419,000 --> 0:11:37,000
it's just to illustrate that our bodies are about 60 percent water,

259
0:11:38.089,000 --> 0:11:39,000
so it's a wet environment.

260
0:11:39.342,000 --> 0:11:43,000
It's also to illustrate that this is why I am a scientist and not an artist.

261
0:11:43.952,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I did not miss my calling at all.

262
0:11:46.632,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So then, the other requirements you need for a good biomedical adhesive:

263
0:11:50.13,000 --> 0:11:52,000
it needs to bond strongly, of course,

264
0:11:52.95,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and it needs to not be toxic.

265
0:11:54.458,000 --> 0:11:55,000
You don't want to hurt the patients.

266
0:11:56.17,000 --> 0:12:,000
And getting any two of those requirements in a material is pretty easy.

267
0:12:00.183,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It's been done many times.

268
0:12:01.497,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But getting all three hasn't been done; it's very hard.

269
0:12:04.092,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And then if you talk to surgeons, they get really picky:

270
0:12:06.753,000 --> 0:12:09,000
"Oh, actually I want the adhesive to set on the same time frame as the surgery."

271
0:12:10.592,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Oh, okay.

272
0:12:11.602,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Or, "Oh, I want the adhesive to degrade

273
0:12:13.832,000 --> 0:12:16,000
so the patient's tissues can remodel the site."

274
0:12:16.852,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So this is really hard. We're working on it.

275
0:12:20.282,000 --> 0:12:21,000
This is just one image we have.

276
0:12:21.874,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So we're getting all sorts of bones and skin and soft tissue and hard tissue,

277
0:12:26.153,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and sometimes we'll whack it with a hammer.

278
0:12:28.161,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Usually, we're cutting it in very precise shapes;

279
0:12:30.448,000 --> 0:12:31,000
then we glue them back together.

280
0:12:32.003,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We've got some exciting results, some strong materials,

281
0:12:34.624,000 --> 0:12:36,000
some things that look like they're not toxic.

282
0:12:36.73,000 --> 0:12:37,000
They set wet, looks pretty good,

283
0:12:38.282,000 --> 0:12:4,000
but I won't tell you we've solved the wet-adhesion problem,

284
0:12:41.06,000 --> 0:12:42,000
because we haven't,

285
0:12:42.252,000 --> 0:12:44,000
but it's certainly in our sights for the future.

286
0:12:44.696,000 --> 0:12:49,000
So that's one place that we'd like to see things go farther down the road.

287
0:12:49.833,000 --> 0:12:51,000
There's lots of other places, too, you can imagine,

288
0:12:52.212,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we might be better off if we could get more adhesives in there.

289
0:12:55.163,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So one thing is cosmetics.

290
0:12:56.565,000 --> 0:13:,000
So if you think about people putting on fake nails or eyelash extensions here -

291
0:13:00.973,000 --> 0:13:01,000
like this -

292
0:13:02.425,000 --> 0:13:02,000
what do they use?

293
0:13:03.367,000 --> 0:13:05,000
They use very toxic adhesives right now.

294
0:13:05.642,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So it's just ripe for replacement.

295
0:13:07.423,000 --> 0:13:08,000
That's something we'd like to do.

296
0:13:09.002,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And there are other places too.

297
0:13:10.493,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So think about cars and planes.

298
0:13:12.332,000 --> 0:13:13,000
The lighter you can make them,

299
0:13:13.789,000 --> 0:13:15,000
the more fuel efficient they're going to be.

300
0:13:15.841,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And so if we can get away from rivets and from welding

301
0:13:18.542,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to put more adhesives in there,

302
0:13:20.142,000 --> 0:13:21,000
then we might be better off

303
0:13:21.472,000 --> 0:13:23,000
with our future generation of transportation.

304
0:13:24.215,000 --> 0:13:28,000
So for us, this all comes back to the beach.

305
0:13:28.713,000 --> 0:13:31,000
So we look around and we wonder, "How do these sea creatures stick?

306
0:13:32.433,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And what can we do with the technology?"

307
0:13:34.502,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And I would argue that we have really a lot of things we can still learn

308
0:13:38.567,000 --> 0:13:39,000
from biology and from nature.

309
0:13:40.01,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So what I'd like to encourage you all to do in the future

310
0:13:42.683,000 --> 0:13:47,000
is put down your nonrecyclable laptops and cell phones

311
0:13:48.423,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and go out and explore the natural world

312
0:13:50.431,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and then start asking some of your own questions.

313
0:13:52.992,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Thanks very much.

314
0:13:54.272,000 --> 0:13:56,000

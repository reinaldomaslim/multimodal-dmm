1
0:00:12.833,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We need to change the culture in our jails and prisons,

2
0:00:17.013,000 --> 0:00:19,000
especially for young inmates.

3
0:00:19.52,000 --> 0:00:21,000
New York state is one of only two in the U.S.

4
0:00:21.842,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that automatically arrests and tries 16- to 17-year-olds as adults.

5
0:00:26.95,000 --> 0:00:28,000
This culture of violence takes these young people

6
0:00:29.297,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and puts them in a hostile environment,

7
0:00:31.339,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and the correctional officers pretty much allow any and everything to go on.

8
0:00:35.381,000 --> 0:00:37,000
There's not really much for these young people to do

9
0:00:38.188,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to actually enhance their talent and actually rehabilitate them.

10
0:00:43.038,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Until we can raise the age of criminal responsibility to 18,

11
0:00:46.284,000 --> 0:00:49,000
we need to focus on changing the daily lives of these young people.

12
0:00:50.155,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I know firsthand.

13
0:00:52.329,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Before I ever turned 18,

14
0:00:53.908,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I spent approximately 400 days on Rikers Island,

15
0:00:57.855,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and to add to that

16
0:00:59.109,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I spent almost 300 days in solitary confinement,

17
0:01:02.963,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and let me tell you this:

18
0:01:05.68,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Screaming at the top of your lungs all day on your cell door

19
0:01:08.768,000 --> 0:01:1,000
or screaming at the top of your lungs out the window,

20
0:01:11.345,000 --> 0:01:12,000
it gets tiring.

21
0:01:13.267,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Since there's not much for you to do while you're in there,

22
0:01:16.064,000 --> 0:01:18,000
you start pacing back and forth in your cell,

23
0:01:18.347,000 --> 0:01:2,000
you start talking to yourself,

24
0:01:20.483,000 --> 0:01:21,000
your thoughts start running wild,

25
0:01:22.48,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and then your thoughts become your own worst enemy.

26
0:01:25.963,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Jails are actually supposed to rehabilitate a person,

27
0:01:28.958,000 --> 0:01:3,000
not cause him or her to become more angry,

28
0:01:31.651,000 --> 0:01:33,000
frustrated, and feel more hopeless.

29
0:01:34.391,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Since there's not a discharge plan put in place for these young people,

30
0:01:38.294,000 --> 0:01:41,000
they pretty much reenter society with nothing.

31
0:01:43.168,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And there's not really much for them to do to keep them from recidivating.

32
0:01:47.823,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But it all starts with the C.O.s.

33
0:01:50.545,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It's very easy for some people

34
0:01:52.513,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to look at these correctional officers as the good guys

35
0:01:55.207,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and the inmates as the bad guys,

36
0:01:57.482,000 --> 0:01:58,000
or vice versa for some,

37
0:01:59.178,000 --> 0:02:,000
but it's a little more than that.

38
0:02:00.849,000 --> 0:02:02,000
See, these C.O.s are normal, everyday people.

39
0:02:03.844,000 --> 0:02:08,000
They come from the same neighborhoods as the population they "serve."

40
0:02:09.725,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They're just normal people.

41
0:02:11.597,000 --> 0:02:14,000
They're not robots, and there's nothing special about them.

42
0:02:15.261,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They do pretty much everything anybody else in society does.

43
0:02:19.023,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The male C.O.s want to talk and flirt with the female C.O.s.

44
0:02:22.922,000 --> 0:02:24,000
They play the little high school kid games with each other.

45
0:02:25.731,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They politic with one another.

46
0:02:27.635,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And the female C.O.s gossip to each other.

47
0:02:31.954,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So I spent numerous amounts of time with numerous amounts of C.O.s,

48
0:02:37.944,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and let me tell you about this one in particular named Monroe.

49
0:02:40.856,000 --> 0:02:42,000
One day he pulled me in between the A and B doors

50
0:02:43.354,000 --> 0:02:46,000
which separate the north and south sides of our housing unit.

51
0:02:46.673,000 --> 0:02:48,000
He pulled me there because I had a physical altercation

52
0:02:49.27,000 --> 0:02:51,000
with another young man in my housing unit,

53
0:02:51.29,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and he felt, since there was a female officer working on the floor,

54
0:02:54.773,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that I violated his shift.

55
0:02:57.258,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So he punched me in my chest.

56
0:02:59.255,000 --> 0:03:01,000
He kind of knocked the wind out of me.

57
0:03:01.391,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I wasn't impulsive, I didn't react right away,

58
0:03:04.248,000 --> 0:03:06,000
because I know this is their house.

59
0:03:06.896,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I have no wins.

60
0:03:08.746,000 --> 0:03:13,000
All he has to do is pull his pin and backup will come immediately.

61
0:03:15.084,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So I just gave him a look in his eyes

62
0:03:17.645,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and I guess he saw the anger and frustration just burning,

63
0:03:20.904,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and he said to me,

64
0:03:22.869,000 --> 0:03:24,000
"Your eyes are going to get you in a lot of trouble,

65
0:03:25.331,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because you're looking like you want to fight."

66
0:03:27.837,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So he commenced to taking off his utility belt,

67
0:03:30.206,000 --> 0:03:32,000
he took off his shirt and his badge,

68
0:03:32.297,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and he said, "We could fight."

69
0:03:34.334,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So I asked him, "You gonna hold it down?"

70
0:03:37.151,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Now, that's a term that's commonly used on Rikers Island

71
0:03:40.064,000 --> 0:03:42,000
meaning that you're not going to say anything to anybody,

72
0:03:42.731,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and you're not going to report it.

73
0:03:44.958,000 --> 0:03:47,000
He said, "Yeah, I'm gonna hold it down. You gonna hold it down?"

74
0:03:48.735,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I didn't even respond.

75
0:03:50.406,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I just punched him right in his face,

76
0:03:52.331,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and we began fighting right then and there.

77
0:03:55.027,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Towards the end of the fight, he slammed me up against the wall,

78
0:03:59.347,000 --> 0:04:02,000
so while we were tussled up, he said to me, "You good?"

79
0:04:02.852,000 --> 0:04:03,000
as if he got the best of me,

80
0:04:04.617,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but in my mind, I know I got the best of him,

81
0:04:07.241,000 --> 0:04:09,000
so I replied very cocky,

82
0:04:09.244,000 --> 0:04:11,000
"Oh, I'm good, you good?"

83
0:04:11.372,000 --> 0:04:12,000
He said, "Yeah, I'm good, I'm good."

84
0:04:13.366,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We let go, he shook my hand, said he gave me my respect,

85
0:04:17.532,000 --> 0:04:2,000
gave me a cigarette and sent me on my way.

86
0:04:21.723,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Believe it or not, you come across some C.O.s on Rikers Island

87
0:04:25.464,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that'll fight you one-on-one.

88
0:04:28.04,000 --> 0:04:3,000
They feel that they understand how it is,

89
0:04:30.247,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and they feel that I'm going to meet you where you're at.

90
0:04:33.055,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Since this is how you commonly handle your disputes,

91
0:04:35.551,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we can handle it in that manner.

92
0:04:37.63,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I walk away from it like a man, you walk away from it like a man,

93
0:04:40.904,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and that's it.

94
0:04:42.325,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Some C.O.s feel that they're jailing with you.

95
0:04:44.477,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This is why they have that mentality and that attitude

96
0:04:47.047,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and they go by that concept.

97
0:04:49.078,000 --> 0:04:52,000
In some instances, we're in it together with the C.O.s.

98
0:04:52.543,000 --> 0:04:55,000
However, institutions need to give these correctional officers

99
0:04:55.617,000 --> 0:04:58,000
proper trainings on how to properly deal with the adolescent population,

100
0:04:58.995,000 --> 0:05:,000
and they also need to give them proper trainings

101
0:05:01.24,000 --> 0:05:04,000
on how to deal with the mental health population as well.

102
0:05:04.777,000 --> 0:05:07,000
These C.O.s play a big factor in these young people's lives

103
0:05:08.086,000 --> 0:05:11,000
for x amount of time until a disposition is reached on their case.

104
0:05:11.444,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So why not try to mentor these young people while they're there?

105
0:05:16.101,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Why not try to give them some type of insight to make a change,

106
0:05:20.322,000 --> 0:05:23,000
so once they reenter back into society,

107
0:05:23.783,000 --> 0:05:26,000
they're doing something positive?

108
0:05:28.217,000 --> 0:05:33,000
A second big thing to help our teens in jails is better programming.

109
0:05:33.626,000 --> 0:05:37,000
When I was on Rikers Island, the huge thing was solitary confinement.

110
0:05:37.644,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Solitary confinement was originally designed

111
0:05:40.373,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to break a person mentally, physically and emotionally.

112
0:05:44.065,000 --> 0:05:46,000
That's what it was designed for.

113
0:05:47.756,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The U.S. Attorney General recently released a report

114
0:05:50.224,000 --> 0:05:52,000
stating that they're going to ban solitary confinement

115
0:05:52.749,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in New York state for teens.

116
0:05:55.698,000 --> 0:05:59,000
One thing that kept me sane while I was in solitary confinement was reading.

117
0:05:59.9,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I tried to educate myself as much as possible.

118
0:06:02.802,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I read any and everything I could get my hands on.

119
0:06:05.427,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And aside from that, I wrote music and short stories.

120
0:06:09.118,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Some programs that I feel would benefit our young people

121
0:06:14.194,000 --> 0:06:17,000
are art therapy programs

122
0:06:17.245,000 --> 0:06:2,000
for the kids that like to draw and have that talent,

123
0:06:20.31,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and what about the young individuals that are musically inclined?

124
0:06:24.252,000 --> 0:06:26,000
How about a music program for them that actually teaches them

125
0:06:27.139,000 --> 0:06:29,000
how to write and make music?

126
0:06:29.536,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Just a thought.

127
0:06:30.96,000 --> 0:06:32,000
When adolescents come to Rikers Island,

128
0:06:33.029,000 --> 0:06:37,000
C74, RNDC is the building that they're housed in.

129
0:06:37.143,000 --> 0:06:4,000
That's nicknamed "gladiator school,"

130
0:06:40.704,000 --> 0:06:42,000
because you have a young individual coming in from the street

131
0:06:43.586,000 --> 0:06:44,000
thinking that they're tough,

132
0:06:45.363,000 --> 0:06:48,000
being surrounded by a bunch of other young individuals

133
0:06:48.683,000 --> 0:06:51,000
from all of the five boroughs, and everybody feels that they're tough.

134
0:06:52.327,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So now you have a bunch of young gentlemen poking their chests out

135
0:06:56.322,000 --> 0:06:59,000
feeling that I have to prove I'm equally as tough as you

136
0:06:59.712,000 --> 0:07:01,000
or I'm tougher than you, you and you.

137
0:07:02.146,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But let's be honest:

138
0:07:03.734,000 --> 0:07:07,000
That culture is very dangerous and damaging to our young people.

139
0:07:08.625,000 --> 0:07:1,000
We need to help institutions and these teens realize

140
0:07:11.579,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that they don't have to lead the previous lifestyle that they led

141
0:07:14.874,000 --> 0:07:17,000
when they were on the street, that they can actually make a change.

142
0:07:18.311,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It's sad to report that while I was in prison,

143
0:07:21.762,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I used to hear dudes talking about when they get released from prison,

144
0:07:25.991,000 --> 0:07:28,000
what type of crimes they're going to commit

145
0:07:29.079,000 --> 0:07:31,000
when they get back in the street.

146
0:07:31.703,000 --> 0:07:33,000
The conversations used to sound something like this:

147
0:07:35.616,000 --> 0:07:37,000
"Oh, when I hit the street, my brother got this connection

148
0:07:38.443,000 --> 0:07:39,000
for this, that and the third,"

149
0:07:39.891,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or, "My man over here got this connection for the low price.

150
0:07:42.735,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Let's exchange information,"

151
0:07:44.142,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and, "When we hit the town, we're going to do it real big."

152
0:07:46.925,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I used to hear these conversations and think to myself, "Wow,

153
0:07:49.784,000 --> 0:07:51,000
these dudes are really talking about going back in the street

154
0:07:52.716,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and committing future crimes."

155
0:07:54.248,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So I came up with a name for that:

156
0:07:55.99,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I called it a go-back-to-jail-quick scheme

157
0:07:58.939,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because really, how long is that going to last?

158
0:08:02.523,000 --> 0:08:04,000
You get a retirement plan with that?

159
0:08:04.883,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Nice little pension? 401(k)? 403(b)?

160
0:08:08.341,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You get health insurance? Dental?

161
0:08:11.639,000 --> 0:08:12,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:13.568,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But I will tell you this:

163
0:08:15.424,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Being in jail and being in prison,

164
0:08:17.166,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I came across some of the most intelligent, brilliant,

165
0:08:20.788,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and talented people that I would ever meet.

166
0:08:23.574,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I've seen individuals take a potato chip bag

167
0:08:25.803,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and turn it into the most beautiful picture frame.

168
0:08:28.434,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I've seen individuals take the state soap that's provided for free

169
0:08:31.546,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and turn them into the most beautiful sculptures

170
0:08:33.925,000 --> 0:08:37,000
that would make Michelangelo look like a kindergartner made it.

171
0:08:38.217,000 --> 0:08:41,000
At the age of 21, I was in a maximum-security prison

172
0:08:41.304,000 --> 0:08:42,000
called Elmira Correctional Facility.

173
0:08:43.107,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I just came out of the weight shack from working out,

174
0:08:45.615,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and I saw an older gentleman that I knew standing in the middle of the yard

175
0:08:49.148,000 --> 0:08:5,000
just looking up at the sky.

176
0:08:50.453,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Mind you, this older gentlemen was serving a 33-and-a-third-to-life sentence

177
0:08:54.649,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in which he already had served 20 years of that sentence.

178
0:08:58.081,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So I walk up to him and I said,

179
0:08:59.895,000 --> 0:09:,000
"O.G., what's going on, man, you good?"

180
0:09:01.857,000 --> 0:09:03,000
He looked at me, and he said, "Yeah, I'm good, young blood."

181
0:09:04.708,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I'm like, "So what are you looking up at the sky for, man?

182
0:09:07.441,000 --> 0:09:08,000
What's so fascinating up there?"

183
0:09:09.139,000 --> 0:09:11,000
He said, "You look up and you tell me what you see."

184
0:09:13.087,000 --> 0:09:16,000
"Clouds." (Laughter)

185
0:09:16.615,000 --> 0:09:18,000
He said, "All right. What else do you see?"

186
0:09:19.522,000 --> 0:09:21,000
At that time, it was a plane passing by.

187
0:09:22.023,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I said, "All right, I see an airplane."

188
0:09:24.05,000 --> 0:09:28,000
He said, "Exactly, and what's on that airplane?" "People."

189
0:09:28.206,000 --> 0:09:31,000
"Exactly. Now where's that plane and those people going?"

190
0:09:32.083,000 --> 0:09:33,000
"I don't know. You know?

191
0:09:33.569,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Please let me know if you do. Then let me get some lottery numbers."

192
0:09:38.236,000 --> 0:09:41,000
He said, "You're missing the big picture, young blood.

193
0:09:41.394,000 --> 0:09:43,000
That plane with those people is going somewhere,

194
0:09:43.739,000 --> 0:09:45,000
while we're here stuck.

195
0:09:46.317,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The big picture is this:

196
0:09:48.151,000 --> 0:09:5,000
That plane with those people going somewhere,

197
0:09:50.519,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that's life passing us by while we behind these walls, stuck."

198
0:09:58.252,000 --> 0:10:,000
Ever since that day,

199
0:10:00.318,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that sparked something in my mind and made me know I had to make a change.

200
0:10:04.497,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Growing up, I was always a good, smart kid.

201
0:10:07.794,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Some people would say I was a little too smart for my own good.

202
0:10:12.743,000 --> 0:10:17,000
I had dreams of becoming an architect or an archaeologist.

203
0:10:18.29,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Currently, I'm working at the Fortune Society,

204
0:10:20.473,000 --> 0:10:21,000
which is a reentry program,

205
0:10:22.222,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and I work with people as a case manager that are at high risk for recidivism.

206
0:10:26.765,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So I connect them with the services that they need

207
0:10:29.171,000 --> 0:10:31,000
once they're released from jail and prison

208
0:10:31.2,000 --> 0:10:34,000
so they can make a positive transition back into society.

209
0:10:34.326,000 --> 0:10:36,000
If I was to see my 15-year-old self today,

210
0:10:37.121,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I would sit down and talk to him and try to educate him

211
0:10:40.092,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and I would let him know, "Listen, this is me. I'm you.

212
0:10:44.037,000 --> 0:10:46,000
This is us. We are one.

213
0:10:46.431,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Everything that you're about to do, I know what you're gonna do

214
0:10:49.473,000 --> 0:10:51,000
before you do it because I already did it,

215
0:10:52.097,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and I would encourage him not to hang out with x, y and z people.

216
0:10:55.734,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I would tell him not to be in such-and-such place.

217
0:10:58.54,000 --> 0:11:,000
I would tell him, keep your behind in school, man,

218
0:11:00.916,000 --> 0:11:01,000
because that's where you need to be,

219
0:11:02.836,000 --> 0:11:04,000
because that's what's going to get you somewhere in life.

220
0:11:05.54,000 --> 0:11:07,000
This is the message that we should be sharing

221
0:11:07.703,000 --> 0:11:08,000
with our young men and young women.

222
0:11:09.576,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We shouldn't be treating them as adults and putting them in cultures of violence

223
0:11:13.504,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that are nearly impossible for them to escape.

224
0:11:16.203,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Thank you.

225
0:11:18.268,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Applause)

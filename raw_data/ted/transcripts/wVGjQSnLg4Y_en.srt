1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
How will we be remembered in 200 years?

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I happen to live in a little town, Princeton, in New Jersey,

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
which every year celebrates the great event in Princeton history:

4
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the Battle of Princeton, which was, in fact, a very important battle.

5
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It was the first battle that George Washington won, in fact,

6
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and was pretty much of a turning point in the war of independence.

7
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It happened 225 years ago.

8
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It was actually a terrible disaster for Princeton.

9
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The town was burned down; it was in the middle of winter,

10
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and it was a very, very severe winter.

11
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And about a quarter of all the people in Princeton died that winter

12
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
from hunger and cold, but nobody remembers that.

13
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
What they remember is, of course, the great triumph,

14
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that the Brits were beaten, and we won, and that the country was born.

15
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And so I agree very emphatically that the pain of childbirth is not remembered.

16
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It's the child that's remembered.

17
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And that's what we're going through at this time.

18
0:01:27.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I wanted to just talk for one minute about the future of biotechnology,

19
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
because I think I know very little about that -- I'm not a biologist --

20
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
so everything I know about it can be said in one minute.

21
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
What I'm saying is that we should follow the model

23
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that has been so successful with the electronic industry,

24
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that what really turned computers into a great success, in the world

25
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
as a whole, is toys. As soon as computers became toys,

26
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
when kids could come home and play with them,

27
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
then the industry really took off. And that has to happen with biotech.

28
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
There's a huge --

29
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

30
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Applause)

31
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
-- there's a huge community of people in the world

32
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
who are practical biologists, who are dog breeders,

33
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
pigeon breeders, orchid breeders, rose breeders,

34
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
people who handle biology with their hands,

35
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and who are dedicated to producing beautiful things, beautiful creatures,

36
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
plants, animals, pets. These people will be empowered with biotech,

37
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and that will be an enormous positive step

38
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to acceptance of biotechnology.

39
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
That will blow away a lot of the opposition.

40
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
When people have this technology in their hands,

41
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
you have a do-it-yourself biotech kit, grow your own --

42
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
grow your dog, grow your own cat.

43
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Laughter)

44
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Applause)

45
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Just buy the software, you design it. I won't say anymore,

46
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
you can take it on from there. It's going to happen, and

47
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I think it has to happen before the technology becomes natural,

48
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
becomes part of the human condition,

49
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
something that everybody's familiar with and everybody accepts.

50
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So, let's leave that aside.

51
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I want to talk about something quite different,

52
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
which is what I know about, and that is astronomy.

53
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And I'm interested in searching for life in the universe.

54
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And it's open to us to introduce a new way of doing that,

55
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and that's what I'll talk about for 10 minutes,

56
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or whatever the time remains.

57
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The important fact is, that most of the real estate

58
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that's accessible to us -- I'm not talking about the stars,

59
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I'm talking about the solar system, the stuff that's within reach

60
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
for spacecraft and within reach of our earthbound telescopes --

61
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
most of the real estate is very cold and very far from the Sun.

62
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
If you look at the solar system, as we know it today,

63
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
it has a few planets close to the Sun. That's where we live.

64
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It has a fairly substantial number of asteroids between

65
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the orbit of the Earth out through -- to the orbit of Jupiter.

66
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The asteroids are a substantial amount of real estate,

67
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but not very large. And it's not very promising for life,

68
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
since most of it consists of rock and metal, mostly rock.

69
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It's not only cold, but very dry.

70
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So the asteroids we don't have much hope for.

71
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
There stand some interesting places a little further out:

72
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the moons of Jupiter and Saturn.

73
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Particularly, there's a place called Europa, which is --

74
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Europa is one of the moons of Jupiter,

75
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
where we see a very level ice surface,

76
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which looks as if it's floating on top of an ocean.

77
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So, we believe that on Europa there is, in fact, a deep ocean.

78
0:05:41.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And that makes it extraordinarily interesting as a place to explore.

79
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate,

80
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
just as it originated on the Earth. So we would love to explore Europa,

81
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
to go down through the ice,

82
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
find out who is swimming around in the ocean,

83
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters --

84
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:15,000
whatever there may be that's exciting --- or cephalopods.

85
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But that's hard to do. Unfortunately, the ice is thick.

86
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
We don't know just how thick it is, probably miles thick,

87
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
so it's very expensive and very difficult to go down there --

88
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
send down your submarine or whatever it is -- and explore.

89
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
That's something we don't yet know how to do.

90
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
There are plans to do it, but it's hard.

91
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Go out a bit further, you'll find that beyond the orbit of Neptune,

92
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:49,000
way out, far from the Sun, that's where the real estate really begins.

93
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
You'll find millions or trillions or billions of objects which,

94
0:06:54.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
in what we call the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud --

95
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
these are clouds of small objects which appear as comets

96
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:07,000
when they fall close to the Sun. Mostly, they just live out there

97
0:07:07.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in the cold of the outer solar system,

98
0:07:10.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but they are biologically very interesting indeed,

99
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
because they consist primarily of ice with other minerals,

100
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
which are just the right ones for developing life.

101
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So if life could be established out there,

102
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
it would have all the essentials -- chemistry and sunlight --

103
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
everything that's needed.

104
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So, what I'm proposing

105
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is that there is where we should be looking for life, rather than on Mars,

106
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
although Mars is, of course, also a very promising and interesting place.

107
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But we can look outside, very cheaply and in a simple fashion.

108
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And that's what I'm going to talk about.

109
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
There is a -- imagine that life originated on Europa,

110
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and it was sitting in the ocean for billions of years.

111
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It's quite likely that it would move out of the ocean onto the surface,

112
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
just as it did on the Earth.

113
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Staying in the ocean and evolving in the ocean for 2 billion years,

114
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
finally came out onto the land. And then of course it had great --

115
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
much greater freedom, and a much greater variety of creatures

116
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:23,000
developed on the land than had ever been possible in the ocean.

117
0:08:23.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And the step from the ocean to the land was not easy, but it happened.

118
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Now, if life had originated on Europa in the ocean,

119
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:35,000
it could also have moved out onto the surface.

120
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
There wouldn't have been any air there -- it's a vacuum.

121
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It is out in the cold, but it still could have come.

122
0:08:44.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
You can imagine that the plants growing up like kelp

123
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
through cracks in the ice, growing on the surface.

124
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
What would they need in order to grow on the surface?

125
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
They'd need, first of all, to have a thick skin to protect themselves

126
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
from losing water through the skin.

127
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So they would have to have something like a reptilian skin.

128
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But better -- what is more important

129
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
is that they would have to concentrate sunlight.

130
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The sunlight in Jupiter, on the satellites of Jupiter,

131
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
is 25 times fainter than it is here,

132
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
since Jupiter is five times as far from the Sun.

133
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So they would have to have -- these creatures, which I call sunflowers,

134
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
which I imagine living on the surface of Europa, would have to have

135
0:09:36.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
either lenses or mirrors to concentrate sunlight,

136
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
so they could keep themselves warm on the surface.

137
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Otherwise, they would be at a temperature of minus 150,

138
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
which is certainly not favorable for developing life,

139
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:53,000
at least of the kind we know.

140
0:09:53.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
But if they just simply could grow, like leaves,

141
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
little lenses and mirrors to concentrate sunlight,

142
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
then they could keep warm on the surface.

143
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They could enjoy all the benefits of the sunlight

144
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and have roots going down into the ocean;

145
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
life then could flourish much more.

146
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So, why not look? Of course, it's not very likely

147
0:10:16.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that there's life on the surface of Europa.

148
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
None of these things is likely, but my,

149
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
my philosophy is, look for what's detectable, not for what's probable.

150
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
There's a long history in astronomy of unlikely things

151
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
turning out to be there. And I mean,

152
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
the finest example of that was radio astronomy as a whole.

153
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
This was -- originally, when radio astronomy began,

154
0:10:41.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Mr. Jansky, at the Bell labs, detected radio waves coming from the sky.

155
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And the regular astronomers were scornful about this.

156
0:10:55.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
They said, "It's all right, you can detect radio waves from the Sun,

157
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but the Sun is the only object in the universe that's close enough

158
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and bright enough actually to be detectable. You can easily calculate

159
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that radio waves from the Sun are fairly faint,

160
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and everything else in the universe is millions of times further away,

161
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
so it certainly will not be detectable.

162
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So there's no point in looking."

163
0:11:23.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And that, of course, that set back the progress of radio astronomy

164
0:11:28.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
by about 20 years.

165
0:11:33.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Since there was nothing there, you might as well not look.

166
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Well, of course, as soon as anybody did look,

167
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
which was after about 20 years,

168
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
when radio astronomy really took off. Because it turned out

169
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:47,000
the universe is absolutely full of all kinds of wonderful things

170
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
radiating in the radio spectrum, much brighter than the Sun.

171
0:11:53.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So, the same thing could be true for this kind of life,

172
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
which I'm talking about, on cold objects: that it could in fact

173
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
be very abundant all over the universe, and it's not been detected

174
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
just because we haven't taken the trouble to look.

175
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
So, the last thing I want to talk about is how to detect it.

176
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
There is something called pit lamping.

177
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
That's the phrase which I learned from my son George,

178
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
who is there in the audience.

179
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
You take -- that's a Canadian expression.

180
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
If you happen to want to hunt animals at night,

181
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
you take a miner's lamp, which is a pit lamp.

182
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
You strap it onto your forehead, so you can see

183
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
the reflection in the eyes of the animal. So, if you go out at night,

184
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:48,000
you shine a flashlight, the animals are bright.

185
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:51,000
You see the red glow in their eyes,

186
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
which is the reflection of the flashlight.

187
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And then, if you're one of these unsporting characters,

188
0:12:58.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
you shoot the animals and take them home.

189
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And of course, that spoils the game

190
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
for the other hunters who hunt in the daytime,

191
0:13:05.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
so in Canada that's illegal. In New Zealand, it's legal,

192
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
because the New Zealand farmers use this as a way of getting rid of rabbits,

193
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
because the rabbits compete with the sheep in New Zealand.

194
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So, the farmers go out at night

195
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
with heavily armed jeeps, and shine the headlights,

196
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and anything that doesn't look like a sheep, you shoot.

197
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
(Laughter)

198
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So I have proposed to apply the same trick

199
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
to looking for life in the universe.

200
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
That if these creatures who are living on cold surfaces --

201
0:13:39.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
either on Europa, or further out, anywhere where you can live

202
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
on a cold surface -- those creatures must be provided with reflectors.

203
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
In order to concentrate sunlight, they have to have lenses and mirrors --

204
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
in order to keep themselves warm.

205
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
And then, when you shine sunlight at them,

206
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
the sunlight will be reflected back,

207
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
just as it is in the eyes of an animal.

208
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:1,000
So these creatures will be bright against the cold surroundings.

209
0:14:10.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And the further out you go in this, away from the Sun,

210
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
the more powerful this reflection will be. So actually,

211
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
this method of hunting for life gets stronger and stronger

212
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
as you go further away,

213
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
because the optical reflectors have to be more powerful so the reflected light

214
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
shines out even more in contrast against the dark background.

215
0:14:34.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So as you go further away from the Sun,

216
0:14:36.33,000 --> 0:14:4,000
this becomes more and more powerful.

217
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
So, in fact, you can look for these creatures with telescopes from the Earth.

218
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Why aren't we doing it? Simply because nobody thought of it yet.

219
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
But I hope that we shall look, and with any --

220
0:14:55.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
we probably won't find anything,

221
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:01,000
none of these speculations may have any basis in fact.

222
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:04,000
But still, it's a good chance. And of course, if it happens,

223
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
it will transform our view of life altogether.

224
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Because it means that -- the way life can live out there,

225
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
it has enormous advantages as compared with living on a planet.

226
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
It's extremely hard to move from one planet to another.

227
0:15:19.33,000 --> 0:15:23,000
We're having great difficulties at the moment

228
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and any creatures that live on a planet are pretty well stuck.

229
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Especially if you breathe air,

230
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
it's very hard to get from planet A to planet B,

231
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
because there's no air in between. But if you breathe air --

232
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
(Laughter)

233
0:15:43.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
-- you're dead --

234
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
(Laughter)

235
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
-- as soon as you're off the planet, unless you have a spaceship.

236
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
But if you live in a vacuum, if you live on the surface

237
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
of one of these objects, say, in the Kuiper Belt,

238
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
this -- an object like Pluto, or one of the

239
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
smaller objects in the neighborhood of Pluto,

240
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and you happened -- if you're living on the surface there,

241
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and you get knocked off the surface by a collision,

242
0:16:08.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
then it doesn't change anything all that much.

243
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
You still are on a piece of ice, you can still have sunlight

244
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and you can still survive while you're traveling from one place to another.

245
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And then if you run into another object, you can stay there

246
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
and colonize the other object. So life will spread, then,

247
0:16:26.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
from one object to another. So if it exists at all in the Kuiper Belt,

248
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
it's likely to be very widespread. And you will have then

249
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
a great competition amongst species -- Darwinian evolution --

250
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
so there'll be a huge advantage to the species

251
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
which is able to jump from one place to another

252
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:49,000
without having to wait for a collision. And there'll be advantages

253
0:16:49.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
for spreading out long, sort of kelp-like forest of vegetation.

254
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I call these creatures sunflowers.

255
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
They look like, maybe like sunflowers.

256
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
They have to be all the time pointing toward the Sun,

257
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and they will be able to spread out in space,

258
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
because gravity on these objects is weak.

259
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:14,000
So they can collect sunlight from a big area.

260
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:18,000
So they will, in fact, be quite easy for us to detect.

261
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
So, I hope in the next 10 years, we'll find these creatures,

262
0:17:21.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and then, of course, our whole view of life in the universe will change.

263
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
If we don't find them, then we can create them ourselves.

264
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
(Laughter)

265
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
That's another wonderful opportunity that's opening.

266
0:17:40.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
We can -- as soon as we have a little bit more understanding

267
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:48,000
of genetic engineering, one of the things you can do with your

268
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:51,000
take-it-home, do-it-yourself genetic engineering kit --

269
0:17:51.33,000 --> 0:17:53,000
(Laughter) --

270
0:17:53.33,000 --> 0:17:56,000
is to design a creature that can live on a cold satellite,

271
0:17:56.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
a place like Europa, so we could colonize Europa with our own creatures.

272
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:05,000
That would be a fun thing to do.

273
0:18:05.33,000 --> 0:18:08,000
(Laughter)

274
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
In the long run, of course,

275
0:18:11.33,000 --> 0:18:16,000
it would also make it possible for us to move out there.

276
0:18:16.33,000 --> 0:18:18,000
What's going to happen in the end,

277
0:18:18.33,000 --> 0:18:21,000
it's not going to be just humans colonizing space,

278
0:18:21.33,000 --> 0:18:25,000
it's going to be life moving out from the Earth,

279
0:18:25.33,000 --> 0:18:28,000
moving it into its kingdom. And the kingdom of life,

280
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:33,000
of course, is going to be the universe. And if life is already there,

281
0:18:33.33,000 --> 0:18:36,000
it makes it much more exciting, in the short run.

282
0:18:36.33,000 --> 0:18:42,000
But in the long run, if there's no life there, we create it ourselves.

283
0:18:42.33,000 --> 0:18:46,000
We transform the universe into something much more rich and beautiful

284
0:18:46.33,000 --> 0:18:48,000
than it is today.

285
0:18:48.33,000 --> 0:18:53,000
So again, we have a big and wonderful future to look forward.

286
0:18:53.33,000 --> 0:18:54,000
Thank you.

287
0:18:54.33,000 --> 0:19:06,000
(Applause)

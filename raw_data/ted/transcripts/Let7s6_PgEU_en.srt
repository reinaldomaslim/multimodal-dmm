1
0:00:13.723,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Please meet Jane.

2
0:00:15.644,000 --> 0:00:16,000
She has a high-risk pregnancy.

3
0:00:17.663,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Within 24 weeks,

4
0:00:19.444,000 --> 0:00:21,000
she's on bed rest at the hospital,

5
0:00:21.629,000 --> 0:00:23,000
being monitored for her preterm contractions.

6
0:00:25.024,000 --> 0:00:26,000
She doesn't look the happiest.

7
0:00:26.942,000 --> 0:00:29,000
That's in part because it requires technicians and experts

8
0:00:30.187,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to apply these clunky belts on her to monitor her uterine contractions.

9
0:00:35.55,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Another reason Jane is not so happy is because she's worried.

10
0:00:40.768,000 --> 0:00:42,000
In particular, she's worried about what happens

11
0:00:43.418,000 --> 0:00:46,000
after her 10-day stay on bed rest at the hospital.

12
0:00:47.438,000 --> 0:00:49,000
What happens when she's home?

13
0:00:49.532,000 --> 0:00:52,000
If she were to give birth this early it would be devastating.

14
0:00:53.874,000 --> 0:00:54,000
As an African-American woman,

15
0:00:55.652,000 --> 0:00:58,000
she's twice as likely to have a premature birth

16
0:00:59.376,000 --> 0:01:,000
or to have a stillbirth.

17
0:01:01.551,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So Jane basically has one of two options:

18
0:01:04.553,000 --> 0:01:06,000
stay at the hospital on bed rest,

19
0:01:07.237,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a prisoner to the technology until she gives birth,

20
0:01:11.469,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and then spend the rest of her life paying for the bill;

21
0:01:14.946,000 --> 0:01:18,000
or head home after her 10-day stay and hope for the best.

22
0:01:20.198,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Neither of these two options seems appealing.

23
0:01:24.132,000 --> 0:01:26,000
As I began to think about stories like this

24
0:01:26.267,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and hear about stories like this,

25
0:01:28.077,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I began to ask myself and imagine:

26
0:01:30.194,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Is there an alternative?

27
0:01:31.76,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Is there a way we could have the benefits of high-fidelity monitoring

28
0:01:36.52,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that we get with our trusted partners in the hospital

29
0:01:39.343,000 --> 0:01:41,000
while someone is at home living their daily life?

30
0:01:42.832,000 --> 0:01:43,000
With that in mind,

31
0:01:44.351,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I encouraged people in my research group

32
0:01:46.322,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to partner with some clever material scientists,

33
0:01:49.854,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and all of us came together and brainstormed.

34
0:01:52.904,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And after a long process,

35
0:01:54.369,000 --> 0:01:56,000
we came up with a vision, an idea,

36
0:01:56.787,000 --> 0:01:59,000
of a wearable system that perhaps you could wear like a piece of jewelry

37
0:02:00.589,000 --> 0:02:02,000
or you could apply to yourself like a Band-Aid.

38
0:02:03.463,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And after many trials and tribulations and years of endeavors,

39
0:02:07.67,000 --> 0:02:1,000
we were able to come up with this flexible electronic patch

40
0:02:11.421,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that was manufactured using the same processes

41
0:02:13.84,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that they use to build computer chips,

42
0:02:16.545,000 --> 0:02:2,000
except the electronics are transferred from a semiconductor wafer

43
0:02:21.001,000 --> 0:02:25,000
onto a flexible material that can interface with the human body.

44
0:02:25.775,000 --> 0:02:28,000
These systems are about the thickness of a human hair.

45
0:02:30.006,000 --> 0:02:33,000
They can measure the types of information that we want,

46
0:02:33.948,000 --> 0:02:34,000
things such as:

47
0:02:35.151,000 --> 0:02:36,000
bodily movement,

48
0:02:36.67,000 --> 0:02:37,000
bodily temperature,

49
0:02:38.098,000 --> 0:02:39,000
electrical rhythms of the body

50
0:02:39.927,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and so forth.

51
0:02:41.403,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We can also engineer these systems,

52
0:02:43.883,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so they can integrate energy sources,

53
0:02:46.877,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and can have wireless transmission capabilities.

54
0:02:50.624,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So as we began to build these types of systems,

55
0:02:54.553,000 --> 0:02:58,000
we began to test them on ourselves in our research group.

56
0:02:58.915,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But in addition, we began to reach out to some of our clinical partners

57
0:03:02.303,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in San Diego,

58
0:03:03.482,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and test these on different patients in different clinical conditions,

59
0:03:07.206,000 --> 0:03:09,000
including moms-to-be like Jane.

60
0:03:10.531,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Here is a picture of a pregnant woman in labor at our university hospital

61
0:03:15.535,000 --> 0:03:19,000
being monitored for her uterine contractions with the conventional belt.

62
0:03:20.939,000 --> 0:03:21,000
In addition,

63
0:03:22.114,000 --> 0:03:24,000
our flexible electronic patches are there.

64
0:03:25.268,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This picture demonstrates waveforms pertaining to the fetal heart rate,

65
0:03:29.568,000 --> 0:03:31,000
where the red corresponds to what was acquired

66
0:03:32.509,000 --> 0:03:33,000
with the conventional belts,

67
0:03:34.112,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and the blue corresponds to our estimates

68
0:03:36.794,000 --> 0:03:39,000
using our flexible electronic systems and our algorithms.

69
0:03:40.932,000 --> 0:03:41,000
At this moment,

70
0:03:42.404,000 --> 0:03:44,000
we gave ourselves a big mental high five.

71
0:03:45.508,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Some of the things we had imagined were beginning to come to fruition,

72
0:03:48.939,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and we were actually seeing this in a clinical context.

73
0:03:52.083,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But there was still a problem.

74
0:03:53.974,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The problem was, the way we manufactured these systems

75
0:03:57.359,000 --> 0:03:58,000
was very inefficient,

76
0:03:58.84,000 --> 0:03:59,000
had low yield

77
0:04:00.021,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and was very error-prone.

78
0:04:02.105,000 --> 0:04:03,000
In addition,

79
0:04:03.28,000 --> 0:04:05,000
as we talked to some of the nurses in the hospital,

80
0:04:05.776,000 --> 0:04:07,000
they encouraged us to make sure

81
0:04:07.99,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that our electronics worked with typical medical adhesives

82
0:04:12.027,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that are used in a hospital.

83
0:04:14.217,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We had an epiphany and said, "Wait a minute.

84
0:04:16.998,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Rather than just making them work with adhesives,

85
0:04:19.693,000 --> 0:04:22,000
let's integrate them into adhesives,

86
0:04:23.194,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and that could solve our manufacturing problem."

87
0:04:26.269,000 --> 0:04:27,000
This picture that you see here

88
0:04:28.284,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is our ability to embed these censors inside of a piece of Scotch tape

89
0:04:32.803,000 --> 0:04:34,000
by simply peeling it off of a wafer.

90
0:04:36.255,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Ongoing work in our research group allows us to, in addition,

91
0:04:39.648,000 --> 0:04:42,000
embed integrated circuits into the flexible adhesives

92
0:04:43.381,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to do things like amplifying signals and digitizing them,

93
0:04:47.095,000 --> 0:04:48,000
processing them

94
0:04:48.297,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and encoding for wireless transmission.

95
0:04:51.113,000 --> 0:04:54,000
All of this integrated into the same medical adhesives

96
0:04:55.039,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that are used in the hospital.

97
0:04:57.81,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So when we reached this point,

98
0:04:59.326,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we had some other challenges,

99
0:05:01.774,000 --> 0:05:04,000
from both an engineering as well as a usability perspective,

100
0:05:05.113,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to make sure that we could make it used practically.

101
0:05:09.207,000 --> 0:05:11,000
In many digital health discussions,

102
0:05:11.718,000 --> 0:05:15,000
people believe in and embrace the idea that we can simply digitize the data,

103
0:05:16.689,000 --> 0:05:17,000
wirelessly transmit it,

104
0:05:18.293,000 --> 0:05:19,000
send it to the cloud,

105
0:05:19.791,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and in the cloud,

106
0:05:21.012,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we can extract meaningful information for interpretation.

107
0:05:24.147,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And indeed, you can do all of that,

108
0:05:26.648,000 --> 0:05:28,000
if you're not worried about some of the energy challenges.

109
0:05:29.661,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Think about Jane for a moment.

110
0:05:31.348,000 --> 0:05:32,000
She doesn't live in Palo Alto,

111
0:05:33.176,000 --> 0:05:34,000
nor does she live in Beverly Hills.

112
0:05:35.359,000 --> 0:05:36,000
What that means is,

113
0:05:36.541,000 --> 0:05:39,000
we have to be mindful about her data plan and how much it would cost

114
0:05:39.895,000 --> 0:05:42,000
for her to be sending out a continuous stream of data.

115
0:05:44.383,000 --> 0:05:45,000
There's another challenge

116
0:05:45.686,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that not everyone in the medical profession is comfortable talking about.

117
0:05:49.408,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And that is, that Jane does not have the most trust

118
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in the medical establishment.

119
0:05:54.46,000 --> 0:05:59,000
She, people like her, her ancestors, have not had the best experiences

120
0:05:59.623,000 --> 0:06:01,000
at the hands of doctors and the hospital

121
0:06:03.163,000 --> 0:06:04,000
or insurance companies.

122
0:06:05.466,000 --> 0:06:08,000
That means that we have to be mindful of questions of privacy.

123
0:06:08.831,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Jane might not feel that happy

124
0:06:10.476,000 --> 0:06:13,000
about all that data being processed into the cloud.

125
0:06:14.712,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And Jane cannot be fooled;

126
0:06:17.346,000 --> 0:06:18,000
she reads the news.

127
0:06:18.854,000 --> 0:06:2,000
She knows that if the federal government can be hacked,

128
0:06:21.848,000 --> 0:06:23,000
if the Fortune 500 can be hacked,

129
0:06:24.409,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so can her doctor.

130
0:06:27.014,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And so with that in mind,

131
0:06:28.773,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we had an epiphany.

132
0:06:30.858,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We cannot outsmart all the hackers in the world,

133
0:06:33.612,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but perhaps we can present them a smaller target.

134
0:06:36.986,000 --> 0:06:38,000
What if we could actually,

135
0:06:39.191,000 --> 0:06:42,000
rather than have those algorithms that do data interpretation

136
0:06:43.147,000 --> 0:06:44,000
run in the cloud,

137
0:06:44.904,000 --> 0:06:47,000
what if we have those algorithms run on those small integrated circuits

138
0:06:48.339,000 --> 0:06:5,000
embedded into those adhesives?

139
0:06:50.995,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And so when we integrate these things together,

140
0:06:54.113,000 --> 0:06:57,000
what this means is that now we can think about the future

141
0:06:57.641,000 --> 0:07:01,000
where someone like Jane can still go about living her normal daily life,

142
0:07:01.73,000 --> 0:07:02,000
she can be monitored,

143
0:07:03.226,000 --> 0:07:06,000
it can be done in a way where she doesn't have to get another job

144
0:07:06.75,000 --> 0:07:07,000
to pay her data plan,

145
0:07:08.239,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and we can also address some of her concerns about privacy.

146
0:07:12.907,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So at this point,

147
0:07:14.081,000 --> 0:07:16,000
we're feeling very good about ourselves.

148
0:07:16.109,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We've accomplished this,

149
0:07:17.296,000 --> 0:07:2,000
we've begun to address some of these questions about privacy

150
0:07:20.49,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and we feel like, pretty much the chapter is closed now.

151
0:07:24.405,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Everyone lived happily ever after, right?

152
0:07:28.751,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Well, not so fast.

153
0:07:30.338,000 --> 0:07:31,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:31.567,000 --> 0:07:34,000
One of the things we have to remember, as I mentioned earlier,

155
0:07:34.631,000 --> 0:07:37,000
is that Jane does not have the most trust in the medical establishment.

156
0:07:38.036,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We have to remember

157
0:07:39.223,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that there are increasing and widening health disparities,

158
0:07:42.761,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and there's inequity in terms of proper care management.

159
0:07:46.616,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And so what that means is that this simple picture

160
0:07:49.134,000 --> 0:07:5,000
of Jane and her data --

161
0:07:50.803,000 --> 0:07:53,000
even with her being comfortable being wirelessly transmitted to the cloud,

162
0:07:54.754,000 --> 0:07:56,000
letting a doctor intervene if necessary --

163
0:07:57.093,000 --> 0:07:58,000
is not the whole story.

164
0:07:59.091,000 --> 0:08:,000
So what we're beginning to do

165
0:08:00.509,000 --> 0:08:04,000
is to think about ways to have trusted parties serve as intermediaries

166
0:08:05.36,000 --> 0:08:08,000
between people like Jane and her health care providers.

167
0:08:08.802,000 --> 0:08:11,000
For example, we've begun to partner with churches

168
0:08:11.837,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and to think about nurses that are church members,

169
0:08:14.718,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that come from that trusted community,

170
0:08:16.764,000 --> 0:08:19,000
as patient advocates and health coaches to people like Jane.

171
0:08:21.462,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Another thing we have going for us

172
0:08:23.493,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is that insurance companies, increasingly,

173
0:08:25.553,000 --> 0:08:26,000
are attracted to some of these ideas.

174
0:08:27.906,000 --> 0:08:28,000
They're increasingly realizing

175
0:08:29.637,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that perhaps it's better to pay one dollar now

176
0:08:32.601,000 --> 0:08:34,000
for a wearable device and a health coach,

177
0:08:35.608,000 --> 0:08:37,000
rather than paying 10 dollars later,

178
0:08:38.253,000 --> 0:08:4,000
when that baby is born prematurely

179
0:08:40.831,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and ends up in the neonatal intensive care unit --

180
0:08:43.796,000 --> 0:08:45,000
one of the most expensive parts of a hospital.

181
0:08:47.697,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This has been a long learning process for us.

182
0:08:50.593,000 --> 0:08:53,000
This iterative process of breaking through and attacking one problem

183
0:08:54.452,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and not feeling totally comfortable,

184
0:08:56.247,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and identifying the next problem,

185
0:08:58.09,000 --> 0:09:,000
has helped us go along this path

186
0:09:00.171,000 --> 0:09:03,000
of actually trying to not only innovate with this technology

187
0:09:03.271,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but make sure it can be used for people who perhaps need it the most.

188
0:09:07.709,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Another learning lesson we've taken from this process

189
0:09:10.517,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that is very humbling,

190
0:09:11.92,000 --> 0:09:15,000
is that as technology progresses and advances at an accelerating rate,

191
0:09:16.271,000 --> 0:09:19,000
we have to remember that human beings are using this technology,

192
0:09:20.237,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and we have to be mindful

193
0:09:21.863,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that these human beings -- they have a face,

194
0:09:25.327,000 --> 0:09:26,000
they have a name

195
0:09:26.613,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and a life.

196
0:09:27.798,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And in the case of Jane,

197
0:09:29.433,000 --> 0:09:3,000
hopefully, two.

198
0:09:32.041,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Thank you.

199
0:09:33.259,000 --> 0:09:38,000
(Applause)

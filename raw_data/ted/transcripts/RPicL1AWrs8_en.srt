1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm going to talk today

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about the pleasures of everyday life.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
But I want to begin with a story

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of an unusual and terrible man.

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
This is Hermann Goering.

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Goering was Hitler's second in command in World War II,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
his designated successor.

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And like Hitler,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Goering fancied himself a collector of art.

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
He went through Europe, through World War II,

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
stealing, extorting and occasionally buying

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
various paintings for his collection.

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And what he really wanted was something by Vermeer.

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Hitler had two of them, and he didn't have any.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So he finally found an art dealer,

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
a Dutch art dealer named Han van Meegeren,

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
who sold him a wonderful Vermeer

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
for the cost of what would now be 10 million dollars.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And it was his favorite artwork ever.

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
World War II came to an end,

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and Goering was captured, tried at Nuremberg

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and ultimately sentenced to death.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Then the Allied forces went through his collections

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and found the paintings

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and went after the people who sold it to him.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And at some point the Dutch police came into Amsterdam

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and arrested Van Meegeren.

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Van Meegeren was charged with the crime of treason,

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
which is itself punishable by death.

30
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Six weeks into his prison sentence,

31
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
van Meegeren confessed.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
But he didn't confess to treason.

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
He said, "I did not sell a great masterpiece

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to that Nazi.

35
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I painted it myself; I'm a forger."

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now nobody believed him.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And he said, "I'll prove it.

38
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Bring me a canvas and some paint,

39
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and I will paint a Vermeer much better

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
than I sold that disgusting Nazi.

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I also need alcohol and morphine, because it's the only way I can work."

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So they brought him in.

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
He painted a beautiful Vermeer.

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And then the charges of treason were dropped.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
He had a lesser charge of forgery,

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
got a year sentence

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and died a hero to the Dutch people.

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
There's a lot more to be said about van Meegeren,

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but I want to turn now to Goering,

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
who's pictured here being interrogated at Nuremberg.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now Goering was, by all accounts, a terrible man.

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Even for a Nazi, he was a terrible man.

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
His American interrogators described him

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
as an amicable psychopath.

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But you could feel sympathy

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
for the reaction he had

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
when he was told that his favorite painting

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
was actually a forgery.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
According to his biographer,

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
"He looked as if for the first time

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
he had discovered there was evil in the world."

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And he killed himself soon afterwards.

65
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
He had discovered after all

66
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that the painting he thought was this

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
was actually that.

68
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It looked the same,

69
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
but it had a different origin, it was a different artwork.

70
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
It wasn't just him who was in for a shock.

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Once van Meegeren was on trial, he couldn't stop talking.

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And he boasted about all the great masterpieces

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that he himself had painted

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that were attributed to other artists.

75
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
In particular, "The Supper at Emmaus"

76
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
which was viewed as Vermeer's finest masterpiece, his best work --

77
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
people would come [from] all over the world to see it --

78
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
was actually a forgery.

79
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It was not that painting, but that painting.

80
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And when that was discovered,

81
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
it lost all its value and was taken away from the museum.

82
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Why does this matter?

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I'm a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much?

84
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Why do we respond so much

85
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to our knowledge of where something comes from?

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Well there's an answer that many people would give.

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Many sociologists like Veblen and Wolfe

88
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
would argue that the reason why we take origins so seriously

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is because we're snobs, because we're focused on status.

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Among other things,

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
if you want to show off how rich you are, how powerful you are,

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
it's always better to own an original than a forgery

93
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
because there's always going to be fewer originals than forgeries.

94
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I don't doubt that that plays some role,

95
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but what I want to convince you of today

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
is that there's something else going on.

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I want to convince you

98
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that humans are, to some extent, natural born essentialists.

99
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
What I mean by this

100
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
is we don't just respond to things as we see them,

101
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
or feel them, or hear them.

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Rather, our response is conditioned on our beliefs,

103
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
about what they really are, what they came from,

104
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
what they're made of, what their hidden nature is.

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I want to suggest that this is true,

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
not just for how we think about things,

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but how we react to things.

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
So I want to suggest that pleasure is deep --

109
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and that this isn't true

110
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
just for higher level pleasures like art,

111
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but even the most seemingly simple pleasures

112
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
are affected by our beliefs about hidden essences.

113
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So take food.

114
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Would you eat this?

115
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Well, a good answer is, "It depends. What is it?"

116
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Some of you would eat it if it's pork, but not beef.

117
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Some of you would eat it if it's beef, but not pork.

118
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Few of you would eat it if it's a rat

119
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
or a human.

120
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Some of you would eat it only if it's a strangely colored piece of tofu.

121
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
That's not so surprising.

122
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But what's more interesting

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is how it tastes to you

124
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
will depend critically on what you think you're eating.

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So one demonstration of this was done with young children.

126
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
How do you make children

127
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
not just be more likely to eat carrots and drink milk,

128
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but to get more pleasure from eating carrots and drinking milk --

129
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to think they taste better?

130
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's simple, you tell them they're from McDonald's.

131
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
They believe McDonald's food is tastier,

132
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and it leads them to experience it as tastier.

133
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
How do you get adults to really enjoy wine?

134
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It's very simple:

135
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
pour it from an expensive bottle.

136
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
There are now dozens, perhaps hundreds of studies showing

137
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that if you believe you're drinking the expensive stuff,

138
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
it tastes better to you.

139
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
This was recently done with a neuroscientific twist.

140
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
They get people into a fMRI scanner,

141
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and while they're lying there, through a tube,

142
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
they get to sip wine.

143
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
In front of them on a screen is information about the wine.

144
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Everybody, of course,

145
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
drinks exactly the same wine.

146
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But if you believe you're drinking expensive stuff,

147
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
parts of the brain associated with pleasure and reward

148
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
light up like a Christmas tree.

149
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It's not just that you say it's more pleasurable, you say you like it more,

150
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
you really experience it in a different way.

151
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Or take sex.

152
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
These are stimuli I've used in some of my studies.

153
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And if you simply show people these pictures,

154
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
they'll say these are fairly attractive people.

155
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But how attractive you find them,

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
how sexually or romantically moved you are by them,

157
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
rests critically on who you think you're looking at.

158
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You probably think the picture on the left is male,

159
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the one on the right is female.

160
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
If that belief turns out to be mistaken, it will make a difference.

161
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Laughter)

162
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It will make a difference if they turn out to be

163
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
much younger or much older than you think they are.

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It will make a difference if you were to discover

165
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that the person you're looking at with lust

166
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
is actually a disguised version of your son or daughter,

167
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
your mother or father.

168
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Knowing somebody's your kin typically kills the libido.

169
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Maybe one of the most heartening findings

170
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
from the psychology of pleasure

171
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is there's more to looking good than your physical appearance.

172
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
If you like somebody, they look better to you.

173
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
This is why spouses in happy marriages

174
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
tend to think that their husband or wife

175
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do.

176
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

177
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
A particularly dramatic example of this

178
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
comes from a neurological disorder known as Capgras syndrome.

179
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So Capgras syndrome is a disorder

180
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
where you get a specific delusion.

181
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Sufferers of Capgras syndrome

182
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
believe that the people they love most in the world

183
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
have been replaced by perfect duplicates.

184
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Now often, a result of Capgras syndrome is tragic.

185
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
People have murdered those that they loved,

186
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
believing that they were murdering an imposter.

187
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But there's at least one case

188
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
where Capgras syndrome had a happy ending.

189
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
This was recorded in 1931.

190
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
"Research described a woman with Capgras syndrome

191
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
who complained about her poorly endowed and sexually inadequate lover."

192
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But that was before she got Capgras syndrome.

193
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
After she got it, "She was happy to report

194
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that she has discovered that he possessed a double

195
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
who was rich, virile, handsome and aristocratic."

196
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Of course, it was the same man,

197
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but she was seeing him in different ways.

198
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
As a third example,

199
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
consider consumer products.

200
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So one reason why you might like something is its utility.

201
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You can put shoes on your feet; you can play golf with golf clubs;

202
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and chewed up bubble gum doesn't do anything at all for you.

203
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But each of these three objects has value

204
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
above and beyond what it can do for you

205
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
based on its history.

206
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The golf clubs were owned by John F. Kennedy

207
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and sold for three-quarters of a million dollars at auction.

208
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
The bubble gum was chewed up by pop star Britney Spears

209
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and sold for several hundreds of dollars.

210
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And in fact, there's a thriving market

211
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in the partially eaten food of beloved people.

212
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Laughter)

213
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
The shoes are perhaps the most valuable of all.

214
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
According to an unconfirmed report,

215
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
a Saudi millionaire offered 10 million dollars

216
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
for this pair of shoes.

217
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
They were the ones thrown at George Bush

218
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
at an Iraqi press conference several years ago.

219
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Applause)

220
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Now this attraction to objects

221
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
doesn't just work for celebrity objects.

222
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Each one of us, most people,

223
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
have something in our life that's literally irreplaceable,

224
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
in that it has value because of its history --

225
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
maybe your wedding ring, maybe your child's baby shoes --

226
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
so that if it was lost, you couldn't get it back.

227
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You could get something that looked like it or felt like it,

228
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but you couldn't get the same object back.

229
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
With my colleagues George Newman and Gil Diesendruck,

230
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
we've looked to see what sort of factors, what sort of history, matters

231
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
for the objects that people like.

232
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So in one of our experiments,

233
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
we asked people to name a famous person who they adored,

234
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
a living person they adored.

235
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So one answer was George Clooney.

236
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Then we asked them,

237
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
"How much would you pay for George Clooney's sweater?"

238
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And the answer is a fair amount --

239
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
more than you would pay for a brand new sweater

240
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
or a sweater owned by somebody who you didn't adore.

241
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Then we asked other groups of subjects --

242
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
we gave them different restrictions

243
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and different conditions.

244
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So for instance, we told some people,

245
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
"Look, you can buy the sweater,

246
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
but you can't tell anybody you own it,

247
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and you can't resell it."

248
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
That drops the value of it,

249
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
suggesting that that's one reason why we like it.

250
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But what really causes an effect

251
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is you tell people, "Look, you could resell it, you could boast about it,

252
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
but before it gets to you,

253
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
it's thoroughly washed."

254
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
That causes a huge drop in the value.

255
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
As my wife put it, "You've washed away the Clooney cooties."

256
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
(Laughter)

257
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So let's go back to art.

258
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I would love a Chagall. I love the work of Chagall.

259
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
If people want to get me something at the end of the conference,

260
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
you could buy me a Chagall.

261
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But I don't want a duplicate,

262
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
even if I can't tell the difference.

263
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
That's not because, or it's not simply because,

264
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I'm a snob and want to boast about having an original.

265
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Rather, it's because I want something that has a specific history.

266
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
In the case of artwork,

267
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the history is special indeed.

268
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
The philosopher Denis Dutton

269
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
in his wonderful book "The Art Instinct"

270
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
makes the case that, "The value of an artwork

271
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is rooted in assumptions about the human performance underlying its creation."

272
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And that could explain the difference

273
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
between an original and a forgery.

274
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
They may look alike, but they have a different history.

275
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
The original is typically the product of a creative act,

276
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the forgery isn't.

277
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I think this approach can explain differences

278
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
in people's taste in art.

279
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
This is a work by Jackson Pollock.

280
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Who here likes the work of Jackson Pollock?

281
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Okay. Who here, it does nothing for them?

282
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
They just don't like it.

283
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I'm not going to make a claim about who's right,

284
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but I will make an empirical claim

285
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
about people's intuitions,

286
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
which is that, if you like the work of Jackson Pollock,

287
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
you'll tend more so than the people who don't like it

288
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to believe that these works are difficult to create,

289
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that they require a lot of time and energy

290
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and creative energy.

291
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I use Jackson Pollock on purpose as an example

292
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
because there's a young American artist

293
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
who paints very much in the style of Jackson Pollock,

294
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and her work was worth

295
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
many tens of thousands of dollars --

296
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
in large part because she's a very young artist.

297
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
This is Marla Olmstead

298
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
who did most of her work when she was three years old.

299
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
The interesting thing about Marla Olmstead

300
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
is her family made the mistake

301
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
of inviting the television program 60 Minutes II into their house

302
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to film her painting.

303
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And they then reported that her father was coaching her.

304
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
When this came out on television,

305
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
the value of her art dropped to nothing.

306
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It was the same art, physically,

307
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
but the history had changed.

308
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I've been focusing now on the visual arts,

309
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
but I want to give two examples from music.

310
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
This is Joshua Bell, a very famous violinist.

311
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And the Washington Post reporter Gene Weingarten

312
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
decided to enlist him for an audacious experiment.

313
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
The question is: How much would people like Joshua Bell,

314
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
the music of Joshua Bell,

315
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
if they didn't know they were listening to Joshua Bell?

316
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So he got Joshua Bell to take his million dollar violin

317
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
down to a Washington D.C. subway station

318
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and stand in the corner and see how much money he would make.

319
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And here's a brief clip of this.

320
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Violin music)

321
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
After being there for three-quarters of an hour,

322
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
he made 32 dollars.

323
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Not bad. It's also not good.

324
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Apparently to really enjoy the music of Joshua Bell,

325
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
you have to know you're listening to Joshua Bell.

326
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
He actually made 20 dollars more than that,

327
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but he didn't count it.

328
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Because this woman comes up --

329
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
you see at the end of the video -- she comes up.

330
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
She had heard him at the Library of Congress a few weeks before

331
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
at this extravagant black-tie affair.

332
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So she's stunned that he's standing in a subway station.

333
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So she's struck with pity.

334
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
She reaches into her purse and hands him a 20.

335
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
(Laughter)

336
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
(Applause)

337
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
The second example from music

338
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
is from John Cage's modernist composition,

339
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
"4'33"."

340
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
As many of you know,

341
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
this is the composition where the pianist sits at a bench,

342
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
opens up the piano

343
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and sits and does nothing for four minutes and 33 seconds --

344
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
that period of silence.

345
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And people have different views on this.

346
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
But what I want to point out

347
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
is you can buy this from iTunes.

348
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
(Laughter)

349
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
For a dollar 99,

350
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
you can listen to that silence,

351
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
which is different than other forms of silence.

352
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Laughter)

353
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Now I've been talking so far about pleasure,

354
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
but what I want to suggest

355
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is that everything I've said applies as well to pain.

356
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And how you think about what you're experiencing,

357
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
your beliefs about the essence of it,

358
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
affect how it hurts.

359
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
One lovely experiment

360
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
was done by Kurt Gray and Dan Wegner.

361
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
What they did was they hooked up Harvard undergraduates

362
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
to an electric shock machine.

363
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And they gave them a series of painful electric shocks.

364
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So it was a series of five painful shocks.

365
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Half of them are told that they're being given the shocks

366
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
by somebody in another room,

367
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
but the person in the other room doesn't know they're giving them shocks.

368
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
There's no malevolence, they're just pressing a button.

369
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
The first shock is recorded as very painful.

370
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
The second shock feels less painful, because you get a bit used to it.

371
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
The third drops, the fourth, the fifth.

372
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The pain gets less.

373
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
In the other condition,

374
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
they're told that the person in the next room

375
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
is shocking them on purpose -- knows they're shocking them.

376
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
The first shock hurts like hell.

377
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
The second shock hurts just as much,

378
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and the third and the fourth and the fifth.

379
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
It hurts more

380
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
if you believe somebody is doing it to you on purpose.

381
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
The most extreme example of this

382
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
is that in some cases,

383
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
pain under the right circumstances

384
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
can transform into pleasure.

385
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Humans have this extraordinarily interesting property

386
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that will often seek out low-level doses of pain

387
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
in controlled circumstances

388
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
and take pleasure from it --

389
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
as in the eating of hot chili peppers

390
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and roller coaster rides.

391
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
The point was nicely summarized

392
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
by the poet John Milton

393
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
who wrote, "The mind is its own place,

394
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and in itself can make a heaven of hell,

395
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
a hell of heaven."

396
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And I'll end with that. Thank you.

397
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
(Applause)

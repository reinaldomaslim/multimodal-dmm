1
0:00:12.911,000 --> 0:00:13,000
It's like a dream.

2
0:00:15.142,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Imagine, in the empty desert,

3
0:00:17.547,000 --> 0:00:2,000
you come upon a huge wheel ringed in skeletons,

4
0:00:22.174,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and someone invites you to come pull a series of heavy ropes at its base,

5
0:00:26.802,000 --> 0:00:28,000
so you walk to one side, where a team is waiting,

6
0:00:29.774,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and you all throw your backs into it,

7
0:00:31.781,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and you pull in turn,

8
0:00:34.062,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and eventually, the wheel roars to life,

9
0:00:36.487,000 --> 0:00:4,000
lights begin to flicker, and the audience cheers,

10
0:00:40.764,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and you've just activated Peter Hudson's "Charon,"

11
0:00:43.837,000 --> 0:00:45,000
one of the world's largest zoetropes.

12
0:00:47.944,000 --> 0:00:5,000
This is the farthest thing from marketable art.

13
0:00:51.911,000 --> 0:00:53,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:54.159,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's huge, it's dangerous,

15
0:00:56.682,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it takes a dozen people to run, and it doesn't go with the sofa.

16
0:01:00.035,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:01.06,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's beautifully crafted and completely useless,

18
0:01:05.257,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and it's wonderful.

19
0:01:08.48,000 --> 0:01:11,000
You're unlikely to see works like "Charon" in the art-world headlines.

20
0:01:12.9,000 --> 0:01:14,000
These days, the buying and selling of artwork

21
0:01:15.314,000 --> 0:01:17,000
often gets more attention than the works themselves.

22
0:01:18.988,000 --> 0:01:22,000
In the last year, a Jean-Michel Basquiat sold for 110 million dollars,

23
0:01:23.742,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the highest price ever achieved for the work of an American artist,

24
0:01:27.624,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and a painting by Leonardo da Vinci sold for 450 million,

25
0:01:31.788,000 --> 0:01:32,000
setting a new auction record.

26
0:01:35.223,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Still, these are big, important artists,

27
0:01:39.008,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but still, when you look at these works and you look at the headlines,

28
0:01:42.912,000 --> 0:01:44,000
you have to ask yourself,

29
0:01:45.197,000 --> 0:01:48,000
"Do I care about these because they move me,

30
0:01:48.475,000 --> 0:01:5,000
or do I care about them because they're expensive

31
0:01:51.129,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and I think they're supposed to?"

32
0:01:53.883,000 --> 0:01:56,000
In our contemporary world, it can be hard to separate those two things.

33
0:01:59.7,000 --> 0:02:,000
But what if we tried?

34
0:02:02.232,000 --> 0:02:04,000
What if we redefined art's value --

35
0:02:05.125,000 --> 0:02:06,000
not by its price tag,

36
0:02:06.483,000 --> 0:02:1,000
but by the emotional connection it creates between the artist and the audience,

37
0:02:11.306,000 --> 0:02:13,000
or the benefits it gives our society,

38
0:02:14.259,000 --> 0:02:16,000
or the fulfillment it gives the artists themselves?

39
0:02:19.951,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This is Nevada's Black Rock Desert,

40
0:02:22.348,000 --> 0:02:25,000
about as far as you can get from the galleries of New York

41
0:02:25.404,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and London and Hong Kong.

42
0:02:27.659,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And here, for just about 30 years, at Burning Man,

43
0:02:31.508,000 --> 0:02:34,000
a movement has been forming that does exactly that.

44
0:02:35.353,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Since its early anarchist years, Burning Man has grown up.

45
0:02:38.973,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Today, it's more of an experiment in collective dreaming.

46
0:02:42.943,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It's a year-round community, and every August, for a single week,

47
0:02:46.998,000 --> 0:02:51,000
70,000 people power down their technology and pilgrimage out into the desert

48
0:02:52.455,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to build an anti-consumerist society

49
0:02:54.569,000 --> 0:02:56,000
outside the bounds of their everyday lives.

50
0:02:57.505,000 --> 0:02:58,000
The conditions are brutal.

51
0:02:59.813,000 --> 0:03:,000
Strangers will hug you,

52
0:03:01.409,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and every year, you will swear it was better the last,

53
0:03:05.176,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but it's still ridiculous and freeing and alive,

54
0:03:09.359,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and the art is one thing that thrives here.

55
0:03:14.888,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So this is me on the desert playa last year

56
0:03:18.325,000 --> 0:03:2,000
with my brother, obviously hard at work.

57
0:03:20.925,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:22.107,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I'd been studying the art of Burning Man for several years,

59
0:03:24.922,000 --> 0:03:28,000
for an exhibition I curated at the Smithsonian's Renwick Gallery,

60
0:03:29.274,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and what fascinates me the most isn't the quality of the work here,

61
0:03:33.44,000 --> 0:03:35,000
which is actually rather high,

62
0:03:35.846,000 --> 0:03:39,000
it's why people come out here into the desert again and again

63
0:03:39.946,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to get their hands dirty and make in our increasingly digital age.

64
0:03:45.161,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Because it seems like this gets to something that's essentially human.

65
0:03:50.502,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Really, the entire encampment of Burning Man

66
0:03:52.884,000 --> 0:03:55,000
could be thought of as one giant interactive art installation

67
0:03:56.24,000 --> 0:03:58,000
driven by the participation of everyone in it.

68
0:03:59.754,000 --> 0:04:02,000
One thing that sets this work aside from the commercial art world

69
0:04:03.241,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is that anyone who makes work can show it.

70
0:04:06.313,000 --> 0:04:1,000
These days, around 300 art installations and countless artistic gestures

71
0:04:10.86,000 --> 0:04:11,000
go to the playa.

72
0:04:12.17,000 --> 0:04:14,000
None of them are sold there.

73
0:04:14.554,000 --> 0:04:16,000
At the end of the week, if the works aren't burned,

74
0:04:17.302,000 --> 0:04:2,000
artists have to cart them back out and store them.

75
0:04:20.475,000 --> 0:04:22,000
It's a tremendous labor of love.

76
0:04:24.905,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Though there is certainly a Burning Man aesthetic,

77
0:04:27.338,000 --> 0:04:3,000
pioneered by artists like Kate Raudenbush and Michael Christian,

78
0:04:30.877,000 --> 0:04:32,000
much of the distinctive character of the work here

79
0:04:33.297,000 --> 0:04:35,000
comes from the desert itself.

80
0:04:35.418,000 --> 0:04:36,000
For a work to succeed,

81
0:04:36.966,000 --> 0:04:38,000
it has to be portable enough to make the journey,

82
0:04:39.871,000 --> 0:04:43,000
rugged enough to withstand the wind and weather and participants,

83
0:04:44.14,000 --> 0:04:46,000
stimulating in daylight and darkness,

84
0:04:46.477,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and engaging without interpretation.

85
0:04:50.641,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Encounters with monumental and intimate works here feel surreal.

86
0:04:54.76,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Scale has a tendency to fool the eyes.

87
0:04:57.872,000 --> 0:05:,000
What looked enormous in an artist's studio could get lost on the playa,

88
0:05:01.743,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but there are virtually no spatial limits,

89
0:05:04.412,000 --> 0:05:06,000
so artists can dream as big as they can build.

90
0:05:08.216,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Some pieces bowl you over by their grace

91
0:05:11.429,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and others by the sheer audacity it took to bring them here.

92
0:05:18.49,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Burning Man's irreverent humor comes out in pieces

93
0:05:21.387,000 --> 0:05:23,000
like Rebekah Waites' "Church Trap,"

94
0:05:23.72,000 --> 0:05:27,000
a tiny country chapel set precariously on a wooden beam, like a mousetrap,

95
0:05:28.1,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that lured participants in to find religion --

96
0:05:31.593,000 --> 0:05:33,000
it was built and burned in 2013 ...

97
0:05:37.37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
while other works, like Christopher Schardt's "Firmament,"

98
0:05:40.139,000 --> 0:05:41,000
aim for the sublime.

99
0:05:41.819,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Here, under a canopy of dancing lights set to classical music,

100
0:05:45.945,000 --> 0:05:47,000
participants could escape the thumping rave beats

101
0:05:48.447,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and chaos all around.

102
0:05:53.042,000 --> 0:05:56,000
At night, the city swarms with mutant vehicles,

103
0:05:56.146,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the only cars allowed to roam the playa.

104
0:05:59.955,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And if necessity is the mother of invention,

105
0:06:02.146,000 --> 0:06:03,000
here, absurdity is its father.

106
0:06:04.154,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

107
0:06:05.193,000 --> 0:06:07,000
They zigzag from artwork to artwork

108
0:06:07.516,000 --> 0:06:1,000
like some bizarre, random public transportation system,

109
0:06:10.968,000 --> 0:06:11,000
pulsing with light and sound.

110
0:06:13.814,000 --> 0:06:16,000
When artists stop worrying about critics and collectors

111
0:06:16.968,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and start making work for themselves,

112
0:06:19.169,000 --> 0:06:21,000
these are the kinds of marvelous toys they create.

113
0:06:23.542,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And what's amazing is that, by and large, when people first come to Burning Man,

114
0:06:27.551,000 --> 0:06:28,000
they don't know how to make this stuff.

115
0:06:30.237,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It's the active collaborative maker community there

116
0:06:32.942,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that makes this possible.

117
0:06:35.376,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Collectives like Five Ton Crane come together to share skills

118
0:06:39.074,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and take on complex projects a single artist would never even attempt,

119
0:06:43.315,000 --> 0:06:47,000
from a Gothic rocket ship that appears ready to take off at any moment

120
0:06:47.727,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to a fairytale home inside a giant boot

121
0:06:50.694,000 --> 0:06:52,000
complete with shelves full of artist-made books,

122
0:06:53.417,000 --> 0:06:55,000
a blackbird pie in the oven

123
0:06:55.495,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and a climbable beanstalk.

124
0:06:59.893,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Skilled or unskilled, all are welcome.

125
0:07:02.913,000 --> 0:07:05,000
In fact, part of the charm and the innovation of the work here

126
0:07:06.591,000 --> 0:07:08,000
is that so many makers aren't artists at all,

127
0:07:09.424,000 --> 0:07:11,000
but scientists or engineers

128
0:07:11.9,000 --> 0:07:13,000
or welders or garbage collectors,

129
0:07:14.687,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and their works cross disciplinary boundaries,

130
0:07:17.679,000 --> 0:07:19,000
from a grove of origami mushrooms

131
0:07:19.759,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that developed out of the design for a yurt

132
0:07:22.57,000 --> 0:07:25,000
to a tree that responds to the voices and biorhythms

133
0:07:25.786,000 --> 0:07:26,000
of all those around it

134
0:07:27.221,000 --> 0:07:31,000
through 175,000 LEDs embedded in its leaves.

135
0:07:32.521,000 --> 0:07:37,000
In museums, a typical visitor spends less than 30 seconds with a work of art,

136
0:07:38.203,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and I often watch people wander from label to label,

137
0:07:41.504,000 --> 0:07:42,000
searching for information,

138
0:07:42.99,000 --> 0:07:44,000
as though the entire story of a work of art

139
0:07:45.23,000 --> 0:07:49,000
could be contained in that one 80-word text.

140
0:07:49.353,000 --> 0:07:52,000
But in the desert, there are no gatekeepers

141
0:07:52.504,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and no placards explaining the art, just natural curiosity.

142
0:07:57.203,000 --> 0:08:,000
You see a work on the horizon, and you ride towards it.

143
0:08:01.036,000 --> 0:08:03,000
When you arrive, you walk all around it,

144
0:08:03.616,000 --> 0:08:05,000
you touch it, you test it.

145
0:08:05.996,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Is it sturdy enough to climb on? Will I be impaled by it?

146
0:08:09.854,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Laughter)

147
0:08:11.911,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Art becomes a place for extended interaction,

148
0:08:14.697,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and although the display might be short-lived,

149
0:08:17.37,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the experience stays with you.

150
0:08:21.641,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Nowhere is that truer at Burning Man than at the Temple.

151
0:08:25.548,000 --> 0:08:28,000
In 2000, David Best and Jack Haye built the first Temple,

152
0:08:29.357,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and after a member of their team was killed tragically in an accident

153
0:08:32.828,000 --> 0:08:34,000
shortly before the event,

154
0:08:34.988,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the building became a makeshift memorial.

155
0:08:38.458,000 --> 0:08:42,000
By itself, it's a magnificent piece of architecture,

156
0:08:42.638,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but the structure is only a shell until it disappears

157
0:08:45.63,000 --> 0:08:47,000
under a thick blanket of messages.

158
0:08:48.79,000 --> 0:08:49,000
"I miss you."

159
0:08:50.353,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"Please forgive me."

160
0:08:52.345,000 --> 0:08:54,000
"Even a broken crayon still colors."

161
0:08:55.701,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Intimate testaments to the most universal of human experiences,

162
0:08:59.874,000 --> 0:09:,000
the experience of loss.

163
0:09:03.312,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The collective emotion in this place is overpowering and indescribable,

164
0:09:09.192,000 --> 0:09:12,000
before it's set afire on the last night of the event.

165
0:09:17.025,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Every year, something compels people from all different walks of life,

166
0:09:22.91,000 --> 0:09:23,000
from all over the world,

167
0:09:24.859,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to go out into the desert and make art

168
0:09:27.931,000 --> 0:09:28,000
when there is no money in it.

169
0:09:30.997,000 --> 0:09:32,000
The work's not always refined,

170
0:09:33.135,000 --> 0:09:34,000
it's not always viable,

171
0:09:34.62,000 --> 0:09:36,000
it's not even always good,

172
0:09:37.093,000 --> 0:09:41,000
but it's authentic and optimistic in a way we rarely see anywhere else.

173
0:09:43.537,000 --> 0:09:45,000
In these cynical times,

174
0:09:46.076,000 --> 0:09:51,000
it's comforting to know that we're still capable of great feats of imagination,

175
0:09:51.909,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and that when we search for connection,

176
0:09:54.599,000 --> 0:09:57,000
we come together and build cathedrals in the dust.

177
0:09:58.958,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Forget the price tags.

178
0:10:00.871,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Forget the big names.

179
0:10:02.837,000 --> 0:10:05,000
What is art for in our contemporary world if not this?

180
0:10:08.081,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Thank you.

181
0:10:09.256,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Applause)

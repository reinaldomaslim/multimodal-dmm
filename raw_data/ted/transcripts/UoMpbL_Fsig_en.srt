1
0:00:13.27,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Will we do whatever it takes to tackle climate change?

2
0:00:19.393,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I come at this question not as a green campaigner,

3
0:00:22.39,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in fact, I confess to be rather hopeless at recycling.

4
0:00:25.404,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I come at it as a professional observer of financial policy making

5
0:00:30.693,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and someone that wonders how history will judge us.

6
0:00:36.353,000 --> 0:00:37,000
One day,

7
0:00:37.633,000 --> 0:00:4,000
this ring that belonged to my grandfather

8
0:00:41.522,000 --> 0:00:43,000
will pass to my son, Charlie.

9
0:00:44.021,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And I wonder what his generation

10
0:00:46.853,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and perhaps the one that follows

11
0:00:49.183,000 --> 0:00:53,000
will make of the two lives this ring has worked.

12
0:00:54.995,000 --> 0:00:56,000
My grandfather was a coal miner.

13
0:00:58.5,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In his time,

14
0:01:00.616,000 --> 0:01:04,000
burning fossil fuels for energy and for allowing economies to develop

15
0:01:05.609,000 --> 0:01:06,000
was accepted.

16
0:01:07.198,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We know now that that is not the case

17
0:01:10.601,000 --> 0:01:13,000
because of the greenhouse gases that coal produces.

18
0:01:15.315,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But today,

19
0:01:16.556,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I fear it's the industry in which I work that will be judged more harshly

20
0:01:20.626,000 --> 0:01:22,000
because of its impact on the climate --

21
0:01:23.498,000 --> 0:01:25,000
more harshly than my grandfather's industry, even.

22
0:01:26.202,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I work, of course, in the banking industry,

23
0:01:28.912,000 --> 0:01:31,000
which will be remembered for its crisis in 2008 --

24
0:01:33.831,000 --> 0:01:37,000
a crisis that diverted the attention and finances of governments

25
0:01:38.746,000 --> 0:01:43,000
away from some really, really important promises,

26
0:01:44.151,000 --> 0:01:49,000
like promises made at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009

27
0:01:49.315,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to mobilize 100 billion dollars a year

28
0:01:52.171,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to help developing countries move away from burning fossil fuels

29
0:01:56.709,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and transition to using cleaner energy.

30
0:02:00.396,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That promise is already in jeopardy.

31
0:02:03.904,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And that's a real problem,

32
0:02:05.793,000 --> 0:02:07,000
because that transition to cleaner energy needs to happen

33
0:02:08.558,000 --> 0:02:09,000
sooner rather than later.

34
0:02:11.184,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Firstly,

35
0:02:12.364,000 --> 0:02:13,000
because greenhouse gases, once released,

36
0:02:14.366,000 --> 0:02:16,000
stay in the atmosphere for decades.

37
0:02:17.083,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And secondly,

38
0:02:18.295,000 --> 0:02:23,000
if a developing economy builds its power grid around fossil fuels today,

39
0:02:24.146,000 --> 0:02:27,000
it's going to be way more costly to change later on.

40
0:02:28.316,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So for the climate,

41
0:02:30.486,000 --> 0:02:33,000
history may judge that the banking crisis happened

42
0:02:34.336,000 --> 0:02:35,000
at just the wrong time.

43
0:02:36.92,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The story need not be this gloomy, though.

44
0:02:41.669,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Three years ago,

45
0:02:43.601,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I argued that governments could use the tools

46
0:02:46.521,000 --> 0:02:48,000
deployed to save the financial system

47
0:02:49.23,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to meet other global challenges.

48
0:02:51.918,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And these arguments are getting stronger, not weaker, with time.

49
0:02:58.334,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Let's take a brief reminder of what those tools looked like.

50
0:03:03.578,000 --> 0:03:05,000
When the financial crisis hit in 2008,

51
0:03:06.589,000 --> 0:03:08,000
the central banks of the US and UK

52
0:03:09.19,000 --> 0:03:12,000
began buying bonds issued by their own governments

53
0:03:12.649,000 --> 0:03:14,000
in a policy known as "quantitative easing."

54
0:03:15.385,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Depending on what happens to those bonds when they mature,

55
0:03:19.119,000 --> 0:03:21,000
this is money printing by another name.

56
0:03:22.35,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And boy, did they print.

57
0:03:24.784,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The US alone created four trillion dollars' worth of its own currency.

58
0:03:29.376,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This was not done in isolation.

59
0:03:31.489,000 --> 0:03:33,000
In a remarkable act of cooperation,

60
0:03:34.187,000 --> 0:03:38,000
the 188 countries that make up the International Monetary Fund, the IMF,

61
0:03:38.784,000 --> 0:03:42,000
agreed to issue 250 billion dollars' worth of their own currency --

62
0:03:42.977,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the Special Drawing Right --

63
0:03:45.073,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to boost reserves around the world.

64
0:03:47.712,000 --> 0:03:49,000
When the financial crisis moved to Europe,

65
0:03:51.626,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the European Central Bank President, Mario Draghi,

66
0:03:55.091,000 --> 0:03:57,000
promised "to do whatever it takes."

67
0:03:59.516,000 --> 0:04:,000
And they did.

68
0:04:01.696,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The Bank of Japan repeated those words -- that exact same commitment --

69
0:04:06.074,000 --> 0:04:1,000
to do "whatever it takes" to reflate their economy.

70
0:04:11.484,000 --> 0:04:12,000
In both cases,

71
0:04:13.4,000 --> 0:04:17,000
"whatever it takes" meant trillions of dollars more

72
0:04:17.663,000 --> 0:04:2,000
in money-printing policies that continue today.

73
0:04:21.334,000 --> 0:04:22,000
What this shows

74
0:04:23.146,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is that when faced with some global challenges,

75
0:04:28.062,000 --> 0:04:32,000
policy makers are able to act collectively, with urgency,

76
0:04:32.731,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and run the risks of unconventional policies like money printing.

77
0:04:39.509,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So, let's go back to that original question:

78
0:04:45.511,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Can we print money for climate finance?

79
0:04:49.201,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Three years ago,

80
0:04:50.955,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the idea of using money in this way was something of a taboo.

81
0:04:54.714,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Once you break down and dismantle the idea

82
0:04:57.914,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that money is a finite resource,

83
0:05:00.58,000 --> 0:05:04,000
governments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people

84
0:05:05.087,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to print more and more money for other causes:

85
0:05:08.337,000 --> 0:05:1,000
education, health care, welfare --

86
0:05:10.361,000 --> 0:05:11,000
even defense.

87
0:05:12.384,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And there are some truly terrible historical examples of money printing --

88
0:05:17.846,000 --> 0:05:19,000
uncontrolled money printing --

89
0:05:20.193,000 --> 0:05:21,000
leading to hyperinflation.

90
0:05:22.764,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Think: Weimar Republic in 1930;

91
0:05:26.374,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Zimbabwe more recently, in 2008,

92
0:05:29.471,000 --> 0:05:33,000
when the prices of basic goods like bread are doubling every day.

93
0:05:34.892,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But all of this is moving the public debate forward,

94
0:05:39.92,000 --> 0:05:44,000
so much so, that money printing for the people is now discussed openly

95
0:05:45.272,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in the financial media, and even in some political manifestos.

96
0:05:50.203,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But it's important the debate doesn't stop here,

97
0:05:52.766,000 --> 0:05:54,000
with printing national currencies.

98
0:05:57.912,000 --> 0:06:,000
Because climate change is a shared global problem,

99
0:06:01.875,000 --> 0:06:04,000
there are some really compelling reasons

100
0:06:04.969,000 --> 0:06:07,000
why we should be printing that international currency

101
0:06:08.422,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that's issued by the IMF,

102
0:06:10.304,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to fund it.

103
0:06:11.944,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The Special Drawing Right, or SDR,

104
0:06:15.173,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is the IMF's electronic unit of account

105
0:06:18.553,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that governments use to transfer funds amongst each other.

106
0:06:23.933,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Think of it as a peer-to-peer payment network,

107
0:06:26.698,000 --> 0:06:28,000
like Bitcoin, but for governments.

108
0:06:30.572,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And it's truly global.

109
0:06:33.005,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Each of the 188 members of the IMF hold SDR quotas

110
0:06:38.301,000 --> 0:06:4,000
as part of their foreign exchange reserves.

111
0:06:41.935,000 --> 0:06:43,000
These are national stores of wealth

112
0:06:44.247,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that countries keep to protect themselves against currency crises.

113
0:06:48.764,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And that global nature is why,

114
0:06:51.083,000 --> 0:06:53,000
at the height of the financial crisis in 2009,

115
0:06:55.41,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the IMF issued those extra 250 billion dollars --

116
0:06:59.152,000 --> 0:07:02,000
because it served as a collective global action

117
0:07:02.747,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that safeguarded countries large and small in one fell swoop.

118
0:07:09.043,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But here --

119
0:07:10.363,000 --> 0:07:11,000
here's the intriguing part.

120
0:07:13.083,000 --> 0:07:18,000
More than half of those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009 --

121
0:07:18.309,000 --> 0:07:19,000
150 billion dollars' worth --

122
0:07:20.319,000 --> 0:07:24,000
went to developed market countries who, for the most part,

123
0:07:24.658,000 --> 0:07:26,000
have a modest need for these foreign exchange reserves,

124
0:07:27.519,000 --> 0:07:29,000
because they have flexible exchange rates.

125
0:07:30.427,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So those extra reserves that were printed in 2009,

126
0:07:34.832,000 --> 0:07:37,000
in the end, for developed market countries at least,

127
0:07:38.327,000 --> 0:07:39,000
weren't really needed.

128
0:07:40.508,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And they remain unused today.

129
0:07:43.642,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So here's an idea.

130
0:07:45.026,000 --> 0:07:46,000
As a first step,

131
0:07:47.046,000 --> 0:07:5,000
why don't we start spending those unused,

132
0:07:50.136,000 --> 0:07:53,000
those extra SDRs that were printed in 2009,

133
0:07:53.627,000 --> 0:07:54,000
to combat climate change?

134
0:07:55.948,000 --> 0:07:56,000
They could, for example,

135
0:07:57.485,000 --> 0:08:01,000
be used to buy bonds issued by the UN's Green Climate Fund.

136
0:08:02.901,000 --> 0:08:04,000
This was a fund created in 2009,

137
0:08:05.821,000 --> 0:08:08,000
following that climate agreement in Copenhagen.

138
0:08:09.906,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And it was designed to channel funds towards developing countries

139
0:08:14.286,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to meet their climate projects.

140
0:08:16.377,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It's been one of the most successful funds of its type,

141
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
raising almost 10 billion dollars.

142
0:08:21.588,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But if we use those extra SDRs that were issued,

143
0:08:25.05,000 --> 0:08:28,000
it helps governments get back on track,

144
0:08:28.386,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to meet that promise of 100 billion dollars a year

145
0:08:31.233,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that was derailed by the financial crisis.

146
0:08:35.766,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It could also --

147
0:08:37.698,000 --> 0:08:39,000
it could also serve as a test case.

148
0:08:42.096,000 --> 0:08:47,000
If the inflationary consequences of using SDRs in this way are benign,

149
0:08:48.474,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it could be used to justify

150
0:08:50.453,000 --> 0:08:54,000
the additional, extra issuance of SDRs, say, every five years,

151
0:08:55.211,000 --> 0:08:57,000
again, with the commitment

152
0:08:57.63,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that developed-market countries would direct their share

153
0:09:02.084,000 --> 0:09:03,000
of the new reserves

154
0:09:03.569,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to the Green Climate Fund.

155
0:09:07.076,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Printing international money in this way has several advantages

156
0:09:10.824,000 --> 0:09:12,000
over printing national currencies.

157
0:09:13.5,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The first is it's really easy to argue

158
0:09:16.339,000 --> 0:09:2,000
that spending money to mitigate climate change benefits everyone.

159
0:09:21.366,000 --> 0:09:24,000
No one section of society benefits from the printing press over another.

160
0:09:25.249,000 --> 0:09:28,000
That problem of competing claims is mitigated.

161
0:09:29.463,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It's also fair to say

162
0:09:30.827,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that because it takes so many countries to agree to issue these extra SDRs,

163
0:09:35.978,000 --> 0:09:39,000
it's highly unlikely that money printing would get out of control.

164
0:09:40.998,000 --> 0:09:45,000
What you end up with is a collective, global action

165
0:09:46.881,000 --> 0:09:49,000
aimed -- and it's controlled global action --

166
0:09:50.236,000 --> 0:09:52,000
aimed at a global good.

167
0:09:53.637,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And,

168
0:09:54.869,000 --> 0:09:56,000
as we've learned with the money-printing schemes,

169
0:09:57.46,000 --> 0:09:59,000
whatever concerns we have can be allayed by rules.

170
0:10:00.757,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So, for example,

171
0:10:02.663,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the issuance of these extra SDRs every five years could be capped,

172
0:10:07.66,000 --> 0:10:12,000
such that this international currency is never more than five percent

173
0:10:13.279,000 --> 0:10:14,000
of global foreign exchange reserves.

174
0:10:15.781,000 --> 0:10:17,000
That's important because it would allay

175
0:10:17.83,000 --> 0:10:2,000
well, let's say, the ridiculous concerns that the US might have

176
0:10:21.75,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that the SDR could ever challenge the dollar's dominant role

177
0:10:26.296,000 --> 0:10:27,000
in international finance.

178
0:10:28.214,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And in fact,

179
0:10:30.021,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I think the only thing that the SDR would likely steal from the dollar

180
0:10:33.439,000 --> 0:10:34,000
under this scheme

181
0:10:34.932,000 --> 0:10:37,000
is its nickname, the "greenback."

182
0:10:38.427,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Because even with that cap in place,

183
0:10:42.367,000 --> 0:10:45,000
the IMF could have followed up its issuance --

184
0:10:45.855,000 --> 0:10:48,000
its massive issuance of SDRs in 2009 --

185
0:10:48.927,000 --> 0:10:52,000
with a further 200 billion dollars of SDRs in 2014.

186
0:10:54.716,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So hypothetically,

187
0:10:58.052,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that would mean that developed countries could have contributed

188
0:11:01.194,000 --> 0:11:05,000
up to 300 billion dollars' worth of SDRs

189
0:11:05.739,000 --> 0:11:06,000
to the Green Climate Fund.

190
0:11:08.186,000 --> 0:11:11,000
That's 30 times what it has today.

191
0:11:11.67,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And you know,

192
0:11:12.85,000 --> 0:11:13,000
as spectacular as that sounds,

193
0:11:15.58,000 --> 0:11:19,000
it's only just beginning to look like "whatever it takes."

194
0:11:21.129,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And just to think what amazing things could be done with that money,

195
0:11:24.471,000 --> 0:11:25,000
consider this:

196
0:11:26.618,000 --> 0:11:27,000
in 2009,

197
0:11:28.27,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Norway promised one billion dollars of its reserves to Brazil

198
0:11:33.032,000 --> 0:11:37,000
if they followed through on their goals on deforestation.

199
0:11:38.593,000 --> 0:11:44,000
That program has since delivered a 70 percent reduction in deforestation

200
0:11:44.916,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in the past decade.

201
0:11:46.926,000 --> 0:11:5,000
That's saving 3.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions,

202
0:11:51.288,000 --> 0:11:55,000
which is the equivalent of taking all American cars off the roads

203
0:11:55.843,000 --> 0:11:57,000
for three whole years.

204
0:11:59.704,000 --> 0:12:,000
So what could we do

205
0:12:01.03,000 --> 0:12:06,000
with 300 other pay-for-performance climate projects like that,

206
0:12:06.098,000 --> 0:12:08,000
organized on a global scale?

207
0:12:09.937,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We could take cars off the roads for a generation.

208
0:12:13.384,000 --> 0:12:14,000
So,

209
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:2,000
let's not quibble about whether we can afford to fund climate change.

210
0:12:20.877,000 --> 0:12:22,000
The real question is:

211
0:12:23.149,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Do we care enough about future generations

212
0:12:26.57,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to take the very same policy risks we took to save the financial system?

213
0:12:32.223,000 --> 0:12:33,000
After all,

214
0:12:34.249,000 --> 0:12:35,000
we could do it,

215
0:12:36.284,000 --> 0:12:37,000
we did do it

216
0:12:37.459,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and we are doing it today.

217
0:12:39.808,000 --> 0:12:43,000
We must, must, must do "whatever it takes."

218
0:12:45.426,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Thank you.

219
0:12:46.601,000 --> 0:12:5,000

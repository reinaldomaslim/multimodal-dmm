1
0:00:12.915,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I have a friend named Kaveh Akbar, who is a fellow poet.

2
0:00:18.721,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And Kaveh found this photo online

3
0:00:21.518,000 --> 0:00:24,000
of the anatomical heart of a blue whale

4
0:00:25.204,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that scientists had hung on a hook from the ceiling,

5
0:00:29.038,000 --> 0:00:32,000
which is how they were able to observe that the heart of a blue whale

6
0:00:32.581,000 --> 0:00:36,000
is big enough that a person can stand up fully inside of it.

7
0:00:37.499,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And when Kaveh shared this photo online,

8
0:00:40.431,000 --> 0:00:42,000
he did so with the caption,

9
0:00:42.605,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"This is another reminder

10
0:00:45.252,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that the universe has already written the poem you were planning on writing."

11
0:00:52.197,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And when I first saw that, I was horrified.

12
0:00:55.271,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I was like, "Come on, man! I'm trying to invent new metaphors!

13
0:00:58.825,000 --> 0:01:,000
I'm trying to discover beauty that hasn't been discovered yet.

14
0:01:01.787,000 --> 0:01:04,000
What do you mean, the universe is always going to get there before me?"

15
0:01:05.208,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And I know this isn't a uniquely poet problem,

16
0:01:08.792,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but on days when the world feels especially big

17
0:01:14.048,000 --> 0:01:16,000
or especially impossible

18
0:01:16.302,000 --> 0:01:19,000
or especially full of grandeur,

19
0:01:19.345,000 --> 0:01:2,000
those are the days when I feel,

20
0:01:22.492,000 --> 0:01:25,000
"What do I possibly have to contribute

21
0:01:25.757,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to all of this?"

22
0:01:28.503,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Not long ago, I saw this video that some of you may have seen.

23
0:01:31.456,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It makes the internet rounds every couple of months.

24
0:01:34.418,000 --> 0:01:36,000
There are these birds that are called starlings,

25
0:01:36.987,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and they fly in what's called a "murmuration,"

26
0:01:40.487,000 --> 0:01:42,000
which is generally just a big cloud of birds.

27
0:01:43.94,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And someone happened to catch a quick video on their phone

28
0:01:47.931,000 --> 0:01:49,000
of these starlings flying.

29
0:01:50.265,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And at first, it's just an amorphous blob,

30
0:01:53.441,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and then there's a moment where the birds shift,

31
0:01:56.417,000 --> 0:02:,000
and they form the shape of a starling

32
0:02:00.899,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in the sky!

33
0:02:02.574,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

34
0:02:03.607,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And as soon as I saw it, I was like,

35
0:02:05.654,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Gasps) "The universe has already written the poem

36
0:02:08.081,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you were planning on writing!"

37
0:02:09.672,000 --> 0:02:1,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:10.776,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Except, for the first time, it didn't fill me with despair.

39
0:02:14.09,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Instead, I thought, "OK.

40
0:02:17.168,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Maybe it's not my job to invent something new.

41
0:02:21.933,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Maybe instead it's my job to listen to what the universe is showing me

42
0:02:28.674,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and to keep myself open to what the universe offers,

43
0:02:33.191,000 --> 0:02:35,000
so that when it's my turn,

44
0:02:35.7,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I can hold something to the light,

45
0:02:38.153,000 --> 0:02:4,000
just for a moment,

46
0:02:40.226,000 --> 0:02:42,000
just for as long as I have.

47
0:02:43.942,000 --> 0:02:47,000
The universe has already written the poem

48
0:02:48.555,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that you were planning on writing.

49
0:02:51.796,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And this is why

50
0:02:53.507,000 --> 0:02:58,000
you can do nothing but point at the flock of starlings

51
0:02:59.283,000 --> 0:03:05,000
whose bodies rise and fall in inherited choreography,

52
0:03:05.432,000 --> 0:03:08,000
swarming the sky in a sweeping curtain

53
0:03:09.229,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that, for one blistering moment,

54
0:03:12.279,000 --> 0:03:14,000
forms the unmistakeable shape

55
0:03:14.865,000 --> 0:03:15,000
of a giant bird

56
0:03:16.548,000 --> 0:03:18,000
flapping against the sky.

57
0:03:19.351,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It is why your mouth forms an "o"

58
0:03:23.41,000 --> 0:03:24,000
that is not a gasp,

59
0:03:24.908,000 --> 0:03:26,000
but rather, the beginning of,

60
0:03:27.492,000 --> 0:03:29,000
"Oh. Of course."

61
0:03:30.323,000 --> 0:03:36,000
As in, of course the heart of a blue whale is as large as a house

62
0:03:36.436,000 --> 0:03:4,000
with chambers tall enough to fit a person standing.

63
0:03:40.796,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Of course a fig becomes possible

64
0:03:44.719,000 --> 0:03:48,000
when a lady wasp lays her eggs inside a flower,

65
0:03:49.27,000 --> 0:03:51,000
dies and decomposes,

66
0:03:52.209,000 --> 0:03:55,000
the fruit, evidence of her transformation.

67
0:03:55.949,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Sometimes, the poem is so bright,

68
0:03:59.387,000 --> 0:04:02,000
your silly language will not stick to it.

69
0:04:02.685,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Sometimes, the poem is so true,

70
0:04:06.043,000 --> 0:04:08,000
nobody will believe you.

71
0:04:08.395,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I am a bird

72
0:04:11.122,000 --> 0:04:13,000
made of birds.

73
0:04:13.864,000 --> 0:04:16,000
This blue heart a house you can stand up inside of.

74
0:04:17.809,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I am dying

75
0:04:20.137,000 --> 0:04:21,000
here

76
0:04:21.821,000 --> 0:04:24,000
inside this flower.

77
0:04:26.14,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It is OK.

78
0:04:27.919,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It is what I was put here to do.

79
0:04:30.923,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Take this fruit.

80
0:04:33.541,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It is what I have to offer.

81
0:04:36.224,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It may not be first,

82
0:04:38.4,000 --> 0:04:39,000
or ever best,

83
0:04:40.404,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but it is the only way to be sure

84
0:04:43.018,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that I lived at all.

85
0:04:46.094,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Applause)

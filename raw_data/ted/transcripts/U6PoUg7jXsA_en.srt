1
0:00:16.299,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'd like to invite you to close your eyes.

2
0:00:21.323,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home.

3
0:00:27.239,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'd like you to notice the color of the door,

4
0:00:30.052,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the material that it's made out of.

5
0:00:34.501,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now visualize a pack of overweight nudists on bicycles.

6
0:00:40.32,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:41.775,000 --> 0:00:43,000
They are competing in a naked bicycle race,

8
0:00:44.473,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and they are headed straight for your front door.

9
0:00:47.718,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I need you to actually see this.

10
0:00:49.583,000 --> 0:00:52,000
They are pedaling really hard, they're sweaty,

11
0:00:53.344,000 --> 0:00:55,000
they're bouncing around a lot.

12
0:00:56.519,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And they crash straight into the front door of your home.

13
0:01:00.778,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Bicycles fly everywhere, wheels roll past you,

14
0:01:04.031,000 --> 0:01:06,000
spokes end up in awkward places.

15
0:01:07.826,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Step over the threshold of your door into your foyer, your hallway,

16
0:01:12.159,000 --> 0:01:13,000
whatever's on the other side,

17
0:01:13.762,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and appreciate the quality of the light.

18
0:01:17.514,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The light is shining down on Cookie Monster.

19
0:01:24.097,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Cookie Monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse.

20
0:01:28.756,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It's a talking horse.

21
0:01:30.564,000 --> 0:01:34,000
You can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose.

22
0:01:35.404,000 --> 0:01:38,000
You can smell the oatmeal raisin cookie that he's about to shovel into his mouth.

23
0:01:39.374,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Walk past him.

24
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Walk past him into your living room.

25
0:01:43.498,000 --> 0:01:46,000
In your living room, in full imaginative broadband,

26
0:01:46.601,000 --> 0:01:48,000
picture Britney Spears.

27
0:01:49.633,000 --> 0:01:54,000
She is scantily clad, she's dancing on your coffee table,

28
0:01:54.756,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and she's singing "Hit Me Baby One More Time."

29
0:01:57.621,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And then, follow me into your kitchen.

30
0:02:00.351,000 --> 0:02:04,000
In your kitchen, the floor has been paved over with a yellow brick road,

31
0:02:04.645,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and out of your oven are coming towards you Dorothy, the Tin Man,

32
0:02:10.052,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the Scarecrow and the Lion from "The Wizard of Oz,"

33
0:02:12.997,000 --> 0:02:14,000
hand-in-hand, skipping straight towards you.

34
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Okay. Open your eyes.

35
0:02:20.346,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I want to tell you about a very bizarre contest

36
0:02:23.473,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that is held every spring in New York City.

37
0:02:26.735,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It's called the United States Memory Championship.

38
0:02:29.782,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And I had gone to cover this contest a few years back

39
0:02:32.52,000 --> 0:02:33,000
as a science journalist,

40
0:02:34.409,000 --> 0:02:39,000
expecting, I guess, that this was going to be like the Superbowl of savants.

41
0:02:40.648,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This was a bunch of guys and a few ladies,

42
0:02:43.916,000 --> 0:02:46,000
widely varying in both age and hygienic upkeep.

43
0:02:48.129,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:51.259,000 --> 0:02:54,000
They were memorizing hundreds of random numbers,

45
0:02:54.619,000 --> 0:02:55,000
looking at them just once.

46
0:02:56.031,000 --> 0:03:,000
They were memorizing the names of dozens and dozens and dozens of strangers.

47
0:03:01.229,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes.

48
0:03:04.411,000 --> 0:03:06,000
They were competing to see who could memorize

49
0:03:06.664,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards the fastest.

50
0:03:10.149,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I was like, this is unbelievable.

51
0:03:12.133,000 --> 0:03:14,000
These people must be freaks of nature.

52
0:03:15.664,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And I started talking to a few of the competitors.

53
0:03:18.578,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This is a guy called Ed Cook, who had come over from England,

54
0:03:21.942,000 --> 0:03:23,000
where he had one of the best-trained memories.

55
0:03:24.18,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And I said to him, "Ed, when did you realize

56
0:03:27.784,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that you were a savant?"

57
0:03:30.07,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And Ed was like, "I'm not a savant.

58
0:03:32.58,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In fact, I have just an average memory.

59
0:03:34.912,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Everybody who competes in this contest will tell you

60
0:03:37.945,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that they have just an average memory.

61
0:03:40.089,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We've all trained ourselves to perform these utterly miraculous feats of memory

62
0:03:46.982,000 --> 0:03:47,000
using a set of ancient techniques,

63
0:03:48.973,000 --> 0:03:5,000
techniques invented 2,500 years ago in Greece,

64
0:03:51.795,000 --> 0:03:55,000
the same techniques that Cicero had used to memorize his speeches,

65
0:03:56.787,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that medieval scholars had used to memorize entire books."

66
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And I said, "Whoa. How come I never heard of this before?"

67
0:04:05.465,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And we were standing outside the competition hall,

68
0:04:07.925,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and Ed, who is a wonderful, brilliant, but somewhat eccentric English guy,

69
0:04:14.315,000 --> 0:04:18,000
says to me, "Josh, you're an American journalist.

70
0:04:18.806,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Do you know Britney Spears?"

71
0:04:21.283,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I'm like, "What? No. Why?"

72
0:04:26.023,000 --> 0:04:28,000
"Because I really want to teach Britney Spears

73
0:04:28.477,000 --> 0:04:3,000
how to memorize the order of a shuffled pack of playing cards

74
0:04:31.381,000 --> 0:04:32,000
on U.S. national television.

75
0:04:33.191,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It will prove to the world that anybody can do this."

76
0:04:36.294,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:41.523,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I was like, "Well, I'm not Britney Spears,

78
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but maybe you could teach me.

79
0:04:47.715,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I mean, you've got to start somewhere, right?"

80
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.

81
0:04:54.005,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I ended up spending the better part of the next year

82
0:04:56.973,000 --> 0:04:57,000
not only training my memory,

83
0:04:58.791,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but also investigating it,

84
0:05:00.751,000 --> 0:05:01,000
trying to understand how it works,

85
0:05:02.759,000 --> 0:05:03,000
why it sometimes doesn't work,

86
0:05:04.762,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and what its potential might be.

87
0:05:07.436,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And I met a host of really interesting people.

88
0:05:09.653,000 --> 0:05:1,000
This is a guy called E.P.

89
0:05:11.547,000 --> 0:05:13,000
He's an amnesic who had, very possibly,

90
0:05:13.843,000 --> 0:05:15,000
the worst memory in the world.

91
0:05:16.552,000 --> 0:05:17,000
His memory was so bad,

92
0:05:18.345,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that he didn't even remember he had a memory problem,

93
0:05:21.29,000 --> 0:05:22,000
which is amazing.

94
0:05:22.848,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And he was this incredibly tragic figure,

95
0:05:24.826,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are.

96
0:05:31.306,000 --> 0:05:33,000
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this guy.

97
0:05:33.957,000 --> 0:05:36,000
This is Kim Peek, he was the basis for Dustin Hoffman's character

98
0:05:37.608,000 --> 0:05:38,000
in the movie "Rain Man."

99
0:05:39.282,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We spent an afternoon together in the Salt Lake City Public Library

100
0:05:43.472,000 --> 0:05:45,000
memorizing phone books,

101
0:05:45.627,000 --> 0:05:47,000
which was scintillating.

102
0:05:48.23,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:50.987,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And I went back and I read a whole host of memory treatises,

104
0:05:55.169,000 --> 0:05:59,000
treatises written 2,000-plus years ago in Latin,

105
0:05:59.581,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in antiquity, and then later, in the Middle Ages.

106
0:06:02.716,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And I learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff.

107
0:06:05.93,000 --> 0:06:07,000
One of the really interesting things that I learned

108
0:06:08.5,000 --> 0:06:1,000
is that once upon a time,

109
0:06:10.774,000 --> 0:06:16,000
this idea of having a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory

110
0:06:17.066,000 --> 0:06:21,000
was not nearly so alien as it would seem to us to be today.

111
0:06:22.042,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Once upon a time, people invested in their memories,

112
0:06:26.331,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in laboriously furnishing their minds.

113
0:06:31.976,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Over the last few millenia,

114
0:06:33.479,000 --> 0:06:35,000
we've invented a series of technologies --

115
0:06:36.225,000 --> 0:06:38,000
from the alphabet, to the scroll,

116
0:06:38.635,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to the codex, the printing press, photography,

117
0:06:40.954,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the computer, the smartphone --

118
0:06:43.245,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that have made it progressively easier and easier

119
0:06:45.8,000 --> 0:06:47,000
for us to externalize our memories,

120
0:06:48.63,000 --> 0:06:53,000
for us to essentially outsource this fundamental human capacity.

121
0:06:54.997,000 --> 0:06:57,000
These technologies have made our modern world possible,

122
0:06:58.276,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but they've also changed us.

123
0:07:00.307,000 --> 0:07:01,000
They've changed us culturally,

124
0:07:02.018,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and I would argue that they've changed us cognitively.

125
0:07:05.176,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Having little need to remember anymore,

126
0:07:07.906,000 --> 0:07:09,000
it sometimes seems like we've forgotten how.

127
0:07:10.994,000 --> 0:07:12,000
One of the last places on Earth where you still find

128
0:07:13.573,000 --> 0:07:18,000
people passionate about this idea of a trained, disciplined, cultivated memory,

129
0:07:18.99,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is at this totally singular memory contest.

130
0:07:21.637,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It's actually not that singular,

131
0:07:23.305,000 --> 0:07:25,000
there are contests held all over the world.

132
0:07:25.35,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And I was fascinated, I wanted to know how do these guys do it.

133
0:07:30.264,000 --> 0:07:34,000
A few years back a group of researchers at University College London

134
0:07:34.319,000 --> 0:07:36,000
brought a bunch of memory champions into the lab.

135
0:07:37.069,000 --> 0:07:38,000
They wanted to know:

136
0:07:38.349,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally,

137
0:07:41.308,000 --> 0:07:43,000
anatomically different from the rest of ours?

138
0:07:44.506,000 --> 0:07:45,000
The answer was no.

139
0:07:47.821,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Are they smarter than the rest of us?

140
0:07:50.567,000 --> 0:07:53,000
They gave them a bunch of cognitive tests, and the answer was: not really.

141
0:07:54.329,000 --> 0:07:57,000
There was, however, one really interesting and telling difference

142
0:07:57.575,000 --> 0:07:59,000
between the brains of the memory champions

143
0:07:59.683,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and the control subjects that they were comparing them to.

144
0:08:02.942,000 --> 0:08:04,000
When they put these guys in an fMRI machine,

145
0:08:05.959,000 --> 0:08:08,000
scanned their brains while they were memorizing numbers

146
0:08:09.32,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and people's faces and pictures of snowflakes,

147
0:08:11.977,000 --> 0:08:15,000
they found that the memory champions were lighting up different parts of the brain

148
0:08:16.857,000 --> 0:08:17,000
than everyone else.

149
0:08:18.548,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Of note, they were using, or they seemed to be using,

150
0:08:21.833,000 --> 0:08:25,000
a part of the brain that's involved in spatial memory and navigation.

151
0:08:26.79,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Why?

152
0:08:27.973,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And is there something that the rest of us can learn from this?

153
0:08:33.107,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The sport of competitive memorizing is driven by a kind of arms race where,

154
0:08:39.83,000 --> 0:08:44,000
every year, somebody comes up with a new way to remember more stuff more quickly,

155
0:08:44.913,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and then the rest of the field has to play catch-up.

156
0:08:47.389,000 --> 0:08:48,000
This is my friend Ben Pridmore,

157
0:08:49.032,000 --> 0:08:51,000
three-time world memory champion.

158
0:08:51.198,000 --> 0:08:56,000
On his desk in front of him are 36 shuffled packs of playing cards

159
0:08:56.38,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that he is about to try to memorize in one hour,

160
0:08:59.468,000 --> 0:09:03,000
using a technique that he invented and he alone has mastered.

161
0:09:03.547,000 --> 0:09:05,000
He used a similar technique

162
0:09:06.292,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to memorize the precise order of 4,140 random binary digits

163
0:09:13.114,000 --> 0:09:15,000
in half an hour.

164
0:09:15.189,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Laughter)

165
0:09:16.737,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Yeah.

166
0:09:18.833,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And while there are a whole host of ways

167
0:09:21.683,000 --> 0:09:25,000
of remembering stuff in these competitions,

168
0:09:25.718,000 --> 0:09:27,000
everything, all of the techniques that are being used,

169
0:09:28.4,000 --> 0:09:3,000
ultimately come down to a concept

170
0:09:30.76,000 --> 0:09:33,000
that psychologists refer to as "elaborative encoding."

171
0:09:34.577,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And it's well-illustrated by a nifty paradox

172
0:09:37.089,000 --> 0:09:4,000
known as the Baker/baker paradox, which goes like this:

173
0:09:40.697,000 --> 0:09:42,000
If I tell two people to remember the same word,

174
0:09:43.593,000 --> 0:09:44,000
if I say to you,

175
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"Remember that there is a guy named Baker."

176
0:09:48.787,000 --> 0:09:49,000
That's his name.

177
0:09:50.293,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And I say to you, "Remember that there is a guy who is a baker."

178
0:09:55.081,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Okay?

179
0:09:56.714,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And I come back to you at some point later on,

180
0:09:59.92,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and I say, "Do you remember that word that I told you a while back?

181
0:10:03.639,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Do you remember what it was?"

182
0:10:05.535,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The person who was told his name is Baker

183
0:10:08.802,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is less likely to remember the same word

184
0:10:11.887,000 --> 0:10:14,000
than the person was told his job is a baker.

185
0:10:15.498,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Same word, different amount of remembering; that's weird.

186
0:10:18.609,000 --> 0:10:19,000
What's going on here?

187
0:10:20.276,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Well, the name Baker doesn't actually mean anything to you.

188
0:10:25.294,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It is entirely untethered from all of the other memories

189
0:10:29.531,000 --> 0:10:3,000
floating around in your skull.

190
0:10:31.046,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But the common noun "baker" -- we know bakers.

191
0:10:34.558,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Bakers wear funny white hats.

192
0:10:36.383,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Bakers have flour on their hands.

193
0:10:38.01,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Bakers smell good when they come home from work.

194
0:10:40.61,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Maybe we even know a baker.

195
0:10:42.349,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And when we first hear that word,

196
0:10:44.102,000 --> 0:10:46,000
we start putting these associational hooks into it,

197
0:10:46.642,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that make it easier to fish it back out at some later date.

198
0:10:51.101,000 --> 0:10:55,000
The entire art of what is going on in these memory contests,

199
0:10:55.612,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and the entire art of remembering stuff better in everyday life,

200
0:10:59.448,000 --> 0:11:02,000
is figuring out ways to transform capital B Bakers

201
0:11:03.233,000 --> 0:11:04,000
into lower-case B bakers --

202
0:11:05.122,000 --> 0:11:08,000
to take information that is lacking in context,

203
0:11:08.434,000 --> 0:11:1,000
in significance, in meaning,

204
0:11:10.514,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and transform it in some way,

205
0:11:12.064,000 --> 0:11:16,000
so that it becomes meaningful in the light of all the other things

206
0:11:16.286,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that you have in your mind.

207
0:11:19.88,000 --> 0:11:22,000
One of the more elaborate techniques for doing this

208
0:11:23.147,000 --> 0:11:26,000
dates back 2,500 years to Ancient Greece.

209
0:11:26.84,000 --> 0:11:28,000
It came to be known as the memory palace.

210
0:11:29.228,000 --> 0:11:31,000
The story behind its creation goes like this:

211
0:11:32.687,000 --> 0:11:36,000
There was a poet called Simonides, who was attending a banquet.

212
0:11:37.118,000 --> 0:11:39,000
He was actually the hired entertainment,

213
0:11:39.206,000 --> 0:11:42,000
because back then, if you wanted to throw a really slamming party,

214
0:11:42.326,000 --> 0:11:44,000
you didn't hire a D.J., you hired a poet.

215
0:11:45.497,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And he stands up, delivers his poem from memory, walks out the door,

216
0:11:50.956,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and at the moment he does,

217
0:11:53.084,000 --> 0:11:54,000
the banquet hall collapses.

218
0:11:56.155,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Kills everybody inside.

219
0:11:59.013,000 --> 0:12:,000
It doesn't just kill everybody,

220
0:12:00.959,000 --> 0:12:02,000
it mangles the bodies beyond all recognition.

221
0:12:05.053,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Nobody can say who was inside,

222
0:12:07.426,000 --> 0:12:09,000
nobody can say where they were sitting.

223
0:12:10.014,000 --> 0:12:12,000
The bodies can't be properly buried.

224
0:12:12.253,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It's one tragedy compounding another.

225
0:12:16.873,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Simonides, standing outside,

226
0:12:18.8,000 --> 0:12:2,000
the sole survivor amid the wreckage,

227
0:12:20.931,000 --> 0:12:24,000
closes his eyes and has this realization,

228
0:12:25.348,000 --> 0:12:26,000
which is that in his mind's eye,

229
0:12:27.313,000 --> 0:12:31,000
he can see where each of the guests at the banquet had been sitting.

230
0:12:32.71,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And he takes the relatives by the hand,

231
0:12:34.846,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and guides them each to their loved ones amid the wreckage.

232
0:12:39.258,000 --> 0:12:41,000
What Simonides figured out at that moment,

233
0:12:42.28,000 --> 0:12:45,000
is something that I think we all kind of intuitively know,

234
0:12:45.503,000 --> 0:12:5,000
which is that, as bad as we are at remembering names and phone numbers,

235
0:12:50.654,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and word-for-word instructions from our colleagues,

236
0:12:53.677,000 --> 0:12:57,000
we have really exceptional visual and spatial memories.

237
0:12:59.12,000 --> 0:13:02,000
If I asked you to recount the first 10 words of the story

238
0:13:02.867,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that I just told you about Simonides,

239
0:13:05.493,000 --> 0:13:07,000
chances are you would have a tough time with it.

240
0:13:08.087,000 --> 0:13:12,000
But, I would wager that if I asked you to recall

241
0:13:12.53,000 --> 0:13:16,000
who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse

242
0:13:17.251,000 --> 0:13:19,000
in your foyer right now,

243
0:13:19.291,000 --> 0:13:2,000
you would be able to see that.

244
0:13:21.758,000 --> 0:13:23,000
The idea behind the memory palace

245
0:13:23.958,000 --> 0:13:27,000
is to create this imagined edifice in your mind's eye,

246
0:13:28.545,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and populate it with images of the things that you want to remember --

247
0:13:32.632,000 --> 0:13:35,000
the crazier, weirder, more bizarre,

248
0:13:35.901,000 --> 0:13:38,000
funnier, raunchier, stinkier the image is,

249
0:13:39.772,000 --> 0:13:41,000
the more unforgettable it's likely to be.

250
0:13:42.439,000 --> 0:13:44,000
This is advice that goes back 2,000-plus years

251
0:13:45.209,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to the earliest Latin memory treatises.

252
0:13:47.766,000 --> 0:13:48,000
So how does this work?

253
0:13:49.733,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Let's say that you've been invited to TED center stage to give a speech,

254
0:13:56.54,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and you want to do it from memory,

255
0:13:59.202,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and you want to do it the way that Cicero would have done it,

256
0:14:03.81,000 --> 0:14:06,000
if he had been invited to TEDxRome 2,000 years ago.

257
0:14:07.722,000 --> 0:14:08,000
(Laughter)

258
0:14:08.944,000 --> 0:14:09,000
What you might do

259
0:14:10.739,000 --> 0:14:14,000
is picture yourself at the front door of your house.

260
0:14:16.344,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And you'd come up with some sort of crazy, ridiculous, unforgettable image,

261
0:14:21.593,000 --> 0:14:23,000
to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about

262
0:14:24.385,000 --> 0:14:26,000
is this totally bizarre contest.

263
0:14:26.667,000 --> 0:14:27,000
(Laughter)

264
0:14:27.825,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And then you'd go inside your house,

265
0:14:29.814,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and you would see an image of Cookie Monster on top of Mister Ed.

266
0:14:34.553,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And that would remind you

267
0:14:35.822,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that you would want to then introduce your friend Ed Cook.

268
0:14:39.193,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And then you'd see an image of Britney Spears

269
0:14:41.66,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell.

270
0:14:44.472,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And you'd go into your kitchen,

271
0:14:46.001,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and the fourth topic you were going to talk about

272
0:14:48.357,000 --> 0:14:5,000
was this strange journey that you went on for a year,

273
0:14:50.927,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and you'd have some friends to help you remember that.

274
0:14:56.308,000 --> 0:14:59,000
This is how Roman orators memorized their speeches --

275
0:15:00.11,000 --> 0:15:03,000
not word-for-word, which is just going to screw you up,

276
0:15:03.431,000 --> 0:15:05,000
but topic-for-topic.

277
0:15:06.137,000 --> 0:15:08,000
In fact, the phrase "topic sentence" --

278
0:15:09.993,000 --> 0:15:11,000
that comes from the Greek word "topos,"

279
0:15:12.462,000 --> 0:15:13,000
which means "place."

280
0:15:13.843,000 --> 0:15:17,000
That's a vestige of when people used to think about oratory and rhetoric

281
0:15:18.054,000 --> 0:15:19,000
in these sorts of spatial terms.

282
0:15:19.968,000 --> 0:15:21,000
The phrase "in the first place,"

283
0:15:22.298,000 --> 0:15:24,000
that's like "in the first place of your memory palace."

284
0:15:25.871,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I thought this was just fascinating,

285
0:15:27.617,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and I got really into it.

286
0:15:29.174,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And I went to a few more of these memory contests,

287
0:15:31.956,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and I had this notion that I might write something longer

288
0:15:34.695,000 --> 0:15:36,000
about this subculture of competitive memorizers.

289
0:15:38.02,000 --> 0:15:39,000
But there was a problem.

290
0:15:39.837,000 --> 0:15:42,000
The problem was that a memory contest

291
0:15:42.909,000 --> 0:15:45,000
is a pathologically boring event.

292
0:15:46.165,000 --> 0:15:49,000
(Laughter)

293
0:15:49.348,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Truly, it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the SATs --

294
0:15:53.893,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I mean, the most dramatic it gets

295
0:15:55.624,000 --> 0:15:57,000
is when somebody starts massaging their temples.

296
0:15:57.957,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And I'm a journalist, I need something to write about.

297
0:16:00.528,000 --> 0:16:03,000
I know that there's incredible stuff happening in these people's minds,

298
0:16:03.98,000 --> 0:16:04,000
but I don't have access to it.

299
0:16:05.749,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And I realized, if I was going to tell this story,

300
0:16:08.924,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I needed to walk in their shoes a little bit.

301
0:16:11.742,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And so I started trying to spend 15 or 20 minutes

302
0:16:14.857,000 --> 0:16:16,000
every morning, before I sat down with my New York Times,

303
0:16:17.619,000 --> 0:16:19,000
just trying to remember something.

304
0:16:20.189,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Maybe it was a poem,

305
0:16:21.814,000 --> 0:16:24,000
maybe it was names from an old yearbook that I bought at a flea market.

306
0:16:26.504,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And I found that this was shockingly fun.

307
0:16:31.999,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I never would have expected that.

308
0:16:33.912,000 --> 0:16:36,000
It was fun because this is actually not about training your memory.

309
0:16:37.159,000 --> 0:16:39,000
What you're doing, is you're trying to get better and better

310
0:16:40.179,000 --> 0:16:42,000
at creating, at dreaming up,

311
0:16:42.235,000 --> 0:16:45,000
these utterly ludicrous, raunchy, hilarious,

312
0:16:45.645,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and hopefully unforgettable images in your mind's eye.

313
0:16:49.254,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And I got pretty into it.

314
0:16:50.837,000 --> 0:16:55,000
This is me wearing my standard competitive memorizer's training kit.

315
0:16:56.798,000 --> 0:16:57,000
(Laughter)

316
0:16:58.035,000 --> 0:16:59,000
It's a pair of earmuffs

317
0:16:59.46,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and a set of safety goggles that have been masked over

318
0:17:03.436,000 --> 0:17:05,000
except for two small pinholes,

319
0:17:05.542,000 --> 0:17:1,000
because distraction is the competitive memorizer's greatest enemy.

320
0:17:11.944,000 --> 0:17:13,000
I ended up coming back to that same contest

321
0:17:14.933,000 --> 0:17:15,000
that I had covered a year earlier,

322
0:17:16.798,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and I had this notion that I might enter it,

323
0:17:18.948,000 --> 0:17:21,000
sort of as an experiment in participatory journalism.

324
0:17:22.797,000 --> 0:17:25,000
It'd make, I thought, maybe a nice epilogue to all my research.

325
0:17:26.365,000 --> 0:17:29,000
Problem was, the experiment went haywire.

326
0:17:30.508,000 --> 0:17:31,000
I won the contest --

327
0:17:31.707,000 --> 0:17:32,000
(Laughter)

328
0:17:32.835,000 --> 0:17:34,000
which really wasn't supposed to happen.

329
0:17:35.731,000 --> 0:17:41,000
(Applause)

330
0:17:41.991,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Now, it is nice to be able to memorize speeches

331
0:17:46.523,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and phone numbers and shopping lists,

332
0:17:50.646,000 --> 0:17:52,000
but it's actually kind of beside the point.

333
0:17:53.162,000 --> 0:17:54,000
These are just tricks.

334
0:17:55.006,000 --> 0:17:59,000
They work because they're based on some pretty basic principles

335
0:17:59.776,000 --> 0:18:,000
about how our brains work.

336
0:18:02.063,000 --> 0:18:05,000
And you don't have to be building memory palaces

337
0:18:05.504,000 --> 0:18:07,000
or memorizing packs of playing cards

338
0:18:07.766,000 --> 0:18:11,000
to benefit from a little bit of insight about how your mind works.

339
0:18:12.167,000 --> 0:18:14,000
We often talk about people with great memories

340
0:18:14.382,000 --> 0:18:16,000
as though it were some sort of an innate gift,

341
0:18:16.555,000 --> 0:18:17,000
but that is not the case.

342
0:18:18.865,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Great memories are learned.

343
0:18:22.095,000 --> 0:18:25,000
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.

344
0:18:26.021,000 --> 0:18:28,000
We remember when we are deeply engaged.

345
0:18:28.719,000 --> 0:18:32,000
We remember when we are able to take a piece of information and experience,

346
0:18:32.885,000 --> 0:18:34,000
and figure out why it is meaningful to us,

347
0:18:34.991,000 --> 0:18:36,000
why it is significant, why it's colorful,

348
0:18:37.429,000 --> 0:18:4,000
when we're able to transform it in some way that makes sense

349
0:18:41.417,000 --> 0:18:44,000
in the light of all of the other things floating around in our minds,

350
0:18:44.781,000 --> 0:18:47,000
when we're able to transform Bakers into bakers.

351
0:18:50.376,000 --> 0:18:52,000
The memory palace, these memory techniques --

352
0:18:52.543,000 --> 0:18:53,000
they're just shortcuts.

353
0:18:53.979,000 --> 0:18:55,000
In fact, they're not even really shortcuts.

354
0:18:56.944,000 --> 0:18:58,000
They work because they make you work.

355
0:19:00.277,000 --> 0:19:03,000
They force a kind of depth of processing,

356
0:19:03.543,000 --> 0:19:04,000
a kind of mindfulness,

357
0:19:05.064,000 --> 0:19:08,000
that most of us don't normally walk around exercising.

358
0:19:09.754,000 --> 0:19:1,000
But there actually are no shortcuts.

359
0:19:12.508,000 --> 0:19:14,000
This is how stuff is made memorable.

360
0:19:15.365,000 --> 0:19:18,000
And I think if there's one thing that I want to leave you with,

361
0:19:19.015,000 --> 0:19:25,000
it's what E.P., the amnesic who couldn't even remember he had a memory problem,

362
0:19:25.567,000 --> 0:19:26,000
left me with,

363
0:19:26.788,000 --> 0:19:32,000
which is the notion that our lives are the sum of our memories.

364
0:19:34.123,000 --> 0:19:39,000
How much are we willing to lose

365
0:19:40.113,000 --> 0:19:43,000
from our already short lives,

366
0:19:43.786,000 --> 0:19:48,000
by losing ourselves in our Blackberries, our iPhones,

367
0:19:49.382,000 --> 0:19:53,000
by not paying attention to the human being across from us

368
0:19:54.268,000 --> 0:19:55,000
who is talking with us,

369
0:19:55.843,000 --> 0:19:59,000
by being so lazy that we're not willing to process deeply?

370
0:20:02.723,000 --> 0:20:03,000
I learned firsthand

371
0:20:04.467,000 --> 0:20:07,000
that there are incredible memory capacities

372
0:20:07.96,000 --> 0:20:09,000
latent in all of us.

373
0:20:10.619,000 --> 0:20:12,000
But if you want to live a memorable life,

374
0:20:13.466,000 --> 0:20:15,000
you have to be the kind of person

375
0:20:15.799,000 --> 0:20:17,000
who remembers to remember.

376
0:20:18.196,000 --> 0:20:19,000
Thank you.

377
0:20:19.372,000 --> 0:20:22,000
(Applause)

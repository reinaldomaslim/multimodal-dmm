1
0:00:13.291,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So I've experienced a lot of success in my life.

2
0:00:17.792,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Over a decade ago,

3
0:00:19.647,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I started a business straight out of uni with my mate, Scott.

4
0:00:24.17,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now, having no prior business experience

5
0:00:26.906,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and not really any grand plan --

6
0:00:29.174,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in fact, our goals when we started were not to have to get a real job

7
0:00:32.702,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:33.829,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and to not have to wear a suit to work every day.

9
0:00:36.268,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Check and check.

10
0:00:37.734,000 --> 0:00:38,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:39.703,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Today, we have thousands of amazing employees,

12
0:00:43.773,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and millions of people use our software around the planet.

13
0:00:47.245,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And technically, even outside the planet,

14
0:00:49.291,000 --> 0:00:51,000
if you count those that are currently on their way to Mars.

15
0:00:52.301,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So you'd think that I know what I'm doing every day

16
0:00:55.036,000 --> 0:00:56,000
when I go to work.

17
0:00:57.194,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Well, let me let you in on something:

18
0:00:59.007,000 --> 0:01:03,000
most days, I still feel like I often don't know what I'm doing.

19
0:01:04.802,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I've felt that way for 15 years,

20
0:01:07.388,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and I've since learned that feeling is called "impostor syndrome."

21
0:01:13.181,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Have you ever felt out of your depth,

22
0:01:15.893,000 --> 0:01:16,000
like a fraud,

23
0:01:17.841,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and just kind of guessed/bullshitted your way through the situation --

24
0:01:21.886,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:22.935,000 --> 0:01:23,000
petrified that anytime,

26
0:01:24.904,000 --> 0:01:25,000
someone was going to call you on it?

27
0:01:27.765,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Well, I can think of many examples where I felt like this.

28
0:01:31.897,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Interviewing our first HR manager,

29
0:01:33.946,000 --> 0:01:36,000
having never worked in a company that had an HR department --

30
0:01:36.978,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:38.262,000 --> 0:01:4,000
terrified as I walked into the interview,

32
0:01:41.199,000 --> 0:01:43,000
thinking, "What am I going to ask this person?"

33
0:01:43.708,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Or attending board meetings in a T-shirt surrounded by suits,

34
0:01:47.113,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and acronyms are flying around,

35
0:01:49.248,000 --> 0:01:5,000
feeling like a five-year-old

36
0:01:50.645,000 --> 0:01:52,000
as I surreptitiously write them down in my notebook,

37
0:01:53.227,000 --> 0:01:55,000
so I can look them up on Wikipedia when I get home later.

38
0:01:56.121,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:57.399,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Or, in the early days,

40
0:01:58.592,000 --> 0:02:,000
when people would call up and ask for accounts payable,

41
0:02:01.221,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I would freeze and think, "Wait, are they asking for money

42
0:02:05.087,000 --> 0:02:06,000
or giving it to us?"

43
0:02:06.562,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:09.139,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And I would cover the phone,

45
0:02:12.397,000 --> 0:02:13,000
cover the mouthpiece of the phone,

46
0:02:14.286,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and say, "Scott, you're in accounts,"

47
0:02:16.093,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and pass it across.

48
0:02:17.427,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:18.474,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We both did a lot of jobs back then.

50
0:02:21.402,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So for me, impostor syndrome is a feeling of being well, well out of your depth,

51
0:02:26.354,000 --> 0:02:28,000
yet already entrenched in the situation.

52
0:02:29.101,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Internally, you know you're not skilled enough, experienced enough

53
0:02:32.954,000 --> 0:02:34,000
or qualified enough to justify being there,

54
0:02:35.539,000 --> 0:02:36,000
yet you are there,

55
0:02:37.316,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and you have to figure a way out,

56
0:02:39.358,000 --> 0:02:4,000
because you can't just get out.

57
0:02:41.641,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It's not a fear of failure,

58
0:02:43.617,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and it's not a fear of being unable to do it.

59
0:02:47.032,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's more a sensation of getting away with something,

60
0:02:50.358,000 --> 0:02:52,000
a fear of being discovered,

61
0:02:52.564,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that at any time, someone is going to figure this out.

62
0:02:55.669,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And if they did figure it out,

63
0:02:57.206,000 --> 0:02:59,000
you'd honestly think, "Well, that's fair enough, actually."

64
0:03:00.192,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:01.866,000 --> 0:03:04,000
One of my favorite writers, Neil Gaiman, put it so beautifully

66
0:03:05.56,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in a commencement address he gave at a university, called "Make Good Art."

67
0:03:09.917,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I want to make sure I get his quote correct.

68
0:03:12.63,000 --> 0:03:15,000
"I was convinced that there would be a knock on the door,

69
0:03:16.074,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and a man with a clipboard would be there to tell me that it was all over,

70
0:03:20.935,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that they'd caught up with me,

71
0:03:22.548,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and that I would now have to go and get a real job."

72
0:03:26.194,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Now, when there's a knock on my door,

73
0:03:29.275,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I still feel like some sort of dark-suited clipboard man is going to be there

74
0:03:33.709,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to tell me that my time is kind of up.

75
0:03:36.057,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And being a crap cook,

76
0:03:37.261,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I'm quite relieved when it's just someone with a pizza for the kids.

77
0:03:40.547,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:42.752,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But it's important to note that it's not all bad.

79
0:03:45.126,000 --> 0:03:47,000
There's a lot of goodness, I think, in those feelings.

80
0:03:47.849,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And this isn't some sort of motivational-poster type talk,

81
0:03:53.679,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a "Begin it now."

82
0:03:56.554,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's more of an introspection into my own experiences of impostor syndrome,

83
0:04:00.966,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and how I've tried to learn to harness them

84
0:04:03.013,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and turn them into some sort of a force for good.

85
0:04:05.926,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And a great example of those experiences

86
0:04:07.868,000 --> 0:04:09,000
is in the early days of Atlassian's history.

87
0:04:09.99,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We were about four years old, and we had about 70 employees.

88
0:04:14.253,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And at the advice of our auditors --

89
0:04:16.441,000 --> 0:04:18,000
most good stories start with advice from an auditor --

90
0:04:19.024,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:20.064,000 --> 0:04:24,000
we entered the New South Wales Entrepreneur of the Year competition.

92
0:04:24.48,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now, we were surprised when we won

93
0:04:26.86,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the New South Wales Entrepreneur of the Year

94
0:04:28.979,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in the young category for entrepreneurs under 40.

95
0:04:31.327,000 --> 0:04:32,000
There were eight categories.

96
0:04:32.77,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And so surprised, in fact,

97
0:04:34.791,000 --> 0:04:36,000
having looked at the list of people we were up against,

98
0:04:37.408,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I didn't even turn up to the awards ceremony.

99
0:04:39.644,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So Scott collected the gong by himself.

100
0:04:42.634,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And then we traveled off to the national awards.

101
0:04:46.169,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I thought I should probably turn up to those.

102
0:04:48.342,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So we rented some suits,

103
0:04:50.247,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I invited a girl that I had just met --

104
0:04:52.629,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we'll get to her in a second --

105
0:04:54.144,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:55.214,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and off we went to the big black-tie gala.

107
0:04:58.656,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now, our surprise turned to shock

108
0:05:01.069,000 --> 0:05:03,000
in the first award of the night, the young category,

109
0:05:03.603,000 --> 0:05:04,000
when we beat all of the other states

110
0:05:05.372,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and won the Australian Young Entrepreneur of the Year.

111
0:05:07.952,000 --> 0:05:08,000
When the shock had worn off,

112
0:05:09.314,000 --> 0:05:11,000
we got a lot of champagne to the table and the party began,

113
0:05:12.115,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and the night was surely over.

114
0:05:13.6,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We were having a royally great time.

115
0:05:15.472,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Fast-forward to the last award of the night,

116
0:05:18.215,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and our shock turned into everybody's shock

117
0:05:20.804,000 --> 0:05:22,000
when we won the Australian Entrepreneur of the Year

118
0:05:23.262,000 --> 0:05:24,000
against all of the other categories.

119
0:05:25.068,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Now, so shocked was everybody else, in fact,

120
0:05:27.177,000 --> 0:05:29,000
that the announcer, the CEO of Ernst and Young,

121
0:05:29.442,000 --> 0:05:3,000
opened the envelope,

122
0:05:30.639,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and the first words out of his mouth were, "Oh my God."

123
0:05:33.282,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:34.52,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And then he reset himself and announced that we had won.

125
0:05:37.296,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

126
0:05:38.685,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So we knew we were in way too deep.

127
0:05:41.201,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And from there, the water got a lot deeper,

128
0:05:43.283,000 --> 0:05:45,000
because we jetted off to Monte Carlo

129
0:05:45.337,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to represent Australia in the World Entrepreneur of the Year

130
0:05:48.477,000 --> 0:05:49,000
against 40 other different countries.

131
0:05:51.723,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Now, in another rented suit, I was at one of the dinners

132
0:05:55.595,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and sitting next to a lovely man called Belmiro de Azevedo,

133
0:05:59.594,000 --> 0:06:,000
who was the winner from Portugal.

134
0:06:01.322,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Total champion.

135
0:06:02.571,000 --> 0:06:05,000
At 65, he had been running his business for 40 years.

136
0:06:06.313,000 --> 0:06:07,000
He had 30,000 employees.

137
0:06:08.157,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Don't forget, at the time, we had 70.

138
0:06:10.468,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And he had four billion euro in turnover.

139
0:06:13.05,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And after a couple of wines,

140
0:06:15.192,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I remember admitting to him that I felt that we did not deserve to be there,

141
0:06:19.431,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that we were well out of our depth,

142
0:06:21.144,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and at some time, someone was going to figure this out

143
0:06:23.75,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and send us home to Australia.

144
0:06:25.962,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And he, I remember, just paused and looked at me

145
0:06:28.454,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and said that he felt exactly the same way

146
0:06:31.764,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and that he suspected all the winners were feeling that way,

147
0:06:35.112,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and that despite not knowing Scott or I or really anything about technology,

148
0:06:38.785,000 --> 0:06:4,000
he said that we were obviously doing something right

149
0:06:41.288,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and should probably just keep going.

150
0:06:43.046,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

151
0:06:44.124,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Now, this was a pretty big light bulb moment for me for two reasons.

152
0:06:47.72,000 --> 0:06:49,000
One, I realized that other people felt this as well.

153
0:06:50.593,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And two, I realized it doesn't go away with any form of success.

154
0:06:54.53,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I had assumed that successful people didn't feel like frauds,

155
0:06:58.184,000 --> 0:07:,000
and I now know that the opposite is more likely to be true.

156
0:07:01.878,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And this isn't just a feeling that I have at work.

157
0:07:04.319,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It happens in my personal life, too.

158
0:07:06.463,000 --> 0:07:07,000
In the early days,

159
0:07:07.669,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I was flying back and forth to San Francisco every week for Atlassian,

160
0:07:11.013,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and I racked up a lot of frequent flyer points

161
0:07:13.226,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and got access to the Qantas business lounge.

162
0:07:15.362,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now, if there's ever a place that I don't belong ...

163
0:07:17.856,000 --> 0:07:18,000
(Laughter)

164
0:07:19.06,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It doesn't help when I walk in and they generally look at me in shorts and jeans,

165
0:07:22.976,000 --> 0:07:25,000
or jeans and a T-shirt, and say, "Can I help you, son? Are you lost?"

166
0:07:26.951,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But anyway, sometimes life happens in the Qantas lounge

167
0:07:30.431,000 --> 0:07:31,000
when you'd least expect it.

168
0:07:31.938,000 --> 0:07:32,000
One morning, over a decade ago,

169
0:07:33.537,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I was sitting there on my regularly weekly commute,

170
0:07:35.958,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and a beautiful woman from way out of my league

171
0:07:38.864,000 --> 0:07:42,000
walked into the Qantas lounge and continued walking straight up to me

172
0:07:43.109,000 --> 0:07:44,000
in a case of mistaken identity.

173
0:07:46.196,000 --> 0:07:47,000
She thought I was someone else,

174
0:07:47.748,000 --> 0:07:49,000
so in this case, I actually was an impostor.

175
0:07:50.319,000 --> 0:07:52,000
(Laughter)

176
0:07:52.683,000 --> 0:07:55,000
But rather than freeze as I would have historically done

177
0:07:56.151,000 --> 0:08:,000
or chivalrously maybe informed her of her error,

178
0:08:00.485,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I just tried to keep the conversation going.

179
0:08:02.851,000 --> 0:08:03,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:04.097,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And classic Australian bullshit became some sort of forward movement

181
0:08:07.425,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and a phone number.

182
0:08:08.972,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And I took that girl to the awards ceremony a couple of months later.

183
0:08:15.319,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And more than a decade later,

184
0:08:17.04,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I'm incredibly happy that she is now my wife,

185
0:08:19.256,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and we have four amazing children together.

186
0:08:21.367,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Applause)

187
0:08:27.351,000 --> 0:08:29,000
But you'd think that when I wake up every morning,

188
0:08:29.747,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I wouldn't roll over and look at her and think, "She's going to say,

189
0:08:33.153,000 --> 0:08:35,000
'Who are you, and who gave you that side of the bed?'

190
0:08:35.791,000 --> 0:08:36,000
(Laughter)

191
0:08:36.863,000 --> 0:08:37,000
'Get out of here.'"

192
0:08:38.522,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But she doesn't.

193
0:08:40.157,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And I think she sometimes feels the same way.

194
0:08:43.78,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And apparently, that's one of the reasons

195
0:08:45.808,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that we'll likely have a successful marriage.

196
0:08:47.989,000 --> 0:08:48,000
You see, in researching this talk,

197
0:08:49.691,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I learned that one of the attributes of the most successful relationships

198
0:08:53.185,000 --> 0:08:55,000
is when both partners feel out of their league.

199
0:08:55.964,000 --> 0:08:57,000
They feel that their partner is out of their league.

200
0:08:58.436,000 --> 0:08:59,000
They feel like impostors.

201
0:09:00.177,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And if they don't freeze, and they're thankful,

202
0:09:02.793,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and they work harder and they stretch to be the best partner they can,

203
0:09:06.145,000 --> 0:09:08,000
it's likely to be a very successful relationship.

204
0:09:08.528,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So if you have this feeling, don't freeze.

205
0:09:11.233,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Try to keep the conversation going,

206
0:09:14.076,000 --> 0:09:16,000
even if she thinks that you're somebody that you're not.

207
0:09:18.514,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Now, feeling like, or people thinking I'm someone I'm not

208
0:09:21.263,000 --> 0:09:22,000
actually happens quite frequently.

209
0:09:23.622,000 --> 0:09:25,000
A great example from my more recent past,

210
0:09:26.033,000 --> 0:09:29,000
a few months ago, I was up late at night with one of my kids,

211
0:09:29.072,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and I saw something on Twitter

212
0:09:31.254,000 --> 0:09:33,000
about Tesla saying that they could solve

213
0:09:33.596,000 --> 0:09:35,000
South Australia's rolling series of power crises

214
0:09:36.247,000 --> 0:09:38,000
with one of their large industrial batteries.

215
0:09:39.138,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Without thinking, I fired off a bunch of tweets,

216
0:09:41.985,000 --> 0:09:44,000
challenging them and saying were they really serious about this.

217
0:09:45.74,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And in doing so, I managed to kick a very small rock

218
0:09:48.72,000 --> 0:09:49,000
off a very big hill

219
0:09:50.411,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that turned into an avalanche that I found myself tumbling in the middle of.

220
0:09:54.183,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Because you see, a few hours later, Elon tweeted me back and said

221
0:09:57.288,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that they were deadly serious,

222
0:09:58.891,000 --> 0:10:,000
that within a hundred days of contract signing,

223
0:10:01.136,000 --> 0:10:03,000
they could install a 100-megawatt-hour facility,

224
0:10:03.441,000 --> 0:10:05,000
which is a giant battery of a world-class size,

225
0:10:06.313,000 --> 0:10:08,000
one of the biggest ever made on the planet.

226
0:10:08.371,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And that's when all hell really broke loose.

227
0:10:11.176,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Within 24 hours, I had every major media outlet

228
0:10:14.155,000 --> 0:10:16,000
texting and emailing and trying to get in contact with me

229
0:10:16.914,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to get opinion as some sort of "expert" in energy.

230
0:10:19.606,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Laughter)

231
0:10:21.932,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Now, at the time, I couldn't really have told you the difference

232
0:10:26.005,000 --> 0:10:31,000
between a one-and-a-half-volt AA battery that goes in my kids' toys

233
0:10:31.294,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and a 100-megawatt-hour industrial-scale battery facility

234
0:10:34.657,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that goes in South Australia

235
0:10:36.055,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that could potentially solve their power crisis.

236
0:10:38.881,000 --> 0:10:4,000
I was now feeling a chronic case of impostor syndrome,

237
0:10:41.457,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Laughter)

238
0:10:42.52,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and it got truly bizarre.

239
0:10:44.586,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And I remember thinking to myself,

240
0:10:47.306,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"Shit. I've kind of started something here and I can't really get out.

241
0:10:51.485,000 --> 0:10:53,000
If I abandon the situation,

242
0:10:54.475,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I'm going to sort of set back renewables in Australia

243
0:10:57.342,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and maybe just look like a complete idiot

244
0:10:59.59,000 --> 0:11:01,000
because of my idiocy on Twitter."

245
0:11:02.127,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So I thought the only thing I could do

246
0:11:04.237,000 --> 0:11:06,000
was to try not to freeze and to try to learn.

247
0:11:06.703,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So I spent a week

248
0:11:08.342,000 --> 0:11:11,000
trying to learn everything I could about industrial-scale batteries

249
0:11:11.816,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and the electricity grid and renewables and the economics of all of this

250
0:11:15.286,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and whether this was even a feasible proposal.

251
0:11:17.663,000 --> 0:11:19,000
I talked to the chief scientist, I talked to the CSIRO,

252
0:11:20.491,000 --> 0:11:24,000
had multiple ministers and premiers trying to give me their side of the story

253
0:11:24.61,000 --> 0:11:25,000
from both sides of the aisle.

254
0:11:26.969,000 --> 0:11:28,000
I managed to exchange tweets with the prime minister.

255
0:11:29.531,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I even managed to pull off a passing impression, let's say,

256
0:11:33.136,000 --> 0:11:34,000
of an energy expert on ABC Lateline.

257
0:11:35.1,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Laughter)

258
0:11:37.57,000 --> 0:11:38,000
But as a result of all this,

259
0:11:39.204,000 --> 0:11:41,000
South Australia did put out a battery tender,

260
0:11:41.904,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and they had more than 90 applications for that battery tender.

261
0:11:45.825,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And the national conversation over a period of a few months

262
0:11:49.037,000 --> 0:11:52,000
moved from the sort of theatrical lumps of coal in the parliament

263
0:11:52.624,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to discussing kind of which industrial-scale battery chemistry

264
0:11:56.11,000 --> 0:11:59,000
was the best for building large-scale renewable batteries.

265
0:11:59.334,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So I think that the important lesson is by that time in my life,

266
0:12:02.703,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I knew well that I was an impostor.

267
0:12:04.966,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I knew I was miles out of my depth.

268
0:12:07.21,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But instead of freezing, I tried to learn as much as I could,

269
0:12:10.429,000 --> 0:12:13,000
motivated by my fear of generally looking like an idiot,

270
0:12:13.688,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and tried to turn that into some sort of a force for good.

271
0:12:18.442,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So one of the things I've learned

272
0:12:20.071,000 --> 0:12:25,000
is that people think successful people don't feel like frauds.

273
0:12:25.946,000 --> 0:12:27,000
But I think, especially knowing a lot of entrepreneurs,

274
0:12:28.543,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the opposite is more likely to be true.

275
0:12:31.881,000 --> 0:12:35,000
But the most successful people I know don't question themselves,

276
0:12:36.887,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but they do heavily question, regularly question, their ideas

277
0:12:40.402,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and their knowledge.

278
0:12:41.711,000 --> 0:12:44,000
They know when the water is way too deep,

279
0:12:45.15,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and they're not afraid to ask for advice.

280
0:12:47.217,000 --> 0:12:48,000
They don't see that as a bad thing.

281
0:12:48.931,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And they use that advice to hone those ideas, to improve them

282
0:12:52.033,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and to learn.

283
0:12:53.396,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And it's OK to be out of your depth sometimes.

284
0:12:56.081,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I'm frequently out of my depth.

285
0:12:57.644,000 --> 0:12:59,000
It's OK to be out of your depth.

286
0:12:59.703,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It's OK to be in a situation where you just can't push the eject button,

287
0:13:03.161,000 --> 0:13:05,000
so long as you don't freeze,

288
0:13:05.633,000 --> 0:13:07,000
so long as you harness the situation, don't be paralyzed

289
0:13:08.369,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and try to turn it into some sort of a force for good.

290
0:13:11.353,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And it's important that I say "harness" here,

291
0:13:13.764,000 --> 0:13:15,000
because this isn't sort of pop-psychology BS

292
0:13:16.291,000 --> 0:13:18,000
about conquering impostor syndrome for me.

293
0:13:18.543,000 --> 0:13:19,000
It's merely about being aware of it.

294
0:13:20.904,000 --> 0:13:23,000
In fact, I'm extremely aware of feeling like an impostor right now,

295
0:13:24.903,000 --> 0:13:26,000
as I'm up here, some sort of pseudo-expert

296
0:13:27.427,000 --> 0:13:3,000
on a feeling that I couldn't even put a name to a few months ago,

297
0:13:30.624,000 --> 0:13:32,000
when I agreed to do this talk.

298
0:13:32.919,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Which, if you think about it, is kind of the point, isn't it?

299
0:13:36.172,000 --> 0:13:37,000
(Laughter)

300
0:13:37.236,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Thank you.

301
0:13:38.473,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:14.46,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'd like to introduce you to my mom.

2
0:00:18.86,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:20.74,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm guessing that's not what you expected,

4
0:00:23.86,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and it's not what I expected either,

5
0:00:25.86,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and thank goodness I realized that an Asian man was not my mom

6
0:00:30.34,000 --> 0:00:32,000
before I hugged him,

7
0:00:32.46,000 --> 0:00:34,000
because that would have been so awkward.

8
0:00:36.62,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Recognizing people isn't one of my strengths

9
0:00:39.7,000 --> 0:00:43,000
due to a genetic visual impairment that has no correction or cure.

10
0:00:44.579,000 --> 0:00:46,000
As a result, I am legally blind,

11
0:00:47.54,000 --> 0:00:5,000
though I prefer "partially sighted" because it's more optimistic.

12
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:52.9,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And I'm entitled to the label "disabled."

14
0:00:58.42,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I hate the word disabled when it's used to describe people.

15
0:01:02.94,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It detonates a mindset of less than

16
0:01:07.18,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that utterly disregards capacity,

17
0:01:10.1,000 --> 0:01:11,000
ability, potential,

18
0:01:12.74,000 --> 0:01:15,000
instead prioritizing brokenness

19
0:01:16.62,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and lack.

20
0:01:19.34,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The perspective can be overt.

21
0:01:23.14,000 --> 0:01:26,000
What can't he do for himself that I'm going to have to do for him?

22
0:01:27.46,000 --> 0:01:29,000
She'll probably need some accommodation

23
0:01:29.58,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that no other employee at this business needs.

24
0:01:33.42,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Sometimes, the hidden bias

25
0:01:36.94,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is so sweetly conveyed.

26
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
"Wow, Susan,

27
0:01:42.82,000 --> 0:01:45,000
look at everything you've done in your career and your life.

28
0:01:47.3,000 --> 0:01:51,000
How did you do all of that and be visually impaired?"

29
0:01:51.7,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:56.3,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I fail at being disabled.

31
0:01:59.14,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

32
0:02:00.54,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So in the spirit of incentivizing the rampant failure

33
0:02:03.9,000 --> 0:02:05,000
of people all over the world

34
0:02:06.22,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and enticing the so-called normal to just give it a rest already,

35
0:02:11.78,000 --> 0:02:12,000
here are five tips

36
0:02:13.74,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to fail at being disabled.

37
0:02:17.94,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Tip one:

38
0:02:19.38,000 --> 0:02:2,000
know your superpowers.

39
0:02:21.459,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The best team I ever led in my career

40
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
was based on superpowers,

41
0:02:26.3,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and we even gave ourselves fancy-pantsy titles

42
0:02:28.98,000 --> 0:02:31,000
like "the Pillar of Masterly Acumen."

43
0:02:33.42,000 --> 0:02:34,000
"The Biscuit Butterer."

44
0:02:35.3,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:36.94,000 --> 0:02:37,000
"The Voice of Reason."

46
0:02:39.18,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Because we relied on our strengths,

47
0:02:41.98,000 --> 0:02:43,000
our best strengths,

48
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
we achieved tremendous outcomes.

49
0:02:48.46,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The trait that prevents me from recognizing my mom

50
0:02:51.78,000 --> 0:02:53,000
allows me to smoothly adapt,

51
0:02:54.66,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to quickly absorb and accurately process an exhausting volume of cues,

52
0:03:00.5,000 --> 0:03:01,000
tease out what's important,

53
0:03:02.42,000 --> 0:03:07,000
determine multiple processes or potentials for any situation that I'm in,

54
0:03:07.5,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and then select the one that makes the most sense,

55
0:03:11.5,000 --> 0:03:12,000
all in a matter of seconds.

56
0:03:14.06,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I see what other people do not.

57
0:03:17.86,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Some people think that's a superpower,

58
0:03:20.62,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but my real superpowers

59
0:03:23.14,000 --> 0:03:25,000
are ricocheting off of glass walls --

60
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:26.78,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and letting my friends walk around with kale in their teeth.

62
0:03:29.94,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It's true. Don't have lunch with me,

64
0:03:37.14,000 --> 0:03:38,000
or dinner.

65
0:03:39.58,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Tip two: be supremely skilled,

66
0:03:43.58,000 --> 0:03:45,000
supremely skilled at getting it wrong.

67
0:03:47.3,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It is important to be as equally confident in your superpowers

68
0:03:51.1,000 --> 0:03:53,000
as you are in you FUBARs.

69
0:03:54.46,000 --> 0:03:56,000
That's "effed up beyond all recognition"

70
0:03:57.02,000 --> 0:03:58,000
for you millennials.

71
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:59.74,000 --> 0:04:,000
Here's a good example.

73
0:04:02.06,000 --> 0:04:05,000
It is not a great idea to say,

74
0:04:05.98,000 --> 0:04:08,000
"Don't worry, everything in here is too small for me to see"

75
0:04:10.78,000 --> 0:04:13,000
when you accidentally walk into the men's room --

76
0:04:14.58,000 --> 0:04:19,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:20.5,000 --> 0:04:24,000
at one of the world's largest sporting arenas --

78
0:04:24.82,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:27.58,000 --> 0:04:29,000
or anywhere.

80
0:04:29.7,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I really wish that one wasn't true.

81
0:04:33.54,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I'm serious. It is better to just walk out and let them think you're drunk.

82
0:04:38.02,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:39.94,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Tip three: know that everyone is disabled in some way,

84
0:04:44.9,000 --> 0:04:46,000
like when you have a cold and you can't smell

85
0:04:47.22,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and you realize that the milk that you splashed in your coffee was sour

86
0:04:50.62,000 --> 0:04:51,000
only after you've tasted it.

87
0:04:53.74,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Very recently, a woman walked up to me frantic.

88
0:04:57.14,000 --> 0:04:59,000
She could not find the bakery she was looking for.

89
0:05:00.7,000 --> 0:05:02,000
As I motioned in the direction I thought she should go,

90
0:05:03.34,000 --> 0:05:05,000
saying, "There are no stores on this side of the street

91
0:05:06.3,000 --> 0:05:08,000
so your best bet is to cross --"

92
0:05:08.34,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"Oh my goodness," she interrupted.

93
0:05:11.74,000 --> 0:05:12,000
"There it is.

94
0:05:13.58,000 --> 0:05:15,000
All I needed was another set of eyes."

95
0:05:16.5,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Laughter)

96
0:05:21.86,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I just let her have it.

97
0:05:24.74,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I would have said that, you know,

98
0:05:27.94,000 --> 0:05:29,000
being logical and paying attention

99
0:05:30.66,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and staying calm would have done the trick,

100
0:05:33.62,000 --> 0:05:34,000
but who am I?

101
0:05:36.06,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Tip four: point out the disability in others.

102
0:05:40.9,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This one is best reserved -- very important note --

103
0:05:43.34,000 --> 0:05:45,000
this one is best reserved for people you know well,

104
0:05:46.06,000 --> 0:05:49,000
because random strangers typically don't appreciate

105
0:05:50.54,000 --> 0:05:51,000
teachable moments.

106
0:05:52.66,000 --> 0:05:55,000
A few years ago, my parents and I went to see the Rockettes,

107
0:05:56.34,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Radio City's high-kicking dancers.

108
0:05:59.86,000 --> 0:06:,000
I leaned over to my dad.

109
0:06:02.58,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"The two Rockettes on the left aren't kicking in a straight line."

110
0:06:07.62,000 --> 0:06:08,000
"Yes, they are."

111
0:06:09.62,000 --> 0:06:1,000
"No, they're not."

112
0:06:11.94,000 --> 0:06:12,000
"Yes, they are, and how do you know?

113
0:06:13.7,000 --> 0:06:14,000
You can't see."

114
0:06:15.7,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But I know what a straight line looks like.

115
0:06:19.7,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I had snapped a picture during our back and forth

116
0:06:22.38,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and presented him the evidence that proved I was right.

117
0:06:26.66,000 --> 0:06:27,000
He looked at the picture.

118
0:06:28.66,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I leaned in further.

119
0:06:30.66,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"Who's disabled now?"

120
0:06:34.34,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Tip five: pursue audacious goals.

121
0:06:38.34,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Flip expectation upside down

122
0:06:40.78,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and shove limitation off a cliff to meet its demise.

123
0:06:45.74,000 --> 0:06:47,000
There is a college football linebacker

124
0:06:47.78,000 --> 0:06:5,000
who blitzes, tackles, recovers fumbles

125
0:06:51.06,000 --> 0:06:52,000
while having one hand.

126
0:06:53.3,000 --> 0:06:56,000
There is a teacher who successfully transfers knowledge

127
0:06:56.46,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and inspires countless students

128
0:06:59.54,000 --> 0:07:,000
while living with Down syndrome.

129
0:07:02.1,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And for me,

130
0:07:04.06,000 --> 0:07:05,000
on my long list,

131
0:07:05.98,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to cycle from Kathmandu, Nepal, to Darjeeling, India

132
0:07:09.86,000 --> 0:07:11,000
on the backseat of a bicycle built for two.

133
0:07:13.62,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It will be an exciting 620-mile adventure,

134
0:07:18.46,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and I'm sure I will have the blurry photos to show for it.

135
0:07:22.14,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

136
0:07:23.98,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Oh, before we go on, I forgot to introduce you to my mom.

137
0:07:27.3,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I need to do that.

138
0:07:30.18,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And here she is,

139
0:07:31.58,000 --> 0:07:33,000
as she would appear to me

140
0:07:33.66,000 --> 0:07:35,000
if I were looking through a crowd of people looking for her.

141
0:07:37.62,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Or is that an Asian man?

142
0:07:40.66,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Thank you.

143
0:07:41.9,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Applause)

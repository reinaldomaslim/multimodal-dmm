1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In 2015, we saw two fantastic, hopeful breakthroughs for humanity.

2
0:00:17.917,000 --> 0:00:2,000
First, the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals,

3
0:00:21.139,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the collective, universal plan for humanity

4
0:00:24.157,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to eradicate hunger,

5
0:00:25.485,000 --> 0:00:27,000
[promote] good economic development and good health,

6
0:00:27.985,000 --> 0:00:28,000
within global environmental targets.

7
0:00:29.747,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Secondly, after 21 years of negotiations,

8
0:00:32.64,000 --> 0:00:35,000
we adopted the legally binding Paris Agreement,

9
0:00:35.714,000 --> 0:00:38,000
all nations in the world keeping global warming under two degrees Celsius,

10
0:00:39.291,000 --> 0:00:41,000
aiming at 1.5 degrees Celsius.

11
0:00:41.576,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Today, three years down the line, we're still in the hand-waving business.

12
0:00:47.745,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Now, I think it's time to step back one step

13
0:00:50.394,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and recognize that I wonder if the world leaders really knew what they signed

14
0:00:54.904,000 --> 0:00:56,000
at the General Assembly three years ago.

15
0:00:57.519,000 --> 0:01:,000
These are universal, aspirational, transformational goals

16
0:01:00.926,000 --> 0:01:04,000
for inclusive, prosperous humanity on a stable earth system.

17
0:01:05.909,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But there are underlying problems.

18
0:01:07.964,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We have inherent contradictions between these goals,

19
0:01:11.193,000 --> 0:01:15,000
where there's the risk of pursuing one favored goal at the expense of others.

20
0:01:16.084,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Take, for example, Goal 8, on decent work and economic growth.

21
0:01:19.444,000 --> 0:01:21,000
If we continue doing that by exploiting natural resources

22
0:01:22.164,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and burning fossil fuels,

23
0:01:23.404,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it will be impossible to reach Goal 13.

24
0:01:26.466,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Three years down the line, we simply must admit

25
0:01:29.006,000 --> 0:01:33,000
we're seeing limited action to really, really address this

26
0:01:33.187,000 --> 0:01:36,000
as an inclusive, collective, universal package.

27
0:01:37.143,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Now, this requires us to step back one step.

28
0:01:40.486,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I think we have to ask ourselves some hard questions:

29
0:01:43.196,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Do we have any chance of accomplishing the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030?

30
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Are there actually inherent trade-offs

31
0:01:50.951,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that are not compatible with our current development paradigm?

32
0:01:55.369,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But are there, perhaps, synergies where we can really accelerate change?

33
0:01:58.836,000 --> 0:02:,000
And is it really a people-planet agenda,

34
0:02:01.032,000 --> 0:02:06,000
really taking seriously the social and economic aspirational goals

35
0:02:06.624,000 --> 0:02:09,000
within the life-support systems on earth?

36
0:02:10.755,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Now, citizens across the world have started to recognize

37
0:02:13.536,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that we're facing global rising environmental risks;

38
0:02:16.607,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in fact, that a stable planet is a prerequisite

39
0:02:19.588,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to have good human well-being on earth.

40
0:02:22.642,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We need to define a safe operating space on a stable earth system,

41
0:02:27.143,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and the planetary boundary framework was introduced

42
0:02:30.021,000 --> 0:02:32,000
by the scientific community in 2009

43
0:02:32.146,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to do exactly that.

44
0:02:34.393,000 --> 0:02:36,000
It has now been widely embraced across the world

45
0:02:37.283,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in policy, business and communities

46
0:02:39.658,000 --> 0:02:41,000
as a framework for sustainable development

47
0:02:42.012,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in the Anthropocene.

48
0:02:43.387,000 --> 0:02:49,000
This slide really shows the framework with the nine environmental processes

49
0:02:49.459,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that regulate the stability of the earth system,

50
0:02:51.799,000 --> 0:02:52,000
providing a safe operating space,

51
0:02:53.625,000 --> 0:02:56,000
where we'll have a high chance of having good human well-being

52
0:02:57.056,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and prosperity and equity.

53
0:02:58.587,000 --> 0:03:02,000
If we move into the yellow zone, we enter a dangerous uncertainty zone;

54
0:03:02.962,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and into the red, we have a high likelihood of crossing tipping points

55
0:03:06.443,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that could take us irreversibly away from the ability of the earth system

56
0:03:10.515,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to provide social and economic well-being for humanity.

57
0:03:15.295,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Now, we can today, scientifically, quantify these boundaries,

58
0:03:20.137,000 --> 0:03:23,000
providing us a stable earth system for humanity.

59
0:03:24.192,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But we have to go beyond this

60
0:03:25.949,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and recognize the Sustainable Development Goals --

61
0:03:28.311,000 --> 0:03:3,000
if we really want to seriously accomplish them --

62
0:03:30.658,000 --> 0:03:33,000
must now occur within this safe operating space.

63
0:03:33.922,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We need to achieve SDGs within PBs.

64
0:03:38.159,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But dear friends, not even this is enough.

65
0:03:41.145,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We need to recognize that the Sustainable Development Goals

66
0:03:43.979,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is 12 years away.

67
0:03:45.495,000 --> 0:03:46,000
It's only a milestone.

68
0:03:47.207,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It is the bull's-eye that we need to go through

69
0:03:50.185,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and zoom ourselves towards transformations

70
0:03:53.108,000 --> 0:03:56,000
where we can have a good future for all co-citizens on earth,

71
0:03:56.858,000 --> 0:03:57,000
nine billion plus,

72
0:03:58.147,000 --> 0:04:01,000
within a stable earth system in 2050 and beyond.

73
0:04:02.405,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This is a quest,

74
0:04:04.213,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and in order to really explore this and not have only opinions about it,

75
0:04:07.775,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we gathered the scientific community, the best thinkers and modelers

76
0:04:11.111,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and started to develop a completely new complex systems dynamic model,

77
0:04:14.957,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the Earth-3 model,

78
0:04:16.147,000 --> 0:04:2,000
building on models that have been around for the last 50 years.

79
0:04:20.815,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And here it is.

80
0:04:22.989,000 --> 0:04:24,000
This is a fantastic piece of work.

81
0:04:25.125,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This has a climate module, a biosphere module, a global economic model;

82
0:04:29.252,000 --> 0:04:34,000
it has algorithms, it has the whole room of fantastic accomplishments.

83
0:04:34.366,000 --> 0:04:36,000
This is what turns us scientists on.

84
0:04:36.551,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:37.637,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I mean, this is just a beautiful piece of work?

86
0:04:39.884,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And I'd just love to spend the whole evening walking this through with you,

87
0:04:43.714,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but I'll make you disappointed.

88
0:04:45.682,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I cannot do that.

89
0:04:47.276,000 --> 0:04:5,000
In fact, the only thing I can do with you is just to assure you

90
0:04:50.515,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that this is the first time it's done.

91
0:04:52.786,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Nobody has ever tried to really analytically combine

92
0:04:55.817,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the Sustainable Development Goals with planetary boundaries.

93
0:04:58.704,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And we were able to find patterns and really convergent trends

94
0:05:04.097,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to now project

95
0:05:08.09,000 --> 0:05:09,000
economic development,

96
0:05:09.435,000 --> 0:05:12,000
resources use from water, food and energy,

97
0:05:12.513,000 --> 0:05:14,000
population growth, income per person,

98
0:05:14.888,000 --> 0:05:17,000
yet along these consistent and systemic pathways.

99
0:05:18.683,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So, it's the first time we have a robust opportunity

100
0:05:21.529,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to really explore the futures of ability of attaining the SDGs within PBs.

101
0:05:26.538,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Now, how do we do this?

102
0:05:27.746,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Well, look at this.

103
0:05:28.926,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Here, you have the data coming from the real world,

104
0:05:32.175,000 --> 0:05:34,000
calibrated from 1970-2015:

105
0:05:34.803,000 --> 0:05:36,000
100,000 data points around the world,

106
0:05:37.47,000 --> 0:05:39,000
building on seven regions' ability,

107
0:05:40.05,000 --> 0:05:42,000
of really picking on all these Sustainable Development Goals.

108
0:05:43.063,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Now, one example of how we calibrated this,

109
0:05:45.099,000 --> 0:05:47,000
here you have [data] for Sustainable Development Goals

110
0:05:47.88,000 --> 0:05:5,000
on eradicating poverty, health, education and food.

111
0:05:51.441,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And here you have in the bubbles the seven regions of the world,

112
0:05:55.436,000 --> 0:05:59,000
how they move up until 2015 in our empirical observations

113
0:05:59.887,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in relation to GDP per capita,

114
0:06:02.088,000 --> 0:06:04,000
giving these universal convergent trends,

115
0:06:04.693,000 --> 0:06:07,000
which enabled us to create regressions

116
0:06:07.802,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that could make us able to do simulations into the future,

117
0:06:11.481,000 --> 0:06:12,000
all the way until 2050,

118
0:06:13.462,000 --> 0:06:17,000
showing the ability along the lines here to attain the SDGs.

119
0:06:18.734,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Now, this gave us the opportunity of doing several scenarios,

120
0:06:23.391,000 --> 0:06:25,000
testing different possible futures:

121
0:06:25.93,000 --> 0:06:27,000
business as usual, global transformations,

122
0:06:28.509,000 --> 0:06:31,000
investment schemes in business, different governance options,

123
0:06:31.902,000 --> 0:06:33,000
policies, finance --

124
0:06:34.199,000 --> 0:06:37,000
really, to explore what the future can look like

125
0:06:37.369,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in our ability to attain the SDGs within PBs.

126
0:06:40.659,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And the results, I can tell you, really surprised us.

127
0:06:43.786,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And this will be the first time it's shown.

128
0:06:45.868,000 --> 0:06:48,000
It should actually not even be referenced outside of this room.

129
0:06:49.045,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Now, it actually is presented along two axes.

130
0:06:52.853,000 --> 0:06:55,000
The y-axis here shows our ability to stay within planetary boundaries.

131
0:06:56.831,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The higher up, the closer you are to the safe operating space.

132
0:07:00.632,000 --> 0:07:02,000
On the x-axis are the Sustainable Development Goals;

133
0:07:03.178,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the further to the right, the more of the SDGs we fulfill.

134
0:07:06.327,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We all want to be in the upper right-hand corner,

135
0:07:08.769,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the safe and just world for the future.

136
0:07:11.808,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now, the point you see there is 1980.

137
0:07:14.309,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We were in a situation where we actually were in a safe operating space

138
0:07:17.807,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but not meeting so many of the SDGs.

139
0:07:19.935,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Here's the trend up until 2015.

140
0:07:22.931,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So this is the conventional world,

141
0:07:24.781,000 --> 0:07:27,000
which is actually delivering on an increasing number of SDGs,

142
0:07:27.92,000 --> 0:07:29,000
lifting millions of people out of poverty,

143
0:07:30.152,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but doing it at the expense of the safe operating space on earth.

144
0:07:35.327,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now, this is the scenario business as usual, into the future.

145
0:07:38.876,000 --> 0:07:39,000
If we just move on as today,

146
0:07:40.754,000 --> 0:07:42,000
we will be able to deliver on some of the SDGs,

147
0:07:43.545,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but we'll do it at the expense of the stability of the earth system.

148
0:07:48.061,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Now, what if we go faster on economic growth

149
0:07:50.799,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and really ally on one percent increase per year of income

150
0:07:55.747,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and an even tripling of the world economy by 2050?

151
0:07:59.131,000 --> 0:08:01,000
That would give us the following trajectory.

152
0:08:01.371,000 --> 0:08:04,000
We would, yes, go a little bit further on SDG accomplishments,

153
0:08:05.214,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but still at the expense of the risk of destabilizing the planet.

154
0:08:10.119,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But what if we really go harder?

155
0:08:12.143,000 --> 0:08:16,000
What if we increase our ability to deliver on our promises by 30 percent

156
0:08:16.868,000 --> 0:08:18,000
across all sectors in society,

157
0:08:19.534,000 --> 0:08:22,000
from climate to our trade agreements?

158
0:08:23.188,000 --> 0:08:27,000
A harder scenario would take us a little bit better,

159
0:08:27.452,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but still, we're failing on the SDGs,

160
0:08:30.447,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and we are not accomplishing a safe operating space for humanity.

161
0:08:34.458,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So this really led us to a quite disappointing conclusion,

162
0:08:39.008,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that we will actually, even if we go conventional futures, fail on the SDGs

163
0:08:44.481,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and transgress planetary boundaries.

164
0:08:46.469,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We need some radical thinking.

165
0:08:47.965,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We need to go into a transformative, disruptive future,

166
0:08:52.061,000 --> 0:08:55,000
where we start thinking outside of the box.

167
0:08:55.179,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The modeling and engagement and dialogues enable us to identify

168
0:08:58.548,000 --> 0:09:01,000
five transformations that could actually potentially take us there.

169
0:09:02.554,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The first one is to cut emissions by half every decade

170
0:09:05.796,000 --> 0:09:07,000
along the scientific pathway to Paris,

171
0:09:08.086,000 --> 0:09:1,000
doubling investments in renewable energy,

172
0:09:10.532,000 --> 0:09:12,000
creating a global energy democracy,

173
0:09:12.969,000 --> 0:09:14,000
allowing us to meet several of the SDGs.

174
0:09:16.157,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The second is a rapid shift towards sustainable food systems,

175
0:09:20.956,000 --> 0:09:23,000
investing one percent per year in sustainable intensification

176
0:09:24.852,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and really moving towards implementing and investing in solutions

177
0:09:27.995,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that we already have available today.

178
0:09:31.286,000 --> 0:09:34,000
The third is really to shift our development paradigm

179
0:09:35.258,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and learn from many of the developing countries

180
0:09:37.52,000 --> 0:09:38,000
that have moved very fast.

181
0:09:38.803,000 --> 0:09:41,000
What if we could have an economic growth such as in China,

182
0:09:42.176,000 --> 0:09:45,000
while doing it within the environmental parameters

183
0:09:45.223,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of an ecological civilization?

184
0:09:47.889,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Fourth, a redistribution of wealth.

185
0:09:50.535,000 --> 0:09:53,000
What if we could [agree] that the richest 10 percent

186
0:09:53.637,000 --> 0:09:56,000
could not allow themselves to amass more than 40 percent, maximum,

187
0:09:56.901,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of national incomes --

188
0:09:58.09,000 --> 0:10:,000
a drastic redistribution of wealth,

189
0:10:00.246,000 --> 0:10:03,000
reforming the ability of equity across regions?

190
0:10:03.844,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And finally, fifth, a radical increase in more education, health,

191
0:10:07.663,000 --> 0:10:08,000
access to work, contraception,

192
0:10:09.22,000 --> 0:10:12,000
investing largely in women across the world,

193
0:10:12.529,000 --> 0:10:16,000
allowing us to deliver on SDGs on gender, inequality,

194
0:10:17.529,000 --> 0:10:19,000
economics and urban development.

195
0:10:20.038,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Now, if we would push ourselves across all these five --

196
0:10:23.945,000 --> 0:10:28,000
we tested this, and it would give us an amazing journey

197
0:10:29.112,000 --> 0:10:32,000
towards the safe and just operating space on earth.

198
0:10:33.445,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It shows us that even with a conservative, empirically based,

199
0:10:37.676,000 --> 0:10:38,000
complex system dynamics model,

200
0:10:39.472,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we are at a state where we can actually think of transformations

201
0:10:43.487,000 --> 0:10:44,000
over the next 12 years and beyond

202
0:10:45.427,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that can take us up into the safe operating space

203
0:10:48.656,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and deliver on aspirational social and economic goals.

204
0:10:52.598,000 --> 0:10:54,000
This is actually quite uplifting,

205
0:10:55.323,000 --> 0:10:58,000
despite the fact that we're not moving along this trajectory.

206
0:10:58.656,000 --> 0:10:59,000
So, in summary:

207
0:11:00.087,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we now, three years into the operational delivery on the SDGs,

208
0:11:04.272,000 --> 0:11:06,000
must draw a line

209
0:11:06.403,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and conclude that we're not delivering on our promises,

210
0:11:09.899,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and not only that, we're running the risks

211
0:11:12.395,000 --> 0:11:15,000
of future generations having an even tougher ability,

212
0:11:15.746,000 --> 0:11:18,000
because of the risk of pushing the earth system beyond tipping points.

213
0:11:19.413,000 --> 0:11:22,000
In fact, we are facing even a risk of a hothouse earth,

214
0:11:23.254,000 --> 0:11:26,000
where we will undermine and create geopolitical instabilities

215
0:11:26.889,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that could actually make life even more tough

216
0:11:29.232,000 --> 0:11:31,000
for billions of people on earth.

217
0:11:31.67,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This, in all honesty, really, really scares me.

218
0:11:35.998,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But that's also why I'm standing here tonight,

219
0:11:38.6,000 --> 0:11:41,000
because the window of success is still open.

220
0:11:41.742,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The earth system is still resilient.

221
0:11:44.207,000 --> 0:11:47,000
She is still providing us with ecosystem services and functions

222
0:11:48.062,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that can allow us a transition back into a safe operating space.

223
0:11:51.456,000 --> 0:11:53,000
But we need radically different thinking.

224
0:11:54.042,000 --> 0:11:57,000
We need to see this as an incredible wake-up call

225
0:11:58.029,000 --> 0:12:,000
but also an opportunity for transformative change,

226
0:12:00.808,000 --> 0:12:01,000
where we shift gears

227
0:12:02.132,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and really start thinking of the SDGs as a transformative agenda

228
0:12:05.607,000 --> 0:12:07,000
within a safe operating space on earth.

229
0:12:07.936,000 --> 0:12:11,000
In other words, we can build a safe and just world.

230
0:12:12.192,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We just have to really, really get on with it.

231
0:12:15.222,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And let's do it. Thank you.

232
0:12:17.069,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.603,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I know a man who soars above the city every night.

2
0:00:18.465,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In his dreams, he twirls and swirls

3
0:00:21.459,000 --> 0:00:23,000
with his toes kissing the Earth.

4
0:00:24.326,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Everything has motion, he claims,

5
0:00:27.14,000 --> 0:00:31,000
even a body as paralyzed as his own.

6
0:00:31.982,000 --> 0:00:35,000
This man is my father.

7
0:00:36.812,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Three years ago, when I found out

8
0:00:38.713,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that my father had suffered a severe stroke

9
0:00:41.3,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in his brain stem,

10
0:00:43.426,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I walked into his room in the ICU

11
0:00:46.9,000 --> 0:00:48,000
at the Montreal Neurological Institute

12
0:00:49.884,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and found him lying deathly still,

13
0:00:52.527,000 --> 0:00:54,000
tethered to a breathing machine.

14
0:00:55.463,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Paralysis had closed over his body slowly,

15
0:00:59.894,000 --> 0:01:01,000
beginning in his toes, then legs,

16
0:01:01.965,000 --> 0:01:03,000
torso, fingers and arms.

17
0:01:04.495,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It made its way up his neck,

18
0:01:06.7,000 --> 0:01:08,000
cutting off his ability to breathe,

19
0:01:08.905,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and stopped just beneath the eyes.

20
0:01:13.382,000 --> 0:01:15,000
He never lost consciousness.

21
0:01:15.553,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Rather, he watched from within

22
0:01:18.14,000 --> 0:01:2,000
as his body shut down,

23
0:01:20.446,000 --> 0:01:22,000
limb by limb,

24
0:01:22.583,000 --> 0:01:24,000
muscle by muscle.

25
0:01:25.542,000 --> 0:01:29,000
In that ICU room, I walked up to my father's body,

26
0:01:30.1,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and with a quivering voice and through tears,

27
0:01:33.699,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I began reciting the alphabet.

28
0:01:37.112,000 --> 0:01:42,000
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

29
0:01:43.01,000 --> 0:01:47,000
H, I, J, K.

30
0:01:47.14,000 --> 0:01:49,000
At K, he blinked his eyes.

31
0:01:50.092,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I began again.

32
0:01:52.246,000 --> 0:01:56,000
A, B, C, D, E, F, G,

33
0:01:56.74,000 --> 0:01:58,000
H, I.

34
0:01:58.75,000 --> 0:02:01,000
He blinked again at the letter I,

35
0:02:01.888,000 --> 0:02:04,000
then at T, then at R, and A:

36
0:02:05.88,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Kitra.

37
0:02:07.727,000 --> 0:02:1,000
He said "Kitra, my beauty, don't cry.

38
0:02:11.685,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is a blessing."

39
0:02:16.14,000 --> 0:02:18,000
There was no audible voice, but my father

40
0:02:18.795,000 --> 0:02:21,000
called out my name powerfully.

41
0:02:21.843,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Just 72 hours after his stroke,

42
0:02:24.935,000 --> 0:02:25,000
he had already embraced

43
0:02:26.69,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the totality of his condition.

44
0:02:30.165,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Despite his extreme physical state,

45
0:02:32.665,000 --> 0:02:34,000
he was completely present with me,

46
0:02:35.621,000 --> 0:02:37,000
guiding, nurturing,

47
0:02:38.253,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and being my father as much

48
0:02:40.503,000 --> 0:02:43,000
if not more than ever before.

49
0:02:43.739,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Locked-in syndrome

50
0:02:45.302,000 --> 0:02:48,000
is many people's worst nightmare.

51
0:02:48.703,000 --> 0:02:5,000
In French, it's sometimes called

52
0:02:51.111,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"maladie de l'emmuré vivant."

53
0:02:53.191,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Literally, "walled-in-alive disease."

54
0:02:58.512,000 --> 0:02:59,000
For many people, perhaps most,

55
0:03:00.267,000 --> 0:03:03,000
paralysis is an unspeakable horror,

56
0:03:03.799,000 --> 0:03:05,000
but my father's experience

57
0:03:06.14,000 --> 0:03:08,000
losing every system of his body

58
0:03:08.511,000 --> 0:03:11,000
was not an experience of feeling trapped,

59
0:03:11.572,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but rather of turning the psyche inwards,

60
0:03:15.733,000 --> 0:03:18,000
dimming down the external chatter,

61
0:03:18.928,000 --> 0:03:2,000
facing the recesses of his own mind,

62
0:03:21.853,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and in that place,

63
0:03:23.69,000 --> 0:03:27,000
falling in love with life and body anew.

64
0:03:28.47,000 --> 0:03:3,000
As a rabbi and spiritual man

65
0:03:31.166,000 --> 0:03:35,000
dangling between mind and body, life and death,

66
0:03:35.28,000 --> 0:03:39,000
the paralysis opened up a new awareness for him.

67
0:03:39.807,000 --> 0:03:41,000
He realized he no longer needed to look

68
0:03:42.221,000 --> 0:03:45,000
beyond the corporeal world

69
0:03:45.25,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in order to find the divine.

70
0:03:48.499,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"Paradise is in this body.

71
0:03:52.388,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It's in this world," he said.

72
0:03:56.15,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I slept by my father's side for the first four months,

73
0:04:00.006,000 --> 0:04:02,000
tending as much as I could

74
0:04:02.12,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to his every discomfort,

75
0:04:04.765,000 --> 0:04:07,000
understanding the deep human psychological fear

76
0:04:08.115,000 --> 0:04:11,000
of not being able to call out for help.

77
0:04:11.6,000 --> 0:04:14,000
My mother, sisters, brother and I,

78
0:04:15.326,000 --> 0:04:19,000
we surrounded him in a cocoon of healing.

79
0:04:19.69,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We became his mouthpiece,

80
0:04:21.79,000 --> 0:04:24,000
spending hours each day reciting the alphabet

81
0:04:25.619,000 --> 0:04:27,000
as he whispered back sermons

82
0:04:27.981,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and poetry with blinks of his eye.

83
0:04:31.65,000 --> 0:04:36,000
His room, it became our temple of healing.

84
0:04:37.104,000 --> 0:04:39,000
His bedside became a site for those

85
0:04:39.826,000 --> 0:04:43,000
seeking advice and spiritual counsel, and through us,

86
0:04:43.911,000 --> 0:04:45,000
my father was able to speak

87
0:04:46.451,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and uplift,

88
0:04:48.645,000 --> 0:04:49,000
letter by letter,

89
0:04:50.636,000 --> 0:04:52,000
blink by blink.

90
0:04:53.1,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Everything in our world became slow and tender

91
0:04:56.992,000 --> 0:04:59,000
as the din, drama and death of the hospital ward

92
0:05:00.356,000 --> 0:05:03,000
faded into the background.

93
0:05:03.86,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I want to read to you one of the first things

94
0:05:05.96,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that we transcribed in the week following the stroke.

95
0:05:10.201,000 --> 0:05:12,000
He composed a letter,

96
0:05:12.581,000 --> 0:05:14,000
addressing his synagogue congregation,

97
0:05:15.202,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and ended it with the following lines:

98
0:05:18.711,000 --> 0:05:2,000
"When my nape exploded,

99
0:05:21.19,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I entered another dimension:

100
0:05:23.953,000 --> 0:05:27,000
inchoate, sub-planetary, protozoan.

101
0:05:28.61,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Universes are opened and closed continually.

102
0:05:33.199,000 --> 0:05:35,000
There are many when low,

103
0:05:35.258,000 --> 0:05:37,000
who stop growing.

104
0:05:37.463,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Last week, I was brought so low,

105
0:05:39.567,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but I felt the hand of my father around me,

106
0:05:43.002,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and my father brought me back."

107
0:05:46.422,000 --> 0:05:48,000
When we weren't his voice,

108
0:05:48.667,000 --> 0:05:51,000
we were his legs and arms.

109
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I moved them like I know I would have wanted

110
0:05:54.652,000 --> 0:05:56,000
my own arms and legs to be moved

111
0:05:57.249,000 --> 0:06:,000
were they still for all the hours of the day.

112
0:06:01.141,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I remember I'd hold his fingers near my face,

113
0:06:05.124,000 --> 0:06:09,000
bending each joint to keep it soft and limber.

114
0:06:09.41,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I'd ask him again and again

115
0:06:11.761,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to visualize the motion,

116
0:06:14.258,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to watch from within as the finger curled

117
0:06:17.779,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and extended, and to move along with it

118
0:06:21.851,000 --> 0:06:23,000
in his mind.

119
0:06:24.562,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Then, one day, from the corner of my eye,

120
0:06:26.575,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I saw his body slither like a snake,

121
0:06:30.298,000 --> 0:06:33,000
an involuntary spasm passing through the course

122
0:06:33.603,000 --> 0:06:35,000
of his limbs.

123
0:06:35.89,000 --> 0:06:37,000
At first, I thought it was my own hallucination,

124
0:06:38.105,000 --> 0:06:41,000
having spent so much time tending to this one body,

125
0:06:41.66,000 --> 0:06:45,000
so desperate to see anything react on its own.

126
0:06:46.32,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But he told me he felt tingles,

127
0:06:48.98,000 --> 0:06:51,000
sparks of electricity flickering on and off

128
0:06:52.515,000 --> 0:06:55,000
just beneath the surface of the skin.

129
0:06:56.272,000 --> 0:06:59,000
The following week, he began ever so slightly

130
0:06:59.579,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to show muscle resistance.

131
0:07:02.335,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Connections were being made.

132
0:07:04.94,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Body was slowly and gently reawakening,

133
0:07:10.164,000 --> 0:07:13,000
limb by limb, muscle by muscle,

134
0:07:13.71,000 --> 0:07:15,000
twitch by twitch.

135
0:07:16.641,000 --> 0:07:18,000
As a documentary photographer,

136
0:07:19.278,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I felt the need to photograph

137
0:07:21.08,000 --> 0:07:23,000
each of his first movements

138
0:07:23.28,000 --> 0:07:25,000
like a mother with her newborn.

139
0:07:25.93,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I photographed him taking his first unaided breath,

140
0:07:30.434,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the celebratory moment after he showed

141
0:07:33.213,000 --> 0:07:37,000
muscle resistance for the very first time,

142
0:07:37.22,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the new adapted technologies that allowed him

143
0:07:39.93,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to gain more and more independence.

144
0:07:43.81,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I photographed the care and the love

145
0:07:45.823,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that surrounded him.

146
0:07:56.89,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But my photographs only told the outside story

147
0:08:00.304,000 --> 0:08:03,000
of a man lying in a hospital bed

148
0:08:03.616,000 --> 0:08:04,000
attached to a breathing machine.

149
0:08:05.27,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I wasn't able to portray his story from within,

150
0:08:08.892,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and so I began to search for a new visual language,

151
0:08:12.215,000 --> 0:08:15,000
one which strived to express the ephemeral quality

152
0:08:15.513,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of his spiritual experience.

153
0:08:38.026,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Finally, I want to share with you

154
0:08:40.284,000 --> 0:08:43,000
a video from a series that I've been working on

155
0:08:43.642,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that tries to express the slow, in-between existence

156
0:08:46.91,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that my father has experienced.

157
0:08:49.62,000 --> 0:08:52,000
As he began to regain his ability to breathe,

158
0:08:53.17,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I started recording his thoughts,

159
0:08:55.802,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and so the voice that you hear in this video

160
0:08:57.726,000 --> 0:08:59,000
is his voice.

161
0:09:00.336,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Video) Ronnie Cahana: You have to believe

162
0:09:03.418,000 --> 0:09:05,000
you're paralyzed

163
0:09:06.152,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to play the part

164
0:09:08.907,000 --> 0:09:13,000
of a quadriplegic.

165
0:09:14.14,000 --> 0:09:15,000
I don't.

166
0:09:16.108,000 --> 0:09:18,000
In my mind,

167
0:09:18.694,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and in my dreams

168
0:09:21.456,000 --> 0:09:23,000
every night

169
0:09:24.296,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I Chagall-man float

170
0:09:29.211,000 --> 0:09:32,000
over the city

171
0:09:32.339,000 --> 0:09:35,000
twirl and swirl

172
0:09:35.556,000 --> 0:09:42,000
with my toes kissing the floor.

173
0:09:43.475,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I know nothing about the statement

174
0:09:50.382,000 --> 0:09:55,000
of man without motion.

175
0:09:56.175,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Everything has motion.

176
0:09:59.799,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The heart pumps.

177
0:10:03.15,000 --> 0:10:07,000
The body heaves.

178
0:10:07.446,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The mouth moves.

179
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We never stagnate.

180
0:10:16.231,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Life triumphs up and down.

181
0:10:23.055,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Kitra Cahana: For most of us,

182
0:10:25.131,000 --> 0:10:27,000
our muscles begin to twitch and move

183
0:10:27.865,000 --> 0:10:29,000
long before we are conscious,

184
0:10:30.373,000 --> 0:10:32,000
but my father tells me his privilege

185
0:10:33.29,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is living on the far periphery

186
0:10:35.469,000 --> 0:10:38,000
of the human experience.

187
0:10:38.472,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Like an astronaut who sees a perspective

188
0:10:41.104,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that very few of us will ever get to share,

189
0:10:44.322,000 --> 0:10:47,000
he wonders and watches as he takes

190
0:10:47.428,000 --> 0:10:48,000
his first breaths

191
0:10:49.305,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and dreams about crawling back home.

192
0:10:53.344,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So begins life at 57, he says.

193
0:10:57.123,000 --> 0:11:,000
A toddler has no attitude in its being,

194
0:11:00.622,000 --> 0:11:05,000
but a man insists on his world every day.

195
0:11:06.325,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Few of us will ever have to face physical limitations

196
0:11:09.97,000 --> 0:11:11,000
to the degree that my father has,

197
0:11:12.928,000 --> 0:11:15,000
but we will all have moments of paralysis

198
0:11:16.079,000 --> 0:11:18,000
in our lives.

199
0:11:18.44,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I know I frequently confront walls

200
0:11:21.658,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that feel completely unscalable,

201
0:11:24.897,000 --> 0:11:26,000
but my father insists

202
0:11:27.157,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that there are no dead ends.

203
0:11:30.03,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Instead, he invites me into his space of co-healing

204
0:11:35.24,000 --> 0:11:38,000
to give the very best of myself, and for him

205
0:11:38.844,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to give the very best of himself to me.

206
0:11:42.274,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Paralysis was an opening for him.

207
0:11:45.311,000 --> 0:11:47,000
It was an opportunity to emerge,

208
0:11:47.662,000 --> 0:11:49,000
to rekindle life force,

209
0:11:49.856,000 --> 0:11:51,000
to sit still long enough with himself

210
0:11:51.89,000 --> 0:11:54,000
so as to fall in love with the full continuum

211
0:11:55.2,000 --> 0:11:57,000
of creation.

212
0:11:57.494,000 --> 0:12:,000
Today, my father is no longer locked in.

213
0:12:01.476,000 --> 0:12:04,000
He moves his neck with ease,

214
0:12:04.637,000 --> 0:12:06,000
has had his feeding peg removed,

215
0:12:07.368,000 --> 0:12:09,000
breathes with his own lungs,

216
0:12:10.15,000 --> 0:12:13,000
speaks slowly with his own quiet voice,

217
0:12:13.634,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and works every day

218
0:12:15.938,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to gain more movement in his paralyzed body.

219
0:12:21.148,000 --> 0:12:23,000
But the work will never be finished.

220
0:12:23.499,000 --> 0:12:27,000
As he says, "I'm living in a broken world,

221
0:12:28.212,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and there is holy work to do."

222
0:12:31.243,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Thank you.

223
0:12:33.263,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Applause)

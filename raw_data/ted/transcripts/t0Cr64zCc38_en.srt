1
0:00:13.25,000 --> 0:00:15,000
When people meet me for the first time on my job,

2
0:00:16.25,000 --> 0:00:19,000
they often feel inspired to share a revelation they've had about me,

3
0:00:19.75,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and it kind of goes something like this.

4
0:00:22.292,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"Hey, I know why police chiefs

5
0:00:24.583,000 --> 0:00:26,000
like to share their deep, dark secrets with you.

6
0:00:27.042,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Phil, with your PhD in psychology,

7
0:00:30.083,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and your shiny bald head,

8
0:00:31.375,000 --> 0:00:33,000
you're basically the Black Dr. Phil, right?"

9
0:00:33.542,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:34.792,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And for each and every person who's ever said that to me

11
0:00:37.458,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I do want to say thank you

12
0:00:38.75,000 --> 0:00:4,000
because that was the first time I ever heard that joke.

13
0:00:41.375,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:42.417,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But for everybody else, I really hope you'll believe me

15
0:00:45.042,000 --> 0:00:47,000
when I tell you no police chief likes talking to me

16
0:00:47.708,000 --> 0:00:49,000
because they think I'm a clinical psychologist.

17
0:00:49.958,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And also I'm not.

18
0:00:51.25,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I have no idea what your mother did to you, and I can't help.

19
0:00:54.125,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Laughter)

20
0:00:55.167,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Police chiefs like talking to me

21
0:00:57.208,000 --> 0:01:01,000
because I'm an expert on a problem that feels impossible for them to solve:

22
0:01:01.833,000 --> 0:01:02,000
racism in their profession.

23
0:01:03.792,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now my expertise comes from being a scientist

24
0:01:06.292,000 --> 0:01:09,000
who studies how our minds learn to associate Blackness and crime

25
0:01:10.125,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and misperceive Black children as older than they actually are.

26
0:01:13.917,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It also comes from studying actual police behavior,

27
0:01:16.708,000 --> 0:01:18,000
which is how I know that every year,

28
0:01:18.792,000 --> 0:01:2,000
about one in five adults in the United States

29
0:01:20.958,000 --> 0:01:22,000
has contact with law enforcement.

30
0:01:23.042,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Out of those, about a million are targeted for police use of force.

31
0:01:26.417,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And if you're Black,

32
0:01:27.708,000 --> 0:01:3,000
you're two to four times more likely to be targeted for that force

33
0:01:30.875,000 --> 0:01:31,000
than if you're white.

34
0:01:32.167,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But it also comes from knowing what those statistics feel like.

35
0:01:36.875,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I've experienced the fear of seeing an officer unclip their gun

36
0:01:40.458,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and the panic of realizing that someone might mistake my 13-year-old godson

37
0:01:44.75,000 --> 0:01:45,000
as old enough to be a threat.

38
0:01:47.333,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So when a police chief,

39
0:01:49.458,000 --> 0:01:5,000
or a pastor,

40
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:52,000
or an imam, or a mother --

41
0:01:52.958,000 --> 0:01:56,000
when they call me after an officer shoots another unarmed Black child,

42
0:01:57.875,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I understand a bit of the pain in their voice.

43
0:02:00.875,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's the pain of a heart breaking when it fails to solve a deadly problem.

44
0:02:06.167,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Breaking from trying to do something

45
0:02:08.25,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that feels simultaneously necessary and impossible.

46
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The way trying to fix racism usually feels.

47
0:02:17.792,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Necessary and impossible.

48
0:02:21.208,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So, police chiefs like talking to me because I'm an expert,

49
0:02:24.042,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but I doubt they'd be lining up to lie down on Dr. Phil's couch

50
0:02:27.042,000 --> 0:02:29,000
if I told them all their problems were hopeless.

51
0:02:29.333,000 --> 0:02:3,000
All of my research,

52
0:02:31.083,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and the decade of work I've done with my center --

53
0:02:33.5,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the Center for Policing Equity --

54
0:02:35.167,000 --> 0:02:37,000
actually leads me to a hopeful conclusion

55
0:02:37.208,000 --> 0:02:39,000
amidst all the heartbreak of race in America,

56
0:02:39.417,000 --> 0:02:4,000
which is this:

57
0:02:41.042,000 --> 0:02:45,000
trying to solve racism feels impossible

58
0:02:45.083,000 --> 0:02:48,000
because our definition of racism makes it impossible --

59
0:02:48.958,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but it doesn't have to be that way.

60
0:02:50.958,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So here's what I mean.

61
0:02:52.25,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The most common definition of racism

62
0:02:54.042,000 --> 0:02:59,000
is that racist behaviors are the product of contaminated hearts and minds.

63
0:02:59.083,000 --> 0:03:01,000
When you listen to the way we talk about trying to cure racism,

64
0:03:02.083,000 --> 0:03:03,000
you'll hear it.

65
0:03:03.375,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"We need to stamp out hatred.

66
0:03:05.167,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We need to combat ignorance," right?

67
0:03:07.417,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It's hearts and minds.

68
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Now the only problem with that definition is that it's completely wrong --

69
0:03:13.667,000 --> 0:03:14,000
both scientifically and otherwise.

70
0:03:15.333,000 --> 0:03:17,000
One of the foundational insights of social psychology

71
0:03:18.042,000 --> 0:03:21,000
is that attitudes are very weak predictors of behaviors,

72
0:03:21.083,000 --> 0:03:22,000
but more importantly than that,

73
0:03:22.625,000 --> 0:03:24,000
no Black community has ever taken to the streets

74
0:03:25.375,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to demand that white people would love us more.

75
0:03:28.833,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Communities march to stop the killing,

76
0:03:32.125,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because racism is about behaviors, not feelings.

77
0:03:36.542,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And even when civil rights leaders

78
0:03:38.25,000 --> 0:03:41,000
like King and Fannie Lou Hamer used the language of love,

79
0:03:41.833,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the racism they fought,

80
0:03:43.875,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that was segregation and brutality.

81
0:03:46.333,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It's actions over feelings.

82
0:03:48.75,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And every one of those leaders would agree,

83
0:03:50.833,000 --> 0:03:52,000
if a definition of racism makes it harder to see

84
0:03:53.5,000 --> 0:03:55,000
the injuries racism causes,

85
0:03:55.542,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that's not just wrong.

86
0:03:57.167,000 --> 0:04:,000
A definition that cares about the intentions of abusers

87
0:04:00.667,000 --> 0:04:02,000
more than the harms to the abused --

88
0:04:02.708,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that definition of racism is racist.

89
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But when we change the definition of racism from attitudes to behaviors,

90
0:04:12.292,000 --> 0:04:16,000
we transform that problem from impossible to solvable.

91
0:04:16.875,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Because you can measure behaviors.

92
0:04:19.542,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And when you can measure a problem,

93
0:04:21.292,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you can tap into one of the only universal rules of organizational success.

94
0:04:24.875,000 --> 0:04:26,000
You've got a problem or a goal, you measure it,

95
0:04:27.125,000 --> 0:04:29,000
you hold yourself accountable to that metric.

96
0:04:29.291,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So if every other organization measures success this way,

97
0:04:32.083,000 --> 0:04:34,000
why can't we do that in policing?

98
0:04:35.542,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It turns out we actually already do.

99
0:04:38.458,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Police departments already practice data-driven accountability,

100
0:04:42.042,000 --> 0:04:43,000
it's just for crime.

101
0:04:43.542,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The vast majority of police departments across the United States

102
0:04:46.625,000 --> 0:04:48,000
use a system called CompStat.

103
0:04:49.375,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's a process that, when you use it right,

104
0:04:51.917,000 --> 0:04:53,000
it identifies crime data,

105
0:04:54.333,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it tracks it and identifies patterns,

106
0:04:56.292,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and then it allows departments to hold themselves accountable

107
0:04:59.375,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to public safety goals.

108
0:05:01.458,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It usually works either by directing police attentions and police resources,

109
0:05:06.292,000 --> 0:05:08,000
or changing police behavior once they show up.

110
0:05:08.833,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So if I see a string of muggings in that neighborhood,

111
0:05:11.417,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I'm going to want to increase patrols in that neighborhood.

112
0:05:14.25,000 --> 0:05:15,000
If I see a spike in homicides,

113
0:05:15.75,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I'm going to want to talk to the community to find out why

114
0:05:18.542,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and collaborate on changes on police behavior to tamp down the violence.

115
0:05:22.625,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Now when you define racism in terms of measurable behaviors,

116
0:05:26.958,000 --> 0:05:27,000
you can do the same thing.

117
0:05:29.208,000 --> 0:05:32,000
You can create a CompStat for justice.

118
0:05:32.25,000 --> 0:05:35,000
That's exactly what the Center for Policing Equity has been doing.

119
0:05:35.417,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So let me tell you how that works.

120
0:05:37.083,000 --> 0:05:38,000
After a police department invites us in,

121
0:05:39.042,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we handle the legal stuff, we engage with the community,

122
0:05:41.708,000 --> 0:05:43,000
our next step is to analyze their data.

123
0:05:44.208,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The goal of these analyses is to determine

124
0:05:46.583,000 --> 0:05:5,000
how much do crime, poverty, neighborhood demographics

125
0:05:51.042,000 --> 0:05:54,000
predict, let's say, police use of force?

126
0:05:54.625,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Let's say that those factors predict

127
0:05:56.625,000 --> 0:05:58,000
police will use force on this many Black people.

128
0:06:00.125,000 --> 0:06:01,000
There?

129
0:06:01.417,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So our next question is,

130
0:06:02.75,000 --> 0:06:04,000
how many Black people actually are targeted

131
0:06:04.833,000 --> 0:06:05,000
for police use of force?

132
0:06:06.125,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Let's say it's this many.

133
0:06:07.875,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So what's up with the gap?

134
0:06:10.167,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Well, a big portion of the gap is the difference

135
0:06:12.75,000 --> 0:06:15,000
between what's predicted by things police can't control

136
0:06:16.042,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and what's predicted by things police can control --

137
0:06:18.542,000 --> 0:06:19,000
their policies and their behaviors.

138
0:06:20.542,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And what we're looking for are the types of contact

139
0:06:23.125,000 --> 0:06:24,000
or the areas in the city

140
0:06:24.583,000 --> 0:06:25,000
where that gap is biggest,

141
0:06:26.417,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because then we can tell our partners,

142
0:06:28.292,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"Look here. Solve this problem first."

143
0:06:32.042,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's actually the kind of therapy police chiefs can get behind,

144
0:06:35.125,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because there is nothing so inspiring in the face of our history of racism

145
0:06:39.542,000 --> 0:06:4,000
as a solvable problem.

146
0:06:42.333,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Look, if the community in Minneapolis asked their police department

147
0:06:47.042,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to remedy the moral failings of race in policing,

148
0:06:50.208,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I'm not sure they know how to do that.

149
0:06:52.333,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But if instead the community says,

150
0:06:54,000 --> 0:06:57,000
"Hey, you're data say you're beating up a lot of homeless folks.

151
0:06:57.083,000 --> 0:06:58,000
You want to knock that off?"

152
0:06:58.5,000 --> 0:07:,000
That's something police can learn how to do.

153
0:07:01.125,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And they did.

154
0:07:02.542,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So in 2015, the Minneapolis PD let us know

155
0:07:05.625,000 --> 0:07:07,000
their community was concerned they were using force too often.

156
0:07:08.583,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So we showed them how to leverage their own data

157
0:07:10.875,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to identify situations where force could be avoided.

158
0:07:13.833,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And when you look at those data,

159
0:07:15.417,000 --> 0:07:18,000
you'll see that a disproportionate number of their use-of-force incidents,

160
0:07:18.958,000 --> 0:07:2,000
they involved somebody who's homeless, in mental distress,

161
0:07:21.75,000 --> 0:07:23,000
has a substance abuse issue or some combination of all three --

162
0:07:24.75,000 --> 0:07:25,000
more than you expect

163
0:07:26.5,000 --> 0:07:28,000
based on those factors I was just telling you about.

164
0:07:29.292,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So right there's the gap.

165
0:07:31.75,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Next question is why.

166
0:07:33.583,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Well, it turns out homeless folks often need services.

167
0:07:37.25,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And when those services are unavailable, when they can't get their meds,

168
0:07:40.708,000 --> 0:07:41,000
they lose their spot in the shelter,

169
0:07:42.5,000 --> 0:07:45,000
they're more likely to engage in behaviors that end up with folks calling the cops.

170
0:07:46.458,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And when the cops show up,

171
0:07:47.792,000 --> 0:07:49,000
they're more likely to resist intervention,

172
0:07:49.875,000 --> 0:07:51,000
oftentimes because they haven't actually done anything illegal,

173
0:07:52.875,000 --> 0:07:54,000
they're literally just living outside.

174
0:07:55.375,000 --> 0:07:58,000
The problem wasn't a need to train officers differently in Minneapolis.

175
0:07:59.125,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The problem was the fact that folks were using the cops

176
0:08:01.75,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to "treat" substance abuse and homelessness in the first place.

177
0:08:05.083,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So the city of Minneapolis found a way to deliver social services

178
0:08:08.5,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and city resources

179
0:08:09.792,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to the homeless community before anybody ever called the cops.

180
0:08:13.208,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Applause)

181
0:08:20.375,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Now the problem isn't always homelessness, right?

182
0:08:23.208,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Sometimes the problem is fear of immigration enforcement,

183
0:08:25.958,000 --> 0:08:27,000
like it was in Salt Lake City, or it is in Houston,

184
0:08:28.458,000 --> 0:08:29,000
where the chiefs had to come forward

185
0:08:30.25,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and say, "We're not going to deport you just for calling 911."

186
0:08:33.208,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Or the problem is foot pursuits,

187
0:08:34.917,000 --> 0:08:35,000
like it was in Las Vegas,

188
0:08:36.25,000 --> 0:08:39,000
where they had to train their officers to slow down and take a breath

189
0:08:40.125,000 --> 0:08:43,000
instead of allowing the adrenaline in that situation to escalate it.

190
0:08:43.875,000 --> 0:08:44,000
It's searches in Oakland;

191
0:08:45.875,000 --> 0:08:47,000
it's pulling folks out of cars in San Jose;

192
0:08:48.75,000 --> 0:08:5,000
it's the way that they patrol the neighborhoods

193
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that make up Zone 3 in Pittsburgh

194
0:08:53.292,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and the Black neighborhoods closest to the waterfront in Baltimore.

195
0:08:56.5,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But in each city,

196
0:08:57.792,000 --> 0:08:59,000
if we can give them a solvable problem,

197
0:09:00.208,000 --> 0:09:02,000
they get busy solving it.

198
0:09:02.333,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And together our partners have seen an average of 25 percent fewer arrests,

199
0:09:06.417,000 --> 0:09:07,000
fewer use-of-force incidents

200
0:09:07.792,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and 13 percent fewer officer-related injuries.

201
0:09:10.958,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Essentially, by identifying the biggest gaps

202
0:09:14.5,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and directing police attentions to solving it,

203
0:09:17.25,000 --> 0:09:21,000
we can deliver a data-driven vaccine against racial disparities in policing.

204
0:09:23.583,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Right now, we have the capacity to partner with about 40 cities at a time.

205
0:09:29.417,000 --> 0:09:32,000
That means if we want the United States to stop feeling exhausted

206
0:09:33.292,000 --> 0:09:35,000
from trying to solve an impossible problem,

207
0:09:35.583,000 --> 0:09:37,000
we're going to need a lot more infrastructure.

208
0:09:38.25,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Because our goal is to have our tools be able to scale

209
0:09:41.875,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the brilliance of dedicated organizers

210
0:09:44.375,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and reform-minded chiefs.

211
0:09:46.542,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So to get there we're going to need the kind of collective will

212
0:09:49.542,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that desegregated schools

213
0:09:50.875,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and won the franchise for the sons and daughters of former slaves

214
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:56,000
so that we can build a kind of health care system

215
0:09:56.333,000 --> 0:09:58,000
capable of delivering our vaccine across the country.

216
0:10:00.417,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Because our audacious idea

217
0:10:03.583,000 --> 0:10:04,000
is to deliver a CompStat for justice

218
0:10:05.583,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to departments serving 100 million people across the United States

219
0:10:09.375,000 --> 0:10:1,000
in the next five years.

220
0:10:11.5,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Applause and cheers)

221
0:10:18.792,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Doing that would mean arming about a third of the United States

222
0:10:22.083,000 --> 0:10:27,000
with tools to reduce racial disparities in police stops, arrests and use of force,

223
0:10:27.292,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but also tools to reduce predatory cash bail

224
0:10:30.583,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and mass incarceration,

225
0:10:31.875,000 --> 0:10:32,000
family instability

226
0:10:33.167,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and chronic mental health and substance abuse issues,

227
0:10:35.708,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and every other ill that our broken criminal-legal systems aggravate.

228
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Because every unnecessary arrest we can prevent

229
0:10:42.167,000 --> 0:10:45,000
saves a family from the terrifying journey through each one of those systems.

230
0:10:45.875,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Just like every gun we can leave holstered

231
0:10:48.583,000 --> 0:10:52,000
saves an entire community from a lifetime of grief.

232
0:10:54.917,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Look, each and every one of us,

233
0:10:57.833,000 --> 0:10:59,000
we measure the things that matter to us.

234
0:11:01.75,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Businesses measure profit;

235
0:11:03.75,000 --> 0:11:06,000
good students keep track of their grades;

236
0:11:06.833,000 --> 0:11:08,000
families chart the growth of their children

237
0:11:09.333,000 --> 0:11:11,000
with pencil markings in doorframes.

238
0:11:11.75,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We all measure the things that matter most to us,

239
0:11:14.292,000 --> 0:11:16,000
which is why we feel the neglect

240
0:11:17.167,000 --> 0:11:2,000
when nobody's bothering to measure anything at all.

241
0:11:20.292,000 --> 0:11:22,000
For the past quarter millennium,

242
0:11:22.875,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we've defined the problems of race and policing

243
0:11:25.833,000 --> 0:11:27,000
in a way that's functionally impossible to measure.

244
0:11:29.875,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But now the science says we can just change that definition.

245
0:11:34.208,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And the folks at the Center for Policing Equity,

246
0:11:36.5,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I actually think we may have measured

247
0:11:38.333,000 --> 0:11:4,000
more police behavior than any one in human history.

248
0:11:40.792,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And that means that once we have the will

249
0:11:45.5,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and the resources to do it,

250
0:11:48.708,000 --> 0:11:5,000
this could be the generation

251
0:11:50.75,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that stops feeling like racism is an unsolvable problem

252
0:11:56.542,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and instead sees

253
0:11:58.083,000 --> 0:12:03,000
that what's been necessary for far too long is possible.

254
0:12:04.875,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Thank you.

255
0:12:06.208,000 --> 0:12:1,000
(Applause and cheers)

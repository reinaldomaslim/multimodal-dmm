1
0:00:15.585,000 --> 0:00:2,000
What I'm going to show you are the astonishing molecular machines

2
0:00:20.926,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that create the living fabric of your body.

3
0:00:24.25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Now molecules are really, really tiny.

4
0:00:28.057,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And by tiny, I mean really.

5
0:00:31.905,000 --> 0:00:33,000
They're smaller than a wavelength of light,

6
0:00:33.931,000 --> 0:00:35,000
so we have no way to directly observe them.

7
0:00:37.011,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But through science, we do have a fairly good idea

8
0:00:39.378,000 --> 0:00:41,000
of what's going on down at the molecular scale.

9
0:00:42.059,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules,

10
0:00:44.86,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but we don't really have a direct way of showing you the molecules.

11
0:00:48.121,000 --> 0:00:5,000
One way around this is to draw pictures.

12
0:00:50.395,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And this idea is actually nothing new.

13
0:00:52.959,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Scientists have always created pictures

14
0:00:55.271,000 --> 0:00:57,000
as part of their thinking and discovery process.

15
0:00:58.081,000 --> 0:01:,000
They draw pictures of what they're observing with their eyes,

16
0:01:00.98,000 --> 0:01:02,000
through technology like telescopes and microscopes,

17
0:01:03.396,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and also what they're thinking about in their minds.

18
0:01:05.859,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I picked two well-known examples,

19
0:01:07.486,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because they're very well-known for expressing science through art.

20
0:01:11.44,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And I start with Galileo, who used the world's first telescope

21
0:01:15.167,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to look at the Moon.

22
0:01:16.377,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And he transformed our understanding of the Moon.

23
0:01:18.708,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The perception in the 17th century

24
0:01:20.365,000 --> 0:01:22,000
was the Moon was a perfect heavenly sphere.

25
0:01:22.835,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But what Galileo saw was a rocky, barren world,

26
0:01:25.843,000 --> 0:01:27,000
which he expressed through his watercolor painting.

27
0:01:28.671,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Another scientist with very big ideas,

28
0:01:31.594,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the superstar of biology is Charles Darwin.

29
0:01:34.142,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And with this famous entry in his notebook,

30
0:01:36.21,000 --> 0:01:38,000
he begins in the top left-hand corner with, "I think,"

31
0:01:39.074,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and then sketches out the first tree of life,

32
0:01:41.805,000 --> 0:01:43,000
which is his perception of how all the species,

33
0:01:44.759,000 --> 0:01:47,000
all living things on Earth are connected through evolutionary history --

34
0:01:48.641,000 --> 0:01:5,000
the origin of species through natural selection

35
0:01:50.912,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and divergence from an ancestral population.

36
0:01:53.775,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Even as a scientist,

37
0:01:55.648,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I used to go to lectures by molecular biologists

38
0:01:58.185,000 --> 0:02:,000
and find them completely incomprehensible,

39
0:02:00.934,000 --> 0:02:02,000
with all the fancy technical language and jargon

40
0:02:03.226,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that they would use in describing their work,

41
0:02:05.374,000 --> 0:02:08,000
until I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell,

42
0:02:08.449,000 --> 0:02:1,000
who is a molecular biologist at the Scripps Institute.

43
0:02:11.214,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And his pictures -- everything's accurate and it's all to scale.

44
0:02:14.807,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And his work illuminated for me

45
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
what the molecular world inside us is like.

46
0:02:20.075,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So this is a transection through blood.

47
0:02:22.124,000 --> 0:02:24,000
In the top left-hand corner, you've got this yellow-green area.

48
0:02:25.125,000 --> 0:02:28,000
The yellow-green area is the fluid of blood, which is mostly water,

49
0:02:28.365,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but it's also antibodies, sugars, hormones, that kind of thing.

50
0:02:31.376,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And the red region is a slice into a red blood cell.

51
0:02:33.888,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And those red molecules are hemoglobin.

52
0:02:35.778,000 --> 0:02:37,000
They are actually red; that's what gives blood its color.

53
0:02:38.497,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge

54
0:02:40.488,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to soak up the oxygen in your lungs

55
0:02:42.189,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and then carry it to other parts of the body.

56
0:02:44.326,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I was very much inspired by this image many years ago,

57
0:02:46.882,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and I wondered whether we could use computer graphics

58
0:02:49.457,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to represent the molecular world.

59
0:02:51.085,000 --> 0:02:52,000
What would it look like?

60
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And that's how I really began.

61
0:02:54.123,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So let's begin.

62
0:02:55.76,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This is DNA in its classic double helix form.

63
0:02:58.169,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And it's from X-ray crystallography, so it's an accurate model of DNA.

64
0:03:01.549,000 --> 0:03:03,000
If we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands,

65
0:03:04.544,000 --> 0:03:06,000
you see these things that look like teeth.

66
0:03:06.587,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Those are the letters of genetic code,

67
0:03:08.428,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the 25,000 genes you've got written in your DNA.

68
0:03:10.721,000 --> 0:03:12,000
This is what they typically talk about -- the genetic code --

69
0:03:13.681,000 --> 0:03:14,000
this is what they're talking about.

70
0:03:15.396,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But I want to talk about a different aspect of DNA science,

71
0:03:18.19,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and that is the physical nature of DNA.

72
0:03:20.103,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's these two strands that run in opposite directions

73
0:03:22.712,000 --> 0:03:24,000
for reasons I can't go into right now.

74
0:03:24.906,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But they physically run in opposite directions,

75
0:03:27.138,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which creates a number of complications for your living cells,

76
0:03:30.793,000 --> 0:03:31,000
as you're about to see,

77
0:03:32.046,000 --> 0:03:34,000
most particularly when DNA is being copied.

78
0:03:34.432,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And so what I'm about to show you

79
0:03:36.374,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication machine

80
0:03:40.414,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that's occurring right now inside your body,

81
0:03:42.495,000 --> 0:03:43,000
at least 2002 biology.

82
0:03:44.617,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So DNA's entering the production line from the left-hand side,

83
0:03:47.994,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and it hits this collection, these miniature biochemical machines,

84
0:03:51.185,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that are pulling apart the DNA strand and making an exact copy.

85
0:03:54.353,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So DNA comes in and hits this blue, doughnut-shaped structure

86
0:03:57.886,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and it's ripped apart into its two strands.

87
0:04:00.679,000 --> 0:04:01,000
One strand can be copied directly,

88
0:04:02.327,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there.

89
0:04:05.274,000 --> 0:04:07,000
But things aren't so simple for the other strand

90
0:04:07.558,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because it must be copied backwards.

91
0:04:09.347,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So it's thrown out repeatedly in these loops

92
0:04:11.481,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and copied one section at a time, creating two new DNA molecules.

93
0:04:15.549,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Now you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you,

94
0:04:20.856,000 --> 0:04:22,000
copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity.

95
0:04:23.936,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's an accurate representation,

96
0:04:25.494,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and it's pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you.

97
0:04:29.047,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I've left out error correction and a bunch of other things.

98
0:04:31.888,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:33.671,000 --> 0:04:35,000
This was work from a number of years ago--

100
0:04:35.816,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Thank you.

101
0:04:37.009,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Applause)

102
0:04:38.405,000 --> 0:04:39,000
This is work from a number of years ago,

103
0:04:40.358,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but what I'll show you next is updated science,

104
0:04:42.649,000 --> 0:04:43,000
it's updated technology.

105
0:04:43.835,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So again, we begin with DNA.

106
0:04:45.219,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And it's jiggling and wiggling there

107
0:04:46.961,000 --> 0:04:48,000
because of the surrounding soup of molecules,

108
0:04:49.166,000 --> 0:04:51,000
which I've stripped away so you can see something.

109
0:04:51.573,000 --> 0:04:53,000
DNA is about two nanometers across, which is really quite tiny.

110
0:04:54.572,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But in each one of your cells,

111
0:04:56.03,000 --> 0:04:59,000
each strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long.

112
0:04:59.674,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code,

113
0:05:03.514,000 --> 0:05:05,000
it's wrapped around these purple proteins --

114
0:05:05.621,000 --> 0:05:06,000
or I've labeled them purple here.

115
0:05:07.227,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It's packaged up and bundled up.

116
0:05:08.835,000 --> 0:05:1,000
All this field of view is a single strand of DNA.

117
0:05:11.771,000 --> 0:05:14,000
This huge package of DNA is called a chromosome.

118
0:05:14.877,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And we'll come back to chromosomes in a minute.

119
0:05:17.675,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We're pulling out, we're zooming out,

120
0:05:19.765,000 --> 0:05:2,000
out through a nuclear pore,

121
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the DNA,

122
0:05:24.944,000 --> 0:05:25,000
called the nucleus.

123
0:05:26.917,000 --> 0:05:3,000
All of this field of view is about a semester's worth of biology,

124
0:05:31.172,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and I've got seven minutes,

125
0:05:32.561,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So we're not going to be able to do that today?

126
0:05:35.273,000 --> 0:05:36,000
No, I'm being told, "No."

127
0:05:37.676,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is the way a living cell looks down a light microscope.

128
0:05:41.065,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And it's been filmed under time-lapse, which is why you can see it moving.

129
0:05:44.587,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The nuclear envelope breaks down.

130
0:05:46.192,000 --> 0:05:48,000
These sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes,

131
0:05:48.461,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and we'll focus on them.

132
0:05:49.666,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots.

133
0:05:54.328,000 --> 0:05:58,000
When the cell feels it's ready to go, it rips apart the chromosome.

134
0:05:58.587,000 --> 0:06:,000
One set of DNA goes to one side,

135
0:06:00.652,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the other side gets the other set of DNA --

136
0:06:02.699,000 --> 0:06:03,000
identical copies of DNA.

137
0:06:04.56,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And then the cell splits down the middle.

138
0:06:06.544,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And again, you have billions of cells undergoing this process

139
0:06:09.427,000 --> 0:06:1,000
right now inside of you.

140
0:06:11.602,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Now we're going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes,

141
0:06:14.482,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and look at its structure and describe it.

142
0:06:17.248,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So again, here we are at that equator moment.

143
0:06:20.654,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The chromosomes line up.

144
0:06:21.878,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And if we isolate just one chromosome,

145
0:06:23.729,000 --> 0:06:25,000
we're going to pull it out and have a look at its structure.

146
0:06:26.57,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have,

147
0:06:29.656,000 --> 0:06:32,000
at least as far as we've discovered so far inside of us.

148
0:06:33.286,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So this is a single chromosome.

149
0:06:35.286,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome.

150
0:06:37.911,000 --> 0:06:38,000
One is bundled up into one sausage.

151
0:06:39.656,000 --> 0:06:41,000
The other strand is bundled up into the other sausage.

152
0:06:42.413,000 --> 0:06:45,000
These things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side

153
0:06:45.999,000 --> 0:06:46,000
are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell.

154
0:06:47.929,000 --> 0:06:49,000
They're called microtubules, that name's not important.

155
0:06:50.864,000 --> 0:06:52,000
But we're going to focus on the region labeled red here --

156
0:06:53.619,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and it's the interface between the dynamic scaffolding

157
0:06:56.18,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and the chromosomes.

158
0:06:57.371,000 --> 0:07:,000
It is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes.

159
0:07:00.5,000 --> 0:07:03,000
We have no idea, really, as to how it's achieving that movement.

160
0:07:04.096,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We've been studying this thing they call the kinetochore

161
0:07:06.767,000 --> 0:07:08,000
for over a hundred years with intense study,

162
0:07:08.863,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and we're still just beginning to discover what it's about.

163
0:07:11.713,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It is made up of about 200 different types of proteins,

164
0:07:14.491,000 --> 0:07:15,000
thousands of proteins in total.

165
0:07:16.99,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It is a signal broadcasting system.

166
0:07:19.834,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It broadcasts through chemical signals,

167
0:07:22.022,000 --> 0:07:24,000
telling the rest of the cell when it's ready,

168
0:07:24.79,000 --> 0:07:26,000
when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go

169
0:07:27.645,000 --> 0:07:28,000
for the separation of the chromosomes.

170
0:07:29.647,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules.

171
0:07:33.003,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It's involved with the growing of the microtubules,

172
0:07:36.226,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and it's able to transiently couple onto them.

173
0:07:39.359,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's also an attention-sensing system.

174
0:07:41.203,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's able to feel when the cell is ready,

175
0:07:43.203,000 --> 0:07:45,000
when the chromosome is correctly positioned.

176
0:07:45.461,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's turning green here because it feels that everything is just right.

177
0:07:49.298,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And you'll see, there's this one little last bit

178
0:07:51.58,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that's still remaining red.

179
0:07:53.037,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And it's walked away down the microtubules.

180
0:07:57.149,000 --> 0:08:,000
That is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal.

181
0:08:00.352,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And it's walked away -- I mean, it's that mechanical.

182
0:08:03.072,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It's molecular clockwork.

183
0:08:04.664,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This is how you work at the molecular scale.

184
0:08:07.869,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So with a little bit of molecular eye candy,

185
0:08:10.157,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:11.379,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we've got kinesins, the orange ones.

187
0:08:13.353,000 --> 0:08:15,000
They're little molecular courier molecules walking one way.

188
0:08:16.15,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And here are the dynein, they're carrying that broadcasting system.

189
0:08:19.32,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And they've got their long legs

190
0:08:20.888,000 --> 0:08:22,000
so they can step around obstacles and so on.

191
0:08:22.978,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So again, this is all derived accurately from the science.

192
0:08:26.029,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The problem is we can't show it to you any other way.

193
0:08:28.603,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Exploring at the frontier of science, at the frontier of human understanding,

194
0:08:33.461,000 --> 0:08:34,000
is mind-blowing.

195
0:08:35.974,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Discovering this stuff

196
0:08:37.176,000 --> 0:08:4,000
is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science.

197
0:08:41.22,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But most medical researchers --

198
0:08:43.901,000 --> 0:08:47,000
discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals,

199
0:08:48.138,000 --> 0:08:52,000
which are to eradicate disease, to eliminate the suffering

200
0:08:52.583,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and the misery that disease causes

201
0:08:54.682,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and to lift people out of poverty.

202
0:08:56.386,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Thank you.

203
0:08:57.682,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Applause)

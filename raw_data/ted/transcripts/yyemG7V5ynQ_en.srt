1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So, basically we have public leaders,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
public officials who are out of control;

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
they are writing bills that are unintelligible,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and out of these bills are going to come

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
maybe 40,000 pages of regulations, total complexity,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
which has a dramatically negative impact on our life.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
If you're a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits;

9
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
if you're trying to get a small business loan,

10
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
you face a blizzard of paperwork.

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
What are we going to do about it? I define simplicity

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
as a means to achieving clarity,

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
transparency and empathy,

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
building humanity into communications.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I've been simplifying things for 30 years.

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I come out of the advertising and design business.

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
My focus is understanding you people,

18
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and how you interact with the government

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to get your benefits,

20
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
how you interact with corporations to decide whom you're going to do business with,

21
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and how you view brands.

22
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So, very quickly, when President Obama said,

23
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
"I don't see why we can't

24
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
have a one-page, plain English consumer credit agreement."

25
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So, I locked myself in a room,

26
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
figured out the content,

27
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
organized the document, and wrote it in plain English.

28
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I've had this checked by the two top

29
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
consumer credit lawyers in the country.

30
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This is a real thing.

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Now, I went one step further and said,

32
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
"Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers

33
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and just have a paper document? Let's go online."

34
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And many people

35
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
might need help in computation.

36
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Working with the Harvard Business School,

37
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
you'll see this example when you talk about minimum payment:

38
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
If you spent 62 dollars for a meal,

39
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the longer you take to pay out that loan,

40
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
you see, over a period of time using the minimum payment

41
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
it's 99 dollars and 17 cents.

42
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
How about that? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people?

43
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But it's going to work. It's more effective

44
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
than just computational aids.

45
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And what about terms like

46
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
"over the limit"?

47
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Perhaps a stealth thing.

48
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Define it in context. Tell people what it means.

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
When you put it in plain English,

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
you almost force the institution

51
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
to give the people a way, a default out of that,

52
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and not put themselves at risk.

53
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Plain English is about

54
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
changing the content.

55
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And one of the things I'm most proud of

56
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is this agreement for IBM.

57
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's a grid, it's a calendar.

58
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
At such and such a date, IBM has responsibilities,

59
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
you have responsibilities.

60
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Received very favorably by business.

61
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And there is some good news to report today.

62
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Each year, one in 10 taxpayers

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
receives a notice from the IRS.

64
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
There are 200 million letters that go out.

65
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Running through this typical letter that they had,

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I ran it through my simplicity lab,

67
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
it's pretty unintelligible.

68
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible.

69
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover

70
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
70 percent of their transactions in plain English.

71
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
They have been tested in the laboratory.

72
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
When I run it through my lab,

73
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
this heat-mapping shows everything

74
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
is intelligible.

75
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And the IRS has introduced the program.

76
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Applause)

77
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
There are a couple of things going on right now

78
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that I want to bring to your attention.

79
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
There is a lot of discussion now

80
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
about a consumer financial protection agency,

81
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
how to mandate simplicity.

82
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We see all this complexity.

83
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's incumbent upon us,

84
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and this organization, I believe,

85
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to make clarity, transparency

86
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and empathy a national priority.

87
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
There is no way that we should allow government

88
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to communicate the way they communicate.

89
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
There is no way we should do business

90
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
with companies that have agreements

91
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible.

92
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So, how are we going to change the world?

93
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Make clarity, transparency and simplicity a national priority.

94
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I thank you.

95
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Applause)

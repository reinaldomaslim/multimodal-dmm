1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Chris Anderson: We're having a debate.

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The debate is over the proposition:

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
"What the world needs now

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
is nuclear energy." True or false?

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And before we have the debate,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'd like to actually take a show of hands --

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
on balance, right now, are you for or against this?

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So those who are "yes," raise your hand. "For."

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Okay, hands down.

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Those who are against, raise your hands.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Okay, I'm reading that at about

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
75 to 25 in favor at the start.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Which means we're going to take a vote at the end

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and see how that shifts, if at all.

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So here's the format: They're going to have six minutes each,

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and then after one little, quick exchange between them,

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I want two people on each side of this debate in the audience

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to have 30 seconds

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to make one short, crisp, pungent, powerful point.

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So, in favor of the proposition, possibly shockingly,

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is one of, truly, the founders of the

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
environmental movement,

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
a long-standing TEDster, the founder of the Whole Earth Catalog,

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
someone we all know and love, Stewart Brand.

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Stewart Brand: Whoa.

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Applause)

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The saying is that with climate, those who know the most

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
are the most worried.

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
With nuclear, those who know the most

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
are the least worried.

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
A classic example is James Hansen,

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
a NASA climatologist

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
pushing for 350 parts per million

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
He came out with a wonderful book recently

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
called "Storms of My Grandchildren."

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And Hansen is hard over for nuclear power,

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
as are most climatologists

39
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
who are engaging this issue seriously.

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This is the design situation:

41
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
a planet that is facing climate change

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and is now half urban.

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Look at the client base for this.

44
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Five out of six of us

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
live in the developing world.

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We are moving to cities. We are moving up in the world.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And we are educating our kids,

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
having fewer kids,

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
basically good news all around.

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But we move to cities, toward the bright lights,

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and one of the things that is there that we want, besides jobs,

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is electricity.

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And if it isn't easily gotten, we'll go ahead and steal it.

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
This is one of the most desired things

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
by poor people all over the world,

56
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
in the cities and in the countryside.

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Electricity for cities, at its best,

58
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
is what's called baseload electricity.

59
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
That's where it is on

60
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
all the time.

61
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And so far there are only three major sources of that --

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
coal and gas, hydro-electric,

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
which in most places is maxed-out --

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and nuclear.

65
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I would love to have something in the fourth place here,

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
but in terms of constant, clean,

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
scalable energy,

68
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
[solar] and wind and the other renewables

69
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
aren't there yet because they're inconstant.

70
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Nuclear is and has been for 40 years.

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Now, from an environmental standpoint,

72
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
the main thing you want to look at

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is what happens to the waste from nuclear and from coal,

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the two major sources of electricity.

75
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
If all of your electricity in your lifetime came from nuclear,

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
the waste from that lifetime of electricity

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
would go in a Coke can --

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
a pretty heavy Coke can, about two pounds.

79
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But one day of coal

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
adds up to one hell of a lot

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
of carbon dioxide

82
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
in a normal one-gigawatt coal-fired plant.

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Then what happens to the waste?

84
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The nuclear waste typically goes into

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
a dry cask storage

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
out back of the parking lot at the reactor site

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
because most places don't have underground storage yet.

88
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's just as well, because it can stay where it is.

89
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
While the carbon dioxide,

90
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
vast quantities of it, gigatons,

91
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
goes into the atmosphere

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
where we can't get it back -- yet --

93
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and where it is causing the problems that we're most concerned about.

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So when you add up the greenhouse gases

95
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in the lifetime of these various energy sources,

96
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
nuclear is down there with wind and hydro,

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
below solar and way below, obviously, all the fossil fuels.

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Wind is wonderful; I love wind.

99
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I love being around these

100
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
big wind generators.

101
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But one of the things we're discovering is that

102
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
wind, like solar, is an actually relatively

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
dilute source of energy.

104
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And so it takes a very large footprint on the land,

105
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
a very large footprint in terms of materials,

106
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
five to 10 times what you'd use for nuclear,

107
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and typically to get one gigawatt of electricity

108
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is on the order of 250 square miles

109
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
of wind farm.

110
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
In places like Denmark and Germany,

111
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they've maxed out on wind already.

112
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
They've run out of good sites.

113
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The power lines are getting overloaded.

114
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And you peak out.

115
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Likewise, with solar,

116
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
especially here in California,

117
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we're discovering that the 80 solar farm

118
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
schemes that are going forward

119
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
want to basically bulldoze

120
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
1,000 square miles of southern California desert.

121
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Well, as an environmentalist, we would rather that didn't happen.

122
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It's okay on frapped-out agricultural land.

123
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Solar's wonderful on rooftops.

124
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But out in the landscape,

125
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
one gigawatt is on the order of 50 square miles

126
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
of bulldozed desert.

127
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
When you add all these things up --

128
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Saul Griffith did the numbers and figured out

129
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
what would it take

130
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to get 13 clean

131
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
terawatts of energy

132
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
from wind, solar and biofuels,

133
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and that area would be roughly the size of the United States,

134
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
an area he refers to as "Renewistan."

135
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
A guy who's added it up all this very well is David Mackay,

136
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a physicist in England,

137
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and in his wonderful book, "Sustainable Energy," among other things,

138
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
he says, "I'm not trying to be pro-nuclear. I'm just pro-arithmetic."

139
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
In terms of weapons,

141
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
the best disarmament tool so far is nuclear energy.

142
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We have been taking down

143
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the Russian warheads,

144
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
turning it into electricity.

145
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Ten percent of American electricity

146
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
comes from decommissioned warheads.

147
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We haven't even started the American stockpile.

148
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I think of most interest to a TED audience

149
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
would be the new generation of reactors

150
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that are very small,

151
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
down around 10

152
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
to 125 megawatts.

153
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
This is one from Toshiba.

154
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Here's one the Russians are already building that floats on a barge.

155
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And that would be very interesting in the developing world.

156
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Typically, these things are put in the ground.

157
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
They're referred to as nuclear batteries.

158
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
They're incredibly safe,

159
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
weapons proliferation-proof and all the rest of it.

160
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Here is a commercial version from New Mexico

161
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
called the Hyperion,

162
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and another one from Oregon called NuScale.

163
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Babcock & Wilcox that make nuclear reactors,

164
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
here's an integral fast reactor.

165
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Thorium reactor that Nathan Myhrvold's involved in.

166
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The governments of the world are going to have to decide

167
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that coals need to be made expensive, and these will go ahead.

168
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And here's the future.

169
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Applause)

170
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
CA: Okay. Okay.

171
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Applause)

172
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So arguing against,

173
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
a man who's been at the nitty, gritty heart

174
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of the energy debate and the climate change debate for years.

175
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
In 2000, he discovered that soot

176
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
was probably the second leading cause of global warming, after CO2.

177
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
His team have been making detailed calculations

178
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
of the relative impacts

179
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
of different energy sources.

180
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
His first time at TED, possibly a disadvantage -- we shall see --

181
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
from Stanford,

182
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Professor Mark Jacobson. Good luck.

183
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Mark Jacobson: Thank you.

184
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Applause)

185
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So my premise here is that nuclear energy

186
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
puts out more carbon dioxide,

187
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
puts out more air pollutants,

188
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
enhances mortality more and takes longer to put up

189
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
than real renewable energy systems,

190
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
namely wind, solar,

191
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
geothermal power, hydro-tidal wave power.

192
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And it also enhances nuclear weapons proliferation.

193
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So let's start just by looking at the

194
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
CO2 emissions from the life cycle.

195
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
CO2e emissions are equivalent emissions

196
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
of all the greenhouse gases and particles

197
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that cause warming

198
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and converted to CO2.

199
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And if you look, wind and concentrated solar

200
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
have the lowest CO2 emissions, if you look at the graph.

201
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Nuclear -- there are two bars here.

202
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
One is a low estimate, and one is a high estimate.

203
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The low estimate is the nuclear energy industry

204
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
estimate of nuclear.

205
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The high is the average of 103

206
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
scientific, peer-reviewed studies.

207
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And this is just the

208
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
CO2 from the life cycle.

209
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
If we look at the delays,

210
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
it takes between 10 and 19 years

211
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to put up a nuclear power plant

212
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
from planning to operation.

213
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
This includes about three and a half to six years

214
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
for a site permit.

215
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and another two and a half to four years

216
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
for a construction permit and issue,

217
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and then four to nine years for actual construction.

218
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And in China, right now,

219
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
they're putting up five gigawatts of nuclear.

220
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And the average, just for the construction time of these,

221
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
is 7.1 years

222
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
on top of any planning times.

223
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
While you're waiting around for your nuclear,

224
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
you have to run the regular electric power grid,

225
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
which is mostly coal in the United States and around the world.

226
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And the chart here shows the difference between

227
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the emissions from the regular grid,

228
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
resulting if you use nuclear, or anything else,

229
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
versus wind, CSP or photovoltaics.

230
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Wind takes about two to five years on average,

231
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics.

232
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So the difference is the opportunity cost

233
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
of using nuclear versus wind, or something else.

234
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So if you add these two together, alone,

235
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
you can see a separation

236
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that nuclear puts out at least nine to 17 times

237
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
more CO2 equivalent emissions than wind energy.

238
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And this doesn't even account

239
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
for the footprint on the ground.

240
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
If you look at the air pollution health effects,

241
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
this is the number of deaths per year in 2020

242
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
just from vehicle exhaust.

243
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Let's say we converted all the vehicles in the United States

244
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to battery electric vehicles, hydrogen fuel cell vehicles

245
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
or flex fuel vehicles run on E85.

246
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Well, right now in the United States,

247
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
50 to 100,000 people die per year from air pollution,

248
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and vehicles are about 25,000 of those.

249
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
In 2020, the number will go down to 15,000

250
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
due to improvements.

251
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And so, on the right, you see gasoline emissions,

252
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the death rates of 2020.

253
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
If you go to corn or cellulosic ethanol,

254
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
you'd actually increase the death rate slightly.

255
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
If you go to nuclear,

256
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
you do get a big reduction,

257
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
but it's not as much as with wind and concentrated solar.

258
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Now if you consider the fact

259
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that nuclear weapons proliferation

260
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
is associated with nuclear energy proliferation,

261
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
because we know for example,

262
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
India and Pakistan developed nuclear weapons secretly

263
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
by enriching uranium

264
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in nuclear energy facilities.

265
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
North Korea did that to some extent.

266
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
Iran is doing that right now.

267
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And Venezuela would be doing it

268
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
if they started with their nuclear energy facilities.

269
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
If you do a large scale expansion

270
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
of nuclear energy across the world,

271
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and as a result there was just one

272
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
nuclear bomb created

273
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that was used to destroy a city

274
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
such as Mumbai or some other big city, megacity,

275
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
the additional death rates due to this

276
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
averaged over 30 years and then scaled to the population of the U.S.

277
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
would be this.

278
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So, do we need this?

279
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The next thing is: What about the footprint? Stewart mentioned the footprint.

280
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Actually, the footprint on the ground for wind

281
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
is by far the smallest of any energy source in the world.

282
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
That, because the footprint, as you can see,

283
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
is just the pole touching the ground.

284
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And you can power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet

285
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
with 73,000 to 145,000

286
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
five-megawatt wind turbines.

287
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
That would take between one and three square kilometers

288
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
of footprint on the ground, entirely.

289
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The spacing is something else.

290
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
That's the footprint that is always being confused.

291
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
People confuse footprint with spacing.

292
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
As you can see from these pictures,

293
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
the spacing between can be used for multiple purposes

294
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
including agricultural land,

295
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
range land or open space.

296
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Over the ocean, it's not even land.

297
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Now if we look at nuclear -- (Laughter)

298
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
With nuclear, what do we have?

299
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
We have facilities around there. You also have a buffer zone

300
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that's 17 square kilometers.

301
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And you have the uranium mining

302
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that you have to deal with.

303
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Now if we go to the area,

304
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
lots is worse than nuclear or wind.

305
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
For example, cellulosic ethanol, to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet,

306
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
this is how much land you would need.

307
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
That's cellulosic, second generation

308
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
biofuels from prairie grass.

309
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Here's corn ethanol. It's smaller.

310
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
This is based on ranges from data,

311
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but if you look at nuclear,

312
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
it would be the size of Rhode Island to power the U.S. vehicle fleet.

313
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
For wind, there's a larger area,

314
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but much smaller footprint.

315
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And of course, with wind,

316
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
you could put it all over the East Coast,

317
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
offshore theoretically, or you can split it up.

318
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And now, if you go back to

319
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
looking at geothermal, it's even smaller than both,

320
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and solar is slightly larger than the nuclear spacing,

321
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but it's still pretty small.

322
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And this is to power the entire U.S. vehicle fleet.

323
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
To power the entire world with 50 percent wind,

324
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
you would need about one percent of world land.

325
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Matching the reliability, base load is actually irrelevant.

326
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
We want to match the hour-by-hour power supply.

327
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
You can do that by combining renewables.

328
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
This is from real data in California,

329
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
looking at wind data and solar data.

330
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And it considers just using existing hydro

331
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
to match the hour-by-hour power demand.

332
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Here are the world wind resources.

333
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
There's five to 10 times more wind available worldwide

334
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
than we need for all the world.

335
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So then here's the final ranking.

336
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And one last slide I just want to show. This is the choice:

337
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
You can either have wind or nuclear.

338
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
If you use wind,

339
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
you guarantee ice will last.

340
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Nuclear, the time lag alone

341
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
will allow the Arctic to melt and other places to melt more.

342
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And we can guarantee a clean, blue sky

343
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
or an uncertain future with nuclear power.

344
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Applause)

345
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
CA: All right.

346
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So while they're having their comebacks on each other --

347
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and yours is slightly short because you slightly overran --

348
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
I need two people from either side.

349
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So if you're for this,

350
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
if you're for nuclear power, put up two hands.

351
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
If you're against, put up one.

352
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And I want two of each for the mics.

353
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Now then, you guys have --

354
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
you have a minute comeback on him

355
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
to pick up a point he said, challenge it,

356
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
whatever.

357
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
SB: I think a point of difference we're having, Mark,

358
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
has to do with weapons

359
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and energy.

360
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
These diagrams that show that nuclear is somehow

361
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
putting out a lot of greenhouse gases --

362
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
a lot of those studies include, "Well of course war will be inevitable

363
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and therefore we'll have cities burning and stuff like that,"

364
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
which is kind of finessing it

365
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
a little bit, I think.

366
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
The reality is that there's, what,

367
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
21 nations that have nuclear power?

368
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Of those, seven have nuclear weapons.

369
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
In every case, they got the weapons

370
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
before they got the nuclear power.

371
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
There are two nations, North Korea and Israel,

372
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that have nuclear weapons

373
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and don't have nuclear power at all.

374
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
The places that we would most like to have

375
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
really clean energy occur

376
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
are China, India, Europe, North America,

377
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
all of which have sorted out their situation

378
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
in relation to nuclear weapons.

379
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So that leaves a couple of places like Iran,

380
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
maybe Venezuela,

381
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
that you would like to have very close

382
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
surveillance of anything

383
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
that goes on with fissile stuff.

384
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Pushing ahead with nuclear power will mean we

385
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
really know where all of the fissile material is,

386
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and we can move toward

387
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
zero weapons left, once we know all that.

388
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
CA: Mark,

389
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
30 seconds, either on that or on anything Stewart said.

390
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
MJ: Well we know India and Pakistan had nuclear energy first,

391
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and then they developed nuclear weapons secretly in the factories.

392
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
So the other thing is, we don't need nuclear energy.

393
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
There's plenty of solar and wind.

394
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
You can make it reliable, as I showed with that diagram.

395
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
That's from real data.

396
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And this is an ongoing research. This is not rocket science.

397
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Solving the world's problems can be done,

398
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
if you really put your mind to it and use clean, renewable energy.

399
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
There's absolutely no need for nuclear power.

400
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
(Applause)

401
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
CA: We need someone for.

402
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Rod Beckstrom: Thank you Chris. I'm Rod Beckstrom, CEO of ICANN.

403
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
I've been involved in global warming policy

404
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
since 1994,

405
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
when I joined the board of Environmental Defense Fund

406
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
that was one of the crafters of the Kyoto Protocol.

407
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And I want to support Stewart Brand's position.

408
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
I've come around in the last 10 years.

409
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I used to be against nuclear power.

410
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
I'm now supporting Stewart's position,

411
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
softly, from a risk-management standpoint,

412
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
agreeing that

413
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
the risks of overheating the planet

414
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
outweigh the risk of nuclear incident,

415
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
which certainly is possible and is a very real problem.

416
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
However, I think there may be a win-win solution here

417
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
where both parties can win this debate,

418
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and that is, we face a situation

419
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
where it's carbon caps on this planet

420
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
or die.

421
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And in the United States Senate,

422
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
we need bipartisan support --

423
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
only one or two votes are needed --

424
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
to move global warming through the Senate,

425
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and this room can help.

426
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
So if we get that through, then Mark will solve these problems. Thanks Chris.

427
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
CA: Thank you Rod Beckstrom. Against.

428
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
David Fanton: Hi, I'm David Fanton. I just want to say a couple quick things.

429
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
The first is: be aware of the propaganda.

430
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
The propaganda from the industry

431
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
has been very, very strong.

432
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
And we have not had

433
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
the other side of the argument fully aired

434
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
so that people can draw their own conclusions.

435
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Be very aware of the propaganda.

436
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Secondly, think about this.

437
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
If we build all these nuclear power plants,

438
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
all that waste

439
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
is going to be on hundreds, if not thousands,

440
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
of trucks and trains,

441
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
moving through this country every day.

442
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Tell me they're not going to have accidents.

443
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
Tell me that those accidents aren't going to

444
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
put material into the environment

445
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
that is poisonous for hundreds of thousands of years.

446
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And then tell me that each and every one of those trucks and trains

447
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
isn't a potential terrorist target.

448
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
CA: Thank you.

449
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
For.

450
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Anyone else for? Go.

451
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Alex: Hi, I'm Alex. I just wanted to say,

452
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
I'm, first of all, renewable energy's biggest fan.

453
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
I've got solar PV on my roof.

454
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
I've got a hydro conversion

455
0:18:27.26,000 --> 0:18:29,000
at a watermill that I own.

456
0:18:29.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
And I'm, you know, very much "pro" that kind of stuff.

457
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
However, there's a basic arithmetic problem here.

458
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
The capability of

459
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
the sun shining, the wind blowing and the rain falling,

460
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
simply isn't enough to add up.

461
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
So if we want to keep the lights on,

462
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
we actually need a solution

463
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
which is going to keep generating all of the time.

464
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
I campaigned against nuclear weapons in the '80s,

465
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
and I continue to do so now.

466
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:56,000
But we've got an opportunity

467
0:18:56.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
to recycle them into something more useful

468
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
that enables us to get energy all of the time.

469
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
And, ultimately, the arithmetic problem isn't going to go away.

470
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
We're not going to get enough energy from renewables alone.

471
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
We need a solution that generates all of the time.

472
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
If we're going to keep the lights on,

473
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
nuclear is that solution.

474
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
CA: Thank you.

475
0:19:16.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
Anyone else against?

476
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Man: The last person who was in favor made the premise

477
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
that we don't have enough

478
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
alternative renewable resources.

479
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
And our "against" proponent up here

480
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
made it very clear that we actually do.

481
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
And so the fallacy

482
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
that we need this resource

483
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:35,000
and we can actually make it in a time frame

484
0:19:35.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
that is meaningful is not possible.

485
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
I will also add one other thing.

486
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
Ray Kurzweil and all the other talks --

487
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
we know that the stick is going up exponentially.

488
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:46,000
So you can't look at state-of-the-art technologies in renewables

489
0:19:46.26,000 --> 0:19:48,000
and say, "That's all we have."

490
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
Because five years from now, it will blow you away

491
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
what we'll actually have as alternatives

492
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:54,000
to this horrible, disastrous nuclear power.

493
0:19:54.26,000 --> 0:19:56,000
CA: Point well made. Thank you.

494
0:19:56.26,000 --> 0:19:59,000
(Applause)

495
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:01,000
So each of you has really just a couple sentences --

496
0:20:01.26,000 --> 0:20:03,000
30 seconds each

497
0:20:03.26,000 --> 0:20:05,000
to sum up.

498
0:20:06.26,000 --> 0:20:08,000
Your final pitch, Stewart.

499
0:20:08.26,000 --> 0:20:11,000
SB: I loved your "It all balances out" chart

500
0:20:11.26,000 --> 0:20:13,000
that you had there.

501
0:20:13.26,000 --> 0:20:15,000
It was a sunny day and a windy night.

502
0:20:16.26,000 --> 0:20:18,000
And just now in England

503
0:20:18.26,000 --> 0:20:2,000
they had a cold spell.

504
0:20:20.26,000 --> 0:20:22,000
All of the wind in the entire country

505
0:20:22.26,000 --> 0:20:24,000
shut down for a week.

506
0:20:24.26,000 --> 0:20:26,000
None of those things were stirring.

507
0:20:26.26,000 --> 0:20:28,000
And as usual, they had to buy nuclear power from France.

508
0:20:28.26,000 --> 0:20:3,000
Two gigawatts comes through the Chunnel.

509
0:20:30.26,000 --> 0:20:32,000
This keeps happening.

510
0:20:32.26,000 --> 0:20:35,000
I used to worry about the 10,000 year factor.

511
0:20:36.26,000 --> 0:20:39,000
And the fact is, we're going to use the nuclear waste we have for fuel

512
0:20:39.26,000 --> 0:20:42,000
in the fourth generation of reactors that are coming along.

513
0:20:42.26,000 --> 0:20:45,000
And especially the small reactors need to go forward.

514
0:20:45.26,000 --> 0:20:48,000
I heard from Nathan Myhrvold -- and I think here's the action point --

515
0:20:48.26,000 --> 0:20:5,000
it'll take an act of Congress

516
0:20:50.26,000 --> 0:20:52,000
to make the Nuclear Regulatory Commission

517
0:20:52.26,000 --> 0:20:54,000
start moving quickly on these small reactors,

518
0:20:54.26,000 --> 0:20:57,000
which we need very much, here and in the world.

519
0:20:58.26,000 --> 0:21:04,000
(Applause)

520
0:21:04.26,000 --> 0:21:06,000
MJ: So we've analyzed the hour-by-hour

521
0:21:06.26,000 --> 0:21:08,000
power demand and supply,

522
0:21:08.26,000 --> 0:21:11,000
looking at solar, wind, using data for California.

523
0:21:11.26,000 --> 0:21:14,000
And you can match that demand, hour-by-hour,

524
0:21:14.26,000 --> 0:21:16,000
for the whole year almost.

525
0:21:16.26,000 --> 0:21:18,000
Now, with regard to the resources,

526
0:21:18.26,000 --> 0:21:2,000
we've developed the first wind map of the world,

527
0:21:20.26,000 --> 0:21:22,000
from data alone, at 80 meters.

528
0:21:22.26,000 --> 0:21:25,000
We know what the wind resources are. You can cover 15 percent.

529
0:21:25.26,000 --> 0:21:27,000
Fifteen percent of the entire U.S.

530
0:21:27.26,000 --> 0:21:3,000
has wind at fast enough speeds to be cost-competitive.

531
0:21:30.26,000 --> 0:21:32,000
And there's much more solar than there is wind.

532
0:21:32.26,000 --> 0:21:35,000
There's plenty of resource. You can make it reliable.

533
0:21:35.26,000 --> 0:21:38,000
CA: Okay. So, thank you, Mark.

534
0:21:38.26,000 --> 0:21:42,000
(Applause)

535
0:21:42.26,000 --> 0:21:45,000
So if you were in Palm Springs ...

536
0:21:45.26,000 --> 0:21:5,000
(Laughter)

537
0:21:50.26,000 --> 0:21:52,000
(Applause)

538
0:21:52.26,000 --> 0:21:55,000
Shameless. Shameless. Shameless.

539
0:21:55.26,000 --> 0:21:57,000
(Applause)

540
0:21:57.26,000 --> 0:22:,000
So, people of the TED community,

541
0:22:00.26,000 --> 0:22:02,000
I put it to you that what the world needs now

542
0:22:02.26,000 --> 0:22:04,000
is nuclear energy.

543
0:22:04.26,000 --> 0:22:07,000
All those in favor, raise your hands.

544
0:22:07.26,000 --> 0:22:1,000
(Shouts)

545
0:22:10.26,000 --> 0:22:12,000
And all those against.

546
0:22:13.26,000 --> 0:22:15,000
Ooooh.

547
0:22:15.26,000 --> 0:22:17,000
Now that is -- my take on that ...

548
0:22:17.26,000 --> 0:22:2,000
Just put up ... Hands up, people who changed their minds during the debate,

549
0:22:20.26,000 --> 0:22:22,000
who voted differently.

550
0:22:22.26,000 --> 0:22:25,000
Those of you who changed your mind

551
0:22:25.26,000 --> 0:22:27,000
in favor of "for"

552
0:22:27.26,000 --> 0:22:29,000
put your hands up.

553
0:22:29.26,000 --> 0:22:32,000
Okay. So here's the read on it.

554
0:22:32.26,000 --> 0:22:34,000
Both people won supporters,

555
0:22:34.26,000 --> 0:22:37,000
but on my count,

556
0:22:37.26,000 --> 0:22:39,000
the mood of the TED community shifted

557
0:22:39.26,000 --> 0:22:41,000
from about 75 to 25

558
0:22:41.26,000 --> 0:22:43,000
to about 65 to 35

559
0:22:43.26,000 --> 0:22:45,000
in favor, in favor.

560
0:22:45.26,000 --> 0:22:47,000
You both won. I congratulate both of you.

561
0:22:47.26,000 --> 0:22:49,000
Thank you for that.

562
0:22:49.26,000 --> 0:22:52,000
(Applause)

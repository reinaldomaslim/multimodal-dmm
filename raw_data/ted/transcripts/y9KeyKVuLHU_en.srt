1
0:00:12.999,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Have you ever wondered what animals think and feel?

2
0:00:17.02,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Let's start with a question:

3
0:00:19.654,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Does my dog really love me, or does she just want a treat?

4
0:00:24.991,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Well, it's easy to see that our dog really loves us,

5
0:00:29.982,000 --> 0:00:31,000
easy to see, right,

6
0:00:32.087,000 --> 0:00:35,000
what's going on in that fuzzy little head.

7
0:00:36.593,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What is going on?

8
0:00:39.155,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Something's going on.

9
0:00:41.864,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But why is the question always do they love us?

10
0:00:46.287,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Why is it always about us?

11
0:00:48.422,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Why are we such narcissists?

12
0:00:52.674,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I found a different question to ask animals.

13
0:00:57.911,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Who are you?

14
0:01:01.91,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There are capacities of the human mind

15
0:01:04.829,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that we tend to think are capacities only of the human mind.

16
0:01:10.176,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But is that true?

17
0:01:12.047,000 --> 0:01:15,000
What are other beings doing with those brains?

18
0:01:16.554,000 --> 0:01:18,000
What are they thinking and feeling?

19
0:01:19.57,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Is there a way to know?

20
0:01:21.227,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I think there is a way in.

21
0:01:22.925,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I think there are several ways in.

22
0:01:24.95,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We can look at evolution, we can look at their brains

23
0:01:29.096,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and we can watch what they do.

24
0:01:33.316,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The first thing to remember is: our brain is inherited.

25
0:01:38.253,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The first neurons came from jellyfish.

26
0:01:42.435,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Jellyfish gave rise to the first chordates.

27
0:01:45.299,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The first chordates gave rise to the first vertebrates.

28
0:01:49.277,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The vertebrates came out of the sea,

29
0:01:51.719,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and here we are.

30
0:01:54.737,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But it's still true that a neuron, a nerve cell, looks the same

31
0:02:00.351,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in a crayfish, a bird or you.

32
0:02:04.427,000 --> 0:02:07,000
What does that say about the minds of crayfish?

33
0:02:08.88,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Can we tell anything about that?

34
0:02:10.461,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Well, it turns out that if you give a crayfish

35
0:02:14.514,000 --> 0:02:16,000
a lot of little tiny electric shocks

36
0:02:17.195,000 --> 0:02:19,000
every time it tries to come out of its burrow,

37
0:02:19.515,000 --> 0:02:21,000
it will develop anxiety.

38
0:02:23.133,000 --> 0:02:26,000
If you give the crayfish the same drug

39
0:02:26.575,000 --> 0:02:28,000
used to treat anxiety disorder in humans,

40
0:02:29.522,000 --> 0:02:32,000
it relaxes and comes out and explores.

41
0:02:34.308,000 --> 0:02:37,000
How do we show how much we care about crayfish anxiety?

42
0:02:37.905,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Mostly, we boil them.

43
0:02:39.283,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:42.49,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Octopuses use tools, as well as do most apes

45
0:02:47.872,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and they recognize human faces.

46
0:02:50.808,000 --> 0:02:54,000
How do we celebrate the ape-like intelligence of this invertebrate?

47
0:02:55.999,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Mostly boiled.

48
0:02:58.669,000 --> 0:03:02,000
If a grouper chases a fish into a crevice in the coral,

49
0:03:02.999,000 --> 0:03:06,000
it will sometimes go to where it knows a moray eel is sleeping

50
0:03:07.999,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and it will signal to the moray, "Follow me,"

51
0:03:11.596,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and the moray will understand that signal.

52
0:03:14.816,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The moray may go into the crevice and get the fish,

53
0:03:17.817,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but the fish may bolt and the grouper may get it.

54
0:03:20.88,000 --> 0:03:26,000
This is an ancient partnership that we have just recently found out about.

55
0:03:26.935,000 --> 0:03:29,000
How do we celebrate that ancient partnership?

56
0:03:30.044,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Mostly fried.

57
0:03:32.918,000 --> 0:03:35,000
A pattern is emerging and it says a lot more about us

58
0:03:36.542,000 --> 0:03:38,000
than it does about them.

59
0:03:39.61,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Sea otters use tools

60
0:03:42.039,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and they take time away from what they're doing

61
0:03:45.04,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to show their babies what to do, which is called teaching.

62
0:03:49.205,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Chimpanzees don't teach.

63
0:03:52.999,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Killer whales teach and killer whales share food.

64
0:03:58.879,000 --> 0:04:,000
When evolution makes something new,

65
0:04:00.937,000 --> 0:04:04,000
it uses the parts it has in stock, off the shelf,

66
0:04:05.314,000 --> 0:04:07,000
before it fabricates a new twist.

67
0:04:07.8,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And our brain has come to us

68
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:14,000
through the enormity of the deep sweep of time.

69
0:04:14.425,000 --> 0:04:17,000
If you look at the human brain compared to a chimpanzee brain,

70
0:04:18.038,000 --> 0:04:21,000
what you see is we have basically a very big chimpanzee brain.

71
0:04:21.726,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's a good thing ours is bigger, because we're also really insecure.

72
0:04:25.691,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

73
0:04:27.777,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But, uh oh, there's a dolphin,

74
0:04:30.917,000 --> 0:04:32,000
a bigger brain with more convolutions.

75
0:04:34.777,000 --> 0:04:36,000
OK, maybe you're saying, all right, well, we see brains,

76
0:04:37.508,000 --> 0:04:39,000
but what does that have to say about minds?

77
0:04:40.347,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Well, we can see the working of the mind

78
0:04:44.242,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in the logic of behaviors.

79
0:04:46.53,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So these elephants, you can see,

80
0:04:50.185,000 --> 0:04:52,000
obviously, they are resting.

81
0:04:53.118,000 --> 0:04:57,000
They have found a patch of shade under the palm trees

82
0:04:57.506,000 --> 0:04:59,000
under which to let their babies sleep,

83
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
while they doze but remain vigilant.

84
0:05:03.491,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We make perfect sense of that image

85
0:05:06.367,000 --> 0:05:09,000
just as they make perfect sense of what they're doing

86
0:05:10.022,000 --> 0:05:13,000
because under the arc of the same sun on the same plains,

87
0:05:13.848,000 --> 0:05:16,000
listening to the howls of the same dangers,

88
0:05:17.298,000 --> 0:05:21,000
they became who they are and we became who we are.

89
0:05:22.536,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We've been neighbors for a very long time.

90
0:05:24.736,000 --> 0:05:27,000
No one would mistake these elephants as being relaxed.

91
0:05:28.204,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They're obviously very concerned about something.

92
0:05:31.14,000 --> 0:05:32,000
What are they concerned about?

93
0:05:33.68,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It turns out that if you record the voices of tourists

94
0:05:37.344,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and you play that recording from a speaker hidden in bushes,

95
0:05:42.062,000 --> 0:05:45,000
elephants will ignore it, because tourists never bother elephants.

96
0:05:46.102,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But if you record the voices of herders

97
0:05:50.868,000 --> 0:05:55,000
who carry spears and often hurt elephants in confrontations at water holes,

98
0:05:55.981,000 --> 0:05:59,000
the elephants will bunch up and run away from the hidden speaker.

99
0:06:00.699,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Not only do elephants know that there are humans,

100
0:06:04.082,000 --> 0:06:06,000
they know that there are different kinds of humans,

101
0:06:06.642,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and that some are OK and some are dangerous.

102
0:06:10.248,000 --> 0:06:15,000
They have been watching us for much longer than we have been watching them.

103
0:06:15.339,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They know us better than we know them.

104
0:06:18.272,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We have the same imperatives:

105
0:06:21.144,000 --> 0:06:25,000
take care of our babies, find food, try to stay alive.

106
0:06:26.478,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Whether we're outfitted for hiking in the hills of Africa

107
0:06:30.331,000 --> 0:06:34,000
or outfitted for diving under the sea, we are basically the same.

108
0:06:34.538,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We are kin under the skin.

109
0:06:36.999,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The elephant has the same skeleton,

110
0:06:39.426,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the killer whale has the same skeleton,

111
0:06:41.792,000 --> 0:06:42,000
as do we.

112
0:06:45.674,000 --> 0:06:47,000
We see helping where help is needed.

113
0:06:48.56,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We see curiosity in the young.

114
0:06:52.467,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We see the bonds of family connections.

115
0:06:57.776,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We recognize affection.

116
0:07:00.522,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Courtship is courtship.

117
0:07:03.999,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And then we ask, "Are they conscious?"

118
0:07:07.3,000 --> 0:07:09,000
When you get general anesthesia, it makes you unconscious,

119
0:07:10.224,000 --> 0:07:12,000
which means you have no sensation of anything.

120
0:07:13.083,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Consciousness is simply the thing that feels like something.

121
0:07:17.292,000 --> 0:07:21,000
If you see, if you hear, if you feel, if you're aware of anything,

122
0:07:21.465,000 --> 0:07:24,000
you are conscious, and they are conscious.

123
0:07:27.165,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Some people say

124
0:07:28.355,000 --> 0:07:3,000
well, there are certain things that make humans humans,

125
0:07:30.984,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and one of those things is empathy.

126
0:07:32.93,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Empathy is the mind's ability to match moods with your companions.

127
0:07:39.442,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's a very useful thing.

128
0:07:41.049,000 --> 0:07:43,000
If your companions start to move quickly,

129
0:07:43.233,000 --> 0:07:45,000
you have to feel like you need to hurry up.

130
0:07:45.492,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We're all in a hurry now.

131
0:07:47.246,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The oldest form of empathy is contagious fear.

132
0:07:50.757,000 --> 0:07:52,000
If your companions suddenly startle and fly away,

133
0:07:53.627,000 --> 0:07:55,000
it does not work very well for you to say,

134
0:07:55.815,000 --> 0:07:57,000
"Jeez, I wonder why everybody just left."

135
0:07:58.742,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Laughter)

136
0:08:03.136,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Empathy is old, but empathy, like everything else in life,

137
0:08:06.999,000 --> 0:08:09,000
comes on a sliding scale and has its elaboration.

138
0:08:10.934,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So there's basic empathy: you feel sad, it makes me sad.

139
0:08:14.679,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I see you happy, it makes me happy.

140
0:08:17.192,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Then there's something that I call sympathy,

141
0:08:19.999,000 --> 0:08:2,000
a little more removed:

142
0:08:22.365,000 --> 0:08:25,000
"I'm sorry to hear that your grandmother has just passed away.

143
0:08:25.856,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I don't feel that same grief, but I get it; I know what you feel

144
0:08:29.507,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and it concerns me."

145
0:08:30.944,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And then if we're motivated to act on sympathy,

146
0:08:33.585,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I call that compassion.

147
0:08:36.061,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Far from being the thing that makes us human,

148
0:08:39.635,000 --> 0:08:42,000
human empathy is far from perfect.

149
0:08:42.999,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We round up empathic creatures, we kill them and we eat them.

150
0:08:48.034,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Now, maybe you say OK, well, those are different species.

151
0:08:50.925,000 --> 0:08:53,000
That's just predation, and humans are predators.

152
0:08:54.667,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But we don't treat our own kind too well either.

153
0:09:01.212,000 --> 0:09:04,000
People who seem to know only one thing about animal behavior

154
0:09:04.39,000 --> 0:09:07,000
know that you must never attribute human thoughts and emotions

155
0:09:08.387,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to other species.

156
0:09:10.723,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Well, I think that's silly,

157
0:09:12.568,000 --> 0:09:16,000
because attributing human thoughts and emotions to other species

158
0:09:16.714,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is the best first guess about what they're doing and how they're feeling,

159
0:09:20.989,000 --> 0:09:23,000
because their brains are basically the same as ours.

160
0:09:24.326,000 --> 0:09:25,000
They have the same structures.

161
0:09:26.081,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The same hormones that create mood and motivation in us

162
0:09:31.155,000 --> 0:09:33,000
are in those brains as well.

163
0:09:35.05,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It is not scientific to say that they are hungry when they're hunting

164
0:09:40.144,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and they're tired when their tongues are hanging out,

165
0:09:43.115,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and then say when they're playing with their children

166
0:09:45.829,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and acting joyful and happy,

167
0:09:47.764,000 --> 0:09:51,000
we have no idea if they can possibly be experiencing anything.

168
0:09:52.577,000 --> 0:09:53,000
That is not scientific.

169
0:09:55.619,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So OK, so a reporter said to me,

170
0:09:58.328,000 --> 0:10:02,000
"Maybe, but how do you really know that other animals can think and feel?"

171
0:10:02.66,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And I started to rifle through all the hundreds

172
0:10:05.739,000 --> 0:10:07,000
of scientific references that I put in my book

173
0:10:08.262,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and I realized that the answer was right in the room with me.

174
0:10:11.526,000 --> 0:10:14,000
When my dog gets off the rug and comes over to me --

175
0:10:15.303,000 --> 0:10:16,000
not to the couch, to me --

176
0:10:17.089,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and she rolls over on her back and exposes her belly,

177
0:10:21.29,000 --> 0:10:23,000
she has had the thought, "I would like my belly rubbed.

178
0:10:26.565,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I know that I can go over to Carl,

179
0:10:29.125,000 --> 0:10:31,000
he will understand what I'm asking.

180
0:10:32.084,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I know I can trust him because we're family.

181
0:10:35.406,000 --> 0:10:37,000
He'll get the job done, and it will feel good."

182
0:10:38.145,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Laughter)

183
0:10:40.055,000 --> 0:10:43,000
She has thought and she has felt,

184
0:10:43.408,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and it's really not more complicated than that.

185
0:10:46.096,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But we see other animals and we say, "Oh look, killer whales,

186
0:10:50.733,000 --> 0:10:52,000
wolves, elephants:

187
0:10:53.167,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that's not how they see it."

188
0:10:55.714,000 --> 0:10:59,000
That tall-finned male is L41.

189
0:11:00.032,000 --> 0:11:02,000
He's 38 years old.

190
0:11:02.103,000 --> 0:11:05,000
The female right on his left side is L22.

191
0:11:05.899,000 --> 0:11:06,000
She's 44.

192
0:11:07.475,000 --> 0:11:09,000
They've known each other for decades.

193
0:11:10.65,000 --> 0:11:11,000
They know exactly who they are.

194
0:11:12.646,000 --> 0:11:13,000
They know who their friends are.

195
0:11:14.221,000 --> 0:11:15,000
They know who their rivals are.

196
0:11:15.943,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Their life follows the arc of a career.

197
0:11:18.802,000 --> 0:11:2,000
They know where they are all the time.

198
0:11:22.863,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This is an elephant named Philo.

199
0:11:25.667,000 --> 0:11:26,000
He was a young male.

200
0:11:27.519,000 --> 0:11:28,000
This is him four days later.

201
0:11:30.999,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Humans not only can feel grief, we create an awful lot of it.

202
0:11:38.648,000 --> 0:11:4,000
We want to carve their teeth.

203
0:11:42.153,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Why can't we wait for them to die?

204
0:11:47.998,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Elephants once ranged from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea

205
0:11:51.49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
all the way down to the Cape of Good Hope.

206
0:11:53.589,000 --> 0:11:56,000
In 1980, there were vast strongholds of elephant range

207
0:11:56.999,000 --> 0:11:58,000
in Central and Eastern Africa.

208
0:11:59.211,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And now their range is shattered into little shards.

209
0:12:03.572,000 --> 0:12:07,000
This is the geography of an animal that we are driving to extinction,

210
0:12:08.275,000 --> 0:12:11,000
a fellow being, the most magnificent creature on land.

211
0:12:13.288,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Of course, we take much better care of our wildlife in the United States.

212
0:12:17.681,000 --> 0:12:21,000
In Yellowstone National Park, we killed every single wolf.

213
0:12:21.94,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We killed every single wolf south of the Canadian border, actually.

214
0:12:25.413,000 --> 0:12:29,000
But in the park, park rangers did that in the 1920s,

215
0:12:29.83,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and then 60 years later they had to bring them back,

216
0:12:32.445,000 --> 0:12:34,000
because the elk numbers had gotten out of control.

217
0:12:36.511,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And then people came.

218
0:12:37.809,000 --> 0:12:4,000
People came by the thousands to see the wolves,

219
0:12:41.557,000 --> 0:12:44,000
the most accessibly visible wolves in the world.

220
0:12:45.512,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And I went there and I watched this incredible family of wolves.

221
0:12:48.788,000 --> 0:12:49,000
A pack is a family.

222
0:12:50.265,000 --> 0:12:53,000
It has some breeding adults and the young of several generations.

223
0:12:55.158,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And I watched the most famous, most stable pack in Yellowstone National Park.

224
0:13:00.37,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And then, when they wandered just outside the border,

225
0:13:03.524,000 --> 0:13:05,000
two of their adults were killed,

226
0:13:06.229,000 --> 0:13:08,000
including the mother,

227
0:13:08.506,000 --> 0:13:1,000
which we sometimes call the alpha female.

228
0:13:11.502,000 --> 0:13:15,000
The rest of the family immediately descended into sibling rivalry.

229
0:13:16.871,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Sisters kicked out other sisters.

230
0:13:19.565,000 --> 0:13:22,000
That one on the left tried for days to rejoin her family.

231
0:13:23.07,000 --> 0:13:25,000
They wouldn't let her because they were jealous of her.

232
0:13:25.786,000 --> 0:13:27,000
She was getting too much attention from two new males,

233
0:13:28.623,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and she was the precocious one.

234
0:13:30.665,000 --> 0:13:31,000
That was too much for them.

235
0:13:32.342,000 --> 0:13:34,000
She wound up wandering outside the park and getting shot.

236
0:13:36.463,000 --> 0:13:39,000
The alpha male wound up being ejected from his own family.

237
0:13:40.436,000 --> 0:13:42,000
As winter was coming in,

238
0:13:42.463,000 --> 0:13:45,000
he lost his territory, his hunting support,

239
0:13:46.237,000 --> 0:13:48,000
the members of his family and his mate.

240
0:13:50.883,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We cause so much pain to them.

241
0:13:55.665,000 --> 0:13:59,000
The mystery is, why don't they hurt us more than they do?

242
0:14:01.855,000 --> 0:14:04,000
This whale had just finished eating part of a grey whale

243
0:14:05.077,000 --> 0:14:07,000
with his companions who had killed that whale.

244
0:14:07.68,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Those people in the boat had nothing at all to fear.

245
0:14:11.999,000 --> 0:14:12,000
This whale is T20.

246
0:14:14.488,000 --> 0:14:18,000
He had just finished tearing a seal into three pieces with two companions.

247
0:14:19.168,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The seal weighed about as much as the people in the boat.

248
0:14:21.884,000 --> 0:14:22,000
They had nothing to fear.

249
0:14:24.189,000 --> 0:14:25,000
They eat seals.

250
0:14:26.699,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Why don't they eat us?

251
0:14:30.823,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Why can we trust them around our toddlers?

252
0:14:36.488,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Why is it that killer whales have returned to researchers lost in thick fog

253
0:14:42.414,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and led them miles until the fog parted

254
0:14:45.768,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and the researchers' home was right there on the shoreline?

255
0:14:48.957,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And that's happened more than one time.

256
0:14:53.171,000 --> 0:14:55,000
In the Bahamas, there's a woman named Denise Herzing,

257
0:14:55.77,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and she studies spotted dolphins and they know her.

258
0:14:59.118,000 --> 0:15:01,000
She knows them very well. She knows who they all are.

259
0:15:01.74,000 --> 0:15:03,000
They know her. They recognize the research boat.

260
0:15:04.026,000 --> 0:15:06,000
When she shows up, it's a big happy reunion.

261
0:15:06.28,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Except, one time showed up and they didn't want to come near the boat,

262
0:15:09.619,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and that was really strange.

263
0:15:11.717,000 --> 0:15:13,000
And they couldn't figure out what was going on

264
0:15:13.905,000 --> 0:15:14,000
until somebody came out on deck

265
0:15:15.429,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and announced that one of the people onboard had died

266
0:15:18.088,000 --> 0:15:19,000
during a nap in his bunk.

267
0:15:20.74,000 --> 0:15:23,000
How could dolphins know that one of the human hearts

268
0:15:24.69,000 --> 0:15:25,000
had just stopped?

269
0:15:26.818,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Why would they care?

270
0:15:29.132,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And why would it spook them?

271
0:15:33.111,000 --> 0:15:38,000
These mysterious things just hint at all of the things that are going on

272
0:15:38.434,000 --> 0:15:4,000
in the minds that are with us on Earth

273
0:15:41.2,000 --> 0:15:45,000
that we almost never think about at all.

274
0:15:46.258,000 --> 0:15:48,000
At an aquarium in South Africa

275
0:15:48.454,000 --> 0:15:51,000
was a little baby bottle-nosed dolphin named Dolly.

276
0:15:52.178,000 --> 0:15:58,000
She was nursing, and one day a keeper took a cigarette break

277
0:15:58.346,000 --> 0:16:02,000
and he was looking into the window into their pool, smoking.

278
0:16:02.477,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Dolly came over and looked at him,

279
0:16:04.875,000 --> 0:16:07,000
went back to her mother, nursed for a minute or two,

280
0:16:08.777,000 --> 0:16:09,000
came back to the window

281
0:16:10.604,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and released a cloud of milk that enveloped her head like smoke.

282
0:16:16.293,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Somehow, this baby bottle-nosed dolphin

283
0:16:19.423,000 --> 0:16:23,000
got the idea of using milk to represent smoke.

284
0:16:24.211,000 --> 0:16:27,000
When human beings use one thing to represent another,

285
0:16:27.583,000 --> 0:16:29,000
we call that art.

286
0:16:29.632,000 --> 0:16:31,000
(Laughter)

287
0:16:31.679,000 --> 0:16:32,000
The things that make us human

288
0:16:33.234,000 --> 0:16:36,000
are not the things that we think make us human.

289
0:16:36.781,000 --> 0:16:38,000
What makes us human is that,

290
0:16:39.129,000 --> 0:16:42,000
of all these things that our minds and their minds have,

291
0:16:42.289,000 --> 0:16:44,000
we are the most extreme.

292
0:16:46.347,000 --> 0:16:48,000
We are the most compassionate,

293
0:16:48.66,000 --> 0:16:51,000
most violent, most creative

294
0:16:51.701,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and most destructive animal that has ever been on this planet,

295
0:16:56.385,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and we are all of those things all jumbled up together.

296
0:17:01.341,000 --> 0:17:05,000
But love is not the thing that makes us human.

297
0:17:06.242,000 --> 0:17:08,000
It's not special to us.

298
0:17:09.674,000 --> 0:17:12,000
We are not the only ones who care about our mates.

299
0:17:13.669,000 --> 0:17:16,000
We are not the only ones who care about our children.

300
0:17:18.904,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Albatrosses frequently fly six, sometimes ten thousand miles

301
0:17:23.898,000 --> 0:17:27,000
over several weeks to deliver one meal, one big meal,

302
0:17:28.409,000 --> 0:17:29,000
to their chick who is waiting for them.

303
0:17:30.835,000 --> 0:17:34,000
They nest on the most remote islands in the oceans of the world,

304
0:17:35.257,000 --> 0:17:37,000
and this is what it looks like.

305
0:17:39.37,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Passing life from one generation to the next is the chain of being.

306
0:17:43.574,000 --> 0:17:45,000
If that stops, it all goes away.

307
0:17:46.975,000 --> 0:17:5,000
If anything is sacred, that is, and into that sacred relationship

308
0:17:51.649,000 --> 0:17:53,000
comes our plastic trash.

309
0:17:54.504,000 --> 0:17:56,000
All of these birds have plastic in them now.

310
0:17:57.99,000 --> 0:18:01,000
This is an albatross six months old, ready to fledge --

311
0:18:02.665,000 --> 0:18:06,000
died, packed with red cigarette lighters.

312
0:18:06.69,000 --> 0:18:09,000
This is not the relationship we are supposed to have

313
0:18:09.999,000 --> 0:18:1,000
with the rest of the world.

314
0:18:11.609,000 --> 0:18:14,000
But we, who have named ourselves after our brains,

315
0:18:16.195,000 --> 0:18:19,000
never think about the consequences.

316
0:18:21.041,000 --> 0:18:24,000
When we welcome new human life into the world,

317
0:18:24.185,000 --> 0:18:28,000
we welcome our babies into the company of other creatures.

318
0:18:28.712,000 --> 0:18:3,000
We paint animals on the walls.

319
0:18:30.829,000 --> 0:18:31,000
We don't paint cell phones.

320
0:18:32.681,000 --> 0:18:34,000
We don't paint work cubicles.

321
0:18:34.848,000 --> 0:18:37,000
We paint animals to show them that we are not alone.

322
0:18:39.316,000 --> 0:18:4,000
We have company.

323
0:18:42.527,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And every one of those animals in every painting of Noah's ark,

324
0:18:47.291,000 --> 0:18:51,000
deemed worthy of salvation is in mortal danger now,

325
0:18:51.655,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and their flood is us.

326
0:18:55.704,000 --> 0:18:57,000
So we started with a question:

327
0:18:58.027,000 --> 0:18:59,000
Do they love us?

328
0:19:01.999,000 --> 0:19:03,000
We're going to ask another question.

329
0:19:04.999,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Are we capable of using what we have

330
0:19:09.918,000 --> 0:19:13,000
to care enough to simply let them continue?

331
0:19:16.725,000 --> 0:19:17,000
Thank you very much.

332
0:19:18.09,000 --> 0:19:23,000
(Applause)

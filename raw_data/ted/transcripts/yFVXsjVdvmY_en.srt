0:00:12.507,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Today I want to talk to you about the mathematics of love.

2
0:00:17.2,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Now, I think that we can all agree

3
0:00:18.853,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that mathematicians are famously excellent at finding love.

4
0:00:22.479,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:23.906,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But it's not just because of our dashing personalities,

6
0:00:26.897,000 --> 0:00:3,000
superior conversational skills and excellent pencil cases.

7
0:00:32.083,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It's also because we've actually done an awful lot of work into the maths

8
0:00:35.85,000 --> 0:00:37,000
of how to find the perfect partner.

9
0:00:38.35,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now, in my favorite paper on the subject, which is entitled,

10
0:00:42.053,000 --> 0:00:43,000
"Why I Don't Have a Girlfriend" --

11
0:00:43.94,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:45.371,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Peter Backus tries to rate his chances of finding love.

13
0:00:49.013,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now, Peter's not a very greedy man.

14
0:00:51.266,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Of all of the available women in the UK,

15
0:00:53.542,000 --> 0:00:56,000
all Peter's looking for is somebody who lives near him,

16
0:00:57.061,000 --> 0:00:58,000
somebody in the right age range,

17
0:00:58.891,000 --> 0:01:,000
somebody with a university degree,

18
0:01:01.837,000 --> 0:01:02,000
somebody he's likely to get on well with,

19
0:01:03.843,000 --> 0:01:04,000
somebody who's likely to be attractive,

20
0:01:05.81,000 --> 0:01:07,000
somebody who's likely to find him attractive.

21
0:01:08.14,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:11.218,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And comes up with an estimate of 26 women in the whole of the UK.

23
0:01:16.032,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:17.235,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It's not looking very good, is it Peter?

25
0:01:19.292,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Now, just to put that into perspective,

26
0:01:21.27,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that's about 400 times fewer than the best estimates

27
0:01:24.574,000 --> 0:01:27,000
of how many intelligent extraterrestrial life forms there are.

28
0:01:28.299,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And it also gives Peter a 1 in 285,000 chance

29
0:01:33.617,000 --> 0:01:35,000
of bumping into any one of these special ladies

30
0:01:35.902,000 --> 0:01:36,000
on a given night out.

31
0:01:37.465,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I'd like to think that's why mathematicians

32
0:01:39.491,000 --> 0:01:41,000
don't really bother going on nights out anymore.

33
0:01:43.109,000 --> 0:01:45,000
The thing is that I personally don't subscribe

34
0:01:45.389,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to such a pessimistic view.

35
0:01:47.069,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Because I know, just as well as all of you do,

36
0:01:49.682,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that love doesn't really work like that.

37
0:01:52.078,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Human emotion isn't neatly ordered and rational and easily predictable.

38
0:01:57.396,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But I also know that that doesn't mean

39
0:01:59.641,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that mathematics hasn't got something that it can offer us,

40
0:02:02.945,000 --> 0:02:05,000
because, love, as with most of life, is full of patterns

41
0:02:06.715,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and mathematics is, ultimately, all about the study of patterns.

42
0:02:11.165,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Patterns from predicting the weather to the fluctuations in the stock market,

43
0:02:15.533,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to the movement of the planets or the growth of cities.

44
0:02:18.588,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And if we're being honest, none of those things

45
0:02:20.902,000 --> 0:02:23,000
are exactly neatly ordered and easily predictable, either.

46
0:02:24.966,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Because I believe that mathematics is so powerful that it has the potential

47
0:02:30.168,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to offer us a new way of looking at almost anything.

48
0:02:33.513,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Even something as mysterious as love.

49
0:02:36.979,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And so, to try to persuade you

50
0:02:38.675,000 --> 0:02:42,000
of how totally amazing, excellent and relevant mathematics is,

51
0:02:43.392,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I want to give you my top three mathematically verifiable tips for love.

52
0:02:50.651,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:52.44,000 --> 0:02:53,000
OK, so Top Tip #1:

54
0:02:54.104,000 --> 0:02:56,000
How to win at online dating.

55
0:02:58.567,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So my favorite online dating website is OkCupid,

56
0:03:01.962,000 --> 0:03:04,000
not least because it was started by a group of mathematicians.

57
0:03:05.574,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now, because they're mathematicians,

58
0:03:07.343,000 --> 0:03:08,000
they have been collecting data

59
0:03:08.844,000 --> 0:03:11,000
on everybody who uses their site for almost a decade.

60
0:03:12.364,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And they've been trying to search for patterns

61
0:03:14.538,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in the way that we talk about ourselves

62
0:03:16.425,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and the way that we interact with each other

63
0:03:18.508,000 --> 0:03:19,000
on an online dating website.

64
0:03:19.876,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And they've come up with some seriously interesting findings.

65
0:03:22.825,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But my particular favorite

66
0:03:24.447,000 --> 0:03:27,000
is that it turns out that on an online dating website,

67
0:03:27.827,000 --> 0:03:32,000
how attractive you are does not dictate how popular you are,

68
0:03:33.511,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and actually, having people think that you're ugly

69
0:03:37.391,000 --> 0:03:38,000
can work to your advantage.

70
0:03:39.469,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:40.643,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Let me show you how this works.

72
0:03:42.337,000 --> 0:03:46,000
In a thankfully voluntary section of OkCupid,

73
0:03:46.74,000 --> 0:03:48,000
you are allowed to rate how attractive you think people are

74
0:03:49.565,000 --> 0:03:51,000
on a scale between one and five.

75
0:03:51.874,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Now, if we compare this score, the average score,

76
0:03:54.879,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to how many messages a selection of people receive,

77
0:03:58.044,000 --> 0:03:59,000
you can begin to get a sense

78
0:03:59.591,000 --> 0:04:03,000
of how attractiveness links to popularity on an online dating website.

79
0:04:04.023,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is the graph the OkCupid guys have come up with.

80
0:04:07.389,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And the important thing to notice is that it's not totally true

81
0:04:10.407,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that the more attractive you are, the more messages you get.

82
0:04:13.256,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But the question arises then of what is it about people up here

83
0:04:17.535,000 --> 0:04:2,000
who are so much more popular than people down here,

84
0:04:21.422,000 --> 0:04:24,000
even though they have the same score of attractiveness?

85
0:04:24.542,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And the reason why is that it's not just straightforward looks that are important.

86
0:04:28.699,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So let me try to illustrate their findings with an example.

87
0:04:31.53,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So if you take someone like Portia de Rossi, for example,

88
0:04:35.472,000 --> 0:04:39,000
everybody agrees that Portia de Rossi is a very beautiful woman.

89
0:04:39.976,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Nobody thinks that she's ugly, but she's not a supermodel, either.

90
0:04:43.718,000 --> 0:04:47,000
If you compare Portia de Rossi to someone like Sarah Jessica Parker,

91
0:04:48.333,000 --> 0:04:51,000
now, a lot of people, myself included, I should say,

92
0:04:52.039,000 --> 0:04:56,000
think that Sarah Jessica Parker is seriously fabulous

93
0:04:56.32,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and possibly one of the most beautiful creatures

94
0:04:58.99,000 --> 0:05:,000
to have ever have walked on the face of the Earth.

95
0:05:01.404,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But some other people, i.e., most of the Internet ...

96
0:05:06.193,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:08.287,000 --> 0:05:1,000
seem to think that she looks a bit like a horse.

98
0:05:10.697,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:13.51,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Now, I think that if you ask people how attractive they thought

100
0:05:17.627,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Jessica Parker or Portia de Rossi were,

101
0:05:19.559,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and you ask them to give them a score between one and five

102
0:05:22.491,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I reckon that they'd average out to have roughly the same score.

103
0:05:25.535,000 --> 0:05:27,000
But the way that people would vote would be very different.

104
0:05:28.323,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So Portia's scores would all be clustered around the four

105
0:05:31.049,000 --> 0:05:33,000
because everybody agrees that she's very beautiful,

106
0:05:33.504,000 --> 0:05:35,000
whereas Sarah Jessica Parker completely divides opinion.

107
0:05:36.242,000 --> 0:05:37,000
There'd be a huge spread in her scores.

108
0:05:38.242,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And actually it's this spread that counts.

109
0:05:40.615,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's this spread that makes you more popular

110
0:05:42.865,000 --> 0:05:44,000
on an online Internet dating website.

111
0:05:45.065,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So what that means then

112
0:05:46.277,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is that if some people think that you're attractive,

113
0:05:48.906,000 --> 0:05:49,000
you're actually better off

114
0:05:50.791,000 --> 0:05:53,000
having some other people think that you're a massive minger.

115
0:05:55.935,000 --> 0:05:57,000
That's much better than everybody just thinking

116
0:05:58.173,000 --> 0:06:,000
that you're the cute girl next door.

117
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Now, I think this begins to make a bit more sense

118
0:06:02.609,000 --> 0:06:05,000
when you think in terms of the people who are sending these messages.

119
0:06:05.903,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So let's say that you think somebody's attractive,

120
0:06:08.285,000 --> 0:06:11,000
but you suspect that other people won't necessarily be that interested.

121
0:06:12.274,000 --> 0:06:14,000
That means there's less competition for you

122
0:06:14.543,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and it's an extra incentive for you to get in touch.

123
0:06:17.349,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Whereas compare that to if you think somebody is attractive

124
0:06:20.158,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but you suspect that everybody is going to think they're attractive.

125
0:06:23.399,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Well, why would you bother humiliating yourself, let's be honest?

126
0:06:27.077,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But here's where the really interesting part comes.

127
0:06:29.494,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Because when people choose the pictures that they use on an online dating website,

128
0:06:33.698,000 --> 0:06:35,000
they often try to minimize the things

129
0:06:35.898,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that they think some people will find unattractive.

130
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The classic example is people who are, perhaps, a little bit overweight

131
0:06:43.215,000 --> 0:06:45,000
deliberately choosing a very cropped photo,

132
0:06:45.681,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Laughter)

133
0:06:47.056,000 --> 0:06:48,000
or bald men, for example,

134
0:06:48.84,000 --> 0:06:5,000
deliberately choosing pictures where they're wearing hats.

135
0:06:51.812,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But actually this is the opposite of what you should do

136
0:06:54.426,000 --> 0:06:55,000
if you want to be successful.

137
0:06:55.84,000 --> 0:06:56,000
You should really, instead,

138
0:06:57.198,000 --> 0:07:,000
play up to whatever it is that makes you different,

139
0:07:00.38,000 --> 0:07:04,000
even if you think that some people will find it unattractive.

140
0:07:04.555,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Because the people who fancy you are just going to fancy you anyway,

141
0:07:07.79,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and the unimportant losers who don't, well, they only play up to your advantage.

142
0:07:12.37,000 --> 0:07:14,000
OK, Top Tip #2: How to pick the perfect partner.

143
0:07:14.947,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So let's imagine then that you're a roaring success

144
0:07:17.624,000 --> 0:07:18,000
on the dating scene.

145
0:07:19.189,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But the question arises of how do you then convert that success

146
0:07:23.748,000 --> 0:07:25,000
into longer-term happiness,

147
0:07:26.323,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and in particular, how do you decide when is the right time to settle down?

148
0:07:31.437,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Now generally, it's not advisable to just cash in

149
0:07:34.269,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and marry the first person who comes along and shows you any interest at all.

150
0:07:38.416,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But, equally, you don't really want to leave it too long

151
0:07:41.561,000 --> 0:07:43,000
if you want to maximize your chance of long-term happiness.

152
0:07:44.355,000 --> 0:07:47,000
As my favorite author, Jane Austen, puts it,

153
0:07:47.843,000 --> 0:07:49,000
"An unmarried woman of seven and twenty

154
0:07:50.061,000 --> 0:07:53,000
can never hope to feel or inspire affection again."

155
0:07:53.517,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:56.206,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Thanks a lot, Jane.

157
0:07:57.412,000 --> 0:07:58,000
What do you know about love?

158
0:07:58.849,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:59.956,000 --> 0:08:,000
So the question is then,

160
0:08:01.889,000 --> 0:08:03,000
how do you know when is the right time to settle down,

161
0:08:04.502,000 --> 0:08:06,000
given all the people that you can date in your lifetime?

162
0:08:07.154,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Thankfully, there's a rather delicious bit of mathematics that we can use

163
0:08:10.628,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to help us out here, called optimal stopping theory.

164
0:08:13.196,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So let's imagine, then,

165
0:08:15.201,000 --> 0:08:17,000
that you start dating when you're 15

166
0:08:17.827,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and ideally, you'd like to be married by the time that you're 35.

167
0:08:21.62,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And there's a number of people

168
0:08:23.086,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that you could potentially date across your lifetime,

169
0:08:25.607,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and they'll be at varying levels of goodness.

170
0:08:27.759,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Now the rules are that once you cash in and get married,

171
0:08:30.448,000 --> 0:08:32,000
you can't look ahead to see what you could have had,

172
0:08:32.902,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and equally, you can't go back and change your mind.

173
0:08:35.459,000 --> 0:08:36,000
In my experience at least,

174
0:08:37.082,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I find that typically people don't much like being recalled

175
0:08:39.904,000 --> 0:08:44,000
years after being passed up for somebody else, or that's just me.

176
0:08:45.146,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So the math says then that what you should do

177
0:08:48.363,000 --> 0:08:51,000
in the first 37 percent of your dating window,

178
0:08:51.558,000 --> 0:08:54,000
you should just reject everybody as serious marriage potential.

179
0:08:55.339,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Laughter)

180
0:08:57.513,000 --> 0:09:,000
And then, you should pick the next person that comes along

181
0:09:01.161,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that is better than everybody that you've seen before.

182
0:09:04.154,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So here's the example.

183
0:09:05.599,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Now if you do this, it can be mathematically proven, in fact,

184
0:09:08.49,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that this is the best possible way

185
0:09:10.975,000 --> 0:09:14,000
of maximizing your chances of finding the perfect partner.

186
0:09:15.328,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Now unfortunately, I have to tell you that this method does come with some risks.

187
0:09:20.604,000 --> 0:09:24,000
For instance, imagine if your perfect partner appeared

188
0:09:25.437,000 --> 0:09:27,000
during your first 37 percent.

189
0:09:28.143,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now, unfortunately, you'd have to reject them.

190
0:09:30.939,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Laughter)

191
0:09:34.129,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Now, if you're following the maths,

192
0:09:36.268,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I'm afraid no one else comes along

193
0:09:37.925,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that's better than anyone you've seen before,

194
0:09:40.22,000 --> 0:09:43,000
so you have to go on rejecting everyone and die alone.

195
0:09:44.093,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Laughter)

196
0:09:46.56,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Probably surrounded by cats ...

197
0:09:48.1,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Laughter)

198
0:09:49.838,000 --> 0:09:5,000
nibbling at your remains.

199
0:09:51.429,000 --> 0:09:54,000
OK, another risk is, let's imagine, instead,

200
0:09:55.422,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that the first people that you dated in your first 37 percent

201
0:09:58.562,000 --> 0:10:01,000
are just incredibly dull, boring, terrible people.

202
0:10:02.839,000 --> 0:10:04,000
That's OK, because you're in your rejection phase,

203
0:10:05.245,000 --> 0:10:06,000
so that's fine, you can reject them.

204
0:10:06.984,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But then imagine the next person to come along

205
0:10:10.381,000 --> 0:10:13,000
is just marginally less boring, dull and terrible ...

206
0:10:13.735,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Laughter)

207
0:10:14.858,000 --> 0:10:15,000
than everybody that you've seen before.

208
0:10:16.78,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now, if you are following the maths, I'm afraid you have to marry them ...

209
0:10:20.399,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Laughter)

210
0:10:21.478,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and end up in a relationship which is, frankly, suboptimal.

211
0:10:24.645,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Sorry about that.

212
0:10:25.822,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But I do think that there's an opportunity here for Hallmark to cash in on

213
0:10:29.346,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and really cater for this market.

214
0:10:30.952,000 --> 0:10:31,000
A Valentine's Day card like this.

215
0:10:32.559,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Laughter)

216
0:10:33.739,000 --> 0:10:36,000
"My darling husband, you are marginally less terrible

217
0:10:36.765,000 --> 0:10:38,000
than the first 37 percent of people I dated."

218
0:10:38.943,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Laughter)

219
0:10:40.597,000 --> 0:10:42,000
It's actually more romantic than I normally manage.

220
0:10:43.745,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Laughter)

221
0:10:45.24,000 --> 0:10:49,000
OK, so this method doesn't give you a 100 percent success rate,

222
0:10:49.925,000 --> 0:10:52,000
but there's no other possible strategy that can do any better.

223
0:10:53.384,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And actually, in the wild, there are certain types of fish

224
0:10:56.838,000 --> 0:10:58,000
which follow and employ this exact strategy.

225
0:10:59.679,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So they reject every possible suitor that turns up

226
0:11:02.456,000 --> 0:11:04,000
in the first 37 percent of the mating season,

227
0:11:05.169,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and then they pick the next fish that comes along after that window

228
0:11:08.944,000 --> 0:11:1,000
that's, I don't know, bigger and burlier

229
0:11:11.123,000 --> 0:11:13,000
than all of the fish that they've seen before.

230
0:11:13.725,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I also think that subconsciously, humans, we do sort of do this anyway.

231
0:11:18.626,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We give ourselves a little bit of time to play the field,

232
0:11:21.495,000 --> 0:11:24,000
get a feel for the marketplace or whatever when we're young.

233
0:11:25.115,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And then we only start looking seriously at potential marriage candidates

234
0:11:29.729,000 --> 0:11:31,000
once we hit our mid-to-late 20s.

235
0:11:31.78,000 --> 0:11:34,000
I think this is conclusive proof, if ever it were needed,

236
0:11:35.014,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that everybody's brains are prewired to be just a little bit mathematical.

237
0:11:39.45,000 --> 0:11:41,000
OK, so that was Top Tip #2.

238
0:11:41.477,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Now, Top Tip #3: How to avoid divorce.

239
0:11:45.351,000 --> 0:11:47,000
OK, so let's imagine then that you picked your perfect partner

240
0:11:48.299,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and you're settling into a lifelong relationship with them.

241
0:11:52.552,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Now, I like to think that everybody would ideally like to avoid divorce,

242
0:11:56.562,000 --> 0:12:,000
apart from, I don't know, Piers Morgan's wife, maybe?

243
0:12:00.832,000 --> 0:12:01,000
(Laughter)

244
0:12:02.185,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But it's a sad fact of modern life

245
0:12:04.629,000 --> 0:12:07,000
that one in two marriages in the States ends in divorce,

246
0:12:07.913,000 --> 0:12:1,000
with the rest of the world not being far behind.

247
0:12:11.729,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Now, you can be forgiven, perhaps

248
0:12:13.587,000 --> 0:12:16,000
for thinking that the arguments that precede a marital breakup

249
0:12:17.344,000 --> 0:12:2,000
are not an ideal candidate for mathematical investigation.

250
0:12:21.359,000 --> 0:12:22,000
For one thing, it's very hard to know

251
0:12:23.165,000 --> 0:12:26,000
what you should be measuring or what you should be quantifying.

252
0:12:26.266,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But this didn't stop a psychologist, John Gottman, who did exactly that.

253
0:12:32.473,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Gottman observed hundreds of couples having a conversation

254
0:12:37.734,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and recorded, well, everything you can think of.

255
0:12:40.064,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So he recorded what was said in the conversation,

256
0:12:42.455,000 --> 0:12:44,000
he recorded their skin conductivity,

257
0:12:44.772,000 --> 0:12:46,000
he recorded their facial expressions,

258
0:12:46.859,000 --> 0:12:47,000
their heart rates, their blood pressure,

259
0:12:48.874,000 --> 0:12:54,000
basically everything apart from whether or not the wife was actually always right,

260
0:12:55.134,000 --> 0:12:58,000
which incidentally she totally is.

261
0:12:58.349,000 --> 0:13:,000
But what Gottman and his team found

262
0:13:01.022,000 --> 0:13:04,000
was that one of the most important predictors

263
0:13:04.061,000 --> 0:13:06,000
for whether or not a couple is going to get divorced

264
0:13:06.567,000 --> 0:13:1,000
was how positive or negative each partner was being in the conversation.

265
0:13:11.214,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Now, couples that were very low-risk

266
0:13:13.568,000 --> 0:13:17,000
scored a lot more positive points on Gottman's scale than negative.

267
0:13:17.861,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Whereas bad relationships,

268
0:13:20.426,000 --> 0:13:22,000
by which I mean, probably going to get divorced,

269
0:13:23.197,000 --> 0:13:27,000
they found themselves getting into a spiral of negativity.

270
0:13:27.578,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Now just by using these very simple ideas,

271
0:13:29.862,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Gottman and his group were able to predict

272
0:13:32.357,000 --> 0:13:34,000
whether a given couple was going to get divorced

273
0:13:35.103,000 --> 0:13:37,000
with a 90 percent accuracy.

274
0:13:38.005,000 --> 0:13:41,000
But it wasn't until he teamed up with a mathematician, James Murray,

275
0:13:41.318,000 --> 0:13:42,000
that they really started to understand

276
0:13:43.233,000 --> 0:13:47,000
what causes these negativity spirals and how they occur.

277
0:13:47.751,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And the results that they found,

278
0:13:49.308,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I think, are just incredibly impressively simple and interesting.

279
0:13:53.981,000 --> 0:13:57,000
So these equations predict how the wife or husband is going to respond

280
0:13:58.568,000 --> 0:13:59,000
in their next turn of the conversation,

281
0:14:00.48,000 --> 0:14:02,000
how positive or negative they're going to be.

282
0:14:02.637,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And these equations depend on

283
0:14:04.046,000 --> 0:14:06,000
the mood of the person when they're on their own,

284
0:14:06.376,000 --> 0:14:08,000
the mood of the person when they're with their partner,

285
0:14:09.014,000 --> 0:14:1,000
but most importantly, they depend on

286
0:14:10.763,000 --> 0:14:13,000
how much the husband and wife influence one another.

287
0:14:14.115,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Now, I think it's important to point out at this stage,

288
0:14:16.746,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that these exact equations have also been shown

289
0:14:20.279,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to be perfectly able at describing

290
0:14:22.498,000 --> 0:14:25,000
what happens between two countries in an arms race.

291
0:14:27.01,000 --> 0:14:3,000
(Laughter)

292
0:14:30.3,000 --> 0:14:33,000
So that an arguing couple spiraling into negativity

293
0:14:33.905,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and teetering on the brink of divorce

294
0:14:35.834,000 --> 0:14:39,000
is actually mathematically equivalent to the beginning of a nuclear war.

295
0:14:40.107,000 --> 0:14:42,000
(Laughter)

296
0:14:43.021,000 --> 0:14:45,000
But the really important term in this equation

297
0:14:45.358,000 --> 0:14:47,000
is the influence that people have on one another,

298
0:14:47.877,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and in particular, something called "the negativity threshold."

299
0:14:51.158,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Now, the negativity threshold,

300
0:14:52.914,000 --> 0:14:56,000
you can think of as how annoying the husband can be

301
0:14:57.565,000 --> 0:15:01,000
before the wife starts to get really pissed off, and vice versa.

302
0:15:01.852,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Now, I always thought that good marriages were about compromise and understanding

303
0:15:06.408,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and allowing the person to have the space to be themselves.

304
0:15:09.194,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So I would have thought that perhaps the most successful relationships

305
0:15:12.571,000 --> 0:15:15,000
were ones where there was a really high negativity threshold.

306
0:15:15.875,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Where couples let things go

307
0:15:17.692,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and only brought things up if they really were a big deal.

308
0:15:20.487,000 --> 0:15:24,000
But actually, the mathematics and subsequent findings by the team

309
0:15:24.762,000 --> 0:15:26,000
have shown the exact opposite is true.

310
0:15:27.799,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The best couples, or the most successful couples,

311
0:15:30.132,000 --> 0:15:33,000
are the ones with a really low negativity threshold.

312
0:15:33.519,000 --> 0:15:36,000
These are the couples that don't let anything go unnoticed

313
0:15:37.177,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and allow each other some room to complain.

314
0:15:40.399,000 --> 0:15:45,000
These are the couples that are continually trying to repair their own relationship,

315
0:15:45.657,000 --> 0:15:47,000
that have a much more positive outlook on their marriage.

316
0:15:48.424,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Couples that don't let things go

317
0:15:50.516,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and couples that don't let trivial things end up being a really big deal.

318
0:15:56.426,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Now of course, it takes a bit more than just a low negativity threshold

319
0:16:01.708,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and not compromising to have a successful relationship.

320
0:16:06.1,000 --> 0:16:08,000
But I think that it's quite interesting

321
0:16:08.65,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to know that there is really mathematical evidence

322
0:16:11.028,000 --> 0:16:14,000
to say that you should never let the sun go down on your anger.

323
0:16:14.48,000 --> 0:16:15,000
So those are my top three tips

324
0:16:16.188,000 --> 0:16:19,000
of how maths can help you with love and relationships.

325
0:16:19.383,000 --> 0:16:21,000
But I hope, that aside from their use as tips,

326
0:16:21.802,000 --> 0:16:25,000
they also give you a little bit of insight into the power of mathematics.

327
0:16:25.928,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Because for me, equations and symbols aren't just a thing.

328
0:16:30.684,000 --> 0:16:34,000
They're a voice that speaks out about the incredible richness of nature

329
0:16:35.119,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and the startling simplicity

330
0:16:36.929,000 --> 0:16:4,000
in the patterns that twist and turn and warp and evolve all around us,

331
0:16:41.766,000 --> 0:16:43,000
from how the world works to how we behave.

332
0:16:44.37,000 --> 0:16:46,000
So I hope that perhaps, for just a couple of you,

333
0:16:46.704,000 --> 0:16:48,000
a little bit of insight into the mathematics of love

334
0:16:49.213,000 --> 0:16:52,000
can persuade you to have a little bit more love for mathematics.

335
0:16:52.534,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Thank you.

336
0:16:53.757,000 --> 0:17:,000
(Applause)

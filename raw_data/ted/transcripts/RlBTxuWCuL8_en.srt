1
0:00:25.944,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Over the past couple of days,

2
0:00:27.357,000 --> 0:00:28,000
as I've been preparing for my speech,

3
0:00:29.158,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I've become more and more nervous about what I'm going to say

4
0:00:32.722,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people.

5
0:00:35.865,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Being on the same stage as Al Gore, who was the first person I ever voted for.

6
0:00:40.179,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And --

7
0:00:41.363,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So I was getting pretty nervous

9
0:00:46.814,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and, you know, I didn't know that Chris sits on the stage,

10
0:00:49.643,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and that's more nerve-racking.

11
0:00:51.151,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But then I started thinking about my family.

12
0:00:53.231,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I started thinking about my father and my grandfather

13
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and my great-grandfather,

14
0:00:58.087,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and I realized

15
0:00:59.779,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that I had all of these Teds going through my bloodstream --

16
0:01:04.049,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:05.471,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that I had to consider this "my element."

18
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So, who am I?

19
0:01:11.401,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Chris kind of mentioned I started a company with my husband.

20
0:01:15.054,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We have about 125 people internationally.

21
0:01:17.497,000 --> 0:01:18,000
If you looked in the book,

22
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:2,000
you saw this ...

23
0:01:20.608,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:21.901,000 --> 0:01:24,000
which I really was appalled by.

25
0:01:25.197,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:27.624,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And because I wanted to impress you all with slides,

27
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:33,000
since I saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs,

28
0:01:33.762,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I made a graph that moves,

29
0:01:36.104,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and I talk about the makeup of me.

30
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:42.37,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So, besides this freakish thing,

32
0:01:44.447,000 --> 0:01:45,000
this is my science slide.

33
0:01:45.723,000 --> 0:01:47,000
This is math, and this is science, this is genetics.

34
0:01:48.315,000 --> 0:01:5,000
This is my grandmother, and this is where I get this mouth.

35
0:01:51.211,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:53.183,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So --

37
0:01:55.163,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I'm a blogger, which, probably, to a lot of you, means different things.

38
0:01:59.243,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You may have heard about the Kryptonite lock brouhaha,

39
0:02:03.319,000 --> 0:02:04,000
where a blogger talked about how you hack

40
0:02:05.327,000 --> 0:02:07,000
or break into a Kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen,

41
0:02:08,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and it spread all over.

42
0:02:09.373,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Kryptonite had to adjust the lock,

43
0:02:11.363,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns.

44
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:16,000
You may have heard about Rathergate,

45
0:02:16.999,000 --> 0:02:19,000
which was basically the result of bloggers

46
0:02:20.13,000 --> 0:02:24,000
realizing that the "th" in 111

47
0:02:24.174,000 --> 0:02:27,000
is not typeset on an old typewriter;

48
0:02:27.371,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it's on Word.

49
0:02:28.671,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Bloggers exposed this,

50
0:02:30.408,000 --> 0:02:32,000
or they worked hard to expose this.

51
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
You know, blogs are scary. This is what you see.

52
0:02:35.591,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I see this, and I'm sure scared -- I swear on stage -- shitless about blogs,

53
0:02:41.088,000 --> 0:02:43,000
because this is not something that's friendly.

54
0:02:44.096,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But there are blogs that are changing the way we read news

55
0:02:47.746,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and consume media, and these are great examples.

56
0:02:50.167,000 --> 0:02:52,000
These people are reaching thousands,

57
0:02:52.476,000 --> 0:02:53,000
if not millions, of readers,

58
0:02:54.346,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and that's incredibly important.

59
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:57,000
During the hurricane,

60
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
you had MSNBC posting about the hurricane on their blog,

61
0:03:01.338,000 --> 0:03:02,000
updating it frequently.

62
0:03:02.704,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools.

63
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:07,000
You have my friend,

64
0:03:07.739,000 --> 0:03:11,000
who has a blog on PVRs, personal recorders.

65
0:03:12.298,000 --> 0:03:14,000
He makes enough money just by running ads,

66
0:03:14.592,000 --> 0:03:15,000
to support his family up in Oregon.

67
0:03:16.433,000 --> 0:03:17,000
That's all he does now,

68
0:03:17.608,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and this is something that blogs have made possible.

69
0:03:20.074,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And then you have something like this, which is Interplast.

70
0:03:22.882,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It's a wonderful organization

71
0:03:24.484,000 --> 0:03:28,000
of people and doctors who go to developing nations

72
0:03:28.693,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to offer plastic surgery to those who need it.

73
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Children with cleft palates get it, and they document their story.

74
0:03:34.686,000 --> 0:03:35,000
This is wonderful.

75
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I am not that caring.

76
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:41.751,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I talk about myself.

78
0:03:42.951,000 --> 0:03:43,000
That's what I am. I'm a blogger.

79
0:03:44.568,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I have always decided that I was going to be an expert on one thing,

80
0:03:48.121,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and I am an expert on this person,

81
0:03:50.375,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and so I write about it.

82
0:03:52.842,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So, the short story about my blog:

83
0:03:54.509,000 --> 0:03:56,000
it started in 2001, I was 23.

84
0:03:56.684,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I wasn't happy with my job,

85
0:03:58.432,000 --> 0:03:59,000
because I was a designer,

86
0:03:59.908,000 --> 0:04:,000
but I wasn't being really stimulated.

87
0:04:01.852,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I was an English major in college.

88
0:04:03.509,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I didn't have any use for it, but I missed writing.

89
0:04:06.208,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So, I started to write a blog

90
0:04:07.866,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and I started to create things like these little stories.

91
0:04:10.763,000 --> 0:04:14,000
This was an illustration about my camp experience when I was 11 years old,

92
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and how I went to a YMCA camp, Christian camp,

93
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and basically by the end,

94
0:04:19.64,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I had made my friends hate me so much that I hid in a bunk,

95
0:04:24.544,000 --> 0:04:26,000
They couldn't find me, they sent a search party,

96
0:04:26.824,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and I overheard people saying they wish I had killed myself --

97
0:04:29.825,000 --> 0:04:3,000
jumped off Bible Peak.

98
0:04:31.691,000 --> 0:04:32,000
You can laugh, this is OK.

99
0:04:33.36,000 --> 0:04:34,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:34.776,000 --> 0:04:36,000
This is me.

101
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This is what happened to me.

102
0:04:38.493,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And when I started my blog, it was really this one goal --

103
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I said, "I am not going to be famous to the world,

104
0:04:47.72,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but I could be famous to people on the Internet."

105
0:04:50.198,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And I set a goal.

106
0:04:51.382,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I said, "I'm going to win an award,"

107
0:04:53.792,000 --> 0:04:55,000
because I had never won an award in my entire life.

108
0:04:56.234,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And I said, "I'm going to win the South by Southwest Weblog award."

109
0:05:00.189,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And I won it -- I reached all of these people,

110
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I had tens of thousands of people reading about my life every day.

111
0:05:06.511,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And then I wrote a post about a banjo.

112
0:05:09.319,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I wrote a post

113
0:05:11.081,000 --> 0:05:13,000
about wanting to buy a banjo --

114
0:05:13.661,000 --> 0:05:15,000
a $300 banjo, which is a lot of money.

115
0:05:16.613,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And I don't play instruments;

116
0:05:18.32,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I don't know anything about music.

117
0:05:20.515,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I like music, and I like banjos,

118
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and I think I probably heard Steve Martin playing,

119
0:05:25.404,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and I said, "I could do that."

120
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And I said to my husband,

121
0:05:28.317,000 --> 0:05:3,000
"Ben, can I buy a banjo?" And he's like, "No."

122
0:05:30.531,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And my husband --

123
0:05:31.786,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

124
0:05:32.972,000 --> 0:05:34,000
this is my husband, who is very hot --

125
0:05:35.04,000 --> 0:05:36,000
he won an award for being hot.

126
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

127
0:05:39.672,000 --> 0:05:4,000
He told me,

128
0:05:41.561,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"You cannot buy a banjo.

129
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You're just like your dad," who collects instruments.

130
0:05:46.199,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And I wrote a post about how I was so mad at him,

131
0:05:50.096,000 --> 0:05:52,000
he was such a tyrant -- he would not let me buy this banjo.

132
0:05:52.969,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And those people who know me understood my joke --

133
0:05:55.355,000 --> 0:05:57,000
this is Mena, this is how I make a joke at people.

134
0:05:57.728,000 --> 0:06:,000
Because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant,

135
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:02,000
this person is so loving and so sweet

136
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that he lets me dress him up

137
0:06:04.813,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and post pictures of him to my blog.

138
0:06:07.927,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:11.774,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And if he knew I was showing this right now -- I put this in today --

140
0:06:15.124,000 --> 0:06:16,000
he would kill me.

141
0:06:16.981,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But the thing was, my friends read it,

142
0:06:19.325,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and they're like, "Oh, that Mena, she wrote a post

143
0:06:21.776,000 --> 0:06:23,000
about wanting a stupid thing and being stupid."

144
0:06:24.268,000 --> 0:06:26,000
But I got emails from people that said,

145
0:06:26.748,000 --> 0:06:29,000
"Oh my God, your husband is such an asshole.

146
0:06:29.835,000 --> 0:06:31,000
How much money does he spend on beer in a year?

147
0:06:32.67,000 --> 0:06:34,000
You could take that money and buy your banjo.

148
0:06:35.686,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Why don't you open a separate account?"

149
0:06:37.575,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I've been with him since I was 17, we've never had a separate bank account.

150
0:06:41.151,000 --> 0:06:42,000
They said, "Separate your bank account.

151
0:06:43.056,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Spend your money; spend his money, that's it."

152
0:06:45.263,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And then I got people saying, "Leave him."

153
0:06:47.416,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Laughter)

154
0:06:48.587,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I was like, "OK, what? Who are these people?

155
0:06:51.462,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And why are they reading this?"

156
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And I realized: I don't want to reach these people.

157
0:06:55.409,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I don't want to write for this public audience.

158
0:06:58,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And I started to kill my blog slowly.

159
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I'm like, I don't want to write this anymore.

160
0:07:02.126,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Slowly and slowly --

161
0:07:03.77,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And I did tell personal stories from time to time.

162
0:07:06.782,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I wrote this one, and I put this up because of Einstein today.

163
0:07:09.718,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I'm going to get choked up, because this is my first pet,

164
0:07:12.421,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and she passed away two years ago.

165
0:07:14.073,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And I decided to break from, "I don't really write about my public life,"

166
0:07:17.555,000 --> 0:07:19,000
because I wanted to give her a little memorial.

167
0:07:19.785,000 --> 0:07:21,000
But anyways, it's these sorts of personal stories --

168
0:07:22.3,000 --> 0:07:24,000
You know, you read the blogs about politics or about media,

169
0:07:25.115,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and gossip and all these things.

170
0:07:26.669,000 --> 0:07:27,000
These are out there,

171
0:07:27.851,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but it's more of the personal that interests me,

172
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and this is who I am.

173
0:07:33.292,000 --> 0:07:35,000
You see Norman Rockwell, and you have art critics say,

174
0:07:35.869,000 --> 0:07:36,000
"Norman Rockwell is not art.

175
0:07:37.32,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Norman Rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms,

176
0:07:40.476,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and this is not something to be considered high art."

177
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And I think this is one of the most important things

178
0:07:46.807,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to us as humans.

179
0:07:49.069,000 --> 0:07:51,000
These things resonate with us,

180
0:07:51.691,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and, if you think about blogs, you think of high art blogs,

181
0:07:54.739,000 --> 0:07:57,000
the history paintings about, you know, all the biblical stories,

182
0:07:58.729,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and then you have this.

183
0:07:59.904,000 --> 0:08:02,000
These are the blogs that interest me: the people that just tell stories.

184
0:08:03.62,000 --> 0:08:06,000
One story is about this baby, and his name is Odin.

185
0:08:07.588,000 --> 0:08:09,000
His father was a blogger.

186
0:08:09.794,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And he was writing his blog one day,

187
0:08:12.688,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and his wife gave birth to her baby

188
0:08:15.313,000 --> 0:08:16,000
at 25 weeks.

189
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And he never expected this.

190
0:08:18.773,000 --> 0:08:21,000
One day, it was normal; the next day, it was hell.

191
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And this is a one-pound baby.

192
0:08:23.798,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So Odin was documented every single day.

193
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Pictures were taken every day: day one, day two ...

194
0:08:29.696,000 --> 0:08:31,000
You have day nine -- they're talking about his apnea;

195
0:08:32.609,000 --> 0:08:33,000
day 39 -- he gets pneumonia.

196
0:08:34.49,000 --> 0:08:35,000
His baby is so small,

197
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and I've never encountered such a --

198
0:08:39.381,000 --> 0:08:42,000
just -- a disturbing image, but just so heartfelt.

199
0:08:43.639,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And you're reading this as it happens,

200
0:08:46.806,000 --> 0:08:5,000
so on day 55, everybody reads that he's having failures:

201
0:08:50.935,000 --> 0:08:51,000
breathing failures and heart failures,

202
0:08:52.813,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and it's slowing down, and you don't know what to expect.

203
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But then it gets better. Day 96, he goes home.

204
0:08:59.236,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And you see this post.

205
0:09:01.346,000 --> 0:09:04,000
That's not something you're going to see in a paper or magazine

206
0:09:04.4,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but this is something this person feels,

207
0:09:06.378,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and people are excited about it -- 28 comments.

208
0:09:08.783,000 --> 0:09:1,000
That's not a huge amount of people reading,

209
0:09:10.87,000 --> 0:09:11,000
but 28 people matter.

210
0:09:12.664,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And today, he is a healthy baby,

211
0:09:15.599,000 --> 0:09:17,000
who, if you read his blog --

212
0:09:17.758,000 --> 0:09:2,000
it's snowdeal.org, his father's blog --

213
0:09:20.837,000 --> 0:09:23,000
he is taking pictures of him still, because he is still his son

214
0:09:24.024,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and he is, I think, at his age level right now

215
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:3,000
because he had received such great treatment from the hospital.

216
0:09:31.317,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So, blogs.

217
0:09:32.882,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So what? You've probably heard these things before.

218
0:09:35.453,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We talked about the WELL, and about all these sorts of things

219
0:09:39.12,000 --> 0:09:4,000
throughout our online history.

220
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:44,000
But I think blogs are basically just an evolution,

221
0:09:44.662,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and that's where we are today.

222
0:09:46.329,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It's this record of who you are, your persona.

223
0:09:48.949,000 --> 0:09:51,000
You have your Google search, where you say, "What is Mena Trott?"

224
0:09:52.038,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And then you find these things and you're happy or unhappy.

225
0:09:55.808,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But then you also find people's blogs,

226
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:,000
and those are the records of people that are writing daily --

227
0:10:00.922,000 --> 0:10:03,000
not necessarily about the same topic, but things that interest them.

228
0:10:04.866,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And we talk about the world flattens, being in this panel,

229
0:10:08.636,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and I am very optimistic -- whenever I think about blogs,

230
0:10:11.757,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I'm like, "We've got to reach all these people."

231
0:10:14.039,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Hundreds of millions and billions of people.

232
0:10:16.142,000 --> 0:10:18,000
We're getting into China, we want to be there,

233
0:10:18.312,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but there are so many people that won't have the access to write a blog.

234
0:10:22.037,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But to see something like the $100 computer is amazing,

235
0:10:24.798,000 --> 0:10:26,000
because blogging software is simple.

236
0:10:26.872,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We have a successful company because of timing,

237
0:10:29.139,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and because of perseverance, but it's simple stuff --

238
0:10:31.671,000 --> 0:10:32,000
it's not rocket science.

239
0:10:33.206,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And so, that's an amazing thing to consider.

240
0:10:36.615,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So --

241
0:10:39.294,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the life record of a blog is something that I find incredibly important.

242
0:10:44.187,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And we started with a slide of my Teds,

243
0:10:46.508,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and I had to add this slide,

244
0:10:48.19,000 --> 0:10:5,000
because I knew the minute I showed this, my mom --

245
0:10:50.584,000 --> 0:10:52,000
my mom will see this, because she does read my blog

246
0:10:53.15,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and she'll say, "Why wasn't there a picture of me?"

247
0:10:55.662,000 --> 0:10:56,000
This is my mom.

248
0:10:56.903,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So, I have all the people that I know of.

249
0:10:59.197,000 --> 0:11:02,000
But this is basically the extent of the family that I know

250
0:11:03.147,000 --> 0:11:05,000
in terms of my direct line.

251
0:11:06.055,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I showed a Norman Rockwell painting before, and this one, I grew up with,

252
0:11:10.162,000 --> 0:11:11,000
looking at constantly.

253
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I would spend hours looking at the connections,

254
0:11:14.22,000 --> 0:11:16,000
saying, "Oh, the little kid up at the top has red hair;

255
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:18,000
so does that first generation up there."

256
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And it's just these little things.

257
0:11:20.666,000 --> 0:11:23,000
This is not science, but this was enough for me

258
0:11:24.617,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to be really interested in how we have evolved

259
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and how we can trace our line.

260
0:11:30.75,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So that has always influenced me.

261
0:11:33.285,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I have this record, this 1910 census,

262
0:11:36.921,000 --> 0:11:38,000
of another Grabowski -- that's my maiden name --

263
0:11:39.452,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and there's a Theodore, because there's always a Theodore.

264
0:11:42.213,000 --> 0:11:45,000
This is all I have, a couple of facts about somebody.

265
0:11:45.869,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I have their date of birth, their age, what they did in their household,

266
0:11:50.034,000 --> 0:11:51,000
if they spoke English,

267
0:11:51.209,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and that's it, that's all I know of these people.

268
0:11:53.572,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And it's pretty sad,

269
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
because I only go back five generations, and that's it.

270
0:11:58.667,000 --> 0:12:,000
I don't even know what happens on my mom's side,

271
0:12:00.958,000 --> 0:12:02,000
because she's from Cuba and I don't have that many things.

272
0:12:04.999,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Just doing this, I spent time in the archives --

273
0:12:07.329,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that's why my husband's a saint --

274
0:12:08.997,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I spent time in the Washington archives,

275
0:12:10.949,000 --> 0:12:12,000
just sitting there, looking for these things.

276
0:12:13.078,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Now it's online, but he sat through that.

277
0:12:15.082,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And so you have this record and --

278
0:12:17.597,000 --> 0:12:19,000
This is my great-great-grandmother.

279
0:12:19.709,000 --> 0:12:2,000
This is the only picture I have.

280
0:12:21.36,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs;

281
0:12:25.647,000 --> 0:12:28,000
to think about the people that are on those $100 computers,

282
0:12:29,000 --> 0:12:32,000
talking about who they are, sharing these personal stories --

283
0:12:32.665,000 --> 0:12:33,000
this is an amazing thing.

284
0:12:34.784,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Another photo that has greatly influenced me,

285
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:39,000
or a series of photos, is this project

286
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that's done by an Argentinean man and his wife.

287
0:12:43.297,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And he's basically taking a picture of his family every day

288
0:12:46.495,000 --> 0:12:51,000
for the past, what is '76? -- 20 ... Oh my God, I'm '77 -- 29 years?

289
0:12:52.287,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Twenty-nine years.

290
0:12:55.061,000 --> 0:12:58,000
There was a joke, originally, about my graph that I left out, which is:

291
0:12:58.449,000 --> 0:12:59,000
You see all this math?

292
0:12:59.63,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I'm just happy I was able to add it up to 100,

293
0:13:01.829,000 --> 0:13:02,000
because that's my skill set.

294
0:13:03.648,000 --> 0:13:05,000
(Laughter)

295
0:13:05.886,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So you have these people aging,

296
0:13:08.571,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and now this is them today, or last year.

297
0:13:12.205,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And that's a powerful thing to have, to be able to track this.

298
0:13:15.174,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I wish that I would have this of my family.

299
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I know that one day my children will be wondering --

300
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:24,000
or my grandchildren, or my great-grandchildren,

301
0:13:24.263,000 --> 0:13:26,000
if I ever have children --

302
0:13:26.361,000 --> 0:13:28,000
what I am going to --

303
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:3,000
who I was.

304
0:13:30.311,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So I do something that's very narcissistic --

305
0:13:32.586,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I am a blogger --

306
0:13:34.102,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that is an amazing thing for me,

307
0:13:36.586,000 --> 0:13:38,000
because it captures a moment in time every day.

308
0:13:39.585,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I take a picture of myself -- I've been doing this since last year --

309
0:13:42.869,000 --> 0:13:43,000
every single day.

310
0:13:44.198,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And, you know, it's the same picture;

311
0:13:46.048,000 --> 0:13:47,000
it's basically the same person.

312
0:13:47.829,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Only a couple of people read it.

313
0:13:49.432,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I don't write this for this audience;

314
0:13:51.309,000 --> 0:13:55,000
I'm showing it now, but I would go insane if this was really public.

315
0:13:55.34,000 --> 0:13:56,000
About four people probably read it,

316
0:13:57.055,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and they tell me, "You haven't updated."

317
0:13:59.427,000 --> 0:14:01,000
I'm probably going to get people telling me I haven't updated.

318
0:14:02.411,000 --> 0:14:05,000
But this is amazing, because I can go back to a day -- to April 2005,

319
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and say, what was I doing this day?

320
0:14:07.696,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I look at it, I know exactly.

321
0:14:09.12,000 --> 0:14:11,000
It's this visual cue that is so important to what we do.

322
0:14:12.14,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I put the bad pictures up too,

323
0:14:14.263,000 --> 0:14:16,000
because there are bad pictures.

324
0:14:16.693,000 --> 0:14:17,000
(Laughter)

325
0:14:17.883,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And I remember instantly: I am in Germany in this --

326
0:14:21.567,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I had to go for a one-day trip.

327
0:14:23.091,000 --> 0:14:25,000
I was sick, and I was in a hotel room,

328
0:14:25.779,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and I wanted not to be there.

329
0:14:27.579,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And so you see these things, it's not just always smiling.

330
0:14:30.53,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Now I've kind of evolved it, so I have this look.

331
0:14:32.867,000 --> 0:14:34,000
If you look at my driver's license, I have the same look,

332
0:14:35.583,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and it's a pretty disturbing thing,

333
0:14:38.886,000 --> 0:14:4,000
but it's something that is really important.

334
0:14:41.724,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And the last story I really want to tell is this story,

335
0:14:47.136,000 --> 0:14:5,000
because this is probably the one that means the most to me

336
0:14:50.433,000 --> 0:14:51,000
in all of what I'm doing.

337
0:14:51.7,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I'll probably get choked up, because I tend to when I talk about this.

338
0:14:55.048,000 --> 0:14:57,000
So, this woman, her name was Emma,

339
0:14:57.2,000 --> 0:15:,000
and she was a blogger on our service, TypePad.

340
0:15:00.264,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And she was a beta tester, so she was there right when we opened --

341
0:15:03.449,000 --> 0:15:04,000
you know, there was 100 people.

342
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:07,000
And she wrote about her life dealing with cancer.

343
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:11,000
She was writing and writing, and we all started reading it,

344
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
because we had so few blogs on the service,

345
0:15:13.251,000 --> 0:15:14,000
we could keep track of everyone.

346
0:15:14.886,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And she was writing one day,

347
0:15:16.881,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and then she disappeared for a little bit.

348
0:15:19.159,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And her sister came on, and she said that Emma had passed away.

349
0:15:23.598,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional,

350
0:15:28.482,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and it was a very hard day at the company.

351
0:15:31.665,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And this was one of those instances where I realized

352
0:15:35,000 --> 0:15:37,000
how much blogging affects our relationship,

353
0:15:37.732,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and flattening this sort of world.

354
0:15:39.418,000 --> 0:15:4,000
That this woman is in England,

355
0:15:41.126,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and she lives -- she lived -- a life

356
0:15:44.387,000 --> 0:15:47,000
where she was talking about what she was doing.

357
0:15:47.673,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But the big thing that really influenced us was,

358
0:15:51.226,000 --> 0:15:52,000
her sister wrote to me, and she said --

359
0:15:53.136,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and she wrote on this blog --

360
0:15:54.564,000 --> 0:15:57,000
that writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life

361
0:15:57.824,000 --> 0:15:59,000
was probably the best thing that had happened to her,

362
0:16:00.341,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and being able to talk to people and to share what was going on,

363
0:16:03.433,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and being able to write and receive comments.

364
0:16:06.346,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And that was amazing,

365
0:16:07.538,000 --> 0:16:09,000
to be able to know that we had empowered that,

366
0:16:09.824,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing,

367
0:16:13.028,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and the idea that blogging doesn't have to be scary,

368
0:16:16.187,000 --> 0:16:18,000
that we don't always have to be attack of the blogs,

369
0:16:18.694,000 --> 0:16:21,000
that we can be people who are open, and wanting to help and talk to people.

370
0:16:22.401,000 --> 0:16:23,000
That was an amazing thing.

371
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And so I printed out and sent a PDF of her blog to her family,

372
0:16:29.511,000 --> 0:16:31,000
and they passed it out at her memorial service,

373
0:16:31.734,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and even in her obituary, they mentioned her blog,

374
0:16:34.12,000 --> 0:16:36,000
because it was such a big part of her life.

375
0:16:36.153,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And that's a huge thing.

376
0:16:37.414,000 --> 0:16:39,000
So, this is her legacy,

377
0:16:40.403,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and I think that my call to action to all of you is:

378
0:16:43.723,000 --> 0:16:45,000
think about blogs, think about what they are,

379
0:16:45.904,000 --> 0:16:46,000
think about what you've thought of them,

380
0:16:47.856,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and then actually do it,

381
0:16:49.045,000 --> 0:16:51,000
because it's something that's really going to change our lives.

382
0:16:52.067,000 --> 0:16:53,000
So, thank you.

383
0:16:53.253,000 --> 0:16:54,000
(Applause)

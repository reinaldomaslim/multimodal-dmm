1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I'm going to talk about post-conflict recovery

2
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and how we might do post-conflict recovery better.

3
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
The record on post-conflict recovery is not very impressive.

4
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
40 percent of all post-conflict situations,

5
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
historically, have reverted back to conflict within a decade.

6
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In fact, they've accounted for half of all civil wars.

7
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Why has the record been so poor?

8
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Well, the conventional approach

9
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to post-conflict situations

10
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
has rested on, on kind of, three principles.

11
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
The first principle is: it's the politics that matters.

12
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So, the first thing that is prioritized is politics.

13
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Try and build a political settlement first.

14
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And then the second step is to say,

15
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
"The situation is admittedly dangerous, but only for a short time."

16
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So get peacekeepers there, but get them home as soon as possible.

17
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So, short-term peacekeepers.

18
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And thirdly, what is the exit strategy for the peacekeepers?

19
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's an election.

20
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
That will produce a legitimate and accountable government.

21
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So that's the conventional approach.

22
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I think that approach denies reality.

23
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
We see that there is no quick fix.

24
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
There's certainly no quick security fix.

25
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I've tried to look at the risks of reversion to conflict,

26
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
during our post-conflict decade.

27
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And the risks stay high throughout the decade.

28
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And they stay high regardless of the political innovations.

29
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Does an election produce an accountable and legitimate government?

30
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
What an election produces is a winner and a loser.

31
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And the loser is unreconciled.

32
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The reality is that we need to reverse the sequence.

33
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's not the politics first;

34
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
it's actually the politics last.

35
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The politics become easier as the decade progresses

36
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
if you're building on a foundation

37
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
of security and economic development --

38
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the rebuilding of prosperity.

39
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Why does the politics get easier?

40
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And why is it so difficult initially?

41
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Because after years of stagnation and decline,

42
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the mentality of politics is that it's a zero-sum game.

43
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
If the reality is stagnation,

44
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I can only go up if you go down.

45
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And that doesn't produce a productive politics.

46
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so the mentality has to shift from

47
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
zero-sum to positive-sum

48
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
before you can get a productive politics.

49
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
You can only get positive, that mental shift,

50
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
if the reality is that prosperity is being built.

51
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And in order to build prosperity, we need security in place.

52
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So that is what you get when you face reality.

53
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But the objective of facing reality

54
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is to change reality.

55
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And so now let me suggest

56
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
two complimentary approaches

57
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to changing the reality of the situations.

58
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The first is to recognize the interdependence

59
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
of three key actors, who are different actors,

60
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and at the moment are uncoordinated.

61
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The first actor is the Security Council.

62
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
The Security Council typically has the responsibility

63
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
for providing the peacekeepers

64
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
who build the security.

65
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And that needs to be recognized,

66
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
first of all, that peacekeeping works.

67
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It is a cost-effective approach.

68
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It does increase security.

69
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But it needs to be done long-term.

70
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It needs to be a decade-long approach,

71
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
rather than just a couple of years.

72
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
That's one actor, the Security Council.

73
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The second actor, different cast of guys,

74
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is the donors.

75
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The donors provide post-conflict aid.

76
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Typically in the past,

77
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the donors have been interested in the first couple of years,

78
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and then they got bored.

79
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
They moved on to some other situation.

80
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Post-conflict economic recovery

81
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is a slow process.

82
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
There are no quick processes in economics

83
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
except decline.

84
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
You can do that quite fast.

85
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
So the donors have to stick with this situation

87
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
for at least a decade.

88
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And then the third key actor

89
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is the post-conflict government.

90
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And there are two key things it's got to do.

91
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
One is it's got to do economic reform,

92
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
not fuss about the political constitution.

93
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It's got to reform economic policy.

94
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Why? Because during conflict

95
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
economic policy typically deteriorates.

96
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Governments snatch short-term opportunities

97
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and, by the end of the conflict, the chickens have come home to roost.

98
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So this legacy of conflict is really bad economic policy.

99
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So there is a reform agenda, and there is an inclusion agenda.

100
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The inclusion agenda doesn't come from elections.

101
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Elections produce a loser, who is then excluded.

102
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So the inclusion agenda means genuinely

103
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
bringing people inside the tent.

104
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So those three actors.

105
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And they are interdependent

106
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
over a long term.

107
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
If the Security Council doesn't commit to security

108
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
over the course of a decade,

109
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
you don't get the reassurance which produces private investment.

110
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
If you don't get the policy reform and the aid,

111
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
you don't get the economic recovery,

112
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
which is the true exit strategy for the peacekeepers.

113
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So we should recognize that interdependence,

114
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
by formal, mutual commitments.

115
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The United Nations actually has a language

116
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
for these mutual commitments, the recognition of mutual commitments;

117
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it's called the language of compact.

118
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And so we need a post-conflict compact.

119
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The United Nations even has an agency which could broker these compacts;

120
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
it's called the Peace Building Commission.

121
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It would be ideal to have a standard set of norms

122
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
where, when we got to a post-conflict situation,

123
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
there was an expectation of these mutual commitments

124
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
from the three parties.

125
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So that's idea one:

126
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
recognize interdependence.

127
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And now let me turn to the second approach, which is complimentary.

128
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And that is to focus on a few critical objectives.

129
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Typical post-conflict situation is a zoo

130
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of different actors with different priorities.

131
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And indeed, unfortunately, if you navigate by needs

132
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
you get a very unfocused agenda,

133
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
because in these situations, needs are everywhere,

134
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but the capacity to implement change is very limited.

135
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So we have to be disciplined and focus on things that are critical.

136
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And I want to suggest that in the typical post-conflict situation

137
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
three things are critical.

138
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
One is jobs.

139
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
One is improvements in basic services --

140
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
especially health, which is a disaster during conflict.

141
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So jobs, health, and clean government.

142
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Those are the three critical priorities.

143
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So I'm going to talk a little about each of them.

144
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Jobs.

145
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
What is a distinctive approach

146
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to generating jobs in post-conflict situations?

147
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And why are jobs so important?

148
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Jobs for whom? Especially jobs for young men.

149
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
In post-conflict situations,

150
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the reason that they so often revert to conflict,

151
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
is not because elderly women get upset.

152
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's because young men get upset.

153
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And why are they upset? Because they have nothing to do.

154
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And so we need a process of generating jobs,

155
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
for ordinary young men, fast.

156
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Now, that is difficult.

157
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Governments in post-conflict situation

158
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
often respond by puffing up the civil service.

159
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
That is not a good idea.

160
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It's not sustainable.

161
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
In fact, you're building a long-term liability

162
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
by inflating civil service.

163
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But getting the private sector to expand is also difficult,

164
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
because any activity which is open to international trade

165
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
is basically going to be uncompetitive

166
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in a post-conflict situation.

167
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
These are not environments where you can build export manufacturing.

168
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
There's one sector which isn't exposed to international trade,

169
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and which can generate a lot of jobs,

170
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and which is, in any case, a sensible sector

171
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to expand, post-conflict,

172
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and that is the construction sector.

173
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
The construction sector has a vital role,

174
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
obviously, in reconstruction.

175
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
But typically that sector has withered away during conflict.

176
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
During conflict people are doing destruction.

177
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
There isn't any construction going on. And so the sector shrivels away.

178
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And then when you try and expand it,

179
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because it's shriveled away,

180
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
you encounter a lot of bottlenecks.

181
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Basically, prices soar

182
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and crooked politicians then milk the rents from the sector,

183
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
but it doesn't generate any jobs.

184
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
And so the policy priority is to break the bottlenecks

185
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in expanding the construction sector.

186
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
What might the bottlenecks be?

187
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Just think what you have to do

188
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
successfully to build a structure, using a lot of labor.

189
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
First you need access to land.

190
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Often the legal system is broken down

191
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
so you can't even get access to land.

192
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Secondly you need skills,

193
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
the mundane skills of the construction sector.

194
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
In post-conflict situations we don't just need Doctors Without Borders,

195
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
we need Bricklayers Without Borders,

196
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to rebuild the skill set.

197
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We need firms. The firms have gone away.

198
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So we need to encourage the growth of local firms.

199
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
If we do that, we not only get the jobs,

200
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we get the improvements in public infrastructure,

201
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
the restoration of public infrastructure.

202
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Let me turn from jobs to the second objective,

203
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
which is improving basic social services.

204
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And to date, there has been a sort of a schizophrenia

205
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
in the donor community,

206
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
as to how to build basic services

207
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
in post-conflict sectors.

208
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
On the one hand it pays lip service

209
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
to the idea of rebuild an effective state

210
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
in the image of Scandinavia in the 1950s.

211
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Lets develop line ministries of this, that, and the other,

212
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that deliver these services.

213
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And it's schizophrenic because in their hearts

214
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
donors know that's not a realistic agenda,

215
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and so what they also do is the total bypass:

216
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
just fund NGOs.

217
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Neither of those approaches is sensible.

218
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And so what I'd suggest

219
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
is what I call Independent Service Authorities.

220
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It's to split the functions of a monopoly line ministry up into three.

221
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
The planning function and policy function stays with the ministry;

222
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
the delivery of services on the ground,

223
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
you should use whatever works --

224
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
churches, NGOs, local communities,

225
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
whatever works.

226
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And in between, there should be a public agency,

227
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the Independent Service Authority,

228
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
which channels public money,

229
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and especially donor money,

230
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
to the retail providers.

231
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So the NGOs become part of a public government system,

232
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
rather than independent of it.

233
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
One advantage of that is that you can allocate money coherently.

234
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Another is, you can make NGOs accountable.

235
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
You can use yardstick competition,

236
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
so they have to compete against each other

237
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
for the resources.

238
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
The good NGOs, like Oxfam, are very keen on this idea.

239
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
They want to have the discipline and accountability.

240
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So that's a way to get basic services scaled up.

241
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And because the government would be funding it,

242
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
it would be co-branding these services.

243
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So they wouldn't be provided thanks to

244
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
the United States government and some NGO.

245
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
They would be co-branded

246
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
as being done by the post-conflict government, in the country.

247
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So, jobs, basic services, finally, clean government.

248
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Clean means follow their money.

249
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
The typical post-conflict government is so short of money

250
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
that it needs our money

251
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
just to be on a life-support system.

252
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
You can't get the basic functions of the state done

253
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
unless we put money into the core budget of these countries.

254
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
But, if we put money into the core budget,

255
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
we know that there aren't the budget systems with integrity

256
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that mean that money will be well spent.

257
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And if all we do is put money in and close our eyes

258
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
it's not just that the money is wasted --

259
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
that's the least of the problems --

260
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
it's that the money is captured.

261
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
It's captured by the crooks who are at the heart of the political problem.

262
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And so inadvertently we empower the people who are the problem.

263
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So building clean government means, yes, provide money

264
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
to the budget,

265
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
but also provide a lot of scrutiny,

266
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
which means a lot of technical assistance that follows the money.

267
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Paddy Ashdown, who was the grand high nabob of Bosnia

268
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to the United Nations,

269
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
in his book about his experience, he said,

270
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
"I realize what I needed

271
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
was accountants without borders,

272
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
to follow that money."

273
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So that's the -- let me wrap up,

274
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
this is the package.

275
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
What's the goal?

276
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
If we follow this, what would we hope to achieve?

277
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
That after 10 years,

278
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
the focus on the construction sector

279
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
would have produced both jobs

280
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and, hence, security --

281
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
because young people would have jobs --

282
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and it would have reconstructed the infrastructure.

283
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
So that's the focus on the construction sector.

284
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
The focus on the basic service delivery

285
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
through these independent service authorities

286
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
would have rescued basic services

287
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
from their catastrophic levels,

288
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
and it would have given ordinary people

289
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
the sense that the government was doing something useful.

290
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
The emphasis on clean government

291
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
would have gradually squeezed out the political crooks,

292
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
because there wouldn't be any money

293
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
in taking part in the politics.

294
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And so gradually the selection,

295
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
the composition of politicians,

296
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
would shift from the crooked to the honest.

297
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Where would that leave us?

298
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Gradually it would shift

299
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
from a politics of plunder

300
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
to a politics of hope. Thank you.

301
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So the question is, what is invisible?

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
There is more of it than you think, actually.

3
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Everything, I would say. Everything that matters

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
except every thing and except matter.

5
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We can see matter. But we can't see what's the matter.

6
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently:

7
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
"The marriage suffered a setback in 1965,

8
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
when the husband was killed by the wife."

9
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
There's a world of invisibility there, isn't there?

11
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So, we can see the stars and the planets,

13
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but we can't see what holds them apart

14
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
or what draws them together.

15
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
With matter, as with people, we see only the skin of things.

16
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
We can't see into the engine room.

17
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We can't see what makes people tick, at least not without difficulty.

18
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And the closer we look at anything, the more it disappears.

19
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
In fact, if you look really closely at stuff,

20
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
if you look at the basic substructure of matter,

21
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
there isn't anything there.

22
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz,

23
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and there is only energy. And you can't see energy.

24
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So everything that matters, that's important, is invisible.

25
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
One slightly silly thing that's invisible

26
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
is this story, which is invisible to you.

27
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And I'm now going to make it visible to you in your minds.

28
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
It's about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens.

29
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The late Geoffrey Dickens, M.P. was attending a fete in his constituency.

30
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Wherever he went, at every stall he stopped he was closely followed

31
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness.

32
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Try as he might, he couldn't get away from her.

34
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
A few days later he received a letter from a constituent

35
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
saying how much she admired him,

36
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph.

37
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
After her name, written in brackets was the apt description, horse face.

38
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
"I've misjudged this women," thought Mr. Dickens.

40
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
"Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness,

41
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
she turns it to her advantage.

42
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
A photo is not enough."

43
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in.

44
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And on the photograph, he wrote with a flourish,

45
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
"To Horse Face, with love from Geoffrey Dickens, M.P."

46
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
After it had been sent off, his secretary said to him,

47
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
"Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete?

48
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I wrote Horse Face on her, so you'd remember who she was."

49
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I bet he thought he wished he was invisible, don't you?

51
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So, one of the interesting things about invisibility

53
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is that things that we can't see

54
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we also can't understand.

55
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Gravity is one thing that we can't see

56
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and which we don't understand.

57
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's the least understood of all the four fundamental forces,

58
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and the weakest.

59
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And nobody really knows what it is or why it's there.

60
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
For what it's worth, Sir Isaac Newton, the greatest scientist who ever lived,

61
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity.

62
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
That's what he thought he was there for.

63
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So, bright guy, could be wrong on that one, I don't know.

64
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Consciousness. I see all your faces.

66
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I have no idea what any of you are thinking. Isn't that amazing?

67
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Isn't that incredible that we can't read each other's minds?

68
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But we can touch each other, taste each other perhaps, if we get close enough.

69
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But we can't read each other's minds. I find that quite astonishing.

70
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
In the Sufi faith, this great Middle Eastern religion,

71
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
which some claim is the route of all religions,

72
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Sufi masters are all telepaths, so they say.

73
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But their main exercise of telepathy

74
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn't exist.

75
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So that's why we don't think it exists,

76
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the Sufi masters working on us.

77
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
In the question of consciousness

78
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and artificial intelligence,

79
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
artificial intelligence has really, like the study of consciousness,

80
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
gotten nowhere. We have no idea how consciousness works.

81
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
With artificial intelligence, not only have they not created artificial intelligence,

82
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
they haven't yet created artificial stupidity.

83
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The laws of physics: invisible, eternal, omnipresent, all-powerful.

85
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Remind you of anyone?

86
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Interesting. I'm, as you can guess,

87
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
not a materialist, I'm an immaterialist.

88
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And I've found a very useful new word, ignostic. Okay?

89
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I'm an ignostic.

90
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists,

91
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
until somebody properly defines the terms.

92
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Another thing we can't see is the human genome.

94
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And this is increasingly peculiar,

95
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
because about 20 years ago, when they started delving into the genome,

96
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
they thought it would probably contain around 100,000 genes.

97
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Geneticists will know this, but every year since,

98
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
it's been revised downwards.

99
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000

100
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
genes in the human genome.

101
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
This is extraordinary. Because rice -- get this --

102
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
rice is known to have 38 thousand genes.

103
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Potatoes, potatoes have 48 chromosomes. Do you know that?

104
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Two more than people,

105
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and the same as a gorilla.

106
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You can't see these things, but they are very strange.

108
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
The stars by day. I always think that's fascinating.

110
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The universe disappears.

111
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The more light there is, the less you can see.

112
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Time, nobody can see time.

113
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I don't know if you know this. Modern physics,

114
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
there is a big movement in modern physics

115
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to decide that time doesn't really exist,

116
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
because it's too inconvenient for the figures.

117
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It's much easier if it's not really there.

118
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
You can't see the future, obviously.

119
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And you can't see the past, except in your memory.

120
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
One of the interesting things about the past is

121
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
you particularly can't see. My son asked me this the other day,

122
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
he said, "Dad, can you remember what I was like when I was two?"

123
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And I said, "Yes." And he said, "Why can't I?"

124
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Isn't that extraordinary? You cannot remember

125
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three,

126
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
which is great news for psychoanalysts,

127
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
because otherwise they'd be out of a job.

128
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Because that's where all the stuff happens

129
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that makes you who you are.

131
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Another thing you can't see is the grid on which we hang.

132
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
This is fascinating. You probably know, some of you,

133
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that cells are continually renewed. You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff.

134
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Skin flakes off, hairs grow, nails, that kind of stuff.

135
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But every cell in your body is replaced at some point.

136
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Taste buds, every 10 days or so.

137
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer. A spine takes several years.

138
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But at the end of seven years, not one cell in your body

139
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
remains from what was there seven years ago.

140
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The question is, who, then, are we?

141
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
What are we? What is this thing that we hang on,

142
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that is actually us?

143
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Okay. Atoms, you can't see them.

144
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Nobody ever will. They're smaller than the wavelength of light.

145
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Gas, you can't see that.

146
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Interesting. Somebody mentioned 1600 recently.

147
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Gas was invented in 1600

148
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont.

149
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It's said to be the most successful ever invention

150
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
of a word by a known individual.

151
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Quite good. He also invented a word called "blas,"

152
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
meaning astral radiation.

153
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Didn't catch on, unfortunately.

154
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But well done, him.

156
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
There is so many things that -- Light.

158
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
You can't see light. When it's dark, in a vacuum,

159
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes,

160
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
you won't see it. Slightly technical, some physicists will disagree with this.

161
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But it's odd that you can't see the beam of light,

162
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
you can only see what it hits.

163
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I find that extraordinary, not to be able to see light,

164
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
not to be able to see darkness.

165
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Electricity, you can't see that.

166
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Don't let anyone tell you they understand electricity.

167
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
They don't. Nobody knows what it is.

168
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

169
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
You probably think the electrons in an electric wire

170
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
move instantaneously down a wire, don't you, at the speed of light

171
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
when you turn the light on. They don't.

172
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Electrons bumble down the wire,

173
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
about the speed of spreading honey, they say.

174
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter)

175
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Galaxies, 100 billion of them estimated in the universe.

176
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
100 billion. How many can we see? Five.

177
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Five out of the 100 billion galaxies, with the naked eye,

178
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you've got very good eyesight.

179
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Radio waves. There's another thing.

180
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Heinrich Hertz, when he discovered radio waves in 1887,

181
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
he called them radio waves because they radiated.

182
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And somebody said to him,

183
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
"Well what's the point of these, Heinrich?

184
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
What's the point of these radio waves that you've found?"

185
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And he said, "Well, I've no idea.

186
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday."

187
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And that's what they do, radio. That's what they discovered.

188
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Anyway, so the biggest thing

189
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that's invisible to us is what we don't know.

190
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It is incredible how little we know.

191
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Thomas Edison once said,

192
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
"We don't know one percent of one millionth

193
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
about anything."

194
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And I've come to the conclusion --

195
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
because you've asked this other question, "What's another thing you can't see?"

196
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
The point, most of us. What's the point?

197
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
(Laughter)

198
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Applause)

199
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
You can't see a point. It's by definition dimensionless,

200
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
like an electron, oddly enough.

201
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But the point, what I've got it down to,

202
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is there are only two questions really worth asking.

203
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
"Why are we here?" and "What should we do about it while we are?

204
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And to help you, I've got two things to leave you with, from two great philosophers,

205
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century,

206
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
one a mathematician and an engineer, and the other a poet.

207
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein who said,

208
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
"I don't know why we are here.

209
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
But I'm pretty sure it's not in order to enjoy ourselves."

210
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughter)

211
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
He was a cheerful bastard wasn't he?

212
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

213
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And secondly and lastly, W.H. Auden,

214
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
one of my favorite poets, who said,

215
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
"We are here on earth

216
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
to help others.

217
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
What the others are here for, I've no idea."

218
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
(Laughter)

219
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
(Applause)

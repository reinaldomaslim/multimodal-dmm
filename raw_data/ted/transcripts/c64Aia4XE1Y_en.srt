1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I thought I would think about changing your perspective on the world a bit,

2
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and showing you some of the designs that we have in nature.

3
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And so, I have my first slide to talk about

4
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the dawning of the universe and what I call

5
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the cosmic scene investigation, that is, looking at

6
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the relics of creation and inferring what happened at the beginning,

7
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and then following it up and trying to understand it.

8
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And so one of the questions that I asked you is,

9
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
when you look around, what do you see?

10
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Well, you see this space that's created by designers

11
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and by the work of people, but what you actually see

12
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
is a lot of material that was already here,

13
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
being reshaped in a certain form.

14
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And so the question is: how did that material get here?

15
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
How did it get into the form that it had before it got reshaped, and so forth?

16
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's a question of what's the continuity?

17
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So one of the things I look at is,

18
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
how did the universe begin and shape?

19
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
What was the whole process in the creation and the evolution of the universe

20
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to getting to the point that we have these kinds of materials?

21
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So that's sort of the part, and let me move on then and show you

22
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.

23
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
If you look at this picture,

24
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
what you will see is a lot of dark with some light objects in it.

25
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And everything but -- four of these light objects are stars,

26
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and you can see them there -- little pluses.

27
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This is a star, this is a star, everything else is a galaxy, OK?

28
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So there's a couple of thousand galaxies

29
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
you can see easily with your eye in here.

30
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And when I look out at particularly this galaxy,

31
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which looks a lot like ours, I wonder if there's

32
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
an art design college conference going on,

33
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and intelligent beings there are thinking about, you know,

34
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
what designs they might do, and there might be a few cosmologists

35
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
trying to understand where the universe itself came from,

36
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and there might even be some in that galaxy looking at ours

37
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
trying to figure out what's going on over here.

38
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But there's a lot of other galaxies, and some are nearby,

39
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and they're kind of the color of the Sun,

40
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and some are further away and they're a little bluer, and so forth.

41
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But one of the questions is -- this should be, to you --

42
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
how come there are so many galaxies?

43
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Because this represents a very clean fraction of the sky.

44
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
This is only 1,000 galaxies.

45
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We think there's on the order -- visible to the Hubble Space Telescope,

46
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
if you had the time to scan it around --

47
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
about 100 billion galaxies. Right?

48
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's a very large number of galaxies.

49
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And that's roughly how many stars there are in our own galaxy.

50
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But when you look at some of these regions like this, you'll see

51
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
more galaxies than stars, which is kind of a conundrum.

52
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So the question should come to your mind is, what kind of design, you know,

53
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
what kind of creative process and what kind of design

54
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
produced the world like that?

55
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And then I'm going to show you it's actually a lot more complicated.

56
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We're going to try and follow it up.

57
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We have a tool that actually helps us out in this study,

58
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and that's the fact that the universe is so incredibly big

59
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that it's a time machine, in a certain sense.

60
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We draw this set of nested spheres cut away so you see it.

61
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Put the Earth at the center of the nested spheres,

62
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
just because that's where we're making observations.

63
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And the moon is only two seconds away, so if you take a picture of the moon

64
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
using ordinary light, it's the moon two seconds ago, and who cares.

65
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Two seconds is like the present.

66
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The Sun is eight minutes ago. That's not such a big deal, right,

67
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
unless there's solar flares coming then you want to get out the way.

68
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You'd like to have a little advance warning.

69
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But you get out to Jupiter and it's 40 minutes away. It's a problem.

70
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
You hear about Mars, it's a problem communicating to Mars

71
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
because it takes light long enough to go there.

72
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But if you look out to the nearest set of stars,

73
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to the nearest 40 or 50 stars, it's about 10 years.

74
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So if you take a picture of what's going on, it's 10 years ago.

75
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But you go and look to the center of the galaxy,

76
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
it's thousands of years ago.

77
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
If you look at Andromeda, which is the nearest big galaxy,

78
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and it's two million years ago.

79
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
If you took a picture of the Earth two million years ago,

80
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
there'd be no evidence of humans at all,

81
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
because we don't think there were humans yet.

82
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I mean, it just gives you the scale.

83
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
With the Hubble Space Telescope, we're looking at

84
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
hundreds of millions of years to a billion years.

85
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But if we were capable to come up with an idea of how to look even further --

86
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
there's some things even further,

87
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and that was what I did in a lot of my work,

88
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
was to develop the techniques -- we could look out back to even earlier

89
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
epochs before there were stars and before there were galaxies,

90
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
back to when the universe was hot and dense and very different.

91
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And so that's the sort of sequence,

92
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and so I have a more artistic impression of this.

93
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
There's the galaxy in the middle, which is the Milky Way,

94
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and around that are the Hubble -- you know, nearby kind of galaxies,

95
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and there's a sphere that marks the different times.

96
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And behind that are some more modern galaxies.

97
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
You see the whole big picture?

98
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The beginning of time is funny -- it's on the outside, right?

99
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And then there's a part of the universe we can't see

100
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because it's so dense and so hot, light can't escape.

101
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It's like you can't see to the center of the Sun;

102
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
you have to use other techniques to know what's going on inside the Sun.

103
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But you can see the edge of the Sun,

104
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and the universe gets that way, and you can see that.

105
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And then you see this sort of model area around the outside,

106
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and that is the radiation coming from the Big Bang,

107
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
which is actually incredibly uniform.

108
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
The universe is almost a perfect sphere,

109
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but there are these very tiny variations

110
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
which we show here in great exaggeration.

111
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And from them in the time sequence we're going to have to go

112
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
from these tiny variations to these irregular galaxies and first stars

113
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to these more advanced galaxies, and eventually the solar system, and so forth.

114
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So it's a big design job,

115
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
but we'll see about how things are going on.

116
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So the way these measurements were done,

117
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
there's been a set of satellites, and this is where you get to see.

118
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So there was the COBE satellite, which was launched in 1989,

119
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and we discovered these variations.

120
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And then in 2000, the MAP satellite was launched -- the WMAP --

121
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and it made somewhat better pictures.

122
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And later this year -- this is the cool stealth version,

123
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the one that actually has some beautiful design features to it,

124
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and you should look -- the Planck satellite will be launched,

125
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and it will make very high-resolution maps.

126
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And that will be the sequence of understanding

127
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the very beginning of the universe.

128
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And what we saw was, we saw these variations, and then they told us

129
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
the secrets, both about the structure of space-time,

130
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and about the contents of the universe,

131
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and about how the universe started in its original motions.

132
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So we have this picture, which is quite a spectacular picture,

133
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and I'll come back to the beginning, where we're going to have

134
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
some mysterious process that kicks the universe off at the beginning.

135
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And we go through a period of accelerating expansion, and the universe

136
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
expands and cools until it gets to the point where it becomes transparent,

137
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
then to the Dark Ages, and then the first stars turn on,

138
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and they evolve into galaxies, and then later they get to the more expansive galaxies.

139
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And somewhere around this period is when our solar system started forming.

140
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And it's maturing up to the present time.

141
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And there's some spectacular things.

142
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And this wastebasket part, that's to represent

143
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
what the structure of space-time itself is doing during this period.

144
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And so this is a pretty weird model, right?

145
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
What kind of evidence do we have for that?

146
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So let me show you some of nature's patterns

147
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
that are the result of this.

148
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I always think of space-time as being the real substance of space,

149
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and the galaxies and the stars just like the foam on the ocean.

150
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It's a marker of where the interesting waves are and whatever went on.

151
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
So here is the Sloan Digital Sky Survey showing the location of a million galaxies.

152
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So there's a dot on here for every galaxy.

153
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
They go out and point a telescope at the sky, take a picture,

154
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
identify what are stars and throw them away, look at the galaxies,

155
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
estimate how far away they are, and plot them up.

156
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And just put radially they're going out that way.

157
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And you see these structures, this thing we call the Great Wall,

158
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but there are voids and those kinds of stuff, and they kind of fade out

159
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
because the telescope isn't sensitive enough to do it.

160
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Now I'm going to show you this in 3D.

161
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
What happens is, you take pictures

162
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
as the Earth rotates, you get a fan across the sky.

163
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
There are some places you can't look because of our own galaxy,

164
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or because there are no telescopes available to do it.

165
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So the next picture shows you the three-dimensional version of this rotating around.

166
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Do you see the fan-like scans made across the sky?

167
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Remember, every spot on here is a galaxy, and you see the galaxies,

168
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
you know, sort of in our neighborhood, and you sort of see the structure.

169
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
And you see this thing we call the Great Wall,

170
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and you see the complicated structure, and you see these voids.

171
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
There are places where there are no galaxies and there are places

172
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
where there are thousands of galaxies clumped together, right.

173
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So there's an interesting pattern,

174
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but we don't have enough data here to actually see the pattern.

175
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We only have a million galaxies, right?

176
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So we're keeping, like, a million balls in the air

177
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but, what's going on?

178
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
There's another survey which is very similar to this,

179
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
called the Two-degree Field of View Galaxy Redshift Survey.

180
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Now we're going to fly through it at warp a million.

181
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And every time there's a galaxy -- at its location there's a galaxy --

182
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and if we know anything about the galaxy, which we do,

183
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because there's a redshift measurement and everything,

184
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
you put in the type of galaxy and the color,

185
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
so this is the real representation.

186
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And when you're in the middle of the galaxies

187
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it's hard to see the pattern; it's like being in the middle of life.

188
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's hard to see the pattern in the middle of the audience,

189
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
it's hard to see the pattern of this.

190
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So we're going to go out and swing around and look back at this.

191
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And you'll see, first, the structure of the survey,

192
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
and then you'll start seeing the structure of the galaxies

193
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that we see out there.

194
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So again, you can see the extension of this Great Wall of galaxies showing up here.

195
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But you can see the voids,

196
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
you can see the complicated structure, and you say,

197
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
well, how did this happen?

198
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Suppose you're the cosmic designer.

199
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
How are you going to put galaxies out there in a pattern like that?

200
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It's not just throwing them out at random.

201
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
There's a more complicated process going on here.

202
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
How are you going to end up doing that?

203
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And so now we're in for some serious play.

204
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
That is, we have to seriously play God,

205
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
not just change people's lives, but make the universe, right.

206
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So if that's your responsibility, how are you going to do that?

207
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
What's the kind of technique?

208
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
What's the kind of thing you're going to do?

209
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So I'm going to show you the results of a very large-scale simulation

210
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
of what we think the universe might be like, using, essentially,

211
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
some of the play principles and some of the design principles that,

212
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
you know, humans have labored so hard to pick up,

213
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
but apparently nature knew how to do at the beginning.

214
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And that is, you start out with very simple ingredients

215
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and some simple rules,

216
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but you have to have enough ingredients to make it complicated.

217
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And then you put in some randomness,

218
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
some fluctuations and some randomness,

219
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and realize a whole bunch of different representations.

220
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So what I'm going to do is show you

221
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
the distribution of matter as a function of scales.

222
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We're going to zoom in, but this is a plot of what it is.

223
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And we had to add one more thing to make the universe come out right.

224
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It's called dark matter.

225
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
That is matter that doesn't interact with light

226
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the typical way that ordinary matter does,

227
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the way the light's shining on me or on the stage.

228
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It's transparent to light, but in order for you to see it,

229
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
we're going to make it white. OK?

230
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So the stuff that's in this picture that's white, that is the dark matter.

231
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It should be called invisible matter,

232
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
but the dark matter we've made visible.

233
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And the stuff that is in the yellow color,

234
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
that is the ordinary kind of matter that's turned into stars and galaxies.

235
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So I'll show you the next movie.

236
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So this -- we're going to zoom in.

237
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
Notice this pattern and pay attention to this pattern.

238
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We're going to zoom in and zoom in.

239
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And you'll see there are all these filaments and structures and voids.

240
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And when a number of filaments come together in a knot,

241
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that makes a supercluster of galaxies.

242
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
This one we're zooming in on

243
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
is somewhere between 100,000 and a million galaxies in that small region.

244
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So we live in the boonies.

245
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We don't live in the center of the solar system,

246
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
we don't live in the center of the galaxy

247
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and our galaxy's not in the center of the cluster.

248
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So we're zooming in.

249
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
This is a region which probably has more than 100,000,

250
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
on the order of a million galaxies in that region.

251
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We're going to keep zooming in. OK.

252
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And so I forgot to tell you the scale.

253
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
A parsec is 3.26 light years.

254
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So a gigaparsec is three billion light years -- that's the scale.

255
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So it takes light three billion years to travel over that distance.

256
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Now we're into a distance sort of between here and here.

257
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
That's the distance between us and Andromeda, right?

258
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
These little specks that you're seeing in here, they're galaxies.

259
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Now we're going to zoom back out,

260
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and you can see this structure that,

261
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
when we get very far out, looks very regular,

262
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
but it's made up of a lot of irregular variations.

263
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So they're simple building blocks.

264
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
There's a very simple fluid to begin with.

265
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It's got dark matter, it's got ordinary matter,

266
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
it's got photons and it's got neutrinos,

267
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
which don't play much role in the later part of the universe.

268
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And it's just a simple fluid and it, over time,

269
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
develops into this complicated structure.

270
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And so you know when you first saw this picture,

271
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
it didn't mean quite so much to you.

272
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Here you're looking across one percent of the volume of the visible universe

273
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and you're seeing billions of galaxies, right, and nodes,

274
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
but you realize they're not even the main structure.

275
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
There's a framework, which is the dark matter, the invisible matter,

276
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that's out there that's actually holding it all together.

277
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So let's fly through it, and you can see how much harder it is

278
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
when you're in the middle of something to figure this out.

279
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So here's that same end result.

280
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
You see a filament,

281
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
you see the light is the invisible matter,

282
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and the yellow is the stars or the galaxies showing up.

283
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And we're going to fly around, and we'll fly around,

284
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and you'll see occasionally a couple of filaments intersect,

285
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and you get a large cluster of galaxies.

286
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And then we'll fly in to where the very large cluster is,

287
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and you can see what it looks like.

288
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And so from inside, it doesn't look very complicated, right?

289
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It's only when you look at it at a very large scale,

290
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and explore it and so forth, you realize it's a very intricate,

291
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
complicated kind of a design, right?

292
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And it's grown up in some kind of way.

293
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So the question is,

294
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
how hard would it be to assemble this, right?

295
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
How big a contractor team would you need

296
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
to put this universe together, right?

297
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
That's the issue, right?

298
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And so here we are.

299
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
You see how the filament --

300
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
you see how several filaments are coming together,

301
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
therefore making this supercluster of galaxies.

302
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And you have to understand, this is not how it would actually look

303
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
if you -- first, you can't travel this fast,

304
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
everything would be distorted,

305
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but this is using simple rendering and graphic arts kind of stuff.

306
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
This is how, if you took billions of years to go around,

307
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
it might look to you, right?

308
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And if you could see invisible matter, too.

309
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And so the idea is, you know, how would you put together the universe

310
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
in a very simple way?

311
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
We're going to start and realize that the entire visible universe,

312
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
everything we can see in every direction with the Hubble Space Telescope

313
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
plus our other instruments,

314
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
was once in a region that was smaller than an atom.

315
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
It started with tiny quantum mechanical fluctuations,

316
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
but expanding at a tremendous rate.

317
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And those fluctuations

318
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
were stretched to astronomical sizes, and those fluctuations

319
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
eventually are the things we see in the cosmic microwave background.

320
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And then we needed some way to turn those fluctuations into galaxies

321
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and clusters of galaxies and make these kinds of structures go on.

322
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So I'm going to show you a smaller simulation.

323
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
This simulation was run on 1,000 processors for a month

324
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
in order to make just this simple visible one.

325
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
So I'm going to show you one

326
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that can be run on a desktop in two days in the next picture.

327
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
So you start out with teeny fluctuations

328
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
when the universe was at this point,

329
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
now four times smaller, and so forth.

330
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And you start seeing these networks, this cosmic web of structure forming.

331
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And this is a simple one, because it doesn't have the ordinary matter

332
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and it just has the dark matter in it.

333
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And you see how the dark matter lumps up,

334
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and the ordinary matter just trails along behind.

335
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
So there it is.

336
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
At the beginning it's very uniform.

337
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
The fluctuations are a part in 100,000.

338
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
There are a few peaks that are a part in 10,000,

339
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and then over billions of years, gravity just pulls in.

340
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
This is light over density, pulls the material around in.

341
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
That pulls in more material and pulls in more material.

342
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
But the distances on the universe are so large

343
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
and the time scales are so large that it takes a long time for this to form.

344
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And it keeps forming until the universe is roughly about half the size it is now,

345
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
in terms of its expansion.

346
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And at that point, the universe mysteriously starts accelerating

347
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
its expansion and cuts off the formation of larger-scale structure.

348
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So we're just seeing as large a scale structure as we can see,

349
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and then only things that have started forming already

350
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
are going to form, and then from then on it's going to go on.

351
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
So we're able to do the simulation, but this is two days on a desktop.

352
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
We need, you know, 30 days on 1,000 processors

353
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
to do the kind of simulation that I showed you before.

354
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
So we have an idea of how to play seriously, creating the universe

355
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
by starting with essentially less than an eyedrop full of material,

356
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and we create everything we can see in any direction, right,

357
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
from almost nothing -- that is, something extremely tiny,

358
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
extremely small -- and it is almost perfect,

359
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
except it has these tiny fluctuations at a part in 100,000 level,

360
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
which turn out to produce the interesting patterns and designs we see,

361
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
that is, galaxies and stars and so forth.

362
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
So we have a model, and we can calculate it, and we can use it

363
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
to make designs of what we think the universe really looks like.

364
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And that design is sort of way beyond

365
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
what our original imagination ever was.

366
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
So this is what we started with 15 years ago,

367
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
with the Cosmic Background Explorer -- made the map on the upper right,

368
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
which basically showed us that there were large-scale fluctuations,

369
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and actually fluctuations on several scales. You can kind of see that.

370
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
Since then we've had WMAP,

371
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
which just gives us higher angular resolution.

372
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
We see the same large-scale structure,

373
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
but we see additional small-scale structure.

374
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And on the bottom right is if the satellite had flipped upside down

375
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
and mapped the Earth, what kind of a map we would have got of the Earth.

376
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
You can see, well, you can, kind of pick out

377
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
all the major continents, but that's about it.

378
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:02,000
But what we're hoping when we get to Planck, we'll have resolution

379
0:18:02.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
about equivalent to the resolution you see of the Earth there,

380
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
where you can really see the complicated pattern that exists on the Earth.

381
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:13,000
And you can also tell, because of the sharp edges

382
0:18:13.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and the way things fit together, there are some non-linear processes.

383
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Geology has these effects,

384
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
which is moving the plates around and so forth.

385
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
You can see that just from the map alone.

386
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
We want to get to the point in our maps of the early universe

387
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
we can see whether there are any non-linear effects

388
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
that are starting to move, to modify, and are giving us a hint about how

389
0:18:34.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
space-time itself was actually created at the beginning moments.

390
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
So that's where we are today,

391
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
and that's what I wanted to give you a flavor of.

392
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Give you a different view about what the design

393
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
and what everything else looks like.

394
0:18:47.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
Thank you.

395
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.488,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So this is James Risen.

2
0:00:15.174,000 --> 0:00:17,000
You may know him as the Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter

3
0:00:17.948,000 --> 0:00:18,000
for The New York Times.

4
0:00:19.664,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Long before anybody knew Edward Snowden's name,

5
0:00:22.442,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Risen wrote a book in which he famously exposed

6
0:00:25.382,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that the NSA was illegally wiretapping the phone calls of Americans.

7
0:00:29.842,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But it's another chapter in that book

8
0:00:31.636,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that may have an even more lasting impact.

9
0:00:34.405,000 --> 0:00:38,000
In it, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation

10
0:00:39.247,000 --> 0:00:42,000
in which the CIA quite literally handed over blueprints

11
0:00:42.36,000 --> 0:00:43,000
of a nuclear bomb to Iran.

12
0:00:44.662,000 --> 0:00:45,000
If that sounds crazy, go read it.

13
0:00:46.481,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's an incredible story.

14
0:00:48.456,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But you know who didn't like that chapter?

15
0:00:50.893,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The US government.

16
0:00:52.592,000 --> 0:00:54,000
For nearly a decade afterwards,

17
0:00:54.83,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Risen was the subject of a US government investigation

18
0:00:58.107,000 --> 0:01:,000
in which prosecutors demanded that he testify

19
0:01:00.5,000 --> 0:01:01,000
against one of his alleged sources.

20
0:01:02.829,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And along the way, he became the face for the US government's recent pattern

21
0:01:06.928,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of prosecuting whistleblowers and spying on journalists.

22
0:01:10.681,000 --> 0:01:11,000
You see, under the First Amendment,

23
0:01:12.373,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the press has the right to publish secret information in the public interest.

24
0:01:16.024,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But it's impossible to exercise that right if the media can't also gather that news

25
0:01:21.182,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and protect the identities of the brave men and women

26
0:01:24.462,000 --> 0:01:25,000
who get it to them.

27
0:01:26.087,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So when the government came knocking,

28
0:01:28.143,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Risen did what many brave reporters have done before him:

29
0:01:31.208,000 --> 0:01:32,000
he refused

30
0:01:32.417,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and said he'd rather go to jail.

31
0:01:34.611,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So from 2007 to 2015,

32
0:01:37.618,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Risen lived under the specter of going to federal prison.

33
0:01:40.976,000 --> 0:01:44,000
That is, until just days before the trial, when a curious thing happened.

34
0:01:45.912,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Suddenly, after years of claiming it was vital to their case,

35
0:01:49.737,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the government dropped their demands to Risen altogether.

36
0:01:52.912,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It turns out, in the age of electronic surveillance,

37
0:01:55.484,000 --> 0:01:57,000
there are very few places reporters and sources can hide.

38
0:01:58.959,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And instead of trying and failing to have Risen testify,

39
0:02:02.578,000 --> 0:02:05,000
they could have his digital trail testify against him instead.

40
0:02:06.585,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So completely in secret and without his consent,

41
0:02:09.125,000 --> 0:02:11,000
prosecutors got Risen's phone records.

42
0:02:11.903,000 --> 0:02:15,000
They got his email records, his financial and banking information,

43
0:02:16.443,000 --> 0:02:17,000
his credit reports,

44
0:02:18.22,000 --> 0:02:2,000
even travel records with a list of flights he had taken.

45
0:02:21.808,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And it was among this information that they used to convict Jeffrey Sterling,

46
0:02:25.617,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Risen's alleged source and CIA whistleblower.

47
0:02:30.035,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Sadly, this is only one case of many.

48
0:02:33.152,000 --> 0:02:36,000
President Obama ran on a promise to protect whistleblowers,

49
0:02:36.783,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and instead, his Justice Department has prosecuted more

50
0:02:40.069,000 --> 0:02:42,000
than all other administrations combined.

51
0:02:43.179,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now, you can see how this could be a problem,

52
0:02:45.307,000 --> 0:02:49,000
especially because the government considers so much of what it does secret.

53
0:02:50.758,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Since 9/11, virtually every important story about national security

54
0:02:55.282,000 --> 0:02:57,000
has been the result of a whistleblower coming to a journalist.

55
0:02:58.67,000 --> 0:03:,000
So we risk seeing the press unable to do their job

56
0:03:01.592,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that the First Amendment is supposed to protect

57
0:03:03.815,000 --> 0:03:06,000
because of the government's expanded ability to spy on everyone.

58
0:03:07.487,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But just as technology has allowed the government

59
0:03:09.964,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to circumvent reporters' rights,

60
0:03:12.695,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the press can also use technology

61
0:03:14.893,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to protect their sources even better than before.

62
0:03:17.698,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And they can start from the moment they begin speaking with them,

63
0:03:20.834,000 --> 0:03:22,000
rather than on the witness stand after the fact.

64
0:03:24.197,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Communications software now exists

65
0:03:26.313,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that wasn't available when Risen was writing his book,

66
0:03:28.869,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and is much more surveillance-resistant than regular emails or phone calls.

67
0:03:33.789,000 --> 0:03:37,000
For example, one such tool is SecureDrop,

68
0:03:38.031,000 --> 0:03:4,000
an open-source whistleblower submission system

69
0:03:40.74,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that was originally created by the late Internet luminary Aaron Swartz,

70
0:03:44.812,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and is now developed at the non-profit where I work,

71
0:03:47.501,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Freedom of the Press Foundation.

72
0:03:49.824,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Instead of sending an email,

73
0:03:51.5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
you go to a news organization's website,

74
0:03:53.565,000 --> 0:03:55,000
like this one here on The Washington Post.

75
0:03:56.01,000 --> 0:03:59,000
From there, you can upload a document or send information

76
0:03:59.977,000 --> 0:04:01,000
much like you would on any other contact form.

77
0:04:02.715,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It'll then be encrypted and stored on a server

78
0:04:05.358,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that only the news organization has access to.

79
0:04:08.351,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So the government can no longer secretly demand the information,

80
0:04:11.748,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and much of the information they would demand

81
0:04:13.876,000 --> 0:04:14,000
wouldn't be available in the first place.

82
0:04:16.475,000 --> 0:04:18,000
SecureDrop, though, is really only a small part of the puzzle

83
0:04:19.463,000 --> 0:04:21,000
for protecting press freedom in the 21st century.

84
0:04:23.035,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Unfortunately, governments all over the world

85
0:04:25.432,000 --> 0:04:27,000
are constantly developing new spying techniques

86
0:04:27.956,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that put us all at risk.

87
0:04:30.043,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And it's up to us going forward to make sure

88
0:04:32.765,000 --> 0:04:34,000
that it's not just the tech-savvy whistleblowers,

89
0:04:35.289,000 --> 0:04:38,000
like Edward Snowden, who have an avenue for exposing wrongdoing.

90
0:04:39.408,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It's just as vital that we protect the next veteran's health care whistleblower

91
0:04:44.179,000 --> 0:04:47,000
alerting us to overcrowded hospitals,

92
0:04:47.511,000 --> 0:04:49,000
or the next environmental worker

93
0:04:49.862,000 --> 0:04:52,000
sounding the alarm about Flint's dirty water,

94
0:04:53.084,000 --> 0:04:54,000
or a Wall Street insider

95
0:04:54.788,000 --> 0:04:56,000
warning us of the next financial crisis.

96
0:04:57.869,000 --> 0:05:01,000
After all, these tools weren't just built to help the brave men and women

97
0:05:02.021,000 --> 0:05:03,000
who expose crimes,

98
0:05:03.583,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but are meant to protect all of our rights under the Constitution.

99
0:05:07.46,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Thank you.

100
0:05:08.635,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Applause)

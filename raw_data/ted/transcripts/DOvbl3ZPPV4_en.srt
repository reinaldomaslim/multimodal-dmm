1
0:00:13.285,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I don't know if you've noticed,

2
0:00:14.379,000 --> 0:00:15,000
but there's been a spate of books

3
0:00:16.051,000 --> 0:00:17,000
that have come out lately

4
0:00:17.926,000 --> 0:00:19,000
contemplating or speculating

5
0:00:20.068,000 --> 0:00:24,000
on the cognition and emotional life of dogs.

6
0:00:24.479,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Do they think, do they feel and, if so, how?

7
0:00:27.35,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So this afternoon, in my limited time,

8
0:00:29.29,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I wanted to take the guesswork out of a lot of that

9
0:00:31.985,000 --> 0:00:33,000
by introducing you to two dogs,

10
0:00:34.481,000 --> 0:00:38,000
both of whom have taken the command "speak"

11
0:00:39.305,000 --> 0:00:42,000
quite literally.

12
0:00:43.266,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The first dog is the first to go,

13
0:00:46.026,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and he is contemplating an aspect

14
0:00:50.275,000 --> 0:00:52,000
of his relationship to his owner,

15
0:00:52.431,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and the title is "A Dog on His Master."

16
0:00:57.431,000 --> 0:00:58,000
"As young as I look,

17
0:00:59.411,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I am growing older faster than he.

18
0:01:02.361,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Seven to one is the ratio, they tend to say.

19
0:01:06.386,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Whatever the number, I will pass him one day

20
0:01:09.971,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and take the lead,

21
0:01:11.839,000 --> 0:01:13,000
the way I do on our walks in the woods,

22
0:01:14.76,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and if this ever manages to cross his mind,

23
0:01:18.258,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it would be the sweetest shadow

24
0:01:20.564,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I have ever cast on snow or grass."

25
0:01:25.616,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Applause)

26
0:01:28.195,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Thank you.

27
0:01:31.001,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And our next dog

28
0:01:34.14,000 --> 0:01:37,000
speaks in something called the revenant,

29
0:01:37.661,000 --> 0:01:39,000
which means a spirit that comes back

30
0:01:39.692,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to visit you.

31
0:01:43.458,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"I am the dog you put to sleep,

32
0:01:47.326,000 --> 0:01:5,000
as you like to call the needle of oblivion,

33
0:01:50.778,000 --> 0:01:52,000
come back to tell you this simple thing:

34
0:01:53.68,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I never liked you."

35
0:01:55.304,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:57.914,000 --> 0:01:58,000
"When I licked your face,

37
0:01:59.808,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I thought of biting off your nose.

38
0:02:02.701,000 --> 0:02:04,000
When I watched you toweling yourself dry,

39
0:02:05.68,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I wanted to leap and unman you with a snap.

40
0:02:09.788,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I resented the way you moved,

41
0:02:11.97,000 --> 0:02:12,000
your lack of animal grace,

42
0:02:13.856,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the way you would sit in a chair to eat,

43
0:02:16.401,000 --> 0:02:2,000
a napkin on your lap, a knife in your hand.

44
0:02:20.703,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I would have run away

45
0:02:22.161,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but I was too weak,

46
0:02:23.911,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a trick you taught me

47
0:02:25.547,000 --> 0:02:28,000
while I was learning to sit and heel

48
0:02:28.612,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and, greatest of insults,

49
0:02:30.745,000 --> 0:02:34,000
shake hands without a hand.

50
0:02:34.923,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I admit the sight of the leash would excite me,

51
0:02:38.427,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but only because it meant I was about to smell things

52
0:02:41.224,000 --> 0:02:45,000
you had never touched.

53
0:02:46.063,000 --> 0:02:47,000
You do not want to believe this,

54
0:02:47.999,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but I have no reason to lie:

55
0:02:50.365,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I hated the car, hated the rubber toys,

56
0:02:54.449,000 --> 0:02:58,000
disliked your friends, and worse, your relatives.

57
0:02:59.235,000 --> 0:03:02,000
The jingling of my tags drove me mad.

58
0:03:03.183,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You always scratched me in the wrong place."

59
0:03:06.43,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:08.432,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"All I ever wanted from you was food and water

61
0:03:11.21,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in my bowls.

62
0:03:13.402,000 --> 0:03:15,000
While you slept, I watched you breathe

63
0:03:15.475,000 --> 0:03:17,000
as the moon rose in the sky.

64
0:03:17.805,000 --> 0:03:18,000
It took all of my strength

65
0:03:19.422,000 --> 0:03:22,000
not to raise my head and howl.

66
0:03:22.478,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now, I am free of the collar,

67
0:03:24.978,000 --> 0:03:26,000
free of the yellow raincoat,

68
0:03:27.488,000 --> 0:03:28,000
monogrammed sweater,

69
0:03:29.366,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the absurdity of your lawn,

70
0:03:32.396,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and that is all you need to know about this place,

71
0:03:35.139,000 --> 0:03:38,000
except what you already supposed

72
0:03:38.24,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and are glad it did not happen sooner,

73
0:03:40.642,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that everyone here can read and write,

74
0:03:43.883,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the dogs in poetry,

75
0:03:47.233,000 --> 0:03:5,000
the cats and all the others

76
0:03:50.24,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in prose."

77
0:03:52.63,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Thank you.

78
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Applause)

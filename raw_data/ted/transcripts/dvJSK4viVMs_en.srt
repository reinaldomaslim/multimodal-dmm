1
0:00:13.64,000 --> 0:00:16,000
This is a story about capitalism.

2
0:00:16.779,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's a system I love

3
0:00:18.567,000 --> 0:00:22,000
because of the successes and opportunities it's afforded me and millions of others.

4
0:00:23.791,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I started in my 20s trading commodities, cotton in particular, in the pits,

5
0:00:30.056,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and if there was ever a free market free-for-all, this was it,

6
0:00:33.682,000 --> 0:00:36,000
where men wearing ties but acting like gladiators

7
0:00:37.3,000 --> 0:00:4,000
fought literally and physically for a profit.

8
0:00:41.437,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Fortunately, I was good enough that by the time I was 30,

9
0:00:44.36,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I was able to move into the upstairs world of money management,

10
0:00:48.02,000 --> 0:00:51,000
where I spent the next three decades as a global macro trader.

11
0:00:51.572,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And over that time, I've seen a lot of crazy things in the markets,

12
0:00:54.846,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and I've traded a lot of crazy manias.

13
0:00:59.529,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And unfortunately,

14
0:01:01.638,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'm sad to report that right now we might be in the grips

15
0:01:04.938,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of one of the most disastrous, certainly of my career,

16
0:01:08.894,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and one consistent takeaway is manias never end well.

17
0:01:12.775,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now, over the past 50 years,

18
0:01:15.581,000 --> 0:01:2,000
we as a society have come to view our companies and corporations

19
0:01:21.432,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in a very narrow, almost monomaniacal fashion

20
0:01:26.988,000 --> 0:01:29,000
with regard to how we value them,

21
0:01:30.255,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and we have put so much emphasis on profits,

22
0:01:33.924,000 --> 0:01:35,000
on short-term quarterly earnings and share prices,

23
0:01:36.71,000 --> 0:01:38,000
at the exclusion of all else.

24
0:01:39.55,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It's like we've ripped the humanity out of our companies.

25
0:01:44.319,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Now, we don't do that -- conveniently reduce something

26
0:01:48.313,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to a set of numbers that you can play with like Lego toys --

27
0:01:51.521,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we don't do that in our individual life.

28
0:01:53.869,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We don't treat somebody or value them

29
0:01:57.072,000 --> 0:02:01,000
based on their monthly income or their credit score,

30
0:02:01.213,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but we have this double standard

31
0:02:03.02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
when it comes to the way that we value our businesses,

32
0:02:05.565,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and you know what?

33
0:02:07.05,000 --> 0:02:1,000
It's threatening the very underpinnings of our society.

34
0:02:10.215,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And here's how you'll see.

35
0:02:11.817,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This chart is corporate profit margins going back 40 years

36
0:02:16.322,000 --> 0:02:18,000
as a percentage of revenues,

37
0:02:18.4,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and you can see that we're at a 40-year high of 12.5 percent.

38
0:02:22.707,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Now, hooray if you're a shareholder,

39
0:02:26.259,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but if you're the other side of that, and you're the average American worker,

40
0:02:30.526,000 --> 0:02:33,000
then you can see it's not such a good thing.

41
0:02:33.833,000 --> 0:02:36,000
["U.S. Share of Income Going to Labor vs. CEO-to-Worker Compensation Ratio"]

42
0:02:37.41,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now, higher profit margins do not increase societal wealth.

43
0:02:40.527,000 --> 0:02:45,000
What they actually do is they exacerbate income inequality,

44
0:02:45.766,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and that's not a good thing.

45
0:02:48.166,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But intuitively, that makes sense, right?

46
0:02:50.627,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Because if the top 10 percent of American families

47
0:02:54.25,000 --> 0:02:56,000
own 90 percent of the stocks,

48
0:02:56.61,000 --> 0:02:58,000
as they take a greater share of corporate profits,

49
0:02:59.571,000 --> 0:03:02,000
then there's less wealth left for the rest of society.

50
0:03:03.514,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Again, income inequality is not a good thing.

51
0:03:06.3,000 --> 0:03:08,000
This next chart, made by The Equality Trust,

52
0:03:08.761,000 --> 0:03:12,000
shows 21 countries from Austria to Japan to New Zealand.

53
0:03:13.614,000 --> 0:03:16,000
On the horizontal axis is income inequality.

54
0:03:16.818,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The further to the right you go, the greater the income inequality.

55
0:03:20.116,000 --> 0:03:23,000
On the vertical axis are nine social and health metrics.

56
0:03:23.459,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The more you go up that, the worse the problems are,

57
0:03:26.222,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and those metrics include life expectancy, teenage pregnancy, literacy,

58
0:03:31.47,000 --> 0:03:33,000
social mobility, just to name a few.

59
0:03:34.21,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now, those of you in the audience who are Americans may wonder,

60
0:03:37.391,000 --> 0:03:39,000
well, where does the United States rank?

61
0:03:39.736,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Where does it lie on that chart?

62
0:03:41.593,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And guess what?

63
0:03:43.288,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We're literally off the chart.

64
0:03:45.97,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Yes, that's us,

65
0:03:47.793,000 --> 0:03:49,000
with the greatest income inequality

66
0:03:49.952,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and the greatest social problems, according to those metrics.

67
0:03:54.248,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Now, here's a macro forecast that's easy to make,

68
0:03:56.802,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and that's, that gap between the wealthiest and the poorest,

69
0:04:00.401,000 --> 0:04:02,000
it will get closed.

70
0:04:02.421,000 --> 0:04:03,000
History always does it.

71
0:04:04.01,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It typically happens in one of three ways:

72
0:04:06.159,000 --> 0:04:12,000
either through revolution, higher taxes, or wars.

73
0:04:12.56,000 --> 0:04:14,000
None of those are on my bucket list.

74
0:04:14.889,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter)

75
0:04:16.025,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Now, there's another way to do it,

76
0:04:18.086,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and that's by increasing justness in corporate behavior,

77
0:04:22.226,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but the way that we're operating right now,

78
0:04:24.989,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that would require a tremendous change in behavior,

79
0:04:28.983,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and like an addict trying to kick a habit,

80
0:04:32.93,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the first step is to acknowledge that you have a problem.

81
0:04:36.436,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And let me just say, this profits mania that we're on

82
0:04:40.337,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is so deeply entrenched

83
0:04:42.636,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that we don't even realize how we're harming society.

84
0:04:45.167,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Here's a small but startling example of exactly how we're doing that:

85
0:04:49.184,000 --> 0:04:52,000
this chart shows corporate giving

86
0:04:52.247,000 --> 0:04:57,000
as a percentage of profits, not revenues, over the last 30 years.

87
0:04:57.632,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Juxtapose that to the earlier chart of corporate profit margins,

88
0:05:03.401,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and I ask you, does that feel right?

89
0:05:08.758,000 --> 0:05:1,000
In all fairness, when I started writing this, I thought,

90
0:05:11.699,000 --> 0:05:13,000
"Oh wow, what does my company, what does Tudor do?"

91
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And I realized we give one percent of corporate profits

92
0:05:19.693,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to charity every year.

93
0:05:21.423,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And I'm supposed to be a philanthropist.

94
0:05:25.324,000 --> 0:05:31,000
When I realized that, I literally wanted to throw up.

95
0:05:31.623,000 --> 0:05:33,000
But the point is, this mania is so deeply entrenched

96
0:05:34.101,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that well-intentioned people like myself don't even realize that we're part of it.

97
0:05:39.943,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Now, we're not going to change corporate behavior

98
0:05:42.274,000 --> 0:05:47,000
by simply increasing corporate philanthropy or charitable contributions.

99
0:05:47.591,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And oh, by the way, we've since quadrupled that,

100
0:05:50.725,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but -- (Applause) -- Please.

101
0:05:54.974,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But we can do it by driving more just behavior.

102
0:05:58.713,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And one way to do it is actually trusting

103
0:06:01.754,000 --> 0:06:03,000
the system that got us here in the first place,

104
0:06:04.169,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and that's the free market system.

105
0:06:06.282,000 --> 0:06:08,000
About a year ago, some friends of mine and I

106
0:06:08.975,000 --> 0:06:11,000
started a not-for-profit called Just Capital.

107
0:06:12.025,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Its mission is very simple:

108
0:06:13.493,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to help companies and corporations

109
0:06:15.988,000 --> 0:06:2,000
learn how to operate in a more just fashion by using the public's input

110
0:06:21.263,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to define exactly what the criteria are for just corporate behavior.

111
0:06:27.574,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Now, right now, there's no widely accepted standard

112
0:06:29.989,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that a company or corporation can follow, and that's where Just Capital comes in,

113
0:06:34.331,000 --> 0:06:39,000
because beginning this year and every year we'll be conducting a nationwide survey

114
0:06:39.651,000 --> 0:06:43,000
of a representative sample of 20,000 Americans

115
0:06:43.781,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to find out exactly what they think

116
0:06:46.701,000 --> 0:06:49,000
are the criteria for justness in corporate behavior.

117
0:06:50.579,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Now, this is a model that's going to start in the United States

118
0:06:53.591,000 --> 0:06:55,000
but can be expanded anywhere around the globe,

119
0:06:56.226,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and maybe we'll find out

120
0:06:58.107,000 --> 0:07:,000
that the most important thing for the public

121
0:07:00.975,000 --> 0:07:05,000
is that we create living wage jobs, or make healthy products,

122
0:07:06.326,000 --> 0:07:09,000
or help, not harm, the environment.

123
0:07:09.577,000 --> 0:07:13,000
At Just Capital, we don't know, and it's not for us to decide.

124
0:07:13.85,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We're but messengers,

125
0:07:15.846,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but we have 100 percent confidence and faith in the American public

126
0:07:19.956,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to get it right.

127
0:07:21.88,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So we'll release the findings this September for the first time,

128
0:07:25.41,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and then next year, we'll poll again,

129
0:07:27.85,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and we'll take the additive step this time

130
0:07:30.149,000 --> 0:07:33,000
of ranking the 1,000 largest U.S. companies

131
0:07:33.168,000 --> 0:07:37,000
from number one to number 1,000 and everything in between.

132
0:07:37.72,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We're calling it the Just Index,

133
0:07:40.551,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and remember, we're an independent not-for-profit with no bias,

134
0:07:45.8,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and we will be giving the American public a voice.

135
0:07:50.953,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And maybe over time, we'll find out that as people come to know

136
0:07:55.156,000 --> 0:07:57,000
which companies are the most just,

137
0:07:57.176,000 --> 0:08:01,000
human and economic resources will be driven towards them,

138
0:08:01.216,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and they'll become the most prosperous

139
0:08:03.19,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and help our country be the most prosperous.

140
0:08:07.351,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Now, capitalism has been responsible for every major innovation

141
0:08:11.457,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that's made this world a more inspiring and wonderful place to live in.

142
0:08:16.578,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Capitalism has to be based on justice.

143
0:08:19.443,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It has to be, and now more than ever,

144
0:08:21.649,000 --> 0:08:24,000
with economic divisions growing wider every day.

145
0:08:25.48,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It's estimated that 47 percent of American workers

146
0:08:28.498,000 --> 0:08:31,000
can be displaced in the next 20 years.

147
0:08:31.796,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I'm not against progress.

148
0:08:33.769,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I want the driverless car and the jet pack just like everyone else.

149
0:08:38.65,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But I'm pleading for recognition that with increased wealth and profits

150
0:08:44.5,000 --> 0:08:49,000
has to come greater corporate social responsibility.

151
0:08:49.93,000 --> 0:08:54,000
"If justice is removed," said Adam Smith, the father of capitalism,

152
0:08:55.665,000 --> 0:09:,000
"the great, the immense fabric of human society must in a moment

153
0:09:01.419,000 --> 0:09:05,000
crumble into atoms."

154
0:09:05.626,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Now, when I was young, and there was a problem,

155
0:09:09.39,000 --> 0:09:13,000
my mama used to always sigh and shake her head and say,

156
0:09:13.573,000 --> 0:09:17,000
"Have mercy, have mercy."

157
0:09:17.63,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Now's not the time for us, for the rest of us to show them mercy.

158
0:09:22.181,000 --> 0:09:25,000
The time is now for us to show them fairness,

159
0:09:25.37,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and we can do that, you and I,

160
0:09:27.846,000 --> 0:09:32,000
by starting where we work, in the businesses that we operate in.

161
0:09:33.1,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And when we put justness on par with profits,

162
0:09:36.46,000 --> 0:09:39,000
we'll get the most wonderful thing in all the world.

163
0:09:40.408,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We'll take back our humanity.

164
0:09:43.774,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Thank you.

165
0:09:46.421,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Applause)

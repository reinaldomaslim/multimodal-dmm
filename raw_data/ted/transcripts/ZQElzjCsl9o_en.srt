0:00:13.174,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hi.

2
0:00:14.357,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want to talk about understanding, and the nature of understanding,

3
0:00:18.2,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and what the essence of understanding is,

4
0:00:21.617,000 --> 0:00:24,000
because understanding is something we aim for, everyone.

5
0:00:24.678,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We want to understand things.

6
0:00:27.763,000 --> 0:00:29,000
My claim is that understanding has to do

7
0:00:30.135,000 --> 0:00:32,000
with the ability to change your perspective.

8
0:00:32.737,000 --> 0:00:34,000
If you don't have that, you don't have understanding.

9
0:00:36.106,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So that is my claim.

10
0:00:37.672,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And I want to focus on mathematics.

11
0:00:40.05,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Many of us think of mathematics as addition, subtraction,

12
0:00:43.57,000 --> 0:00:44,000
multiplication, division,

13
0:00:45.542,000 --> 0:00:48,000
fractions, percent, geometry, algebra -- all that stuff.

14
0:00:50.034,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But actually, I want to talk about the essence of mathematics as well.

15
0:00:53.732,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And my claim is that mathematics has to do with patterns.

16
0:00:57.043,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Behind me, you see a beautiful pattern,

17
0:00:59.558,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and this pattern actually emerges just from drawing circles

18
0:01:03.513,000 --> 0:01:04,000
in a very particular way.

19
0:01:05.778,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So my day-to-day definition of mathematics that I use every day

20
0:01:10.391,000 --> 0:01:11,000
is the following:

21
0:01:12.03,000 --> 0:01:14,000
First of all, it's about finding patterns.

22
0:01:16.001,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And by "pattern," I mean a connection, a structure, some regularity,

23
0:01:21.52,000 --> 0:01:22,000
some rules that govern what we see.

24
0:01:24.17,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Second of all,

25
0:01:25.349,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I think it is about representing these patterns with a language.

26
0:01:29.361,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We make up language if we don't have it,

27
0:01:31.829,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and in mathematics, this is essential.

28
0:01:35.013,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's also about making assumptions

29
0:01:36.837,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and playing around with these assumptions and just seeing what happens.

30
0:01:40.474,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We're going to do that very soon.

31
0:01:42.986,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And finally, it's about doing cool stuff.

32
0:01:46.46,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Mathematics enables us to do so many things.

33
0:01:50.632,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So let's have a look at these patterns.

34
0:01:52.872,000 --> 0:01:54,000
If you want to tie a tie knot,

35
0:01:55.118,000 --> 0:01:56,000
there are patterns.

36
0:01:56.452,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Tie knots have names.

37
0:01:58.453,000 --> 0:02:,000
And you can also do the mathematics of tie knots.

38
0:02:00.824,000 --> 0:02:02,000
This is a left-out, right-in, center-out and tie.

39
0:02:04.073,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This is a left-in, right-out, left-in, center-out and tie.

40
0:02:08.005,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This is a language we made up for the patterns of tie knots,

41
0:02:12.522,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and a half-Windsor is all that.

42
0:02:15.529,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This is a mathematics book about tying shoelaces

43
0:02:18.34,000 --> 0:02:19,000
at the university level,

44
0:02:19.754,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because there are patterns in shoelaces.

45
0:02:21.756,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You can do it in so many different ways.

46
0:02:23.891,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We can analyze it.

47
0:02:25.159,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We can make up languages for it.

48
0:02:28.218,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And representations are all over mathematics.

49
0:02:31.181,000 --> 0:02:34,000
This is Leibniz's notation from 1675.

50
0:02:35.335,000 --> 0:02:38,000
He invented a language for patterns in nature.

51
0:02:39.363,000 --> 0:02:4,000
When we throw something up in the air,

52
0:02:41.255,000 --> 0:02:42,000
it falls down.

53
0:02:42.469,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Why?

54
0:02:43.644,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We're not sure, but we can represent this with mathematics in a pattern.

55
0:02:48.285,000 --> 0:02:49,000
This is also a pattern.

56
0:02:49.912,000 --> 0:02:51,000
This is also an invented language.

57
0:02:52.636,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Can you guess for what?

58
0:02:55.481,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It is actually a notation system for dancing, for tap dancing.

59
0:02:59.532,000 --> 0:03:04,000
That enables him as a choreographer to do cool stuff, to do new things,

60
0:03:04.812,000 --> 0:03:05,000
because he has represented it.

61
0:03:07.232,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I want you to think about how amazing representing something actually is.

62
0:03:12.62,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Here it says the word "mathematics."

63
0:03:15.905,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But actually, they're just dots, right?

64
0:03:18.329,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So how in the world can these dots represent the word?

65
0:03:21.344,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Well, they do.

66
0:03:23.343,000 --> 0:03:24,000
They represent the word "mathematics,"

67
0:03:25.265,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and these symbols also represent that word

68
0:03:27.849,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and this we can listen to.

69
0:03:29.531,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It sounds like this.

70
0:03:30.912,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Beeps)

71
0:03:32.92,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Somehow these sounds represent the word and the concept.

72
0:03:36.234,000 --> 0:03:37,000
How does this happen?

73
0:03:37.914,000 --> 0:03:4,000
There's something amazing going on about representing stuff.

74
0:03:41.966,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So I want to talk about that magic that happens

75
0:03:47.607,000 --> 0:03:48,000
when we actually represent something.

76
0:03:49.602,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Here you see just lines with different widths.

77
0:03:52.642,000 --> 0:03:54,000
They stand for numbers for a particular book.

78
0:03:55.291,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And I can actually recommend this book, it's a very nice book.

79
0:03:58.308,000 --> 0:03:59,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:59.354,000 --> 0:04:,000
Just trust me.

81
0:04:01.475,000 --> 0:04:03,000
OK, so let's just do an experiment,

82
0:04:03.822,000 --> 0:04:05,000
just to play around with some straight lines.

83
0:04:06.014,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is a straight line.

84
0:04:07.205,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Let's make another one.

85
0:04:08.383,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So every time we move, we move one down and one across,

86
0:04:11.216,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and we draw a new straight line, right?

87
0:04:13.814,000 --> 0:04:15,000
We do this over and over and over,

88
0:04:16.351,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and we look for patterns.

89
0:04:17.733,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So this pattern emerges,

90
0:04:20.22,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and it's a rather nice pattern.

91
0:04:22.286,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It looks like a curve, right?

92
0:04:24.045,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Just from drawing simple, straight lines.

93
0:04:27.271,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now I can change my perspective a little bit. I can rotate it.

94
0:04:30.944,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Have a look at the curve.

95
0:04:32.35,000 --> 0:04:33,000
What does it look like?

96
0:04:33.753,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Is it a part of a circle?

97
0:04:35.759,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's actually not a part of a circle.

98
0:04:37.685,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So I have to continue my investigation and look for the true pattern.

99
0:04:41.868,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Perhaps if I copy it and make some art?

100
0:04:45.674,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Well, no.

101
0:04:46.854,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Perhaps I should extend the lines like this,

102
0:04:49.027,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and look for the pattern there.

103
0:04:50.821,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Let's make more lines.

104
0:04:52.14,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We do this.

105
0:04:53.394,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And then let's zoom out and change our perspective again.

106
0:04:57.801,000 --> 0:05:,000
Then we can actually see that what started out as just straight lines

107
0:05:01.336,000 --> 0:05:03,000
is actually a curve called a parabola.

108
0:05:03.855,000 --> 0:05:06,000
This is represented by a simple equation,

109
0:05:07.096,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and it's a beautiful pattern.

110
0:05:09.521,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So this is the stuff that we do.

111
0:05:11.32,000 --> 0:05:13,000
We find patterns, and we represent them.

112
0:05:13.954,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I think this is a nice day-to-day definition.

113
0:05:16.602,000 --> 0:05:18,000
But today I want to go a little bit deeper,

114
0:05:18.957,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and think about what the nature of this is.

115
0:05:22.925,000 --> 0:05:23,000
What makes it possible?

116
0:05:24.377,000 --> 0:05:26,000
There's one thing that's a little bit deeper,

117
0:05:26.555,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and that has to do with the ability to change your perspective.

118
0:05:30.082,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And I claim that when you change your perspective,

119
0:05:32.629,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and if you take another point of view,

120
0:05:35.459,000 --> 0:05:38,000
you learn something new about what you are watching

121
0:05:39.393,000 --> 0:05:4,000
or looking at or hearing.

122
0:05:41.472,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And I think this is a really important thing that we do all the time.

123
0:05:45.834,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So let's just look at this simple equation,

124
0:05:49.838,000 --> 0:05:51,000
x + x = 2 • x.

125
0:05:52.411,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This is a very nice pattern, and it's true,

126
0:05:54.507,000 --> 0:05:56,000
because 5 + 5 = 2 • 5, etc.

127
0:05:57.36,000 --> 0:06:,000
We've seen this over and over, and we represent it like this.

128
0:06:00.485,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But think about it: this is an equation.

129
0:06:03.025,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It says that something is equal to something else,

130
0:06:05.611,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and that's two different perspectives.

131
0:06:07.922,000 --> 0:06:08,000
One perspective is, it's a sum.

132
0:06:09.845,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It's something you plus together.

133
0:06:11.715,000 --> 0:06:13,000
On the other hand, it's a multiplication,

134
0:06:14.111,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and those are two different perspectives.

135
0:06:17.14,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And I would go as far as to say that every equation is like this,

136
0:06:20.912,000 --> 0:06:24,000
every mathematical equation where you use that equality sign

137
0:06:25.052,000 --> 0:06:26,000
is actually a metaphor.

138
0:06:26.919,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It's an analogy between two things.

139
0:06:28.949,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You're just viewing something and taking two different points of view,

140
0:06:32.468,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and you're expressing that in a language.

141
0:06:34.885,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Have a look at this equation.

142
0:06:36.473,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This is one of the most beautiful equations.

143
0:06:38.752,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It simply says that, well,

144
0:06:41.902,000 --> 0:06:42,000
two things, they're both -1.

145
0:06:44.279,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This thing on the left-hand side is -1, and the other one is.

146
0:06:47.693,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And that, I think, is one of the essential parts

147
0:06:50.043,000 --> 0:06:52,000
of mathematics -- you take different points of view.

148
0:06:52.53,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So let's just play around.

149
0:06:53.889,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Let's take a number.

150
0:06:55.18,000 --> 0:06:57,000
We know four-thirds. We know what four-thirds is.

151
0:06:58.082,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It's 1.333, but we have to have those three dots,

152
0:07:01.489,000 --> 0:07:03,000
otherwise it's not exactly four-thirds.

153
0:07:03.886,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But this is only in base 10.

154
0:07:05.806,000 --> 0:07:07,000
You know, the number system, we use 10 digits.

155
0:07:08.093,000 --> 0:07:1,000
If we change that around and only use two digits,

156
0:07:10.435,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that's called the binary system.

157
0:07:12.269,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It's written like this.

158
0:07:13.996,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So we're now talking about the number.

159
0:07:15.982,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The number is four-thirds.

160
0:07:17.964,000 --> 0:07:18,000
We can write it like this,

161
0:07:19.331,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and we can change the base, change the number of digits,

162
0:07:22.36,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and we can write it differently.

163
0:07:24.172,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So these are all representations of the same number.

164
0:07:28.363,000 --> 0:07:31,000
We can even write it simply, like 1.3 or 1.6.

165
0:07:31.935,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It all depends on how many digits you have.

166
0:07:34.521,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Or perhaps we just simplify and write it like this.

167
0:07:37.927,000 --> 0:07:4,000
I like this one, because this says four divided by three.

168
0:07:41.166,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And this number expresses a relation between two numbers.

169
0:07:44.227,000 --> 0:07:46,000
You have four on the one hand and three on the other.

170
0:07:47.215,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And you can visualize this in many ways.

171
0:07:49.317,000 --> 0:07:53,000
What I'm doing now is viewing that number from different perspectives.

172
0:07:53.388,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I'm playing around.

173
0:07:54.563,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I'm playing around with how we view something,

174
0:07:57.131,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and I'm doing it very deliberately.

175
0:07:58.867,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We can take a grid.

176
0:08:00.074,000 --> 0:08:04,000
If it's four across and three up, this line equals five, always.

177
0:08:04.776,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It has to be like this. This is a beautiful pattern.

178
0:08:07.488,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Four and three and five.

179
0:08:09.177,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And this rectangle, which is 4 x 3,

180
0:08:11.912,000 --> 0:08:12,000
you've seen a lot of times.

181
0:08:13.527,000 --> 0:08:14,000
This is your average computer screen.

182
0:08:15.364,000 --> 0:08:18,000
800 x 600 or 1,600 x 1,200

183
0:08:18.767,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is a television or a computer screen.

184
0:08:21.864,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So these are all nice representations,

185
0:08:23.92,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but I want to go a little bit further and just play more with this number.

186
0:08:27.866,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Here you see two circles. I'm going to rotate them like this.

187
0:08:31.138,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Observe the upper-left one.

188
0:08:32.95,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It goes a little bit faster, right?

189
0:08:35.137,000 --> 0:08:36,000
You can see this.

190
0:08:36.319,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It actually goes exactly four-thirds as fast.

191
0:08:39.717,000 --> 0:08:41,000
That means that when it goes around four times,

192
0:08:42.141,000 --> 0:08:43,000
the other one goes around three times.

193
0:08:44.044,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Now let's make two lines, and draw this dot where the lines meet.

194
0:08:47.569,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We get this dot dancing around.

195
0:08:49.295,000 --> 0:08:5,000
(Laughter)

196
0:08:50.356,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And this dot comes from that number.

197
0:08:52.926,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Right? Now we should trace it.

198
0:08:55.239,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Let's trace it and see what happens.

199
0:08:57.441,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This is what mathematics is all about.

200
0:08:59.393,000 --> 0:09:,000
It's about seeing what happens.

201
0:09:01.052,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And this emerges from four-thirds.

202
0:09:04.02,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I like to say that this is the image of four-thirds.

203
0:09:07.404,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's much nicer -- (Cheers)

204
0:09:08.724,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Thank you!

205
0:09:09.906,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Applause)

206
0:09:16.556,000 --> 0:09:17,000
This is not new.

207
0:09:17.731,000 --> 0:09:19,000
This has been known for a long time, but --

208
0:09:19.789,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Laughter)

209
0:09:21.422,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But this is four-thirds.

210
0:09:23.13,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Let's do another experiment.

211
0:09:24.713,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Let's now take a sound, this sound: (Beep)

212
0:09:28.846,000 --> 0:09:3,000
This is a perfect A, 440Hz.

213
0:09:31.859,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Let's multiply it by two.

214
0:09:33.569,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We get this sound. (Beep)

215
0:09:34.952,000 --> 0:09:36,000
When we play them together, it sounds like this.

216
0:09:37.231,000 --> 0:09:38,000
This is an octave, right?

217
0:09:38.468,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We can do this game. We can play a sound, play the same A.

218
0:09:41.257,000 --> 0:09:42,000
We can multiply it by three-halves.

219
0:09:42.982,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Beep)

220
0:09:44.624,000 --> 0:09:45,000
This is what we call a perfect fifth.

221
0:09:46.592,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Beep)

222
0:09:47.662,000 --> 0:09:49,000
They sound really nice together.

223
0:09:49.792,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Let's multiply this sound by four-thirds. (Beep)

224
0:09:53.939,000 --> 0:09:54,000
What happens?

225
0:09:55.889,000 --> 0:09:56,000
You get this sound. (Beep)

226
0:09:57.344,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This is the perfect fourth.

227
0:09:58.654,000 --> 0:10:,000
If the first one is an A, this is a D.

228
0:10:00.923,000 --> 0:10:02,000
They sound like this together. (Beeps)

229
0:10:02.977,000 --> 0:10:04,000
This is the sound of four-thirds.

230
0:10:05.411,000 --> 0:10:07,000
What I'm doing now, I'm changing my perspective.

231
0:10:07.989,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I'm just viewing a number from another perspective.

232
0:10:10.793,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I can even do this with rhythms, right?

233
0:10:12.782,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I can take a rhythm and play three beats at one time (Drumbeats)

234
0:10:16.478,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in a period of time,

235
0:10:18.053,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and I can play another sound four times in that same space.

236
0:10:22.419,000 --> 0:10:23,000
(Clanking sounds)

237
0:10:23.485,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Sounds kind of boring, but listen to them together.

238
0:10:25.89,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Drumbeats and clanking sounds)

239
0:10:28.7,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Laughter)

240
0:10:30.014,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Hey! So.

241
0:10:31.459,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Laughter)

242
0:10:33.371,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I can even make a little hi-hat.

243
0:10:35.554,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Drumbeats and cymbals)

244
0:10:37.419,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Can you hear this?

245
0:10:38.594,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So, this is the sound of four-thirds.

246
0:10:40.731,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Again, this is as a rhythm.

247
0:10:42.605,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Drumbeats and cowbell)

248
0:10:44.439,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And I can keep doing this and play games with this number.

249
0:10:47.311,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Four-thirds is a really great number. I love four-thirds!

250
0:10:50.08,000 --> 0:10:51,000
(Laughter)

251
0:10:51.38,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Truly -- it's an undervalued number.

252
0:10:53.891,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So if you take a sphere and look at the volume of the sphere,

253
0:10:56.774,000 --> 0:10:58,000
it's actually four-thirds of some particular cylinder.

254
0:10:59.731,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So four-thirds is in the sphere. It's the volume of the sphere.

255
0:11:03.824,000 --> 0:11:05,000
OK, so why am I doing all this?

256
0:11:05.89,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Well, I want to talk about what it means to understand something

257
0:11:09.144,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and what we mean by understanding something.

258
0:11:11.732,000 --> 0:11:12,000
That's my aim here.

259
0:11:13.179,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And my claim is that you understand something

260
0:11:15.333,000 --> 0:11:17,000
if you have the ability to view it from different perspectives.

261
0:11:18.349,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Let's look at this letter. It's a beautiful R, right?

262
0:11:20.914,000 --> 0:11:21,000
How do you know that?

263
0:11:22.557,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Well, as a matter of fact, you've seen a bunch of R's,

264
0:11:25.769,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and you've generalized

265
0:11:27.438,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and abstracted all of these and found a pattern.

266
0:11:30.432,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So you know that this is an R.

267
0:11:35.643,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So what I'm aiming for here is saying something

268
0:11:38.474,000 --> 0:11:41,000
about how understanding and changing your perspective

269
0:11:41.879,000 --> 0:11:42,000
are linked.

270
0:11:43.235,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And I'm a teacher and a lecturer,

271
0:11:45.428,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and I can actually use this to teach something,

272
0:11:47.764,000 --> 0:11:51,000
because when I give someone else another story, a metaphor, an analogy,

273
0:11:52.628,000 --> 0:11:54,000
if I tell a story from a different point of view,

274
0:11:55.051,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I enable understanding.

275
0:11:56.588,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I make understanding possible,

276
0:11:58.478,000 --> 0:12:01,000
because you have to generalize over everything you see and hear,

277
0:12:01.568,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and if I give you another perspective, that will become easier for you.

278
0:12:06.191,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Let's do a simple example again.

279
0:12:08.121,000 --> 0:12:1,000
This is four and three. This is four triangles.

280
0:12:10.786,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So this is also four-thirds, in a way.

281
0:12:13.258,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Let's just join them together.

282
0:12:15.004,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Now we're going to play a game; we're going to fold it up

283
0:12:17.737,000 --> 0:12:18,000
into a three-dimensional structure.

284
0:12:19.443,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I love this.

285
0:12:20.631,000 --> 0:12:21,000
This is a square pyramid.

286
0:12:22.529,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And let's just take two of them and put them together.

287
0:12:25.703,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So this is what is called an octahedron.

288
0:12:28.416,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It's one of the five platonic solids.

289
0:12:31.147,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Now we can quite literally change our perspective,

290
0:12:33.616,000 --> 0:12:35,000
because we can rotate it around all of the axes

291
0:12:36.335,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and view it from different perspectives.

292
0:12:38.371,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And I can change the axis,

293
0:12:40.461,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and then I can view it from another point of view,

294
0:12:42.823,000 --> 0:12:44,000
but it's the same thing, but it looks a little different.

295
0:12:45.55,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I can do it even one more time.

296
0:12:47.242,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Every time I do this, something else appears,

297
0:12:50.568,000 --> 0:12:52,000
so I'm actually learning more about the object

298
0:12:52.771,000 --> 0:12:53,000
when I change my perspective.

299
0:12:54.32,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I can use this as a tool for creating understanding.

300
0:12:58.548,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I can take two of these and put them together like this

301
0:13:02.164,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and see what happens.

302
0:13:03.865,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And it looks a little bit like the octahedron.

303
0:13:07.3,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Have a look at it if I spin it around like this.

304
0:13:09.802,000 --> 0:13:1,000
What happens?

305
0:13:11.008,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Well, if you take two of these, join them together and spin it around,

306
0:13:14.376,000 --> 0:13:16,000
there's your octahedron again,

307
0:13:16.801,000 --> 0:13:17,000
a beautiful structure.

308
0:13:18.456,000 --> 0:13:2,000
If you lay it out flat on the floor,

309
0:13:20.644,000 --> 0:13:21,000
this is the octahedron.

310
0:13:21.885,000 --> 0:13:23,000
This is the graph structure of an octahedron.

311
0:13:25.255,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And I can continue doing this.

312
0:13:27.652,000 --> 0:13:3,000
You can draw three great circles around the octahedron,

313
0:13:31.203,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and you rotate around,

314
0:13:33.077,000 --> 0:13:37,000
so actually three great circles is related to the octahedron.

315
0:13:37.562,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And if I take a bicycle pump and just pump it up,

316
0:13:41.245,000 --> 0:13:44,000
you can see that this is also a little bit like the octahedron.

317
0:13:44.801,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Do you see what I'm doing here?

318
0:13:47.121,000 --> 0:13:49,000
I am changing the perspective every time.

319
0:13:50.801,000 --> 0:13:52,000
So let's now take a step back --

320
0:13:53.475,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and that's actually a metaphor, stepping back --

321
0:13:56.536,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and have a look at what we're doing.

322
0:13:58.923,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I'm playing around with metaphors.

323
0:14:00.611,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I'm playing around with perspectives and analogies.

324
0:14:03.107,000 --> 0:14:05,000
I'm telling one story in different ways.

325
0:14:05.472,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I'm telling stories.

326
0:14:06.706,000 --> 0:14:09,000
I'm making a narrative; I'm making several narratives.

327
0:14:09.914,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And I think all of these things make understanding possible.

328
0:14:13.46,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I think this actually is the essence of understanding something.

329
0:14:16.863,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I truly believe this.

330
0:14:18.181,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So this thing about changing your perspective --

331
0:14:20.608,000 --> 0:14:22,000
it's absolutely fundamental for humans.

332
0:14:23.829,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Let's play around with the Earth.

333
0:14:25.474,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Let's zoom into the ocean, have a look at the ocean.

334
0:14:28.007,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We can do this with anything.

335
0:14:29.973,000 --> 0:14:31,000
We can take the ocean and view it up close.

336
0:14:32.457,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We can look at the waves.

337
0:14:34.415,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We can go to the beach.

338
0:14:35.651,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We can view the ocean from another perspective.

339
0:14:37.938,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Every time we do this, we learn a little bit more about the ocean.

340
0:14:41.152,000 --> 0:14:43,000
If we go to the shore, we can kind of smell it, right?

341
0:14:43.765,000 --> 0:14:44,000
We can hear the sound of the waves.

342
0:14:45.499,000 --> 0:14:47,000
We can feel salt on our tongues.

343
0:14:47.569,000 --> 0:14:49,000
So all of these are different perspectives.

344
0:14:50.483,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And this is the best one.

345
0:14:51.771,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We can go into the water.

346
0:14:53.438,000 --> 0:14:55,000
We can see the water from the inside.

347
0:14:55.471,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And you know what?

348
0:14:56.673,000 --> 0:14:59,000
This is absolutely essential in mathematics and computer science.

349
0:14:59.778,000 --> 0:15:01,000
If you're able to view a structure from the inside,

350
0:15:02.757,000 --> 0:15:04,000
then you really learn something about it.

351
0:15:05.351,000 --> 0:15:07,000
That's somehow the essence of something.

352
0:15:07.883,000 --> 0:15:1,000
So when we do this, and we've taken this journey

353
0:15:11.55,000 --> 0:15:12,000
into the ocean,

354
0:15:12.747,000 --> 0:15:13,000
we use our imagination.

355
0:15:14.661,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And I think this is one level deeper,

356
0:15:17.338,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and it's actually a requirement for changing your perspective.

357
0:15:21.818,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We can do a little game.

358
0:15:23.009,000 --> 0:15:25,000
You can imagine that you're sitting there.

359
0:15:25.074,000 --> 0:15:28,000
You can imagine that you're up here, and that you're sitting here.

360
0:15:28.325,000 --> 0:15:3,000
You can view yourselves from the outside.

361
0:15:30.675,000 --> 0:15:31,000
That's really a strange thing.

362
0:15:32.637,000 --> 0:15:33,000
You're changing your perspective.

363
0:15:34.484,000 --> 0:15:35,000
You're using your imagination,

364
0:15:36.367,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and you're viewing yourself from the outside.

365
0:15:39.073,000 --> 0:15:41,000
That requires imagination.

366
0:15:41.126,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Mathematics and computer science are the most imaginative art forms ever.

367
0:15:46.884,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And this thing about changing perspectives

368
0:15:49.09,000 --> 0:15:51,000
should sound a little bit familiar to you,

369
0:15:51.622,000 --> 0:15:53,000
because we do it every day.

370
0:15:54.604,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And then it's called empathy.

371
0:15:56.954,000 --> 0:15:58,000
When I view the world from your perspective,

372
0:16:00.939,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I have empathy with you.

373
0:16:02.629,000 --> 0:16:03,000
If I really, truly understand

374
0:16:04.501,000 --> 0:16:07,000
what the world looks like from your perspective,

375
0:16:07.603,000 --> 0:16:08,000
I am empathetic.

376
0:16:09.098,000 --> 0:16:11,000
That requires imagination.

377
0:16:11.827,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And that is how we obtain understanding.

378
0:16:15.206,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And this is all over mathematics and this is all over computer science,

379
0:16:18.983,000 --> 0:16:23,000
and there's a really deep connection between empathy and these sciences.

380
0:16:25.288,000 --> 0:16:27,000
So my conclusion is the following:

381
0:16:29.931,000 --> 0:16:31,000
understanding something really deeply

382
0:16:32.177,000 --> 0:16:34,000
has to do with the ability to change your perspective.

383
0:16:35.894,000 --> 0:16:38,000
So my advice to you is: try to change your perspective.

384
0:16:39.507,000 --> 0:16:4,000
You can study mathematics.

385
0:16:41.08,000 --> 0:16:43,000
It's a wonderful way to train your brain.

386
0:16:44.663,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Changing your perspective makes your mind more flexible.

387
0:16:48.495,000 --> 0:16:49,000
It makes you open to new things,

388
0:16:50.353,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and it makes you able to understand things.

389
0:16:53.202,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And to use yet another metaphor:

390
0:16:55.243,000 --> 0:16:56,000
have a mind like water.

391
0:16:56.748,000 --> 0:16:57,000
That's nice.

392
0:16:57.923,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Thank you.

393
0:16:59.104,000 --> 0:17:03,000
(Applause)

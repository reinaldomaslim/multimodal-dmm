1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:27,000
When I'm starting talks like this,

2
0:00:27,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I usually do a whole spiel about sustainability

3
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
because a lot of people out there don't know what that is.

4
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This is a crowd that does know what it is,

5
0:00:34,000 --> 0:00:38,000
so I'll like just do like the 60-second crib-note version. Right?

6
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:4,000
So just bear with me. We'll go real fast, you know?

7
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Fill in the blanks.

8
0:00:41,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So, you know, sustainability, small planet.

9
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Right? Picture a little Earth, circling around the sun.

10
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You know, about a million years ago,

11
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:49,000
a bunch of monkeys fell out of trees,

12
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:51,000
got a little clever, harnessed fire,

13
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:52,000
invented the printing press,

14
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
made, you know, luggage with wheels on it.

15
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And, you know, built the society that we now live in.

16
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Unfortunately, while this society is, without a doubt,

17
0:01:01,000 --> 0:01:05,000
the most prosperous and dynamic the world has ever created,

18
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:08,000
it's got some major, major flaws.

19
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:12,000
One of them is that every society has an ecological footprint.

20
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It has an amount of impact on the planet that's measurable.

21
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
How much stuff goes through your life,

22
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
how much waste is left behind you.

23
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And we, at the moment, in our society,

24
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
have a really dramatically unsustainable level of this.

25
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:31,000
We're using up about five planets.

26
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:34,000
If everybody on the planet lived the way we did,

27
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we'd need between five, six, seven,

28
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
some people even say 10 planets to make it.

29
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Clearly we don't have 10 planets.

30
0:01:41,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Again, you know, mental, visual, 10 planets, one planet,

31
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:45,000
10 planets, one planet. Right?

32
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
We don't have that. So that's one problem.

33
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The second problem is that the planet that we have

34
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is being used in wildly unfair ways. Right?

35
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:57,000
North Americans, such as myself, you know,

36
0:01:57,000 --> 0:01:59,000
we're basically sort of wallowing, gluttonous hogs,

37
0:01:59,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and we're eating all sorts of stuff.

38
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And, you know, then you get all the way down

39
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to people who live in the Asia-Pacific region, or even more, Africa.

40
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And people simply do not have enough to survive.

41
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This is producing all sorts of tensions,

42
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:14,000
all sorts of dynamics that are deeply disturbing.

43
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And there's more and more people on the way. Right?

44
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So, this is what the planet's going to look like in 20 years.

45
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:25,000
It's going to be a pretty crowded place, at least eight billion people.

46
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So to make matters even more difficult, it's a very young planet.

47
0:02:29,000 --> 0:02:32,000
A third of the people on this planet are kids.

48
0:02:32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And those kids are growing up in a completely different way

49
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
than their parents did, no matter where they live.

50
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They've been exposed to this idea of our society, of our prosperity.

51
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And they may not want to live exactly like us.

52
0:02:45,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They may not want to be Americans, or Brits,

53
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:49,000
or Germans, or South Africans,

54
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but they want their own version

55
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of a life which is more prosperous, and more dynamic,

56
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and more, you know, enjoyable.

57
0:02:55,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And all of these things combine to create

58
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
an enormous amount of torque on the planet.

59
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And if we cannot figure out a way to deal with that torque,

60
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we are going to find ourselves more and more and more quickly

61
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
facing situations which are simply unthinkable.

62
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Everybody in this room has heard the worst-case scenarios.

63
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I don't need to go into that.

64
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But I will ask the question, what's the alternative?

65
0:03:18,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And I would say that, at the moment, the alternative is unimaginable.

66
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You know, so on the one hand we have the unthinkable;

67
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
on the other hand we have the unimaginable.

68
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:31,000
We don't know yet how to build a society

69
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:33,000
which is environmentally sustainable,

70
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
which is shareable with everybody on the planet,

71
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which promotes stability and democracy and human rights,

72
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and which is achievable in the time-frame necessary

73
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to make it through the challenges we face.

74
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
We don't know how to do this yet.

75
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So what's Worldchanging?

76
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Well, Worldchanging you might think of

77
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:57,000
as being a bit of a news service for the unimaginable future.

78
0:03:57,000 --> 0:03:59,000
You know, what we're out there doing is looking

79
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:02,000
for examples of tools, models and ideas,

80
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:06,000
which, if widely adopted, would change the game.

81
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
A lot of times, when I do a talk like this, I talk about things

82
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that everybody in this room I'm sure has already heard of,

83
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but most people haven't.

84
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
So I thought today I'd do something a little different,

85
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and talk about what we're looking for, rather than saying, you know,

86
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
rather than giving you tried-and-true examples.

87
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Talk about the kinds of things we're scoping out.

88
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Give you a little peek into our editorial notebook.

89
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And given that I have 13 minutes to do this, this is going to go kind of quick.

90
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So, I don't know, just stick with me. Right?

91
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So, first of all, what are we looking for? Bright Green city.

92
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:37,000
One of the biggest levers that we have in the developed world

93
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:39,000
for changing the impact that we have on the planet

94
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is changing the way that we live in cities.

95
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We're already an urban planet;

96
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that's especially true in the developed world.

97
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And people who live in cities in the developed world

98
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:49,000
tend to be very prosperous, and thus use a lot of stuff.

99
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
If we can change the dynamic,

100
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
by first of all creating cities that are denser and more livable ...

101
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Here, for example, is Vancouver, which if you haven't been there,

102
0:04:56,000 --> 0:04:58,000
you ought to go for a visit. It's a fabulous city.

103
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
And they are doing density, new density,

104
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
better than probably anybody else on the planet right now.

105
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
They're actually managing to talk North Americans out of driving cars,

106
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:07,000
which is a pretty great thing.

107
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So you have density. You also have growth management.

108
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:12,000
You leave aside what is natural to be natural.

109
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
This is in Portland. That is an actual development.

110
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:17,000
That land there will remain pasture in perpetuity.

111
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:19,000
They've bounded the city with a line.

112
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Nature, city. Nothing changes.

113
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Once you do those things, you can start making all sorts of investments.

114
0:05:25,000 --> 0:05:27,000
You can start doing things like, you know,

115
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:3,000
transit systems that actually work to transport people,

116
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
in effective and reasonably comfortable manners.

117
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You can also start to change what you build.

118
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:38,000
This is the Beddington Zero Energy Development in London,

119
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
which is one of the greenest buildings in the world. It's a fabulous place.

120
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
We're able to now build buildings that generate all their own electricity,

121
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that recycle much of their water,

122
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that are much more comfortable than standard buildings,

123
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:53,000
use all-natural light, etc., and, over time, cost less.

124
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Green roofs. Bill McDonough covered that last night, so I won't dwell on that too much.

125
0:05:57,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But once you also have people living

126
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
in close proximity to each other,

127
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:03,000
one of the things you can do is --

128
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
as information technologies develop --

129
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you can start to have smart places.

130
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:09,000
You can start to know where things are.

131
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:11,000
When you know where things are, it becomes easier to share them.

132
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:14,000
When you share them, you end up using less.

133
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So one great example is car-share clubs,

134
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
which are really starting to take off in the U.S.,

135
0:06:18,000 --> 0:06:21,000
have already taken off in many places in Europe, and are a great example.

136
0:06:21,000 --> 0:06:23,000
If you're somebody who drives, you know, one day a week,

137
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
do you really need your own car?

138
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Another thing that information technology lets us do

139
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:3,000
is start figuring out how to use less stuff

140
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:35,000
by knowing, and by monitoring, the amount we're actually using.

141
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So, here's a power cord which glows brighter the more energy that you use,

142
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:4,000
which I think is a pretty cool concept,

143
0:06:4,000 --> 0:06:42,000
although I think it ought to work the other way around,

144
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that it gets brighter the more you don't use.

145
0:06:45,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But, you know, there may even be a simpler approach.

146
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We could just re-label things.

147
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This light switch that reads, on the one hand, flashfloods,

148
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and on the other hand, off.

149
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
How we build things can change as well.

150
0:06:55,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This is a bio-morphic building.

151
0:06:57,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It takes its inspiration in form from life.

152
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Many of these buildings are incredibly beautiful,

153
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and also much more effective.

154
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:08,000
This is an example of bio-mimicry,

155
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:1,000
which is something we're really starting to look a lot more for.

156
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
In this case, you have a shell design

157
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:16,000
which was used to create a new kind of exhaust fan, which is greatly more effective.

158
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
There's a lot of this stuff happening; it's really pretty remarkable.

159
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I encourage you to look on Worldchanging if you're into it.

160
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We're starting to cover this more and more.

161
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
There's also neo-biological design,

162
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
where more and more we're actually using life itself

163
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and the processes of life to become part of our industry.

164
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So this, for example, is hydrogen-generating algae.

165
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So we have a model in potential, an emerging model that we're looking for

166
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:41,000
of how to take the cities most of us live in,

167
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and turn them into Bright Green cities.

168
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But unfortunately, most of the people on the planet don't live in the cites we live in.

169
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:51,000
They live in the emerging megacities of the developing world.

170
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And there's a statistic I often like to use,

171
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:56,000
which is that we're adding a city of Seattle every four days,

172
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
a city the size of Seattle to the planet every four days.

173
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I was giving a talk about two months ago,

174
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and this guy, who'd done some work with the U.N., came up to me

175
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and was really flustered, and he said, look,

176
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:07,000
you've got that totally wrong; it's totally wrong.

177
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:09,000
It's every seven days.

178
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So, we're adding a city the size of Seattle every seven days,

179
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and most of those cities look more like this than the city that you or I live in.

180
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Most of those cites are growing incredibly quickly.

181
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They don't have existing infrastructure;

182
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:25,000
they have enormous numbers of people who are struggling with poverty,

183
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and enormous numbers of people are trying to figure out

184
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:29,000
how to do things in new ways.

185
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So what do we need in order to make developing nation

186
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
megacities into Bright Green megacities?

187
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Well, the first thing we need is, we need leapfrogging.

188
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And this is one of the things that we are looking for everywhere.

189
0:08:42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
The idea behind leapfrogging is that

190
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:47,000
if you are a person, or a country, who is stuck in a situation

191
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:5,000
where you don't have the tools and technologies that you need,

192
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:56,000
there's no reason for you to invest in last generation's technologies. Right?

193
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
That you're much better off, almost universally,

194
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:03,000
looking for a low-cost or locally applicable version of the newest technology.

195
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:07,000
One place we're all familiar with seeing this is with cell phones. Right?

196
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:11,000
All throughout the developing world, people are going directly to cell phones,

197
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:13,000
skipping the whole landline stage.

198
0:09:13,000 --> 0:09:15,000
If there are landlines in many developing world cities,

199
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:18,000
they're usually pretty crappy systems that break down a lot

200
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and cost enormous amounts of money.

201
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So I rather like this picture here.

202
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I particularly like the Ganesh in the background, talking on the cell phone.

203
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So what we have, increasingly, is cell phones just permeating out through society.

204
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We've heard all about this here this week,

205
0:09:32,000 --> 0:09:34,000
so I won't say too much more than that, other than to say

206
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:39,000
what is true for cell phones is true for all sorts of technologies.

207
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The second thing is tools for collaboration,

208
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:45,000
be they systems of collaboration, or intellectual property systems

209
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:47,000
which encourage collaboration. Right?

210
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:51,000
When you have free ability for people to freely work together and innovate,

211
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
you get different kinds of solutions.

212
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And those solutions are accessible in a different way

213
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
to people who don't have capital. Right?

214
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So, you know, we have open source software,

215
0:10:01,000 --> 0:10:06,000
we have Creative Commons and other kinds of Copyleft solutions.

216
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And those things lead to things like this.

217
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:11,000
This is a Telecentro in Sao Paulo.

218
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
This is a pretty remarkable program

219
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:17,000
using free and open source software, cheap, sort of hacked-together machines,

220
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and basically sort of abandoned buildings --

221
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:22,000
has put together a bunch of community centers

222
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:25,000
where people can come in, get high-speed internet access,

223
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:28,000
learn computer programming skills for free.

224
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And a quarter-million people every year use these now in Sao Paulo.

225
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And those quarter-million people are some of the poorest people in Sao Paolo.

226
0:10:36,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I particularly like the little Linux penguin in the back. (Laughter)

227
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:45,000
So one of the things that that's leading to is a sort of southern cultural explosion.

228
0:10:45,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And one of the things we're really, really interested in at Worldchanging

229
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:52,000
is the ways in which the south is re-identifying itself,

230
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and re-categorizing itself in ways

231
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that have less and less to do with most of us in this room.

232
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So it's not, you know, Bollywood isn't just answering Hollywood. Right?

233
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:06,000
You know, Brazilian music scene isn't just answering the major labels.

234
0:11:06,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It's doing something new. There's new things happening.

235
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:12,000
There's interplay between them. And, you know, you get amazing things.

236
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Like, I don't know if any of you have seen the movie "City of God?"

237
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Yeah, it's a fabulous movie if you haven't seen it.

238
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And it's all about this question, in a very artistic and indirect kind of way.

239
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
You have other radical examples

240
0:11:23,000 --> 0:11:26,000
where the ability to use cultural tools is spreading out.

241
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
These are people who have just been visited by

242
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
the Internet bookmobile in Uganda.

243
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And who are waving their first books in the air,

244
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:35,000
which, I just think that's a pretty cool picture. You know?

245
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So you also have the ability for people to start coming together

246
0:11:39,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and acting on their own behalf in political and civic ways,

247
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
in ways that haven't happened before.

248
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And as we heard last night, as we've heard earlier this week,

249
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:56,000
are absolutely, fundamentally vital to the ability to craft new solutions,

250
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is we've got to craft new political realities.

251
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And I would personally say that we have to craft new political realities,

252
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:08,000
not only in places like India, Afghanistan, Kenya, Pakistan,

253
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
what have you, but here at home as well.

254
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Another world is possible.

255
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And sort of the big motto of the anti-globalization movement. Right?

256
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We tweak that a lot.

257
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We talk about how another world isn't just possible; another world's here.

258
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
That it's not just that we have to sort of imagine

259
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:27,000
there being a different, vague possibility out there,

260
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:31,000
but we need to start acting a little bit more on that possibility.

261
0:12:31,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We need to start doing things like Lula, President of Brazil.

262
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:37,000
How many people knew of Lula before today?

263
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:41,000
OK, so, much, much better than the average crowd, I can tell you that.

264
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So Lula, he's full of problems, full of contradictions,

265
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:45,000
but one of the things that he's doing is,

266
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:51,000
he is putting forward an idea of how we engage in international relations that

267
0:12:51,000 --> 0:12:57,000
completely shifts the balance from the standard sort of north-south dialogue

268
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:01,000
into a whole new way of global collaboration.

269
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I would keep your eye on this fellow.

270
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Another example of this sort of second superpower thing

271
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:11,000
is the rise of these games that are what we call "serious play."

272
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We're looking a lot at this. This is spreading everywhere.

273
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:16,000
This is from "A Force More Powerful." It's a little screenshot.

274
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
"A Force More Powerful" is a video game that,

275
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
while you're playing it, it teaches you how to engage

276
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:23,000
in non-violent insurrection and regime change. (Laughter)

277
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Here's another one. This is from a game called "Food Force,"

278
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
which is a game that teaches children how to run a refugee camp.

279
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:34,000
These things are all contributing in a very dynamic way

280
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:39,000
to a huge rise in, especially in the developing world,

281
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:42,000
in people's interest in and passion for democracy.

282
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:45,000
We get so little news about the developing world

283
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that we often forget that there are literally

284
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
millions of people out there struggling to change things

285
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to be fairer, freer, more democratic, less corrupt.

286
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And, you know, we don't hear those stories enough.

287
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
But it's happening all over the place,

288
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and these tools are part of what's making it possible.

289
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Now when you add all those things together,

290
0:14:03,000 --> 0:14:05,000
when you add together leapfrogging and new kinds of tools,

291
0:14:05,000 --> 0:14:09,000
you know, second superpower stuff, etc., what do you get?

292
0:14:09,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Well, very quickly, you get a Bright Green future for the developing world.

293
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:17,000
You get, for example, green power spread throughout the world.

294
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:19,000
You get -- this is a building in Hyderabad, India.

295
0:14:19,000 --> 0:14:21,000
It's the greenest building in the world.

296
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
You get grassroots solutions, things that work

297
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:25,000
for people who have no capital or limited access.

298
0:14:25,000 --> 0:14:29,000
You get barefoot solar engineers carrying solar panels into the remote mountains.

299
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:31,000
You get access to distance medicine.

300
0:14:31,000 --> 0:14:34,000
These are Indian nurses learning how to use PDAs

301
0:14:34,000 --> 0:14:36,000
to access databases that have information

302
0:14:36,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that they don't have access to at home in a distant manner.

303
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:42,000
You get new tools for people in the developing world.

304
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:46,000
These are LED lights that help the roughly billion people out there,

305
0:14:46,000 --> 0:14:48,000
for whom nightfall means darkness,

306
0:14:48,000 --> 0:14:5,000
to have a new means of operating.

307
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:53,000
These are refrigerators that require no electricity;

308
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:55,000
they're pot within a pot design.

309
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And you get water solutions. Water's one of the most pressing problems.

310
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:,000
Here's a design for harvesting rainwater that's super cheap

311
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and available to people in the developing world.

312
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Here's a design for distilling water using sunlight.

313
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Here's a fog-catcher, which, if you live in a moist, jungle-like area,

314
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
will distill water from the air that's clean and drinkable.

315
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Here's a way of transporting water.

316
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I just love this, you know -- I mean carrying water is such a drag,

317
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and somebody just came up with the idea of well, what if you rolled it. Right?

318
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I mean, that's a great design.

319
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:28,000
This is a fabulous invention, LifeStraw.

320
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Basically you can suck any water through this

321
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and it will become drinkable by the time it hits your lips.

322
0:15:34,000 --> 0:15:37,000
So, you know, people who are in desperate straits can get this.

323
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:4,000
This is one of my favorite Worldchanging kinds of things ever.

324
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:43,000
This is a merry-go-round invented by the company Roundabout,

325
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:47,000
which pumps water as kids play. You know?

326
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Seriously -- give that one a hand, it's pretty great.

327
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And the same thing is true for people who are in absolute crisis. Right?

328
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:59,000
We're expecting to have upwards of 200 million refugees by the year 2020

329
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:01,000
because of climate change and political instability.

330
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:03,000
How do we help people like that?

331
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Well, there's all sorts of amazing new humanitarian designs

332
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:08,000
that are being developed in collaborative ways all across the planet.

333
0:16:08,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Some of those designs include models for acting,

334
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:14,000
such as new models for village instruction in the middle of refugee camps.

335
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:17,000
New models for pedagogy for the displaced.

336
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And we have new tools.

337
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:21,000
This is one of my absolute favorite things anywhere.

338
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Does anyone know what this is?

339
0:16:23,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Audience: It detects landmines.

340
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Alex Steffen: Exactly, this is a landmine-detecting flower.

341
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:3,000
If you are living in one of the places

342
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:33,000
where the roughly half-billion unaccounted for mines are scattered,

343
0:16:33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
you can fling these seeds out into the field.

344
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And as they grow up, they will grow up around the mines,

345
0:16:4,000 --> 0:16:43,000
their roots will detect the chemicals in them,

346
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and where the flowers turn red you don't step.

347
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Yeah, so seeds that could save your life. You know?

348
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:53,000
(Applause)

349
0:16:53,000 --> 0:16:55,000
I also love it because it seems to me

350
0:16:55,000 --> 0:17:01,000
that the example, the tools we use to change the world,

351
0:17:01,000 --> 0:17:04,000
ought to be beautiful in themselves.

352
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:06,000
You know, that it's not just enough to survive.

353
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:09,000
We've got to make something better than what we've got.

354
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:12,000
And I think that we will.

355
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Just to wrap up, in the immortal words of H.G. Wells,

356
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
I think that better things are on the way.

357
0:17:18,000 --> 0:17:22,000
I think that, in fact, that "all of the past is but the beginning of a beginning.

358
0:17:22,000 --> 0:17:24,000
All that the human mind has accomplished

359
0:17:24,000 --> 0:17:26,000
is but the dream before the awakening."

360
0:17:26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
I hope that that turns out to be true.

361
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:32,000
The people in this room have given me more confidence than ever that it will.

362
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Thank you very much.

363
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
(Applause)

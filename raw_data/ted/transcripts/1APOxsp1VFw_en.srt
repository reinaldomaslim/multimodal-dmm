1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My title: "Queerer than we can suppose: the strangeness of science."

2
0:00:31.416,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"Queerer than we can suppose" comes from J.B.S. Haldane, the famous biologist,

3
0:00:35.582,000 --> 0:00:39,000
who said, "Now, my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer

4
0:00:40.384,000 --> 0:00:44,000
than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.

5
0:00:44.848,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I suspect that there are more things in heaven and earth

6
0:00:47.603,000 --> 0:00:51,000
than are dreamed of, or can be dreamed of, in any philosophy."

7
0:00:54.213,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Richard Feynman compared the accuracy of quantum theories --

8
0:00:59.052,000 --> 0:01:,000
experimental predictions --

9
0:01:00.902,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to specifying the width of North America to within one hair's breadth of accuracy.

10
0:01:07.649,000 --> 0:01:11,000
This means that quantum theory has got to be, in some sense, true.

11
0:01:11.742,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Yet the assumptions that quantum theory needs to make

12
0:01:14.701,000 --> 0:01:17,000
in order to deliver those predictions are so mysterious

13
0:01:18.164,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that even Feynman himself was moved to remark,

14
0:01:21.942,000 --> 0:01:23,000
"If you think you understand quantum theory,

15
0:01:24.805,000 --> 0:01:26,000
you don't understand quantum theory."

16
0:01:28.67,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It's so queer that physicists resort to one or another

17
0:01:32.1,000 --> 0:01:34,000
paradoxical interpretation of it.

18
0:01:35.378,000 --> 0:01:39,000
David Deutsch, who's talking here, in "The Fabric of Reality,"

19
0:01:39.895,000 --> 0:01:44,000
embraces the many-worlds interpretation of quantum theory,

20
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:47,000
because the worst that you can say about it

21
0:01:47.045,000 --> 0:01:49,000
is that it's preposterously wasteful.

22
0:01:49.322,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It postulates a vast and rapidly growing number of universes existing in parallel,

23
0:01:55.751,000 --> 0:01:56,000
mutually undetectable,

24
0:01:57.586,000 --> 0:02:03,000
except through the narrow porthole of quantum mechanical experiments.

25
0:02:05.268,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And that's Richard Feynman.

26
0:02:08.395,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The biologist Lewis Wolpert believes

27
0:02:10.793,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that the queerness of modern physics

28
0:02:12.532,000 --> 0:02:13,000
is just an extreme example.

29
0:02:14.242,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Science, as opposed to technology,

30
0:02:16.566,000 --> 0:02:18,000
does violence to common sense.

31
0:02:19.787,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Every time you drink a glass of water, he points out,

32
0:02:22.914,000 --> 0:02:25,000
the odds are that you will imbibe at least one molecule

33
0:02:26.419,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that passed through the bladder of Oliver Cromwell.

34
0:02:29.401,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:31.232,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It's just elementary probability theory.

36
0:02:33.483,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

37
0:02:34.683,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The number of molecules per glassful is hugely greater

38
0:02:37.924,000 --> 0:02:4,000
than the number of glassfuls, or bladdersful, in the world.

39
0:02:41.734,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And of course, there's nothing special about Cromwell or bladders --

40
0:02:44.968,000 --> 0:02:46,000
you have just breathed in a nitrogen atom

41
0:02:47.421,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that passed through the right lung of the third iguanodon

42
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:53,000
to the left of the tall cycad tree.

43
0:02:56.555,000 --> 0:02:58,000
"Queerer than we can suppose."

44
0:02:59.807,000 --> 0:03:02,000
What is it that makes us capable of supposing anything,

45
0:03:03.35,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and does this tell us anything about what we can suppose?

46
0:03:07.724,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Are there things about the universe that will be forever beyond our grasp,

47
0:03:13.106,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but not beyond the grasp of some superior intelligence?

48
0:03:16.497,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Are there things about the universe

49
0:03:18.21,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that are, in principle, ungraspable by any mind,

50
0:03:22.481,000 --> 0:03:23,000
however superior?

51
0:03:25.422,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The history of science has been one long series of violent brainstorms,

52
0:03:30.183,000 --> 0:03:33,000
as successive generations have come to terms with

53
0:03:33.307,000 --> 0:03:35,000
increasing levels of queerness in the universe.

54
0:03:36.863,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We're now so used to the idea that the Earth spins,

55
0:03:39.937,000 --> 0:03:41,000
rather than the Sun moves across the sky,

56
0:03:42.292,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it's hard for us to realize

57
0:03:43.625,000 --> 0:03:46,000
what a shattering mental revolution that must have been.

58
0:03:47.631,000 --> 0:03:5,000
After all, it seems obvious that the Earth is large and motionless,

59
0:03:50.858,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the Sun, small and mobile.

60
0:03:52.661,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But it's worth recalling Wittgenstein's remark on the subject:

61
0:03:57.27,000 --> 0:04:,000
"Tell me," he asked a friend, "why do people always say

62
0:04:01.273,000 --> 0:04:05,000
it was natural for man to assume that the Sun went 'round the Earth,

63
0:04:05.372,000 --> 0:04:07,000
rather than that the Earth was rotating?"

64
0:04:08.878,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And his friend replied, "Well, obviously,

65
0:04:10.895,000 --> 0:04:13,000
because it just looks as though the Sun is going round the Earth."

66
0:04:15.114,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Wittgenstein replied, "Well, what would it have looked like

67
0:04:18.9,000 --> 0:04:21,000
if it had looked as though the Earth was rotating?"

68
0:04:22.436,000 --> 0:04:25,000
(Laughter)

69
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Science has taught us, against all intuition,

70
0:04:30.051,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that apparently solid things, like crystals and rocks,

71
0:04:33.476,000 --> 0:04:36,000
are really almost entirely composed of empty space.

72
0:04:37.706,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom

73
0:04:42.025,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium,

74
0:04:45.164,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and the next atom is in the next sports stadium.

75
0:04:48.897,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So it would seem the hardest, solidest, densest rock

76
0:04:52.108,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is really almost entirely empty space,

77
0:04:55.721,000 --> 0:04:59,000
broken only by tiny particles so widely spaced they shouldn't count.

78
0:05:00.835,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Why, then, do rocks look and feel solid and hard and impenetrable?

79
0:05:06.199,000 --> 0:05:1,000
As an evolutionary biologist, I'd say this: our brains have evolved

80
0:05:10.898,000 --> 0:05:16,000
to help us survive within the orders of magnitude, of size and speed

81
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:18,000
which our bodies operate at.

82
0:05:19.185,000 --> 0:05:21,000
We never evolved to navigate in the world of atoms.

83
0:05:22.092,000 --> 0:05:25,000
If we had, our brains probably would perceive rocks

84
0:05:25.441,000 --> 0:05:26,000
as full of empty space.

85
0:05:26.911,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Rocks feel hard and impenetrable

86
0:05:29.379,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to our hands, precisely because objects like rocks and hands

87
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:35,000
cannot penetrate each other.

88
0:05:36.537,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It's therefore useful

89
0:05:38.353,000 --> 0:05:44,000
for our brains to construct notions like "solidity" and "impenetrability,"

90
0:05:44.503,000 --> 0:05:47,000
because such notions help us to navigate our bodies

91
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
through the middle-sized world in which we have to navigate.

92
0:05:52.644,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Moving to the other end of the scale,

93
0:05:54.445,000 --> 0:05:57,000
our ancestors never had to navigate through the cosmos

94
0:05:57.859,000 --> 0:05:59,000
at speeds close to the speed of light.

95
0:06:00.247,000 --> 0:06:04,000
If they had, our brains would be much better at understanding Einstein.

96
0:06:05.765,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I want to give the name "Middle World" to the medium-scaled environment

97
0:06:10.29,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in which we've evolved the ability to take act --

98
0:06:12.712,000 --> 0:06:13,000
nothing to do with "Middle Earth" --

99
0:06:14.463,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Middle World.

100
0:06:15.638,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Laughter)

101
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
We are evolved denizens of Middle World,

102
0:06:20.033,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and that limits what we are capable of imagining.

103
0:06:23.533,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We find it intuitively easy to grasp ideas like,

104
0:06:26.338,000 --> 0:06:28,000
when a rabbit moves at the sort of medium velocity

105
0:06:29.127,000 --> 0:06:31,000
at which rabbits and other Middle World objects move,

106
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and hits another Middle World object like a rock, it knocks itself out.

107
0:06:37.846,000 --> 0:06:42,000
May I introduce Major General Albert Stubblebine III,

108
0:06:43.632,000 --> 0:06:47,000
commander of military intelligence in 1983.

109
0:06:48.651,000 --> 0:06:53,000
"...[He] stared at his wall in Arlington, Virginia, and decided to do it.

110
0:06:54.445,000 --> 0:06:58,000
As frightening as the prospect was, he was going into the next office.

111
0:07:00.238,000 --> 0:07:03,000
He stood up and moved out from behind his desk.

112
0:07:05.088,000 --> 0:07:08,000
'What is the atom mostly made of?' he thought, 'Space.'

113
0:07:09.428,000 --> 0:07:14,000
He started walking. 'What am I mostly made of? Atoms.'

114
0:07:15.34,000 --> 0:07:17,000
He quickened his pace, almost to a jog now.

115
0:07:18.181,000 --> 0:07:2,000
'What is the wall mostly made of?'

116
0:07:20.55,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

117
0:07:21.575,000 --> 0:07:22,000
'Atoms!'

118
0:07:23.588,000 --> 0:07:26,000
All I have to do is merge the spaces.

119
0:07:28.056,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Then, General Stubblebine banged his nose hard on the wall of his office.

120
0:07:34.339,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Stubblebine, who commanded 16,000 soldiers,

121
0:07:38.302,000 --> 0:07:41,000
was confounded by his continual failure to walk through the wall.

122
0:07:42.253,000 --> 0:07:45,000
He has no doubt that this ability will one day be a common tool

123
0:07:45.345,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in the military arsenal.

124
0:07:46.996,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Who would screw around with an army that could do that?"

125
0:07:50.835,000 --> 0:07:51,000
That's from an article in Playboy,

126
0:07:52.828,000 --> 0:07:53,000
which I was reading the other day.

127
0:07:54.567,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Laughter)

128
0:07:56.198,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I have every reason to think it's true;

129
0:07:58.118,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I was reading Playboy because I, myself, had an article in it.

130
0:08:01.63,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Laughter)

131
0:08:07.515,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Unaided human intuition, schooled in Middle World,

132
0:08:12.189,000 --> 0:08:15,000
finds it hard to believe Galileo when he tells us

133
0:08:15.52,000 --> 0:08:18,000
a heavy object and a light object, air friction aside,

134
0:08:18.938,000 --> 0:08:19,000
would hit the ground at the same instant.

135
0:08:20.938,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And that's because in Middle World, air friction is always there.

136
0:08:24.516,000 --> 0:08:25,000
If we'd evolved in a vacuum,

137
0:08:25.889,000 --> 0:08:27,000
we would expect them to hit the ground simultaneously.

138
0:08:29.106,000 --> 0:08:3,000
If we were bacteria,

139
0:08:30.643,000 --> 0:08:33,000
constantly buffeted by thermal movements of molecules,

140
0:08:33.982,000 --> 0:08:34,000
it would be different.

141
0:08:35.157,000 --> 0:08:38,000
But we Middle-Worlders are too big to notice Brownian motion.

142
0:08:38.856,000 --> 0:08:41,000
In the same way, our lives are dominated by gravity,

143
0:08:42.23,000 --> 0:08:45,000
but are almost oblivious to the force of surface tension.

144
0:08:45.851,000 --> 0:08:47,000
A small insect would reverse these priorities.

145
0:08:50.067,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Steve Grand -- he's the one on the left,

146
0:08:52.544,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Douglas Adams is on the right.

147
0:08:54.123,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Steve Grand, in his book, "Creation: Life and How to Make It,"

148
0:08:57.845,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is positively scathing about our preoccupation with matter itself.

149
0:09:03.698,000 --> 0:09:06,000
We have this tendency to think that only solid, material things

150
0:09:07.361,000 --> 0:09:08,000
are really things at all.

151
0:09:09.811,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Waves of electromagnetic fluctuation in a vacuum seem unreal.

152
0:09:14.75,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Victorians thought the waves had to be waves in some material medium:

153
0:09:19.62,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the ether.

154
0:09:21.38,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But we find real matter comforting

155
0:09:23.771,000 --> 0:09:26,000
only because we've evolved to survive in Middle World,

156
0:09:27.762,000 --> 0:09:29,000
where matter is a useful fiction.

157
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:35,000
A whirlpool, for Steve Grand, is a thing with just as much reality

158
0:09:35.262,000 --> 0:09:36,000
as a rock.

159
0:09:37.978,000 --> 0:09:39,000
In a desert plain in Tanzania,

160
0:09:40.652,000 --> 0:09:43,000
in the shadow of the volcano Ol Doinyo Lengai,

161
0:09:43.866,000 --> 0:09:45,000
there's a dune made of volcanic ash.

162
0:09:46.651,000 --> 0:09:49,000
The beautiful thing is that it moves bodily.

163
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:52,000
It's what's technically known as a "barchan,"

164
0:09:52.231,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and the entire dune walks across the desert in a westerly direction

165
0:09:56.459,000 --> 0:09:59,000
at a speed of about 17 meters per year.

166
0:09:59.825,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It retains its crescent shape and moves in the direction of the horns.

167
0:10:04.34,000 --> 0:10:07,000
What happens is that the wind blows the sand up the shallow slope

168
0:10:08.34,000 --> 0:10:09,000
on the other side,

169
0:10:09.572,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and then, as each sand grain hits the top of the ridge, it cascades down

170
0:10:13.341,000 --> 0:10:14,000
on the inside of the crescent,

171
0:10:14.823,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and so the whole horn-shaped dune moves.

172
0:10:19.803,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Steve Grand points out that you and I are, ourselves,

173
0:10:23.317,000 --> 0:10:25,000
more like a wave than a permanent thing.

174
0:10:26.877,000 --> 0:10:27,000
He invites us, the reader,

175
0:10:28.752,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to think of an experience from your childhood,

176
0:10:31.181,000 --> 0:10:32,000
something you remember clearly,

177
0:10:32.763,000 --> 0:10:35,000
something you can see, feel, maybe even smell,

178
0:10:35.821,000 --> 0:10:36,000
as if you were really there.

179
0:10:37.56,000 --> 0:10:4,000
After all, you really were there at the time, weren't you?

180
0:10:41.357,000 --> 0:10:43,000
How else would you remember it?

181
0:10:43.485,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But here is the bombshell: You weren't there.

182
0:10:46.167,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Not a single atom that is in your body today

183
0:10:48.608,000 --> 0:10:5,000
was there when that event took place.

184
0:10:51.142,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Matter flows from place to place

185
0:10:53.309,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and momentarily comes together to be you.

186
0:10:56.261,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Whatever you are, therefore,

187
0:10:57.637,000 --> 0:11:01,000
you are not the stuff of which you are made.

188
0:11:01.743,000 --> 0:11:04,000
If that doesn't make the hair stand up on the back of your neck,

189
0:11:04.815,000 --> 0:11:07,000
read it again until it does, because it is important.

190
0:11:09.283,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So "really" isn't a word that we should use with simple confidence.

191
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
If a neutrino had a brain,

192
0:11:16.296,000 --> 0:11:18,000
which it evolved in neutrino-sized ancestors,

193
0:11:19.062,000 --> 0:11:23,000
it would say that rocks really do consist of empty space.

194
0:11:23.833,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We have brains that evolved in medium-sized ancestors

195
0:11:26.65,000 --> 0:11:28,000
which couldn't walk through rocks.

196
0:11:29.03,000 --> 0:11:33,000
"Really," for an animal, is whatever its brain needs it to be

197
0:11:33.674,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in order to assist its survival.

198
0:11:36.075,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And because different species live in different worlds,

199
0:11:38.846,000 --> 0:11:42,000
there will be a discomforting variety of "reallys."

200
0:11:45.37,000 --> 0:11:49,000
What we see of the real world is not the unvarnished world,

201
0:11:49.631,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but a model of the world, regulated and adjusted by sense data,

202
0:11:53.936,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but constructed so it's useful for dealing with the real world.

203
0:11:58.459,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The nature of the model depends on the kind of animal we are.

204
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:05,000
A flying animal needs a different kind of model

205
0:12:05.657,000 --> 0:12:07,000
from a walking, climbing or swimming animal.

206
0:12:08.381,000 --> 0:12:12,000
A monkey's brain must have software capable of simulating

207
0:12:12.825,000 --> 0:12:15,000
a three-dimensional world of branches and trunks.

208
0:12:16.144,000 --> 0:12:2,000
A mole's software for constructing models of its world will be customized

209
0:12:20.545,000 --> 0:12:21,000
for underground use.

210
0:12:22.521,000 --> 0:12:25,000
A water strider's brain doesn't need 3D software at all,

211
0:12:26.412,000 --> 0:12:28,000
since it lives on the surface of the pond,

212
0:12:28.586,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in an Edwin Abbott flatland.

213
0:12:32.652,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I've speculated that bats may see color with their ears.

214
0:12:37.39,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The world model that a bat needs in order to navigate

215
0:12:40.608,000 --> 0:12:41,000
through three dimensions catching insects

216
0:12:42.609,000 --> 0:12:45,000
must be pretty similar to the world model that any flying bird --

217
0:12:45.706,000 --> 0:12:48,000
a day-flying bird like a swallow -- needs to perform the same kind of tasks.

218
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
The fact that the bat uses echoes in pitch darkness

219
0:12:53.314,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to input the current variables to its model,

220
0:12:56.105,000 --> 0:12:58,000
while the swallow uses light, is incidental.

221
0:12:59.456,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Bats, I've even suggested, use perceived hues, such as red and blue,

222
0:13:04.758,000 --> 0:13:1,000
as labels, internal labels, for some useful aspect of echoes --

223
0:13:10.897,000 --> 0:13:14,000
perhaps the acoustic texture of surfaces, furry or smooth and so on --

224
0:13:15.468,000 --> 0:13:19,000
in the same way as swallows or indeed, we, use those perceived hues --

225
0:13:20.055,000 --> 0:13:21,000
redness and blueness, etc. --

226
0:13:21.683,000 --> 0:13:23,000
to label long and short wavelengths of light.

227
0:13:24.579,000 --> 0:13:27,000
There's nothing inherent about red that makes it long wavelength.

228
0:13:28.747,000 --> 0:13:32,000
The point is that the nature of the model is governed by how it is to be used,

229
0:13:32.995,000 --> 0:13:35,000
rather than by the sensory modality involved.

230
0:13:37.871,000 --> 0:13:39,000
J.B.S. Haldane himself had something to say about animals

231
0:13:40.715,000 --> 0:13:42,000
whose world is dominated by smell.

232
0:13:43.535,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Dogs can distinguish two very similar fatty acids, extremely diluted:

233
0:13:49.393,000 --> 0:13:51,000
caprylic acid and caproic acid.

234
0:13:52.101,000 --> 0:13:53,000
The only difference, you see,

235
0:13:53.523,000 --> 0:13:56,000
is that one has an extra pair of carbon atoms in the chain.

236
0:13:56.831,000 --> 0:14:,000
Haldane guesses that a dog would probably be able to place the acids

237
0:14:01.343,000 --> 0:14:04,000
in the order of their molecular weights by their smells,

238
0:14:04.811,000 --> 0:14:07,000
just as a man could place a number of piano wires

239
0:14:07.957,000 --> 0:14:1,000
in the order of their lengths by means of their notes.

240
0:14:11.726,000 --> 0:14:14,000
Now, there's another fatty acid, capric acid,

241
0:14:15.537,000 --> 0:14:16,000
which is just like the other two,

242
0:14:17.173,000 --> 0:14:19,000
except that it has two more carbon atoms.

243
0:14:20.481,000 --> 0:14:22,000
A dog that had never met capric acid would, perhaps,

244
0:14:23.328,000 --> 0:14:25,000
have no more trouble imagining its smell

245
0:14:26.305,000 --> 0:14:29,000
than we would have trouble imagining a trumpet, say,

246
0:14:29.485,000 --> 0:14:33,000
playing one note higher than we've heard a trumpet play before.

247
0:14:36.549,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Perhaps dogs and rhinos and other smell-oriented animals smell in color.

248
0:14:43.268,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And the argument would be exactly the same as for the bats.

249
0:14:48.253,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Middle World -- the range of sizes and speeds

250
0:14:51.964,000 --> 0:14:54,000
which we have evolved to feel intuitively comfortable with --

251
0:14:55.576,000 --> 0:14:58,000
is a bit like the narrow range of the electromagnetic spectrum

252
0:14:59.368,000 --> 0:15:01,000
that we see as light of various colors.

253
0:15:02.22,000 --> 0:15:04,000
We're blind to all frequencies outside that,

254
0:15:04.564,000 --> 0:15:06,000
unless we use instruments to help us.

255
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Middle World is the narrow range of reality

256
0:15:12.166,000 --> 0:15:15,000
which we judge to be normal, as opposed to the queerness

257
0:15:15.444,000 --> 0:15:18,000
of the very small, the very large and the very fast.

258
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We could make a similar scale of improbabilities;

259
0:15:22.873,000 --> 0:15:24,000
nothing is totally impossible.

260
0:15:25.508,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Miracles are just events that are extremely improbable.

261
0:15:29.23,000 --> 0:15:31,000
A marble statue could wave its hand at us;

262
0:15:32.083,000 --> 0:15:34,000
the atoms that make up its crystalline structure

263
0:15:34.97,000 --> 0:15:36,000
are all vibrating back and forth anyway.

264
0:15:37.211,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Because there are so many of them,

265
0:15:38.893,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and because there's no agreement among them

266
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:43,000
in their preferred direction of movement,

267
0:15:43.1,000 --> 0:15:47,000
the marble, as we see it in Middle World, stays rock steady.

268
0:15:47.189,000 --> 0:15:49,000
But the atoms in the hand could all just happen to move

269
0:15:49.823,000 --> 0:15:51,000
the same way at the same time, and again and again.

270
0:15:52.471,000 --> 0:15:53,000
In this case, the hand would move,

271
0:15:54.144,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and we'd see it waving at us in Middle World.

272
0:15:57.951,000 --> 0:15:59,000
The odds against it, of course, are so great

273
0:16:00.561,000 --> 0:16:04,000
that if you set out writing zeros at the time of the origin of the universe,

274
0:16:05.065,000 --> 0:16:08,000
you still would not have written enough zeros to this day.

275
0:16:09.206,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Evolution in Middle World has not equipped us

276
0:16:12.258,000 --> 0:16:15,000
to handle very improbable events; we don't live long enough.

277
0:16:16.497,000 --> 0:16:2,000
In the vastness of astronomical space and geological time,

278
0:16:21.212,000 --> 0:16:23,000
that which seems impossible in Middle World

279
0:16:24.034,000 --> 0:16:26,000
might turn out to be inevitable.

280
0:16:28.135,000 --> 0:16:31,000
One way to think about that is by counting planets.

281
0:16:31.724,000 --> 0:16:33,000
We don't know how many planets there are in the universe,

282
0:16:34.43,000 --> 0:16:37,000
but a good estimate is about 10 to the 20, or 100 billion billion.

283
0:16:38.374,000 --> 0:16:42,000
And that gives us a nice way to express our estimate of life's improbability.

284
0:16:44.71,000 --> 0:16:47,000
We could make some sort of landmark points along a spectrum of improbability,

285
0:16:48.427,000 --> 0:16:52,000
which might look like the electromagnetic spectrum we just looked at.

286
0:16:53.568,000 --> 0:16:55,000
If life has arisen only once on any --

287
0:16:57.85,000 --> 0:17:02,000
life could originate once per planet, could be extremely common

288
0:17:03.097,000 --> 0:17:05,000
or it could originate once per star

289
0:17:05.685,000 --> 0:17:09,000
or once per galaxy or maybe only once in the entire universe,

290
0:17:10.701,000 --> 0:17:12,000
in which case it would have to be here.

291
0:17:12.91,000 --> 0:17:14,000
And somewhere up there would be the chance

292
0:17:14.985,000 --> 0:17:15,000
that a frog would turn into a prince,

293
0:17:16.81,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and similar magical things like that.

294
0:17:20.207,000 --> 0:17:23,000
If life has arisen on only one planet in the entire universe,

295
0:17:24.099,000 --> 0:17:27,000
that planet has to be our planet, because here we are talking about it.

296
0:17:28.119,000 --> 0:17:3,000
And that means that if we want to avail ourselves of it,

297
0:17:30.795,000 --> 0:17:33,000
we're allowed to postulate chemical events in the origin of life

298
0:17:34.656,000 --> 0:17:37,000
which have a probability as low as one in 100 billion billion.

299
0:17:39.036,000 --> 0:17:41,000
I don't think we shall have to avail ourselves of that,

300
0:17:41.693,000 --> 0:17:43,000
because I suspect that life is quite common in the universe.

301
0:17:44.684,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And when I say quite common, it could still be so rare

302
0:17:47.746,000 --> 0:17:51,000
that no one island of life ever encounters another,

303
0:17:51.895,000 --> 0:17:52,000
which is a sad thought.

304
0:17:54.665,000 --> 0:17:57,000
How shall we interpret "queerer than we can suppose?"

305
0:17:58.397,000 --> 0:18:,000
Queerer than can in principle be supposed,

306
0:18:00.676,000 --> 0:18:03,000
or just queerer than we can suppose, given the limitations

307
0:18:04.138,000 --> 0:18:08,000
of our brain's evolutionary apprenticeship in Middle World?

308
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Could we, by training and practice,

309
0:18:10.878,000 --> 0:18:12,000
emancipate ourselves from Middle World

310
0:18:13.092,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and achieve some sort of intuitive as well as mathematical understanding

311
0:18:17.759,000 --> 0:18:19,000
of the very small and the very large?

312
0:18:19.922,000 --> 0:18:21,000
I genuinely don't know the answer.

313
0:18:22.058,000 --> 0:18:25,000
I wonder whether we might help ourselves to understand, say, quantum theory,

314
0:18:25.716,000 --> 0:18:28,000
if we brought up children to play computer games

315
0:18:29,000 --> 0:18:3,000
beginning in early childhood,

316
0:18:30.606,000 --> 0:18:33,000
which had a make-believe world of balls going through two slits on a screen,

317
0:18:34.551,000 --> 0:18:37,000
a world in which the strange goings-on of quantum mechanics were enlarged

318
0:18:38.563,000 --> 0:18:39,000
by the computer's make-believe,

319
0:18:40.481,000 --> 0:18:43,000
so that they became familiar on the Middle-World scale of the stream.

320
0:18:44.35,000 --> 0:18:46,000
And similarly, a relativistic computer game,

321
0:18:46.928,000 --> 0:18:51,000
in which objects on the screen manifest the Lorentz contraction, and so on,

322
0:18:52.268,000 --> 0:18:56,000
to try to get ourselves -- to get children into the way of thinking about it.

323
0:18:57.124,000 --> 0:19:,000
I want to end by applying the idea of Middle World

324
0:19:01.029,000 --> 0:19:02,000
to our perceptions of each other.

325
0:19:03.735,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Most scientists today subscribe to a mechanistic view of the mind:

326
0:19:08.046,000 --> 0:19:11,000
we're the way we are because our brains are wired up as they are,

327
0:19:11.474,000 --> 0:19:12,000
our hormones are the way they are.

328
0:19:13.15,000 --> 0:19:15,000
We'd be different, our characters would be different,

329
0:19:15.685,000 --> 0:19:18,000
if our neuro-anatomy and our physiological chemistry were different.

330
0:19:19.868,000 --> 0:19:21,000
But we scientists are inconsistent.

331
0:19:22.424,000 --> 0:19:23,000
If we were consistent,

332
0:19:23.829,000 --> 0:19:26,000
our response to a misbehaving person, like a child-murderer,

333
0:19:27.166,000 --> 0:19:28,000
should be something like:

334
0:19:28.524,000 --> 0:19:31,000
this unit has a faulty component; it needs repairing.

335
0:19:31.794,000 --> 0:19:32,000
That's not what we say.

336
0:19:33,000 --> 0:19:37,000
What we say -- and I include the most austerely mechanistic among us,

337
0:19:37.187,000 --> 0:19:38,000
which is probably me --

338
0:19:38.425,000 --> 0:19:41,000
what we say is, "Vile monster, prison is too good for you."

339
0:19:42.259,000 --> 0:19:45,000
Or worse, we seek revenge, in all probability thereby triggering

340
0:19:46,000 --> 0:19:49,000
the next phase in an escalating cycle of counter-revenge,

341
0:19:49.594,000 --> 0:19:51,000
which we see, of course, all over the world today.

342
0:19:52.496,000 --> 0:19:54,000
In short, when we're thinking like academics,

343
0:19:54.796,000 --> 0:19:57,000
we regard people as elaborate and complicated machines,

344
0:19:58.119,000 --> 0:20:,000
like computers or cars.

345
0:20:00.663,000 --> 0:20:02,000
But when we revert to being human,

346
0:20:02.701,000 --> 0:20:05,000
we behave more like Basil Fawlty, who, we remember,

347
0:20:06.436,000 --> 0:20:07,000
thrashed his car to teach it a lesson,

348
0:20:08.299,000 --> 0:20:1,000
when it wouldn't start on "Gourmet Night."

349
0:20:10.598,000 --> 0:20:11,000
(Laughter)

350
0:20:12.308,000 --> 0:20:15,000
The reason we personify things like cars and computers

351
0:20:16.316,000 --> 0:20:19,000
is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world

352
0:20:19.708,000 --> 0:20:21,000
and moles live in an underground world

353
0:20:22.394,000 --> 0:20:25,000
and water striders live in a surface tension-dominated flatland,

354
0:20:26.232,000 --> 0:20:28,000
we live in a social world.

355
0:20:28.385,000 --> 0:20:3,000
We swim through a sea of people --

356
0:20:30.595,000 --> 0:20:32,000
a social version of Middle World.

357
0:20:33.562,000 --> 0:20:36,000
We are evolved to second-guess the behavior of others

358
0:20:37.301,000 --> 0:20:4,000
by becoming brilliant, intuitive psychologists.

359
0:20:41.464,000 --> 0:20:42,000
Treating people as machines

360
0:20:42.88,000 --> 0:20:45,000
may be scientifically and philosophically accurate,

361
0:20:46.419,000 --> 0:20:47,000
but it's a cumbersome waste of time

362
0:20:48.356,000 --> 0:20:51,000
if you want to guess what this person is going to do next.

363
0:20:52,000 --> 0:20:54,000
The economically useful way to model a person

364
0:20:55,000 --> 0:20:58,000
is to treat him as a purposeful, goal-seeking agent

365
0:20:58.635,000 --> 0:21:,000
with pleasures and pains, desires and intentions,

366
0:21:01.075,000 --> 0:21:02,000
guilt, blame-worthiness.

367
0:21:03.456,000 --> 0:21:07,000
Personification and the imputing of intentional purpose

368
0:21:07.59,000 --> 0:21:1,000
is such a brilliantly successful way to model humans,

369
0:21:11.257,000 --> 0:21:14,000
it's hardly surprising the same modeling software

370
0:21:14.402,000 --> 0:21:17,000
often seizes control when we're trying to think about entities

371
0:21:18,000 --> 0:21:21,000
for which it's not appropriate, like Basil Fawlty with his car

372
0:21:21.395,000 --> 0:21:25,000
or like millions of deluded people, with the universe as a whole.

373
0:21:26.717,000 --> 0:21:28,000
(Laughter)

374
0:21:29,000 --> 0:21:32,000
If the universe is queerer than we can suppose,

375
0:21:32.165,000 --> 0:21:34,000
is it just because we've been naturally selected

376
0:21:34.691,000 --> 0:21:36,000
to suppose only what we needed to suppose

377
0:21:37.684,000 --> 0:21:39,000
in order to survive in the Pleistocene of Africa?

378
0:21:40.863,000 --> 0:21:45,000
Or are our brains so versatile and expandable that we can train ourselves

379
0:21:46.587,000 --> 0:21:48,000
to break out of the box of our evolution?

380
0:21:49.909,000 --> 0:21:53,000
Or finally, are there some things in the universe so queer

381
0:21:54.346,000 --> 0:21:59,000
that no philosophy of beings, however godlike, could dream them?

382
0:22:00.737,000 --> 0:22:01,000
Thank you very much.

383
0:22:01.913,000 --> 0:22:03,000
(Applause)

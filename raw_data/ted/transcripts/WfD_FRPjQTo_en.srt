1
0:00:12.486,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Last year, I got a chance to watch the new "Star Wars" movie,

2
0:00:15.408,000 --> 0:00:16,000
which was fantastic,

3
0:00:16.587,000 --> 0:00:17,000
but one thing kept bugging me.

4
0:00:18.048,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I don't know if you noticed this or not.

5
0:00:20.004,000 --> 0:00:22,000
In this entirely technically advanced world,

6
0:00:22.108,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I did not see a single AED anywhere,

7
0:00:24.294,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which was totally shocking --

8
0:00:25.726,000 --> 0:00:27,000
almost as shocking as not knowing what an AED is,

9
0:00:28.071,000 --> 0:00:29,000
which you guys do know.

10
0:00:29.488,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But for those at home,

11
0:00:30.663,000 --> 0:00:33,000
an AED is an automated external defibrillator.

12
0:00:33.709,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It's the device you use when your heart goes into cardiac arrest

13
0:00:36.791,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to shock it back into a normal rhythm,

14
0:00:38.795,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or, as one of the guys I was teaching a class to referred to it as:

15
0:00:42.298,000 --> 0:00:43,000
"The shocky-hearty-box thing."

16
0:00:43.872,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:45.553,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But I really can't blame the Empire,

18
0:00:48.088,000 --> 0:00:49,000
since health and safety regulations

19
0:00:49.78,000 --> 0:00:51,000
aren't really their first order of business.

20
0:00:51.95,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Though, even if we --

21
0:00:54.088,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I think worse than not having an AED would be if there was one there,

22
0:00:57.951,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but just, no one knew where to find it.

23
0:01:00.023,000 --> 0:01:03,000
These devices can drastically increase your chance of survival --

24
0:01:03.837,000 --> 0:01:05,000
almost like a tauntaun on Hoth.

25
0:01:06.471,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:07.517,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But I'm pretty sure that stormtrooper is going to be toast,

27
0:01:10.719,000 --> 0:01:12,000
regardless if we have an AED or not,

28
0:01:12.928,000 --> 0:01:15,000
since what happens is the chest plate is going to be quite hard to get off,

29
0:01:16.669,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and like that tauntaun,

30
0:01:18.683,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the AED has a very short window of time at which it's highly effective.

31
0:01:22.119,000 --> 0:01:26,000
In this case -- basically, we've got to use it within the first 10 minutes.

32
0:01:26.531,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The Jedi, on the other hand, have no problems with their outfits.

33
0:01:29.657,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Those robes open straight up,

34
0:01:31.413,000 --> 0:01:33,000
you can place the pads right onto the chest --

35
0:01:33.947,000 --> 0:01:34,000
so upper-right-hand side of the chest,

36
0:01:35.849,000 --> 0:01:36,000
lower left,

37
0:01:37.032,000 --> 0:01:4,000
wait for the unit to determine if it's a shockable rhythm

38
0:01:40.204,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and get ready to shock.

39
0:01:41.746,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But, the Jedi do have a problem.

40
0:01:43.295,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They have a head appendage issue.

41
0:01:44.961,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And so I can be totally clear, thinking I'm ready to go,

42
0:01:48.18,000 --> 0:01:5,000
but I'm accidentally touching a tentacle

43
0:01:50.454,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and inadvertently shocking myself.

44
0:01:52.389,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter)

45
0:01:53.833,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So before you hit that button, make sure you are clear

46
0:01:58.395,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and everyone else is clear.

47
0:02:00.29,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Going back to that stormtrooper:

48
0:02:02.791,000 --> 0:02:04,000
If I did get that chest plate off in time,

49
0:02:05.213,000 --> 0:02:08,000
what would you do if you suddenly found there was a Wookiee under there,

50
0:02:09.067,000 --> 0:02:11,000
or possibly two Ewoks?

51
0:02:11.599,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:12.974,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Well, lucky for us,

53
0:02:14.271,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in the kit there's actually a razor,

54
0:02:16.495,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and we can use that to shave the chest on the upper right-hand side

55
0:02:20.074,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and the lower left.

56
0:02:22.571,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Wookiees also have another problem.

57
0:02:24.341,000 --> 0:02:25,000
They have an accessory issue.

58
0:02:25.793,000 --> 0:02:27,000
What we want to do is remove these --

59
0:02:28.373,000 --> 0:02:31,000
anything between the two pads we want to remove,

60
0:02:31.812,000 --> 0:02:33,000
since it can cause something called "arcing."

61
0:02:34.023,000 --> 0:02:35,000
For those who don't know what arcing is,

62
0:02:35.997,000 --> 0:02:36,000
do you remember the Emperor,

63
0:02:37.434,000 --> 0:02:39,000
when he shoots electricity out the ends of his fingers --

64
0:02:40.194,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

65
0:02:41.231,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that would be kind of like arcing.

66
0:02:42.886,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Another thing that --

67
0:02:44.061,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Oh! By the way, he creates that by wearing wool socks under his robes.

68
0:02:47.414,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

69
0:02:48.446,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We can also get arcing if we have an extremely wet chest.

70
0:02:51.587,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The electricity travels across the surface instead of through the heart.

71
0:02:55.054,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We can correct this with the immortal words of Douglas Adams:

72
0:02:57.977,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"Don't panic," which most of us have done today --

73
0:03:00.771,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and also always having a towel.

74
0:03:03.04,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So, good words to go by.

75
0:03:05.071,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The metal bikini -- unfortunately, this is where panic sets in --

76
0:03:08.854,000 --> 0:03:09,000
like the modern bra,

77
0:03:10.08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
we have to make sure we remove,

78
0:03:11.973,000 --> 0:03:15,000
because this can cause severe arcing along with burns.

79
0:03:16.868,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But unfortunately this opens up an issue

80
0:03:19.245,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that's almost as controversial as talking about the prequels.

81
0:03:22.192,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:23.312,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The mere mention of the word "nipples,"

83
0:03:25.222,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and people get into a little bit of a tizzy.

84
0:03:27.39,000 --> 0:03:29,000
By the way, that is not a nipple, that's a cupcake.

85
0:03:29.865,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Laughter)

86
0:03:32.312,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Chances are, if you do have to use this,

87
0:03:35.209,000 --> 0:03:36,000
this is going to be on someone you know.

88
0:03:37.171,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And remember, everyone has nipples,

89
0:03:38.895,000 --> 0:03:39,000
except for Jabba.

90
0:03:40.087,000 --> 0:03:41,000
(Laughter)

91
0:03:41.376,000 --> 0:03:43,000
But he does love cupcakes.

92
0:03:43.588,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Speaking about Jabba,

93
0:03:44.763,000 --> 0:03:46,000
if we do have to use an AED on him,

94
0:03:47.303,000 --> 0:03:48,000
remember pad placement is the same,

95
0:03:49.169,000 --> 0:03:5,000
even though he doesn't have nipples.

96
0:03:50.974,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So it's going to be upper right-hand side, lower left.

97
0:03:54.121,000 --> 0:03:57,000
If we were going through, we're shocking, getting ready to go --

98
0:03:57.317,000 --> 0:03:58,000
after we've done the shock,

99
0:03:58.688,000 --> 0:04:01,000
one of the things we need to do is remember to do compression.

100
0:04:01.758,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The preferred method is 30 compressions and two breaths

101
0:04:05.414,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in the center of the chest, between the nipples,

102
0:04:07.951,000 --> 0:04:08,000
pressing down at least two inches,

103
0:04:09.804,000 --> 0:04:1,000
no more than two and a half,

104
0:04:11.772,000 --> 0:04:14,000
at a rate of at least 100 beats a minute,

105
0:04:14.819,000 --> 0:04:15,000
no more than 120.

106
0:04:17.77,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Unfortunately, due to the size of Jabba's mouth

107
0:04:20.626,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and also what he puts in said mouth,

108
0:04:22.415,000 --> 0:04:26,000
we may not want to actually do the mouth-to-mouth part.

109
0:04:26.872,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So instead, we can do compression-only CPR.

110
0:04:29.377,000 --> 0:04:31,000
The way of remembering the compression-only part

111
0:04:31.841,000 --> 0:04:33,000
is we can actually use the Imperial March.

112
0:04:34.684,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I would sing it for you --

113
0:04:36.625,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

114
0:04:38.09,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Unfortunately, that would be more something an interrogation droid would do.

115
0:04:42.971,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Yoda.

116
0:04:44.217,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Small little guy, like a baby.

117
0:04:45.896,000 --> 0:04:47,000
What we do is basically treat him like a baby,

118
0:04:48.355,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in the sense that we're going to place one pad in the center of the chest

119
0:04:51.903,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and one in the back.

120
0:04:53.078,000 --> 0:04:54,000
If we place them both in the front,

121
0:04:54.77,000 --> 0:04:56,000
they can be too close and cause severe arcing,

122
0:04:57.364,000 --> 0:04:58,000
so we want to avoid that.

123
0:04:58.873,000 --> 0:05:,000
Hopefully, this helped to clarify

124
0:05:01.024,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and put some light on some of the darker issues

125
0:05:03.35,000 --> 0:05:05,000
of using an AED in the Star Wars universe,

126
0:05:05.594,000 --> 0:05:06,000
or any universe in total.

127
0:05:07.082,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I'll leave you with one point.

128
0:05:08.547,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Remember, if you do find yourself dealing with a Wookiee,

129
0:05:11.363,000 --> 0:05:12,000
do not shave the entire Wookiee.

130
0:05:13.035,000 --> 0:05:14,000
This takes way too much time,

131
0:05:14.525,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and it only pisses them off.

132
0:05:16.037,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

133
0:05:17.069,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Thank you very much.

134
0:05:18.257,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.691,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I was only nine

2
0:00:13.993,000 --> 0:00:17,000
when my grandfather first described to me the horrors he witnessed six years earlier

3
0:00:18.94,000 --> 0:00:2,000
when human stampedes killed 39 people

4
0:00:21.868,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in our hometown of Nashik, India.

5
0:00:24.461,000 --> 0:00:27,000
It was during the 2003 Nashik Kumbh Mela,

6
0:00:27.774,000 --> 0:00:29,000
one of the world's largest religious gatherings.

7
0:00:31.213,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Every 12 years, over 30 million Hindu worshippers

8
0:00:34.967,000 --> 0:00:35,000
descend upon our city --

9
0:00:36.57,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which is built only for 1.5 million people --

10
0:00:39.434,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and stay for 45 days.

11
0:00:41.601,000 --> 0:00:44,000
The main purpose is to wash away all their sins

12
0:00:44.696,000 --> 0:00:46,000
by bathing in the river Godavari.

13
0:00:47.807,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And stampedes may easily happen

14
0:00:50.069,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because a high-density crowd moves at a slow pace.

15
0:00:54.002,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Apart from Nashik, this event happens in three other places in India,

16
0:00:58.335,000 --> 0:00:59,000
with varying frequency,

17
0:01:00.078,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and between 2001 and 2014,

18
0:01:02.871,000 --> 0:01:07,000
over 2,400 lives have been lost in stampedes at these events.

19
0:01:09.362,000 --> 0:01:1,000
What saddened me the most

20
0:01:11.243,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is seeing people around me resigning to the city's fate

21
0:01:15.782,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in witnessing the seemingly inevitable deaths of dozens

22
0:01:19.631,000 --> 0:01:2,000
at every Kumbh Mela.

23
0:01:21.448,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I sought to change this,

24
0:01:22.902,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and I thought, why can't I try to find a solution to this?

25
0:01:25.901,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Because I knew it is wrong.

26
0:01:27.701,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Having learned coding at an early age and being a maker,

27
0:01:31.177,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I considered the wild idea --

28
0:01:32.869,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:34.081,000 --> 0:01:35,000
[Makers always find a way]

30
0:01:35.49,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I considered the wild idea of building a system

31
0:01:38.579,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that would help regulate the flow of people

32
0:01:41.065,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and use it in the next Kumbh Mela in 2015,

33
0:01:44.078,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to have fewer stampedes and, hopefully, fewer deaths.

34
0:01:48.177,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It seemed like a mission impossible,

35
0:01:50.672,000 --> 0:01:51,000
a dream too big,

36
0:01:52.464,000 --> 0:01:54,000
especially for a 15-year-old,

37
0:01:54.669,000 --> 0:01:57,000
yet that dream came true in 2015,

38
0:01:58.232,000 --> 0:02:01,000
when not only did we succeed

39
0:02:01.949,000 --> 0:02:03,000
in reducing the stampedes and their intensity,

40
0:02:04.925,000 --> 0:02:06,000
but we marked 2015

41
0:02:07.126,000 --> 0:02:11,000
as the first Nashik Kumbh Mela to have zero stampedes.

42
0:02:11.596,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Applause)

43
0:02:16.958,000 --> 0:02:18,000
It was the first time in recorded history

44
0:02:19.468,000 --> 0:02:21,000
that this event passed without any casualties.

45
0:02:22.888,000 --> 0:02:23,000
How did we do it?

46
0:02:24.623,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It all started when I joined an innovation workshop

47
0:02:27.678,000 --> 0:02:29,000
by MIT Media Lab in 2014

48
0:02:30.378,000 --> 0:02:31,000
called the Kumbhathon

49
0:02:32.371,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that aimed at solving challenges faced at the grand scale of Kumbh Mela.

50
0:02:37.784,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Now, we figured out to solve the stampede problem,

51
0:02:42.316,000 --> 0:02:44,000
we wanted to know only three things:

52
0:02:44.504,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the number of people, the location,

53
0:02:47.267,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and the rate of the flow of people per minute.

54
0:02:51.241,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So we started to look for technologies that would help us get these three things.

55
0:02:56.091,000 --> 0:03:,000
Can we distribute radio-frequency tokens to identify people?

56
0:03:00.369,000 --> 0:03:03,000
We figured out that it would be too expensive and impractical

57
0:03:03.806,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to distribute 30 million tags.

58
0:03:06.545,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Can you use CCTV cameras with image-processing techniques?

59
0:03:09.95,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Again, too expensive for that scale,

60
0:03:12.021,000 --> 0:03:14,000
along with the disadvantages of being non-portable

61
0:03:14.923,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and being completely useless in the case of rain,

62
0:03:17.765,000 --> 0:03:19,000
which is a common thing to happen in Kumbh Mela.

63
0:03:21.12,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Can we use cell phone tower data?

64
0:03:23.806,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It sounds like the perfect solution,

65
0:03:26.297,000 --> 0:03:27,000
but the funny part is,

66
0:03:28.094,000 --> 0:03:3,000
most of the people do not carry cell phones

67
0:03:30.863,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in events like Kumbh Mela.

68
0:03:32.887,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Also, the data wouldn't have been granular enough for us.

69
0:03:36.625,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So we wanted something that was real-time,

70
0:03:39.102,000 --> 0:03:42,000
low-cost, sturdy and waterproof,

71
0:03:42.443,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and it was easy to get the data for processing.

72
0:03:45.672,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So we built Ashioto,

73
0:03:48.052,000 --> 0:03:5,000
meaning "footstep" in Japanese,

74
0:03:50.161,000 --> 0:03:54,000
as it consists of a portable mat which has pressure sensors

75
0:03:54.37,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which can count the number of people walking on it,

76
0:03:56.885,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and sends the data over the internet

77
0:03:59.341,000 --> 0:04:01,000
to the advanced data analysis software we created.

78
0:04:02.483,000 --> 0:04:05,000
The possible errors, like overcounting or double-stepping,

79
0:04:05.795,000 --> 0:04:07,000
were overcome using design interventions.

80
0:04:08.803,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The optimum breadth of the mat was determined to be 18 inches,

81
0:04:12.353,000 --> 0:04:14,000
after we tested many different versions

82
0:04:14.616,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and observed the average stride length of a person.

83
0:04:18.111,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Otherwise, people might step over the sensor.

84
0:04:21.04,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We started with a proof of concept built in three days,

85
0:04:23.636,000 --> 0:04:25,000
made out of cardboard and aluminum foil.

86
0:04:26.534,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:27.559,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It worked, for real.

88
0:04:29.957,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We built another one with aluminum composite panels

89
0:04:32.671,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and piezoelectric plates,

90
0:04:34.333,000 --> 0:04:37,000
which are plates that generate a small pulse of electricity under pressure.

91
0:04:38.959,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We tested this at 30 different pilots in public,

92
0:04:42.252,000 --> 0:04:45,000
in crowded restaurants, in malls, in temples, etc.,

93
0:04:45.998,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to see how people reacted.

94
0:04:48.72,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And people let us run these pilots

95
0:04:50.767,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because they were excited to see localites work on problems for the city.

96
0:04:57.68,000 --> 0:05:,000
I was 15 and my team members were in their early 20s.

97
0:05:01.736,000 --> 0:05:05,000
When the sensors were colored,

98
0:05:06.251,000 --> 0:05:08,000
people would get scared and would ask us questions like,

99
0:05:09.116,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"Will I get electrocuted if I step on this?"

100
0:05:11.347,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:12.372,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Or, if it was very obvious that it was an electronic sensor on the ground,

102
0:05:16.768,000 --> 0:05:17,000
they would just jump over it.

103
0:05:18.285,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:19.385,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So we decided to design a cover for the sensor

105
0:05:22.473,000 --> 0:05:25,000
so that people don't have to worry what it is on the ground.

106
0:05:25.554,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So after some experimentation,

107
0:05:27.554,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we decided to use an industrial sensor,

108
0:05:30.388,000 --> 0:05:32,000
used as a safety trigger in hazardous areas

109
0:05:33.381,000 --> 0:05:34,000
as the sensor,

110
0:05:34.556,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and a black neoprene rubber sheet

111
0:05:36.661,000 --> 0:05:37,000
as the cover.

112
0:05:38.374,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Now, another added benefit of using black rubber

113
0:05:41.215,000 --> 0:05:44,000
was that dust naturally accumulates over the surface,

114
0:05:44.866,000 --> 0:05:46,000
eventually camouflaging it with the ground.

115
0:05:47.54,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We also had to make sure that the sensor is no higher than 12 millimeters.

116
0:05:53.206,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Otherwise, people might trip over it,

117
0:05:55.459,000 --> 0:05:56,000
which in itself would cause stampedes.

118
0:05:57.792,000 --> 0:06:,000
(Laughter)

119
0:06:01.603,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We don't want that.

120
0:06:02.989,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

121
0:06:04.802,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So we were able to design a sensor which was only 10 millimeters thick.

122
0:06:09.469,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Now the data is sent to the server in real time,

123
0:06:11.733,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and a heat map is plotted,

124
0:06:13.405,000 --> 0:06:16,000
taking into account all the active devices on the ground.

125
0:06:16.772,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The authorities could be alerted if the crowd movement slowed down

126
0:06:21.081,000 --> 0:06:24,000
or if the crowd density moved beyond a desired threshold.

127
0:06:24.992,000 --> 0:06:28,000
We installed five of these mats in the Nashik Kumbh Mela 2015,

128
0:06:30.008,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and counted over half a million people

129
0:06:32.422,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in 18 hours,

130
0:06:34.128,000 --> 0:06:38,000
ensuring that the data was available in real time at various checkpoints,

131
0:06:38.529,000 --> 0:06:39,000
ensuring a safe flow of people.

132
0:06:40.429,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Now, this system, eventually, with other innovations,

133
0:06:43.898,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is what helped prevent stampedes altogether at that festival.

134
0:06:47.585,000 --> 0:06:49,000
The code used by Ashioto during Kumbh Mela

135
0:06:50.482,000 --> 0:06:53,000
will soon be made publicly available, free to use for anyone.

136
0:06:53.918,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I would be glad if someone used this code

137
0:06:55.919,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to make many more gatherings safer.

138
0:06:58.878,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Having succeeded at Kumbh Mela

139
0:07:00.828,000 --> 0:07:03,000
has inspired me to help others who may also suffer from stampedes.

140
0:07:04.764,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The design of the system makes it adaptable

141
0:07:07.597,000 --> 0:07:08,000
to pretty much any event

142
0:07:09.615,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that involves an organized gathering of people.

143
0:07:13.435,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And my new dream is to improve, adapt and deploy the system

144
0:07:17.769,000 --> 0:07:22,000
all over the world to prevent loss of life and ensure a safe flow of people,

145
0:07:23.262,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because every human soul is precious,

146
0:07:26.073,000 --> 0:07:28,000
whether at concerts or sporting events,

147
0:07:28.475,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the Maha Kumbh Mela in Allahabad,

148
0:07:30.386,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the Hajj in Mecca,

149
0:07:31.861,000 --> 0:07:32,000
the Shia procession to Karbala

150
0:07:33.782,000 --> 0:07:34,000
or at the Vatican City.

151
0:07:35.893,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So what do you all think, can we do it?

152
0:07:37.794,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Audience) Yes!

153
0:07:38.969,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Thank you.

154
0:07:40.144,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Cheers)

155
0:07:41.169,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:14.286,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In 1994,

2
0:00:15.833,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein coauthored "The Bell Curve,"

3
0:00:20.071,000 --> 0:00:22,000
an extremely controversial book

4
0:00:22.196,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which claims that on average,

5
0:00:24.141,000 --> 0:00:27,000
some races are smarter and more likely to succeed than others.

6
0:00:28.117,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Murray and Herrnstein also suggest

7
0:00:30.831,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that a lack of critical intelligence explains the prominence of violent crime

8
0:00:35.447,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in poor African-American communities.

9
0:00:39.575,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But Charles Murray and Richard Herrnstein are not the only people who think this.

10
0:00:43.611,000 --> 0:00:44,000
In 2012,

11
0:00:45.162,000 --> 0:00:49,000
a writer, journalist and political commentator named John Derbyshire

12
0:00:49.738,000 --> 0:00:53,000
wrote an article that was supposed to be a non-black version of the talk

13
0:00:54.101,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that many black parents feel they have to give their kids today:

14
0:00:57.403,000 --> 0:00:59,000
advice on how to stay safe.

15
0:01:00.72,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In it, he offered suggestions such as:

16
0:01:03.776,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"Do not attend events likely to draw a lot of blacks,"

17
0:01:07.007,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"Stay out of heavily black neighborhoods"

18
0:01:09.847,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and "Do not act the Good Samaritan to blacks in distress."

19
0:01:13.8,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And yet, in 2016, I invited John Derbyshire

20
0:01:18.219,000 --> 0:01:19,000
as well as Charles Murray

21
0:01:19.919,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to speak at my school,

22
0:01:21.895,000 --> 0:01:25,000
knowing full well that I would be giving them a platform and attention

23
0:01:26.339,000 --> 0:01:28,000
for ideas that I despised and rejected.

24
0:01:30.315,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But this is just a further evolution

25
0:01:33.331,000 --> 0:01:35,000
of a journey of uncomfortable learning throughout my life.

26
0:01:37.192,000 --> 0:01:41,000
When I was 10 years old, my mother was diagnosed with schizophrenia,

27
0:01:42.403,000 --> 0:01:46,000
a mental illness characterized by mood swings and paranoid delusions.

28
0:01:47.95,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Throughout my life, my mother's rage would turn our small house

29
0:01:51.561,000 --> 0:01:52,000
into a minefield.

30
0:01:54.366,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Yet, though I feared her rage on a daily basis,

31
0:01:57.602,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I also learned so much from her.

32
0:02:00.848,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Our relationship was complicated and challenging,

33
0:02:05.816,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and at the age of 14, it was decided that I needed to live apart from her.

34
0:02:12.175,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But over the years,

35
0:02:13.846,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I've come to appreciate some of the important lessons

36
0:02:16.357,000 --> 0:02:17,000
my mother taught me about life.

37
0:02:18.823,000 --> 0:02:22,000
She was the first person who spoke to me about learning from the other side.

38
0:02:24.339,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And she, like me, was born and raised

39
0:02:27.213,000 --> 0:02:29,000
in a family of committed liberal democrats.

40
0:02:30.673,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Yet, she encouraged me to see the world and the issues our world faces

41
0:02:34.91,000 --> 0:02:37,000
as complex, controversial and ever-changing.

42
0:02:40.307,000 --> 0:02:42,000
One day, I came across the phrase "affirmative action"

43
0:02:42.895,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in a book I was reading.

44
0:02:45.377,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And when I asked her what the term meant,

45
0:02:48.028,000 --> 0:02:5,000
she spent what felt like an hour

46
0:02:50.171,000 --> 0:02:52,000
giving me a thorough and thoughtful explanation

47
0:02:52.393,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that would make sense to a small child.

48
0:02:54.792,000 --> 0:02:57,000
She even made the topic sound at least as interesting

49
0:02:58.388,000 --> 0:02:59,000
as any of my professors have.

50
0:03:01.165,000 --> 0:03:05,000
She explained the many reasons why people of various political views

51
0:03:05.196,000 --> 0:03:07,000
challenge and support affirmative action,

52
0:03:07.823,000 --> 0:03:1,000
stressing that, while she strongly supported it herself,

53
0:03:11.712,000 --> 0:03:14,000
it was important for me to view the issue as a controversial one

54
0:03:15.553,000 --> 0:03:16,000
with a long history,

55
0:03:17.641,000 --> 0:03:18,000
a questionable future

56
0:03:19.339,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and a host of complicating factors.

57
0:03:22.68,000 --> 0:03:25,000
While affirmative action can increase the presence of minorities

58
0:03:26.107,000 --> 0:03:28,000
at elite educational institutions,

59
0:03:28.712,000 --> 0:03:32,000
she felt that it could also disadvantage hardworking people of different races

60
0:03:33.214,000 --> 0:03:34,000
from more affluent backgrounds.

61
0:03:37.411,000 --> 0:03:39,000
My mom wanted me to understand

62
0:03:41.149,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that I should never just write off opinions

63
0:03:43.722,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that I disagreed with or disliked,

64
0:03:46.379,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because there was always something to learn from the perspectives of others,

65
0:03:50.902,000 --> 0:03:52,000
even when doing so might be difficult.

66
0:03:53.887,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But life at home with my mom

67
0:03:56.712,000 --> 0:04:,000
was not the only aspect of my journey that has been formative and uncomfortable.

68
0:04:01.776,000 --> 0:04:04,000
In fourth grade, she decided that I should attend a private school

69
0:04:05.292,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in order to receive the best education possible.

70
0:04:08.859,000 --> 0:04:11,000
As a black student attending predominantly white private schools,

71
0:04:12.173,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I've encountered attitudes and behaviors that reflected racial stereotypes.

72
0:04:17.157,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Several of my friends' parents assumed within minutes of meeting me

73
0:04:21.545,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that my best skill was playing basketball.

74
0:04:25.244,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And it really upset me to think that my race made it harder for them

75
0:04:28.56,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to see me as a student who loved reading, writing and speaking.

76
0:04:32.998,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Experiences like this motivated me to work tirelessly

77
0:04:38.499,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to disprove what I knew people had assumed.

78
0:04:42.967,000 --> 0:04:45,000
My mother even said that, in order to put my best foot forward,

79
0:04:46.514,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I had to be patient, alert and excruciatingly well-mannered.

80
0:04:50.053,000 --> 0:04:54,000
To prove that I belonged, I had to show poise and confidence,

81
0:04:54.323,000 --> 0:04:56,000
the ability to speak well and listen closely.

82
0:04:57.022,000 --> 0:05:,000
Only then would my peers see that I deserved to be there

83
0:05:00.123,000 --> 0:05:01,000
as much as they did.

84
0:05:02.165,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Despite this racial stereotyping and the discomfort I often felt,

85
0:05:07.387,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the learning I gained from other aspects of being at an elite private school

86
0:05:11.602,000 --> 0:05:12,000
were incredibly valuable.

87
0:05:14.181,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I was encouraged by my teachers to explore my curiosity,

88
0:05:18.617,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to challenge myself in new ways

89
0:05:20.823,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and to deepen my understanding of subjects that fascinated me the most.

90
0:05:26.498,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And going to college was the next step.

91
0:05:30.037,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I was excited to take my intellectual drive and interest in the world of ideas

92
0:05:33.761,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to the next level.

93
0:05:35.014,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I was eager to engage in lively debate with peers and professors

94
0:05:40.637,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and with outside speakers;

95
0:05:42.442,000 --> 0:05:46,000
to listen, to learn and gain a deeper understanding of myself

96
0:05:46.474,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and of others.

97
0:05:48.371,000 --> 0:05:51,000
While I was fortunate to meet peers and professors

98
0:05:51.761,000 --> 0:05:53,000
who were interested in doing the same thing,

99
0:05:54.331,000 --> 0:05:58,000
my desire to engage with difficult ideas was also met with resistance.

100
0:06:00.641,000 --> 0:06:04,000
To prepare myself to engage with controversy in the real world,

101
0:06:05.355,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I joined a group that brought controversial speakers to campus.

102
0:06:09.157,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But many people fiercely opposed this group,

103
0:06:12.093,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and I received significant pushback

104
0:06:14.609,000 --> 0:06:17,000
from students, faculty and my administration.

105
0:06:20.399,000 --> 0:06:22,000
For many, it was difficult to see

106
0:06:23.006,000 --> 0:06:26,000
how bringing controversial speakers to campus could be valuable,

107
0:06:26.767,000 --> 0:06:27,000
when they caused harm.

108
0:06:28.823,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And it was disappointing to me facing personal attacks,

109
0:06:32.052,000 --> 0:06:34,000
having my administration cancel speakers

110
0:06:34.703,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and hearing my intentions distorted by those around me.

111
0:06:39.642,000 --> 0:06:41,000
My work also hurt the feelings of many,

112
0:06:42.536,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and I understood that.

113
0:06:45.058,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Of course, no one likes being offended,

114
0:06:47.764,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and I certainly don't like hearing controversial speakers

115
0:06:50.938,000 --> 0:06:53,000
argue that feminism has become a war against men

116
0:06:54.345,000 --> 0:06:56,000
or that blacks have lower IQs than whites.

117
0:06:57.99,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I also understand

118
0:06:59.201,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that some people have experienced traumatic experiences in their lives.

119
0:07:05.688,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And for some, listening to offensive views

120
0:07:08.783,000 --> 0:07:12,000
can be like reliving the very traumas that they've worked so hard to overcome.

121
0:07:13.704,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Many argue that by giving these people a platform,

122
0:07:16.371,000 --> 0:07:17,000
you're doing more harm than good,

123
0:07:18.331,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and I'm reminded of this every time I listen to these points of view

124
0:07:22.641,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and feel my stomach turn.

125
0:07:25.235,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Yet, tuning out opposing viewpoints doesn't make them go away,

126
0:07:28.207,000 --> 0:07:3,000
because millions of people agree with them.

127
0:07:31.179,000 --> 0:07:33,000
In order to understand the potential of society

128
0:07:33.83,000 --> 0:07:34,000
to progress forward,

129
0:07:35.879,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we need to understand the counterforces.

130
0:07:39.244,000 --> 0:07:42,000
By engaging with controversial and offensive ideas,

131
0:07:43.244,000 --> 0:07:45,000
I believe that we can find common ground,

132
0:07:46.403,000 --> 0:07:48,000
if not with the speakers themselves,

133
0:07:49.363,000 --> 0:07:51,000
then with the audiences they may attract or indoctrinate.

134
0:07:53.268,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Through engaging, I believe that we may reach a better understanding,

135
0:07:58.53,000 --> 0:07:59,000
a deeper understanding,

136
0:08:00.022,000 --> 0:08:01,000
of our own beliefs

137
0:08:01.697,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and preserve the ability to solve problems,

138
0:08:05.514,000 --> 0:08:07,000
which we can't do if we don't talk to each other

139
0:08:08.109,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and make an effort to be good listeners.

140
0:08:12.275,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But soon after I announced

141
0:08:13.739,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that John Derbyshire would be speaking on campus,

142
0:08:16.561,000 --> 0:08:18,000
student backlash erupted on social media.

143
0:08:19.561,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The tide of resistance, in fact, was so intense,

144
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that my college president rescinded the invitation.

145
0:08:25.561,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I was deeply disappointed by this because, as I saw it,

146
0:08:28.72,000 --> 0:08:31,000
there would be nothing that any of my peers or I could do

147
0:08:32.506,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to silence someone who agreed with him

148
0:08:34.609,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in the office environment of our future employers.

149
0:08:38.292,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I look out at what's happening on college campuses,

150
0:08:41.154,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and I see the anger.

151
0:08:42.815,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And I get it.

152
0:08:44.363,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But what I wish I could tell people is that it's worth the discomfort,

153
0:08:48.329,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it's worth listening,

154
0:08:49.616,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and that we're stronger, not weaker, because of it.

155
0:08:54.395,000 --> 0:08:57,000
When I think about my experiences with uncomfortable learning,

156
0:08:59.403,000 --> 0:09:,000
and I reflect upon them,

157
0:09:02.035,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I've found that it's been very difficult to change the values

158
0:09:06.026,000 --> 0:09:08,000
of the intellectual community that I've been a part of.

159
0:09:10.585,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But I do feel a sense of hope

160
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
when I think about the individual interactions that I've been able to have

161
0:09:15.75,000 --> 0:09:18,000
with students who both support the work that I'm doing

162
0:09:18.934,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and who feel challenged by it and who do not support it.

163
0:09:23.447,000 --> 0:09:24,000
What I've found is that,

164
0:09:24.634,000 --> 0:09:26,000
while it can be difficult to change the values of a community,

165
0:09:27.569,000 --> 0:09:3,000
we can gain a lot from individual interactions.

166
0:09:31.419,000 --> 0:09:34,000
While I didn't get to engage with John Derbyshire

167
0:09:34.751,000 --> 0:09:36,000
due to my president's disinvitation,

168
0:09:36.872,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I was able to have dinner with Charles Murray before his talk.

169
0:09:42.14,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I knew the conversation would be difficult.

170
0:09:44.879,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And I didn't expect it to be pleasant.

171
0:09:47.069,000 --> 0:09:51,000
But it was cordial, and I did gain a deeper understanding of his arguments.

172
0:09:53.259,000 --> 0:09:57,000
I found that he, like me, believed in creating a more just society.

173
0:09:58.224,000 --> 0:10:01,000
The thing is, his understanding of what justice entailed

174
0:10:02.216,000 --> 0:10:03,000
was very different from my own.

175
0:10:04.879,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The way in which he wanted to understand the issue,

176
0:10:07.573,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the way in which he wanted to approach the issue of inequality

177
0:10:10.527,000 --> 0:10:11,000
also differed from my own.

178
0:10:12.749,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And I found that his understanding of issues like welfare

179
0:10:15.849,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and affirmative action

180
0:10:17.067,000 --> 0:10:19,000
was tied and deeply rooted

181
0:10:19.212,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in his understanding of various libertarian and conservative beliefs,

182
0:10:23.323,000 --> 0:10:26,000
what diminishes and increases their presence in our society.

183
0:10:27.535,000 --> 0:10:3,000
While he expressed his viewpoints eloquently,

184
0:10:30.606,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I remained thoroughly unconvinced.

185
0:10:32.923,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But I did walk away with a deeper understanding.

186
0:10:36.796,000 --> 0:10:37,000
It's my belief

187
0:10:39.134,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that to achieve progress in the face of adversity,

188
0:10:43.585,000 --> 0:10:45,000
we need a genuine commitment

189
0:10:46.315,000 --> 0:10:48,000
to gaining a deeper understanding of humanity.

190
0:10:50.077,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I'd like to see a world with more leaders

191
0:10:52.254,000 --> 0:10:54,000
who are familiar with the depths of the views

192
0:10:54.414,000 --> 0:10:56,000
of those they deeply disagree with,

193
0:10:58.998,000 --> 0:11:01,000
so that they can understand the nuances of everyone they're representing.

194
0:11:03.022,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I see this as an ongoing process involving constant learning,

195
0:11:07.391,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and I'm confident that I'll be able to add value down the line

196
0:11:11.101,000 --> 0:11:13,000
if I continue building empathy and understanding

197
0:11:13.893,000 --> 0:11:15,000
through engaging with unfamiliar perspectives.

198
0:11:16.547,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Thank you.

199
0:11:17.728,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Applause)

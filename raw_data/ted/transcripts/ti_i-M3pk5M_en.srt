2
0:00:16.116,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I am no designer, nope, no way.

3
0:00:19.967,000 --> 0:00:2,000
My dad was,

4
0:00:21.783,000 --> 0:00:23,000
which is kind of an interesting way to grow up.

5
0:00:24.375,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I had to figure out what it is my dad did

6
0:00:28.55,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and why it was important.

7
0:00:30.35,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Dad talked a lot about bad design when we were growing up,

8
0:00:33.511,000 --> 0:00:37,000
you know, "Bad design is just people not thinking, John," he would say

9
0:00:38.481,000 --> 0:00:4,000
whenever a kid would be injured by a rotary lawn mower

10
0:00:40.944,000 --> 0:00:42,000
or, say, a typewriter ribbon would get tangled

11
0:00:43.894,000 --> 0:00:45,000
or an eggbeater would get jammed in the kitchen.

12
0:00:46.287,000 --> 0:00:51,000
You know, "Design -- bad design, there's just no excuse for it.

13
0:00:51.806,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It's letting stuff happen without thinking about it.

14
0:00:54.414,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Every object should be about something, John.

15
0:00:57.777,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It should imagine a user.

16
0:00:59.215,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It should cast that user in a story starring the user and the object.

17
0:01:04.182,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Good design," my dad said, "is about supplying intent."

18
0:01:09.423,000 --> 0:01:11,000
That's what he said.

19
0:01:12.078,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Dad helped design the control panels for the IBM 360 computer.

20
0:01:15.999,000 --> 0:01:19,000
That was a big deal; that was important. He worked for Kodak for a while; that was important.

21
0:01:19.999,000 --> 0:01:24,000
He designed chairs and desks and other office equipment for Steelcase; that was important.

22
0:01:25.555,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I knew design was important in my house because, for heaven's sake, it put food on our table, right?

23
0:01:30.593,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And design was in everything my dad did.

24
0:01:32.965,000 --> 0:01:35,000
He had a Dixieland jazz band when we were growing up,

25
0:01:36.122,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and he would always cover Louis Armstrong tunes.

26
0:01:38.818,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And I would ask him every once in a while,

27
0:01:40.546,000 --> 0:01:42,000
"Dad, do you want it to sound like the record?"

28
0:01:43.457,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We had lots of old jazz records lying around the house.

29
0:01:45.61,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And he said, "No, never, John, never.

30
0:01:47.907,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The song is just a given, that's how you have to think about it.

31
0:01:50.634,000 --> 0:01:52,000
You gotta make it your own. You gotta design it.

32
0:01:53.319,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Show everyone what you intend," is what he said.

33
0:01:57.316,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"Doing that, acting by design, is what we all should be doing.

34
0:02:01.605,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It's where we all belong."

35
0:02:03.714,000 --> 0:02:06,000
All of us? Designers?

36
0:02:07.139,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Oh, oh, Dad. Oh, Dad.

37
0:02:12.073,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The song is just a given.

38
0:02:13.738,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's how you cover it that matters.

39
0:02:16.226,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Well, let's hold on to that thought for just a minute.

40
0:02:18.322,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It's kind of like this wheelchair I'm in, right?

41
0:02:21.225,000 --> 0:02:23,000
The original tune? It's a little scary.

42
0:02:23.25,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"Ooh, what happened to that dude?

43
0:02:25.914,000 --> 0:02:28,000
He can't walk. Anybody know the story?

44
0:02:29.025,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Anybody?"

45
0:02:30.931,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I don't like to talk about this very much, but I'll tell you guys the story today.

46
0:02:36.218,000 --> 0:02:39,000
All right, exactly 36 years ago this week, that's right,

47
0:02:40.068,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I was in a poorly designed automobile

48
0:02:42.01,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that hit a poorly designed guardrail

49
0:02:45.931,000 --> 0:02:47,000
on a poorly designed road in Pennsylvania,

50
0:02:48.514,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and plummeted down a 200-foot embankment

51
0:02:53.307,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and killed two people in the car.

52
0:02:55.514,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But ever since then, the wheelchair has been a given in my life.

53
0:02:59.993,000 --> 0:03:04,000
My life, at the mercy of good design and bad design.

54
0:03:05.129,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Think about it. Now, in design terms,

55
0:03:07.532,000 --> 0:03:09,000
a wheelchair is a very difficult object.

56
0:03:10.53,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It mostly projects tragedy and fear and misfortune,

57
0:03:14.698,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and it projects that message, that story, so strongly

58
0:03:17.489,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that it almost blots out anything else.

59
0:03:19.748,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I roll swiftly through an airport, right?

60
0:03:23.226,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And moms grab their kids out of the way and say, "Don't stare!"

61
0:03:27.21,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The poor kid, you know, has this terrified look on his face, God knows what they think.

62
0:03:31.409,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And for decades, I'm going,

63
0:03:33.578,000 --> 0:03:37,000
why does this happen? What can I do about it? How can I change this? I mean there must be something.

64
0:03:38.058,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So I would roll, I'd make no eye contact -- just kinda frown, right?

65
0:03:43.217,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Or I'd dress up really, really sharply or something.

66
0:03:48.649,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Or I'd make eye contact with everyone --

67
0:03:50.526,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that was really creepy; that didn't work at all.

68
0:03:53.018,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:54.931,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You know anything, I'd try. I wouldn't shower for a week -- nothing worked.

70
0:03:58.786,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Nothing whatsoever worked until a few years ago,

71
0:04:02.77,000 --> 0:04:06,000
my six-year-old daughters were looking at this wheelchair catalog that I had, and they said,

72
0:04:07.11,000 --> 0:04:12,000
"Oh, Dad! Dad! Look, you gotta get these, these flashy wheels -- you gotta get 'em!"

73
0:04:12.234,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And I said, "Oh, girls, Dad is a very important journalist,

74
0:04:16.347,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that just wouldn't do at all."

75
0:04:18.913,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And of course, they immediately concluded,

76
0:04:20.858,000 --> 0:04:25,000
"Oh, what a bummer, Dad. Journalists aren't allowed to have flashy wheels.

77
0:04:26.025,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I mean, how important could you be then?" they said.

78
0:04:30.503,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I went, "Wait a minute, all right, right -- I'll get the wheels." Purely out of protest,

79
0:04:35.465,000 --> 0:04:39,000
I got the flashy wheels, and I installed them and --

80
0:04:40.383,000 --> 0:04:43,000
check this out. Could I have my special light cue please?

81
0:04:43.911,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:45.433,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Look at that!

83
0:04:48.364,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now ... look at, look at this! Look at this!

84
0:04:50.829,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So what you are looking at here

85
0:04:54.276,000 --> 0:04:57,000
has completely changed my life,

86
0:04:57.363,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I mean totally changed my life.

87
0:05:00.34,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Instead of blank stares and awkwardness,

88
0:05:03.212,000 --> 0:05:06,000
now it is pointing and smiling!

89
0:05:06.696,000 --> 0:05:1,000
People going, "Awesome wheels, dude! Those are awesome!

90
0:05:10.764,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I mean, I want some of those wheels!" Little kids say,

91
0:05:13.364,000 --> 0:05:15,000
"Can I have a ride?"

92
0:05:15.5,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:17.375,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And of course there's the occasional person --

94
0:05:19.892,000 --> 0:05:2,000
usually a middle-aged male who will say,

95
0:05:21.708,000 --> 0:05:22,000
"Oh, those wheels are great!

96
0:05:23.349,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I guess they're for safety, right?"

97
0:05:25.639,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:27.988,000 --> 0:05:32,000
No! They're not for safety.

99
0:05:33.956,000 --> 0:05:34,000
No, no, no, no, no.

100
0:05:35.836,000 --> 0:05:36,000
What's the difference here,

101
0:05:37.613,000 --> 0:05:38,000
the wheelchair with no lights

102
0:05:39.42,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and the wheelchair with lights?

103
0:05:41.15,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The difference is intent.

104
0:05:44.932,000 --> 0:05:47,000
That's right, that's right; I'm no longer a victim.

105
0:05:48.589,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I chose to change the situation -- I'm the Commander of the Starship Wheelchair with the phaser wheels in the front. Right?

106
0:05:54.501,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Intent changes the picture completely.

107
0:05:58.876,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I choose to enhance

108
0:06:00.693,000 --> 0:06:01,000
this rolling experience

109
0:06:02.636,000 --> 0:06:05,000
with a simple design element.

110
0:06:06.34,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Acting with intent.

111
0:06:08.548,000 --> 0:06:1,000
It conveys authorship.

112
0:06:10.764,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It suggests that someone is driving.

113
0:06:13.844,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It's reassuring; people are drawn to it.

114
0:06:16.852,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Someone making the experience their own.

115
0:06:20.364,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Covering the tragic tune

116
0:06:22.604,000 --> 0:06:24,000
with something different,

117
0:06:25.5,000 --> 0:06:28,000
something radically different.

118
0:06:28.709,000 --> 0:06:3,000
People respond to that.

119
0:06:30.756,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Now it seems simple, but actually I think

120
0:06:33.548,000 --> 0:06:35,000
in our society and culture in general,

121
0:06:35.773,000 --> 0:06:37,000
we have a huge problem with intent.

122
0:06:37.836,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Now go with me here. Look at this guy. You know who this is?

123
0:06:41.196,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It's Anders Breivik. Now, if he intended to kill

124
0:06:45.212,000 --> 0:06:46,000
in Olso, Norway last year,

125
0:06:46.948,000 --> 0:06:48,000
dozens and dozens of young people --

126
0:06:49.308,000 --> 0:06:5,000
if he intended to do that,

127
0:06:51.02,000 --> 0:06:53,000
he's a vicious criminal. We punish him.

128
0:06:53.604,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Life in prison. Death penalty in the United States, not so much in Norway.

129
0:06:56.973,000 --> 0:07:,000
But, if he instead acted out of a delusional fantasy,

130
0:07:01.324,000 --> 0:07:05,000
if he was motivated by some random mental illness,

131
0:07:06.308,000 --> 0:07:08,000
he's in a completely different category.

132
0:07:08.754,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We may put him away for life, but

133
0:07:10.541,000 --> 0:07:12,000
we watch him clinically.

134
0:07:12.58,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It's a completely different domain.

135
0:07:16.029,000 --> 0:07:18,000
As an intentional murderer,

136
0:07:18.501,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Anders Breivik is merely evil.

137
0:07:21.54,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But as a dysfunctional,

138
0:07:23.725,000 --> 0:07:25,000
as a dysfunctional murderer/psychotic,

139
0:07:25.973,000 --> 0:07:26,000
he's something much more complicated.

140
0:07:27.932,000 --> 0:07:28,000
He's the breath of some

141
0:07:29.692,000 --> 0:07:32,000
primitive, ancient chaos.

142
0:07:33.092,000 --> 0:07:34,000
He's the random state of nature

143
0:07:35.076,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we emerged from.

144
0:07:36.606,000 --> 0:07:38,000
He's something very, very different.

145
0:07:38.876,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's as though intent is an essential component for humanity.

146
0:07:42.613,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It's what we're supposed to do somehow.

147
0:07:44.932,000 --> 0:07:46,000
We're supposed to act with intent.

148
0:07:47.66,000 --> 0:07:49,000
We're supposed to do things by design.

149
0:07:50.116,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Intent is a marker for civilization.

150
0:07:54.956,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Now here's an example a little closer to home:

151
0:07:57.548,000 --> 0:07:59,000
My family is all about intent.

152
0:07:59.924,000 --> 0:08:02,000
You can probably tell there are two sets of twins,

153
0:08:03.132,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the result of IVF technology, in vitro fertilization technology,

154
0:08:07.38,000 --> 0:08:09,000
due to some physical limitations I won't go into.

155
0:08:10.015,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Anyway, in vitro technology, IVF,

156
0:08:13.068,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is about as intentional as agriculture.

157
0:08:16.072,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Let me tell you, some of you may have the experience.

158
0:08:18.228,000 --> 0:08:2,000
In fact, the whole technology of sperm extraction

159
0:08:21.172,000 --> 0:08:25,000
for spinal cord-injured males was invented by a veterinarian.

160
0:08:25.62,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I met the dude. He's a great guy.

161
0:08:27.902,000 --> 0:08:31,000
He carried this big leather bag full of sperm probes for

162
0:08:32.844,000 --> 0:08:34,000
all of the animals that he'd worked with,

163
0:08:35.14,000 --> 0:08:36,000
all the different animals.

164
0:08:36.639,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Probes he designed,

165
0:08:38.771,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and in fact, he was really, really proud of these probes.

166
0:08:41.772,000 --> 0:08:44,000
He would say, "You're right between horse and squirrel, John."

167
0:08:45.542,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

168
0:08:48.78,000 --> 0:08:53,000
But anyway, so when my wife and I decided

169
0:08:54.452,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to upgrade our early middle age -- we had four kids, after all --

170
0:08:57.501,000 --> 0:08:58,000
with a little different technology

171
0:08:59.492,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that I won't explain in too much detail here --

172
0:09:02.372,000 --> 0:09:06,000
my urologist assured me I had nothing whatsoever to worry about.

173
0:09:06.63,000 --> 0:09:08,000
"No need for birth control, Doc, are you sure about that?"

174
0:09:09.206,000 --> 0:09:12,000
"John, John, I looked at your chart.

175
0:09:12.766,000 --> 0:09:14,000
From your sperm tests we can

176
0:09:15.023,000 --> 0:09:17,000
confidently say that

177
0:09:17.031,000 --> 0:09:19,000
you're basically a form of birth control."

178
0:09:19.753,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Well!

179
0:09:23.031,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Laughter)

180
0:09:26.623,000 --> 0:09:29,000
What a liberating thought! Yes!

181
0:09:29.998,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And after a couple very liberating weekends,

182
0:09:33.063,000 --> 0:09:34,000
my wife and I,

183
0:09:34.503,000 --> 0:09:37,000
utilizing some cutting-edge erectile technology

184
0:09:38.391,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that is certainly worthy of a TEDTalk someday

185
0:09:40.975,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but I won't get into it now,

186
0:09:43.006,000 --> 0:09:47,000
we noticed some familiar, if unexpected, symptoms.

187
0:09:47.758,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I wasn't exactly a form of birth control.

188
0:09:51.418,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Look at that font there. My wife was so pissed.

189
0:09:54.998,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I mean, did a designer come up with that?

190
0:09:56.543,000 --> 0:09:58,000
No, I don't think a designer did come up with that.

191
0:09:58.775,000 --> 0:10:,000
In fact, maybe that's the problem.

192
0:10:00.99,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And so, little Ajax was born.

193
0:10:03.671,000 --> 0:10:05,000
He's like our other children,

194
0:10:05.94,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but the experience is completely different.

195
0:10:07.718,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It's something like my accident, right?

196
0:10:11.958,000 --> 0:10:12,000
He came out of nowhere.

197
0:10:13.233,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But we all had to change,

198
0:10:14.839,000 --> 0:10:16,000
but not just react to the given;

199
0:10:17.52,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we bend to this new experience with intent.

200
0:10:22.079,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We're five now. Five.

201
0:10:26.151,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Facing the given with intent. Doing things by design.

202
0:10:30.063,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Hey, the name Ajax -- you can't get much more intentional than that, right?

203
0:10:34.295,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We're really hoping he thanks us for that later on.

204
0:10:38.535,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Laughter)

205
0:10:40.368,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But I never became a designer. No, no, no, no. Never attempted. Never even close.

206
0:10:44.267,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I did love some great designs as I was growing up:

207
0:10:48.905,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The HP 35S calculator -- God, I loved that thing. Oh God, I wish I had one.

208
0:10:53.272,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Man, I love that thing.

209
0:10:56.722,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I could afford that.

210
0:10:57.945,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Other designs I really couldn't afford, like the 1974 911 Targa.

211
0:11:02.584,000 --> 0:11:05,000
In school, I studied nothing close to design or engineering;

212
0:11:06.049,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I studied useless things like the Classics,

213
0:11:08.368,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but there were some lessons even there --

214
0:11:10.185,000 --> 0:11:13,000
this guy, Plato, it turns out he's a designer.

215
0:11:13.449,000 --> 0:11:16,000
He designed a state in "The Republic,"

216
0:11:16.872,000 --> 0:11:17,000
a design never implemented.

217
0:11:18.363,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Listen to one of the design features

218
0:11:20.048,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of Plato's Government 4.0:

219
0:11:23.072,000 --> 0:11:27,000
"The State in which the rulers are most reluctant to govern

220
0:11:27.632,000 --> 0:11:29,000
is always the best and most quietly governed,

221
0:11:30.568,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and the State in which they are most eager, the worst."

222
0:11:34.64,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Well, got that wrong, didn't we?

223
0:11:37.584,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But look at that statement; it's all about intent. That's what I love about it.

224
0:11:41.881,000 --> 0:11:44,000
But consider what Plato is doing here. What is he doing?

225
0:11:45.336,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It's a grand idea of design -- a huge idea of design,

226
0:11:48.856,000 --> 0:11:51,000
common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy

227
0:11:52.573,000 --> 0:11:54,000
that emerged in the Classical period.

228
0:11:54.813,000 --> 0:11:55,000
What was going on then?

229
0:11:56.246,000 --> 0:11:58,000
They were trying to answer the question of

230
0:11:58.382,000 --> 0:12:02,000
what would human beings do now that they were no longer simply trying to survive?

231
0:12:03.348,000 --> 0:12:07,000
As the human race emerged from a prehistoric chaos,

232
0:12:07.789,000 --> 0:12:11,000
a confrontation with random, brutal nature,

233
0:12:12.213,000 --> 0:12:15,000
they suddenly had a moment to think -- and there was a lot to think about.

234
0:12:15.797,000 --> 0:12:19,000
All of a sudden, human existence needed an intent.

235
0:12:19.924,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Human life needed a reason.

236
0:12:22.639,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Reality itself needed a designer.

237
0:12:25.661,000 --> 0:12:27,000
The given was replaced

238
0:12:28.053,000 --> 0:12:3,000
by various aspects of intent,

239
0:12:30.677,000 --> 0:12:32,000
by various designs,

240
0:12:33.261,000 --> 0:12:35,000
by various gods.

241
0:12:35.541,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Gods we're still fighting about. Oh yeah.

242
0:12:39.485,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Today we don't confront the chaos of nature.

243
0:12:42.645,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Today it is the chaos of humanity's impact on the Earth itself that we confront.

244
0:12:48.525,000 --> 0:12:51,000
This young discipline called design, I think,

245
0:12:51.805,000 --> 0:12:54,000
is in fact the emerging ethos

246
0:12:55.072,000 --> 0:12:57,000
formulating and then answering a very new question:

247
0:12:57.99,000 --> 0:12:58,000
What shall we do now

248
0:12:59.589,000 --> 0:13:02,000
in the face of the chaos that we have created?

249
0:13:03.332,000 --> 0:13:04,000
What shall we do?

250
0:13:05.236,000 --> 0:13:07,000
How shall we inscribe intent

251
0:13:07.702,000 --> 0:13:09,000
on all the objects we create,

252
0:13:10.005,000 --> 0:13:11,000
on all the circumstances we create,

253
0:13:11.981,000 --> 0:13:13,000
on all the places we change?

254
0:13:14.588,000 --> 0:13:18,000
The consequences of a planet with 7 billion people and counting.

255
0:13:18.716,000 --> 0:13:22,000
That's the tune we're all covering today, all of us.

256
0:13:23.085,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And we can't just imitate the past. No.

257
0:13:25.621,000 --> 0:13:27,000
That won't do.

258
0:13:28.455,000 --> 0:13:29,000
That won't do at all.

259
0:13:30.23,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Here's my favorite design moment:

260
0:13:33.237,000 --> 0:13:36,000
In the city of Kinshasa in Zaire in the 1990s,

261
0:13:36.645,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I was working for ABC News, and I was reporting on

262
0:13:38.933,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the fall of Mobutu Sese Seko, the dictator, the brutal dictator in Zaire,

263
0:13:43.077,000 --> 0:13:45,000
who raped and pillaged that country.

264
0:13:45.077,000 --> 0:13:47,000
There was rioting in the middle of Kinshasa.

265
0:13:47.645,000 --> 0:13:5,000
The place was falling apart; it was a horrible, horrible place,

266
0:13:51.126,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and I needed to go and explore the center of Kinshasa

267
0:13:54.997,000 --> 0:13:56,000
to report on the rioting and the looting.

268
0:13:57.02,000 --> 0:14:,000
People were carrying off vehicles, carrying off pieces of buildings.

269
0:14:00.806,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Soldiers were in the streets shooting at looters and herding some in mass arrests.

270
0:14:05.501,000 --> 0:14:08,000
In the middle of this chaos, I'm rolling around in a wheelchair,

271
0:14:09.015,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and I was completely invisible. Completely.

272
0:14:12.765,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I was in a wheelchair; I didn't look like a looter.

273
0:14:15.535,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I was in a wheelchair; I didn't look like a journalist, particularly, at least from their perspective.

274
0:14:21.717,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And I didn't look like a soldier, that's for sure.

275
0:14:23.957,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I was part of this sort of background noise of the misery of Zaire, completely invisible.

276
0:14:30.252,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And all of a sudden, from around a corner, comes this young man, paralyzed, just like me,

277
0:14:35.349,000 --> 0:14:38,000
in this metal and wood and leather

278
0:14:39.069,000 --> 0:14:44,000
pedal, three-wheel tricycle-wheelchair device,

279
0:14:44.094,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and he pedals up to me as fast as he can.

280
0:14:46.558,000 --> 0:14:47,000
He goes, "Hey, mister! Mister!"

281
0:14:48.333,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And I looked at him --

282
0:14:50.63,000 --> 0:14:53,000
he didn't know any other English than that, but we didn't need English, no, no, no, no, no.

283
0:14:54.214,000 --> 0:14:59,000
We sat there and compared wheels and tires and spokes and tubes.

284
0:15:00.085,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And I looked at his whacky pedal mechanism;

285
0:15:03.51,000 --> 0:15:06,000
he was full of pride over his design.

286
0:15:06.75,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I wish I could show you that contraption.

287
0:15:08.599,000 --> 0:15:1,000
His smile, our glow

288
0:15:10.726,000 --> 0:15:12,000
as we talked a universal language

289
0:15:13.237,000 --> 0:15:15,000
of design,

290
0:15:15.949,000 --> 0:15:17,000
invisible to the chaos around us.

291
0:15:18.766,000 --> 0:15:22,000
His machine: homemade, bolted, rusty, comical.

292
0:15:22.822,000 --> 0:15:25,000
My machine: American-made, confident, sleek.

293
0:15:26.12,000 --> 0:15:3,000
He was particularly proud of the comfortable seat, really comfortable seat

294
0:15:30.342,000 --> 0:15:31,000
he had made in his chariot

295
0:15:32.258,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and its beautiful fabric fringe around the edge.

296
0:15:36.685,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Oh, I wish I'd had those sparkly wheels back then to have shown him, man!

297
0:15:40.669,000 --> 0:15:42,000
He would have loved those! Oh yeah.

298
0:15:43.414,000 --> 0:15:44,000
He would have understood those;

299
0:15:45.006,000 --> 0:15:48,000
a chariot of pure intent -- think about it --

300
0:15:48.474,000 --> 0:15:5,000
in a city out of control.

301
0:15:51.086,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Design blew it all away for a moment.

302
0:15:54.134,000 --> 0:15:58,000
We spoke for a few minutes and then each of us vanished back into the chaos.

303
0:15:58.278,000 --> 0:16:,000
He went back to the streets of Kinshasa;

304
0:16:00.697,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I went to my hotel. And I think of him now, now ...

305
0:16:06.679,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And I pose this question.

306
0:16:09.741,000 --> 0:16:12,000
An object imbued with intent --

307
0:16:13.294,000 --> 0:16:14,000
it has power,

308
0:16:14.958,000 --> 0:16:17,000
it's treasure, we're drawn to it.

309
0:16:18.358,000 --> 0:16:2,000
An object devoid of intent --

310
0:16:20.99,000 --> 0:16:22,000
it's random, it's imitative,

311
0:16:23.502,000 --> 0:16:26,000
it repels us. It's like a piece of junk mail to be thrown away.

312
0:16:27.182,000 --> 0:16:31,000
This is what we must demand of our lives,

313
0:16:31.933,000 --> 0:16:34,000
of our objects, of our things, of our circumstances:

314
0:16:35.758,000 --> 0:16:38,000
living with intent.

315
0:16:38.854,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And I have to say

316
0:16:40.958,000 --> 0:16:45,000
that on that score, I have a very unfair advantage over all of you.

317
0:16:45.989,000 --> 0:16:5,000
And I want to explain it to you now because this is a very special day.

318
0:16:51.694,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Thirty-six years ago at nearly this moment,

319
0:16:56.629,000 --> 0:17:,000
a 19-year-old boy awoke from a coma

320
0:17:00.785,000 --> 0:17:01,000
to ask a nurse a question,

321
0:17:02.582,000 --> 0:17:04,000
but the nurse was already there with an answer.

322
0:17:05.062,000 --> 0:17:08,000
"You've had a terrible accident, young man. You've broken your back.

323
0:17:08.765,000 --> 0:17:09,000
You'll never walk again."

324
0:17:10.406,000 --> 0:17:15,000
I said, "I know all that -- what day is it?"

325
0:17:16.022,000 --> 0:17:23,000
You see, I knew that the car had gone over the guardrail on the 28th of February,

326
0:17:23.046,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and I knew that 1976 was a leap year.

327
0:17:26.695,000 --> 0:17:3,000
"Nurse! Is this the 28th or the 29th?"

328
0:17:31.405,000 --> 0:17:32,000
And she looked at me and said,

329
0:17:33.398,000 --> 0:17:35,000
"It's March 1st."

330
0:17:35.973,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And I went, "Oh my God.

331
0:17:38.454,000 --> 0:17:4,000
I've got some catching up to do!"

332
0:17:40.99,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And from that moment, I knew

333
0:17:43.662,000 --> 0:17:46,000
the given was that accident;

334
0:17:46.91,000 --> 0:17:49,000
I had no option but to make up

335
0:17:50.598,000 --> 0:17:53,000
this new life without walking.

336
0:17:53.654,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Intent -- a life with intent --

337
0:17:57.462,000 --> 0:17:58,000
lived by design,

338
0:17:59.286,000 --> 0:18:,000
covering the original

339
0:18:00.902,000 --> 0:18:01,000
with something better.

340
0:18:02.462,000 --> 0:18:07,000
It's something for all of us to do or find a way to do in these times.

341
0:18:07.542,000 --> 0:18:1,000
To get back to this,

342
0:18:10.884,000 --> 0:18:12,000
to get back to design,

343
0:18:13.02,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and as my daddy suggested a long time ago,

344
0:18:16.421,000 --> 0:18:19,000
"Make the song your own, John.

345
0:18:19.708,000 --> 0:18:24,000
Show everybody what you intend."

346
0:18:38.69,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Daddy,

347
0:18:40.989,000 --> 0:18:41,000
this one's for you.

348
0:18:42.937,000 --> 0:18:46,000
(Music)

349
0:18:47.717,000 --> 0:18:51,000

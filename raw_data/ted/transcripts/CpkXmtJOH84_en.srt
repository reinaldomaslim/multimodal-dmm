1
0:00:12.368,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We have a global health challenge

2
0:00:14.505,000 --> 0:00:15,000
in our hands today,

3
0:00:16.197,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and that is that the way we currently

4
0:00:19.257,000 --> 0:00:21,000
discover and develop new drugs

5
0:00:22.182,000 --> 0:00:26,000
is too costly, takes far too long,

6
0:00:26.36,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and it fails more often than it succeeds.

7
0:00:30.074,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It really just isn't working, and that means

8
0:00:33.451,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that patients that badly need new therapies

9
0:00:36.498,000 --> 0:00:37,000
are not getting them,

10
0:00:38.209,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and diseases are going untreated.

11
0:00:41.707,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We seem to be spending more and more money.

12
0:00:44.79,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So for every billion dollars we spend in R&D,

13
0:00:48.886,000 --> 0:00:51,000
we're getting less drugs approved into the market.

14
0:00:52.715,000 --> 0:00:55,000
More money, less drugs. Hmm.

15
0:00:55.932,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So what's going on here?

16
0:00:57.852,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Well, there's a multitude of factors at play,

17
0:01:00.447,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but I think one of the key factors

18
0:01:02.468,000 --> 0:01:04,000
is that the tools that we currently have

19
0:01:04.865,000 --> 0:01:08,000
available to test whether a drug is going to work,

20
0:01:08.948,000 --> 0:01:09,000
whether it has efficacy,

21
0:01:10.337,000 --> 0:01:11,000
or whether it's going to be safe

22
0:01:12.103,000 --> 0:01:15,000
before we get it into human clinical trials,

23
0:01:15.655,000 --> 0:01:17,000
are failing us. They're not predicting

24
0:01:17.806,000 --> 0:01:2,000
what's going to happen in humans.

25
0:01:21.034,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And we have two main tools available

26
0:01:23.757,000 --> 0:01:25,000
at our disposal.

27
0:01:25.771,000 --> 0:01:29,000
They are cells in dishes and animal testing.

28
0:01:29.812,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now let's talk about the first one, cells in dishes.

29
0:01:33.132,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So, cells are happily functioning in our bodies.

30
0:01:36.285,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We take them and rip them out

31
0:01:38.34,000 --> 0:01:4,000
of their native environment, throw them in one of these dishes,

32
0:01:41.289,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and expect them to work.

33
0:01:42.874,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Guess what. They don't.

34
0:01:45.067,000 --> 0:01:46,000
They don't like that environment

35
0:01:46.729,000 --> 0:01:47,000
because it's nothing like

36
0:01:48.361,000 --> 0:01:5,000
what they have in the body.

37
0:01:51.037,000 --> 0:01:53,000
What about animal testing?

38
0:01:53.108,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Well, animals do and can provide

39
0:01:55.993,000 --> 0:01:57,000
extremely useful information.

40
0:01:58.255,000 --> 0:01:59,000
They teach us about what happens

41
0:01:59.964,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in the complex organism.

42
0:02:02.293,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We learn more about the biology itself.

43
0:02:05.301,000 --> 0:02:07,000
However, more often than not,

44
0:02:08.199,000 --> 0:02:12,000
animal models fail to predict what will happen in humans

45
0:02:12.415,000 --> 0:02:15,000
when they're treated with a particular drug.

46
0:02:15.601,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So we need better tools.

47
0:02:17.98,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We need human cells,

48
0:02:19.733,000 --> 0:02:21,000
but we need to find a way to keep them happy

49
0:02:22.483,000 --> 0:02:23,000
outside the body.

50
0:02:24.074,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Our bodies are dynamic environments.

51
0:02:26.98,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We're in constant motion.

52
0:02:28.82,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Our cells experience that.

53
0:02:31.011,000 --> 0:02:33,000
They're in dynamic environments in our body.

54
0:02:33.82,000 --> 0:02:35,000
They're under constant mechanical forces.

55
0:02:36.575,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So if we want to make cells happy

56
0:02:39.031,000 --> 0:02:4,000
outside our bodies,

57
0:02:40.46,000 --> 0:02:42,000
we need to become cell architects.

58
0:02:42.986,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We need to design, build and engineer

59
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
a home away from home for the cells.

60
0:02:50.561,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And at the Wyss Institute,

61
0:02:52.235,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we've done just that.

62
0:02:54.173,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We call it an organ-on-a-chip.

63
0:02:57.197,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And I have one right here.

64
0:02:58.988,000 --> 0:03:,000
It's beautiful, isn't it? But it's pretty incredible.

65
0:03:01.803,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Right here in my hand is a breathing, living

66
0:03:06.303,000 --> 0:03:08,000
human lung on a chip.

67
0:03:08.961,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And it's not just beautiful.

68
0:03:11.089,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It can do a tremendous amount of things.

69
0:03:13.529,000 --> 0:03:16,000
We have living cells in that little chip,

70
0:03:17.308,000 --> 0:03:19,000
cells that are in a dynamic environment

71
0:03:19.858,000 --> 0:03:22,000
interacting with different cell types.

72
0:03:22.939,000 --> 0:03:23,000
There's been many people

73
0:03:24.578,000 --> 0:03:25,000
trying to grow cells in the lab.

74
0:03:26.439,000 --> 0:03:29,000
They've tried many different approaches.

75
0:03:29.595,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They've even tried to grow little mini-organs in the lab.

76
0:03:32.222,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We're not trying to do that here.

77
0:03:33.771,000 --> 0:03:35,000
We're simply trying to recreate

78
0:03:35.897,000 --> 0:03:36,000
in this tiny chip

79
0:03:37.474,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the smallest functional unit

80
0:03:40.491,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that represents the biochemistry,

81
0:03:43.045,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the function and the mechanical strain

82
0:03:46.169,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that the cells experience in our bodies.

83
0:03:49.685,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So how does it work? Let me show you.

84
0:03:52.717,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We use techniques from the computer chip

85
0:03:55.351,000 --> 0:03:56,000
manufacturing industry

86
0:03:56.984,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to make these structures at a scale

87
0:03:59.181,000 --> 0:04:01,000
relevant to both the cells and their environment.

88
0:04:02.077,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We have three fluidic channels.

89
0:04:04.141,000 --> 0:04:07,000
In the center, we have a porous, flexible membrane

90
0:04:07.853,000 --> 0:04:09,000
on which we can add human cells

91
0:04:09.916,000 --> 0:04:1,000
from, say, our lungs,

92
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and then underneath, they had capillary cells,

93
0:04:13.747,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the cells in our blood vessels.

94
0:04:15.535,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And we can then apply mechanical forces to the chip

95
0:04:19.855,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that stretch and contract the membrane,

96
0:04:22.684,000 --> 0:04:25,000
so the cells experience the same mechanical forces

97
0:04:25.781,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that they did when we breathe.

98
0:04:28.714,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And they experience them how they did in the body.

99
0:04:31.874,000 --> 0:04:33,000
There's air flowing through the top channel,

100
0:04:34.274,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and then we flow a liquid that contains nutrients

101
0:04:37.623,000 --> 0:04:39,000
through the blood channel.

102
0:04:40.462,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now the chip is really beautiful,

103
0:04:42.834,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but what can we do with it?

104
0:04:44.931,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We can get incredible functionality

105
0:04:47.255,000 --> 0:04:48,000
inside these little chips.

106
0:04:49.006,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Let me show you.

107
0:04:50.512,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We could, for example, mimic infection,

108
0:04:53.143,000 --> 0:04:56,000
where we add bacterial cells into the lung.

109
0:04:56.679,000 --> 0:04:58,000
then we can add human white blood cells.

110
0:04:59.611,000 --> 0:05:01,000
White blood cells are our body's defense

111
0:05:02.202,000 --> 0:05:03,000
against bacterial invaders,

112
0:05:03.57,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and when they sense this inflammation due to infection,

113
0:05:06.739,000 --> 0:05:08,000
they will enter from the blood into the lung

114
0:05:09.596,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and engulf the bacteria.

115
0:05:11.511,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Well now you're going to see this happening

116
0:05:13.759,000 --> 0:05:16,000
live in an actual human lung on a chip.

117
0:05:17.069,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We've labeled the white blood cells so you can see them flowing through,

118
0:05:20.612,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and when they detect that infection,

119
0:05:22.773,000 --> 0:05:23,000
they begin to stick.

120
0:05:24.17,000 --> 0:05:27,000
They stick, and then they try to go into the lung

121
0:05:28.057,000 --> 0:05:29,000
side from blood channel.

122
0:05:29.838,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And you can see here, we can actually visualize

123
0:05:33.527,000 --> 0:05:36,000
a single white blood cell.

124
0:05:37.286,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It sticks, it wiggles its way through

125
0:05:39.542,000 --> 0:05:41,000
between the cell layers, through the pore,

126
0:05:41.857,000 --> 0:05:43,000
comes out on the other side of the membrane,

127
0:05:44.278,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and right there, it's going to engulf the bacteria

128
0:05:47.713,000 --> 0:05:48,000
labeled in green.

129
0:05:49.362,000 --> 0:05:52,000
In that tiny chip, you just witnessed

130
0:05:52.366,000 --> 0:05:55,000
one of the most fundamental responses

131
0:05:55.547,000 --> 0:05:56,000
our body has to an infection.

132
0:05:57.504,000 --> 0:06:,000
It's the way we respond to -- an immune response.

133
0:06:01.274,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It's pretty exciting.

134
0:06:03.675,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Now I want to share this picture with you,

135
0:06:06.018,000 --> 0:06:08,000
not just because it's so beautiful,

136
0:06:08.656,000 --> 0:06:11,000
but because it tells us an enormous amount of information

137
0:06:11.992,000 --> 0:06:13,000
about what the cells are doing within the chips.

138
0:06:14.589,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It tells us that these cells

139
0:06:16.848,000 --> 0:06:18,000
from the small airways in our lungs,

140
0:06:19.159,000 --> 0:06:2,000
actually have these hairlike structures

141
0:06:20.91,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that you would expect to see in the lung.

142
0:06:22.918,000 --> 0:06:23,000
These structures are called cilia,

143
0:06:24.383,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and they actually move the mucus out of the lung.

144
0:06:27.293,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Yeah. Mucus. Yuck.

145
0:06:28.832,000 --> 0:06:3,000
But mucus is actually very important.

146
0:06:31.272,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Mucus traps particulates, viruses,

147
0:06:33.853,000 --> 0:06:34,000
potential allergens,

148
0:06:35.312,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and these little cilia move

149
0:06:36.913,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and clear the mucus out.

150
0:06:39.163,000 --> 0:06:4,000
When they get damaged, say,

151
0:06:41.075,000 --> 0:06:43,000
by cigarette smoke for example,

152
0:06:43.494,000 --> 0:06:45,000
they don't work properly, and they can't clear that mucus out.

153
0:06:46.302,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And that can lead to diseases such as bronchitis.

154
0:06:50.119,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Cilia and the clearance of mucus

155
0:06:52.766,000 --> 0:06:56,000
are also involved in awful diseases like cystic fibrosis.

156
0:06:57.227,000 --> 0:07:,000
But now, with the functionality that we get in these chips,

157
0:07:00.777,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we can begin to look

158
0:07:02.601,000 --> 0:07:04,000
for potential new treatments.

159
0:07:05.114,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We didn't stop with the lung on a chip.

160
0:07:07.066,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We have a gut on a chip.

161
0:07:08.95,000 --> 0:07:1,000
You can see one right here.

162
0:07:10.98,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And we've put intestinal human cells

163
0:07:14.206,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in a gut on a chip,

164
0:07:16.111,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and they're under constant peristaltic motion,

165
0:07:18.948,000 --> 0:07:21,000
this trickling flow through the cells,

166
0:07:22.139,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and we can mimic many of the functions

167
0:07:24.697,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that you actually would expect to see

168
0:07:26.96,000 --> 0:07:27,000
in the human intestine.

169
0:07:28.653,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Now we can begin to create models of diseases

170
0:07:32.444,000 --> 0:07:34,000
such as irritable bowel syndrome.

171
0:07:34.854,000 --> 0:07:36,000
This is a disease that affects

172
0:07:36.936,000 --> 0:07:37,000
a large number of individuals.

173
0:07:38.847,000 --> 0:07:39,000
It's really debilitating,

174
0:07:40.621,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and there aren't really many good treatments for it.

175
0:07:44.563,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Now we have a whole pipeline

176
0:07:46.865,000 --> 0:07:48,000
of different organ chips

177
0:07:49.144,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that we are currently working on in our labs.

178
0:07:52.876,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now, the true power of this technology, however,

179
0:07:56.295,000 --> 0:07:58,000
really comes from the fact

180
0:07:58.42,000 --> 0:08:,000
that we can fluidically link them.

181
0:08:00.965,000 --> 0:08:01,000
There's fluid flowing across these cells,

182
0:08:02.912,000 --> 0:08:04,000
so we can begin to interconnect

183
0:08:04.991,000 --> 0:08:06,000
multiple different chips together

184
0:08:07.853,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to form what we call a virtual human on a chip.

185
0:08:12.066,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Now we're really getting excited.

186
0:08:15.075,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We're not going to ever recreate a whole human in these chips,

187
0:08:19.17,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but what our goal is is to be able to recreate

188
0:08:23.339,000 --> 0:08:25,000
sufficient functionality

189
0:08:25.352,000 --> 0:08:27,000
so that we can make better predictions

190
0:08:27.712,000 --> 0:08:29,000
of what's going to happen in humans.

191
0:08:29.926,000 --> 0:08:31,000
For example, now we can begin to explore

192
0:08:32.85,000 --> 0:08:35,000
what happens when we put a drug like an aerosol drug.

193
0:08:36.284,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Those of you like me who have asthma, when you take your inhaler,

194
0:08:39.27,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we can explore how that drug comes into your lungs,

195
0:08:42.196,000 --> 0:08:43,000
how it enters the body,

196
0:08:43.822,000 --> 0:08:44,000
how it might affect, say, your heart.

197
0:08:45.576,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Does it change the beating of your heart?

198
0:08:47.484,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Does it have a toxicity?

199
0:08:49.125,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Does it get cleared by the liver?

200
0:08:51.133,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Is it metabolized in the liver?

201
0:08:53.285,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Is it excreted in your kidneys?

202
0:08:55.176,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We can begin to study the dynamic

203
0:08:57.388,000 --> 0:08:59,000
response of the body to a drug.

204
0:09:00.028,000 --> 0:09:01,000
This could really revolutionize

205
0:09:01.947,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and be a game changer

206
0:09:03.596,000 --> 0:09:05,000
for not only the pharmaceutical industry,

207
0:09:06.534,000 --> 0:09:08,000
but a whole host of different industries,

208
0:09:08.907,000 --> 0:09:1,000
including the cosmetics industry.

209
0:09:11.307,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We can potentially use the skin on a chip

210
0:09:14.189,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that we're currently developing in the lab

211
0:09:16.15,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to test whether the ingredients in those products

212
0:09:18.704,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that you're using are actually safe to put on your skin

213
0:09:21.987,000 --> 0:09:23,000
without the need for animal testing.

214
0:09:24.676,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We could test the safety

215
0:09:26.62,000 --> 0:09:28,000
of chemicals that we are exposed to

216
0:09:28.873,000 --> 0:09:29,000
on a daily basis in our environment,

217
0:09:30.787,000 --> 0:09:33,000
such as chemicals in regular household cleaners.

218
0:09:34.518,000 --> 0:09:37,000
We could also use the organs on chips

219
0:09:37.72,000 --> 0:09:39,000
for applications in bioterrorism

220
0:09:40.499,000 --> 0:09:42,000
or radiation exposure.

221
0:09:43.07,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We could use them to learn more about

222
0:09:46.42,000 --> 0:09:49,000
diseases such as ebola

223
0:09:49.464,000 --> 0:09:52,000
or other deadly diseases such as SARS.

224
0:09:53.356,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Organs on chips could also change

225
0:09:55.194,000 --> 0:09:58,000
the way we do clinical trials in the future.

226
0:09:58.568,000 --> 0:10:,000
Right now, the average participant

227
0:10:01.155,000 --> 0:10:04,000
in a clinical trial is that: average.

228
0:10:04.525,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Tends to be middle aged, tends to be female.

229
0:10:07.851,000 --> 0:10:09,000
You won't find many clinical trials

230
0:10:10.323,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in which children are involved,

231
0:10:11.838,000 --> 0:10:14,000
yet every day, we give children medications,

232
0:10:15.385,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and the only safety data we have on that drug

233
0:10:19.131,000 --> 0:10:22,000
is one that we obtained from adults.

234
0:10:22.205,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Children are not adults.

235
0:10:23.999,000 --> 0:10:26,000
They may not respond in the same way adults do.

236
0:10:27.132,000 --> 0:10:29,000
There are other things like genetic differences

237
0:10:29.544,000 --> 0:10:3,000
in populations

238
0:10:30.977,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that may lead to at-risk populations

239
0:10:34.083,000 --> 0:10:37,000
that are at risk of having an adverse drug reaction.

240
0:10:37.52,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Now imagine if we could take cells from all those different populations,

241
0:10:40.919,000 --> 0:10:41,000
put them on chips,

242
0:10:42.827,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and create populations on a chip.

243
0:10:44.791,000 --> 0:10:45,000
This could really change the way

244
0:10:46.629,000 --> 0:10:48,000
we do clinical trials.

245
0:10:48.698,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And this is the team and the people that are doing this.

246
0:10:51.53,000 --> 0:10:54,000
We have engineers, we have cell biologists,

247
0:10:54.787,000 --> 0:10:57,000
we have clinicians, all working together.

248
0:10:58.561,000 --> 0:10:59,000
We're really seeing something quite incredible

249
0:11:00.487,000 --> 0:11:01,000
at the Wyss Institute.

250
0:11:02.092,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It's really a convergence of disciplines,

251
0:11:04.263,000 --> 0:11:07,000
where biology is influencing the way we design,

252
0:11:07.983,000 --> 0:11:09,000
the way we engineer, the way we build.

253
0:11:10.645,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It's pretty exciting.

254
0:11:12.048,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We're establishing important industry collaborations

255
0:11:15.612,000 --> 0:11:18,000
such as the one we have with a company

256
0:11:18.985,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that has expertise in large-scale digital manufacturing.

257
0:11:22.584,000 --> 0:11:24,000
They're going to help us make,

258
0:11:24.603,000 --> 0:11:25,000
instead of one of these,

259
0:11:26.129,000 --> 0:11:27,000
millions of these chips,

260
0:11:27.712,000 --> 0:11:28,000
so that we can get them into the hands

261
0:11:29.381,000 --> 0:11:31,000
of as many researchers as possible.

262
0:11:32.27,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And this is key to the potential of that technology.

263
0:11:36.486,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Now let me show you our instrument.

264
0:11:39.023,000 --> 0:11:4,000
This is an instrument that our engineers

265
0:11:41.012,000 --> 0:11:43,000
are actually prototyping right now in the lab,

266
0:11:43.63,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and this instrument is going to give us

267
0:11:45.939,000 --> 0:11:47,000
the engineering controls that we're going to require

268
0:11:48.398,000 --> 0:11:52,000
in order to link 10 or more organ chips together.

269
0:11:52.566,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It does something else that's very important.

270
0:11:54.795,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It creates an easy user interface.

271
0:11:57.639,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So a cell biologist like me can come in,

272
0:12:00.629,000 --> 0:12:02,000
take a chip, put it in a cartridge

273
0:12:02.637,000 --> 0:12:03,000
like the prototype you see there,

274
0:12:04.569,000 --> 0:12:06,000
put the cartridge into the machine

275
0:12:06.64,000 --> 0:12:07,000
just like you would a C.D.,

276
0:12:08.128,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and away you go.

277
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Plug and play. Easy.

278
0:12:12.009,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Now, let's imagine a little bit

279
0:12:14.523,000 --> 0:12:15,000
what the future might look like

280
0:12:15.902,000 --> 0:12:17,000
if I could take your stem cells

281
0:12:18.315,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and put them on a chip,

282
0:12:19.755,000 --> 0:12:22,000
or your stem cells and put them on a chip.

283
0:12:22.974,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It would be a personalized chip just for you.

284
0:12:26.475,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Now all of us in here are individuals,

285
0:12:29.683,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and those individual differences mean

286
0:12:32.521,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that we could react very differently

287
0:12:34.963,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and sometimes in unpredictable ways to drugs.

288
0:12:39.21,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I myself, a couple of years back, had a really bad headache,

289
0:12:43.778,000 --> 0:12:45,000
just couldn't shake it, thought, "Well, I'll try something different."

290
0:12:46.191,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I took some Advil. Fifteen minutes later,

291
0:12:48.326,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I was on my way to the emergency room

292
0:12:50.206,000 --> 0:12:51,000
with a full-blown asthma attack.

293
0:12:52.099,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Now, obviously it wasn't fatal,

294
0:12:53.929,000 --> 0:12:56,000
but unfortunately, some of these

295
0:12:57.102,000 --> 0:13:,000
adverse drug reactions can be fatal.

296
0:13:00.711,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So how do we prevent them?

297
0:13:02.652,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Well, we could imagine one day

298
0:13:05.232,000 --> 0:13:07,000
having Geraldine on a chip,

299
0:13:07.575,000 --> 0:13:08,000
having Danielle on a chip,

300
0:13:09.324,000 --> 0:13:1,000
having you on a chip.

301
0:13:10.797,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Personalized medicine. Thank you.

302
0:13:13.185,000 --> 0:13:17,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So I'm going to talk today about collecting stories

2
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in some unconventional ways.

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
This is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life.

4
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
You might enjoy the awkwardly tight, cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons.

5
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Anyway, it was a time when I was mainly interested

6
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
in collecting imaginary stories.

7
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
So this is a picture of me

8
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
holding one of the first watercolor paintings I ever made.

9
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And recently I've been much more interested in collecting stories

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
from reality -- so, real stories.

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And specifically, I'm interested in collecting my own stories,

12
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
stories from the Internet, and then recently, stories from life,

13
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
which is kind of a new area of work that I've been doing recently.

14
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So I'll be talking about each of those today.

15
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
So, first of all, my own stories. These are two of my sketchbooks.

16
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I have many of these books,

17
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and I've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years.

18
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
They accompany me wherever I go in my life,

19
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and I fill them with all sorts of things,

20
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
records of my lived experience:

21
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
so watercolor paintings, drawings of what I see,

22
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
dead flowers, dead insects, pasted ticket stubs, rusting coins,

23
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
business cards, writings.

24
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And in these books, you can find these short, little glimpses

25
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
of moments and experiences and people that I meet.

26
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And, you know, after keeping these books for a number of years,

27
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I started to become very interested in collecting

28
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
not only my own personal artifacts,

29
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but also the artifacts of other people.

30
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So, I started collecting found objects.

31
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This is a photograph I found lying in a gutter in New York City

32
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
about 10 years ago.

33
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
On the front, you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman's face,

34
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and on the back it says, "To Judy, the girl with the Bill Bailey voice.

35
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Have fun in whatever you do."

36
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And I really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody's life.

37
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
As opposed to knowing the whole story, just knowing a little bit of the story,

38
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and then letting your own mind fill in the rest.

39
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And that idea of a partial glimpse is something

40
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that will come back in a lot of the work I'll be showing later today.

41
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So, around this time I was studying computer science at Princeton University,

42
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and I noticed that it was suddenly possible

43
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to collect these sorts of personal artifacts,

44
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
not just from street corners, but also from the Internet.

45
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And that suddenly, people, en masse, were leaving scores and scores

46
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives.

47
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Blog posts, photographs, thoughts, feelings, opinions,

48
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
all of these things were being expressed by people online,

49
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and leaving behind trails.

50
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So, I started to write computer programs

51
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that study very, very large sets of these online footprints.

52
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
One such project is about a year and a half old.

53
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It's called "We Feel Fine."

54
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This is a project that scans the world's newly posted blog entries

55
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
every two or three minutes, searching for occurrences of the phrases

56
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
"I feel" and "I am feeling." And when it finds one of those phrases,

57
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
it grabs the full sentence up to the period

58
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and also tries to identify demographic information about the author.

59
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So, their gender, their age, their geographic location

60
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence.

61
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It collects about 20,000 such sentences a day

62
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and it's been running for about a year and a half,

63
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now.

64
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
This is, then, how they're presented.

65
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
These dots here represent some of the English-speaking world's

66
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
feelings from the last few hours,

67
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger.

68
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside,

69
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
so the bright ones are happy, and the dark ones are sad.

70
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And the diameter of each dot corresponds

71
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to the length of the sentence inside.

72
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So the small ones are short, and the bigger ones are longer.

73
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
"I feel fine with the body I'm in, there'll be no easy excuse

74
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
for why I still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend,"

75
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
from a twenty-two-year-old in Japan.

76
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
"I got this on some trading locally,

77
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
but really don't feel like screwing with wiring and crap."

78
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Also, some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts.

79
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And when that happens, these montage compositions are automatically created,

80
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
which consist of the sentence and images being combined.

81
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside.

82
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
"I feel good."

83
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
"I feel rough now, and I probably gained 100,000 pounds,

84
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but it was worth it."

85
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
"I love how they were able to preserve most in everything

86
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies,

87
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
man-made forests, limestone caves and hey, even a huge python."

88
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So the next movement is called mobs.

89
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
This provides a slightly more statistical look at things.

90
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
This is showing the world's most common feelings overall right now,

91
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
dominated by better, then bad, then good, then guilty, and so on.

92
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits

93
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
of the weather they represent. So the sunny ones swirl around,

94
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the cloudy ones float along, the rainy ones fall down,

95
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and the snowy ones flutter to the ground.

96
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
You can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside.

97
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Finally, location causes the feelings to move to their spots

98
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
on a world map, giving you a sense of their geographic distribution.

99
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I'll show you now some of my favorite montages from "We Feel Fine."

100
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
These are the images that are automatically constructed.

101
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
"I feel like I'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe."

102
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"I've kissed numerous other boys and it hasn't felt good,

104
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
the kisses felt messy and wrong,

105
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but kissing Lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual."

106
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
"I can feel my cancer grow."

107
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
"I feel pretty."

108
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
"I feel skinny, but I'm not."

109
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"I'm 23, and a recovering meth and heroin addict,

110
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive."

111
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
"I can't wait to see them racing for the first time at Daytona next month,

112
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
because I feel the need for speed."

113
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
"I feel sassy."

115
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
"I feel so sexy in this new wig."

116
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
As you can see, "We Feel Fine" collects

117
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
very, very small-scale personal stories.

118
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Sometimes, stories as short as two or three words.

119
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So, really even challenging the notion

120
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
of what can be considered a story.

121
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And recently, I've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story.

122
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And that's led me to doing some work with the physical world,

123
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
not with the Internet,

124
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and only using the Internet at the very last moment, as a presentation medium.

125
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
So these are some newer projects that

126
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
actually aren't even launched publicly yet.

127
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The first such one is called "The Whale Hunt."

128
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Last May, I spent nine days living up in Barrow, Alaska,

129
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the northernmost settlement in the United States,

130
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
with a family of Inupiat Eskimos,

131
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
documenting their annual spring whale hunt.

132
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
This is the whaling camp here, we're about six miles from shore,

133
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
camping on five and a half feet of thick, frozen pack ice.

134
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And that water that you see there is the open lead,

135
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and through that lead, bowhead whales migrate north each springtime.

136
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And the Eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here,

137
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
waits for a whale to come close enough to attack. And when it does,

138
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
it throws a harpoon at it, and then hauls the whale up

139
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
under the ice, and cuts it up.

140
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And that would provide the community's food supply for a long time.

141
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So I went up there, and I lived with these guys

142
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
out in their whaling camp here, and photographed the entire experience,

143
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
beginning with the taxi ride to Newark airport in New York,

144
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and ending with the butchering of the second whale, seven and a half days later.

145
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals.

146
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So every five minutes, I took a photograph.

147
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
When I was awake, with the camera around my neck.

148
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
When I was sleeping, with a tripod and a timer.

149
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And then in moments of high adrenaline,

150
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
like when something exciting was happening,

151
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I would up that photographic frequency to as many as

152
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
37 photographs in five minutes.

153
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So what this created was a photographic heartbeat

154
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that sped up and slowed down, more or less matching

155
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the changing pace of my own heartbeat.

156
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
That was the first concept here.

157
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
The second concept was to use this experience to think about

158
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the fundamental components of any story.

159
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
What are the things that make up a story?

160
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So, stories have characters. Stories have concepts.

161
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Stories take place in a certain area. They have contexts.

162
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They have colors. What do they look like?

163
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They have time. When did it take place? Dates -- when did it occur?

164
0:07:34.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And in the case of the whale hunt, also this idea of an excitement level.

165
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
The thing about stories, though, in most of the existing mediums

166
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that we're accustomed to -- things like novels, radio,

167
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
photographs, movies, even lectures like this one --

168
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
we're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position,

169
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
some kind of omniscient, external body

170
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
through whose eyes you see the story.

171
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
We're very used to this.

172
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But if you think about real life, it's not like that at all.

173
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
I mean, in real life, things are much more nuanced and complex,

174
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and there's all of these overlapping stories

175
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
intersecting and touching each other.

176
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And so I thought it would be interesting to build a framework

177
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to surface those types of stories. So, in the case of "The Whale Hunt,"

178
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
how could we extract something like the story of Simeon and Crawford,

179
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
involving the concepts of wildlife, tools and blood, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,

180
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
dominated by the color red, happening around 10 a.m. on May 3,

181
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
with an excitement level of high?

182
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
So, how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story?

183
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I built a web interface for viewing "The Whale Hunt" that attempts to do just this.

184
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there.

185
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This is my studio in Brooklyn. This is the Arctic Ocean,

186
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and the butchering of the second whale, seven days later.

187
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
You can start to see some of the story here, told by color.

188
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper

189
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in the basement apartment where I was staying.

190
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean.

191
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Introduction of red down here, when whales are being cut up.

192
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
You can see a timeline, showing you the exciting moments throughout the story.

193
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
These are organized chronologically.

194
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same,

195
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically.

196
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And any of these can be clicked,

197
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and then the narrative is entered at that position.

198
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So here I am sleeping on the airplane heading up to Alaska.

199
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
That's "Moby Dick."

200
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
This is the food we ate.

201
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
This is in the Patkotak's family living room

202
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
in their house in Barrow. The boxed wine they served us.

203
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Cigarette break outside -- I don't smoke.

204
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
This is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping.

205
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
This is out at whale camp, on the Arctic Ocean.

206
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
This graph that I'm clicking down here is meant to be

207
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph,

208
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
showing the exciting moments of adrenaline.

209
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This is the ice starting to freeze over. The snow fence they built.

210
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And so what I'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories.

211
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So, here you see the cast. These are all of the people in "The Whale Hunt"

212
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and the two whales that were killed down here.

213
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And we could do something as arbitrary as, say,

214
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
extract the story of Rony, involving the concepts of blood

215
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and whales and tools, taking place on the Arctic Ocean,

216
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
at Ahkivgaq camp, with the heartbeat level of fast.

217
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And now we've whittled down that whole story

218
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to just 29 matching photographs,

219
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and then we can enter the narrative at that position.

220
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And you can see Rony cutting up the whale here.

221
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
These whales are about 40 feet long,

222
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and weighing over 40 tons. And they provide the food source

223
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
for the community for much of the year.

224
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Skipping ahead a bit more here, this is Rony on the whale carcass.

225
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
They use no chainsaws or anything; it's entirely just blades,

226
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and an incredibly efficient process.

227
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
This is the guys on the rope, pulling open the carcass.

228
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
This is the muktuk, or the blubber, all lined up for community distribution.

229
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It's baleen. Moving on.

230
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So what I'm going to tell you about next

231
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
is a very new thing. It's not even a project yet.

232
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So, just yesterday, I flew in here from Singapore, and before that,

233
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I was spending two weeks in Bhutan, the small Himalayan kingdom

234
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
nestled between Tibet and India.

235
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And I was doing a project there about happiness,

236
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
interviewing a lot of local people.

237
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So Bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base

238
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
most of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept

239
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product,

240
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and they've been doing this since the '70s.

241
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And it leads to just a completely different value system.

242
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It's an incredibly non-materialistic culture,

243
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
where people don't have a lot, but they're incredibly happy.

244
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So I went around and I talked to people about some of these ideas.

245
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So, I did a number of things. I asked people a number of set questions,

246
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and took a number of set photographs,

247
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and interviewed them with audio, and also took pictures.

248
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I would start by asking people to rate their happiness

249
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
between one and 10, which is kind of inherently absurd.

250
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And then when they answered, I would inflate that number of balloons

251
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and give them that number of balloons to hold.

252
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So, you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons,

253
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
and some really sad soul holding one balloon.

254
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But you know, even holding one balloon is like, kind of happy.

255
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Laughter)

256
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And then I would ask them a number of questions like

257
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
what was the happiest day in their life, what makes them happy.

258
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And then finally, I would ask them to make a wish.

259
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And when they made a wish, I would write their wish

260
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it.

261
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So I'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets

262
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
of some of the interviews that I did, some of the people I spoke with.

263
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
This is an 11-year-old student.

264
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
He was playing cops and robbers with his friends, running around town,

265
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and they all had plastic toy guns.

266
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
His wish was to become a police officer.

267
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
He was getting started early. Those were his hands.

268
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I took pictures of everybody's hands,

269
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
because I think you can often tell a lot about somebody

270
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
from how their hands look. I took a portrait of everybody,

271
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and asked everybody to make a funny face.

272
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
A 17-year-old student. Her wish was to have been born a boy.

273
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
She thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in Bhutan,

274
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and it's a lot easier if you're a boy.

275
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
A 28-year-old cell phone shop owner.

276
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
If you knew what Paro looked like, you'd understand

277
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
how amazing it is that there's a cell phone shop there.

278
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
He wanted to help poor people.

279
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
A 53-year-old farmer. She was chaffing wheat,

280
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and that pile of wheat behind her

281
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
had taken her about a week to make.

282
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
She wanted to keep farming until she dies.

283
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
You can really start to see the stories told by the hands here.

284
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
She was wearing this silver ring that had the word "love" engraved on it,

285
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and she'd found it in the road somewhere.

286
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
A 16-year-old quarry worker.

287
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
This guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight,

288
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer.

289
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
A 21-year-old monk. He was very happy.

290
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
He wanted to live a long life at the monastery.

291
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
He had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face,

292
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
which I'm told is very good luck.

293
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
He was kind of too shy to make a funny face.

294
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
A 16-year-old student.

295
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
She wanted to become an independent woman.

296
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I asked her about that, and she said she meant

297
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that she doesn't want to be married,

298
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
because, in her opinion, when you get married in Bhutan as a woman,

299
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
your chances to live an independent life kind of end,

300
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and so she had no interest in that.

301
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
A 24-year-old truck driver.

302
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
There are these terrifyingly huge Indian trucks

303
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic,

304
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road,

305
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and he was driving one of these trucks.

306
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
But all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life, like other people.

307
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
A 24-year-old road sweeper. I caught her on her lunch break.

308
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
She'd built a little fire to keep warm, right next to the road.

309
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Her wish was to marry someone with a car.

310
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
She wanted a change in her life.

311
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
She lives in a little worker's camp right next to the road,

312
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and she wanted a different lot on things.

313
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
An 81-year-old itinerant farmer.

314
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
I saw this guy on the side of the road,

315
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and he actually doesn't have a home.

316
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
He travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work,

317
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at.

318
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
So his wish was to come with me, so that he had somewhere to live.

319
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
He had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho

320
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and started brandishing when I asked him to make a funny face.

321
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
It was all good-natured.

322
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
A 10-year-old.

323
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
He wanted to join a school and learn to read,

324
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
but his parents didn't have enough money to send him to school.

325
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
He was eating this orange, sugary candy

326
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
that he kept dipping his fingers into,

327
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and since there was so much saliva on his hands,

328
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
this orange paste started to form on his palms.

329
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
(Laughter)

330
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
A 37-year-old road worker.

331
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
One of the more touchy political subjects in Bhutan

332
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
is the use of Indian cheap labor

333
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
that they import from India to build the roads,

334
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:45,000
and then they send these people home once the roads are built.

335
0:16:45.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
So these guys were in a worker's gang

336
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway.

337
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
His wish was to make some money and open a store.

338
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
A 75-year-old farmer. She was selling oranges on the side of the road.

339
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
I asked her about her wish, and she said,

340
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
"You know, maybe I'll live, maybe I'll die, but I don't have a wish."

341
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
She was chewing betel nut, which caused her teeth

342
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
over the years to turn very red.

343
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Finally, this is a 26-year-old nun I spoke to.

344
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Her wish was to make a pilgrimage to Tibet.

345
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said,

346
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:32,000
"Well, you know, of course, it's impermanent,

347
0:17:32.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
but my plan is to live here until I'm 30, and then enter a hermitage."

348
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
And I said, "You mean, like a cave?" And she said, "Yeah, like a cave."

349
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
And I said, "Wow, and how long will you live in the cave?"

350
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
And she said, "Well, you know,

351
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
I think I'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave."

352
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I just thought that was amazing. I mean, she spoke in a way --

353
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
with amazing English, and amazing humor, and amazing laughter --

354
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
that made her seem like somebody I could have bumped into

355
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
on the streets of New York, or in Vermont, where I'm from.

356
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
But here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years.

357
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
I asked her a little bit more about the cave

358
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
and what she planned would happen once she went there, you know.

359
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
What if she saw the truth after just one year,

360
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
what would she do for the next 35 years in her life?

361
0:18:14.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And this is what she said.

362
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Woman: I think I'm going to stay for 35. Maybe -- maybe I'll die.

363
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Jonathan Harris: Maybe you'll die? Woman: Yes.

364
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:26,000
JH: 10 years? Woman: Yes, yes. JH: 10 years, that's a long time.

365
0:18:26.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Woman: Yes, not maybe one, 10 years, maybe I can die

366
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
within one year, or something like that.

367
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
JH: Are you hoping to?

368
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Woman: Ah, because you know, it's impermanent.

369
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:41,000
JH: Yeah, but -- yeah, OK. Do you hope --

370
0:18:41.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years,

371
0:18:44.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
or to live for one year?

372
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:5,000
Woman: But I prefer for maybe 40 to 50.

373
0:18:50.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
JH: 40 to 50? Yeah.

374
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:54,000
Woman: Yes. From then, I'm going to the heaven.

375
0:18:54.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
JH: Well, I wish you the best of luck with it.

376
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
Woman: Thank you.

377
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
JH: I hope it's everything that you hope it will be.

378
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:05,000
So thank you again, so much.

379
0:19:05.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Woman: You're most welcome.

380
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:09,000
JH: So if you caught that, she said she hoped to die

381
0:19:09.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
when she was around 40. That was enough life for her.

382
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
So, the last thing we did, very quickly,

383
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
is I took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews,

384
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:21,000
117 wishes -- and I brought them up to a place called Dochula,

385
0:19:21.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
which is a mountain pass in Bhutan, at 10,300 feet,

386
0:19:25.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
one of the more sacred places in Bhutan.

387
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:3,000
And up there, there are thousands of prayer flags

388
0:19:30.16,000 --> 0:19:32,000
that people have spread out over the years.

389
0:19:32.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
And we re-inflated all of the balloons, put them up on a string,

390
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:37,000
and hung them up there among the prayer flags.

391
0:19:37.16,000 --> 0:19:39,000
And they're actually still flying up there today.

392
0:19:39.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
So if any of you have any Bhutan travel plans in the near future,

393
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:45,000
you can go check these out. Here are some images from that.

394
0:19:46.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
We said a Buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true.

395
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:02,000
You can start to see some familiar balloons here.

396
0:20:02.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
"To make some money and to open a store" was the Indian road worker.

397
0:20:15.16,000 --> 0:20:17,000
Thanks very much.

398
0:20:17.16,000 --> 0:20:2,000
(Applause)

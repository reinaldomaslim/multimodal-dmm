Workplace romance can be a tricky topic.

[The Way We Work]

5
0:00:17.232,000 --> 0:00:18,000
How do we manage the boundaries

6
0:00:19.009,000 --> 0:00:21,000
between our personal and professional lives?

7
0:00:21.335,000 --> 0:00:24,000
How do we deal with gender imbalances and power dynamics in the workplace?

8
0:00:25.114,000 --> 0:00:27,000
There's a lot of gray area in workplace romance.

9
0:00:27.578,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'd like to take a few minutes

10
0:00:28.978,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and answer some of your frequently asked questions.

11
0:00:30.977,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So, question one: Should I date my coworker?

12
0:00:34.197,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Uh ... it depends.

13
0:00:36.576,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Do you want to date your coworker for a bit of fun?

14
0:00:38.728,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Do you want to date your coworker to hook up?

15
0:00:40.557,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Because then you're really better off on Tinder.

16
0:00:42.537,000 --> 0:00:43,000
If you want to date your coworker

17
0:00:44.206,000 --> 0:00:46,000
because you really, sincerely think you're falling in love with them

18
0:00:47.176,000 --> 0:00:51,000
or there's a real potential for a long-term, committed relationship,

19
0:00:51.614,000 --> 0:00:52,000
maybe you should date your coworker.

20
0:00:53.536,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Studies show that your coworkers are generally positive about it

21
0:00:56.267,000 --> 0:00:58,000
if they perceive that you're falling in love

22
0:00:58.502,000 --> 0:01:,000
and genuinely care about each other.

23
0:01:01.026,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's when your coworkers sense that something else is in play --

24
0:01:04.095,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that can be disruptive.

25
0:01:05.513,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Question two:

26
0:01:06.725,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Should I date my boss?

27
0:01:08.384,000 --> 0:01:1,000
In almost all cases, no, you should not date your boss,

28
0:01:11.396,000 --> 0:01:13,000
because now, you've got a power dynamic.

29
0:01:14.009,000 --> 0:01:16,000
When there's a relationship between a boss and a subordinate,

30
0:01:16.605,000 --> 0:01:18,000
it generates a lot of negative feelings,

31
0:01:19.537,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and the negative feelings tend to fall on the person

32
0:01:21.703,000 --> 0:01:22,000
who's lower on the totem pole.

33
0:01:23.437,000 --> 0:01:24,000
People usually assume some kind of favoritism,

34
0:01:25.094,000 --> 0:01:27,000
some kind of inside knowledge,

35
0:01:27.134,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and there can be resentment stirred up by that.

36
0:01:29.373,000 --> 0:01:3,000
There was a study published last year

37
0:01:31.159,000 --> 0:01:36,000
that suggested dating a superior can even have a negative impact on your career.

38
0:01:36.504,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The researchers asked third-party evaluators online

39
0:01:39.399,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to imagine that they worked at a law firm.

40
0:01:41.961,000 --> 0:01:44,000
They asked them to make recommendations on which employee should get picked

41
0:01:45.557,000 --> 0:01:46,000
for a special training program

42
0:01:47.098,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and which should get promoted to partner.

43
0:01:49.566,000 --> 0:01:51,000
They looked at credentials for imaginary employees,

44
0:01:52.392,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and when it was stated that an employee had been dating

45
0:01:55.417,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or was in a relationship with a superior,

46
0:01:58.077,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the evaluators were less likely to pick that person for the training program

47
0:02:02.646,000 --> 0:02:03,000
or the promotion,

48
0:02:03.915,000 --> 0:02:05,000
even if they had the exact same credentials

49
0:02:06.447,000 --> 0:02:08,000
as someone who wasn't dating their boss.

50
0:02:09.056,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The evaluators were also quick to dismiss their accomplishments.

51
0:02:12.932,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Question three:

52
0:02:14.106,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Can I date someone who reports to me?

53
0:02:16.367,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Still a big no.

54
0:02:17.558,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You may not feel like you're really the boss, right?

55
0:02:21.006,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But you are, and there's a power dynamic there

56
0:02:23.615,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that's simply not there for other couples.

57
0:02:25.918,000 --> 0:02:31,000
If you really believe there is a sincere, honestly felt, personal connection

58
0:02:32.078,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that would be lasting and meaningful,

59
0:02:34.313,000 --> 0:02:35,000
one of you may need to move,

60
0:02:36.282,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and it shouldn't always be the person who's lower in the company pecking order.

61
0:02:41.265,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Question four:

62
0:02:42.495,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I've just started seeing a coworker.

63
0:02:44.717,000 --> 0:02:45,000
How do we handle things?

64
0:02:46.186,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I get this question a lot.

65
0:02:47.464,000 --> 0:02:49,000
"Are they dating? Are they not dating?"

66
0:02:49.616,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Don't keep it a secret.

67
0:02:50.886,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You don't have to make a big deal of it, but secrecy tends to be corrosive.

68
0:02:54.507,000 --> 0:02:57,000
People tend to see workplace couples as a coalition or a unit,

69
0:02:58.518,000 --> 0:03:01,000
so try to make it clear to your coworkers that you're not the same person;

70
0:03:02.308,000 --> 0:03:04,000
you love each other, but you are going to disagree.

71
0:03:05.423,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Question five:

72
0:03:06.597,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Why are coworkers often attracted to each other?

73
0:03:09.741,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Well, the obvious answer is people tend to be attracted to each other

74
0:03:13.276,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the more time they spend together.

75
0:03:15.117,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But there's another ingredient that has to be added:

76
0:03:17.625,000 --> 0:03:18,000
attraction tends to happen

77
0:03:19.443,000 --> 0:03:22,000
when there's work that demands close collaboration.

78
0:03:22.52,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So imagine you have a big group project with a tight deadline

79
0:03:26.256,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and you're working late nights and brainstorming ideas.

80
0:03:29.856,000 --> 0:03:3,000
You look up, and across the table,

81
0:03:31.567,000 --> 0:03:33,000
one of your colleagues throws out a really great idea.

82
0:03:34.468,000 --> 0:03:36,000
You may feel something, and that's natural.

83
0:03:37.393,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We call this task interdependence.

84
0:03:39.487,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It's a ripe ground for attraction.

85
0:03:41.685,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The second reason why people at work are attracted to each other

86
0:03:45.216,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is they may often be similar to each other.

87
0:03:48.196,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There's two old adages:

88
0:03:49.948,000 --> 0:03:52,000
"Birds of a feather flock together." And "Opposites attract."

89
0:03:53.082,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Well, the psychological research suggests ...

90
0:03:56.673,000 --> 0:03:58,000
birds of a feather flock together,

91
0:03:58.845,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and we like people who are like us.

92
0:04:00.744,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Question six:

93
0:04:01.913,000 --> 0:04:02,000
My coworkers are flirting.

94
0:04:03.761,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I'm annoyed. What do I do?

95
0:04:05.628,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Some researchers argue that for people flirting at work,

96
0:04:09.176,000 --> 0:04:11,000
flirting is good and it boosts creativity.

97
0:04:11.58,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But my own research suggests things are different

98
0:04:14.538,000 --> 0:04:18,000
for people who are watching or who are subjected to the flirting.

99
0:04:18.817,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It can be awkward, right?

100
0:04:20.27,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Witnessing flirtation in the workplace creates a sense of not knowing the rules,

101
0:04:24.421,000 --> 0:04:25,000
not knowing what's going on,

102
0:04:26.231,000 --> 0:04:29,000
or maybe seeing something that you shouldn't be seeing.

103
0:04:29.279,000 --> 0:04:31,000
People who frequently witness flirting at work --

104
0:04:31.923,000 --> 0:04:34,000
they actually report feeling less satisfied in their jobs,

105
0:04:34.977,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and they feel less valued by their company.

106
0:04:37.218,000 --> 0:04:4,000
They're more likely to give a negative appraisal of the work environment,

107
0:04:40.907,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and they may even consider leaving.

108
0:04:42.655,000 --> 0:04:44,000
For women, this association can be even stronger.

109
0:04:45.555,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This appears to be the case

110
0:04:46.936,000 --> 0:04:49,000
even when people report not being bothered by the flirting.

111
0:04:50.395,000 --> 0:04:52,000
It's true even when they say they enjoy it.

112
0:04:52.641,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So, a flirtatious environment really could be toxic.

113
0:04:56.426,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Question seven:

114
0:04:57.448,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Do I need a policy on workplace relationships?

115
0:05:00.466,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You certainly need a policy on a sexual harassment,

116
0:05:02.922,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and I think most HR departments recognize that.

117
0:05:05.689,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But for the kind of consensual behavior we've been talking about,

118
0:05:08.761,000 --> 0:05:09,000
it's a little different.

119
0:05:09.96,000 --> 0:05:12,000
As much as people in HR would love to wave a magic wand

120
0:05:13.581,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and say, "Thou shall not fall in love at work,"

121
0:05:16.356,000 --> 0:05:17,000
it's just not realistic.

122
0:05:17.96,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Emotional connection and sexuality is who we are.

123
0:05:21.152,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I kind of want you to flip the script a little bit.

124
0:05:23.695,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I encourage HR to really think more broadly

125
0:05:27.411,000 --> 0:05:3,000
about their role in not necessarily stamping out office romance,

126
0:05:31.305,000 --> 0:05:32,000
because I don't think that's realistic,

127
0:05:33.282,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but how do I help create a workplace climate and culture

128
0:05:37.505,000 --> 0:05:41,000
where people feel respected for their individual contributions,

129
0:05:41.823,000 --> 0:05:43,000
not for their appearance or their gender,

130
0:05:44.748,000 --> 0:05:45,000
or their personal relationships?

131
0:05:46.765,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So the larger question is,

132
0:05:48.268,000 --> 0:05:52,000
how do you make sure people are valued and respected?

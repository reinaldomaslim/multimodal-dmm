1
0:00:12.883,000 --> 0:00:15,000
This is our life with bees,

2
0:00:16.863,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and this is our life without bees.

3
0:00:20.586,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Bees are the most important pollinators

4
0:00:23.054,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of our fruits and vegetables and flowers

5
0:00:25.863,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and crops like alfalfa hay that feed our farm animals.

6
0:00:29.522,000 --> 0:00:31,000
More than one third of the world's crop production

7
0:00:32.21,000 --> 0:00:34,000
is dependent on bee pollination.

8
0:00:34.992,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But the ironic thing is that bees are not out there

9
0:00:37.829,000 --> 0:00:39,000
pollinating our food intentionally.

10
0:00:40.746,000 --> 0:00:42,000
They're out there because they need to eat.

11
0:00:43.617,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Bees get all of the protein they need in their diet

12
0:00:46.336,000 --> 0:00:47,000
from pollen

13
0:00:47.665,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and all of the carbohydrates they need from nectar.

14
0:00:50.601,000 --> 0:00:51,000
They're flower-feeders,

15
0:00:52.366,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and as they move from flower to flower,

16
0:00:54.3,000 --> 0:00:57,000
basically on a shopping trip at the local floral mart,

17
0:00:57.771,000 --> 0:01:01,000
they end up providing this valuable pollination service.

18
0:01:02.226,000 --> 0:01:04,000
In parts of the world where there are no bees,

19
0:01:04.746,000 --> 0:01:06,000
or where they plant varieties that are not attractive to bees,

20
0:01:07.652,000 --> 0:01:11,000
people are paid to do the business of pollination by hand.

21
0:01:11.858,000 --> 0:01:14,000
These people are moving pollen from flower to flower

22
0:01:15.542,000 --> 0:01:16,000
with a paintbrush.

23
0:01:17.441,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now this business of hand pollination

24
0:01:19.887,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is actually not that uncommon.

25
0:01:21.973,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Tomato growers often pollinate their tomato flowers

26
0:01:25.325,000 --> 0:01:27,000
with a hand-held vibrator.

27
0:01:27.982,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now this one's the tomato tickler. (Laughter)

28
0:01:31.926,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now this is because the pollen within a tomato flower

29
0:01:37.206,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is held very securely within

30
0:01:38.986,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the male part of the flower, the anther,

31
0:01:41.486,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and the only way to release this pollen is to vibrate it.

32
0:01:44.86,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So bumblebees are one of the few kinds of bees in the world

33
0:01:48.546,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that are able to hold onto the flower and vibrate it,

34
0:01:51.669,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and they do this by shaking their flight muscles

35
0:01:54.261,000 --> 0:01:58,000
at a frequency similar to the musical note C.

36
0:01:58.813,000 --> 0:02:,000
So they vibrate the flower, they sonicate it,

37
0:02:01.399,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and that releases the pollen in this efficient swoosh,

38
0:02:04.446,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and the pollen gathers all over the fuzzy bee's body,

39
0:02:07.185,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and she takes it home as food.

40
0:02:09.682,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Tomato growers now put bumblebee colonies

41
0:02:12.523,000 --> 0:02:14,000
inside the greenhouse to pollinate the tomatoes

42
0:02:15.054,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because they get much more efficient pollination

43
0:02:17.417,000 --> 0:02:18,000
when it's done naturally

44
0:02:18.912,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and they get better quality tomatoes.

45
0:02:22.474,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So there's other, maybe more personal reasons,

46
0:02:26.061,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to care about bees.

47
0:02:27.484,000 --> 0:02:31,000
There's over 20,000 species of bees in the world,

48
0:02:31.656,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and they're absolutely gorgeous.

49
0:02:34.662,000 --> 0:02:36,000
These bees spend the majority of their life cycle

50
0:02:37.281,000 --> 0:02:39,000
hidden in the ground or within a hollow stem

51
0:02:40.101,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and very few of these beautiful species

52
0:02:42.801,000 --> 0:02:45,000
have evolved highly social behavior like honeybees.

53
0:02:46.234,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Now honeybees tend to be the charismatic representative

54
0:02:49.854,000 --> 0:02:52,000
for the other 19,900-plus species

55
0:02:53.023,000 --> 0:02:55,000
because there's something about honeybees

56
0:02:55.664,000 --> 0:02:57,000
that draws people into their world.

57
0:02:58.513,000 --> 0:03:,000
Humans have been drawn to honeybees

58
0:03:00.96,000 --> 0:03:01,000
since early recorded history,

59
0:03:02.676,000 --> 0:03:03,000
mostly to harvest their honey,

60
0:03:04.152,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which is an amazing natural sweetener.

61
0:03:07.611,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I got drawn into the honeybee world

62
0:03:09.399,000 --> 0:03:11,000
completely by a fluke.

63
0:03:11.484,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I was 18 years old and bored,

64
0:03:13.806,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and I picked up a book in the library on bees

65
0:03:16.668,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and I spent the night reading it.

66
0:03:18.91,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I had never thought about insects

67
0:03:20.837,000 --> 0:03:21,000
living in complex societies.

68
0:03:22.56,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It was like the best of science fiction come true.

69
0:03:25.962,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And even stranger, there were these people,

70
0:03:28.856,000 --> 0:03:31,000
these beekeepers, that loved their bees like they were family,

71
0:03:32.847,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and when I put down the book, I knew I had to see this for myself.

72
0:03:36.15,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So I went to work for a commercial beekeeper,

73
0:03:38.635,000 --> 0:03:42,000
a family that owned 2,000 hives of bees in New Mexico.

74
0:03:42.832,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And I was permanently hooked.

75
0:03:46.239,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Honeybees can be considered a super-organism,

76
0:03:49.553,000 --> 0:03:51,000
where the colony is the organism

77
0:03:51.709,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and it's comprised of 40,000 to 50,000

78
0:03:54.441,000 --> 0:03:56,000
individual bee organisms.

79
0:03:57.369,000 --> 0:04:,000
Now this society has no central authority.

80
0:04:00.701,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Nobody's in charge.

81
0:04:02.297,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So how they come to collective decisions,

82
0:04:04.642,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and how they allocate their tasks and divide their labor,

83
0:04:07.622,000 --> 0:04:09,000
how they communicate where the flowers are,

84
0:04:10.104,000 --> 0:04:14,000
all of their collective social behaviors are mindblowing.

85
0:04:14.268,000 --> 0:04:17,000
My personal favorite, and one that I've studied for many years,

86
0:04:18.036,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is their system of healthcare.

87
0:04:19.981,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So bees have social healthcare.

88
0:04:23.466,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So in my lab, we study how bees keep themselves healthy.

89
0:04:27.736,000 --> 0:04:29,000
For example, we study hygiene,

90
0:04:30.075,000 --> 0:04:32,000
where some bees are able to locate and weed out

91
0:04:32.961,000 --> 0:04:35,000
sick individuals from the nest, from the colony,

92
0:04:36.128,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and it keeps the colony healthy.

93
0:04:38.592,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And more recently, we've been studying resins

94
0:04:42.019,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that bees collect from plants.

95
0:04:44.128,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So bees fly to some plants and they scrape

96
0:04:47.311,000 --> 0:04:49,000
these very, very sticky resins off the leaves,

97
0:04:49.967,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and they take them back to the nest

98
0:04:51.545,000 --> 0:04:53,000
where they cement them into the nest architecture

99
0:04:54.411,000 --> 0:04:56,000
where we call it propolis.

100
0:04:56.936,000 --> 0:05:,000
We've found that propolis is a natural disinfectant.

101
0:05:01.558,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It's a natural antibiotic.

102
0:05:03.502,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It kills off bacteria and molds and other germs

103
0:05:06.681,000 --> 0:05:07,000
within the colony,

104
0:05:08.283,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and so it bolsters the colony health and their social immunity.

105
0:05:12.246,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Humans have known about the power of propolis

106
0:05:15.537,000 --> 0:05:16,000
since biblical times.

107
0:05:17.184,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We've been harvesting propolis out of bee colonies

108
0:05:20.534,000 --> 0:05:22,000
for human medicine,

109
0:05:22.586,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but we didn't know how good it was for the bees.

110
0:05:26.25,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So honeybees have these remarkable natural defenses

111
0:05:30.303,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that have kept them healthy and thriving

112
0:05:32.992,000 --> 0:05:36,000
for over 50 million years.

113
0:05:37.249,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So seven years ago, when honeybee colonies

114
0:05:40.598,000 --> 0:05:41,000
were reported to be dying en masse,

115
0:05:42.397,000 --> 0:05:43,000
first in the United States,

116
0:05:44.369,000 --> 0:05:47,000
it was clear that there was something really, really wrong.

117
0:05:48.182,000 --> 0:05:51,000
In our collective conscience, in a really primal way,

118
0:05:51.668,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we know we can't afford to lose bees.

119
0:05:54.854,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So what's going on?

120
0:05:57.969,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Bees are dying from multiple and interacting causes,

121
0:06:02.058,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and I'll go through each of these.

122
0:06:04.54,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The bottom line is,

123
0:06:06.393,000 --> 0:06:1,000
bees dying reflects a flowerless landscape

124
0:06:10.445,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and a dysfunctional food system.

125
0:06:13.934,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now we have the best data on honeybees,

126
0:06:15.926,000 --> 0:06:16,000
so I'll use them as an example.

127
0:06:17.782,000 --> 0:06:2,000
In the United States, bees in fact have been

128
0:06:21.275,000 --> 0:06:23,000
in decline since World War II.

129
0:06:24.139,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We have half the number of managed hives

130
0:06:26.413,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in the United States now compared to 1945.

131
0:06:29.427,000 --> 0:06:32,000
We're down to about two million hives of bees, we think.

132
0:06:33.078,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And the reason is, after World War II,

133
0:06:35.824,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we changed our farming practices.

134
0:06:39.152,000 --> 0:06:41,000
We stopped planting cover crops.

135
0:06:41.991,000 --> 0:06:43,000
We stopped planting clover and alfalfa,

136
0:06:44.734,000 --> 0:06:47,000
which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil,

137
0:06:48.58,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers.

138
0:06:52.184,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Clover and alfalfa are highly nutritious food plants for bees.

139
0:06:57.728,000 --> 0:07:,000
And after World War II, we started using herbicides

140
0:07:01.182,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to kill off the weeds in our farms.

141
0:07:03.679,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Many of these weeds are flowering plants

142
0:07:06.46,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that bees require for their survival.

143
0:07:09.393,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And we started growing larger and larger crop monocultures.

144
0:07:14.964,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now we talk about food deserts,

145
0:07:17.529,000 --> 0:07:21,000
places in our cities, neighborhoods that have no grocery stores.

146
0:07:21.779,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The very farms that used to sustain bees

147
0:07:25.822,000 --> 0:07:27,000
are now agricultural food deserts,

148
0:07:28.578,000 --> 0:07:3,000
dominated by one or two plant species

149
0:07:31.001,000 --> 0:07:33,000
like corn and soybeans.

150
0:07:33.59,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Since World War II, we have been systematically

151
0:07:36.495,000 --> 0:07:38,000
eliminating many of the flowering plants

152
0:07:39.394,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that bees need for their survival.

153
0:07:42.946,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And these monocultures extend even to crops

154
0:07:45.844,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that are good for bees, like almonds.

155
0:07:48.391,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Fifty years ago, beekeepers would take a few colonies,

156
0:07:52.377,000 --> 0:07:55,000
hives of bees into the almond orchards, for pollination,

157
0:07:55.388,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and also because the pollen in an almond blossom

158
0:07:59.32,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is really high in protein. It's really good for bees.

159
0:08:03.5,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Now, the scale of almond monoculture

160
0:08:07.497,000 --> 0:08:09,000
demands that most of our nation's bees,

161
0:08:10.049,000 --> 0:08:12,000
over 1.5 million hives of bees,

162
0:08:12.785,000 --> 0:08:14,000
be transported across the nation

163
0:08:15.777,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to pollinate this one crop.

164
0:08:18.128,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And they're trucked in in semi-loads,

165
0:08:20.773,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and they must be trucked out,

166
0:08:23.103,000 --> 0:08:25,000
because after bloom, the almond orchards

167
0:08:25.842,000 --> 0:08:3,000
are a vast and flowerless landscape.

168
0:08:31.052,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Bees have been dying over the last 50 years,

169
0:08:33.518,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and we're planting more crops that need them.

170
0:08:37.323,000 --> 0:08:41,000
There has been a 300 percent increase in crop production

171
0:08:41.507,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that requires bee pollination.

172
0:08:45.311,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And then there's pesticides.

173
0:08:48.337,000 --> 0:08:51,000
After World War II, we started using pesticides

174
0:08:51.681,000 --> 0:08:53,000
on a large scale, and this became necessary

175
0:08:54.245,000 --> 0:08:57,000
because of the monocultures that put out a feast

176
0:08:58.039,000 --> 0:09:,000
for crop pests.

177
0:09:00.332,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Recently, researchers from Penn State University

178
0:09:03.273,000 --> 0:09:06,000
have started looking at the pesticide residue

179
0:09:06.57,000 --> 0:09:09,000
in the loads of pollen that bees carry home as food,

180
0:09:10.12,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and they've found that every batch of pollen

181
0:09:13.711,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that a honeybee collects

182
0:09:15.718,000 --> 0:09:18,000
has at least six detectable pesticides in it,

183
0:09:19.505,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and this includes every class of insecticides,

184
0:09:23.548,000 --> 0:09:25,000
herbicides, fungicides,

185
0:09:26.391,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and even inert and unlabeled ingredients

186
0:09:29.971,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that are part of the pesticide formulation

187
0:09:32.543,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that can be more toxic than the active ingredient.

188
0:09:36.765,000 --> 0:09:41,000
This small bee is holding up a large mirror.

189
0:09:42.407,000 --> 0:09:46,000
How much is it going to take to contaminate humans?

190
0:09:46.855,000 --> 0:09:48,000
One of these class of insecticides,

191
0:09:49.835,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the neonicontinoids,

192
0:09:51.21,000 --> 0:09:53,000
is making headlines around the world right now.

193
0:09:53.47,000 --> 0:09:54,000
You've probably heard about it.

194
0:09:54.916,000 --> 0:09:56,000
This is a new class of insecticides.

195
0:09:56.974,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It moves through the plant so that a crop pest,

196
0:10:00.133,000 --> 0:10:01,000
a leaf-eating insect,

197
0:10:01.576,000 --> 0:10:02,000
would take a bite of the plant

198
0:10:02.81,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and get a lethal dose and die.

199
0:10:06.15,000 --> 0:10:08,000
If one of these neonics, we call them,

200
0:10:08.973,000 --> 0:10:1,000
is applied in a high concentration,

201
0:10:11.427,000 --> 0:10:13,000
such as in this ground application,

202
0:10:13.689,000 --> 0:10:15,000
enough of the compound moves through the plant

203
0:10:16.157,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and gets into the pollen and the nectar,

204
0:10:18.369,000 --> 0:10:2,000
where a bee can consume, in this case,

205
0:10:20.473,000 --> 0:10:23,000
a high dose of this neurotoxin

206
0:10:23.491,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that makes the bee twitch and die.

207
0:10:27.64,000 --> 0:10:3,000
In most agricultural settings, on most of our farms,

208
0:10:30.813,000 --> 0:10:33,000
it's only the seed that's coated with the insecticide,

209
0:10:34.756,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and so a smaller concentration moves through the plant

210
0:10:37.747,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and gets into the pollen and nectar,

211
0:10:39.715,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and if a bee consumes this lower dose,

212
0:10:42.258,000 --> 0:10:43,000
either nothing happens

213
0:10:43.6,000 --> 0:10:46,000
or the bee becomes intoxicated and disoriented

214
0:10:47.188,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and she may not find her way home.

215
0:10:50.9,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And on top of everything else, bees have

216
0:10:53.032,000 --> 0:10:55,000
their own set of diseases and parasites.

217
0:10:55.3,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Public enemy number one for bees is this thing.

218
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
It's called varroa destructor.

219
0:11:00.465,000 --> 0:11:01,000
It's aptly named.

220
0:11:01.569,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It's this big, blood-sucking parasite

221
0:11:04.181,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that compromises the bee's immune system

222
0:11:06.555,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and circulates viruses.

223
0:11:09.326,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Let me put this all together for you.

224
0:11:12.255,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I don't know what it feels like to a bee

225
0:11:14.922,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to have a big, bloodsucking parasite running around on it,

226
0:11:17.623,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and I don't know what it feels like to a bee to have a virus,

227
0:11:20.762,000 --> 0:11:25,000
but I do know what it feels like when I have a virus, the flu,

228
0:11:25.89,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and I know how difficult it is for me to get

229
0:11:29.122,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to the grocery store to get good nutrition.

230
0:11:31.911,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But what if I lived in a food desert?

231
0:11:34.957,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And what if I had to travel a long distance

232
0:11:37.452,000 --> 0:11:38,000
to get to the grocery store,

233
0:11:39.325,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and I finally got my weak body out there

234
0:11:42.199,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and I consumed, in my food,

235
0:11:44.343,000 --> 0:11:46,000
enough of a pesticide, a neurotoxin,

236
0:11:47.144,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that I couldn't find my way home?

237
0:11:49.9,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And this is what we mean by multiple

238
0:11:53.087,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and interacting causes of death.

239
0:11:56.79,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And it's not just our honeybees.

240
0:11:58.979,000 --> 0:12:,000
All of our beautiful wild species of bees

241
0:12:01.854,000 --> 0:12:05,000
are at risk, including those tomato-pollinating bumblebees.

242
0:12:06.025,000 --> 0:12:09,000
These bees are providing backup for our honeybees.

243
0:12:09.576,000 --> 0:12:11,000
They're providing the pollination insurance

244
0:12:11.626,000 --> 0:12:12,000
alongside our honeybees.

245
0:12:13.244,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We need all of our bees.

246
0:12:15.667,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So what are we going to do?

247
0:12:18.208,000 --> 0:12:2,000
What are we going to do about this big bee bummer

248
0:12:20.622,000 --> 0:12:22,000
that we've created?

249
0:12:22.885,000 --> 0:12:25,000
It turns out, it's hopeful. It's hopeful.

250
0:12:26.702,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Every one of you out there can help bees

251
0:12:30.285,000 --> 0:12:34,000
in two very direct and easy ways.

252
0:12:34.75,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Plant bee-friendly flowers,

253
0:12:37.705,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and don't contaminate these flowers,

254
0:12:39.838,000 --> 0:12:41,000
this bee food, with pesticides.

255
0:12:42.5,000 --> 0:12:45,000
So go online and search for flowers

256
0:12:45.834,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that are native to your area and plant them.

257
0:12:49.246,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Plant them in a pot on your doorstep.

258
0:12:51.369,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Plant them in your front yard, in your lawns,

259
0:12:53.943,000 --> 0:12:54,000
in your boulevards.

260
0:12:55.473,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Campaign to have them planted in public gardens,

261
0:12:59.086,000 --> 0:13:01,000
community spaces, meadows.

262
0:13:01.667,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Set aside farmland.

263
0:13:03.416,000 --> 0:13:05,000
We need a beautiful diversity of flowers

264
0:13:06.116,000 --> 0:13:08,000
that blooms over the entire growing season,

265
0:13:08.287,000 --> 0:13:09,000
from spring to fall.

266
0:13:10.181,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We need roadsides seeded in flowers for our bees,

267
0:13:13.879,000 --> 0:13:16,000
but also for migrating butterflies and birds

268
0:13:17.333,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and other wildlife.

269
0:13:19.309,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And we need to think carefully about putting back in

270
0:13:22.749,000 --> 0:13:25,000
cover crops to nourish our soil

271
0:13:25.934,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and nourish our bees.

272
0:13:28.955,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And we need to diversify our farms.

273
0:13:32.218,000 --> 0:13:35,000
We need to plant flowering crop borders and hedge rows

274
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:39,000
to disrupt the agricultural food desert

275
0:13:39.856,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and begin to correct the dysfunctional food system

276
0:13:43.146,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that we've created.

277
0:13:45.377,000 --> 0:13:48,000
So maybe it seems like a really small countermeasure

278
0:13:48.761,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to a big, huge problem -- just go plant flowers --

279
0:13:51.779,000 --> 0:13:54,000
but when bees have access to good nutrition,

280
0:13:54.807,000 --> 0:13:56,000
we have access to good nutrition

281
0:13:56.993,000 --> 0:13:58,000
through their pollination services.

282
0:13:59.408,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And when bees have access to good nutrition,

283
0:14:01.944,000 --> 0:14:04,000
they're better able to engage their own natural defenses,

284
0:14:05.543,000 --> 0:14:06,000
their healthcare,

285
0:14:06.961,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that they have relied on for millions of years.

286
0:14:11.059,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So the beauty of helping bees this way, for me,

287
0:14:15.908,000 --> 0:14:19,000
is that every one of us needs to behave

288
0:14:20.358,000 --> 0:14:24,000
a little bit more like a bee society, an insect society,

289
0:14:25.138,000 --> 0:14:28,000
where each of our individual actions

290
0:14:28.17,000 --> 0:14:31,000
can contribute to a grand solution,

291
0:14:31.276,000 --> 0:14:32,000
an emergent property,

292
0:14:32.963,000 --> 0:14:33,000
that's much greater than the mere sum

293
0:14:34.944,000 --> 0:14:36,000
of our individual actions.

294
0:14:37.689,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So let the small act of planting flowers

295
0:14:42.839,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and keeping them free of pesticides

296
0:14:46.166,000 --> 0:14:5,000
be the driver of large-scale change.

297
0:14:50.381,000 --> 0:14:53,000
On behalf of the bees, thank you.

298
0:14:53.417,000 --> 0:14:57,000
(Applause)

299
0:14:57.54,000 --> 0:15:,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you. Just a quick question.

300
0:15:01.508,000 --> 0:15:04,000
The latest numbers on the die-off of bees,

301
0:15:04.664,000 --> 0:15:06,000
is there any sign of things bottoming out?

302
0:15:06.892,000 --> 0:15:08,000
What's your hope/depression level on this?

303
0:15:09.671,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Maria Spivak: Yeah.

304
0:15:10.285,000 --> 0:15:11,000
At least in the United States,

305
0:15:12.238,000 --> 0:15:14,000
an average of 30 percent of all bee hives

306
0:15:14.59,000 --> 0:15:16,000
are lost every winter.

307
0:15:16.717,000 --> 0:15:17,000
About 20 years ago,

308
0:15:18.522,000 --> 0:15:2,000
we were at a 15-percent loss.

309
0:15:20.858,000 --> 0:15:22,000
So it's getting precarious.

310
0:15:22.979,000 --> 0:15:24,000
CA: That's not 30 percent a year, that's -- MS: Yes, thirty percent a year.

311
0:15:25.586,000 --> 0:15:28,000
CA: Thirty percent a year. MS: But then beekeepers are able to divide their colonies

312
0:15:29.14,000 --> 0:15:31,000
and so they can maintain the same number,

313
0:15:31.79,000 --> 0:15:33,000
they can recuperate some of their loss.

314
0:15:34.111,000 --> 0:15:35,000
We're kind of at a tipping point.

315
0:15:35.729,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We can't really afford to lose that many more.

316
0:15:38.598,000 --> 0:15:39,000
We need to be really appreciative

317
0:15:40.418,000 --> 0:15:43,000

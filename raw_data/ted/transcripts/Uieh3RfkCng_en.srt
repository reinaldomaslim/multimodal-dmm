1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
When I saw a piece of technology called Kinect --

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
it was called Natal -- I was inspired,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I thought for a moment,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
maybe it's possible

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to address that one problem of storytelling,

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to create a character

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
which seemed alive,

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
which noticed me,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that could look me in the eyes

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and feel real,

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and sculpt a story about our relationship.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And so a year ago,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I showed this off

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
at a computer show called E3.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And this was a piece of technology

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
with someone called Claire interacting with this boy.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And there was a huge row online

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
about, "Hey, this can't be real."

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And so I waited till now

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
to have an actual demo

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
of the real tech.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Now, this tech incorporates

23
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
three big elements.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The first is a Kinect camera,

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
which will be out in November,

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
some incredible AI

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that was hidden in the dusty vaults,

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
collecting dust

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in Microsoft,

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
plus our quite crude

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
attempts at AI

32
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
at a company called Lionhead,

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
mixing all those things together

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
just to get to this one simple idea:

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to create a real, living

36
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
being in a computer.

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Now, I'll be honest with you

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and say that most of it

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is just a trick,

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but it's a trick that actually works.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
So why don't we go over and have

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
a look at the demo now.

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This is Dimitri.

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Dimitri, just waggle your arm around.

45
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Now, you notice he's sitting.

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
There are no controllers,

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
no keyboards,

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or mice,

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
or joysticks, or joypads.

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
He is just going to use

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
his hand, his body and his voice,

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
just like humans interact with their hands, body and voice.

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So let's move forward.

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
You're going to meet Milo for the first time.

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We had to give him a problem

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
because when we first created Milo,

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
we realized that he came across as a little bit of a brat,

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to be honest with you.

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
He was quite a know-it-all,

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and he wanted to kind of make you laugh.

61
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So the problem we introduced to him was this:

62
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
he's just moved house.

63
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
He's moved from London

64
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to New England, over in America.

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
His parents are too busy

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to listen to his problems,

67
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and that's when he starts almost conjuring you up.

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So here he is

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
walking through the grass.

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And you're able to interact with his world.

71
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The cool thing is, what we're doing

72
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
is we're changing the mind

73
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
of Milo constantly.

74
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
That means no two people's Milos

75
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
can be the same.

76
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
You're actually sculpting a human being here.

77
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So, he's discovering the garden.

78
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
You're helping him discover the garden

79
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
by just pointing out these snails.

80
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Very simple at the start.

81
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
By the way, if you are a boy, it's snails;

82
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
if you're a girl, it's butterflies

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
because what we found was that girls hate snails.

84
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
(Laughter)

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So remember, this is the first time you've met him,

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and we really want to draw you in and make you more curious.

87
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
His face, by the way,

88
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is fully AI-driven.

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We have complete control over his blush responses,

90
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
the diameter of his nostrils

91
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to denote stress.

92
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
We actually do something called body matching.

93
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
If you're leaning forward,

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
he will try and slightly change

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the neuro-linguistic nature of his face,

96
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because we went out with this strong idea:

97
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
how can we make you believe that something's real?

98
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Now we've used the hand.

99
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The other thing to use is your body.

100
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Why not just, instead of pushing left and right

101
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
with a mouse or with a joypad,

102
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
why not use your body just to lean on the chair --

103
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
again, relaxed?

104
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
You can lean back,

105
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but the camera will change its perspective

106
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
depending on which way you're looking.

107
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So Dimitri's now going to use --

108
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
he's used his hand; he's used his body.

109
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
He's now going to use the other thing which is essential,

110
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and that's his voice.

111
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Now, the thing about voice is,

112
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
our experience with voice recognition

113
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
is pretty awful, isn't it?

114
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It never works.

115
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
You order an airline ticket; you end up in Timbuktu.

116
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So we've tackled that problem,

117
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
and we've come up with a solution, which we'll see in a second.

118
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Milo: I could just squish it.

119
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Peter Molyneux: What are you going to do, Dimitri?

120
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Female Voice: Squashing a snail may not seem important,

121
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but remember, even this choice

122
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
will affect how Milo develops.

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Do you want Milo to squash it?

124
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
When you see the microphone,

125
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
say ... (PM: Squash.) ... yes to decide.

126
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Dimitri: Go on, Milo. Squash it.

127
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
PM: No. That's the wrong thing to do.

128
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Now look at his response.

129
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
He said, "Go on, Milo. Squash it."

130
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
What we're using there is,

131
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
we're using something, a piece of technology called Tellme.

132
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It's a company that Microsoft acquired some years ago.

133
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
We've got a database of words which we recognize.

134
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We pick those words out.

135
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
We also reference that

136
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
with the tonation database

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
that we build up of Dimitri's voice,

138
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
or the user's voice.

139
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Now we need to have a bit more engagement,

140
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and again, what we can do

141
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
is we can look at the body.

142
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And we'll do that in a second.

143
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Milo: I wonder how deep it is.

144
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Deep.

145
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
PM: Okay. So what we're going to do now

146
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
is teach Milo to skim stones.

147
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We're actually teaching him.

148
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's very, very interesting

149
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that men, more than women,

150
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
tend to be more competitive here.

151
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
They're fine with teaching Milo for the first few throws,

152
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but then they want to beat Milo,

153
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
where women,

154
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
they're more nurturing about this.

155
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Okay, this is skimming stones.

156
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
How do you skim stones?

157
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
You stand up,

158
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and you skim the stone.

159
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It's that simple.

160
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Just recognizing your body,

161
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
recognizing the body's motions, the tech,

162
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
understanding that you've gone

163
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
from sitting down to standing up.

164
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Again, all of this is done

165
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
in the way us humans do things,

166
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and that's crucially important

167
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
if we want Milo to appear real.

168
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Female Voice: See if you can inspire him to do any better.

169
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Try hitting the boat.

170
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Milo: Ahhh. So close.

171
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
PM: That's Dimitri at his most competitive.

172
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now beaten an 11-year-old child. Well done.

173
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Milo: Okay.

174
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
PM: So, Milo's being called back in by his parents,

175
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
giving us time to be alone

176
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and to help him out.

177
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Basically -- the bit that we missed at the start --

178
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
his parents had asked him to clean up his room.

179
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And we're going to help him with this now.

180
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But this is going to be an introduction,

181
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and this is all about the deep psychology that we're trying to use.

182
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We're trying to introduce you

183
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to what I believe is the most wonderful part,

184
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
you being able to talk

185
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
in your natural voice to Milo.

186
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now, to do that, we needed a set up,

187
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
like a magician's trick.

188
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And what we did was,

189
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
we needed to give Milo this big problem.

190
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So as Dimitri

191
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
starts tidying up,

192
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
you can overhear a conversation

193
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that Milo's having with his parents.

194
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Milo's Mom: Oh, you've got gravy all over the floor. (Milo: I didn't mean to!)

195
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Milo's Mom: That carpet is brand new.

196
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
PM: So he's just spilled

197
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
a plate of sausages on the floor,

198
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
on the brand-new carpet.

199
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We've all done it as parents; we've all done it as children.

200
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now's a chance for Dimitri

201
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to kind of reassure and calm Milo down.

202
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
It's all been too much for him.

203
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
He's just moved house. He's got no friends.

204
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now is the time

205
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
when we open that portal

206
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and allow you to talk to Milo.

207
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Female Voice: Why don't you try saying something encouraging

208
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to cheer Milo up.

209
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Dimitri: Come on, Milo. You know what parents are like.

210
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
They're always getting stressed.

211
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Milo: What do they want to come here for anyway?

212
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We don't know anyone.

213
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Dimitri: Well, you've got a new school to go to.

214
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
You're going to meet loads of cool, new friends.

215
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Milo: I just really miss my old house, that's all.

216
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Dimitri: Well, this is a pretty awesome house, Milo.

217
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
You've got a cool garden to play in and a pond.

218
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Milo: It was good skimming stones.

219
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
This looks nice.

220
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
You cleaned up my room.

221
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Thanks.

222
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
PM: So after three-quarters of an hour,

223
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
he recognizes you.

224
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And I promise you, if you're sitting in front of this screen,

225
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that is a truly wonderful moment.

226
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And we're ready now

227
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
to tell a story about his childhood and his life,

228
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and it goes on,

229
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and he has, you know, many adventures.

230
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Some of those adventures are a little bit dark or on the darker side.

231
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Some of those adventures are wonderfully encouraging --

232
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
he's got to go to school.

233
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
The cool thing is

234
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
that we're doing as well:

235
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
as you interact with him,

236
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
you're able to put things into his world; he recognizes objects.

237
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
His mind is based in a cloud.

238
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
That means Milo's mind,

239
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
as millions of people use it,

240
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
will get smarter and cleverer.

241
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
He'll recognize more objects

242
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and thus understand more words.

243
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
But for me,

244
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
this is a wonderful opportunity

245
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
where technology, at last, can be connected with,

246
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
where I am no longer restrained

247
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
by the finger I hold in my hand --

248
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
as far as a computer game's concerned --

249
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
or by the blandness of not being noticed

250
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
if you're watching a film or a book.

251
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And I love those revolutions,

252
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and I love the future that Milo brings.

253
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Thank you very much indeed.

254
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Every year in the United States alone,

2
0:00:18.73,000 --> 0:00:24,000
2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision

3
0:00:25.246,000 --> 0:00:28,000
to spend the rest of their lives together --

4
0:00:29.142,000 --> 0:00:3,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:30.316,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And not to have sex with anyone else.

6
0:00:34.76,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Ever.

7
0:00:36.4,000 --> 0:00:38,000
He buys a ring, she buys a dress.

8
0:00:40.059,000 --> 0:00:43,000
They go shopping for all sorts of things.

9
0:00:43.5,000 --> 0:00:47,000
She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom-dancing lessons.

10
0:00:48.948,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And the big day comes.

11
0:00:50.504,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And they'll stand before God and family

12
0:00:53.428,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and some guy her dad once did business with,

13
0:00:56.392,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and they'll vow that nothing --

14
0:00:59.001,000 --> 0:01:01,000
not abject poverty,

15
0:01:01.305,000 --> 0:01:03,000
not life-threatening illness,

16
0:01:03.453,000 --> 0:01:06,000
not complete and utter misery --

17
0:01:06.889,000 --> 0:01:11,000
will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion.

18
0:01:12.243,000 --> 0:01:13,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:14.015,000 --> 0:01:18,000
These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other

20
0:01:18.325,000 --> 0:01:21,000
through hot flashes and midlife crises

21
0:01:22.152,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and a cumulative 50-pound weight gain,

22
0:01:25.616,000 --> 0:01:31,000
until that far-off day, when one of them is finally able to rest in peace.

23
0:01:32.675,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:33.849,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You know, because they can't hear the snoring anymore.

25
0:01:36.787,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And then they'll get stupid drunk

26
0:01:38.615,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and smash cake in each other's faces and do the Macarena.

27
0:01:41.743,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And we'll be there,

28
0:01:43.37,000 --> 0:01:47,000
showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze

29
0:01:47.804,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and throwing birdseed at them every single time ...

30
0:01:51.978,000 --> 0:01:54,000
even though we know, statistically,

31
0:01:55.688,000 --> 0:01:58,000
half of them will be divorced within a decade.

32
0:01:58.807,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

33
0:02:01.386,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Of course, the other half won't, right?

34
0:02:04.093,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They'll keep forgetting anniversaries

35
0:02:07.092,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and arguing about where to spend holidays

36
0:02:09.604,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and debating --

37
0:02:10.791,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:11.883,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll.

39
0:02:16.047,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And some of them will even still be enjoying each other's company

40
0:02:21.561,000 --> 0:02:23,000
when neither of them can chew solid food anymore.

41
0:02:25.009,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And researchers want to know why.

42
0:02:27.929,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I mean, look -- it doesn't take a double-blind, placebo-controlled study

43
0:02:31.461,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to figure out what makes a marriage not work:

44
0:02:34.42,000 --> 0:02:36,000
disrespect, boredom,

45
0:02:37.663,000 --> 0:02:38,000
too much time on Facebook,

46
0:02:39.413,000 --> 0:02:41,000
having sex with other people.

47
0:02:41.453,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things --

48
0:02:44.987,000 --> 0:02:46,000
respect, excitement,

49
0:02:47.755,000 --> 0:02:49,000
a broken Internet connection,

50
0:02:49.95,000 --> 0:02:52,000
mind-numbing monogamy --

51
0:02:53.81,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and the thing still can go to hell in a handbasket.

52
0:02:56.983,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So, what's going on when it doesn't?

53
0:03:00.47,000 --> 0:03:04,000
What do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots

54
0:03:04.514,000 --> 0:03:05,000
have in common?

55
0:03:06.101,000 --> 0:03:07,000
What are they doing right?

56
0:03:07.835,000 --> 0:03:09,000
What can we learn from them?

57
0:03:10.759,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And if you're still happily sleeping solo,

58
0:03:14.542,000 --> 0:03:18,000
why should you stop what you're doing and make it your life's work

59
0:03:18.978,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to find that one special person

60
0:03:21.695,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that you can annoy for the rest of your life?

61
0:03:24.829,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Well, researchers spend billions of your tax dollars

62
0:03:28.073,000 --> 0:03:29,000
trying to figure that out.

63
0:03:29.933,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They stalk blissful couples

64
0:03:31.924,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and study their every move and mannerism.

65
0:03:35.15,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart

66
0:03:38.962,000 --> 0:03:4,000
from their miserable neighbors and friends.

67
0:03:41.229,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And it turns out, the success stories share a few similarities,

68
0:03:47.062,000 --> 0:03:49,000
beyond that they don't have sex with other people.

69
0:03:50.188,000 --> 0:03:53,000
For instance, in the happiest marriages,

70
0:03:53.237,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the wife is thinner and better-looking

71
0:03:55.099,000 --> 0:03:56,000
than the husband.

72
0:03:56.289,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:57.403,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Obvious. Right?

74
0:03:59.644,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It's obvious that this leads to marital bliss,

75
0:04:02.18,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because women -- we care a great deal about being thin and good-looking,

76
0:04:05.857,000 --> 0:04:07,000
whereas men mostly care about sex,

77
0:04:09.382,000 --> 0:04:12,000
ideally, with women who are thinner and better looking than they are.

78
0:04:13.501,000 --> 0:04:14,000
The beauty of this research, though,

79
0:04:15.272,000 --> 0:04:18,000
is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy.

80
0:04:19.549,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We just have to be thinner than our partners.

81
0:04:21.983,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising,

82
0:04:26.507,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we just need to wait for them to get fat --

83
0:04:28.738,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:30.034,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Maybe bake a few pies.

85
0:04:31.932,000 --> 0:04:34,000
This is good information to have, and it's not that complicated.

86
0:04:35.309,000 --> 0:04:36,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:36.359,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Research also suggests

88
0:04:38.495,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives.

89
0:04:43.71,000 --> 0:04:44,000
For example: the happy wife.

90
0:04:45.298,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Instead of pointing out her husband's growing gut

91
0:04:47.664,000 --> 0:04:49,000
or suggesting he go for a run,

92
0:04:50.249,000 --> 0:04:51,000
she might say,

93
0:04:51.618,000 --> 0:04:54,000
"Wow, honey, thank you for going out of your way

94
0:04:54.926,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to make me relatively thinner."

95
0:04:56.817,000 --> 0:04:57,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:57.845,000 --> 0:05:,000
These are couples who can find good in any situation.

97
0:05:01.054,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"Yeah, it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire.

98
0:05:06.306,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But it's kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars.

99
0:05:09.129,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And it's a good thing you've got all that body fat to keep us warm."

100
0:05:12.355,000 --> 0:05:13,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:13.582,000 --> 0:05:14,000
One of my favorite studies found

102
0:05:15.504,000 --> 0:05:18,000
that the more willing a husband is to do housework,

103
0:05:18.655,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the more attractive his wife will find him.

104
0:05:22.422,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Because we needed a study to tell us this.

105
0:05:24.683,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:25.979,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But here's what's going on here.

107
0:05:27.539,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The more attractive she finds him, the more sex they have;

108
0:05:30.703,000 --> 0:05:32,000
the more sex they have, the nicer he is to her;

109
0:05:33.149,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the nicer he is to her,

110
0:05:34.873,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed,

111
0:05:37.707,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and ultimately, they live happily ever after.

112
0:05:40.809,000 --> 0:05:43,000
In other words, men, you might want to pick it up a notch

113
0:05:44.219,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in the domestic department.

114
0:05:46.86,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Here's an interesting one.

115
0:05:48.625,000 --> 0:05:53,000
One study found that people who smile in childhood photographs

116
0:05:53.706,000 --> 0:05:54,000
are less likely to get a divorce.

117
0:05:56.844,000 --> 0:05:58,000
This is an actual study, and let me clarify:

118
0:05:59.709,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the researchers were not looking at documented self-reports

119
0:06:03.014,000 --> 0:06:04,000
of childhood happiness,

120
0:06:04.318,000 --> 0:06:06,000
or even studying old journals.

121
0:06:06.37,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The data were based entirely on whether people looked happy

122
0:06:10.965,000 --> 0:06:11,000
in these early pictures.

123
0:06:13.046,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Now, I don't know how old all of you are, but when I was a kid,

124
0:06:17.571,000 --> 0:06:19,000
your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera

125
0:06:20.309,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that held something called "film."

126
0:06:23.06,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And, by God, film was expensive.

127
0:06:26.764,000 --> 0:06:3,000
They didn't take 300 shots of you in that rapid-fire digital video mode

128
0:06:31.568,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and then pick out the nicest, smiliest one for the Christmas card.

129
0:06:36.187,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Oh, no.

130
0:06:38.394,000 --> 0:06:39,000
They dressed you up, they lined you up,

131
0:06:40.293,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to

132
0:06:43.114,000 --> 0:06:45,000
or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye.

133
0:06:45.323,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But still, I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures

134
0:06:48.891,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and I'm glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce.

135
0:06:53.615,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So, what else can you do to safeguard your marriage?

136
0:06:57.783,000 --> 0:07:,000
Do not win an Oscar for best actress.

137
0:07:01.054,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Laughter)

138
0:07:02.895,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I'm serious.

139
0:07:04.113,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Bettie Davis, Joan Crawford, Halle Berry, Hilary Swank,

140
0:07:07.179,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Sandra Bullock, Reese Witherspoon --

141
0:07:09.389,000 --> 0:07:12,000
all of them single, soon after taking home that statue.

142
0:07:12.945,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They actually call it the Oscar curse.

143
0:07:15.335,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided.

144
0:07:19.978,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And it's not just successfully starring in films that's dangerous.

145
0:07:24.024,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It turns out, merely watching a romantic comedy

146
0:07:27.955,000 --> 0:07:3,000
causes relationship satisfaction to plummet.

147
0:07:31.098,000 --> 0:07:32,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:32.572,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Apparently, the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us,

149
0:07:38.465,000 --> 0:07:4,000
but it obviously hasn't and it probably never will,

150
0:07:41.101,000 --> 0:07:44,000
makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison.

151
0:07:45.077,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And theoretically,

152
0:07:46.522,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered

153
0:07:49.811,000 --> 0:07:51,000
or dies in a fiery car crash,

154
0:07:52.233,000 --> 0:07:54,000
we are more likely to walk out of that theater

155
0:07:54.401,000 --> 0:07:55,000
feeling like we've got it pretty good.

156
0:07:56.363,000 --> 0:07:57,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:58.432,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Drinking alcohol, it seems, is bad for your marriage.

158
0:08:03.702,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Yeah.

159
0:08:05.616,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I can't tell you anymore about that one

160
0:08:07.508,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because I stopped reading it at the headline.

161
0:08:09.647,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But here's a scary one: divorce is contagious.

162
0:08:13.931,000 --> 0:08:15,000
That's right, when you have a close couple friend split up,

163
0:08:16.769,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent.

164
0:08:22.283,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Now, I have to say, I don't get this one at all.

165
0:08:25.473,000 --> 0:08:29,000
My husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets

166
0:08:30.157,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and then struggle with being our age and single

167
0:08:34.795,000 --> 0:08:38,000
in an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony.

168
0:08:39.622,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And I'm thinking they've done more for my marriage

169
0:08:42.044,000 --> 0:08:44,000
than a lifetime of therapy ever could.

170
0:08:45.054,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So now you may be wondering: Why does anyone get married ever?

171
0:08:50.738,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Well, the US federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits

172
0:08:55.913,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to being someone's spouse.

173
0:08:57.765,000 --> 0:08:59,000
A list that includes visitation rights in jail,

174
0:09:00.467,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but hopefully, you'll never need that one.

175
0:09:02.872,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But beyond the profound federal perks,

176
0:09:07.12,000 --> 0:09:08,000
married people make more money.

177
0:09:09.527,000 --> 0:09:12,000
We're healthier, physically and emotionally.

178
0:09:13.658,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We produce happier, more stable and more successful kids.

179
0:09:19.166,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends,

180
0:09:23.305,000 --> 0:09:24,000
believe it or not.

181
0:09:25.043,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We even live longer,

182
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot

183
0:09:31.439,000 --> 0:09:32,000
in the first place.

184
0:09:32.687,000 --> 0:09:33,000
(Laughter)

185
0:09:33.72,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Now, if you're not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return,

186
0:09:39.724,000 --> 0:09:42,000
I can't tell you how to find a chore-loving person

187
0:09:43.242,000 --> 0:09:45,000
of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness,

188
0:09:45.669,000 --> 0:09:46,000
who prefers horror movies

189
0:09:46.971,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and doesn't have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce,

190
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
but I can only encourage you to try,

191
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
because the benefits, as I've pointed out,

192
0:09:55.128,000 --> 0:09:56,000
are significant.

193
0:09:57.188,000 --> 0:10:,000
The bottom line is: whether you're in it or you're searching for it,

194
0:10:00.458,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting.

195
0:10:05.708,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So I hope you'll use the information I've given you today

196
0:10:08.417,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors.

197
0:10:11.955,000 --> 0:10:14,000
For instance, in my marriage, I'd say I'm doing OK.

198
0:10:16.589,000 --> 0:10:17,000
One the one hand,

199
0:10:18.01,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I have a husband who's annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome.

200
0:10:22.477,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So I'm obviously going to need fatten him up.

201
0:10:25.382,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And like I said, we have those divorced friends

202
0:10:28.133,000 --> 0:10:31,000
who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up.

203
0:10:31.986,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So we have to keep an eye on that.

204
0:10:35.461,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And we do like a cocktail or two.

205
0:10:38.108,000 --> 0:10:39,000
On the other hand,

206
0:10:39.521,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I have the fake happy picture thing.

207
0:10:41.788,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And also, my husband does a lot around the house,

208
0:10:45.427,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and would happily never see another romantic comedy

209
0:10:49.046,000 --> 0:10:5,000
as long as he lives.

210
0:10:50.316,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So I've got all those things going for me.

211
0:10:52.918,000 --> 0:10:53,000
But just in case,

212
0:10:54.162,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon.

213
0:10:59.896,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And for the good of your relationships,

214
0:11:01.988,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I would encourage you to do the same.

215
0:11:04.871,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I'll see you at the bar.

216
0:11:06.161,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Laughter)

217
0:11:07.356,000 --> 0:11:09,000
(Applause)

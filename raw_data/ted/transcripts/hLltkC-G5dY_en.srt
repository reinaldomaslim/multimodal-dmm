1
0:00:12.801,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Music)

2
0:00:16.72,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Roughly 43,000 years ago,

3
0:00:19.44,000 --> 0:00:21,000
a young cave bear died in the rolling hills

4
0:00:22.44,000 --> 0:00:25,000
on the northwest border of modern day Slovenia.

5
0:00:25.84,000 --> 0:00:29,000
A thousand years later, a mammoth died in southern Germany.

6
0:00:29.96,000 --> 0:00:32,000
A few centuries after that, a griffon vulture also died

7
0:00:33.28,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in the same vicinity.

8
0:00:35.28,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And we know almost nothing about how these animals met their deaths,

9
0:00:39.44,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but these different creatures dispersed across both time and space

10
0:00:43.52,000 --> 0:00:46,000
did share one remarkable fate.

11
0:00:46.72,000 --> 0:00:49,000
After their deaths, a bone from each of their skeletons

12
0:00:50.2,000 --> 0:00:52,000
was crafted by human hands

13
0:00:52.92,000 --> 0:00:53,000
into a flute.

14
0:00:54.92,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Think about that for a second.

15
0:00:56.4,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Imagine you're a caveman, 40,000 years ago.

16
0:00:59.08,000 --> 0:01:,000
You've mastered fire.

17
0:01:00.76,000 --> 0:01:02,000
You've built simple tools for hunting.

18
0:01:02.84,000 --> 0:01:04,000
You've learned how to craft garments from animal skins

19
0:01:05.48,000 --> 0:01:07,000
to keep yourself warm in the winter.

20
0:01:07.56,000 --> 0:01:09,000
What would you choose to invent next?

21
0:01:10.32,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It seems preposterous that you would invent the flute,

22
0:01:13.48,000 --> 0:01:16,000
a tool that created useless vibrations in air molecules.

23
0:01:17.319,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But that is exactly what our ancestors did.

24
0:01:21.2,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Now this turns out to be surprisingly common

25
0:01:24.64,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in the history of innovation.

26
0:01:26.28,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Sometimes people invent things

27
0:01:28.24,000 --> 0:01:3,000
because they want to stay alive or feed their children

28
0:01:31.2,000 --> 0:01:33,000
or conquer the village next door.

29
0:01:33.36,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But just as often,

30
0:01:34.8,000 --> 0:01:35,000
new ideas come into the world

31
0:01:36.72,000 --> 0:01:38,000
simply because they're fun.

32
0:01:39.52,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And here's the really strange thing:

33
0:01:41.96,000 --> 0:01:44,000
many of those playful but seemingly frivolous inventions

34
0:01:45.24,000 --> 0:01:47,000
ended up sparking momentous transformations

35
0:01:47.88,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in science, in politics and society.

36
0:01:51,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Take what may be the most important invention of modern times:

37
0:01:54.96,000 --> 0:01:55,000
programmable computers.

38
0:01:56.72,000 --> 0:02:,000
Now, the standard story is that computers descend from military technology,

39
0:02:01.36,000 --> 0:02:03,000
since many of the early computers were designed specifically

40
0:02:04.24,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to crack wartime codes or calculate rocket trajectories.

41
0:02:07.72,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But in fact, the origins of the modern computer

42
0:02:11.24,000 --> 0:02:12,000
are much more playful,

43
0:02:12.92,000 --> 0:02:13,000
even musical,

44
0:02:14.24,000 --> 0:02:15,000
than you might imagine.

45
0:02:15.52,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The idea behind the flute,

46
0:02:16.8,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of just pushing air through tubes to make a sound,

47
0:02:19.92,000 --> 0:02:21,000
was eventually modified to create the first organ

48
0:02:22.84,000 --> 0:02:23,000
more than 2,000 years ago.

49
0:02:24.6,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Someone came up with the brilliant idea of triggering sounds

50
0:02:27.92,000 --> 0:02:29,000
by pressing small levers with our fingers,

51
0:02:30.84,000 --> 0:02:32,000
inventing the first musical keyboard.

52
0:02:33.24,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now, keyboards evolved from organs to clavichords to harpsichords

53
0:02:37.4,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to the piano,

54
0:02:38.76,000 --> 0:02:4,000
until the middle of the 19th century,

55
0:02:41.44,000 --> 0:02:43,000
when a bunch of inventors finally hit on the idea

56
0:02:44.24,000 --> 0:02:47,000
of using a keyboard to trigger not sounds but letters.

57
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
In fact, the very first typewriter

58
0:02:50.48,000 --> 0:02:53,000
was originally called "the writing harpsichord."

59
0:02:55.44,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Flutes and music led to even more powerful breakthroughs.

60
0:02:59.28,000 --> 0:03:,000
About a thousand years ago,

61
0:03:01.04,000 --> 0:03:03,000
at the height of the Islamic Renaissance,

62
0:03:03.28,000 --> 0:03:05,000
three brothers in Baghdad designed a device

63
0:03:05.64,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that was an automated organ.

64
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
They called it "the instrument that plays itself."

65
0:03:11.96,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Now, the instrument was basically a giant music box.

66
0:03:15.12,000 --> 0:03:19,000
The organ could be trained to play various songs by using instructions

67
0:03:19.48,000 --> 0:03:22,000
encoded by placing pins on a rotating cylinder.

68
0:03:23.44,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And if you wanted the machine to play a different song,

69
0:03:26.08,000 --> 0:03:28,000
you just swapped a new cylinder in with a different code on it.

70
0:03:29.84,000 --> 0:03:32,000
This instrument was the first of its kind.

71
0:03:33.24,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It was programmable.

72
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, conceptually, this was a massive leap forward.

73
0:03:38.08,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The whole idea of hardware and software

74
0:03:41.52,000 --> 0:03:44,000
becomes thinkable for the first time with this invention.

75
0:03:44.76,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And that incredibly powerful concept

76
0:03:47.24,000 --> 0:03:5,000
didn't come to us as an instrument of war or of conquest,

77
0:03:50.44,000 --> 0:03:51,000
or necessity at all.

78
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It came from the strange delight of watching a machine play music.

79
0:03:57.32,000 --> 0:04:,000
In fact, the idea of programmable machines

80
0:04:00.56,000 --> 0:04:04,000
was exclusively kept alive by music for about 700 years.

81
0:04:05.24,000 --> 0:04:07,000
In the 1700s, music-making machines

82
0:04:07.76,000 --> 0:04:1,000
became the playthings of the Parisian elite.

83
0:04:11.36,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Showmen used the same coded cylinders

84
0:04:14.56,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to control the physical movements of what were called automata,

85
0:04:18.52,000 --> 0:04:2,000
an early kind of robot.

86
0:04:20.56,000 --> 0:04:21,000
One of the most famous of those robots

87
0:04:22.52,000 --> 0:04:25,000
was, you guessed it, an automated flute player

88
0:04:25.92,000 --> 0:04:26,000
designed by a brilliant French inventor

89
0:04:27.84,000 --> 0:04:28,000
named Jacques de Vaucanson.

90
0:04:30.279,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And as de Vaucanson was designing his robot musician,

91
0:04:33.8,000 --> 0:04:34,000
he had another idea.

92
0:04:35.76,000 --> 0:04:38,000
If you could program a machine to make pleasing sounds,

93
0:04:39.76,000 --> 0:04:43,000
why not program it to weave delightful patterns of color out of cloth?

94
0:04:44.92,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Instead of using the pins of the cylinder to represent musical notes,

95
0:04:49.2,000 --> 0:04:52,000
they would represent threads with different colors.

96
0:04:52.32,000 --> 0:04:54,000
If you wanted a new pattern for your fabric,

97
0:04:54.84,000 --> 0:04:55,000
you just programmed a new cylinder.

98
0:04:57.2,000 --> 0:04:59,000
This was the first programmable loom.

99
0:05:00.56,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now, the cylinders were too expensive and time-consuming to make,

100
0:05:04.76,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but a half century later,

101
0:05:06.32,000 --> 0:05:08,000
another French inventor named Jacquard

102
0:05:08.96,000 --> 0:05:12,000
hit upon the brilliant idea of using paper-punched cards

103
0:05:13.68,000 --> 0:05:14,000
instead of metal cylinders.

104
0:05:15.48,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Paper turned out to be much cheaper and more flexible

105
0:05:18.56,000 --> 0:05:2,000
as a way of programming the device.

106
0:05:20.72,000 --> 0:05:24,000
That punch card system inspired Victorian inventor Charles Babbage

107
0:05:25.2,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to create his analytical engine,

108
0:05:27.72,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the first true programmable computer

109
0:05:30.36,000 --> 0:05:31,000
ever designed.

110
0:05:31.72,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And punch cards were used by computer programmers

111
0:05:34.44,000 --> 0:05:36,000
as late as the 1970s.

112
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So ask yourself this question:

113
0:05:39.8,000 --> 0:05:42,000
what really made the modern computer possible?

114
0:05:43.32,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Yes, the military involvement is an important part of the story,

115
0:05:47.36,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but inventing a computer also required other building blocks:

116
0:05:51.12,000 --> 0:05:52,000
music boxes,

117
0:05:52.36,000 --> 0:05:54,000
toy robot flute players,

118
0:05:54.4,000 --> 0:05:55,000
harpsichord keyboards,

119
0:05:55.92,000 --> 0:05:57,000
colorful patterns woven into fabric,

120
0:05:58.52,000 --> 0:06:,000
and that's just a small part of the story.

121
0:06:01.36,000 --> 0:06:03,000
There's a long list of world-changing ideas and technologies

122
0:06:04.36,000 --> 0:06:05,000
that came out of play:

123
0:06:06.08,000 --> 0:06:07,000
public museums, rubber,

124
0:06:08.08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
probability theory, the insurance business

125
0:06:10.44,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and many more.

126
0:06:11.68,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Necessity isn't always the mother of invention.

127
0:06:15.08,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The playful state of mind is fundamentally exploratory,

128
0:06:19.28,000 --> 0:06:21,000
seeking out new possibilities in the world around us.

129
0:06:22.92,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And that seeking is why so many experiences

130
0:06:26.44,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that started with simple delight and amusement

131
0:06:29.48,000 --> 0:06:31,000
eventually led us to profound breakthroughs.

132
0:06:33.04,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, I think this has implications for how we teach kids in school

133
0:06:37.28,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and how we encourage innovation in our workspaces,

134
0:06:40.52,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but thinking about play and delight this way

135
0:06:43.6,000 --> 0:06:46,000
also helps us detect what's coming next.

136
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Think about it: if you were sitting there in 1750

137
0:06:49.56,000 --> 0:06:52,000
trying to figure out the big changes coming to society

138
0:06:53.12,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in the 19th, the 20th centuries,

139
0:06:55.04,000 --> 0:06:57,000
automated machines, computers,

140
0:06:57.12,000 --> 0:06:58,000
artificial intelligence,

141
0:06:59.08,000 --> 0:07:,000
a programmable flute

142
0:07:00.92,000 --> 0:07:02,000
entertaining the Parisian elite

143
0:07:03.12,000 --> 0:07:06,000
would have been as powerful a clue as anything else at the time.

144
0:07:07.84,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It seemed like an amusement at best,

145
0:07:10.4,000 --> 0:07:12,000
not useful in any serious way,

146
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but it turned out to be the beginning of a tech revolution

147
0:07:17.04,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that would change the world.

148
0:07:18.92,000 --> 0:07:19,000
You'll find the future

149
0:07:20.8,000 --> 0:07:22,000
wherever people are having the most fun.

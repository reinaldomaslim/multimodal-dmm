1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'd like to begin with a thought experiment.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Imagine that it's 4,000 years into the future.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Civilization as we know it

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
has ceased to exist --

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
no books,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
no electronic devices,

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
no Facebook or Twitter.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
All knowledge of the English language and the English alphabet

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
has been lost.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Now imagine archeologists

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
digging through the rubble of one of our cities.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
What might they find?

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Well perhaps some rectangular pieces of plastic

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
with strange symbols on them.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Perhaps some circular pieces of metal.

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Maybe some cylindrical containers

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
with some symbols on them.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And perhaps one archeologist becomes an instant celebrity

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
when she discovers --

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
buried in the hills somewhere in North America --

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
massive versions of these same symbols.

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now let's ask ourselves,

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
what could such artifacts say about us

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to people 4,000 years into the future?

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
This is no hypothetical question.

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
In fact, this is exactly the kind of question we're faced with

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
when we try to understand the Indus Valley civilization,

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
which existed 4,000 years ago.

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The Indus civilization was roughly contemporaneous

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
with the much better known Egyptian and the Mesopotamian civilizations,

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but it was actually much larger than either of these two civilizations.

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It occupied the area

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
of approximately one million square kilometers,

34
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
covering what is now Pakistan,

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Northwestern India

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and parts of Afghanistan and Iran.

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Given that it was such a vast civilization,

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
you might expect to find really powerful rulers, kings,

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and huge monuments glorifying these powerful kings.

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
In fact,

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
what archeologists have found is none of that.

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
They've found small objects such as these.

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Here's an example of one of these objects.

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Well obviously this is a replica.

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But who is this person?

46
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
A king? A god?

47
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
A priest?

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Or perhaps an ordinary person

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
like you or me?

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We don't know.

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But the Indus people also left behind artifacts with writing on them.

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Well no, not pieces of plastic,

53
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but stone seals, copper tablets,

54
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
pottery and, surprisingly,

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
one large sign board,

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
which was found buried near the gate of a city.

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Now we don't know if it says Hollywood,

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
or even Bollywood for that matter.

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
In fact, we don't even know

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
what any of these objects say,

61
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and that's because the Indus script is undeciphered.

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We don't know what any of these symbols mean.

63
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The symbols are most commonly found on seals.

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So you see up there one such object.

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It's the square object with the unicorn-like animal on it.

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Now that's a magnificent piece of art.

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
So how big do you think that is?

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Perhaps that big?

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Or maybe that big?

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Well let me show you.

71
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Here's a replica of one such seal.

72
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It's only about one inch by one inch in size --

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
pretty tiny.

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So what were these used for?

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We know that these were used for stamping clay tags

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that were attached to bundles of goods that were sent from one place to the other.

77
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So you know those packing slips you get on your FedEx boxes?

78
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
These were used to make those kinds of packing slips.

79
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
You might wonder what these objects contain

80
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
in terms of their text.

81
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Perhaps they're the name of the sender

82
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
or some information about the goods

83
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that are being sent from one place to the other -- we don't know.

84
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We need to decipher the script to answer that question.

85
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Deciphering the script

86
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
is not just an intellectual puzzle;

87
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
it's actually become a question

88
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that's become deeply intertwined

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
with the politics and the cultural history of South Asia.

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In fact, the script has become a battleground of sorts

91
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
between three different groups of people.

92
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
First, there's a group of people

93
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
who are very passionate in their belief

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that the Indus script

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
does not represent a language at all.

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
These people believe that the symbols

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
are very similar to the kind of symbols you find on traffic signs

98
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
or the emblems you find on shields.

99
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
There's a second group of people

100
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
who believe that the Indus script represents an Indo-European language.

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
If you look at a map of India today,

102
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
you'll see that most of the languages spoken in North India

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
belong to the Indo-European language family.

104
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So some people believe that the Indus script

105
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
represents an ancient Indo-European language such as Sanskrit.

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
There's a last group of people

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
who believe that the Indus people

108
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
were the ancestors of people living in South India today.

109
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
These people believe that the Indus script

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
represents an ancient form

111
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
of the Dravidian language family,

112
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
which is the language family spoken in much of South India today.

113
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And the proponents of this theory

114
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
point to that small pocket of Dravidian-speaking people in the North,

115
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
actually near Afghanistan,

116
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and they say that perhaps, sometime in the past,

117
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Dravidian languages were spoken all over India

118
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and that this suggests

119
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
that the Indus civilization is perhaps also Dravidian.

120
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Which of these hypotheses can be true?

121
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
We don't know, but perhaps if you deciphered the script,

122
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
you would be able to answer this question.

123
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But deciphering the script is a very challenging task.

124
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
First, there's no Rosetta Stone.

125
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I don't mean the software;

126
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I mean an ancient artifact

127
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that contains in the same text

128
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
both a known text and an unknown text.

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We don't have such an artifact for the Indus script.

130
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And furthermore, we don't even know what language they spoke.

131
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And to make matters even worse,

132
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
most of the text that we have are extremely short.

133
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So as I showed you, they're usually found on these seals

134
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that are very, very tiny.

135
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And so given these formidable obstacles,

136
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
one might wonder and worry

137
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
whether one will ever be able to decipher the Indus script.

138
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
In the rest of my talk,

139
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I'd like to tell you about how I learned to stop worrying

140
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and love the challenge posed by the Indus script.

141
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I've always been fascinated by the Indus script

142
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
ever since I read about it in a middle school textbook.

143
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And why was I fascinated?

144
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Well it's the last major undeciphered script in the ancient world.

145
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
My career path led me to become a computational neuroscientist,

146
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so in my day job,

147
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I create computer models of the brain

148
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
to try to understand how the brain makes predictions,

149
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
how the brain makes decisions,

150
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
how the brain learns and so on.

151
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But in 2007, my path crossed again with the Indus script.

152
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
That's when I was in India,

153
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and I had the wonderful opportunity

154
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to meet with some Indian scientists

155
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
who were using computer models to try to analyze the script.

156
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And so it was then that I realized

157
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
there was an opportunity for me to collaborate with these scientists,

158
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and so I jumped at that opportunity.

159
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And I'd like to describe some of the results that we have found.

160
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Or better yet, let's all collectively decipher.

161
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Are you ready?

162
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The first thing that you need to do when you have an undeciphered script

163
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
is try to figure out the direction of writing.

164
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Here are two texts that contain some symbols on them.

165
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Can you tell me

166
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
if the direction of writing is right to left or left to right?

167
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I'll give you a couple of seconds.

168
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Okay. Right to left, how many? Okay.

169
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Okay. Left to right?

170
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Oh, it's almost 50/50. Okay.

171
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
The answer is:

172
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
if you look at the left-hand side of the two texts,

173
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
you'll notice that there's a cramping of signs,

174
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and it seems like 4,000 years ago,

175
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
when the scribe was writing from right to left,

176
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
they ran out of space.

177
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And so they had to cram the sign.

178
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
One of the signs is also below the text on the top.

179
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
This suggests the direction of writing

180
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
was probably from right to left,

181
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and so that's one of the first things we know,

182
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that directionality is a very key aspect of linguistic scripts.

183
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And the Indus script now has

184
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
this particular property.

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
What other properties of language does the script show?

186
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Languages contain patterns.

187
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
If I give you the letter Q

188
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and ask you to predict the next letter, what do you think that would be?

189
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Most of you said U, which is right.

190
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now if I asked you to predict one more letter,

191
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
what do you think that would be?

192
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Now there's several thoughts. There's E. It could be I. It could be A,

193
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
but certainly not B, C or D, right?

194
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The Indus script also exhibits similar kinds of patterns.

195
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
There's a lot of text that start with this diamond-shaped symbol.

196
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And this in turn tends to be followed

197
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
by this quotation marks-like symbol.

198
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And this is very similar to a Q and U example.

199
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
This symbol can in turn be followed

200
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
by these fish-like symbols and some other signs,

201
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but never by these other signs at the bottom.

202
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And furthermore, there's some signs

203
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that really prefer the end of texts,

204
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
such as this jar-shaped sign,

205
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and this sign, in fact, happens to be

206
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the most frequently occurring sign in the script.

207
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Given such patterns, here was our idea.

208
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
The idea was to use a computer

209
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
to learn these patterns,

210
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and so we gave the computer the existing texts.

211
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And the computer learned a statistical model

212
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
of which symbols tend to occur together

213
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and which symbols tend to follow each other.

214
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Given the computer model,

215
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
we can test the model by essentially quizzing it.

216
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So we could deliberately erase some symbols,

217
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and we can ask it to predict the missing symbols.

218
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Here are some examples.

219
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
You may regard this

220
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
as perhaps the most ancient game

221
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
of Wheel of Fortune.

222
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
What we found

223
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
was that the computer was successful in 75 percent of the cases

224
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in predicting the correct symbol.

225
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
In the rest of the cases,

226
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
typically the second best guess or third best guess was the right answer.

227
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
There's also practical use

228
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
for this particular procedure.

229
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
There's a lot of these texts that are damaged.

230
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Here's an example of one such text.

231
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And we can use the computer model now to try to complete this text

232
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and make a best guess prediction.

233
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Here's an example of a symbol that was predicted.

234
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And this could be really useful as we try to decipher the script

235
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
by generating more data that we can analyze.

236
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Now here's one other thing you can do with the computer model.

237
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So imagine a monkey

238
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
sitting at a keyboard.

239
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I think you might get a random jumble of letters that looks like this.

240
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Such a random jumble of letters

241
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
is said to have a very high entropy.

242
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
This is a physics and information theory term.

243
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But just imagine it's a really random jumble of letters.

244
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
How many of you have ever spilled coffee on a keyboard?

245
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
You might have encountered the stuck-key problem --

246
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
so basically the same symbol being repeated over and over again.

247
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
This kind of a sequence is said to have a very low entropy

248
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
because there's no variation at all.

249
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Language, on the other hand, has an intermediate level of entropy;

250
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
it's neither too rigid,

251
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
nor is it too random.

252
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
What about the Indus script?

253
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Here's a graph that plots the entropies of a whole bunch of sequences.

254
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
At the very top you find the uniformly random sequence,

255
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
which is a random jumble of letters --

256
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and interestingly, we also find

257
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the DNA sequence from the human genome and instrumental music.

258
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And both of these are very, very flexible,

259
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
which is why you find them in the very high range.

260
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
At the lower end of the scale,

261
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
you find a rigid sequence, a sequence of all A's,

262
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and you also find a computer program,

263
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
in this case in the language Fortran,

264
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
which obeys really strict rules.

265
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Linguistic scripts

266
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
occupy the middle range.

267
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Now what about the Indus script?

268
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We found that the Indus script

269
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
actually falls within the range of the linguistic scripts.

270
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
When this result was first published,

271
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
it was highly controversial.

272
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
There were people who raised a hue and cry,

273
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and these people were the ones who believed

274
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that the Indus script does not represent language.

275
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
I even started to get some hate mail.

276
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
My students said

277
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that I should really seriously consider getting some protection.

278
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Who'd have thought

279
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that deciphering could be a dangerous profession?

280
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
What does this result really show?

281
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It shows that the Indus script

282
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
shares an important property of language.

283
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So, as the old saying goes,

284
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
if it looks like a linguistic script

285
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and it acts like a linguistic script,

286
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
then perhaps we may have a linguistic script on our hands.

287
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
What other evidence is there

288
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that the script could actually encode language?

289
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Well linguistic scripts can actually encode multiple languages.

290
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So for example, here's the same sentence written in English

291
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and the same sentence written in Dutch

292
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
using the same letters of the alphabet.

293
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
If you don't know Dutch and you only know English

294
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and I give you some words in Dutch,

295
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
you'll tell me that these words contain

296
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
some very unusual patterns.

297
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Some things are not right,

298
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and you'll say these words are probably not English words.

299
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The same thing happens in the case of the Indus script.

300
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The computer found several texts --

301
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
two of them are shown here --

302
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that have very unusual patterns.

303
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So for example the first text:

304
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
there's a doubling of this jar-shaped sign.

305
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
This sign is the most frequently-occurring sign

306
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
in the Indus script,

307
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and it's only in this text

308
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that it occurs as a doubling pair.

309
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Why is that the case?

310
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We went back and looked at where these particular texts were found,

311
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and it turns out that they were found

312
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
very, very far away from the Indus Valley.

313
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
They were found in present day Iraq and Iran.

314
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And why were they found there?

315
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
What I haven't told you is that

316
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the Indus people were very, very enterprising.

317
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
They used to trade with people pretty far away from where they lived,

318
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and so in this case, they were traveling by sea

319
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
all the way to Mesopotamia, present-day Iraq.

320
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And what seems to have happened here

321
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
is that the Indus traders, the merchants,

322
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
were using this script to write a foreign language.

323
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
It's just like our English and Dutch example.

324
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And that would explain why we have these strange patterns

325
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that are very different from the kinds of patterns you see in the text

326
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that are found within the Indus Valley.

327
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
This suggests that the same script, the Indus script,

328
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
could be used to write different languages.

329
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
The results we have so far seem to point to the conclusion

330
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that the Indus script probably does represent language.

331
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
If it does represent language,

332
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
then how do we read the symbols?

333
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
That's our next big challenge.

334
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
So you'll notice that many of the symbols

335
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
look like pictures of humans, of insects,

336
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
of fishes, of birds.

337
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Most ancient scripts

338
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
use the rebus principle,

339
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
which is, using pictures to represent words.

340
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
So as an example, here's a word.

341
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Can you write it using pictures?

342
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I'll give you a couple seconds.

343
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Got it?

344
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Okay. Great.

345
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Here's my solution.

346
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
You could use the picture of a bee followed by a picture of a leaf --

347
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
and that's "belief," right.

348
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
There could be other solutions.

349
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
In the case of the Indus script,

350
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
the problem is the reverse.

351
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
You have to figure out the sounds of each of these pictures

352
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
such that the entire sequence makes sense.

353
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So this is just like a crossword puzzle,

354
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
except that this is the mother of all crossword puzzles

355
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
because the stakes are so high if you solve it.

356
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
My colleagues, Iravatham Mahadevan and Asko Parpola,

357
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
have been making some headway on this particular problem.

358
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And I'd like to give you a quick example of Parpola's work.

359
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Here's a really short text.

360
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
It contains seven vertical strokes followed by this fish-like sign.

361
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And I want to mention that these seals were used

362
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
for stamping clay tags

363
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
that were attached to bundles of goods,

364
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
so it's quite likely that these tags, at least some of them,

365
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
contain names of merchants.

366
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And it turns out that in India

367
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
there's a long tradition

368
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
of names being based on horoscopes

369
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and star constellations present at the time of birth.

370
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
In Dravidian languages,

371
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
the word for fish is "meen"

372
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
which happens to sound just like the word for star.

373
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
And so seven stars

374
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
would stand for "elu meen,"

375
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
which is the Dravidian word

376
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
for the Big Dipper star constellation.

377
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Similarly, there's another sequence of six stars,

378
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and that translates to "aru meen,"

379
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
which is the old Dravidian name

380
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
for the star constellation Pleiades.

381
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And finally, there's other combinations,

382
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
such as this fish sign with something that looks like a roof on top of it.

383
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And that could be translated into "mey meen,"

384
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
which is the old Dravidian name for the planet Saturn.

385
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
So that was pretty exciting.

386
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
It looks like we're getting somewhere.

387
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
But does this prove

388
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
that these seals contain Dravidian names

389
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
based on planets and star constellations?

390
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Well not yet.

391
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
So we have no way of validating

392
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
these particular readings,

393
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
but if more and more of these readings start making sense,

394
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and if longer and longer sequences

395
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
appear to be correct,

396
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
then we know that we are on the right track.

397
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Today,

398
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
we can write a word such as TED

399
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
in Egyptian hieroglyphics and in cuneiform script,

400
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
because both of these were deciphered

401
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
in the 19th century.

402
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
The decipherment of these two scripts

403
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
enabled these civilizations to speak to us again directly.

404
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
The Mayans

405
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
started speaking to us in the 20th century,

406
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
but the Indus civilization remains silent.

407
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Why should we care?

408
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
The Indus civilization does not belong

409
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
to just the South Indians or the North Indians

410
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
or the Pakistanis;

411
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
it belongs to all of us.

412
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
These are our ancestors --

413
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
yours and mine.

414
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
They were silenced

415
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
by an unfortunate accident of history.

416
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
If we decipher the script,

417
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
we would enable them to speak to us again.

418
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
What would they tell us?

419
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
What would we find out about them? About us?

420
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
I can't wait to find out.

421
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Thank you.

422
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
(Applause)

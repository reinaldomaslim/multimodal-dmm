1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I want to talk about the election.

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
For the first time in the United States, a predominantly white group of voters

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
voted for an African-American candidate for President.

4
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
He won 375 electoral votes.

6
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And he won about 70 million popular votes

7
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
more than any other presidential candidate --

8
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
of any race, of any party -- in history.

9
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
If you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier --

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Democrats really like seeing this transition here,

11
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
where almost every state becomes bluer, becomes more democratic --

12
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
even states Obama lost, like out west,

13
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
those states became more blue.

14
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In the south, in the northeast, almost everywhere

15
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
but with a couple of exceptions here and there.

16
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
One exception is in Massachusetts.

17
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
That was John Kerry's home state.

18
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
No big surprise, Obama couldn't do better than Kerry there.

19
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Or in Arizona, which is John McCain's home,

20
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Obama didn't have much improvement.

21
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But there is also this part of the country, kind of in the middle region here.

22
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This kind of Arkansas, Tennessee, Oklahoma, West Virginia region.

23
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Now if you look at '96, Bill Clinton --

24
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the last Democrat to actually win -- how he did in '96,

25
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
you see real big differences in this part of the country right here,

26
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the kind of Appalachians, Ozarks, highlands region, as I call it:

27
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
20 or 30 point swings

28
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
from how Bill Clinton did in '96 to how Obama did

29
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
in 2008.

30
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas, but these are very, very profound differences.

31
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So, when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas, you know.

32
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
There is a book written called, "What's the Matter with Kansas?"

33
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas.

34
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
He lost badly but every Democrat does.

35
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
He lost no worse than most people do.

36
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But yeah, what's the matter with Arkansas?

37
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations.

39
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We think of a bunch of rednecks, quote, unquote, with guns.

40
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And we think people like this probably don't want to vote

41
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama.

42
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We think it's a matter of race. And is this fair?

43
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas, and this part of the country?

44
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And the answer is: it is at least partially fair.

45
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We know that race was a factor, and the reason why we know that

46
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
is because we asked those people.

47
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Actually we didn't ask them, but when they conducted

48
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
exit polls in every state,

49
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in 37 states, out of the 50,

50
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
they asked a question, that was pretty direct, about race.

51
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They asked this question.

52
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
In deciding your vote for President today, was the race

53
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
of the candidate a factor?

54
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We're looking for people that said, "Yes, race was a factor;

55
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
moreover it was an important factor, in my decision,"

56
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and people who voted for John McCain

57
0:02:44.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
as a result of that factor,

58
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
maybe in combination with other factors, and maybe alone.

59
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We're looking for this behavior among white voters

60
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
or, really, non-black voters.

61
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So you see big differences in different parts

62
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of the country on this question.

63
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
In Louisiana, about one in five white voters

64
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
said, "Yes, one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama

65
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
is because he was an African-American."

66
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
If those people had voted for Obama,

67
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:12,000
even half of them, Obama would have won Louisiana safely.

68
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Same is true with, I think, all of these states you see on the top of the list.

69
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Meanwhile, California, New York, we can say, "Oh we're enlightened"

70
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but you know, certainly a much lower incidence of this

71
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
admitted, I suppose,

72
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
manifestation of racially-based voting.

73
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Here is the same data on a map.

74
0:03:27.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
You kind of see the relationship between

75
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
the redder states of where more people responded and said,

76
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
"Yes, Barack Obama's race was a problem for me."

77
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
You see, comparing the map to '96, you see an overlap here.

78
0:03:37.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
This really seems to explain

79
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
why Barack Obama did worse

80
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in this one part of the country.

81
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So we have to ask why.

82
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Is racism predictable in some way?

83
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Is there something driving this?

84
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas

85
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that we don't understand, and Kentucky?

86
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Or are there more systematic factors at work?

87
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables.

88
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:,000
These are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time --

89
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
things like income, and religion, education.

90
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Which of these seem to drive

91
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
this manifestation of racism

92
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
in this big national experiment we had on November 4th?

93
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And there are a couple of these that have

94
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
strong predictive relationships,

95
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
one of which is education,

96
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling

97
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
per adult are in red,

98
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and you see this part of the country, the kind of Appalachians region,

99
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
is less educated. It's just a fact.

100
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And you see the relationship there

101
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
with the racially-based voting patterns.

102
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The other variable that's important is

103
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the type of neighborhood that you live in.

104
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
States that are more rural --

105
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
even to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine --

106
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
they exhibit a little bit of

107
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
this racially-based voting against Barack Obama.

108
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So it's the combination of these two things: it's education

109
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and the type of neighbors that you have,

110
0:04:49.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
which we'll talk about more in a moment.

111
0:04:51.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee

112
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
is that they're both very rural,

113
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and they are educationally impoverished.

114
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So yes, racism is predictable.

115
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:03,000
These things, among maybe other variables,

116
0:05:03.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but these things seem to predict it.

117
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We're going to drill down a little bit more now,

118
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
into something called the General Social Survey.

119
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
This is conducted by the University of Chicago

120
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
every other year.

121
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And they ask a series of really interesting questions.

122
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
In 2000 they had particularly interesting questions

123
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
about racial attitudes.

124
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
One simple question they asked is,

125
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
"Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood?"

126
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different.

127
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
In cites, about 80 percent of people

128
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race,

129
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but in rural communities, only about 30 percent.

130
0:05:37.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Probably because if you live on a farm, you might not have a lot of neighbors, period.

131
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
But nevertheless, you're not having a lot of interaction with people

132
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
who are unlike you.

133
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So what we're going to do now is take the white people in the survey

134
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and split them between those who have black neighbors --

135
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
or, really, some neighbor of another race --

136
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and people who have only white neighbors.

137
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we see in some variables

138
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
in terms of political attitudes, not a lot of difference.

139
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This was eight years ago, some people were more Republican back then.

140
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But you see Democrats versus Republican,

141
0:06:05.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
not a big difference based on who your neighbors are.

142
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And even some questions about race -- for example

143
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:12,000
affirmative action, which is kind of a political question,

144
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
a policy question about race, if you will --

145
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
not much difference here.

146
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Affirmative action is not very popular frankly, with white voters, period.

147
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But people with black neighbors and people with mono-racial neighborhoods

148
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
feel no differently about it really.

149
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will,

150
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage?"

151
0:06:31.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
There is a big difference.

152
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
People who don't have neighbors of a different race

153
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
are about twice as likely

154
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to oppose interracial marriage as people who do.

155
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you.

156
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And likewise they asked, not in 2000, but in the same survey in 1996,

157
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:51,000
"Would you not vote for a qualified black president?"

158
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
You see people without neighbors who are African-American who

159
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
were much more likely to say, "That would give me a problem."

160
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So it's really not even about urban versus rural.

161
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
It's about who you live with.

162
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Racism is predictable. And it's predicted by

163
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you, people of other races.

164
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So if you want to address it,

165
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races.

166
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I have a couple of very obvious, I suppose,

167
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
ideas for maybe how to do that.

168
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
I'm a big fan of cities.

169
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable,

170
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups.

171
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking,

172
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis.

173
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But also not everyone wants to live in a city, certainly not a city like New York.

174
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So we can think more about things like street grids.

175
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
This is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing, Michigan.

176
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's a traditional Midwestern community, which means you have real grid.

177
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
You have real neighborhoods and real trees, and real streets you can walk on.

178
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And you interact a lot with your neighbors --

179
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
people you like, people you might not know.

180
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And as a result it's a very tolerant community,

181
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
which is different, I think, than something like this,

182
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
which is in Schaumburg, Illinois,

183
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac

184
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and drive-through Starbucks and stuff like that.

185
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I think that actually this type of urban design,

186
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s --

187
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming

188
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
more conservative under Ronald Reagan.

189
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
But also here is another idea we have --

190
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is an intercollegiate exchange program

191
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
where you have students going from New York abroad.

192
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But frankly there are enough differences within the country now

193
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU,

194
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas,

195
0:08:27.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and vice versa. Do it at the high school level.

196
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee

197
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and might never interact in a positive affirmative way

198
0:08:36.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
with someone from another part of the country, or of another racial group.

199
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I think part of the education variable we talked about before

200
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
is the networking experience you get when you go to college

201
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise.

202
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
But the point is, this is all good news,

203
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because when something is predictable,

204
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
it is what I call designable.

205
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem,

206
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism.

207
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
If we understand the root causes of the behavior

208
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and where it manifests itself and where it doesn't,

209
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:08,000
we can start to design solutions to it.

210
0:09:08.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So that's all I have to say. Thank you very much.

211
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
(Applause)

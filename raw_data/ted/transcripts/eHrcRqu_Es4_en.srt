1
0:00:15.946,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So what I want to try to do is tell a quick story

2
0:00:18.944,000 --> 0:00:21,000
about a 404 page and a lesson that was learned as a result of it.

3
0:00:22.654,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But to start it probably helps to have an understanding

4
0:00:25.373,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of what a 404 page actually is.

5
0:00:28.885,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The 404 page is that.

6
0:00:31.991,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It's that broken experience on the Web.

7
0:00:34.331,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It's effectively the default page

8
0:00:36.642,000 --> 0:00:39,000
when you ask a website for something and it can't find it.

9
0:00:40.218,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And it serves you the 404 page.

10
0:00:42.518,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It's inherently a feeling of being broken when you go through it.

11
0:00:47.343,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I just want you to think a little bit about, remember for yourself,

12
0:00:49.968,000 --> 0:00:52,000
it's annoying when you hit this thing.

13
0:00:53.01,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Because it's the feeling of a broken relationship.

14
0:00:55.268,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And that's where it's actually also interesting to think about,

15
0:00:58.01,000 --> 0:00:59,000
where does 404 come from?

16
0:00:59.885,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's from a family of errors actually --

17
0:01:01.929,000 --> 0:01:03,000
a whole set of relationship errors,

18
0:01:04.039,000 --> 0:01:06,000
which, when I started digging into them,

19
0:01:06.343,000 --> 0:01:1,000
it looks almost like a checklist for a sex therapist or a couples counselor.

20
0:01:11.177,000 --> 0:01:14,000
You sort of get down there to the bottom and things get really dicey.

21
0:01:14.302,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:17.191,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Yes.

23
0:01:19.218,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But these things are everywhere.

24
0:01:21.462,000 --> 0:01:23,000
They're on sites big, they're on sites small.

25
0:01:24.158,000 --> 0:01:26,000
This is a global experience.

26
0:01:26.843,000 --> 0:01:28,000
What a 404 page tells you

27
0:01:29.72,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is that you fell through the cracks.

28
0:01:33.877,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And that's not a good experience

29
0:01:35.635,000 --> 0:01:37,000
when you're used to experiences like this.

30
0:01:38.079,000 --> 0:01:39,000
You can get on your Kinect

31
0:01:39.352,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and you can have unicorns dancing

32
0:01:41.51,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and rainbows spraying out of your mobile phone.

33
0:01:44.147,000 --> 0:01:46,000
A 404 page is not what you're looking for.

34
0:01:46.237,000 --> 0:01:49,000
You get that, and it's like a slap in the face.

35
0:01:49.689,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Trying to think about how a 404 felt,

36
0:01:51.922,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and it would be like if you went to Starbucks

37
0:01:53.802,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and there's the guy behind the counter

38
0:01:55.552,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and you're over there and there's no skim milk.

39
0:01:57.364,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And you say, "Hey, could you bring the skim milk?"

40
0:01:59.343,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And they walk out from behind the counter and they've got no pants on.

41
0:02:01.508,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And you're like, "Oh, I didn't want to see that."

42
0:02:04.45,000 --> 0:02:06,000
That's the 404 feeling.

43
0:02:06.554,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:08.212,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I mean, I've heard about that.

45
0:02:10.468,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So where this comes into play and why this is important

46
0:02:14.606,000 --> 0:02:15,000
is I head up a technology incubator,

47
0:02:15.937,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and we had eight startups sitting around there.

48
0:02:17.937,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And those startups are focused on what they are, not what they're not,

49
0:02:20.973,000 --> 0:02:21,000
until one day Athletepath,

50
0:02:22.769,000 --> 0:02:25,000
which is a website that focuses on services for extreme athletes,

51
0:02:26.447,000 --> 0:02:27,000
found this video.

52
0:02:27.885,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Video) Guy: Joey!

53
0:02:31.45,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Crowd: Whoa!

54
0:02:36.254,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Renny Gleeson: You just ... no, he's not okay.

55
0:02:39.635,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They took that video and they embedded it in their 404 page

56
0:02:43.678,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and it was like a light bulb went off for everybody in the place.

57
0:02:46.51,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Because finally there was a page

58
0:02:49.218,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that actually felt like what it felt like to hit a 404.

59
0:02:52.419,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:53.945,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Applause)

61
0:02:55.726,000 --> 0:02:57,000
So this turned into a contest.

62
0:02:58.093,000 --> 0:03:,000
Dailypath that offers inspiration

63
0:03:00.343,000 --> 0:03:02,000
put inspiration on their 404 page.

64
0:03:02.839,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Stayhound, which helps you find pet sitters through your social network,

65
0:03:06.755,000 --> 0:03:07,000
commiserated with your pet.

66
0:03:08.575,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Each one of them found this.

67
0:03:09.968,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It turned into a 24-hour contest.

68
0:03:11.218,000 --> 0:03:14,000
At 4:04 the next day, we gave out $404 in cash.

69
0:03:14.343,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And what they learned

70
0:03:15.76,000 --> 0:03:17,000
was that those little things, done right, actually matter,

71
0:03:18.144,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and that well-designed moments can build brands.

72
0:03:20.79,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So you take a look out in the real world,

73
0:03:22.718,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and the fun thing is you can actually hack these yourself.

74
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
You can type in an URL and put in a 404 and these will pop.

75
0:03:28.091,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This is one that commiserates with you.

76
0:03:30.089,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This is one that blames you.

77
0:03:31.839,000 --> 0:03:32,000
This is one that I loved.

78
0:03:33.677,000 --> 0:03:35,000
This is an error page,

79
0:03:36.01,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but what if this error page was also an opportunity?

80
0:03:40.056,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So it was a moment in time

81
0:03:42.222,000 --> 0:03:44,000
where all of these startups had to sit and think

82
0:03:44.493,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and got really excited about what they could be.

83
0:03:46.815,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Because back to the whole relationship issue,

84
0:03:49.412,000 --> 0:03:51,000
what they figured out through this exercise

85
0:03:51.669,000 --> 0:03:53,000
was that a simple mistake can tell me what you're not,

86
0:03:54.506,000 --> 0:03:57,000
or it can remind me of why I should love you.

87
0:03:57.825,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Thank you.

88
0:03:59.583,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.96,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Words matter.

2
0:00:19.48,000 --> 0:00:21,000
They can heal

3
0:00:21.68,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and they can kill ...

4
0:00:24.04,000 --> 0:00:26,000
yet, they have a limit.

5
0:00:28.96,000 --> 0:00:3,000
When I was in eighth grade,

6
0:00:32.6,000 --> 0:00:36,000
my teacher gave me a vocabulary sheet

7
0:00:36.64,000 --> 0:00:38,000
with the word "genocide."

8
0:00:43.12,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I hated it.

9
0:00:46.84,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The word genocide is clinical ...

10
0:00:52.48,000 --> 0:00:53,000
overgeneral ...

11
0:00:56.64,000 --> 0:00:58,000
bloodless ...

12
0:00:58.8,000 --> 0:00:59,000
dehumanizing.

13
0:01:03.28,000 --> 0:01:04,000
No word

14
0:01:06.24,000 --> 0:01:08,000
can describe

15
0:01:08.44,000 --> 0:01:11,000
what this does to a nation.

16
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You need to know,

17
0:01:15.92,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in this kind of war,

18
0:01:19.12,000 --> 0:01:21,000
husbands kills wives,

19
0:01:22.64,000 --> 0:01:24,000
wives kill husbands,

20
0:01:26.6,000 --> 0:01:29,000
neighbors and friends kill each other.

21
0:01:33.64,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Someone

22
0:01:36.12,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in power

23
0:01:37.36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
says,

24
0:01:39.96,000 --> 0:01:4,000
"Those over there ...

25
0:01:42.52,000 --> 0:01:43,000
they don't belong.

26
0:01:44.68,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They're not human."

27
0:01:47.12,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And people believe it.

28
0:01:51.76,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I don't want words

29
0:01:54.12,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to describe this kind of behavior.

30
0:01:58.72,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I want words to stop it.

31
0:02:04.8,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But where are the words to stop this?

32
0:02:08.12,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And how do we find the words?

33
0:02:14.12,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But I believe, truly, we have to keep trying.

34
0:02:21.96,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I was born in Kigali, Rwanda.

35
0:02:26.12,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I felt loved by my entire family

36
0:02:31.24,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and my neighbors.

37
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I was constantly being teased by everybody,

38
0:02:38.32,000 --> 0:02:4,000
especially my two older siblings.

39
0:02:42.24,000 --> 0:02:43,000
When I lost my front tooth,

40
0:02:45.44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
my brother looked at me and said,

41
0:02:47.56,000 --> 0:02:49,000
"Oh, it has happened to you, too?

42
0:02:51.92,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It will never grow back."

43
0:02:53.44,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:54.48,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I enjoyed playing everywhere,

45
0:02:56.72,000 --> 0:03:,000
especially my mother's garden and my neighbor's.

46
0:03:01.48,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I loved my kindergarten.

47
0:03:04.44,000 --> 0:03:06,000
We sang songs,

48
0:03:06.88,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we played everywhere

49
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and ate lunch.

50
0:03:11.6,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I had a childhood

51
0:03:14.96,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that I would wish for anyone.

52
0:03:20.68,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But when I was six,

53
0:03:23.4,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the adults in my family began to speak in whispers

54
0:03:29.04,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and shushed me any time that I asked a question.

55
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:36,000
One night,

56
0:03:36.28,000 --> 0:03:37,000
my mom and dad came.

57
0:03:39.2,000 --> 0:03:41,000
They had this strange look when they woke us.

58
0:03:43.64,000 --> 0:03:48,000
They sent my older sister Claire and I to our grandparent's,

59
0:03:48.96,000 --> 0:03:5,000
hoping whatever was happening would blow away.

60
0:03:54.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Soon we had to escape from there, too.

61
0:03:59.4,000 --> 0:04:,000
We hid,

62
0:04:00.84,000 --> 0:04:01,000
we crawled,

63
0:04:02.08,000 --> 0:04:03,000
we sometimes ran.

64
0:04:08.84,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Sometimes I heard laughter

65
0:04:14.88,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and then screaming and crying

66
0:04:19.6,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and then noise that I had never heard.

67
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You see,

68
0:04:25.24,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I did not know

69
0:04:29.04,000 --> 0:04:31,000
what those noises were.

70
0:04:32.56,000 --> 0:04:34,000
They were neither human --

71
0:04:34.88,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and also at the same time, they were human.

72
0:04:38.68,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I saw people who were not breathing.

73
0:04:43.92,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I thought they were asleep.

74
0:04:48.48,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I still didn't understand what death was,

75
0:04:53.4,000 --> 0:04:55,000
or killing in itself.

76
0:04:57.76,000 --> 0:05:,000
When we would stop to rest for a little bit

77
0:05:01.28,000 --> 0:05:02,000
or search for food,

78
0:05:03.24,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I would close my eyes,

79
0:05:05.2,000 --> 0:05:07,000
hoping when I opened them,

80
0:05:07.76,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I would be awake.

81
0:05:11.48,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I had no idea which direction was home.

82
0:05:16.8,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Days were for hiding

83
0:05:20.12,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and night for walking.

84
0:05:28.28,000 --> 0:05:33,000
You go from a person who's away from home

85
0:05:33.32,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to a person with no home.

86
0:05:37.2,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The place that is supposed to want you

87
0:05:39.88,000 --> 0:05:4,000
has pushed you out,

88
0:05:44.36,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and no one takes you in.

89
0:05:48.76,000 --> 0:05:5,000
You are unwanted

90
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
by anyone.

91
0:05:56.76,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You are a refugee.

92
0:06:02.24,000 --> 0:06:04,000
From age six to 12,

93
0:06:04.48,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I lived in seven different countries,

94
0:06:08.56,000 --> 0:06:11,000
moving from one refugee camp to another,

95
0:06:12.72,000 --> 0:06:14,000
hoping we would be wanted.

96
0:06:18.2,000 --> 0:06:2,000
My older sister Claire,

97
0:06:20.6,000 --> 0:06:21,000
she became a young mother ...

98
0:06:25.32,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and a master at getting things done.

99
0:06:29.92,000 --> 0:06:3,000
When I was 12,

100
0:06:31.84,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I came to America with Claire and her family on refugee status.

101
0:06:39.96,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And that's only the beginning,

102
0:06:42.64,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because even though I was 12 years old,

103
0:06:45.68,000 --> 0:06:47,000
sometimes I felt like three years old

104
0:06:47.92,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and sometimes 50 years old.

105
0:06:50.96,000 --> 0:06:51,000
My past receded,

106
0:06:52.8,000 --> 0:06:53,000
grew jumbled,

107
0:06:54.04,000 --> 0:06:55,000
distorted.

108
0:06:56.2,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Everything was too much

109
0:06:59.08,000 --> 0:07:,000
and nothing.

110
0:07:02.88,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Time seemed like pages torn out of a book

111
0:07:08.04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and scattered everywhere.

112
0:07:11.6,000 --> 0:07:15,000
This still happens to me standing right here.

113
0:07:20.8,000 --> 0:07:22,000
After I got to America,

114
0:07:25.84,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Claire and I did not talk about our past.

115
0:07:31.4,000 --> 0:07:33,000
In 2006,

116
0:07:33.64,000 --> 0:07:34,000
after 12 years

117
0:07:37.44,000 --> 0:07:38,000
being separated away from my family,

118
0:07:39.36,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and then seven years knowing that they were dead

119
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and them thinking that we were dead,

120
0:07:44.88,000 --> 0:07:45,000
we reunited ...

121
0:07:47.48,000 --> 0:07:52,000
in the most dramatic, American way possible.

122
0:07:53.88,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Live,

123
0:07:55.8,000 --> 0:07:56,000
on television --

124
0:07:57.44,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Laughter)

125
0:07:58.6,000 --> 0:07:59,000
on "The Oprah Show."

126
0:08:00.04,000 --> 0:08:01,000
(Laughter)

127
0:08:01.88,000 --> 0:08:05,000
(Applause)

128
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I told you, I told you.

129
0:08:10.96,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Laughter)

130
0:08:13.84,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But after the show,

131
0:08:20.84,000 --> 0:08:24,000
as I spent time with my mom and dad

132
0:08:25.84,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and my little sister

133
0:08:28.52,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and my two new siblings that I never met,

134
0:08:33.2,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I felt anger.

135
0:08:36.96,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I felt every deep pain in me.

136
0:08:43.52,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And I know that there is absolutely nothing,

137
0:08:48.44,000 --> 0:08:49,000
nothing,

138
0:08:50.44,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that could restore the time we lost with each other

139
0:08:55.52,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and the relationship we could've had.

140
0:09:00.48,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Soon, my parents moved to the United States,

141
0:09:04.68,000 --> 0:09:05,000
but like Claire,

142
0:09:07.2,000 --> 0:09:1,000
they don't talk about our past.

143
0:09:12.2,000 --> 0:09:16,000
They live in never-ending present.

144
0:09:16.24,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Not asking too many questions,

145
0:09:19.28,000 --> 0:09:22,000
not allowing themselves to feel --

146
0:09:24.24,000 --> 0:09:27,000
moving in small steps.

147
0:09:29.8,000 --> 0:09:33,000
None of us, of course, can make sense of what happened to us.

148
0:09:38.68,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Though my family is alive --

149
0:09:42.84,000 --> 0:09:44,000
yes, we were broken,

150
0:09:45.44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and yes, we are numb

151
0:09:48.2,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and we were silenced by our own experience.

152
0:09:55.8,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It's not just my family.

153
0:10:02.32,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Rwanda is not the only country

154
0:10:07.12,000 --> 0:10:09,000
where people have turned on each other

155
0:10:10.08,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and murdered each other.

156
0:10:13.44,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The entire human race,

157
0:10:17.64,000 --> 0:10:18,000
in many ways,

158
0:10:18.92,000 --> 0:10:19,000
is like my family.

159
0:10:23.8,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Not dead;

160
0:10:25.52,000 --> 0:10:31,000
yes, broken, numb and silenced by the violence of the world

161
0:10:31.6,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that has taken over.

162
0:10:35.68,000 --> 0:10:36,000
You see,

163
0:10:36.92,000 --> 0:10:4,000
the chaos of the violence continues inside

164
0:10:41.88,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in the words we use

165
0:10:45.04,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and the stories we create every single day.

166
0:10:51.48,000 --> 0:10:56,000
But also on the labels that we impose on ourselves

167
0:10:57.12,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and each other.

168
0:11:01.32,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Once we call someone "other,"

169
0:11:06.44,000 --> 0:11:07,000
"less than,"

170
0:11:07.8,000 --> 0:11:08,000
"one of them"

171
0:11:09.08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
or "better than,"

172
0:11:11.6,000 --> 0:11:12,000
believe me ...

173
0:11:16.08,000 --> 0:11:18,000
under the right condition,

174
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
it's a short path to more destruction.

175
0:11:25.88,000 --> 0:11:26,000
More chaos

176
0:11:27.72,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and more noise

177
0:11:29.08,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that we will not understand.

178
0:11:33.08,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Words will never be enough

179
0:11:37.48,000 --> 0:11:42,000
to quantify and qualify the many magnitudes

180
0:11:42.84,000 --> 0:11:45,000
of human-caused destruction.

181
0:11:49.52,000 --> 0:11:51,000
In order for us

182
0:11:53.04,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to stop the violence that goes on in the world,

183
0:11:59.6,000 --> 0:12:,000
I hope --

184
0:12:01.36,000 --> 0:12:03,000
at least I beg you --

185
0:12:03.92,000 --> 0:12:04,000
to pause.

186
0:12:06.96,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Let's ask ourselves:

187
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Who are we without words?

188
0:12:16.08,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Who are we without labels?

189
0:12:21.48,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Who are we in our breath?

190
0:12:26.64,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Who are we in our heartbeat?

191
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
(Applause)

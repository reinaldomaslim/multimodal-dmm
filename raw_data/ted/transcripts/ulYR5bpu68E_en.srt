2
0:00:12.97,000 --> 0:00:15,000
If I asked you to picture the air,

3
0:00:16.924,000 --> 0:00:17,000
what do you imagine?

4
0:00:20.728,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Most people think about either empty space

5
0:00:24.242,000 --> 0:00:26,000
or clear blue sky

6
0:00:26.324,000 --> 0:00:28,000
or sometimes trees dancing in the wind.

7
0:00:29.669,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And then I remember my high school chemistry teacher with really long socks

8
0:00:33.374,000 --> 0:00:34,000
at the blackboard,

9
0:00:34.585,000 --> 0:00:37,000
drawing diagrams of bubbles connected to other bubbles,

10
0:00:38.013,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and describing how they vibrate and collide in a kind of frantic soup.

11
0:00:44.029,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But really, we tend not to think about the air that much at all.

12
0:00:48.496,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We notice it mostly

13
0:00:50.207,000 --> 0:00:54,000
when there's some kind of unpleasant sensory intrusion upon it,

14
0:00:54.329,000 --> 0:00:58,000
like a terrible smell or something visible like smoke or mist.

15
0:00:59.951,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But it's always there.

16
0:01:03.027,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It's touching all of us right now.

17
0:01:05.531,000 --> 0:01:06,000
It's even inside us.

18
0:01:08.827,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Our air is immediate, vital and intimate.

19
0:01:14.883,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.

20
0:01:19.829,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So what is the air?

21
0:01:21.923,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It's the combination of the invisible gases that envelop the Earth,

22
0:01:25.687,000 --> 0:01:27,000
attracted by the Earth's gravitational pull.

23
0:01:29.09,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And even though I'm a visual artist,

24
0:01:32.54,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I'm interested in the invisibility of the air.

25
0:01:36.447,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I'm interested in how we imagine it,

26
0:01:39.046,000 --> 0:01:41,000
how we experience it

27
0:01:41.118,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and how we all have an innate understanding of its materiality

28
0:01:44.956,000 --> 0:01:45,000
through breathing.

29
0:01:48.35,000 --> 0:01:53,000
All life on Earth changes the air through gas exchange,

30
0:01:54.034,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and we're all doing it right now.

31
0:01:56.499,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Actually, why don't we all right now together take

32
0:01:59.491,000 --> 0:02:01,000
one big, collective, deep breath in.

33
0:02:02.276,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Ready? In. (Inhales)

34
0:02:06.829,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And out. (Exhales)

35
0:02:10.602,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That air that you just exhaled,

36
0:02:13.296,000 --> 0:02:16,000
you enriched a hundred times in carbon dioxide.

37
0:02:18.178,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So roughly five liters of air per breath, 17 breaths per minute

38
0:02:24.339,000 --> 0:02:29,000
of the 525,600 minutes per year,

39
0:02:29.94,000 --> 0:02:34,000
comes to approximately 45 million liters of air,

40
0:02:35.424,000 --> 0:02:38,000
enriched 100 times in carbon dioxide,

41
0:02:39.442,000 --> 0:02:4,000
just for you.

42
0:02:41.642,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now, that's equivalent to about 18 Olympic-sized swimming pools.

43
0:02:48.023,000 --> 0:02:5,000
For me, air is plural.

44
0:02:50.254,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's simultaneously as small as our breathing

45
0:02:53.351,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and as big as the planet.

46
0:02:56.509,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And it's kind of hard to picture.

47
0:03:00.407,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Maybe it's impossible, and maybe it doesn't matter.

48
0:03:03.804,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Through my visual arts practice,

49
0:03:06.437,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I try to make air, not so much picture it,

50
0:03:10.154,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but to make it visceral and tactile and haptic.

51
0:03:14.997,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I try to expand this notion of the aesthetic, how things look,

52
0:03:19.828,000 --> 0:03:22,000
so that it can include things like how it feels on your skin

53
0:03:23.465,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and in your lungs,

54
0:03:25.187,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and how your voice sounds as it passes through it.

55
0:03:29.847,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I explore the weight, density and smell, but most importantly,

56
0:03:34.359,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I think a lot about the stories we attach to different kinds of air.

57
0:03:41.911,000 --> 0:03:44,000
This is a work I made in 2014.

58
0:03:46.692,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's called "Different Kinds of Air: A Plant's Diary,"

59
0:03:49.815,000 --> 0:03:52,000
where I was recreating the air from different eras in Earth's evolution,

60
0:03:53.747,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and inviting the audience to come in and breathe them with me.

61
0:03:56.771,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And it's really surprising, so drastically different.

62
0:04:01.665,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Now, I'm not a scientist,

63
0:04:03.775,000 --> 0:04:05,000
but atmospheric scientists will look for traces

64
0:04:06.775,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in the air chemistry in geology,

65
0:04:09.557,000 --> 0:04:11,000
a bit like how rocks can oxidize,

66
0:04:11.898,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and they'll extrapolate that information and aggregate it,

67
0:04:15.271,000 --> 0:04:18,000
such that they can pretty much form a recipe

68
0:04:18.444,000 --> 0:04:19,000
for the air at different times.

69
0:04:20.529,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Then I come in as the artist and take that recipe

70
0:04:23.188,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and recreate it using the component gases.

71
0:04:27.836,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I was particularly interested in moments of time

72
0:04:31.59,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that are examples of life changing the air,

73
0:04:35.656,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but also the air that can influence how life will evolve,

74
0:04:40.786,000 --> 0:04:41,000
like Carboniferous air.

75
0:04:43.399,000 --> 0:04:46,000
It's from about 300 to 350 million years ago.

76
0:04:47.359,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It's an era known as the time of the giants.

77
0:04:51.141,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So for the first time in the history of life,

78
0:04:53.629,000 --> 0:04:54,000
lignin evolves.

79
0:04:55.052,000 --> 0:04:57,000
That's the hard stuff that trees are made of.

80
0:04:57.4,000 --> 0:05:,000
So trees effectively invent their own trunks at this time,

81
0:05:00.954,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and they get really big, bigger and bigger,

82
0:05:03.024,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and pepper the Earth,

83
0:05:04.403,000 --> 0:05:07,000
releasing oxygen, releasing oxygen, releasing oxygen,

84
0:05:07.72,000 --> 0:05:1,000
such that the oxygen levels are about twice as high

85
0:05:11.358,000 --> 0:05:12,000
as what they are today.

86
0:05:13.421,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And this rich air supports massive insects --

87
0:05:17.308,000 --> 0:05:22,000
huge spiders and dragonflies with a wingspan of about 65 centimeters.

88
0:05:24.189,000 --> 0:05:27,000
To breathe, this air is really clean and really fresh.

89
0:05:28.128,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It doesn't so much have a flavor,

90
0:05:29.823,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but it does give your body a really subtle kind of boost of energy.

91
0:05:34.319,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It's really good for hangovers.

92
0:05:36.21,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:38.439,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Or there's the air of the Great Dying --

94
0:05:41.137,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that's about 252.5 million years ago,

95
0:05:44.785,000 --> 0:05:46,000
just before the dinosaurs evolve.

96
0:05:46.851,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's a really short time period, geologically speaking,

97
0:05:50.607,000 --> 0:05:52,000
from about 20- to 200,000 years.

98
0:05:53.59,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Really quick.

99
0:05:55.995,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This is the greatest extinction event in Earth's history,

100
0:05:58.711,000 --> 0:06:,000
even bigger than when the dinosaurs died out.

101
0:06:02.035,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Eighty-five to 95 percent of species at this time die out,

102
0:06:06.016,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and simultaneous to that is a huge, dramatic spike in carbon dioxide,

103
0:06:11.217,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that a lot of scientists agree

104
0:06:12.834,000 --> 0:06:15,000
comes from a simultaneous eruption of volcanoes

105
0:06:15.995,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and a runaway greenhouse effect.

106
0:06:20.802,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Oxygen levels at this time go to below half of what they are today,

107
0:06:24.429,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so about 10 percent.

108
0:06:25.748,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So this air would definitely not support human life,

109
0:06:28.653,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but it's OK to just have a breath.

110
0:06:30.699,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And to breathe, it's oddly comforting.

111
0:06:33.759,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's really calming, it's quite warm

112
0:06:36.706,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and it has a flavor a little bit like soda water.

113
0:06:40.878,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It has that kind of spritz, quite pleasant.

114
0:06:44.745,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So with all this thinking about air of the past,

115
0:06:47.197,000 --> 0:06:5,000
it's quite natural to start thinking about the air of the future.

116
0:06:51.962,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And instead of being speculative with air

117
0:06:54.78,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and just making up what I think might be the future air,

118
0:06:58.318,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I discovered this human-synthesized air.

119
0:07:02.557,000 --> 0:07:04,000
That means that it doesn't occur anywhere in nature,

120
0:07:05.562,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but it's made by humans in a laboratory

121
0:07:08.703,000 --> 0:07:11,000
for application in different industrial settings.

122
0:07:13.405,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Why is it future air?

123
0:07:15.359,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Well, this air is a really stable molecule

124
0:07:19.716,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that will literally be part of the air once it's released,

125
0:07:23.364,000 --> 0:07:27,000
for the next 300 to 400 years, before it's broken down.

126
0:07:28.094,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So that's about 12 to 16 generations.

127
0:07:33.253,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And this future air has some very sensual qualities.

128
0:07:37.631,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's very heavy.

129
0:07:39.599,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's about eight times heavier than the air we're used to breathing.

130
0:07:45.249,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's so heavy, in fact, that when you breathe it in,

131
0:07:48.306,000 --> 0:07:51,000
whatever words you speak are kind of literally heavy as well,

132
0:07:51.727,000 --> 0:07:54,000
so they dribble down your chin and drop to the floor

133
0:07:54.957,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and soak into the cracks.

134
0:07:57.043,000 --> 0:08:,000
It's an air that operates quite a lot like a liquid.

135
0:08:01.867,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Now, this air comes with an ethical dimension as well.

136
0:08:06.046,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Humans made this air,

137
0:08:07.843,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but it's also the most potent greenhouse gas

138
0:08:12.123,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that has ever been tested.

139
0:08:14.862,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Its warming potential is 24,000 times that of carbon dioxide,

140
0:08:20.621,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and it has that longevity of 12 to 16 generations.

141
0:08:25.055,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So this ethical confrontation is really central to my work.

142
0:08:43.38,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(In a lowered voice) It has another quite surprising quality.

143
0:08:47.303,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It changes the sound of your voice quite dramatically.

144
0:08:50.74,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Laughter)

145
0:08:56.965,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So when we start to think -- ooh! It's still there a bit.

146
0:08:59.981,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

147
0:09:01.439,000 --> 0:09:03,000
When we think about climate change,

148
0:09:04.053,000 --> 0:09:09,000
we probably don't think about giant insects and erupting volcanoes

149
0:09:10.046,000 --> 0:09:11,000
or funny voices.

150
0:09:13.027,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The images that more readily come to mind

151
0:09:15.56,000 --> 0:09:2,000
are things like retreating glaciers and polar bears adrift on icebergs.

152
0:09:21.303,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We think about pie charts and column graphs

153
0:09:24.183,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and endless politicians talking to scientists wearing cardigans.

154
0:09:29.901,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But perhaps it's time we start thinking about climate change

155
0:09:34.118,000 --> 0:09:37,000
on the same visceral level that we experience the air.

156
0:09:39.558,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Like air, climate change is simultaneously at the scale of the molecule,

157
0:09:45.022,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the breath and the planet.

158
0:09:48.959,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's immediate, vital and intimate,

159
0:09:52.462,000 --> 0:09:56,000
as well as being amorphous and cumbersome.

160
0:09:58.271,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And yet, it's so easily forgotten.

161
0:10:03.558,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Climate change is the collective self-portrait of humanity.

162
0:10:07.468,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It reflects our decisions as individuals,

163
0:10:10.055,000 --> 0:10:12,000
as governments and as industries.

164
0:10:13.406,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And if there's anything I've learned from looking at air,

165
0:10:16.672,000 --> 0:10:19,000
it's that even though it's changing, it persists.

166
0:10:20.605,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It may not support the kind of life that we'd recognize,

167
0:10:24.219,000 --> 0:10:26,000
but it will support something.

168
0:10:26.947,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And if we humans are such a vital part of that change,

169
0:10:30.457,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I think it's important that we can feel the discussion.

170
0:10:35.032,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Because even though it's invisible,

171
0:10:39.105,000 --> 0:10:43,000
humans are leaving a very vibrant trace in the air.

172
0:10:44.811,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Thank you.

173
0:10:46.051,000 --> 0:10:47,000

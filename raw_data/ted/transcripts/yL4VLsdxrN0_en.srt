2
0:00:14.963,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's said that to be a poet

3
0:00:18.948,000 --> 0:00:21,000
you have to go to hell and back.

4
0:00:24.173,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The first time I visited the prison,

5
0:00:27.349,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I was not surprised by the noise of the padlocks,

6
0:00:32.025,000 --> 0:00:36,000
or the closing doors, or the cell bars,

7
0:00:36.243,000 --> 0:00:4,000
or by any of the things I had imagined.

8
0:00:40.246,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Maybe because the prison is in a quite open space.

9
0:00:45.559,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You can see the sky.

10
0:00:47.689,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Seagulls fly overhead, and you feel like you're next to the sea,

11
0:00:51.332,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that you're really close to the beach.

12
0:00:54.375,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But in fact, the gulls are looking for food in the dump near the prison.

13
0:01:01.25,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I went farther inside and I suddenly saw inmates moving across the corridors.

14
0:01:07.886,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Then it was as if I stepped back and thought

15
0:01:11.966,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that I could have very well been one of them.

16
0:01:15.775,000 --> 0:01:2,000
If I had another story, another context, different luck.

17
0:01:22.457,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Because nobody - nobody - can choose where they're born.

18
0:01:29.79,000 --> 0:01:33,000
In 2009, I was invited to join a project

19
0:01:34.453,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that San Martín National University conducted at the Unit 48 penitentiary,

20
0:01:39.865,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to coordinate a writing workshop.

21
0:01:43.08,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The prison service ceded some land at the end of the prison,

22
0:01:49.525,000 --> 0:01:54,000
which is where they constructed the University Center building.

23
0:01:56.152,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The first time I met with the prisoners,

24
0:01:58.57,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I asked them why they were asking for a writing workshop

25
0:02:02.245,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and they told me they wanted to put on paper

26
0:02:05.896,000 --> 0:02:08,000
all that they couldn't say and do.

27
0:02:11.062,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Right then I decided that I wanted poetry to enter the prison.

28
0:02:17.434,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So I said to them why don't we work with poetry,

29
0:02:21.044,000 --> 0:02:22,000
if they knew what poetry was.

30
0:02:23.375,000 --> 0:02:27,000
But nobody had a clue what poetry really was.

31
0:02:30.622,000 --> 0:02:31,000
They also suggested to me

32
0:02:32.256,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that the workshop should be not just for the inmates

33
0:02:34.775,000 --> 0:02:39,000
taking university classes, but for all the inmates.

34
0:02:40.641,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And so I said that to start this workshop,

35
0:02:43.808,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I needed to find a tool that we all had in common.

36
0:02:47.65,000 --> 0:02:5,000
That tool was language.

37
0:02:50.756,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We had language, we had the workshop. We could have poetry.

38
0:02:56.948,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But what I hadn't considered was that inequality exists in prison, too.

39
0:03:02.774,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Many of the prisoners hadn't even completed grammar school.

40
0:03:07.895,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Many couldn't use cursive, could barely print.

41
0:03:15.41,000 --> 0:03:18,000
They didn't write fluently, either.

42
0:03:19.082,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So we started looking for short poems.

43
0:03:23.693,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Very short, but very powerful.

44
0:03:26.759,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And we started to read, and we'd read one author, then another author,

45
0:03:30.507,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and by reading such short poems, they all began to realize

46
0:03:35.982,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that what the poetic language did was to break a certain logic,

47
0:03:40.639,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and create another system.

48
0:03:42.394,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Breaking the logic of language also breaks the logic of the system

49
0:03:45.988,000 --> 0:03:48,000
under which they've learned to respond.

50
0:03:50.55,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So a new system appeared,

51
0:03:54.043,000 --> 0:03:59,000
new rules that made them understand very quickly,

52
0:03:59.202,000 --> 0:04:,000
- very quickly -

53
0:04:01.081,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that with poetic language

54
0:04:03.23,000 --> 0:04:07,000
they would be able to say absolutely whatever they wanted.

55
0:04:11.479,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It's said that to be a poet you have to go to hell and back.

56
0:04:17.475,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And they have plenty of hell. Plenty of hell.

57
0:04:21.974,000 --> 0:04:25,000
One of them once said: "In prison you never sleep.

58
0:04:26.589,000 --> 0:04:3,000
You can never sleep in jail. You can never close your eyelids."

59
0:04:32.351,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And so, like I’m doing now, I gave them a moment of silence,

60
0:04:38.707,000 --> 0:04:42,000
then said, “That's what poetry is, you guys.

61
0:04:44.309,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It's in this prison universe that you have all around you.

62
0:04:49.494,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Everything you say about how you never sleep,

63
0:04:51.774,000 --> 0:04:52,000
it exudes fear.

64
0:04:53.464,000 --> 0:04:57,000
All the things that go unwritten -- all of that is poetry."

65
0:04:59.469,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So we started appropriating that hell;

66
0:05:03.676,000 --> 0:05:06,000
we plunged ourselves, headfirst, into the seventh circle.

67
0:05:07.184,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And in that seventh circle of hell, our very own, beloved circle,

68
0:05:11.222,000 --> 0:05:15,000
they learned that they could make the walls invisible,

69
0:05:15.434,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that they could make the windows yell,

70
0:05:17.604,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and that we could hide inside the shadows.

71
0:05:23.504,000 --> 0:05:26,000
When the first year of the workshop had ended,

72
0:05:27.464,000 --> 0:05:29,000
we organized a little closing party,

73
0:05:29.872,000 --> 0:05:32,000
like you do when a job is done with so much love,

74
0:05:33.562,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and you want to celebrate with a party.

75
0:05:36.512,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We called family, friends, the university authorities.

76
0:05:40.979,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The only thing the inmates had to do was read a poem,

77
0:05:45.321,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and receive their diplomas and applause.

78
0:05:47.558,000 --> 0:05:49,000
That was our simple party.

79
0:05:52.105,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The only thing I want to leave you with

80
0:05:58.694,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is the moment in which those men,

81
0:06:03.019,000 --> 0:06:05,000
some of them just huge when standing next to me,

82
0:06:05.519,000 --> 0:06:1,000
or the young boys - so young, but with an enormous pride,

83
0:06:11.23,000 --> 0:06:16,000
held their papers and trembled like little kids and sweated,

84
0:06:17.078,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and read their poems with their voices completely broken.

85
0:06:24.042,000 --> 0:06:27,000
That moment made me think a lot

86
0:06:28.959,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that for most of them, it was surely the very first time

87
0:06:33.066,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that someone applauded them for something they had done.

88
0:06:40.809,000 --> 0:06:43,000
In prison there are things that can't be done.

89
0:06:44.262,000 --> 0:06:48,000
In prison, you can't dream. In prison, you can't cry.

90
0:06:49.118,000 --> 0:06:54,000
There are words that are virtually forbidden, like the word "time,"

91
0:06:54.147,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the word "future," the word "wish".

92
0:06:59.016,000 --> 0:07:04,000
But we dared to dream, and to dream a lot.

93
0:07:04.322,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We decided that they were going to write a book.

94
0:07:09.126,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Not only did they write a book, but they also bound it themselves.

95
0:07:13.546,000 --> 0:07:16,000
That was at the end of 2010.

96
0:07:16.642,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Then, we doubled the bet and wrote another book.

97
0:07:21.051,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And we bound that one, too.

98
0:07:22.685,000 --> 0:07:25,000
That was a short time ago, at the end of last year.

99
0:07:28.474,000 --> 0:07:31,000
What I see week after week,

100
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:36,000
is how they're turning into different people;

101
0:07:36.357,000 --> 0:07:38,000
how they're being transformed.

102
0:07:38.904,000 --> 0:07:42,000
How words are empowering them with a dignity they had never known,

103
0:07:43.251,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that they couldn't even imagine.

104
0:07:45.334,000 --> 0:07:49,000
They had no idea such dignity could come from them.

105
0:07:51.13,000 --> 0:07:58,000
At the workshop, in that beloved hell we share, we all give something.

106
0:07:58.397,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We open our hands and hearts and give what we have, what we can.

107
0:08:02.997,000 --> 0:08:04,000
All of us; all of us equally.

108
0:08:05.151,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And so you feel that at least in a small way

109
0:08:09.766,000 --> 0:08:12,000
you're repairing that huge social fracture

110
0:08:13.416,000 --> 0:08:18,000
which makes it so that for many of them,

111
0:08:18.634,000 --> 0:08:21,000
prison is their only destination.

112
0:08:24.172,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I remember a verse by a tremendous poet, a great poet,

113
0:08:30.586,000 --> 0:08:35,000
from our Unit 48 workshop, Nicolás Dorado:

114
0:08:40.395,000 --> 0:08:46,000
"I will need an infinite thread to sew up this huge wound."

115
0:08:47.485,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Poetry does that; it sews up the wounds of exclusion.

116
0:08:53.004,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It opens doors. Poetry works as a mirror.

117
0:08:58.417,000 --> 0:09:01,000
It creates a mirror, which is the poem.

118
0:09:01.762,000 --> 0:09:04,000
They recognize themselves, they look at themselves in the poem

119
0:09:05.745,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and write from who they are, and are from what they write.

120
0:09:10.808,000 --> 0:09:12,000
In order to write,

121
0:09:13.513,000 --> 0:09:17,000
they need to appropriate the moment of writing

122
0:09:17.704,000 --> 0:09:2,000
which is a moment of extraordinary freedom.

123
0:09:21.155,000 --> 0:09:23,000
They have to get into their heads, search for that bit of freedom

124
0:09:24.098,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that can never be taken away when they write

125
0:09:29.124,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and that is also useful to realize that freedom is possible

126
0:09:32.635,000 --> 0:09:34,000
even inside a prison,

127
0:09:34.973,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and that the only bars we have in our wonderful space

128
0:09:40.235,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is the word "bars,"

129
0:09:42.097,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and that all of us in our hell burn with happiness

130
0:09:45.959,000 --> 0:09:48,000
when we light the wick of the word.

131
0:09:49.669,000 --> 0:09:52,000
(Applause)

132
0:10:17.143,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I told you a lot about the prison, a lot about what I experience

133
0:10:23.597,000 --> 0:10:27,000
every week, and how I enjoy it and transform myself with the inmates.

134
0:10:28.178,000 --> 0:10:31,000
But you don't know how much I'd like it

135
0:10:31.593,000 --> 0:10:36,000
if you could feel, live, experience, even for a few seconds,

136
0:10:37.159,000 --> 0:10:41,000
what I enjoy every week and what makes me who I am.

137
0:10:44.151,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Applause)

138
0:10:53.228,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Martín Bustamante: The heart chews tears of time;

139
0:10:57.464,000 --> 0:10:59,000
blinded by that light,

140
0:11:00.346,000 --> 0:11:03,000
it hides the speed of existence

141
0:11:03.721,000 --> 0:11:05,000
where the images go rowing by.

142
0:11:05.874,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It fights; it hangs on.

143
0:11:08.847,000 --> 0:11:11,000
The heart cracks under sad gazes,

144
0:11:12.554,000 --> 0:11:15,000
rides on storms that spread fire,

145
0:11:16.327,000 --> 0:11:19,000
lifts chests lowered by shame,

146
0:11:19.451,000 --> 0:11:22,000
knows that it's not just reading and going on,

147
0:11:22.627,000 --> 0:11:25,000
it also wishes to see the infinite blue.

148
0:11:26.457,000 --> 0:11:29,000
The heart sits down to think about things,

149
0:11:30.185,000 --> 0:11:32,000
fights to avoid being ordinary,

150
0:11:32.897,000 --> 0:11:35,000
tries to love without hurting,

151
0:11:36.32,000 --> 0:11:39,000
breathes the sun, giving courage to itself,

152
0:11:40.023,000 --> 0:11:44,000
surrenders, travels toward reason.

153
0:11:44.391,000 --> 0:11:46,000
The heart fights among the swamps,

154
0:11:47.294,000 --> 0:11:5,000
skirts the edge of the underworld,

155
0:11:50.819,000 --> 0:11:54,000
falls exhausted, but won't give in to what's easy,

156
0:11:55.101,000 --> 0:11:57,000
while irregular steps of intoxication

157
0:11:57.59,000 --> 0:11:58,000
wake up,

158
0:11:59.167,000 --> 0:12:,000
wake the stillness.

159
0:12:01.057,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I'm Martín Bustamante,

160
0:12:03.756,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I'm a prisoner in Unit 48 of San Martín,

161
0:12:07.254,000 --> 0:12:09,000
today is my day of temporary release.

162
0:12:10.112,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And for me, poetry and literature have changed my life.

163
0:12:13.784,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Thank you very much!

164
0:12:14.905,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Cristina Domenech: Thank you!

165
0:12:16.325,000 --> 0:12:18,000
(Applause)

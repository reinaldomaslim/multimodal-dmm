1
0:00:12.86,000 --> 0:00:14,000
As a kid I always loved information

2
0:00:15.739,000 --> 0:00:16,000
that I could get from data

3
0:00:17.587,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and the stories that could be told with numbers.

4
0:00:20.629,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I remember, growing up, I'd be frustrated at

5
0:00:22.913,000 --> 0:00:27,000
how my own parents would lie to me using numbers.

6
0:00:28.459,000 --> 0:00:32,000
"Talithia, if I've told you once I've told you a thousand times."

7
0:00:33.443,000 --> 0:00:36,000
No dad, you've only told me 17 times

8
0:00:37.335,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and twice it wasn't my fault. (Laughter)

9
0:00:40.497,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I think that is one of the reasons I got a Ph.D. in statistics.

10
0:00:43.661,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I always wanted to know,

11
0:00:44.569,000 --> 0:00:47,000
what are people trying to hide with numbers?

12
0:00:47.755,000 --> 0:00:48,000
As a statistician,

13
0:00:48.938,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I want people to show me the data

14
0:00:52.791,000 --> 0:00:54,000
so I can decide for myself.

15
0:00:55.126,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Donald and I were pregnant with our third child

16
0:00:58.175,000 --> 0:01:,000
and we were at about 41 and a half weeks,

17
0:01:00.909,000 --> 0:01:03,000
what some of you may refer to as being overdue.

18
0:01:04.286,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Statisticians, we call that

19
0:01:06.121,000 --> 0:01:08,000
being within the 95 percent confidence interval.

20
0:01:08.807,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:10.673,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And at this point in the process

22
0:01:12.951,000 --> 0:01:14,000
we had to come in every couple of days

23
0:01:15.144,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to do a stress test on the baby,

24
0:01:16.952,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and this is just routine,

25
0:01:18.134,000 --> 0:01:22,000
it tests whether or not the baby is feeling any type of undue stress.

26
0:01:22.72,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And you are rarely, if ever, seen by your actual doctor,

27
0:01:26.113,000 --> 0:01:29,000
just whoever happens to be working at the hospital that day.

28
0:01:29.28,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So we go in for a stress test and after 20 minutes

29
0:01:32.026,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the doctor comes out and he says,

30
0:01:35.524,000 --> 0:01:4,000
"Your baby is under stress, we need to induce you."

31
0:01:41.079,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Now, as a statistician, what's my response?

32
0:01:45.698,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Show me the data!

33
0:01:49.37,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So then he proceeds to tell us

34
0:01:52.072,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the baby's heart rate trace went from 18 minutes,

35
0:01:54.497,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the baby's heart rate was in the normal zone

36
0:01:56.468,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and for two minutes it was in what appeared to be

37
0:01:59.421,000 --> 0:02:02,000
my heart rate zone and I said,

38
0:02:03.131,000 --> 0:02:05,000
"Is it possible that maybe this was my heart rate?

39
0:02:05.497,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I was moving around a little bit,

40
0:02:07.492,000 --> 0:02:09,000
it's hard to lay still on your back,

41
0:02:09.79,000 --> 0:02:11,000
41 weeks pregnant for 20 minutes.

42
0:02:12.308,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Maybe it was shifting around."

43
0:02:14.481,000 --> 0:02:18,000
He said, "Well, we don't want to take any chances."

44
0:02:19.457,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I said okay.

45
0:02:20.717,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I said, "What if I was at 36 weeks

46
0:02:22.436,000 --> 0:02:23,000
with this same data?

47
0:02:24.245,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Would your decision be to induce?"

48
0:02:28.124,000 --> 0:02:31,000
"Well, no, I would wait until you were at least

49
0:02:31.692,000 --> 0:02:33,000
38 weeks, but you are almost 42,

50
0:02:33.702,000 --> 0:02:35,000
there is no reason to leave that baby inside,

51
0:02:35.709,000 --> 0:02:36,000
let's get you a room."

52
0:02:37.66,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I said, "Well, why don't we just do it again?

53
0:02:44.241,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We can collect more data.

54
0:02:45.962,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I can try to be really still for 20 minutes.

55
0:02:48.373,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We can average the two and see

56
0:02:51.056,000 --> 0:02:53,000
what that means. (Laughter)

57
0:02:53.738,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And he goes,

58
0:02:57.385,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"Ma'am, I just don't want you to have a miscarriage."

59
0:03:04.434,000 --> 0:03:07,000
That makes three of us.

60
0:03:07.566,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And then he says,

61
0:03:08.72,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"Your chances of having a miscarriage double

62
0:03:12.838,000 --> 0:03:15,000
when you go past your due date. Let's get you a room."

63
0:03:16.605,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Wow. So now as a statistician, what's my response?

64
0:03:22.892,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Show me the data!

65
0:03:24.24,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Dude, you're talking chances,

66
0:03:25.445,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I do chances all day long, tell me all about chances.

67
0:03:27.701,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Let's talk chances. (Laughter)

68
0:03:29.523,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Let's talk chances.

69
0:03:31.488,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So I say, "Okay, great.

70
0:03:32.689,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Do I go from a 30-percent chance to a 60-percent chance?

71
0:03:36.59,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Where are we here with this miscarriage thing?

72
0:03:39.141,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And he goes, "Not quite, but it doubles,

73
0:03:42.437,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and we really just want what's best for the baby."

74
0:03:47.419,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Undaunted, I try a different angle.

75
0:03:49.582,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I said, "Okay, out of 1,000 full-term pregnant women,

76
0:03:55.089,000 --> 0:03:57,000
how many of them are going to miscarry

77
0:03:57.616,000 --> 0:03:58,000
just before their due date?

78
0:03:59.411,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And then he looks at me and looks at Donald,

79
0:04:02.259,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and he goes, about one in 1,000.

80
0:04:06.962,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I said, "Okay, so of those 1,000 women, how many

81
0:04:09.792,000 --> 0:04:13,000
are going to miscarry just after their due date?"

82
0:04:14.65,000 --> 0:04:17,000
"About two." (Laughter)

83
0:04:18.222,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I said, "Okay, so you are telling me that my chances

84
0:04:20.266,000 --> 0:04:23,000
go from a 0.1-percent chance

85
0:04:24.213,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to a 0.2-percent chance."

86
0:04:28.459,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Okay, so at this point the data is not convincing us

87
0:04:30.757,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that we need to be induced,

88
0:04:32.385,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and so then we proceed to have a conversation

89
0:04:34.334,000 --> 0:04:36,000
about how inductions lead to a higher rate

90
0:04:36.982,000 --> 0:04:39,000
of Cesarean sections, and if at all possible we'd like to avoid that.

91
0:04:40.973,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And then I said,

92
0:04:42.225,000 --> 0:04:44,000
"And I really don't think my due date is accurate."

93
0:04:45.105,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:47.705,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And so this really stunned him

95
0:04:50.445,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and he looked sort of puzzled

96
0:04:52.095,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and I said, "You may not know this,

97
0:04:54.227,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but pregnancy due dates are calculated

98
0:04:55.808,000 --> 0:04:57,000
assuming that you have a standard 28-day cycle,

99
0:04:58.346,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and my cycle ranges —

100
0:04:59.748,000 --> 0:05:02,000
sometimes it's 27, sometimes it's up to 38 —

101
0:05:03.295,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I have been collecting the data to prove it.

102
0:05:06.449,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:10.233,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And so we ended up leaving the hospital that day without being induced.

104
0:05:16.07,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We actually had to sign a waiver to walk out of the hospital.

105
0:05:22.263,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And I'm not advocating that you not listen to your doctors,

106
0:05:25.951,000 --> 0:05:26,000
because even with our first child,

107
0:05:27.869,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we were induced at 38 weeks; cervical fluid was low.

108
0:05:31.511,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I'm not anti-medical intervention.

109
0:05:33.969,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But why were confident to leave that day?

110
0:05:36.833,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Well, we had data that told a different story.

111
0:05:40.483,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We had been collecting data for six years.

112
0:05:45.491,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I had this temperature data,

113
0:05:47.789,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and it told a different story.

114
0:05:49.064,000 --> 0:05:56,000
In fact, we could probably pretty accurately estimate conception.

115
0:05:56.477,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Yeah, that's a story you want to tell

116
0:05:58.379,000 --> 0:06:01,000
at your kid's wedding reception. (Laughter)

117
0:06:01.631,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I remember like it was yesterday.

118
0:06:05.324,000 --> 0:06:07,000
My temperature was a sizzling 97.8 degrees

119
0:06:07.965,000 --> 0:06:11,000
as I stared into your father's eyes. (Laughter)

120
0:06:12.119,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Oh, yeah. Twenty-two more years, we're telling that story.

121
0:06:18.931,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But we were confident to leave because we had been collecting data.

122
0:06:21.984,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Now, what does that data look like?

123
0:06:23.59,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Here's a standard chart

124
0:06:26.427,000 --> 0:06:29,000
of a woman's waking body temperature

125
0:06:29.729,000 --> 0:06:3,000
during the course of a cycle.

126
0:06:31.246,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So from the beginning of the menstrual cycle

127
0:06:32.699,000 --> 0:06:33,000
till the beginning of the next.

128
0:06:34.051,000 --> 0:06:36,000
You'll see that the temperature is not random.

129
0:06:36.872,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Clearly there is a low pattern

130
0:06:38.936,000 --> 0:06:39,000
at the beginning of her cycle

131
0:06:40.935,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and then you see this jump and then a higher

132
0:06:43.434,000 --> 0:06:45,000
set of temperatures at the end of her cycle.

133
0:06:45.712,000 --> 0:06:46,000
So what's happening here?

134
0:06:47.133,000 --> 0:06:49,000
What is that data telling you?

135
0:06:49.739,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Well, ladies, at the beginning of our cycle,

136
0:06:52.438,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the hormone estrogen is dominant and that estrogen

137
0:06:55.78,000 --> 0:06:58,000
causes a suppression of your body temperature.

138
0:06:59.589,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And at ovulation, your body releases an egg

139
0:07:03.126,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and progesterone takes over, pro-gestation.

140
0:07:08.141,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And so your body heats up in anticipation

141
0:07:10.493,000 --> 0:07:13,000
of housing this new little fertilized egg.

142
0:07:14.279,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So why this temperature jump?

143
0:07:17.011,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Well, think about when a bird sits on her eggs.

144
0:07:20.687,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Why is she sitting on them?

145
0:07:22.153,000 --> 0:07:23,000
She wants to keep them warm,

146
0:07:24.09,000 --> 0:07:25,000
protect them and keep them warm.

147
0:07:25.594,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Ladies, this is exactly what our bodies do every month,

148
0:07:27.865,000 --> 0:07:29,000
they heat up in anticipation

149
0:07:29.956,000 --> 0:07:32,000
of keeping a new little life warm.

150
0:07:33.092,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And if nothing happens, if you are not pregnant,

151
0:07:36.022,000 --> 0:07:4,000
then estrogen takes back over and that cycle starts all over again.

152
0:07:40.564,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But if you do get pregnant, sometimes you

153
0:07:42.511,000 --> 0:07:44,000
actually see another shift in your temperatures

154
0:07:45.055,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and it stays elevated for those whole nine months.

155
0:07:48.342,000 --> 0:07:51,000
That's why you see those pregnant women just sweating and hot,

156
0:07:51.667,000 --> 0:07:54,000
because their temperatures are high.

157
0:07:55.045,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Here's a chart that we had about three or four years ago.

158
0:07:59.414,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We were really very excited about this chart.

159
0:08:01.434,000 --> 0:08:03,000
You'll see the low temperature level

160
0:08:03.97,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and then a shift and for about five days,

161
0:08:07.012,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that's about the time it takes for the egg to travel

162
0:08:09.471,000 --> 0:08:11,000
down the fallopian tube and implant,

163
0:08:11.918,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and then you see those temperatures start to go up a little bit.

164
0:08:15.559,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And in fact, we had a second temperature shift,

165
0:08:18.772,000 --> 0:08:22,000
confirmed with a pregnancy test that were indeed pregnant

166
0:08:22.832,000 --> 0:08:25,000
with our first child, very exciting.

167
0:08:25.913,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Until a couple of days later

168
0:08:27.944,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I saw some spotting and then I noticed heavy blood flow,

169
0:08:32.885,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and we had in fact had an early stage miscarriage.

170
0:08:37.244,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Had I not been taking my temperature

171
0:08:41.114,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I really would have just thought my period was late that month,

172
0:08:45.012,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but we actually had data to show

173
0:08:46.82,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that we had miscarried this baby,

174
0:08:49.447,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and even though this data revealed a really

175
0:08:51.28,000 --> 0:08:52,000
unfortunate event in our lives,

176
0:08:53.064,000 --> 0:08:55,000
it was information that we could then take to our doctor.

177
0:08:55.531,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So if there was a fertility issue or some problem,

178
0:08:58.159,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I had data to show:

179
0:08:59.414,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Look, we got pregnant, our temperature shifted,

180
0:09:01.761,000 --> 0:09:02,000
we somehow lost this baby.

181
0:09:03.445,000 --> 0:09:06,000
What is it that we can do to help prevent this problem?

182
0:09:06.805,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And it's not just about temperatures

183
0:09:10.326,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and it's not just about fertility;

184
0:09:13.067,000 --> 0:09:16,000
we can use data about our bodies to tell us a lot of things.

185
0:09:16.955,000 --> 0:09:19,000
For instance, did you know that taking your temperature can tell you a lot

186
0:09:20.785,000 --> 0:09:22,000
about the condition of your thyroid?

187
0:09:22.924,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So, your thyroid works a lot like the thermostat in your house.

188
0:09:26.939,000 --> 0:09:28,000
There is an optimal temperature that you want in your house;

189
0:09:29.157,000 --> 0:09:3,000
you set your thermostat.

190
0:09:30.681,000 --> 0:09:32,000
When it gets too cold in the house, your thermostat kicks in

191
0:09:33.175,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and says, "Hey, we need to blow some heat around."

192
0:09:36.393,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Or if it gets too hot, your thermostat

193
0:09:38.062,000 --> 0:09:41,000
registers, "Turn the A.C. on. Cool us off."

194
0:09:41.619,000 --> 0:09:44,000
That's exactly how your thyroid works in your body.

195
0:09:45.416,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Your thyroid tries to keep an optimal temperature

196
0:09:48.116,000 --> 0:09:49,000
for your body.

197
0:09:49.144,000 --> 0:09:51,000
If it gets too cold, your thyroid says, "Hey, we need to heat up."

198
0:09:51.626,000 --> 0:09:54,000
If it gets too hot, your thyroid cools you down.

199
0:09:54.814,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But what happens when your thyroid is not functioning well?

200
0:09:59.22,000 --> 0:10:01,000
When it doesn't function, then it shows up

201
0:10:01.587,000 --> 0:10:02,000
in your body temperatures,

202
0:10:02.773,000 --> 0:10:04,000
they tend to be lower than normal or very erratic.

203
0:10:05.428,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And so by collecting this data

204
0:10:06.698,000 --> 0:10:08,000
you can find out information about your thyroid.

205
0:10:09.685,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Now, what is it, if you had a thyroid problem and you went to the doctor,

206
0:10:13.249,000 --> 0:10:15,000
your doctor would actually test the amount of

207
0:10:15.682,000 --> 0:10:17,000
thyroid stimulating hormone in your blood.

208
0:10:18.62,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Fine. But the problem with that test is

209
0:10:22.803,000 --> 0:10:24,000
it doesn't tell you how active the hormone is in your body.

210
0:10:25.568,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So you might have a lot of hormone present,

211
0:10:27.617,000 --> 0:10:28,000
but it might not be actively working to regulate

212
0:10:29.365,000 --> 0:10:3,000
your body temperature.

213
0:10:30.613,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So just by collecting your temperature every day,

214
0:10:32.362,000 --> 0:10:35,000
you get information about the condition of your thyroid.

215
0:10:35.982,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So, what if you don't want to take your temperature every day?

216
0:10:38.463,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I advocate that you do,

217
0:10:40.021,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but there are tons of other things you could take.

218
0:10:41.876,000 --> 0:10:43,000
You could take your blood pressure, you could take your weight —

219
0:10:44.681,000 --> 0:10:45,000
yeah, who's excited about

220
0:10:46.271,000 --> 0:10:49,000
taking their weight every day? (Laughter)

221
0:10:49.808,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Early on in our marriage, Donald had a stuffy nose

222
0:10:54.599,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and he had been taking a slew of medications

223
0:10:57.719,000 --> 0:11:,000
to try to relieve his stuffy nose, to no avail.

224
0:11:01.718,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And so, that night he comes and he wakes me up and he says,

225
0:11:05.957,000 --> 0:11:08,000
"Honey, I can't breath out of my nose."

226
0:11:09.764,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And I roll over and I look, and I said, "Well, can you breath out of your mouth?"

227
0:11:14.582,000 --> 0:11:15,000
(Laughter)

228
0:11:16.06,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And he goes, "Yes, but I can't breath out of my nose!"

229
0:11:23.14,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And so like any good wife, I rush him

230
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
to the emergency room

231
0:11:27.995,000 --> 0:11:29,000
at 2 o'clock in the morning.

232
0:11:30.427,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And the whole time I'm driving and I'm thinking,

233
0:11:33.897,000 --> 0:11:35,000
you can't die on me now.

234
0:11:36.746,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We just got married,

235
0:11:38.916,000 --> 0:11:42,000
people will think I killed you! (Laughter)

236
0:11:43.374,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And so, we get to the emergency room, and the nurse sees us,

237
0:11:47.047,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and he can't breath out of his nose, and so

238
0:11:49.668,000 --> 0:11:51,000
she brings us to the back and the doctor says,

239
0:11:51.751,000 --> 0:11:54,000
"What seems to be the problem?" and he goes, "I can't breath out of my nose."

240
0:11:54.94,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And he said, "You can't breath out of your nose?

241
0:11:56.989,000 --> 0:12:01,000
No, but he can breath out of his mouth. (Laughter)

242
0:12:02.866,000 --> 0:12:04,000
He takes a step back and he looks at both of us

243
0:12:05.508,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and he says "Sir, I think I know the problem.

244
0:12:09.374,000 --> 0:12:1,000
You're having a heart attack.

245
0:12:10.81,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I'm going to order an EKG and a CAT scan

246
0:12:12.861,000 --> 0:12:15,000
for you immediately."

247
0:12:16.203,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And we are thinking,

248
0:12:17.831,000 --> 0:12:19,000
no, no, no. It's not a heart attack. He can breathe,

249
0:12:20.771,000 --> 0:12:24,000
just out of his mouth. No, no, no, no, no.

250
0:12:25.768,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And so we go back and forth with this doctor

251
0:12:28.031,000 --> 0:12:3,000
because we think this is the incorrect diagnosis,

252
0:12:30.509,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and he's like, "No really, it'll be fine, just calm down."

253
0:12:34.461,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And I'm thinking, how do you calm down? But I don't think he's having a heart attack.

254
0:12:38.38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And so fortunately for us, this doctor was at the end of the shift.

255
0:12:41.621,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So this new doctor comes in, he sees us clearly

256
0:12:44.536,000 --> 0:12:47,000
distraught, with a husband who can't breath

257
0:12:47.537,000 --> 0:12:5,000
out of his nose. (Laughter)

258
0:12:50.639,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And he starts asking us questions.

259
0:12:53.425,000 --> 0:12:57,000
He says, "Well, do you two exercise?"

260
0:12:58.305,000 --> 0:13:05,000
We ride our bikes, we go to the gym occasionally.

261
0:13:05.378,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Laughter)

262
0:13:07.031,000 --> 0:13:09,000
We move around.

263
0:13:09.896,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And he says, "What were you doing just before you came here?"

264
0:13:12.559,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I'm thinking, I was sleeping, honestly.

265
0:13:15.271,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But okay, what was Donald doing just before?

266
0:13:18.102,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So Donald goes into this slew of medications he was taking.

267
0:13:21.65,000 --> 0:13:23,000
He lists, "I took this decongestant and then I took this nasal spray,"

268
0:13:24.612,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and then all of a sudden a lightbulb goes off and he says,

269
0:13:26.615,000 --> 0:13:29,000
"Oh! You should never mix this decongestant with this nasal spray.

270
0:13:30.242,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Clogs you up every time. Here, take this one instead."

271
0:13:33.059,000 --> 0:13:35,000
He gives us a prescription.

272
0:13:35.325,000 --> 0:13:36,000
We're looking at each other, and I looked at the doctor,

273
0:13:37.315,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and I said, "Why is it that it seems like you

274
0:13:39.541,000 --> 0:13:41,000
were able to accurately diagnose his condition,

275
0:13:41.952,000 --> 0:13:43,000
but this previous doctor wanted to order

276
0:13:44.168,000 --> 0:13:46,000
an EKG and a CAT scan?"

277
0:13:46.674,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And he looks at us and says,

278
0:13:49.281,000 --> 0:13:53,000
"Well, when a 350-pound man walks in the emergency room and says he can't breath,

279
0:13:53.499,000 --> 0:13:54,000
you assume he's having a heart attack

280
0:13:55.263,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and you ask questions later."

281
0:13:59.212,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Now, emergency room doctors are trained to make decisions quickly,

282
0:14:04.932,000 --> 0:14:06,000
but not always accurately.

283
0:14:07.023,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And so had we had some information

284
0:14:08.572,000 --> 0:14:1,000
about our heart health to share with him,

285
0:14:10.966,000 --> 0:14:13,000
maybe we would have gotten a better diagnosis the first time.

286
0:14:14.741,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I want you to consider the following chart,

287
0:14:16.973,000 --> 0:14:17,000
of systolic blood pressure measurements

288
0:14:18.927,000 --> 0:14:22,000
from October 2010 to July 2012.

289
0:14:22.999,000 --> 0:14:23,000
You'll see that these measurements start

290
0:14:24.692,000 --> 0:14:27,000
in the prehypertension/hypertension zone,

291
0:14:28.36,000 --> 0:14:3,000
but over about the course of a year and a half

292
0:14:30.946,000 --> 0:14:32,000
they move into the normal zone.

293
0:14:33.591,000 --> 0:14:37,000
This is about the heart rate of a healthy 16-year-old.

294
0:14:37.7,000 --> 0:14:41,000
What story is this data telling you?

295
0:14:41.731,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Obviously it's the data from someone

296
0:14:44.612,000 --> 0:14:46,000
who's made a drastic transformation,

297
0:14:47.285,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and fortunately for us, that person happens to be here today.

298
0:14:52.443,000 --> 0:14:56,000
So that 350-pound guy that walked into the emergency room with me

299
0:14:56.697,000 --> 0:14:58,000
is now an even sexier and healthier

300
0:14:59.669,000 --> 0:15:05,000
225-pound guy, and that's his blood pressure trace.

301
0:15:06.357,000 --> 0:15:09,000
So over the course of that year and a half

302
0:15:09.818,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Donald's eating changed

303
0:15:11.387,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and our exercise regimen changed,

304
0:15:13.378,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and his heart rate responded,

305
0:15:16.168,000 --> 0:15:17,000
his blood pressure responded to that change

306
0:15:17.67,000 --> 0:15:19,000
that he made in his body.

307
0:15:19.969,000 --> 0:15:2,000
So what's the take-home message

308
0:15:21.947,000 --> 0:15:24,000
that I want you to leave with today?

309
0:15:25.661,000 --> 0:15:29,000
By taking ownership of your data just like we've done,

310
0:15:30.035,000 --> 0:15:33,000
just by taking this daily measurements about yourself,

311
0:15:33.982,000 --> 0:15:35,000
you become the expert on your body.

312
0:15:36.491,000 --> 0:15:38,000
You become the authority.

313
0:15:38.493,000 --> 0:15:4,000
It's not hard to do.

314
0:15:40.916,000 --> 0:15:41,000
You don't have to have a Ph.D. in statistics

315
0:15:42.836,000 --> 0:15:43,000
to be an expert in yourself.

316
0:15:44.168,000 --> 0:15:45,000
You don't have to have a medical degree

317
0:15:45.609,000 --> 0:15:47,000
to be your body's expert.

318
0:15:47.735,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Medical doctors, they're experts on the population,

319
0:15:51.154,000 --> 0:15:53,000
but you are the expert on yourself.

320
0:15:53.432,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And so when two of you come together,

321
0:15:55.342,000 --> 0:15:56,000
when two experts come together,

322
0:15:57.312,000 --> 0:15:59,000
the two of you are able to make a better decision

323
0:16:00.107,000 --> 0:16:02,000
than just your doctor alone.

324
0:16:02.107,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Now that you understand the power of information

325
0:16:05.874,000 --> 0:16:06,000
that you can get through personal data collection,

326
0:16:07.745,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I'd like you all to stand and raise your right hand.

327
0:16:11.414,000 --> 0:16:13,000
(Laughter)

328
0:16:13.973,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Yes, get it up.

329
0:16:18.771,000 --> 0:16:24,000
I challenge you to take ownership of your data.

330
0:16:25.679,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And today, I hereby confer upon you

331
0:16:29.241,000 --> 0:16:33,000
a TEDx associate's degree in elementary statistics

332
0:16:33.586,000 --> 0:16:37,000
with a concentration in time-dependent data analysis

333
0:16:38.03,000 --> 0:16:41,000
with all the rights and privileges appertaining thereto.

334
0:16:41.743,000 --> 0:16:44,000
And so the next time you are in your doctor's office,

335
0:16:45.219,000 --> 0:16:48,000
as newly inducted statisticians,

336
0:16:48.41,000 --> 0:16:5,000
what should always be your response?

337
0:16:50.92,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Audience: Show me the data! Talithia Williams: I can't hear you!

338
0:16:52.752,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Audience: Show me the data!

339
0:16:54.52,000 --> 0:16:55,000
TW: One more time!

340
0:16:55.828,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Audience: Show me the data!

341
0:16:57.367,000 --> 0:16:58,000
TW: Show me the data.

342
0:16:58.549,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Thank you.

343
0:17:01.57,000 --> 0:17:05,000
(Applause)

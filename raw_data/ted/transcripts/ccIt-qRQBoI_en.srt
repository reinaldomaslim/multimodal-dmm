1
0:00:12.736,000 --> 0:00:15,000
(Music) This is the human test,

2
0:00:15.77,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a test to see if you are a human.

3
0:00:19.29,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Please raise your hand if something applies to you.

4
0:00:23.489,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Are we agreed? Yes?

5
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Then let's begin.

6
0:00:29.486,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Have you ever eaten a booger

7
0:00:31.395,000 --> 0:00:33,000
long past your childhood?

8
0:00:33.937,000 --> 0:00:35,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:36.583,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It's okay, it's safe here.

10
0:00:40.161,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Have you ever made a small, weird sound

11
0:00:43.51,000 --> 0:00:48,000
when you remembered something embarrassing?

12
0:00:49.15,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Have you ever purposely lowercased

13
0:00:51.206,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the first letter of a text

14
0:00:53.31,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in order to come across as sad or disappointed?

15
0:00:57.32,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:59.454,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Okay.

17
0:01:02.168,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Have you ever ended a text with a period

18
0:01:04.94,000 --> 0:01:1,000
as a sign of aggression? Okay. Period.

19
0:01:11.65,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Have you ever laughed or smiled

20
0:01:13.817,000 --> 0:01:15,000
when someone said something shitty to you

21
0:01:16.489,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and then spent the rest of the day

22
0:01:18.25,000 --> 0:01:22,000
wondering why you reacted that way?

23
0:01:22.354,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Yes.

24
0:01:24.532,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Have you ever seemed to lose your airplane ticket

25
0:01:27.292,000 --> 0:01:28,000
a thousand times as you walked

26
0:01:29.18,000 --> 0:01:32,000
from the check-in to the gate?

27
0:01:32.21,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Yes.

28
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Have you ever put on a pair of pants

29
0:01:36.837,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and then much later realized that there was

30
0:01:38.676,000 --> 0:01:4,000
a loose sock smushed up against your thigh?

31
0:01:41.308,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:43.28,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Good.

33
0:01:45.812,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Have you ever tried to guess someone else's password

34
0:01:48.708,000 --> 0:01:52,000
so many times that it locked their account?

35
0:01:52.985,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Mmm.

36
0:01:54.674,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Have you ever had a nagging feeling that one day

37
0:01:57.82,000 --> 0:02:01,000
you will be discovered as a fraud?

38
0:02:02.24,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Yes, it's safe here.

39
0:02:05.314,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Have you ever hoped that there was some ability

40
0:02:07.91,000 --> 0:02:08,000
you hadn't discovered yet

41
0:02:09.84,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that you were just naturally great at?

42
0:02:13.76,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Mmm.

43
0:02:15.36,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Have you ever broken something in real life,

44
0:02:18.264,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and then found yourself looking

45
0:02:19.976,000 --> 0:02:24,000
for an "undo" button in real life?

46
0:02:25.05,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Have you ever misplaced your TED badge

47
0:02:27.232,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and then immediately started imagining

48
0:02:28.8,000 --> 0:02:33,000
what a three-day Vancouver vacation might look like?

49
0:02:35.523,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Have you ever marveled

50
0:02:37.402,000 --> 0:02:4,000
at how someone you thought was so ordinary

51
0:02:40.537,000 --> 0:02:44,000
could suddenly become so beautiful?

52
0:02:44.946,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Have you ever stared at your phone

53
0:02:47.01,000 --> 0:02:52,000
smiling like an idiot while texting with someone?

54
0:02:52.46,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Have you ever subsequently texted that person

55
0:02:54.82,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the phrase "I'm staring at the phone

56
0:02:57.612,000 --> 0:03:,000
smiling like an idiot"?

57
0:03:01.158,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Have you ever been tempted to,

58
0:03:03.228,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and then gave in to the temptation,

59
0:03:05.166,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of looking through someone else's phone?

60
0:03:09.111,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Have you ever had a conversation with yourself

61
0:03:11.391,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and then suddenly realized

62
0:03:13.375,000 --> 0:03:16,000
you're a real asshole to yourself?

63
0:03:16.568,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:18.975,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Has your phone ever run out of battery

65
0:03:21.879,000 --> 0:03:23,000
in the middle of an argument,

66
0:03:24.265,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and it sort of felt like the phone

67
0:03:25.863,000 --> 0:03:29,000
was breaking up with both of you?

68
0:03:29.915,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Have you ever thought

69
0:03:31.513,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that working on an issue between you was futile

70
0:03:34.483,000 --> 0:03:36,000
because it should just be easier than this,

71
0:03:37.204,000 --> 0:03:41,000
or this is supposed to happen just naturally?

72
0:03:41.948,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Have you ever realized that very little, in the long run,

73
0:03:45.356,000 --> 0:03:47,000
just happens naturally?

74
0:03:47.812,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Have you ever woken up blissfully

75
0:03:51.341,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and suddenly been flooded by the awful remembrance

76
0:03:54.148,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that someone had left you?

77
0:03:57.212,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Have you ever lost the ability to imagine a future

78
0:03:59.949,000 --> 0:04:,000
without a person

79
0:04:01.246,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that no longer was in your life?

80
0:04:06.418,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Have you ever looked back on that event

81
0:04:08.458,000 --> 0:04:09,000
with the sad smile of autumn

82
0:04:10.366,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and the realization that futures will happen

83
0:04:13.766,000 --> 0:04:16,000
regardless?

84
0:04:16.901,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Congratulations.

85
0:04:18.966,000 --> 0:04:2,000
You have now completed the test.

86
0:04:21.341,000 --> 0:04:24,000
You are all human.

87
0:04:24.54,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Applause)

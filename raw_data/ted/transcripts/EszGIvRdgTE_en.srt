1
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So, my question:

2
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
are we alone?

3
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The story of humans is the story of ideas --

4
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
scientific ideas that shine light into dark corners,

5
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
ideas that we embrace rationally and irrationally,

6
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
ideas for which we've lived and died and killed and been killed,

7
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
ideas that have vanished in history,

8
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and ideas that have been set in dogma.

9
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's a story of nations,

10
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
of ideologies,

11
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of territories,

12
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and of conflicts among them.

13
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
But, every moment of human history,

14
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
from the Stone Age to the Information Age,

15
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
from Sumer and Babylon to the iPod and celebrity gossip,

16
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
they've all been carried out --

17
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
every book that you've read,

18
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
every poem, every laugh, every tear --

19
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
they've all happened here.

20
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Here.

21
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Here.

22
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Here.

23
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Perspective is a very powerful thing.

25
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Perspectives can change.

26
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Perspectives can be altered.

27
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
From my perspective, we live on a fragile island of life,

28
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in a universe of possibilities.

29
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
For many millennia, humans have been on a journey to find answers,

30
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
answers to questions about naturalism and transcendence,

31
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
about who we are and why we are,

32
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and of course, who else might be out there.

33
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Is it really just us?

34
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Are we alone in this vast universe

35
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
of energy and matter and chemistry and physics?

36
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Well, if we are, it's an awful waste of space.

37
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But, what if we're not?

39
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
What if, out there, others are asking and answering similar questions?

40
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
What if they look up at the night sky, at the same stars,

41
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
but from the opposite side?

42
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Would the discovery of an older cultural civilization out there

43
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
inspire us to find ways to survive

44
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
our increasingly uncertain technological adolescence?

45
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Might it be the discovery of a distant civilization

46
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and our common cosmic origins

47
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
that finally drives home the message of the bond among all humans?

48
0:03:31.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Whether we're born in San Francisco, or Sudan,

49
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
or close to the heart of the Milky Way galaxy,

50
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
we are the products of a billion-year lineage of wandering stardust.

51
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We, all of us,

52
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
are what happens when a primordial mixture of hydrogen and helium

53
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
evolves for so long that it begins to ask where it came from.

54
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Fifty years ago,

55
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the journey to find answers took a different path

56
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and SETI, the Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence,

57
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
began.

58
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So, what exactly is SETI?

59
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Well, SETI uses the tools of astronomy

60
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to try and find evidence of someone else's technology out there.

61
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Our own technologies are visible over interstellar distances,

62
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and theirs might be as well.

63
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It might be that some massive network of communications,

64
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
or some shield against asteroidal impact,

65
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
or some huge astro-engineering project that we can't even begin to conceive of,

66
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
could generate signals at radio or optical frequencies

67
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that a determined program of searching might detect.

68
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
For millennia, we've actually turned to the priests and the philosophers

69
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
for guidance and instruction on this question of whether there's intelligent life out there.

70
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now, we can use the tools of the 21st century to try and observe what is,

71
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
rather than ask what should be, believed.

72
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
SETI doesn't presume the existence of extra terrestrial intelligence;

73
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
it merely notes the possibility, if not the probability

74
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
in this vast universe, which seems fairly uniform.

75
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
The numbers suggest a universe of possibilities.

76
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Our sun is one of 400 billion stars in our galaxy,

77
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and we know that many other stars have planetary systems.

78
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
We've discovered over 350 in the last 14 years,

79
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
including the small planet, announced earlier this week,

80
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which has a radius just twice the size of the Earth.

81
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And, if even all of the planetary systems in our galaxy were devoid of life,

82
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
there are still 100 billion other galaxies out there,

83
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
altogether 10^22 stars.

84
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Now, I'm going to try a trick, and recreate an experiment from this morning.

85
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Remember, one billion?

86
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But, this time not one billion dollars, one billion stars.

87
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Alright, one billion stars.

88
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now, up there, 20 feet above the stage,

89
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that's 10 trillion.

90
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Well, what about 10^22?

91
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Where's the line that marks that?

92
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
That line would have to be 3.8 million miles above this stage.

93
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
(Laughter)

94
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
16 times farther away than the moon,

95
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
or four percent of the distance to the sun.

96
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So, there are many possibilities.

97
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

98
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And much of this vast universe,

99
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
much more may be habitable than we once thought,

100
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
as we study extremophiles on Earth --

101
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
organisms that can live in conditions totally inhospitable for us,

102
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
in the hot, high pressure thermal vents at the bottom of the ocean,

103
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
frozen in ice, in boiling battery acid,

104
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
in the cooling waters of nuclear reactors.

105
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
These extremophiles tell us that life may exist in many other environments.

106
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
But those environments are going to be widely spaced in this universe.

107
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Even our nearest star, the Sun --

108
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
its emissions suffer the tyranny of light speed.

109
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
It takes a full eight minutes for its radiation to reach us.

110
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And the nearest star is 4.2 light years away,

111
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
which means its light takes 4.2 years to get here.

112
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And the edge of our galaxy is 75,000 light years away,

113
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and the nearest galaxy to us, 2.5 million light years.

114
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
That means any signal we detect would have started its journey a long time ago.

115
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And a signal would give us a glimpse of their past,

116
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
not their present.

117
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Which is why Phil Morrison calls SETI, "the archaeology of the future."

118
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It tells us about their past,

119
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but detection of a signal tells us it's possible for us to have a long future.

120
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I think this is what David Deutsch meant in 2005,

121
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
when he ended his Oxford TEDTalk

122
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
by saying he had two principles he'd like to share for living,

123
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and he would like to carve them on stone tablets.

124
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
The first is that problems are inevitable.

125
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The second is that problems are soluble.

126
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So, ultimately what's going to determine the success or failure of SETI

127
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
is the longevity of technologies,

128
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and the mean distance between technologies in the cosmos --

129
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
distance over space and distance over time.

130
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
If technologies don't last and persist,

131
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
we will not succeed.

132
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And we're a very young technology

133
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
in an old galaxy,

134
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and we don't yet know whether it's possible for technologies to persist.

135
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So, up until now I've been talking to you about really large numbers.

136
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Let me talk about a relatively small number.

137
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And that's the length of time that the Earth was lifeless.

138
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Zircons that are mined in the Jack Hills of western Australia,

139
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
zircons taken from the Jack Hills of western Australia

140
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
tell us that within a few hundred million years of the origin of the planet

141
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
there was abundant water and perhaps even life.

142
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So, our planet has spent the vast majority of its 4.56 billion year history

143
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
developing life,

144
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
not anticipating its emergence.

145
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Life happened very quickly,

146
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and that bodes well for the potential of life elsewhere in the cosmos.

147
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And the other thing that one should take away from this chart

148
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
is the very narrow range of time

149
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
over which humans can claim to be the dominant intelligence on the planet.

150
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's only the last few hundred thousand years

151
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
modern humans have been pursuing technology and civilization.

152
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So, one needs a very deep appreciation

153
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
of the diversity and incredible scale of life on this planet

154
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
as the first step in preparing to make contact with life elsewhere in the cosmos.

155
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We are not the pinnacle of evolution.

156
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
We are not the determined product

157
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
of billions of years of evolutionary plotting and planning.

158
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
We are one outcome of a continuing adaptational process.

159
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We are residents of one small planet

160
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in a corner of the Milky Way galaxy.

161
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And Homo sapiens are one small leaf

162
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
on a very extensive Tree of Life,

163
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
which is densely populated by organisms that have been honed for survival

164
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
over millions of years.

165
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
We misuse language,

166
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and talk about the "ascent" of man.

167
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We understand the scientific basis for the interrelatedness of life

168
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
but our ego hasn't caught up yet.

169
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So this "ascent" of man, pinnacle of evolution,

170
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
has got to go.

171
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
It's a sense of privilege that the natural universe doesn't share.

172
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Loren Eiseley has said,

173
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
"One does not meet oneself

174
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
until one catches the reflection from an eye other than human."

175
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
One day that eye may be that of an intelligent alien,

176
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and the sooner we eschew our narrow view of evolution

177
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
the sooner we can truly explore our ultimate origins and destinations.

178
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We are a small part of the story of cosmic evolution,

179
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and we are going to be responsible for our continued participation in that story,

180
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and perhaps SETI will help as well.

181
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Occasionally, throughout history, this concept

182
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
of this very large cosmic perspective comes to the surface,

183
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
and as a result we see transformative and profound discoveries.

184
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So in 1543, Nicholas Copernicus published "The Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres,"

185
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and by taking the Earth out of the center,

186
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and putting the sun in the center of the solar system,

187
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
he opened our eyes to a much larger universe,

188
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
of which we are just a small part.

189
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And that Copernican revolution continues today

190
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
to influence science and philosophy and technology and theology.

191
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So, in 1959, Giuseppe Coccone and Philip Morrison

192
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
published the first SETI article in a refereed journal,

193
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and brought SETI into the scientific mainstream.

194
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
And in 1960, Frank Drake conducted the first SETI observation

195
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
looking at two stars, Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani,

196
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
for about 150 hours.

197
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Now Drake did not discover extraterrestrial intelligence,

198
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
but he learned a very valuable lesson from a passing aircraft,

199
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and that's that terrestrial technology can interfere

200
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
with the search for extraterrestrial technology.

201
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
We've been searching ever since,

202
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but it's impossible to overstate the magnitude of the search that remains.

203
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
All of the concerted SETI efforts, over the last 40-some years,

204
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
are equivalent to scooping a single glass of water from the oceans.

205
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And no one would decide that the ocean was without fish

206
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
on the basis of one glass of water.

207
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
The 21st century now allows us to build bigger glasses --

208
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
much bigger glasses.

209
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
In Northern California, we're beginning to take observations

210
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
with the first 42 telescopes of the Allen Telescope Array --

211
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and I've got to take a moment right now to publicly thank

212
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Paul Allen and Nathan Myhrvold

213
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and all the TeamSETI members in the TED community

214
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
who have so generously supported this research.

215
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
(Applause)

216
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
The ATA is the first telescope built from a large number of small dishes,

217
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and hooked together with computers.

218
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
It's making silicon as important as aluminum,

219
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and we'll grow it in the future by adding more antennas to reach 350

220
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
for more sensitivity and leveraging Moore's law for more processing capability.

221
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Today, our signal detection algorithms

222
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
can find very simple artifacts and noise.

223
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
If you look very hard here you can see the signal from the Voyager 1 spacecraft,

224
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
the most distant human object in the universe,

225
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
106 times as far away from us as the sun is.

226
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And over those long distances, its signal is very faint when it reaches us.

227
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
It may be hard for your eye to see it,

228
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
but it's easily found with our efficient algorithms.

229
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
But this is a simple signal,

230
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and tomorrow we want to be able to find more complex signals.

231
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
This is a very good year.

232
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
2009 is the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first use of the telescope,

233
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Darwin's 200th birthday,

234
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
the 150th anniversary of the publication of "On the Origin of Species,"

235
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
the 50th anniversary of SETI as a science,

236
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
the 25th anniversary of the incorporation of the SETI Institute as a non-profit,

237
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and of course, the 25th anniversary of TED.

238
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And next month, the Kepler Spacecraft will launch

239
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and will begin to tell us just how frequent Earth-like planets are,

240
0:16:42.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
the targets for SETI's searches.

241
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
In 2009, the U.N. has declared it to be the International Year of Astronomy,

242
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
a global festival to help us residents of Earth

243
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
rediscover our cosmic origins and our place in the universe.

244
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
And in 2009, change has come to Washington,

245
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
with a promise to put science in its rightful position.

246
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:09,000
(Applause)

247
0:17:09.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So, what would change everything?

248
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Well, this is the question the Edge foundation asked this year,

249
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and four of the respondents said, "SETI."

250
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Why?

251
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Well, to quote:

252
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:24,000
"The discovery of intelligent life beyond Earth

253
0:17:24.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
would eradicate the loneliness and solipsism

254
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
that has plagued our species since its inception.

255
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And it wouldn't simply change everything,

256
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
it would change everything all at once."

257
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
So, if that's right, why did we only capture four out of those 151 minds?

258
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
I think it's a problem of completion and delivery,

259
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
because the fine print said,

260
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
"What game-changing ideas and scientific developments

261
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:54,000
would you expect to live to see?"

262
0:17:54.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
So, we have a fulfillment problem.

263
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
We need bigger glasses and more hands in the water,

264
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and then working together, maybe we can all live to see

265
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
the detection of the first extraterrestrial signal.

266
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
That brings me to my wish.

267
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:16,000
I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere

268
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
to become active participants

269
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
in the ultimate search for cosmic company.

270
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
The first step would be to tap into the global brain trust,

271
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
to build an environment where raw data could be stored,

272
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
and where it could be accessed and manipulated,

273
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
where new algorithms could be developed and old algorithms made more efficient.

274
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
And this is a technically creative challenge,

275
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
and it would change the perspective of people who worked on it.

276
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
And then, we'd like to augment the automated search with human insight.

277
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:19:01,000
We'd like to use the pattern recognition capability of the human eye

278
0:19:01.16,000 --> 0:19:07,000
to find faint, complex signals that our current algorithms miss.

279
0:19:07.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
And, of course, we'd like to inspire and engage the next generation.

280
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:19,000
We'd like to take the materials that we have built for education,

281
0:19:19.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and get them out to students everywhere,

282
0:19:22.16,000 --> 0:19:25,000
students that can't come and visit us at the ATA.

283
0:19:25.16,000 --> 0:19:27,000
We'd like to tell our story better,

284
0:19:27.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
and engage young people, and thereby change their perspective.

285
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:36,000
I'm sorry Seth Godin, but over the millennia, we've seen where tribalism leads.

286
0:19:36.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
We've seen what happens when we divide an already small planet

287
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:42,000
into smaller islands.

288
0:19:42.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
And, ultimately, we actually all belong to only one tribe,

289
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
to Earthlings.

290
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:52,000
And SETI is a mirror --

291
0:19:52.16,000 --> 0:19:55,000
a mirror that can show us ourselves

292
0:19:55.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
from an extraordinary perspective,

293
0:19:57.16,000 --> 0:20:02,000
and can help to trivialize the differences among us.

294
0:20:02.16,000 --> 0:20:09,000
If SETI does nothing but change the perspective of humans on this planet,

295
0:20:09.16,000 --> 0:20:13,000
then it will be one of the most profound endeavors in history.

296
0:20:14.16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
So, in the opening days of 2009,

297
0:20:18.16,000 --> 0:20:22,000
a visionary president stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol

298
0:20:22.16,000 --> 0:20:25,000
and said, "We cannot help but believe

299
0:20:25.16,000 --> 0:20:28,000
that the old hatreds shall someday pass,

300
0:20:28.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve,

301
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:38,000
that, as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself."

302
0:20:38.16,000 --> 0:20:4,000
So, I look forward to working with the TED community

303
0:20:40.16,000 --> 0:20:44,000
to hear about your ideas about how to fulfill this wish,

304
0:20:44.16,000 --> 0:20:48,000
and in collaborating with you,

305
0:20:48.16,000 --> 0:20:53,000
hasten the day that that visionary statement can become a reality.

306
0:20:53.16,000 --> 0:20:55,000
Thank you.

307
0:20:55.16,000 --> 0:21:17,000
(Applause)

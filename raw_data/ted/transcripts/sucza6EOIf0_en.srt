1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I should tell you that when I was asked to be here,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I thought to myself that well, it's TED.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And these TEDsters are -- you know, as innocent as that name sounds --

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world.

5
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And what could I possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough

6
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to justify my participation in something like that?

7
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And so I thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding British accent

8
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
might help things a bit.

9
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And then I thought no, no. I should just get up there and be myself

10
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and just talk the way I really talk

11
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
because, after all, this is the great unveiling.

12
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And so I thought I'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you.

13
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Although many of you already know that I do speak the Queen's English

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
because I am from Queens, New York.

15
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But the theme of this session, of course, is invention.

17
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And while I don't have any patents that I'm aware of,

18
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
you will be meeting a few of my inventions today.

19
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I suppose it's fair to say

20
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that I am interested in the invention of self or selves.

21
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits,

22
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
unique developmental experiences, geographical and historical contexts.

23
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But then what?

24
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
To what extent do we self-construct, do we self-invent?

25
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
How do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity?

26
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Like, what if one could be anyone at any time?

27
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Well my characters, like the ones in my shows,

28
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
allow me to play with the spaces between those questions.

29
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And so I've brought a couple of them with me.

30
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And well, they're very excited.

31
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
What I should tell you --

32
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
what I should tell you is that they've each prepared their own little TED talks.

33
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So feel free to think of this as Sarah University.

34
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

35
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Okay. Okay. Oh, well.

36
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Oh, wonderful.

37
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Good evening everybody.

38
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Thank you so very much for having me here today.

39
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Ah, thank you very much. My name is Lorraine Levine.

40
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Oh my! There's so many of you.

41
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Hi sweetheart. Okay.

42
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Anyway, I am here because of a young girl, Sarah Jones.

44
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
She's a very nice, young black girl.

45
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Well you know, she calls herself black --

46
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
she's really more like a caramel color if you look at her.

47
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But anyway.

48
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
She has me here because she puts me in her show,

50
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
what she calls her one-woman show.

51
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And you know what that means, of course.

52
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
That means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work.

53
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But I don't mind.

54
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Frankly, I'm kvelling just to be here

55
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
with all the luminaries you have attending something like this, you know.

56
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Really, it's amazing.

57
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Not only, of course, the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries

58
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but the celebrities.

59
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
There are so many celebrities running around here.

60
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I saw -- Glenn Close I saw earlier. I love her.

61
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And she was getting a yogurt in the Google cafe.

62
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Isn't that adorable?

63
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So many others you see, they're just wonderful.

65
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's lovely to know they're concerned, you know.

66
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And -- oh, I saw Goldie Hawn.

67
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Oh, Goldie Hawn. I love her, too; she's wonderful. Yeah.

68
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
You know, she's only half Jewish.

69
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Did you know that about her?

70
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Yeah. But even so, a wonderful talent. (Laughter)

71
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And I -- you know, when I saw her, such a wonderful feeling.

72
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Yeah, she's lovely.

73
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But anyway, I should have started by saying just how lucky I feel.

74
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
It's such an eye-opening experience to be here.

75
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
You're all so responsible for this world that we live in today.

76
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
You know, I couldn't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl.

77
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And you've all made these advancements happen in such a short time --

78
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
you're all so young.

79
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
You know, your parents must be very proud.

80
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
But I -- I also appreciate the diversity that you have here.

81
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I noticed it's very multicultural.

82
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
You know, when you're standing up here, you can see all the different people.

83
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's like a rainbow.

84
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It's okay to say rainbow. Yeah.

85
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I just -- I can't keep up with whether you can say, you know, the different things.

86
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
What are you allowed to say or not say?

87
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I just -- I don't want to offend anybody. You know.

88
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But anyway, you know,

89
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I just think that to be here with all of you

90
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
accomplished young people --

91
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
literally, some of you, the architects building our brighter future.

92
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
You know, it's heartening to me.

93
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Even though, quite frankly, some of your presentations are horrifying,

94
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
absolutely horrifying.

95
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's true. It's true.

96
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You know, between the environmental degradation

97
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and the crashing of the world markets you're talking about.

98
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And of course, we know it's all because of the -- all the ...

99
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Well, I don't know how else to say it to you, so I'll just say it my way:

100
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the, you know,

101
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the bankers and the Wall Street. You know it.

102
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Anyway.

103
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The point is, I'm happy somebody has practical ideas

105
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
to get us out of this mess.

106
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So I salute each of you and your stellar achievements.

107
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Thank you for all that you do.

108
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And congratulations on being such big makhers that you've become TED meisters.

109
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So, happy continued success.

110
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Congratulations. Mazel tov.

111
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
(Applause)

112
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Hi. Hi.

113
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Thank you everybody.

114
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Sorry, this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything, to be here right now.

115
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
My name is Noraida. And I'm just --

116
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I'm so thrilled to be part of like your TED conference

117
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that you're doing and everything like that.

118
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I am Dominican-American.

119
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Actually, you could say I grew up in the capital of Dominican Republic,

120
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
otherwise known as Washington Heights in New York City.

121
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But I don't know if there's any other Dominican people here,

122
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but I know that Juan Enriquez, he was here yesterday.

123
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And I think he's Mexican, so that's --

124
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
honestly, that's close enough for me right now. So --

125
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Laughter)

126
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I just -- I'm sorry.

127
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I'm just trying not to be nervous because this is

128
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
a very wonderful experience for me and everything.

129
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And I just -- you know I'm not used to doing the public speaking.

130
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And whenever I get nervous I start to talk really fast.

131
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Nobody can understand nothing I'm saying, which is very frustrating for me,

132
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
as you can imagine.

133
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath.

134
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
But then on top of that, you know, Sarah Jones told me we only have 18 minutes.

135
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So then I'm like, should I be nervous, you know, because maybe it's better.

136
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And I'm just trying not to panic and freak out. So I like, take a deep breath.

137
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Okay. Sorry. So anyway, what I was trying to say is that I really love TED.

138
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Like, I love everything about this. It's amazing.

139
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Like, it's -- I can't get over this right now.

140
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And, like, people would not believe, seriously, where I'm from,

141
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that this even exists.

142
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
You know, like even, I mean I love like the name, the -- TED.

143
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I mean I know it's a real person and everything, but I'm just saying that like,

144
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
you know, I think it's very cool how it's also an acronym, you know,

145
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
which is like, you know, is like very high concept and everything like that.

146
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I like that.

147
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And actually, I can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything.

148
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Because, actually, I'm a sophomore at college right now.

149
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
At my school -- actually I was part of co-founding an organization,

150
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
which is like a leadership thing,

151
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
you know, like you guys, you would really like it and everything.

152
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And the organization is called DA BOMB,

153
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
A\and DA BOMB -- not like what you guys can build and everything --

154
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
it's like, DA BOMB, it means like Dominican -- it's an acronym --

155
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies.

156
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So, I know, see, like the name is like a little bit long,

157
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
but with the war on terror and everything,

158
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the Dean of Student Activities has asked us to stop saying DA BOMB

159
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea, whatever.

160
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So, basically like DA BOMB --

161
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
what Dominican-American Benevolent Organization for Mothers and Babies does

162
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is, basically, we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise

163
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and who also happen to be mothers like me.

164
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I am a working mother, and I also go to school full-time.

165
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And, you know, it's like -- it's so important to have like role models out there.

166
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I mean, I know sometimes our lifestyles are very different, whatever.

167
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But like even at my job -- like, I just got promoted.

168
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Right now it's very exciting actually for me

169
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
because I'm the Junior Assistant to the Associate Director

170
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
under the Senior Vice President for Business Development --

171
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that's my new title.

172
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So, but I think whether you own your own company or you're just starting out like me,

173
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
like something like this is so vital

174
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning.

175
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And if everybody, like all people really had access to that,

176
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
it would be a very different world out there, as I know you know.

177
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So, I think all people, we need that,

178
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but especially, I look at people like me, you know like,

179
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I mean, Latinos -- we're about to be the majority, in like two weeks.

180
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So, we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else.

181
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So, I'm very happy that you're, you know, doing this kind of thing,

182
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
making the talks available online.

183
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
That's very good. I love that.

184
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And I just -- I love you guys. I love TED.

185
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And if you don't mind, privately now, in the future, I'm going to think of TED

186
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
as an acronym for Technology, Entertainment and Dominicans.

187
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Thank you very much.

188
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Laughter)

189
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
(Applause)

190
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So, that was Noraida,

191
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and just like Lorraine and everybody else you're meeting today,

192
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
these are folks who are based on real people from my real life:

193
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
friends, neighbors, family members.

194
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
I come from a multicultural family.

195
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
In fact, the older lady you just met:

196
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:06,000
very, very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother's side.

197
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's a long story, believe me.

198
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But on top of my family background,

199
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
my parents also sent me to the United Nations school,

200
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
where I encountered a plethora of new characters,

201
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
including Alexandre, my French teacher, okay.

202
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Well, you know, it was beginner French, that I am taking with her, you know.

203
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And it was Madame Bousson, you know, she was very [French].

204
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It was like, you know, she was there in the class,

205
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
you know, she was kind of typically French.

206
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
You know, she was very chic, but she was very filled with ennui, you know.

207
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And she would be there, you know, kind of talking with the class, you know,

208
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
talking about the, you know, the existential futility of life, you know.

209
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And we were only 11 years old, so it was not appropriate. (Laughter)

210
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
But [German].

211
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Yes, I took German for three years, [German],

212
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and it was quite the experience because I was the only black girl in the class,

213
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
even in the UN school.

214
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Although, you know, it was wonderful.

215
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
The teacher, Herr Schtopf, he never discriminated.

216
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Never. He always, always treated each of us,

217
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
you know, equally unbearably during the class.

218
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
So, there were the teachers and then there were my friends,

219
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
classmates from everywhere,

220
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
many of whom are still dear friends to this day.

221
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And they've inspired many characters as well.

222
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
For example, a friend of mine.

223
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Well, I just wanted to quickly say good evening.

224
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
My name is Praveen Manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity.

225
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Of course, TED, the reputation precedes itself all over the world.

226
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
But, you know, I am originally from India,

227
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and I wanted to start by telling you

228
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that once Sarah Jones told me that we will be having the opportunity

229
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
to come here to TED in California,

230
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
originally, I was very pleased and, frankly, relieved

231
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
because, you know, I am a human rights advocate.

232
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And usually my work, it takes me to Washington D.C.

233
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And there, I must attend these meetings, mingling with some tiresome politicians,

234
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
trying to make me feel comfortable

235
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
by telling how often they are eating the curry in Georgetown. (Laughter)

236
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So, you can just imagine -- right.

237
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So, but I'm thrilled to be joining all of you here.

238
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
I wish we had more time together, but that's for another time. Okay? Great.

239
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
(Applause)

240
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And, sadly, I don't think we'll have time for you to meet everybody I brought, but --

241
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I'm trying to behave myself,

242
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
it's my first time here.

243
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
But I do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize,

244
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
if you saw "Bridge and Tunnel."

245
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Uh, well, thank you.

246
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Good evening.

247
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
My name is Pauline Ning,

248
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and first I want to tell you that I'm --

249
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
of course I am a member of the Chinese community in New York.

250
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
But when Sarah Jones asked me to please come to TED,

251
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I said, well, you know, first, I don't know that, you know --

252
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
before two years ago, you would not find me in front of an audience of people,

253
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
much less like this

254
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
because I did not like to give speeches

255
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
because I feel that, as an immigrant, I do not have good English skills for speaking.

256
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
But then, I decided, just like Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,

257
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I try anyway.

258
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
(Laughter)

259
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
My daughter -- my daughter wrote that,

260
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:58,000
she told me, "Always start your speech with humor."

261
0:13:58.16,000 --> 0:14:,000
But my background --

262
0:14:00.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
I want to tell you story only briefly.

263
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
My husband and I, we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s

264
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
to have the freedom we cannot have in China at that time.

265
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition, but it's very hard.

266
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
You know, as immigrant, I would speak Chinese to them,

267
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and they would always answer me back in English.

268
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
They love rock music, pop culture, American culture.

269
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
But when they got older,

270
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
when the time comes for them to start think about getting married,

271
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
that's when we expect them to realize, a little bit more, their own culture.

272
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
But that's where we had some problems.

273
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
My son, he says he is not ready to get married.

274
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And he has a sweetheart, but she is American woman, not Chinese.

275
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
It's not that it's bad, but I told him, "What's wrong with a Chinese woman?"

276
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
But I think he will change his mind soon.

277
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So, then I decide instead, I will concentrate on my daughter.

278
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The daughter's marriage is very special to the mom.

279
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
But first, she said she's not interested.

280
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
She only wants to spend time with her friends.

281
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And then at college, it's like she never came home.

282
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And she doesn't want me to come and visit.

283
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
So I said, "What's wrong in this picture?"

284
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So, I accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend.

285
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
But she told me, "Mom, you don't have to worry about boys

286
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
because I don't like them."

287
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
(Laughter)

288
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
And I said, "Yes, men can be difficult, but all women have to get used to that."

289
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
She said, "No Mom. I mean, I don't like boys. I like girls.

290
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I am lesbian."

291
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
So, I always teach my kids to respect American ideas,

292
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
but I told my daughter that this is one exception --

293
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
(Laughter) --

294
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
that she is not gay, she is just confused by this American problem.

295
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
But she told me, "Mom, it's not American."

296
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
She said she is in love -- in love with a nice Chinese girl.

297
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
(Laughter)

298
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
So, these are the words I am waiting to hear,

299
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but from my son, not my daughter.

300
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
(Laughter)

301
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
But at first I did not know what to do.

302
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
But then, over time, I have come to understand that this is who she is.

303
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
So, even though sometimes it's still hard,

304
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
I will share with you that it helps me to realize

305
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
society is more tolerant, usually because of places like this,

306
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
because of ideas like this,

307
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and people like you, with an open mind.

308
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
So I think maybe TED, you impact people's lives

309
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
in the ways maybe even you don't realize.

310
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
So, for my daughter's sake,

311
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
I thank you for your ideas worth spreading.

312
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Thank you. Xie xie.

313
0:17:20.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
(Applause)

314
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Good evening. My name is Habbi Belahal.

315
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And I would like to first of all thank Sarah Jones

316
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
for putting all of the pressure on the only Arab who she brought with her

317
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
to be last today.

318
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
I am originally from Jordan.

319
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
And I teach comparative literature at Queens College.

320
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
It is not Harvard.

321
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
But I feel a bit like a fish out of water.

322
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:17:59,000
But I am very proud of my students.

323
0:17:59.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
And I see that a few of them did make it here to the conference.

324
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
So you will get the extra credit I promised you.

325
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
But, while I know that I may not look like the typical TED-izen, as you would say,

326
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:21,000
I do like to make the point that we in global society,

327
0:18:21.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
we are never as different as the appearances may suggest.

328
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
So, if you will indulge me, I will share quickly with you a bit of verse,

329
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
which I memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age.

330
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
So, back in the ancient times.

331
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:57,000
[Arabic]

332
0:18:57.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
And this roughly translates:

333
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
"Please, let me hold your hand.

334
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
I want to hold your hand.

335
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
I want to hold your hand.

336
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:12,000
And when I touch you, I feel happy inside.

337
0:19:12.16,000 --> 0:19:19,000
It's such a feeling that my love, I can't hide, I can't hide, I can't hide."

338
0:19:19.16,000 --> 0:19:27,000
Well, so okay, but please, please, but please.

339
0:19:27.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
If it is sounding familiar, it is because I was at the same time in my life

340
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:35,000
listening to the Beatles.

341
0:19:35.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
On the radio [unclear], they were very popular.

342
0:19:38.16,000 --> 0:19:44,000
So, all of that is to say that I like to believe

343
0:19:44.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another,

344
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:57,000
there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme.

345
0:19:57.16,000 --> 0:20:03,000
And I pray that this is the way that we will self-invent, in time.

346
0:20:03.16,000 --> 0:20:07,000
That's all, shukran. Thank you very much for the opportunity.

347
0:20:07.16,000 --> 0:20:09,000
Okay? Great.

348
0:20:09.16,000 --> 0:20:11,000
(Applause)

349
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:13,000
Thank you all very much. It was lovely.

350
0:20:13.16,000 --> 0:20:15,000
Thank you for having me.

351
0:20:15.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
(Applause)

352
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:22,000
Thank you very, very much. I love you.

353
0:20:22.16,000 --> 0:20:24,000
(Applause)

354
0:20:24.16,000 --> 0:20:28,000
Well, you have to let me say this.

355
0:20:28.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
I just -- thank you.

356
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:36,000
I want to thank Chris and Jacqueline, and just everyone for having me here.

357
0:20:36.16,000 --> 0:20:38,000
It's been a long time coming, and I feel like I'm home.

358
0:20:38.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
And I know I've performed for some of your companies

359
0:20:41.16,000 --> 0:20:43,000
or some of you have seen me elsewhere,

360
0:20:43.16,000 --> 0:20:46,000
but this is honestly one of the best audiences I've ever experienced.

361
0:20:46.16,000 --> 0:20:5,000
The whole thing is amazing, and so don't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon.

362
0:20:50.16,000 --> 0:20:53,000
(Applause)

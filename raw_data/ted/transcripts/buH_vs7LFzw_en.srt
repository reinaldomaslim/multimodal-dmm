1
0:00:12.294,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I've spent my life working on sustainability.

2
0:00:15.047,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I set up a climate change NGO

3
0:00:17.102,000 --> 0:00:18,000
called The Climate Group.

4
0:00:18.422,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I worked on forestry issues in WWF.

5
0:00:21.813,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I worked on development and agriculture issues

6
0:00:23.889,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in the U.N. system.

7
0:00:25.624,000 --> 0:00:26,000
About 25 years in total,

8
0:00:27.548,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and then three years ago, I found myself talking to

9
0:00:30.271,000 --> 0:00:33,000
IKEA's CEO about joining his team.

10
0:00:33.556,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Like many people here, well,

11
0:00:35.582,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I want to maximize my personal impact in the world,

12
0:00:39.517,000 --> 0:00:43,000
so I'm going to explain why I joined the team there.

13
0:00:44.203,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But first, let's just take three numbers.

14
0:00:47.01,000 --> 0:00:49,000
The first number is three:

15
0:00:49.081,000 --> 0:00:5,000
three billion people.

16
0:00:50.641,000 --> 0:00:51,000
This is the number of people joining

17
0:00:52.452,000 --> 0:00:54,000
the global middle class by 2030,

18
0:00:54.504,000 --> 0:00:55,000
coming out of poverty.

19
0:00:55.813,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It's fantastic for them and their families,

20
0:00:58.054,000 --> 0:01:01,000
but we've got two billion people in the global middle class today,

21
0:01:01.097,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and this swells that number to five,

22
0:01:03.394,000 --> 0:01:06,000
a big challenge when we already have resource scarcity.

23
0:01:06.724,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The second number is six:

24
0:01:08.601,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This is six degrees centigrade,

25
0:01:10.746,000 --> 0:01:12,000
what we're heading towards in terms of global warming.

26
0:01:13.31,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We're not heading towards one degree or three degrees

27
0:01:15.361,000 --> 0:01:17,000
or four degrees, we're heading toward six degrees.

28
0:01:17.709,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And if you think about it, all of the weird weather

29
0:01:20.398,000 --> 0:01:21,000
we've been having the last few years,

30
0:01:22.241,000 --> 0:01:24,000
much of that is due to just one degree warming,

31
0:01:24.823,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and we need CO2 emissions to peak

32
0:01:27.118,000 --> 0:01:29,000
by the end of this decade globally

33
0:01:29.35,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and then come down.

34
0:01:31.078,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's not inevitable, but we need to act decisively.

35
0:01:35.149,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The third number is 12:

36
0:01:36.91,000 --> 0:01:37,000
That's the number of cities in the world

37
0:01:38.403,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that had a million or more people

38
0:01:40.194,000 --> 0:01:41,000
when my grandmother was born.

39
0:01:41.627,000 --> 0:01:42,000
You can see my grandmother there.

40
0:01:43.247,000 --> 0:01:45,000
That was in the beginning of the last century.

41
0:01:45.29,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So just 12 cities. She was born in Manchester, England,

42
0:01:47.306,000 --> 0:01:49,000
the ninth largest city in the world.

43
0:01:49.327,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now there are 500 cities, nearly,

44
0:01:52.032,000 --> 0:01:54,000
with a million people or more in them.

45
0:01:54.463,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And if you look at the century from 1950 to 2050,

46
0:01:57.807,000 --> 0:02:,000
that's the century when we build all the world's cities,

47
0:02:01.551,000 --> 0:02:03,000
the century that we're in the middle of right now.

48
0:02:03.961,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Every other century was kind of practice,

49
0:02:06.807,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and this lays down a blueprint for how we live.

50
0:02:11.625,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So think about it.

51
0:02:13.38,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We're building cities like never before,

52
0:02:16.15,000 --> 0:02:18,000
bringing people out of poverty like never before,

53
0:02:18.676,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and changing the climate like never before.

54
0:02:21.051,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Sustainability has gone from a nice-to-do

55
0:02:24.111,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to a must-do.

56
0:02:25.776,000 --> 0:02:27,000
it's about what we do right here, right now,

57
0:02:28.609,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and for the rest of our working lives.

58
0:02:32.29,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So I'm going to talk a little bit about

59
0:02:34.322,000 --> 0:02:35,000
what business can do

60
0:02:35.695,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and what a business like IKEA can do,

61
0:02:37.997,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and we have a sustainability strategy

62
0:02:40.664,000 --> 0:02:41,000
called "people and planet positive"

63
0:02:42.661,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to help guide our business to have a positive impact on the world.

64
0:02:46.308,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Why would we not want to have a positive impact

65
0:02:48.443,000 --> 0:02:5,000
on the world as a business?

66
0:02:51.031,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Other companies have sustainability strategies.

67
0:02:53.519,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I'm going to refer to some of those as well,

68
0:02:55.357,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and I'm just going to mention a few

69
0:02:56.894,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of the commitments as illustrations that we've got.

70
0:02:59.49,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But first, let's think of customers.

71
0:03:01.506,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We know from asking people from China to the U.S.

72
0:03:05.331,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that the vast majority of people care about sustainability

73
0:03:08.659,000 --> 0:03:09,000
after the day-to-day issues,

74
0:03:10.541,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the day-to-day issues of, how do I get my kids to school?

75
0:03:13.118,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Can I pay the bills at the end of the month?

76
0:03:15.097,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Then they care about big issues like climate change.

77
0:03:18.559,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But they want it to be easy, affordable and attractive,

78
0:03:22.991,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and they expect business to help,

79
0:03:24.983,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and they're a little bit disappointed today.

80
0:03:27.777,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So take your mind back and think

81
0:03:30.411,000 --> 0:03:31,000
of the first sustainable products.

82
0:03:31.998,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We had detergents that could wash your whites grayer.

83
0:03:35.911,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We had the early energy-efficient light bulbs

84
0:03:38.965,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that took five minutes to warm up

85
0:03:40.812,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and then you were left looking a kind of sickly color.

86
0:03:43.883,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And we had the rough, recycled toilet paper.

87
0:03:47.251,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So every time you pulled on a t-shirt,

88
0:03:49.983,000 --> 0:03:51,000
or switched the light on, or went to the bathroom,

89
0:03:52.089,000 --> 0:03:53,000
or sometimes all three together,

90
0:03:53.758,000 --> 0:03:56,000
you were reminded sustainability was about compromise.

91
0:03:57.203,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It wasn't a great start.

92
0:04:00.101,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Today we have choices.

93
0:04:02.389,000 --> 0:04:05,000
We can make products that are beautiful or ugly,

94
0:04:05.686,000 --> 0:04:09,000
sustainable or unsustainable, affordable or expensive,

95
0:04:10.487,000 --> 0:04:11,000
functional or useless.

96
0:04:12.35,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So let's make beautiful, functional, affordable,

97
0:04:15.215,000 --> 0:04:17,000
sustainable products.

98
0:04:17.535,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Let's take the LED.

99
0:04:19.831,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The LED is the next best thing to daylight.

100
0:04:23.245,000 --> 0:04:26,000
The old-fashioned lightbulbs, the incandescent bulbs --

101
0:04:26.426,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I'm not going to ask for a show of hands

102
0:04:27.934,000 --> 0:04:29,000
of how many of you still have them in your homes,

103
0:04:30.223,000 --> 0:04:32,000
wasting energy every time you switch them on --

104
0:04:33.045,000 --> 0:04:34,000
change them after this --

105
0:04:34.482,000 --> 0:04:37,000
or whether we have them on the stage here at TED or not --

106
0:04:38.175,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but those old incandescent light bulbs

107
0:04:41.966,000 --> 0:04:44,000
really should have been sold as heaters.

108
0:04:44.988,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They were mis-sold for more than a hundred years.

109
0:04:46.965,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They produced heat and a little bit of light on the side.

110
0:04:49.407,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Now we have lights that produce light

111
0:04:51.479,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and a little bit of heat on the side.

112
0:04:53.171,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You save 85 percent of the electricity with an LED

113
0:04:55.997,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that you would have done in an old incandescent.

114
0:04:58.04,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And the best thing is, they'll also last

115
0:04:59.775,000 --> 0:05:,000
for more than 20 years.

116
0:05:01.354,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So think about that.

117
0:05:02.61,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You'll change your smartphone seven or eight times,

118
0:05:05.106,000 --> 0:05:07,000
probably more if you're in this audience.

119
0:05:07.182,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You'll change your car, if you have one, three or four times.

120
0:05:09.792,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Your kids could go to school, go to college,

121
0:05:12.344,000 --> 0:05:13,000
go away and have kids of their own, come back,

122
0:05:14.299,000 --> 0:05:15,000
bring the grandkids,

123
0:05:15.725,000 --> 0:05:18,000
you'll have the same lightbulb saving you energy.

124
0:05:19.611,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So LEDs are fantastic.

125
0:05:22.45,000 --> 0:05:23,000
What we decided to do

126
0:05:23.976,000 --> 0:05:25,000
was not to sell LEDs on the side marked up high

127
0:05:26.929,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and continue to push all the old bulbs,

128
0:05:29.155,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the halogens and the CFLs.

129
0:05:31.146,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We decided, over the next two years,

130
0:05:34.076,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we will ban the halogens and the CFLs ourselves.

131
0:05:36.591,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We will go all in.

132
0:05:37.959,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And this is what business needs to do: go all-in,

133
0:05:39.668,000 --> 0:05:4,000
go 100 percent,

134
0:05:41.112,000 --> 0:05:42,000
because then you stop investing in the old stuff,

135
0:05:42.703,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you invest in the new stuff, you lower costs,

136
0:05:44.857,000 --> 0:05:46,000
you use your supply chain and your creativity

137
0:05:47.186,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and you get the prices down so everybody can afford

138
0:05:49.943,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the best lights so they can save energy.

139
0:05:52.894,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Applause)

140
0:05:57.044,000 --> 0:06:,000
It's not just about products in people's homes.

141
0:06:00.173,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We've got to think about the raw materials

142
0:06:01.817,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that produce our products.

143
0:06:03.999,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Obviously there's fantastic opportunities

144
0:06:05.826,000 --> 0:06:06,000
with recycled materials,

145
0:06:07.32,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and we can and will go zero waste.

146
0:06:10.163,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And there's opportunities in a circular economy.

147
0:06:12.151,000 --> 0:06:15,000
But we're still dependent on natural, raw materials.

148
0:06:15.593,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Let's take cotton.

149
0:06:17.383,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Cotton's brilliant. Probably many people

150
0:06:19.112,000 --> 0:06:2,000
are wearing cotton right now.

151
0:06:20.523,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It's a brilliant textile in use.

152
0:06:22.057,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's really dirty in production.

153
0:06:23.624,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It uses lots of pesticides, lots of fertilizer, lots of water.

154
0:06:27.758,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So we've worked with others,

155
0:06:29.378,000 --> 0:06:3,000
with other businesses and NGOs,

156
0:06:30.98,000 --> 0:06:31,000
on the Better Cotton Initiative,

157
0:06:32.836,000 --> 0:06:34,000
working right back down to the farm,

158
0:06:35.005,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and there you can halve the amount of water

159
0:06:36.84,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and halve the chemical inputs,

160
0:06:38.671,000 --> 0:06:4,000
the yields increase, and 60 percent of the costs

161
0:06:41.567,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of running many of these farms

162
0:06:43.236,000 --> 0:06:45,000
with farmers with low incomes

163
0:06:45.28,000 --> 0:06:46,000
can be chemical imports.

164
0:06:46.983,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Yields increase, and you halve the input costs.

165
0:06:49.128,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Farmers are coming out of poverty. They love it.

166
0:06:52.003,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Already hundreds of thousands of farmers

167
0:06:53.73,000 --> 0:06:54,000
have been reached,

168
0:06:55.32,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and now we've got 60 percent better cotton in our business.

169
0:06:57.984,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Again, we're going all-in.

170
0:06:59.326,000 --> 0:07:02,000
By 2015, we'll be 100 percent Better Cotton.

171
0:07:02.476,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Take the topic of 100 percent targets, actually.

172
0:07:05.462,000 --> 0:07:06,000
People sometimes think that

173
0:07:07.134,000 --> 0:07:08,000
100 percent's going to be hard,

174
0:07:08.599,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and we've had the conversation in the business.

175
0:07:10.37,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Actually, we found 100 percent is easier to do

176
0:07:12.212,000 --> 0:07:13,000
than 90 percent or 50 percent.

177
0:07:14.199,000 --> 0:07:15,000
If you have a 90 percent target,

178
0:07:15.631,000 --> 0:07:16,000
everyone in the business finds a reason

179
0:07:17.052,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to be in the 10 percent.

180
0:07:18.857,000 --> 0:07:21,000
When it's 100 percent, it's kind of clear,

181
0:07:22.427,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and businesspeople like clarity,

182
0:07:25.317,000 --> 0:07:27,000
because then you just get the job done.

183
0:07:27.982,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So, wood. We know with forestry, it's a choice.

184
0:07:30.73,000 --> 0:07:31,000
You've got illegal logging

185
0:07:32.324,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and deforestation still on a very large scale,

186
0:07:35.149,000 --> 0:07:37,000
or you can have fantastic, responsible forestry

187
0:07:37.849,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that we can be proud of.

188
0:07:39.984,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's a simple choice, so we've worked

189
0:07:42.066,000 --> 0:07:44,000
for many years with the Forest Stewardship Council,

190
0:07:44.61,000 --> 0:07:46,000
with literally hundreds of other organizations,

191
0:07:46.98,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and there's a point here about collaboration.

192
0:07:49.42,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So hundreds of others, of NGOs,

193
0:07:51.315,000 --> 0:07:53,000
of forest workers' unions, and of businesses,

194
0:07:53.897,000 --> 0:07:54,000
have helped create the Forest Stewardship Council,

195
0:07:55.569,000 --> 0:07:56,000
which sets standards for forestry

196
0:07:57.351,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and then checks the forestry's good on the ground.

197
0:07:59.873,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Now together, through our supply chain,

198
0:08:02.116,000 --> 0:08:03,000
with partners, we've managed to certify

199
0:08:03.983,000 --> 0:08:05,000
35 million hectares of forestry.

200
0:08:06.86,000 --> 0:08:08,000
That's about the size of Germany.

201
0:08:09.397,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And we've decided in the next three years,

202
0:08:11.185,000 --> 0:08:13,000
we will double the volume of certified material

203
0:08:13.22,000 --> 0:08:15,000
we put through our business.

204
0:08:15.358,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So be decisive on these issues.

205
0:08:17.998,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Use your supply chain to drive good.

206
0:08:19.969,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But then it comes to your operations.

207
0:08:21.995,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Some things are certain, I think.

208
0:08:24.645,000 --> 0:08:27,000
We know we'll use electricity in 20 or 30 years' time.

209
0:08:27.66,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We know the sun will be shining somewhere,

210
0:08:30.583,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and the wind will still be blowing in 20 or 30 years' time.

211
0:08:33.675,000 --> 0:08:35,000
So why not make our energy out of the sun and the wind?

212
0:08:36.327,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And why not take control of it ourselves?

213
0:08:38.555,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So we're going 100 percent renewable.

214
0:08:40.915,000 --> 0:08:42,000
By 2020, we'll produce more renewable energy

215
0:08:43.671,000 --> 0:08:45,000
than the energy we consume as a business.

216
0:08:45.691,000 --> 0:08:46,000
For all of our stores, our own factories,

217
0:08:47.667,000 --> 0:08:48,000
our distribution centers,

218
0:08:49.045,000 --> 0:08:51,000
we've installed 300,000 solar panels so far,

219
0:08:51.499,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and we've got 14 wind farms we own and operate

220
0:08:54.873,000 --> 0:08:56,000
in six countries, and we're not done yet.

221
0:08:57.5,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But think of a solar panel.

222
0:08:59.284,000 --> 0:09:01,000
A solar panel pays for itself in seven or eight years.

223
0:09:01.463,000 --> 0:09:02,000
The electricity is free.

224
0:09:02.956,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Every time the sun comes out after that,

225
0:09:04.761,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the electricity is free.

226
0:09:06.196,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So this is a good thing for the CFO,

227
0:09:08.213,000 --> 0:09:09,000
not just the sustainability guy.

228
0:09:10.156,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Every business can do things like this.

229
0:09:13.19,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But then we've got to look beyond our operations,

230
0:09:16.169,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and I think everybody would agree

231
0:09:17.918,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that now business has to take full responsibility

232
0:09:20.29,000 --> 0:09:22,000
for the impacts of your supply chain.

233
0:09:22.494,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Many businesses now, fortunately,

234
0:09:24.81,000 --> 0:09:26,000
have codes of conduct and audit their supply chains,

235
0:09:26.817,000 --> 0:09:28,000
but not every business. Far from it.

236
0:09:28.863,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And this came in IKEA actually in the '90s.

237
0:09:31.377,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We found there was a risk

238
0:09:33.118,000 --> 0:09:35,000
of child labor in the supply chain,

239
0:09:35.12,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and people in the business were shocked.

240
0:09:37.63,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And it was clearly totally unacceptable, so then you have to act.

241
0:09:40.954,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So a code of conduct was developed,

242
0:09:43.098,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and now we have 80 auditors out in the world

243
0:09:46.049,000 --> 0:09:48,000
every day making sure all our factories

244
0:09:48.08,000 --> 0:09:5,000
secure good working conditions

245
0:09:50.364,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and protect human rights

246
0:09:51.913,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and make sure there is no child labor.

247
0:09:54.174,000 --> 0:09:56,000
But it's not just as simple as making sure

248
0:09:56.334,000 --> 0:09:58,000
there's no child labor.

249
0:09:58.366,000 --> 0:10:,000
You've got to say that's not enough today.

250
0:10:00.566,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I think we'd all agree that children

251
0:10:02.614,000 --> 0:10:04,000
are the most important people in the world

252
0:10:04.81,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and the most vulnerable.

253
0:10:06.707,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So what can a business do today

254
0:10:08.955,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to actually use your total value chain

255
0:10:10.839,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to support a better quality of life

256
0:10:13.118,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and protect child rights?

257
0:10:14.706,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We've worked with UNICEF and Save the Children

258
0:10:17.003,000 --> 0:10:19,000
on developing some new business principles

259
0:10:19.478,000 --> 0:10:2,000
with children's rights.

260
0:10:20.943,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Increasing numbers of businesses

261
0:10:22.76,000 --> 0:10:23,000
are signing up to these,

262
0:10:24.28,000 --> 0:10:26,000
but actually in a survey, many business leaders

263
0:10:26.743,000 --> 0:10:28,000
said they thought their business had nothing to do with children.

264
0:10:29.61,000 --> 0:10:32,000
So what we decided to do was, we will look

265
0:10:33.109,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and ask ourselves the tough questions

266
0:10:34.67,000 --> 0:10:36,000
with partners who know more than us,

267
0:10:36.734,000 --> 0:10:38,000
what can we do to go beyond our business

268
0:10:39.691,000 --> 0:10:4,000
to help improve the lives of children?

269
0:10:41.533,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We also have a foundation

270
0:10:43.352,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that's committed to work through partners

271
0:10:45.247,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and help improve the lives and protect the rights

272
0:10:47.87,000 --> 0:10:49,000
of 100 million children by 2015.

273
0:10:50.737,000 --> 0:10:51,000
You know the phrase,

274
0:10:52.413,000 --> 0:10:55,000
you can manage what you measure?

275
0:10:55.791,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Well, you should measure what you care about.

276
0:11:00.441,000 --> 0:11:01,000
If you're not measuring things,

277
0:11:01.99,000 --> 0:11:03,000
you don't care and you don't know.

278
0:11:04.734,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So let's take an example, measure the things

279
0:11:06.903,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that are important in your business.

280
0:11:09.06,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Isn't it about time that businesses

281
0:11:11.343,000 --> 0:11:13,000
were led equally by men and women?

282
0:11:14.321,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Applause)

283
0:11:17.304,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So we know for our 17,000 managers across IKEA

284
0:11:22.446,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that 47 percent are women today,

285
0:11:25.41,000 --> 0:11:27,000
but it's not enough, and we want to close the gap

286
0:11:27.806,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and follow it all the way through to senior management.

287
0:11:30.093,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And we do not want to wait another hundred years.

288
0:11:32.939,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So we've launched a women's open network

289
0:11:35.898,000 --> 0:11:36,000
this week in IKEA,

290
0:11:37.423,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and we'll do whatever it takes to lead the change.

291
0:11:39.599,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So the message here is,

292
0:11:41.014,000 --> 0:11:43,000
measure what you care about and lead the change,

293
0:11:43.398,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and don't wait a hundred years.

294
0:11:46.401,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So we've gone from sustainability

295
0:11:48.838,000 --> 0:11:53,000
being a nice-to-do to a must-do. It's a must-do.

296
0:11:54.074,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It's still nice to do, but it's a must-do.

297
0:11:57.226,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And everybody can do something on this as an individual.

298
0:12:02.161,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Be a discerning consumer.

299
0:12:04.357,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Vote with your wallets.

300
0:12:06.055,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Search out the companies

301
0:12:08.235,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that are acting on this.

302
0:12:10.93,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But also, there are other businesses already acting.

303
0:12:13.977,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I mentioned renewable energy.

304
0:12:16.122,000 --> 0:12:18,000
You go to Google or Lego,

305
0:12:18.44,000 --> 0:12:2,000
they're going 100 percent renewable too,

306
0:12:20.7,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in the same way that we are.

307
0:12:22.067,000 --> 0:12:25,000
On having really good sustainability strategies,

308
0:12:25.193,000 --> 0:12:28,000
there are companies like Nike, Patagonia,

309
0:12:28.437,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Timberland, Marks & Spencer.

310
0:12:30.591,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But I don't think any of those businesses would say

311
0:12:32.749,000 --> 0:12:34,000
they're perfect. We certainly wouldn't.

312
0:12:35.014,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We'll make mistakes going forward,

313
0:12:37.38,000 --> 0:12:39,000
but it's about setting a clear direction, being transparent,

314
0:12:39.897,000 --> 0:12:4,000
having a dialogue with the right partners,

315
0:12:41.586,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and choosing to lead on the issues that really count.

316
0:12:46.102,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So if you're a business leader,

317
0:12:48.901,000 --> 0:12:5,000
if you're not already weaving sustainability

318
0:12:51.856,000 --> 0:12:53,000
right into the heart of your business model,

319
0:12:54.264,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I'd urge you to do so.

320
0:12:56.155,000 --> 0:12:57,000
And together, we can help create

321
0:12:58.13,000 --> 0:13:,000
a sustainable world,

322
0:13:00.13,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and, if we get it right,

323
0:13:02.259,000 --> 0:13:03,000
we can make sustainability

324
0:13:03.748,000 --> 0:13:04,000
affordable for the many people,

325
0:13:05.37,000 --> 0:13:06,000
not a luxury for the few.

326
0:13:07.067,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Thank you.

327
0:13:08.424,000 --> 0:13:12,000

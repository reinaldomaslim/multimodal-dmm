1
0:00:13.571,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Every summer when I was growing up,

2
0:00:15.61,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I would fly from my home in Canada to visit my grandparents,

3
0:00:19.016,000 --> 0:00:2,000
who lived in Mumbai, India.

4
0:00:21.157,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Now, Canadian summers are pretty mild at best --

5
0:00:24.315,000 --> 0:00:27,000
about 22 degrees Celsius or 72 degrees Fahrenheit

6
0:00:28.046,000 --> 0:00:3,000
is a typical summer's day, and not too hot.

7
0:00:31.276,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Mumbai, on the other hand, is a hot and humid place

8
0:00:34.339,000 --> 0:00:37,000
well into the 30s Celsius or 90s Fahrenheit.

9
0:00:38.364,000 --> 0:00:39,000
As soon as I'd reach it, I'd ask,

10
0:00:39.974,000 --> 0:00:43,000
"How could anyone live, work or sleep in such weather?"

11
0:00:45.539,000 --> 0:00:48,000
To make things worse, my grandparents didn't have an air conditioner.

12
0:00:49.768,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And while I tried my very, very best,

13
0:00:52.617,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was never able to persuade them to get one.

14
0:00:56.22,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But this is changing, and fast.

15
0:00:59.914,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Cooling systems today collectively account for 17 percent

16
0:01:04.279,000 --> 0:01:06,000
of the electricity we use worldwide.

17
0:01:06.676,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This includes everything from the air conditioners

18
0:01:09.094,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I so desperately wanted during my summer vacations,

19
0:01:11.895,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to the refrigeration systems that keep our food safe and cold for us

20
0:01:15.529,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in our supermarkets,

21
0:01:16.784,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to the industrial scale systems that keep our data centers operational.

22
0:01:21.624,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Collectively, these systems account for eight percent

23
0:01:25.133,000 --> 0:01:27,000
of global greenhouse gas emissions.

24
0:01:27.823,000 --> 0:01:28,000
But what keeps me up at night

25
0:01:29.458,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is that our energy use for cooling might grow sixfold by the year 2050,

26
0:01:34.403,000 --> 0:01:38,000
primarily driven by increasing usage in Asian and African countries.

27
0:01:39.284,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I've seen this firsthand.

28
0:01:41.006,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Nearly every apartment in and around my grandmother's place

29
0:01:44.188,000 --> 0:01:46,000
now has an air conditioner.

30
0:01:46.236,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And that is, emphatically, a good thing

31
0:01:49.307,000 --> 0:01:51,000
for the health, well-being and productivity

32
0:01:52.03,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of people living in warmer climates.

33
0:01:55.831,000 --> 0:01:58,000
However, one of the most alarming things about climate change

34
0:01:59.798,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is that the warmer our planet gets,

35
0:02:02.417,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the more we're going to need cooling systems --

36
0:02:04.753,000 --> 0:02:07,000
systems that are themselves large emitters of greenhouse gas emissions.

37
0:02:09.236,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This then has the potential to cause a feedback loop,

38
0:02:12.593,000 --> 0:02:13,000
where cooling systems alone

39
0:02:14.075,000 --> 0:02:16,000
could become one of our biggest sources of greenhouse gases

40
0:02:17.086,000 --> 0:02:18,000
later this century.

41
0:02:18.735,000 --> 0:02:19,000
In the worst case,

42
0:02:19.937,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we might need more than 10 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity every year,

43
0:02:23.581,000 --> 0:02:25,000
just for cooling, by the year 2100.

44
0:02:26.846,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That's half our electricity supply today.

45
0:02:30.198,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Just for cooling.

46
0:02:32.862,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But this also point us to an amazing opportunity.

47
0:02:37.444,000 --> 0:02:41,000
A 10 or 20 percent improvement in the efficiency of every cooling system

48
0:02:42.037,000 --> 0:02:45,000
could actually have an enormous impact on our greenhouse gas emissions,

49
0:02:45.545,000 --> 0:02:47,000
both today and later this century.

50
0:02:50.08,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And it could help us avert that worst-case feedback loop.

51
0:02:54.928,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I'm a scientist who thinks a lot about light and heat.

52
0:02:58.632,000 --> 0:03:01,000
In particular, how new materials allow us to alter the flow

53
0:03:02.252,000 --> 0:03:04,000
of these basic elements of nature

54
0:03:04.292,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in ways we might have once thought impossible.

55
0:03:07.315,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So, while I always understood the value of cooling

56
0:03:09.752,000 --> 0:03:1,000
during my summer vacations,

57
0:03:11.72,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I actually wound up working on this problem

58
0:03:14.007,000 --> 0:03:18,000
because of an intellectual puzzle that I came across about six years ago.

59
0:03:19.149,000 --> 0:03:24,000
How were ancient peoples able to make ice in desert climates?

60
0:03:25.894,000 --> 0:03:27,000
This is a picture of an ice house,

61
0:03:28.854,000 --> 0:03:31,000
also called a Yakhchal, located in the southwest of Iran.

62
0:03:33.006,000 --> 0:03:36,000
There are ruins of dozens of such structures throughout Iran,

63
0:03:36.784,000 --> 0:03:39,000
with evidence of similar such buildings throughout the rest of the Middle East

64
0:03:40.498,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and all the way to China.

65
0:03:42.228,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The people who operated this ice house many centuries ago,

66
0:03:45.442,000 --> 0:03:47,000
would pour water in the pool you see on the left

67
0:03:47.95,000 --> 0:03:5,000
in the early evening hours, as the sun set.

68
0:03:51.046,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And then something amazing happened.

69
0:03:53.442,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Even though the air temperature might be above freezing,

70
0:03:56.228,000 --> 0:03:59,000
say five degrees Celsius or 41 degrees Fahrenheit,

71
0:03:59.95,000 --> 0:04:,000
the water would freeze.

72
0:04:02.724,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The ice generated would then be collected in the early morning hours

73
0:04:06.883,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and stored for use in the building you see on the right,

74
0:04:09.542,000 --> 0:04:1,000
all the way through the summer months.

75
0:04:12.133,000 --> 0:04:14,000
You've actually likely seen something very similar at play

76
0:04:14.876,000 --> 0:04:17,000
if you've ever noticed frost form on the ground on a clear night,

77
0:04:18.352,000 --> 0:04:2,000
even when the air temperature is well above freezing.

78
0:04:21.121,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But wait.

79
0:04:22.305,000 --> 0:04:25,000
How did the water freeze if the air temperature is above freezing?

80
0:04:26.487,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Evaporation could have played an effect,

81
0:04:28.437,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but that's not enough to actually cause the water to become ice.

82
0:04:32.064,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Something else must have cooled it down.

83
0:04:34.761,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Think about a pie cooling on a window sill.

84
0:04:37.619,000 --> 0:04:4,000
For it to be able to cool down, its heat needs to flow somewhere cooler.

85
0:04:41.254,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Namely, the air that surrounds it.

86
0:04:44.18,000 --> 0:04:46,000
As implausible as it may sound,

87
0:04:46.514,000 --> 0:04:51,000
for that pool of water, its heat is actually flowing to the cold of space.

88
0:04:54.085,000 --> 0:04:55,000
How is this possible?

89
0:04:56.434,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Well, that pool of water, like most natural materials,

90
0:05:00.03,000 --> 0:05:02,000
sends out its heat as light.

91
0:05:02.506,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This is a concept known as thermal radiation.

92
0:05:05.792,000 --> 0:05:09,000
In fact, we're all sending out our heat as infrared light right now,

93
0:05:10.284,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to each other and our surroundings.

94
0:05:12.608,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We can actually visualize this with thermal cameras

95
0:05:15.101,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and the images they produce, like the ones I'm showing you right now.

96
0:05:18.744,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So that pool of water is sending out its heat

97
0:05:21.03,000 --> 0:05:22,000
upward towards the atmosphere.

98
0:05:23.379,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The atmosphere and the molecules in it

99
0:05:25.498,000 --> 0:05:27,000
absorb some of that heat and send it back.

100
0:05:28.077,000 --> 0:05:31,000
That's actually the greenhouse effect that's responsible for climate change.

101
0:05:32.435,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But here's the critical thing to understand.

102
0:05:34.982,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Our atmosphere doesn't absorb all of that heat.

103
0:05:38.577,000 --> 0:05:4,000
If it did, we'd be on a much warmer planet.

104
0:05:41.982,000 --> 0:05:42,000
At certain wavelengths,

105
0:05:43.514,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in particular between eight and 13 microns,

106
0:05:46.99,000 --> 0:05:49,000
our atmosphere has what's known as a transmission window.

107
0:05:51.402,000 --> 0:05:56,000
This window allows some of the heat that goes up as infrared light

108
0:05:56.943,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to effectively escape, carrying away that pool's heat.

109
0:06:00.895,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And it can escape to a place that is much, much colder.

110
0:06:05.633,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The cold of this upper atmosphere

111
0:06:07.625,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and all the way out to outer space,

112
0:06:09.323,000 --> 0:06:12,000
which can be as cold as minus 270 degrees Celsius,

113
0:06:13.157,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or minus 454 degrees Fahrenheit.

114
0:06:17.242,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So that pool of water is able to send out more heat to the sky

115
0:06:20.63,000 --> 0:06:21,000
than the sky sends back to it.

116
0:06:22.425,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And because of that,

117
0:06:23.599,000 --> 0:06:26,000
the pool will cool down below its surroundings' temperature.

118
0:06:28.035,000 --> 0:06:31,000
This is an effect known as night-sky cooling

119
0:06:31.575,000 --> 0:06:32,000
or radiative cooling.

120
0:06:33.369,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And it's always been understood by climate scientists and meteorologists

121
0:06:36.847,000 --> 0:06:38,000
as a very important natural phenomenon.

122
0:06:40.879,000 --> 0:06:41,000
When I came across all of this,

123
0:06:42.395,000 --> 0:06:44,000
it was towards the end of my PhD at Stanford.

124
0:06:45.061,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And I was amazed by its apparent simplicity as a cooling method,

125
0:06:49.514,000 --> 0:06:5,000
yet really puzzled.

126
0:06:51.284,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Why aren't we making use of this?

127
0:06:54.744,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now, scientists and engineers had investigated this idea

128
0:06:57.649,000 --> 0:06:58,000
in previous decades.

129
0:06:58.911,000 --> 0:07:01,000
But there turned out to be at least one big problem.

130
0:07:02.879,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It was called night-sky cooling for a reason.

131
0:07:06.109,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Why?

132
0:07:07.307,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Well, it's a little thing called the sun.

133
0:07:10.157,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So, for the surface that's doing the cooling,

134
0:07:12.641,000 --> 0:07:14,000
it needs to be able to face the sky.

135
0:07:14.839,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And during the middle of the day,

136
0:07:16.491,000 --> 0:07:19,000
when we might want something cold the most,

137
0:07:19.665,000 --> 0:07:21,000
unfortunately, that means you're going to look up to the sun.

138
0:07:22.585,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And the sun heats most materials up

139
0:07:24.465,000 --> 0:07:26,000
enough to completely counteract this cooling effect.

140
0:07:28.409,000 --> 0:07:3,000
My colleagues and I spend a lot of our time

141
0:07:30.441,000 --> 0:07:32,000
thinking about how we can structure materials

142
0:07:32.577,000 --> 0:07:33,000
at very small length scales

143
0:07:34.013,000 --> 0:07:37,000
such that they can do new and useful things with light --

144
0:07:37.363,000 --> 0:07:39,000
length scales smaller than the wavelength of light itself.

145
0:07:40.377,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Using insights from this field,

146
0:07:41.981,000 --> 0:07:44,000
known as nanophotonics or metamaterials research,

147
0:07:45.133,000 --> 0:07:48,000
we realized that there might be a way to make this possible during the day

148
0:07:48.657,000 --> 0:07:49,000
for the first time.

149
0:07:49.854,000 --> 0:07:52,000
To do this, I designed a multilayer optical material

150
0:07:52.934,000 --> 0:07:53,000
shown here in a microscope image.

151
0:07:54.815,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It's more than 40 times thinner than a typical human hair.

152
0:07:58.22,000 --> 0:08:,000
And it's able to do two things simultaneously.

153
0:08:01.169,000 --> 0:08:02,000
First, it sends its heat out

154
0:08:03.018,000 --> 0:08:06,000
precisely where our atmosphere lets that heat out the best.

155
0:08:06.844,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We targeted the window to space.

156
0:08:09.519,000 --> 0:08:12,000
The second thing it does is it avoids getting heated up by the sun.

157
0:08:12.974,000 --> 0:08:14,000
It's a very good mirror to sunlight.

158
0:08:16.315,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The first time I tested this was on a rooftop in Stanford

159
0:08:19.053,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that I'm showing you right here.

160
0:08:21.339,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I left the device out for a little while,

161
0:08:23.744,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and I walked up to it after a few minutes,

162
0:08:26.839,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and within seconds, I knew it was working.

163
0:08:29.657,000 --> 0:08:3,000
How?

164
0:08:30.839,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I touched it, and it felt cold.

165
0:08:33.395,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Applause)

166
0:08:38.862,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Just to emphasize how weird and counterintuitive this is:

167
0:08:42.87,000 --> 0:08:43,000
this material and others like it

168
0:08:44.624,000 --> 0:08:46,000
will get colder when we take them out of the shade,

169
0:08:47.553,000 --> 0:08:49,000
even though the sun is shining on it.

170
0:08:49.937,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I'm showing you data here from our very first experiment,

171
0:08:52.644,000 --> 0:08:54,000
where that material stayed more than five degrees Celsius,

172
0:08:55.407,000 --> 0:08:58,000
or nine degrees Fahrenheit, colder than the air temperature,

173
0:08:58.707,000 --> 0:09:,000
even though the sun was shining directly on it.

174
0:09:02.855,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The manufacturing method we used to actually make this material

175
0:09:06.014,000 --> 0:09:08,000
already exists at large volume scales.

176
0:09:08.903,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So I was really excited,

177
0:09:10.084,000 --> 0:09:13,000
because not only do we make something cool,

178
0:09:13.149,000 --> 0:09:18,000
but we might actually have the opportunity to do something real and make it useful.

179
0:09:19.204,000 --> 0:09:2,000
That brings me to the next big question.

180
0:09:21.141,000 --> 0:09:23,000
How do you actually save energy with this idea?

181
0:09:23.752,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Well, we believe the most direct way to save energy with this technology

182
0:09:27.434,000 --> 0:09:28,000
is as an efficiency boost

183
0:09:29.117,000 --> 0:09:32,000
for today's air-conditioning and refrigeration systems.

184
0:09:32.561,000 --> 0:09:34,000
To do this, we've built fluid cooling panels,

185
0:09:34.744,000 --> 0:09:35,000
like the ones shown right here.

186
0:09:36.339,000 --> 0:09:38,000
These panels have a similar shape to solar water heaters,

187
0:09:39.03,000 --> 0:09:41,000
except they do the opposite -- they cool the water, passively,

188
0:09:41.974,000 --> 0:09:43,000
using our specialized material.

189
0:09:44.815,000 --> 0:09:46,000
These panels can then be integrated with a component

190
0:09:47.299,000 --> 0:09:49,000
almost every cooling system has, called a condenser,

191
0:09:49.891,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to improve the system's underlying efficiency.

192
0:09:53.367,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Our start-up, SkyCool Systems,

193
0:09:55.287,000 --> 0:09:58,000
has recently completed a field trial in Davis, California, shown right here.

194
0:09:59.649,000 --> 0:10:,000
In that demonstration,

195
0:10:00.855,000 --> 0:10:03,000
we showed that we could actually improve the efficiency

196
0:10:03.927,000 --> 0:10:05,000
of that cooling system as much as 12 percent in the field.

197
0:10:07.474,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Over the next year or two,

198
0:10:08.752,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I'm super excited to see this go to its first commercial-scale pilots

199
0:10:12.68,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in both the air conditioning and refrigeration space.

200
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
In the future, we might be able to integrate these kinds of panels

201
0:10:19.871,000 --> 0:10:22,000
with higher efficiency building cooling systems

202
0:10:23.204,000 --> 0:10:25,000
to reduce their energy usage by two-thirds.

203
0:10:26.03,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And eventually, we might actually be able to build a cooling system

204
0:10:29.712,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that requires no electricity input at all.

205
0:10:32.966,000 --> 0:10:33,000
As a first step towards that,

206
0:10:34.506,000 --> 0:10:35,000
my colleagues at Stanford and I

207
0:10:36.387,000 --> 0:10:38,000
have shown that you could actually maintain

208
0:10:38.437,000 --> 0:10:42,000
something more than 42 degrees Celsius below the air temperature

209
0:10:43.03,000 --> 0:10:44,000
with better engineering.

210
0:10:45.165,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Thank you.

211
0:10:46.339,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Applause)

212
0:10:51.196,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So just imagine that --

213
0:10:52.371,000 --> 0:10:55,000
something that is below freezing on a hot summer's day.

214
0:10:57.927,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So, while I'm very excited about all we can do for cooling,

215
0:11:02.434,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and I think there's a lot yet to be done,

216
0:11:05.712,000 --> 0:11:08,000
as a scientist, I'm also drawn to a more profound opportunity

217
0:11:09.204,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that I believe this work highlights.

218
0:11:11.76,000 --> 0:11:14,000
We can use the cold darkness of space

219
0:11:14.919,000 --> 0:11:15,000
to improve the efficiency

220
0:11:16.593,000 --> 0:11:19,000
of every energy-related process here on earth.

221
0:11:21.204,000 --> 0:11:24,000
One such process I'd like to highlight are solar cells.

222
0:11:24.934,000 --> 0:11:25,000
They heat up under the sun

223
0:11:26.403,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and become less efficient the hotter they are.

224
0:11:29.276,000 --> 0:11:32,000
In 2015, we showed that with deliberate kinds of microstructures

225
0:11:33.177,000 --> 0:11:34,000
on top of a solar cell,

226
0:11:34.748,000 --> 0:11:36,000
we could take better advantage of this cooling effect

227
0:11:37.616,000 --> 0:11:4,000
to maintain a solar cell passively at a lower temperature.

228
0:11:41.708,000 --> 0:11:43,000
This allows the cell to operate more efficiently.

229
0:11:44.627,000 --> 0:11:46,000
We're probing these kinds of opportunities further.

230
0:11:47.619,000 --> 0:11:5,000
We're asking whether we can use the cold of space

231
0:11:50.888,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to help us with water conservation.

232
0:11:53.316,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Or perhaps with off-grid scenarios.

233
0:11:55.689,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Perhaps we could even directly generate power with this cold.

234
0:12:00.522,000 --> 0:12:02,000
There's a large temperature difference between us here on earth

235
0:12:03.499,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and the cold of space.

236
0:12:05.213,000 --> 0:12:07,000
That difference, at least conceptually,

237
0:12:07.365,000 --> 0:12:09,000
could be used to drive something called a heat engine

238
0:12:09.983,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to generate electricity.

239
0:12:11.967,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Could we then make a nighttime power-generation device

240
0:12:15.594,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that generates useful amounts of electricity

241
0:12:18.015,000 --> 0:12:19,000
when solar cells don't work?

242
0:12:19.943,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Could we generate light from darkness?

243
0:12:23.872,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Central to this ability is being able to manage

244
0:12:28.285,000 --> 0:12:31,000
the thermal radiation that's all around us.

245
0:12:31.42,000 --> 0:12:33,000
We're constantly bathed in infrared light;

246
0:12:34.666,000 --> 0:12:36,000
if we could bend it to our will,

247
0:12:37.142,000 --> 0:12:39,000
we could profoundly change the flows of heat and energy

248
0:12:39.896,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that permeate around us every single day.

249
0:12:43.19,000 --> 0:12:46,000
This ability, coupled with the cold darkness of space,

250
0:12:46.555,000 --> 0:12:49,000
points us to a future where we, as a civilization,

251
0:12:49.888,000 --> 0:12:54,000
might be able to more intelligently manage our thermal energy footprint

252
0:12:55.15,000 --> 0:12:56,000
at the very largest scales.

253
0:12:57.904,000 --> 0:12:59,000
As we confront climate change,

254
0:13:00.142,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I believe having this ability in our toolkit

255
0:13:02.769,000 --> 0:13:03,000
will prove to be essential.

256
0:13:05.428,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So, the next time you're walking around outside,

257
0:13:08.65,000 --> 0:13:14,000
yes, do marvel at how the sun is essential to life on earth itself,

258
0:13:15.018,000 --> 0:13:19,000
but don't forget that the rest of the sky has something to offer us as well.

259
0:13:20.533,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Thank you.

260
0:13:21.708,000 --> 0:13:25,000
(Applause)

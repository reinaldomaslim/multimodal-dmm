1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Let me show you some images

2
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
of what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow.

3
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So, that's Kibera, the largest squatter community in Nairobi.

4
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:44,000
This is the squatter community in Sanjay Gandhi National Park

5
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in Bombay, India, what's called Mumbai these days.

6
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
This is Hosinia, the largest and most urbanized favela

7
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in Rio de Janeiro.

8
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And this is Sultanbelyi,

9
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:,000
which is one of the largest squatter communities in Istanbul.

10
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They are what I consider to be the cities of tomorrow,

11
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the new urban world.

12
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Now, why do I say that?

13
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:12,000
To tell you about that I have to talk about this fellow here,

14
0:01:12,000 --> 0:01:14,000
his name is Julius.

15
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And I met Julius the last week that I was living in Kibera.

16
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So, I had been there almost three months,

17
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I was touring around the city going to different squatter areas

18
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and Julius was tagging along, and he was bug eyed

19
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and at certain points we were walking around,

20
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:34,000
he grabbed my hand for support,

21
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which is something most Kenyans would never consider doing.

22
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:42,000
They're very polite and they don't get so forward so quickly.

23
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I found out later that it was Julius' first day in Nairobi,

24
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and he's one of many.

25
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So, close to 200,000 people a day

26
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
migrate from the rural to the urban areas.

27
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:03,000
That's, and I'm going to be fair to the statisticians

28
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
who talked this morning, not almost 1.5 million people a week,

29
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
but almost 1.4 million people a week but I'm a journalist,

30
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and we exaggerate, so almost 1.5 million people a week,

31
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:16,000
close to 70 million people a year.

32
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And if you do the math, that's 130 people every minute.

33
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So, that'll be -- in the 18 minutes that I'm given to talk here,

34
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:28,000
between two and three thousand people will have journeyed to the cities.

35
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And here are the statistics.

36
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Today -- a billion squatters,

37
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
one in six people on the planet.

38
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
2030 -- two billion squatters,

39
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:4,000
one in four people on the planet.

40
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And the estimate is that in 2050, there'll be three billion squatters,

41
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:47,000
better than one in three people on earth.

42
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So, these are the cities of the future, and we have to engage them.

43
0:02:56,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And I was thinking this morning of the good life,

44
0:03:02,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and before I show you the rest of my presentation,

45
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I'm going to violate TED rules here,

46
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and I'm going to read you something from my book as quickly as I can.

47
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Because I think it says something about reversing our perception

48
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:21,000
of what we think the good life is.

49
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So -- "The hut was made of corrugated metal, set on a concrete pad.

50
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It was a 10 by 10 cell.

51
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Armstrong O'Brian, Jr. shared it with three other men.

52
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Armstrong and his friends had no water --

53
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:41,000
they bought it from a nearby tap owner --

54
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:46,000
no toilet -- the families in this compound shared a single pit-latrine --

55
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and no sewers or sanitation.

56
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:5,000
They did have electricity,

57
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
but it was illegal service tapped from someone else's wires,

58
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and could only power one feeble bulb.

59
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This was Southland, a small shanty community

60
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:01,000
on the western side of Nairobi, Kenya.

61
0:04:01,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But it could've been anywhere in the city,

62
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
because more than half the city of Nairobi lives like this.

63
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:11,000
1.5 million people stuffed into mud or metal huts

64
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:14,000
with no services, no toilets, no rights.

65
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:18,000
"Armstrong explained the brutal reality of their situation:

66
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:21,000
they paid 1,500 shillings in rent, about 20 bucks a month,

67
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
a relatively high price for a Kenyan shantytown,

68
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and they could not afford to be late with the money.

69
0:04:27,000 --> 0:04:29,000
'In case you owe one month, the landlord will come with his henchmen

70
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and bundle you out. He will confiscate your things,' Armstrong said.

71
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
'Not one month, one day,' his roommate Hilary Kibagendi Onsomu,

72
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
who was cooking ugali, the spongy white cornmeal concoction

73
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that is the staple food in the country, cut into the conversation.

74
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They called their landlord a Wabenzi, meaning that he is a person

75
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:52,000
who has enough money to drive a Mercedes-Benz.

76
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Hilary served the ugali with a fry of meat and tomatoes;

77
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
the sun slammed down on the thin steel roof;

78
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and we perspired as we ate.

79
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
"After we finished, Armstrong straightened his tie,

80
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:09,000
put on a wool sports jacket, and we headed out into the glare.

81
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Outside a mound of garbage formed the border

82
0:05:12,000 --> 0:05:15,000
between Southland and the adjacent legal neighborhood of Langata.

83
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It was perhaps eight feet tall, 40 feet long, and 10 feet wide.

84
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And it was set in a wider watery ooze.

85
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:28,000
As we passed, two boys were climbing the mount Kenya of trash.

86
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They couldn't have been more than five or six years old.

87
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:34,000
They were barefoot, and with each step their toes sank into the muck

88
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:38,000
sending hundreds of flies scattering from the rancid pile.

89
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I thought they might be playing King of the Hill, but I was wrong.

90
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Once atop the pile, one of the boys lowered his shorts,

91
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:48,000
squatted, and defecated.

92
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The flies buzzed hungrily around his legs.

93
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:57,000
When 20 families -- 100 people or so -- share a single latrine,

94
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:01,000
a boy pooping on a garbage pile is perhaps no big thing.

95
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But it stood in jarring contrast

96
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to something Armstrong had said as we were eating --

97
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that he treasured the quality of life in his neighborhood.

98
0:06:09,000 --> 0:06:14,000
"For Armstrong, Southland wasn't constrained by its material conditions.

99
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Instead, the human spirit radiated out

100
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
from the metal walls and garbage heaps to offer something

101
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
no legal neighborhood could: freedom.

102
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:26,000
'This place is very addictive,' he had said.

103
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
'It's a simple life, but nobody is restricting you.

104
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Nobody is controlling what you do.

105
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Once you have stayed here, you cannot go back.'

106
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:38,000
He meant back beyond that mountain of trash,

107
0:06:38,000 --> 0:06:41,000
back in the legal city, of legal buildings,

108
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
with legal leases and legal rights.

109
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:47,000
'Once you have stayed here,' he said,

110
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:5,000
'you can stay for the rest of your life.'"

111
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So, he has hope, and this is where these communities start.

112
0:06:56,000 --> 0:07:01,000
This is perhaps the most primitive shanty that you can find in Kibera,

113
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:05,000
little more than a stick-and-mud hut next to a garbage heap.

114
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This is getting ready for the monsoon in Bombay, India.

115
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This is home improvement:

116
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:15,000
putting plastic tarps on your roof.

117
0:07:15,000 --> 0:07:19,000
This is in Rio de Janeiro, and it's getting a bit better, right?

118
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We're seeing scavenged terra cotta tile and little pieces of signs,

119
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and plaster over the brick, some color,

120
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and this is Sulay Montakaya's house in Sultanbelyi, and it's getting even better.

121
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
He's got a fence; he scavenged a door;

122
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:38,000
he's got new tile on the roof.

123
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And then you get Rocinha

124
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and you can see that it's getting even better.

125
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:46,000
The buildings here are multi-story.

126
0:07:46,000 --> 0:07:49,000
They develop -- you can see on the far right

127
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:52,000
one where it seems to just stack on top of each other,

128
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
room, after room, after room.

129
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And what people do is they develop their home on one or two stories,

130
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and they sell their loggia or roof rights,

131
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and someone else builds on top of their building,

132
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and then that person sells the roof rights,

133
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and someone else builds on top of their building.

134
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:1,000
All of these buildings are made out of reinforced concrete and brick.

135
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And then you get Sultanbelyi, in Turkey, where it's even built

136
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to a higher level of design.

137
0:08:15,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The crud in the front is mattress stuffing,

138
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and you see that all over Turkey.

139
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:24,000
People dry out or air out their mattress stuffing on their roofs.

140
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
But the green building, on behind,

141
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
you can see that the top floor is not occupied,

142
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:31,000
so people are building with the possibility of expansion.

143
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And it's built to a pretty high standard of design.

144
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And then you finally get squatter homes like this,

145
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
which is built on the suburban model.

146
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Hey, that's a single family home in the squatter community.

147
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:43,000
That's also in Istanbul, Turkey.

148
0:08:43,000 --> 0:08:45,000
They're quite vital places, these communities.

149
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:49,000
This is the main drag of Rocinha, the Estrada da Gavea,

150
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and there's a bus route that runs through it,

151
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:53,000
lots of people out on the street.

152
0:08:53,000 --> 0:08:56,000
These communities in these cities are actually more vital

153
0:08:56,000 --> 0:08:58,000
than the illegal communities.

154
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:01,000
They have more things going on in them.

155
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:04,000
This is a typical pathway in Rocinha called a "beco" --

156
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:06,000
these are how you get around the community.

157
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's on very steep ground.

158
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
They're built on the hills, inland from the beaches in Rio,

159
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and you can see that the houses are just cantilevered over the natural obstructions.

160
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So, that's just a rock in the hillside.

161
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And these becos are normally very crowded,

162
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and people hump furniture up them, or refrigerators up them,

163
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
all sorts of things.

164
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Beer is all carried in on your shoulders.

165
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Beer is a very important thing in Brazil.

166
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:36,000
This is commerce in Kenya, right along the train tracks,

167
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
so close to the train tracks that the merchants

168
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:41,000
sometimes have to pull the merchandise out of the way.

169
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:44,000
This is a marketplace, also in Kenya, Toi Market,

170
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:48,000
lots of dealers, in almost everything you want to buy.

171
0:09:48,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Those green things in the foreground are mangoes.

172
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
This is a shopping street in Kibera,

173
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and you can see that there's a soda dealer, a health clinic,

174
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:03,000
two beauty salons, a bar, two grocery stores, and a church, and more.

175
0:10:03,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It's a typical downtown street; it just happens to be self-built.

176
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:11,000
This here, on the right-hand side,

177
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:14,000
is what's called a -- if you look at the fine print under the awning --

178
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
it's a hotel.

179
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And what hotel means, in Kenya and India, is an eating-place.

180
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So, that's a restaurant.

181
0:10:24,000 --> 0:10:26,000
People steal electrical power -- this is Rio.

182
0:10:26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
People tap in and they have thieves who are called "grillos" or "crickets,"

183
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and they steal the electrical power

184
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and wire the neighborhood.

185
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:4,000
People burn trash to get rid of the garbage,

186
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and they dig their own sewer channels.

187
0:10:44,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Talk about more plastic bags than plankton.

188
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And sometimes they have natural trash-disposal.

189
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And when they have more money they cement their streets,

190
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and they put in sewers and good water pipes, and stuff like that.

191
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:04,000
This is water going to Rio. People run their water pipes all over the place,

192
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and that little hut right there has a pump in it, and that's what people do:

193
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:09,000
they steal electricity; they install a pump

194
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and they tap into the water main, and pump water up to their houses.

195
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So, the question is how do you go from the mud-hut village,

196
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:24,000
to the more developed city, to the even highly developed Sultanbelyi?

197
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I say there are two things.

198
0:11:26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
One is people need a guarantee they won't be evicted.

199
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:3,000
That does not necessarily mean property rights,

200
0:11:3,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and I would disagree with Hernando de Soto on that question,

201
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because property rights create a lot of complications.

202
0:11:36,000 --> 0:11:4,000
They're most often sold to people, and people then wind up in debt

203
0:11:4,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and have to pay back the debt,

204
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and sometimes have to sell their property

205
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
in order to pay back the debt.

206
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:48,000
There's a whole variety of other reasons why property rights

207
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:5,000
sometimes don't work in these cases,

208
0:11:5,000 --> 0:11:52,000
but they do need security of tenure.

209
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And they need access to politics, and that can mean two things.

210
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:,000
That can mean community organizing from below,

211
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but it can also mean possibilities from above.

212
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And I say that because the system in Turkey is notable.

213
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Turkey has two great laws that protect squatters.

214
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:13,000
One is that -- it's called "gecekondu" in Turkish,

215
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:17,000
which means "built overnight," and if you build your house overnight

216
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in Turkey, you can't be evicted without due process of law,

217
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:24,000
if they don't catch you during the night.

218
0:12:24,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And the second aspect is that once you have 2,000 people

219
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in the community, you can petition the government

220
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:34,000
to be recognized as a legal sub-municipality.

221
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And when you're a legal sub-municipality, you suddenly have politics.

222
0:12:37,000 --> 0:12:39,000
You're allowed to have an elected government, collect taxes,

223
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:43,000
provide municipal services, and that's exactly what they do.

224
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So, these are the civic leaders of the future.

225
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:48,000
The woman in the center is Geeta Jiwa.

226
0:12:48,000 --> 0:12:54,000
She lives in one of those tents on the highway median in Mumbai.

227
0:12:54,000 --> 0:12:56,000
That's Sureka Gundi; she also lives with her family

228
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:58,000
on the tent along the same highway median.

229
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:,000
They're very outspoken. They're very active.

230
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:02,000
They can be community leaders.

231
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
This woman is Nine, which means "grandma" in Turkish.

232
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And there were three old ladies who lived in --

233
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that's her self-built house behind her -- and they've lived there for 30 or 40 years,

234
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and they are the backbone of the community there.

235
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
This is Richard Muthama Peter,

236
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and he is an itinerant street photographer in Kibera.

237
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:24,000
He makes money taking pictures of the neighborhood,

238
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and the people in the neighborhood,

239
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and is a great resource in the community.

240
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And finally my choice to run for mayor of Rio is Cezinio,

241
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:34,000
the fruit merchant with his two kids here,

242
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and a more honest and giving and caring man I don't know.

243
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:41,000
The future of these communities is in the people

244
0:13:41,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and in our ability to work with those people.

245
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So, I think the message I take, from what I read from the book,

246
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
from what Armstrong said, and from all these people,

247
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:53,000
is that these are neighborhoods.

248
0:13:53,000 --> 0:13:55,000
The issue is not urban poverty.

249
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:58,000
The issue is not the larger, over-arching thing.

250
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The issue is for us to recognize that these are neighborhoods --

251
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:04,000
this is a legitimate form of urban development --

252
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and that cities have to engage these residents,

253
0:14:07,000 --> 0:14:1,000
because they are building the cities of the future.

254
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Thank you very much.

1
0:00:12.722,000 --> 0:00:15,000
We need to build a weather service for water.

2
0:00:16.236,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Yet, until we collectively demand accountability,

3
0:00:19.634,000 --> 0:00:21,000
the incentives to fund it will not exist.

4
0:00:23.805,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The first time I spoke at a conference was here at TED, eight years ago.

5
0:00:28.768,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Fresh out of grad school, little did I know

6
0:00:31.08,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that in those few minutes onstage,

7
0:00:32.958,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was framing the questions I was going to be asked

8
0:00:35.516,000 --> 0:00:36,000
for the next decade.

9
0:00:37.599,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And, like too many 20-somethings,

10
0:00:40.135,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I expected to solve the world's problems --

11
0:00:42.635,000 --> 0:00:44,000
more specifically, the world's water problems --

12
0:00:45.411,000 --> 0:00:46,000
with my technology.

13
0:00:48.044,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I had a lot to learn.

14
0:00:50.63,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It was seductive,

15
0:00:52.138,000 --> 0:00:56,000
believing that our biggest water quality problems persist

16
0:00:56.494,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because they're so hard to identify.

17
0:00:59.532,000 --> 0:01:,000
And I presumed

18
0:01:01.223,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that we just needed simpler, faster and more affordable sensors.

19
0:01:07.071,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I was wrong.

20
0:01:09.512,000 --> 0:01:13,000
While it's true that managing tomorrow's water risk

21
0:01:13.659,000 --> 0:01:17,000
is going to require better data and more technology,

22
0:01:17.753,000 --> 0:01:21,000
today we're barely using the little water data that we have.

23
0:01:22.814,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Our biggest water problems persist because of what we don't do

24
0:01:27.525,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the problems we fail to acknowledge.

25
0:01:31.151,000 --> 0:01:32,000
There's actually little question

26
0:01:32.788,000 --> 0:01:36,000
about what today's water data is telling us to do as a species:

27
0:01:37.659,000 --> 0:01:38,000
we need to conserve more,

28
0:01:39.467,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and we need to pollute less.

29
0:01:42.364,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But today's data is not going to help us forecast the emerging risks

30
0:01:46.712,000 --> 0:01:48,000
facing businesses and markets.

31
0:01:48.948,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It's rapidly becoming useless for that.

32
0:01:52.039,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It used to carry more value,

33
0:01:54.021,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but it's never actually told us with any real accuracy

34
0:01:58.04,000 --> 0:01:59,000
how much water we have

35
0:01:59.606,000 --> 0:02:,000
or what's in it.

36
0:02:01.899,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Let's consider the past decade of water usage statistics

37
0:02:06.306,000 --> 0:02:08,000
from each of the G20 nations.

38
0:02:08.556,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now, what these numbers do not tell you

39
0:02:11.133,000 --> 0:02:16,000
is that none of these countries directly measures how much water they use.

40
0:02:16.221,000 --> 0:02:17,000
These are all estimates,

41
0:02:17.529,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and they're based on outdated models

42
0:02:20.176,000 --> 0:02:22,000
that don't consider the climate crisis,

43
0:02:23.034,000 --> 0:02:26,000
nor do they consider its impact on water.

44
0:02:28.037,000 --> 0:02:32,000
In 2015, Chennai, India's sixth-largest city,

45
0:02:32.103,000 --> 0:02:35,000
was hit with the worst floods it had seen in a century.

46
0:02:37.1,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Today, its water reservoirs are nearly dry.

47
0:02:40.862,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It took three years to get here,

48
0:02:43.888,000 --> 0:02:45,000
three years of subaverage rainfall.

49
0:02:46.231,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now, that's faster than most nations tabulate their national water data,

50
0:02:50.965,000 --> 0:02:51,000
including the US.

51
0:02:53.2,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And although there were forecasts

52
0:02:55.832,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that predicted severe shortages of water in Chennai,

53
0:03:00.088,000 --> 0:03:03,000
none of them could actually help us pinpoint exactly when or where

54
0:03:03.62,000 --> 0:03:04,000
this was going to happen.

55
0:03:05.536,000 --> 0:03:08,000
This is a new type of water problem,

56
0:03:08.601,000 --> 0:03:13,000
because the rate at which every aspect of our water cycle changes

57
0:03:13.939,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is accelerating.

58
0:03:15.392,000 --> 0:03:18,000
As a recent UN warning this month revealed,

59
0:03:18.741,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we are now facing one new climate emergency every single week.

60
0:03:26.089,000 --> 0:03:29,000
There are greater uncertainties ahead for water quality.

61
0:03:29.344,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It's rare in most countries for most water bodies to be tested

62
0:03:33.165,000 --> 0:03:35,000
for more than a handful of contaminants in a year.

63
0:03:36.04,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Instead of testing, we use what's called the "dilution model"

64
0:03:39.225,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to manage pollution.

65
0:03:41.011,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now, imagine I took an Olympic-sized swimming pool,

66
0:03:44.703,000 --> 0:03:47,000
I filled it with fresh water and I added one drop of mercury.

67
0:03:48.06,000 --> 0:03:5,000
That would dilute down to one part per billion mercury,

68
0:03:50.906,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which is well within what the World Health Organization

69
0:03:53.503,000 --> 0:03:54,000
considers safe.

70
0:03:55.061,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But if there was any unforeseen drop in how much water was available --

71
0:03:59.303,000 --> 0:04:03,000
less groundwater, less stream flow, less water in the pool --

72
0:04:04.244,000 --> 0:04:05,000
less dilution would take place,

73
0:04:06.225,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and things would get more toxic.

74
0:04:09.049,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So this is how most countries are managing pollution.

75
0:04:12.438,000 --> 0:04:15,000
They use this model to tell them how much pollution is safe.

76
0:04:16.146,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And it has clear weaknesses,

77
0:04:18.295,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but it worked well enough when we had abundant water

78
0:04:20.961,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and consistent weather patterns.

79
0:04:23.751,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Now that we don't, we're going to need to invest and develop

80
0:04:27.811,000 --> 0:04:29,000
new data-collection strategies.

81
0:04:30.161,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But before we do that, we have to start acting on the data we already have.

82
0:04:34.944,000 --> 0:04:36,000
This is a jet fuel fire.

83
0:04:37.09,000 --> 0:04:38,000
As many of you may be aware,

84
0:04:38.95,000 --> 0:04:41,000
jet fuel emissions play an enormous role in climate change.

85
0:04:42.307,000 --> 0:04:45,000
What you might not be aware of is that the US Department of Defense

86
0:04:45.965,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is the world's largest consumer of jet fuel.

87
0:04:48.772,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And when they consume jet fuel,

88
0:04:50.526,000 --> 0:04:54,000
they mandate the use of the firefighting foam pictured here,

89
0:04:54.576,000 --> 0:04:57,000
which contains a class of chemicals called PFAS.

90
0:04:57.827,000 --> 0:05:,000
Nobody uses more of this foam than the US Department of Defense,

91
0:05:01.658,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and every time it's used, PFAS finds its way into our water systems.

92
0:05:06.582,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Globally, militaries have been using this foam since the 1970s.

93
0:05:11.511,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We know PFAS causes cancer, birth defects,

94
0:05:15.081,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and it's now so pervasive in the environment

95
0:05:17.952,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that we seem to find it in nearly every living thing we test,

96
0:05:22.262,000 --> 0:05:23,000
including us.

97
0:05:25.073,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But so far, the US Department of Defense has not been held accountable

98
0:05:29.259,000 --> 0:05:3,000
for PFAS contamination,

99
0:05:31.045,000 --> 0:05:32,000
nor has it been held liable.

100
0:05:32.969,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And although there's an effort underway to phase out these firefighting foams,

101
0:05:36.956,000 --> 0:05:39,000
they're not embracing safer, effective alternatives.

102
0:05:40.493,000 --> 0:05:42,000
They're actually using other PFAS molecules,

103
0:05:43.354,000 --> 0:05:48,000
which may, for all we know, carry worse health consequences.

104
0:05:49.969,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So today, government accountability is eroding to the point of elimination,

105
0:05:56.544,000 --> 0:06:,000
and the risk of liability from water pollution is vanishing.

106
0:06:02.029,000 --> 0:06:06,000
What types of incentives does this create for investing in our water future?

107
0:06:07.19,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Over the past decade, the average early stage global investment

108
0:06:12.94,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in early stage water technology companies

109
0:06:15.391,000 --> 0:06:17,000
has totaled less than 30 million dollars every year.

110
0:06:18.919,000 --> 0:06:24,000
That's 0.12 percent of global venture capital for early stage companies.

111
0:06:27.035,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And public spending is not going up nearly fast enough.

112
0:06:31.629,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And a closer look at it reveals that water is not a priority.

113
0:06:36.371,000 --> 0:06:41,000
In 2014, the US federal government was spending 11 dollars per citizen

114
0:06:41.803,000 --> 0:06:42,000
on water infrastructure,

115
0:06:43.717,000 --> 0:06:47,000
versus 251 dollars on IT infrastructure.

116
0:06:48.478,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So when we don't use the data we have,

117
0:06:51.819,000 --> 0:06:53,000
we don't encourage investment in new technologies,

118
0:06:54.482,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we don't encourage more data collection

119
0:06:56.666,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and we certainly don't encourage investment in securing a water future.

120
0:07:02.82,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So are we doomed?

121
0:07:05.477,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Part of what I'm still learning

122
0:07:07.212,000 --> 0:07:12,000
is how to balance the doom and the urgency with things we can do,

123
0:07:12.358,000 --> 0:07:14,000
because Greta Thunberg and the Extinction Rebellion

124
0:07:15.208,000 --> 0:07:17,000
don't want our hope -- they want us to act.

125
0:07:17.388,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So what can we do?

126
0:07:19.872,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It's hard to imagine life without a weather service,

127
0:07:24.806,000 --> 0:07:26,000
but before modern weather forecasting,

128
0:07:27.145,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we had no commercial air travel,

129
0:07:29.22,000 --> 0:07:32,000
it was common for ships to be lost at sea,

130
0:07:33.112,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and a single storm could produce a food shortage.

131
0:07:37.46,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Once we had radio and telegraph networks,

132
0:07:39.92,000 --> 0:07:42,000
all that was necessary to solve these problems

133
0:07:43.252,000 --> 0:07:45,000
was tracking the movement of storms.

134
0:07:46.705,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And that laid the foundation for a global data collection effort,

135
0:07:51.113,000 --> 0:07:55,000
one that every household and every business depends upon today.

136
0:07:55.987,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And this was as much the result of coordinated and consistent data collection

137
0:07:59.748,000 --> 0:08:04,000
as it was the result of producing a culture that saw greater value

138
0:08:05.179,000 --> 0:08:09,000
in openly assessing and sharing everything that it could find out and discover

139
0:08:10.05,000 --> 0:08:11,000
about the risks we face.

140
0:08:13.108,000 --> 0:08:16,000
A global weather service for water would help us forecast water shortages.

141
0:08:17.77,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It could help us implement rationing well before reservoirs run dry.

142
0:08:23.942,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It could help us detect contamination before it spreads.

143
0:08:27.221,000 --> 0:08:29,000
It could protect our supply chains,

144
0:08:29.625,000 --> 0:08:3,000
secure our food supplies,

145
0:08:31.503,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and, perhaps most importantly,

146
0:08:33.173,000 --> 0:08:36,000
it would enable the precise estimation of risk

147
0:08:36.635,000 --> 0:08:38,000
necessary to insure against it.

148
0:08:40.062,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We know we can do this because we've already done it with weather.

149
0:08:43.283,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But it's going to require resources.

150
0:08:46.683,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We need to encourage greater investment in water.

151
0:08:49.513,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Investors, venture capitalists:

152
0:08:51.649,000 --> 0:08:54,000
a portion of your funds and portfolios should be dedicated to water.

153
0:08:55.715,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Nothing is more valuable

154
0:08:57.283,000 --> 0:09:,000
and, after all, businesses are going to need to understand water risks

155
0:09:01.078,000 --> 0:09:04,000
in order to remain competitive in the world we are entering.

156
0:09:05.22,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Aside from venture capital,

157
0:09:07.479,000 --> 0:09:1,000
there are also lots of promising government programs

158
0:09:10.782,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that encourage economic development through tax incentives.

159
0:09:14.665,000 --> 0:09:16,000
A new option in the US that my company is using

160
0:09:17.518,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is called "opportunity zones."

161
0:09:19.651,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They offer favorable tax treatment for investing capital gains

162
0:09:23.581,000 --> 0:09:26,000
in designated distressed and low-income areas.

163
0:09:26.94,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now, these are areas

164
0:09:28.761,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that are also facing staggering water risk,

165
0:09:31.399,000 --> 0:09:34,000
so this creates crucial incentives to work directly with the communities

166
0:09:34.976,000 --> 0:09:35,000
who need help most.

167
0:09:36.78,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And if you're not looking to make this type of investment

168
0:09:41.131,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but you own land in the US,

169
0:09:42.684,000 --> 0:09:45,000
did you know that you can leverage your land

170
0:09:46.262,000 --> 0:09:48,000
to conserve water quality permanently

171
0:09:49.201,000 --> 0:09:51,000
with a conservation easement?

172
0:09:51.242,000 --> 0:09:54,000
You can assign the perpetual right to a local land trust

173
0:09:54.875,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to conserve your land

174
0:09:56.512,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and set specific water quality goals.

175
0:09:58.47,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And if you meet those goals,

176
0:10:00.204,000 --> 0:10:04,000
you can be rewarded with a substantial tax discount every year.

177
0:10:06.435,000 --> 0:10:1,000
How many areas could our global community protect

178
0:10:10.869,000 --> 0:10:12,000
through these and other programs?

179
0:10:14.435,000 --> 0:10:17,000
They're powerful because they offer the access to real property

180
0:10:17.942,000 --> 0:10:21,000
necessary to lay the foundation for a global weather service for water.

181
0:10:23.02,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But this can only work if we use these programs as they are intended

182
0:10:28.779,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and not as mere vehicles for tax evasion.

183
0:10:33.072,000 --> 0:10:35,000
When the conservation easement was established,

184
0:10:35.357,000 --> 0:10:38,000
nobody could anticipate how ingrained in environmental movements

185
0:10:38.639,000 --> 0:10:4,000
corporate polluters would become.

186
0:10:40.941,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And we've become accustomed to companies talking about the climate crisis

187
0:10:45.676,000 --> 0:10:47,000
while doing nothing about it.

188
0:10:49.738,000 --> 0:10:53,000
This has undermined the legacy and the impact of these programs,

189
0:10:54.403,000 --> 0:10:56,000
but it also makes them ripe for reclamation.

190
0:10:57.109,000 --> 0:11:,000
Why not use conservation easements as they were intended,

191
0:11:00.231,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to set and reach ambitious conservation goals?

192
0:11:04.605,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Why not create opportunities in opportunity zones?

193
0:11:09.456,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Because fundamentally, water security requires accountability.

194
0:11:14.444,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Accountability is not corporate polluters sponsoring environmental groups

195
0:11:20.186,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and museums.

196
0:11:22.019,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Those are conflicts of interest.

197
0:11:24.083,000 --> 0:11:29,000
(Applause)

198
0:11:30.126,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Accountability is:

199
0:11:33.143,000 --> 0:11:37,000
making the risk of liability too expensive

200
0:11:37.427,000 --> 0:11:39,000
to continue polluting and wasting our water.

201
0:11:40.429,000 --> 0:11:43,000
We can't keep settling for words. It's time to act.

202
0:11:44.233,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And where better to start than with our biggest polluters,

203
0:11:47.725,000 --> 0:11:52,000
particularly the US Department of Defense, which is taxpayer-funded.

204
0:11:52.828,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Who and what are we protecting when US soldiers, their families

205
0:11:56.525,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and the people who live near US military bases abroad

206
0:12:00.036,000 --> 0:12:02,000
are all drinking toxic water?

207
0:12:02.876,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Global security can no longer remain at odds with protecting our planet

208
0:12:07.347,000 --> 0:12:08,000
or our collective health.

209
0:12:08.811,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Our survival depends on it.

210
0:12:11.404,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Similarly,

211
0:12:13.178,000 --> 0:12:16,000
agriculture in most countries depends on taxpayer-funded subsidies

212
0:12:17.078,000 --> 0:12:2,000
that are paid to farmers to secure and stabilize food supplies.

213
0:12:22.039,000 --> 0:12:26,000
These incentives are a crucial leverage point for us,

214
0:12:26.441,000 --> 0:12:3,000
because agriculture is responsible for consuming 70 percent

215
0:12:30.995,000 --> 0:12:32,000
of all the water we use every year.

216
0:12:34.061,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Fertilizer and pesticide runoff

217
0:12:36.737,000 --> 0:12:38,000
are the two biggest sources of water pollution.

218
0:12:39.46,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Let's restructure these subsidies to demand better water efficiency

219
0:12:43.249,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and less pollution.

220
0:12:44.995,000 --> 0:12:49,000
(Applause)

221
0:12:50.74,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Finally:

222
0:12:52.223,000 --> 0:12:53,000
we can't expect progress

223
0:12:53.719,000 --> 0:12:55,000
if we're unwilling to confront the conflicts of interest

224
0:12:56.621,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that suppress science,

225
0:12:58.502,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that undermine innovation

226
0:13:00.474,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and that discourage transparency.

227
0:13:02.956,000 --> 0:13:03,000
It is in the public interest

228
0:13:04.78,000 --> 0:13:07,000
to measure and to share everything we can learn and discover

229
0:13:08.752,000 --> 0:13:1,000
about the risks we face in water.

230
0:13:11.881,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Reality does not exist until it's measured.

231
0:13:15.475,000 --> 0:13:18,000
It doesn't just take technology to measure it.

232
0:13:19.298,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It takes our collective will.

233
0:13:21.201,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Thank you.

234
0:13:22.559,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Applause)

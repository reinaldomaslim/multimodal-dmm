1
0:00:25.261,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm the luckiest guy in the world.

2
0:00:27.944,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I got to see the last case of killer smallpox in the world.

3
0:00:33.182,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was in India this past year,

4
0:00:35.127,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and I may have seen the last cases of polio in the world.

5
0:00:40.395,000 --> 0:00:43,000
There's nothing that makes you feel more --

6
0:00:43.44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the blessing and the honor of working in a program like that --

7
0:00:48.007,000 --> 0:00:52,000
than to know that something that horrible no longer exists.

8
0:00:52.401,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So I'm going to tell you --

9
0:00:53.752,000 --> 0:00:55,000
(Applause)

10
0:00:56.481,000 --> 0:00:58,000
so I'm going to show you some dirty pictures.

11
0:00:59.314,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They are difficult to watch, but you should look at them with optimism,

12
0:01:05.688,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because the horror of these pictures will be matched

13
0:01:10.783,000 --> 0:01:14,000
by the uplifting quality of knowing that they no longer exist.

14
0:01:15.839,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But first, I'm going to tell you a little bit about my own journey.

15
0:01:20.455,000 --> 0:01:23,000
My background is not exactly the conventional medical education

16
0:01:23.764,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that you might expect.

17
0:01:26.23,000 --> 0:01:3,000
When I was an intern in San Francisco,

18
0:01:31.163,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I heard about a group of Native Americans who had taken over Alcatraz Island,

19
0:01:34.999,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and a Native American who wanted to give birth on that island,

20
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and no other doctor wanted to go and help her give birth.

21
0:01:42.165,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I went out to Alcatraz, and I lived on the island for several weeks.

22
0:01:46.588,000 --> 0:01:48,000
She gave birth; I caught the baby; I got off the island;

23
0:01:49.333,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I landed in San Francisco;

24
0:01:51.213,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and all the press wanted to talk to me,

25
0:01:53.125,000 --> 0:01:57,000
because my three weeks on the island made me an expert in Indian affairs.

26
0:01:57.25,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:58.278,000 --> 0:02:,000
I wound up on every television show.

28
0:02:00.341,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Someone saw me on television; they called me up; and they asked me

29
0:02:03.477,000 --> 0:02:05,000
if I'd like to be in a movie and to play a young doctor

30
0:02:06.106,000 --> 0:02:09,000
for a bunch of rock and roll stars who were traveling in a bus ride

31
0:02:09.28,000 --> 0:02:11,000
from San Francisco to England.

32
0:02:11.378,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And I said, yes, I would do that,

33
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:17,000
so I became the doctor in an absolutely awful movie

34
0:02:17.28,000 --> 0:02:18,000
called "Medicine Ball Caravan."

35
0:02:19.202,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:20.272,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now, you know from the '60s,

37
0:02:21.768,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you're either on the bus or you're off the bus; I was on the bus.

38
0:02:24.869,000 --> 0:02:26,000
My wife of 37 years and I joined the bus.

39
0:02:27.89,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Our bus ride took us from San Francisco to London,

40
0:02:30.594,000 --> 0:02:32,000
then we switched buses at the big pond.

41
0:02:32.817,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We then got on two more buses

42
0:02:36.269,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and we drove through Turkey and Iran, Afghanistan,

43
0:02:39.365,000 --> 0:02:42,000
over the Khyber Pass into Pakistan, like every other young doctor.

44
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:45,000
This is us at the Khyber Pass, and that's our bus.

45
0:02:45.691,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We had some difficulty getting over the Khyber Pass.

46
0:02:49.529,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But we wound up in India.

47
0:02:51.465,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And then, like everyone else in our generation,

48
0:02:53.738,000 --> 0:02:55,000
we went to live in a Himalayan monastery.

49
0:02:56.047,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:59.42,000 --> 0:03:,000
This is just like a residency program,

51
0:03:01.255,000 --> 0:03:03,000
for those of you that are in medical school.

52
0:03:03.435,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

53
0:03:05.092,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And we studied with a wise man, a guru named Karoli Baba,

54
0:03:10.316,000 --> 0:03:13,000
who then told me to get rid of the dress,

55
0:03:13.982,000 --> 0:03:14,000
put on a three-piece suit,

56
0:03:15.749,000 --> 0:03:18,000
go join the United Nations as a diplomat

57
0:03:19.027,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and work for the World Health Organization.

58
0:03:21.111,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And he made an outrageous prediction that smallpox would be eradicated,

59
0:03:25.503,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and that this was God's gift to humanity,

60
0:03:28.549,000 --> 0:03:3,000
because of the hard work of dedicated scientists.

61
0:03:31.66,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And that prediction came true.

62
0:03:34.504,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This little girl is Rahima Banu,

63
0:03:36.838,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and she was the last case of killer smallpox in the world.

64
0:03:40.232,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And this document is the certificate that the global commission signed,

65
0:03:45.232,000 --> 0:03:49,000
certifying the world to have eradicated the first disease in history.

66
0:03:51.336,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The key to eradicating smallpox was early detection, early response.

67
0:03:57.661,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I'm going to ask you to repeat that: early detection, early response.

68
0:04:01.692,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Can you say that?

69
0:04:02.868,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Audience: Early detection, early response.

70
0:04:05.962,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Larry Brilliant: Smallpox was the worst disease in history.

71
0:04:08.895,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It killed more people than all the wars in history.

72
0:04:11.437,000 --> 0:04:15,000
In the last century, it killed 500 million people.

73
0:04:17.943,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You're reading about Larry Page already.

74
0:04:19.873,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Somebody reads very fast.

75
0:04:21.469,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Laughter)

76
0:04:23.047,000 --> 0:04:25,000
In the year that Larry Page and Sergey Brin --

77
0:04:25.245,000 --> 0:04:28,000
with whom I have a certain affection and a new affiliation --

78
0:04:28.885,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in the year in which they were born,

79
0:04:31.089,000 --> 0:04:33,000
two million people died of smallpox.

80
0:04:34.059,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We declared smallpox eradicated in 1980.

81
0:04:38.76,000 --> 0:04:41,000
This is the most important slide that I've ever seen in public health,

82
0:04:42.08,000 --> 0:04:44,000
[Sovereigns killed by smallpox] because it shows you

83
0:04:44.588,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to be the richest and the strongest,

84
0:04:46.483,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and to be kings and queens of the world,

85
0:04:48.432,000 --> 0:04:5,000
did not protect you from dying of smallpox.

86
0:04:50.53,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Never can you doubt that we are all in this together.

87
0:04:55.469,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But to see smallpox from the perspective of a sovereign

88
0:04:59.403,000 --> 0:05:,000
is the wrong perspective.

89
0:05:01.302,000 --> 0:05:03,000
You should see it from the perspective of a mother,

90
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:07,000
watching her child develop this disease and standing by helplessly.

91
0:05:07.841,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Day one, day two, day three,

92
0:05:13.596,000 --> 0:05:18,000
day four, day five, day six.

93
0:05:19.701,000 --> 0:05:21,000
You're a mother and you're watching your child,

94
0:05:22.638,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and on day six, you see pustules that become hard.

95
0:05:28.4,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Day seven, they show the classic scars of smallpox umbilication.

96
0:05:33.148,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Day eight.

97
0:05:34.482,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And Al Gore said earlier

98
0:05:36.234,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that the most photographed image in the world,

99
0:05:39.147,000 --> 0:05:4,000
the most printed image in the world,

100
0:05:40.918,000 --> 0:05:41,000
was that of the Earth.

101
0:05:42.516,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But this was in 1974, and as of that moment,

102
0:05:45.737,000 --> 0:05:48,000
this photograph was the photograph that was the most widely printed,

103
0:05:49.384,000 --> 0:05:52,000
because we printed two billion copies of this photograph,

104
0:05:52.893,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and we took them hand to hand, door to door,

105
0:05:56.071,000 --> 0:06:,000
to show people and ask them if there was smallpox in their house,

106
0:06:00.976,000 --> 0:06:02,000
because that was our surveillance system.

107
0:06:03.106,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We didn't have Google, we didn't have web crawlers,

108
0:06:05.685,000 --> 0:06:06,000
we didn't have computers.

109
0:06:08.867,000 --> 0:06:11,000
By day nine -- you look at this picture and you're horrified;

110
0:06:12.748,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I look at this picture and I say, "Thank God,"

111
0:06:15.305,000 --> 0:06:18,000
because it's clear that this is only an ordinary case of smallpox,

112
0:06:19.29,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and I know this child will live.

113
0:06:22.487,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And by day 13, the lesions are scabbing, his eyelids are swollen,

114
0:06:27.854,000 --> 0:06:3,000
but you know this child has no other secondary infection.

115
0:06:32.064,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And by day 20, while he will be scarred for life, he will live.

116
0:06:37.175,000 --> 0:06:4,000
There are other kinds of smallpox that are not like that.

117
0:06:40.248,000 --> 0:06:42,000
This is confluent smallpox,

118
0:06:42.66,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in which there isn't a single place on the body where you could put a finger

119
0:06:46.469,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and not be covered by lesions.

120
0:06:49.302,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Flat smallpox, which killed 100 percent of people who got it.

121
0:06:53.612,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And hemorrhagic smallpox, the most cruel of all,

122
0:06:56.605,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which had a predilection for pregnant women.

123
0:06:59.897,000 --> 0:07:,000
I've probably had 50 women die.

124
0:07:02.31,000 --> 0:07:04,000
They all had hemorrhagic smallpox.

125
0:07:04.436,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I've never seen anybody die from it who wasn't a pregnant woman.

126
0:07:08.458,000 --> 0:07:11,000
In 1967, the WHO embarked on what was an outrageous program

127
0:07:12.403,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to eradicate a disease.

128
0:07:14.204,000 --> 0:07:17,000
In that year, there were 34 countries affected with smallpox.

129
0:07:18.363,000 --> 0:07:2,000
By 1970, we were down to 18 countries.

130
0:07:21.848,000 --> 0:07:23,000
1974, we were down to five countries.

131
0:07:24.848,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But in that year, smallpox exploded throughout India.

132
0:07:30.154,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And India was the place where smallpox made its last stand.

133
0:07:34.548,000 --> 0:07:37,000
In 1974, India had a population of 600 million.

134
0:07:37.611,000 --> 0:07:4,000
There are 21 linguistic states in India,

135
0:07:40.653,000 --> 0:07:42,000
which is like saying 21 different countries.

136
0:07:43.242,000 --> 0:07:45,000
There are 20 million people on the road at any time,

137
0:07:46.163,000 --> 0:07:52,000
in buses and trains, walking; 500,000 villages, 120 million households,

138
0:07:52.206,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and none of them wanted to report

139
0:07:54.534,000 --> 0:07:56,000
if they had a case of smallpox in their house,

140
0:07:57,000 --> 0:08:,000
because they thought that smallpox was the visitation of a deity,

141
0:08:00.388,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Shitala Mata, the cooling mother,

142
0:08:02.435,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and it was wrong to bring strangers into your house

143
0:08:06.635,000 --> 0:08:07,000
when the deity was in the house.

144
0:08:09.048,000 --> 0:08:11,000
No incentive to report smallpox.

145
0:08:11.686,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It wasn't just India that had smallpox deities;

146
0:08:14.315,000 --> 0:08:17,000
smallpox deities were prevalent all over the world.

147
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So, how we eradicated smallpox was --

148
0:08:21.436,000 --> 0:08:23,000
mass vaccination wouldn't work.

149
0:08:23.734,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You could vaccinate everybody in India,

150
0:08:25.661,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but one year later there'd be 21 million new babies,

151
0:08:28.185,000 --> 0:08:3,000
which was then the population of Canada.

152
0:08:30.693,000 --> 0:08:32,000
It wouldn't do just to vaccinate everyone.

153
0:08:32.905,000 --> 0:08:35,000
You had to find every single case of smallpox in the world

154
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
at the same time, and draw a circle of immunity around it.

155
0:08:39.545,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And that's what we did.

156
0:08:42.315,000 --> 0:08:47,000
In India alone, my 150,000 best friends and I went door to door,

157
0:08:47.534,000 --> 0:08:49,000
with that same picture,

158
0:08:49.632,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to every single house in India.

159
0:08:51.227,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We made over one billion house calls.

160
0:08:54.541,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And in the process, I learned something very important.

161
0:08:58.763,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Every time we did a house-to-house search,

162
0:09:03.045,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we had a spike in the number of reports of smallpox.

163
0:09:07.793,000 --> 0:09:12,000
When we didn't search, we had the illusion that there was no disease.

164
0:09:12.952,000 --> 0:09:16,000
When we did search, we had the illusion that there was more disease.

165
0:09:17.18,000 --> 0:09:19,000
A surveillance system was necessary,

166
0:09:19.443,000 --> 0:09:24,000
because what we needed was early detection, early response.

167
0:09:26.722,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So we searched and we searched,

168
0:09:28.945,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and we found every case of smallpox in India.

169
0:09:31.819,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We had a reward. We raised the reward.

170
0:09:34.804,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We continued to increase the reward.

171
0:09:36.884,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We had a scorecard that we wrote on every house.

172
0:09:40.426,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And as we did that,

173
0:09:42.181,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the number of reported cases in the world dropped to zero.

174
0:09:46.963,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And in 1980, we declared the globe free of smallpox.

175
0:09:51.667,000 --> 0:09:55,000
It was the largest campaign in United Nations history,

176
0:09:56.196,000 --> 0:09:57,000
until the Iraq war.

177
0:09:58.657,000 --> 0:10:01,000
150,000 people from all over the world --

178
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:04,000
doctors of every race, religion, culture and nation,

179
0:10:04.94,000 --> 0:10:08,000
who fought side by side, brothers and sisters,

180
0:10:09.859,000 --> 0:10:12,000
with each other, not against each other,

181
0:10:13.121,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in a common cause to make the world better.

182
0:10:16.248,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But smallpox was the fourth disease that was intended for eradication.

183
0:10:20.068,000 --> 0:10:22,000
We failed three other times.

184
0:10:22.345,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We failed against malaria, yellow fever and yaws.

185
0:10:25.648,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But soon we may see polio eradicated.

186
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But the key to eradicating polio is early detection, early response.

187
0:10:35.61,000 --> 0:10:37,000
This may be the year we eradicate polio.

188
0:10:38.483,000 --> 0:10:4,000
That will make it the second disease in history.

189
0:10:41.197,000 --> 0:10:45,000
And David Heymann, who's watching this on the webcast --

190
0:10:45.36,000 --> 0:10:47,000
David, keep on going. We're close!

191
0:10:48.344,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We're down to four countries.

192
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Applause)

193
0:10:56.431,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I feel like Hank Aaron.

194
0:10:57.67,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Barry Bonds can replace me any time.

195
0:10:59.697,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Let's get another disease off the list of terrible things to worry about.

196
0:11:04.815,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I was just in India working on the polio program.

197
0:11:08.088,000 --> 0:11:13,000
The polio surveillance program is four million people going door to door.

198
0:11:13.875,000 --> 0:11:15,000
That is the surveillance system.

199
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But we need to have early detection, early response.

200
0:11:20.15,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Blindness, the same thing.

201
0:11:21.801,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The key to discovering blindness is doing epidemiological surveys

202
0:11:26.777,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and finding out the causes of blindness,

203
0:11:29,000 --> 0:11:31,000
so you can mount the correct response.

204
0:11:32.261,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The Seva Foundation was started by a group of alumni

205
0:11:36.898,000 --> 0:11:38,000
of the Smallpox Eradication Programme,

206
0:11:39.814,000 --> 0:11:41,000
who, having climbed the highest mountain,

207
0:11:42.529,000 --> 0:11:46,000
tasted the elixir of the success of eradicating a disease,

208
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:48,000
wanted to do it again.

209
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And over the last 27 years, Seva's programs in 15 countries

210
0:11:53.892,000 --> 0:11:56,000
have given back sight to more than two million blind people.

211
0:11:57.982,000 --> 0:12:,000
Seva got started because we wanted to apply these lessons

212
0:12:01.137,000 --> 0:12:03,000
of surveillance and epidemiology

213
0:12:03.756,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to something which nobody else was looking at as a public health issue:

214
0:12:07.705,000 --> 0:12:1,000
blindness, which heretofore had been thought of only as a clinical disease.

215
0:12:12.834,000 --> 0:12:18,000
In 1980, Steve Jobs gave me that computer, which is Apple number 12,

216
0:12:19.13,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and it's still in Kathmandu, and it's still working,

217
0:12:21.607,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and we ought to go get it and auction it off and make more money for Seva.

218
0:12:26.214,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And we conducted the first Nepal survey ever done for health,

219
0:12:30.274,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and the first nationwide blindness survey ever done,

220
0:12:33.155,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and we had astonishing results.

221
0:12:35.562,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Instead of finding out what we thought was the case --

222
0:12:38.297,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that blindness was caused mostly by glaucoma and trachoma --

223
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:44,000
we were astounded to find out

224
0:12:44.488,000 --> 0:12:47,000
that blindness was caused instead by cataract.

225
0:12:49.092,000 --> 0:12:53,000
You can't cure or prevent what you don't know is there.

226
0:12:55.145,000 --> 0:12:59,000
In your TED packages there's a DVD, "Infinite Vision,"

227
0:12:59.365,000 --> 0:13:01,000
about Dr. V and the Aravind Eye Hospital.

228
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I hope that you will take a look at it.

229
0:13:04.056,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Aravind, which started as a Seva project,

230
0:13:06.254,000 --> 0:13:08,000
is now the world's largest and best eye hospital.

231
0:13:09.226,000 --> 0:13:12,000
This year, that one hospital will give back sight

232
0:13:12.647,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to more than 300,000 people in Tamil Nadu, India.

233
0:13:16.222,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Applause)

234
0:13:20.52,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Bird flu.

235
0:13:21.696,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I stand here as a representative of all terrible things --

236
0:13:24.541,000 --> 0:13:25,000
this might be the worst.

237
0:13:26.791,000 --> 0:13:3,000
The key to preventing or mitigating pandemic bird flu

238
0:13:31.569,000 --> 0:13:33,000
is early detection and rapid response.

239
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We will not have a vaccine or adequate supplies of an antiviral

240
0:13:39.827,000 --> 0:13:42,000
to combat bird flu if it occurs in the next three years.

241
0:13:43.342,000 --> 0:13:46,000
WHO stages the progress of a pandemic.

242
0:13:47.346,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We are now at stage three on the pandemic alert stage,

243
0:13:51.763,000 --> 0:13:54,000
with just a little bit of human-to-human transmission,

244
0:13:55.342,000 --> 0:13:58,000
but no human-to-human-to-human sustained transmission.

245
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:03,000
The moment WHO says we've moved to category four --

246
0:14:03.252,000 --> 0:14:05,000
this will not be like Katrina.

247
0:14:05.439,000 --> 0:14:07,000
The world as we know it will stop.

248
0:14:07.542,000 --> 0:14:08,000
There'll be no airplanes flying.

249
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Would you get in an airplane with 250 people you didn't know,

250
0:14:13.173,000 --> 0:14:14,000
coughing and sneezing,

251
0:14:14.349,000 --> 0:14:17,000
when you knew that some of them might carry a disease that could kill you,

252
0:14:17.866,000 --> 0:14:19,000
for which you had no antivirals or vaccine?

253
0:14:21.877,000 --> 0:14:25,000
I did a study of the top epidemiologists in the world in October.

254
0:14:25.918,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I asked them -- these are all fluologists and specialists in influenza --

255
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and I asked them the questions you'd like to ask them:

256
0:14:32.86,000 --> 0:14:35,000
What do you think the likelihood is that there'll be a pandemic?

257
0:14:36.072,000 --> 0:14:38,000
If it happens, how bad do you think it will be?

258
0:14:39.622,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Fifteen percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic within three years.

259
0:14:43.737,000 --> 0:14:44,000
But much worse than that,

260
0:14:45.697,000 --> 0:14:48,000
90 percent said they thought there'd be a pandemic

261
0:14:49.183,000 --> 0:14:51,000
within your children or your grandchildren's lifetime.

262
0:14:53.247,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And they thought that if there was a pandemic,

263
0:14:56.795,000 --> 0:14:58,000
a billion people would get sick.

264
0:14:59.723,000 --> 0:15:02,000
As many as 165 million people would die.

265
0:15:03.85,000 --> 0:15:05,000
There would be a global recession and depression

266
0:15:06.39,000 --> 0:15:08,000
as our just-in-time inventory system

267
0:15:08.592,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and the tight rubber band of globalization broke,

268
0:15:12.434,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and the cost to our economy of one to three trillion dollars

269
0:15:16.402,000 --> 0:15:21,000
would be far worse for everyone than merely 100 million people dying,

270
0:15:22.048,000 --> 0:15:24,000
because so many more people would lose their job

271
0:15:24.374,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and their healthcare benefits,

272
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that the consequences are almost unthinkable.

273
0:15:30.169,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And it's getting worse, because travel is getting so much better.

274
0:15:36.21,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Let me show you a simulation of what a pandemic looks like.

275
0:15:42.746,000 --> 0:15:44,000
So we know what we're talking about.

276
0:15:45.393,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Let's assume, for example, that the first case occurs in South Asia.

277
0:15:50.4,000 --> 0:15:52,000
It initially goes quite slowly.

278
0:15:52.774,000 --> 0:15:54,000
You get two or three discrete locations.

279
0:15:57.128,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Then there'll be secondary outbreaks, and the disease will spread

280
0:16:01.765,000 --> 0:16:05,000
from country to country so fast that you won't know what hit you.

281
0:16:06.51,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Within three weeks it will be everywhere in the world.

282
0:16:10.786,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Now, if we had an "undo" button, and we could go back and isolate it

283
0:16:16.161,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and grab it when it first started -- if we could find it early,

284
0:16:19.542,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and we had early detection and early response,

285
0:16:22,000 --> 0:16:25,000
and we could put each one of those viruses in jail --

286
0:16:25.714,000 --> 0:16:29,000
that's the only way to deal with something like a pandemic.

287
0:16:32.349,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And let me show you why that is.

288
0:16:35.095,000 --> 0:16:36,000
We have a joke.

289
0:16:36.279,000 --> 0:16:38,000
This is an epidemic curve, and everyone in medicine,

290
0:16:39.127,000 --> 0:16:41,000
I think, ultimately gets to know what it is.

291
0:16:41.574,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But the joke is,

292
0:16:42.752,000 --> 0:16:45,000
an epidemiologist likes to arrive at an epidemic right here

293
0:16:45.885,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and ride to glory on the downhill curve.

294
0:16:48.047,000 --> 0:16:49,000
(Laughter)

295
0:16:49.174,000 --> 0:16:5,000
But you don't get to do that usually.

296
0:16:51,000 --> 0:16:52,000
You usually arrive right about here.

297
0:16:53.525,000 --> 0:16:58,000
What we really want is to arrive right here, so we can stop the epidemic.

298
0:16:59.325,000 --> 0:17:,000
But you can't always do that.

299
0:17:01.192,000 --> 0:17:04,000
But there's an organization that has been able to find a way

300
0:17:04.773,000 --> 0:17:06,000
to learn when the first cases occur,

301
0:17:07,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and that is called GPHIN;

302
0:17:09.373,000 --> 0:17:11,000
it's the Global Public Health Information Network.

303
0:17:12.246,000 --> 0:17:14,000
And that simulation that I showed you

304
0:17:14.358,000 --> 0:17:16,000
that you thought was bird flu -- that was SARS.

305
0:17:16.963,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And SARS is the pandemic that did not occur.

306
0:17:20.332,000 --> 0:17:21,000
And it didn't occur

307
0:17:21.755,000 --> 0:17:27,000
because GPHIN found the pandemic-to-be of SARS

308
0:17:28.09,000 --> 0:17:34,000
three months before WHO actually announced it, and because of that,

309
0:17:34.152,000 --> 0:17:37,000
we were able to stop the SARS pandemic.

310
0:17:37.342,000 --> 0:17:39,000
And I think we owe a great debt of gratitude

311
0:17:39.447,000 --> 0:17:41,000
to GPHIN and to Ron St. John,

312
0:17:41.628,000 --> 0:17:44,000
who I hope is in the audience some place -- over there --

313
0:17:45.103,000 --> 0:17:46,000
who's the founder of GPHIN.

314
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:48,000
(Applause)

315
0:17:48.507,000 --> 0:17:49,000
Hello, Ron!

316
0:17:5,000 --> 0:17:56,000
(Applause)

317
0:17:58.61,000 --> 0:18:02,000
And TED has flown Ron here from Ottawa, where GPHIN is located,

318
0:18:03.248,000 --> 0:18:07,000
because not only did GPHIN find SARS early,

319
0:18:07.709,000 --> 0:18:09,000
but you may have seen last week

320
0:18:09.85,000 --> 0:18:13,000
that Iran announced that they had bird flu in Iran,

321
0:18:14.205,000 --> 0:18:17,000
but GPHIN found the bird flu in Iran not February 14 --

322
0:18:17.921,000 --> 0:18:18,000
but last September.

323
0:18:19.802,000 --> 0:18:21,000
We need an early-warning system

324
0:18:22.486,000 --> 0:18:26,000
to protect us against the things that are humanity's worst nightmare.

325
0:18:27.639,000 --> 0:18:3,000
And so my TED wish is based on the common denominator

326
0:18:31.465,000 --> 0:18:32,000
of these experiences.

327
0:18:32.855,000 --> 0:18:34,000
Smallpox -- early detection, early response.

328
0:18:35.765,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Blindness, polio -- early detection, early response.

329
0:18:39.249,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Pandemic bird flu -- early detection, early response.

330
0:18:43.265,000 --> 0:18:44,000
It is a litany.

331
0:18:44.676,000 --> 0:18:49,000
It is so obvious that our only way of dealing with these new diseases

332
0:18:49.714,000 --> 0:18:53,000
is to find them early and to kill them before they spread.

333
0:18:54.065,000 --> 0:18:58,000
So, my TED wish is for you to help build a global system --

334
0:18:58.497,000 --> 0:18:59,000
an early-warning system --

335
0:19:,000 --> 0:19:03,000
to protect us against humanity's worst nightmares.

336
0:19:04.381,000 --> 0:19:1,000
And what I thought I would call it is "Early Detection,"

337
0:19:11.724,000 --> 0:19:13,000
But it should really be called ...

338
0:19:15.223,000 --> 0:19:16,000
"Total Early Detection." [TED]

339
0:19:16.896,000 --> 0:19:17,000
(Laughter)

340
0:19:18.003,000 --> 0:19:19,000
What?

341
0:19:19.178,000 --> 0:19:25,000
(Applause)

342
0:19:26.593,000 --> 0:19:27,000
What?

343
0:19:27.767,000 --> 0:19:29,000
(Applause)

344
0:19:31.219,000 --> 0:19:32,000
But in all seriousness,

345
0:19:33.086,000 --> 0:19:36,000
because this idea is birthed in TED,

346
0:19:36.633,000 --> 0:19:41,000
I would like it to be a legacy of TED, and I'd like to call it

347
0:19:42,000 --> 0:19:47,000
the "International System for Total Early Disease Detection."

348
0:19:47.245,000 --> 0:19:48,000
[INSTEDD]

349
0:19:50.8,000 --> 0:19:54,000
And INSTEDD then becomes our mantra.

350
0:19:58.235,000 --> 0:20:,000
So instead of a hidden pandemic of bird flu,

351
0:20:00.764,000 --> 0:20:02,000
we find it and immediately contain it.

352
0:20:03.723,000 --> 0:20:07,000
Instead of a novel virus caused by bio-terror or bio-error,

353
0:20:08.622,000 --> 0:20:11,000
or shift or drift, we find it and we contain it.

354
0:20:13.268,000 --> 0:20:15,000
Instead of industrial accidents like oil spills

355
0:20:15.778,000 --> 0:20:17,000
or the catastrophe in Bhopal,

356
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:21,000
we find them, and we respond to them.

357
0:20:21.79,000 --> 0:20:24,000
Instead of famine, hidden until it is too late,

358
0:20:24.937,000 --> 0:20:26,000
we detect it, and we respond.

359
0:20:29.061,000 --> 0:20:32,000
And instead of a system which is owned by a government,

360
0:20:32.252,000 --> 0:20:34,000
and hidden in the bowels of government,

361
0:20:34.697,000 --> 0:20:36,000
let's build an early detection system

362
0:20:37.323,000 --> 0:20:4,000
that's freely available to anyone in the world in their own language.

363
0:20:41.858,000 --> 0:20:45,000
Let's make it transparent, non-governmental,

364
0:20:46.65,000 --> 0:20:49,000
not owned by any single country or company,

365
0:20:49.73,000 --> 0:20:52,000
housed in a neutral country, with redundant backup

366
0:20:53.174,000 --> 0:20:56,000
in a different time zone and a different continent.

367
0:20:57.135,000 --> 0:20:58,000
And let's build it on GPHIN.

368
0:20:59.152,000 --> 0:21:,000
Let's start with GPHIN.

369
0:21:01.05,000 --> 0:21:03,000
Let's increase the websites that they crawl

370
0:21:03.988,000 --> 0:21:04,000
from 20,000 to 20 million.

371
0:21:06.498,000 --> 0:21:08,000
Let's increase the languages they crawl

372
0:21:09.031,000 --> 0:21:11,000
from seven to 70, or more.

373
0:21:12.173,000 --> 0:21:15,000
Let's build in outbound confirmation messages,

374
0:21:15.737,000 --> 0:21:18,000
using text messages or SMS or instant messaging

375
0:21:19.025,000 --> 0:21:21,000
to find out from people who are within 100 meters

376
0:21:21.859,000 --> 0:21:22,000
of the rumor that you hear,

377
0:21:23.634,000 --> 0:21:24,000
if it is, in fact, valid.

378
0:21:25,000 --> 0:21:27,000
And let's add satellite confirmation.

379
0:21:27.614,000 --> 0:21:3,000
And we'll add Gapminder's amazing graphics to the front end.

380
0:21:31.545,000 --> 0:21:34,000
And we'll grow it as a moral force in the world,

381
0:21:35.487,000 --> 0:21:37,000
finding out those terrible things

382
0:21:37.603,000 --> 0:21:39,000
before anybody else knows about them,

383
0:21:39.714,000 --> 0:21:41,000
and sending our response to them,

384
0:21:42.164,000 --> 0:21:45,000
so that next year, instead of us meeting here,

385
0:21:45.702,000 --> 0:21:48,000
lamenting how many terrible things there are in the world,

386
0:21:49.28,000 --> 0:21:5,000
we will have pulled together,

387
0:21:51.042,000 --> 0:21:55,000
used the unique skills and the magic of this community,

388
0:21:55.945,000 --> 0:21:58,000
and be proud that we have done everything we can to stop pandemics,

389
0:21:59.391,000 --> 0:22:03,000
other catastrophes, and change the world, beginning right now.

390
0:22:05.083,000 --> 0:22:11,000
(Applause)

391
0:22:23.991,000 --> 0:22:25,000
Chris Anderson: An amazing presentation.

392
0:22:26.2,000 --> 0:22:28,000
First of all, just so everyone understands:

393
0:22:29.007,000 --> 0:22:33,000
you're saying that by creating web crawlers,

394
0:22:33.547,000 --> 0:22:35,000
looking on the Internet for patterns,

395
0:22:36.452,000 --> 0:22:4,000
they can detect something suspicious

396
0:22:40.881,000 --> 0:22:42,000
before WHO, before anyone else can see it?

397
0:22:44.478,000 --> 0:22:46,000
Give an example of how that could possibly be true.

398
0:22:48.174,000 --> 0:22:5,000
Larry Brilliant: You're not mad about the copyright violation?

399
0:22:51.135,000 --> 0:22:52,000
CA: No. I love it.

400
0:22:52.318,000 --> 0:22:53,000
(Laughter)

401
0:22:53.544,000 --> 0:22:54,000
LB: Well, as Ron St. John --

402
0:22:55.121,000 --> 0:22:58,000
I hope you'll go and meet him in the dinner afterwards and talk to him.

403
0:22:58.565,000 --> 0:23:,000
When he started GPHIN --

404
0:23:01.142,000 --> 0:23:05,000
In 1997, there was an outbreak of bird flu -- H5N1.

405
0:23:05.562,000 --> 0:23:06,000
It was in Hong Kong.

406
0:23:06.873,000 --> 0:23:09,000
And a remarkable doctor in Hong Kong responded immediately,

407
0:23:10.079,000 --> 0:23:14,000
by slaughtering 1.5 million chickens and birds,

408
0:23:14.92,000 --> 0:23:16,000
and they stopped that outbreak in its tracks.

409
0:23:17.832,000 --> 0:23:2,000
Immediate detection, immediate response.

410
0:23:21.068,000 --> 0:23:22,000
Then a number of years went by,

411
0:23:22.586,000 --> 0:23:24,000
and there were a lot of rumors about bird flu.

412
0:23:25.584,000 --> 0:23:28,000
Ron and his team in Ottawa began to crawl the web --

413
0:23:29.396,000 --> 0:23:34,000
only crawling 20,000 different websites, mostly periodicals --

414
0:23:34.61,000 --> 0:23:37,000
and they read about and heard about a concern,

415
0:23:37.857,000 --> 0:23:4,000
of a lot of children who had high fever and symptoms of bird flu.

416
0:23:42.613,000 --> 0:23:43,000
They reported this to WHO.

417
0:23:45.161,000 --> 0:23:47,000
WHO took a little while taking action,

418
0:23:47.197,000 --> 0:23:51,000
because WHO will only receive a report from a government,

419
0:23:51.88,000 --> 0:23:52,000
because it's the United Nations.

420
0:23:54.396,000 --> 0:23:57,000
But they were able to point to WHO and let them know

421
0:23:57.822,000 --> 0:24:01,000
that there was this surprising and unexplained cluster of illnesses

422
0:24:02.311,000 --> 0:24:03,000
that looked like bird flu.

423
0:24:04.08,000 --> 0:24:05,000
That turned out to be SARS.

424
0:24:05.838,000 --> 0:24:07,000
That's how the world found out about SARS.

425
0:24:08.805,000 --> 0:24:1,000
And because of that, we were able to stop SARS.

426
0:24:11.739,000 --> 0:24:14,000
Now, what's really important is that, before there was GPHIN,

427
0:24:15.341,000 --> 0:24:19,000
100 percent of all the world's reports of bad things --

428
0:24:19.58,000 --> 0:24:2,000
whether you're talking about famine

429
0:24:21.272,000 --> 0:24:24,000
or you're talking about bird flu or you're talking about Ebola --

430
0:24:24.374,000 --> 0:24:26,000
100 percent of all those reports came from nations.

431
0:24:27.526,000 --> 0:24:28,000
The moment these guys in Ottawa --

432
0:24:29.209,000 --> 0:24:33,000
on a budget of 800,000 dollars a year -- got cracking,

433
0:24:33.614,000 --> 0:24:37,000
75 percent of all the reports in the world came from GPHIN,

434
0:24:37.77,000 --> 0:24:39,000
25 percent of all the reports in the world

435
0:24:40.158,000 --> 0:24:42,000
came from all the other 180 nations.

436
0:24:43.516,000 --> 0:24:44,000
Now, here's what's really interesting:

437
0:24:45.508,000 --> 0:24:47,000
after they'd been working for a couple years,

438
0:24:48.175,000 --> 0:24:5,000
what do you think happened to those nations?

439
0:24:50.297,000 --> 0:24:51,000
They felt pretty stupid.

440
0:24:51.504,000 --> 0:24:53,000
So they started sending in their reports early.

441
0:24:53.741,000 --> 0:24:56,000
And now, their reporting percentage is down to 50 percent,

442
0:24:57.621,000 --> 0:24:59,000
because other nations have started to report.

443
0:25:00.063,000 --> 0:25:04,000
So, can you find diseases early by crawling the web?

444
0:25:04.253,000 --> 0:25:05,000
Of course you can.

445
0:25:05.825,000 --> 0:25:07,000
Can you find it even earlier than GPHIN does now?

446
0:25:08.697,000 --> 0:25:09,000
Of course you can.

447
0:25:09.872,000 --> 0:25:13,000
You saw that they found SARS using their Chinese web crawler

448
0:25:14.501,000 --> 0:25:18,000
a full six weeks before they found it using their English web crawler.

449
0:25:19.793,000 --> 0:25:21,000
Well, they're only crawling in seven languages.

450
0:25:22.206,000 --> 0:25:24,000
These bad viruses really don't have any intention

451
0:25:24.736,000 --> 0:25:26,000
of showing up first in English or Spanish or French.

452
0:25:27.218,000 --> 0:25:28,000
(Laughter)

453
0:25:29.241,000 --> 0:25:33,000
So yes, I want to take GPHIN, I want to build on it.

454
0:25:34.312,000 --> 0:25:37,000
I want to add all the languages of the world that we possibly can.

455
0:25:37.688,000 --> 0:25:39,000
I want to make this open to everybody,

456
0:25:4,000 --> 0:25:42,000
so that the health officer in Nairobi or in Patna, Bihar

457
0:25:43,000 --> 0:25:47,000
will have as much access to it as the folks in Ottawa or in CDC.

458
0:25:47.724,000 --> 0:25:49,000
And I want to make it part of our culture

459
0:25:50.152,000 --> 0:25:53,000
that there is a community of people who are watching out

460
0:25:53.763,000 --> 0:25:55,000
for the worst nightmares of humanity,

461
0:25:56,000 --> 0:25:58,000
and that it's accessible to everyone.

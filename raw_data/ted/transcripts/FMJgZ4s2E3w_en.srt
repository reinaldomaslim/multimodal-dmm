1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
So today, I want us to reflect

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
on the demise of guys.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Guys are flaming out academically;

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
they're wiping out socially with girls

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and sexually with women.

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Other than that, there's not much of a problem.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
So what's the data?

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So the data on dropping out is amazing.

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Boys are 30 percent more likely than girls

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
to drop out of school.

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
In Canada, five boys drop out for every three girls.

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Girls outperform boys now at every level,

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
from elementary school to graduate school.

14
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There's a 10 percent differential

15
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
between getting BA's and all graduate programs,

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
with guys falling behind girls.

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Two-thirds of all students in special ed. remedial programs are guys.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And as you all know,

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
boys are five times more likely than girls

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to be labeled as having attention deficit disorder --

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and therefore we drug them with Ritalin.

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
What's the evidence of wiping out?

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
First, it's a new fear of intimacy.

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Intimacy means physical, emotional connection

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
with somebody else --

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and especially with somebody of the opposite sex

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
who gives off ambiguous, contradictory,

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
phosphorescent signals.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And every year there's research done

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
on self-reported shyness among college students.

32
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And we're seeing a steady increase among males.

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And this is two kinds.

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's a social awkwardness.

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
The old shyness was a fear of rejection.

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It's a social awkwardness like you're a stranger in a foreign land.

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
They don't know what to say, they don't know what to do,

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
especially one-on-one [with the] opposite sex.

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
They don't know the language of face contact,

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
the non-verbal and verbal set of rules

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that enable you to comfortably talk to somebody else,

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
listen to somebody else.

43
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
There's something I'm developing here called social intensity syndrome,

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
which tries to account for why guys really prefer

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
male bonding over female mating.

46
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It turns out, from earliest childhood,

47
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
boys, and then men,

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
prefer the company of guys --

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
physical company.

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And there's actually a cortical arousal we're looking at,

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because guys have been with guys

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
in teams, in clubs, in gangs, in fraternities,

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
especially in the military, and then in pubs.

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And this peaks at Super Bowl Sunday

55
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
when guys would rather be in a bar with strangers,

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
watching a totally overdressed Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers,

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
rather than Jennifer Lopez totally naked in the bedroom.

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The problem is they now prefer

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
[the] asynchronistic Internet world

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to the spontaneous interaction

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in social relationships.

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
What are the causes? Well, it's an unintended consequence.

63
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I think it's excessive Internet use in general, excessive video gaming,

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
excessive new access to pornography.

65
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The problem is these are arousal addictions.

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Drug addiction, you simply want more.

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Arousal addiction, you want different.

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Drugs, you want more of the same -- different.

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So you need the novelty in order for the arousal to be sustained.

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And the problem is the industry is supplying it.

71
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Jane McGonigal told us last year

72
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that by the time a boy is 21,

73
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
he's played 10,000 hours of video games,

74
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
most of that in isolation.

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
As you remember, Cindy Gallop said

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
men don't know the difference

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
between making love and doing porn.

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The average boy now watches 50 porn video clips a week.

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And there's some guy watching a hundred, obviously.

80
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And the porn industry is the fastest growing industry in America --

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
15 billion annually.

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
For every 400 movies made in Hollywood,

84
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
there are 11,000 now made porn videos.

85
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So the effect, very quickly,

86
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
is it's a new kind of arousal.

87
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Boys' brains are being digitally rewired in a totally new way

88
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
for change, novelty, excitement and constant arousal.

89
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
That means they're totally out of sync in traditional classes,

90
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
which are analog, static, interactively passive.

91
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
They're also totally out of sync

92
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in romantic relationships,

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
which build gradually and subtly.

94
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So what's the solution? It's not my job.

95
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I'm here to alarm. It's your job to solve.

96
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Applause)

98
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But who should care? The only people who should care about this

99
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is parents of boys and girls,

100
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
educators, gamers, filmmakers

101
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and women who would like a real man

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
who they can talk to, who can dance,

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
who can make love slowly

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and contribute to the evolutionary pressures

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to keep our species above banana slugs.

106
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
No offense to banana slug owners. Thank you.

107
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Applause)

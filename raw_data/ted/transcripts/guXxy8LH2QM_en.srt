1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
You know who I'm envious of?

2
0:00:15.12,000 --> 0:00:18,000
People who work in a job that has to do with their college major.

3
0:00:18.48,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:20.4,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Journalists who studied journalism,

5
0:00:23,000 --> 0:00:24,000
engineers who studied engineering.

6
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The truth is, these folks are no longer the rule,

7
0:00:28.36,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but the exception.

8
0:00:29.64,000 --> 0:00:32,000
A 2010 study found that only a quarter of college graduates

9
0:00:32.84,000 --> 0:00:34,000
work in a field that relates to their degree.

10
0:00:36.08,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I graduated with not one but two degrees in biology.

11
0:00:40.76,000 --> 0:00:43,000
To my parents' dismay, I am neither a doctor nor a scientist.

12
0:00:44.56,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:46.6,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Years of studying DNA replication and photosynthesis

14
0:00:49.72,000 --> 0:00:51,000
did little to prepare me for a career in technology.

15
0:00:53.12,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I had to teach myself everything from sales, marketing, strategy,

16
0:00:57.48,000 --> 0:00:59,000
even a little programming, on my own.

17
0:01:01.12,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I had never held the title of Product Manager

18
0:01:03.56,000 --> 0:01:04,000
before I sent my resume in to Etsy.

19
0:01:06.88,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I had already been turned down by Google and several other firms

20
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and was getting frustrated.

21
0:01:11.76,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The company had recently gone public,

22
0:01:14.08,000 --> 0:01:15,000
so as part of my job application,

23
0:01:15.88,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I read the IPO filings from cover to cover

24
0:01:19.48,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and built a website from scratch which included my analysis of the business

25
0:01:23.2,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and four ideas for new features.

26
0:01:26.24,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It turned out the team was actively working on two of those ideas

27
0:01:29.8,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and had seriously considered a third.

28
0:01:33.12,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I got the job.

29
0:01:36.56,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We all know people who were ignored or overlooked at first

30
0:01:39.92,000 --> 0:01:41,000
but went on to prove their critics wrong.

31
0:01:42.76,000 --> 0:01:43,000
My favorite story?

32
0:01:45.08,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Brian Acton, an engineering manager

33
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
who was rejected by both Twitter and Facebook

34
0:01:50.88,000 --> 0:01:51,000
before cofounding WhatsApp,

35
0:01:52.52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the mobile messaging platform that would sell for 19 billion dollars.

36
0:01:57.8,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The hiring systems we built in the 20th century are failing us

37
0:02:00.76,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and causing us to miss out on people with incredible potential.

38
0:02:05.32,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The advances in robotics and machine learning

39
0:02:07.48,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and transforming the way we work,

40
0:02:09.48,000 --> 0:02:12,000
automating routine tasks in many occupations

41
0:02:12.52,000 --> 0:02:16,000
while augmenting and amplifying human labor in others.

42
0:02:17.44,000 --> 0:02:21,000
At this rate, we should all be expecting to do jobs we've never done before

43
0:02:21.52,000 --> 0:02:22,000
for the rest of our careers.

44
0:02:24.48,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So what are the tools and strategies we need

45
0:02:26.88,000 --> 0:02:27,000
to identify tomorrow's high performers?

46
0:02:29.8,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In search for answers, I've consulted with leaders across many sectors,

47
0:02:33.92,000 --> 0:02:35,000
read dozens of reports and research papers

48
0:02:36.56,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and conducted some of my own talent experiments.

49
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:41,000
My quest is far from over,

50
0:02:41.92,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but here are three ideas to take forward.

51
0:02:45.28,000 --> 0:02:47,000
One: expand your search.

52
0:02:48.278,000 --> 0:02:5,000
If we only look for talent in the same places we always do --

53
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
gifted child programs, Ivy League schools,

54
0:02:53.44,000 --> 0:02:54,000
prestigious organizations --

55
0:02:55.36,000 --> 0:02:57,000
we're going to get the same results we always have.

56
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Baseball was transformed when the cash-strapped Oakland Athletics

57
0:03:01.72,000 --> 0:03:03,000
started recruiting players who didn't score highly

58
0:03:04.12,000 --> 0:03:06,000
on traditionally valued metrics, like runs batted in,

59
0:03:06.72,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but who had the ability to help the team score points

60
0:03:09.8,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and win games.

61
0:03:11.52,000 --> 0:03:13,000
This idea is taking hold outside of sports.

62
0:03:14.48,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The Head of Design and Research at Pinterest

63
0:03:16.8,000 --> 0:03:18,000
told me that they've built one of the most diverse

64
0:03:19.2,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and high-performing teams in Silicon Valley

65
0:03:21.32,000 --> 0:03:23,000
because they believe that no one type of person

66
0:03:23.72,000 --> 0:03:24,000
holds a monopoly on talent.

67
0:03:26.44,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They've worked hard to look beyond major tech hubs

68
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and focus on designers' portfolios,

69
0:03:31.44,000 --> 0:03:32,000
not their pedigrees.

70
0:03:34.12,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Two: hire for performance.

71
0:03:37.08,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Inspired by my own job experience,

72
0:03:39.36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I cofounded a hiring platform called Headlight,

73
0:03:42.08,000 --> 0:03:44,000
which gives candidates an opportunity to shine.

74
0:03:45.36,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Just as teams have tryouts and plays have auditions,

75
0:03:48.24,000 --> 0:03:5,000
candidates should be asked to demonstrate their skills

76
0:03:50.84,000 --> 0:03:51,000
before they're hired.

77
0:03:52.28,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Our clients are benefiting from 85 years of employment research,

78
0:03:55.68,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which shows that work samples

79
0:03:57.28,000 --> 0:03:59,000
are one of the best predictors of success on the job.

80
0:04:00.8,000 --> 0:04:01,000
If you're hiring a data analyst,

81
0:04:02.4,000 --> 0:04:05,000
give them a spreadsheet of historical data and ask them for their key insights.

82
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
If you're hiring a marketing manager,

83
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
have them plan a launch campaign for a new product.

84
0:04:10.44,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And if you're a candidate, don't wait for an employer to ask.

85
0:04:13.64,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Seek out ways to showcase your unique skills and abilities

86
0:04:17.92,000 --> 0:04:19,000
outside of just the standard resume and cover letter.

87
0:04:21.04,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Three: get the bigger picture.

88
0:04:24.64,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I've heard about recruiters who are quick to label a candidate a job-hopper

89
0:04:28.2,000 --> 0:04:3,000
based on a single short stint on their resume;

90
0:04:30.92,000 --> 0:04:34,000
read about professors who are more likely to ignore identical messages from students

91
0:04:36.32,000 --> 0:04:39,000
because their name was black or Asian instead of white.

92
0:04:40.84,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I was almost put on a special needs track as a child.

93
0:04:44.12,000 --> 0:04:45,000
A month into kindergarten,

94
0:04:45.76,000 --> 0:04:46,000
my teacher wrote a page-long memo

95
0:04:47.4,000 --> 0:04:48,000
noting that I was impulsive,

96
0:04:49.32,000 --> 0:04:5,000
had a short attention span,

97
0:04:51.08,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and despite my wonderful curiosity,

98
0:04:53.2,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I was exhausting to work with.

99
0:04:55.24,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
The principal asked my parents into a meeting,

101
0:05:00.88,000 --> 0:05:02,000
asked my mother if there had been complications at birth

102
0:05:03.76,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and suggested I meet with a school psychologist.

103
0:05:06.76,000 --> 0:05:07,000
My father saw what was happening

104
0:05:08.36,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and quickly explained our family situation.

105
0:05:11.32,000 --> 0:05:13,000
As recent immigrants, we lived in the attic

106
0:05:13.8,000 --> 0:05:16,000
of a home that cared for adults with mental disabilities.

107
0:05:17.32,000 --> 0:05:19,000
My parents worked nights to make ends meet,

108
0:05:19.64,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I had little opportunity to spend time with kids my own age.

109
0:05:23.88,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Is it really a surprise that an understimulated five-year-old boy

110
0:05:27.56,000 --> 0:05:29,000
might be a little excited in a kindergarten classroom

111
0:05:30.12,000 --> 0:05:31,000
after an entire summer by himself?

112
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Until we get a holistic view of someone,

113
0:05:36.44,000 --> 0:05:39,000
our judgment of them will always be flawed.

114
0:05:40.92,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Let's stop equating experience with ability,

115
0:05:45.08,000 --> 0:05:46,000
credentials with competence.

116
0:05:47.72,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Let's stop settling for the safe, familiar choice

117
0:05:51.12,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and leave the door open for someone who could be amazing.

118
0:05:55.52,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We need employers to let go of outdated hiring practices

119
0:05:58.8,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and embrace new ways of identifying and cultivating talent,

120
0:06:03.08,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and candidates can help by learning to tell their story

121
0:06:06.2,000 --> 0:06:07,000
in powerful and compelling ways.

122
0:06:08.92,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We could live in a world where people are seen for what they're truly capable of

123
0:06:13.64,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and have the opportunity to realize their full potential.

124
0:06:18.32,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So let's go out and build it.

125
0:06:21.04,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Thank you.

126
0:06:22.48,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Applause)

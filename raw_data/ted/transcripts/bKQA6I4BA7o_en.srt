1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Phyllis Rodriguez: We are here today

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
because of the fact

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that we have what most people consider

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
an unusual friendship.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And it is.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And yet, it feels natural to us now.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I first learned

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that my son had been in the World Trade Center

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
on the morning of September 11th, 2001.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We didn't know

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
if he had perished yet

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
until 36 hours later.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
At the time,

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we knew that it was political.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We were afraid of what our country was going to do

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in the name of our son --

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
my husband, Orlando, and I and our family.

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And when I saw it --

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and yet, through the shock,

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the terrible shock,

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and the terrible explosion in our lives, literally,

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
we were not vengeful.

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And a couple of weeks later

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism,

26
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the U.S. government called for a death penalty

27
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
for him, if convicted,

28
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
my husband and I spoke out

29
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in opposition to that, publicly.

30
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Through that

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and through human rights groups,

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we were brought together

33
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
with several other victims' families.

34
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
When I saw Aicha in the media,

35
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
coming over when her son was indicted,

36
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and I thought, "What a brave woman.

37
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Someday I want to meet that woman when I'm stronger."

38
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
I was still in deep grief;

39
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I knew I didn't have the strength.

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I knew I would find her someday,

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
or we would find each other.

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Because, when people heard that my son was a victim,

43
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I got immediate sympathy.

44
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But when people learned

45
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
what her son was accused of,

46
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
she didn't get that sympathy.

47
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But her suffering is equal to mine.

48
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So we met in November 2002,

49
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and Aicha will now tell you

50
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
how that came about.

51
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
(Translator) Aicha el-Wafi: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

52
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui.

53
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I asked

54
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the Organization of Human Rights

55
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
to put me in touch with the parents of the victims.

56
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So they introduced me

57
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
to five families.

58
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And I saw Phyllis, and I watched her.

59
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
She was the only mother in the group.

60
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
The others were brothers, sisters.

61
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And I saw in her eyes

62
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that she was a mother, just like me.

63
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I suffered a lot as a mother.

64
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I was married when I was 14.

65
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I lost a child when I was 15,

66
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a second child when I was 16.

67
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So the story with Zacarias was too much really.

68
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And I still suffer,

69
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because my son

70
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
is like he's buried alive.

71
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I know she really cried for her son.

72
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But she knows where he is.

73
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
My son, I don't know where he is.

74
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I don't know if he's alive. I don't know if he's tortured.

75
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I don't know what happened to him.

76
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So that's why I decided to tell my story,

77
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
so that my suffering is something positive for other women.

78
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
For all the women, all the mothers that give life,

79
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
you can give back,

80
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
you can change.

81
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It's up to us women,

82
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because we are women,

83
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because we love our children.

84
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We must be hand-in-hand

85
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and do something together.

86
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It's not against women,

87
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
it's for us, for us women,

88
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
for our children.

89
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I talk against violence, against terrorism.

90
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I go to schools

91
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
to talk to young, Muslim girls

92
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
so they don't accept to be married against their will very young.

93
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So if I can save one of the young girls,

94
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did,

95
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
well this is something good.

96
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This is why I'm here in front of you.

97
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
PR: I would like to say

98
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that I have learned so much from Aicha,

99
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
starting with that day we had our very first meeting

100
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
with other family members --

101
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
which was a very private meeting with security,

102
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
because it was November 2002,

103
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and, frankly, we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country --

104
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
those of us family members.

105
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But we were all so nervous.

106
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
"Why does she want to meet us?"

107
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And then she was nervous.

108
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
"Why did we want to meet her?"

109
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
What did we want from each other?

110
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Before we knew each others' names, or anything,

111
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we had embraced and wept.

112
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
Then we sat in a circle

113
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
with support, with help,

114
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation.

115
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And Aicha started,

116
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and she said,

117
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
"I don't know if my son

118
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is guilty or innocent,

119
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but I want to tell you how sorry I am

120
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
for what happened to your families.

121
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I know what it is to suffer,

122
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and I feel that if there is a crime,

123
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
a person should be tried fairly and punished."

124
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But she reached out to us in that way,

125
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and it was, I'd like to say, it was an ice-breaker.

126
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And what happened then is we all told our stories,

127
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and we all connected as human beings.

128
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
By the end of the afternoon --

129
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
it was about three hours after lunch --

130
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
we'd felt as if we'd known each other forever.

131
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Now what I learned from her,

132
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is a woman, not only who could be so generous

133
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
under these present circumstances

134
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and what it was then,

135
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and what was being done to her son,

136
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
but the life she's had.

137
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I never had met

138
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
someone with such a hard life,

139
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
from such a totally different culture and environment from my own.

140
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And I feel

141
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that we have

142
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
a special connection,

143
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
which I value very much.

144
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And I think it's all about

145
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
being afraid of the other,

146
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but making that step

147
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and then realizing, "Hey, this wasn't so hard.

148
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Who else can I meet that I don't know,

149
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
or that I'm so different from?"

150
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So, Aicha,

151
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
do you have a couple of words

152
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
for conclusion?

153
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Because our time is up.

154
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
(Laughter)

155
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Translator) AW: I wanted to say

156
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that we have to try to know other people, the other.

157
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You have to be generous,

158
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and your hearts must be generous,

159
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
your mind must be generous.

160
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
You must be tolerant.

161
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
You have to fight against violence.

162
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And I hope that someday we'll all live together

163
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
in peace and respecting each other.

164
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
This is what I wanted to say.

165
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.793,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Pollinator decline is a grand challenge in the modern world.

2
0:00:16.987,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Of the 200,000 species of pollinators,

3
0:00:19.92,000 --> 0:00:21,000
honeybees are the most well-understood,

4
0:00:22.78,000 --> 0:00:26,000
partly because of our long history with them dating back 8,000 years ago

5
0:00:26.997,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to our cave drawings in what is now modern-day Spain.

6
0:00:30.189,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And yet we know that this indicator species is dying off.

7
0:00:34.543,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Last year alone, we lost 40 percent of all beehives in the United States.

8
0:00:39.842,000 --> 0:00:41,000
That number is even higher in areas with harsh winters,

9
0:00:42.565,000 --> 0:00:43,000
like here in Massachusetts,

10
0:00:43.949,000 --> 0:00:45,000
where we lost 47 percent of beehives

11
0:00:46.841,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in one year alone.

12
0:00:48.46,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Can you imagine if we lost half of our people last year?

13
0:00:52.285,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And if those were the food-producing people?

14
0:00:55.544,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's untenable.

15
0:00:57.241,000 --> 0:01:,000
And I predict that in 10 years,

16
0:01:00.713,000 --> 0:01:02,000
we will lose our bees.

17
0:01:04.027,000 --> 0:01:08,000
If not for the work of beekeepers replacing these dead beehives,

18
0:01:08.364,000 --> 0:01:1,000
we would be without foods that we rely upon:

19
0:01:11.303,000 --> 0:01:12,000
fruits, vegetables,

20
0:01:13.149,000 --> 0:01:15,000
crunchy almonds and nuts,

21
0:01:15.434,000 --> 0:01:16,000
tart apples,

22
0:01:16.862,000 --> 0:01:17,000
sour lemons.

23
0:01:18.862,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Even the food that our cattle rely upon to eat, hay and alfalfa -- gone,

24
0:01:24.14,000 --> 0:01:25,000
causing global hunger,

25
0:01:26.129,000 --> 0:01:27,000
economic collapse,

26
0:01:27.955,000 --> 0:01:29,000
a total moral crisis across earth.

27
0:01:31.417,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Now, I first started keeping bees here in Cape Cod

28
0:01:34.175,000 --> 0:01:37,000
right after I finished my doctorate in honeybee immunology.

29
0:01:37.584,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:40.04,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Applause)

31
0:01:45.56,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Imagine getting such a degree in a good economy --

32
0:01:49.554,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and it was 2009:

33
0:01:52.242,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the Great Recession.

34
0:01:54.456,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And I was onto something.

35
0:01:56.041,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I knew that I could find out how to improve bee health.

36
0:01:59.738,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And so the community on Cape Cod here in Provincetown

37
0:02:03.117,000 --> 0:02:04,000
was ripe for citizen science,

38
0:02:04.807,000 --> 0:02:06,000
people looking for ways to get involved and to help.

39
0:02:07.671,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And so we met with people in coffee shops.

40
0:02:10.032,000 --> 0:02:13,000
A wonderful woman named Natalie got eight beehives at her home in Truro,

41
0:02:13.619,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and she introduced us to her friend Valerie,

42
0:02:15.729,000 --> 0:02:2,000
who let us set up 60 beehives at an abandoned tennis court on her property.

43
0:02:21.902,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And so we started testing vaccines for bees.

44
0:02:25.087,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We were starting to look at probiotics.

45
0:02:27.63,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We called it "bee yogurt" --

46
0:02:29.27,000 --> 0:02:31,000
ways to make bees healthier.

47
0:02:31.798,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And our citizen science project started to take off.

48
0:02:35.375,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Meanwhile, back in my apartment here,

49
0:02:38.081,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I was a bit nervous about my landlord.

50
0:02:40.968,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I figured I should tell him what we were doing.

51
0:02:43.34,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:44.393,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I was terrified; I really thought I was going to get an eviction notice,

53
0:02:47.879,000 --> 0:02:49,000
which really was the last thing we needed, right?

54
0:02:50.213,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I must have caught him on a good day, though,

55
0:02:52.365,000 --> 0:02:54,000
because when I told him what we were doing

56
0:02:54.405,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and how we started our nonprofit urban beekeeping laboratory,

57
0:02:57.313,000 --> 0:03:,000
he said, "That's great! Let's get a beehive in the back alley."

58
0:03:01.236,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I was shocked.

59
0:03:02.645,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I was completely surprised.

60
0:03:04.467,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I mean, instead of getting an eviction notice,

61
0:03:06.658,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we got another data point.

62
0:03:08.366,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And in the back alley of this image,

63
0:03:10.715,000 --> 0:03:12,000
what you see here, this hidden beehive --

64
0:03:13.344,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that beehive produced more honey that first year

65
0:03:15.938,000 --> 0:03:18,000
than we have ever experienced in any beehive we had managed.

66
0:03:19.12,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It shifted our research perspective forever.

67
0:03:21.768,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It changed our research question away from "How do we save the dead and dying bees?"

68
0:03:26.659,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to "Where are bees doing best?"

69
0:03:29.002,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And we started to be able to put maps together,

70
0:03:31.965,000 --> 0:03:33,000
looking at all of these citizen science beehives

71
0:03:34.311,000 --> 0:03:36,000
from people who had beehives at home decks,

72
0:03:36.763,000 --> 0:03:38,000
gardens, business rooftops.

73
0:03:38.864,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We started to engage the public,

74
0:03:40.458,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and the more people who got these little data points,

75
0:03:43.069,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the more accurate our maps became.

76
0:03:44.746,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And so when you're sitting here thinking, "How can I get involved?"

77
0:03:47.945,000 --> 0:03:49,000
you might think about a story of my friend Fred,

78
0:03:50.238,000 --> 0:03:51,000
who's a commercial real estate developer.

79
0:03:52.247,000 --> 0:03:54,000
He was thinking the same thing.

80
0:03:54.347,000 --> 0:03:55,000
He was at a meeting,

81
0:03:55.76,000 --> 0:03:57,000
thinking about what he could do for tenant relations

82
0:03:58.334,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and sustainability at scale.

83
0:04:00.167,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And while he was having a tea break,

84
0:04:01.937,000 --> 0:04:04,000
he put honey into his tea and noticed on the honey jar

85
0:04:05.125,000 --> 0:04:08,000
a message about corporate sustainability from the host company of that meeting.

86
0:04:08.957,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And it sparked an idea.

87
0:04:10.951,000 --> 0:04:11,000
He came back to his office.

88
0:04:12.638,000 --> 0:04:15,000
An email, a phone call later, and -- boom! --

89
0:04:15.956,000 --> 0:04:16,000
we went national together.

90
0:04:18.322,000 --> 0:04:21,000
We put dozens of beehives on the rooftops of their skyscrapers

91
0:04:21.616,000 --> 0:04:23,000
across nine cities nationwide.

92
0:04:24.629,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Nine years later --

93
0:04:25.959,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Applause)

94
0:04:31.74,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Nine years later, we have raised over a million dollars for bee research.

95
0:04:36.578,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We have a thousand beehives as little data points across the country,

96
0:04:41.763,000 --> 0:04:42,000
18 states and counting,

97
0:04:43.176,000 --> 0:04:47,000
where we have created paying jobs for local beekeepers, 65 of them,

98
0:04:47.482,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to manage beehives in their own communities,

99
0:04:50.236,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to connect with people, everyday people,

100
0:04:53.077,000 --> 0:04:57,000
who are now data points together making a difference.

101
0:04:57.866,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So in order to explain what's actually been saving bees,

102
0:05:00.511,000 --> 0:05:01,000
where they're thriving,

103
0:05:01.697,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I need to first tell you what's been killing them.

104
0:05:04.148,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The top three killers of bees

105
0:05:06.052,000 --> 0:05:09,000
are agricultural chemicals such as pesticides, herbicides, fungicides;

106
0:05:09.945,000 --> 0:05:11,000
diseases of bees, of which there are many;

107
0:05:12.342,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and habitat loss.

108
0:05:13.902,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So what we did is we looked on our maps

109
0:05:15.997,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and we identified areas where bees were thriving.

110
0:05:18.383,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This was mostly in cities, we found.

111
0:05:21.173,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Data are now showing that urban beehives produce more honey

112
0:05:24.152,000 --> 0:05:26,000
than rural beehives and suburban beehives.

113
0:05:26.837,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Urban beehives have a longer life span than rural and suburban beehives,

114
0:05:31.782,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and bees in the city are more biodiverse;

115
0:05:34.219,000 --> 0:05:36,000
there are more bee species in urban areas.

116
0:05:36.986,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:38.461,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Right?

118
0:05:39.724,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Why is this?

119
0:05:41.711,000 --> 0:05:42,000
That was our question.

120
0:05:43.035,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So we started with these three killers of bees,

121
0:05:45.267,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and we flipped it:

122
0:05:46.446,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Which of these is different in the cities?

123
0:05:48.605,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So the first one, pesticides.

124
0:05:50.175,000 --> 0:05:52,000
We partnered up with the Harvard School of Public Health.

125
0:05:52.877,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We shared our data with them.

126
0:05:54.394,000 --> 0:05:56,000
We collected samples from our citizen science beehives

127
0:05:57,000 --> 0:05:58,000
at people's homes and business rooftops.

128
0:05:58.97,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We looked at pesticide levels.

129
0:06:00.441,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We thought there would be less pesticides in areas where bees are doing better.

130
0:06:04.267,000 --> 0:06:05,000
That's not the case.

131
0:06:05.454,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So what we found here in our study is -- the orange bars are Boston,

132
0:06:09.528,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and we thought those bars would be the lowest,

133
0:06:11.807,000 --> 0:06:13,000
there would be the lowest levels of pesticides.

134
0:06:14.065,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And, in fact, there are the most pesticides in cities.

135
0:06:18.599,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So the pesticide hypothesis for what's saving bees --

136
0:06:21.385,000 --> 0:06:22,000
less pesticides in cities --

137
0:06:22.808,000 --> 0:06:23,000
is not it.

138
0:06:24.237,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And this is very typical of my life as a scientist.

139
0:06:28.131,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Anytime I've had a hypothesis,

140
0:06:30.045,000 --> 0:06:33,000
not only is it not supported, but the opposite is true.

141
0:06:33.389,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:34.434,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Which is still an interesting finding, right?

143
0:06:36.593,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We moved on.

144
0:06:37.777,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The disease hypothesis.

145
0:06:38.975,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We looked at diseases all over our beehives.

146
0:06:41.294,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And what we found in a similar study to this one with North Carolina State is:

147
0:06:45.431,000 --> 0:06:47,000
there's no difference between disease in bees

148
0:06:47.581,000 --> 0:06:48,000
in urban, suburban and rural areas.

149
0:06:49.356,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Diseases are everywhere; bees are sick and dying.

150
0:06:51.982,000 --> 0:06:53,000
In fact, there were more diseases of bees in cities.

151
0:06:54.472,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This was from Raleigh, North Carolina.

152
0:06:56.528,000 --> 0:06:59,000
So again, my hypothesis was not supported. The opposite was true.

153
0:07:00.539,000 --> 0:07:01,000
We're moving on.

154
0:07:02.012,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Laughter)

155
0:07:04.294,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The habitat hypothesis.

156
0:07:06.412,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This said that areas where bees are thriving have a better habitat --

157
0:07:10.087,000 --> 0:07:11,000
more flowers, right?

158
0:07:11.726,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But we didn't know how to test this.

159
0:07:13.548,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So I had a really interesting meeting.

160
0:07:15.632,000 --> 0:07:18,000
An idea sparked with my friend and colleague Anne Madden,

161
0:07:18.773,000 --> 0:07:19,000
fellow TED speaker.

162
0:07:19.98,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We thought about genomics, kind of like AncestryDNA or 23andMe.

163
0:07:24.656,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Have you done these?

164
0:07:26.015,000 --> 0:07:28,000
You spit in a tube and you find out, "I'm German!"

165
0:07:28.675,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

166
0:07:29.802,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Well, we developed this for honey.

167
0:07:31.675,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So we have a sample of honey and we look at all the plant DNA,

168
0:07:35.245,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and we find out, "I'm sumac!"

169
0:07:37.114,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Laughter)

170
0:07:38.408,000 --> 0:07:4,000
And that's what we found here in Provincetown.

171
0:07:40.816,000 --> 0:07:42,000
So for the first time ever, I'm able to report to you

172
0:07:43.379,000 --> 0:07:45,000
what type of honey is from right here in our own community.

173
0:07:46.193,000 --> 0:07:48,000
HoneyDNA, a genomics test.

174
0:07:48.65,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Spring honey in Provincetown is from privet.

175
0:07:51.31,000 --> 0:07:53,000
What's privet? Hedges.

176
0:07:53.705,000 --> 0:07:54,000
What's the message?

177
0:07:54.884,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Don't trim your hedges to save the bees.

178
0:07:57.48,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Laughter)

179
0:07:58.614,000 --> 0:08:,000
I know we're getting crunchy and it's controversial,

180
0:08:01.086,000 --> 0:08:02,000
so before you throw your tomatoes,

181
0:08:02.736,000 --> 0:08:04,000
we'll move to the summer honey, which is water lily honey.

182
0:08:05.496,000 --> 0:08:07,000
If you have honey from Provincetown right here in the summer,

183
0:08:08.4,000 --> 0:08:09,000
you're eating water lily juice;

184
0:08:10.193,000 --> 0:08:12,000
in the fall, sumac honey.

185
0:08:12.632,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We're learning about our food for the first time ever.

186
0:08:15.805,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And now we're able to report, if you need to do any city planning:

187
0:08:19.309,000 --> 0:08:2,000
What are good things to plant?

188
0:08:21.036,000 --> 0:08:24,000
What do we know the bees are going to that's good for your garden?

189
0:08:24.943,000 --> 0:08:27,000
For the first time ever for any community, we now know this answer.

190
0:08:28.291,000 --> 0:08:31,000
What's more interesting for us is deeper in the data.

191
0:08:31.697,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So, if you're from the Caribbean and you want to explore your heritage,

192
0:08:35.087,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Bahamian honey is from the laurel family,

193
0:08:37.825,000 --> 0:08:39,000
cinnamon and avocado flavors.

194
0:08:40.484,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But what's more interesting is 85 different plant species

195
0:08:43.456,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in one teaspoon of honey.

196
0:08:45.146,000 --> 0:08:47,000
That's the measure we want, the big data.

197
0:08:47.681,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Indian honey: that is oak.

198
0:08:50.68,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Every sample we've tested from India is oak,

199
0:08:53.158,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and that's 172 different flavors in one taste of Indian honey.

200
0:08:57.635,000 --> 0:09:,000
Provincetown honey goes from 116 plants in the spring

201
0:09:01.209,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to over 200 plants in the summer.

202
0:09:04.174,000 --> 0:09:07,000
These are the numbers that we need to test the habitat hypothesis.

203
0:09:07.646,000 --> 0:09:08,000
In another citizen science approach,

204
0:09:09.419,000 --> 0:09:12,000
you find out about your food and we get some interesting data.

205
0:09:12.711,000 --> 0:09:14,000
We're finding out now that in rural areas,

206
0:09:14.969,000 --> 0:09:17,000
there are 150 plants on average in a sample of honey.

207
0:09:18.504,000 --> 0:09:19,000
That's a measure for rural.

208
0:09:20.048,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Suburban areas, what might you think?

209
0:09:22.138,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Do they have less or more plants in suburban areas with lawns

210
0:09:26.292,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that look nice for people but they're terrible for pollinators?

211
0:09:30.326,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Suburbs have very low plant diversity,

212
0:09:32.94,000 --> 0:09:33,000
so if you have a beautiful lawn,

213
0:09:34.843,000 --> 0:09:36,000
good for you, but you can do more.

214
0:09:37.846,000 --> 0:09:4,000
You can have a patch of your lawn that's a wildflower meadow

215
0:09:40.982,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to diversify your habitat,

216
0:09:42.438,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to improve pollinator health.

217
0:09:44.683,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Anybody can do this.

218
0:09:46.621,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Urban areas have the most habitat, best habitat,

219
0:09:50.738,000 --> 0:09:52,000
as you can see here: over 200 different plants.

220
0:09:53.32,000 --> 0:09:56,000
We have, for the first time ever, support for the habitat hypothesis.

221
0:09:57.407,000 --> 0:10:,000
We also now know how we can work with cities.

222
0:10:00.654,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The City of Boston has eight times better habitat

223
0:10:03.083,000 --> 0:10:04,000
than its nearby suburbs.

224
0:10:04.417,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And so when we work with governments, we can scale this.

225
0:10:08.195,000 --> 0:10:1,000
You might think on my tombstone, it'll say,

226
0:10:10.228,000 --> 0:10:12,000
"Here lies Noah. Plant a flower." Right?

227
0:10:12.589,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I mean -- it's exhausting after all of this.

228
0:10:16.255,000 --> 0:10:17,000
But when we scale together,

229
0:10:17.912,000 --> 0:10:19,000
when we go to governments and city planners --

230
0:10:20.131,000 --> 0:10:22,000
like in Boston, the honey is mostly linden trees,

231
0:10:22.481,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and we say, "If a dead tree needs to be replaced, consider linden."

232
0:10:25.931,000 --> 0:10:28,000
When we take this information to governments, we can do amazing things.

233
0:10:29.376,000 --> 0:10:3,000
This is a rooftop from Fred's company.

234
0:10:31.249,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We can plant those things on top of rooftops worldwide

235
0:10:34.987,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to start restoring habitat and securing food systems.

236
0:10:38.072,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We've worked with the World Bank

237
0:10:39.628,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and the presidential delegation from the country of Haiti.

238
0:10:42.394,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We've worked with wonderful graduate students at Yale University and Ethiopia.

239
0:10:46.172,000 --> 0:10:48,000
In these countries, we can add value to their honey

240
0:10:48.609,000 --> 0:10:49,000
by identifying what it is,

241
0:10:49.905,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but informing the people of what to plant

242
0:10:51.917,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to restore their habitat and secure their food systems.

243
0:10:55.123,000 --> 0:10:58,000
But what I think is even more important is when we think about natural disasters.

244
0:10:59.015,000 --> 0:11:,000
For the first time,

245
0:11:00.19,000 --> 0:11:03,000
we now know how we can have a baseline measure of any habitat

246
0:11:03.266,000 --> 0:11:04,000
before it might be destroyed.

247
0:11:05.282,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Think about your hometown.

248
0:11:06.983,000 --> 0:11:09,000
What risks does the environment pose to it?

249
0:11:10.434,000 --> 0:11:13,000
This is how we're going to save Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.

250
0:11:14.541,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We now have a baseline measure of honey,

251
0:11:17.414,000 --> 0:11:19,000
honey DNA from before and after the storm.

252
0:11:20.193,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We started in Humacao.

253
0:11:22.227,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This is right where Hurricane Maria made landfall.

254
0:11:24.774,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And we know what plants to replace and in what quantity and where

255
0:11:28.607,000 --> 0:11:3,000
by triangulating honey DNA samples.

256
0:11:32.112,000 --> 0:11:34,000
You might even think about right here,

257
0:11:34.136,000 --> 0:11:36,000
the beautiful land that connected us, that primed us,

258
0:11:36.827,000 --> 0:11:37,000
all the citizen science to begin with,

259
0:11:38.718,000 --> 0:11:4,000
the erosion, the winter storms

260
0:11:40.891,000 --> 0:11:42,000
that are getting more violent every year.

261
0:11:43.169,000 --> 0:11:44,000
What are we going to do about this,

262
0:11:45.068,000 --> 0:11:46,000
our precious land?

263
0:11:46.871,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Well, looking at honey DNA,

264
0:11:48.234,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we can see what plants are good for pollinators that have deep roots,

265
0:11:51.558,000 --> 0:11:52,000
that can secure the land,

266
0:11:53.393,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and together, everybody can participate.

267
0:11:55.626,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And the solution fits in a teaspoon.

268
0:11:58.506,000 --> 0:12:02,000
If your hometown might get swept away or destroyed by a natural disaster,

269
0:12:03.324,000 --> 0:12:06,000
we now have a blueprint suspended in time

270
0:12:06.645,000 --> 0:12:08,000
for how to restore that on Earth,

271
0:12:09.197,000 --> 0:12:13,000
or perhaps even in a greenhouse on Mars.

272
0:12:14.025,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I know it sounds crazy, but think about this:

273
0:12:17.544,000 --> 0:12:18,000
a new Provincetown,

274
0:12:19.401,000 --> 0:12:2,000
a new hometown,

275
0:12:21.067,000 --> 0:12:24,000
a place that might be familiar that's also good for pollinators

276
0:12:24.569,000 --> 0:12:25,000
for a stable food system,

277
0:12:25.957,000 --> 0:12:27,000
when we're thinking about the future.

278
0:12:29.23,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Now, together, we know what's saving bees --

279
0:12:32.546,000 --> 0:12:33,000
by planting diverse habitat.

280
0:12:34.741,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Now, together, we know how bees are going to save us --

281
0:12:38.88,000 --> 0:12:41,000
by being barometers for environmental health,

282
0:12:42.085,000 --> 0:12:44,000
by being blueprints, sources of information,

283
0:12:44.784,000 --> 0:12:46,000
little data factories suspended in time.

284
0:12:48.148,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Thank you.

285
0:12:49.337,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Applause)

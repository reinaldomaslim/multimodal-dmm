0:00:12.142,000 --> 0:00:14,000
[This talk contains mature content]

2
0:00:16.175,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I have a vagina.

3
0:00:17.373,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:18.667,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Just thought you should know.

5
0:00:21.199,000 --> 0:00:23,000
That might not come as a surprise to some of you.

6
0:00:23.699,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I look like a woman.

7
0:00:26.054,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm dressed like one, I guess.

8
0:00:29.062,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The thing is, I also have balls.

9
0:00:31.919,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And it does take a lot of nerve

10
0:00:34.302,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to come up here and talk to you about my genitalia.

11
0:00:37.887,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Just a little.

12
0:00:39.601,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But I'm not talking about bravery or courage.

13
0:00:42.554,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I mean literally -- I have balls.

14
0:00:45.268,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Right here,

15
0:00:46.593,000 --> 0:00:48,000
right where a lot of you have ovaries.

16
0:00:49.157,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I'm not male or female.

17
0:00:51.14,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'm intersex.

18
0:00:53.316,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Most people assume that you're biologically either a man or a woman,

19
0:00:57.165,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but it's actually a lot more complex than that.

20
0:01:01.395,000 --> 0:01:03,000
There are so many ways somebody could be intersex.

21
0:01:03.935,000 --> 0:01:06,000
In my case, it means I was born with XY chromosomes,

22
0:01:07.006,000 --> 0:01:09,000
which you probably know as male chromosomes.

23
0:01:09.562,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And I was born with a vagina and balls inside my body.

24
0:01:14.49,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I don't respond to testosterone,

25
0:01:16.808,000 --> 0:01:19,000
so during puberty, I grew breasts,

26
0:01:19.863,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but I never got acne or body hair, body oil.

27
0:01:24.22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
You can be jealous of that.

28
0:01:25.854,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:27.903,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But even though I don't actually have a uterus --

30
0:01:30.316,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I was born without one,

31
0:01:31.49,000 --> 0:01:34,000
so I don't menstruate, I can't have biological children.

32
0:01:36.308,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We put people in boxes based on their genitalia.

33
0:01:39.695,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Before a baby's even born, we ask whether it's a boy or a girl,

34
0:01:43.489,000 --> 0:01:45,000
as if it actually matters;

35
0:01:45.529,000 --> 0:01:47,000
as if you're going to be less excited about having a baby

36
0:01:48.275,000 --> 0:01:5,000
if it doesn't have the genitals you wanted;

37
0:01:50.45,000 --> 0:01:54,000
as if what's between somebody's legs tells you anything about that person.

38
0:01:55.212,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Are they kind, generous, funny?

39
0:01:58.712,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Smart?

40
0:02:00.062,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Who do they want to be when they grow up?

41
0:02:02.546,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Genitals don't actually tell you anything.

42
0:02:05.109,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Yet, we define ourselves by them.

43
0:02:08.79,000 --> 0:02:1,000
In this society, we love putting people into boxes

44
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and labeling each other.

45
0:02:12.591,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It kind of gives us a sense of belonging

46
0:02:15.218,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and teaches us how to interact with one another.

47
0:02:19.479,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But there's one really big problem:

48
0:02:22.074,000 --> 0:02:25,000
biological sex is not black or white.

49
0:02:26.114,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It's on a spectrum.

50
0:02:28.098,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Besides your genitalia, you also have your chromosomes,

51
0:02:31.612,000 --> 0:02:33,000
your gonads, like ovaries or testicles.

52
0:02:34.231,000 --> 0:02:35,000
You have your internal sex organs,

53
0:02:36.104,000 --> 0:02:39,000
your hormone production, your hormone response

54
0:02:39.422,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and your secondary sex characteristics, like breast development, body hair, etc.

55
0:02:44.538,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Those seven areas of biological sex all have so much variation,

56
0:02:49.61,000 --> 0:02:5,000
yet we only get two options:

57
0:02:51.56,000 --> 0:02:52,000
male or female.

58
0:02:53.435,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Which is kind of absurd to me,

59
0:02:55.149,000 --> 0:02:57,000
because I can't think of a single other human trait

60
0:02:57.879,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that there's only two options for:

61
0:03:00.141,000 --> 0:03:03,000
skin color, hair, height, eyes.

62
0:03:03.866,000 --> 0:03:07,000
You can either have nose A or nose B, that's it, no other options.

63
0:03:08.866,000 --> 0:03:11,000
If there are infinite ways for our bodies to look,

64
0:03:12.041,000 --> 0:03:13,000
our minds to think,

65
0:03:13.716,000 --> 0:03:14,000
personalities to act,

66
0:03:15.629,000 --> 0:03:17,000
wouldn't it make sense that there's that much variety

67
0:03:18.145,000 --> 0:03:19,000
in biological sex, too?

68
0:03:22.141,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Did you know that besides XX or XY chromosomes,

69
0:03:26.117,000 --> 0:03:29,000
you could have XX and XY chromosomes?

70
0:03:29.823,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Or you could have an extra X -- XXY.

71
0:03:32.308,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Or two extra -- XXXY.

72
0:03:34.854,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Goes on from there.

73
0:03:36.086,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And for those "normal" people with XX or XY,

74
0:03:38.797,000 --> 0:03:39,000
what does that mean?

75
0:03:40.45,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I have XY chromosomes.

76
0:03:42.101,000 --> 0:03:45,000
If my DNA is found at the scene of a crime --

77
0:03:45.479,000 --> 0:03:47,000
not saying it will, but, you know, we'll see.

78
0:03:48.012,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:49.796,000 --> 0:03:53,000
If my skeleton is discovered thousands of years from now,

80
0:03:53.91,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I'll be labeled male.

81
0:03:56.125,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Is that the truth?

82
0:03:57.99,000 --> 0:03:58,000
My balls would say so.

83
0:04:00.093,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But what about the rest of me?

84
0:04:02.617,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And what if a woman has ovarian cancer and has to have her ovaries removed?

85
0:04:06.95,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Does she still qualify as a woman?

86
0:04:09.609,000 --> 0:04:12,000
What about other intersex people who are born without balls or ovaries

87
0:04:13.109,000 --> 0:04:15,000
or with just one or a combination of the two?

88
0:04:16.379,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Where do they go?

89
0:04:18.647,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Do you have to have a uterus to be a woman?

90
0:04:20.734,000 --> 0:04:22,000
There's a lot of us who are born without one.

91
0:04:23.726,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And everyone's favorite part, genitalia:

92
0:04:26.67,000 --> 0:04:27,000
you either have one or the other, right?

93
0:04:28.641,000 --> 0:04:31,000
You either have a six-inch-long penis that's exactly this thick,

94
0:04:31.776,000 --> 0:04:33,000
jutting straight out of the body at a 90-degree angle,

95
0:04:34.435,000 --> 0:04:36,000
or you have a vagina that's this wide internally

96
0:04:36.792,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and a clitoris that's half an inch above the vaginal opening

97
0:04:39.681,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and labia that look exactly like they're supposed to look like,

98
0:04:42.665,000 --> 0:04:44,000
according to that one porn video you watched that one time.

99
0:04:45.53,000 --> 0:04:46,000
You know the one.

100
0:04:46.723,000 --> 0:04:49,000
If you've been with more than one sexual partner in your lifetime,

101
0:04:50.101,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and you line them up, one by one,

102
0:04:52.062,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I guarantee you can identify them just by their genitalia.

103
0:04:55.571,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:56.774,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Think about it.

105
0:04:58.211,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Go on.

106
0:04:59.387,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:00.777,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I see you.

108
0:05:02.253,000 --> 0:05:03,000
No judging.

109
0:05:04.253,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Just notice.

110
0:05:05.649,000 --> 0:05:06,000
All different, right?

111
0:05:08.633,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The sex and gender binary are both so ingrained in our society,

112
0:05:12.823,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that we never stop to think about it.

113
0:05:14.895,000 --> 0:05:17,000
We just automatically place each other into one box or the other,

114
0:05:18.538,000 --> 0:05:2,000
as if it actually matters.

115
0:05:21.436,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Until somebody comes along to make you question it.

116
0:05:25.841,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And if you're thinking that I'm the exception, an anomaly, an outlier:

117
0:05:31.544,000 --> 0:05:35,000
intersex people represent around two percent of the population.

118
0:05:36.673,000 --> 0:05:39,000
That's the same percentage as genetic redheads.

119
0:05:40.649,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It's about 150 million people, roughly,

120
0:05:44.792,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which is more than the entire population of Russia.

121
0:05:48.474,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So there's a lot of us, needless to say.

122
0:05:52.558,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We're not new or rare.

123
0:05:54.984,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We're just invisible.

124
0:05:57.587,000 --> 0:06:,000
We've existed throughout every culture in history.

125
0:06:01.373,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Yet, we never talk about it.

126
0:06:04.437,000 --> 0:06:07,000
In fact, a lot of people might not know that they're intersex.

127
0:06:07.831,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Have you had a karyotype test to determine your chromosomes?

128
0:06:12.632,000 --> 0:06:15,000
What about a full blood panel for all of your hormone levels?

129
0:06:16.428,000 --> 0:06:19,000
A friend of mine found out last year, in his 50s.

130
0:06:20.254,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The executive director of interACT,

131
0:06:21.952,000 --> 0:06:25,000
which is the leading organization for intersex human rights here in the US,

132
0:06:26.506,000 --> 0:06:28,000
she found out she was intersex at age 41.

133
0:06:30.188,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Her doctors found out when she was 15,

134
0:06:33.522,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but they didn't tell her.

135
0:06:35.855,000 --> 0:06:38,000
They lied and said that she had cancer,

136
0:06:39.18,000 --> 0:06:4,000
because that seemed like an easier option

137
0:06:41.196,000 --> 0:06:43,000
than finding out she wasn't "fully" a woman.

138
0:06:45.006,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This kind of thing happens a lot,

139
0:06:46.617,000 --> 0:06:5,000
where intersex people are lied to or kept in the dark about our bodies,

140
0:06:51.211,000 --> 0:06:53,000
which comes as a surprise to a lot of people.

141
0:06:53.366,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But we live in a society that doesn't talk about sex or bodies at all,

142
0:06:57.822,000 --> 0:06:59,000
unless it's to mock or shame each other.

143
0:07:01.539,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I found out I was intersex at age 10,

144
0:07:03.856,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and for the most part, I was fine with that information.

145
0:07:08.055,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It didn't really faze me;

146
0:07:09.324,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I was still developing my understanding of the world.

147
0:07:13.186,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It wasn't until I got older

148
0:07:15.44,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and realized I didn't fit society's expectations of me,

149
0:07:19.448,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that I didn't belong, that I was abnormal.

150
0:07:22.542,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And that's when the shame started.

151
0:07:25.522,000 --> 0:07:27,000
How many times have you seen kids play with the "wrong" toys

152
0:07:28.396,000 --> 0:07:29,000
for their gender?

153
0:07:29.579,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Or try on the "wrong" clothes?

154
0:07:31.634,000 --> 0:07:32,000
All the time, right?

155
0:07:33.269,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Kids don't have these ideas about gender norm,

156
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
they don't have shame about who they're supposed to be

157
0:07:39.52,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or what they're supposed to like or love.

158
0:07:43.671,000 --> 0:07:45,000
They don't care about any of this stuff.

159
0:07:46.157,000 --> 0:07:48,000
They don't have shame until we put it on them.

160
0:07:50.626,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I also had doctors lie to me.

161
0:07:52.705,000 --> 0:07:56,000
At age 10, they told me that I would also get cancer

162
0:07:57.395,000 --> 0:07:58,000
unless I removed my balls.

163
0:07:59.911,000 --> 0:08:01,000
Then they proceeded to tell me that every year.

164
0:08:02.942,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Until today, there are still doctors who want me to remove them.

165
0:08:06.831,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But there's literally no reason.

166
0:08:09.847,000 --> 0:08:13,000
If a typical XY male, like yourself, has testicles,

167
0:08:14.681,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and one is undescended,

168
0:08:16.689,000 --> 0:08:18,000
there's a high chance of it becoming cancerous --

169
0:08:19.181,000 --> 0:08:21,000
or a higher chance of it becoming cancerous.

170
0:08:21.887,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They need to thermoregulated.

171
0:08:23.322,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So they drop down away from the body to cool off,

172
0:08:26.736,000 --> 0:08:28,000
or they shrink back up to get warm.

173
0:08:29.839,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Mine don't need to do that.

174
0:08:31.173,000 --> 0:08:35,000
They're not responding to testosterone, they're not producing sperm.

175
0:08:35.403,000 --> 0:08:37,000
They're fine right here inside my body.

176
0:08:38.355,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Yet, because there's such a lack of information about intersex people,

177
0:08:42.252,000 --> 0:08:44,000
my doctors never understood the difference.

178
0:08:44.371,000 --> 0:08:45,000
They never really understood my body.

179
0:08:47.466,000 --> 0:08:48,000
As I got older,

180
0:08:48.657,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I had another doctor tell me that I needed to have surgery on my vagina.

181
0:08:52.909,000 --> 0:08:55,000
She said that until I had an operation, until she operated,

182
0:08:56.697,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I would not be able to have "normal sex" with my husband one day.

183
0:09:02.212,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Her words.

184
0:09:05.212,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I didn't end up going through with the operation,

185
0:09:07.601,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and I'm incredibly grateful for that.

186
0:09:11.855,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I'm not here to talk about my sex life.

187
0:09:13.929,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Laughter)

188
0:09:15.133,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But let's just say it's fine.

189
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Laughter)

190
0:09:20.622,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I'm fine, my body is fine.

191
0:09:22.808,000 --> 0:09:24,000
You actually wouldn’t be able to tell the difference

192
0:09:25.308,000 --> 0:09:28,000
between me and another person unless I told you;

193
0:09:28.449,000 --> 0:09:31,000
you wouldn't be able to tell that I was intersex unless I told you.

194
0:09:32.223,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But again, because of the lack of understanding about bodies,

195
0:09:35.731,000 --> 0:09:37,000
my doctor didn't understand the difference.

196
0:09:38.723,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And for the most part, my sex life is fine.

197
0:09:41.99,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The only issue that really comes up

198
0:09:43.823,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is that sometimes, sexual situations bring up memories of doctors touching me,

199
0:09:49.45,000 --> 0:09:51,000
over and over again since I was 10.

200
0:09:53.435,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I've been really lucky to escape --

201
0:09:56.887,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I didn't think I would get emotional --

202
0:09:59.546,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I've been really lucky to escape the physical harm

203
0:10:03.712,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that comes from these unnecessary surgeries.

204
0:10:07.792,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But no intersex person is free from the emotional harm

205
0:10:11.585,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that comes from living in a society that tries to cover up your existence.

206
0:10:17.752,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Most of my intersex friends have had operations like these.

207
0:10:21.669,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Oftentimes, they will remove testes like mine,

208
0:10:24.991,000 --> 0:10:3,000
even though my risk of testicular cancer is lower than the risk of breast cancer

209
0:10:31.046,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in a typical woman with no predisposition, no family history.

210
0:10:36.538,000 --> 0:10:39,000
But we don't tell her to remove her breasts, do we?

211
0:10:42.149,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It's rare to meet an intersex person that hasn't been operated on.

212
0:10:48.385,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Oftentimes, these surgeries are done to improve intersex kids' lives,

213
0:10:53.5,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but they usually end up doing the opposite,

214
0:10:55.784,000 --> 0:10:58,000
causing more harm and complications,

215
0:10:59.769,000 --> 0:11:,000
both physical and emotional.

216
0:11:04.689,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I'm not saying that doctors are bad or evil.

217
0:11:07.939,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It's just that we live in a society that causes some doctors to "fix"

218
0:11:12.702,000 --> 0:11:15,000
those of us who don't fit their definition of normal.

219
0:11:17.546,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We're not problems that need to be fixed.

220
0:11:21.125,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We just live in a society that needs to be enlightened.

221
0:11:26.329,000 --> 0:11:27,000
One of the ways I'm doing that

222
0:11:27.843,000 --> 0:11:3,000
is by creating a genderless puberty guidebook

223
0:11:31.218,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that can teach kids about their bodies as they grow up.

224
0:11:34.503,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Not their girl bodies or their boy bodies --

225
0:11:36.838,000 --> 0:11:37,000
just their bodies.

226
0:11:38.95,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We often place unrealistic expectations on the things that our bodies do

227
0:11:42.673,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that are outside of our control.

228
0:11:44.982,000 --> 0:11:47,000
I mean, if one man can grow a full, luxurious, hipster beard,

229
0:11:48.474,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and the other can only grow a few mustache hairs,

230
0:11:52.085,000 --> 0:11:54,000
what does that mean about who they are as men?

231
0:11:55.442,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Nothing.

232
0:11:57.03,000 --> 0:11:58,000
It literally, most likely, just means

233
0:11:58.864,000 --> 0:12:01,000
that their hair follicles respond to testosterone in different ways.

234
0:12:03.212,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Yet, how many times have you heard a man ashamed about something like this?

235
0:12:10.519,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Imagine a world where we could live in a society

236
0:12:13.645,000 --> 0:12:16,000
that teaches us not to have shame

237
0:12:16.976,000 --> 0:12:19,000
about the things that our bodies do or do not do.

238
0:12:23.776,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I want to change the way that we think about biological sex in this society --

239
0:12:29.458,000 --> 0:12:3,000
which is a lot to ask for.

240
0:12:31.935,000 --> 0:12:32,000
You could say it's ballsy, I guess.

241
0:12:33.824,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Laughter)

242
0:12:36.987,000 --> 0:12:39,000
But eventually we accepted the world as round, right?

243
0:12:40.795,000 --> 0:12:43,000
We no longer diagnose gay people with mental disorders

244
0:12:43.922,000 --> 0:12:44,000
or women with hysteria.

245
0:12:46.629,000 --> 0:12:5,000
We don't think epilepsy is caused by the devil anymore, so that's cool.

246
0:12:51.136,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Laughter)

247
0:12:52.335,000 --> 0:12:55,000
We constantly change and evolve, the more we understand as a society.

248
0:12:57.223,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And biological sex is on a spectrum.

249
0:12:59.36,000 --> 0:13:,000
It's not black or white.

250
0:13:01.43,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Not only could that knowledge save intersex kids

251
0:13:04.042,000 --> 0:13:06,000
from physical and emotional harm,

252
0:13:06.183,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I think it would help everyone else, too.

253
0:13:09.532,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Who here has ever felt inadequate or ashamed

254
0:13:13.183,000 --> 0:13:16,000
because you weren't girly enough, you were too girly,

255
0:13:16.823,000 --> 0:13:18,000
you weren't manly enough, or too manly?

256
0:13:19.998,000 --> 0:13:22,000
We constantly shame people for not fitting into a box,

257
0:13:23.084,000 --> 0:13:24,000
but the reality is,

258
0:13:24.308,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I think we shame others because it prevents them from seeing

259
0:13:28.307,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that we don't fit inside our boxes, either.

260
0:13:31.689,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And the truth is that nobody actually fits in a box,

261
0:13:35.712,000 --> 0:13:36,000
because they don't exist.

262
0:13:37.966,000 --> 0:13:42,000
This binary, this false male-female facade is something we constructed,

263
0:13:43.53,000 --> 0:13:44,000
we built ourselves.

264
0:13:44.803,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But it doesn't have to exist.

265
0:13:48.514,000 --> 0:13:49,000
We can break it down.

266
0:13:50.379,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And that's what I want to do.

267
0:13:54.282,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Will you join me?

268
0:13:57.129,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Thanks.

269
0:13:58.304,000 --> 0:14:02,000
(Applause)

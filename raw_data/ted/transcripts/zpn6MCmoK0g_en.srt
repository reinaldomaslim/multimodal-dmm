3
0:00:17.333,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Hello.

4
0:00:18.625,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'm sure by the time I get to end of this sentence,

5
0:00:21.625,000 --> 0:00:22,000
given how I talk,

6
0:00:23.125,000 --> 0:00:25,000
you'll all have figured out that I'm from a place called

7
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
planet Earth.

8
0:00:27.292,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Earth is pretty great.

9
0:00:29.042,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It's home to us.

10
0:00:32.125,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And germs.

11
0:00:33.417,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Those [blip] take a back seat for the time being,

12
0:00:35.75,000 --> 0:00:37,000
because believe it or not, they're not the only thing going on.

13
0:00:38.75,000 --> 0:00:4,000
This planet is also home to cars, brussels sprouts;

14
0:00:41.417,000 --> 0:00:43,000
those weird fish things that have their own headlights;

15
0:00:44.042,000 --> 0:00:45,000
art, fire,

16
0:00:45.542,000 --> 0:00:46,000
fire extinguishers,

17
0:00:46.833,000 --> 0:00:48,000
laws, pigeons, bottles of beer,

18
0:00:48.958,000 --> 0:00:49,000
lemons and light bulbs;

19
0:00:50.25,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Pinot noir and paracetamol;

20
0:00:51.917,000 --> 0:00:53,000
ghosts, mosquitoes, flamingos, flowers,

21
0:00:54.5,000 --> 0:00:55,000
the ukulele, elevators and cats,

22
0:00:56.083,000 --> 0:00:57,000
cat videos, the internet;

23
0:00:57.583,000 --> 0:00:58,000
iron beams, buildings and batteries,

24
0:00:59.375,000 --> 0:01:01,000
all ingenuity and bright ideas, all known life ...

25
0:01:01.875,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and a whole bunch of other stuff.

26
0:01:03.542,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Pretty much everything we know and ever heard of.

27
0:01:06.083,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's my favorite place, actually.

28
0:01:08.083,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This small orb,

29
0:01:09.667,000 --> 0:01:11,000
floating in a cold and lonely part of the cosmos.

30
0:01:13.375,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Oh, the accent is from Belfast, by the way, which is ...

31
0:01:16.458,000 --> 0:01:17,000
here.

32
0:01:17.75,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Roughly.

33
0:01:19.875,000 --> 0:01:21,000
You may think you know this planet Earth,

34
0:01:22.25,000 --> 0:01:23,000
as you're from here.

35
0:01:23.542,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But chances are,

36
0:01:24.833,000 --> 0:01:26,000
you probably haven't thought about the basics in a while.

37
0:01:27.524,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I thought I knew it.

38
0:01:28.958,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Thought I was an expert, even.

39
0:01:30.417,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Until, that is, I had to explain the entire place,

40
0:01:33.375,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and how it's supposed to work,

41
0:01:34.875,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to someone who had never been here before.

42
0:01:37.542,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Now what you might think,

43
0:01:38.833,000 --> 0:01:4,000
although my dad always did say

44
0:01:41.042,000 --> 0:01:43,000
the sure sign of intelligent life out there

45
0:01:43.083,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is that they haven't bothered trying to contact us.

46
0:01:45.5,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It was actually my newborn son I was trying to explain things to.

47
0:01:49.167,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We'd never been parents before,

48
0:01:50.833,000 --> 0:01:51,000
my wife and I,

49
0:01:52.125,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and so treated him like most guests when he arrived home for the first time,

50
0:01:55.75,000 --> 0:01:56,000
by giving him the tour.

51
0:01:57.042,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This is where you live, son.

52
0:01:58.667,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This room is where we make food at.

53
0:02:00.375,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This is the room we keep our collection of chairs, and so on.

54
0:02:03.708,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It's refreshing,

55
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:07,000
explaining how our planet works to a zero-year-old.

56
0:02:07.708,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But after the laughs,

57
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and once the magnitude that new humans know absolutely nothing

58
0:02:12.208,000 --> 0:02:15,000
settles on you and how little you know either,

59
0:02:15.25,000 --> 0:02:18,000
explaining the whole planet becomes quite intimidating.

60
0:02:18.417,000 --> 0:02:19,000
But I tried anyway.

61
0:02:19.833,000 --> 0:02:22,000
As I walked around those first few weeks,

62
0:02:22.917,000 --> 0:02:24,000
narrating the world as I saw it,

63
0:02:25.25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I began to take notes of the ridiculous things I was saying.

64
0:02:28.417,000 --> 0:02:3,000
The notes slowly morphed into a letter

65
0:02:30.75,000 --> 0:02:32,000
intended for my son once he learned to read.

66
0:02:33.083,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And that letter became a book

67
0:02:34.583,000 --> 0:02:36,000
about the basic principles of what it is to be a human

68
0:02:37.292,000 --> 0:02:39,000
living on Earth in the 21st century.

69
0:02:40.25,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Some things are really obvious.

70
0:02:42.75,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Like, the planet is made of two parts:

71
0:02:44.708,000 --> 0:02:46,000
land and sea.

72
0:02:47.125,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Some less obvious until you think about them.

73
0:02:50.417,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Like, time.

74
0:02:52.208,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Things can sometimes move slowly here on Earth.

75
0:02:56.042,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But more often, they move quickly.

76
0:02:58.625,000 --> 0:03:,000
So use your time well, it will be gone before you know it.

77
0:03:02.417,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Or people.

78
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:07,000
People come in all different shapes, sizes and colors.

79
0:03:07.583,000 --> 0:03:08,000
We may all look different,

80
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
act different and sound different,

81
0:03:11.125,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but don't be fooled.

82
0:03:12.417,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We are all people.

83
0:03:13.708,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It doesn't skip me that of all the places in the universe,

84
0:03:16.958,000 --> 0:03:17,000
people only live on Earth,

85
0:03:18.25,000 --> 0:03:19,000
can only live on Earth.

86
0:03:19.875,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And even then, only on some of the dry bits.

87
0:03:22.083,000 --> 0:03:24,000
There's only a very small part of the surface of our planet

88
0:03:24.958,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that is actually habitable to human life,

89
0:03:26.958,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and squeezed in here is where all of us live.

90
0:03:29.333,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's easy to forget when you're up close to the dirt,

91
0:03:32.167,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the rocks, the foliage, the concrete of our lands,

92
0:03:34.542,000 --> 0:03:37,000
just how limited the room for maneuvering is.

93
0:03:37.708,000 --> 0:03:39,000
From a set of eyes close to the ground,

94
0:03:40.167,000 --> 0:03:42,000
the horizon feels like it goes forever.

95
0:03:42.708,000 --> 0:03:43,000
After all, it's not an every-day ritual

96
0:03:44.625,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to consider where we are on the ball of our planet

97
0:03:47.042,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and where that ball is in space.

98
0:03:49.042,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I didn't want to tell my son the same story of countries

99
0:03:52,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that we were told where I was growing up in Northern Ireland.

100
0:03:54.917,000 --> 0:03:55,000
That we were from just a small parish,

101
0:03:56.792,000 --> 0:03:58,000
which ignores life outside its immediate concerns.

102
0:03:59.167,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I wanted to try to feel what it was like to see our planet

103
0:04:02.833,000 --> 0:04:04,000
as one system, as a single object,

104
0:04:05.208,000 --> 0:04:06,000
hanging in space.

105
0:04:06.667,000 --> 0:04:07,000
To do this,

106
0:04:07.958,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I would need to switch from flat drawings for books

107
0:04:10.458,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to 3D sculpture for the street,

108
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and I'd need almost 200 feet,

109
0:04:13.833,000 --> 0:04:14,000
a New York City block,

110
0:04:15.292,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to build a large-scale model of the moon,

111
0:04:17.583,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the Earth and us.

112
0:04:19.833,000 --> 0:04:22,000
This project managed to take place on New York City's High Line park

113
0:04:23.048,000 --> 0:04:24,000
last winter,

114
0:04:24.292,000 --> 0:04:27,000
on the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11's mission around the Moon.

115
0:04:27.333,000 --> 0:04:28,000
After its installation,

116
0:04:28.708,000 --> 0:04:3,000
I was able to put on a space helmet with my son

117
0:04:31.25,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and launch, like Apollo 11 did half a century ago,

118
0:04:34.208,000 --> 0:04:35,000
towards the Moon.

119
0:04:36.042,000 --> 0:04:37,000
We circled around

120
0:04:37.333,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and looked back at us.

121
0:04:39.833,000 --> 0:04:4,000
What I felt was

122
0:04:41.333,000 --> 0:04:43,000
how lonely it was there in the dark.

123
0:04:43.833,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And I was just pretending.

124
0:04:45.583,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The Moon is the only object

125
0:04:47.125,000 --> 0:04:49,000
even remotely close to us.

126
0:04:49.375,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And at the scale of this project,

127
0:04:51.292,000 --> 0:04:53,000
where our planet was 10 feet in diameter,

128
0:04:53.333,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Mars, the next planet, will be the size of a yoga ball

129
0:04:55.917,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and a couple of miles away.

130
0:04:58.458,000 --> 0:05:,000
Although borders are not visible from space,

131
0:05:00.667,000 --> 0:05:01,000
on my sculpture,

132
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:03,000
every single border was drawn in.

133
0:05:03.596,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But rather than writing the country names on the carved-up land,

134
0:05:06.625,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I wrote over and over again,

135
0:05:08.5,000 --> 0:05:1,000
"people live here, people live here."

136
0:05:11.292,000 --> 0:05:13,000
"People live here."

137
0:05:13.708,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And off on the Moon, it was written,

138
0:05:16.208,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"No one lives here."

139
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Often, the obvious things

140
0:05:19.625,000 --> 0:05:22,000
aren't all that obvious until you think about them.

141
0:05:22.708,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Seeing anything from a vast enough distance

142
0:05:25.208,000 --> 0:05:26,000
changes everything,

143
0:05:26.667,000 --> 0:05:28,000
as many astronauts have experienced.

144
0:05:28.917,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And human eyes have only ever seen our Earth

145
0:05:31.333,000 --> 0:05:32,000
from as far as the Moon, really.

146
0:05:33.208,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's quite a ways further

147
0:05:34.5,000 --> 0:05:36,000
before we get to the edges of our own Solar System.

148
0:05:36.958,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And even out to other stars, to the constellations.

149
0:05:40.375,000 --> 0:05:43,000
There is actually only one point in the entire cosmos

150
0:05:43.542,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that is present in all constellations of stars,

151
0:05:46.417,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and that presence is

152
0:05:48.708,000 --> 0:05:5,000
here, planet Earth.

153
0:05:51.083,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Those pictures we have made up for the clusters of stars

154
0:05:53.727,000 --> 0:05:56,000
only make sense from this point of view down here.

155
0:05:58.5,000 --> 0:06:,000
Their stories only make sense here on Earth.

156
0:06:00.708,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And only something to us.

157
0:06:03.208,000 --> 0:06:04,000
To people.

158
0:06:04.583,000 --> 0:06:06,000
We are creatures of stories.

159
0:06:07.292,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We are the stories we tell,

160
0:06:08.917,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we're the stories we're told.

161
0:06:11.167,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Consider briefly the story of human civilization on Earth.

162
0:06:15.042,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It tells of the ingenuity, elegance,

163
0:06:17.625,000 --> 0:06:19,000
generous and nurturing nature of a species

164
0:06:19.958,000 --> 0:06:21,000
that is also self-focused, vulnerable

165
0:06:22.792,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and defiantly protective.

166
0:06:24.625,000 --> 0:06:26,000
We, the people, shield the flame of our existence

167
0:06:27.583,000 --> 0:06:29,000
from the raw, vast elements outside our control,

168
0:06:30.292,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the great beyond.

169
0:06:32.292,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Yet it is always to the flame we look.

170
0:06:36.458,000 --> 0:06:37,000
"For all we know,"

171
0:06:38.083,000 --> 0:06:39,000
when said as a statement,

172
0:06:39.375,000 --> 0:06:41,000
it means the sum total of all knowledge.

173
0:06:42.167,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But when said another way,

174
0:06:43.625,000 --> 0:06:44,000
"for all we know,"

175
0:06:45.583,000 --> 0:06:47,000
it means that we do not know at all.

176
0:06:48.417,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This is the beautiful, fragile drama of civilization.

177
0:06:52.542,000 --> 0:06:54,000
We are the actors and spectators of a cosmic play

178
0:06:54.875,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that means the world to us here,

179
0:06:56.542,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but means nothing anywhere else.

180
0:06:58.708,000 --> 0:07:,000
Possibly not even that much down here, either.

181
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:03,000
If we truly thought about our relationship with our boat,

182
0:07:03.708,000 --> 0:07:04,000
with our Earth,

183
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:07,000
it might be more of a story of ignorance and greed.

184
0:07:09.208,000 --> 0:07:11,000
As is the case with Fausto,

185
0:07:11.25,000 --> 0:07:12,000
a man who believed he owned everything

186
0:07:13.167,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and set out to survey what was his.

187
0:07:15.75,000 --> 0:07:17,000
He easily claims ownership of a flower,

188
0:07:18.125,000 --> 0:07:2,000
a sheep, a tree and a field.

189
0:07:20.708,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The lake and the mountain prove harder to conquer,

190
0:07:23.083,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but they, too, surrender.

191
0:07:25.125,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It is in trying to own the open sea

192
0:07:27.333,000 --> 0:07:29,000
where his greed proves his undoing,

193
0:07:29.792,000 --> 0:07:31,000
when, in a fit of arrogance,

194
0:07:31.875,000 --> 0:07:33,000
he climbs overboard to show that sea who is boss.

195
0:07:34.875,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But he does not understand,

196
0:07:36.625,000 --> 0:07:38,000
slips beneath the waves, sinks to the bottom.

197
0:07:40.333,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The sea was sad for him

198
0:07:41.625,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but carried on being the sea.

199
0:07:44.917,000 --> 0:07:46,000
As do all the other objects of his ownership,

200
0:07:47.417,000 --> 0:07:5,000
for the fate of Fausto does not matter to them.

201
0:07:51.583,000 --> 0:07:54,000
For all the importance in the cosmos we believe we hold,

202
0:07:55.375,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we'd have nothing

203
0:07:57.042,000 --> 0:07:58,000
if not for this Earth.

204
0:07:58.625,000 --> 0:08:,000
While it would keep happily spinning,

205
0:08:01.083,000 --> 0:08:03,000
obliviously without us.

206
0:08:03.125,000 --> 0:08:05,000
On this planet, there are people.

207
0:08:06.292,000 --> 0:08:07,000
We have gone about our days,

208
0:08:07.667,000 --> 0:08:09,000
sometimes we look up and out,

209
0:08:09.75,000 --> 0:08:12,000
mostly we look down and in.

210
0:08:12.917,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Looking up and by drawing lines between the lights in the sky,

211
0:08:15.958,000 --> 0:08:17,000
we've attempted to make sense out of chaos.

212
0:08:18.75,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Looking down, we've drawn lines across the land to know where we belong

213
0:08:22.292,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and where we don't.

214
0:08:23.583,000 --> 0:08:25,000
We do mostly forget that these lines that connect the stars

215
0:08:26.417,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and those lines that divide the land

216
0:08:28.208,000 --> 0:08:3,000
live only in our heads.

217
0:08:30.542,000 --> 0:08:32,000
They, too, are stories.

218
0:08:33.042,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We carry out our everyday routines and rituals

219
0:08:35.417,000 --> 0:08:37,000
according to the stories we most believe in,

220
0:08:37.5,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and these days, the story is changing as we write it.

221
0:08:40.001,000 --> 0:08:42,000
There is a lot of fear in this current story,

222
0:08:42.167,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and until recently,

223
0:08:43.458,000 --> 0:08:45,000
the stories that seemed to have the most power

224
0:08:45.667,000 --> 0:08:46,000
are those of bitterness,

225
0:08:46.958,000 --> 0:08:49,000
of how it had all gone wrong for us individually and collectively.

226
0:08:50.125,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It has been inspiring to watch how the best comes from the worst.

227
0:08:53.458,000 --> 0:08:55,000
How people are waking up in this time of global reckoning

228
0:08:56.25,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to the realization that our connections with each other

229
0:08:59.75,000 --> 0:09:01,000
are some of the most important things we have.

230
0:09:01.917,000 --> 0:09:02,000
But stepping back.

231
0:09:03.208,000 --> 0:09:04,000
For all we've had to lament,

232
0:09:04.667,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we spend very little time relishing the single biggest thing

233
0:09:07.708,000 --> 0:09:08,000
that has ever gone right for us.

234
0:09:09.667,000 --> 0:09:1,000
That we are here in the first place,

235
0:09:11.417,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that we are alive at all.

236
0:09:12.708,000 --> 0:09:13,000
That we are still alive.

237
0:09:14.292,000 --> 0:09:16,000
A million and a half years after finding a box of matches,

238
0:09:17.25,000 --> 0:09:19,000
we haven't totally burned the house down.

239
0:09:20.208,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Yet.

240
0:09:21.5,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The chances of being here are infinitesimal.

241
0:09:23.75,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Yet here we are.

242
0:09:25.042,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Perils and all.

243
0:09:26.375,000 --> 0:09:28,000
There have never been more people living on Earth.

244
0:09:28.792,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Using more stuff.

245
0:09:30.25,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And it's become obvious that many of the old systems

246
0:09:32.792,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we invented for ourselves

247
0:09:34.75,000 --> 0:09:35,000
are obsolete.

248
0:09:36.042,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And we have to build new ones.

249
0:09:38,000 --> 0:09:39,000
If it wasn't germs,

250
0:09:39.458,000 --> 0:09:42,000
our collective fire might suffocate us before long.

251
0:09:42.583,000 --> 0:09:45,000
As we watch the wheels of industry grind to a halt,

252
0:09:45.667,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the machinery of progress become silent,

253
0:09:47.75,000 --> 0:09:49,000
we have the wildest of opportunities

254
0:09:50.167,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to hit the reset button.

255
0:09:52.083,000 --> 0:09:53,000
To take a different path.

256
0:09:53.958,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Here we are on Earth.

257
0:09:56.458,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And life on Earth is a wonderful thing.

258
0:09:59.083,000 --> 0:10:,000
It looks big, this Earth,

259
0:10:00.375,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but there are lots of us on here.

260
0:10:02.25,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Seven and a half billion at last count,

261
0:10:04.833,000 --> 0:10:06,000
with more showing up every day.

262
0:10:07.625,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Even so,

263
0:10:08.917,000 --> 0:10:09,000
there is still enough for everyone,

264
0:10:10.667,000 --> 0:10:11,000
if we all share a little.

265
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:14,000
So please,

266
0:10:14.708,000 --> 0:10:15,000
be kind.

267
0:10:17.125,000 --> 0:10:18,000
When you think of it another way,

268
0:10:18.792,000 --> 0:10:2,000
if Earth is the only place where people live,

269
0:10:21.042,000 --> 0:10:24,000
it's actually the least lonely place in the universe.

270
0:10:25.375,000 --> 0:10:27,000
There are plenty of people to be loved by

271
0:10:27.625,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and plenty of people to love.

272
0:10:29.708,000 --> 0:10:31,000
We need each other.

273
0:10:31.833,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We know that now, more than ever.

274
0:10:34.958,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Good night.

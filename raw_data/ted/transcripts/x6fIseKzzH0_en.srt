0:00:00.25,000 --> 0:00:02,000
The basic problem with working in an office

2
0:00:02.33,000 --> 0:00:04,000
is you're just not in control of your work environment.

3
0:00:04.97,000 --> 0:00:06,000
[The Way We Work]

4
0:00:08.57,000 --> 0:00:11,000
Howdy, my name is Matt, and I'm the CEO of Automattic,

5
0:00:11.77,000 --> 0:00:13,000
the company behind WordPress.com, Jetpack and WooCommerce.

6
0:00:14.65,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We're coming up on over 800 employees, and they live everywhere,

7
0:00:18.89,000 --> 0:00:21,000
from California to Alabama, Mississippi, to where I live in Texas.

8
0:00:22.69,000 --> 0:00:23,000
They're also in 67 countries.

9
0:00:24.57,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Canada, Mexico, India, New Zealand.

10
0:00:26.888,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Some of them choose not even to have a home base, they're nomads.

11
0:00:29.968,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Whether they are in RVs or traveling through Airbnbs,

12
0:00:32.325,000 --> 0:00:34,000
they are in new places every day, week or month.

13
0:00:34.725,000 --> 0:00:37,000
As long as they can find good Wi-Fi, we don't care where they are.

14
0:00:37.845,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Our focus on distributed work didn't happen accidentally.

15
0:00:40.805,000 --> 0:00:42,000
It was a conscious choice from the very beginning.

16
0:00:43.405,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Notice I don't use the word "remote,"

17
0:00:45.725,000 --> 0:00:46,000
because it sets up the expectation,

18
0:00:47.445,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that some people are essential and some aren't.

19
0:00:49.605,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I use the word "distributed" to describe what we do,

20
0:00:52.085,000 --> 0:00:53,000
where everyone is on an equal playing field.

21
0:00:53.582,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I think a distributed workforce

22
0:00:55.091,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is the most effective way to build a company.

23
0:00:56.729,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The key is you have to approach it consciously.

24
0:00:59.034,000 --> 0:01:,000
When we started WordPress,

25
0:01:00.448,000 --> 0:01:02,000
many of the first 20 hires were people I'd never met in person.

26
0:01:03.556,000 --> 0:01:05,000
But we'd collaborated online, sometimes for years.

27
0:01:06.196,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I wanted to continue that for one simple reason.

28
0:01:09.624,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I believe that talent and intelligence

29
0:01:11.586,000 --> 0:01:12,000
are equally distributed throughout the world.

30
0:01:13.359,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But opportunity is not.

31
0:01:15.179,000 --> 0:01:17,000
In Silicon Valley, the big tech companies fish

32
0:01:17.379,000 --> 0:01:19,000
from essentially the same small pond or bay.

33
0:01:19.659,000 --> 0:01:21,000
A distributed company can fish from the entire ocean.

34
0:01:22.619,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Instead of hiring someone who grew up in Japan but lives in California,

35
0:01:26.139,000 --> 0:01:27,000
you can gain someone who lives, works,

36
0:01:28.019,000 --> 0:01:31,000
wakes up and goes to sleep wherever they are in the world.

37
0:01:31.06,000 --> 0:01:33,000
They bring a different understanding of that culture

38
0:01:33.579,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and a different lived experience.

39
0:01:35.259,000 --> 0:01:37,000
At the base of the decision to go distributed,

40
0:01:37.579,000 --> 0:01:4,000
there's a desire to give people autonomy over how they do their work.

41
0:01:41.219,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Unless you're in a role where specific hours are important,

42
0:01:44.059,000 --> 0:01:45,000
you can make your own schedule.

43
0:01:45.579,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Everyone can have a corner office, their windows, the food they want to eat,

44
0:01:49.219,000 --> 0:01:51,000
you can choose when there's music and when there's silence.

45
0:01:52.059,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You can choose what temperature the room should be.

46
0:01:54.499,000 --> 0:01:56,000
You can save the time you'd spend commuting

47
0:01:56.579,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and put it into things that are important to you.

48
0:01:58.939,000 --> 0:02:,000
A distributed workforce is ideal for a technology company.

49
0:02:01.699,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But people often ask me,

50
0:02:03.059,000 --> 0:02:06,000
"This works great for y'all, but what about everyone else?"

51
0:02:06.38,000 --> 0:02:07,000
If you have an office,

52
0:02:07.566,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you can do a few things to build distributed capability.

53
0:02:10.601,000 --> 0:02:12,000
First: document everything.

54
0:02:13.059,000 --> 0:02:15,000
In an office, it's easy to make decisions in the moment,

55
0:02:15.703,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in the kitchen, in the hall.

56
0:02:17.099,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But if people work remotely

57
0:02:18.459,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and some members of the team are having those conversations

58
0:02:21.299,000 --> 0:02:22,000
they don't have access to,

59
0:02:22.579,000 --> 0:02:25,000
they'll see these decisions being made without understanding the why.

60
0:02:25.859,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Always leave a trail of where you were and what you were thinking about.

61
0:02:29.299,000 --> 0:02:31,000
This allows others to pick up where you left off.

62
0:02:31.659,000 --> 0:02:33,000
It allows people in different time zones to interact,

63
0:02:34.179,000 --> 0:02:36,000
it's also great to think about as an organization evolves,

64
0:02:36.939,000 --> 0:02:37,000
people leaving and people joining.

65
0:02:38.588,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Try to have as much communication as possible online.

66
0:02:41.873,000 --> 0:02:45,000
When everything's shared and public, it allows new people to catch up quickly.

67
0:02:46.339,000 --> 0:02:48,000
You also need to find the right tools.

68
0:02:48.379,000 --> 0:02:51,000
There are so many apps and services that help with day-to-day communication,

69
0:02:52.019,000 --> 0:02:54,000
video conferencing, project management.

70
0:02:54.486,000 --> 0:02:57,000
The things that changed how you work probably aren't objects anymore.

71
0:02:58.381,000 --> 0:03:,000
They're things you access through your computer.

72
0:03:00.648,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So experiment with different tools that enable collaboration,

73
0:03:03.739,000 --> 0:03:04,000
see what works.

74
0:03:05.019,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Create productive, face-to-face time.

75
0:03:07.019,000 --> 0:03:08,000
In a traditional office,

76
0:03:08.299,000 --> 0:03:1,000
you're in the same place 48 weeks out of the year

77
0:03:10.659,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and you might have three or four weeks apart.

78
0:03:12.819,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We try to flip that: we come together for short, intense bursts.

79
0:03:16.099,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Once a year we do a grand meet-up

80
0:03:17.739,000 --> 0:03:19,000
where the entire company comes together for a week.

81
0:03:20.179,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It's half-work, half-play.

82
0:03:21.699,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The primary goal is connecting people.

83
0:03:23.579,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We want to make sure everyone's aligned and on the same page,

84
0:03:26.499,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and they have a deeper connection with their colleagues.

85
0:03:29.179,000 --> 0:03:31,000
When they work together the rest of the year,

86
0:03:31.339,000 --> 0:03:33,000
they can bring together that understanding and empathy.

87
0:03:33.979,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And the final practice:

88
0:03:35.259,000 --> 0:03:37,000
give people the flexibility to make their own work environment.

89
0:03:38.242,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Every person at Automattic has a co-working stipend

90
0:03:40.659,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that they can put towards a co-working space

91
0:03:42.779,000 --> 0:03:45,000
or just to buy coffee, so they don't get kicked out of the coffee shop.

92
0:03:46.179,000 --> 0:03:48,000
One group in Seattle decided to pool their stipends together

93
0:03:49.099,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and rented a workspace on a fishing pier.

94
0:03:50.939,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Each person who joins the company gets a home-office stipend.

95
0:03:53.859,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This is money they can invest in getting the right chair, monitor,

96
0:03:57.139,000 --> 0:04:,000
the right desk setup, so they can have the most productive environment for them.

97
0:04:01.699,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Today, there are just a few companies that are distributed first.

98
0:04:04.819,000 --> 0:04:06,000
In a decade or two, I predict that 90 percent of companies

99
0:04:07.779,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that are going to be changing the course of the world

100
0:04:10.299,000 --> 0:04:11,000
are going to function this way.

101
0:04:11.819,000 --> 0:04:14,000
They will evolve to be distributed first, or they'll be replaced by those that are.

102
0:04:15.779,000 --> 0:04:17,000
As you think about what you're going to build next,

103
0:04:18.219,000 --> 0:04:2,000
consider how you can tap into global talent,

104
0:04:20.339,000 --> 0:04:23,000
give people autonomy to live and work where they feel they should

105
0:04:23.459,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and still participate fully in whatever it is that you're creating together.

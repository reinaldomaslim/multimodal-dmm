1
0:00:13.09,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Wow, this is bright.

2
0:00:15.121,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It must use a lot of power.

3
0:00:18.112,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Well, flying you all in here

4
0:00:19.604,000 --> 0:00:21,000
must have cost a bit of energy too.

5
0:00:22.052,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So the whole planet needs a lot of energy,

6
0:00:24.97,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and so far we've been running mostly on fossil fuel.

7
0:00:27.871,000 --> 0:00:29,000
We've been burning gas.

8
0:00:29.92,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It's been a good run.

9
0:00:31.307,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It got us to where we are, but we have to stop.

10
0:00:34.175,000 --> 0:00:36,000
We can't do that anymore.

11
0:00:36.329,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So we are trying different types of energy now,

12
0:00:38.61,000 --> 0:00:39,000
alternative energy,

13
0:00:39.824,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but it proved quite difficult to find something

14
0:00:42.322,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that's as convenient and as cost-effective

15
0:00:45.123,000 --> 0:00:47,000
as oil, gas and coal.

16
0:00:47.94,000 --> 0:00:51,000
My personal favorite is nuclear energy.

17
0:00:52.03,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Now, it's very energy-dense,

18
0:00:54.631,000 --> 0:00:56,000
it produces solid, reliable power,

19
0:00:57.112,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and it doesn't make any CO2.

20
0:00:59.495,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now we know of two ways

21
0:01:00.987,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of making nuclear energy: fission and fusion.

22
0:01:06.161,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now in fission, you take a big nucleus,

23
0:01:08.506,000 --> 0:01:09,000
you break it in part, in two,

24
0:01:10.141,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and it makes lots of energy,

25
0:01:11.688,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and this is how the nuclear reactor today works.

26
0:01:13.901,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It works pretty good.

27
0:01:15.31,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And then there's fusion.

28
0:01:17.464,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now, I like fusion. Fusion's much better.

29
0:01:19.87,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So you take two small nuclei,

30
0:01:21.564,000 --> 0:01:23,000
you put it together, and you make helium,

31
0:01:24.07,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and that's very nice.

32
0:01:25.428,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It makes lots of energy.

33
0:01:26.974,000 --> 0:01:28,000
This is nature's way of producing energy.

34
0:01:29.574,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The sun and all the stars in the universe

35
0:01:31.982,000 --> 0:01:33,000
run on fusion.

36
0:01:34.227,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Now, a fusion plant

37
0:01:36.123,000 --> 0:01:38,000
would actually be quite cost-effective

38
0:01:38.438,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and it also would be quite safe.

39
0:01:40.428,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It only produces short term radioactive waste,

40
0:01:44.861,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and it cannot melt down.

41
0:01:46.893,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Now, the fuel from fusion comes from the ocean.

42
0:01:49.42,000 --> 0:01:5,000
In the ocean, you can extract the fuel

43
0:01:51.238,000 --> 0:01:52,000
for about one thousandth of a cent

44
0:01:53.128,000 --> 0:01:55,000
per kilowatt-hour, so that's very, very cheap.

45
0:01:55.459,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And if the whole planet would run on fusion,

46
0:01:58.847,000 --> 0:01:59,000
we could extract the fuel from the ocean.

47
0:02:00.291,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It would run for billions and billions of years.

48
0:02:03.555,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Now, if fusion is so great, why don't we have it?

49
0:02:07.327,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Where is it?

50
0:02:08.663,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Well, there's always a bit of a catch.

51
0:02:10.511,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Fusion is really, really hard to do.

52
0:02:13.749,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So the problem is, those two nuclei,

53
0:02:16.233,000 --> 0:02:17,000
they are both positively charged,

54
0:02:17.861,000 --> 0:02:18,000
so they don't want to fuse.

55
0:02:19.652,000 --> 0:02:2,000
They go like this. They go like that.

56
0:02:21.429,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So in order to make them fuse,

57
0:02:22.393,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you have to throw them at each other with great speed,

58
0:02:24.58,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and if they have enough speed,

59
0:02:25.493,000 --> 0:02:26,000
they will go against the repulsion,

60
0:02:27.327,000 --> 0:02:29,000
they will touch, and they will make energy.

61
0:02:29.48,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Now, the particle speed

62
0:02:31.887,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is a measure of the temperature.

63
0:02:33.657,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So the temperature required for fusion

64
0:02:35.399,000 --> 0:02:38,000
is 150 billion degrees C.

65
0:02:38.561,000 --> 0:02:39,000
This is rather warm,

66
0:02:40.392,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and this is why fusion is so hard to do.

67
0:02:43.838,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now, I caught my little fusion bug

68
0:02:45.863,000 --> 0:02:48,000
when I did my Ph.D. here at the University of British Columbia,

69
0:02:49.533,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and then I got a big job in a laser printer place

70
0:02:52.585,000 --> 0:02:54,000
making printing for the printing industry.

71
0:02:55.123,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I worked there for 10 years,

72
0:02:57.375,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and I got a little bit bored,

73
0:02:59.055,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and then I was 40, and I got a mid-life crisis,

74
0:03:02.008,000 --> 0:03:03,000
you know, the usual thing:

75
0:03:03.641,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Who am I? What should I do?

76
0:03:06.1,000 --> 0:03:08,000
What should I do? What can I do?

77
0:03:08.686,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And then I was looking at my good work,

78
0:03:10.738,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and what I was doing is I was cutting the forests

79
0:03:12.789,000 --> 0:03:13,000
around here in B.C.

80
0:03:14.144,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and burying you, all of you,

81
0:03:15.738,000 --> 0:03:18,000
in millions of tons of junk mail.

82
0:03:19.18,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Now, that was not very satisfactory.

83
0:03:21.115,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So some people buy a Porsche.

84
0:03:23.38,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Others get a mistress.

85
0:03:26.151,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But I've decided to get my bit

86
0:03:27.825,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to solve global warming and make fusion happen.

87
0:03:32.088,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now, so the first thing I did

88
0:03:33.819,000 --> 0:03:35,000
is I looked into the literature and I see,

89
0:03:36.248,000 --> 0:03:38,000
how does fusion work?

90
0:03:38.99,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So the physicists have been working on fusion for a while,

91
0:03:42.132,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and one of the ways they do it

92
0:03:43.448,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is with something called a tokamak.

93
0:03:45.754,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's a big ring of magnetic coil,

94
0:03:48.484,000 --> 0:03:49,000
superconducting coil,

95
0:03:49.81,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and it makes a magnetic field

96
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in a ring like this,

97
0:03:52.948,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and the hot gas in the middle,

98
0:03:54.34,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which is called a plasma, is trapped.

99
0:03:56.47,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The particles go round and round and round

100
0:03:58.218,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the circle at the wall.

101
0:03:59.658,000 --> 0:04:,000
Then they throw a huge amount of heat in there

102
0:04:01.186,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to try to cook that to fusion temperature.

103
0:04:03.66,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So this is the inside of one of those donuts,

104
0:04:05.988,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and on the right side you can see

105
0:04:07.32,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the fusion plasma in there.

106
0:04:09.46,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now, a second way of doing this

107
0:04:11.708,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is by using laser fusion.

108
0:04:14.108,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now in laser fusion, you have a little ping pong ball,

109
0:04:16.228,000 --> 0:04:18,000
you put the fusion fuel in the center,

110
0:04:18.274,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and you zap that with a whole bunch of laser around it.

111
0:04:21.204,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The lasers are very strong, and it squashes

112
0:04:22.908,000 --> 0:04:23,000
the ping pong ball really, really quick.

113
0:04:24.634,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And if you squeeze something hard enough,

114
0:04:26.589,000 --> 0:04:27,000
it gets hotter,

115
0:04:27.964,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and if it gets really, really fast,

116
0:04:29.36,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and they do that in one billionth of a second,

117
0:04:31.678,000 --> 0:04:32,000
it makes enough energy and enough heat

118
0:04:33.581,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to make fusion.

119
0:04:34.917,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So this is the inside of one such machine.

120
0:04:36.994,000 --> 0:04:37,000
You see the laser beam and the pellet

121
0:04:38.837,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in the center.

122
0:04:40.386,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now, most people think that fusion is going nowhere.

123
0:04:43.348,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They always think that the physicists are in their lab

124
0:04:46.28,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and they're working hard, but nothing is happening.

125
0:04:48.095,000 --> 0:04:49,000
That's actually not quite true.

126
0:04:49.615,000 --> 0:04:5,000
This is a curve of the gain in fusion

127
0:04:51.607,000 --> 0:04:53,000
over the last 30 years or so,

128
0:04:53.799,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and you can see that we're making now

129
0:04:55.357,000 --> 0:04:57,000
about 10,000 times more fusion than we used to

130
0:04:58.19,000 --> 0:04:59,000
when we started.

131
0:04:59.264,000 --> 0:04:59,000
That's a pretty good gain.

132
0:05:00.259,000 --> 0:05:01,000
As a matter of fact, it's as fast

133
0:05:02.245,000 --> 0:05:03,000
as the fabled Moore's Law

134
0:05:03.945,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that defined the amount of transistors

135
0:05:06.149,000 --> 0:05:07,000
they can put on a chip.

136
0:05:07.666,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now, this dot here is called JET,

137
0:05:10.671,000 --> 0:05:11,000
the Joint European Torus.

138
0:05:12.094,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It's a big tokamak donut in Europe,

139
0:05:14.524,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and this machine in 1997

140
0:05:17.594,000 --> 0:05:2,000
produced 16 megawatts of fusion power

141
0:05:20.818,000 --> 0:05:22,000
with 17 megawatts of heat.

142
0:05:22.976,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now, you say, that's not much use,

143
0:05:24.781,000 --> 0:05:25,000
but it's actually pretty close,

144
0:05:26.492,000 --> 0:05:27,000
considering we can get

145
0:05:27.532,000 --> 0:05:29,000
about 10,000 times more than we started.

146
0:05:29.839,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The second dot here is the NIF.

147
0:05:32.452,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's the National Ignition Facility.

148
0:05:34.738,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It's a big laser machine in the U.S.,

149
0:05:37.264,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and last month they announced

150
0:05:38.541,000 --> 0:05:39,000
with quite a bit of noise

151
0:05:40.394,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that they had managed to make more fusion energy

152
0:05:42.552,000 --> 0:05:43,000
from the fusion

153
0:05:44.142,000 --> 0:05:46,000
than the energy that they put in the center of the ping pong ball.

154
0:05:46.998,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, that's not quite good enough,

155
0:05:48.823,000 --> 0:05:49,000
because the laser to put that energy in

156
0:05:50.523,000 --> 0:05:51,000
was more energy than that,

157
0:05:52.255,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but it was pretty good.

158
0:05:54.295,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now this is ITER,

159
0:05:56.022,000 --> 0:05:58,000
pronounced in French: EE-tairh.

160
0:05:58.08,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So this is a big collaboration of different countries

161
0:06:01.211,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that are building a huge magnetic donut

162
0:06:03.066,000 --> 0:06:04,000
in the south of France,

163
0:06:05.01,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and this machine, when it's finished,

164
0:06:07.018,000 --> 0:06:09,000
will produce 500 megawatts of fusion power

165
0:06:09.796,000 --> 0:06:11,000
with only 50 megawatts to make it.

166
0:06:12.196,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So this one is the real one.

167
0:06:13.382,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's going to work.

168
0:06:14.114,000 --> 0:06:16,000
That's the kind of machine that makes energy.

169
0:06:16.306,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Now if you look at the graph, you will notice

170
0:06:18.062,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that those two dots are a little bit

171
0:06:19.567,000 --> 0:06:2,000
on the right of the curve.

172
0:06:20.609,000 --> 0:06:21,000
We kind of have fallen off the progress.

173
0:06:22.545,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Actually, the science to make those machines

174
0:06:24.534,000 --> 0:06:25,000
was really in time

175
0:06:26.07,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to produce fusion during that curve.

176
0:06:28.906,000 --> 0:06:3,000
However, there has been a bit of politics going on,

177
0:06:31.645,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and the will to do it was not there,

178
0:06:33.777,000 --> 0:06:34,000
so it drifted to the right.

179
0:06:35.455,000 --> 0:06:37,000
ITER, for example, could have been built

180
0:06:37.511,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in 2000 or 2005,

181
0:06:39.362,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but because it's a big international collaboration,

182
0:06:41.807,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the politics got in and it delayed it a bit.

183
0:06:44.255,000 --> 0:06:45,000
For example, it took them about three years

184
0:06:45.879,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to decide where to put it.

185
0:06:47.447,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Now, fusion is often criticized

186
0:06:49.983,000 --> 0:06:5,000
for being a little too expensive.

187
0:06:51.583,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Yes, it did cost

188
0:06:53.124,000 --> 0:06:55,000
a billion dollars or two billion dollars a year

189
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to make this progress.

190
0:06:56.353,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But you have to compare that to the cost

191
0:06:57.943,000 --> 0:06:58,000
of making Moore's Law.

192
0:06:59.183,000 --> 0:07:,000
That cost way more than that.

193
0:07:01.071,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The result of Moore's Law

194
0:07:02.589,000 --> 0:07:03,000
is this cell phone here in my pocket.

195
0:07:04.525,000 --> 0:07:06,000
This cell phone, and the Internet behind it,

196
0:07:06.754,000 --> 0:07:08,000
cost about one trillion dollars,

197
0:07:09.434,000 --> 0:07:12,000
just so I can take a selfie

198
0:07:12.665,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and put it on Facebook.

199
0:07:15.239,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Then when my dad sees that,

200
0:07:16.74,000 --> 0:07:19,000
he'll be very proud.

201
0:07:19.92,000 --> 0:07:22,000
We also spend about 650 billion dollars a year

202
0:07:23.828,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in subsidies for oil and gas

203
0:07:26.13,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and renewable energy.

204
0:07:27.76,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Now, we spend one half of a percent of that on fusion.

205
0:07:31.934,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So me, personally, I don't think it's too expensive.

206
0:07:34.582,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I think it's actually been shortchanged,

207
0:07:36.362,000 --> 0:07:38,000
considering it can solve all our energy problems

208
0:07:38.754,000 --> 0:07:4,000
cleanly for the next couple of billions of years.

209
0:07:41.428,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Now I can say that, but I'm a little bit biased,

210
0:07:44.088,000 --> 0:07:45,000
because I started a fusion company

211
0:07:45.976,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and I don't even have a Facebook account.

212
0:07:48.534,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So when I started this fusion company in 2002,

213
0:07:53.917,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I knew I couldn't fight with the big lads.

214
0:07:56.759,000 --> 0:07:57,000
They had much more resources than me.

215
0:07:58.336,000 --> 0:08:,000
So I decided I would need to find a solution

216
0:08:00.576,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that is cheaper and faster.

217
0:08:02.463,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Now magnetic and laser fusion

218
0:08:04.373,000 --> 0:08:05,000
are pretty good machines.

219
0:08:05.804,000 --> 0:08:06,000
They are awesome pieces of technology,

220
0:08:07.245,000 --> 0:08:08,000
wonderful machines, and they have shown

221
0:08:09.119,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that fusion can be done.

222
0:08:10.598,000 --> 0:08:11,000
However, as a power plant,

223
0:08:12.552,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I don't think they're very good.

224
0:08:14.423,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They're way too big, way too complicated,

225
0:08:16.48,000 --> 0:08:17,000
way too expensive,

226
0:08:17.618,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and also, they don't deal very much

227
0:08:19.374,000 --> 0:08:2,000
with the fusion energy.

228
0:08:20.648,000 --> 0:08:21,000
When you make fusion, the energy comes out

229
0:08:22.406,000 --> 0:08:24,000
as neutrons, fast neutrons comes out of the plasma.

230
0:08:25.074,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Those neutrons hit the wall of the machine.

231
0:08:27.334,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It damages it.

232
0:08:28.719,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And also, you have to catch the heat from those neutrons

233
0:08:30.683,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and run some steam to spin a turbine somewhere,

234
0:08:33.116,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and on those machines,

235
0:08:34.4,000 --> 0:08:36,000
it was all a bit of an afterthought.

236
0:08:37.031,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So I decided that surely there is a better way of doing that.

237
0:08:40.182,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So back to the literature,

238
0:08:41.466,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and I read about the fusion everywhere.

239
0:08:43.458,000 --> 0:08:45,000
One way in particular attracted my attention,

240
0:08:46.18,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and it's called magnetized target fusion,

241
0:08:48.27,000 --> 0:08:5,000
or MTF for short.

242
0:08:50.858,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Now, in MTF, what you want to do

243
0:08:53.3,000 --> 0:08:54,000
is you take a big vat

244
0:08:55.27,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and you fill that with liquid metal,

245
0:08:57.286,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and you spin the liquid metal

246
0:08:58.806,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to open a vortex in the center,

247
0:09:00.454,000 --> 0:09:01,000
a bit like your sink.

248
0:09:01.59,000 --> 0:09:03,000
When you pull the plug on a sink, it makes a vortex.

249
0:09:03.694,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And then you have some pistons driven by pressure

250
0:09:06.09,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that goes on the outside,

251
0:09:07.566,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and this compresses the liquid metal

252
0:09:09.486,000 --> 0:09:1,000
around the plasma, and it compresses it,

253
0:09:11.248,000 --> 0:09:12,000
it gets hotter, like a laser,

254
0:09:12.902,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and then it makes fusion.

255
0:09:14.128,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So it's a bit of a mix

256
0:09:15.048,000 --> 0:09:16,000
between a magnetized fusion

257
0:09:16.703,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and the laser fusion.

258
0:09:18.686,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So those have a couple of very good advantages.

259
0:09:21.459,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The liquid metal absorbs all the neutrons

260
0:09:23.802,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and no neutrons hit the wall,

261
0:09:25.558,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and therefore there's no damage to the machine.

262
0:09:27.694,000 --> 0:09:28,000
The liquid metal gets hot,

263
0:09:29.15,000 --> 0:09:31,000
so you can pump that in a heat exchanger,

264
0:09:31.15,000 --> 0:09:32,000
make some steam, spin a turbine.

265
0:09:33.03,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So that's a very convenient way of doing

266
0:09:34.209,000 --> 0:09:35,000
this part of the process.

267
0:09:35.469,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And finally, all the energy to make the fusion happen

268
0:09:39.06,000 --> 0:09:41,000
comes from steam-powered pistons,

269
0:09:41.195,000 --> 0:09:42,000
which is way cheaper than lasers

270
0:09:42.851,000 --> 0:09:43,000
or superconducting coils.

271
0:09:44.745,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Now, this was all very good

272
0:09:46.233,000 --> 0:09:48,000
except for the problem that it didn't quite work.

273
0:09:48.737,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Laughter)

274
0:09:50.607,000 --> 0:09:51,000
There's always a catch.

275
0:09:51.903,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So when you compress that,

276
0:09:53.417,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the plasma cools down

277
0:09:55.341,000 --> 0:09:56,000
faster than the compression speed,

278
0:09:56.969,000 --> 0:09:57,000
so you're trying to compress it,

279
0:09:58.282,000 --> 0:10:,000
but the plasma cooled down and cooled down and cooled down

280
0:10:00.617,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and then it did absolutely nothing.

281
0:10:02.558,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So when I saw that, I said, well, this is such a shame,

282
0:10:04.593,000 --> 0:10:05,000
because it's a very, very good idea.

283
0:10:06.343,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So hopefully I can improve on that.

284
0:10:08.697,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So I thought about it for a minute,

285
0:10:09.792,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and I said, okay, how can we make that work better?

286
0:10:11.869,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So then I thought about impact.

287
0:10:13.727,000 --> 0:10:14,000
What about if we use a big hammer

288
0:10:15.561,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and we swing it and we hit the nail like this,

289
0:10:18.093,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in the place of putting the hammer on the nail

290
0:10:20.067,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and pushing and try to put it in? That won't work.

291
0:10:22.262,000 --> 0:10:23,000
So what the idea is

292
0:10:24.193,000 --> 0:10:25,000
is to use the idea of an impact.

293
0:10:25.937,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So we accelerate the pistons with steam,

294
0:10:28.019,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that takes a little bit of time,

295
0:10:29.298,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but then, bang! you hit the piston,

296
0:10:31.281,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and, baff!, all the energy is done instantly,

297
0:10:33.833,000 --> 0:10:34,000
down instantly to the liquid,

298
0:10:35.429,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and that compresses the plasma much faster.

299
0:10:37.479,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So I decided, okay, this is good, let's make that.

300
0:10:39.927,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So we built this machine in this garage here.

301
0:10:43.652,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We made a small machine

302
0:10:44.737,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that we managed to squeeze

303
0:10:46.709,000 --> 0:10:47,000
a little bit of neutrons out of that,

304
0:10:48.357,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and those are my marketing neutrons,

305
0:10:50.558,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and with those marketing neutrons,

306
0:10:52.001,000 --> 0:10:54,000
then I raised about 50 million dollars,

307
0:10:54.6,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and I hired 65 people. That's my team here.

308
0:10:57.49,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And this is what we want to build.

309
0:10:59.072,000 --> 0:11:,000
So it's going to be a big machine,

310
0:11:00.586,000 --> 0:11:01,000
about three meters in diameter,

311
0:11:02.06,000 --> 0:11:03,000
liquid lead spinning around,

312
0:11:03.862,000 --> 0:11:04,000
big vortex in the center,

313
0:11:05.454,000 --> 0:11:07,000
put the plasma on the top and on the bottom,

314
0:11:07.774,000 --> 0:11:08,000
piston hits on the side,

315
0:11:09.2,000 --> 0:11:1,000
bang!, it compresses it,

316
0:11:10.71,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and it will make some energy,

317
0:11:11.994,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and the neutron will come out in the liquid metal,

318
0:11:14.386,000 --> 0:11:16,000
going to go in a steam engine and make the turbine,

319
0:11:16.986,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and some of the steam will go back

320
0:11:18.492,000 --> 0:11:18,000
to fire the piston.

321
0:11:19.49,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We're going to run that about one time per second,

322
0:11:21.38,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and it will produce 100 megawatts of electricity.

323
0:11:26.764,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Okay, we also built this injector,

324
0:11:28.449,000 --> 0:11:3,000
so this injector makes the plasma to start with.

325
0:11:30.736,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It makes the plasma at about

326
0:11:32.451,000 --> 0:11:35,000
a lukewarm temperature of three million degrees C.

327
0:11:36.426,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Unfortunately, it doesn't last quite long enough,

328
0:11:38.633,000 --> 0:11:41,000
so we need to extend the life of the plasma a little bit,

329
0:11:41.768,000 --> 0:11:42,000
but last month it got a lot better,

330
0:11:43.4,000 --> 0:11:45,000
so I think we have the plasma compressing now.

331
0:11:45.985,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Then we built a small sphere, about this big,

332
0:11:48.541,000 --> 0:11:49,000
14 pistons around it,

333
0:11:50.007,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and this will compress the liquid.

334
0:11:52.331,000 --> 0:11:54,000
However, plasma is difficult to compress.

335
0:11:54.436,000 --> 0:11:54,000
When you compress it,

336
0:11:55.225,000 --> 0:11:57,000
it tends to go a little bit crooked like that,

337
0:11:57.777,000 --> 0:11:58,000
so you need the timing of the piston

338
0:11:59.385,000 --> 0:12:,000
to be very good,

339
0:12:00.481,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and for that we use several control systems,

340
0:12:03.153,000 --> 0:12:05,000
which was not possible in 1970,

341
0:12:05.355,000 --> 0:12:06,000
but we now can do that

342
0:12:06.747,000 --> 0:12:09,000
with nice, new electronics.

343
0:12:10.039,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So finally, most people think that fusion

344
0:12:12.568,000 --> 0:12:14,000
is in the future and will never happen,

345
0:12:14.72,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but as a matter of fact, fusion is getting very close.

346
0:12:17.814,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We are almost there.

347
0:12:18.89,000 --> 0:12:2,000
The big labs have shown that fusion is doable,

348
0:12:21.527,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and now there are small companies that are thinking about that,

349
0:12:23.834,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and they say, it's not that it cannot be done,

350
0:12:26.195,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but it's how to make it cost-effectively.

351
0:12:28.3,000 --> 0:12:3,000
General Fusion is one of those small companies,

352
0:12:30.453,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and hopefully, very soon, somebody, someone,

353
0:12:33.771,000 --> 0:12:34,000
will crack that nut,

354
0:12:35.054,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and perhaps it will be General Fusion.

355
0:12:36.628,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Thank you very much.

356
0:12:38.407,000 --> 0:12:42,000

1
0:00:12.62,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So I've been "futuring," which is a term I made up --

2
0:00:16.02,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:17.3,000 --> 0:00:18,000
about three seconds ago.

4
0:00:18.54,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I've been futuring for about 20 years,

5
0:00:21.38,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and when I first started, I would sit down with people,

6
0:00:24.74,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and say, "Hey, let's talk 10, 20 years out."

7
0:00:27.66,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And they'd say, "Great."

8
0:00:29.46,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And I've been seeing that time horizon

9
0:00:31.98,000 --> 0:00:33,000
get shorter and shorter

10
0:00:34.06,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and shorter,

11
0:00:35.7,000 --> 0:00:38,000
so much so that I met with a CEO two months ago

12
0:00:39.1,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and I said -- we started our initial conversation.

13
0:00:41.5,000 --> 0:00:44,000
He goes, "I love what you do. I want to talk about the next six months."

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:47.86,000 --> 0:00:5,000
We have a lot of problems that we are facing.

16
0:00:51.02,000 --> 0:00:53,000
These are civilizational-scale problems.

17
0:00:55.34,000 --> 0:00:56,000
The issue though is,

18
0:00:57.42,000 --> 0:00:58,000
we can't solve them

19
0:00:59.14,000 --> 0:01:01,000
using the mental models that we use right now

20
0:01:01.74,000 --> 0:01:02,000
to try and solve these problems.

21
0:01:03.34,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Yes, a lot of great technical work is being done,

22
0:01:06.02,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but there is a problem that we need to solve for a priori, before,

23
0:01:11.42,000 --> 0:01:13,000
if we want to really move the needle on those big problems.

24
0:01:14.98,000 --> 0:01:15,000
"Short-termism."

25
0:01:16.74,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Right? There's no marches. There's no bracelets.

26
0:01:19.22,000 --> 0:01:22,000
There's no petitions that you can sign to be against short-termism.

27
0:01:23.1,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I tried to put one up, and no one signed.

28
0:01:25.94,000 --> 0:01:26,000
It was weird.

29
0:01:27.18,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:29.1,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But it prevents us from doing so much.

31
0:01:32.14,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Short-termism, for many reasons,

32
0:01:34.86,000 --> 0:01:36,000
has pervaded every nook and cranny of our reality.

33
0:01:37.78,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I just want you to take a second

34
0:01:39.38,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and just think about an issue that you're thinking, working on.

35
0:01:43.22,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It could be personal, it could be at work

36
0:01:45.22,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or it could be move-the-needle world stuff,

37
0:01:47.3,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and think about how far out you tend to think

38
0:01:49.66,000 --> 0:01:51,000
about the solution set for that.

39
0:01:53.74,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Because short-termism prevents the CEO

40
0:01:58.18,000 --> 0:02:,000
from buying really expensive safety equipment.

41
0:02:01.74,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It'll hurt the bottom line.

42
0:02:03.74,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So we get the Deepwater Horizon.

43
0:02:06.22,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Short-termism prevents teachers

44
0:02:08.98,000 --> 0:02:11,000
from spending quality one-on-one time with their students.

45
0:02:12.54,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So right now in America,

46
0:02:14.7,000 --> 0:02:16,000
a high school student drops out every 26 seconds.

47
0:02:19.18,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Short-termism prevents Congress --

48
0:02:21.94,000 --> 0:02:23,000
sorry if there's anyone in here from Congress --

49
0:02:24.58,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:26.14,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or not really that sorry --

51
0:02:28.22,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:30.46,000 --> 0:02:33,000
from putting money into a real infrastructure bill.

53
0:02:33.66,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So what we get is the I-35W bridge collapse

54
0:02:36.3,000 --> 0:02:37,000
over the Mississippi a few years ago,

55
0:02:38.14,000 --> 0:02:39,000
13 killed.

56
0:02:40.58,000 --> 0:02:42,000
It wasn't always like this. We did the Panama Canal.

57
0:02:44.42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We pretty much have eradicated global polio.

58
0:02:46.7,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We did the transcontinental railroad, the Marshall Plan.

59
0:02:50.38,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And it's not just big, physical infrastructure problems and issues.

60
0:02:54.74,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Women's suffrage, the right to vote.

61
0:02:56.66,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But in our short-termist time,

62
0:02:59.46,000 --> 0:03:01,000
where everything seems to happen right now

63
0:03:01.98,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and we can only think out past the next tweet or timeline post,

64
0:03:06.5,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we get hyper-reactionary.

65
0:03:08.54,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So what do we do?

66
0:03:10.7,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We take people who are fleeing their war-torn country,

67
0:03:13.98,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and we go after them.

68
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We take low-level drug offenders, and we put them away for life.

69
0:03:18.9,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And then we build McMansions without even thinking

70
0:03:21.3,000 --> 0:03:23,000
about how people are going to get between them and their job.

71
0:03:24.19,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's a quick buck.

72
0:03:26.58,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Now, the reality is, for a lot of these problems,

73
0:03:28.94,000 --> 0:03:3,000
there are some technical fixes,

74
0:03:31.74,000 --> 0:03:32,000
a lot of them.

75
0:03:32.98,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I call these technical fixes sandbag strategies.

76
0:03:36.54,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So you know there's a storm coming,

77
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
the levee is broken, no one's put any money into it,

78
0:03:41.02,000 --> 0:03:42,000
you surround your home with sandbags.

79
0:03:42.86,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And guess what? It works.

80
0:03:46.42,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Storm goes away, the water level goes down,

81
0:03:48.46,000 --> 0:03:49,000
you get rid of the sandbags,

82
0:03:49.86,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and you do this storm after storm after storm.

83
0:03:53.74,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And here's the insidious thing.

84
0:03:55.94,000 --> 0:03:56,000
A sandbag strategy

85
0:03:57.86,000 --> 0:03:58,000
can get you reelected.

86
0:04:00.14,000 --> 0:04:01,000
A sandbag strategy

87
0:04:01.54,000 --> 0:04:02,000
can help you make your quarterly numbers.

88
0:04:06.06,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, if we want to move forward

89
0:04:09.06,000 --> 0:04:11,000
into a different future than the one we have right now,

90
0:04:11.86,000 --> 0:04:13,000
because I don't think we've hit --

91
0:04:13.94,000 --> 0:04:14,000
2016 is not peak civilization.

92
0:04:15.94,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:17.3,000 --> 0:04:18,000
There's some more we can do.

94
0:04:19.1,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But my argument is that unless we shift our mental models and our mental maps

95
0:04:23.74,000 --> 0:04:25,000
on how we think about the short,

96
0:04:26.1,000 --> 0:04:27,000
it's not going to happen.

97
0:04:27.82,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So what I've developed is something called "longpath,"

98
0:04:30.82,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and it's a practice.

99
0:04:32.58,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And longpath isn't a kind of one-and-done exercise.

100
0:04:36.54,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I'm sure everyone here at some point has done an off-site

101
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
with a lot of Post-It notes and whiteboards,

102
0:04:41.38,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and you do --

103
0:04:44.3,000 --> 0:04:46,000
no offense to the consultants in here who do that --

104
0:04:46.78,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and you do a long-term plan,

105
0:04:48.42,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and then two weeks later, everyone forgets about it.

106
0:04:52.46,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Right? Or a week later. If you're lucky, three months.

107
0:04:56.66,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It's a practice because it's not necessarily a thing that you do.

108
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It's a process where you have to revisit different ways of thinking

109
0:05:04.06,000 --> 0:05:06,000
for every major decision that you're working on.

110
0:05:06.5,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So I want to go through those three ways of thinking.

111
0:05:09.78,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So the first: transgenerational thinking.

112
0:05:13.18,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I love the philosophers:

113
0:05:15.42,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Plato, Socrates, Habermas, Heidegger.

114
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I was raised on them.

115
0:05:19.86,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But they all did one thing

116
0:05:21.82,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that didn't actually seem like a big deal

117
0:05:23.82,000 --> 0:05:25,000
until I really started kind of looking into this.

118
0:05:26.18,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And they all took,

119
0:05:28.02,000 --> 0:05:3,000
as a unit of measure for their entire reality

120
0:05:30.94,000 --> 0:05:31,000
of what it meant to be virtuous and good,

121
0:05:33.7,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the single lifespan,

122
0:05:35.78,000 --> 0:05:36,000
from birth to death.

123
0:05:37.46,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But here's a problem with these issues:

124
0:05:39.54,000 --> 0:05:4,000
they stack up on top of us,

125
0:05:40.98,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because the only way we know how to do something good in the world

126
0:05:44.14,000 --> 0:05:46,000
is if we do it between our birth and our death.

127
0:05:46.38,000 --> 0:05:47,000
That's what we're programmed to do.

128
0:05:48.1,000 --> 0:05:5,000
If you go to the self-help section in any bookstore,

129
0:05:50.58,000 --> 0:05:51,000
it's all about you.

130
0:05:53.22,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Which is great,

131
0:05:55.1,000 --> 0:05:57,000
unless you're dealing with some of these major issues.

132
0:05:59.78,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And so with transgenerational thinking,

133
0:06:03.1,000 --> 0:06:05,000
which is really kind of transgenerational ethics,

134
0:06:05.78,000 --> 0:06:08,000
you're able to expand how you think about these problems,

135
0:06:09.42,000 --> 0:06:11,000
what is your role in helping to solve them.

136
0:06:13.54,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Now, this isn't something that just has to be done at the Security Council chamber.

137
0:06:18.3,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It's something that you can do in a very kind of personal way.

138
0:06:21.58,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So every once in a while, if I'm lucky, my wife and I like to go out to dinner,

139
0:06:26.02,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and we have three children under the age of seven.

140
0:06:29.3,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So you can imagine it's a very peaceful, quiet meal.

141
0:06:31.753,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

142
0:06:32.98,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So we sit down and literally all I want to do is just eat and chill,

143
0:06:38.58,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and my kids have a completely and totally different idea

144
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of what we're going to be doing.

145
0:06:42.86,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And so my first idea

146
0:06:45.22,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is my sandbag strategy, right?

147
0:06:47.14,000 --> 0:06:49,000
It's to go into my pocket and take out the iPhone

148
0:06:49.5,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and give them "Frozen"

149
0:06:50.98,000 --> 0:06:52,000
or some other bestselling game thing.

150
0:06:55.06,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And then I stop

151
0:06:58.78,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and I have to kind of put on this transgenerational thinking cap.

152
0:07:03.38,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I don't do this in the restaurant, because it would be bizarre,

153
0:07:06.38,000 --> 0:07:07,000
but I have to --

154
0:07:07.7,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I did it once, and that's how I learned it was bizarre.

155
0:07:10.34,000 --> 0:07:11,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:11.38,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And you have to kind of think, "OK, I can do this."

157
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But what is this teaching them?

158
0:07:19.3,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So what does it mean if I actually bring some paper

159
0:07:21.94,000 --> 0:07:22,000
or engage with them in conversation?

160
0:07:23.7,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's hard. It's not easy, and I'm making this very personal.

161
0:07:26.58,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's actually more traumatic

162
0:07:27.98,000 --> 0:07:29,000
than some of the big issues that I work on in the world --

163
0:07:30.74,000 --> 0:07:31,000
entertaining my kids at dinner.

164
0:07:33.38,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But what it does is it connects them here in the present with me,

165
0:07:36.54,000 --> 0:07:37,000
but it also --

166
0:07:37.82,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and this is the crux of transgenerational thinking ethics --

167
0:07:41.3,000 --> 0:07:44,000
it sets them up to how they're going to interact with their kids

168
0:07:44.62,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and their kids and their kids.

169
0:07:48.18,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Second, futures thinking.

170
0:07:50.5,000 --> 0:07:51,000
When we think about the future,

171
0:07:52.5,000 --> 0:07:53,000
10, 15 years out,

172
0:07:54.74,000 --> 0:07:55,000
give me a vision of what the future is.

173
0:07:57.82,000 --> 0:07:59,000
You don't have to give it to me, but think in your head.

174
0:08:00.5,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And what you're probably going to see

175
0:08:02.66,000 --> 0:08:03,000
is the dominant cultural lens

176
0:08:04.5,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that dominates our thinking about the future right now:

177
0:08:07.58,000 --> 0:08:08,000
technology.

178
0:08:09.66,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So when we think about the problems,

179
0:08:11.42,000 --> 0:08:13,000
we always put it through a technological lens,

180
0:08:13.62,000 --> 0:08:16,000
a tech-centric, a techno-utopia, and there's nothing wrong with that,

181
0:08:16.9,000 --> 0:08:19,000
but it's something that we have to really think deeply about

182
0:08:20.22,000 --> 0:08:22,000
if we're going to move on these major issues,

183
0:08:23.1,000 --> 0:08:25,000
because it wasn't always like this. Right?

184
0:08:25.18,000 --> 0:08:27,000
The ancients had their way of thinking

185
0:08:28.66,000 --> 0:08:29,000
about what the future was.

186
0:08:31.46,000 --> 0:08:35,000
The Church definitely had their idea of what the future could be,

187
0:08:36.38,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and you could actually pay your way into that future. Right?

188
0:08:39.34,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And luckily for humanity,

189
0:08:41.3,000 --> 0:08:43,000
we got the scientific revolution.

190
0:08:43.46,000 --> 0:08:44,000
From there, we got the technology,

191
0:08:45.14,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but what has happened --

192
0:08:46.82,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And by the way, this is not a critique.

193
0:08:50.14,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I love technology.

194
0:08:52.54,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Everything in my house talks back to me,

195
0:08:54.499,000 --> 0:08:56,000
from my children to my speakers to everything.

196
0:08:56.7,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:59.54,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But we've abdicated the future from the high priests in Rome

198
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to the high priests of Silicon Valley.

199
0:09:09.7,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So when we think, well, how are we going to deal with climate

200
0:09:13.06,000 --> 0:09:14,000
or with poverty or homelessness,

201
0:09:14.66,000 --> 0:09:17,000
our first reaction is to think about it through a technology lens.

202
0:09:18.9,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And look, I'm not advocating that we go to this guy.

203
0:09:23.54,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I love Joel, don't get me wrong,

204
0:09:26.22,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but I'm not saying we go to Joel.

205
0:09:27.9,000 --> 0:09:28,000
What I'm saying is we have to rethink

206
0:09:29.74,000 --> 0:09:33,000
our base assumption about only looking at the future in one way,

207
0:09:34.54,000 --> 0:09:36,000
only looking at it through the dominant lens.

208
0:09:36.7,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Because our problems are so big and so vast

209
0:09:38.9,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that we need to open ourselves up.

210
0:09:41.74,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So that's why I do everything in my power not to talk about the future.

211
0:09:46.14,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I talk about futures.

212
0:09:48.74,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It opens the conversation again.

213
0:09:50.5,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So when you're sitting and thinking

214
0:09:52.98,000 --> 0:09:55,000
about how do we move forward on this major issue --

215
0:09:56.18,000 --> 0:09:57,000
it could be at home,

216
0:09:57.74,000 --> 0:09:58,000
it could be at work,

217
0:09:59.74,000 --> 0:10:01,000
it could be again on the global stage --

218
0:10:02.62,000 --> 0:10:06,000
don't cut yourself off from thinking about something beyond technology as a fix

219
0:10:07.06,000 --> 0:10:1,000
because we're more concerned about technological evolution right now

220
0:10:10.62,000 --> 0:10:12,000
than we are about moral evolution.

221
0:10:12.78,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And unless we fix for that,

222
0:10:14.82,000 --> 0:10:16,000
we're not going to be able to get out of short-termism

223
0:10:17.42,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and get to where we want to be.

224
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
The final, telos thinking. This comes from the Greek root.

225
0:10:22.5,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Ultimate aim and ultimate purpose.

226
0:10:24.78,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And it's really asking one question:

227
0:10:27.94,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to what end?

228
0:10:30.1,000 --> 0:10:33,000
When was the last time you asked yourself: To what end?

229
0:10:33.14,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And when you asked yourself that, how far out did you go?

230
0:10:37.46,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Because long isn't long enough anymore.

231
0:10:41.38,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Three, five years doesn't cut it.

232
0:10:43.3,000 --> 0:10:45,000
It's 30, 40, 50, 100 years.

233
0:10:46.62,000 --> 0:10:48,000
In Homer's epic, "The Odyssey,"

234
0:10:48.86,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Odysseus had the answer to his "what end."

235
0:10:51.94,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It was Ithaca.

236
0:10:53.7,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It was this bold vision of what he wanted --

237
0:10:55.82,000 --> 0:10:56,000
to return to Penelope.

238
0:10:57.22,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And I can tell you, because of the work that I'm doing,

239
0:10:59.86,000 --> 0:11:01,000
but also you know it intuitively -- we have lost our Ithaca.

240
0:11:02.74,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We have lost our "to what end," so we stay on this hamster wheel.

241
0:11:06.3,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And yes, we're trying to solve these problems,

242
0:11:08.5,000 --> 0:11:1,000
but what comes after we solve the problem?

243
0:11:11.98,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And unless you define what comes after, people aren't going to move.

244
0:11:16.22,000 --> 0:11:18,000
The businesses -- this isn't just about business --

245
0:11:18.66,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but the businesses that do consistently, who break out of short-termism

246
0:11:22.02,000 --> 0:11:24,000
not surprisingly are family-run businesses.

247
0:11:24.06,000 --> 0:11:27,000
They're transgenerational. They're telos. They think about the futures.

248
0:11:27.66,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And this is an ad for Patek Philippe. They're 175 years old,

249
0:11:31.38,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and what's amazing is that they literally embody

250
0:11:34.46,000 --> 0:11:36,000
this kind of longpathian sense in their brand,

251
0:11:37.3,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because, by the way, you never actually own a Patek Philippe,

252
0:11:40.22,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and I definitely won't --

253
0:11:41.82,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Laughter)

254
0:11:42.86,000 --> 0:11:45,000
unless somebody wants to just throw 25,000 dollars on the stage.

255
0:11:45.884,000 --> 0:11:48,000
You merely look after it for the next generation.

256
0:11:50.66,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So it's important that we remember,

257
0:11:53.14,000 --> 0:11:56,000
the future, we treat it like a noun.

258
0:11:56.3,000 --> 0:11:58,000
It's not. It's a verb.

259
0:11:58.58,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It requires action.

260
0:11:59.86,000 --> 0:12:,000
It requires us to push into it.

261
0:12:01.7,000 --> 0:12:02,000
It's not this thing that washes over us.

262
0:12:03.66,000 --> 0:12:05,000
It's something that we actually have total control over.

263
0:12:06.34,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But in a short-term society, we end up feeling like we don't.

264
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We feel like we're trapped.

265
0:12:10.62,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We can push through that.

266
0:12:13.82,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Now I'm getting more comfortable

267
0:12:17.02,000 --> 0:12:19,000
in the fact that at some point

268
0:12:20.18,000 --> 0:12:21,000
in the inevitable future,

269
0:12:22.82,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I will die.

270
0:12:25.06,000 --> 0:12:29,000
But because of these new ways of thinking and doing,

271
0:12:29.18,000 --> 0:12:32,000
both in the outside world and also with my family at home,

272
0:12:33.14,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and what I'm leaving my kids, I get more comfortable in that fact.

273
0:12:36.3,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And it's something that a lot of us are really uncomfortable with,

274
0:12:39.46,000 --> 0:12:4,000
but I'm telling you,

275
0:12:41.66,000 --> 0:12:42,000
think it through.

276
0:12:43.1,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Apply this type of thinking and you can push yourself past

277
0:12:45.86,000 --> 0:12:47,000
what's inevitably very, very uncomfortable.

278
0:12:47.94,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And it all begins really with yourself asking this question:

279
0:12:52.66,000 --> 0:12:53,000
What is your longpath?

280
0:12:55.7,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But I ask you, when you ask yourself that

281
0:12:58.62,000 --> 0:13:,000
now or tonight or behind a steering wheel

282
0:13:00.9,000 --> 0:13:03,000
or in the boardroom or the situation room:

283
0:13:06.14,000 --> 0:13:08,000
push past the longpath,

284
0:13:08.34,000 --> 0:13:11,000
quick, oh, what's my longpath the next three years or five years?

285
0:13:11.66,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Try and push past your own life if you can

286
0:13:15.3,000 --> 0:13:17,000
because it makes you do things a little bit bigger

287
0:13:17.7,000 --> 0:13:18,000
than you thought were possible.

288
0:13:20.62,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Yes, we have huge, huge problems out there.

289
0:13:25.62,000 --> 0:13:27,000
With this process, with this thinking,

290
0:13:28.94,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I think we can make a difference.

291
0:13:31.06,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I think you can make a difference,

292
0:13:33.62,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and I believe in you guys.

293
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Thank you.

294
0:13:36.5,000 --> 0:13:41,000
(Applause)

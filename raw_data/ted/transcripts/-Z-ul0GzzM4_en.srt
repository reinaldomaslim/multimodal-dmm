1
0:00:12.721,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I work with children with autism.

2
0:00:15.391,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Specifically, I make technologies

3
0:00:17.305,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to help them communicate.

4
0:00:19.476,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Now, many of the problems that children

5
0:00:21.015,000 --> 0:00:24,000
with autism face, they have a common source,

6
0:00:24.778,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and that source is that they find it difficult

7
0:00:26.872,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to understand abstraction, symbolism.

8
0:00:32.132,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And because of this, they have a lot of difficulty with language.

9
0:00:36.784,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Let me tell you a little bit about why this is.

10
0:00:39.799,000 --> 0:00:42,000
You see that this is a picture of a bowl of soup.

11
0:00:43.733,000 --> 0:00:45,000
All of us can see it. All of us understand this.

12
0:00:46.218,000 --> 0:00:48,000
These are two other pictures of soup,

13
0:00:48.53,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but you can see that these are more abstract

14
0:00:50.597,000 --> 0:00:51,000
These are not quite as concrete.

15
0:00:52.453,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And when you get to language,

16
0:00:54.627,000 --> 0:00:55,000
you see that it becomes a word

17
0:00:56.495,000 --> 0:00:59,000
whose look, the way it looks and the way it sounds,

18
0:00:59.756,000 --> 0:01:01,000
has absolutely nothing to do with what it started with,

19
0:01:02.668,000 --> 0:01:04,000
or what it represents, which is the bowl of soup.

20
0:01:05.498,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So it's essentially a completely abstract,

21
0:01:08.398,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a completely arbitrary representation of something

22
0:01:10.974,000 --> 0:01:11,000
which is in the real world,

23
0:01:12.137,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and this is something that children with autism

24
0:01:13.928,000 --> 0:01:16,000
have an incredible amount of difficulty with.

25
0:01:17.092,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now that's why most of the people that work with children with autism --

26
0:01:19.843,000 --> 0:01:2,000
speech therapists, educators --

27
0:01:21.721,000 --> 0:01:23,000
what they do is, they try to help children with autism

28
0:01:24.354,000 --> 0:01:27,000
communicate not with words, but with pictures.

29
0:01:27.583,000 --> 0:01:28,000
So if a child with autism wanted to say,

30
0:01:29.513,000 --> 0:01:31,000
"I want soup," that child would pick

31
0:01:31.971,000 --> 0:01:33,000
three different pictures, "I," "want," and "soup,"

32
0:01:34.231,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and they would put these together,

33
0:01:35.84,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and then the therapist or the parent would

34
0:01:37.707,000 --> 0:01:38,000
understand that this is what the kid wants to say.

35
0:01:39.594,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And this has been incredibly effective;

36
0:01:41.372,000 --> 0:01:43,000
for the last 30, 40 years

37
0:01:43.513,000 --> 0:01:44,000
people have been doing this.

38
0:01:45.126,000 --> 0:01:46,000
In fact, a few years back,

39
0:01:46.475,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I developed an app for the iPad

40
0:01:49.15,000 --> 0:01:51,000
which does exactly this. It's called Avaz,

41
0:01:51.405,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and the way it works is that kids select

42
0:01:53.684,000 --> 0:01:54,000
different pictures.

43
0:01:55.005,000 --> 0:01:57,000
These pictures are sequenced together to form sentences,

44
0:01:57.575,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and these sentences are spoken out.

45
0:01:59.294,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So Avaz is essentially converting pictures,

46
0:02:02.319,000 --> 0:02:05,000
it's a translator, it converts pictures into speech.

47
0:02:06.279,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now, this was very effective.

48
0:02:07.997,000 --> 0:02:08,000
There are thousands of children using this,

49
0:02:09.381,000 --> 0:02:1,000
you know, all over the world,

50
0:02:10.811,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and I started thinking about

51
0:02:12.986,000 --> 0:02:14,000
what it does and what it doesn't do.

52
0:02:15.64,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And I realized something interesting:

53
0:02:17.324,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Avaz helps children with autism learn words.

54
0:02:21.527,000 --> 0:02:23,000
What it doesn't help them do is to learn

55
0:02:23.932,000 --> 0:02:25,000
word patterns.

56
0:02:26.68,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Let me explain this in a little more detail.

57
0:02:29.152,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Take this sentence: "I want soup tonight."

58
0:02:32.209,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now it's not just the words here that convey the meaning.

59
0:02:36.289,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's also the way in which these words are arranged,

60
0:02:39.429,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the way these words are modified and arranged.

61
0:02:41.959,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And that's why a sentence like "I want soup tonight"

62
0:02:44.265,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is different from a sentence like

63
0:02:46.249,000 --> 0:02:49,000
"Soup want I tonight," which is completely meaningless.

64
0:02:49.561,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So there is another hidden abstraction here

65
0:02:52.18,000 --> 0:02:55,000
which children with autism find a lot of difficulty coping with,

66
0:02:55.737,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and that's the fact that you can modify words

67
0:02:58.577,000 --> 0:03:,000
and you can arrange them to have

68
0:03:00.678,000 --> 0:03:02,000
different meanings, to convey different ideas.

69
0:03:03.573,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now, this is what we call grammar.

70
0:03:07.032,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And grammar is incredibly powerful,

71
0:03:09.068,000 --> 0:03:12,000
because grammar is this one component of language

72
0:03:12.225,000 --> 0:03:15,000
which takes this finite vocabulary that all of us have

73
0:03:15.714,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and allows us to convey an infinite amount of information,

74
0:03:20.245,000 --> 0:03:22,000
an infinite amount of ideas.

75
0:03:22.379,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's the way in which you can put things together

76
0:03:24.381,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in order to convey anything you want to.

77
0:03:26.549,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And so after I developed Avaz,

78
0:03:28.676,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I worried for a very long time

79
0:03:30.244,000 --> 0:03:33,000
about how I could give grammar to children with autism.

80
0:03:34.154,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The solution came to me from a very interesting perspective.

81
0:03:36.429,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I happened to chance upon a child with autism

82
0:03:39.878,000 --> 0:03:41,000
conversing with her mom,

83
0:03:41.987,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and this is what happened.

84
0:03:44.081,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Completely out of the blue, very spontaneously,

85
0:03:46.267,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the child got up and said, "Eat."

86
0:03:48.73,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now what was interesting was

87
0:03:50.5,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the way in which the mom was trying to tease out

88
0:03:54.744,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the meaning of what the child wanted to say

89
0:03:56.957,000 --> 0:03:58,000
by talking to her in questions.

90
0:03:59.217,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So she asked, "Eat what? Do you want to eat ice cream?

91
0:04:01.81,000 --> 0:04:03,000
You want to eat? Somebody else wants to eat?

92
0:04:03.922,000 --> 0:04:06,000
You want to eat cream now? You want to eat ice cream in the evening?"

93
0:04:07.235,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And then it struck me that

94
0:04:08.749,000 --> 0:04:1,000
what the mother had done was something incredible.

95
0:04:10.777,000 --> 0:04:11,000
She had been able to get that child to communicate

96
0:04:12.771,000 --> 0:04:16,000
an idea to her without grammar.

97
0:04:16.909,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And it struck me that maybe this is what

98
0:04:19.605,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I was looking for.

99
0:04:20.99,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Instead of arranging words in an order, in sequence,

100
0:04:25.132,000 --> 0:04:27,000
as a sentence, you arrange them

101
0:04:27.304,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in this map, where they're all linked together

102
0:04:31.115,000 --> 0:04:33,000
not by placing them one after the other

103
0:04:33.258,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but in questions, in question-answer pairs.

104
0:04:36.542,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And so if you do this, then what you're conveying

105
0:04:38.9,000 --> 0:04:39,000
is not a sentence in English,

106
0:04:40.886,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but what you're conveying is really a meaning,

107
0:04:43.852,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the meaning of a sentence in English.

108
0:04:45.363,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Now, meaning is really the underbelly, in some sense, of language.

109
0:04:48.295,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It's what comes after thought but before language.

110
0:04:52.116,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And the idea was that this particular representation

111
0:04:54.619,000 --> 0:04:57,000
might convey meaning in its raw form.

112
0:04:57.88,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So I was very excited by this, you know,

113
0:04:59.651,000 --> 0:05:,000
hopping around all over the place,

114
0:05:01.144,000 --> 0:05:02,000
trying to figure out if I can convert

115
0:05:02.915,000 --> 0:05:04,000
all possible sentences that I hear into this.

116
0:05:05.439,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And I found that this is not enough.

117
0:05:07.212,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Why is this not enough?

118
0:05:08.597,000 --> 0:05:09,000
This is not enough because if you wanted to convey

119
0:05:10.308,000 --> 0:05:12,000
something like negation,

120
0:05:12.558,000 --> 0:05:13,000
you want to say, "I don't want soup,"

121
0:05:14.294,000 --> 0:05:16,000
then you can't do that by asking a question.

122
0:05:16.514,000 --> 0:05:18,000
You do that by changing the word "want."

123
0:05:18.799,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Again, if you wanted to say,

124
0:05:20.436,000 --> 0:05:21,000
"I wanted soup yesterday,"

125
0:05:22.416,000 --> 0:05:24,000
you do that by converting the word "want" into "wanted."

126
0:05:25.153,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It's a past tense.

127
0:05:26.819,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So this is a flourish which I added

128
0:05:28.922,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to make the system complete.

129
0:05:30.498,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This is a map of words joined together

130
0:05:32.475,000 --> 0:05:33,000
as questions and answers,

131
0:05:34.131,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and with these filters applied on top of them

132
0:05:36.395,000 --> 0:05:37,000
in order to modify them to represent

133
0:05:38.212,000 --> 0:05:39,000
certain nuances.

134
0:05:39.921,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Let me show you this with a different example.

135
0:05:41.872,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Let's take this sentence:

136
0:05:43.126,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"I told the carpenter I could not pay him."

137
0:05:45.106,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It's a fairly complicated sentence.

138
0:05:46.898,000 --> 0:05:47,000
The way that this particular system works,

139
0:05:48.791,000 --> 0:05:5,000
you can start with any part of this sentence.

140
0:05:51.369,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I'm going to start with the word "tell."

141
0:05:53.067,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So this is the word "tell."

142
0:05:54.529,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now this happened in the past,

143
0:05:56.129,000 --> 0:05:58,000
so I'm going to make that "told."

144
0:05:58.352,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Now, what I'm going to do is,

145
0:06:00.06,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I'm going to ask questions.

146
0:06:01.816,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So, who told? I told.

147
0:06:04.18,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I told whom? I told the carpenter.

148
0:06:06.107,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Now we start with a different part of the sentence.

149
0:06:07.858,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We start with the word "pay,"

150
0:06:09.725,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and we add the ability filter to it to make it "can pay."

151
0:06:14.302,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Then we make it "can't pay,"

152
0:06:16.403,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and we can make it "couldn't pay"

153
0:06:18.002,000 --> 0:06:19,000
by making it the past tense.

154
0:06:19.665,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So who couldn't pay? I couldn't pay.

155
0:06:21.588,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Couldn't pay whom? I couldn't pay the carpenter.

156
0:06:24.264,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And then you join these two together

157
0:06:25.995,000 --> 0:06:26,000
by asking this question:

158
0:06:27.345,000 --> 0:06:28,000
What did I tell the carpenter?

159
0:06:29.082,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I told the carpenter I could not pay him.

160
0:06:33.131,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Now think about this. This is

161
0:06:35.068,000 --> 0:06:38,000
—(Applause)—

162
0:06:38.61,000 --> 0:06:41,000
this is a representation of this sentence

163
0:06:42.282,000 --> 0:06:44,000
without language.

164
0:06:44.717,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And there are two or three interesting things about this.

165
0:06:46.909,000 --> 0:06:49,000
First of all, I could have started anywhere.

166
0:06:50.04,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I didn't have to start with the word "tell."

167
0:06:52.283,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I could have started anywhere in the sentence,

168
0:06:53.699,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and I could have made this entire thing.

169
0:06:55.206,000 --> 0:06:57,000
The second thing is, if I wasn't an English speaker,

170
0:06:57.982,000 --> 0:06:59,000
if I was speaking in some other language,

171
0:07:00.157,000 --> 0:07:03,000
this map would actually hold true in any language.

172
0:07:03.313,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So long as the questions are standardized,

173
0:07:05.303,000 --> 0:07:09,000
the map is actually independent of language.

174
0:07:09.59,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So I call this FreeSpeech,

175
0:07:11.705,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and I was playing with this for many, many months.

176
0:07:14.64,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I was trying out so many different combinations of this.

177
0:07:17.366,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And then I noticed something very interesting about FreeSpeech.

178
0:07:19.655,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I was trying to convert language,

179
0:07:22.898,000 --> 0:07:24,000
convert sentences in English into sentences in FreeSpeech,

180
0:07:25.282,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and vice versa, and back and forth.

181
0:07:27.034,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And I realized that this particular configuration,

182
0:07:29.289,000 --> 0:07:31,000
this particular way of representing language,

183
0:07:31.315,000 --> 0:07:35,000
it allowed me to actually create very concise rules

184
0:07:35.71,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that go between FreeSpeech on one side

185
0:07:38.444,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and English on the other.

186
0:07:39.932,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So I could actually write this set of rules

187
0:07:42.112,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that translates from this particular representation into English.

188
0:07:45.507,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And so I developed this thing.

189
0:07:47.338,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I developed this thing called the FreeSpeech Engine

190
0:07:49.57,000 --> 0:07:51,000
which takes any FreeSpeech sentence as the input

191
0:07:52.131,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and gives out perfectly grammatical English text.

192
0:07:56.061,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And by putting these two pieces together,

193
0:07:57.666,000 --> 0:07:58,000
the representation and the engine,

194
0:07:59.547,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I was able to create an app, a technology for children with autism,

195
0:08:03.343,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that not only gives them words

196
0:08:05.842,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but also gives them grammar.

197
0:08:09.783,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So I tried this out with kids with autism,

198
0:08:12.143,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and I found that there was an incredible amount of identification.

199
0:08:17.156,000 --> 0:08:19,000
They were able to create sentences in FreeSpeech

200
0:08:19.876,000 --> 0:08:21,000
which were much more complicated but much more effective

201
0:08:22.434,000 --> 0:08:24,000
than equivalent sentences in English,

202
0:08:25.333,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and I started thinking about

203
0:08:27.015,000 --> 0:08:28,000
why that might be the case.

204
0:08:28.984,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And I had an idea, and I want to talk to you about this idea next.

205
0:08:33.271,000 --> 0:08:36,000
In about 1997, about 15 years back,

206
0:08:36.413,000 --> 0:08:38,000
there were a group of scientists that were trying

207
0:08:38.424,000 --> 0:08:4,000
to understand how the brain processes language,

208
0:08:40.813,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and they found something very interesting.

209
0:08:42.592,000 --> 0:08:43,000
They found that when you learn a language

210
0:08:44.464,000 --> 0:08:46,000
as a child, as a two-year-old,

211
0:08:47.376,000 --> 0:08:49,000
you learn it with a certain part of your brain,

212
0:08:49.742,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and when you learn a language as an adult --

213
0:08:51.342,000 --> 0:08:54,000
for example, if I wanted to learn Japanese right now —

214
0:08:55.253,000 --> 0:08:57,000
a completely different part of my brain is used.

215
0:08:57.96,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Now I don't know why that's the case,

216
0:08:59.791,000 --> 0:09:,000
but my guess is that that's because

217
0:09:01.782,000 --> 0:09:03,000
when you learn a language as an adult,

218
0:09:04.219,000 --> 0:09:05,000
you almost invariably learn it

219
0:09:05.835,000 --> 0:09:09,000
through your native language, or through your first language.

220
0:09:10.101,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So what's interesting about FreeSpeech

221
0:09:13.353,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is that when you create a sentence

222
0:09:15.155,000 --> 0:09:16,000
or when you create language,

223
0:09:16.85,000 --> 0:09:19,000
a child with autism creates language with FreeSpeech,

224
0:09:19.92,000 --> 0:09:2,000
they're not using this support language,

225
0:09:21.753,000 --> 0:09:23,000
they're not using this bridge language.

226
0:09:23.964,000 --> 0:09:25,000
They're directly constructing the sentence.

227
0:09:26.621,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And so this gave me this idea.

228
0:09:28.814,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Is it possible to use FreeSpeech

229
0:09:30.838,000 --> 0:09:32,000
not for children with autism

230
0:09:33.348,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but to teach language to people without disabilities?

231
0:09:39.61,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And so I tried a number of experiments.

232
0:09:41.588,000 --> 0:09:43,000
The first thing I did was I built a jigsaw puzzle

233
0:09:44.536,000 --> 0:09:45,000
in which these questions and answers

234
0:09:46.506,000 --> 0:09:47,000
are coded in the form of shapes,

235
0:09:48.341,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in the form of colors,

236
0:09:49.479,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and you have people putting these together

237
0:09:51.328,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and trying to understand how this works.

238
0:09:53.101,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And I built an app out of it, a game out of it,

239
0:09:55.477,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in which children can play with words

240
0:09:58.138,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and with a reinforcement,

241
0:09:59.842,000 --> 0:10:01,000
a sound reinforcement of visual structures,

242
0:10:02.427,000 --> 0:10:04,000
they're able to learn language.

243
0:10:04.44,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And this, this has a lot of potential, a lot of promise,

244
0:10:07.176,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and the government of India recently

245
0:10:09.151,000 --> 0:10:1,000
licensed this technology from us,

246
0:10:10.555,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and they're going to try it out with millions of different children

247
0:10:12.629,000 --> 0:10:14,000
trying to teach them English.

248
0:10:15.234,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And the dream, the hope, the vision, really,

249
0:10:17.848,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is that when they learn English this way,

250
0:10:20.93,000 --> 0:10:22,000
they learn it with the same proficiency

251
0:10:23.573,000 --> 0:10:26,000
as their mother tongue.

252
0:10:27.291,000 --> 0:10:3,000
All right, let's talk about something else.

253
0:10:31.107,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Let's talk about speech.

254
0:10:33.104,000 --> 0:10:34,000
This is speech.

255
0:10:34.375,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So speech is the primary mode of communication

256
0:10:36.337,000 --> 0:10:37,000
delivered between all of us.

257
0:10:37.95,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Now what's interesting about speech is that

258
0:10:39.805,000 --> 0:10:4,000
speech is one-dimensional.

259
0:10:41.05,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Why is it one-dimensional?

260
0:10:42.409,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It's one-dimensional because it's sound.

261
0:10:43.977,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It's also one-dimensional because

262
0:10:45.516,000 --> 0:10:46,000
our mouths are built that way.

263
0:10:46.721,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Our mouths are built to create one-dimensional sound.

264
0:10:50.233,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But if you think about the brain,

265
0:10:53.099,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the thoughts that we have in our heads

266
0:10:54.863,000 --> 0:10:56,000
are not one-dimensional.

267
0:10:56.965,000 --> 0:10:57,000
I mean, we have these rich,

268
0:10:58.424,000 --> 0:11:01,000
complicated, multi-dimensional ideas.

269
0:11:01.452,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Now, it seems to me that language

270
0:11:03.142,000 --> 0:11:05,000
is really the brain's invention

271
0:11:05.474,000 --> 0:11:08,000
to convert this rich, multi-dimensional thought

272
0:11:08.57,000 --> 0:11:09,000
on one hand

273
0:11:10.157,000 --> 0:11:11,000
into speech on the other hand.

274
0:11:12.08,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Now what's interesting is that

275
0:11:13.842,000 --> 0:11:15,000
we do a lot of work in information nowadays,

276
0:11:16.41,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and almost all of that is done in the language domain.

277
0:11:19.489,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Take Google, for example.

278
0:11:21.428,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Google trawls all these countless billions of websites,

279
0:11:24.105,000 --> 0:11:26,000
all of which are in English, and when you want to use Google,

280
0:11:26.83,000 --> 0:11:28,000
you go into Google search, and you type in English,

281
0:11:29.28,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and it matches the English with the English.

282
0:11:33.443,000 --> 0:11:36,000
What if we could do this in FreeSpeech instead?

283
0:11:37.026,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I have a suspicion that if we did this,

284
0:11:39.327,000 --> 0:11:41,000
we'd find that algorithms like searching,

285
0:11:41.395,000 --> 0:11:43,000
like retrieval, all of these things,

286
0:11:43.72,000 --> 0:11:46,000
are much simpler and also more effective,

287
0:11:46.795,000 --> 0:11:5,000
because they don't process the data structure of speech.

288
0:11:51.212,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Instead they're processing the data structure of thought.

289
0:11:57.188,000 --> 0:11:59,000
The data structure of thought.

290
0:11:59.996,000 --> 0:12:01,000
That's a provocative idea.

291
0:12:02.072,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But let's look at this in a little more detail.

292
0:12:04.214,000 --> 0:12:06,000
So this is the FreeSpeech ecosystem.

293
0:12:06.58,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We have the Free Speech representation on one side,

294
0:12:09.464,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and we have the FreeSpeech Engine, which generates English.

295
0:12:11.694,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Now if you think about it,

296
0:12:13.419,000 --> 0:12:15,000
FreeSpeech, I told you, is completely language-independent.

297
0:12:15.963,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It doesn't have any specific information in it

298
0:12:18.05,000 --> 0:12:19,000
which is about English.

299
0:12:19.278,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So everything that this system knows about English

300
0:12:22.078,000 --> 0:12:26,000
is actually encoded into the engine.

301
0:12:26.698,000 --> 0:12:28,000
That's a pretty interesting concept in itself.

302
0:12:28.935,000 --> 0:12:31,000
You've encoded an entire human language

303
0:12:32.539,000 --> 0:12:34,000
into a software program.

304
0:12:35.184,000 --> 0:12:37,000
But if you look at what's inside the engine,

305
0:12:37.715,000 --> 0:12:39,000
it's actually not very complicated.

306
0:12:40.073,000 --> 0:12:42,000
It's not very complicated code.

307
0:12:42.178,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And what's more interesting is the fact that

308
0:12:44.85,000 --> 0:12:46,000
the vast majority of the code in that engine

309
0:12:47.053,000 --> 0:12:49,000
is not really English-specific.

310
0:12:49.465,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And that gives this interesting idea.

311
0:12:51.36,000 --> 0:12:53,000
It might be very easy for us to actually

312
0:12:53.398,000 --> 0:12:56,000
create these engines in many, many different languages,

313
0:12:57.224,000 --> 0:13:03,000
in Hindi, in French, in German, in Swahili.

314
0:13:03.578,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And that gives another interesting idea.

315
0:13:06.377,000 --> 0:13:08,000
For example, supposing I was a writer,

316
0:13:09.031,000 --> 0:13:11,000
say, for a newspaper or for a magazine.

317
0:13:11.153,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I could create content in one language, FreeSpeech,

318
0:13:16.164,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and the person who's consuming that content,

319
0:13:18.22,000 --> 0:13:21,000
the person who's reading that particular information

320
0:13:21.281,000 --> 0:13:23,000
could choose any engine,

321
0:13:23.776,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and they could read it in their own mother tongue,

322
0:13:26.512,000 --> 0:13:29,000
in their native language.

323
0:13:30.451,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I mean, this is an incredibly attractive idea,

324
0:13:33.173,000 --> 0:13:34,000
especially for India.

325
0:13:35.172,000 --> 0:13:36,000
We have so many different languages.

326
0:13:36.862,000 --> 0:13:38,000
There's a song about India, and there's a description

327
0:13:39.004,000 --> 0:13:41,000
of the country as, it says,

328
0:13:41.348,000 --> 0:13:43,000
(in Sanskrit).

329
0:13:43.708,000 --> 0:13:45,000
That means "ever-smiling speaker

330
0:13:46.481,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of beautiful languages."

331
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Language is beautiful.

332
0:13:52.964,000 --> 0:13:54,000
I think it's the most beautiful of human creations.

333
0:13:55.418,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I think it's the loveliest thing that our brains have invented.

334
0:13:59.396,000 --> 0:14:02,000
It entertains, it educates, it enlightens,

335
0:14:02.98,000 --> 0:14:04,000
but what I like the most about language

336
0:14:05.024,000 --> 0:14:06,000
is that it empowers.

337
0:14:06.524,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I want to leave you with this.

338
0:14:08.362,000 --> 0:14:1,000
This is a photograph of my collaborators,

339
0:14:10.747,000 --> 0:14:1,000
my earliest collaborators

340
0:14:11.744,000 --> 0:14:12,000
when I started working on language

341
0:14:13.206,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and autism and various other things.

342
0:14:14.708,000 --> 0:14:15,000
The girl's name is Pavna,

343
0:14:16.125,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and that's her mother, Kalpana.

344
0:14:18.027,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And Pavna's an entrepreneur,

345
0:14:20.165,000 --> 0:14:22,000
but her story is much more remarkable than mine,

346
0:14:22.536,000 --> 0:14:24,000
because Pavna is about 23.

347
0:14:24.936,000 --> 0:14:26,000
She has quadriplegic cerebral palsy,

348
0:14:27.488,000 --> 0:14:28,000
so ever since she was born,

349
0:14:29.128,000 --> 0:14:32,000
she could neither move nor talk.

350
0:14:32.728,000 --> 0:14:34,000
And everything that she's accomplished so far,

351
0:14:35.131,000 --> 0:14:37,000
finishing school, going to college,

352
0:14:37.358,000 --> 0:14:38,000
starting a company,

353
0:14:38.774,000 --> 0:14:4,000
collaborating with me to develop Avaz,

354
0:14:40.914,000 --> 0:14:41,000
all of these things she's done

355
0:14:42.806,000 --> 0:14:47,000
with nothing more than moving her eyes.

356
0:14:48.329,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Daniel Webster said this:

357
0:14:51.018,000 --> 0:14:53,000
He said, "If all of my possessions were taken

358
0:14:53.958,000 --> 0:14:55,000
from me with one exception,

359
0:14:56.946,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I would choose to keep the power of communication,

360
0:14:59.927,000 --> 0:15:02,000
for with it, I would regain all the rest."

361
0:15:03.83,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And that's why, of all of these incredible applications of FreeSpeech,

362
0:15:08.946,000 --> 0:15:1,000
the one that's closest to my heart

363
0:15:11.026,000 --> 0:15:13,000
still remains the ability for this

364
0:15:13.094,000 --> 0:15:15,000
to empower children with disabilities

365
0:15:15.474,000 --> 0:15:16,000
to be able to communicate,

366
0:15:17.247,000 --> 0:15:18,000
the power of communication,

367
0:15:19.036,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to get back all the rest.

368
0:15:21.276,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Thank you.

369
0:15:22.673,000 --> 0:15:23,000
(Applause)

370
0:15:24.005,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Thank you. (Applause)

371
0:15:28.204,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

372
0:15:33.527,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

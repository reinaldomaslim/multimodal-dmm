1
0:00:13.491,000 --> 0:00:15,000
For over 40 years, I've been a clinical social worker

2
0:00:16.19,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and a developmental psychologist.

3
0:00:18.466,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And it seemed almost natural for me to go into the helping professions.

4
0:00:22.285,000 --> 0:00:25,000
My parents had taught me to do good for others.

5
0:00:26.551,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And so I devoted my career

6
0:00:29.072,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to working with families in some of the toughest circumstances:

7
0:00:32.852,000 --> 0:00:34,000
poverty, mental illness,

8
0:00:35.05,000 --> 0:00:37,000
immigration, refugees.

9
0:00:38.516,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And for all those years, I've worked with hope and with optimism.

10
0:00:43.857,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In the past five years, though,

11
0:00:45.918,000 --> 0:00:48,000
my hope and my optimism have been put to the test.

12
0:00:50.414,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I've been so deeply disappointed in the way the United States government

13
0:00:54.719,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is treating families who are coming to our southern border,

14
0:00:59.156,000 --> 0:01:01,000
asking for asylum --

15
0:01:01.306,000 --> 0:01:07,000
desperate parents with children, from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras,

16
0:01:07.424,000 --> 0:01:1,000
who only want to bring their kids to safety and security.

17
0:01:11.683,000 --> 0:01:13,000
They are fleeing some of the worst violence in the world.

18
0:01:14.401,000 --> 0:01:15,000
They've been attacked by gangs,

19
0:01:16.983,000 --> 0:01:18,000
assaulted, raped, extorted, threatened.

20
0:01:20.822,000 --> 0:01:21,000
They have faced death.

21
0:01:22.976,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And they can't turn to their police because the police are complicit,

22
0:01:27.162,000 --> 0:01:28,000
corrupt, ineffective.

23
0:01:29.404,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Then they get to our border,

24
0:01:32.095,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and we put them in detention centers,

25
0:01:34.354,000 --> 0:01:36,000
prisons, as if they were common criminals.

26
0:01:39.625,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Back in 2014, I met some of the first children in detention centers.

27
0:01:46.737,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And I wept.

28
0:01:48.631,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I sat in my car afterwards and I cried.

29
0:01:53.041,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I was seeing some of the worst suffering I'd ever known,

30
0:01:56.968,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and it went against everything I believed in my country,

31
0:01:59.694,000 --> 0:02:,000
the rule of law

32
0:02:02.399,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and everything my parents taught me.

33
0:02:06.751,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The way the United States has handled the immigrants

34
0:02:11.607,000 --> 0:02:12,000
seeking asylum in our country

35
0:02:13.076,000 --> 0:02:14,000
over the past five years --

36
0:02:14.426,000 --> 0:02:16,000
it's wrong, just simply wrong.

37
0:02:18.635,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Tonight, I want to tell you that children in immigration detention

38
0:02:21.856,000 --> 0:02:22,000
are being traumatized.

39
0:02:24.516,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And we are causing the trauma.

40
0:02:28.166,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We in America --

41
0:02:29.643,000 --> 0:02:31,000
actually, those of us here tonight --

42
0:02:32.189,000 --> 0:02:35,000
will not necessarily be on the same page with respect to immigration.

43
0:02:37.182,000 --> 0:02:39,000
We'll disagree on how we're going to handle all those people

44
0:02:40.172,000 --> 0:02:41,000
who want to come to our country.

45
0:02:43.369,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Frankly, it doesn't matter to me whether you're a Republican or a Democrat,

46
0:02:46.999,000 --> 0:02:47,000
liberal or conservative.

47
0:02:50.83,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I want secure borders.

48
0:02:54.552,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I also want to keep the bad actors out.

49
0:02:59.678,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I want national security.

50
0:03:01.868,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And of course, you'll have your ideas about those topics, too.

51
0:03:07.18,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But I think we can agree

52
0:03:09.44,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that America should not be doing harm.

53
0:03:13.31,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The government, the state, should not be in the business of hurting children.

54
0:03:18.855,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It should be protecting them,

55
0:03:21.864,000 --> 0:03:22,000
no matter whose children they are:

56
0:03:23.762,000 --> 0:03:25,000
your children, my grandchildren

57
0:03:28.093,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and the children of families just looking for asylum.

58
0:03:34.227,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, I could tell you story after story

59
0:03:37.092,000 --> 0:03:4,000
of children who have witnessed some of the worst violence in the world

60
0:03:40.433,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and are now sitting in detention.

61
0:03:42.887,000 --> 0:03:46,000
But two little boys have stayed with me over these past five years.

62
0:03:48.766,000 --> 0:03:49,000
One of them was Danny.

63
0:03:51.024,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Danny was seven and a half years old when I met him in a detention center

64
0:03:54.503,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in Karnes City, Texas, back in 2014.

65
0:03:56.944,000 --> 0:03:58,000
He was there with his mother and his brother,

66
0:03:59.09,000 --> 0:04:,000
and they had fled Honduras.

67
0:04:01.9,000 --> 0:04:04,000
You know, Danny is one of these kids that you get to love instantly.

68
0:04:05.605,000 --> 0:04:07,000
He's funny, he's innocent,

69
0:04:08.252,000 --> 0:04:1,000
he's charming and very expressive.

70
0:04:11.931,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And he's drawing pictures for me,

71
0:04:14.542,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and one of the pictures he drew for me was of the Revos Locos.

72
0:04:18.479,000 --> 0:04:2,000
The Revos Locos: this is the name

73
0:04:21.436,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that they gave to gangs in the town that he was in.

74
0:04:25.329,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I said to Danny,

75
0:04:26.954,000 --> 0:04:28,000
"Danny, what makes them bad guys?"

76
0:04:30.44,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Danny looked at me with puzzlement.

77
0:04:33.71,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I mean, the look was more like,

78
0:04:36.239,000 --> 0:04:38,000
"Are you clueless or just stupid?"

79
0:04:38.615,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:40.509,000 --> 0:04:41,000
He leaned in and he whispered,

81
0:04:42.152,000 --> 0:04:43,000
"Don't you see?

82
0:04:44.101,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They smoke cigarettes."

83
0:04:45.787,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:47.806,000 --> 0:04:48,000
"And they drink beer."

85
0:04:50.669,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Danny had learned, of course, about the evils of drinking and smoking.

86
0:04:55.383,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Then he said, "And they carry guns."

87
0:04:58.342,000 --> 0:05:,000
In one of the pictures,

88
0:05:00.797,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the stick figures of the Revos Locos are shooting at birds and at people.

89
0:05:05.835,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Danny told me about the day his uncle was killed by those Revos Locos

90
0:05:10.748,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and how he ran from his house to his uncle's farmhouse,

91
0:05:13.699,000 --> 0:05:15,000
only to see his uncle's dead body,

92
0:05:16.168,000 --> 0:05:19,000
his face disfigured by bullets.

93
0:05:20.507,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And Danny told me he saw his uncle's teeth coming out the back of his head.

94
0:05:25.548,000 --> 0:05:26,000
He was only six at the time.

95
0:05:27.893,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Sometime after that,

96
0:05:29.388,000 --> 0:05:33,000
one of those Revos Locos beat little Danny badly, severely,

97
0:05:33.912,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and that's when his parents said,

98
0:05:35.794,000 --> 0:05:38,000
"We have got to leave or they will kill us."

99
0:05:41.087,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So they set out.

100
0:05:42.959,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But Danny's father was a single-leg amputee with a crutch,

101
0:05:45.791,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and he couldn't manage the rugged terrain.

102
0:05:48.585,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So he said to his wife,

103
0:05:51.578,000 --> 0:05:53,000
"Go without me. Take our boys.

104
0:05:55.111,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Save our boys."

105
0:05:57.155,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So Mom and the boys set off.

106
0:05:58.994,000 --> 0:06:,000
Danny told me he looked back, said goodbye to his father,

107
0:06:01.767,000 --> 0:06:04,000
looked back a couple of times until he lost sight of his father.

108
0:06:04.998,000 --> 0:06:07,000
In detention, he had not heard from his father.

109
0:06:08.134,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And it's very likely that his father was killed by the Revos Locos,

110
0:06:11.695,000 --> 0:06:12,000
because he had tried to flee.

111
0:06:14.128,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I can't forget Danny.

112
0:06:19.664,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The other boy was Fernando.

113
0:06:22.187,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Now, Fernando was in the same detention center,

114
0:06:25.447,000 --> 0:06:26,000
roughly the same age as Danny.

115
0:06:27.899,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Fernando was telling me about the 24 hours he spent in isolation with his mother

116
0:06:32.356,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in the detention center,

117
0:06:33.559,000 --> 0:06:36,000
placed there because his mother had led a hunger strike

118
0:06:36.756,000 --> 0:06:38,000
among the mothers in the detention center,

119
0:06:38.832,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and now she was cracking under the pressure of the guards,

120
0:06:41.631,000 --> 0:06:44,000
who were threatening and being very abusive towards her and Fernando.

121
0:06:45.869,000 --> 0:06:48,000
As Fernando and I are talking in the small office,

122
0:06:49.129,000 --> 0:06:5,000
his mother burst in,

123
0:06:51.03,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and she says, "They hear you! They're listening to you."

124
0:06:55.274,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And she dropped to her hands and knees,

125
0:06:59.315,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and she began to look under the table, groping under all the chairs.

126
0:07:02.827,000 --> 0:07:04,000
She looked at the electric sockets,

127
0:07:05.69,000 --> 0:07:07,000
at the corner of the room,

128
0:07:07.928,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the floor, the corner of the ceiling,

129
0:07:09.834,000 --> 0:07:13,000
at the lamp, at the air vent, looking for hidden microphones and cameras.

130
0:07:15.403,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I watched Fernando as he watched his mother spiral

131
0:07:19.778,000 --> 0:07:2,000
into this paranoid state.

132
0:07:22.161,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I looked in his eyes and I saw utter terror.

133
0:07:25.826,000 --> 0:07:28,000
After all, who would take care of him if she couldn't?

134
0:07:29.324,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It was just the two of them. They only had each other.

135
0:07:32.912,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I could tell you story after story,

136
0:07:37.782,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but I haven't forgotten Fernando.

137
0:07:41.901,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And I know something about what that kind of trauma,

138
0:07:45.356,000 --> 0:07:47,000
stress and adversity does to children.

139
0:07:48.913,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So I'm going to get clinical with you for a moment,

140
0:07:51.561,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and I'm going to be the professor that I am.

141
0:07:54.772,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Under prolonged and intense stress,

142
0:07:59.068,000 --> 0:08:02,000
trauma, hardship, adversity, harsh conditions,

143
0:08:04.42,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the developing brain is harmed,

144
0:08:07.991,000 --> 0:08:08,000
plain and simple.

145
0:08:09.998,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Its wiring and its architecture

146
0:08:11.778,000 --> 0:08:12,000
are damaged.

147
0:08:13.349,000 --> 0:08:16,000
The child's natural stress response system is affected.

148
0:08:17.917,000 --> 0:08:18,000
It's weakened of its protective factors.

149
0:08:20.467,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Regions of the brain that are associated with cognition,

150
0:08:25.428,000 --> 0:08:26,000
intellectual abilities,

151
0:08:27.391,000 --> 0:08:31,000
judgment, trust, self-regulation, social interaction,

152
0:08:31.465,000 --> 0:08:33,000
are weakened, sometimes permanently.

153
0:08:34.538,000 --> 0:08:35,000
That impairs children's future.

154
0:08:37.374,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We also know that under stress, the child's immune system is suppressed,

155
0:08:41.469,000 --> 0:08:44,000
making them susceptible to infections.

156
0:08:45.331,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Chronic illnesses, like diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular disease,

157
0:08:51.34,000 --> 0:08:56,000
will follow those children into adulthood and likely shorten their lives.

158
0:08:57.43,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Mental health problems are linked to the breakdown of the body.

159
0:09:01.689,000 --> 0:09:02,000
I have seen children in detention

160
0:09:04.559,000 --> 0:09:07,000
who have recurrent and disturbing nightmares,

161
0:09:07.985,000 --> 0:09:09,000
night terrors,

162
0:09:10.11,000 --> 0:09:12,000
depression and anxiety,

163
0:09:12.976,000 --> 0:09:14,000
dissociative reactions,

164
0:09:15.483,000 --> 0:09:17,000
hopelessness, suicidal thinking

165
0:09:18.441,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and post-traumatic stress disorders.

166
0:09:21.315,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And they regress in their behavior,

167
0:09:23.353,000 --> 0:09:25,000
like the 11-year-old boy

168
0:09:27.076,000 --> 0:09:29,000
who began to wet his bed again after years of continence.

169
0:09:31.073,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And the eight-year-old girl who was buckling under the pressure

170
0:09:34.204,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and was insisting that her mother breastfeed her.

171
0:09:36.873,000 --> 0:09:38,000
That is what detention does to children.

172
0:09:41.923,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Now, you may ask:

173
0:09:46.341,000 --> 0:09:47,000
What do we do?

174
0:09:47.826,000 --> 0:09:48,000
What should our government do?

175
0:09:50.049,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Well, I'm just a mental health professional,

176
0:09:53.219,000 --> 0:09:56,000
so all I really know is about children's health and development.

177
0:09:56.635,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But I have some ideas.

178
0:09:58.519,000 --> 0:10:01,000
First, we need to reframe our practices.

179
0:10:02.748,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We need to replace fear and hostility

180
0:10:06.416,000 --> 0:10:07,000
with safety and compassion.

181
0:10:10.182,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We need to tear down the prison walls,

182
0:10:12.891,000 --> 0:10:14,000
the barbed wire, take away the cages.

183
0:10:15.989,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Instead of prison, or prisons,

184
0:10:20.099,000 --> 0:10:25,000
we should create orderly asylum processing centers,

185
0:10:25.277,000 --> 0:10:27,000
campus-like communities

186
0:10:27.644,000 --> 0:10:29,000
where children and families can live together.

187
0:10:30.834,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We could take old motels, old army barracks,

188
0:10:34.049,000 --> 0:10:37,000
refit them so that children and parents can live as family units

189
0:10:37.886,000 --> 0:10:39,000
in some safety and normality,

190
0:10:39.989,000 --> 0:10:4,000
where kids can run around.

191
0:10:42.172,000 --> 0:10:44,000
In these processing centers,

192
0:10:44.294,000 --> 0:10:47,000
pediatricians, family doctors,

193
0:10:47.44,000 --> 0:10:48,000
dentists and nurses,

194
0:10:49.18,000 --> 0:10:51,000
would be screening, examining,

195
0:10:51.713,000 --> 0:10:52,000
treating and immunizing children,

196
0:10:53.397,000 --> 0:10:56,000
creating records that will follow them to their next medical provider.

197
0:10:57.983,000 --> 0:11:,000
Social workers would be conducting mental health evaluations

198
0:11:03.266,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and providing treatment for those who need it.

199
0:11:05.851,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Those social workers would be connecting families

200
0:11:08.547,000 --> 0:11:11,000
to services that they're going to need, wherever they're headed.

201
0:11:11.851,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And teachers would be teaching and testing children

202
0:11:16.424,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and documenting their learning

203
0:11:19.088,000 --> 0:11:2,000
so that the teachers at the next school

204
0:11:21.051,000 --> 0:11:23,000
can continue those children's education.

205
0:11:23.868,000 --> 0:11:26,000
There's a lot more that we could do in these processing centers.

206
0:11:29.319,000 --> 0:11:3,000
A lot more.

207
0:11:31.146,000 --> 0:11:32,000
And you probably are thinking,

208
0:11:33.073,000 --> 0:11:35,000
this is pie-in-the-sky stuff.

209
0:11:37.458,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Can't blame you.

210
0:11:39.262,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Well, let me tell you that refugee camps all over the world are holding families

211
0:11:44.194,000 --> 0:11:46,000
like those in our detention centers,

212
0:11:46.777,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and some of those refugee camps are getting it right

213
0:11:51.178,000 --> 0:11:52,000
far better than we are.

214
0:11:53.332,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The United Nations has issued reports describing refugee camps

215
0:11:58.041,000 --> 0:12:,000
that protect children's health and development.

216
0:12:01.076,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Children and parents live in family units

217
0:12:04.956,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and clusters of families are housed together.

218
0:12:08.327,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Parents are given work permits so they can earn some money,

219
0:12:11.525,000 --> 0:12:15,000
they're given food vouchers so they can go to the local stores and shop.

220
0:12:16.916,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Mothers are brought together to cook healthy meals for the children,

221
0:12:20.509,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and children go to school every day and are taught.

222
0:12:24.802,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Afterwards, after school, they go home and they ride bikes,

223
0:12:27.72,000 --> 0:12:3,000
hang out with friends, do homework and explore the world --

224
0:12:31.436,000 --> 0:12:33,000
all the essentials for child development.

225
0:12:36.3,000 --> 0:12:38,000
We can get it right. We have the resources to get it right.

226
0:12:40.681,000 --> 0:12:45,000
What we need is the will and the insistence of Americans

227
0:12:48.24,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that we treat children humanely.

228
0:12:52.663,000 --> 0:12:57,000
You know, I can't forget Danny or Fernando.

229
0:12:58.339,000 --> 0:12:59,000
I wonder where they are today,

230
0:13:00.175,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and I pray that they are healthy and happy.

231
0:13:03.594,000 --> 0:13:05,000
They are only two of the many children I met

232
0:13:05.737,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and of the thousands we know about who have been in detention.

233
0:13:10.528,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I may be saddened

234
0:13:13.185,000 --> 0:13:15,000
by what's happened to the children,

235
0:13:15.623,000 --> 0:13:16,000
but I'm inspired by them.

236
0:13:18.205,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I may cry, as I did,

237
0:13:22.55,000 --> 0:13:24,000
but I admire those children's strength.

238
0:13:25.818,000 --> 0:13:28,000
They keep alive my hope and my optimism in the work I do.

239
0:13:30.686,000 --> 0:13:34,000
So while we may differ on our approach to immigration,

240
0:13:35.109,000 --> 0:13:38,000
we should be treating children with dignity and respect.

241
0:13:39.325,000 --> 0:13:4,000
We should do right by them.

242
0:13:41.998,000 --> 0:13:42,000
If we do,

243
0:13:44.12,000 --> 0:13:47,000
we can prepare those children who remain in the United States,

244
0:13:47.835,000 --> 0:13:51,000
prepare them to become productive, engaged members of our society.

245
0:13:53.543,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And those who will return to their countries whether voluntarily or not

246
0:13:57.808,000 --> 0:14:,000
will be prepared to become the teachers, the merchants, the leaders

247
0:14:01.493,000 --> 0:14:02,000
in their country.

248
0:14:03.149,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And I hope together all of those children and parents

249
0:14:06.631,000 --> 0:14:1,000
could give testimony to the world about the goodness of our country

250
0:14:10.971,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and our values.

251
0:14:12.907,000 --> 0:14:13,000
But we have to get it right.

252
0:14:15.988,000 --> 0:14:19,000
So we can agree to disagree on immigration,

253
0:14:20.161,000 --> 0:14:22,000
but I hope we can agree on one thing:

254
0:14:22.377,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that none of us wants to look back at this moment in our history,

255
0:14:27.89,000 --> 0:14:31,000
when we knew we were inflicting lifelong trauma on children,

256
0:14:32.767,000 --> 0:14:34,000
and that we sat back and did nothing.

257
0:14:37.495,000 --> 0:14:4,000
That would be the greatest tragedy of all.

258
0:14:42.827,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Thank you.

259
0:14:44.025,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Applause)

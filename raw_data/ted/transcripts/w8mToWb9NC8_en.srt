1
0:00:13.496,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So you know when you're doubled over in pain

2
0:00:16.415,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and you're wondering, is it your appendix

3
0:00:18.637,000 --> 0:00:19,000
or maybe you ate something funny?

4
0:00:21.472,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Well, when that happens to me, I call my friend Sasha --

5
0:00:25.209,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Sasha is a doctor --

6
0:00:26.4,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I say, "Should I rush to the nearest emergency room

7
0:00:29.12,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in a panic?

8
0:00:30.515,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Or am I OK to relax and just wait it out?"

9
0:00:33.837,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Yes, I am that annoying friend.

10
0:00:39.011,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But in September 2017,

11
0:00:41.44,000 --> 0:00:44,000
friends of mine were suddenly calling me

12
0:00:44.75,000 --> 0:00:45,000
for my professional opinion.

13
0:00:47.868,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And no, I'm not a doctor,

14
0:00:49.654,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but they were asking me questions of life and death.

15
0:00:53.444,000 --> 0:00:56,000
So what was going on in September of 2017?

16
0:00:57.37,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Well, North Korea was suddenly and scarily all over the news.

17
0:01:02.752,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Kim Jong-un had tested missiles

18
0:01:05.021,000 --> 0:01:08,000
potentially capable of hitting major US cities,

19
0:01:08.967,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and President Trump had responded with tweets of "fire and fury."

20
0:01:14.097,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And there was real concern that tensions would escalate

21
0:01:18.185,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to a potential war

22
0:01:19.685,000 --> 0:01:21,000
or even nuclear weapons use.

23
0:01:23.067,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So what my friends were calling and asking was:

24
0:01:25.845,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Should they panic or were the OK to relax?

25
0:01:30.615,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But really, they were asking me a fundamental question:

26
0:01:36.44,000 --> 0:01:37,000
"Am I safe?"

27
0:01:40.396,000 --> 0:01:44,000
While I was reassuring them that, no, they didn't need to worry just yet,

28
0:01:44.896,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the irony of their question dawned on me.

29
0:01:48.094,000 --> 0:01:5,000
What they hadn't really thought about

30
0:01:51.067,000 --> 0:01:54,000
is that we've all been living under a much larger cloud for decades --

31
0:01:54.838,000 --> 0:01:56,000
potentially a mushroom cloud --

32
0:01:56.988,000 --> 0:01:57,000
without giving it much thought.

33
0:02:00.114,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now it's not surprising that friends of mine

34
0:02:02.218,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and many others like them don't know much about nuclear weapons

35
0:02:05.273,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and don't think about them.

36
0:02:06.837,000 --> 0:02:08,000
After all, the end of the Cold War,

37
0:02:09.78,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the United States and Russia, tension abated,

38
0:02:13.635,000 --> 0:02:14,000
we started dismantling nuclear weapons,

39
0:02:15.531,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and they started to become a relic of the past.

40
0:02:19.177,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Generations didn't have to grow up with the specter of nuclear war

41
0:02:22.353,000 --> 0:02:23,000
hanging over their heads.

42
0:02:25.367,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And there other reasons people don't like to think about nuclear weapons.

43
0:02:28.908,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's scary, overwhelming.

44
0:02:31.382,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I get it.

45
0:02:32.749,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Sometimes I wish I could have chosen a cheerier field to study.

46
0:02:35.94,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:37.01,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Perhaps tax law would have been more uplifting.

48
0:02:39.264,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:42.557,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But in addition to that,

50
0:02:44.836,000 --> 0:02:47,000
people have so many other things to think about in their busy lives,

51
0:02:48.248,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and they'd much prefer to think about something over which

52
0:02:51.058,000 --> 0:02:53,000
they feel they have some semblance of control,

53
0:02:53.734,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and they assume that other people, smarter than they on this topic,

54
0:02:57.297,000 --> 0:02:59,000
are working away to keep us all safe.

55
0:03:01.317,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And then, there are other reasons people don't talk about this,

56
0:03:04.682,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and one is because we, as nuclear experts,

57
0:03:07.492,000 --> 0:03:1,000
use a whole lot of convoluted jargon and terminology

58
0:03:10.887,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to talk about these issues:

59
0:03:13.227,000 --> 0:03:16,000
CVID, ICBM, JCPOA.

60
0:03:17.782,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's really inaccessible for a lot of people.

61
0:03:21.678,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And, in reality, it actually sometimes I think makes us numb

62
0:03:25.336,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to what we're really talking about here.

63
0:03:28.843,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And what we are really talking about here

64
0:03:31.518,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is the fact that,

65
0:03:32.693,000 --> 0:03:35,000
while we've made dramatic reductions in the number of nuclear weapons

66
0:03:35.957,000 --> 0:03:36,000
since the Cold War,

67
0:03:37.368,000 --> 0:03:42,000
right now, there are almost 15,000 in the world today.

68
0:03:43.806,000 --> 0:03:44,000
15,000.

69
0:03:47.709,000 --> 0:03:51,000
The United States and Russia have over 90 percent of these nuclear weapons.

70
0:03:53.034,000 --> 0:03:56,000
If you're wondering, these are the countries that have the rest.

71
0:03:57.303,000 --> 0:03:58,000
But they have far fewer,

72
0:03:59.098,000 --> 0:04:02,000
ranging in the sort of 300-ish range and below.

73
0:04:05.112,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Adding to this situation is the fact that we have new technologies

74
0:04:08.702,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that potentially bring us new challenges.

75
0:04:11.791,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Could you imagine, one day, countries like ours and others

76
0:04:17.274,000 --> 0:04:21,000
potentially ceding decisions about a nuclear strike to a robot,

77
0:04:22.688,000 --> 0:04:24,000
based on algorithms?

78
0:04:24.813,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And what data do they use to inform those algorithms?

79
0:04:28.438,000 --> 0:04:29,000
This is pretty terrifying.

80
0:04:31.098,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So adding to this are terrorism potential,

81
0:04:35.844,000 --> 0:04:37,000
cyberattacks, miscalculation, misunderstanding.

82
0:04:38.734,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The list of nuclear nightmares tends to grow longer by the day.

83
0:04:42.273,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And there are a number of former officials,

84
0:04:45.035,000 --> 0:04:46,000
as well as experts,

85
0:04:46.798,000 --> 0:04:49,000
who worry that right now, we're in greater danger

86
0:04:50.075,000 --> 0:04:53,000
than we were in various points in the Cold War.

87
0:04:54.759,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So this is scary.

88
0:04:56.877,000 --> 0:04:57,000
What can we do?

89
0:04:58.958,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Well, thankfully,

90
0:05:00.132,000 --> 0:05:01,000
["Duck and Cover"]

91
0:05:01.322,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we don't have to rely on the advice from the 1950s.

92
0:05:04.719,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:05.751,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We can take some control,

94
0:05:07.76,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and the way we do that

95
0:05:09.528,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is by starting to ask some fundamental questions

96
0:05:12.783,000 --> 0:05:14,000
about the status quo

97
0:05:14.811,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and whether we are happy with the way it is.

98
0:05:18.529,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We need to begin asking questions of ourselves

99
0:05:20.759,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and of our elected officials,

100
0:05:22.527,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and I'd like to share three with you today.

101
0:05:26.798,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The first one is,

102
0:05:29.02,000 --> 0:05:33,000
"How much nuclear risk are you willing to take or tolerate?"

103
0:05:34.805,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Right now, nuclear policy depends on deterrence theory.

104
0:05:39.336,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Developed in the 1950s,

105
0:05:41.082,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the idea is that one country's nuclear weapons

106
0:05:43.774,000 --> 0:05:45,000
prevents another country from using theirs.

107
0:05:46.785,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So you nuke me, I nuke you,

108
0:05:50.535,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and we both lose.

109
0:05:52.794,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So in a way, there's a stalemate.

110
0:05:55.498,000 --> 0:05:57,000
No one uses their weapons, and we're all safe.

111
0:05:59.487,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But this theory has real questions.

112
0:06:04.71,000 --> 0:06:06,000
There are experts who challenge this theory

113
0:06:07.535,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and wonder: Does it really work this way in practice?

114
0:06:11.516,000 --> 0:06:15,000
It certainly doesn't allow for mistakes or miscalculations.

115
0:06:17.918,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Now, I don't know about you,

116
0:06:19.992,000 --> 0:06:24,000
but I feel pretty uncomfortable gambling my future survival,

117
0:06:25.134,000 --> 0:06:28,000
yours, and our future generations',

118
0:06:28.683,000 --> 0:06:3,000
on a theory that is questionable

119
0:06:32.275,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and doesn't allow any room for a mistake.

120
0:06:36.56,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It makes me even more uncomfortable

121
0:06:39.386,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to be threatening the evaporation

122
0:06:42.268,000 --> 0:06:44,000
of millions of people on the other side of the Earth.

123
0:06:46.267,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Surely we can do better for ourselves,

124
0:06:49.403,000 --> 0:06:52,000
drawing on our ingenuity to solve complex problems,

125
0:06:52.991,000 --> 0:06:54,000
as we have in the past.

126
0:06:55.032,000 --> 0:06:57,000
After all, this is a man-made,

127
0:06:57.729,000 --> 0:06:58,000
human-made --

128
0:06:58.974,000 --> 0:07:,000
I shouldn't say "man," because women were involved --

129
0:07:01.521,000 --> 0:07:02,000
a human-made problem.

130
0:07:04.669,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We have human solutions that should be possible.

131
0:07:09.238,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So, next question: "Who do you think should make nuclear decisions?"

132
0:07:14.221,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Right now, in this democracy, in the United States,

133
0:07:18.858,000 --> 0:07:19,000
one person

134
0:07:21.588,000 --> 0:07:24,000
gets to decide whether or not to launch a nuclear strike.

135
0:07:26.691,000 --> 0:07:27,000
They don't have to consult anybody.

136
0:07:30.108,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So that's the president.

137
0:07:32.742,000 --> 0:07:34,000
He or she can decide --

138
0:07:35.663,000 --> 0:07:37,000
within a very limited amount of time,

139
0:07:37.822,000 --> 0:07:4,000
under great pressure, potentially, depending on the scenario,

140
0:07:42.204,000 --> 0:07:45,000
maybe based on a miscalculation or a misunderstanding --

141
0:07:46.197,000 --> 0:07:48,000
they can decide the fate of millions of lives:

142
0:07:49.805,000 --> 0:07:51,000
yours, mine, our community's.

143
0:07:54.173,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And they can do this and launch a nuclear strike,

144
0:07:58.327,000 --> 0:08:02,000
potentially setting in motion the annihilation of the human race.

145
0:08:05.566,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Wow.

146
0:08:08.392,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This doesn't have to be our reality, though, and in fact,

147
0:08:11.518,000 --> 0:08:14,000
in a number of other countries that have nuclear weapons, it's not,

148
0:08:14.862,000 --> 0:08:16,000
including countries that are not democracies.

149
0:08:19.595,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We created this system. We can change it.

150
0:08:22.69,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And there's actually a movement underway to do so.

151
0:08:25.991,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So this leads me to my third question:

152
0:08:28.834,000 --> 0:08:31,000
"What do your elected officials know about nuclear weapons,

153
0:08:32.626,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and what types of decisions are they likely to take on your behalf?"

154
0:08:37.416,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Well, Congress has a very important role to play

155
0:08:40.63,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in oversight of and interrogating US nuclear weapons policy.

156
0:08:45.397,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They can decide what to fund, what not to fund,

157
0:08:48.017,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and they represent you.

158
0:08:50.515,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Now unfortunately, since the end of the Cold War,

159
0:08:53.548,000 --> 0:08:56,000
we've seen a real decline in the level of understanding,

160
0:08:57.061,000 --> 0:08:59,000
on Capitol Hill, about these issues.

161
0:08:59.711,000 --> 0:09:03,000
While we are starting to see some terrific new champions emerge,

162
0:09:03.783,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the reality is that the general lack of awareness

163
0:09:06.656,000 --> 0:09:07,000
is highly concerning,

164
0:09:08.252,000 --> 0:09:11,000
given that these people need to make critically important decisions.

165
0:09:14.076,000 --> 0:09:15,000
To make matters worse,

166
0:09:15.251,000 --> 0:09:18,000
the political partisanship that currently grips Washington

167
0:09:19.003,000 --> 0:09:2,000
also affects this issue.

168
0:09:21.814,000 --> 0:09:22,000
This wasn't always the case, though.

169
0:09:23.601,000 --> 0:09:26,000
At the end of the Cold War, members from both sides of the aisle

170
0:09:26.87,000 --> 0:09:3,000
had a really good understanding about the nuclear challenges we were facing

171
0:09:31.021,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and worked together on cooperative programs.

172
0:09:34.847,000 --> 0:09:37,000
They recognized that nuclear risk reduction

173
0:09:38.006,000 --> 0:09:42,000
was far too important to allow it to succumb to political partisanship.

174
0:09:43.35,000 --> 0:09:44,000
They created programs

175
0:09:44.572,000 --> 0:09:47,000
such as the Nunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction Program,

176
0:09:47.919,000 --> 0:09:49,000
which sought to lock down and eliminate

177
0:09:50.462,000 --> 0:09:52,000
vulnerable nuclear material in the former Soviet Union.

178
0:09:54.828,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So we need to return to this era of bipartisanship,

179
0:09:58.812,000 --> 0:10:,000
mutual problem-solving

180
0:10:01.486,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that's based on understanding and awareness about the challenges we face

181
0:10:05.431,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and the real nuclear dangers.

182
0:10:08.273,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And that's where you come in.

183
0:10:10.469,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Public pressure is important.

184
0:10:13.018,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Leaders need a constituent base to act.

185
0:10:16.294,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So create that constituent base,

186
0:10:18.748,000 --> 0:10:2,000
by asking them some simple questions.

187
0:10:22.325,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Ask them, "What do you know about nuclear weapons?"

188
0:10:25.855,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"Do you have a nuclear expert on your staff?

189
0:10:28.522,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Or, if not, do you know somebody you could refer to

190
0:10:31.783,000 --> 0:10:33,000
if you need to make an important decision?"

191
0:10:34.713,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Start to find out what they believe

192
0:10:36.996,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and whether it aligns with your own views and values.

193
0:10:40.45,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Ask them, "How would you choose to spend US national treasure?

194
0:10:46.266,000 --> 0:10:48,000
On a new nuclear arms race

195
0:10:48.393,000 --> 0:10:5,000
or another national security priority,

196
0:10:50.625,000 --> 0:10:53,000
such as cybersecurity or climate change?"

197
0:10:54.032,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Ask them, "Are you willing to put aside partisanship

198
0:10:57.983,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to address this existential threat that affects my survival

199
0:11:02.928,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and your constituents' survival?"

200
0:11:06.305,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Now, people will tell you nuclear policy is far too difficult to understand

201
0:11:10.964,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and complexed and nuanced for the general public to understand,

202
0:11:14.868,000 --> 0:11:15,000
let alone debate.

203
0:11:16.487,000 --> 0:11:18,000
After all, this is "national security."

204
0:11:19.9,000 --> 0:11:2,000
There needs to be secrets.

205
0:11:22.677,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Don't let that put you off.

206
0:11:24.605,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We debate all sorts of issues

207
0:11:26.44,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that are critically important to our lives --

208
0:11:28.725,000 --> 0:11:3,000
why should nuclear weapons be any different?

209
0:11:31.137,000 --> 0:11:34,000
We debate health care, education, the environment.

210
0:11:34.177,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Surely congressional oversight,

211
0:11:37.605,000 --> 0:11:41,000
civic participation that are such hallmarks of US democracy,

212
0:11:41.639,000 --> 0:11:42,000
surely they apply here.

213
0:11:44.573,000 --> 0:11:48,000
After all, these are cases of life and death that we're talking about.

214
0:11:50.021,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And we won't all agree,

215
0:11:52.319,000 --> 0:11:55,000
but whether or not you believe nuclear weapons keep us safe

216
0:11:56.017,000 --> 0:11:59,000
or that nuclear weapons are a liability,

217
0:11:59.231,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I urge you to put aside partisan, ideological issues

218
0:12:04.739,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and listen to each other.

219
0:12:08.254,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So I'll tell you now what I didn't have the guts to tell my friends at the time.

220
0:12:13.483,000 --> 0:12:15,000
No, you're not safe --

221
0:12:16.273,000 --> 0:12:17,000
not just because of North Korea.

222
0:12:18.798,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But there is something you can do about it.

223
0:12:23.266,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Demand that your elected representatives

224
0:12:26.767,000 --> 0:12:29,000
can give you answers to your questions,

225
0:12:29.798,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and answers that you can live with

226
0:12:32.489,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and that billions of others can live with too.

227
0:12:36.644,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And if they can't,

228
0:12:37.949,000 --> 0:12:39,000
stay on them until they can.

229
0:12:41.284,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And if that doesn't work,

230
0:12:43.066,000 --> 0:12:47,000
find others, who are able to represent your views.

231
0:12:48.895,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Because by doing so, we can begin to change the answer to the question

232
0:12:54.362,000 --> 0:12:55,000
"Am I safe?"

233
0:12:57.111,000 --> 0:13:,000
(Applause)

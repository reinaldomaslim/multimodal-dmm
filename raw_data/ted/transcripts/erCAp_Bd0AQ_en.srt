0:00:12.869,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Four years ago,

2
0:00:14.62,000 --> 0:00:15,000
a security researcher,

3
0:00:16.422,000 --> 0:00:2,000
or, as most people would call it, a hacker,

4
0:00:20.671,000 --> 0:00:22,000
found a way to literally

5
0:00:22.838,000 --> 0:00:25,000
make ATMs throw money at him.

6
0:00:26.041,000 --> 0:00:29,000
His name was Barnaby Jack,

7
0:00:29.382,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and this technique was later called "jackpotting"

8
0:00:33.041,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in his honor.

9
0:00:34.95,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'm here today because I think

10
0:00:36.799,000 --> 0:00:39,000
we actually need hackers.

11
0:00:39.85,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Barnaby Jack

12
0:00:41.712,000 --> 0:00:42,000
could have easily turned

13
0:00:43.199,000 --> 0:00:47,000
into a career criminal or James Bond villain

14
0:00:47.397,000 --> 0:00:48,000
with his knowledge,

15
0:00:48.893,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but he chose to show the world

16
0:00:51.381,000 --> 0:00:53,000
his research instead.

17
0:00:54.07,000 --> 0:00:55,000
He believed that sometimes

18
0:00:55.923,000 --> 0:00:57,000
you have to demo a threat

19
0:00:57.963,000 --> 0:00:59,000
to spark a solution.

20
0:01:00.88,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And I feel the same way.

21
0:01:02.81,000 --> 0:01:03,000
That's why I'm here today.

22
0:01:04.66,000 --> 0:01:07,000
We are often terrified and fascinated

23
0:01:07.938,000 --> 0:01:1,000
by the power hackers now have.

24
0:01:11.399,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They scare us.

25
0:01:13.131,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But the choices they make

26
0:01:15.116,000 --> 0:01:17,000
have dramatic outcomes

27
0:01:17.286,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that influence us all.

28
0:01:20.274,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So I am here today because I think we need hackers,

29
0:01:23.609,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and in fact, they just might be

30
0:01:27.192,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the immune system for the information age.

31
0:01:31.532,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Sometimes they make us sick,

32
0:01:33.565,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but they also find those hidden threats

33
0:01:36.92,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in our world,

34
0:01:38.244,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and they make us fix it.

35
0:01:41.089,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I knew that I might get hacked

36
0:01:43.447,000 --> 0:01:45,000
for giving this talk,

37
0:01:45.855,000 --> 0:01:47,000
so let me save you the effort.

38
0:01:48.328,000 --> 0:01:49,000
In true TED fashion,

39
0:01:50.162,000 --> 0:01:53,000
here is my most embarrassing picture.

40
0:01:54.135,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But it would be difficult for you to find me in it,

41
0:01:57.005,000 --> 0:02:,000
because I'm the one who looks like a boy

42
0:02:00.743,000 --> 0:02:01,000
standing to the side.

43
0:02:02.548,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I was such a nerd back then

44
0:02:04.93,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that even the boys on the Dungeons and Dragons team

45
0:02:07.532,000 --> 0:02:09,000
wouldn't let me join.

46
0:02:09.729,000 --> 0:02:1,000
This is who I was,

47
0:02:11.714,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but this is who I wanted to be:

48
0:02:15.829,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Angelina Jolie.

49
0:02:17.727,000 --> 0:02:18,000
She portrayed Acid Burn

50
0:02:19.282,000 --> 0:02:21,000
in the '95 film "Hackers."

51
0:02:21.776,000 --> 0:02:24,000
She was pretty and she could rollerblade,

52
0:02:24.954,000 --> 0:02:28,000
but being a hacker, that made her powerful.

53
0:02:29.063,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And I wanted to be just like her,

54
0:02:31.523,000 --> 0:02:33,000
so I started spending a lot of time

55
0:02:33.889,000 --> 0:02:35,000
on hacker chat rooms and online forums.

56
0:02:36.774,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I remember one late night

57
0:02:39.107,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I found a bit of PHP code.

58
0:02:41.368,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I didn't really know what it did,

59
0:02:42.99,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but I copy-pasted it

60
0:02:44.615,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and used it anyway

61
0:02:46.329,000 --> 0:02:48,000
to get into a password-protected site

62
0:02:48.802,000 --> 0:02:49,000
like that.

63
0:02:50.606,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Open Sesame.

64
0:02:52.009,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It was a simple trick,

65
0:02:53.531,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and I was just a script kiddie back then,

66
0:02:56.536,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but to me, that trick,

67
0:02:57.974,000 --> 0:02:59,000
it felt like this,

68
0:03:00.189,000 --> 0:03:02,000
like I had discovered limitless potential

69
0:03:02.633,000 --> 0:03:03,000
at my fingertips.

70
0:03:04.424,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This is the rush of power that hackers feel.

71
0:03:07.733,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's geeks just like me

72
0:03:10.637,000 --> 0:03:13,000
discovering they have access to superpower,

73
0:03:13.869,000 --> 0:03:15,000
one that requires the skill and tenacity

74
0:03:16.496,000 --> 0:03:17,000
of their intellect,

75
0:03:18.004,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but thankfully no radioactive spiders.

76
0:03:21.565,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But with great power

77
0:03:23.406,000 --> 0:03:25,000
comes great responsibility,

78
0:03:25.71,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and you all like to think that if we had such powers,

79
0:03:29.374,000 --> 0:03:31,000
we would only use them for good.

80
0:03:31.653,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But what if you could read your ex's emails,

81
0:03:35,000 --> 0:03:38,000
or add a couple zeros to your bank account.

82
0:03:38.112,000 --> 0:03:4,000
What would you do then?

83
0:03:40.132,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Indeed, many hackers do not resist

84
0:03:42.369,000 --> 0:03:43,000
those temptations,

85
0:03:44.357,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and so they are responsible in one way or another

86
0:03:47.482,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to billions of dollars lost each year

87
0:03:49.886,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to fraud, malware or plain old identity theft,

88
0:03:53.147,000 --> 0:03:54,000
which is a serious issue.

89
0:03:55.025,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But there are other hackers,

90
0:03:57.01,000 --> 0:03:59,000
hackers who just like to break things,

91
0:03:59.772,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and it is precisely those hackers

92
0:04:02.48,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that can find the weaker elements in our world

93
0:04:05.773,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and make us fix it.

94
0:04:07.45,000 --> 0:04:08,000
This is what happened last year

95
0:04:09.37,000 --> 0:04:11,000
when another security researcher

96
0:04:11.379,000 --> 0:04:12,000
called Kyle Lovett

97
0:04:12.944,000 --> 0:04:13,000
discovered a gaping hole

98
0:04:14.501,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in the design of certain wireless routers

99
0:04:17.461,000 --> 0:04:19,000
like you might have in your home or office.

100
0:04:2,000 --> 0:04:22,000
He learned that anyone could remotely connect

101
0:04:22.645,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to these devices over the Internet

102
0:04:24.967,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and download documents from hard drives

103
0:04:27.728,000 --> 0:04:29,000
attached to those routers,

104
0:04:29.903,000 --> 0:04:3,000
no password needed.

105
0:04:31.75,000 --> 0:04:33,000
He reported it to the company, of course,

106
0:04:34.087,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but they ignored his report.

107
0:04:36.401,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Perhaps they thought universal access

108
0:04:38.265,000 --> 0:04:4,000
was a feature, not a bug,

109
0:04:41.25,000 --> 0:04:42,000
until two months ago

110
0:04:43.105,000 --> 0:04:44,000
when a group of hackers used it

111
0:04:44.538,000 --> 0:04:46,000
to get into people's files.

112
0:04:46.992,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But they didn't steal anything.

113
0:04:49.393,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They left a note:

114
0:04:51.41,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Your router and your documents

115
0:04:53.288,000 --> 0:04:55,000
can be accessed by anyone in the world.

116
0:04:55.447,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Here's what you should do to fix it.

117
0:04:57.715,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We hope we helped.

118
0:05:00.093,000 --> 0:05:02,000
By getting into people's files like that,

119
0:05:02.623,000 --> 0:05:03,000
yeah, they broke the law,

120
0:05:04.083,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but they also forced that company

121
0:05:06.551,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to fix their product.

122
0:05:08.532,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Making vulnerabilities known to the public

123
0:05:10.7,000 --> 0:05:12,000
is a practice called full disclosure

124
0:05:13.445,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in the hacker community,

125
0:05:15.047,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and it is controversial,

126
0:05:17.081,000 --> 0:05:19,000
but it does make me think of how hackers

127
0:05:19.613,000 --> 0:05:21,000
have an evolving effect on technologies we use

128
0:05:22.599,000 --> 0:05:23,000
every day.

129
0:05:24.095,000 --> 0:05:26,000
This is what Khalil did.

130
0:05:26.373,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Khalil is a Palestinian hacker from the West Bank,

131
0:05:28.988,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and he found a serious privacy flaw on Facebook

132
0:05:32.997,000 --> 0:05:33,000
which he attempted to report

133
0:05:34.847,000 --> 0:05:36,000
through the company's bug bounty program.

134
0:05:37.837,000 --> 0:05:39,000
These are usually great arrangements for companies

135
0:05:40.494,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to reward hackers disclosing vulnerabilities

136
0:05:43.671,000 --> 0:05:44,000
they find in their code.

137
0:05:45.36,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Unfortunately, due to some miscommunications,

138
0:05:48.91,000 --> 0:05:51,000
his report was not acknowledged.

139
0:05:51.946,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Frustrated with the exchange,

140
0:05:53.791,000 --> 0:05:56,000
he took to use his own discovery

141
0:05:57.068,000 --> 0:06:,000
to post on Mark Zuckerberg's wall.

142
0:06:00.203,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This got their attention, all right,

143
0:06:02.97,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and they fixed the bug,

144
0:06:06.265,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but because he hadn't reported it properly,

145
0:06:09.12,000 --> 0:06:11,000
he was denied the bounty usually paid out

146
0:06:11.345,000 --> 0:06:13,000
for such discoveries.

147
0:06:13.349,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Thankfully for Khalil,

148
0:06:15.338,000 --> 0:06:17,000
a group of hackers were watching out for him.

149
0:06:18.224,000 --> 0:06:21,000
In fact, they raised more than 13,000 dollars

150
0:06:22.033,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to reward him for this discovery,

151
0:06:24.111,000 --> 0:06:27,000
raising a vital discussion in the technology industry

152
0:06:27.311,000 --> 0:06:3,000
about how we come up with incentives

153
0:06:30.37,000 --> 0:06:32,000
for hackers to do the right thing.

154
0:06:32.96,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But I think there's a greater story here still.

155
0:06:35.98,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Even companies founded by hackers,

156
0:06:38.915,000 --> 0:06:4,000
like Facebook was,

157
0:06:41.302,000 --> 0:06:43,000
still have a complicated relationship

158
0:06:43.885,000 --> 0:06:44,000
when it comes to hackers.

159
0:06:45.689,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And so for more conservative organizations,

160
0:06:48.52,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it is going to take time and adapting

161
0:06:52.038,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in order to embrace hacker culture

162
0:06:54.62,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and the creative chaos that it brings with it.

163
0:06:57.741,000 --> 0:06:59,000
But I think it's worth the effort,

164
0:07:00.183,000 --> 0:07:01,000
because the alternative,

165
0:07:02.163,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to blindly fight all hackers,

166
0:07:05.993,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is to go against the power you cannot control

167
0:07:08.581,000 --> 0:07:11,000
at the cost of stifling innovation

168
0:07:11.882,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and regulating knowledge.

169
0:07:14.076,000 --> 0:07:18,000
These are things that will come back and bite you.

170
0:07:18.37,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It is even more true

171
0:07:19.848,000 --> 0:07:21,000
if we go after hackers

172
0:07:21.927,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that are willing to risk their own freedom

173
0:07:24.964,000 --> 0:07:26,000
for ideals like the freedom of the web,

174
0:07:27.867,000 --> 0:07:31,000
especially in times like this, like today even,

175
0:07:31.93,000 --> 0:07:33,000
as governments and corporates

176
0:07:34.55,000 --> 0:07:37,000
fight to control the Internet.

177
0:07:37.776,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I find it astounding

178
0:07:40.1,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that someone from the shadowy corners of cyberspace

179
0:07:43.113,000 --> 0:07:45,000
can become its voice of opposition,

180
0:07:45.928,000 --> 0:07:47,000
its last line of defense even,

181
0:07:48.57,000 --> 0:07:51,000
perhaps someone like Anonymous,

182
0:07:51.987,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the leading brand of global hacktivism.

183
0:07:55.84,000 --> 0:07:57,000
This universal hacker movement

184
0:07:58.1,000 --> 0:07:59,000
needs no introduction today,

185
0:07:59.706,000 --> 0:08:01,000
but six years ago

186
0:08:01.809,000 --> 0:08:04,000
they were not much more than an Internet subculture

187
0:08:05.238,000 --> 0:08:07,000
dedicated to sharing silly pictures of funny cats

188
0:08:08.157,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and Internet trolling campaigns.

189
0:08:11.587,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Their moment of transformation was in early 2008

190
0:08:16.429,000 --> 0:08:17,000
when the Church of Scientology

191
0:08:18.079,000 --> 0:08:21,000
attempted to remove certain leaked videos

192
0:08:21.146,000 --> 0:08:25,000
from appearing on certain websites.

193
0:08:25.549,000 --> 0:08:27,000
This is when Anonymous was forged

194
0:08:27.989,000 --> 0:08:29,000
out of the seemingly random collection

195
0:08:30.62,000 --> 0:08:31,000
of Internet dwellers.

196
0:08:32.363,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It turns out,

197
0:08:34.817,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the Internet doesn't like it

198
0:08:36.146,000 --> 0:08:38,000
when you try to remove things from it,

199
0:08:38.769,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and it will react with cyberattacks

200
0:08:41.739,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and elaborate pranks

201
0:08:43.84,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and with a series of organized protests

202
0:08:46.489,000 --> 0:08:47,000
all around the world,

203
0:08:47.834,000 --> 0:08:48,000
from my hometown of Tel Aviv

204
0:08:49.822,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to Adelaide, Australia.

205
0:08:52.066,000 --> 0:08:55,000
This proved that Anonymous and this idea

206
0:08:55.196,000 --> 0:08:58,000
can rally the masses from the keyboards

207
0:08:58.279,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to the streets,

208
0:08:59.855,000 --> 0:09:,000
and it laid the foundations

209
0:09:01.802,000 --> 0:09:03,000
for dozens of future operations

210
0:09:04.02,000 --> 0:09:05,000
against perceived injustices

211
0:09:05.96,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to their online and offline world.

212
0:09:09.316,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Since then, they've gone after many targets.

213
0:09:11.341,000 --> 0:09:13,000
They've uncovered corruption, abuse.

214
0:09:14.13,000 --> 0:09:16,000
They've hacked popes and politicians,

215
0:09:16.95,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and I think their effect is larger

216
0:09:18.627,000 --> 0:09:2,000
than simple denial of service attacks

217
0:09:21.424,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that take down websites

218
0:09:22.8,000 --> 0:09:25,000
or even leak sensitive documents.

219
0:09:26.438,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I think that, like Robin Hood,

220
0:09:29.48,000 --> 0:09:32,000
they are in the business of redistribution,

221
0:09:33.38,000 --> 0:09:35,000
but what they are after isn't your money.

222
0:09:36.112,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It's not your documents. It's your attention.

223
0:09:40.842,000 --> 0:09:44,000
They grab the spotlight for causes they support,

224
0:09:45.382,000 --> 0:09:47,000
forcing us to take note,

225
0:09:48.013,000 --> 0:09:5,000
acting as a global magnifying glass

226
0:09:50.478,000 --> 0:09:52,000
for issues that we are not as aware of

227
0:09:52.622,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but perhaps we should be.

228
0:09:54.731,000 --> 0:09:55,000
They have been called many names

229
0:09:56.584,000 --> 0:09:57,000
from criminals to terrorists,

230
0:09:58.355,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and I cannot justify their illegal means,

231
0:10:01.801,000 --> 0:10:03,000
but the ideas they fight for

232
0:10:03.942,000 --> 0:10:07,000
are ones that matter to us all.

233
0:10:07.968,000 --> 0:10:08,000
The reality is,

234
0:10:09.951,000 --> 0:10:11,000
hackers can do a lot more than break things.

235
0:10:12.756,000 --> 0:10:14,000
They can bring people together.

236
0:10:15.229,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And if the Internet doesn't like it

237
0:10:17.552,000 --> 0:10:19,000
when you try to remove things from it,

238
0:10:20.199,000 --> 0:10:2,000
just watch what happens

239
0:10:21.1,000 --> 0:10:23,000
when you try to shut the Internet down.

240
0:10:23.929,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This took place in Egypt in January 2011,

241
0:10:28.521,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and as President Hosni Mubarak

242
0:10:31.737,000 --> 0:10:33,000
attempted a desperate move

243
0:10:33.791,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to quash the rising revolution on the streets of Cairo,

244
0:10:37.633,000 --> 0:10:38,000
he sent his personal troops

245
0:10:39.503,000 --> 0:10:42,000
down to Egypt's Internet service providers

246
0:10:43.146,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and had them physically kill the switch

247
0:10:45.617,000 --> 0:10:49,000
on the country's connection to the world overnight.

248
0:10:49.862,000 --> 0:10:5,000
For a government to do a thing like that

249
0:10:51.477,000 --> 0:10:52,000
was unprecedented,

250
0:10:53.196,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and for hackers, it made it personal.

251
0:10:56.66,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Hackers like the Telecomix group

252
0:10:58.748,000 --> 0:10:59,000
were already active on the ground,

253
0:11:00.621,000 --> 0:11:02,000
helping Egyptians bypass censorship

254
0:11:03.439,000 --> 0:11:05,000
using clever workarounds like Morse code

255
0:11:05.929,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and ham radio.

256
0:11:07.957,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It was high season for low tech,

257
0:11:10.086,000 --> 0:11:12,000
which the government couldn't block,

258
0:11:12.65,000 --> 0:11:15,000
but when the Net went completely down,

259
0:11:15.892,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Telecomix brought in the big guns.

260
0:11:18.83,000 --> 0:11:2,000
They found European service providers

261
0:11:21.001,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that still had 20-year-old

262
0:11:23.31,000 --> 0:11:25,000
analog dial-up access infrastructure.

263
0:11:25.89,000 --> 0:11:28,000
They opened up 300 of those lines

264
0:11:29.292,000 --> 0:11:31,000
for Egyptians to use,

265
0:11:31.766,000 --> 0:11:33,000
serving slow but sweet Internet connection

266
0:11:34.603,000 --> 0:11:35,000
for Egyptians.

267
0:11:36.004,000 --> 0:11:37,000
This worked.

268
0:11:37.299,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It worked so well, in fact,

269
0:11:39.092,000 --> 0:11:41,000
one guy even used it to download an episode

270
0:11:41.372,000 --> 0:11:45,000
of "How I Met Your Mother."

271
0:11:45.71,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But while Egypt's future is still uncertain,

272
0:11:49.631,000 --> 0:11:51,000
when the same thing happened in Syria

273
0:11:52.284,000 --> 0:11:53,000
just one year later,

274
0:11:53.804,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Telecomix were prepared with those Internet lines,

275
0:11:57.539,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and Anonymous,

276
0:11:58.708,000 --> 0:12:,000
they were perhaps the first international group

277
0:12:00.954,000 --> 0:12:01,000
to officially denounce the actions

278
0:12:02.658,000 --> 0:12:03,000
of the Syrian military

279
0:12:04.571,000 --> 0:12:06,000
by defacing their website.

280
0:12:07.375,000 --> 0:12:1,000
But with this sort of power,

281
0:12:10.867,000 --> 0:12:12,000
it really depends on where you stand,

282
0:12:13.213,000 --> 0:12:16,000
because one man's hero

283
0:12:16.722,000 --> 0:12:18,000
can be another's villain,

284
0:12:18.969,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and so the Syrian Electronic Army

285
0:12:21.367,000 --> 0:12:23,000
is a pro-Assad group of hackers

286
0:12:23.838,000 --> 0:12:25,000
who support his contentious regime.

287
0:12:26.503,000 --> 0:12:28,000
They've taken down multiple high-profile targets

288
0:12:29.185,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in the past few years,

289
0:12:30.82,000 --> 0:12:33,000
including the Associated Press's Twitter account,

290
0:12:34.203,000 --> 0:12:37,000
in which they posted a message

291
0:12:37.219,000 --> 0:12:39,000
about an attack on the White House

292
0:12:39.375,000 --> 0:12:42,000
injuring President Obama.

293
0:12:42.638,000 --> 0:12:44,000
This tweet was fake, of course,

294
0:12:44.783,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but the resulting drop in the Dow Jones index

295
0:12:47.722,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that day was most certainly not,

296
0:12:51.099,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and a lot of people lost a lot of money.

297
0:12:54.361,000 --> 0:12:57,000
This sort of thing is happening all over the world right now.

298
0:12:58.267,000 --> 0:13:,000
In conflicts from the Crimean Peninsula

299
0:13:01.214,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to Latin America,

300
0:13:03.576,000 --> 0:13:05,000
from Europe to the United States,

301
0:13:05.88,000 --> 0:13:08,000
hackers are a force for social,

302
0:13:08.937,000 --> 0:13:11,000
political and military influence.

303
0:13:12.703,000 --> 0:13:14,000
As individuals or in groups,

304
0:13:14.954,000 --> 0:13:16,000
volunteers or military conflicts,

305
0:13:17.594,000 --> 0:13:19,000
there are hackers everywhere.

306
0:13:20.235,000 --> 0:13:22,000
They come from all walks of life,

307
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
ethnicities, ideologies and genders, I might add.

308
0:13:27.254,000 --> 0:13:3,000
They are now shaping the world's stage.

309
0:13:31.053,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Hackers represent an exceptional force for change

310
0:13:33.898,000 --> 0:13:35,000
in the 21st century.

311
0:13:36.062,000 --> 0:13:38,000
This is because access to information

312
0:13:38.599,000 --> 0:13:41,000
is a critical currency of power,

313
0:13:41.912,000 --> 0:13:43,000
one which governments would like to control,

314
0:13:44.878,000 --> 0:13:46,000
a thing they attempt to do by setting up

315
0:13:47.339,000 --> 0:13:5,000
all-you-can-eat surveillance programs,

316
0:13:50.999,000 --> 0:13:52,000
a thing they need hackers for, by the way.

317
0:13:53.737,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And so the establishment has long had

318
0:13:56.384,000 --> 0:13:59,000
a love-hate relationship when it comes to hackers,

319
0:14:00.091,000 --> 0:14:02,000
because the same people who demonize hacking

320
0:14:02.849,000 --> 0:14:07,000
also utilize it at large.

321
0:14:07.931,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Two years ago,

322
0:14:09.179,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I saw General Keith Alexander.

323
0:14:11.952,000 --> 0:14:15,000
He's the NSA director and U.S. cyber commander,

324
0:14:16.17,000 --> 0:14:19,000
but instead of his four star general uniform,

325
0:14:19.878,000 --> 0:14:21,000
he was wearing jeans and a t-shirt.

326
0:14:22.174,000 --> 0:14:23,000
This was at DEF CON,

327
0:14:23.918,000 --> 0:14:26,000
the world's largest hacker conference.

328
0:14:27.023,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Perhaps like me, General Alexander

329
0:14:28.95,000 --> 0:14:31,000
didn't see 12,000 criminals that day in Vegas.

330
0:14:32.77,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I think he saw untapped potential.

331
0:14:35.881,000 --> 0:14:38,000
In fact, he was there to give a hiring pitch.

332
0:14:39.254,000 --> 0:14:41,000
"In this room right here," he said,

333
0:14:41.894,000 --> 0:14:43,000
"is the talent our nation needs."

334
0:14:44.284,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Well, hackers in the back row replied,

335
0:14:47.664,000 --> 0:14:49,000
"Then stop arresting us."

336
0:14:49.79,000 --> 0:14:52,000
(Applause)

337
0:14:53.224,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Indeed, for years,

338
0:14:55.803,000 --> 0:14:57,000
hackers have been on the wrong side of the fence,

339
0:14:58.619,000 --> 0:15:,000
but in light of what we know now,

340
0:15:01.527,000 --> 0:15:05,000
who is more watchful of our online world?

341
0:15:05.8,000 --> 0:15:08,000
The rules of the game are not that clear anymore,

342
0:15:08.806,000 --> 0:15:11,000
but hackers are perhaps the only ones

343
0:15:12.218,000 --> 0:15:15,000
still capable of challenging overreaching governments

344
0:15:16.101,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and data-hoarding corporates

345
0:15:18.316,000 --> 0:15:2,000
on their own playing field.

346
0:15:20.794,000 --> 0:15:23,000
To me, that represents hope.

347
0:15:23.914,000 --> 0:15:24,000
For the past three decades,

348
0:15:25.238,000 --> 0:15:26,000
hackers have done a lot of things,

349
0:15:26.789,000 --> 0:15:29,000
but they have also impacted civil liberties,

350
0:15:30.006,000 --> 0:15:32,000
innovation and Internet freedom,

351
0:15:32.376,000 --> 0:15:34,000
so I think it's time we take a good look

352
0:15:35.305,000 --> 0:15:37,000
at how we choose to portray them,

353
0:15:37.435,000 --> 0:15:4,000
because if we keep expecting them to be the bad guys,

354
0:15:41.019,000 --> 0:15:44,000
how can they be the heroes too?

355
0:15:44.489,000 --> 0:15:46,000
My years in the hacker world

356
0:15:46.5,000 --> 0:15:47,000
have made me realize

357
0:15:48.142,000 --> 0:15:53,000
both the problem and the beauty about hackers:

358
0:15:53.875,000 --> 0:15:56,000
They just can't see something broken in the world

359
0:15:57.033,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and leave it be.

360
0:15:58.68,000 --> 0:15:59,000
They are compelled

361
0:16:00.36,000 --> 0:16:03,000
to either exploit it or try and change it,

362
0:16:03.89,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and so they find the vulnerable aspects

363
0:16:07.806,000 --> 0:16:09,000
in our rapidly changing world.

364
0:16:09.94,000 --> 0:16:13,000
They make us, they force us to fix things

365
0:16:14.282,000 --> 0:16:15,000
or demand something better,

366
0:16:16.001,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and I think we need them

367
0:16:17.995,000 --> 0:16:19,000
to do just that,

368
0:16:20.201,000 --> 0:16:23,000
because after all, it is not information

369
0:16:23.47,000 --> 0:16:26,000
that wants to be free, it's us.

370
0:16:26.575,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Thank you very much.

371
0:16:29.937,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Thank you. (Applause)

372
0:16:32.295,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Hack the planet!

We are so honored to be here at TEDWomen,

What an exciting and inspiring event.

10
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
What you just heard is "Skylife" by David Balakrishnan.

11
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We want to play you one more selection.

12
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It's by Astor Piazzolla, an Argentine composer.

13
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And we talk about different ideas --

14
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
he had this idea

15
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that he thought music should be from the heart.

16
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
This was in the middle of the 20th century

17
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
when music from the heart, beautiful music,

18
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
wasn't the most popular thing in the classical music world.

19
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It was more atonal and twelve-tone.

20
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And he insisted on beautiful music.

21
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So this is "Oblivion" by Astor Piazzolla.

22
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Thank you.

23
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000

24
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000

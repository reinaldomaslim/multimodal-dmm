1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:15,000
"Pheromone" is a very powerful word.

2
0:00:16.318,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It conjures up sex, abandon, loss of control,

3
0:00:20.462,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and you can see, it's very important as a word.

4
0:00:24.154,000 --> 0:00:29,000
But it's only 50 years old. It was invented in 1959.

5
0:00:29.437,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Now, if you put that word into the web,

6
0:00:31.986,000 --> 0:00:32,000
as you may have done,

7
0:00:33.496,000 --> 0:00:35,000
you'll come up with millions of hits,

8
0:00:35.888,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and almost all of those sites are trying to sell you

9
0:00:38.533,000 --> 0:00:4,000
something to make you irresistible

10
0:00:40.792,000 --> 0:00:43,000
for 10 dollars or more.

11
0:00:43.865,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Now, this is a very attractive idea,

12
0:00:46.088,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and the molecules they mention

13
0:00:48.53,000 --> 0:00:49,000
sound really science-y.

14
0:00:50.444,000 --> 0:00:51,000
They've got lots of syllables.

15
0:00:52.028,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It's things like androstenol, androstenone

16
0:00:54.901,000 --> 0:00:56,000
or androstadienone.

17
0:00:57.342,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It gets better and better,

18
0:00:58.984,000 --> 0:01:,000
and when you combine that with white lab coats,

19
0:01:01.774,000 --> 0:01:02,000
you must imagine that there is

20
0:01:03.186,000 --> 0:01:05,000
fantastic science behind this.

21
0:01:05.7,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But sadly, these are fraudulent claims

22
0:01:10.822,000 --> 0:01:13,000
supported by dodgy science.

23
0:01:14.161,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The problem is that, although there are many

24
0:01:16.779,000 --> 0:01:18,000
good scientists working on what they think

25
0:01:19.324,000 --> 0:01:2,000
are human pheromones,

26
0:01:21.194,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and they're publishing in respectable journals,

27
0:01:23.799,000 --> 0:01:24,000
at the basis of this,

28
0:01:25.38,000 --> 0:01:28,000
despite very sophisticated experiments,

29
0:01:28.716,000 --> 0:01:3,000
there really is no good science behind it,

30
0:01:31.269,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because it's based on a problem,

31
0:01:34.561,000 --> 0:01:37,000
which is nobody has systematically gone through

32
0:01:38.011,000 --> 0:01:4,000
all the odors that humans produce --

33
0:01:40.112,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and there are thousands of molecules that we give off.

34
0:01:42.89,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We're mammals. We produce a lot of smell.

35
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Nobody has gone through systematically

36
0:01:48.144,000 --> 0:01:5,000
to work out which molecules really are pheromones.

37
0:01:50.911,000 --> 0:01:51,000
They've just plucked a few,

38
0:01:52.541,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and all these experiments are based on those,

39
0:01:54.43,000 --> 0:01:57,000
but there's no good evidence at all.

40
0:01:57.44,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now, that's not to say

41
0:01:59.618,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that smell is not important to people.

42
0:02:01.78,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It is, and some people are real enthusiasts,

43
0:02:05.282,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and one of these was Napoleon.

44
0:02:08.779,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And famously, you may remember

45
0:02:10.571,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that out on the campaign trail for war,

46
0:02:13.668,000 --> 0:02:15,000
he wrote to his lover, Empress Josephine,

47
0:02:16.475,000 --> 0:02:19,000
saying, "Don't wash. I'm coming home."

48
0:02:19.709,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:20.311,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So he didn't want to lose any of her richness

50
0:02:23.232,000 --> 0:02:25,000
in the days before he'd get home,

51
0:02:25.581,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and it is still, you'll find websites

52
0:02:27.958,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that offer this as a major quirk.

53
0:02:31.86,000 --> 0:02:32,000
At the same time, though,

54
0:02:33.024,000 --> 0:02:35,000
we spend about as much money

55
0:02:35.477,000 --> 0:02:36,000
taking the smells off us

56
0:02:37.248,000 --> 0:02:39,000
as putting them back on in perfumes,

57
0:02:39.969,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and perfumes are a multi-billion-dollar business.

58
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So what I want to do in the rest of this talk

59
0:02:46.563,000 --> 0:02:51,000
is tell you about what pheromones really are,

60
0:02:51.841,000 --> 0:02:53,000
tell you why I think we would expect

61
0:02:54.839,000 --> 0:02:56,000
humans to have pheromones,

62
0:02:57.587,000 --> 0:03:01,000
tell you about some of the confusions in pheromones,

63
0:03:02.08,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and then finally, I want to end with

64
0:03:04.872,000 --> 0:03:05,000
a promising avenue which shows us

65
0:03:06.842,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the way we ought to be going.

66
0:03:10.99,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So the ancient Greeks knew

67
0:03:15.171,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that dogs sent invisible signals between each other.

68
0:03:19.225,000 --> 0:03:21,000
A female dog in heat

69
0:03:21.599,000 --> 0:03:22,000
sent an invisible signal to male dogs

70
0:03:23.515,000 --> 0:03:24,000
for miles around,

71
0:03:24.97,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and it wasn't a sound, it was a smell.

72
0:03:27.075,000 --> 0:03:29,000
You could take the smell from the female dog,

73
0:03:29.256,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and the dogs would chase the cloth.

74
0:03:31.719,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But the problem for everybody

75
0:03:33.327,000 --> 0:03:35,000
who could see this effect

76
0:03:35.44,000 --> 0:03:36,000
was that you couldn't identify the molecules.

77
0:03:37.062,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You couldn't demonstrate it was chemical.

78
0:03:39.515,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The reason for that, of course,

79
0:03:40.83,000 --> 0:03:41,000
is that each of these animals

80
0:03:42.245,000 --> 0:03:43,000
produces tiny quantities,

81
0:03:43.851,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and in the case of the dog,

82
0:03:45.51,000 --> 0:03:47,000
males dogs can smell it, but we can't smell it.

83
0:03:48.412,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And it was only in 1959 that a German team,

84
0:03:52.77,000 --> 0:03:55,000
after spending 20 years in search of these molecules,

85
0:03:56.122,000 --> 0:03:59,000
discovered, identified, the first pheromone,

86
0:03:59.903,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and this was the sex pheromone of a silk moth.

87
0:04:03.181,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now, this was an inspired choice by Adolf Butenandt and his team,

88
0:04:06.855,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because he needed half a million moths

89
0:04:08.981,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to get enough material to do the chemical analysis.

90
0:04:12.008,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But he created the model

91
0:04:14.097,000 --> 0:04:16,000
for how you should go about pheromone analysis.

92
0:04:16.461,000 --> 0:04:18,000
He basically went through systematically,

93
0:04:19.142,000 --> 0:04:21,000
showing that only the molecule in question

94
0:04:22.087,000 --> 0:04:23,000
was the one that stimulated the males,

95
0:04:23.953,000 --> 0:04:25,000
not all the others.

96
0:04:26.006,000 --> 0:04:28,000
He analyzed it very carefully.

97
0:04:28.164,000 --> 0:04:29,000
He synthesized the molecule,

98
0:04:29.981,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and then tried the synthesized molecule on the males

99
0:04:33.289,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and got them to respond and showed it was,

100
0:04:36.15,000 --> 0:04:37,000
indeed, that molecule.

101
0:04:37.91,000 --> 0:04:39,000
That's closing the circle.

102
0:04:40.06,000 --> 0:04:42,000
That's the thing which has never been done with humans:

103
0:04:42.765,000 --> 0:04:45,000
nothing systematic, no real demonstration.

104
0:04:46.375,000 --> 0:04:47,000
With that new concept,

105
0:04:48.109,000 --> 0:04:49,000
we needed a new word,

106
0:04:49.818,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and that was the word "pheromone,"

107
0:04:52.653,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and it's basically transferred excitement,

108
0:04:56.254,000 --> 0:04:58,000
transferred between individuals,

109
0:04:58.523,000 --> 0:05:,000
and since 1959, pheromones have been found

110
0:05:01.349,000 --> 0:05:02,000
right the way across the animal kingdom,

111
0:05:03.224,000 --> 0:05:05,000
in male animals, in female animals.

112
0:05:05.426,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It works just as well underwater

113
0:05:06.971,000 --> 0:05:08,000
for goldfish and lobsters.

114
0:05:08.993,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And almost every mammal you can think of

115
0:05:10.74,000 --> 0:05:11,000
has had a pheromone identified,

116
0:05:12.563,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and of course, an enormous number of insects.

117
0:05:16.393,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So we know that pheromones exist

118
0:05:18.362,000 --> 0:05:21,000
right the way across the animal kingdom.

119
0:05:21.423,000 --> 0:05:22,000
What about humans?

120
0:05:23.196,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Well, the first thing, of course,

121
0:05:24.444,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is that we're mammals,

122
0:05:26.101,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and mammals are smelly.

123
0:05:27.66,000 --> 0:05:28,000
As any dog owner can tell you,

124
0:05:29.536,000 --> 0:05:3,000
we smell, they smell.

125
0:05:31.517,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But the real reason we might think

126
0:05:33.498,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that humans have pheromones

127
0:05:35.323,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is the change that occurs as we grow up.

128
0:05:38.541,000 --> 0:05:4,000
The smell of a room of teenagers

129
0:05:40.992,000 --> 0:05:41,000
is quite different

130
0:05:42.481,000 --> 0:05:44,000
from the smell of a room of small children.

131
0:05:45.301,000 --> 0:05:47,000
What's changed? And of course, it's puberty.

132
0:05:48.173,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Along with the pubic hair

133
0:05:49.632,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and the hair in the armpits,

134
0:05:51.325,000 --> 0:05:54,000
new glands start to secrete in those places,

135
0:05:55.067,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and that's what's making the change in smell.

136
0:05:57.682,000 --> 0:05:59,000
If we were any other kind of mammal,

137
0:05:59.83,000 --> 0:06:,000
or any other kind of animal,

138
0:06:01.019,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we would say,

139
0:06:02.156,000 --> 0:06:03,000
"That must be something to do with pheromones,"

140
0:06:04.028,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and we'd start looking properly.

141
0:06:06.684,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But there are some problems, and this is why,

142
0:06:08.66,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I think, people have not looked for

143
0:06:11.729,000 --> 0:06:13,000
pheromones so effectively in humans.

144
0:06:14.646,000 --> 0:06:15,000
There are, indeed, problems.

145
0:06:16.217,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And the first of these

146
0:06:18.401,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is perhaps surprising.

147
0:06:19.918,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It's all about culture.

148
0:06:21.752,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Now moths don't learn a lot

149
0:06:23.899,000 --> 0:06:26,000
about what is good to smell, but humans do,

150
0:06:27.516,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and up to the age of about four,

151
0:06:29.362,000 --> 0:06:31,000
any smell, no matter how rancid,

152
0:06:32.081,000 --> 0:06:33,000
is simply interesting.

153
0:06:33.88,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And I understand that the major role of parents

154
0:06:35.932,000 --> 0:06:38,000
is to stop kids putting their fingers in poo,

155
0:06:39.613,000 --> 0:06:41,000
because it's always something nice to smell.

156
0:06:42.411,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But gradually we learn what's not good,

157
0:06:45.102,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and one of the things we learn

158
0:06:46.592,000 --> 0:06:48,000
at the same time as what is not good

159
0:06:48.727,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is what is good.

160
0:06:50.485,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Now, the cheese behind me

161
0:06:52.747,000 --> 0:06:55,000
is a British, if not an English, delicacy.

162
0:06:56.698,000 --> 0:06:59,000
It's ripe blue Stilton.

163
0:07:00.135,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Liking it is incomprehensible to people from other countries.

164
0:07:04.497,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Every culture has its own special food

165
0:07:07.782,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and national delicacy.

166
0:07:09.878,000 --> 0:07:11,000
If you were to come from Iceland,

167
0:07:11.93,000 --> 0:07:12,000
your national dish

168
0:07:13.254,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is deep rotted shark.

169
0:07:16.23,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Now, all of these things are acquired tastes,

170
0:07:18.36,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but they form almost a badge of identity.

171
0:07:21.52,000 --> 0:07:25,000
You're part of the in-group.

172
0:07:26.34,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The second thing is the sense of smell.

173
0:07:29.922,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Each of us has a unique odor world,

174
0:07:33.391,000 --> 0:07:35,000
in the sense that what we smell,

175
0:07:35.93,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we each smell a completely different world.

176
0:07:38.789,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Now, smell was the hardest

177
0:07:40.498,000 --> 0:07:41,000
of the senses to crack,

178
0:07:42.359,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and the Nobel Prize awarded to

179
0:07:44.074,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Richard Axel and Linda Buck

180
0:07:45.707,000 --> 0:07:47,000
was only awarded in 2004

181
0:07:48.14,000 --> 0:07:5,000
for their discovery of how smell works.

182
0:07:50.93,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It's really hard,

183
0:07:52.307,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but in essence, nerves from the brain

184
0:07:54.898,000 --> 0:07:56,000
go up into the nose

185
0:07:57.111,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and on these nerves exposed in the nose

186
0:07:59.492,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to the outside air are receptors,

187
0:08:02.546,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and odor molecules coming in on a sniff

188
0:08:05.695,000 --> 0:08:07,000
interact with these receptors,

189
0:08:07.845,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and if they bond, they send the nerve a signal

190
0:08:12.104,000 --> 0:08:14,000
which goes back into the brain.

191
0:08:14.412,000 --> 0:08:16,000
We don't just have one kind of receptor.

192
0:08:16.474,000 --> 0:08:17,000
If you're a human, you have about 400

193
0:08:18.35,000 --> 0:08:2,000
different kinds of receptors,

194
0:08:20.415,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and the brain knows what you're smelling

195
0:08:23.382,000 --> 0:08:24,000
because of the combination of receptors

196
0:08:25.193,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and nerve cells that they trigger,

197
0:08:27.706,000 --> 0:08:28,000
sending messages up to the brain

198
0:08:29.264,000 --> 0:08:31,000
in a combinatorial fashion.

199
0:08:32.17,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But it's a bit more complicated,

200
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
because each of those 400

201
0:08:35.295,000 --> 0:08:37,000
comes in various variants,

202
0:08:37.446,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and depending which variant you have,

203
0:08:39.517,000 --> 0:08:43,000
you might smell coriander, or cilantro, that herb,

204
0:08:43.699,000 --> 0:08:45,000
either as something delicious and savory

205
0:08:46.317,000 --> 0:08:48,000
or something like soap.

206
0:08:48.491,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So we each have an individual world of smell,

207
0:08:51.177,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and that complicates anything

208
0:08:52.818,000 --> 0:08:54,000
when we're studying smell.

209
0:08:55.114,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Well, we really ought to talk about armpits,

210
0:08:57.806,000 --> 0:09:,000
and I have to say that I do have particularly good ones.

211
0:09:01.202,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Now, I'm not going to share them with you,

212
0:09:03.204,000 --> 0:09:04,000
but this is the place that most people

213
0:09:05.183,000 --> 0:09:06,000
have looked for pheromones.

214
0:09:06.92,000 --> 0:09:07,000
There is one good reason,

215
0:09:08.423,000 --> 0:09:11,000
which is, the great apes have armpits

216
0:09:11.827,000 --> 0:09:13,000
as their unique characteristic.

217
0:09:14.155,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The other primates have scent glands

218
0:09:16.556,000 --> 0:09:17,000
in other parts of the body.

219
0:09:18.386,000 --> 0:09:2,000
The great apes have these armpits

220
0:09:20.74,000 --> 0:09:22,000
full of secretory glands

221
0:09:22.957,000 --> 0:09:24,000
producing smells all the time,

222
0:09:25.298,000 --> 0:09:28,000
enormous numbers of molecules.

223
0:09:28.998,000 --> 0:09:29,000
When they're secreted from the glands,

224
0:09:30.701,000 --> 0:09:32,000
the molecules are odorless.

225
0:09:32.705,000 --> 0:09:34,000
They have no smell at all,

226
0:09:34.78,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and it's only the wonderful bacteria

227
0:09:36.749,000 --> 0:09:38,000
growing on the rainforest of hair

228
0:09:38.962,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that actually produces the smells

229
0:09:40.418,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that we know and love.

230
0:09:42.439,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And so incidentally, if you want to reduce

231
0:09:44.339,000 --> 0:09:45,000
the amount of smell,

232
0:09:45.769,000 --> 0:09:46,000
clear-cutting your armpits

233
0:09:47.689,000 --> 0:09:49,000
is a very effective way of reducing

234
0:09:49.945,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the habitat for bacteria,

235
0:09:51.459,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and you'll find they remain less smelly

236
0:09:53.796,000 --> 0:09:55,000
for much longer.

237
0:09:55.89,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But although we've focused on armpits,

238
0:09:58.436,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I think it's partly because they're the least

239
0:09:59.803,000 --> 0:10:02,000
embarrassing place to go and ask people for samples.

240
0:10:03.77,000 --> 0:10:05,000
There is actually another reason why we might not

241
0:10:06.382,000 --> 0:10:08,000
be looking for a universal sex pheromone there,

242
0:10:09.158,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and that's because 20 percent of the world's population

243
0:10:12.997,000 --> 0:10:15,000
doesn't have smelly armpits like me.

244
0:10:16.442,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And these are people from China, Japan,

245
0:10:20.358,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Korea, and other parts of northeast Asia.

246
0:10:22.953,000 --> 0:10:25,000
They simply don't secrete those odorless precursors

247
0:10:26.477,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that the bacteria love to use to produce the smells

248
0:10:30.73,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that in an ethnocentric way we always thought of

249
0:10:33.079,000 --> 0:10:35,000
as characteristic of armpits.

250
0:10:35.184,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So it doesn't apply to 20 percent of the world.

251
0:10:39.691,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So what should we be doing

252
0:10:42.693,000 --> 0:10:45,000
in our search for human pheromones?

253
0:10:45.746,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I'm fairly convinced that we do have them.

254
0:10:48.198,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We're mammals, like everybody else

255
0:10:50.151,000 --> 0:10:53,000
who's a mammal, and we probably do have them.

256
0:10:54.13,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But what I think we should do

257
0:10:55.713,000 --> 0:10:56,000
is go right back to the beginning,

258
0:10:57.652,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and basically look all over the body.

259
0:10:59.991,000 --> 0:11:,000
No matter how embarrassing,

260
0:11:01.682,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we need to search and go for the first time

261
0:11:05.06,000 --> 0:11:07,000
where no one else has dared tread.

262
0:11:07.52,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It's going to be difficult,

263
0:11:08.668,000 --> 0:11:1,000
it's going to be embarrassing, but we need to look.

264
0:11:11.243,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We also need to go back to the ideas

265
0:11:14.19,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that Butenandt used when he was studying the silk moth.

266
0:11:17.457,000 --> 0:11:2,000
We need to go back and look systematically

267
0:11:20.925,000 --> 0:11:22,000
at all the molecules that are being produced,

268
0:11:23.063,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and work out which ones are really involved.

269
0:11:25.496,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It isn't good enough simply to pluck a couple

270
0:11:27.602,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and say, "They'll do."

271
0:11:29.546,000 --> 0:11:3,000
We have to actually demonstrate

272
0:11:30.945,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that they really have the effects we claim.

273
0:11:33.755,000 --> 0:11:36,000
There is one team that I'm actually very impressed by.

274
0:11:36.989,000 --> 0:11:39,000
They're in France, and their previous success

275
0:11:40.165,000 --> 0:11:44,000
was identifying the rabbit mammary pheromone.

276
0:11:44.542,000 --> 0:11:46,000
They've turned their attention now

277
0:11:47.111,000 --> 0:11:5,000
to human babies and mothers.

278
0:11:50.296,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So this is a baby having a drink of milk

279
0:11:53.367,000 --> 0:11:55,000
from its mother's breast.

280
0:11:56.01,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Her nipple is completely hidden

281
0:11:58.193,000 --> 0:11:59,000
by the baby's head,

282
0:11:59.439,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but what you'll notice is a white droplet

283
0:12:03.19,000 --> 0:12:04,000
with an arrow pointing to it,

284
0:12:04.971,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and that's the secretion from the areolar glands.

285
0:12:08.17,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Now, we all have them, men and women,

286
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and these are the little bumps around the nipple,

287
0:12:13.978,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and if you're a lactating woman,

288
0:12:15.937,000 --> 0:12:17,000
these start to secrete.

289
0:12:18.274,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It's a very interesting secretion.

290
0:12:20.863,000 --> 0:12:23,000
What Benoist Schaal and his team developed

291
0:12:23.866,000 --> 0:12:25,000
was a simple test to investigate

292
0:12:26.273,000 --> 0:12:28,000
what the effect of this secretion might be,

293
0:12:29.079,000 --> 0:12:31,000
in effect, a simple bioassay.

294
0:12:32.055,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So this is a sleeping baby,

295
0:12:34.73,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and under its nose, we've put a clean glass rod.

296
0:12:39.719,000 --> 0:12:41,000
The baby remains sleeping,

297
0:12:41.83,000 --> 0:12:43,000
showing no interest at all.

298
0:12:44.171,000 --> 0:12:46,000
But if we go to any mother

299
0:12:46.245,000 --> 0:12:48,000
who is secreting from the areolar glands,

300
0:12:48.674,000 --> 0:12:49,000
so it's not about recognition,

301
0:12:50.251,000 --> 0:12:52,000
it can be from any mother,

302
0:12:52.479,000 --> 0:12:53,000
if we take the secretion

303
0:12:53.831,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and now put it under the baby's nose,

304
0:12:56.735,000 --> 0:12:58,000
we get a very different reaction.

305
0:12:58.826,000 --> 0:13:,000
It's a connoisseur's reaction of delight,

306
0:13:01.81,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and it opens its mouth

307
0:13:03.87,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and sticks out its tongue

308
0:13:05.523,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and starts to suck.

309
0:13:07.61,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Now, since this is from any mother,

310
0:13:09.95,000 --> 0:13:1,000
it could really be a pheromone.

311
0:13:11.742,000 --> 0:13:12,000
It's not about individual recognition.

312
0:13:13.521,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Any mother will do.

313
0:13:15.397,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Now, why is this important,

314
0:13:16.86,000 --> 0:13:18,000
apart from being simply very interesting?

315
0:13:19.318,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It's because women vary

316
0:13:21.125,000 --> 0:13:23,000
in the number of areolar glands that they have,

317
0:13:23.898,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and there is a correlation between the ease

318
0:13:26.094,000 --> 0:13:28,000
with which babies start to suckle

319
0:13:28.636,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and the number of areolar glands she has.

320
0:13:30.498,000 --> 0:13:32,000
It appears that the more secretions she's got,

321
0:13:33.296,000 --> 0:13:36,000
the more likely the baby is to suckle quickly.

322
0:13:36.958,000 --> 0:13:37,000
If you're a mammal,

323
0:13:38.418,000 --> 0:13:4,000
the most dangerous time in life

324
0:13:40.961,000 --> 0:13:42,000
is the first few hours after birth.

325
0:13:43.27,000 --> 0:13:46,000
You have to get that first drink of milk,

326
0:13:47.03,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and if you don't get it, you won't survive.

327
0:13:50.521,000 --> 0:13:51,000
You'll be dead.

328
0:13:51.985,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Since many babies actually find it difficult

329
0:13:54.623,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to take that first meal,

330
0:13:56.272,000 --> 0:13:57,000
because they're not getting the right stimulus,

331
0:13:58.249,000 --> 0:14:01,000
if we could identify what that molecule was,

332
0:14:01.459,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and the French team are being very cautious,

333
0:14:03.446,000 --> 0:14:05,000
but if we could identify the molecule,

334
0:14:05.561,000 --> 0:14:07,000
synthesize it, it would then mean

335
0:14:08.355,000 --> 0:14:09,000
premature babies would be more likely to suckle,

336
0:14:10.261,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and every baby would have a better chance

337
0:14:13.189,000 --> 0:14:14,000
of survival.

338
0:14:14.51,000 --> 0:14:16,000
So what I want to argue is this is one example

339
0:14:17.05,000 --> 0:14:2,000
of where a systematic, really scientific approach

340
0:14:20.646,000 --> 0:14:22,000
can actually bring you a real understanding

341
0:14:23.368,000 --> 0:14:24,000
of pheromones.

342
0:14:24.476,000 --> 0:14:26,000
There could be all sorts of medical interventions.

343
0:14:27.09,000 --> 0:14:28,000
There could be all sorts of things

344
0:14:28.344,000 --> 0:14:29,000
that humans are doing with pheromones

345
0:14:30.044,000 --> 0:14:32,000
that we simply don't know at the moment.

346
0:14:32.092,000 --> 0:14:33,000
What we need to remember is pheromones

347
0:14:33.978,000 --> 0:14:34,000
are not just about sex.

348
0:14:35.356,000 --> 0:14:36,000
They're about all sorts of things to do

349
0:14:37.072,000 --> 0:14:38,000
with a mammal's life.

350
0:14:38.795,000 --> 0:14:4,000
So do go forward and do search for more.

351
0:14:41.484,000 --> 0:14:42,000
There's lots to find.

352
0:14:42.524,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Thank you very much.

353
0:14:44.39,000 --> 0:14:48,000

1
0:00:13.063,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The child's symptoms begin

2
0:00:15.295,000 --> 0:00:18,000
with mild fever, headache, muscle pains,

3
0:00:18.956,000 --> 0:00:2,000
followed by vomiting and diarrhea,

4
0:00:21.067,000 --> 0:00:25,000
then bleeding from the mouth, nose and gums.

5
0:00:25.603,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Death follows in the form of organ failure from low blood pressure.

6
0:00:31.887,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Sounds familiar?

7
0:00:33.592,000 --> 0:00:35,000
If you're thinking this is Ebola,

8
0:00:36.215,000 --> 0:00:37,000
actually, in this case, it's not.

9
0:00:38.576,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It's an extreme form of dengue fever, a mosquito-born disease

10
0:00:43.955,000 --> 0:00:47,000
which also does not have an effective therapy or a vaccine,

11
0:00:48.04,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and kills 22,000 people each year.

12
0:00:52.018,000 --> 0:00:54,000
That is actually twice the number of people

13
0:00:54.918,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that have been killed by Ebola

14
0:00:56.971,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in the nearly four decades that we've known about it.

15
0:01:00.74,000 --> 0:01:03,000
As for measles, so much in the news recently,

16
0:01:04.463,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the death toll is actually tenfold higher.

17
0:01:09.578,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Yet for the last year,

18
0:01:11.373,000 --> 0:01:15,000
it has been Ebola that has stolen all of the headlines and the fear.

19
0:01:17.059,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Clearly, there is something deeply rooted about it,

20
0:01:19.88,000 --> 0:01:21,000
something which scares us and fascinates us

21
0:01:22.783,000 --> 0:01:23,000
more than other diseases.

22
0:01:24.896,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But what is it, exactly?

23
0:01:27.357,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Well, it's hard to acquire Ebola,

24
0:01:29.61,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but if you do, the risk of a horrible death is high.

25
0:01:33.697,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Why?

26
0:01:34.873,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Because right now, we don't have any effective therapy or vaccine available.

27
0:01:40.133,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And so, that's the clue.

28
0:01:43.022,000 --> 0:01:44,000
We may have it someday.

29
0:01:45.453,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So we rightfully fear Ebola,

30
0:01:48.804,000 --> 0:01:52,000
because it doesn't kill as many people as other diseases.

31
0:01:53.246,000 --> 0:01:59,000
In fact, it's much less transmissible than viruses such as flu or measles.

32
0:01:59.27,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We fear Ebola because of the fact that it kills us and we can't treat it.

33
0:02:05.112,000 --> 0:02:08,000
We fear the certain inevitability that comes with Ebola.

34
0:02:08.524,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Ebola has this inevitability that seems to defy modern medical science.

35
0:02:14.507,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But wait a second, why is that?

36
0:02:16.705,000 --> 0:02:18,000
We've known about Ebola since 1976.

37
0:02:20.036,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We've known what it's capable of.

38
0:02:22.132,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We've had ample opportunity to study it

39
0:02:24.786,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in the 24 outbreaks that have occurred.

40
0:02:27.491,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And in fact, we've actually had vaccine candidates available now

41
0:02:31.991,000 --> 0:02:32,000
for more than a decade.

42
0:02:33.856,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Why is that those vaccines are just going into clinical trials now?

43
0:02:38.93,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This goes to the fundamental problem we have

44
0:02:41.788,000 --> 0:02:44,000
with vaccine development for infectious diseases.

45
0:02:45.197,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It goes something like this:

46
0:02:47.983,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The people most at risk for these diseases

47
0:02:50.81,000 --> 0:02:54,000
are also the ones least able to pay for vaccines.

48
0:02:55.858,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This leaves little in the way of market incentives

49
0:02:59.281,000 --> 0:03:01,000
for manufacturers to develop vaccines,

50
0:03:02.269,000 --> 0:03:06,000
unless there are large numbers of people who are at risk in wealthy countries.

51
0:03:07.522,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's simply too commercially risky.

52
0:03:11.244,000 --> 0:03:15,000
As for Ebola, there is absolutely no market at all,

53
0:03:15.432,000 --> 0:03:2,000
so the only reason we have two vaccines in late-stage clinical trials now,

54
0:03:21.084,000 --> 0:03:23,000
is actually because of a somewhat misguided fear.

55
0:03:24.52,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Ebola was relatively ignored

56
0:03:27.768,000 --> 0:03:31,000
until September 11 and the anthrax attacks,

57
0:03:32.333,000 --> 0:03:34,000
when all of a sudden, people perceived Ebola

58
0:03:34.891,000 --> 0:03:36,000
as, potentially, a bioterrorism weapon.

59
0:03:37.485,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Why is it that the Ebola vaccine wasn't fully developed at this point?

60
0:03:42.167,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Well, partially, because it was really difficult --

61
0:03:44.787,000 --> 0:03:46,000
or thought to be difficult -- to weaponize the virus,

62
0:03:47.46,000 --> 0:03:52,000
but mainly because of the financial risk in developing it.

63
0:03:53.028,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And this is really the point.

64
0:03:55.718,000 --> 0:03:57,000
The sad reality is, we develop vaccines

65
0:03:58.262,000 --> 0:04:01,000
not based upon the risk the pathogen poses to people,

66
0:04:02.158,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but on how economically risky it is to develop these vaccines.

67
0:04:06.887,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Vaccine development is expensive and complicated.

68
0:04:09.82,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It can cost hundreds of millions of dollars

69
0:04:11.915,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to take even a well-known antigen and turn it into a viable vaccine.

70
0:04:17.001,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Fortunately for diseases like Ebola,

71
0:04:19.479,000 --> 0:04:22,000
there are things we can do to remove some of these barriers.

72
0:04:23.385,000 --> 0:04:26,000
The first is to recognize when there's a complete market failure.

73
0:04:27.314,000 --> 0:04:3,000
In that case, if we want vaccines,

74
0:04:30.372,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we have to provide incentives or some type of subsidy.

75
0:04:36.197,000 --> 0:04:4,000
We also need to do a better job at being able to figure out

76
0:04:40.561,000 --> 0:04:42,000
which are the diseases that most threaten us.

77
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
By creating capabilities within countries, we then create the ability

78
0:04:48.199,000 --> 0:04:52,000
for those countries to create epidemiological and laboratory networks

79
0:04:52.84,000 --> 0:04:56,000
which are capable of collecting and categorizing these pathogens.

80
0:04:58.117,000 --> 0:05:,000
The data from that then can be used

81
0:05:00.403,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to understand the geographic and genetic diversity,

82
0:05:03.706,000 --> 0:05:05,000
which then can be used to help us understand

83
0:05:06.366,000 --> 0:05:09,000
how these are being changed immunologically,

84
0:05:10.033,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and what type of reactions they promote.

85
0:05:13.198,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So these are the things that can be done,

86
0:05:15.549,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but to do this, if we want to deal with a complete market failure,

87
0:05:19.257,000 --> 0:05:24,000
we have to change the way we view and prevent infectious diseases.

88
0:05:24.705,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We have to stop waiting until we see evidence

89
0:05:28.916,000 --> 0:05:32,000
of a disease becoming a global threat before we consider it as one.

90
0:05:34.617,000 --> 0:05:36,000
So, for Ebola,

91
0:05:36.88,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the paranoid fear of an infectious disease,

92
0:05:40.795,000 --> 0:05:44,000
followed by a few cases transported to wealthy countries,

93
0:05:45.541,000 --> 0:05:47,000
led the global community to come together,

94
0:05:48.165,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and with the work of dedicated vaccine companies,

95
0:05:51.694,000 --> 0:05:52,000
we now have these:

96
0:05:54.465,000 --> 0:06:,000
Two Ebola vaccines in efficacy trials in the Ebola countries --

97
0:06:00.496,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Applause)

98
0:06:06.025,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and a pipeline of vaccines that are following behind.

99
0:06:10.763,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Every year, we spend billions of dollars,

100
0:06:13.879,000 --> 0:06:18,000
keeping a fleet of nuclear submarines permanently patrolling the oceans

101
0:06:18.976,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to protect us from a threat that almost certainly will never happen.

102
0:06:23.527,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And yet, we spend virtually nothing

103
0:06:26.487,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to prevent something as tangible and evolutionarily certain

104
0:06:31.538,000 --> 0:06:33,000
as epidemic infectious diseases.

105
0:06:35.009,000 --> 0:06:38,000
And make no mistake about it -- it's not a question of "if," but "when."

106
0:06:38.928,000 --> 0:06:4,000
These bugs are going to continue to evolve

107
0:06:41.864,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and they're going to threaten the world.

108
0:06:44.28,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And vaccines are our best defense.

109
0:06:47.108,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So if we want to be able to prevent epidemics like Ebola,

110
0:06:51.441,000 --> 0:06:55,000
we need to take on the risk of investing in vaccine development

111
0:06:55.911,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and in stockpile creation.

112
0:06:58.76,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And we need to view this, then, as the ultimate deterrent --

113
0:07:02.409,000 --> 0:07:05,000
something we make sure is available,

114
0:07:05.553,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but at the same time, praying we never have to use it.

115
0:07:09.621,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Thank you.

116
0:07:10.796,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Applause)

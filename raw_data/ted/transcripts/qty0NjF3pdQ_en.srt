1
0:00:12.681,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Caitlin Quattromani: The election of 2016 felt different.

2
0:00:16.398,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Political conversations with our family and friends

3
0:00:19.445,000 --> 0:00:2,000
uncovered a level of polarization

4
0:00:21.255,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that many of us had not previously experienced.

5
0:00:24.49,000 --> 0:00:27,000
People who we always thought were reasonable and intelligent

6
0:00:28.037,000 --> 0:00:29,000
seemed like strangers.

7
0:00:29.646,000 --> 0:00:31,000
We said to ourselves, "How could you think that?

8
0:00:32.329,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I thought you were smart."

9
0:00:34.225,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Lauran Arledge: Caitlin and I met in the summer of 2011,

10
0:00:37.642,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and we bonded around being working moms

11
0:00:39.556,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and trying to keep our very energetic boys busy.

12
0:00:42.646,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And we soon found out we had almost everything in common.

13
0:00:46.138,000 --> 0:00:49,000
From our love of Colorado to our love of sushi,

14
0:00:49.655,000 --> 0:00:51,000
there wasn't much we didn't agree on.

15
0:00:52.481,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We also discovered that we share a deep love of this country

16
0:00:55.498,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and feel a responsibility to be politically active.

17
0:00:59.076,000 --> 0:01:,000
But no one's perfect --

18
0:01:00.751,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:01.823,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I soon found out two disappointing things about Caitlin.

20
0:01:05.85,000 --> 0:01:07,000
First, she hates camping.

21
0:01:08.497,000 --> 0:01:1,000
CQ: I think camping is the worst.

22
0:01:10.569,000 --> 0:01:13,000
LA: So there would not be any joint camping trips in our future.

23
0:01:14.901,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The second thing is that she's politically active all right --

24
0:01:18.585,000 --> 0:01:19,000
as a conservative.

25
0:01:20.41,000 --> 0:01:23,000
CQ: I may hate camping, but I love politics.

26
0:01:23.736,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I listen to conservative talk radio just about every day,

27
0:01:26.965,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and I've volunteered for a few different conservative political campaigns.

28
0:01:31.131,000 --> 0:01:33,000
LA: And I'd say I'm a little to the left,

29
0:01:33.457,000 --> 0:01:34,000
like all the way to the left.

30
0:01:34.895,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:36.498,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I've always been interested in politics.

32
0:01:38.618,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I was a political science major,

33
0:01:40.22,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and I worked as a community organizer and on a congressional campaign.

34
0:01:43.998,000 --> 0:01:45,000
CQ: So as Lauran and I were getting to know each other,

35
0:01:46.672,000 --> 0:01:48,000
it was right in the middle of that 2012 presidential campaign,

36
0:01:49.619,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and most of our early political conversations

37
0:01:52.136,000 --> 0:01:54,000
were really just based in jokes and pranks.

38
0:01:55.064,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So as an example, I would change Lauran's computer screen saver

39
0:01:58.12,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to a picture of Mitt Romney,

40
0:01:59.573,000 --> 0:02:02,000
or she would put an Obama campaign magnet on the back of my car.

41
0:02:02.994,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:04.029,000 --> 0:02:06,000
LA: Car, not minivan.

43
0:02:06.093,000 --> 0:02:09,000
CQ: But over time, those conversations grew more serious

44
0:02:09.125,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and really became a core of our friendship.

45
0:02:11.808,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And somewhere along the line,

46
0:02:13.25,000 --> 0:02:16,000
we decided we didn't want to have any topic be off limits for discussion,

47
0:02:17.253,000 --> 0:02:21,000
even if those topics pushed us way outside of our friendship comfort zone.

48
0:02:21.731,000 --> 0:02:22,000
LA: And so to most of us,

49
0:02:22.959,000 --> 0:02:24,000
political conversations are a zero-sum game.

50
0:02:25.579,000 --> 0:02:26,000
There's a winner and there's a loser.

51
0:02:27.58,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We go for the attack and we spot a weakness in someone's argument.

52
0:02:30.857,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And here's the important part:

53
0:02:32.364,000 --> 0:02:35,000
we tend to take every comment or opinion that's expressed

54
0:02:35.484,000 --> 0:02:38,000
as a personal affront to our own values and beliefs.

55
0:02:39.337,000 --> 0:02:42,000
But what if changed the way we think about these conversations?

56
0:02:43.035,000 --> 0:02:45,000
What if, in these heated moments,

57
0:02:45.321,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we chose dialogue over debate?

58
0:02:48.606,000 --> 0:02:5,000
When we engage in dialogue, we flip the script.

59
0:02:52.118,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We replace our ego and our desire to win

60
0:02:54.919,000 --> 0:02:56,000
with curiosity, empathy

61
0:02:57.022,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and a desire to learn.

62
0:02:58.531,000 --> 0:03:,000
Instead of coming from a place of judgment,

63
0:03:00.621,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we are genuinely interested in the other person's experiences,

64
0:03:04.517,000 --> 0:03:06,000
their values and their concerns.

65
0:03:07.04,000 --> 0:03:09,000
CQ: You make it sound so simple, Lauran.

66
0:03:09.601,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But getting to that place of true dialogue is hard,

67
0:03:12.446,000 --> 0:03:14,000
especially when we're talking about politics.

68
0:03:14.881,000 --> 0:03:16,000
It is so easy to get emotionally fired up

69
0:03:17.52,000 --> 0:03:19,000
about issues that we're passionate about,

70
0:03:19.66,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and we can let our ego get in the way of truly hearing

71
0:03:22.619,000 --> 0:03:23,000
the other person's perspective.

72
0:03:24.376,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And in this crazy political climate we're in right now,

73
0:03:26.973,000 --> 0:03:28,000
unfortunately, we're seeing an extreme result

74
0:03:29.789,000 --> 0:03:31,000
of those heated political conversations,

75
0:03:32.159,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to the point where people are willing to walk away from their relationships.

76
0:03:36.152,000 --> 0:03:38,000
In fact, Rasmussen released a poll earlier this year

77
0:03:39.145,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that said 40 percent of people reported that the 2016 election

78
0:03:43.883,000 --> 0:03:46,000
negatively impacted a personal relationship,

79
0:03:46.931,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience tells us

80
0:03:49.391,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that people tend to feel their way to their beliefs

81
0:03:52.344,000 --> 0:03:53,000
rather than using reasoning,

82
0:03:54.081,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and that when reason and emotion collide,

83
0:03:57.162,000 --> 0:03:59,000
it's emotion that invariably wins.

84
0:03:59.606,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So no wonder it's hard to talk about these issues.

85
0:04:02.209,000 --> 0:04:04,000
LA: And look, we're just two regular friends

86
0:04:04.282,000 --> 0:04:06,000
who happen to think very differently

87
0:04:06.616,000 --> 0:04:09,000
about politics and the role that government should play in our lives.

88
0:04:10.235,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And I know we were all taught not to talk about politics

89
0:04:12.895,000 --> 0:04:13,000
because it's not polite,

90
0:04:14.363,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but we need to be able to talk about it,

91
0:04:16.3,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because it's important to us and it's a part of who we are.

92
0:04:19.479,000 --> 0:04:21,000
CQ: We have chosen to avoid political debate

93
0:04:22.265,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and instead engage in dialogue

94
0:04:24.512,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in order to maintain what we fondly call

95
0:04:27.077,000 --> 0:04:28,000
our bipartisan friendship.

96
0:04:28.878,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:30.632,000 --> 0:04:33,000
LA: And this election and all of the craziness that has followed

98
0:04:33.664,000 --> 0:04:36,000
has given us several opportunities to practice this skill.

99
0:04:36.717,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:38.583,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Let's start with January and the Women's March.

101
0:04:40.799,000 --> 0:04:43,000
At this point, you can probably guess which one of us participated.

102
0:04:44.25,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

103
0:04:45.617,000 --> 0:04:46,000
CQ: Oh, the Women's March.

104
0:04:47.61,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I was annoyed and irritated that entire day,

105
0:04:50.436,000 --> 0:04:51,000
really because of two things.

106
0:04:52.251,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Number one, the name "Women's March."

107
0:04:55.14,000 --> 0:04:56,000
As a conservative woman,

108
0:04:56.4,000 --> 0:04:58,000
the march's platform of issues didn't represent me,

109
0:04:59.416,000 --> 0:05:,000
and that's OK,

110
0:05:00.614,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but hearing it talked about as this demonstration of sisterhood

111
0:05:03.909,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and solidarity for all women

112
0:05:05.6,000 --> 0:05:06,000
didn't ring true for me.

113
0:05:07.283,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The other piece was the timing of the event,

114
0:05:09.356,000 --> 0:05:12,000
the fact that it was the day after the presidential inauguration.

115
0:05:12.688,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It felt like we weren't even giving the new administration

116
0:05:15.428,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to actually do anything, good or bad,

117
0:05:17.605,000 --> 0:05:19,000
before people felt the need to demonstrate against it.

118
0:05:20.706,000 --> 0:05:22,000
LA: And under normal circumstances, I would agree with Caitlin.

119
0:05:23.684,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I think an administration does deserve the benefit of the doubt.

120
0:05:26.709,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But in this case, I was marching to show my concern

121
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that a man with such a poor track record with women and other groups

122
0:05:33.493,000 --> 0:05:34,000
had been elected as president.

123
0:05:35.645,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I had to be part of the collective voice

124
0:05:37.637,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that wanted to send a clear message to the new president

125
0:05:40.603,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that we did not accept or condone

126
0:05:42.891,000 --> 0:05:44,000
his behavior or rhetoric during the election.

127
0:05:45.885,000 --> 0:05:47,000
CQ: So I'm already feeling kind of aggravated,

128
0:05:48.467,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and then I see this Facebook from Lauran pop up in my social media feed.

129
0:05:52.904,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:53.935,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Seeing Lauran's sons at the march and holding signs

131
0:05:57.276,000 --> 0:06:,000
took it to a new level for me, and not in a good way,

132
0:06:00.594,000 --> 0:06:01,000
because I know these boys,

133
0:06:02.214,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I love these boys,

134
0:06:03.674,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and I didn't feel they were old enough

135
0:06:05.58,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to understand what the march stood for.

136
0:06:07.516,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I didn't understand why Lauran would choose

137
0:06:09.587,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to have them participate in that way,

138
0:06:11.404,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and I assumed it wasn't a choice that the boys made for themselves.

139
0:06:14.752,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But I also know Lauran.

140
0:06:17.154,000 --> 0:06:18,000
You're an incredible mom

141
0:06:18.393,000 --> 0:06:2,000
who would never exploit your boys in any way,

142
0:06:20.952,000 --> 0:06:21,000
so I had to stop and check myself.

143
0:06:22.723,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I had a decision to make.

144
0:06:24.411,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I could take the easy way out

145
0:06:26.039,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and just choose not to say anything to her,

146
0:06:28.813,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and instead just kind of simmer in my frustration,

147
0:06:31.854,000 --> 0:06:34,000
or I could ask her to learn more about her motivations.

148
0:06:35.085,000 --> 0:06:36,000
LA: And I shared with Caitlin

149
0:06:36.491,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that we actually started talking about the March

150
0:06:38.824,000 --> 0:06:39,000
weeks before we participated.

151
0:06:40.494,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And my boys were curious as to why the event was being organized,

152
0:06:43.722,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and this led to some very interesting family conversations.

153
0:06:47.403,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We talked about how in this country, we have the right and the privilege

154
0:06:50.951,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to demonstrate against something we don't agree with,

155
0:06:53.697,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and my husband shared with them why he thought it was so important

156
0:06:56.833,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that men joined the Women's March.

157
0:06:58.807,000 --> 0:07:,000
But the most significant reason we marched as a family

158
0:07:01.712,000 --> 0:07:04,000
is that it was a way for us to honor my parents' legacy.

159
0:07:05.187,000 --> 0:07:06,000
They spent their careers

160
0:07:06.684,000 --> 0:07:09,000
working to defend the rights of some of our most vulnerable citizens,

161
0:07:10.592,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and they passed these values down to me and my brother,

162
0:07:13.189,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and we want to do the same with our sons.

163
0:07:15.367,000 --> 0:07:16,000
CQ: After talking to Lauran,

164
0:07:16.73,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I really understood not only why she felt it was so important to march,

165
0:07:20.611,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but why she had her boys with her.

166
0:07:22.524,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And frankly, my assumptions were wrong.

167
0:07:24.795,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It was the boys who wanted to march

168
0:07:26.524,000 --> 0:07:28,000
after they talked about the issues as a family.

169
0:07:29.163,000 --> 0:07:31,000
But what's most important about this example

170
0:07:31.295,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is to think about the alternative.

171
0:07:33.12,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Had Lauran and I not talked about it,

172
0:07:34.963,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I would have been annoyed with her,

173
0:07:36.655,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and it could have resulted in an undercurrent of disrespect

174
0:07:39.456,000 --> 0:07:4,000
in our friendship.

175
0:07:40.646,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But by asking Lauran questions, it allowed us to use dialogue

176
0:07:43.824,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to get to a place of true understanding.

177
0:07:46.203,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now, to be clear,

178
0:07:47.796,000 --> 0:07:5,000
our conversation didn't really change my mind about how I felt about the March,

179
0:07:51.685,000 --> 0:07:55,000
but it absolutely changed my thinking around why she brought her boys with her.

180
0:07:55.849,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And for both of us, that dialogue allowed us to understand

181
0:07:58.858,000 --> 0:08:,000
each other's perspective about the Women's March

182
0:08:01.151,000 --> 0:08:02,000
even though we disagreed.

183
0:08:03.135,000 --> 0:08:06,000
LA: The second topic that challenged our ability to engage in dialogue

184
0:08:06.774,000 --> 0:08:08,000
was around my need to understand

185
0:08:08.811,000 --> 0:08:09,000
how Caitlin could vote for Trump.

186
0:08:11.318,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Laughter)

187
0:08:17.303,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Caitlin is a successful professional woman

188
0:08:20.752,000 --> 0:08:22,000
who is deeply caring and compassionate,

189
0:08:23.383,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and the Caitlin I know

190
0:08:24.788,000 --> 0:08:27,000
would never excuse any man from talking about women

191
0:08:27.971,000 --> 0:08:29,000
the way that Trump did during the campaign.

192
0:08:30.571,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It was hard for me to reconcile these two things in my mind.

193
0:08:33.654,000 --> 0:08:35,000
How could you overlook the things that were said?

194
0:08:36.757,000 --> 0:08:38,000
CQ: So I'm guessing I may not be the only one here that thought

195
0:08:39.735,000 --> 0:08:42,000
we didn't have the best choices for the presidential election last year.

196
0:08:43.141,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Laughter)

197
0:08:44.584,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The Republican candidate who I did support didn't make it out of the primary,

198
0:08:48.504,000 --> 0:08:5,000
so when it came time to vote, I had a decision to make.

199
0:08:51.604,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And you're right, there were some terrible things

200
0:08:53.915,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that came out during the Trump campaign,

201
0:08:56.052,000 --> 0:08:58,000
so much so that I almost decided to just abstain

202
0:08:58.599,000 --> 0:08:59,000
rather than voting for president,

203
0:09:00.208,000 --> 0:09:02,000
something I had never even considered doing before.

204
0:09:02.986,000 --> 0:09:04,000
But ultimately, I did vote for Donald Trump,

205
0:09:05.209,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and for me it was really a vote for party over person,

206
0:09:08.754,000 --> 0:09:11,000
especially recognizing how important that presidential pick is

207
0:09:12.5,000 --> 0:09:14,000
on influencing our judicial branch.

208
0:09:15.148,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But I shared with Lauran it was a decision I really wrestled with,

209
0:09:18.347,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and not one that I made lightly.

210
0:09:20.676,000 --> 0:09:23,000
LA: And so after our conversation, I was struck by a few things.

211
0:09:24.107,000 --> 0:09:27,000
First, I had fallen victim to my own confirmation bias.

212
0:09:27.846,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Because of my strong feelings about Trump,

213
0:09:30.218,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I had given all Trump voters the same attributes,

214
0:09:32.91,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and none of them forgiving.

215
0:09:34.498,000 --> 0:09:35,000
(Laughter)

216
0:09:35.672,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But knowing Caitlin, I started to ask questions.

217
0:09:39.846,000 --> 0:09:41,000
What were Trump voters really concerned about?

218
0:09:42.36,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Under all the divisive language, what was really going on?

219
0:09:46.003,000 --> 0:09:48,000
What could we learn about ourselves and our country

220
0:09:48.732,000 --> 0:09:49,000
from this unlikely event?

221
0:09:51.156,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I also learned that we shared a deep disappointment in this election,

222
0:09:55.538,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and that we have growing concerns about our two-party political system.

223
0:09:59.635,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But the most important thing about this conversation

224
0:10:02.274,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is that it happened at all.

225
0:10:04.894,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Without an open and honest dialogue between the two of us,

226
0:10:08.306,000 --> 0:10:1,000
this election would have been the elephant in the room

227
0:10:10.982,000 --> 0:10:12,000
for the next four years, pun intended.

228
0:10:13.671,000 --> 0:10:17,000
(Laughter)

229
0:10:18.115,000 --> 0:10:19,000
CQ: So, look --

230
0:10:19.29,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Applause)

231
0:10:21.576,000 --> 0:10:24,000
So, look -- we know it takes work to get past the difficult,

232
0:10:24.989,000 --> 0:10:26,000
frustrating and sometimes emotional parts

233
0:10:27.378,000 --> 0:10:29,000
of having discussions about issues like the Women's March

234
0:10:30.363,000 --> 0:10:34,000
or why your friend may have voted for a candidate that you can't stand.

235
0:10:35.072,000 --> 0:10:37,000
But we need to have these conversations.

236
0:10:37.311,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Our ability to move past political debate

237
0:10:39.882,000 --> 0:10:4,000
into true dialogue

238
0:10:41.382,000 --> 0:10:44,000
is a critical skill we should all be focused on right now,

239
0:10:44.408,000 --> 0:10:46,000
especially with the people that we care about the most.

240
0:10:47.724,000 --> 0:10:5,000
LA: And it's not just as adults that we need to bottle this behavior.

241
0:10:51.011,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It's critical that we do it for our children as well.

242
0:10:54.023,000 --> 0:10:56,000
My sons were inundated with this election.

243
0:10:56.717,000 --> 0:10:58,000
We were listening to the news in the morning,

244
0:10:58.885,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and they were having conversations with their friends at school.

245
0:11:02.38,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I was concerned that they were picking up so much polarizing misinformation,

246
0:11:06.524,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and they were growing really fearful of a Trump presidency.

247
0:11:10.554,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Then one day, after the election, I was taking my sons to school,

248
0:11:15.079,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and my younger son, completely out of the blue,

249
0:11:17.572,000 --> 0:11:21,000
said, "Mom, we don't know anybody who voted for Trump, right?"

250
0:11:22.5,000 --> 0:11:24,000
(Laughter)

251
0:11:25.493,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And I paused and I took a deep breath.

252
0:11:30.063,000 --> 0:11:31,000
"Yes, we do."

253
0:11:31.269,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Laughter)

254
0:11:32.293,000 --> 0:11:33,000
"The Quattromanis."

255
0:11:33.764,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And his response was so great.

256
0:11:35.857,000 --> 0:11:38,000
He kind of got this confused look on his face, and he said ...

257
0:11:39.539,000 --> 0:11:4,000
"But we love them."

258
0:11:40.714,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Laughter)

259
0:11:43.706,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And I answered, "Yes, we do."

260
0:11:45.523,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Laughter)

261
0:11:46.601,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And then he said, "Why would they vote for him?"

262
0:11:50.232,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And I remember stopping and thinking

263
0:11:51.972,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that it was really important how I answered this question.

264
0:11:55.409,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Somehow, I had to honor our own family values

265
0:11:58.195,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and show respect for our friends.

266
0:12:00.697,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So I finally said,

267
0:12:02.293,000 --> 0:12:04,000
"They think that's the right direction for this country."

268
0:12:04.985,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And before I had even gotten the whole sentence out,

269
0:12:07.803,000 --> 0:12:1,000
he had moved on to the soccer game he was going to play at recess.

270
0:12:10.97,000 --> 0:12:11,000
CQ: So life with boys.

271
0:12:12.166,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Laughter)

272
0:12:13.223,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So what Lauran and I have discovered through our bipartisan friendship

273
0:12:16.607,000 --> 0:12:18,000
is the possibility that lives in dialogue.

274
0:12:19.611,000 --> 0:12:21,000
We have chosen to be genuinely curious

275
0:12:21.977,000 --> 0:12:23,000
about each other's ideas and perspectives

276
0:12:24.679,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and to be willing to listen to one another even when we disagree.

277
0:12:28.523,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And by putting aside our ego and our preconceived ideas,

278
0:12:31.672,000 --> 0:12:33,000
we've opened ourselves up to limitless learning.

279
0:12:34.602,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And perhaps most importantly for our relationship,

280
0:12:37.428,000 --> 0:12:39,000
we have made the commitment to each other

281
0:12:39.484,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that our friendship is way more important

282
0:12:42.373,000 --> 0:12:46,000
than either of us being right or winning a conversation about politics.

283
0:12:47.02,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So today, we're asking you to have a conversation.

284
0:12:50.225,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Talk to someone outside of your political party

285
0:12:52.516,000 --> 0:12:53,000
who might challenge your thinking.

286
0:12:54.161,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Make an effort to engage with someone

287
0:12:56.01,000 --> 0:12:58,000
with whom you might typically avoid a political conversation.

288
0:12:59.003,000 --> 0:13:01,000
But remember, the goal isn't to win,

289
0:13:01.892,000 --> 0:13:03,000
the goal is to listen and to understand

290
0:13:04.554,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and to be open to learning something new.

291
0:13:07.587,000 --> 0:13:08,000
LA: So let's go back to election night.

292
0:13:09.884,000 --> 0:13:1,000
As the polls were closing

293
0:13:11.171,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and it became clear that Trump was going to be our new president,

294
0:13:14.504,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I was devastated.

295
0:13:16.485,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I was sad, I was confused,

296
0:13:19.14,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and I'll be honest -- I was angry.

297
0:13:21.873,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And then just before midnight,

298
0:13:23.58,000 --> 0:13:25,000
I received this text message from Caitlin.

299
0:13:25.961,000 --> 0:13:28,000
[I know this is a hard night for you guys.

300
0:13:29.357,000 --> 0:13:32,000
We are thinking of you. Love you.]

301
0:13:32.485,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And where there so easy could have been weeks or months of awkwardness

302
0:13:36.319,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and unspoken hostility, there was this --

303
0:13:40.002,000 --> 0:13:42,000
an offering of empathy rooted in friendship.

304
0:13:43.554,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And I knew, in that moment, that we would make it through this.

305
0:13:47.512,000 --> 0:13:5,000
CQ: So we must find a way to engage in meaningful conversations

306
0:13:51.152,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that are going to move us forward as a nation,

307
0:13:53.528,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and we can no longer wait

308
0:13:54.973,000 --> 0:13:57,000
for our elected officials to elevate our national discourse.

309
0:13:58.889,000 --> 0:14:01,000
LA: The challenges ahead are going to require all of us

310
0:14:02.131,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to participate in a deeper and more meaningful way ...

311
0:14:05.77,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and it starts with each one of us

312
0:14:08.072,000 --> 0:14:1,000

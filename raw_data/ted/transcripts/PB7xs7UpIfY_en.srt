1
0:00:12.378,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I have a question:

2
0:00:14.271,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Who here remembers when they first realized

3
0:00:17.648,000 --> 0:00:2,000
they were going to die?

4
0:00:21.071,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I do. I was a young boy,

5
0:00:23.573,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and my grandfather had just died,

6
0:00:26.628,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and I remember a few days later lying in bed at night

7
0:00:30.546,000 --> 0:00:33,000
trying to make sense of what had happened.

8
0:00:34.18,000 --> 0:00:36,000
What did it mean that he was dead?

9
0:00:36.815,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Where had he gone?

10
0:00:38.599,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It was like a hole in reality had opened up

11
0:00:42.021,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and swallowed him.

12
0:00:44.156,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But then the really shocking question occurred to me:

13
0:00:46.958,000 --> 0:00:49,000
If he could die, could it happen to me too?

14
0:00:50.448,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Could that hole in reality open up and swallow me?

15
0:00:53.747,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Would it open up beneath my bed

16
0:00:55.537,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and swallow me as I slept?

17
0:00:58.771,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Well, at some point, all children become aware of death.

18
0:01:02.959,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It can happen in different ways, of course,

19
0:01:04.864,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and usually comes in stages.

20
0:01:06.697,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Our idea of death develops as we grow older.

21
0:01:10.21,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And if you reach back into the dark corners

22
0:01:12.939,000 --> 0:01:13,000
of your memory,

23
0:01:14.636,000 --> 0:01:17,000
you might remember something like what I felt

24
0:01:17.639,000 --> 0:01:2,000
when my grandfather died and when I realized

25
0:01:20.894,000 --> 0:01:21,000
it could happen to me too,

26
0:01:22.844,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that sense that behind all of this

27
0:01:25.423,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the void is waiting.

28
0:01:28.76,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And this development in childhood

29
0:01:31.037,000 --> 0:01:33,000
reflects the development of our species.

30
0:01:33.858,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Just as there was a point in your development

31
0:01:37.173,000 --> 0:01:4,000
as a child when your sense of self and of time

32
0:01:40.699,000 --> 0:01:42,000
became sophisticated enough

33
0:01:42.798,000 --> 0:01:45,000
for you to realize you were mortal,

34
0:01:46.72,000 --> 0:01:49,000
so at some point in the evolution of our species,

35
0:01:50.426,000 --> 0:01:53,000
some early human's sense of self and of time

36
0:01:53.441,000 --> 0:01:55,000
became sophisticated enough

37
0:01:55.684,000 --> 0:01:58,000
for them to become the first human to realize,

38
0:01:58.799,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"I'm going to die."

39
0:02:02.232,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is, if you like, our curse.

40
0:02:04.451,000 --> 0:02:08,000
It's the price we pay for being so damn clever.

41
0:02:08.494,000 --> 0:02:1,000
We have to live in the knowledge

42
0:02:10.593,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that the worst thing that can possibly happen

43
0:02:13.254,000 --> 0:02:14,000
one day surely will,

44
0:02:14.878,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the end of all our projects,

45
0:02:16.384,000 --> 0:02:19,000
our hopes, our dreams, of our individual world.

46
0:02:19.848,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We each live in the shadow of a personal

47
0:02:23.029,000 --> 0:02:24,000
apocalypse.

48
0:02:25.018,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And that's frightening. It's terrifying.

49
0:02:27.522,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And so we look for a way out.

50
0:02:29.982,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And in my case, as I was about five years old,

51
0:02:33.263,000 --> 0:02:35,000
this meant asking my mum.

52
0:02:36.258,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now when I first started asking

53
0:02:38.72,000 --> 0:02:39,000
what happens when we die,

54
0:02:40.501,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the grown-ups around me at the time

55
0:02:42.593,000 --> 0:02:45,000
answered with a typical English mix of awkwardness

56
0:02:45.796,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and half-hearted Christianity,

57
0:02:48.783,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and the phrase I heard most often

58
0:02:50.727,000 --> 0:02:51,000
was that granddad was now

59
0:02:52.286,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"up there looking down on us,"

60
0:02:54.75,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and if I should die too, which wouldn't happen of course,

61
0:02:57.715,000 --> 0:02:59,000
then I too would go up there,

62
0:03:00.511,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which made death sound a lot like

63
0:03:02.561,000 --> 0:03:04,000
an existential elevator.

64
0:03:05.215,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now this didn't sound very plausible.

65
0:03:08.333,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I used to watch a children's news program at the time,

66
0:03:11.236,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and this was the era of space exploration.

67
0:03:13.676,000 --> 0:03:15,000
There were always rockets going up into the sky,

68
0:03:15.85,000 --> 0:03:17,000
up into space, going up there.

69
0:03:18.546,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But none of the astronauts when they came back

70
0:03:20.875,000 --> 0:03:23,000
ever mentioned having met my granddad

71
0:03:24.107,000 --> 0:03:26,000
or any other dead people.

72
0:03:26.566,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But I was scared,

73
0:03:27.869,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and the idea of taking the existential elevator

74
0:03:30.309,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to see my granddad

75
0:03:31.915,000 --> 0:03:32,000
sounded a lot better than being swallowed

76
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
by the void while I slept.

77
0:03:36.401,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And so I believed it anyway,

78
0:03:38.67,000 --> 0:03:4,000
even though it didn't make much sense.

79
0:03:41.341,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And this thought process that I went through

80
0:03:43.583,000 --> 0:03:45,000
as a child, and have been through many times since,

81
0:03:46.114,000 --> 0:03:47,000
including as a grown-up,

82
0:03:48.024,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is a product of what psychologists call

83
0:03:50.471,000 --> 0:03:51,000
a bias.

84
0:03:51.935,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Now a bias is a way in which we systematically

85
0:03:55.209,000 --> 0:03:56,000
get things wrong,

86
0:03:56.927,000 --> 0:03:58,000
ways in which we miscalculate, misjudge,

87
0:03:59.611,000 --> 0:04:02,000
distort reality, or see what we want to see,

88
0:04:03.2,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and the bias I'm talking about

89
0:04:05.432,000 --> 0:04:06,000
works like this:

90
0:04:06.87,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Confront someone with the fact

91
0:04:09.105,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that they are going to die

92
0:04:10.652,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and they will believe just about any story

93
0:04:13.685,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that tells them it isn't true

94
0:04:15.543,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and they can, instead, live forever,

95
0:04:17.957,000 --> 0:04:21,000
even if it means taking the existential elevator.

96
0:04:22.042,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now we can see this as the biggest bias of all.

97
0:04:26.47,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It has been demonstrated in over 400

98
0:04:29.345,000 --> 0:04:3,000
empirical studies.

99
0:04:31.026,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Now these studies are ingenious, but they're simple.

100
0:04:33.535,000 --> 0:04:34,000
They work like this.

101
0:04:35.47,000 --> 0:04:36,000
You take two groups of people

102
0:04:36.96,000 --> 0:04:38,000
who are similar in all relevant respects,

103
0:04:39.743,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and you remind one group that they're going to die

104
0:04:42.432,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but not the other, then you compare their behavior.

105
0:04:45.061,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So you're observing how it biases behavior

106
0:04:48.934,000 --> 0:04:51,000
when people become aware of their mortality.

107
0:04:52.688,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And every time, you get the same result:

108
0:04:55.6,000 --> 0:04:58,000
People who are made aware of their mortality

109
0:04:58.687,000 --> 0:05:,000
are more willing to believe stories

110
0:05:00.698,000 --> 0:05:01,000
that tell them they can escape death

111
0:05:02.561,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and live forever.

112
0:05:04.333,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So here's an example: One recent study

113
0:05:06.622,000 --> 0:05:08,000
took two groups of agnostics,

114
0:05:09.392,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that is people who are undecided

115
0:05:10.988,000 --> 0:05:12,000
in their religious beliefs.

116
0:05:13.503,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Now, one group was asked to think about being dead.

117
0:05:17.087,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The other group was asked to think about

118
0:05:18.732,000 --> 0:05:19,000
being lonely.

119
0:05:20.565,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They were then asked again about their religious beliefs.

120
0:05:23.381,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Those who had been asked to think about being dead

121
0:05:26.245,000 --> 0:05:29,000
were afterwards twice as likely to express faith

122
0:05:29.818,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in God and Jesus.

123
0:05:31.478,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Twice as likely.

124
0:05:33.256,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Even though the before they were all equally agnostic.

125
0:05:35.964,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But put the fear of death in them,

126
0:05:37.725,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and they run to Jesus.

127
0:05:41.584,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Now, this shows that reminding people of death

128
0:05:45.111,000 --> 0:05:48,000
biases them to believe, regardless of the evidence,

129
0:05:48.341,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and it works not just for religion,

130
0:05:50.366,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but for any kind of belief system

131
0:05:52.603,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that promises immortality in some form,

132
0:05:56.063,000 --> 0:05:57,000
whether it's becoming famous

133
0:05:57.868,000 --> 0:05:58,000
or having children

134
0:05:59.282,000 --> 0:06:,000
or even nationalism,

135
0:06:00.629,000 --> 0:06:03,000
which promises you can live on as part of a greater whole.

136
0:06:03.902,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This is a bias that has shaped

137
0:06:05.833,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the course of human history.

138
0:06:09.172,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Now, the theory behind this bias

139
0:06:11.439,000 --> 0:06:12,000
in the over 400 studies

140
0:06:13.176,000 --> 0:06:15,000
is called terror management theory,

141
0:06:15.305,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and the idea is simple. It's just this.

142
0:06:17.655,000 --> 0:06:19,000
We develop our worldviews,

143
0:06:20.204,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that is, the stories we tell ourselves

144
0:06:22.361,000 --> 0:06:24,000
about the world and our place in it,

145
0:06:25.097,000 --> 0:06:27,000
in order to help us manage

146
0:06:27.379,000 --> 0:06:29,000
the terror of death.

147
0:06:30.293,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And these immortality stories

148
0:06:32.092,000 --> 0:06:34,000
have thousands of different manifestations,

149
0:06:35.089,000 --> 0:06:38,000
but I believe that behind the apparent diversity

150
0:06:38.673,000 --> 0:06:4,000
there are actually just four basic forms

151
0:06:41.372,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that these immortality stories can take.

152
0:06:44.883,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And we can see them repeating themselves

153
0:06:46.688,000 --> 0:06:49,000
throughout history, just with slight variations

154
0:06:49.858,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to reflect the vocabulary of the day.

155
0:06:52.623,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now I'm going to briefly introduce these four

156
0:06:55.131,000 --> 0:06:57,000
basic forms of immortality story,

157
0:06:57.384,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and I want to try to give you some sense

158
0:06:58.954,000 --> 0:07:,000
of the way in which they're retold by each culture

159
0:07:01.267,000 --> 0:07:02,000
or generation

160
0:07:03.034,000 --> 0:07:05,000
using the vocabulary of their day.

161
0:07:05.206,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Now, the first story is the simplest.

162
0:07:07.845,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We want to avoid death,

163
0:07:09.998,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and the dream of doing that in this body

164
0:07:12.423,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in this world forever

165
0:07:13.783,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is the first and simplest kind of immortality story,

166
0:07:17.074,000 --> 0:07:19,000
and it might at first sound implausible,

167
0:07:19.533,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but actually, almost every culture in human history

168
0:07:23.514,000 --> 0:07:25,000
has had some myth or legend

169
0:07:25.576,000 --> 0:07:27,000
of an elixir of life or a fountain of youth

170
0:07:28.337,000 --> 0:07:3,000
or something that promises to keep us going

171
0:07:31.316,000 --> 0:07:34,000
forever.

172
0:07:34.453,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Ancient Egypt had such myths,

173
0:07:36.046,000 --> 0:07:38,000
ancient Babylon, ancient India.

174
0:07:38.414,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Throughout European history, we find them in the work of the alchemists,

175
0:07:41.266,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and of course we still believe this today,

176
0:07:44.06,000 --> 0:07:46,000
only we tell this story using the vocabulary

177
0:07:46.623,000 --> 0:07:47,000
of science.

178
0:07:48.279,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So 100 years ago,

179
0:07:49.885,000 --> 0:07:5,000
hormones had just been discovered,

180
0:07:51.704,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and people hoped that hormone treatments

181
0:07:53.356,000 --> 0:07:55,000
were going to cure aging and disease,

182
0:07:56.055,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and now instead we set our hopes on stem cells,

183
0:07:58.908,000 --> 0:08:,000
genetic engineering, and nanotechnology.

184
0:08:01.203,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But the idea that science can cure death

185
0:08:05.161,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is just one more chapter in the story

186
0:08:07.502,000 --> 0:08:09,000
of the magical elixir,

187
0:08:09.735,000 --> 0:08:13,000
a story that is as old as civilization.

188
0:08:14.171,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But betting everything on the idea of finding the elixir

189
0:08:16.951,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and staying alive forever

190
0:08:18.354,000 --> 0:08:19,000
is a risky strategy.

191
0:08:20.155,000 --> 0:08:22,000
When we look back through history

192
0:08:22.395,000 --> 0:08:24,000
at all those who have sought an elixir in the past,

193
0:08:25.179,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the one thing they now have in common

194
0:08:27.008,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is that they're all dead.

195
0:08:29.638,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So we need a backup plan, and exactly this kind of plan B

196
0:08:33.376,000 --> 0:08:36,000
is what the second kind of immortality story offers,

197
0:08:36.947,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and that's resurrection.

198
0:08:38.702,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And it stays with the idea that I am this body,

199
0:08:41.076,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I am this physical organism.

200
0:08:43.051,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It accepts that I'm going to have to die

201
0:08:45.219,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but says, despite that,

202
0:08:46.593,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I can rise up and I can live again.

203
0:08:49.096,000 --> 0:08:51,000
In other words, I can do what Jesus did.

204
0:08:51.714,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Jesus died, he was three days in the [tomb],

205
0:08:53.759,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and then he rose up and lived again.

206
0:08:56.87,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And the idea that we can all be resurrected to live again

207
0:08:59.989,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is orthodox believe, not just for Christians

208
0:09:02.277,000 --> 0:09:04,000
but also Jews and Muslims.

209
0:09:04.98,000 --> 0:09:06,000
But our desire to believe this story

210
0:09:07.144,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is so deeply embedded

211
0:09:09.154,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that we are reinventing it again

212
0:09:11.252,000 --> 0:09:12,000
for the scientific age,

213
0:09:12.744,000 --> 0:09:14,000
for example, with the idea of cryonics.

214
0:09:15.567,000 --> 0:09:16,000
That's the idea that when you die,

215
0:09:17.157,000 --> 0:09:18,000
you can have yourself frozen,

216
0:09:19.156,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and then, at some point when technology

217
0:09:21.545,000 --> 0:09:22,000
has advanced enough,

218
0:09:22.756,000 --> 0:09:24,000
you can be thawed out and repaired and revived

219
0:09:24.876,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and so resurrected.

220
0:09:26.165,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And so some people believe an omnipotent god

221
0:09:29.013,000 --> 0:09:3,000
will resurrect them to live again,

222
0:09:30.892,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and other people believe an omnipotent scientist will do it.

223
0:09:35.035,000 --> 0:09:37,000
But for others, the whole idea of resurrection,

224
0:09:37.749,000 --> 0:09:39,000
of climbing out of the grave,

225
0:09:39.752,000 --> 0:09:41,000
it's just too much like a bad zombie movie.

226
0:09:42.471,000 --> 0:09:44,000
They find the body too messy, too unreliable

227
0:09:45.262,000 --> 0:09:47,000
to guarantee eternal life,

228
0:09:47.41,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and so they set their hopes on the third,

229
0:09:50.501,000 --> 0:09:52,000
more spiritual immortality story,

230
0:09:52.618,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the idea that we can leave our body behind

231
0:09:54.954,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and live on as a soul.

232
0:09:57.251,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Now, the majority of people on Earth

233
0:09:59.24,000 --> 0:10:,000
believe they have a soul,

234
0:10:01.013,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and the idea is central to many religions.

235
0:10:03.423,000 --> 0:10:05,000
But even though, in its current form,

236
0:10:05.737,000 --> 0:10:06,000
in its traditional form,

237
0:10:07.652,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the idea of the soul is still hugely popular,

238
0:10:09.815,000 --> 0:10:1,000
nonetheless we are again

239
0:10:11.247,000 --> 0:10:13,000
reinventing it for the digital age,

240
0:10:13.471,000 --> 0:10:14,000
for example with the idea

241
0:10:14.948,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that you can leave your body behind

242
0:10:16.938,000 --> 0:10:18,000
by uploading your mind, your essence,

243
0:10:19.184,000 --> 0:10:2,000
the real you, onto a computer,

244
0:10:21.14,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and so live on as an avatar in the ether.

245
0:10:25.752,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But of course there are skeptics who say

246
0:10:27.775,000 --> 0:10:28,000
if we look at the evidence of science,

247
0:10:29.619,000 --> 0:10:3,000
particularly neuroscience,

248
0:10:31.263,000 --> 0:10:32,000
it suggests that your mind,

249
0:10:33.092,000 --> 0:10:34,000
your essence, the real you,

250
0:10:34.672,000 --> 0:10:36,000
is very much dependent on a particular part

251
0:10:37.085,000 --> 0:10:39,000
of your body, that is, your brain.

252
0:10:39.306,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And such skeptics can find comfort

253
0:10:41.827,000 --> 0:10:43,000
in the fourth kind of immortality story,

254
0:10:44.085,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and that is legacy,

255
0:10:46.442,000 --> 0:10:47,000
the idea that you can live on

256
0:10:47.922,000 --> 0:10:49,000
through the echo you leave in the world,

257
0:10:50.173,000 --> 0:10:52,000
like the great Greek warrior Achilles,

258
0:10:52.522,000 --> 0:10:54,000
who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy

259
0:10:55.151,000 --> 0:10:58,000
so that he might win immortal fame.

260
0:10:58.204,000 --> 0:11:,000
And the pursuit of fame is as widespread

261
0:11:00.47,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and popular now as it ever was,

262
0:11:02.611,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and in our digital age,

263
0:11:04.19,000 --> 0:11:05,000
it's even easier to achieve.

264
0:11:05.718,000 --> 0:11:07,000
You don't need to be a great warrior like Achilles

265
0:11:08.042,000 --> 0:11:09,000
or a great king or hero.

266
0:11:09.735,000 --> 0:11:13,000
All you need is an Internet connection and a funny cat. (Laughter)

267
0:11:14.558,000 --> 0:11:16,000
But some people prefer to leave a more tangible,

268
0:11:17.021,000 --> 0:11:19,000
biological legacy -- children, for example.

269
0:11:19.865,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Or they like, they hope, to live on

270
0:11:22.141,000 --> 0:11:23,000
as part of some greater whole,

271
0:11:23.858,000 --> 0:11:25,000
a nation or a family or a tribe,

272
0:11:26.307,000 --> 0:11:28,000
their gene pool.

273
0:11:28.773,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But again, there are skeptics

274
0:11:30.286,000 --> 0:11:31,000
who doubt whether legacy

275
0:11:31.999,000 --> 0:11:32,000
really is immortality.

276
0:11:33.974,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Woody Allen, for example, who said,

277
0:11:36.051,000 --> 0:11:38,000
"I don't want to live on in the hearts of my countrymen.

278
0:11:38.547,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I want to live on in my apartment."

279
0:11:40.744,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So those are the four

280
0:11:42.511,000 --> 0:11:44,000
basic kinds of immortality stories,

281
0:11:44.694,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and I've tried to give just some sense

282
0:11:46.336,000 --> 0:11:48,000
of how they're retold by each generation

283
0:11:48.629,000 --> 0:11:49,000
with just slight variations

284
0:11:50.216,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to fit the fashions of the day.

285
0:11:52.521,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And the fact that they recur in this way,

286
0:11:56.01,000 --> 0:11:58,000
in such a similar form but in such different belief systems,

287
0:11:58.998,000 --> 0:11:59,000
suggests, I think,

288
0:12:00.576,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that we should be skeptical of the truth

289
0:12:02.978,000 --> 0:12:05,000
of any particular version of these stories.

290
0:12:06.739,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The fact that some people believe

291
0:12:08.85,000 --> 0:12:1,000
an omnipotent god will resurrect them to live again

292
0:12:11.515,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and others believe an omnipotent scientist will do it

293
0:12:15.216,000 --> 0:12:18,000
suggests that neither are really believing this

294
0:12:18.254,000 --> 0:12:2,000
on the strength of the evidence.

295
0:12:20.924,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Rather, we believe these stories

296
0:12:23.35,000 --> 0:12:24,000
because we are biased to believe them,

297
0:12:25.333,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and we are biased to believe them

298
0:12:27.161,000 --> 0:12:31,000
because we are so afraid of death.

299
0:12:31.431,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So the question is,

300
0:12:33.486,000 --> 0:12:36,000
are we doomed to lead the one life we have

301
0:12:36.958,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in a way that is shaped by fear and denial,

302
0:12:40.651,000 --> 0:12:43,000
or can we overcome this bias?

303
0:12:43.726,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Well the Greek philosopher Epicurus

304
0:12:46.193,000 --> 0:12:47,000
thought we could.

305
0:12:47.921,000 --> 0:12:5,000
He argued that the fear of death is natural,

306
0:12:51.469,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but it is not rational.

307
0:12:53.884,000 --> 0:12:55,000
"Death," he said, "is nothing to us,

308
0:12:56.542,000 --> 0:12:58,000
because when we are here, death is not,

309
0:12:59.392,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and when death is here, we are gone."

310
0:13:03.145,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Now this is often quoted, but it's difficult

311
0:13:04.943,000 --> 0:13:06,000
to really grasp, to really internalize,

312
0:13:07.265,000 --> 0:13:09,000
because exactly this idea of being gone

313
0:13:09.428,000 --> 0:13:11,000
is so difficult to imagine.

314
0:13:11.567,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So 2,000 years later, another philosopher,

315
0:13:13.798,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Ludwig Wittgenstein, put it like this:

316
0:13:17.255,000 --> 0:13:19,000
"Death is not an event in life:

317
0:13:20.199,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We do not live to experience death.

318
0:13:23.841,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And so," he added,

319
0:13:25.035,000 --> 0:13:27,000
"in this sense, life has no end."

320
0:13:27.97,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So it was natural for me as a child

321
0:13:31.146,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to fear being swallowed by the void,

322
0:13:33.513,000 --> 0:13:34,000
but it wasn't rational,

323
0:13:35.392,000 --> 0:13:36,000
because being swallowed by the void

324
0:13:37.377,000 --> 0:13:39,000
is not something that any of us

325
0:13:39.455,000 --> 0:13:42,000
will ever live to experience.

326
0:13:42.725,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Now, overcoming this bias is not easy because

327
0:13:45.254,000 --> 0:13:47,000
the fear of death is so deeply embedded in us,

328
0:13:48.213,000 --> 0:13:52,000
yet when we see that the fear itself is not rational,

329
0:13:52.695,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and when we bring out into the open

330
0:13:54.825,000 --> 0:13:56,000
the ways in which it can unconsciously bias us,

331
0:13:57.523,000 --> 0:13:58,000
then we can at least start

332
0:13:59.374,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to try to minimize the influence it has

333
0:14:02.008,000 --> 0:14:03,000
on our lives.

334
0:14:03.891,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Now, I find it helps to see life

335
0:14:06.709,000 --> 0:14:07,000
as being like a book:

336
0:14:08.553,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Just as a book is bounded by its covers,

337
0:14:11.021,000 --> 0:14:12,000
by beginning and end,

338
0:14:12.298,000 --> 0:14:15,000
so our lives are bounded by birth and death,

339
0:14:16.036,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and even though a book is limited by beginning and end,

340
0:14:19.551,000 --> 0:14:21,000
it can encompass distant landscapes,

341
0:14:21.687,000 --> 0:14:24,000
exotic figures, fantastic adventures.

342
0:14:24.917,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And even though a book is limited by beginning and end,

343
0:14:28.266,000 --> 0:14:29,000
the characters within it

344
0:14:30.089,000 --> 0:14:32,000
know no horizons.

345
0:14:32.931,000 --> 0:14:35,000
They only know the moments that make up their story,

346
0:14:36.088,000 --> 0:14:38,000
even when the book is closed.

347
0:14:39.028,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And so the characters of a book

348
0:14:41.164,000 --> 0:14:44,000
are not afraid of reaching the last page.

349
0:14:44.646,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Long John Silver is not afraid of you

350
0:14:46.924,000 --> 0:14:48,000
finishing your copy of "Treasure Island."

351
0:14:49.759,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And so it should be with us.

352
0:14:51.459,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Imagine the book of your life,

353
0:14:53.603,000 --> 0:14:55,000
its covers, its beginning and end, and your birth and your death.

354
0:14:56.387,000 --> 0:14:58,000
You can only know the moments in between,

355
0:14:58.564,000 --> 0:14:59,000
the moments that make up your life.

356
0:15:00.499,000 --> 0:15:01,000
It makes no sense for you to fear

357
0:15:02.446,000 --> 0:15:04,000
what is outside of those covers,

358
0:15:04.536,000 --> 0:15:05,000
whether before your birth

359
0:15:06.006,000 --> 0:15:07,000
or after your death.

360
0:15:07.982,000 --> 0:15:09,000
And you needn't worry how long the book is,

361
0:15:10.511,000 --> 0:15:13,000
or whether it's a comic strip or an epic.

362
0:15:13.984,000 --> 0:15:14,000
The only thing that matters

363
0:15:15.526,000 --> 0:15:18,000
is that you make it a good story.

364
0:15:19.024,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Thank you.

365
0:15:21.244,000 --> 0:15:25,000
(Applause)

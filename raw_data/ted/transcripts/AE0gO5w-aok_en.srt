1
0:00:13.039,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I cannot forget them.

2
0:00:15.692,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Their names were Aslan, Alik, Andrei,

3
0:00:20.469,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Fernanda, Fred, Galina, Gunnhild,

4
0:00:25.113,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Hans, Ingeborg, Matti, Natalya,

5
0:00:30.407,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Nancy, Sheryl, Usman, Zarema,

6
0:00:35.167,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and the list is longer.

7
0:00:38.255,000 --> 0:00:41,000
For many, their existence, their humanity,

8
0:00:41.599,000 --> 0:00:44,000
has been reduced to statistics,

9
0:00:45.244,000 --> 0:00:49,000
coldly recorded as "security incidents."

10
0:00:49.54,000 --> 0:00:5,000
For me, they were colleagues

11
0:00:51.095,000 --> 0:00:54,000
belonging to that community of humanitarian aid workers

12
0:00:54.625,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that tried to bring a bit of comfort

13
0:00:57.434,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to the victims of the wars in Chechnya in the '90s.

14
0:01:01.521,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They were nurses, logisticians, shelter experts,

15
0:01:06.164,000 --> 0:01:08,000
paralegals, interpreters.

16
0:01:08.997,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And for this service, they were murdered,

17
0:01:13.153,000 --> 0:01:15,000
their families torn apart,

18
0:01:15.615,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and their story largely forgotten.

19
0:01:18.827,000 --> 0:01:21,000
No one was ever sentenced for these crimes.

20
0:01:22.884,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I cannot forget them.

21
0:01:25.041,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They live in me somehow,

22
0:01:27.09,000 --> 0:01:3,000
their memories giving me meaning every day.

23
0:01:30.32,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But they are also haunting the dark street of my mind.

24
0:01:34.751,000 --> 0:01:35,000
As humanitarian aid workers,

25
0:01:36.712,000 --> 0:01:39,000
they made the choice to be at the side of the victim,

26
0:01:40.064,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to provide some assistance, some comfort, some protection,

27
0:01:44.661,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but when they needed protection themselves,

28
0:01:47.587,000 --> 0:01:48,000
it wasn't there.

29
0:01:49.685,000 --> 0:01:52,000
When you see the headlines of your newspaper these days

30
0:01:52.858,000 --> 0:01:55,000
with the war in Iraq or in Syria --

31
0:01:55.923,000 --> 0:01:59,000
aid worker abducted, hostage executed --

32
0:02:00.087,000 --> 0:02:02,000
but who were they?

33
0:02:02.1,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Why were they there?

34
0:02:04.025,000 --> 0:02:06,000
What motivated them?

35
0:02:06.033,000 --> 0:02:09,000
How did we become so indifferent to these crimes?

36
0:02:09.909,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This is why I am here today with you.

37
0:02:13.038,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We need to find better ways to remember them.

38
0:02:16.575,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We also need to explain the key values to which they dedicated their lives.

39
0:02:22.566,000 --> 0:02:26,000
We also need to demand justice.

40
0:02:28.058,000 --> 0:02:29,000
When in '96 I was sent

41
0:02:29.939,000 --> 0:02:32,000
by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to the North Caucasus,

42
0:02:33.654,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I knew some of the risks.

43
0:02:35.526,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Five colleagues had been killed,

44
0:02:37.879,000 --> 0:02:39,000
three had been seriously injured,

45
0:02:39.946,000 --> 0:02:41,000
seven had already been taken hostage.

46
0:02:42.291,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So we were careful.

47
0:02:44.078,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We were using armored vehicles, decoy cars,

48
0:02:48.152,000 --> 0:02:51,000
changing patterns of travel, changing homes,

49
0:02:51.207,000 --> 0:02:53,000
all sorts of security measures.

50
0:02:55.258,000 --> 0:03:,000
Yet on a cold winter night of January '98, it was my turn.

51
0:03:01.208,000 --> 0:03:04,000
When I entered my flat in Vladikavkaz with a guard,

52
0:03:05.185,000 --> 0:03:07,000
we were surrounded by armed men.

53
0:03:08.781,000 --> 0:03:1,000
They took the guard, they put him on the floor,

54
0:03:10.998,000 --> 0:03:12,000
they beat him up in front of me,

55
0:03:13.622,000 --> 0:03:15,000
tied him, dragged him away.

56
0:03:17.536,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I was handcuffed, blindfolded, and forced to kneel,

57
0:03:22.321,000 --> 0:03:25,000
as the silencer of a gun pressed against my neck.

58
0:03:26.204,000 --> 0:03:27,000
When it happens to you,

59
0:03:27.942,000 --> 0:03:3,000
there is no time for thinking, no time for praying.

60
0:03:32.045,000 --> 0:03:34,000
My brain went on automatic,

61
0:03:34.749,000 --> 0:03:38,000
rewinding quickly the life I'd just left behind.

62
0:03:39.115,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It took me long minutes to figure out

63
0:03:41.645,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that those masked men there were not there to kill me,

64
0:03:45.058,000 --> 0:03:49,000
but that someone, somewhere, had ordered my kidnapping.

65
0:03:50.551,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Then a process of dehumanization started that day.

66
0:03:54.622,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I was no more than just a commodity.

67
0:04:01.195,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I normally don't talk about this,

68
0:04:03.011,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but I'd like to share a bit with you some of those 317 days of captivity.

69
0:04:08.598,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I was kept in an underground cellar,

70
0:04:11.654,000 --> 0:04:13,000
total darkness,

71
0:04:13.718,000 --> 0:04:16,000
for 23 hours and 45 minutes every day,

72
0:04:17.472,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and then the guards would come, normally two.

73
0:04:20.758,000 --> 0:04:22,000
They would bring a big piece of bread,

74
0:04:23.432,000 --> 0:04:25,000
a bowl of soup, and a candle.

75
0:04:27.206,000 --> 0:04:31,000
That candle would burn for 15 minutes,

76
0:04:31.28,000 --> 0:04:34,000
15 minutes of precious light,

77
0:04:35.088,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and then they would take it away, and I returned to darkness.

78
0:04:41.024,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I was chained by a metal cable to my bed.

79
0:04:44.538,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I could do only four small steps.

80
0:04:48.95,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I always dreamt of the fifth one.

81
0:04:52.735,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And no TV, no radio, no newspaper, no one to talk to.

82
0:04:56.976,000 --> 0:05:,000
I had no towel, no soap, no toilet paper,

83
0:05:01.069,000 --> 0:05:07,000
just two metal buckets open, one for water, for one waste.

84
0:05:09.926,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Can you imagine that mock execution can be a pastime for guards

85
0:05:14.955,000 --> 0:05:19,000
when they are sadistic or when they are just bored or drunk?

86
0:05:21.665,000 --> 0:05:24,000
We are breaking my nerves very slowly.

87
0:05:25.073,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Isolation and darkness are particularly difficult to describe.

88
0:05:29.583,000 --> 0:05:31,000
How do you describe nothing?

89
0:05:31.975,000 --> 0:05:34,000
There are no words for the depths of loneliness I reached

90
0:05:34.993,000 --> 0:05:39,000
in that very thin border between sanity and madness.

91
0:05:42.168,000 --> 0:05:47,000
In the darkness, sometimes I played imaginary games of checkers.

92
0:05:47.408,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I would start with the black,

93
0:05:49.611,000 --> 0:05:5,000
play with the white,

94
0:05:51.27,000 --> 0:05:53,000
back to the black trying to trick the other side.

95
0:05:55.469,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I don't play checkers anymore.

96
0:05:58.86,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I was tormented by the thoughts of my family and my colleague, the guard, Edik.

97
0:06:05.177,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I didn't know what had happened to him.

98
0:06:07.987,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I was trying not to think,

99
0:06:10.472,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I tried to fill up my time

100
0:06:11.932,000 --> 0:06:14,000
by doing all sorts of physical exercise on the spot.

101
0:06:15.743,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I tried to pray, I tried all sorts of memorization games.

102
0:06:21.063,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But darkness also creates images and thoughts that are not normal.

103
0:06:25.456,000 --> 0:06:31,000
One part of your brain wants you to resist, to shout, to cry,

104
0:06:31.717,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the other part of the brain orders you to shut up

105
0:06:35.154,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and just go through it.

106
0:06:37.963,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It's a constant internal debate; there is no one to arbitrate.

107
0:06:43.163,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Once a guard came to me, very aggressively, and he told me,

108
0:06:48.083,000 --> 0:06:52,000
"Today you're going to kneel and beg for your food."

109
0:06:52.22,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I wasn't in a good mood, so I insulted him.

110
0:06:55.842,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I insulted his mother, I insulted his ancestors.

111
0:06:58.776,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The consequence was moderate: he threw the food into my waste.

112
0:07:03.207,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The day after he came back with the same demand.

113
0:07:06.882,000 --> 0:07:08,000
He got the same answer,

114
0:07:09.321,000 --> 0:07:13,000
which had the same consequence.

115
0:07:13.532,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Four days later, the body was full of pain.

116
0:07:17.363,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I didn't know hunger hurt so much when you have so little.

117
0:07:21.705,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So when the guards came down,

118
0:07:28.049,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I knelt.

119
0:07:31.063,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I begged for my food.

120
0:07:34.081,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Submission was the only way for me to make it to another candle.

121
0:07:41.302,000 --> 0:07:42,000
After my kidnapping,

122
0:07:43.113,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I was transferred from North Ossetia to Chechnya,

123
0:07:46.27,000 --> 0:07:5,000
three days of slow travel in the trunks of different cars,

124
0:07:50.59,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and upon arrival, I was interrogated

125
0:07:52.889,000 --> 0:07:55,000
for 11 days by a guy called Ruslan.

126
0:07:56.554,000 --> 0:07:57,000
The routine was always the same:

127
0:07:58.318,000 --> 0:08:,000
a bit more light, 45 minutes.

128
0:08:00.71,000 --> 0:08:02,000
He would come down to the cellar,

129
0:08:02.985,000 --> 0:08:04,000
he would ask the guards to tie me on the chair,

130
0:08:05.249,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and he would turn on the music loud.

131
0:08:08.349,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And then he would yell questions.

132
0:08:11.53,000 --> 0:08:13,000
He would scream. He would beat me.

133
0:08:14.325,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I'll spare you the details.

134
0:08:16.248,000 --> 0:08:18,000
There are many questions I could not understand,

135
0:08:18.681,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and there are some questions I did not want to understand.

136
0:08:24.254,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The length of the interrogation was the duration of the tape:

137
0:08:28.433,000 --> 0:08:31,000
15 songs, 45 minutes.

138
0:08:31.8,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I would always long for the last song.

139
0:08:34.575,000 --> 0:08:37,000
On one day, one night in that cellar, I don't know what it was,

140
0:08:38.28,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I heard a child crying above my head,

141
0:08:41.297,000 --> 0:08:43,000
a boy, maybe two or three years old.

142
0:08:44.129,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Footsteps, confusion, people running.

143
0:08:48.866,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So when Ruslan came the day after,

144
0:08:51.9,000 --> 0:08:53,000
before he put the first question to me,

145
0:08:54.369,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I asked him, "How is your son today? Is he feeling better?"

146
0:08:57.968,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Ruslan was taken by surprise.

147
0:09:00.754,000 --> 0:09:02,000
He was furious that the guards may have leaked some details

148
0:09:03.583,000 --> 0:09:05,000
about his private life.

149
0:09:06.161,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I kept talking about NGOs supplying medicines to local clinics

150
0:09:10.874,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that may help his son to get better.

151
0:09:13.785,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And we talked about education, we talked about families.

152
0:09:17.909,000 --> 0:09:18,000
He talked to me about his children.

153
0:09:19.767,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I talked to him about my daughters.

154
0:09:21.833,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And then he'd talk about guns, about cars, about women,

155
0:09:25.223,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and I had to talk about guns, about cars, about women.

156
0:09:29.542,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And we talked until the last song on the tape.

157
0:09:33.28,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Ruslan was the most brutal man I ever met.

158
0:09:38.923,000 --> 0:09:41,000
He did not touch me anymore.

159
0:09:42.22,000 --> 0:09:44,000
He did not ask any other questions.

160
0:09:44.936,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I was no longer just a commodity.

161
0:09:48.791,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Two days after, I was transferred to another place.

162
0:09:53.76,000 --> 0:09:58,000
There, a guard came to me, very close -- it was quite unusual --

163
0:09:58.866,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and he said with a very soft voice, he said,

164
0:10:02.025,000 --> 0:10:04,000
"I'd like to thank you

165
0:10:04.649,000 --> 0:10:08,000
for the assistance your organization provided my family

166
0:10:08.689,000 --> 0:10:12,000
when we were displaced in nearby Dagestan."

167
0:10:14.308,000 --> 0:10:17,000
What could I possibly reply?

168
0:10:17.891,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It was so painful. It was like a blade in the belly.

169
0:10:22.667,000 --> 0:10:25,000
It took me weeks of internal thinking to try to reconcile

170
0:10:26.011,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the good reasons we had to assist that family

171
0:10:29.285,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and the soldier of fortune he became.

172
0:10:32.257,000 --> 0:10:34,000
He was young, he was shy.

173
0:10:34.37,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I never saw his face.

174
0:10:36.645,000 --> 0:10:38,000
He probably meant well.

175
0:10:39.315,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But in those 15 seconds,

176
0:10:41.707,000 --> 0:10:44,000
he made me question everything we did,

177
0:10:45.422,000 --> 0:10:47,000
all the sacrifices.

178
0:10:47.813,000 --> 0:10:5,000
He made me think also how they see us.

179
0:10:51.366,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Until then, I had assumed that they know why we are there

180
0:10:54.036,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and what we are doing.

181
0:10:56.915,000 --> 0:10:58,000
One cannot assume this.

182
0:10:59.768,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Well, explaining why we do this is not that easy,

183
0:11:04.02,000 --> 0:11:05,000
even to our closest relatives.

184
0:11:07.062,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We are not perfect, we are not superior,

185
0:11:10.459,000 --> 0:11:12,000
we are not the world's fire brigade,

186
0:11:12.935,000 --> 0:11:14,000
we are not superheroes,

187
0:11:15.049,000 --> 0:11:16,000
we don't stop wars,

188
0:11:16.721,000 --> 0:11:21,000
we know that humanitarian response is not a substitute for political solution.

189
0:11:22.105,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Yet we do this because one life matters.

190
0:11:26.563,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Sometimes that's the only difference you make --

191
0:11:28.816,000 --> 0:11:31,000
one individual, one family, a small group of individuals --

192
0:11:32.136,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and it matters.

193
0:11:34.11,000 --> 0:11:36,000
When you have a tsunami, an earthquake or a typhoon,

194
0:11:36.967,000 --> 0:11:4,000
you see teams of rescuers coming from all over the world,

195
0:11:41.075,000 --> 0:11:44,000
searching for survivors for weeks.

196
0:11:44.117,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Why? Nobody questions this.

197
0:11:46.671,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Every life matters,

198
0:11:48.784,000 --> 0:11:52,000
or every life should matter.

199
0:11:53.01,000 --> 0:11:55,000
This is the same for us when we help refugees,

200
0:11:55.935,000 --> 0:11:59,000
people displaced within their country by conflict, or stateless persons,

201
0:12:01.595,000 --> 0:12:02,000
I know many people,

202
0:12:03.39,000 --> 0:12:06,000
when they are confronted by overwhelming suffering,

203
0:12:06.398,000 --> 0:12:09,000
they feel powerless and they stop there.

204
0:12:10.169,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It's a pity, because there are so many ways people can help.

205
0:12:14.046,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We don't stop with that feeling.

206
0:12:16.027,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We try to do whatever we can to provide some assistance,

207
0:12:18.678,000 --> 0:12:2,000
some protection, some comfort.

208
0:12:21.332,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We have to.

209
0:12:23.093,000 --> 0:12:24,000
We can't do otherwise.

210
0:12:24.843,000 --> 0:12:29,000
It's what makes us feel, I don't know, simply human.

211
0:12:30.197,000 --> 0:12:34,000
That's a picture of me the day of my release.

212
0:12:34.316,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Months after my release, I met the then-French prime minister.

213
0:12:38.658,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The second thing he told me:

214
0:12:40.7,000 --> 0:12:43,000
"You were totally irresponsible to go to the North Caucasus.

215
0:12:44.231,000 --> 0:12:47,000
You don't know how many problems you've created for us."

216
0:12:50.017,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It was a short meeting.

217
0:12:51.852,000 --> 0:12:52,000
(Laughter)

218
0:12:54.661,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I think helping people in danger is responsible.

219
0:12:59.235,000 --> 0:13:03,000
In that war, that nobody seriously wanted to stop,

220
0:13:03.763,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and we have many of these today,

221
0:13:06.108,000 --> 0:13:1,000
bringing some assistance to people in need and a bit of protection

222
0:13:10.608,000 --> 0:13:11,000
was not just an act of humanity,

223
0:13:12.517,000 --> 0:13:14,000
it was making a real difference for the people.

224
0:13:15.419,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Why could he not understand this?

225
0:13:18.67,000 --> 0:13:19,000
We have a responsibility to try.

226
0:13:20.597,000 --> 0:13:23,000
You've heard about that concept: Responsibility to Protect.

227
0:13:24.431,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Outcomes may depend on various parameters.

228
0:13:28.512,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We may even fail, but there is worse than failing --

229
0:13:32.369,000 --> 0:13:34,000
it's not even trying when we can.

230
0:13:36.441,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Well, if you are met this way, if you sign up for this sort of job,

231
0:13:40.316,000 --> 0:13:44,000
your life is going to be full of joy and sadness,

232
0:13:44.954,000 --> 0:13:46,000
because there are a lot of people we cannot help,

233
0:13:47.633,000 --> 0:13:5,000
a lot of people we cannot protect, a lot of people we did not save.

234
0:13:51.557,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I call them my ghost,

235
0:13:53.8,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and by having witnessed their suffering from close,

236
0:13:56.757,000 --> 0:14:,000
you take a bit of that suffering on yourself.

237
0:14:01.304,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Many young humanitarian workers

238
0:14:03.97,000 --> 0:14:06,000
go through their first experience with a lot of bitterness.

239
0:14:06.988,000 --> 0:14:08,000
They are thrown into situations where they are witness,

240
0:14:09.96,000 --> 0:14:12,000
but they are powerless to bring any change.

241
0:14:13.072,000 --> 0:14:15,000
They have to learn to accept it

242
0:14:15.579,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and gradually turn this into positive energy.

243
0:14:18.958,000 --> 0:14:19,000
It's difficult.

244
0:14:20.407,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Many don't succeed,

245
0:14:22.945,000 --> 0:14:26,000
but for those who do, there is no other job like this.

246
0:14:26.953,000 --> 0:14:29,000
You can see the difference you make every day.

247
0:14:31.643,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Humanitarian aid workers know the risk they are taking

248
0:14:34.805,000 --> 0:14:38,000
in conflict areas or in post-conflict environments,

249
0:14:39.717,000 --> 0:14:45,000
yet our life, our job, is becoming increasingly life-threatening,

250
0:14:46.429,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and the sanctity of our life is fading.

251
0:14:51.441,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Do you know that since the millennium,

252
0:14:54.1,000 --> 0:14:58,000
the number of attacks on humanitarian aid workers has tripled?

253
0:14:59.409,000 --> 0:15:01,000
2013 broke new records:

254
0:15:03.111,000 --> 0:15:06,000
155 colleagues killed,

255
0:15:06.383,000 --> 0:15:09,000
171 seriously wounded,

256
0:15:09.517,000 --> 0:15:12,000
134 abducted.

257
0:15:13.375,000 --> 0:15:16,000
So many broken lives.

258
0:15:17.178,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Until the beginning of the civil war in Somalia in the late '80s,

259
0:15:22.38,000 --> 0:15:26,000
humanitarian aid workers were sometimes victims

260
0:15:26.49,000 --> 0:15:27,000
of what we call collateral damages,

261
0:15:28.487,000 --> 0:15:31,000
but by and large we were not the target of these attacks.

262
0:15:32.202,000 --> 0:15:33,000
This has changed.

263
0:15:33.756,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Look at this picture.

264
0:15:35.032,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Baghdad, August 2003:

265
0:15:37.866,000 --> 0:15:39,000
24 colleagues were killed.

266
0:15:40.631,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Gone are the days when a U.N. blue flag or a Red Cross

267
0:15:44.157,000 --> 0:15:47,000
would automatically protect us.

268
0:15:47.933,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Criminal groups and some political groups

269
0:15:51.195,000 --> 0:15:53,000
have cross-fertilized over the last 20 years,

270
0:15:54.051,000 --> 0:15:57,000
and they've created these sort of hybrids

271
0:15:57.186,000 --> 0:15:59,000
with whom we have no way of communicating.

272
0:16:00.052,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Humanitarian principles are tested, questioned, and often ignored,

273
0:16:05.426,000 --> 0:16:09,000
but perhaps more importantly, we have abandoned the search for justice.

274
0:16:10.312,000 --> 0:16:13,000
There seems to be no consequence whatsoever

275
0:16:13.532,000 --> 0:16:16,000
for attacks against humanitarian aid workers.

276
0:16:16.997,000 --> 0:16:2,000
After my release, I was told not to seek any form of justice.

277
0:16:21.357,000 --> 0:16:24,000
It won't do you any good, that's what I was told.

278
0:16:24.584,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Plus, you're going to put in danger the life of other colleagues.

279
0:16:29.723,000 --> 0:16:32,000
It took me years to see the sentencing

280
0:16:32.884,000 --> 0:16:36,000
of three people associated with my kidnapping,

281
0:16:37.175,000 --> 0:16:39,000
but this was the exception.

282
0:16:39.711,000 --> 0:16:43,000
There was no justice for any of the humanitarian aid workers

283
0:16:44.23,000 --> 0:16:48,000
killed or abducted in Chechnya between '95 and '99,

284
0:16:48.518,000 --> 0:16:5,000
and it's the same all over the world.

285
0:16:52.436,000 --> 0:16:54,000
This is unacceptable.

286
0:16:54.583,000 --> 0:16:55,000
This is inexcusable.

287
0:16:56.394,000 --> 0:17:,000
Attacks on humanitarian aid workers are war crimes in international law.

288
0:17:01.107,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Those crimes should not go unpunished.

289
0:17:04.195,000 --> 0:17:06,000
We must end this cycle of impunity.

290
0:17:06.935,000 --> 0:17:09,000
We must consider that those attacks against humanitarian aid workers

291
0:17:10.766,000 --> 0:17:13,000
are attacks against humanity itself.

292
0:17:14.319,000 --> 0:17:17,000
That makes me furious.

293
0:17:18.274,000 --> 0:17:22,000
I know I'm very lucky compared to the refugees I work for.

294
0:17:24.414,000 --> 0:17:27,000
I don't know what it is to have seen my whole town destroyed.

295
0:17:28.041,000 --> 0:17:32,000
I don't know what it is to have seen my relatives shot in front of me.

296
0:17:32.105,000 --> 0:17:36,000
I don't know what it is to lose the protection of my country.

297
0:17:36.354,000 --> 0:17:4,000
I also know that I'm very lucky compared to other hostages.

298
0:17:40.649,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Four days before my eventful release, four hostages were beheaded

299
0:17:46.331,000 --> 0:17:5,000
a few miles away from where I was kept in captivity.

300
0:17:50.726,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Why them?

301
0:17:52.93,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Why am I here today?

302
0:17:56.641,000 --> 0:17:59,000
No easy answer.

303
0:18:00.43,000 --> 0:18:03,000
I was received with a lot of support that I got from my relatives,

304
0:18:04.043,000 --> 0:18:07,000
from colleagues, from friends, from people I didn't know.

305
0:18:07.862,000 --> 0:18:1,000
They have helped me over the years to come out of the darkness.

306
0:18:12.291,000 --> 0:18:15,000
Not everyone was treated with the same attention.

307
0:18:16.189,000 --> 0:18:19,000
How many of my colleagues, after a traumatic incident,

308
0:18:19.814,000 --> 0:18:22,000
took their own life?

309
0:18:23.09,000 --> 0:18:26,000
I can count nine that I knew personally.

310
0:18:26.819,000 --> 0:18:29,000
How many of my colleagues went through a difficult divorce

311
0:18:30.547,000 --> 0:18:32,000
after a traumatic experience

312
0:18:33.481,000 --> 0:18:37,000
because they could not explain anything anymore to their spouse?

313
0:18:38.209,000 --> 0:18:4,000
I've lost that count.

314
0:18:40.663,000 --> 0:18:43,000
There is a price for this type of life.

315
0:18:44.223,000 --> 0:18:48,000
In Russia, all war monuments have this beautiful inscription at the top.

316
0:18:48.856,000 --> 0:18:52,000
It says, (In Russian)

317
0:18:52.965,000 --> 0:18:55,000
"No one is forgotten, nothing is forgotten."

318
0:18:57.386,000 --> 0:19:,000
I do not forget my lost colleagues.

319
0:19:00.523,000 --> 0:19:02,000
I cannot forget anything.

320
0:19:02.859,000 --> 0:19:05,000
I call on you to remember their dedication

321
0:19:06.072,000 --> 0:19:09,000
and demand that humanitarian aid workers around the world

322
0:19:09.578,000 --> 0:19:11,000
be better protected.

323
0:19:12.155,000 --> 0:19:17,000
We should not let that light of hope they have brought to be switched off.

324
0:19:17.751,000 --> 0:19:21,000
After my ordeal, a lot of colleagues asked me, "But why do you continue?

325
0:19:22.441,000 --> 0:19:24,000
Why do you do this sort of job?

326
0:19:24.647,000 --> 0:19:26,000
Why do you have to go back to it?"

327
0:19:27.201,000 --> 0:19:29,000
My answer was very simple:

328
0:19:30.066,000 --> 0:19:32,000
If I had quit,

329
0:19:32.536,000 --> 0:19:36,000
that would have meant my kidnapper had won.

330
0:19:36.553,000 --> 0:19:38,000
They would have taken my soul

331
0:19:38.904,000 --> 0:19:4,000
and my humanity.

332
0:19:41.179,000 --> 0:19:43,000
Thank you.

333
0:19:43.826,000 --> 0:19:45,000
(Applause)

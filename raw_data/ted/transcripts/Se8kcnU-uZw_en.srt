1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is the venue

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
where, as a young man,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
some of the music that I wrote was first performed.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It was, remarkably,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a pretty good sounding room.

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
it actually sounded pretty good.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This is a song that was recorded there.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Music)

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
This is not Talking Heads,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
in the picture anyway.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Music: "A Clean Break (Let's Work)" by Talking Heads)

13
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So the nature of the room

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
meant that words could be understood.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood.

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The sound system was kind of decent.

17
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And there wasn't a lot of reverberation in the room.

18
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So the rhythms

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
could be pretty intact too,

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
pretty concise.

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Other places around the country had similar rooms.

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This is Tootsie's Orchid Lounge in Nashville.

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The music was in some ways different,

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but in structure and form,

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
very much the same.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The clientele behavior was very much the same too.

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And so the bands at Tootsie's

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
or at CBGB's

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
had to play loud enough --

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the volume had to be loud enough to overcome

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
people falling down, shouting out

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and doing whatever else they were doing.

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Since then, I've played other places

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that are much nicer.

35
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I've played the Disney Hall here

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and Carnegie Hall and places like that.

37
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And it's been very exciting.

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But I also noticed that sometimes the music

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that I had written,

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
or was writing at the time,

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
didn't sound all that great

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
in some of those halls.

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We managed,

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but sometimes those halls didn't seem exactly suited

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to the music I was making

46
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
or had made.

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So I asked myself:

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Do I write stuff

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
for specific rooms?

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Do I have a place, a venue,

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
in mind when I write?

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Is that a kind of model for creativity?

53
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Do we all make things with

54
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a venue, a context, in mind?

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Okay, Africa.

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Music: "Wenlenga" / Various artists)

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Most of the popular music that we know now

58
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
has a big part of its roots in West Africa.

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And the music there,

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I would say, the instruments,

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the intricate rhythms,

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
the way it's played, the setting, the context,

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
it's all perfect. It all works perfect.

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The music works perfectly in that setting.

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
There's no big room

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms.

67
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The instruments are loud enough

68
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that they can be heard without amplification, etc., etc.

69
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's no accident.

70
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It's perfect for that particular context.

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And it would be a mess

72
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in a context like this. This is a gothic cathedral.

73
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Music: "Spem In Alium" by Thomas Tallis)

74
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
In a gothic cathedral, this kind of music is perfect.

75
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It doesn't change key, the notes are long,

76
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
there's almost no rhythm whatsoever,

77
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and the room flatters the music.

78
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It actually improves it.

79
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
This is the room that Bach

80
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
wrote some of his music for. This is the organ.

81
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
It's not as big as a gothic cathedral,

82
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate.

83
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
He can, very innovatively,

84
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
actually change keys

85
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
without risking huge dissonances.

86
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Music: "Fantasia On Jesu, Mein Freunde" by Johann S. Bach)

87
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
This is a little bit later.

88
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in.

89
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I think we're in like 1770, somewhere around there.

90
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
They're smaller, even less reverberant,

91
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
so he can write really frilly music

92
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that's very intricate -- and it works.

93
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
(Music: "Sonata in F," KV 13, by Wolfgang A. Mozart)

94
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It fits the room perfectly.

95
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
This is La Scala.

96
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It's around the same time,

97
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I think it was built around 1776.

98
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
People in the audience in these opera houses, when they were built,

99
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
they used to yell out to one another.

100
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They used to eat, drink and yell out to people on the stage,

101
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
just like they do at CBGB's and places like that.

102
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
If they liked an aria,

103
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
they would holler and suggest

104
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that it be done again as an encore,

105
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
not at the end of the show, but immediately.

106
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
(Laughter)

107
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And well, that was an opera experience.

108
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself.

109
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And the size of the room is not that big.

110
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It's smaller than this.

111
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But Wagner made an innovation.

112
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
He wanted a bigger band.

113
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
He wanted a little more bombast,

114
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
so he increased the size of the orchestra pit

115
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
so he could get more low-end instruments in there.

116
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Music: "Lohengrin / Prelude to Act III" by Richard Wagner)

117
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Okay.

118
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
This is Carnegie Hall.

119
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Obviously, this kind of thing became popular.

120
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The halls got bigger. Carnegie Hall's fair-sized.

121
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
It's larger than some of the other symphony halls.

122
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And they're a lot more reverberant

123
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
than La Scala.

124
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Around the same,

125
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker,

126
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
this kind of rule came into effect

127
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that audiences had to be quiet --

128
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
no more eating, drinking and yelling at the stage,

129
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
or gossiping with one another

130
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
during the show.

131
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
They had to be very quiet.

132
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So those two things combined meant that

133
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
a different kind of music

134
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
worked best in these kind of halls.

135
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
It meant that there could be extreme dynamics,

136
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
which there weren't in some of these

137
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
other kinds of music.

138
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Quiet parts could be heard

139
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that would have been drowned out

140
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
by all the gossiping and shouting.

141
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But because of the reverberation

142
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
in those rooms like Carnegie Hall,

143
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic

144
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and a little more textural.

145
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Music: "Symphony No. 8 in E Flat Major" by Gustav Mahler)

146
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This is Mahler.

147
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It looks like Bob Dylan, but it's Mahler.

148
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
That was Bob's last record, yeah.

149
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Laughter)

150
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Popular music, coming along at the same time.

151
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This is a jazz band.

152
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
According to Scott Joplin, the bands were playing

153
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
on riverboats and clubs.

154
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Again, it's noisy. They're playing for dancers.

155
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
There's certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections

156
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that the dancers really liked.

157
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And they'd say, "Play that part again."

158
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Well, there's only so many times

159
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers.

160
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So the bands started to improvise new melodies.

161
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And a new form of music was born.

162
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Music: "Royal Garden Blues" by W.C. Handy / Ethel Waters)

163
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
These are played mainly in small rooms.

164
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
People are dancing, shouting and drinking.

165
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So the music has to be loud enough

166
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to be heard above that.

167
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Same thing goes true for -- that's the beginning of the century --

168
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
for the whole of 20th-century popular music,

169
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
whether it's rock or Latin music or whatever.

170
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
[Live music] doesn't really change that much.

171
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It changes about a third of the way into the 20th century,

172
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
when this became

173
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
one of the primary venues for music.

174
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And this was one way

175
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
that the music got there.

176
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Microphones enabled singers, in particular,

177
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and musicians and composers,

178
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to completely change the kind of music

179
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that they were writing.

180
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So far, a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music,

181
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but singers, like Frank Sinatra,

182
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
could use the mic

183
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and do things

184
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that they could never do without a microphone.

185
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Other singers after him

186
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
went even further.

187
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
(Music: "My Funny Valentine" by Chet Baker)

188
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
This is Chet Baker.

189
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And this kind of thing

190
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
would have been impossible without a microphone.

191
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well.

192
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And he's singing right into your ear.

193
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
He's whispering into your ears.

194
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
The effect is just electric.

195
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It's like the guy is sitting next to you,

196
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
whispering who knows what into your ear.

197
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So at this point, music diverged.

198
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
There's live music,

199
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and there's recorded music.

200
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And they no longer have to be exactly the same.

201
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Now there's venues like this, a discotheque,

202
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and there's jukeboxes in bars,

203
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
where you don't even need to have a band.

204
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
There doesn't need to be any

205
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
live performing musicians whatsoever,

206
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and the sound systems are good.

207
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
People began to make music

208
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
specifically for discos

209
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and for those sound systems.

210
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And, as with jazz,

211
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
the dancers liked certain sections

212
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
more than they did others.

213
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections.

214
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
(Music: "Rapper's Delight" by The Sugarhill Gang)

215
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The MC would improvise lyrics

216
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies.

217
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And another new form of music was born.

218
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Live performance, when it was incredibly successful,

219
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
ended up in what is probably, acoustically,

220
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
the worst sounding venues on the planet:

221
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
sports stadiums,

222
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
basketball arenas and hockey arenas.

223
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Musicians who ended up there did the best they could.

224
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
They wrote what is now called arena rock,

225
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
which is medium-speed ballads.

226
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Music: "I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For" by U2)

227
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
They did the best they could

228
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
given that this is what they're writing for.

229
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The tempos are medium. It sounds big.

230
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
It's more a social situation

231
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
than a musical situation.

232
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And in some ways, the music

233
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that they're writing for this place

234
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
works perfectly.

235
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So there's more new venues.

236
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
One of the new ones is the automobile.

237
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I grew up with a radio in a car.

238
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
But now that's evolved into something else.

239
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The car is a whole venue.

240
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Music: "Who U Wit" by Lil' Jon & the East Side Boyz)

241
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
The music that, I would say, is written

242
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
for automobile sound systems

243
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
works perfectly on it.

244
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
It might not be what you want to listen to at home,

245
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
but it works great in the car --

246
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
has a huge frequency spectrum,

247
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
you know, big bass and high-end

248
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and the voice kind of stuck in the middle.

249
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Automobile music, you can share with your friends.

250
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
There's one other kind of new venue,

251
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
the private MP3 player.

252
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Presumably, this is just for Christian music.

253
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
(Laughter)

254
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And in some ways it's like Carnegie Hall,

255
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
or when the audience had to hush up,

256
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
because you can now hear every single detail.

257
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
In other ways, it's more like the West African music

258
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
because if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet,

259
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
you turn it up, and the next minute,

260
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
your ears are blasted out by a louder passage.

261
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So that doesn't really work.

262
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I think pop music, mainly,

263
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
it's written today,

264
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
to some extent, is written for these kind of players,

265
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
for this kind of personal experience

266
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
where you can hear extreme detail,

267
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
but the dynamic doesn't change that much.

268
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
So I asked myself:

269
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Okay, is this

270
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
a model for creation,

271
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
this adaptation that we do?

272
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And does it happen anywhere else?

273
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Well, according to David Attenborough and some other people,

274
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
birds do it too --

275
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that the birds in the canopy,

276
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
where the foliage is dense,

277
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
their calls tend to be

278
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
high-pitched, short and repetitive.

279
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And the birds on the floor

280
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
tend to have lower pitched calls,

281
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
so that they don't get distorted

282
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
when they bounce off the forest floor.

283
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And birds like this Savannah sparrow,

284
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
they tend to have a buzzing

285
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Sound clip: Savannah sparrow song)

286
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
type call.

287
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
And it turns out that

288
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
a sound like this

289
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
is the most energy efficient and practical way

290
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
to transmit their call

291
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
across the fields and savannahs.

292
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Other birds, like this tanager,

293
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
have adapted within the same species.

294
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
The tananger on the East Coast of the United States,

295
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
where the forests are a little denser,

296
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
has one kind of call,

297
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and the tananger on the other side, on the west

298
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)

299
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
has a different kind of call.

300
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
(Sound clip: Scarlet tanager song)

301
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So birds do it too.

302
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And I thought:

303
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Well, if this is a model for creation,

304
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
if we make music,

305
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
primarily the form at least,

306
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
to fit these contexts,

307
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls,

308
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and if we write software to fit existing operating systems,

309
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
is that how it works?

310
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Yeah. I think it's evolutionary.

311
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
It's adaptive.

312
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
But the pleasure and the passion and the joy

313
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
is still there.

314
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
This is a reverse view of things

315
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
from the kind of traditional Romantic view.

316
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
The Romantic view is that

317
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
first comes the passion

318
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and then the outpouring of emotion,

319
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and then somehow it gets shaped into something.

320
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And I'm saying,

321
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
well, the passion's still there,

322
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
but the vessel

323
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
that it's going to be injected into and poured into,

324
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that is instinctively and intuitively

325
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
created first.

326
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
We already know where that passion is going.

327
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting.

328
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
The writer,

329
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Thomas Frank,

330
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
says that

331
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
this might be a kind of explanation

332
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
why some voters vote

333
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
against their best interests,

334
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
that voters, like a lot of us,

335
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
assume, that if they hear something that sounds like it's sincere,

336
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
that it's coming from the gut, that it's passionate,

337
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
that it's more authentic.

338
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And they'll vote for that.

339
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So that, if somebody can fake sincerity,

340
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
if they can fake passion,

341
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
they stand a better chance

342
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
of being selected in that way,

343
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
which seems a little dangerous.

344
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I'm saying the two, the passion, the joy,

345
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
are not mutually exclusive.

346
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize

347
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
that we are like the birds.

348
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We adapt.

349
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
We sing.

350
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And like the birds, the joy is still there,

351
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
even though we have changed what we do

352
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
to fit the context.

353
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Thank you very much.

354
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Applause)

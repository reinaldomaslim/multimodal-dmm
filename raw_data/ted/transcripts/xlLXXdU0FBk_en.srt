2
0:00:12.69,000 --> 0:00:13,000
My name is Amy Padnani,

3
0:00:14.04,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I'm an editor on the obituaries desk at the "New York Times."

4
0:00:17.643,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Or, as some friends call me, the angel of death.

5
0:00:21.016,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:23.339,000 --> 0:00:24,000
In fact, people will ask me,

7
0:00:25.134,000 --> 0:00:27,000
"Isn't it depressing, working on obituaries

8
0:00:27.411,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and thinking about death all the time?"

9
0:00:29.728,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But you know what I tell them?

10
0:00:31.229,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Obits aren't about death, they're about life,

11
0:00:33.919,000 --> 0:00:35,000
they're interesting, they're relatable.

12
0:00:36.077,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Often about something you never knew.

13
0:00:39.371,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Recently, for example,

14
0:00:40.966,000 --> 0:00:43,000
we had the obit for the inventor of the sock puppet.

15
0:00:44.671,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:45.998,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Everyone knows what a sock puppet is,

17
0:00:47.903,000 --> 0:00:49,000
but have you ever thought about who created it,

18
0:00:50.125,000 --> 0:00:51,000
or what their life was like?

19
0:00:52.522,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Obits are a signature form of journalism.

20
0:00:54.807,000 --> 0:00:55,000
An art form, if you will.

21
0:00:56.403,000 --> 0:00:59,000
It's an opportunity for a writer to weave the tale of a person's life

22
0:01:00.117,000 --> 0:01:01,000
into a beautiful narrative.

23
0:01:03.038,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Since 1851,

24
0:01:05.03,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the "New York Times" has published thousands of obituaries.

25
0:01:09.159,000 --> 0:01:12,000
For heads of state, famous celebrities,

26
0:01:12.667,000 --> 0:01:14,000
even the person who came up with the name on the Slinky.

27
0:01:16.358,000 --> 0:01:17,000
There's just one problem.

28
0:01:18.474,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Only a small percentage of them

29
0:01:20.474,000 --> 0:01:23,000
chronicle the lives of women and people of color.

30
0:01:25.45,000 --> 0:01:27,000
That's the impetus behind a project I created

31
0:01:27.728,000 --> 0:01:28,000
called "Overlooked,"

32
0:01:29.077,000 --> 0:01:31,000
which tells the stories of marginalized groups of people

33
0:01:31.736,000 --> 0:01:32,000
who never got an obit.

34
0:01:33.133,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's a chance for the newspaper to revisit its 168-year existence

35
0:01:37.839,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and fill in the gaps

36
0:01:39.165,000 --> 0:01:41,000
for people who were, for whatever reason, left out.

37
0:01:42.389,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It's a chance to right the wrongs of the past,

38
0:01:46.477,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and to refocus society's lens on who is considered important.

39
0:01:52.482,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I came up with the idea when I first joined Obituaries in 2017.

40
0:01:56.847,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The Black Lives Matter movement was at a rolling boil,

41
0:02:00.53,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and the conversation on gender inequality had just started bubbling up again.

42
0:02:04.887,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And at the same time, I wondered, as a journalist and as a woman of color,

43
0:02:08.822,000 --> 0:02:1,000
what could I do to help advance this conversation.

44
0:02:11.71,000 --> 0:02:12,000
People were coming out of the shadows

45
0:02:13.529,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to tell stories of injustices that they had faced,

46
0:02:16.028,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and I could feel their pain.

47
0:02:19.101,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So I noticed we would get these emails, sometimes, from readers,

48
0:02:22.143,000 --> 0:02:25,000
saying, "Hey, why don't you have more women and people of color

49
0:02:25.201,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in your obituaries?"

50
0:02:26.855,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And I thought, "Yeah, why don't we?"

51
0:02:29.815,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Since I was new to the team, I asked my colleagues,

52
0:02:32.363,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and they said, "Well, the people who are dying today

53
0:02:34.929,000 --> 0:02:36,000
are from a generation when women and people of color

54
0:02:37.738,000 --> 0:02:39,000
weren't invited to the table to make a difference.

55
0:02:40.659,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Perhaps in a generation or two,

56
0:02:42.237,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we'll start to see more women and people of color in our obituaries."

57
0:02:46.225,000 --> 0:02:48,000
That answer just wasn't satisfying at all.

58
0:02:49.066,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:50.105,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I wanted to know: Where are all the dead women?

60
0:02:52.747,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

61
0:02:55.215,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So I started thinking about how we hear about people who have died, right?

62
0:02:59.028,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Number one way is through reader submissions.

63
0:03:01.734,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And so I thought,

64
0:03:02.918,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"Well, what if we were to look at international newspapers

65
0:03:05.747,000 --> 0:03:06,000
or scour social media?"

66
0:03:07.553,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It was around this time when ...

67
0:03:10.633,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Everything was swirling in my mind,

68
0:03:12.927,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and I came across a website about Mary Outerbridge.

69
0:03:17.082,000 --> 0:03:21,000
She was credited with introducing tennis to America in 1874.

70
0:03:22.193,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I thought, wow, one of the biggest sports in America

71
0:03:24.868,000 --> 0:03:25,000
was introduced by a woman?

72
0:03:26.522,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Does anyone even know that?

73
0:03:28.688,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And did she get a New York Times obituary?

74
0:03:31.514,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Spoiler alert -- she did not.

75
0:03:33.569,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:34.688,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So then I wondered who else we missed.

77
0:03:36.609,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And it sent me on this deep dive through the archives.

78
0:03:40.688,000 --> 0:03:41,000
There were some surprises.

79
0:03:42.45,000 --> 0:03:44,000
The pioneering journalist Ida B. Wells,

80
0:03:44.51,000 --> 0:03:46,000
who started the campaign against lynching.

81
0:03:48.22,000 --> 0:03:5,000
The brilliant poet Sylvia Plath.

82
0:03:51.973,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Ada Lovelace, a mathematician

83
0:03:53.641,000 --> 0:03:55,000
now recognized as the first computer programmer.

84
0:03:57.378,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So I went back to my team and I said,

85
0:03:59.204,000 --> 0:04:01,000
"What if we were to tell their stories now?"

86
0:04:02.442,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It took a while to get buy-in.

87
0:04:04.657,000 --> 0:04:05,000
There was this concern that, you know,

88
0:04:06.516,000 --> 0:04:07,000
the newspaper might look bad

89
0:04:07.878,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because it didn't get it right the first time.

90
0:04:11.204,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It was also a little weird to sort of look back at the past,

91
0:04:15.188,000 --> 0:04:17,000
rather than cover news stories of our day.

92
0:04:18.585,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But I said, "Guys, I really think this is worthwhile."

93
0:04:21.157,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And once my team saw the value in it,

94
0:04:22.974,000 --> 0:04:23,000
they were all in.

95
0:04:24.76,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And so, with the help of a dozen writers and editors,

96
0:04:27.337,000 --> 0:04:3,000
we launched on March 8, 2018,

97
0:04:30.656,000 --> 0:04:32,000
with the stories of 15 remarkable women.

98
0:04:34.45,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And while I knew that the work my team was doing was powerful,

99
0:04:38.12,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I didn't expect the response to be equally powerful.

100
0:04:41.469,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I had hundreds of emails.

101
0:04:43.716,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They were from people who said,

102
0:04:45.303,000 --> 0:04:47,000
"Thank you for finally giving these women a voice."

103
0:04:48.275,000 --> 0:04:5,000
They were from readers who said,

104
0:04:51.187,000 --> 0:04:53,000
"I cried on my way to work, reading these stories,

105
0:04:54.074,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because I felt seen for the first time."

106
0:04:57.116,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And they were from colleagues of mine, who said,

107
0:04:59.379,000 --> 0:05:,000
"I never thought a woman of color

108
0:05:01.065,000 --> 0:05:03,000
would be allowed to achieve something like this

109
0:05:03.307,000 --> 0:05:04,000
at the 'New York Times.'"

110
0:05:05.878,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I also got about 4,000 reader submissions

111
0:05:09.013,000 --> 0:05:11,000
suggesting who else we might have overlooked.

112
0:05:11.473,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And some of those are my favorite stories in the project.

113
0:05:15.481,000 --> 0:05:17,000
My all-time favorite is Grandma Gatewood.

114
0:05:18.037,000 --> 0:05:19,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:19.267,000 --> 0:05:23,000
She survived 30 years of domestic violence at the hands of her husband.

116
0:05:25.044,000 --> 0:05:27,000
One day, he beat her so badly, beyond recognition,

117
0:05:27.765,000 --> 0:05:29,000
he even broke a broomstick over her head,

118
0:05:29.99,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and she threw flour in his face in response.

119
0:05:32.751,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But when the police arrived, they arrested her, not him.

120
0:05:37.03,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The mayor saw her in jail and took her into his own home

121
0:05:39.965,000 --> 0:05:4,000
until she could get back on her feet.

122
0:05:42.62,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Then, one day, she read this article in "National Geographic"

123
0:05:45.568,000 --> 0:05:46,000
about how no woman had ever hiked

124
0:05:47.171,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the Appalachian Trail in its entirety alone.

125
0:05:49.888,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And she said, "You know what? I'm going to do it."

126
0:05:53.63,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Reporters caught wind of the old grandma who is hiking through the woods.

127
0:05:57.542,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And at the finish, they asked her,

128
0:05:59.193,000 --> 0:06:01,000
"How did you survive so rough a place?"

129
0:06:02.403,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But they had no idea what she had survived before that.

130
0:06:06.553,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So, "Overlooked" has become wildly successful.

131
0:06:09.617,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It's becoming a TV show now, on Netflix.

132
0:06:12.212,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Laughter)

133
0:06:13.387,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Applause)

134
0:06:19.038,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I cannot wait to see this thing come to life.

135
0:06:22.633,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Something like 25 different publishers have reached out to me

136
0:06:25.541,000 --> 0:06:27,000
with interest in turning "Overlooked" into a book.

137
0:06:28.76,000 --> 0:06:32,000
All of this clearly shows how timely and necessary this project is.

138
0:06:34.097,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It's also a reminder of how newspapers

139
0:06:36.24,000 --> 0:06:38,000
document what's happening in our world every single day,

140
0:06:38.914,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and we have to make sure not to leave out key people.

141
0:06:42.807,000 --> 0:06:45,000
That's why, even though it's been so meaningful to look back in the past,

142
0:06:46.474,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I'm plagued with the lingering question:

143
0:06:48.609,000 --> 0:06:49,000
"What about the future of obituaries --

144
0:06:50.491,000 --> 0:06:51,000
how do I diversify those?"

145
0:06:52.195,000 --> 0:06:54,000
That was my original problem, right?

146
0:06:55.069,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So to start answering this question, I wanted to gather some information.

147
0:06:58.958,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I went down to the sub-sub-basement level of the New York Times Building,

148
0:07:03.514,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to the archives.

149
0:07:04.728,000 --> 0:07:05,000
We call it the morgue.

150
0:07:06.236,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:08.101,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And I asked for some guidance from our archivist there.

152
0:07:11.355,000 --> 0:07:14,000
He pointed me to a book called "New York Times Obituaries Index."

153
0:07:15.649,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So we handed it to the New York Genealogical Society,

154
0:07:18.165,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and they digitized it for us.

155
0:07:20.338,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And then a programmer wrote up a program that scanned all those headlines

156
0:07:23.791,000 --> 0:07:26,000
for "Mr.," Mrs.," "Lady," "Sir," all the sort of gender-defining terms.

157
0:07:27.986,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And what we found was that from 1851 to 2017,

158
0:07:32.454,000 --> 0:07:35,000
only about 15 to 20 percent of our obits were on women.

159
0:07:37.653,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So next, I worked with a programmer to build this tool,

160
0:07:40.447,000 --> 0:07:41,000
called the diversity analysis tool.

161
0:07:42.32,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It's a very dry name, but bear with me, it's super helpful.

162
0:07:45.776,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It breaks down the percentage of our obits month to month, women to men.

163
0:07:51.222,000 --> 0:07:53,000
OK, if that doesn't sound like much to you,

164
0:07:53.309,000 --> 0:07:55,000
this is how I used to calculate it before.

165
0:07:55.373,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Laughter)

166
0:07:57.99,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So I asked this programmer to program in a goal,

167
0:08:00.253,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and that goal was 30 percent.

168
0:08:02.225,000 --> 0:08:05,000
From the year of "Overlooked's" launch, March of 2018,

169
0:08:05.449,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to March of 2019,

170
0:08:07.344,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I was hoping we could get to 30 percent of our obits on women.

171
0:08:10.629,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It was a number we hadn't achieved in a 168 years,

172
0:08:13.749,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and I'm happy to say we did it -- we got to 31 percent.

173
0:08:17.116,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Applause)

174
0:08:21.479,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's awesome, but it's not enough.

175
0:08:23.601,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Next we're hoping to get to 35 percent,

176
0:08:25.49,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and then 40 percent, until we achieve parity.

177
0:08:28.411,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And then I'm hoping to partner with this programmer again,

178
0:08:31.15,000 --> 0:08:34,000
to build a similar tool to measure people of color in our obits.

179
0:08:35.18,000 --> 0:08:37,000
That was something I wanted to do with "Overlooked" too,

180
0:08:37.839,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to include men of color,

181
0:08:39.022,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and I finally got to do it with a special section

182
0:08:41.338,000 --> 0:08:42,000
for Black History Month,

183
0:08:42.544,000 --> 0:08:45,000
where we told the stories of about a dozen black men and women.

184
0:08:46.125,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Again, it was a really powerful experience.

185
0:08:48.831,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Many of these people had been slaves

186
0:08:50.775,000 --> 0:08:52,000
or were a generation removed from slavery.

187
0:08:53.331,000 --> 0:08:55,000
A lot of them had to make up stories about their past

188
0:08:55.855,000 --> 0:08:56,000
just to get ahead in life.

189
0:08:57.919,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And there were these patterns of their struggles

190
0:09:00.212,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that came up again and again.

191
0:09:02.001,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Elizabeth Jennings, for instance,

192
0:09:03.628,000 --> 0:09:04,000
had to fight for her right to ride

193
0:09:05.293,000 --> 0:09:07,000
on segregated street cars in New York City --

194
0:09:07.587,000 --> 0:09:11,000
a hundred years before Rosa Parks did the exact same thing with buses.

195
0:09:12.268,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It was just a reminder of how far we've come,

196
0:09:14.537,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and how much more we still have left to do.

197
0:09:19.149,000 --> 0:09:21,000
"Overlooked" is including other marginalized people as well.

198
0:09:21.998,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Recently, we had the obit for the computer programmer Alan Turing.

199
0:09:26.157,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Believe it or not, this brilliant man never got an obituary,

200
0:09:29.618,000 --> 0:09:3,000
even though his work

201
0:09:30.848,000 --> 0:09:32,000
decoding German messages during World War II

202
0:09:33.649,000 --> 0:09:34,000
helps end the war.

203
0:09:36.356,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Instead, he died a criminal for his sexual orientation,

204
0:09:39.751,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and he was forced to endure chemical castration.

205
0:09:44.648,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Great things, like this obits project, do not come easily.

206
0:09:48.346,000 --> 0:09:5,000
There were a lot of fits and starts

207
0:09:50.427,000 --> 0:09:53,000
as I worked hard to convince people it was worth getting it off the ground.

208
0:09:54.807,000 --> 0:09:56,000
There were moments when I faced great self-doubt.

209
0:09:57.253,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I wondered if I was crazy or if I was all alone,

210
0:09:59.538,000 --> 0:10:,000
and if I should just give up.

211
0:10:01.419,000 --> 0:10:03,000
When I've seen the reaction to this project,

212
0:10:03.696,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I know I'm not at all alone.

213
0:10:05.268,000 --> 0:10:07,000
There's so many people who feel the way I do.

214
0:10:08.688,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And so yeah, not many people think about obituaries.

215
0:10:11.657,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But when you do, you realize they're a testament to a human life.

216
0:10:16.05,000 --> 0:10:19,000
They're the last chance to talk about somebody's contribution on the world.

217
0:10:21.081,000 --> 0:10:24,000
They were also an example of who society deemed important.

218
0:10:25.163,000 --> 0:10:26,000
A hundred years from now,

219
0:10:26.426,000 --> 0:10:29,000
somebody could be looking into the past to see what our time was like.

220
0:10:30.973,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I'm lucky, as a journalist,

221
0:10:32.553,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to have been able to have used this form of storytelling

222
0:10:35.212,000 --> 0:10:36,000
to help shift a narrative.

223
0:10:37.895,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I was also able to get an established institution

224
0:10:40.315,000 --> 0:10:42,000
to question its own status quo.

225
0:10:43.748,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Little by little, I'm hoping I can keep doing this work,

226
0:10:47.835,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and continue refocusing society's lens

227
0:10:50.288,000 --> 0:10:53,000
so that nobody else gets overlooked.

228
0:10:53.944,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Thank you.

229
0:10:55.119,000 --> 0:10:59,000
(Applause)

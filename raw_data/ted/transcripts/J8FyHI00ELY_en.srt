2
0:00:16.168,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'd like to talk about my dad.

3
0:00:17.76,000 --> 0:00:19,000
My dad has Alzheimer's disease.

4
0:00:20.336,000 --> 0:00:23,000
He started showing the symptoms about 12 years ago,

5
0:00:23.896,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and he was officially diagnosed in 2005.

6
0:00:27.283,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Now he's really pretty sick. He needs help eating,

7
0:00:31.608,000 --> 0:00:34,000
he needs help getting dressed, he doesn't really know where he is

8
0:00:35.496,000 --> 0:00:38,000
or when it is, and it's been really, really hard.

9
0:00:39.36,000 --> 0:00:42,000
My dad was my hero and my mentor for most of my life,

10
0:00:42.872,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and I've spent the last decade watching him disappear.

11
0:00:46.4,000 --> 0:00:54,000
My dad's not alone. There's about 35 million people globally living with some kind of dementia,

12
0:00:54.537,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and by 2030 they're expecting that to double to 70 million.

13
0:00:59.186,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That's a lot of people.

14
0:01:01.336,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Dementia scares us. The confused faces and shaky hands of people who have dementia,

15
0:01:07.952,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the big numbers of people who get it, they frighten us.

16
0:01:11.8,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And because of that fear, we tend to do one of two things:

17
0:01:15.545,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We go into denial: "It's not me, it has nothing to do with me, it's never going to happen to me."

18
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Or, we decide that we're going to prevent dementia,

19
0:01:24.633,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and it will never happen to us because we're going to do everything right and it won't come and get us.

20
0:01:29.449,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'm looking for a third way: I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.

21
0:01:35.2,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Prevention is good, and I'm doing the things that you can do to prevent Alzheimer's.

22
0:01:40.76,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I'm eating right, I'm exercising every day, I'm keeping my mind active,

23
0:01:46.08,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that's what the research says you should do.

24
0:01:48.984,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But the research also shows that there's nothing that will 100 percent protect you.

25
0:01:53.472,000 --> 0:01:56,000
If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.

26
0:01:56.984,000 --> 0:01:58,000
That's what happened with my dad.

27
0:01:59.424,000 --> 0:02:04,000
My dad was a bilingual college professor. His hobbies were chess, bridge and writing op-eds.

28
0:02:05.272,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

29
0:02:09.278,000 --> 0:02:11,000
He got dementia anyway.

30
0:02:11.396,000 --> 0:02:13,000
If the monster wants you, the monster's gonna get you.

31
0:02:13.833,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Especially if you're me, 'cause Alzheimer's tends to run in families.

32
0:02:19.593,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So I'm preparing to get Alzheimer's disease.

33
0:02:23.342,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Based on what I've learned from taking care of my father,

34
0:02:25.296,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and researching what it's like to live with dementia, I'm focusing on three things in my preparation:

35
0:02:30.544,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I'm changing what I do for fun, I'm working to build my physical strength,

36
0:02:36.536,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and -- this is the hard one -- I'm trying to become a better person.

37
0:02:43.335,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Let's start with the hobbies. When you get dementia, it gets harder and harder to enjoy yourself.

38
0:02:49.024,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You can't sit and have long talks with your old friends, because you don't know who they are.

39
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It's confusing to watch television, and often very frightening.

40
0:02:57.448,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And reading is just about impossible.

41
0:03:00.072,000 --> 0:03:03,000
When you care for someone with dementia, and you get training,

42
0:03:03.528,000 --> 0:03:08,000
they train you to engage them in activities that are familiar, hands-on, open-ended.

43
0:03:09.032,000 --> 0:03:13,000
With my dad, that turned out to be letting him fill out forms.

44
0:03:13.544,000 --> 0:03:18,000
He was a college professor at a state school; he knows what paperwork looks like.

45
0:03:19.049,000 --> 0:03:23,000
He'll sign his name on every line, he'll check all the boxes,

46
0:03:23.704,000 --> 0:03:25,000
he'll put numbers in where he thinks there should be numbers.

47
0:03:26.079,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But it got me thinking, what would my caregivers do with me?

48
0:03:30.072,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I'm my father's daughter. I read, I write, I think about global health a lot.

49
0:03:35.568,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Would they give me academic journals so I could scribble in the margins?

50
0:03:39.824,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Would they give me charts and graphs that I could color?

51
0:03:42.928,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So I've been trying to learn to do things that are hands-on.

52
0:03:47.128,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I've always liked to draw, so I'm doing it more even though I'm really very bad at it.

53
0:03:52.434,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I am learning some basic origami. I can make a really great box.

54
0:03:58.056,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

55
0:04:00.203,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And I'm teaching myself to knit, which so far I can knit a blob.

56
0:04:07.285,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But, you know, it doesn't matter if I'm actually good at it. What matters is that my hands know how to do it.

57
0:04:11.928,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Because the more things that are familiar, the more things my hands know how to do,

58
0:04:15.417,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the more things that I can be happy and busy doing when my brain's not running the show anymore.

59
0:04:20.41,000 --> 0:04:24,000
They say that people who are engaged in activities are happier,

60
0:04:25.02,000 --> 0:04:29,000
easier for their caregivers to look after, and it may even slow the progress of the disease.

61
0:04:29.912,000 --> 0:04:31,000
That all seems like win to me.

62
0:04:32.424,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I want to be as happy as I can for as long as I can.

63
0:04:35.447,000 --> 0:04:39,000
A lot of people don't know that Alzheimer's actually has physical symptoms,

64
0:04:39.968,000 --> 0:04:43,000
as well as cognitive symptoms. You lose your sense of balance,

65
0:04:44.242,000 --> 0:04:49,000
you get muscle tremors, and that tends to lead people to being less and less mobile.

66
0:04:49.799,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They get scared to walk around. They get scared to move.

67
0:04:52.384,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So I'm doing activities that will build my sense of balance.

68
0:04:55.824,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I'm doing yoga and tai chi to improve my balance, so that when I start to lose it,

69
0:05:00.485,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I'll still be able to be mobile.

70
0:05:02.467,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I'm doing weight-bearing exercise, so that I have the muscle strength

71
0:05:06.409,000 --> 0:05:1,000
so that when I start to wither, I have more time that I can still move around.

72
0:05:10.538,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Finally, the third thing. I'm trying to become a better person.

73
0:05:16.139,000 --> 0:05:2,000
My dad was kind and loving before he had Alzheimer's, and he's kind and loving now.

74
0:05:20.906,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I've seen him lose his intellect, his sense of humor, his language skills,

75
0:05:25.786,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but I've also seen this: He loves me, he loves my sons,

76
0:05:30.266,000 --> 0:05:33,000
he loves my brother and my mom and his caregivers.

77
0:05:33.977,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And that love makes us want to be around him, even now.

78
0:05:38.682,000 --> 0:05:39,000
even when it's so hard.

79
0:05:40.066,000 --> 0:05:43,000
When you take away everything that he ever learned in this world,

80
0:05:43.369,000 --> 0:05:45,000
his naked heart still shines.

81
0:05:45.658,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I was never as kind as my dad, and I was never as loving.

82
0:05:49.577,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And what I need now is to learn to be like that.

83
0:05:52.625,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I need a heart so pure that if it's stripped bare by dementia, it will survive.

84
0:05:58.098,000 --> 0:06:,000
I don't want to get Alzheimer's disease.

85
0:06:00.617,000 --> 0:06:03,000
What I want is a cure in the next 20 years, soon enough to protect me.

86
0:06:04.481,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But if it comes for me, I'm going to be ready.

87
0:06:07.931,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Thank you.

88
0:06:09.681,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Applause)

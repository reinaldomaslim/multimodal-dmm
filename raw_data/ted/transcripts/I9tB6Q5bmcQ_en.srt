1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want you to take a trip with me.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Picture yourself driving

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
down a small road in Africa,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and as you drive along, you look off to the side,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and this is what you see:

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
you see a field of graves.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And you stop, and you get out of your car and you take a picture.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And you go into the town,

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and you inquire, "What's going on here?"

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and people are initially reluctant to tell you.

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And then someone says,

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
"These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community."

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
HIV isn't like other medical conditions;

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
it's stigmatizing.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
People are reluctant to talk about it --

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
there's a fear associated with it.

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I'm going to talk about HIV today,

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
about the deaths,

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
about the stigma.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It's a medical story, but more than that, it's a social story.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
This map depicts the global distribution of HIV.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And as you can see,

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
There are 33 million people

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
living with HIV in the world today.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Of these, two-thirds, 22 million

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
are living in sub-Saharan Africa.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
There are 1.4 million pregnant women

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in low- and middle-income countries living with HIV

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and of these, 90 percent

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
are in sub-Saharan Africa.

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We talk about things in relative terms.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I'm going to talk about annual pregnancies

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and HIV-positive mothers.

35
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The United States -- a large country --

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
each year, 7,000 mothers with HIV

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
who give birth to a child.

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But you go to Rwanda -- a very small country --

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
8,000 mothers with HIV who are pregnant.

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital,

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
outside of Johannesburg in South Africa,

42
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and 8,000 HIV-positive pregnant women

43
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
giving birth --

44
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
a hospital the same as a country.

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that when you compare

47
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
everything here to South Africa, it just pales,

48
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because in South Africa,

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
each year 300,000 mothers with HIV

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
give birth to children.

51
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So we talk about PMTCT,

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and we refer to PMTCT, prevention of mother to child transmission.

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I think there's an assumption amongst most people in the public

54
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that if a mother is HIV-positive,

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
she's going to infect her child.

56
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The reality is really, very different.

57
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In resource-rich countries,

58
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
with all the tests and treatment we currently have,

59
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
less than two percent of babies are born HIV-positive --

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
98 percent of babies are born HIV-negative.

61
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And yet, the reality in resource-poor countries,

62
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in the absence of tests and treatment,

63
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
40 percent -- 40 percent of children are infected --

64
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
40 percent versus two percent --

65
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
an enormous difference.

66
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So these programs --

67
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and I'm going to refer to PMTCT though my talk --

68
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
these prevention programs,

69
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
simply, they're the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers

70
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to prevent them from infecting their babies,

71
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and also the medicines we give to mothers

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children.

73
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So it's the test a mother gets when she comes in.

74
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's the drugs she receives

75
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to protect the baby that's inside the uterus and during delivery.

76
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's the guidance she gets around infant feeding

77
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and safer sex.

78
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
It's an entire package of services,

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and it works.

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So in the United States,

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s,

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
there's been an 80-percent decline

83
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
in the number of HIV-infected children.

84
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Less than 100 babies are born with HIV

85
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
each year in the United States

86
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and yet, still,

87
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
over 400,000 children

88
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
are born every year in the world today with HIV.

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
What does that mean?

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It means 1,100 children infected each day --

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
1,100 children each day, infected with HIV.

92
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And where do they come from?

93
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Well, less than one comes from the United States.

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
One, on average, comes from Europe.

95
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
100 come from Asia and the Pacific.

96
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And each day,

97
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
a thousand babies -- a thousand babies

98
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
are born each day with HIV in Africa.

99
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So again, I look at the globe here

100
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa.

101
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And let's look at another map.

102
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And here, again, we see

103
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors.

104
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
That thin sliver you see here, that's Africa.

105
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And it's the same with nurses.

106
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The truth is sub-Saharan Africa

107
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
has 24 percent

108
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
of the global disease burden

109
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and yet only three percent of the world's health care workers.

110
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
That means doctors and nurses

111
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
simply don't have the time to take care of patients.

112
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
A nurse in a busy clinic

113
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
will see 50 to 100 patients in a day,

114
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
which leaves her just minutes per patient --

115
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
minutes per patient.

116
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And so when we look at these PMTCT programs, what does it mean?

117
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Well, back in 2001,

118
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
when there was just a simple test

119
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and a single dose of a drug,

120
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
a nurse, in the course of her few minutes with a patient,

121
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
would have to counsel for the HIV test, perform the HIV test,

122
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
explain the results, dispense a single dose of the drug, Nevirapine,

123
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
explain how to take it, discuss infant feeding options, reinforce infant feeding,

124
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and test the baby -- in minutes.

125
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Well, fortunately since 2001,

126
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
we've got new treatments, new tests,

127
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and we're far more successful,

128
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
but we don't have any more nurses.

129
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And so these are the tests

130
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
a nurse now has to do

131
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
in those same few minutes.

132
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's not possible --

133
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
it doesn't work.

134
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And so we need to find

135
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
better ways of providing care.

136
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa --

137
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
mothers coming, pregnant and with their babies.

138
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
These women are here for care,

139
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but we know that just doing a test,

140
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
just giving someone a drug,

141
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it's not enough.

142
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Meds don't equal medical care.

143
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Doctors and nurses, frankly,

144
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
don't have the time or skills

145
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to tell people what to do in ways they understand.

146
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I'm a doctor -- I tell people things to do,

147
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and I expect them to follow my guidance --

148
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because I'm a doctor; I went to Harvard --

149
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but the reality is,

150
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
if I tell a patient, "You should have safer sex.

151
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
You should always use a condom,"

152
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and yet, in her relationship, she's not empowered --

153
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
what's going to happen?

154
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
If I tell her to take her medicines every day

155
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and yet, no one in the household knows about her illness, so

156
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
it's just not going to work.

157
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And so we need to do more,

158
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we need to do it differently,

159
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
we need to do it in ways that are affordable

160
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and accessible and can be taken to scale,

161
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which means it can be done everywhere.

162
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So, I want to tell you a story --

163
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I want to take you on a little trip.

164
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Imagine yourself, if you can,

165
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
you're a young woman in Africa, you're going to the hospital or clinic.

166
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
You go in for a test

167
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and you find out that you're pregnant, and you're delighted.

168
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And then they give you another test

169
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and they tell you you're HIV-positive, and you're devastated.

170
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And the nurse takes you into a room,

171
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and she tells you about the tests

172
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and HIV and the medicines you can take

173
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and how to take care of yourself and your baby,

174
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and you hear none of it.

175
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
All you're hearing is, "I'm going to die,

176
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and my baby is going to die."

177
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And then you're out on the street, and you don't know where to go.

178
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And you don't know who you can talk to,

179
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
because the truth is, HIV is so stigmatizing

180
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that if you partner, your family, anyone in your home,

181
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
you're likely to be thrown out

182
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
without any means of support.

183
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And this -- this is the face and story

184
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
of HIV in Africa today.

185
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But we're here to talk about possible solutions

186
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and some good news.

187
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And I want to change the story a little bit.

188
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Take the same mother, and the nurse, after she gives her her test,

189
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
takes her to a room.

190
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
The door opens and there's a room full of mothers, mothers with babies,

191
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and they're sitting, and they're talking, they're listening.

192
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
They're drinking tea, they're having sandwiches.

193
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And she goes inside, and woman comes up to her and says,

194
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"Welcome to mothers2mothers.

195
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Have a seat. You're safe here.

196
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
We're all HIV-positive.

197
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You're going to be okay. You're going to live.

198
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Your baby is going to be HIV-negative."

199
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
We view mothers

200
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
as a community's single greatest resource.

201
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Mothers take care of the children, take care of the home.

202
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So often the men are gone.

203
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
They're working, or they're not part of the household.

204
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Our organization, mothers2mothers,

205
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
enlists women with HIV

206
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
as care providers.

207
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We bring mothers who have HIV,

208
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
who've been through these PMTCT programs

209
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in the very facilities,

210
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses

211
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
as part of the health care team.

212
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
These mothers, we call them mentor mothers,

213
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
are able to engage women

214
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
who, just like themselves, pregnant with babies,

215
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
have found out about being HIV-positive,

216
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
who need support and education.

217
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And they support them around the diagnosis

218
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and educate them about how to take their medicines,

219
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
how to take care of themselves,

220
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
how to take care of their babies.

221
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Consider: if you needed surgery,

222
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
you would want the best possible technical surgeon, right?

223
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
But if you wanted to understand

224
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
what that surgery would do to your life,

225
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
you'd like to engage someone,

226
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
someone who's had the procedure.

227
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Patients are experts on their own experience,

228
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and they can share that experience with others.

229
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines.

230
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So the mothers who work for us,

231
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
they come from the communities in which they work.

232
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
They're hired -- they're paid as professional members of the health care teams,

233
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
just like doctors and nurses.

234
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And we open bank accounts for them

235
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and they're paid directly into the accounts,

236
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
because their money's protected;

237
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
the men can't take it away from them.

238
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
They go through two to three weeks

239
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
of rigorous curriculum-based education, training.

240
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Now, doctors and nurses -- they too get trained.

241
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But so often, they only get trained once,

242
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
so they're not aware of new medicines,

243
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
new guidelines as they come out.

244
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Our mentor mothers get trained every single year

245
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and retrained.

246
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And so doctors and nurses --

247
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
they look up to them as experts.

248
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Imagine that: a woman, a former patient,

249
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
being able to educate her doctor for the first time

250
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and educate the other patients

251
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that she's taking care of.

252
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Our organization has three goals.

253
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The first, to prevent mother-to-child transmission.

254
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
The second: keep mothers healthy, keep mothers alive,

255
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
keep the children alive --

256
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
no more orphans.

257
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And the third, and maybe the most grand,

258
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is to find ways to empower women,

259
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
enable them to fight the stigma

260
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and to live positive and productive lives with HIV.

261
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
So how do we do it?

262
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Well, maybe the most important engagement

263
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
is the one-to-one,

264
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
seeing patients one-to-one, educating them, supporting them,

265
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
explaining how they can take care of themselves.

266
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
We go beyond that;

267
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
we try to bring in the husbands, the partners.

268
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
In Africa, it's very, very hard to engage men.

269
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care.

270
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
But in Rwanda, in one country,

271
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
they've got a policy

272
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that a woman can't come for care

273
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
unless she brings the father of the baby with her --

274
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that's the rule.

275
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And so the father and the mother, together,

276
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
go through the counseling and the testing.

277
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The father and the mother, together, they get the results.

278
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma.

279
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Disclosure is so central to prevention.

280
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
How do you have safer sex, how do you use a condom regularly

281
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
if there hasn't been disclosure?

282
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Disclosure is so important to treatment,

283
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
because again, people need the support of family members and friends

284
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
to take their medicines regularly.

285
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We also work in groups.

286
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
Now the groups, it's not like me lecturing,

287
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
but what happens is women, they come together --

288
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers --

289
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
they come together, and they share their personal experiences.

290
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And it's through the sharing

291
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves,

292
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
how to disclose how to take medicines.

293
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And then there's the community outreach,

294
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
engaging women in their communities.

295
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
If we can change the way

296
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
households believe and think,

297
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
we can change the way communities believe and think.

298
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And if we can change enough communities,

299
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
we can change national attitudes.

300
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We can change national attitudes to women

301
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and national attitudes to HIV.

302
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction.

303
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
We have the medicines, we have the tests,

304
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
but how do you reduce the stigma?

305
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And it's important about disclosure.

306
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
So, a couple years ago, one of the mentor mothers came back,

307
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and she told me a story.

308
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
She had been asked by one of the clients

309
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
to go to the home of the client,

310
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters

311
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
about her HIV status,

312
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and she was afraid to go by herself.

313
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And so the mentor mother went along with.

314
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And the patient walked into the house

315
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
and said to her mother and siblings,

316
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
"I have something to tell you. I'm HIV-positive."

317
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And everybody was quiet.

318
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And then her oldest brother stood up and said,

319
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
"I too have something to tell you.

320
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I'm HIV-positive.

321
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I've been afraid to tell everybody."

322
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And then this older sister stood up and said,

323
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
"I too am living with the virus,

324
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and I've been ashamed."

325
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And then her younger brother stood up and said,

326
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
"I'm also positive.

327
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
I thought you were going to throw me out of the family."

328
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And you see where this is going.

329
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
The last sister stood up and said, "I'm also positive.

330
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I thought you were going to hate me."

331
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And there they were, all of them together for the first time

332
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
being able to share this experience for the first time

333
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
and to support each other for the first time.

334
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
(Video) Female Narrator: Women come to us,

335
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and they are crying and scared.

336
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
I tell them my story,

337
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
that I am HIV-positive,

338
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
but my child is HIV-negative.

339
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
I tell them, "You are going to make it,

340
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and you will raise a healthy baby."

341
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
I am proof that there is hope.

342
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Mitchell Besser: Remember the images I showed you

343
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa.

344
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And it is a crisis in health care systems.

345
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Even as we have more tests and more drugs,

346
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
we can't reach people; we don't have enough providers.

347
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting.

348
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Task-shifting is traditionally

349
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
when you take health care services from one provider

350
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and have another provider do it.

351
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Typically, it's a doctor giving a job to a nurse.

352
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And the issue in Africa

353
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
is that there are fewer nurses, really than doctors,

354
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and so we need to find new paradigm for health care.

355
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
How do you build a better health care system?

356
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
We've chosen to redefine the health care system

357
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
as a doctor, a nurse and a mentor mother.

358
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
And so what nurses do

359
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain

360
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
how to take the drugs, the side effects.

361
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
They delegate education about infant feeding,

362
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
family planning, safer sex,

363
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
actions that nurses simple just don't have time for.

364
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission.

365
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
The world is increasingly seeing these programs

366
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health.

367
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And our organization

368
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
helps women across that bridge.

369
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The care doesn't stop when the baby's born --

370
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby,

371
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
ensuring that they live healthy,

372
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
successful lives.

373
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Our organization works on three levels.

374
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
The first, at the patient level --

375
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV,

376
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
keeping mothers healthy to raise them.

377
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
The second, communities --

378
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
empowering women.

379
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
They become leaders within their communities.

380
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
They change the way communities think --

381
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
we need to change attitudes to HIV.

382
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
We need to change attitudes to women in Africa.

383
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
We have to do that.

384
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And then rework the level of the health care systems,

385
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
building stronger health care systems.

386
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Our health care systems are broken.

387
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
They're not going to work the way they're currently designed.

388
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And so doctors and nurses

389
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
who need to try to change people's behaviors

390
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
don't have the skills, don't have the time --

391
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
our mentor mothers do.

392
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in,

393
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
we can do that.

394
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
I started the program in Capetown, South Africa

395
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
back in 2001.

396
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
It was at that point, just the spark of an idea.

397
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Referencing Steven Johnson's very lovely speech yesterday

398
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
on where ideas come from,

399
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I was in the shower at the time --

400
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
I was alone.

401
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
(Laughter)

402
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
The program is now working in nine countries,

403
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
we have 670 program sites,

404
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
we're seeing about 230,000

405
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
women every month,

406
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
we're employing 1,600 mentor mothers,

407
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and last year, they enrolled

408
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
300,000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers.

409
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
That is 20 percent

410
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
of the global HIV-positive pregnant women --

411
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
20 percent of the world.

412
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
What's extraordinary is how simple the premise is.

413
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV.

414
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
Past patients taking care of present patients.

415
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
And empowerment through employment --

416
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
reducing stigma.

417
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
(Video) Female Narrator: There is hope,

418
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
hope that one day

419
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
we shall win this fight

420
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
against HIV and AIDS.

421
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Each person must know

422
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
their HIV status.

423
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Those who are HIV-negative

424
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
must know how to stay negative.

425
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Those who are HIV-infected

426
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
must know how

427
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
to take care of themselves.

428
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
HIV-positive pregnant women

429
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
must get PMTCT services

430
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
in order to have

431
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
HIV-negative babies.

432
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
All of this is possible,

433
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
if we each contribute to this fight.

434
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
MB: Simple solutions to complex problems.

435
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Mothers caring for mothers.

436
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
It's transformational.

437
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Thank you.

438
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:24,000
(Applause)

Food is design.

3
0:00:14.35,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It is design when you compose plates,

4
0:00:16.916,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but it is amazing, even better and most delightful design

5
0:00:21.457,000 --> 0:00:22,000
when it's about the units.

6
0:00:22.778,000 --> 0:00:23,000
[Small thing.]

7
0:00:23.979,000 --> 0:00:24,000
[Big idea.]

8
0:00:28.714,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"Pasta" comes from Latin,

9
0:00:30.314,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and it means "paste."

10
0:00:32.204,000 --> 0:00:35,000
It's about putting together water and some powder,

11
0:00:36.154,000 --> 0:00:38,000
so that you can actually shape it.

12
0:00:38.684,000 --> 0:00:41,000
There are cultures in the world that use rice powder,

13
0:00:41.724,000 --> 0:00:43,000
others use soy powder.

14
0:00:44.155,000 --> 0:00:46,000
In Italy, we tend to use durum wheat.

15
0:00:46.364,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Pasta existed for centuries,

16
0:00:48.234,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but it really blossomed during the Renaissance.

17
0:00:50.744,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And it's only later on in the 17th century

18
0:00:53.814,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that it became more mass produced.

19
0:00:56.046,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Whenever you design an object of any kind,

20
0:00:59.094,000 --> 0:01:01,000
you think of how you want it to perform.

21
0:01:01.244,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So think about the same for pasta.

22
0:01:03.944,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Do you want it to be ribbed

23
0:01:05.715,000 --> 0:01:06,000
or you want it to be smooth?

24
0:01:07.344,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The ribbed ones absorb the sauce better.

25
0:01:09.994,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Do you want them to be round

26
0:01:11.714,000 --> 0:01:12,000
or do you want them to be square?

27
0:01:13.314,000 --> 0:01:15,000
They have a different feel on the palate.

28
0:01:15.399,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Everything is for a reason.

29
0:01:17.454,000 --> 0:01:2,000
In the amazing taxonomy of the pasta species,

30
0:01:20.814,000 --> 0:01:22,000
there are many different ways to divide it,

31
0:01:22.838,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but one of the basic divisions is between fresh pasta and dry pasta.

32
0:01:27.744,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Dry pasta is always durum wheat flour and water.

33
0:01:31.944,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Fresh pasta could be either that

34
0:01:34.344,000 --> 0:01:36,000
or it could be flour and eggs.

35
0:01:37.034,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Just think of having a dough

36
0:01:39.264,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that you can shape in any way you want.

37
0:01:41.534,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I mean, really, wouldn't you go crazy?

38
0:01:43.944,000 --> 0:01:46,000
So fresh and dry, but then, there's also long and short.

39
0:01:47.414,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And then within those families, there's even more diversity.

40
0:01:51.334,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Let's talk about some really classical types of short pasta.

41
0:01:55.214,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Penne -- we all know them, right?

42
0:01:56.844,000 --> 0:01:58,000
They are cut at a slanted angle,

43
0:01:59.404,000 --> 0:02:01,000
perfect to pick up some of the sauce.

44
0:02:01.814,000 --> 0:02:04,000
"Farfalle" means "butterflies," or how do you call it here,

45
0:02:04.89,000 --> 0:02:08,000
bow ties, because they are, like, pinched in the middle.

46
0:02:08.994,000 --> 0:02:09,000
"Orecchiette" means "little ears,"

47
0:02:10.754,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and they're typical from Puglia, and they are delicious.

48
0:02:13.905,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And "conquilla," shells, and of course, they look like shells.

49
0:02:16.994,000 --> 0:02:19,000
They are ribbed, so they scoop up the sauce on the outside

50
0:02:20.374,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and they are smooth on the inside.

51
0:02:22.554,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Pasta is definitely gorgeous,

52
0:02:24.464,000 --> 0:02:27,000
but the form also is about how it touches the palate,

53
0:02:27.994,000 --> 0:02:28,000
how it touches the tongue,

54
0:02:29.295,000 --> 0:02:31,000
so it's never just about giving it a shape.

55
0:02:32.249,000 --> 0:02:37,000
When you hone one object across centuries,

56
0:02:37.664,000 --> 0:02:38,000
standards become really, really high.

57
0:02:39.654,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Many so-called great designers failed miserably,

58
0:02:43.124,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because they tried to impose a shape onto pasta.

59
0:02:47.734,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The great Philippe Starck tried mandala.

60
0:02:50.424,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Some parts of it, the walls, were very thick,

61
0:02:52.624,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and the others were thinner,

62
0:02:53.982,000 --> 0:02:54,000
so when you would boil the pasta,

63
0:02:55.644,000 --> 0:02:56,000
some of it would be completely mushy

64
0:02:57.383,000 --> 0:02:59,000
while part of it was too crunchy and uncooked.

65
0:02:59.804,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So really wrong, but they were not women from Bologna,

66
0:03:04.684,000 --> 0:03:07,000
they were not chefs from Naples,

67
0:03:07.764,000 --> 0:03:11,000
they were not centuries of families of grandmothers

68
0:03:12.194,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that were trying to improve on the thinness of the walls of the pasta.

69
0:03:18.541,000 --> 0:03:23,000
There's no way to trace pasta back to one designer, one inventor,

70
0:03:24.453,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and that's the beauty of it.

71
0:03:25.814,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It belongs to the people.

72
0:03:27.484,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And if you think about it,

73
0:03:28.771,000 --> 0:03:31,000
this simple mixture of a carbohydrate and water

74
0:03:31.834,000 --> 0:03:33,000
becomes the scaffold for a whole culture to be built.

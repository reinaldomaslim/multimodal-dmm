1
0:00:12.831,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The technology likely to have the greatest impact

2
0:00:16.301,000 --> 0:00:17,000
on the next few decades

3
0:00:18.071,000 --> 0:00:19,000
has arrived.

4
0:00:19.744,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And it's not social media.

5
0:00:22.265,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's not big data.

6
0:00:23.686,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's not robotics.

7
0:00:25.217,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's not even AI.

8
0:00:27.033,000 --> 0:00:29,000
You'll be surprised to learn

9
0:00:29.423,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that it's the underlying technology of digital currencies like Bitcoin.

10
0:00:34.159,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's called the blockchain. Blockchain.

11
0:00:38.337,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Now, it's not the most sonorous word in the world,

12
0:00:42.294,000 --> 0:00:44,000
but I believe that this is now

13
0:00:44.734,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the next generation of the internet,

14
0:00:47.299,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and that it holds vast promise for every business, every society

15
0:00:51.898,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and for all of you, individually.

16
0:00:54.367,000 --> 0:00:58,000
You know, for the past few decades, we've had the internet of information.

17
0:00:59.066,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And when I send you an email or a PowerPoint file or something,

18
0:01:03.311,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I'm actually not sending you the original,

19
0:01:05.409,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I'm sending you a copy.

20
0:01:07.222,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And that's great.

21
0:01:08.763,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This is democratized information.

22
0:01:12.441,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But when it comes to assets --

23
0:01:15.223,000 --> 0:01:17,000
things like money,

24
0:01:17.592,000 --> 0:01:19,000
financial assets like stocks and bonds,

25
0:01:20.071,000 --> 0:01:23,000
loyalty points, intellectual property,

26
0:01:23.53,000 --> 0:01:25,000
music, art, a vote,

27
0:01:26.982,000 --> 0:01:28,000
carbon credit and other assets --

28
0:01:29.611,000 --> 0:01:31,000
sending you a copy is a really bad idea.

29
0:01:32.247,000 --> 0:01:33,000
If I send you 100 dollars,

30
0:01:34.066,000 --> 0:01:37,000
it's really important that I don't still have the money --

31
0:01:37.127,000 --> 0:01:38,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:38.158,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and that I can't send it to you.

33
0:01:40.54,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This has been called the "double-spend" problem

34
0:01:42.901,000 --> 0:01:44,000
by cryptographers for a long time.

35
0:01:45.469,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So today, we rely entirely on big intermediaries --

36
0:01:50.762,000 --> 0:01:52,000
middlemen like banks, government,

37
0:01:53.039,000 --> 0:01:56,000
big social media companies, credit card companies and so on --

38
0:01:56.627,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to establish trust in our economy.

39
0:01:59.779,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And these intermediaries perform all the business and transaction logic

40
0:02:04.897,000 --> 0:02:05,000
of every kind of commerce,

41
0:02:06.317,000 --> 0:02:08,000
from authentication, identification of people,

42
0:02:09.002,000 --> 0:02:13,000
through to clearing, settling and record keeping.

43
0:02:13.583,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And overall, they do a pretty good job.

44
0:02:15.528,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But there are growing problems.

45
0:02:17.942,000 --> 0:02:18,000
To begin, they're centralized.

46
0:02:19.498,000 --> 0:02:21,000
That means they can be hacked, and increasingly are --

47
0:02:22.49,000 --> 0:02:24,000
JP Morgan, the US Federal Government,

48
0:02:25.073,000 --> 0:02:26,000
LinkedIn, Home Depot and others

49
0:02:26.888,000 --> 0:02:27,000
found that out the hard way.

50
0:02:28.874,000 --> 0:02:31,000
They exclude billions of people from the global economy,

51
0:02:32.412,000 --> 0:02:34,000
for example, people who don't have enough money

52
0:02:34.689,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to have a bank account.

53
0:02:36.624,000 --> 0:02:38,000
They slow things down.

54
0:02:38.936,000 --> 0:02:41,000
It can take a second for an email to go around the world,

55
0:02:42.53,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but it can take days or weeks

56
0:02:44.978,000 --> 0:02:47,000
for money to move through the banking system across a city.

57
0:02:48.134,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And they take a big piece of the action --

58
0:02:50.357,000 --> 0:02:53,000
10 to 20 percent just to send money to another country.

59
0:02:54.022,000 --> 0:02:55,000
They capture our data,

60
0:02:55.687,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and that means we can't monetize it

61
0:02:57.663,000 --> 0:02:59,000
or use it to better manage our lives.

62
0:03:00.441,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Our privacy is being undermined.

63
0:03:03.202,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And the biggest problem is that overall,

64
0:03:06.005,000 --> 0:03:11,000
they've appropriated the largesse of the digital age asymmetrically:

65
0:03:11.91,000 --> 0:03:15,000
we have wealth creation, but we have growing social inequality.

66
0:03:17.105,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So what if there were not only an internet of information,

67
0:03:21.471,000 --> 0:03:23,000
what if there were an internet of value --

68
0:03:24.517,000 --> 0:03:28,000
some kind of vast, global, distributed ledger

69
0:03:28.669,000 --> 0:03:3,000
running on millions of computers

70
0:03:30.831,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and available to everybody.

71
0:03:32.939,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And where every kind of asset, from money to music,

72
0:03:36.814,000 --> 0:03:41,000
could be stored, moved, transacted, exchanged and managed,

73
0:03:42.542,000 --> 0:03:44,000
all without powerful intermediaries?

74
0:03:45.507,000 --> 0:03:48,000
What if there were a native medium for value?

75
0:03:50.256,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Well, in 2008, the financial industry crashed

76
0:03:54.938,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and, perhaps propitiously,

77
0:03:57.546,000 --> 0:04:01,000
an anonymous person or persons named Satoshi Nakamoto

78
0:04:03.325,000 --> 0:04:09,000
created a paper where he developed a protocol for a digital cash

79
0:04:10.335,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that used an underlying cryptocurrency called Bitcoin.

80
0:04:14.421,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And this cryptocurrency enabled people to establish trust and do transactions

81
0:04:20.263,000 --> 0:04:21,000
without a third party.

82
0:04:21.978,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And this seemingly simple act set off a spark

83
0:04:25.738,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that ignited the world,

84
0:04:27.909,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that has everyone excited or terrified or otherwise interested

85
0:04:33.076,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in many places.

86
0:04:34.64,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Now, don't be confused about Bitcoin --

87
0:04:36.734,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Bitcoin is an asset; it goes up and down,

88
0:04:39.933,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and that should be of interest to you if you're a speculator.

89
0:04:43.525,000 --> 0:04:45,000
More broadly, it's a cryptocurrency.

90
0:04:45.954,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It's not a fiat currency controlled by a nation-state.

91
0:04:49.327,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And that's of greater interest.

92
0:04:51.412,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But the real pony here is the underlying technology.

93
0:04:54.65,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It's called blockchain.

94
0:04:57.649,000 --> 0:05:,000
So for the first time now in human history,

95
0:05:01.116,000 --> 0:05:03,000
people everywhere can trust each other

96
0:05:03.618,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and transact peer to peer.

97
0:05:07.001,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And trust is established, not by some big institution,

98
0:05:11.265,000 --> 0:05:14,000
but by collaboration, by cryptography

99
0:05:14.345,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and by some clever code.

100
0:05:16.502,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And because trust is native to the technology,

101
0:05:20.08,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I call this, "The Trust Protocol."

102
0:05:22.896,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now, you're probably wondering: How does this thing work?

103
0:05:25.674,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Fair enough.

104
0:05:28.29,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Assets -- digital assets like money to music and everything in between --

105
0:05:33.469,000 --> 0:05:34,000
are not stored in a central place,

106
0:05:35.159,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but they're distributed across a global ledger,

107
0:05:37.879,000 --> 0:05:39,000
using the highest level of cryptography.

108
0:05:40.945,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And when a transaction is conducted,

109
0:05:43.612,000 --> 0:05:45,000
it's posted globally,

110
0:05:45.714,000 --> 0:05:48,000
across millions and millions of computers.

111
0:05:49.508,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And out there, around the world,

112
0:05:51.376,000 --> 0:05:53,000
is a group of people called "miners."

113
0:05:53.694,000 --> 0:05:56,000
These are not young people, they're Bitcoin miners.

114
0:05:57.21,000 --> 0:06:,000
They have massive computing power at their fingertips --

115
0:06:00.241,000 --> 0:06:04,000
10 to 100 times bigger than all of Google worldwide.

116
0:06:05.598,000 --> 0:06:06,000
These miners do a lot of work.

117
0:06:08.122,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And every 10 minutes,

118
0:06:09.519,000 --> 0:06:11,000
kind of like the heartbeat of a network,

119
0:06:11.83,000 --> 0:06:13,000
a block gets created

120
0:06:14.059,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that has all the transactions from the previous 10 minutes.

121
0:06:17.714,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Then the miners get to work, trying to solve some tough problems.

122
0:06:22.873,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And they compete:

123
0:06:24.219,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the first miner to find out the truth and to validate the block,

124
0:06:28.554,000 --> 0:06:3,000
is rewarded in digital currency,

125
0:06:30.939,000 --> 0:06:32,000
in the case of the Bitcoin blockchain, with Bitcoin.

126
0:06:34.171,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And then -- this is the key part --

127
0:06:36.355,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that block is linked to the previous block

128
0:06:38.836,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and the previous block

129
0:06:40.169,000 --> 0:06:43,000
to create a chain of blocks.

130
0:06:43.441,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And every one is time-stamped,

131
0:06:44.904,000 --> 0:06:46,000
kind of like with a digital waxed seal.

132
0:06:47.434,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So if I wanted to go and hack a block

133
0:06:49.805,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and, say, pay you and you with the same money,

134
0:06:54.394,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I'd have to hack that block,

135
0:06:55.941,000 --> 0:06:56,000
plus all the preceding blocks,

136
0:06:57.395,000 --> 0:07:,000
the entire history of commerce on that blockchain,

137
0:07:00.813,000 --> 0:07:03,000
not just on one computer but across millions of computers,

138
0:07:04.328,000 --> 0:07:05,000
simultaneously,

139
0:07:06.131,000 --> 0:07:09,000
all using the highest levels of encryption,

140
0:07:09.49,000 --> 0:07:12,000
in the light of the most powerful computing resource in the world

141
0:07:12.604,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that's watching me.

142
0:07:13.876,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Tough to do.

143
0:07:15.51,000 --> 0:07:17,000
This is infinitely more secure

144
0:07:17.736,000 --> 0:07:19,000
than the computer systems that we have today.

145
0:07:20.119,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Blockchain. That's how it works.

146
0:07:23.402,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So the Bitcoin blockchain is just one.

147
0:07:25.607,000 --> 0:07:26,000
There are many.

148
0:07:26.782,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The Ethereum blockchain was developed by a Canadian named Vitalik Buterin.

149
0:07:31.7,000 --> 0:07:33,000
He's [22] years old,

150
0:07:33.954,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and this blockchain has some extraordinary capabilities.

151
0:07:38.196,000 --> 0:07:41,000
One of them is that you can build smart contracts.

152
0:07:41.303,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It's kind of what it sounds like.

153
0:07:43.295,000 --> 0:07:45,000
It's a contract that self-executes,

154
0:07:45.882,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and the contract handles the enforcement, the management, performance

155
0:07:50.773,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and payment -- the contract kind of has a bank account, too, in a sense --

156
0:07:55.058,000 --> 0:07:57,000
of agreements between people.

157
0:07:57.718,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And today, on the Ethereum blockchain,

158
0:08:00.456,000 --> 0:08:02,000
there are projects underway to do everything

159
0:08:02.767,000 --> 0:08:05,000
from create a new replacement for the stock market

160
0:08:05.953,000 --> 0:08:06,000
to create a new model of democracy,

161
0:08:07.8,000 --> 0:08:1,000
where politicians are accountable to citizens.

162
0:08:10.927,000 --> 0:08:13,000
(Applause)

163
0:08:14.411,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So to understand what a radical change this is going to bring,

164
0:08:18.514,000 --> 0:08:2,000
let's look at one industry, financial services.

165
0:08:21.249,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Recognize this?

166
0:08:23.061,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Rube Goldberg machine.

167
0:08:25,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It's a ridiculously complicated machine that does something really simple,

168
0:08:28.705,000 --> 0:08:3,000
like crack an egg or shut a door.

169
0:08:31.593,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Well, it kind of reminds me of the financial services industry,

170
0:08:35.449,000 --> 0:08:36,000
honestly.

171
0:08:36.639,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I mean, you tap your card in the corner store,

172
0:08:39.568,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and a bitstream goes through a dozen companies,

173
0:08:42.843,000 --> 0:08:44,000
each with their own computer system,

174
0:08:45.23,000 --> 0:08:47,000
some of them being 1970s mainframes

175
0:08:47.559,000 --> 0:08:49,000
older than many of the people in this room,

176
0:08:50.375,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and three days later, a settlement occurs.

177
0:08:53.74,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Well, with a blockchain financial industry,

178
0:08:57.288,000 --> 0:08:58,000
there would be no settlement,

179
0:08:58.715,000 --> 0:09:,000
because the payment and the settlement is the same activity,

180
0:09:01.597,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it's just a change in the ledger.

181
0:09:04.04,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So Wall Street and all around the world,

182
0:09:06.324,000 --> 0:09:09,000
the financial industry is in a big upheaval about this,

183
0:09:09.611,000 --> 0:09:11,000
wondering, can we be replaced,

184
0:09:11.786,000 --> 0:09:13,000
or how do we embrace this technology for success?

185
0:09:15.349,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Now, why should you care?

186
0:09:18.32,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Well, let me describe some applications.

187
0:09:21.748,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Prosperity.

188
0:09:23.44,000 --> 0:09:25,000
The first era of the internet,

189
0:09:25.472,000 --> 0:09:26,000
the internet of information,

190
0:09:26.837,000 --> 0:09:29,000
brought us wealth but not shared prosperity,

191
0:09:30.324,000 --> 0:09:32,000
because social inequality is growing.

192
0:09:32.802,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And this is at the heart of all of the anger and extremism

193
0:09:36.809,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and protectionism and xenophobia and worse

194
0:09:40.433,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that we're seeing growing in the world today,

195
0:09:43.039,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Brexit being the most recent case.

196
0:09:46.868,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So could we develop some new approaches to this problem of inequality?

197
0:09:52.635,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Because the only approach today is to redistribute wealth,

198
0:09:56.408,000 --> 0:09:58,000
tax people and spread it around more.

199
0:09:58.612,000 --> 0:10:,000
Could we pre-distribute wealth?

200
0:10:01.686,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Could we change the way that wealth gets created in the first place

201
0:10:04.906,000 --> 0:10:06,000
by democratizing wealth creation,

202
0:10:07.1,000 --> 0:10:09,000
engaging more people in the economy,

203
0:10:09.517,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and then ensuring that they got fair compensation?

204
0:10:13.158,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Let me describe five ways that this can be done.

205
0:10:16.597,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Number one:

206
0:10:18.047,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Did you know that 70 percent of the people in the world who have land

207
0:10:23.3,000 --> 0:10:25,000
have a tenuous title to it?

208
0:10:25.863,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So, you've got a little farm in Honduras, some dictator comes to power,

209
0:10:29.279,000 --> 0:10:32,000
he says, "I know you've got a piece of paper that says you own your farm,

210
0:10:32.895,000 --> 0:10:35,000
but the government computer says my friend owns your farm."

211
0:10:36.967,000 --> 0:10:38,000
This happened on a mass scale in Honduras,

212
0:10:39.169,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and this problem exists everywhere.

213
0:10:42.214,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Hernando de Soto, the great Latin American economist,

214
0:10:45.013,000 --> 0:10:47,000
says this is the number one issue in the world

215
0:10:47.181,000 --> 0:10:48,000
in terms of economic mobility,

216
0:10:48.799,000 --> 0:10:5,000
more important than having a bank account,

217
0:10:50.964,000 --> 0:10:52,000
because if you don't have a valid title to your land,

218
0:10:53.621,000 --> 0:10:54,000
you can't borrow against it,

219
0:10:55.201,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and you can't plan for the future.

220
0:10:57.969,000 --> 0:11:,000
So today, companies are working with governments

221
0:11:01.333,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to put land titles on a blockchain.

222
0:11:03.8,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And once it's there, this is immutable.

223
0:11:06.718,000 --> 0:11:07,000
You can't hack it.

224
0:11:08.313,000 --> 0:11:11,000
This creates the conditions for prosperity

225
0:11:11.492,000 --> 0:11:13,000
for potentially billions of people.

226
0:11:14.505,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Secondly:

227
0:11:16.295,000 --> 0:11:18,000
a lot of writers talk about Uber

228
0:11:18.553,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and Airbnb and TaskRabbit and Lyft and so on

229
0:11:21.912,000 --> 0:11:23,000
as part of the sharing economy.

230
0:11:24.232,000 --> 0:11:25,000
This is a very powerful idea,

231
0:11:25.92,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that peers can come together and create and share wealth.

232
0:11:29.71,000 --> 0:11:3,000
My view is that ...

233
0:11:31.729,000 --> 0:11:34,000
these companies are not really sharing.

234
0:11:35.748,000 --> 0:11:39,000
In fact, they're successful precisely because they don't share.

235
0:11:39.879,000 --> 0:11:42,000
They aggregate services together, and they sell them.

236
0:11:43.71,000 --> 0:11:47,000
What if, rather than Airbnb being a $25 billion corporation,

237
0:11:48.666,000 --> 0:11:53,000
there was a distributed application on a blockchain, we'll call it B-Airbnb,

238
0:11:54.196,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and it was essentially owned by all of the people

239
0:11:58.254,000 --> 0:11:59,000
who have a room to rent.

240
0:12:00.574,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And when someone wants to rent a room,

241
0:12:03.169,000 --> 0:12:07,000
they go onto the blockchain database and all the criteria,

242
0:12:07.335,000 --> 0:12:09,000
they sift through, it helps them find the right room,

243
0:12:09.866,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and then the blockchain helps with the contracting,

244
0:12:12.659,000 --> 0:12:13,000
it identifies the party,

245
0:12:14.555,000 --> 0:12:15,000
it handles the payments

246
0:12:15.937,000 --> 0:12:18,000
just through digital payments -- they're built into the system.

247
0:12:19.207,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And it even handles reputation,

248
0:12:20.762,000 --> 0:12:24,000
because if she rates a room as a five-star room,

249
0:12:24.978,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that room is there,

250
0:12:26.218,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and it's rated, and it's immutable.

251
0:12:29.043,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So, the big sharing-economy disruptors in Silicon Valley

252
0:12:34.542,000 --> 0:12:35,000
could be disrupted,

253
0:12:36.096,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and this would be good for prosperity.

254
0:12:38.361,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Number three:

255
0:12:40.403,000 --> 0:12:42,000
the biggest flow of funds from the developed world

256
0:12:42.998,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to the developing world

257
0:12:44.308,000 --> 0:12:46,000
is not corporate investment,

258
0:12:46.594,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and it's not even foreign aid.

259
0:12:49.605,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It's remittances.

260
0:12:52.329,000 --> 0:12:53,000
This is the global diaspora;

261
0:12:54.288,000 --> 0:12:56,000
people have left their ancestral lands,

262
0:12:56.669,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and they're sending money back to their families at home.

263
0:13:00.582,000 --> 0:13:03,000
This is 600 billion dollars a year, and it's growing,

264
0:13:03.729,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and these people are getting ripped off.

265
0:13:06.555,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Analie Domingo is a housekeeper.

266
0:13:09.864,000 --> 0:13:1,000
She lives in Toronto,

267
0:13:11.793,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and every month she goes to the Western Union office

268
0:13:16.581,000 --> 0:13:17,000
with some cash

269
0:13:18.144,000 --> 0:13:2,000
to send her remittances to her mom in Manila.

270
0:13:21.835,000 --> 0:13:22,000
It costs her around 10 percent;

271
0:13:23.752,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the money takes four to seven days to get there;

272
0:13:26.016,000 --> 0:13:28,000
her mom never knows when it's going to arrive.

273
0:13:28.204,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It takes five hours out of her week to do this.

274
0:13:31.571,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Six months ago,

275
0:13:32.747,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Analie Domingo used a blockchain application called Abra.

276
0:13:37.771,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And from her mobile device, she sent 300 bucks.

277
0:13:40.408,000 --> 0:13:42,000
It went directly to her mom's mobile device

278
0:13:42.912,000 --> 0:13:43,000
without going through an intermediary.

279
0:13:45.346,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And then her mom looked at her mobile device --

280
0:13:47.762,000 --> 0:13:5,000
it's kind of like an Uber interface, there's Abra "tellers" moving around.

281
0:13:51.575,000 --> 0:13:53,000
She clicks on a teller that's a five-star teller,

282
0:13:54.337,000 --> 0:13:55,000
who's seven minutes away.

283
0:13:56.266,000 --> 0:13:59,000
The guy shows up at the door, gives her Filipino pesos,

284
0:13:59.37,000 --> 0:14:,000
she puts them in her wallet.

285
0:14:01.365,000 --> 0:14:02,000
The whole thing took minutes,

286
0:14:03.145,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and it cost her two percent.

287
0:14:06.269,000 --> 0:14:08,000
This is a big opportunity for prosperity.

288
0:14:09.637,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Number four: the most powerful asset of the digital age is data.

289
0:14:14.279,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And data is really a new asset class,

290
0:14:17.966,000 --> 0:14:19,000
maybe bigger than previous asset classes,

291
0:14:20.269,000 --> 0:14:22,000
like land under the agrarian economy,

292
0:14:23.254,000 --> 0:14:24,000
or an industrial plant,

293
0:14:24.931,000 --> 0:14:25,000
or even money.

294
0:14:26.54,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And all of you -- we -- create this data.

295
0:14:29.574,000 --> 0:14:3,000
We create this asset,

296
0:14:31.38,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and we leave this trail of digital crumbs behind us

297
0:14:34.119,000 --> 0:14:35,000
as we go throughout life.

298
0:14:35.973,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And these crumbs are collected into a mirror image of you,

299
0:14:38.817,000 --> 0:14:39,000
the virtual you.

300
0:14:40.481,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And the virtual you may know more about you than you do,

301
0:14:43.176,000 --> 0:14:45,000
because you can't remember what you bought a year ago,

302
0:14:45.831,000 --> 0:14:47,000
or said a year ago, or your exact location a year ago.

303
0:14:48.494,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And the virtual you is not owned by you --

304
0:14:51.295,000 --> 0:14:52,000
that's the big problem.

305
0:14:53.419,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So today, there are companies working

306
0:14:56.021,000 --> 0:14:59,000
to create an identity in a black box,

307
0:14:59.682,000 --> 0:15:,000
the virtual you owned by you.

308
0:15:01.853,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And this black box moves around with you

309
0:15:05.182,000 --> 0:15:06,000
as you travel throughout the world,

310
0:15:07.196,000 --> 0:15:09,000
and it's very, very stingy.

311
0:15:09.29,000 --> 0:15:12,000
It only gives away the shred of information

312
0:15:12.369,000 --> 0:15:13,000
that's required to do something.

313
0:15:13.94,000 --> 0:15:14,000
A lot of transactions,

314
0:15:15.253,000 --> 0:15:17,000
the seller doesn't even need to know who you are.

315
0:15:17.75,000 --> 0:15:19,000
They just need to know that they got paid.

316
0:15:20.741,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And then this avatar is sweeping up all of this data

317
0:15:24.714,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and enabling you to monetize it.

318
0:15:28.061,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And this is a wonderful thing,

319
0:15:29.873,000 --> 0:15:32,000
because it can also help us protect our privacy,

320
0:15:33.088,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and privacy is the foundation of a free society.

321
0:15:36.924,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Let's get this asset that we create

322
0:15:38.914,000 --> 0:15:39,000
back under our control,

323
0:15:40.715,000 --> 0:15:42,000
where we can own our own identity

324
0:15:42.747,000 --> 0:15:43,000
and manage it responsibly.

325
0:15:45.817,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Finally --

326
0:15:46.998,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Applause)

327
0:15:52.335,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Finally, number five:

328
0:15:53.855,000 --> 0:15:56,000
there are a whole number of creators of content

329
0:15:57.141,000 --> 0:15:59,000
who don't receive fair compensation,

330
0:15:59.372,000 --> 0:16:02,000
because the system for intellectual property is broken.

331
0:16:02.488,000 --> 0:16:05,000
It was broken by the first era of the internet.

332
0:16:05.624,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Take music.

333
0:16:07.734,000 --> 0:16:1,000
Musicians are left with crumbs at the end of the whole food chain.

334
0:16:10.888,000 --> 0:16:14,000
You know, if you were a songwriter, 25 years ago, you wrote a hit song,

335
0:16:15.752,000 --> 0:16:17,000
it got a million singles,

336
0:16:18.038,000 --> 0:16:21,000
you could get royalties of around 45,000 dollars.

337
0:16:21.583,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Today, you're a songwriter, you write a hit song,

338
0:16:23.923,000 --> 0:16:24,000
it gets a million streams,

339
0:16:25.4,000 --> 0:16:26,000
you don't get 45k,

340
0:16:27.194,000 --> 0:16:29,000
you get 36 dollars,

341
0:16:29.805,000 --> 0:16:3,000
enough to buy a nice pizza.

342
0:16:32.721,000 --> 0:16:33,000
So Imogen Heap,

343
0:16:34.123,000 --> 0:16:36,000
the Grammy-winning singer-songwriter,

344
0:16:36.531,000 --> 0:16:39,000
is now putting music on a blockchain ecosystem.

345
0:16:40.526,000 --> 0:16:41,000
She calls it "Mycelia."

346
0:16:42.399,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And the music has a smart contract surrounding it.

347
0:16:46.529,000 --> 0:16:49,000
And the music protects her intellectual property rights.

348
0:16:50.076,000 --> 0:16:51,000
You want to listen to the song?

349
0:16:51.613,000 --> 0:16:54,000
It's free, or maybe a few micro-cents that flow into a digital account.

350
0:16:54.994,000 --> 0:16:56,000
You want to put the song in your movie, that's different,

351
0:16:57.716,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and the IP rights are all specified.

352
0:16:59.499,000 --> 0:17:01,000
You want to make a ringtone? That's different.

353
0:17:02.23,000 --> 0:17:05,000
She describes that the song becomes a business.

354
0:17:05.463,000 --> 0:17:07,000
It's out there on this platform marketing itself,

355
0:17:08.296,000 --> 0:17:09,000
protecting the rights of the author,

356
0:17:10.287,000 --> 0:17:12,000
and because the song has a payment system

357
0:17:12.466,000 --> 0:17:13,000
in the sense of bank account,

358
0:17:13.952,000 --> 0:17:15,000
all the money flows back to the artist,

359
0:17:16.324,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and they control the industry,

360
0:17:18.583,000 --> 0:17:2,000
rather than these powerful intermediaries.

361
0:17:21.757,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Now, this is --

362
0:17:22.932,000 --> 0:17:26,000
(Applause)

363
0:17:27.604,000 --> 0:17:28,000
This is not just songwriters,

364
0:17:29.325,000 --> 0:17:3,000
it's any creator of content,

365
0:17:30.848,000 --> 0:17:31,000
like art,

366
0:17:32.339,000 --> 0:17:34,000
like inventions,

367
0:17:34.831,000 --> 0:17:36,000
scientific discoveries, journalists.

368
0:17:37.816,000 --> 0:17:4,000
There are all kinds of people who don't get fair compensation,

369
0:17:40.853,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and with blockchains,

370
0:17:42.347,000 --> 0:17:45,000
they're going to be able to make it rain on the blockchain.

371
0:17:46.133,000 --> 0:17:47,000
And that's a wonderful thing.

372
0:17:48.775,000 --> 0:17:52,000
So, these are five opportunities

373
0:17:53.392,000 --> 0:17:54,000
out of a dozen

374
0:17:54.69,000 --> 0:17:56,000
to solve one problem, prosperity,

375
0:17:57.015,000 --> 0:18:,000
which is one of countless problems

376
0:18:00.087,000 --> 0:18:02,000
that blockchains are applicable to.

377
0:18:03.036,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Now, technology doesn't create prosperity, of course -- people do.

378
0:18:07.507,000 --> 0:18:1,000
But my case to you is that, once again,

379
0:18:11.905,000 --> 0:18:14,000
the technology genie has escaped from the bottle,

380
0:18:15.366,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and it was summoned by an unknown person or persons

381
0:18:18.602,000 --> 0:18:2,000
at this uncertain time in human history,

382
0:18:22.216,000 --> 0:18:25,000
and it's giving us another kick at the can,

383
0:18:25.511,000 --> 0:18:3,000
another opportunity to rewrite the economic power grid

384
0:18:30.652,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and the old order of things,

385
0:18:32.4,000 --> 0:18:36,000
and solve some of the world's most difficult problems,

386
0:18:37.272,000 --> 0:18:38,000
if we will it.

387
0:18:39.915,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Thank you.

388
0:18:41.131,000 --> 0:18:46,000
(Applause)

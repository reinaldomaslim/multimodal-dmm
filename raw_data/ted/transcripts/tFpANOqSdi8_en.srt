1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I had requested slides,

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
kind of adamantly,

3
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
up till the -- pretty much, last few days,

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
but was denied access to a slide projector.

5
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:34.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I actually find them a lot more emotional --

7
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
-- and personal,

9
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and the neat thing about a slide projector

10
0:00:44.33,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is you can actually focus the work,

11
0:00:47.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
unlike PowerPoint and some other programs.

12
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Now, I agree that

13
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
you have to -- yeah, there are certain concessions

14
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
and, you know, if you use a slide projector,

15
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:03,000
you're not able to have the bad type

16
0:01:03.33,000 --> 0:01:06,000
swing in from the back or the side, or up or down,

17
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but maybe that's an O.K. trade-off,

18
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to trade that off for a focus.

19
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It's a thought. Just a thought.

21
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And there's something nice about slides getting stuck.

22
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And the thing you really hope for

23
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
is occasionally they burn up,

24
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
which we won't see tonight. So.

25
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:33,000
With that, let's get the first slide up here.

26
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
This, as many of you have probably guessed,

27
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is a

28
0:01:38.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
recently emptied beer can in Portugal.

29
0:01:41.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:48,000
This -- I had just arrived in Barcelona for the first time,

31
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and I thought --

32
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
you know, fly all night, I looked up,

33
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and I thought, wow, how clean.

34
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
You come into this major airport, and they simply have a B.

35
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I mean, how nice is that?

36
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Everything's gotten simpler in design,

37
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and here's this mega airport,

38
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and God, I just -- I took a picture.

39
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I thought, God, that is the coolest thing I've ever seen at an airport.

40
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Till a couple months later,

41
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I went back to the same airport --

42
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
same plane, I think -- and looked up,

43
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and it said C.

44
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
It was only then that I realized

46
0:02:27.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
it was simply a gate that I was coming into.

47
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I'm a big believer in the emotion of design,

49
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and the message that's sent

50
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
before somebody begins to read,

51
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
before they get the rest of the information;

52
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:46,000
what is the emotional response they get to the product,

53
0:02:46.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to the story, to the painting -- whatever it is.

54
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
That area of design interests me the most,

55
0:02:52.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and I think this for me is a real clear,

56
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
very simplified version

57
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
of what I'm talking about.

58
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
These are a couple of garage doors painted identical,

59
0:03:01.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
situated next to each other.

60
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So, here's the first door. You know, you get the message.

61
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
You know, it's pretty clear.

62
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Take a look at the second door and see

63
0:03:12.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
if there's any different message.

64
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
O.K., which one would you park in front of?

65
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Same color, same message, same words.

67
0:03:20.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The only thing that's different

68
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece --

69
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and, again,

70
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:3,000
which is the psycho-killer here?

71
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Yet it doesn't say that; it doesn't need to say that.

73
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I would probably park in front of the other one.

74
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I'm sure a lot of you are aware

75
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last

76
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:47,000
five years or so.

77
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's gotten so simple that it's already starting to kind of

78
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
come back the other way again and get a little more expressive.

79
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But I was in Milan and saw this street sign,

80
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and was very happy to

81
0:03:56.33,000 --> 0:03:58,000
see that apparently this idea of minimalism

82
0:03:58.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
has even been translated by the graffiti artist.

83
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And this graffiti artist has come along,

85
0:04:07.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
made this sign a little bit better, and then moved on.

86
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
He didn't overpower it like they have a tendency to do.

88
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
This is for a book by "Metropolis."

90
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I took some photos, and this is

91
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
a billboard in Florida,

92
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and either they hadn't paid their rent,

93
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
or they didn't want to pay their rent again on the sign,

94
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down,

95
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
so they just teared out sections of it.

96
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And I would argue that it's possibly more effective

97
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:4,000
than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention,

98
0:04:40.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
getting you to look over that way.

99
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And hopefully you don't stop and buy those awful pecan things -- Stuckey's.

100
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
This is from my second book.

101
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The first book is called, "The End of Print,"

102
0:04:53.33,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and it was done along with a film,

103
0:04:55.33,000 --> 0:04:57,000
working with William Burroughs.

104
0:04:57.33,000 --> 0:05:,000
And "The End of Print" is now in its fifth printing.

105
0:05:00.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:08,000
When I first contacted William Burroughs about being part of it,

107
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
he said no; he said he didn't believe it was the end of print.

108
0:05:12.33,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And I said, well, that's fine;

109
0:05:14.33,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I just would love to have your input on this film and this book,

110
0:05:17.33,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and he finally agreed to it.

111
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And at the end of the film, he says in this great voice

112
0:05:23.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that I can't mimic but I'll kind of try, but not really, he says,

113
0:05:26.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
"I remember attending an exhibition called,

114
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
'Photography: The End of Painting.'"

115
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And then he says, "And, of course, it wasn't at all."

116
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So, apparently when photography was perfected,

117
0:05:39.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
there were people going around saying,

118
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that's it: you've just ruined painting.

119
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:47,000
People are just going to take pictures now.

120
0:05:47.33,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And of course, that wasn't the case.

121
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So, this is from "2nd Sight,"

122
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a book I did on intuition.

123
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I think it's not the only ingredient in design,

124
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but possibly the most important.

125
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
It's something everybody has.

126
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:02,000
It's not a matter of teaching it;

127
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
in fact, most of the schools tend to discount intuition

128
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
as an ingredient of your working process

129
0:06:07.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
because they can't quantify it:

130
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
it's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design,

131
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card

132
0:06:16.33,000 --> 0:06:18,000
or a newsletter.

133
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So it tends to get discounted.

134
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This is a quote from Albert Einstein, who says,

135
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
"The intellect has little to do on the road to discovery.

136
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
There comes a leap in consciousness --

137
0:06:30.33,000 --> 0:06:33,000
call it intuition or what you will --

138
0:06:33.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and the solution just comes to you, and you don't know from where or why."

139
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So, it's kind of like when somebody says, Who did that song?

140
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And the more you try to think about it,

141
0:06:41.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the further the answer gets from you,

142
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and the minute you stop thinking about it,

143
0:06:45.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
your intuition gives you that answer, in a sense.

144
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I like this for a couple of reasons.

145
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
If you've had any design courses, they would teach you you can't read this.

146
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I think you eventually can and, more importantly, I think it's true.

147
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
"Don't mistake legibility for communication."

148
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Just because something's legible doesn't means it communicates.

149
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
More importantly, it doesn't mean it communicates the right thing.

150
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So, what is the message sent before

151
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:15,000
somebody actually gets into the material?

152
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And I think that's sometimes an overlooked area.

153
0:07:19.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
This is working with Marshall McLuhan.

154
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I stayed and worked with his wife and son, Eric,

155
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and we came up with close to 600 quotes from Marshall

156
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times,

157
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
predicting so much of what has happened

158
0:07:35.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
in the advertising, television, media world.

159
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And so this book is called "Probes." It's another word for quotes.

160
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And it's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before,

161
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and basically, I've interpreted the different quotes.

162
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So, this was the contents page originally.

163
0:07:53.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
When I got done it was 540 pages,

164
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and then the publisher, Gingko Press,

165
0:07:57.33,000 --> 0:08:,000
ended up cutting it down considerably:

166
0:08:00.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
it's just under 400 pages now.

167
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But I decided I liked this contents page --

168
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I liked the way it looks -- so I kept it.

169
0:08:07.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
(Laughter)

170
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
It now has no relevance to the book whatsoever,

171
0:08:13.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
but it's a nice spread, I think, in there.

172
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:18,000
(Laughter)

173
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So, a couple spreads from the book:

174
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
here McLuhan says,

175
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:26,000
"The new media are not bridges between Man and Nature; they are Nature."

176
0:08:29.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
"The invention of printing did away with anonymity,

177
0:08:31.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
fostering ideas of literary fame

178
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property,"

179
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
which had never been done before printing.

180
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
"When new technologies impose themselves

181
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:48,000
on societies long habituated to older technologies,

182
0:08:48.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
anxieties of all kinds result."

183
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
"While people are engaged in creating a totally different world,

184
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
they always form vivid images of the preceding world."

185
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I hate this stuff. It's hard to read.

186
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Laughter)

187
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Applause)

188
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
"People in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe,

189
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and no possible occupation except information gathering."

190
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
That was it. That's all he saw as the options. And not too far off.

191
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So, this is a project for Nine Inch Nails.

192
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And I only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden,

193
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and it was done right after 9/11.

194
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And I had recently discovered a bomb shelter

195
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
in the backyard of a house I had bought in LA

196
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
that the real estate person hadn't pointed out.

197
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Laughter)

198
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
There was some bomb shelter built, apparently in the '60s Cuban missile crisis.

199
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And I asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by,

200
0:10:01.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and he goes, "It's something to do with the sewage system."

201
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I was, O.K.; that's fine.

202
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I finally went down there, and it was this old rusted circular thing,

203
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and two beds, and very kind of creepy and weird.

204
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And also, surprisingly, it was done in kind of a cheap metal,

205
0:10:14.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and it had completely rusted through, and water everywhere, and spiders.

206
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And I thought, you know, what were they thinking?

207
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
You'd think maybe cement, possibly, or something.

208
0:10:23.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But anyway, I used this for a cover for the Nine Inch Nails DVD,

209
0:10:28.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and I've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape,

210
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and it's ready. I think I'm ready. So.

211
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
This is an experiment, really, for a client, Quicksilver,

212
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
where we were taking what was a six-shot sequence

213
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the Web.

214
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So, this is a six-shot sequence.

215
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I've taken one shot; I cropped it a few different ways.

216
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
And then the tiny line of copy says,

217
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:02,000
If you want to see this entire sequence --

218
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
how this whole ride was -- go to the website.

219
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site

220
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to get this entire picture.

221
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Got no way of tracking it, so I could be totally wrong.

222
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

223
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I don't have the site. It's just the piece itself.

224
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This is a group in New York called the Coalition for a Smoke-free Environment --

225
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
asked me to do these posters.

226
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
They were wild-posted around New York City.

227
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
You can't really -- well, you can't see it at all --

228
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but the second line is really the more kind of payoff, in a sense.

229
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It says, "If the cigarette companies can lie, then so can we." But --

230
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
(Laughter)

231
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Applause)

232
0:11:44.33,000 --> 0:11:46,000
-- but I did.

233
0:11:46.33,000 --> 0:11:5,000
These were literally wild-posted all over New York one night,

234
0:11:50.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and there were definitely some heads turning,

235
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
you know, people smoking and, "Huh!"

236
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Laughter)

237
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And it was purposely done to look fairly serious.

238
0:12:03.33,000 --> 0:12:06,000
It wasn't some, you know, weird grunge type or something;

239
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:09,000
it looked like they might be real. Anyway.

240
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Poster for Atlantic Center for the Arts, a school in Florida.

241
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
This amazes me. This is a product I just found out.

242
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I was in the Caribbean at Christmas,

243
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and I'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell --

244
0:12:20.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
not that they will sell --

245
0:12:23.33,000 --> 0:12:26,000
that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin.

246
0:12:26.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
This was either an old product with new packaging,

247
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
or a brand-new package, and I just thought,

248
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Yikes! How's that still happening?

249
0:12:34.33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
I do a lot of workshops all over the world, really,

250
0:12:36.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and this particular assignment was

251
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors.

252
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
(Laughter)

253
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I felt this was one of the more successful solutions.

254
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
The students actually cut them up

255
0:13:03.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and put them up around bars and restaurants that night,

256
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and I just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom ...

257
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Laughter)

258
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I did some work for Microsoft a few years back.

259
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
It was a worldwide branding campaign.

260
0:13:18.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And it was interesting to me --

261
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
my background is in sociology; I had no design training,

262
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and sometimes people say, well, that explains it --

263
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but it was a very interesting experiment

264
0:13:28.33,000 --> 0:13:3,000
because there's no product that I had to sell;

265
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
it was simply the image of Microsoft they were trying to improve.

266
0:13:33.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
They thought some people didn't like them.

267
0:13:36.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
(Laughter)

268
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I found out that's very true,

269
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
working on this campaign worldwide.

270
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And our goal was to try to humanize them a bit,

271
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
and what I did was add type and people to the ad,

272
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:54,000
which the previous campaign had not had,

273
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and nobody remembered them, and nobody referenced them.

274
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And we were trying to say that,

275
0:13:57.33,000 --> 0:14:,000
hey, some of these guys that work there are actually OK;

276
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
some of them actually have friends and family,

277
0:14:02.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and they're not all awful people.

278
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And the umbrella campaign was "Thank God it's Monday."

279
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So, we tried to take this --

280
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:13,000
what was perceived as a negative:

281
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
their over-competitiveness, their,

282
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
you know, long working hours --

283
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and turn it into a positive and not run from it.

284
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You know: Thank God it's Monday --

285
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I get to go back to that little cubicle, those fake gray walls,

286
0:14:24.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and hear everybody else's conversations f

287
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
or 10 hours and then go home.

288
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
But anyway, this is one of the ads I was most pleased with,

289
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
because they were all elaborately art-directed,

290
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and this one I thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer.

291
0:14:38.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
It says, "Wonder Around." And then it's a piece of the software.

292
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And this is how the ad ran around the world.

293
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:47,000
In Germany, they made one small change without checking with me --

294
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
nor did they have to, because it was done through agencies --

295
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:51,000
but see if you can tell the difference.

296
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
This is how the ad ran throughout the world;

297
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Germany made one slight change in the ad.

298
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Laughter)

299
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Now, there's kind of two issues here.

300
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:07,000
If you're going to put a kid in the ad, pick one that looks alive.

301
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
(Laughter)

302
0:15:13.33,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I just have a feeling this kid's been there for a week, you know.

303
0:15:15.33,000 --> 0:15:18,000
He's just really hoping that boots up and, you know ...

304
0:15:18.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
(Laughter)

305
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And then as the agency explained to me, they said,

306
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
"Look, we don't have little green people in our country;

307
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
why would we put little green people in our ads, for instance?"

308
0:15:32.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
So, I understand their logic. I totally disagree with it;

309
0:15:36.33,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I think it's a very small-minded approach,

310
0:15:38.33,000 --> 0:15:4,000
the world is certainly much more global,

311
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and I certainly think the people of Germany

312
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:44,000
could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer,

313
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:46,000
though we'll never know.

314
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
This is some work from Ray Gun.

315
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:51,000
And the point of this magazine was to read the articles,

316
0:15:51.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
listen to the music, and try to interpret it.

317
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:57,000
There's no grid, there's no system, there's nothing set up in advance.

318
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
This is an opener for Brian Eno,

319
0:15:59.33,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and it's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music.

320
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:08,000
This is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school.

321
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
There's a lot of great writing in "Ray Gun."

322
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And I was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books.

323
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
(Laughter)

324
0:16:19.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Article on Bryan Ferry -- just really boring article --

325
0:16:21.33,000 --> 0:16:24,000
so I set the whole article in Dingbat.

326
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:31,000
(Laughter)

327
0:16:31.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
You could -- you could highlight it; you could make it Helvetica or something:

328
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:37,000
it is the actual article.

329
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
I suppose you could eventually decode it,

330
0:16:40.33,000 --> 0:16:43,000
but it's really not very well written; it really wouldn't be worthwhile.

331
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:45,000
(Laughter)

332
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Having done a lot of magazines,

333
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
I'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories,

334
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and I was very curious to see how Time and Newsweek would handle 9/11.

335
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:56,000
And I was basically pretty disappointed

336
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:58,000
to see that they had

337
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
chosen to show the photo we'd already seen a million times,

338
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
which was basically the moment of impact.

339
0:17:03.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
And People magazine, I thought,

340
0:17:05.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
got probably the best shot.

341
0:17:07.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
It's kind of horsey type, but the texture --

342
0:17:11.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
the second plane not quite hitting:

343
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
there was something more enticing,

344
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
if that's the right -- it's not the right word --

345
0:17:17.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
but in this cover than Time or Newsweek.

346
0:17:20.33,000 --> 0:17:22,000
But when I got into this magazine,

347
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
there's something kind of disturbing, and this continued.

348
0:17:26.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
On the left we see people dying; we see people running for their lives.

349
0:17:29.33,000 --> 0:17:33,000
And on the right we learn that there's a new way to support your breast.

350
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
The coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue.

351
0:17:37.33,000 --> 0:17:39,000
Look at the image of this lady --

352
0:17:39.33,000 --> 0:17:41,000
who knows what she's going through? --

353
0:17:41.33,000 --> 0:17:44,000
and the copy says: "He knows just how to give me goosebumps."

354
0:17:44.33,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Yeah, he jumps out of buildings. It's --

355
0:17:46.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
unfortunately, this one works, kind of, as a spread.

356
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And this continued through the entire magazine.

357
0:17:52.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
It did not let up.

358
0:17:54.33,000 --> 0:17:56,000
This says: "One clean fits all." .

359
0:17:56.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
There were a lot of orphans made this day,

360
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and here's a dead body being brought out.

361
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:04,000
It just seems to me possibly even a blank page

362
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:07,000
would have been more appropriate.

363
0:18:07.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And this one I think is possibly the worst:

364
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:13,000
two ladies, both facing the same way, both wearing jeans.

365
0:18:13.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
One -- who knows what she's going through;

366
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:2,000
the other one is worried about model behavior and milk.

367
0:18:20.33,000 --> 0:18:22,000
And --

368
0:18:22.33,000 --> 0:18:26,000
I gave a talk in New York a couple months after this,

369
0:18:26.33,000 --> 0:18:29,000
and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that --

370
0:18:29.33,000 --> 0:18:33,000
they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk,

371
0:18:33.33,000 --> 0:18:35,000
and when they got back to their car,

372
0:18:35.33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
they found a note on their car that made them think

373
0:18:37.33,000 --> 0:18:41,000
maybe New York was getting back to being New York again after this event --

374
0:18:41.33,000 --> 0:18:43,000
it had been a few months.

375
0:18:43.33,000 --> 0:18:45,000
This was what they found on their car.

376
0:18:45.33,000 --> 0:18:56,000
(Laughter)

377
0:19:03.33,000 --> 0:19:06,000
There's very few times you'd be happy to find this on your car,

378
0:19:06.33,000 --> 0:19:08,000
but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back.

379
0:19:08.33,000 --> 0:19:1,000
This is my desktop.

380
0:19:10.33,000 --> 0:19:13,000
Somebody told me today there was this thing called folders,

381
0:19:13.33,000 --> 0:19:15,000
but I don't know what they are.

382
0:19:15.33,000 --> 0:19:19,000
These are my notes for the talk -- there might be a correlation here.

383
0:19:19.33,000 --> 0:19:21,000
We are wrapping up.

384
0:19:21.33,000 --> 0:19:24,000
This I saw on the plane, flying in, for hot new products.

385
0:19:24.33,000 --> 0:19:28,000
I'm not sure this is an improvement, or a good idea,

386
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:31,000
because, like, if you don't spend quite enough time in front of your computer,

387
0:19:31.33,000 --> 0:19:33,000
you can now get a plate in the keyboard,

388
0:19:33.33,000 --> 0:19:37,000
so there's no more faking it --

389
0:19:37.33,000 --> 0:19:41,000
that you don't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway.

390
0:19:41.33,000 --> 0:19:43,000
Now there's a plate, and it would be really, really convenient

391
0:19:43.33,000 --> 0:19:46,000
to get a piece of pizza, then type a little bit, then ...

392
0:19:46.33,000 --> 0:19:49,000
I'm just not sure this is improvement.

393
0:19:49.33,000 --> 0:19:52,000
If you ever doubt the power of graphic design,

394
0:19:52.33,000 --> 0:19:57,000
this is a very generic sign that literally says, "Vote for Hitler." It says nothing else.

395
0:19:57.33,000 --> 0:19:59,000
And this to me is an extreme case

396
0:19:59.33,000 --> 0:20:02,000
of the power of emotion, of graphic design,

397
0:20:02.33,000 --> 0:20:07,000
even though, in fact, was a very generic poster at the time.

398
0:20:07.33,000 --> 0:20:09,000
What's next? What's next is going to be people.

399
0:20:09.33,000 --> 0:20:11,000
As we get more technically driven,

400
0:20:11.33,000 --> 0:20:15,000
the importance of people becomes more than it's ever been before.

401
0:20:15.33,000 --> 0:20:18,000
You have to utilize who you are in your work.

402
0:20:18.33,000 --> 0:20:21,000
Nobody else can do that: nobody else can pull from your background,

403
0:20:21.33,000 --> 0:20:24,000
from your parents, your upbringing, your whole life experience.

404
0:20:24.33,000 --> 0:20:28,000
If you allow that to happen, it's really the only way you can do some unique work,

405
0:20:28.33,000 --> 0:20:31,000
and you're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well.

406
0:20:31.33,000 --> 0:20:34,000
This is -- I like found art; hand lettering's coming back in a big way,

407
0:20:34.33,000 --> 0:20:36,000
and I thought this was a great example of both.

408
0:20:36.33,000 --> 0:20:38,000
This lady's advertising for her lost pit bull.

409
0:20:38.33,000 --> 0:20:41,000
It's friendly -- she's underlined friendly --

410
0:20:41.33,000 --> 0:20:45,000
that's probably why she calls it Hercules or Hercles. She can't spell.

411
0:20:45.33,000 --> 0:20:48,000
(Laughter)

412
0:20:48.33,000 --> 0:20:5,000
But more importantly,

413
0:20:50.33,000 --> 0:20:53,000
she's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull.

414
0:20:53.33,000 --> 0:20:55,000
And I'm thinking, yeah, right,

415
0:20:55.33,000 --> 0:20:58,000
I'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks.

416
0:20:58.33,000 --> 0:21:01,000
I have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for Hercles,

417
0:21:01.33,000 --> 0:21:05,000
and you get charged by this thing and you go,

418
0:21:05.33,000 --> 0:21:07,000
oh, please be Hercles; please be the friendly one.

419
0:21:07.33,000 --> 0:21:11,000
(Laughter)

420
0:21:11.33,000 --> 0:21:14,000
I'm sure she never found the dog, because I took the sign.

421
0:21:14.33,000 --> 0:21:15,000
(Laughter)

422
0:21:15.33,000 --> 0:21:19,000
But I was asked to give a talk at a conference in Sacramento a few years back.

423
0:21:19.33,000 --> 0:21:21,000
And the theme was courage, and they asked me to talk

424
0:21:21.33,000 --> 0:21:24,000
about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer.

425
0:21:24.33,000 --> 0:21:27,000
And I remembered seeing this photograph of my father,

426
0:21:27.33,000 --> 0:21:29,000
who was a test pilot, and he told me that

427
0:21:29.33,000 --> 0:21:31,000
when you signed up to become a test pilot,

428
0:21:31.33,000 --> 0:21:33,000
they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance

429
0:21:33.33,000 --> 0:21:35,000
of death on the job.

430
0:21:35.33,000 --> 0:21:38,000
That's pretty high for most occupations.

431
0:21:38.33,000 --> 0:21:4,000
(Laughter)

432
0:21:40.33,000 --> 0:21:42,000
But, you know, the government would make a plane;

433
0:21:42.33,000 --> 0:21:44,000
they'd say, go see if that one flies, would you?

434
0:21:44.33,000 --> 0:21:47,000
Some of them did; some of them didn't.

435
0:21:47.33,000 --> 0:21:5,000
And I started thinking about some of these decisions I have to make

436
0:21:50.33,000 --> 0:21:53,000
between, like, serif versus san-serif.

437
0:21:53.33,000 --> 0:21:56,000
(Laughter)

438
0:21:56.33,000 --> 0:22:,000
And for the most part, they're not real life-threatening.

439
0:22:00.33,000 --> 0:22:03,000
Why not experiment? Why not have some fun?

440
0:22:03.33,000 --> 0:22:06,000
Why not put some of yourself into the work?

441
0:22:06.33,000 --> 0:22:08,000
And when I was teaching, I used to always ask the students,

442
0:22:08.33,000 --> 0:22:1,000
What's the definition of a good job?

443
0:22:10.33,000 --> 0:22:12,000
And as teachers, after you get all the answers,

444
0:22:12.33,000 --> 0:22:14,000
you like to give them the correct answer.

445
0:22:14.33,000 --> 0:22:17,000
And the best one I've heard -- I'm sure some of you have heard this --

446
0:22:17.33,000 --> 0:22:19,000
the definition of a good job is:

447
0:22:19.33,000 --> 0:22:23,000
If you could afford to -- if money wasn't an issue --

448
0:22:23.33,000 --> 0:22:25,000
would you be doing that same work?

449
0:22:25.33,000 --> 0:22:28,000
And if you would, you've got a great job.

450
0:22:28.33,000 --> 0:22:31,000
And if you wouldn't, what the heck are you doing?

451
0:22:31.33,000 --> 0:22:33,000
You're going to be dead a really long time.

452
0:22:33.33,000 --> 0:22:34,000
Thank you very much.

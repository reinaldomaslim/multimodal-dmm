1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So I'm here to tell you a story of success from Africa.

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
A year and a half ago,

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
four of the five people who are full time members

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
at Ushahidi,

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
which means "testimony" in Swahili,

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
were TED Fellows.

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
A year ago in Kenya we had post-election violence.

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And in that time we prototyped and built,

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in about three days, a system that would allow

10
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
anybody with a mobile phone

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to send in information and reports on what was happening around them.

12
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We took what we knew about Africa,

13
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the default device,

14
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the mobile phone, as our common denominator,

15
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and went from there.

16
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We got reports like this.

17
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This is just a couple of them from January 17th, last year.

18
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And our system was rudimentary. It was very basic.

19
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It was a mash-up that used data that we collected from people,

20
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and we put it on our map.

21
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But then we decided we needed to do something more.

22
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We needed to take what we had built

23
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and create a platform out of it so that it could be used elsewhere in the world.

24
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And so there is a team of developers

25
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
from all over Africa, who are part of this team now --

26
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
from Ghana, from Malawi, from Kenya.

27
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
There is even some from the U.S.

28
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We're building for smartphones, so that it can be used in the developed world,

29
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
as well as the developing world.

30
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We are realizing that this is true.

31
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
If it works in Africa then it will work anywhere.

32
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And so we build for it in Africa first

33
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and then we move to the edges.

34
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It's now been deployed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

35
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
It's being used by NGOs all over East Africa,

36
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
small NGOs doing their own little projects.

37
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Just this last month it was deployed by

38
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Al Jazeera in Gaza.

39
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But that's actually not what I'm here to talk about.

40
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I'm here to talk about the next big thing,

41
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
because what we're finding out is that

42
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
we have this capacity to report

43
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
eyewitness accounts of what's going on in real time.

44
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We're seeing this in events like Mumbai recently,

45
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
where it's so much easier to report now

46
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
than it is to consume it.

47
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
There is so much information; what do you do?

48
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This is the Twitter reports for over three days

49
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
just covering Mumbai.

50
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
How do you decide what is important?

51
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
What is the veracity level of what you're looking at?

52
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So what we find is that there is this

53
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
great deal of wasted crisis information

54
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
because there is just too much information for us to

55
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
actually do anything with right now.

56
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And what we're actually really concerned with

57
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is this first three hours.

58
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
What we are looking at is the first three hours.

59
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
How do we deal with that information that is coming in?

60
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
You can't understand what is actually happening.

61
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
On the ground and around the world

62
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
people are still curious,

63
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and trying to figure out what is going on. But they don't know.

64
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So what we built of course, Ushahidi,

65
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
is crowdsourcing this information.

66
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
You see this with Twitter, too. You get this information overload.

67
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So you've got a lot of information. That's great.

68
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But now what?

69
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So we think that there is something interesting we can do here.

70
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And we have a small team who is working on this.

71
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We think that we can actually create

72
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
a crowdsourced filter.

73
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Take the crowd and apply them to the information.

74
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
And by rating it and by rating

75
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the different people who submit information,

76
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
we can get refined results

77
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and weighted results.

78
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So that we have a better understanding

79
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of the probability of something being true or not.

80
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
This is the kind of innovation that is,

81
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
quite frankly -- it's interesting that it's coming from Africa.

82
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's coming from places that you wouldn't expect.

83
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
From young, smart developers.

84
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And it's a community around it that has decided to build this.

85
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So, thank you very much.

86
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And we are very happy to be part of the TED family.

87
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.878,000 --> 0:00:16,000
What's one thing that every person in this room is going to become?

2
0:00:16.994,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Older.

3
0:00:18.195,000 --> 0:00:2,000
And most of us are scared stiff at the prospect.

4
0:00:20.785,000 --> 0:00:21,000
How does that word make you feel?

5
0:00:23.633,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I used to feel the same way.

6
0:00:25.648,000 --> 0:00:26,000
What was I most worried about?

7
0:00:27.454,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Ending up drooling in some grim institutional hallway.

8
0:00:31.131,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And then I learned that only four percent of older Americans

9
0:00:34.338,000 --> 0:00:35,000
are living in nursing homes,

10
0:00:35.751,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and the percentage is dropping.

11
0:00:37.971,000 --> 0:00:39,000
What else was I worried about?

12
0:00:40.09,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Dementia.

13
0:00:41.524,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Turns out that most of us can think just fine to the end.

14
0:00:44.693,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Dementia rates are dropping, too.

15
0:00:46.626,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The real epidemic is anxiety over memory loss.

16
0:00:49.555,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:51.439,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I also figured that old people were depressed

18
0:00:53.979,000 --> 0:00:56,000
because they were old and they were going to die soon.

19
0:00:57.452,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Laughter)

20
0:00:59.225,000 --> 0:01:,000
It turns out that the longer people live,

21
0:01:01.203,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the less they fear dying,

22
0:01:02.726,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and that people are happiest at the beginnings and the end of their lives.

23
0:01:06.479,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's called the U-curve of happiness,

24
0:01:08.5,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and it's been borne out by dozens of studies around the world.

25
0:01:11.829,000 --> 0:01:13,000
You don't have to be a Buddhist or a billionaire.

26
0:01:14.429,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The curve is a function of the way aging itself affects the brain.

27
0:01:18.948,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So I started feeling a lot better about getting older,

28
0:01:22.254,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I started obsessing about why so few people know these things.

29
0:01:27.179,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The reason is ageism:

30
0:01:28.849,000 --> 0:01:31,000
discrimination and stereotyping on the basis of age.

31
0:01:32.995,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We experience it anytime someone assumes we're too old for something,

32
0:01:36.906,000 --> 0:01:39,000
instead of finding out who we are and what we're capable of,

33
0:01:40.23,000 --> 0:01:41,000
or too young.

34
0:01:41.727,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Ageism cuts both ways.

35
0:01:44.099,000 --> 0:01:49,000
All -isms are socially constructed ideas -- racism, sexism, homophobia --

36
0:01:49.414,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and that means we make them up,

37
0:01:51.618,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and they can change over time.

38
0:01:53.948,000 --> 0:01:55,000
All these prejudices pit us against each other

39
0:01:56.971,000 --> 0:01:58,000
to maintain the status quo,

40
0:01:59.137,000 --> 0:02:03,000
like auto workers in the US competing against auto workers in Mexico

41
0:02:03.283,000 --> 0:02:05,000
instead of organizing for better wages.

42
0:02:05.89,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Applause)

43
0:02:07.803,000 --> 0:02:11,000
We know it's not OK to allocate resources by race or by sex.

44
0:02:12.218,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Why should it be OK to weigh the needs of the young against the old?

45
0:02:16.407,000 --> 0:02:19,000
All prejudice relies on "othering" -- seeing a group of people

46
0:02:20.067,000 --> 0:02:21,000
as other than ourselves:

47
0:02:21.515,000 --> 0:02:24,000
other race, other religion, other nationality.

48
0:02:25.016,000 --> 0:02:27,000
The strange thing about ageism:

49
0:02:27.338,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that other is us.

50
0:02:30.046,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Ageism feeds on denial -- our reluctance to acknowledge

51
0:02:33.036,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that we are going to become that older person.

52
0:02:36.47,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's denial when we try to pass for younger

53
0:02:39.644,000 --> 0:02:41,000
or when we believe in anti-aging products,

54
0:02:42.582,000 --> 0:02:44,000
or when we feel like our bodies are betraying us,

55
0:02:45.418,000 --> 0:02:46,000
simply because they are changing.

56
0:02:48.047,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Why on earth do we stop celebrating the ability to adapt and grow

57
0:02:52.013,000 --> 0:02:53,000
as we move through life?

58
0:02:54.02,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Why should aging well mean struggling to look and move

59
0:02:57.188,000 --> 0:02:59,000
like younger versions of ourselves?

60
0:02:59.697,000 --> 0:03:01,000
It's embarrassing to be called out as older

61
0:03:01.844,000 --> 0:03:03,000
until we quit being embarrassed about it,

62
0:03:03.939,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and it's not healthy to go through life dreading our futures.

63
0:03:07.097,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The sooner we get off this hamster wheel of age denial,

64
0:03:10.557,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the better off we are.

65
0:03:13.461,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Stereotypes are always a mistake, of course,

66
0:03:15.563,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but especially when it comes to age,

67
0:03:17.313,000 --> 0:03:18,000
because the longer we live,

68
0:03:18.674,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the more different from one another we become.

69
0:03:20.842,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Right? Think about it.

70
0:03:22.243,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And yet, we tend to think of everyone in a retirement home

71
0:03:24.993,000 --> 0:03:25,000
as the same age: old --

72
0:03:26.887,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:28.428,000 --> 0:03:3,000
when they can span four decades.

74
0:03:30.882,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Can you imagine thinking that way about a group of people

75
0:03:33.573,000 --> 0:03:35,000
between the ages of 20 and 60?

76
0:03:36.458,000 --> 0:03:39,000
When you get to a party, do you head for people your own age?

77
0:03:39.705,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Have you ever grumbled about entitled millennials?

78
0:03:43.459,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Have you ever rejected a haircut or a relationship or an outing

79
0:03:46.985,000 --> 0:03:48,000
because it's not age-appropriate?

80
0:03:49.359,000 --> 0:03:5,000
For adults, there's no such thing.

81
0:03:51.603,000 --> 0:03:53,000
All these behaviors are ageist.

82
0:03:53.662,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We all do them,

83
0:03:55.357,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and we can't challenge bias unless we're aware of it.

84
0:03:58.518,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Nobody's born ageist,

85
0:03:59.878,000 --> 0:04:,000
but it starts at early childhood,

86
0:04:01.568,000 --> 0:04:04,000
around the same time attitudes towards race and gender start to form,

87
0:04:05.042,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because negative messages about late life bombard us

88
0:04:08.498,000 --> 0:04:11,000
from the media and popular culture at every turn.

89
0:04:11.874,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Right? Wrinkles are ugly.

90
0:04:13.471,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Old people are pathetic.

91
0:04:15.012,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It's sad to be old.

92
0:04:16.863,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Look at Hollywood.

93
0:04:18.278,000 --> 0:04:2,000
A survey of recent Best Picture nominations

94
0:04:20.406,000 --> 0:04:23,000
found that only 12 percent of speaking or named characters

95
0:04:24.203,000 --> 0:04:25,000
were age 60 and up,

96
0:04:25.733,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and many of them were portrayed as impaired.

97
0:04:28.845,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Older people can be the most ageist of all,

98
0:04:30.911,000 --> 0:04:33,000
because we've had a lifetime to internalize these messages

99
0:04:34.179,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and we've never thought to challenge them.

100
0:04:36.683,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I had to acknowledge it

101
0:04:38.193,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and stop colluding.

102
0:04:39.921,000 --> 0:04:41,000
"Senior moment" quips, for example:

103
0:04:42.168,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I stopped making them when it dawned on me

104
0:04:44.216,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that when I lost the car keys in high school,

105
0:04:46.358,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I didn't call it a "junior moment."

106
0:04:48.118,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

107
0:04:50.579,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I stopped blaming my sore knee on being 64.

108
0:04:53.73,000 --> 0:04:54,000
My other knee doesn't hurt,

109
0:04:55.298,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and it's just as old.

110
0:04:56.798,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Laughter)

111
0:04:58.834,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Applause)

112
0:05:00.151,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We are all worried about some aspect of getting older,

113
0:05:03.113,000 --> 0:05:04,000
whether running out of money,

114
0:05:04.725,000 --> 0:05:06,000
getting sick, ending up alone,

115
0:05:07.126,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and those fears are legitimate and real.

116
0:05:10.084,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But what never dawns on most of us

117
0:05:11.82,000 --> 0:05:13,000
is that the experience of reaching old age

118
0:05:13.954,000 --> 0:05:15,000
can be better or worse depending on the culture

119
0:05:16.589,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in which it takes place.

120
0:05:18.575,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It is not having a vagina that makes life harder for women.

121
0:05:21.875,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It's sexism.

122
0:05:23.113,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Applause)

123
0:05:25.032,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It's not loving a man that makes life harder for gay guys.

124
0:05:27.805,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It's homophobia.

125
0:05:29.128,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And it is not the passage of time that makes getting older

126
0:05:32.74,000 --> 0:05:33,000
so much harder than it has to be.

127
0:05:34.353,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It is ageism.

128
0:05:35.706,000 --> 0:05:36,000
When labels are hard to read

129
0:05:37.312,000 --> 0:05:38,000
or there's no handrail

130
0:05:38.677,000 --> 0:05:39,000
or we can't open the damn jar,

131
0:05:40.361,000 --> 0:05:41,000
we blame ourselves,

132
0:05:41.759,000 --> 0:05:43,000
our failure to age successfully,

133
0:05:44.147,000 --> 0:05:47,000
instead of the ageism that makes those natural transitions shameful

134
0:05:48.165,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and the discrimination that makes those barriers acceptable.

135
0:05:52.335,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You can't make money off satisfaction,

136
0:05:54.349,000 --> 0:05:56,000
but shame and fear create markets,

137
0:05:57.051,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and capitalism always needs new markets.

138
0:06:00.189,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Who says wrinkles are ugly?

139
0:06:01.924,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The multi-billion-dollar skin care industry.

140
0:06:05.122,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Who says perimenopause and low T and mild cognitive impairment

141
0:06:09.015,000 --> 0:06:1,000
are medical conditions?

142
0:06:10.332,000 --> 0:06:12,000
The trillion-dollar pharmaceutical industry.

143
0:06:12.746,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Cheers)

144
0:06:13.801,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The more clearly we see these forces at work,

145
0:06:15.955,000 --> 0:06:18,000
the easier it is to come up with alternative, more positive

146
0:06:19.259,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and more accurate narratives.

147
0:06:22.155,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Aging is not a problem to be fixed or a disease to be cured.

148
0:06:26.724,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It is a natural, powerful, lifelong process that unites us all.

149
0:06:32.552,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Changing the culture is a tall order, I know that, but culture is fluid.

150
0:06:36.69,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Look at how much the position of women has changed in my lifetime

151
0:06:40.029,000 --> 0:06:42,000
or the incredible strides that the gay rights movement

152
0:06:42.578,000 --> 0:06:44,000
has made in just a few decades, right?

153
0:06:44.664,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Applause)

154
0:06:45.712,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Look at gender.

155
0:06:47.203,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We used to think of it as a binary, male or female,

156
0:06:49.884,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and now we understand it's a spectrum.

157
0:06:52.074,000 --> 0:06:55,000
It is high time to ditch the old-young binary, too.

158
0:06:55.692,000 --> 0:06:57,000
There is no line in the sand between old and young,

159
0:06:58.366,000 --> 0:06:59,000
after which it's all downhill.

160
0:07:00.342,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And the longer we wait to challenge that idea,

161
0:07:02.627,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the more damage it does to ourselves and our place in the world,

162
0:07:06.689,000 --> 0:07:09,000
like in the workforce, where age discrimination is rampant.

163
0:07:10.466,000 --> 0:07:13,000
In Silicon Valley, engineers are getting Botoxed and hair-plugged

164
0:07:13.935,000 --> 0:07:14,000
before key interviews --

165
0:07:15.287,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and these are skilled white men in their 30s,

166
0:07:17.792,000 --> 0:07:19,000
so imagine the effects further down the food chain.

167
0:07:20.288,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:22.474,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The personal and economic consequences are devastating.

169
0:07:25.869,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Not one stereotype about older workers holds up under scrutiny.

170
0:07:30.039,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Companies aren't adaptable and creative because their employees are young;

171
0:07:34.141,000 --> 0:07:36,000
they're adaptable and creative despite it.

172
0:07:37.114,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Companies --

173
0:07:38.293,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

174
0:07:39.381,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Applause)

175
0:07:41.997,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We know that diverse companies aren't just better places to work;

176
0:07:45.099,000 --> 0:07:46,000
they work better.

177
0:07:46.308,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And just like race and sex, age is a criterion for diversity.

178
0:07:50.873,000 --> 0:07:52,000
A growing body of fascinating research

179
0:07:52.933,000 --> 0:07:53,000
shows that attitudes towards aging

180
0:07:54.65,000 --> 0:07:57,000
affect how our minds and bodies function at the cellular level.

181
0:07:58.2,000 --> 0:08:,000
When we talk to older people like this (Speaks more loudly)

182
0:08:01.07,000 --> 0:08:02,000
or call them "sweetie" or "young lady" --

183
0:08:03.069,000 --> 0:08:04,000
it's called elderspeak --

184
0:08:04.42,000 --> 0:08:06,000
they appear to instantly age,

185
0:08:06.447,000 --> 0:08:08,000
walking and talking less competently.

186
0:08:09.395,000 --> 0:08:11,000
People with more positive feelings towards aging

187
0:08:11.711,000 --> 0:08:12,000
walk faster,

188
0:08:12.907,000 --> 0:08:13,000
they do better on memory tests,

189
0:08:14.518,000 --> 0:08:16,000
they heal quicker, and they live longer.

190
0:08:17.834,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Even with brains full of plaques and tangles,

191
0:08:20.475,000 --> 0:08:21,000
some people stayed sharp to the end.

192
0:08:22.995,000 --> 0:08:23,000
What did they have in common?

193
0:08:24.673,000 --> 0:08:25,000
A sense of purpose.

194
0:08:26.003,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And what's the biggest obstacle to having a sense of purpose in late life?

195
0:08:29.505,000 --> 0:08:33,000
A culture that tells us that getting older means shuffling offstage.

196
0:08:33.647,000 --> 0:08:35,000
That's why the World Health Organization is developing

197
0:08:36.442,000 --> 0:08:37,000
a global anti-ageism initiative

198
0:08:38.054,000 --> 0:08:41,000
to extend not just life span but health span.

199
0:08:41.894,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Women experience the double whammy

200
0:08:43.927,000 --> 0:08:44,000
of ageism and sexism,

201
0:08:45.591,000 --> 0:08:47,000
so we experience aging differently.

202
0:08:48.12,000 --> 0:08:5,000
There's a double standard at work here -- shocker --

203
0:08:50.991,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Laughter)

204
0:08:52.283,000 --> 0:08:55,000
the notion that aging enhances men and devalues women.

205
0:08:56.457,000 --> 0:09:,000
Women reinforce this double standard when we compete to stay young,

206
0:09:00.806,000 --> 0:09:02,000
another punishing and losing proposition.

207
0:09:03.481,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Does any woman in this room really believe

208
0:09:06.225,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that she is a lesser version --

209
0:09:08.235,000 --> 0:09:11,000
less interesting, less fun in bed, less valuable --

210
0:09:11.655,000 --> 0:09:12,000
than the woman she once was?

211
0:09:14.254,000 --> 0:09:15,000
This discrimination affects our health,

212
0:09:16.162,000 --> 0:09:17,000
our well-being and our income,

213
0:09:17.915,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and the effects add up over time.

214
0:09:20.42,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They are further compounded by race and by class,

215
0:09:23.075,000 --> 0:09:25,000
which is why, everywhere in the world,

216
0:09:25.311,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the poorest of the poor are old women of color.

217
0:09:29.308,000 --> 0:09:3,000
What's the takeaway from that map?

218
0:09:31.329,000 --> 0:09:33,000
By 2050, one out of five of us,

219
0:09:33.761,000 --> 0:09:34,000
almost two billion people,

220
0:09:35.531,000 --> 0:09:37,000
will be age 60 and up.

221
0:09:37.577,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Longevity is a fundamental hallmark of human progress.

222
0:09:41.072,000 --> 0:09:46,000
All these older people represent a vast unprecedented and untapped market.

223
0:09:47.089,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And yet, capitalism and urbanization have propelled age bias

224
0:09:51.025,000 --> 0:09:53,000
into every corner of the globe,

225
0:09:53.088,000 --> 0:09:55,000
from Switzerland, where elders fare the best,

226
0:09:55.53,000 --> 0:09:59,000
to Afghanistan, which sits at the bottom of the Global AgeWatch Index.

227
0:10:00.54,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Half of the world's countries aren't mentioned on that list

228
0:10:03.425,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because we don't bother to collect data on millions of people

229
0:10:07.041,000 --> 0:10:08,000
because they're no longer young.

230
0:10:09.416,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Almost two-thirds of people over 60 around the world

231
0:10:12.274,000 --> 0:10:14,000
say they have trouble accessing healthcare.

232
0:10:14.873,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Almost three-quarters say their income doesn't cover basic services

233
0:10:18.704,000 --> 0:10:21,000
like food, water, electricity, and decent housing.

234
0:10:23.034,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Is this the world we want our children, who may well live to be a hundred,

235
0:10:27.089,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to inherit?

236
0:10:28.374,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Everyone -- all ages, all genders, all nationalities --

237
0:10:32.413,000 --> 0:10:34,000
is old or future-old,

238
0:10:34.649,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and unless we put an end to it, ageism will oppress us all.

239
0:10:38.538,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And that makes it a perfect target for collective advocacy.

240
0:10:43.115,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Why add another -ism to the list when so many, racism in particular,

241
0:10:47.148,000 --> 0:10:48,000
call out for action?

242
0:10:48.96,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Here's the thing:

243
0:10:50.217,000 --> 0:10:51,000
we don't have to choose.

244
0:10:52.011,000 --> 0:10:54,000
When we make the world a better place to grow old in,

245
0:10:54.73,000 --> 0:10:57,000
we make it a better place in which to be from somewhere else,

246
0:10:57.895,000 --> 0:10:58,000
to have a disability,

247
0:10:59.453,000 --> 0:11:02,000
to be queer, to be non-rich, to be non-white.

248
0:11:03.109,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And when we show up at all ages for whatever cause matters most to us --

249
0:11:07.53,000 --> 0:11:09,000
save the whales, save the democracy --

250
0:11:10.279,000 --> 0:11:12,000
we not only make that effort more effective,

251
0:11:12.833,000 --> 0:11:14,000
we dismantle ageism in the process.

252
0:11:15.856,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Longevity is here to stay.

253
0:11:18.197,000 --> 0:11:2,000
A movement to end ageism is underway.

254
0:11:20.732,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I'm in it, and I hope you will join me.

255
0:11:24.059,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Applause and cheers)

256
0:11:28.415,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Thank you. Let's do it! Let's do it!

257
0:11:33.027,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
For a moment, what I need to do

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is project something on the screen of your imagination.

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
We're in 17th century Japan

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
on the west coast,

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and a little, wizened monk

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
is hurrying along, near midnight,

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to the crest of a small hill.

8
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
He arrives on the small hill,

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
dripping with water.

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
He stands there,

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and he looks across at the island, Sado.

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And he scans across the ocean, and he looks at the sky.

13
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Then he says to himself, very quietly,

14
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
"[Turbulent the sea,]

15
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
[Stretching across to Sado]

16
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
[The Milky Way]."

17
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Basho was a brilliant man.

18
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
He said more with less

19
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
than any human

20
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that I have ever read or talked to.

21
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Basho, in 17 syllables,

22
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
juxtaposed

23
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
a turbulent ocean

24
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
driven by a storm now past,

25
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and captured the almost

26
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
impossible beauty

27
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of our home galaxy

28
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
with millions of stars,

29
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
probably hundreds and hundreds of -- who knows how many -- planets,

30
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
maybe even an ocean

31
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that we will probably call Sylvia in time.

32
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
As he was nearing his death,

33
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
his disciples and followers

34
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
kept asking him,

35
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"What's the secret?

36
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
How can you

37
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
make haiku poems so beautiful so easily?"

38
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And toward the end, he said,

39
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
"If you would know the pine tree,

40
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
go to the pine tree."

41
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
That was it.

42
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Sylvia has said we must use

44
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
every capacity we have

45
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in order to know the oceans.

46
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
If we would know the oceans,

47
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
we must go to the oceans.

48
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And what I'd like to talk to you today about, a little bit,

49
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is really transforming

50
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
the relationship, or the interplay,

51
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
between humans and oceans

52
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
with a new capability

53
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that is not at all routine yet.

54
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I hope it will be.

55
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
There are a few key points.

56
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
One of them is the oceans are central

57
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to the quality of life on earth.

58
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Another is that there are bold, new ways

59
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
of studying oceans

60
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that we have not used well yet.

61
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And the last is that these bold, new ways

62
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that we are exploring

63
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
as a community

64
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
will transform the way we look at our planet, our oceans,

65
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and eventually how we manage

66
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
probably the entire planet, for what it's worth.

67
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So what scientists do when they begin

68
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is to start with the system.

69
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
They define what the system is.

70
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The system isn't Chesapeake Bay.

71
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's not the Kuril arc. It's not even the entire Pacific.

72
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It's the whole planet,

73
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the entire planet, continents and oceans together.

74
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
That's the system.

75
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And basically, our challenge

76
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
is to optimize the benefits

77
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and mitigate the risks

78
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of living on a planet that's driven by only two processes,

79
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
two sources of energy,

80
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
one of which is solar,

81
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that drives the winds, the waves,

82
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
the clouds, the storms and photosynthesis.

83
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The second one is internal energy.

84
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And these two war against one another

85
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
almost continuously.

86
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Mountain ranges, plate tectonics,

87
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
moves the continents around, forms ore deposits.

88
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Volcanoes erupt.

89
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
That's the planet that we live on.

90
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It's immensely complex.

91
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Now I don't expect all of you to see all the details here,

92
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but what I want you to see is

93
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
this is about 10 percent

94
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
of the processes that operate within

95
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the oceans almost continuously,

96
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and have for the last 4 billion years.

97
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This is a system that's been around a very long time.

98
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And these have all co-evolved.

99
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
What do I mean by that?

100
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They interact with one another constantly.

101
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
All of them interact with one another.

102
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So the complexity of this system that we're looking at,

103
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the one driven by the sun --

104
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
upper portion, mostly --

105
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and the lower portion is partly driven

106
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
by the input from heat below

107
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and by other processes.

108
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
This is very, very important

109
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because this is the system, this is the crucible,

110
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
out of which life on the planet came,

111
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and it's now time for us to understand it.

112
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We must understand it.

113
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
That's one of the themes that Sylvia reminds us about:

114
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
understand this ocean of ours,

115
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
this basic life support system,

116
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the dominant life support system on the planet.

117
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Look at this complexity here.

118
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
This is only one variable.

119
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
If you can see the complexity,

120
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
you can see how

121
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
tiny, little eddies

122
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and large eddies and the motion --

123
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
this is just sea surface temperature,

124
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but it's immensely complicated.

125
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Now a layer in,

126
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the other two or three hundred processes

127
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
that are all interacting,

128
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
partly as a function of temperature, partly as a function of all the other factors,

129
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and you've got a really complicated system.

130
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
That's our challenge, is to understand,

131
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
understand this system in new and phenomenal ways.

132
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And there's an urgency to this.

133
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Part of the urgency comes from the fact

134
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that, of order, a billion people on the planet currently

135
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
are undernourished or starving.

136
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And part of the issue

137
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is for Cody --

138
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
who's here,

139
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
16 years old --

140
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and I have permission to relay this number.

141
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
When he, 40 years from now,

142
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
is the age of Nancy Brown,

143
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
there are going to be

144
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
another two and a half billion people on the planet.

145
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We can't solve all the problems

146
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
by looking only at the oceans,

147
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but if we don't understand

148
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the fundamental life support system of this planet

149
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
much more thoroughly than we do now,

150
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
then the stresses that we will face,

151
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and that Cody will face,

152
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and even Nancy, who's going to live till she's 98,

153
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
will have really problems coping.

154
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
All right, let's talk about another perspective

155
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
on the importance of the oceans.

156
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Look at this diagram, which is showing

157
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
warm waters in red,

158
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
cool waters in blue,

159
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and on the continents, what you're seeing in bright green,

160
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
is the growth of vegetation,

161
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and in olive green, the dieback of vegetation.

162
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And in the lower left hand corner there's a clock ticking away

163
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
from 1982 to 1998

164
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and then cycling again.

165
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
What you'll see is that the rhythms

166
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of growth, of vegetation --

167
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
a subset of which is food on the continents --

168
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
is directly tied to the rhythms

169
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
of the sea surface temperatures.

170
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The oceans control,

171
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
or at least significantly influence,

172
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
correlate with,

173
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the growth patterns and the drought patterns

174
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and the rain patterns on the continents.

175
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So people in Kansas, in a wheat field in Kansas,

176
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
need to understand that the oceans

177
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
are central to them as well.

178
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Another complexity: this is the age of the oceans.

179
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
I'm going to layer in on top of this

180
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the tectonic plates.

181
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
The age of the ocean, the tectonic plates,

182
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
gives rise to a totally new phenomenon

183
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that we have heard about

184
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
in this conference.

185
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And I share with you some very high-definition video

186
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that we collected in real time.

187
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Seconds after this video was taken,

188
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
people in Beijing,

189
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
people in Sydney, people in Amsterdam,

190
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
people in Washington D.C. were watching this.

191
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Now you've heard of hydrothermal vents,

192
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but the other discovery

193
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
is that deep below the sea floor,

194
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
there is vast reservoir of microbial activity,

195
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
which we have only just discovered

196
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and we have almost no way to study.

197
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Some people have estimated

198
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that the biomass

199
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
tied up in these microbes

200
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
living in the pours and the cracks

201
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
of the sea floor and below

202
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
rival the total amount of living biomass

203
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
at the surface of the planet.

204
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
It's an astonishing insight,

205
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and we have only found out about this recently.

206
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
This is very, very exciting.

207
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It may be the next rainforest,

208
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
in terms of pharmaceuticals.

209
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We know little or nothing about it.

210
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Well, Marcel Proust has this wonderful saying

211
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
that, "The real voyage of discovery

212
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
consists not so much in seeking new territory,

213
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but possibly in having new sets of eyes,"

214
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
new ways of seeing things,

215
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
a new mindset.

216
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And many of you remember

217
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
the early stages of oceanography,

218
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
when we had to use what we had at our fingertips.

219
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And it wasn't easy. It wasn't easy in those days.

220
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Some of you remember this, I'm sure.

221
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And now, we have an entire suite of tools

222
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that are really pretty powerful --

223
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
ships, satellites, moorings.

224
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
But they don't quite cut it. They don't quite give us what we need.

225
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And the program that I wanted to talk to you about

226
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
just a little bit here,

227
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
was funded, and it involves autonomous vehicles

228
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
like the one running across the base of this image.

229
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Modeling: on the right hand side,

230
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
there's a very complex computational model.

231
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
On the left hand side, there's a new type of mooring,

232
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
which I'll show you in just a second.

233
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And on the basis

234
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
of several points,

235
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the oceans are complex, and they're central to the life on earth.

236
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
They are changing rapidly, but not predictably.

237
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And the models that we need to predict the future

238
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
do not have enough data to refine them.

239
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
The computational power

240
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
is amazing.

241
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But without data, those models

242
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
will never ever be predicted.

243
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And that's what we really need.

244
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
For a variety of reasons they're dangerous,

245
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but we feel that OOI,

246
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
this Ocean Observatory Initiative,

247
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
which the National Science Foundation

248
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
has begun to fund,

249
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
has the potential to really transform things.

250
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And the goal of the program is to

251
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
launch an era of scientific discovery

252
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and understanding

253
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
across and within the ocean basins,

254
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
utilizing widely accessible,

255
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
interactive telepresence.

256
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
It's a new world.

257
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We will be present throughout

258
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
the volume of the ocean, at will,

259
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
communicating in real time.

260
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And this is what the system involves,

261
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
a number of sites in the southern hemisphere,

262
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
shown in those circles.

263
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And in the northern hemisphere there are four sites.

264
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I won't talk a lot about most of them right here,

265
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
but the one on the west coast, that's in the box,

266
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
is called the regional scale nodes.

267
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
It was once called Neptune.

268
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And let me show you what's behind it.

269
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Fiber: next-generation way of communicating.

270
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
You can see the copper tips on these things.

271
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
You can transmit power,

272
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
but the bandwidth is in those tiny, little threads

273
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
smaller than the hair on your head in diameter.

274
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And this particular set here

275
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
can transmit something of the order of

276
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
three to five terabits per second.

277
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This is phenomenal bandwidth.

278
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And this is what the planet looks like.

279
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
We are already laced up

280
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
as if we're in a fiber optic corset, if you like.

281
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
This is what it looks like.

282
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And the cables go really continent to continent.

283
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
It's a very powerful system,

284
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and most of our communications consist of it.

285
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
So this is the system that I'm talking about,

286
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
off the west coast. It's coincident with the tectonic plate,

287
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
the Juan de Fuca tectonic plate.

288
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And it's going to deliver abundant power

289
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and unprecedented bandwidth

290
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
across this entire volume --

291
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
in the overlying ocean,

292
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
on the sea floor and below the sea floor.

293
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Bandwidth and power

294
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and a wide variety of processes

295
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that will be operating.

296
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
This is what one of those primary nodes looks like,

297
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and it's like a sub station with power and bandwidth

298
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that can spread out over an area the size of Seattle.

299
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And the kind of science that can be done

300
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
will be determined by a variety of scientists who want to be involved

301
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and can bring the instrumentation to the table.

302
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
They will bring it and link it in.

303
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It'll be, in a sense, like having time on a telescope,

304
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
except you'll have your own port.

305
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Climate change, ocean acidification,

306
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
dissolved oxygen,

307
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
carbon cycle, coastal upwelling,

308
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
fishing dynamics --

309
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
the full spectrum of

310
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
earth science and ocean science

311
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
simultaneously in the same volume.

312
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So anyone coming along later

313
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
simply accesses the database

314
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and can draw down the information they need

315
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
about anything that has taken place.

316
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And this is just the first of these.

317
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
In conjunction with our Canadian colleagues, we've set this up.

318
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Now I want to take you into the caldera.

319
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
On the left hand side there

320
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
is a large volcano called Axial Seamount.

321
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And we're going to go down into the Axial Seamount

322
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
using animation.

323
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Here's what this system is going to look like

324
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
that we are funded to build at this point.

325
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Very powerful.

326
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
That's an elevator that's constantly moving up and down,

327
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
but it can be controlled by the folks on land

328
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
who are responsible for it.

329
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Or they can transfer control

330
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
to someone in India or China

331
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
who can take over for a while,

332
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
because it's all going to be directly connected

333
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
through the Internet.

334
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
There will be massive amounts of data flowing ashore,

335
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
all available to anyone who has any interest in using it.

336
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
This is going to be much more powerful

337
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
than having a single ship

338
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
in a single location,

339
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
then move to a new location.

340
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
We're flying across the caldera floor.

341
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
There is a number of robotic systems.

342
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
There's cameras that can be turned on and off at your will,

343
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
if those are your experiments.

344
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
The kinds of systems that will be down there,

345
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
the kinds of instruments that will be on the sea floor,

346
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
consist of -- if you can read them there --

347
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
there's cameras, there's pressure sensors,

348
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
fluorometers, there's seismometers.

349
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
It's a full spectrum of tools.

350
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Now, that mound right there

351
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
actually looks like this.

352
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
This is what it actually looks like.

353
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And this is the kind of activity

354
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that we can see with high-definition video,

355
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
because the bandwidth of these cables

356
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
is so huge

357
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that we could have five to 10

358
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
stereo HD systems

359
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
running continuously

360
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and, again, directed through robotic techniques from land.

361
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Very, very powerful.

362
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And these are the things that we're funded to do today.

363
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
So what can we actually do tomorrow?

364
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
We're about to ride the wave

365
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
of technological opportunity.

366
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
There are emerging technologies throughout

367
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
the field around oceanography,

368
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
which we will incorporate into oceanography,

369
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
and through that convergence,

370
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
we will transform oceanography into something even more magical.

371
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Robotics systems are just incredible these days,

372
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
absolutely incredible.

373
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And we will be bringing robotics of all sorts

374
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
into the ocean.

375
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Nanotechnology: this is a small generator.

376
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
It's smaller than a postage stamp,

377
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and it can generate power just by being

378
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
attached to your shirt as you move.

379
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Just as you move, it generates power.

380
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
There are many kinds of things that can be used in the ocean, continuously.

381
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Imaging: Many of you know a good deal more about this type of thing than I,

382
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
but stereo imaging at four times the definition

383
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
that we have in HD

384
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
will be routine within five years.

385
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
And this is the magic one.

386
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
As a result of the human genome process,

387
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
we are in a situation where

388
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
events that take place in the ocean --

389
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
like an erupting volcano, or something of that sort --

390
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
can actually be sampled.

391
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
We pump the fluid through one of these systems,

392
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and we press the button,

393
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and it's analyzed for the genomic character.

394
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
And that's transmitted back to land immediately.

395
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
So in the volume of the ocean,

396
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
we will know, not just the physics and the chemistry,

397
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
but the base of the food chain

398
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
will be transparent to us

399
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
with data on a continuous basis.

400
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
Grid computing: the power of grid computers

401
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
is going to be just amazing here.

402
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
We will soon be using grid computing

403
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
to do pretty much everything, like adjust the data

404
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and everything

405
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
that goes with the data.

406
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
The power generation will come from the ocean itself.

407
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
And the next generation fiber

408
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
will be simply magic.

409
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
It's far beyond what we currently have.

410
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
So the presence of the power

411
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and the bandwidth in the environment

412
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
will allow all of these new technologies

413
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
to converge in a manner that is just unprecedented.

414
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
So within five to seven years,

415
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
I see us having

416
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
a capacity to be completely present

417
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
throughout the ocean

418
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and have all of that connected to the Internet,

419
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
so we can reach many, many folks.

420
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Delivering the power and the bandwidth into the ocean

421
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
will dramatically accelerate adaptation.

422
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Here's an example.

423
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
When earthquakes take place, massive amounts

424
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
of these new microbes we've never seen before

425
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
come out of the sea floor.

426
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
We have a way of addressing that,

427
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
a new way of addressing that.

428
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
We've determined from the earthquake activity that you're seeing here

429
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
that the top of that volcano is erupting,

430
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
so we deploy the troops.

431
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
What are the troops? The troops are the autonomous vehicles, of course.

432
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
And they fly into the erupting volcano.

433
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
They sample the fluids coming out of the sea floor

434
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
during an eruption,

435
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
which have the microbes that have never been

436
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
to the surface of the planet before.

437
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
They eject it to the surface where it floats,

438
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and it is picked up

439
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
by an autonomous airplane,

440
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
and it's brought back to the laboratory

441
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
within 24 hours of the eruption.

442
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
This is doable. All the pieces are there.

443
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
A laboratory: many of you heard what happened

444
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
on 9/7.

445
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Some doctors in New York City removed

446
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
the gallbladder of a woman in France.

447
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
We could do work on the sea floor that would be stunning,

448
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
and it would be on live TV,

449
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
if we have interesting things to show.

450
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:54,000
So we can bring an entirely new telepresence

451
0:18:54.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
to the world, throughout the ocean.

452
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:18:59,000
This -- I've shown you sea floor --

453
0:18:59.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
but so the goal here is real time interaction

454
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
with the oceans from anywhere on earth.

455
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
It's going to be amazing.

456
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:11,000
And as I go here,

457
0:19:11.26,000 --> 0:19:14,000
I just want to show you what we can bring into classrooms,

458
0:19:14.26,000 --> 0:19:17,000
and indeed, what we can bring into your pocket.

459
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:22,000
Many of you don't think of this yet,

460
0:19:22.26,000 --> 0:19:24,000
but the ocean will be in your pocket.

461
0:19:24.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
It won't be long. It won't be long.

462
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
So let me leave you then

463
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:33,000
with a few words

464
0:19:33.26,000 --> 0:19:36,000
from another poet, if you'll forgive me.

465
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:41,000
In 1943,

466
0:19:41.26,000 --> 0:19:43,000
T.S. Eliot wrote the "Four Quartets."

467
0:19:43.26,000 --> 0:19:45,000
He won the Nobel Prize for literature

468
0:19:45.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
in 1948.

469
0:19:48.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
In "Little Gidding" he says --

470
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
speaking I think for the human race,

471
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:55,000
but certainly for the TED Conference and Sylvia --

472
0:19:56.26,000 --> 0:19:59,000
"We shall not cease from exploration,

473
0:19:59.26,000 --> 0:20:01,000
and the end of all our exploring

474
0:20:01.26,000 --> 0:20:03,000
will be to arrive where we started

475
0:20:03.26,000 --> 0:20:06,000
and know the place for the first time,

476
0:20:06.26,000 --> 0:20:09,000
arrive through the unknown remembered gate

477
0:20:09.26,000 --> 0:20:12,000
where the last of earth left to discover

478
0:20:12.26,000 --> 0:20:15,000
is that which was the beginning.

479
0:20:15.26,000 --> 0:20:18,000
At the source of the longest river

480
0:20:18.26,000 --> 0:20:21,000
the voice of a hidden waterfall

481
0:20:21.26,000 --> 0:20:25,000
not known because not looked for,

482
0:20:25.26,000 --> 0:20:29,000
but heard, half heard

483
0:20:29.26,000 --> 0:20:33,000
in the stillness beneath the waves of the sea."

484
0:20:33.26,000 --> 0:20:35,000
Thank you.

485
0:20:35.26,000 --> 0:20:42,000
(Applause)

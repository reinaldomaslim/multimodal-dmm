1
0:00:12.741,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Sleep.

2
0:00:14.383,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It's something we spend about a third of our lives doing,

3
0:00:17.204,000 --> 0:00:2,000
but do any of us really understand what it's all about?

4
0:00:20.525,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Two thousand years ago, Galen,

5
0:00:22.74,000 --> 0:00:24,000
one of the most prominent medical researchers

6
0:00:24.88,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of the ancient world,

7
0:00:25.939,000 --> 0:00:27,000
proposed that while we're awake,

8
0:00:28.258,000 --> 0:00:31,000
our brain's motive force, its juice,

9
0:00:31.62,000 --> 0:00:33,000
would flow out to all the other parts of the body,

10
0:00:34.19,000 --> 0:00:38,000
animating them but leaving the brain all dried up,

11
0:00:38.204,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and he thought that when we sleep,

12
0:00:39.82,000 --> 0:00:41,000
all this moisture that filled the rest of the body

13
0:00:42.358,000 --> 0:00:43,000
would come rushing back,

14
0:00:44.102,000 --> 0:00:45,000
rehydrating the brain

15
0:00:45.913,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and refreshing the mind.

16
0:00:48.459,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now, that sounds completely ridiculous to us now,

17
0:00:50.88,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but Galen was simply trying to explain

18
0:00:52.921,000 --> 0:00:53,000
something about sleep

19
0:00:54.528,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that we all deal with every day.

20
0:00:57.185,000 --> 0:00:58,000
See, we all know based on our own experience

21
0:00:59.109,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that when you sleep, it clears your mind,

22
0:01:01.821,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and when you don't sleep,

23
0:01:03.283,000 --> 0:01:05,000
it leaves your mind murky.

24
0:01:06.21,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But while we know a great deal more about sleep now

25
0:01:08.722,000 --> 0:01:09,000
than when Galen was around,

26
0:01:10.526,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we still haven't understood why it is that sleep,

27
0:01:13.406,000 --> 0:01:15,000
of all of our activities, has this incredible

28
0:01:16.035,000 --> 0:01:18,000
restorative function for the mind.

29
0:01:18.754,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So today I want to tell you about

30
0:01:20.254,000 --> 0:01:21,000
some recent research

31
0:01:21.61,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that may shed new light on this question.

32
0:01:24.368,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We've found that sleep may actually be

33
0:01:27.573,000 --> 0:01:29,000
a kind of elegant design solution

34
0:01:29.946,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to some of the brain's most basic needs,

35
0:01:32.523,000 --> 0:01:33,000
a unique way that the brain

36
0:01:34.469,000 --> 0:01:36,000
meets the high demands and the narrow margins

37
0:01:37.292,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that set it apart from all the other organs of the body.

38
0:01:42.291,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So almost all the biology that we observe

39
0:01:45.346,000 --> 0:01:47,000
can be thought of as a series of problems

40
0:01:47.8,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and their corresponding solutions,

41
0:01:49.841,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and the first problem that every organ must solve

42
0:01:53.321,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is a continuous supply of nutrients to fuel

43
0:01:55.819,000 --> 0:01:56,000
all those cells of the body.

44
0:01:57.56,000 --> 0:01:59,000
In the brain, that is especially critical;

45
0:02:00.138,000 --> 0:02:02,000
its intense electrical activity uses up

46
0:02:02.355,000 --> 0:02:04,000
a quarter of the body's entire energy supply,

47
0:02:05.213,000 --> 0:02:06,000
even though the brain accounts

48
0:02:06.843,000 --> 0:02:09,000
for only about two percent of the body's mass.

49
0:02:10.18,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So the circulatory system

50
0:02:11.792,000 --> 0:02:13,000
solves the nutrient delivery problem

51
0:02:14.223,000 --> 0:02:16,000
by sending blood vessels to supply nutrients

52
0:02:16.763,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and oxygen to every corner of our body.

53
0:02:20.106,000 --> 0:02:23,000
You can actually see it in this video here.

54
0:02:23.12,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Here, we're imaging blood vessels

55
0:02:24.702,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in the brain of a living mouse.

56
0:02:27.597,000 --> 0:02:29,000
The blood vessels form a complex network

57
0:02:30.117,000 --> 0:02:32,000
that fills the entire brain volume.

58
0:02:32.465,000 --> 0:02:33,000
They start at the surface of the brain,

59
0:02:34.266,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and then they dive down into the tissue itself,

60
0:02:37.147,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and as they spread out, they supply nutrients

61
0:02:39.508,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and oxygen to each and every cell in the brain.

62
0:02:45.276,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Now, just as every cell requires

63
0:02:48.246,000 --> 0:02:49,000
nutrients to fuel it,

64
0:02:50.137,000 --> 0:02:53,000
every cell also produces waste as a byproduct,

65
0:02:53.277,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and the clearance of that waste

66
0:02:54.823,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is the second basic problem

67
0:02:57.09,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that each organ has to solve.

68
0:02:59.882,000 --> 0:03:01,000
This diagram shows the body's lymphatic system,

69
0:03:02.465,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which has evolved to meet this need.

70
0:03:04.895,000 --> 0:03:06,000
It's a second parallel network of vessels

71
0:03:07.707,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that extends throughout the body.

72
0:03:09.721,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It takes up proteins and other waste

73
0:03:11.678,000 --> 0:03:12,000
from the spaces between the cells,

74
0:03:13.602,000 --> 0:03:15,000
it collects them, and then dumps them into the blood

75
0:03:16.414,000 --> 0:03:18,000
so they can be disposed of.

76
0:03:18.675,000 --> 0:03:19,000
But if you look really closely at this diagram,

77
0:03:20.464,000 --> 0:03:21,000
you'll see something

78
0:03:21.858,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that doesn't make a lot of sense.

79
0:03:24.186,000 --> 0:03:26,000
So if we were to zoom into this guy's head,

80
0:03:26.943,000 --> 0:03:28,000
one of the things that you would see there

81
0:03:29.136,000 --> 0:03:33,000
is that there are no lymphatic vessels in the brain.

82
0:03:33.298,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But that doesn't make a lot of sense, does it?

83
0:03:36.392,000 --> 0:03:39,000
I mean, the brain is this intensely active organ

84
0:03:39.597,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that produces a correspondingly large amount of waste

85
0:03:42.162,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that must be efficiently cleared.

86
0:03:44.739,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And yet, it lacks lymphatic vessels, which means that

87
0:03:47.701,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the approach that the rest of the body takes

88
0:03:49.497,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to clearing away its waste

89
0:03:51.482,000 --> 0:03:54,000
won't work in the brain.

90
0:03:54.491,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So how, then, does the brain solve

91
0:03:56.539,000 --> 0:03:57,000
its waste clearance problem?

92
0:03:58.293,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Well, that seemingly mundane question

93
0:04:01.982,000 --> 0:04:04,000
is where our group first jumped into this story,

94
0:04:05.39,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and what we found

95
0:04:07.411,000 --> 0:04:09,000
as we dove down into the brain,

96
0:04:09.746,000 --> 0:04:11,000
down among the neurons and the blood vessels,

97
0:04:12.637,000 --> 0:04:14,000
was that the brain's solution

98
0:04:14.82,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to the problem of waste clearance,

99
0:04:17.383,000 --> 0:04:18,000
it was really unexpected.

100
0:04:19.2,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It was ingenious,

101
0:04:22.05,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but it was also beautiful.

102
0:04:25.168,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Let me tell you about what we found.

103
0:04:26.835,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So the brain has this large pool

104
0:04:29.389,000 --> 0:04:32,000
of clean, clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid.

105
0:04:32.85,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We call it the CSF.

106
0:04:34.169,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The CSF fills the space that surrounds the brain,

107
0:04:38.149,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and wastes from inside the brain

108
0:04:39.672,000 --> 0:04:41,000
make their way out to the CSF,

109
0:04:41.894,000 --> 0:04:44,000
which gets dumped, along with the waste, into the blood.

110
0:04:45.157,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So in that way, it sounds a lot like

111
0:04:46.277,000 --> 0:04:48,000
the lymphatic system, doesn't it?

112
0:04:48.869,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But what's interesting is that the fluid and the waste

113
0:04:51.625,000 --> 0:04:52,000
from inside the brain,

114
0:04:53.357,000 --> 0:04:55,000
they don't just percolate their way randomly

115
0:04:55.764,000 --> 0:04:57,000
out to these pools of CSF.

116
0:04:58.138,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Instead, there is a specialized network of plumbing

117
0:05:01.861,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that organizes and facilitates this process.

118
0:05:05.753,000 --> 0:05:07,000
You can see that in these videos.

119
0:05:07.902,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Here, we're again imaging into the brain

120
0:05:10.94,000 --> 0:05:11,000
of living mice.

121
0:05:12.424,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The frame on your left shows

122
0:05:14.347,000 --> 0:05:16,000
what's happening at the brain's surface,

123
0:05:16.406,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and the frame on your right shows

124
0:05:17.97,000 --> 0:05:18,000
what's happening down below the surface of the brain

125
0:05:19.916,000 --> 0:05:2,000
within the tissue itself.

126
0:05:21.639,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We've labeled the blood vessels in red,

127
0:05:23.898,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and the CSF that's surrounding the brain

128
0:05:25.922,000 --> 0:05:26,000
will be in green.

129
0:05:27.745,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now, what was surprising to us

130
0:05:29.545,000 --> 0:05:32,000
was that the fluid on the outside of the brain,

131
0:05:32.796,000 --> 0:05:34,000
it didn't stay on the outside.

132
0:05:35.608,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Instead, the CSF was pumped back into

133
0:05:39.011,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and through the brain

134
0:05:40.884,000 --> 0:05:43,000
along the outsides of the blood vessels,

135
0:05:43.916,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and as it flushed down into the brain

136
0:05:46.3,000 --> 0:05:47,000
along the outsides of these vessels,

137
0:05:48.1,000 --> 0:05:5,000
it was actually helping to clear away,

138
0:05:50.912,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to clean the waste from the spaces

139
0:05:53.353,000 --> 0:05:55,000
between the brain's cells.

140
0:05:56.199,000 --> 0:05:57,000
If you think about it,

141
0:05:58.111,000 --> 0:06:01,000
using the outsides of these blood vessels like this

142
0:06:01.588,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is a really clever design solution,

143
0:06:04.107,000 --> 0:06:06,000
because the brain is enclosed

144
0:06:06.829,000 --> 0:06:07,000
in a rigid skull

145
0:06:08.652,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and it's packed full of cells,

146
0:06:10.755,000 --> 0:06:12,000
so there is no extra space inside it

147
0:06:13.5,000 --> 0:06:16,000
for a whole second set of vessels like the lymphatic system.

148
0:06:17.1,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Yet the blood vessels,

149
0:06:18.359,000 --> 0:06:19,000
they extend from the surface of the brain

150
0:06:20.317,000 --> 0:06:22,000
down to reach every single cell in the brain,

151
0:06:22.926,000 --> 0:06:23,000
which means that fluid

152
0:06:24.164,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that's traveling along the outsides of these vessels

153
0:06:27.46,000 --> 0:06:3,000
can gain easy access to the entire brain's volume,

154
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
so it's actually this really clever way

155
0:06:33.444,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to repurpose one set of vessels, the blood vessels,

156
0:06:37.209,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to take over and replace the function

157
0:06:39.998,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of a second set of vessels, the lymphatic vessels,

158
0:06:43.181,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to make it so you don't need them.

159
0:06:45.592,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And what's amazing is that no other organ

160
0:06:47.909,000 --> 0:06:48,000
takes quite this approach

161
0:06:49.55,000 --> 0:06:52,000
to clearing away the waste from between its cells.

162
0:06:52.61,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This is a solution that is entirely unique to the brain.

163
0:06:58.43,000 --> 0:07:,000
But our most surprising finding

164
0:07:00.698,000 --> 0:07:02,000
was that all of this,

165
0:07:02.801,000 --> 0:07:04,000
everything I just told you about,

166
0:07:05.151,000 --> 0:07:08,000
with all this fluid rushing through the brain,

167
0:07:08.469,000 --> 0:07:12,000
it's only happening in the sleeping brain.

168
0:07:12.653,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Here, the video on the left

169
0:07:14.103,000 --> 0:07:16,000
shows how much of the CSF is moving

170
0:07:16.364,000 --> 0:07:19,000
through the brain of a living mouse while it's awake.

171
0:07:19.97,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It's almost nothing.

172
0:07:21.843,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Yet in the same animal,

173
0:07:23.418,000 --> 0:07:26,000
if we wait just a little while until it's gone to sleep,

174
0:07:26.623,000 --> 0:07:28,000
what we see is that the CSF

175
0:07:29.38,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is rushing through the brain,

176
0:07:31.798,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and we discovered that at the same time

177
0:07:33.958,000 --> 0:07:35,000
when the brain goes to sleep,

178
0:07:36.57,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the brain cells themselves seem to shrink,

179
0:07:39.233,000 --> 0:07:41,000
opening up spaces in between them,

180
0:07:41.27,000 --> 0:07:43,000
allowing fluid to rush through

181
0:07:43.407,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and allowing waste to be cleared out.

182
0:07:46.14,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So it seems that Galen may actually have been

183
0:07:48.654,000 --> 0:07:5,000
sort of on the right track when he wrote about

184
0:07:50.91,000 --> 0:07:52,000
fluid rushing through the brain

185
0:07:53.61,000 --> 0:07:54,000
when sleep came on.

186
0:07:55.252,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Our own research, now it's 2,000 years later,

187
0:07:58.705,000 --> 0:08:,000
suggests that what's happening is that

188
0:08:00.775,000 --> 0:08:02,000
when the brain is awake

189
0:08:02.834,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and is at its most busy,

190
0:08:04.948,000 --> 0:08:06,000
it puts off clearing away the waste

191
0:08:07.31,000 --> 0:08:1,000
from the spaces between its cells until later,

192
0:08:10.381,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and then, when it goes to sleep

193
0:08:12.24,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and doesn't have to be as busy,

194
0:08:14.588,000 --> 0:08:16,000
it shifts into a kind of cleaning mode

195
0:08:17.165,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to clear away the waste

196
0:08:18.852,000 --> 0:08:19,000
from the spaces between its cells,

197
0:08:20.36,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the waste that's accumulated throughout the day.

198
0:08:22.777,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So it's actually a little bit like how you or I,

199
0:08:25.185,000 --> 0:08:28,000
we put off our household chores during the work week

200
0:08:28.267,000 --> 0:08:29,000
when we don't have time to get to it,

201
0:08:29.729,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and then we play catch up on all the cleaning that we have to do

202
0:08:32.99,000 --> 0:08:34,000
when the weekend rolls around.

203
0:08:35.748,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Now, I've just talked a lot about waste clearance,

204
0:08:39.02,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but I haven't been very specific

205
0:08:40.472,000 --> 0:08:41,000
about the kinds of waste

206
0:08:41.866,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that the brain needs to be clearing

207
0:08:44.161,000 --> 0:08:46,000
during sleep in order to stay healthy.

208
0:08:46.704,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The waste product that these recent studies

209
0:08:48.301,000 --> 0:08:5,000
focused most on is amyloid-beta,

210
0:08:50.719,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which is a protein that's made in the brain all the time.

211
0:08:53.914,000 --> 0:08:54,000
My brain's making amyloid-beta right now,

212
0:08:55.772,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and so is yours.

213
0:08:57.93,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But in patients with Alzheimer's disease,

214
0:08:59.932,000 --> 0:09:01,000
amyloid-beta builds up and aggregates

215
0:09:02.531,000 --> 0:09:04,000
in the spaces between the brain's cells,

216
0:09:04.544,000 --> 0:09:07,000
instead of being cleared away like it's supposed to be,

217
0:09:07.97,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and it's this buildup of amyloid-beta

218
0:09:09.98,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that's thought to be one of the key steps

219
0:09:12.193,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in the development of that terrible disease.

220
0:09:14.814,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So we measured how fast amyloid-beta is cleared

221
0:09:17.908,000 --> 0:09:18,000
from the brain when it's awake

222
0:09:19.64,000 --> 0:09:2,000
versus when it's asleep,

223
0:09:21.418,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and we found that indeed,

224
0:09:23.296,000 --> 0:09:24,000
the clearance of amyloid-beta

225
0:09:25.186,000 --> 0:09:29,000
is much more rapid from the sleeping brain.

226
0:09:29.705,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So if sleep, then,

227
0:09:31.384,000 --> 0:09:32,000
is part of the brain's solution

228
0:09:33.342,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to the problem of waste clearance,

229
0:09:35.352,000 --> 0:09:37,000
then this may dramatically change how we think

230
0:09:37.728,000 --> 0:09:39,000
about the relationship between sleep,

231
0:09:39.963,000 --> 0:09:42,000
amyloid-beta, and Alzheimer's disease.

232
0:09:43.319,000 --> 0:09:44,000
A series of recent clinical studies

233
0:09:45.277,000 --> 0:09:46,000
suggest that among patients

234
0:09:47.11,000 --> 0:09:5,000
who haven't yet developed Alzheimer's disease,

235
0:09:50.204,000 --> 0:09:53,000
worsening sleep quality and sleep duration

236
0:09:53.27,000 --> 0:09:55,000
are associated with a greater amount

237
0:09:55.288,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of amyloid-beta building up in the brain,

238
0:09:58.1,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and while it's important to point out

239
0:09:59.967,000 --> 0:10:,000
that these studies don't prove

240
0:10:01.677,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that lack of sleep or poor sleep

241
0:10:03.866,000 --> 0:10:05,000
cause Alzheimer's disease,

242
0:10:06.273,000 --> 0:10:08,000
they do suggest that the failure of the brain

243
0:10:08.883,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to keep its house clean

244
0:10:10.795,000 --> 0:10:12,000
by clearing away waste like amyloid-beta

245
0:10:13.551,000 --> 0:10:14,000
may contribute to the development

246
0:10:15.453,000 --> 0:10:18,000
of conditions like Alzheimer's.

247
0:10:19.07,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So what this new research tells us, then,

248
0:10:20.975,000 --> 0:10:22,000
is that the one thing that all of you

249
0:10:23.302,000 --> 0:10:24,000
already knew about sleep,

250
0:10:24.71,000 --> 0:10:26,000
that even Galen understood about sleep,

251
0:10:27.363,000 --> 0:10:3,000
that it refreshes and clears the mind,

252
0:10:30.434,000 --> 0:10:31,000
may actually be a big part

253
0:10:31.975,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of what sleep is all about.

254
0:10:34.292,000 --> 0:10:35,000
See, you and I, we go to sleep

255
0:10:35.81,000 --> 0:10:36,000
every single night,

256
0:10:37.543,000 --> 0:10:4,000
but our brains, they never rest.

257
0:10:40.546,000 --> 0:10:41,000
While our body is still

258
0:10:42.38,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and our mind is off walking in dreams somewhere,

259
0:10:45.451,000 --> 0:10:46,000
the elegant machinery of the brain

260
0:10:47.127,000 --> 0:10:48,000
is quietly hard at work

261
0:10:49.107,000 --> 0:10:51,000
cleaning and maintaining

262
0:10:51.3,000 --> 0:10:53,000
this unimaginably complex machine.

263
0:10:54.135,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Like our housework,

264
0:10:55.176,000 --> 0:10:57,000
it's a dirty and a thankless job,

265
0:10:57.925,000 --> 0:10:59,000
but it's also important.

266
0:11:00.18,000 --> 0:11:02,000
In your house, if you stop cleaning your kitchen

267
0:11:02.583,000 --> 0:11:03,000
for a month,

268
0:11:04.491,000 --> 0:11:06,000
your home will become completely unlivable

269
0:11:06.93,000 --> 0:11:07,000
very quickly.

270
0:11:08.537,000 --> 0:11:1,000
But in the brain, the consequences

271
0:11:10.625,000 --> 0:11:12,000
of falling behind may be much greater

272
0:11:13.556,000 --> 0:11:15,000
than the embarrassment of dirty countertops,

273
0:11:16.284,000 --> 0:11:18,000
because when it comes to cleaning the brain,

274
0:11:18.848,000 --> 0:11:2,000
it is the very health and function

275
0:11:21.224,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of the mind and the body that's at stake,

276
0:11:24.169,000 --> 0:11:26,000
which is why understanding these

277
0:11:26.41,000 --> 0:11:3,000
very basic housekeeping functions of the brain today

278
0:11:30.682,000 --> 0:11:32,000
may be critical for preventing and treating

279
0:11:33.675,000 --> 0:11:36,000
diseases of the mind tomorrow.

280
0:11:36.703,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Thank you.

281
0:11:38.751,000 --> 0:11:39,000
(Applause)

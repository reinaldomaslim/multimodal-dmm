0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Six years ago,

3
0:00:18.542,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I discovered something that scientists have been wanting to know for years.

4
0:00:23.542,000 --> 0:00:24,000
How do you capture the attention

5
0:00:25.542,000 --> 0:00:28,000
of a roomful of extremely bored teenagers?

6
0:00:29.875,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It turns out all you have to do is mention the word pornography.

7
0:00:33.583,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:34.792,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Let me tell you how I first learned this.

9
0:00:37.125,000 --> 0:00:41,000
In 2012, I was sitting in a crowded room full of high school students

10
0:00:41.167,000 --> 0:00:43,000
who were attending an after-school program in Boston.

11
0:00:43.958,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And my job, as guest speaker for the day,

12
0:00:46.25,000 --> 0:00:49,000
was to inspire them to think about how exciting it would be

13
0:00:49.333,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to have a career in public health.

14
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The problem was,

15
0:00:53.292,000 --> 0:00:54,000
as I looked at their faces,

16
0:00:54.958,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I could see that their eyes were glazing over,

17
0:00:57.583,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and they were just tuning out.

18
0:00:59.792,000 --> 0:01:,000
It didn't even matter that I wore

19
0:01:01.388,000 --> 0:01:04,000
what I thought was my cool outfit that day.

20
0:01:05.083,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I was just losing my audience.

21
0:01:07.583,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So, then one of the two adults who worked for the program said,

22
0:01:11.083,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"Aren't you doing some research about pornography?

23
0:01:13.917,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Maybe tell them about that."

24
0:01:16.708,000 --> 0:01:19,000
All of a sudden, that room full of high school students exploded

25
0:01:20.375,000 --> 0:01:22,000
into laughter, high fives.

26
0:01:22.75,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I think there were some loud hooting noises.

27
0:01:25.75,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And all anyone had done was say that one word -- pornography.

28
0:01:30.125,000 --> 0:01:32,000
That moment would prove to be an important turning point

29
0:01:32.833,000 --> 0:01:34,000
for me and my professional mission of finding solutions

30
0:01:35.542,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to end dating and sexual violence.

31
0:01:38.5,000 --> 0:01:4,000
At that point, I'd been working for more than a decade

32
0:01:41.417,000 --> 0:01:44,000
on this seemingly intractable problem of dating violence.

33
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

34
0:01:48.125,000 --> 0:01:52,000
demonstrate that one in five high school-attending youth

35
0:01:52.708,000 --> 0:01:55,000
experience physical and/or sexual abuse

36
0:01:56.167,000 --> 0:01:58,000
by a dating partner each year in the US.

37
0:01:59.042,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That makes dating violence more prevalent

38
0:02:02.208,000 --> 0:02:04,000
than being bullied on school property,

39
0:02:04.875,000 --> 0:02:06,000
seriously considering suicide,

40
0:02:07.125,000 --> 0:02:08,000
or even vaping,

41
0:02:08.542,000 --> 0:02:1,000
in that same population.

42
0:02:10.792,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But solutions were proving elusive.

43
0:02:13.208,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And I was working with a research team

44
0:02:15.167,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that was hunting for novel answers to the question:

45
0:02:18.333,000 --> 0:02:21,000
What's causing dating abuse, and how do we stop it?

46
0:02:22.69,000 --> 0:02:24,000
One of the research studies that we were working on at the time

47
0:02:25.667,000 --> 0:02:27,000
happened to include a few questions about pornography.

48
0:02:28.667,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And something unexpected was emerging from our findings.

49
0:02:32.542,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Eleven percent of the teen girls in our sample

50
0:02:36.875,000 --> 0:02:38,000
reported that they had been forced or threatened

51
0:02:39.542,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to do sexual things that the perpetrator saw in pornography.

52
0:02:44.75,000 --> 0:02:45,000
That got me curious.

53
0:02:46.292,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Was pornography to blame for any percentage of dating violence?

54
0:02:51.125,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Or was it more like a coincidence that the pornography users

55
0:02:55.042,000 --> 0:02:59,000
also happen to be more likely to be in unhealthy relationships?

56
0:02:59.625,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I investigated by reading everything that I could

57
0:03:02.583,000 --> 0:03:03,000
from the peer-reviewed literature,

58
0:03:04.333,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and by conducting my own research.

59
0:03:06.75,000 --> 0:03:07,000
I wanted to know

60
0:03:08.042,000 --> 0:03:1,000
what kinds of sexually explicit media youth were watching,

61
0:03:10.792,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and how often and why,

62
0:03:12.458,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and see if I could piece together

63
0:03:14.083,000 --> 0:03:16,000
if it was part of the reason that for so many of them

64
0:03:16.833,000 --> 0:03:19,000
dating relationships were apparently unhealthy.

65
0:03:20.375,000 --> 0:03:23,000
As I read, I tried to keep an open mind,

66
0:03:24.042,000 --> 0:03:26,000
even though there were plenty of members of the public

67
0:03:26.625,000 --> 0:03:28,000
who'd already made up their mind about the issue.

68
0:03:29.333,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Why would I keep an open mind about pornography?

69
0:03:33.25,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Well, I'm a trained social scientist,

70
0:03:35.75,000 --> 0:03:37,000
so it's my job to be objective.

71
0:03:38.75,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But I'm also what people call sex-positive.

72
0:03:42.208,000 --> 0:03:45,000
That means that I fully support people's right

73
0:03:45.667,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to enjoy whatever kind of sex life and sexuality they find fulfilling,

74
0:03:50.083,000 --> 0:03:51,000
no matter what it involves,

75
0:03:52.083,000 --> 0:03:55,000
as long as it includes the enthusiastic consent

76
0:03:55.417,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of all parties involved.

77
0:03:57.083,000 --> 0:04:02,000
That said, I personally wasn't inclined towards watching pornography.

78
0:04:02.583,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I'd seen some, didn't really do anything for me.

79
0:04:05.375,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And as a mom of two soon-to-be teenage children,

80
0:04:08.417,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I had my own concerns

81
0:04:10.208,000 --> 0:04:13,000
about what seeing pornography could do to them.

82
0:04:14.292,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I noticed that while there were a lot of people

83
0:04:16.542,000 --> 0:04:17,000
who were denouncing pornography,

84
0:04:18.333,000 --> 0:04:2,000
there were also people who were staunch defenders of it

85
0:04:20.958,000 --> 0:04:21,000
for a variety of reasons.

86
0:04:22.417,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So in my scholarly exploration,

87
0:04:25.458,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I genuinely tried to understand:

88
0:04:28.208,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Was pornography bad for you or was it good for you?

89
0:04:32.625,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Was it misogynist or was it empowering?

90
0:04:36.833,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And there was not one singular answer that emerged clearly.

91
0:04:41.5,000 --> 0:04:44,000
There was one longitudinal study that had me really worried,

92
0:04:44.75,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that showed that teenagers who saw pornography

93
0:04:48.292,000 --> 0:04:51,000
were subsequently more likely to perpetrate sexual violence.

94
0:04:51.667,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But the design of the study

95
0:04:53.208,000 --> 0:04:56,000
didn't allow for definitive causal conclusions.

96
0:04:56.458,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And there were other studies that did not find

97
0:04:59.5,000 --> 0:05:,000
that adolescent pornography use

98
0:05:01.417,000 --> 0:05:03,000
was associated with certain negative outcomes.

99
0:05:04.167,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Even though there were other studies that did find that.

100
0:05:06.917,000 --> 0:05:07,000
But as I spoke to other experts,

101
0:05:08.917,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I felt tremendous pressure to pick a side about pornography.

102
0:05:14.042,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Join one team or the other.

103
0:05:16.167,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I was even told that it was weak-minded of me

104
0:05:19.083,000 --> 0:05:23,000
not to be able to pick out the one correct answer about pornography.

105
0:05:24.042,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And it was complicated,

106
0:05:25.333,000 --> 0:05:27,000
because there is an industry

107
0:05:28.167,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that is capitalizing off of audience's fascination

108
0:05:31.75,000 --> 0:05:35,000
with seeing women, in particular, not just having sex,

109
0:05:36.542,000 --> 0:05:4,000
but being chocked, gagged, slapped,

110
0:05:41.083,000 --> 0:05:44,000
spit upon, ejaculated upon,

111
0:05:44.833,000 --> 0:05:48,000
called degrading names over and over during sex,

112
0:05:48.917,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and not always clearly with their consent.

113
0:05:51.333,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Most people would agree that we have a serious problem

114
0:05:55.042,000 --> 0:05:59,000
with misogyny, sexual violence and rape in this country,

115
0:05:59.208,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and pornography probably isn't helping with any of that.

116
0:06:03.833,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And a critically important problem to me was that

117
0:06:06.917,000 --> 0:06:07,000
for more than a century,

118
0:06:08.5,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the anti-pornography position had been used as a pretext

119
0:06:12.375,000 --> 0:06:15,000
for discriminating against gays and lesbians

120
0:06:16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
or people who have kinks or have fetishes.

121
0:06:18.833,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So I could see why, on the one hand,

122
0:06:20.917,000 --> 0:06:24,000
we might be very worried about the messages that pornography is sending,

123
0:06:25.042,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and on the other hand,

124
0:06:26.375,000 --> 0:06:3,000
why we might be really worried about going overboard indicting it.

125
0:06:30.833,000 --> 0:06:31,000
For the next two years,

126
0:06:32.292,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I looked into every scary, horrifying claim that I could find

127
0:06:37.125,000 --> 0:06:41,000
about the average age at which people first see pornography,

128
0:06:41.583,000 --> 0:06:44,000
or what it does to their brains or their sexuality.

129
0:06:45.083,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Here's what I have to report back.

130
0:06:47.583,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The free, online, mainstream pornography,

131
0:06:51.542,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that's the kind that teenagers are most likely to see,

132
0:06:54.167,000 --> 0:06:58,000
is a completely terrible form of sex education.

133
0:06:58.375,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

134
0:07:03.833,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Applause)

135
0:07:08.167,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But that's not what it was intended for.

136
0:07:12.5,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And it probably is not instantly poisoning their minds

137
0:07:17.042,000 --> 0:07:19,000
or turning them into compulsive users,

138
0:07:19.875,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the way that some ideologues would have you believe.

139
0:07:22.833,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It's a rare person who doesn't see some pornography in their youth.

140
0:07:27.208,000 --> 0:07:29,000
By the time they're 18 years old,

141
0:07:29.5,000 --> 0:07:33,000
93 percent of first year college males and 62 percent of females

142
0:07:34.458,000 --> 0:07:36,000
have seen pornography at least once.

143
0:07:37.208,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And though people like to say

144
0:07:38.875,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that the internet has made pornography ubiquitous,

145
0:07:42.542,000 --> 0:07:45,000
or basically guarantees that any young child

146
0:07:46.167,000 --> 0:07:5,000
who's handed a smartphone is definitely going to see pornography,

147
0:07:50.208,000 --> 0:07:51,000
data don't really support that.

148
0:07:52.042,000 --> 0:07:56,000
A nationally representative study found that in the year 2000

149
0:07:56.458,000 --> 0:07:59,000
16 percent of 10-to-13-year-old youth

150
0:07:59.792,000 --> 0:08:02,000
reported that they'd seen pornography in the past year.

151
0:08:02.875,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And by 2010, that figure had increased.

152
0:08:06.083,000 --> 0:08:07,000
But only to 30 percent.

153
0:08:07.958,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So it wasn't everybody.

154
0:08:10.208,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Our problems with adolescents and sexual violence perpetration

155
0:08:14.417,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is not only because of pornography.

156
0:08:16.75,000 --> 0:08:17,000
In fact, a recent study

157
0:08:18.292,000 --> 0:08:21,000
found that adolescents are more likely to see sexualized images

158
0:08:21.833,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in other kinds of media besides pornography.

159
0:08:25.5,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Think about all those sexualized video games,

160
0:08:28.5,000 --> 0:08:3,000
or TV shows, or music videos.

161
0:08:31.417,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And it could be exposure to a steady stream of violent media

162
0:08:36.625,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that instead of or in addition to the sexualized images

163
0:08:40.75,000 --> 0:08:41,000
is causing our problems.

164
0:08:42.667,000 --> 0:08:47,000
By focusing on the potential harms of pornography alone,

165
0:08:48.457,000 --> 0:08:51,000
we may be distracting ourselves from bigger issues.

166
0:08:52.042,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Or missing root causes of dating and sexual violence,

167
0:08:56.125,000 --> 0:08:58,000
which are the true public health crises.

168
0:08:59.083,000 --> 0:09:01,000
That said, even my own research

169
0:09:01.75,000 --> 0:09:04,000
demonstrates that adolescents are turning to pornography

170
0:09:05.708,000 --> 0:09:07,000
for education and information about sex.

171
0:09:08.417,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And that's because they can't find

172
0:09:10.792,000 --> 0:09:13,000
reliable and factual information elsewhere.

173
0:09:13.917,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Less than 50 percent of the states in the United States

174
0:09:17.292,000 --> 0:09:2,000
require that sex education be taught in schools,

175
0:09:21.125,000 --> 0:09:23,000
including how to prevent coerced sex.

176
0:09:24.083,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And less than half of those states

177
0:09:26.5,000 --> 0:09:3,000
require that the information presented be medically accurate.

178
0:09:32.5,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So in that Boston after-school program,

179
0:09:34.792,000 --> 0:09:36,000
those kids really wanted to talk about sex,

180
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and they really wanted to talk about pornography.

181
0:09:39.542,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And they wanted to talk about those things

182
0:09:41.583,000 --> 0:09:44,000
a whole lot more than they wanted to talk about dating or sexual violence.

183
0:09:45.542,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So we realized,

184
0:09:46.833,000 --> 0:09:5,000
we could cover all of the same topics that we might normally talk about

185
0:09:51.25,000 --> 0:09:53,000
under the guise of healthy relationships education,

186
0:09:54.25,000 --> 0:09:57,000
like, what's a definition of sexual consent?

187
0:09:57.458,000 --> 0:10:,000
Or, how do you know if you're hurting somebody during sex?

188
0:10:01.292,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Or what are healthy boundaries to have when you're flirting?

189
0:10:04.75,000 --> 0:10:07,000
All of these same things we could discuss

190
0:10:07.833,000 --> 0:10:1,000
by using pornography as the jumping-off point

191
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:12,000
for our conversation.

192
0:10:12.542,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It's sort of like when adults give kids a desert like brownies,

193
0:10:16.458,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but they secretly baked a zucchini or something healthy inside of it.

194
0:10:19.75,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Laughter)

195
0:10:21.25,000 --> 0:10:24,000
We could talk to the kids about the healthy stuff,

196
0:10:25.083,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the stuff that's good for you,

197
0:10:26.542,000 --> 0:10:28,000
but hide it inside a conversation that was about something

198
0:10:29.333,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that they thought they wanted to be talking about.

199
0:10:32.458,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We also discovered something

200
0:10:33.875,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that we didn't necessarily set out to find,

201
0:10:36.625,000 --> 0:10:4,000
which is that there's a fantastic way to have a conversation with teenagers

202
0:10:41.292,000 --> 0:10:42,000
about pornography.

203
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And that is,

204
0:10:44.542,000 --> 0:10:47,000
keep the conversation true to science.

205
0:10:47.875,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Admit what we know and what we don't know

206
0:10:50.792,000 --> 0:10:52,000
about the impact of pornography.

207
0:10:52.958,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Talk about where there are mixed results

208
0:10:56.792,000 --> 0:11:,000
or where there are weaknesses in the studies that have been conducted.

209
0:11:01.125,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Invite the adolescents to become critical consumers

210
0:11:04.5,000 --> 0:11:06,000
of the research literature on pornography,

211
0:11:07.125,000 --> 0:11:09,000
as well as the pornography itself.

212
0:11:09.542,000 --> 0:11:12,000
That really fits with adolescent development.

213
0:11:13.25,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Adolescents like to question things

214
0:11:15.875,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and they like to be invited to think for themselves.

215
0:11:19.125,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And we realized by starting to experiment,

216
0:11:22.333,000 --> 0:11:25,000
teaching some classes in consent, respect and pornography,

217
0:11:26.292,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that trying to scare adolescents into a particular point of view

218
0:11:31.667,000 --> 0:11:37,000
or jam a one-sided argument down their throat about pornography

219
0:11:37.875,000 --> 0:11:4,000
not only probably does not work,

220
0:11:41.542,000 --> 0:11:45,000
but really doesn't model the kind of respectful,

221
0:11:45.958,000 --> 0:11:47,000
consensual behavior that we want them to learn.

222
0:11:48.875,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So our approach, what we call pornography literacy,

223
0:11:53.458,000 --> 0:11:56,000
is about presenting the truth about pornography

224
0:11:56.958,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to the best of our knowledge,

225
0:11:58.917,000 --> 0:12:01,000
given that there is an ever-changing evidence base.

226
0:12:02.667,000 --> 0:12:06,000
When people hear that we teach a nine-session, 18-hour class

227
0:12:07.458,000 --> 0:12:09,000
in pornography literacy to teenagers,

228
0:12:09.75,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I think that they either think that we're sitting kids down

229
0:12:12.542,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and trying to show them how to watch pornography,

230
0:12:15.375,000 --> 0:12:17,000
which is not what we do,

231
0:12:17.75,000 --> 0:12:2,000
or that we're part of an anti-pornography activist group

232
0:12:21.125,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that's trying to convince them that if they ever saw pornography,

233
0:12:24.25,000 --> 0:12:26,000
it would be the number one worst thing for their health ever.

234
0:12:27.167,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And that's not it, either.

235
0:12:28.708,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Our secret ingredient is that we're nonjudgmental.

236
0:12:32.875,000 --> 0:12:35,000
We don't think that youth should be watching pornography.

237
0:12:36.333,000 --> 0:12:4,000
But, above all, we want them to become critical thinkers

238
0:12:40.875,000 --> 0:12:42,000
if and when they do see it.

239
0:12:43.125,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And we've learned,

240
0:12:44.417,000 --> 0:12:47,000
from the number of requests for our curriculum and our training,

241
0:12:47.875,000 --> 0:12:49,000
from across the US and beyond,

242
0:12:50.625,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that there are a lot of parents and a lot of teachers

243
0:12:54.083,000 --> 0:12:57,000
who really do want to be having these more nuanced

244
0:12:57.708,000 --> 0:13:,000
and realistic conversations with teenagers about pornography.

245
0:13:01.625,000 --> 0:13:05,000
We've had requests from Utah to Vermont,

246
0:13:06.542,000 --> 0:13:08,000
to Alabama, to Hawaii.

247
0:13:09.917,000 --> 0:13:11,000
So in that after-school program,

248
0:13:12.5,000 --> 0:13:16,000
what I saw, is that from the minute we mentioned the word pornography,

249
0:13:16.917,000 --> 0:13:19,000
those kids were ready to jump in to a back-and-forth

250
0:13:20.167,000 --> 0:13:23,000
about what they did and didn't want to see in pornography,

251
0:13:24.167,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and what they did and didn't want to do during sex.

252
0:13:27.667,000 --> 0:13:29,000
And what was degrading to women

253
0:13:30.083,000 --> 0:13:33,000
or unfair to men or racist, all of it.

254
0:13:33.708,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And they made some really sophisticated points.

255
0:13:36.417,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Exactly the kinds of things that we would want them to be talking about

256
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
as violence prevention activists.

257
0:13:43.042,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And as teachers, we might leave the class one day and think,

258
0:13:47.542,000 --> 0:13:5,000
"It is really sad that there's that one boy in our class

259
0:13:51.25,000 --> 0:13:55,000
who thinks that all women have orgasms from anal sex."

260
0:13:56.667,000 --> 0:13:59,000
And we might leave class the next week and think,

261
0:13:59.958,000 --> 0:14:03,000
"I'm really glad that there's that one kid in our class who's gay,

262
0:14:04.083,000 --> 0:14:09,000
who said that seeing his sexuality represented in pornography

263
0:14:09.583,000 --> 0:14:1,000
saved his life."

264
0:14:11.208,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Or, "There's that one girl in our class

265
0:14:13.75,000 --> 0:14:16,000
who said that she's feeling a lot better about her body,

266
0:14:17.167,000 --> 0:14:22,000
because she saw someone shaped like her as the object of desire

267
0:14:22.375,000 --> 0:14:23,000
in some tame pornography."

268
0:14:25.417,000 --> 0:14:3,000
So this is where I find myself as a violence prevention activist.

269
0:14:30.542,000 --> 0:14:33,000
I find myself talking about and researching pornography.

270
0:14:35.042,000 --> 0:14:36,000
And though it would be easier

271
0:14:36.5,000 --> 0:14:38,000
if things in life were all one way or the other,

272
0:14:38.833,000 --> 0:14:41,000
what I've found in my conversations with teenagers about pornography

273
0:14:42.833,000 --> 0:14:46,000
is that they remain engaged in these conversations

274
0:14:47.083,000 --> 0:14:51,000
because we allow them to grapple with the complexities.

275
0:14:51.875,000 --> 0:14:54,000
And because we're honest about the science.

276
0:14:56.375,000 --> 0:14:58,000
These adolescents may not be adults yet,

277
0:14:59.375,000 --> 0:15:01,000
but they are living in an adult world.

278
0:15:02.167,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And they're ready for adult conversations.

279
0:15:05.958,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Thank you.

280
0:15:07.25,000 --> 0:15:1,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.738,000 --> 0:00:13,000
This is a vending machine in Los Angeles.

2
0:00:14.746,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It's in a shopping mall, and it sells fish eggs.

3
0:00:17.887,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's a caviar-vending machine.

4
0:00:21.837,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This is the Art-o-mat, an art-vending machine

5
0:00:23.974,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that sells small artistic creations by different artists,

6
0:00:26.708,000 --> 0:00:29,000
usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes, in limited edition.

7
0:00:30.423,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This is Oliver Medvedik.

8
0:00:31.616,000 --> 0:00:34,000
He is not a vending machine, but he is one of the founders of Genspace,

9
0:00:35.136,000 --> 0:00:36,000
a community biolab in Brooklyn, New York,

10
0:00:37.127,000 --> 0:00:38,000
where anybody can go and take classes

11
0:00:38.922,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark

12
0:00:42.1,000 --> 0:00:43,000
or learn how to take strawberry DNA.

13
0:00:43.876,000 --> 0:00:46,000
In fact, I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions

14
0:00:46.951,000 --> 0:00:49,000
about a year ago, and this is what led me into this bizarre path

15
0:00:50.012,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that I'm going to talk to you right now.

16
0:00:51.978,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Strawberry DNA is really fascinating, because it's so beautiful.

17
0:00:55.048,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I'd never thought about DNA being a beautiful thing before,

18
0:00:57.856,000 --> 0:00:58,000
before I saw it in this form.

19
0:00:59.271,000 --> 0:01:01,000
A lot of people, especially in the art community,

20
0:01:01.597,000 --> 0:01:03,000
don't necessarily engage in science in this way.

21
0:01:03.867,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I instantly joined Genspace after this,

22
0:01:05.766,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and asked Oliver, "If we can do this with strawberries,

23
0:01:08.374,000 --> 0:01:09,000
can we do this with people?"

24
0:01:09.785,000 --> 0:01:11,000
About 10 minutes later, we were both spitting in vials,

25
0:01:12.438,000 --> 0:01:14,000
coming up with a protocol for human DNA extraction.

26
0:01:14.98,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I started doing this on my own.

27
0:01:16.507,000 --> 0:01:17,000
This is what my DNA actually looks like.

28
0:01:18.493,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And I was at a dinner party with some artist friends,

29
0:01:21.068,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and I was telling them about this project,

30
0:01:23.111,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and they couldn't believe that you could actually see DNA.

31
0:01:25.853,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So I said, all right, let's get out some supplies right now.

32
0:01:28.709,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And I started having these bizarre dinner parties on Friday nights,

33
0:01:31.885,000 --> 0:01:33,000
where people would come over and we'd do DNA extractions,

34
0:01:34.582,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and I would capture them on video,

35
0:01:36.25,000 --> 0:01:38,000
because it created this kind of funny portrait as well.

36
0:01:38.956,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:41.469,000 --> 0:01:44,000
These are people who don't necessarily regularly engage with science.

38
0:01:44.894,000 --> 0:01:46,000
You can kind of tell from their reactions.

39
0:01:47.083,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:48.906,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But they became fascinated by it,

41
0:01:50.534,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science.

42
0:01:53.985,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And so I started doing this regularly.

43
0:01:56.139,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

44
0:01:57.736,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It's an odd thing to do with your Friday nights,

45
0:02:00.039,000 --> 0:02:01,000
but this is what I started doing.

46
0:02:01.642,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I started collecting a whole group of my friends' DNA in small vials

47
0:02:04.883,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and categorizing them.

48
0:02:06.084,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This is what that looked like.

49
0:02:07.553,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And it started to make me think about a couple of things.

50
0:02:10.291,000 --> 0:02:12,000
First, this looked a lot like my Facebook wall.

51
0:02:12.523,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So in a way, I created sort of a genetic social network.

52
0:02:15.735,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And the second thing was,

53
0:02:16.994,000 --> 0:02:18,000
one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table

54
0:02:19.807,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and was like, "Uh ... why are they numbered?

55
0:02:22.024,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Is this person more rare than the other one?"

56
0:02:24.325,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And I hadn't even thought about that.

57
0:02:26.135,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They were just numbered

58
0:02:27.319,000 --> 0:02:29,000
because that was the order that I extracted the DNA in.

59
0:02:29.954,000 --> 0:02:31,000
But that made me think about collecting toys,

60
0:02:32.088,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and what's going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys,

61
0:02:35.327,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and being able to collect these rare toys.

62
0:02:37.41,000 --> 0:02:39,000
You buy these boxes, but aren't sure what's going to be inside.

63
0:02:40.431,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But when you open them, you have different rarities of the toys.

64
0:02:43.462,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I thought that was interesting; I thought about this

65
0:02:45.925,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and the caviar vending machine and the Art-o-mat all together.

66
0:02:48.858,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And for some reason, I was one night drawing a vending machine,

67
0:02:51.84,000 --> 0:02:53,000
thinking of doing paintings of a vending machine.

68
0:02:54.199,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The vial of my DNA was sitting there,

69
0:02:56.003,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and I saw a beautiful collaboration between the strands of DNA

70
0:02:58.953,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and the coils of a vending machine.

71
0:03:00.65,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So I decided to create an art installation called the DNA Vending Machine.

72
0:03:04.171,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Here it is.

73
0:03:05.429,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Music)

74
0:03:10.53,000 --> 0:03:12,000
[DNA Vending Machine is an art installation

75
0:03:12.612,000 --> 0:03:14,000
about our increasing access to biotechnology.]

76
0:03:14.838,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Music)

77
0:03:19.455,000 --> 0:03:21,000
[For a reasonable cost, you can purchase a sample of human DNA

78
0:03:22.437,000 --> 0:03:23,000
from a traditional vending machine.]

79
0:03:26.719,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Music)

80
0:03:45.451,000 --> 0:03:46,000
[Each sample comes packaged

81
0:03:46.789,000 --> 0:03:49,000
with a collectible limited edition portrait of the human specimen.]

82
0:03:50.009,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Music)

83
0:03:55.37,000 --> 0:03:57,000
[DNA Vending Machine treats DNA as a collectible material

84
0:03:58.127,000 --> 0:04:,000
and brings to light legal issues over the ownership of DNA.]

85
0:04:00.967,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Music ends)

86
0:04:05.313,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Gabriel Barcia-Colombo:

87
0:04:06.488,000 --> 0:04:09,000
The DNA Vending Machine is currently in a couple of galleries in New York,

88
0:04:10.025,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and it's selling out pretty well.

89
0:04:11.648,000 --> 0:04:12,000
We're in the first edition of 100 pieces,

90
0:04:13.66,000 --> 0:04:14,000
hoping to do another edition pretty soon.

91
0:04:15.638,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I'd like to get it into more of a metro hub,

92
0:04:17.741,000 --> 0:04:18,000
like Grand Central or Penn Station,

93
0:04:19.448,000 --> 0:04:21,000
next to some of the other vending machines in that location.

94
0:04:22.322,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But really, with this and a lot of my art projects,

95
0:04:24.727,000 --> 0:04:25,000
I want to ask the audience a question:

96
0:04:26.583,000 --> 0:04:29,000
When biotechnology and DNA sequencing becomes as cheap as, say, laser cutting

97
0:04:30.429,000 --> 0:04:33,000
or 3D printing or buying caviar from a vending machine,

98
0:04:34.339,000 --> 0:04:37,000
will you submit your sample of DNA to be part of the vending machine?

99
0:04:37.663,000 --> 0:04:38,000
How much will these samples be worth?

100
0:04:39.474,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Will you buy someone else's sample?

101
0:04:41.363,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And what will you be able to do with that sample?

102
0:04:45.096,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Thank you.

103
0:04:46.294,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Applause)

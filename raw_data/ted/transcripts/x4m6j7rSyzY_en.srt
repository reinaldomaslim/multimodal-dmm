1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Clearly, we're living in a moment of crisis.

2
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Arguably the financial markets have failed us

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and the aid system is failing us,

4
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and yet I stand firmly with the optimists

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
who believe that there has probably never been a more exciting moment to be alive.

6
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Because of some of technologies we've been talking about.

7
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Because of the resources, the skills,

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and certainly the surge of talent we're seeing all around the world,

9
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
with the mindset to create change.

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And we've got a president who sees himself as a global citizen,

11
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
who recognizes that no longer is there a single superpower,

12
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
but that we've got to engage in a different way with the world.

13
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And by definition, every one of you who is in this room

14
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
must consider yourself a global soul,

15
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a global citizen.

16
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
You work on the front lines. And you've seen the best and the worst

17
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that human beings can do for one another and to one another.

18
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And no matter what country you live or work in,

19
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
you've also seen the extraordinary things that individuals are capable of,

20
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
even in their most ordinariness.

21
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Today there is a raging debate

22
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
as to how best we lift people out of poverty,

23
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
how best we release their energies.

24
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
On the one hand, we have people that say

25
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the aid system is so broken we need to throw it out.

26
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And on the other we have people who say

27
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
the problem is that we need more aid.

28
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And what I want to talk about is something that compliments both systems.

29
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
We call it patient capital.

30
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The critics point to the 500 billion dollars spent

31
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:46,000
in Africa since 1970

32
0:01:46.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and say, and what do we have but environmental degradation

33
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and incredible levels of poverty, rampant corruption?

34
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
They use Mobutu as metaphor.

35
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
And their policy prescription is to

36
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
make government more accountable,

37
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
focus on the capital markets,

38
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
invest, don't give anything away.

39
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
On the other side, as I said, there are those who say

40
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the problem is that we need more money.

41
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
That when it comes to the rich, we'll bail out

42
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and we'll hand a lot of aid,

43
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but when it comes to our poor brethren,

44
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
we want little to do with it.

45
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
They point to the successes of aid:

46
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the eradication of smallpox,

47
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and the distribution of tens of millions

48
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
of malaria bed nets and antiretrovirals.

49
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Both sides are right.

50
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And the problem is that neither side is listening to the other.

51
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Even more problematic, they're not listening to

52
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
poor people themselves.

53
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
After 25 years of working on issues of

54
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
poverty and innovation,

55
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
it's true that there are probably no more market-oriented

56
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
individuals on the planet

57
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
than low-income people.

58
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
They must navigate markets daily,

59
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
making micro-decisions, dozens and dozens,

60
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to move their way through society,

61
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and yet if a single catastrophic health problem

62
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
impacts their family,

63
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
they could be put back into poverty, sometimes for generations.

64
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And so we need both the market

65
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and we need aid.

66
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Patient capital works between,

67
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and tries to take the best of both.

68
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It's money that's invested in entrepreneurs who know their communities

69
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and are building solutions

70
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to healthcare, water, housing, alternative energy,

71
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
thinking of low income people not as passive recipients of charity,

72
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but as individual customers, consumers, clients,

73
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
people who want to make decisions in their own lives.

74
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Patient capital requires that we have

75
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
incredible tolerance for risk,

76
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
a long time horizon in terms of allowing those

77
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
entrepreneurs time to experiment,

78
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to use the market as the best listening device that we have,

79
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and the expectation of below-market returns,

80
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but outsized social impact.

81
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It recognizes that the market has its limitation,

82
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and so patient capital also works

83
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
with smart subsidy to extend the benefits of a global economy

84
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to include all people.

85
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Now, entrepreneurs need patient capital

86
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
for three reasons.

87
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
First, they tend to work in markets

88
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
where people make one, two, three dollars a day

89
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and they are making all of their decisions within that income level.

90
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Second, the geographies in which they work

91
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
have terrible infrastructure --

92
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
no roads to speak of, sporadic electricity

93
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and high levels of corruption.

94
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Third, they are often creating markets.

95
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Even if you're bringing clean water

96
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
for the first time into rural villages, it is something new.

97
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And so many low-income people

98
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
have seen so many failed promises broken

99
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and seen so many quacks and sporadic medicines offered to them

100
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that building trust takes a lot of time,

101
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
takes a lot of patience.

102
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It also requires being connected to a lot of management assistance.

103
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Not only to build the systems,

104
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the business models that allow us

105
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to reach low income people in a sustainable way,

106
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
but to connect those business

107
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
to other markets, to governments, to corporations --

108
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
real partnerships if we want to get to scale.

109
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I want to share one story

110
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
about an innovation called drip irrigation.

111
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
In 2002 I met this incredible entrepreneur

112
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
named Amitabha Sadangi from India,

113
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
who'd been working for 20 years with some of the poorest farmers on the planet.

114
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And he was expressing his frustration

115
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that the aid market had bypassed low-income farmers altogether,

116
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
despite the fact that 200 million farmers

117
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:36,000
alone in India make under a dollar a day.

118
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
They were creating subsidies

119
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
either for large farms,

120
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
or they were giving inputs to the farmers

121
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that they thought they should use, rather than

122
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that the farmers wanted to use.

123
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
At the same time Amitabha was

124
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
obsessed with this drip irrigation technology

125
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that had been invented in Israel.

126
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
It was a way of bringing small amounts of water

127
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
directly to the stalk of the plant.

128
0:05:59.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And it could transform

129
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
swaths of desert land into fields of emerald green.

130
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
But the market also had bypassed low income farmers,

131
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
because these systems were both too expensive,

132
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and they were constructed for fields that were too large.

133
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
The average small village farmer

134
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
works on two acres or less.

135
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And so, Amitabha decided that he would take that innovation

136
0:06:21.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and he would redesign it from the perspective

137
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
of the poor farmers themselves,

138
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
because he spent so many years listening to what they needed

139
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
not what he thought that they should have.

140
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And he used three fundamental principles.

141
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The first one was miniaturization.

142
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The drip irrigation system

143
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
had to be small enough that a farmer only had

144
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to risk a quarter acre,

145
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
even if he had two,

146
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
because it was too frightening, given all that he had at stake.

147
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Second, it had to be extremely affordable.

148
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
In other words, that risk on the quarter acre

149
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
needed to be repaid in a single harvest,

150
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
or else they wouldn't take the risk.

151
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And third, it had to be what Amitabha calls

152
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
infinitely expandable.

153
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
What I mean is with the profits from the first quarter acre,

154
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the farmers could buy a second

155
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and a third and a fourth.

156
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
As of today, IDE India, Amitabha's organization,

157
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
has sold over 300,000 farmers these systems

158
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and has seen their yields and incomes

159
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
double or triple on average,

160
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
but this didn't happen overnight.

161
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
In fact, when you go back to the beginning,

162
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
there were no private investors

163
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
who would be willing to take a risk on building a new technology

164
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
for a market class that made under a dollar a day,

165
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that were known to be some of the most risk-averse people on the planet

166
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and that were working in one of the riskiest sectors, agriculture.

167
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And so we needed grants. And he used significant grants

168
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
to research, to experiment, to fail,

169
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to innovate and try again.

170
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And when he had a prototype

171
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and had a better understanding of how to market to farmers,

172
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
that's when patient capital could come in.

173
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And we helped him build a company, for profit,

174
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
that would build on IDE's knowledge,

175
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and start looking at sales and exports,

176
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and be able to tap into other kinds of capital.

177
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Secondarily, we wanted to see if we could export

178
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
this drip irrigation and bring it into other countries.

179
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And so we met Dr. Sono Khangharani in Pakistan.

180
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And while, again, you needed patience

181
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
to move a technology for the poor

182
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in India into Pakistan,

183
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
just to get the permits,

184
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
over time we were able to start a company

185
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
with Dr. Sono, who runs a large

186
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
community development organization in the Thar Desert,

187
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
which is one of the remote and poorest areas of the country.

188
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
And though that company has just started,

189
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
our assumption is that there too

190
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
we'll see the impact on millions.

191
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But drip irrigation isn't the only innovation.

192
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
We're starting to see these happening all around the world.

193
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
In Arusha, Tanzania, A to Z Textile Manufacturing

194
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
has worked in partnership with us,

195
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
with UNICEF, with the Global Fund,

196
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
to create a factory that now employs 7,000 people, mostly women.

197
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And they produce 20 million lifesaving bednets

198
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
for Africans around the world.

199
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Lifespring Hospital

200
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is a joint venture between Acumen and the government of India

201
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
to bring quality, affordable maternal health care

202
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
to low-income women,

203
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and it's been so successful that it's currently building

204
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
a new hospital every 35 days.

205
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And 1298 Ambulances decided that it was going to

206
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
reinvent a completely broken industry,

207
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
building an ambulance service in Bombay

208
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
that would use the technology of Google Earth,

209
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
a sliding scale pricing system

210
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:39,000
so that all people could have access,

211
0:09:39.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and a severe and public decision

212
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
not to engage in any form of corruption.

213
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
So that in the terrorist attacks of November

214
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
they were the first responder,

215
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and are now beginning to scale, because of partnership.

216
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
They've just won four government contracts to build off their 100 ambulances,

217
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and are one of the largest and most effective ambulance companies

218
0:09:59.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
in India.

219
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
This idea of scale is critical.

220
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Because we're starting to see these enterprises

221
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
reach hundreds of thousands of people. All of the ones I discussed

222
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
have reached at least a quarter million people.

223
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But that's obviously not enough.

224
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And it's where the idea of partnership

225
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
becomes so important.

226
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Whether it's by finding those innovations

227
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that can access the capital markets,

228
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
government itself, or partner with major corporations,

229
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
there is unbelievable opportunity for innovation.

230
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
President Obama understands that.

231
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
He recently authorized the creation of a Social Innovation Fund

232
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to focus on what works in this country,

233
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and look at how we can scale it.

234
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And I would submit that it's time to consider

235
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
a global innovation fund

236
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that would find these entrepreneurs around the world

237
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
who really have innovations, not only for their country,

238
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
but ones that we can use in the developed world as well.

239
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Invest financial assistance, but also management assistance.

240
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And then measure the returns,

241
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
both from a financial perspective

242
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
and from a social impact perspective.

243
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
When we think about new approaches to aid,

244
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
it's impossible not to talk about Pakistan.

245
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We've had a rocky relationship with that country

246
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and, in all fairness,

247
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
the United States has not always been a very reliable partner.

248
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
But again I would say that this is our moment

249
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
for extraordinary things to happen.

250
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And if we take that notion of a global innovation fund,

251
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
we could use this time to invest

252
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
not directly in government, though we would have government's blessing,

253
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
nor in international experts,

254
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
but in the many existing entrepreneurs

255
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and civil society leaders

256
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
who already are building wonderful innovations

257
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that are reaching people all across the country.

258
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
People like Rashani Zafar,

259
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
who created one of the largest microfinance banks in the country,

260
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and is a real role model for women inside and outside the country.

261
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And Tasneem Siddiqui, who developed a way

262
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
called incremental housing,

263
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
where he has moved 40,000 slum dwellers

264
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
into safe, affordable community housing.

265
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Educational initiatives like DIL and The Citizen Foundation

266
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
that are building schools across the country.

267
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It's not hyperbole

268
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
to say that these civil society institutions

269
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and these social entrepreneurs

270
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
are building real alternatives to the Taliban.

271
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
I've invested in Pakistan for over seven years now,

272
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and those of you who've also worked there

273
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
can attest that Pakistanis are an incredibly hard working population,

274
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and there is a fierce upward mobility in their very nature.

275
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
President Kennedy said that

276
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
those who make peaceful revolution impossible

277
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
make violent revolution inevitable.

278
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I would say that the converse is true.

279
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
That these social leaders

280
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
who really are looking at innovation

281
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and extending opportunity

282
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
to the 70 percent of Pakistanis who make less than two dollars a day,

283
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
provide real pathways to hope.

284
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And as we think about how we construct aid for Pakistan,

285
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:59,000
while we need to strengthen the judiciary,

286
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
build greater stability,

287
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
we also need to think about lifting those leaders

288
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
who can be role models for the rest of the world.

289
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
On one of my last visits to Pakistan,

290
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I asked Dr. Sono if he would take me

291
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to see some of the drip irrigation in the Thar Desert.

292
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And we left Karachi one morning before dawn.

293
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
It was about 115 degrees.

294
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And we drove for eight hours

295
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
along this moonscape-like landscape

296
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
with very little color, lots of heat,

297
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
very little discussion, because we were exhausted.

298
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And finally, at the end of the journey,

299
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I could see this thin little yellow line across the horizon.

300
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And as we got closer, its significance became apparent.

301
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
That there in the desert

302
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
was a field of sunflowers growing seven feet tall.

303
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Because one of the poorest farmers on Earth

304
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
had gotten access to a technology

305
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that had allowed him to change his own life.

306
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
His name was Raja,

307
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and he had kind, twinkly hazel eyes

308
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and warm expressive hands

309
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that reminded me of my father.

310
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And he said it was the first dry season

311
0:14:03.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
in his entire life that he hadn't taken

312
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
his 12 children and 50 grandchildren

313
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
on a two day journey across the desert

314
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to work as day laborers at a commercial farm

315
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
for about 50 cents a day.

316
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Because he was building these crops.

317
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And with the money he earned he could stay this year.

318
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And for the first time ever in three generations,

319
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
his children would go to school.

320
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
We asked him if he would send his daughters as well as his sons.

321
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And he said, "Of course I will.

322
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
Because I don't want them discriminated against anymore."

323
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
When we think about solutions to poverty,

324
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
we cannot deny individuals

325
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
their fundamental dignity.

326
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Because at the end of the day,

327
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
dignity is more important to the human spirit than wealth.

328
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And what's exciting is to see so many entrepreneurs across sectors

329
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
who are building innovations that recognize

330
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
that what people want is freedom

331
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
and choice and opportunity.

332
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Because that is where dignity really starts.

333
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Martin Luther King said that

334
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
love without power is anemic and sentimental,

335
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
and that power without love

336
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
is reckless and abusive.

337
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Our generation has seen both approaches tried,

338
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and often fail.

339
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
But I think our generation also might be the first

340
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to have the courage to embrace both love and power.

341
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
For that is what we'll need, as we move forward

342
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
to dream and imagine what it will really take

343
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
to build a global economy that includes all of us,

344
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and to finally extend that fundamental proposition

345
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
that all men are created equal to every human being on the planet.

346
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
The time for us to begin innovating

347
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and looking for new solutions, a cross sector, is now.

348
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
I can only talk from my own experience,

349
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
but in eight years of running Acumen fund,

350
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
I've seen the power of patient capital.

351
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
Not only to inspire innovation and risk taking,

352
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
but to truly build systems that have created

353
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
more than 25,000 jobs

354
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and delivered tens of millions of services and products

355
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to some of the poorest people on the planet.

356
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I know it works.

357
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
But I know that many other kinds of innovation also work.

358
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And so I urge you, in whatever sector you work,

359
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
in whatever job you do,

360
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
to start thinking about how we might

361
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
build solutions that start

362
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
from the perspective of those we're trying to help.

363
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Rather than what we think that they might need.

364
0:16:32.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
It will take embracing the world with both arms.

365
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And it will take living with the spirit of generosity and accountability,

366
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
with a sense of integrity and perseverance.

367
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
And yet these are the very qualities

368
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
for which men and women have been honored

369
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
throughout the generations.

370
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:53,000
And there is so much good that we can do.

371
0:16:53.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Just think of all those sunflowers in the desert.

372
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Thank you.

373
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000

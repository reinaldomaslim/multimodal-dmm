1
0:00:12.758,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In 2012, when I painted the minaret of Jara Mosque

2
0:00:17.025,000 --> 0:00:19,000
in my hometown of Gabés, in the south of Tunisia,

3
0:00:19.98,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I never thought that graffiti would bring so much attention to a city.

4
0:00:25.271,000 --> 0:00:28,000
At the beginning, I was just looking for a wall in my hometown,

5
0:00:29.221,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and it happened that the minaret was built in '94.

6
0:00:33.102,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And for 18 years, those 57 meters of concrete stayed grey.

7
0:00:38.617,000 --> 0:00:41,000
When I met the imam for the first time, and I told him what I wanted to do,

8
0:00:42.242,000 --> 0:00:44,000
he was like, "Thank God you finally came,"

9
0:00:44.71,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and he told me that for years he was waiting for somebody

10
0:00:47.541,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to do something on it.

11
0:00:49.422,000 --> 0:00:53,000
The most amazing thing about this imam is that he didn't ask me anything --

12
0:00:53.532,000 --> 0:00:56,000
neither a sketch, or what I was going to write.

13
0:00:57.959,000 --> 0:00:59,000
In every work that I create, I write messages

14
0:01:00.856,000 --> 0:01:04,000
with my style of calligraffiti -- a mix of calligraphy and graffiti.

15
0:01:05.622,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I use quotes or poetry.

16
0:01:08.153,000 --> 0:01:1,000
For the minaret, I thought that the most relevant message

17
0:01:10.884,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to be put on a mosque should come from the Quran,

18
0:01:13.524,000 --> 0:01:14,000
so I picked this verse:

19
0:01:15.159,000 --> 0:01:18,000
"Oh humankind, we have created you from a male and a female,

20
0:01:18.423,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and made you people and tribe, so you may know each other."

21
0:01:21.862,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It was a universal call for peace, tolerance, and acceptance

22
0:01:25.203,000 --> 0:01:28,000
coming from the side that we don't usually portray in a good way in the media.

23
0:01:29.661,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I was amazed to see how the local community reacted to the painting,

24
0:01:33.453,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and how it made them proud to see the minaret getting so much attention

25
0:01:37.784,000 --> 0:01:39,000
from international press all around the world.

26
0:01:41.346,000 --> 0:01:43,000
For the imam, it was not just the painting;

27
0:01:43.538,000 --> 0:01:44,000
it was really deeper than that.

28
0:01:45.427,000 --> 0:01:48,000
He hoped that this minaret would become a monument for the city,

29
0:01:48.888,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and attract people to this forgotten place of Tunisia.

30
0:01:52.759,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The universality of the message,

31
0:01:54.933,000 --> 0:01:56,000
the political context of Tunisia at this time,

32
0:01:57.203,000 --> 0:02:,000
and the fact that I was writing Quran in a graffiti way

33
0:02:00.711,000 --> 0:02:01,000
were not insignificant.

34
0:02:02.377,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It reunited the community.

35
0:02:05.559,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Bringing people, future generations,

36
0:02:08.573,000 --> 0:02:11,000
together through Arabic calligraphy

37
0:02:11.573,000 --> 0:02:12,000
is what I do.

38
0:02:13.082,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Writing messages is the essence of my artwork.

39
0:02:16.896,000 --> 0:02:19,000
What is funny, actually, is that even Arabic-speaking people

40
0:02:20.071,000 --> 0:02:23,000
really need to focus a lot to decipher what I'm writing.

41
0:02:24.668,000 --> 0:02:26,000
You don't need to know the meaning to feel the piece.

42
0:02:28.012,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I think that Arabic script touches your soul before it reaches your eyes.

43
0:02:31.757,000 --> 0:02:34,000
There is a beauty in it that you don't need to translate.

44
0:02:35.628,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Arabic script speaks to anyone, I believe;

45
0:02:37.93,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to you, to you, to you, to anybody,

46
0:02:41.471,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and then when you get the meaning,

47
0:02:43.431,000 --> 0:02:45,000
you feel connected to it.

48
0:02:45.435,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I always make sure to write messages

49
0:02:47.806,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that are relevant to the place where I'm painting,

50
0:02:50.201,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but messages that have a universal dimension,

51
0:02:53.306,000 --> 0:02:55,000
so anybody around the world can connect to it.

52
0:02:56.699,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I was born and raised in France, in Paris,

53
0:02:59.05,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and I started learning how to write and read Arabic when I was 18.

54
0:03:03.56,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Today I only write messages in Arabic.

55
0:03:07.084,000 --> 0:03:1,000
One of the reasons this is so important to me,

56
0:03:10.305,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is because of all the reaction that I've experienced all around the world.

57
0:03:15.7,000 --> 0:03:18,000
In Rio de Janeiro, I translated this Portuguese poem

58
0:03:19.63,000 --> 0:03:2,000
from Gabriela Tôrres Barbosa,

59
0:03:21.566,000 --> 0:03:24,000
who was giving an homage to the poor people of the favela,

60
0:03:24.97,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and then I painted it on the rooftop.

61
0:03:27.367,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The local community were really intrigued by what I was doing,

62
0:03:30.304,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but as soon as I gave them the meaning of the calligraphy,

63
0:03:33.921,000 --> 0:03:35,000
they thanked me, as they felt connected to the piece.

64
0:03:38.723,000 --> 0:03:39,000
In South Africa, in Cape Town,

65
0:03:40.737,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the local community of Philippi

66
0:03:43.81,000 --> 0:03:46,000
offered me the only concrete wall of the slum.

67
0:03:46.881,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It was a school, and I wrote on it

68
0:03:49.278,000 --> 0:03:5,000
a quote from Nelson Mandela,

69
0:03:50.77,000 --> 0:03:52,000
saying, "[in Arabic],"

70
0:03:53.457,000 --> 0:03:55,000
which means, "It seems impossible until it's done."

71
0:03:56.489,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Then this guy came to me and said, "Man, why you don't write in English?"

72
0:04:00.098,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and I replied to him, "I would consider your concern legit if you asked me

73
0:04:04.217,000 --> 0:04:05,000
why I didn't write in Zulu."

74
0:04:06.912,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In Paris, once, there was this event,

75
0:04:09.08,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and someone gave his wall to be painted.

76
0:04:14.016,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And when he saw I was painting in Arabic,

77
0:04:16.397,000 --> 0:04:2,000
he got so mad -- actually, hysterical -- and he asked for the wall to be erased.

78
0:04:20.445,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I was mad and disappointed.

79
0:04:22.436,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But a week later, the organizer of the event asked me to come back,

80
0:04:26.337,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and he told me that there was a wall right in front of this guy's house.

81
0:04:30.079,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So, this guy --

82
0:04:31.255,000 --> 0:04:33,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:33.498,000 --> 0:04:35,000
like, was forced to see it every day.

84
0:04:35.547,000 --> 0:04:37,000
At the beginning, I was going to write, "[In Arabic],"

85
0:04:38.555,000 --> 0:04:39,000
which means, "In your face," but --

86
0:04:40.57,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:42.937,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I decided to be smarter and I wrote, "[In Arabic],"

88
0:04:46.62,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which means, "Open your heart."

89
0:04:49.095,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I'm really proud of my culture,

90
0:04:52.195,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and I'm trying to be an ambassador of it through my artwork.

91
0:04:57.734,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And I hope that I can break the stereotypes we all know,

92
0:05:02.694,000 --> 0:05:03,000
with the beauty of Arabic script.

93
0:05:05.207,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Today, I don't write the translation of the message anymore on the wall.

94
0:05:11.148,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I don't want the poetry of the calligraphy to be broken,

95
0:05:14.849,000 --> 0:05:17,000
as it's art and you can appreciate it without knowing the meaning,

96
0:05:18.054,000 --> 0:05:21,000
as you can enjoy any music from other countries.

97
0:05:21.63,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Some people see that as a rejection or a closed door,

98
0:05:25.429,000 --> 0:05:27,000
but for me, it's more an invitation --

99
0:05:27.922,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to my language, to my culture, and to my art.

100
0:05:31.225,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Thank you.

101
0:05:32.407,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Applause)

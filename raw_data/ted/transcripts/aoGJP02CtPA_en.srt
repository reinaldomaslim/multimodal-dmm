1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Today, I want you to look at

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
children who become suicide bombers

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
through a completely different lens.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
In 2009, there were 500

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
bomb blasts across Pakistan.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I spent the year working

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
with children

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
who were training to become suicide bombers

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and with Taliban recruiters,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
trying to understand how the Taliban

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
were converting these children

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
into live ammunition

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and why these children were actively

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
signing up to their cause.

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I want you to watch a short video

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
from my latest documentary film, "Children of the Taliban."

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
(Singing)

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The Taliban now run their own schools.

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They target poor families

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and convince the parents to send their children.

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
In return, they provide free food and shelter

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and sometimes pay the families a monthly stipend.

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
We've obtained a propaganda video

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
made by the Taliban.

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Young boys are taught justifications

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
for suicide attacks

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the execution of spies.

28
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I made contact with a child from Swat

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
who studied in a madrassa like this.

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Hazrat Ali is from a

31
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
poor farming family in Swat.

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
He joined the Taliban a year ago

33
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
when he was 13.

34
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
How do the Taliban in your area get people to join them?

35
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Hazrat Ali: They first call us to the mosque and preach to us.

36
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Then they take us to a madrassa

37
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and teach us things from the Koran.

38
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy: He tells me that children

39
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
are then given months of military training.

40
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
HA: They teach us to use machine guns, Kalashnikov,

41
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
rocket launchers, grenades, bombs.

42
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They ask us to use them only against the infidels.

43
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Then they teach us to do a suicide attack.

44
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
SOC: Would you like to carry out a suicide attack?

45
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
HA: If God gives me strength.

46
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
SOC: I, in my research,

47
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
have seen that the Taliban have perfected

48
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the way in which they recruit

49
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and train children,

50
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and I think it's a five-step process.

51
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Step one is that the Taliban prey

52
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
on families that are large, that are poor,

53
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that live in rural areas.

54
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
They separate the parents from the children

55
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
by promising to provide food, clothing,

56
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
shelter to these children.

57
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Then they ship them off, hundreds of miles away

58
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to hard-line schools

59
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that run along the Taliban agenda.

60
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Step two:

61
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They teach the children the Koran, which is Islam's holiest book,

62
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in Arabic, a language these children do not understand

63
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and cannot speak.

64
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
They rely very heavily on teachers,

65
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
who I have personally seen

66
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
distort the message to these children

67
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
as and when it suits their purpose to.

68
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
These children are explicitly forbidden

69
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
from reading newspapers, listening to radio,

70
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
reading any books

71
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that the teachers do not prescribe them.

72
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
If any child is found violating these rules,

73
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
he is severely reprimanded.

74
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Effectively, the Taliban create

75
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
a complete blackout

76
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of any other source of information for these children.

77
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Step three: The Taliban want these children

78
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to hate the world that they currently live in.

79
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So they beat these children --

80
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I have seen it;

81
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
they feed them twice a day dried bread and water;

82
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
they rarely allow them to play games;

83
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
they tell them that, for eight hours at a time,

84
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
all they have to do is read the Koran.

85
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The children are virtual prisoners;

86
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
they cannot leave, they cannot go home.

87
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Their parents are so poor,

88
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
they have no resources to get them back.

89
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Step four: The older members of the Taliban,

90
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
the fighters,

91
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
start talking to the younger boys

92
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
about the glories of martyrdom.

93
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They talk to them about how when they die,

94
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
they will be received up

95
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
with lakes of honey and milk,

96
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
how there will be 72 virgins

97
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
waiting for them in paradise,

98
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
how there will be unlimited food,

99
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and how this glory

100
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is going to propel them to become

101
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
heroes in their neighborhoods.

102
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Effectively, this is the brainwashing process

103
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that has begun.

104
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Step five: I believe the Taliban have

105
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
one of the most effective

106
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
means of propaganda.

107
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Their videos that they use

108
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
are intercut with photographs

109
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
of men and women and children

110
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
dying in Iraq and Afghanistan

111
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and in Pakistan.

112
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And the basic message is that the Western powers

113
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
do not care about civilian deaths,

114
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
so those people who live

115
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in areas and support governments

116
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that work with Western powers are fair game.

117
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
That's why Pakistani civilians,

118
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
over 6,000 of whom have been killed in the last two years alone,

119
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
are fair game.

120
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Now these children are primed

121
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to become suicide bombers.

122
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
They're ready to go out and fight

123
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
because they've been told that this is

124
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
effectively their only way

125
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to glorify Islam.

126
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I want you to watch another excerpt from the film.

127
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
This boy is called Zenola.

128
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
He blew himself up, killing six.

129
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
This boy is called Sadik.

130
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
He killed 22.

131
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This boy is called Messoud.

132
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
He killed 28.

133
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The Taliban are running suicide schools,

134
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
preparing a generation of boys

135
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
for atrocities against civilians.

136
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Do you want to carry out a suicide attack?

137
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Boy: I would love to.

138
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But only if I get permission from my dad.

139
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
When I look at suicide bombers younger than me, or my age,

140
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I get so inspired by their terrific attacks.

141
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
SOC: What blessing would you get

142
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
from carrying out a suicide attack?

143
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Boy: On the day of judgment, God will ask me,

144
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
"Why did you do that?"

145
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I will answer, "My Lord! Only to make you happy!

146
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I have laid down my life fighting the infidels."

147
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Then God will look at my intention.

148
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
If my intention was to eradicate evil for Islam,

149
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
then I will be rewarded with paradise.

150
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000

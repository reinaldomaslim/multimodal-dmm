1
0:00:13.52,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Hannah is excited to be going to college.

2
0:00:16.96,000 --> 0:00:18,000
She couldn't wait to get out of her parents' house,

3
0:00:19.76,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to prove to them that she's an adult,

4
0:00:21.8,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and to prove to her new friends that she belongs.

5
0:00:25.36,000 --> 0:00:26,000
She heads to a campus party

6
0:00:26.96,000 --> 0:00:28,000
where she sees a guy that she has a crush on.

7
0:00:29.52,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Let's call him Mike.

8
0:00:32.44,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The next day, Hannah wakes up with a pounding headache.

9
0:00:37.28,000 --> 0:00:39,000
She can only remember the night in flashes.

10
0:00:40.48,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But what she does remember is

11
0:00:42.2,000 --> 0:00:44,000
throwing up in the hall outside Mike's room

12
0:00:46.44,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and staring at the wall silently while he was inside her,

13
0:00:49.56,000 --> 0:00:5,000
wanting it to stop,

14
0:00:51.52,000 --> 0:00:52,000
then shakily stumbling home.

15
0:00:54.856,000 --> 0:00:56,000
She doesn't feel good about what happened,

16
0:00:56.88,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but she thinks, "Maybe this is just what sex in college is?"

17
0:01:01.84,000 --> 0:01:05,000
One in five women and one in 13 men will be sexually assaulted

18
0:01:06.08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
at some point during their college career in the United States.

19
0:01:11.52,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Less than 10 percent will ever report their assault to their school

20
0:01:15.96,000 --> 0:01:16,000
or to the police.

21
0:01:17.48,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And those who do, on average, wait 11 months to make the report.

22
0:01:24.04,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Hannah initially just feels like dealing with what happened on her own.

23
0:01:27.76,000 --> 0:01:29,000
But when she sees Mike taking girls home from parties,

24
0:01:30.36,000 --> 0:01:31,000
she's worried about them.

25
0:01:32.6,000 --> 0:01:34,000
After graduation, Hannah learns

26
0:01:34.88,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that she was one of five women who Mike did the exact same thing to.

27
0:01:40.84,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And this is not an unlikely scenario

28
0:01:43.28,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because 90 percent of sexual assaults

29
0:01:46.36,000 --> 0:01:48,000
are committed by repeat offenders.

30
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But with such low reporting rates,

31
0:01:50.84,000 --> 0:01:53,000
it's fairly unlikely that even repeat perpetrators will be reported,

32
0:01:54.68,000 --> 0:01:56,000
much less anything happen if they are.

33
0:01:57.24,000 --> 0:02:02,000
In fact, only six percent of assaults reported to the police

34
0:02:02.4,000 --> 0:02:04,000
end with the assailant spending a single day in prison.

35
0:02:05.68,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Meaning, there's a 99 percent chance that they'll get away with it.

36
0:02:11.4,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This means there's practically no deterrent to assault

37
0:02:14.84,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in the United States.

38
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Now, I'm an infectious disease epidemiologist by training.

39
0:02:21.52,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I'm interested in systems and networks

40
0:02:24.64,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and where we can concentrate our resources to do the most good.

41
0:02:29.2,000 --> 0:02:34,000
So this, to me, is a tragic but a solvable problem.

42
0:02:35.28,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So when the issue of campus assault started hitting the news a few years ago,

43
0:02:39.44,000 --> 0:02:42,000
it felt like a unique opportunity to make a change.

44
0:02:42.84,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And so we did.

45
0:02:44.56,000 --> 0:02:46,000
We started by talking to college survivors.

46
0:02:47.36,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And what they wish they'd had in college is pretty simple;

47
0:02:50.88,000 --> 0:02:51,000
they wanted a website,

48
0:02:52.44,000 --> 0:02:54,000
one they could use at the time and place

49
0:02:54.6,000 --> 0:02:55,000
that felt safest to them

50
0:02:56.8,000 --> 0:02:59,000
with clearly written information about their reporting options,

51
0:03:00.8,000 --> 0:03:03,000
with the ability to electronically report their assault,

52
0:03:03.96,000 --> 0:03:04,000
rather than having the first step

53
0:03:05.6,000 --> 0:03:07,000
to go in and talk to someone who may or may not believe them.

54
0:03:09.08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
With the option to create a secure, timestamped document

55
0:03:12.4,000 --> 0:03:13,000
of what happened to them,

56
0:03:13.92,000 --> 0:03:16,000
preserving evidence even if they don't want to report yet.

57
0:03:17.56,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And lastly, and perhaps most critically,

58
0:03:20.56,000 --> 0:03:22,000
with the ability to report their assault

59
0:03:22.6,000 --> 0:03:25,000
only if someone else reported the same assailant.

60
0:03:26.92,000 --> 0:03:29,000
You see, knowing that you weren't the only one changes everything.

61
0:03:30.08,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It changes the way you frame your own experience,

62
0:03:32.44,000 --> 0:03:34,000
it changes the way you think about your perpetrator,

63
0:03:34.92,000 --> 0:03:35,000
it means that if you do come forward,

64
0:03:36.76,000 --> 0:03:39,000
you'll have someone else's back and they'll have yours.

65
0:03:40.84,000 --> 0:03:42,000
We created a website that actually does this

66
0:03:43.36,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and we launched it [...] in August,

67
0:03:46.4,000 --> 0:03:47,000
on two college campuses.

68
0:03:48.6,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And we included a unique matching system

69
0:03:51.52,000 --> 0:03:53,000
where if Mike's first victim had come forward,

70
0:03:54.48,000 --> 0:03:56,000
saved her record, entered into the matching system

71
0:03:57.28,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and named Mike,

72
0:03:58.56,000 --> 0:04:,000
and Mike's second victim had done the same thing

73
0:04:00.96,000 --> 0:04:01,000
a few months later,

74
0:04:02.64,000 --> 0:04:03,000
they would have matched

75
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and the verified contact information of both survivors

76
0:04:07.52,000 --> 0:04:09,000
would have been sent to the authorities at the same time

77
0:04:10.28,000 --> 0:04:12,000
for investigation and follow up.

78
0:04:13.6,000 --> 0:04:16,000
If a system like this had existed for Hannah and her peers,

79
0:04:17.32,000 --> 0:04:19,000
it's more likely that they would have reported,

80
0:04:19.88,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that they would have been believed,

81
0:04:21.68,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and that Mike would have been kicked off campus,

82
0:04:23.96,000 --> 0:04:26,000
gone to jail, or at least gotten the help that he needed.

83
0:04:27.92,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And if we were able to stop repeat offenders like Mike

84
0:04:31.44,000 --> 0:04:34,000
after just their second assault following a match,

85
0:04:35.08,000 --> 0:04:37,000
survivors like Hannah would never even be assaulted

86
0:04:37.72,000 --> 0:04:38,000
in the first place.

87
0:04:39.76,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We could prevent 59 percent of sexual assaults

88
0:04:43.88,000 --> 0:04:46,000
just by stopping repeat perpetrators earlier on.

89
0:04:48.08,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And because we're creating a real deterrent to assault,

90
0:04:50.8,000 --> 0:04:52,000
for perhaps the first time,

91
0:04:52.96,000 --> 0:04:55,000
maybe the Mikes of the world would never even try to assault anyone.

92
0:04:58.64,000 --> 0:04:59,000
The type of system I'm describing,

93
0:05:00.64,000 --> 0:05:02,000
the type of system that survivors want

94
0:05:03.04,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is a type of information escrow,

95
0:05:05.6,000 --> 0:05:08,000
meaning an entity that holds on to information for you

96
0:05:08.84,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and only releases it to a third party

97
0:05:11.32,000 --> 0:05:13,000
when certain pre-agreed upon conditions are met,

98
0:05:13.92,000 --> 0:05:14,000
such as a match.

99
0:05:15.6,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The application that we built is for college campuses.

100
0:05:19.36,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But the same type of system could be used in the military

101
0:05:22.44,000 --> 0:05:23,000
or even the workplace.

102
0:05:25.72,000 --> 0:05:27,000
We don't have to live in a world

103
0:05:28.28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
where 99 percent of rapists get away with it.

104
0:05:32.12,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We can create one

105
0:05:33.56,000 --> 0:05:35,000
where those who do wrong are held accountable,

106
0:05:36.52,000 --> 0:05:39,000
where survivors get the support and justice they deserve,

107
0:05:39.96,000 --> 0:05:41,000
where the authorities get the information they need,

108
0:05:42.88,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and where there's a real deterrent

109
0:05:44.8,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to violating the rights of another human being.

110
0:05:49.12,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Thank you.

111
0:05:50.36,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:13.149,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I have spent my entire life

3
0:00:16.872,000 --> 0:00:2,000
either at the schoolhouse, on the way to the schoolhouse,

4
0:00:21.197,000 --> 0:00:23,000
or talking about what happens in the schoolhouse.

5
0:00:23.82,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:24.943,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Both my parents were educators,

7
0:00:27.255,000 --> 0:00:3,000
my maternal grandparents were educators,

8
0:00:30.505,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and for the past 40 years, I've done the same thing.

9
0:00:34.346,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And so, needless to say, over those years

10
0:00:36.712,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I've had a chance to look at education reform

11
0:00:40.228,000 --> 0:00:41,000
from a lot of perspectives.

12
0:00:42.059,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Some of those reforms have been good.

13
0:00:44.012,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Some of them have been not so good.

14
0:00:46.282,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And we know why kids drop out.

15
0:00:48.479,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We know why kids don't learn.

16
0:00:49.958,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It's either poverty, low attendance,

17
0:00:52.875,000 --> 0:00:54,000
negative peer influences...

18
0:00:55.251,000 --> 0:00:56,000
We know why.

19
0:00:56.888,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But one of the things that we never discuss

20
0:00:59.235,000 --> 0:01:01,000
or we rarely discuss

21
0:01:01.547,000 --> 0:01:05,000
is the value and importance of human connection.

22
0:01:05.839,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Relationships.

23
0:01:08.076,000 --> 0:01:11,000
James Comer says that no significant learning

24
0:01:11.674,000 --> 0:01:13,000
can occur without a significant relationship.

25
0:01:14.873,000 --> 0:01:16,000
George Washington Carver says all learning

26
0:01:17.247,000 --> 0:01:21,000
is understanding relationships.

27
0:01:21.354,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Everyone in this room has been affected by a teacher or an adult.

28
0:01:26.946,000 --> 0:01:3,000
For years, I have watched people teach.

29
0:01:31.516,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I have looked at the best and I've looked at some of the worst.

30
0:01:34.898,000 --> 0:01:35,000
A colleague said to me one time,

31
0:01:36.72,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"They don't pay me to like the kids.

32
0:01:39.243,000 --> 0:01:4,000
They pay me to teach a lesson.

33
0:01:40.832,000 --> 0:01:41,000
The kids should learn it.

34
0:01:42.085,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I should teach it, they should learn it,

35
0:01:44.015,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Case closed."

36
0:01:45.929,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Well, I said to her,

37
0:01:48.203,000 --> 0:01:51,000
"You know, kids don't learn from people they don't like."

38
0:01:51.307,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:53.626,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Applause)

40
0:01:59.22,000 --> 0:02:02,000
She said, "That's just a bunch of hooey."

41
0:02:02.625,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And I said to her,

42
0:02:03.672,000 --> 0:02:07,000
"Well, your year is going to be long and arduous, dear."

43
0:02:08.086,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Needless to say, it was.

44
0:02:09.577,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Some people think that you can either have it in you to build a relationship,

45
0:02:13.363,000 --> 0:02:14,000
or you don't.

46
0:02:15.084,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I think Stephen Covey had the right idea.

47
0:02:17.174,000 --> 0:02:2,000
He said you ought to just throw in a few simple things,

48
0:02:20.716,000 --> 0:02:22,000
like seeking first to understand,

49
0:02:23.021,000 --> 0:02:24,000
as opposed to being understood.

50
0:02:25.479,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Simple things, like apologizing.

51
0:02:28.366,000 --> 0:02:29,000
You ever thought about that?

52
0:02:29.724,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Tell a kid you're sorry, they're in shock.

53
0:02:31.904,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:33.092,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I taught a lesson once on ratios.

55
0:02:35.521,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I'm not real good with math, but I was working on it.

56
0:02:38.546,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:39.712,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And I got back and looked at that teacher edition.

58
0:02:42.518,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I'd taught the whole lesson wrong.

59
0:02:44.346,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:45.674,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So I came back to class the next day and I said,

61
0:02:47.992,000 --> 0:02:49,000
"Look, guys, I need to apologize.

62
0:02:50.224,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I taught the whole lesson wrong. I'm so sorry."

63
0:02:54.07,000 --> 0:02:55,000
They said, "That's okay, Ms. Pierson.

64
0:02:55.923,000 --> 0:02:56,000
You were so excited, we just let you go."

65
0:03:02.95,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I have had classes that were so low,

66
0:03:07.418,000 --> 0:03:09,000
so academically deficient, that I cried.

67
0:03:10.831,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I wondered, "How am I going to take this group,

68
0:03:13.807,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in nine months,

69
0:03:15.878,000 --> 0:03:17,000
from where they are to where they need to be?

70
0:03:18.529,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And it was difficult, it was awfully hard.

71
0:03:22.202,000 --> 0:03:24,000
How do I raise the self-esteem of a child

72
0:03:24.703,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and his academic achievement at the same time?

73
0:03:27.726,000 --> 0:03:29,000
One year I came up with a bright idea.

74
0:03:29.792,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I told all my students,

75
0:03:31.637,000 --> 0:03:34,000
"You were chosen to be in my class

76
0:03:35.278,000 --> 0:03:36,000
because I am the best teacher

77
0:03:36.826,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and you are the best students,

78
0:03:38.372,000 --> 0:03:39,000
they put us all together

79
0:03:39.817,000 --> 0:03:41,000
so we could show everybody else how to do it."

80
0:03:43.382,000 --> 0:03:44,000
One of the students said, "Really?"

81
0:03:45.291,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:47.575,000 --> 0:03:49,000
I said, "Really. We have to show the other classes

83
0:03:50.598,000 --> 0:03:52,000
how to do it, so when we walk down the hall,

84
0:03:53.058,000 --> 0:03:55,000
people will notice us, so you can't make noise.

85
0:03:55.609,000 --> 0:03:56,000
You just have to strut."

86
0:03:57.243,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

87
0:03:58.46,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And I gave them a saying to say:

88
0:04:00.136,000 --> 0:04:01,000
"I am somebody.

89
0:04:01.428,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I was somebody when I came.

90
0:04:02.793,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I'll be a better somebody when I leave.

91
0:04:04.717,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I am powerful, and I am strong.

92
0:04:06.71,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I deserve the education that I get here.

93
0:04:09.4,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I have things to do, people to impress,

94
0:04:11.792,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and places to go."

95
0:04:13.564,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And they said, "Yeah!"

96
0:04:14.808,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:16.336,000 --> 0:04:17,000
You say it long enough,

98
0:04:17.756,000 --> 0:04:19,000
it starts to be a part of you.

99
0:04:21.189,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Applause)

100
0:04:28.01,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I gave a quiz, 20 questions.

101
0:04:31.786,000 --> 0:04:32,000
A student missed 18.

102
0:04:34.625,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I put a "+2" on his paper and a big smiley face.

103
0:04:37.951,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:39.528,000 --> 0:04:42,000
He said, "Ms. Pierson, is this an F?"

105
0:04:43.276,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I said, "Yes."

106
0:04:44.632,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

107
0:04:45.902,000 --> 0:04:48,000
He said, "Then why'd you put a smiley face?"

108
0:04:49.081,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I said, "Because you're on a roll.

109
0:04:51.329,000 --> 0:04:53,000
You got two right. You didn't miss them all."

110
0:04:54.214,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

111
0:04:55.401,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I said, "And when we review this, won't you do better?"

112
0:04:58.82,000 --> 0:05:,000
He said, "Yes, ma'am, I can do better."

113
0:05:01.349,000 --> 0:05:04,000
You see, "-18" sucks all the life out of you.

114
0:05:04.981,000 --> 0:05:06,000
"+2" said, "I ain't all bad."

115
0:05:12.999,000 --> 0:05:18,000
For years, I watched my mother take the time at recess to review,

116
0:05:19.062,000 --> 0:05:21,000
go on home visits in the afternoon,

117
0:05:21.894,000 --> 0:05:23,000
buy combs and brushes and peanut butter and crackers

118
0:05:24.653,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to put in her desk drawer for kids that needed to eat,

119
0:05:27.387,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and a washcloth and some soap for the kids who didn't smell so good.

120
0:05:30.65,000 --> 0:05:32,000
See, it's hard to teach kids who stink.

121
0:05:32.936,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:34.323,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And kids can be cruel.

123
0:05:36.827,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And so she kept those things in her desk,

124
0:05:39.403,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and years later, after she retired,

125
0:05:42.928,000 --> 0:05:44,000
I watched some of those same kids come through

126
0:05:45.545,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and say to her, "You know, Ms. Walker,

127
0:05:47.529,000 --> 0:05:48,000
you made a difference in my life.

128
0:05:50.044,000 --> 0:05:51,000
You made it work for me.

129
0:05:51.28,000 --> 0:05:53,000
You made me feel like I was somebody,

130
0:05:53.318,000 --> 0:05:56,000
when I knew, at the bottom, I wasn't.

131
0:05:56.705,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And I want you to just see what I've become."

132
0:05:58.832,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And when my mama died two years ago at 92,

133
0:06:01.955,000 --> 0:06:04,000
there were so many former students at her funeral,

134
0:06:05.159,000 --> 0:06:07,000
it brought tears to my eyes, not because she was gone,

135
0:06:07.873,000 --> 0:06:1,000
but because she left a legacy of relationships

136
0:06:11.28,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that could never disappear.

137
0:06:13.788,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Can we stand to have more relationships?

138
0:06:17.535,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Absolutely.

139
0:06:18.714,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Will you like all your children? Of course not.

140
0:06:21.848,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:23.126,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And you know your toughest kids are never absent.

142
0:06:27.048,000 --> 0:06:28,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:29.041,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Never.

144
0:06:30.681,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You won't like them all,

145
0:06:32.139,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and the tough ones show up for a reason.

146
0:06:35.549,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's the connection. It's the relationships.

147
0:06:44.23,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So teachers become great actors and great actresses,

148
0:06:48.021,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and we come to work when we don't feel like it,

149
0:06:50.284,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and we're listening to policy that doesn't make sense,

150
0:06:53.334,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and we teach anyway.

151
0:06:56.515,000 --> 0:07:,000
We teach anyway, because that's what we do.

152
0:07:00.579,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Teaching and learning should bring joy.

153
0:07:03.818,000 --> 0:07:05,000
How powerful would our world be

154
0:07:06.279,000 --> 0:07:09,000
if we had kids who were not afraid to take risks,

155
0:07:10.029,000 --> 0:07:11,000
who were not afraid to think,

156
0:07:11.434,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and who had a champion?

157
0:07:12.79,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Every child deserves a champion,

158
0:07:15.255,000 --> 0:07:17,000
an adult who will never give up on them,

159
0:07:17.465,000 --> 0:07:19,000
who understands the power of connection,

160
0:07:20.457,000 --> 0:07:23,000

1
0:00:12.823,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Let's talk about how the narrative of Africa is being told,

2
0:00:16.509,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and who is doing the telling.

3
0:00:19.345,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I want to share with you the selection of work

4
0:00:21.925,000 --> 0:00:24,000
by contemporary artists from Africa and its diaspora.

5
0:00:26.321,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I love this art.

6
0:00:27.496,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I find it beautiful and inspiring and thrilling,

7
0:00:31.592,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I really hope I am able to pique your interest.

8
0:00:34.76,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I want to share something about myself and why art matters to me.

9
0:00:38.894,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'm the daughter of an artist, so that means that growing up,

10
0:00:41.777,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I had the chance to see my father do artwork in his studio.

11
0:00:45.135,000 --> 0:00:47,000
My home was surrounded by art,

12
0:00:47.212,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and I had an early art education,

13
0:00:49.332,000 --> 0:00:53,000
being dragged to museums and exhibitions over the summer holidays.

14
0:00:54.467,000 --> 0:00:56,000
What I did not understand, really, at the time,

15
0:00:56.682,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is that this also gave me an early understanding

16
0:00:58.968,000 --> 0:01:,000
about why art is important,

17
0:01:01.595,000 --> 0:01:02,000
how to look at it,

18
0:01:03.096,000 --> 0:01:05,000
how to understand it, but also how to love it.

19
0:01:06.32,000 --> 0:01:09,000
So art matters to me on a personal level,

20
0:01:09.389,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and not only because it's beautiful and inspiring and thrilling,

21
0:01:13.493,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but because art tells powerful stories.

22
0:01:16.881,000 --> 0:01:2,000
All these artists have stories to tell you about what it means to be African,

23
0:01:21.405,000 --> 0:01:25,000
stories that tell you and touches about our African identity,

24
0:01:25.54,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but also stories that tell us about who we are as Africans,

25
0:01:29.58,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but also stories that tell us about our complex history.

26
0:01:35.308,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So how can art tell you powerful stories?

27
0:01:39.075,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I want to share with you this series

28
0:01:41.214,000 --> 0:01:43,000
by Senegalese artist Omar Victor Diop.

29
0:01:44.632,000 --> 0:01:46,000
This is a series of self-portraits,

30
0:01:47.054,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and the artist in this particular series

31
0:01:48.998,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is focusing on the representation of Africans in art history

32
0:01:53.135,000 --> 0:01:55,000
between the 15th to the 19th century.

33
0:01:56.798,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I want to show you how, with one image,

34
0:01:59.75,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Diop is able to touch on our African identity,

35
0:02:02.696,000 --> 0:02:04,000
on the politics of representation,

36
0:02:05.116,000 --> 0:02:07,000
but also on our social value system.

37
0:02:07.981,000 --> 0:02:09,000
In this particular self-portrait,

38
0:02:10.138,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Diop is actually referencing another portrait by Anne-Louis Girodet.

39
0:02:15.92,000 --> 0:02:18,000
This picture is doing a portrait of Jean-Baptiste Belley.

40
0:02:19.212,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Jean-Baptiste Belley was a native of Senegal,

41
0:02:22.016,000 --> 0:02:25,000
a former slave of Haiti,

42
0:02:25.098,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but during his lifetime, he also was elected to represent the colony

43
0:02:30.115,000 --> 0:02:33,000
at the third government of the French Revolution,

44
0:02:33.416,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and he advocated strongly for the abolition of slavery.

45
0:02:37.353,000 --> 0:02:39,000
What is very smart and clever about Diop here

46
0:02:40.067,000 --> 0:02:41,000
is that he's going back to history.

47
0:02:42.505,000 --> 0:02:43,000
He's reclaiming this figure

48
0:02:44.509,000 --> 0:02:47,000
by restaging this beautiful royal blue uniform,

49
0:02:48.178,000 --> 0:02:51,000
where he is restaging also the pose,

50
0:02:51.309,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and he's doing that to actually underline the issues

51
0:02:54.828,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that are still impacting individuals of color today.

52
0:02:57.845,000 --> 0:02:58,000
There was nothing special

53
0:02:59.102,000 --> 0:03:02,000
about this very typical political portrait of the time,

54
0:03:02.825,000 --> 0:03:04,000
except that for the first time,

55
0:03:04.949,000 --> 0:03:06,000
an individual of color, in that case, Jean-Baptiste Belley,

56
0:03:07.784,000 --> 0:03:1,000
was actually named and acknowledged in a painting.

57
0:03:12.51,000 --> 0:03:15,000
What Diop is adding to this picture is this crucial element,

58
0:03:16.276,000 --> 0:03:18,000
which is the football under his arm,

59
0:03:18.479,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and by doing that,

60
0:03:19.702,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Diop is actually touching at our hero worship culture

61
0:03:23.288,000 --> 0:03:25,000
of African football stars,

62
0:03:25.371,000 --> 0:03:27,000
who unfortunately, despite their fame,

63
0:03:28.292,000 --> 0:03:3,000
their immense talent, and their royalty status,

64
0:03:30.999,000 --> 0:03:31,000
they are still invisible.

65
0:03:33.008,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Diop is asking us to dig deeper,

66
0:03:35.122,000 --> 0:03:38,000
to go beyond history and what has been written,

67
0:03:38.17,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and, basically, see how it still influences and impacts us in the present.

68
0:03:42.948,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I want to share this other beautiful series

69
0:03:45.068,000 --> 0:03:48,000
called "Kesh Angels," by artist Hassan Hajjaj.

70
0:03:48.768,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So in this particular series,

71
0:03:50.174,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the artist is really pushing on the boundaries

72
0:03:52.43,000 --> 0:03:53,000
of stereotype and cliché.

73
0:03:54.57,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Hassan Hajjaj is a friend,

74
0:03:57.089,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and honestly, I admire him dearly,

75
0:03:58.987,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but this particular series is talking to me directly as a Muslim woman.

76
0:04:03.902,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I experience this all the time,

77
0:04:06.022,000 --> 0:04:08,000
where, you know, people have a lot of expectations,

78
0:04:08.443,000 --> 0:04:1,000
religious ones and cultural ones,

79
0:04:10.729,000 --> 0:04:13,000
but what I love about this artist is that he's putting all this on its head.

80
0:04:14.664,000 --> 0:04:17,000
He's actually challenging every representation

81
0:04:18.197,000 --> 0:04:21,000
of Muslim, Arabic women that there is.

82
0:04:21.579,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Hassan Hajjaj is a child of the diaspora.

83
0:04:24.301,000 --> 0:04:28,000
He grew up in Morocco amongst bright logo goods,

84
0:04:28.554,000 --> 0:04:31,000
you know, counterfeit originals being sold at the souks.

85
0:04:31.802,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So to see those symbols representing in his work

86
0:04:35.135,000 --> 0:04:39,000
a celebration of the global culture, a critic of the global urban culture,

87
0:04:39.676,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is no surprise,

88
0:04:41.113,000 --> 0:04:46,000
but really at the heart of his work is his desire of a nuanced representation.

89
0:04:46.367,000 --> 0:04:47,000
He wants us to interrupt ourselves

90
0:04:48.027,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and all the perception that we might have

91
0:04:50.058,000 --> 0:04:53,000
on people, on a culture, and on environment.

92
0:04:53.788,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And for example,

93
0:04:55.193,000 --> 0:04:58,000
this particular picture, your common association would be,

94
0:04:59.003,000 --> 0:05:03,000
you know, certain street brand for a certain Western distinctive consumer.

95
0:05:03.809,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Well, he mashes it all up,

96
0:05:05.825,000 --> 0:05:09,000
where he is daring to imagine a female biker culture

97
0:05:10.365,000 --> 0:05:14,000
where actually Chanel or Louis Vuitton is designing the djellaba,

98
0:05:14.825,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and Nike, the babouche,

99
0:05:16.164,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and this is actually the standard uniform.

100
0:05:19.921,000 --> 0:05:22,000
What I love about the women in "Kesh Angels"

101
0:05:23.088,000 --> 0:05:25,000
is that they are able to hold your gaze.

102
0:05:25.454,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We are completely participating in the image,

103
0:05:28.605,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but they are the one inviting us in, and on their own terms.

104
0:05:32.811,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Hassan Hajjaj's "Kesh Angels" or "Project Diaspora" by Omar Victor Diop

105
0:05:37.485,000 --> 0:05:41,000
offer me two strong examples why art is so instrumental.

106
0:05:41.554,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It is instrumental as it really inspires us to ask questions,

107
0:05:45.333,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but it is also instrumental because it ignites change.

108
0:05:48.397,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Seeing diversity in race and ethnicity in contemporary art

109
0:05:52.294,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is the only way that we'll see changes in the art industry,

110
0:05:56.623,000 --> 0:06:,000
but also for the relations between Africa and the Western canon.

111
0:06:01.187,000 --> 0:06:04,000
How we will participate in all this is really up to us.

112
0:06:05.635,000 --> 0:06:06,000
There's a lot of progress to be made,

113
0:06:07.445,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and honestly, we still need to support stronger voices,

114
0:06:10.413,000 --> 0:06:13,000
as they are the ones shaking things up and bringing new perspective.

115
0:06:13.818,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I want to share this beautiful old painting

116
0:06:16.001,000 --> 0:06:2,000
by younger emerging artist Kudzanai-Violet Hwami.

117
0:06:20.787,000 --> 0:06:23,000
For me, when I see her work, it really represents freedom.

118
0:06:25.302,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Hwami has fantastic takes on what it means to be an African

119
0:06:29.692,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and an African life.

120
0:06:31.152,000 --> 0:06:33,000
She has lived in three different countries:

121
0:06:33.407,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Zimbabwe, South Africa and Britain,

122
0:06:36.208,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and therefore has been influenced by a multitude of layers

123
0:06:39.367,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of communities and cultures,

124
0:06:41.391,000 --> 0:06:46,000
from LGBT to eco to Xhosa to emo to British cultures.

125
0:06:47.525,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And as she says herself, the beauty of being a child of the diaspora

126
0:06:51.153,000 --> 0:06:53,000
is really being able to reinvent ourselves

127
0:06:53.788,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and what it means to be African.

128
0:06:56.493,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I want to leave you with this powerful piece

129
0:06:59.597,000 --> 0:07:02,000
by South African artist Lawrence Lemaoana.

130
0:07:03.574,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Lawrence Lemaoana also criticized

131
0:07:05.568,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the influence of the media on our moral consciousness,

132
0:07:09.242,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and he's doing that by using those fabrics like banners in political demonstrations,

133
0:07:14.728,000 --> 0:07:16,000
where he's asking us to reclaim our voices.

134
0:07:17.924,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I believe in the transformative power of art,

135
0:07:21.012,000 --> 0:07:25,000
as it is our only way to paint a nuanced image of Africa,

136
0:07:25.886,000 --> 0:07:27,000
but also its diaspora,

137
0:07:27.981,000 --> 0:07:31,000
one that will be painted by its artists and its cultural producers

138
0:07:32.639,000 --> 0:07:35,000
with their radical but also very unique view of seeing the world

139
0:07:36.196,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and their place in it.

140
0:07:38.551,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It is really through art that we can regain

141
0:07:41.76,000 --> 0:07:43,000
our sense of agency and empowerment.

142
0:07:45.12,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It is through art that we can really tell our own story.

143
0:07:49.121,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So like Lawrence Lemaoana says, the power is ours.

144
0:07:53.19,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Thank you.

145
0:07:54.365,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Applause)

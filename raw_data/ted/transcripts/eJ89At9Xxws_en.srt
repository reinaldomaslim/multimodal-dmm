1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Restaurants and the food industry in general

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
are pretty much the most wasteful industry

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in the world.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
For every calorie of food that we consume here in Britain today,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
10 calories are taken to produce it.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
That's a lot.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I want to take something rather humble

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to discuss.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I found this in the farmers' market today,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and if anybody wants to take it home and mash it later, you're very welcome to.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The humble potato --

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I've spent a long time, 25 years, preparing these.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And it pretty much goes through

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
eight different forms in its lifetime.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
First of all, it's planted, and that takes energy.

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It grows and is nurtured.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's then harvested.

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's then distributed,

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and distribution is a massive issue.

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's then sold and bought,

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and it's then delivered to me.

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I basically take it, prepare it,

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and then people consume it -- hopefully they enjoy it.

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
The last stage is basically waste,

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and this is is pretty much where everybody disregards it.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
There are different types of waste.

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
There's a waste of time; there's a waste of space; there's a waste of energy;

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and there's a waste of waste.

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And every business I've been working on

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
over the past five years,

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I'm trying to lower each one of these elements.

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Okay, so you ask what a sustainable restaurant looks like.

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Basically a restaurant just like any other.

34
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This is the restaurant, Acorn House.

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Front and back.

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So let me run you through a few ideas.

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Floor: sustainable, recyclable.

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Chairs: recycled and recyclable.

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Tables: Forestry Commission.

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
This is Norwegian Forestry Commission wood.

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This bench, although it was uncomfortable for my mom --

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
she didn't like sitting on it,

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so she went and bought these cushions for me from a local jumble sale --

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
reusing, a job that was pretty good.

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I hate waste, especially walls.

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
If they're not working, put a shelf on it, which I did,

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and that shows all the customers my products.

48
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The whole business is run on sustainable energy.

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
This is powered by wind. All of the lights are daylight bulbs.

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Paint is all low-volume chemical,

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
which is very important when you're working in the room all the time.

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I was experimenting with these -- I don't know if you can see it --

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but there's a work surface there.

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And that's a plastic polymer.

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And I was thinking, well I'm trying to think nature, nature, nature.

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But I thought, no, no, experiment with resins,

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
experiment with polymers.

58
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Will they outlive me? They probably might.

59
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Right, here's a reconditioned coffee machine.

60
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It actually looks better than a brand new one -- so looking good there.

61
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now reusing is vital.

62
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And we filter our own water.

63
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We put them in bottles, refrigerate them,

64
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and then we reuse that bottle again and again and again.

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Here's a great little example.

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
If you can see this orange tree, it's actually growing in a car tire,

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
which has been turned inside out and sewn up.

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It's got my compost in it, which is growing an orange tree, which is great.

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This is the kitchen, which is in the same room.

70
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I basically created a menu that allowed people

71
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to choose the amount and volume of food

72
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that they wanted to consume.

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Rather than me putting a dish down,

74
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
they were allowed to help themselves to as much or as little as they wanted.

75
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Okay, it's a small kitchen. It's about five square meters.

76
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It serves 220 people a day.

77
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We generate quite a lot of waste.

78
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
This is the waste room.

79
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
You can't get rid of waste.

80
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
But this story's not about eliminating it, it's about minimizing it.

81
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In here, I have produce and boxes

82
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that are unavoidable.

83
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I put my food waste into this dehydrating, desiccating macerator --

84
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
turns food into an inner material,

85
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
which I can store and then compost later.

86
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I compost it in this garden.

87
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
All of the soil you can see there is basically my food,

88
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
which is generated by the restaurant,

89
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and it's growing in these tubs, which I made out of storm-felled trees

90
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and wine casks and all kinds of things.

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Three compost bins --

92
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
go through about 70 kilos of raw vegetable waste a week --

93
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
really good, makes fantastic compost.

94
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
A couple of wormeries in there too.

95
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And actually one of the wormeries

96
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
was a big wormery. I had a lot of worms in it.

97
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
And I tried taking the dried food waste,

98
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
putting it to the worms, going, "There you go, dinner."

99
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It was like vegetable jerky,

100
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and killed all of them.

101
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I don't know how many worms [were] in there,

102
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but I've got some heavy karma coming, I tell you.

103
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Laughter)

104
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
What you're seeing here is a water filtration system.

105
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
This takes the water out of the restaurant,

106
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
runs it through these stone beds -- this is going to be mint in there --

107
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and I sort of water the garden with it.

108
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I ultimately want to recycle that, put it back into the loos,

109
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
maybe wash hands with it, I don't know.

110
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So, water is a very important aspect.

111
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I started meditating on that

112
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and created a restaurant called Waterhouse.

113
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
If I could get Waterhouse to be a no-carbon restaurant

114
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that is consuming no gas to start with, that would be great.

115
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I managed to do it.

116
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
This restaurant looks a little bit like Acorn House --

117
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
same chairs, same tables.

118
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
They're all English and a little bit more sustainable.

119
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But this is an electrical restaurant.

120
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The whole thing is electric, the restaurant and the kitchen.

121
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And it's run on hydroelectricity,

122
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
so I've gone from air to water.

123
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now it's important to understand

124
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that this room

125
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
is cooled by water, heated by water,

126
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
filters its own water,

127
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and it's powered by water.

128
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It literally is Waterhouse.

129
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The air handling system inside it --

130
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I got rid of air-conditioning

131
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
because I thought there was too much consumption going on there.

132
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
This is basically air-handling.

133
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I'm taking the temperature of the canal outside,

134
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
pumping it through the heat exchange mechanism,

135
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
it's turning through these amazing sails on the roof,

136
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and that, in turn, is falling softly onto the people in the restaurant,

137
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
cooling them, or heating them, as the need may be.

138
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And this is an English willow air diffuser,

139
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and that's softly moving

140
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that air current through the room.

141
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Very advanced, no air-conditioning -- I love it.

142
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
In the canal, which is just outside the restaurant,

143
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
there is hundreds of meters of coil piping.

144
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This takes the temperature of the canal

145
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and turns it into this four-degrees of heat exchange.

146
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I have no idea how it works, but I paid a lot of money for it.

147
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

148
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And what's great is one of the chefs who works in that restaurant

149
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
lives on this boat -- it's off-grid; it generates all its own power.

150
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
He's growing all his own fruit, and that's fantastic.

151
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
There's no accident in names of these restaurants.

152
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Acorn House is the element of wood; Waterhouse is the element of water;

153
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and I'm thinking, well, I'm going to be making

154
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
five restaurants based

155
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
on the five Chinese medicine acupuncture specialities.

156
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I've got water and wood. I'm just about to do fire.

157
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I've got metal and earth to come.

158
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So you've got to watch your space for that.

159
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Okay. So this is my next project.

160
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Five weeks old,

161
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
it's my baby, and it's hurting real bad.

162
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The People's Supermarket.

163
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So basically, the restaurants only really hit

164
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
people who believed in what I was doing anyway.

165
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
What I needed to do was get food out

166
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
to a broader spectrum of people.

167
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
So people -- i.e., perhaps, more working-class --

168
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
or perhaps people who actually believe in a cooperative.

169
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This is a social enterprise,

170
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
not-for-profit cooperative supermarket.

171
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
It really is about the social disconnect

172
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
between food, communities

173
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
in urban settings

174
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and their relationship to rural growers --

175
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
connecting communities in London to rural growers.

176
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Really important.

177
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So I'm committing to potatoes; I'm committing to milk;

178
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I'm committing to leeks and broccoli -- all very important stuff.

179
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I've kept the tiles; I've kept the floors;

180
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I've kept the trunking; I've got in some recycled fridges;

181
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I've got some recycled tills; I've got some recycled trolleys.

182
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I mean, the whole thing is is super-sustainable.

183
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
In fact, I'm trying and I'm going to make this

184
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the most sustainable supermarket in the world.

185
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
That's zero food waste.

186
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And no one's doing that just yet.

187
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
In fact, Sainsbury's, if you're watching,

188
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
let's have a go. Try it on.

189
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I'm going to get there before you.

190
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So nature doesn't create waste

191
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
doesn't create waste as such.

192
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Everything in nature is used up in a closed continuous cycle

193
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
with waste being the end of the beginning,

194
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and that's been something that's been nurturing me for some time,

195
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and it's an important statement to understand.

196
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
If we don't stand up

197
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and make a difference

198
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and think about sustainable food,

199
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
think about the sustainable nature of it,

200
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
then we may fail.

201
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But, I wanted to get up and show you

202
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that we can do it if we're more responsible.

203
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Environmentally conscious businesses are doable.

204
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
They're here. You can see I've done three so far;

205
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I've got a few more to go.

206
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
The idea is embryonic.

207
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I think it's important.

208
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I think that if we reduce, reuse, refuse

209
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and recycle -- right at the end there --

210
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
recycling is the last point I want to make;

211
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
but it's the four R's, rather than the three R's --

212
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
then I think we're going to be on our way.

213
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So these three are not perfect -- they're ideas.

214
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I think that there are many problems to come,

215
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but with help, I'm sure I'm going to find solutions.

216
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I hope you all take part.

217
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

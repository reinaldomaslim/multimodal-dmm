(Applause)

0:02:41.254,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Thank you very much. (Applause)

5
0:02:46.614,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Thank you. It's a distinct privilege to be here.

6
0:02:50.287,000 --> 0:02:51,000
A few weeks ago, I saw a video on YouTube

7
0:02:52.211,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords

8
0:02:54.491,000 --> 0:02:56,000
at the early stages of her recovery

9
0:02:56.65,000 --> 0:02:58,000
from one of those awful bullets.

10
0:02:58.835,000 --> 0:03:,000
This one entered her left hemisphere, and

11
0:03:00.956,000 --> 0:03:03,000
knocked out her Broca's area, the speech center of her brain.

12
0:03:04.472,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And in this session, Gabby's working with a speech therapist,

13
0:03:08.378,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and she's struggling to produce

14
0:03:10.167,000 --> 0:03:13,000
some of the most basic words, and you can see her

15
0:03:13.279,000 --> 0:03:16,000
growing more and more devastated, until she ultimately

16
0:03:16.458,000 --> 0:03:18,000
breaks down into sobbing tears, and she starts sobbing

17
0:03:19.334,000 --> 0:03:22,000
wordlessly into the arms of her therapist.

18
0:03:23.31,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And after a few moments, her therapist tries a new tack,

19
0:03:25.627,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and they start singing together,

20
0:03:27.262,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and Gabby starts to sing through her tears,

21
0:03:29.403,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and you can hear her clearly able to enunciate

22
0:03:32.066,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the words to a song that describe the way she feels,

23
0:03:34.527,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and she sings, in one descending scale, she sings,

24
0:03:37.447,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine."

25
0:03:41.056,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And it's a very powerful and poignant reminder of how

26
0:03:44.037,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the beauty of music has the ability to speak

27
0:03:47.601,000 --> 0:03:51,000
where words fail, in this case literally speak.

28
0:03:52.377,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Seeing this video of Gabby Giffords reminded me

29
0:03:54.13,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of the work of Dr. Gottfried Schlaug,

30
0:03:56.931,000 --> 0:03:59,000
one of the preeminent neuroscientists studying music and the brain at Harvard,

31
0:04:00.682,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and Schlaug is a proponent of a therapy called

32
0:04:03.101,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Melodic Intonation Therapy, which has become very popular in music therapy now.

33
0:04:08.114,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic,

34
0:04:12.437,000 --> 0:04:16,000
could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences,

35
0:04:17.087,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but they could still sing the lyrics to a song,

36
0:04:20.39,000 --> 0:04:21,000
whether it was "Happy Birthday To You"

37
0:04:22.339,000 --> 0:04:24,000
or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones.

38
0:04:24.977,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And after 70 hours of intensive singing lessons,

39
0:04:27.916,000 --> 0:04:31,000
he found that the music was able to literally rewire

40
0:04:31.918,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the brains of his patients and create a homologous

41
0:04:34.37,000 --> 0:04:35,000
speech center in their right hemisphere

42
0:04:36.262,000 --> 0:04:39,000
to compensate for the left hemisphere's damage.

43
0:04:39.761,000 --> 0:04:42,000
When I was 17, I visited Dr. Schlaug's lab, and in one afternoon

44
0:04:43.146,000 --> 0:04:45,000
he walked me through some of the leading research

45
0:04:45.662,000 --> 0:04:48,000
on music and the brain -- how musicians had

46
0:04:49.497,000 --> 0:04:52,000
fundamentally different brain structure than non-musicians,

47
0:04:52.561,000 --> 0:04:53,000
how music, and listening to music,

48
0:04:54.071,000 --> 0:04:56,000
could just light up the entire brain, from

49
0:04:56.325,000 --> 0:04:59,000
our prefrontal cortex all the way back to our cerebellum,

50
0:04:59.799,000 --> 0:05:01,000
how music was becoming a neuropsychiatric modality

51
0:05:02.626,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to help children with autism, to help people struggling

52
0:05:06.249,000 --> 0:05:08,000
with stress and anxiety and depression,

53
0:05:09.034,000 --> 0:05:12,000
how deeply Parkinsonian patients would find that their tremor

54
0:05:12.449,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and their gait would steady when they listened to music,

55
0:05:15.83,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and how late-stage Alzheimer's patients, whose dementia

56
0:05:19.239,000 --> 0:05:21,000
was so far progressed that they could no longer recognize

57
0:05:22.135,000 --> 0:05:24,000
their family, could still pick out a tune by Chopin

58
0:05:24.921,000 --> 0:05:27,000
at the piano that they had learned when they were children.

59
0:05:28.583,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But I had an ulterior motive of visiting Gottfried Schlaug,

60
0:05:31.63,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and it was this: that I was at a crossroads in my life,

61
0:05:34.848,000 --> 0:05:36,000
trying to choose between music and medicine.

62
0:05:37.633,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I had just completed my undergraduate, and I was working

63
0:05:40.594,000 --> 0:05:42,000
as a research assistant at the lab of Dennis Selkoe,

64
0:05:43.467,000 --> 0:05:46,000
studying Parkinson's disease at Harvard, and I had fallen

65
0:05:46.93,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in love with neuroscience. I wanted to become a surgeon.

66
0:05:49.797,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I wanted to become a doctor like Paul Farmer or Rick Hodes,

67
0:05:53.575,000 --> 0:05:57,000
these kind of fearless men who go into places like Haiti or Ethiopia

68
0:05:57.692,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and work with AIDS patients with multidrug-resistant

69
0:06:00.523,000 --> 0:06:03,000
tuberculosis, or with children with disfiguring cancers.

70
0:06:04.312,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I wanted to become that kind of Red Cross doctor,

71
0:06:07.236,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that doctor without borders.

72
0:06:09.24,000 --> 0:06:12,000
On the other hand, I had played the violin my entire life.

73
0:06:12.783,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Music for me was more than a passion. It was obsession.

74
0:06:16.525,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It was oxygen. I was lucky enough to have studied

75
0:06:19.688,000 --> 0:06:22,000
at the Juilliard School in Manhattan, and to have played

76
0:06:22.767,000 --> 0:06:26,000
my debut with Zubin Mehta and the Israeli philharmonic orchestra in Tel Aviv,

77
0:06:27.122,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and it turned out that Gottfried Schlaug

78
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
had studied as an organist at the Vienna Conservatory,

79
0:06:32.384,000 --> 0:06:34,000
but had given up his love for music to pursue a career

80
0:06:34.767,000 --> 0:06:37,000
in medicine. And that afternoon, I had to ask him,

81
0:06:38.448,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"How was it for you making that decision?"

82
0:06:40.984,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And he said that there were still times when he wished

83
0:06:43.013,000 --> 0:06:45,000
he could go back and play the organ the way he used to,

84
0:06:45.785,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and that for me, medical school could wait,

85
0:06:49.002,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but that the violin simply would not.

86
0:06:51.777,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And after two more years of studying music, I decided

87
0:06:54.337,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to shoot for the impossible before taking the MCAT

88
0:06:57.146,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and applying to medical school like a good Indian son

89
0:06:59.722,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to become the next Dr. Gupta. (Laughter)

90
0:07:02.58,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And I decided to shoot for the impossible and I took

91
0:07:05.212,000 --> 0:07:07,000
an audition for the esteemed Los Angeles Philharmonic.

92
0:07:08.155,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It was my first audition, and after three days of playing

93
0:07:11.157,000 --> 0:07:14,000
behind a screen in a trial week, I was offered the position.

94
0:07:14.183,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And it was a dream. It was a wild dream to perform

95
0:07:18.101,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in an orchestra, to perform in the iconic Walt Disney Concert Hall

96
0:07:21.601,000 --> 0:07:24,000
in an orchestra conducted now by the famous Gustavo Dudamel,

97
0:07:25.185,000 --> 0:07:27,000
but much more importantly to me to be surrounded

98
0:07:28.171,000 --> 0:07:31,000
by musicians and mentors that became my new family,

99
0:07:32.061,000 --> 0:07:35,000
my new musical home.

100
0:07:35.255,000 --> 0:07:38,000
But a year later, I met another musician who had also

101
0:07:38.965,000 --> 0:07:41,000
studied at Juilliard, one who profoundly helped me

102
0:07:42.054,000 --> 0:07:46,000
find my voice and shaped my identity as a musician.

103
0:07:46.412,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Nathaniel Ayers was a double bassist at Juilliard, but

104
0:07:49.693,000 --> 0:07:52,000
he suffered a series of psychotic episodes in his early 20s,

105
0:07:53.432,000 --> 0:07:55,000
was treated with thorazine at Bellevue,

106
0:07:55.778,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and ended up living homeless on the streets of Skid Row

107
0:07:59.254,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in downtown Los Angeles 30 years later.

108
0:08:01.7,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Nathaniel's story has become a beacon for homelessness

109
0:08:05.145,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and mental health advocacy throughout the United States,

110
0:08:08.003,000 --> 0:08:1,000
as told through the book and the movie "The Soloist,"

111
0:08:10.148,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but I became his friend, and I became his violin teacher,

112
0:08:13.294,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and I told him that wherever he had his violin,

113
0:08:15.804,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and wherever I had mine, I would play a lesson with him.

114
0:08:18.775,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And on the many times I saw Nathaniel on Skid Row,

115
0:08:21.454,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I witnessed how music was able to bring him back

116
0:08:24.263,000 --> 0:08:26,000
from his very darkest moments, from what seemed to me

117
0:08:27.23,000 --> 0:08:28,000
in my untrained eye to be

118
0:08:29.19,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the beginnings of a schizophrenic episode.

119
0:08:32.99,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Playing for Nathaniel, the music took on a deeper meaning,

120
0:08:36.244,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because now it was about communication,

121
0:08:38.802,000 --> 0:08:4,000
a communication where words failed, a communication

122
0:08:41.712,000 --> 0:08:44,000
of a message that went deeper than words, that registered

123
0:08:44.87,000 --> 0:08:47,000
at a fundamentally primal level in Nathaniel's psyche,

124
0:08:48.359,000 --> 0:08:52,000
yet came as a true musical offering from me.

125
0:08:52.906,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I found myself growing outraged that someone

126
0:08:56.883,000 --> 0:08:59,000
like Nathaniel could have ever been homeless on Skid Row

127
0:09:00.792,000 --> 0:09:03,000
because of his mental illness, yet how many tens of thousands

128
0:09:04.131,000 --> 0:09:07,000
of others there were out there on Skid Row alone

129
0:09:07.236,000 --> 0:09:11,000
who had stories as tragic as his, but were never going to have a book or a movie

130
0:09:11.992,000 --> 0:09:13,000
made about them that got them off the streets?

131
0:09:14.254,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And at the very core of this crisis of mine, I felt somehow

132
0:09:18.267,000 --> 0:09:22,000
the life of music had chosen me, where somehow,

133
0:09:22.362,000 --> 0:09:24,000
perhaps possibly in a very naive sense, I felt what Skid Row

134
0:09:25.331,000 --> 0:09:28,000
really needed was somebody like Paul Farmer

135
0:09:28.342,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and not another classical musician playing on Bunker Hill.

136
0:09:32.483,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But in the end, it was Nathaniel who showed me

137
0:09:34.533,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that if I was truly passionate about change,

138
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
if I wanted to make a difference, I already had the perfect instrument to do it,

139
0:09:41.583,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that music was the bridge that connected my world and his.

140
0:09:46.352,000 --> 0:09:47,000
There's a beautiful quote

141
0:09:48.024,000 --> 0:09:5,000
by the Romantic German composer Robert Schumann,

142
0:09:50.488,000 --> 0:09:55,000
who said, "To send light into the darkness of men's hearts,

143
0:09:55.697,000 --> 0:09:57,000
such is the duty of the artist."

144
0:09:58.122,000 --> 0:10:,000
And this is a particularly poignant quote

145
0:10:00.558,000 --> 0:10:02,000
because Schumann himself suffered from schizophrenia

146
0:10:03.297,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and died in asylum.

147
0:10:05.405,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And inspired by what I learned from Nathaniel,

148
0:10:07.867,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I started an organization on Skid Row of musicians

149
0:10:10.231,000 --> 0:10:13,000
called Street Symphony, bringing the light of music

150
0:10:13.424,000 --> 0:10:15,000
into the very darkest places, performing

151
0:10:16.068,000 --> 0:10:18,000
for the homeless and mentally ill at shelters and clinics

152
0:10:18.655,000 --> 0:10:22,000
on Skid Row, performing for combat veterans

153
0:10:22.685,000 --> 0:10:25,000
with post-traumatic stress disorder, and for the incarcerated

154
0:10:26.095,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and those labeled as criminally insane.

155
0:10:29.899,000 --> 0:10:31,000
After one of our events at the Patton State Hospital

156
0:10:32.292,000 --> 0:10:34,000
in San Bernardino, a woman walked up to us

157
0:10:34.813,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and she had tears streaming down her face,

158
0:10:37.13,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and she had a palsy, she was shaking,

159
0:10:39.596,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and she had this gorgeous smile, and she said

160
0:10:42.618,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that she had never heard classical music before,

161
0:10:44.6,000 --> 0:10:46,000
she didn't think she was going to like it, she had never

162
0:10:47.026,000 --> 0:10:51,000
heard a violin before, but that hearing this music was like hearing the sunshine,

163
0:10:51.128,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and that nobody ever came to visit them, and that for the first time in six years,

164
0:10:54.497,000 --> 0:10:58,000
when she heard us play, she stopped shaking without medication.

165
0:10:59.3,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Suddenly, what we're finding with these concerts,

166
0:11:02.258,000 --> 0:11:05,000
away from the stage, away from the footlights, out

167
0:11:05.3,000 --> 0:11:08,000
of the tuxedo tails, the musicians become the conduit

168
0:11:08.921,000 --> 0:11:11,000
for delivering the tremendous therapeutic benefits

169
0:11:12.043,000 --> 0:11:15,000
of music on the brain to an audience that would never

170
0:11:15.136,000 --> 0:11:16,000
have access to this room,

171
0:11:16.938,000 --> 0:11:21,000
would never have access to the kind of music that we make.

172
0:11:22.77,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Just as medicine serves to heal more

173
0:11:26.201,000 --> 0:11:29,000
than the building blocks of the body alone,

174
0:11:29.499,000 --> 0:11:32,000
the power and beauty of music transcends the "E"

175
0:11:33.266,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in the middle of our beloved acronym.

176
0:11:36.001,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Music transcends the aesthetic beauty alone.

177
0:11:39.639,000 --> 0:11:42,000
The synchrony of emotions that we experience when we

178
0:11:42.649,000 --> 0:11:45,000
hear an opera by Wagner, or a symphony by Brahms,

179
0:11:45.906,000 --> 0:11:48,000
or chamber music by Beethoven, compels us to remember

180
0:11:49.552,000 --> 0:11:52,000
our shared, common humanity, the deeply communal

181
0:11:53.46,000 --> 0:11:56,000
connected consciousness, the empathic consciousness

182
0:11:56.875,000 --> 0:11:59,000
that neuropsychiatrist Iain McGilchrist says is hard-wired

183
0:12:00.448,000 --> 0:12:03,000
into our brain's right hemisphere.

184
0:12:03.524,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And for those living in the most dehumanizing conditions

185
0:12:06.92,000 --> 0:12:08,000
of mental illness within homelessness

186
0:12:09.081,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and incarceration, the music and the beauty of music

187
0:12:11.864,000 --> 0:12:15,000
offers a chance for them to transcend the world around them,

188
0:12:16.496,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to remember that they still have the capacity to experience

189
0:12:19.878,000 --> 0:12:22,000
something beautiful and that humanity has not forgotten them.

190
0:12:23.83,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And the spark of that beauty, the spark of that humanity

191
0:12:26.691,000 --> 0:12:28,000
transforms into hope,

192
0:12:29.491,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and we know, whether we choose the path of music

193
0:12:32.451,000 --> 0:12:35,000
or of medicine, that's the very first thing we must instill

194
0:12:35.66,000 --> 0:12:36,000
within our communities, within our audiences,

195
0:12:37.599,000 --> 0:12:4,000
if we want to inspire healing from within.

196
0:12:41.53,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I'd like to end with a quote by John Keats,

197
0:12:44.206,000 --> 0:12:46,000
the Romantic English poet,

198
0:12:46.251,000 --> 0:12:48,000
a very famous quote that I'm sure all of you know.

199
0:12:49.189,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Keats himself had also given up a career in medicine

200
0:12:52.208,000 --> 0:12:55,000
to pursue poetry, but he died when he was a year older than me.

201
0:12:55.529,000 --> 0:13:,000
And Keats said, "Beauty is truth, and truth beauty.

202
0:13:00.602,000 --> 0:13:06,000
That is all ye know on Earth, and all ye need to know."

203
0:13:09.857,000 --> 0:15:53,000
(Music)

204
0:15:53.98,000 --> 0:16:21,000
(Applause)

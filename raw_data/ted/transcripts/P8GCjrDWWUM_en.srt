1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Melati Wijsen: Bali -- island of gods.

2
0:00:17.301,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Isabel Wijsen: A green paradise.

3
0:00:21.139,000 --> 0:00:22,000
MW: Or ...

4
0:00:22.576,000 --> 0:00:23,000
a paradise lost.

5
0:00:25.075,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Bali:

6
0:00:26.696,000 --> 0:00:27,000
island of garbage.

7
0:00:29.707,000 --> 0:00:3,000
IW: In Bali,

8
0:00:30.883,000 --> 0:00:35,000
we generate 680 cubic meters of plastic garbage a day.

9
0:00:37.801,000 --> 0:00:39,000
That's about a 14-story building.

10
0:00:41.205,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And when it comes to plastic bags,

11
0:00:43.45,000 --> 0:00:45,000
less than five percent gets recycled.

12
0:00:46.9,000 --> 0:00:49,000
MW: We know that changes the image you may have of our island.

13
0:00:50.666,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It changed ours, too, when we learned about it,

14
0:00:53.174,000 --> 0:00:57,000
when we learned that almost all plastic bags in Bali end up in our drains

15
0:00:57.759,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and then in our rivers

16
0:00:59.033,000 --> 0:01:,000
and then in our ocean.

17
0:01:00.9,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And those that don't even make it to the ocean,

18
0:01:03.388,000 --> 0:01:05,000
they're either burned or littered.

19
0:01:06.183,000 --> 0:01:08,000
IW: So we decided to do something about it.

20
0:01:08.812,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And we've been working for almost three years now

21
0:01:11.335,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to try to say no to plastic bags on our home island.

22
0:01:14.711,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And we have had some significant successes.

23
0:01:18.835,000 --> 0:01:2,000
MW: We are sisters,

24
0:01:20.891,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and we go to the best school on earth:

25
0:01:24.061,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Green School, Bali.

26
0:01:25.61,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Green School is not only different in the way that it is built out of bamboo,

27
0:01:30.257,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but also in the way that it teaches.

28
0:01:32.864,000 --> 0:01:34,000
We are taught to become leaders of today,

29
0:01:36.518,000 --> 0:01:38,000
something a normal textbook cannot match.

30
0:01:39.813,000 --> 0:01:41,000
IW: One day we had a lesson in class

31
0:01:41.858,000 --> 0:01:43,000
where we learned about significant people,

32
0:01:44.595,000 --> 0:01:45,000
like Nelson Mandela,

33
0:01:46.107,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Lady Diana

34
0:01:47.282,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and Mahatma Gandhi.

35
0:01:49.244,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Walking home that day,

36
0:01:50.425,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we agreed that we also wanted to be significant.

37
0:01:54.614,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Why should we wait until we were grown up

38
0:01:56.675,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to be significant?

39
0:01:58.42,000 --> 0:02:,000
We wanted to do something now.

40
0:02:01.135,000 --> 0:02:02,000
MW: Sitting on the sofa that night,

41
0:02:02.859,000 --> 0:02:04,000
we brainstormed and thought of all the issues facing Bali.

42
0:02:06.332,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And one thing that stood out to us the most

43
0:02:08.42,000 --> 0:02:09,000
was the plastic garbage.

44
0:02:10.536,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But that is a huge problem.

45
0:02:13.189,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So we looked into what was a realistic target for us kids:

46
0:02:17.589,000 --> 0:02:18,000
plastic bags.

47
0:02:18.844,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And the idea was born.

48
0:02:20.983,000 --> 0:02:21,000
IW: We started researching,

49
0:02:22.988,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and let's just say, the more we learned,

50
0:02:25.952,000 --> 0:02:28,000
there was nothing good about plastic bags.

51
0:02:29.401,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And you know what?

52
0:02:30.695,000 --> 0:02:31,000
We don't even need them.

53
0:02:33.003,000 --> 0:02:36,000
MW: We were really inspired by the efforts to say no to plastic bags

54
0:02:36.568,000 --> 0:02:37,000
in many other places,

55
0:02:38.462,000 --> 0:02:39,000
from Hawaii to Rwanda

56
0:02:40.468,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and to severals cities like Oakland and Dublin.

57
0:02:43.784,000 --> 0:02:48,000
IW: And so the idea turned into the launch of "Bye Bye Plastic Bags."

58
0:02:50.658,000 --> 0:02:52,000
MW: In the years that we have been campaigning,

59
0:02:52.874,000 --> 0:02:54,000
we have learned a lot.

60
0:02:55.984,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Lesson number one:

61
0:02:58.233,000 --> 0:03:,000
you cannot do it all by yourself.

62
0:03:00.415,000 --> 0:03:02,000
You need a big team of like-minded kids,

63
0:03:02.631,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and so we formed the Bye Bye Plastic Bags crew.

64
0:03:06.459,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The volunteer team includes children from all over the island,

65
0:03:09.598,000 --> 0:03:11,000
from both international and local schools.

66
0:03:12.505,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And together with them,

67
0:03:13.68,000 --> 0:03:14,000
we started a multi-layered approach,

68
0:03:15.454,000 --> 0:03:18,000
based on an on- and off-line signature petition,

69
0:03:18.774,000 --> 0:03:21,000
educational and inspirational presentations at schools

70
0:03:22.234,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and we raise general awareness at markets, festivals, beach clean-ups.

71
0:03:26.743,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And last but not least,

72
0:03:27.918,000 --> 0:03:29,000
we distribute alternative bags,

73
0:03:29.988,000 --> 0:03:3,000
bags like net bags,

74
0:03:31.736,000 --> 0:03:32,000
recycled newspaper bags

75
0:03:33.082,000 --> 0:03:35,000
or 100 percent organic material bags,

76
0:03:35.826,000 --> 0:03:37,000
all made by local initiatives on the island.

77
0:03:38.898,000 --> 0:03:39,000
IW: We run a pilot village,

78
0:03:40.316,000 --> 0:03:42,000
home of 800 families.

79
0:03:42.952,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The village mayor was our first friend

80
0:03:44.799,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and he loved our T-shirts, so that helped.

81
0:03:48.077,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We focused on making the customers aware,

82
0:03:50.769,000 --> 0:03:52,000
because that's where the change needs to happen.

83
0:03:54.266,000 --> 0:03:56,000
The village is already two-thirds along the way

84
0:03:56.487,000 --> 0:03:58,000
of becoming plastic bag free.

85
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Our first attempts to get the government of Bali on board failed.

86
0:04:04.696,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So we thought,

87
0:04:06.391,000 --> 0:04:1,000
"Hmm ... a petition with one million signatures.

88
0:04:10.715,000 --> 0:04:11,000
They can't ignore us, right?"

89
0:04:12.732,000 --> 0:04:13,000
MW: Right!

90
0:04:14.258,000 --> 0:04:15,000
IW: But, who would have guessed

91
0:04:16.117,000 --> 0:04:2,000
one million signatures is, like, a thousand times a thousand?

92
0:04:20.303,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:22.27,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We got stuck --

94
0:04:24.747,000 --> 0:04:25,000
till we learned lesson number two:

95
0:04:27.507,000 --> 0:04:28,000
think outside the box.

96
0:04:29.808,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Someone mentioned

97
0:04:30.983,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that the Bali airport handles 16 million arrivals and departures a year.

98
0:04:38.294,000 --> 0:04:41,000
MW: But how do we get into the airport?

99
0:04:41.993,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And here comes lesson number three:

100
0:04:44.236,000 --> 0:04:45,000
persistence.

101
0:04:46.141,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Off we headed to the airport.

102
0:04:47.792,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We got past the janitor.

103
0:04:49.819,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And then it was his boss's boss,

104
0:04:51.729,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and then the assistant office manager,

105
0:04:54.014,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and then the office manager,

106
0:04:55.423,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and then ...

107
0:04:56.618,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we got shuffled down two levels and thought,

108
0:04:58.789,000 --> 0:05:,000
well, here comes the janitor again.

109
0:05:01.537,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And after several days knocking on doors

110
0:05:03.609,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and just being kids on a mission,

111
0:05:05.949,000 --> 0:05:08,000
we finally got to the commercial manager of Bali airports.

112
0:05:10.368,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And we gave him the "Bali of plastic bags" speech, and being a very nice man,

113
0:05:14.305,000 --> 0:05:17,000
he said, [imitating the man's voice] "I cannot believe what I'm about say,

114
0:05:18.027,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but I'm going to give authorization

115
0:05:20.294,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to collect signatures behind customs and immigrations."

116
0:05:23.275,000 --> 0:05:24,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:24.643,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Applause)

118
0:05:28.962,000 --> 0:05:29,000
IW: In our first hour and a half there,

119
0:05:30.93,000 --> 0:05:32,000
we got almost 1,000 signatures.

120
0:05:33.954,000 --> 0:05:34,000
How cool is that?

121
0:05:36.34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Lesson number four:

122
0:05:37.875,000 --> 0:05:4,000
you need champions at all levels of society,

123
0:05:41.486,000 --> 0:05:44,000
from students to commercial managers to famous people.

124
0:05:46.097,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And thanks to the attraction of Green School,

125
0:05:48.233,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we had access to a steady stream of celebrities.

126
0:05:51.937,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Ban Ki Moon taught us

127
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that Secretary-Generals of the United Nations

128
0:05:56.545,000 --> 0:05:57,000
don't sign petitions --

129
0:05:58.22,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:59.245,000 --> 0:06:,000
even if kids ask nicely.

131
0:06:01.106,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But he promised to spread the word,

132
0:06:02.815,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and now we work closely with the United Nations.

133
0:06:05.701,000 --> 0:06:07,000
MW: Jane Goodall taught us the power of a people's network.

134
0:06:09.055,000 --> 0:06:12,000
She started with just one Roots & Shoots group

135
0:06:12.119,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and now she has 4,000 groups around the world.

136
0:06:15.434,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We are one of them.

137
0:06:16.631,000 --> 0:06:17,000
She's a real inspiration.

138
0:06:18.731,000 --> 0:06:19,000
If you're a fellow Rotarian,

139
0:06:20.507,000 --> 0:06:21,000
nice to meet you.

140
0:06:21.821,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We're Interactors,

141
0:06:22.996,000 --> 0:06:24,000
the youngest department of Rotary International.

142
0:06:26.573,000 --> 0:06:29,000
IW: But we have also learned much about patience,

143
0:06:29.84,000 --> 0:06:31,000
MW: how to deal with frustrations,

144
0:06:32.121,000 --> 0:06:33,000
IW: leadership,

145
0:06:33.296,000 --> 0:06:34,000
MW: teamwork,

146
0:06:34.489,000 --> 0:06:35,000
IW: friendship,

147
0:06:35.664,000 --> 0:06:37,000
MW: we learned more about the Balinese and their culture

148
0:06:38.347,000 --> 0:06:41,000
IW: and we learned about the importance of commitment.

149
0:06:42.106,000 --> 0:06:43,000
MW: It's not always easy.

150
0:06:43.864,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Sometimes it does get a little bit hard to walk your talk.

151
0:06:47.83,000 --> 0:06:49,000
IW: But last year, we did exactly that.

152
0:06:50.663,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We went to India to give a talk,

153
0:06:52.29,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and our parents took us to visit

154
0:06:53.869,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the former private house of Mahatma Gandhi.

155
0:06:57.216,000 --> 0:06:59,000
We learned about the power of hunger strikes

156
0:06:59.494,000 --> 0:07:,000
he did to reach his goals.

157
0:07:01.329,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Yes, by the end of the tour,

158
0:07:03.351,000 --> 0:07:04,000
when we met our parents again,

159
0:07:05.026,000 --> 0:07:06,000
we both made a decision and said,

160
0:07:06.716,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"We're going on a hunger strike!"

161
0:07:08.496,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Laughter)

162
0:07:09.521,000 --> 0:07:11,000
MW: And you can probably imagine their faces.

163
0:07:12.444,000 --> 0:07:14,000
It took a lot of convincing,

164
0:07:14.746,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and not only to our parents

165
0:07:16.502,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but to our friends and to our teachers as well.

166
0:07:19.561,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Isabel and I were serious about doing this.

167
0:07:22.556,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So we met with a nutritionist,

168
0:07:24.189,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and we came up with a compromise

169
0:07:26.053,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of not eating from sunrise to sunset every day

170
0:07:30.342,000 --> 0:07:32,000
until the governor of Bali would agree to meet with us

171
0:07:32.971,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to talk about how to stop plastic bags on Bali.

172
0:07:37.118,000 --> 0:07:41,000
IW: Our "mogak makan," as it is called in Bahasa Indonesia,

173
0:07:41.162,000 --> 0:07:42,000
started.

174
0:07:42.337,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We used social media to support our goal

175
0:07:44.35,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and already on day two,

176
0:07:46.141,000 --> 0:07:48,000
police started to come to our home and school.

177
0:07:48.724,000 --> 0:07:5,000
What were these two girls doing?

178
0:07:51.466,000 --> 0:07:53,000
We knew we weren't making the governor look his best

179
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:55,000
by doing this food strike --

180
0:07:55.905,000 --> 0:07:56,000
we could have gone to jail.

181
0:07:57.768,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But, hey, it worked.

182
0:07:59.721,000 --> 0:08:,000
Twenty-four hours later,

183
0:08:00.971,000 --> 0:08:01,000
we were picked up from school

184
0:08:02.407,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and escorted to the office of the governor.

185
0:08:05.283,000 --> 0:08:06,000
MW: And there he was --

186
0:08:06.82,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Applause)

187
0:08:09.053,000 --> 0:08:1,000
waiting for us to meet and speak,

188
0:08:11.007,000 --> 0:08:13,000
being all supportive and thankful for our willingness

189
0:08:13.581,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to care for the beauty and the environment of Bali.

190
0:08:16.812,000 --> 0:08:17,000
He signed a promise

191
0:08:17.987,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to help the people of Bali say no to plastic bags.

192
0:08:20.762,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And we are now friends,

193
0:08:21.94,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and on a regular basis,

194
0:08:23.36,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we remind him and his team of the promises he has made.

195
0:08:27.372,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And indeed,

196
0:08:28.547,000 --> 0:08:29,000
recently he stated and committed

197
0:08:30.477,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that Bali will be plastic bag free by 2018.

198
0:08:35.144,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Applause)

199
0:08:43.498,000 --> 0:08:47,000
IW: Also, at the International Airport of Bali, one of our supporters

200
0:08:48.139,000 --> 0:08:52,000
is planning to start a plastic bag-free policy by 2016.

201
0:08:53.186,000 --> 0:08:54,000
MW: Stop handing out free plastic bags

202
0:08:55.197,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and bring in your own reusable bag

203
0:08:56.917,000 --> 0:08:59,000
is our next message to change that mindset of the public.

204
0:09:01.405,000 --> 0:09:02,000
IW: Our short-term campaign,

205
0:09:03.126,000 --> 0:09:04,000
"One Island / One Voice,"

206
0:09:04.582,000 --> 0:09:05,000
is all about this.

207
0:09:06.04,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We check and recognize the shops and restaurants

208
0:09:08.743,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that have declared themselves a plastic bag-free zone,

209
0:09:11.61,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and we put this sticker at their entrance

210
0:09:14.007,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and publish their names on social media

211
0:09:16.349,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and some important magazines on Bali.

212
0:09:18.829,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And conversely,

213
0:09:20.004,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that highlights those who do not have the sticker.

214
0:09:22.853,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Laughter)

215
0:09:24.731,000 --> 0:09:27,000
MW: So, why are we actually telling you all of this?

216
0:09:28.673,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Well, partly, it is because we are proud

217
0:09:30.615,000 --> 0:09:32,000
of the results that, together with our team,

218
0:09:32.71,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we have been able to reach.

219
0:09:34.469,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But also because along the way,

220
0:09:36.581,000 --> 0:09:38,000
we have learned that kids can do things.

221
0:09:39.445,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We can make things happen.

222
0:09:41.891,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Isabel and I were only 10 and 12 years old

223
0:09:44.342,000 --> 0:09:45,000
when we started this.

224
0:09:45.925,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We never had a business plan,

225
0:09:48.002,000 --> 0:09:49,000
nor a fixed strategy,

226
0:09:49.25,000 --> 0:09:5,000
nor any hidden agendas --

227
0:09:51.193,000 --> 0:09:53,000
just the idea in front of us

228
0:09:53.657,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and a group of friends working with us.

229
0:09:56.195,000 --> 0:09:58,000
All we wanted to do was stop those plastic bags

230
0:09:58.465,000 --> 0:10:,000
from wrapping and suffocating our beautiful home.

231
0:10:01.933,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Kids have a boundless energy

232
0:10:03.665,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and a motivation to be the change the world needs.

233
0:10:08.454,000 --> 0:10:12,000
IW: So to all the kids of this beautiful but challenging world:

234
0:10:13.69,000 --> 0:10:14,000
go for it!

235
0:10:14.868,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Make that difference.

236
0:10:17.057,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We're not telling you it's going to be easy.

237
0:10:19.5,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We're telling you it's going to be worth it.

238
0:10:22.221,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Us kids may only be 25 percent of the world's population,

239
0:10:26.616,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but we are 100 percent of the future.

240
0:10:31.05,000 --> 0:10:33,000
MW: We still have a lot of work to do,

241
0:10:33.73,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but know that we still not stop

242
0:10:35.419,000 --> 0:10:39,000
until the first question asked when arriving at the Bali airports will be

243
0:10:40.682,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Both: "Welcome to Bali,

244
0:10:42.04,000 --> 0:10:44,000
do you have nay plastic bags to declare?"

245
0:10:44.231,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Laughter)

246
0:10:45.668,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Om shanti shanti shanti om.

247
0:10:48.428,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Thank you.

248
0:10:49.603,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm here to give you

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
your recommended dietary allowance

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
of poetry.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And the way I'm going to do that

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is present to you

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
five animations

7
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
of five of my poems.

8
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And let me just tell you a little bit of how that came about.

9
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Because the mixing of those two media

10
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
is a sort of unnatural or unnecessary act.

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
But when I was United States Poet Laureate --

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and I love saying that.

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's a great way to start sentences.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
When I was him back then,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I was approached by J. Walter Thompson, the ad company,

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and they were hired

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
sort of by the Sundance Channel.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And the idea was to have me record some of my poems

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and then they would find animators

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to animate them.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And I was initially resistant,

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
because I always think

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
poetry can stand alone by itself.

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Attempts to put my poems to music

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
have had disastrous results,

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
in all cases.

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And the poem, if it's written with the ear,

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
already has been set to its own verbal music

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
as it was composed.

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And surely, if you're reading a poem

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that mentions a cow,

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
you don't need on the facing page

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
a drawing of a cow.

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I mean, let's let the reader do a little work.

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But I relented because it seemed like an interesting possibility,

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and also I'm like a total cartoon junkie

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
since childhood.

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I think more influential

40
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
than Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworth

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
on my imagination

42
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
were Warner Brothers, Merrie Melodies

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and Loony Tunes cartoons.

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
Bugs Bunny is my muse.

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And this way poetry could find its way onto television of all places.

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places --

47
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
poetry on buses, poetry on subways,

48
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
on billboards, on cereal boxes.

49
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
When I was Poet Laureate, there I go again --

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I can't help it, it's true --

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I created a poetry channel on Delta Airlines

53
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that lasted for a couple of years.

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So you could tune into poetry as you were flying.

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And my sense is,

56
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
it's a good thing to get poetry off the shelves

57
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and more into public life.

58
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Start a meeting with a poem. That would be an idea you might take with you.

59
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
When you get a poem on a billboard or on the radio

60
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
or on a cereal box or whatever,

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
it happens to you so suddenly

62
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that you don't have time

63
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to deploy your anti-poetry deflector shields

64
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that were installed in high school.

65
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So let us start with the first one.

66
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It's a little poem called "Budapest,"

67
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and in it I reveal,

68
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
or pretend to reveal,

69
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
the secrets of the creative process.

70
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Video) Narration: "Budapest."

71
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
My pen moves along the page

72
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
like the snout of a strange animal

73
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
shaped like a human arm

74
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and dressed in the sleeve

75
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
of a loose green sweater.

76
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I watch it sniffing the paper ceaselessly,

77
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
intent as any forager

78
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that has nothing on its mind

79
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but the grubs and insects

80
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that will allow it to live another day.

81
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It wants only to be here tomorrow,

82
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
dressed perhaps

83
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in the sleeve of a plaid shirt,

84
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
nose pressed against the page,

85
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
writing a few more dutiful lines

86
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
while I gaze out the window

87
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and imagine Budapest

88
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
or some other city

89
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
where I have never been.

90
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
BC: So that makes it seem a little easier.

91
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Applause)

92
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Writing is not actually as easy as that for me.

93
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But I like to pretend that it comes with ease.

94
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
One of my students came up after class, an introductory class,

95
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and she said, "You know, poetry is harder than writing,"

96
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
which I found both erroneous and profound.

97
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So I like to at least pretend it just flows out.

99
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
A friend of mine has a slogan; he's another poet.

100
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
He says that, "If at first you don't succeed,

101
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
hide all evidence you ever tried."

102
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

103
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The next poem is also rather short.

104
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Poetry just says a few things in different ways.

105
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And I think you could boil this poem down to saying,

106
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"Some days you eat the bear, other days the bear eats you."

107
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And it uses the imagery

108
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
of dollhouse furniture.

109
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Video) Narration: "Some Days."

110
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Some days

111
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I put the people in their places at the table,

112
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
bend their legs at the knees,

113
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
if they come with that feature,

114
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and fix them into the tiny wooden chairs.

115
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
All afternoon they face one another,

116
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the man in the brown suit,

117
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
the woman in the blue dress --

118
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
perfectly motionless, perfectly behaved.

119
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
But other days I am the one

120
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
who is lifted up by the ribs

121
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
then lowered into the dining room of a dollhouse

122
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to sit with the others at the long table.

123
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Very funny.

124
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
But how would you like it

125
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
if you never knew from one day to the next

126
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
if you were going to spend it

127
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
striding around like a vivid god,

128
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
your shoulders in the clouds,

129
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
or sitting down there

130
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
amidst the wallpaper

131
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
staring straight ahead

132
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
with your little plastic face?

133
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Applause)

134
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
BC: There's a horror movie in there somewhere.

135
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The next poem is called forgetfulness,

136
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and it's really just a kind of poetic essay

137
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
on the subject of mental slippage.

138
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And the poem begins

139
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
with a certain species of forgetfulness

140
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that someone called

141
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
literary amnesia,

142
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in other words, forgetting the things that you have read.

143
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Video) Narration: "Forgetfulness."

144
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The name of the author is the first to go,

145
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
followed obediently

146
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
by the title, the plot,

147
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the heartbreaking conclusion,

148
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
the entire novel,

149
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which suddenly becomes one you have never read,

150
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
never even heard of.

151
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It is as if, one by one,

152
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the memories you used to harbor

153
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
decided to retire to the southern hemisphere of the brain

154
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to a little fishing village

155
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
where there are no phones.

156
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Long ago,

157
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
you kissed the names of the nine muses good-bye

158
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and you watched the quadratic equation

159
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
pack its bag.

160
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And even now,

161
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
as you memorize the order of the planets,

162
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
something else is slipping away,

163
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
a state flower perhaps,

164
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
the address of an uncle,

165
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the capital of Paraguay.

166
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Whatever it is

167
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
you are struggling to remember,

168
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
it is not poised on the tip of your tongue,

169
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
not even lurking

170
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in some obscure corner

171
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
of your spleen.

172
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It has floated away

173
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
down a dark mythological river

174
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
whose name begins with an L

175
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
as far as you can recall,

176
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
well on your own way to oblivion

177
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
where you will join those

178
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
who have forgotten even how to swim

179
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and how to ride a bicycle.

180
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
No wonder you rise in the middle of the night

181
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to look up the date of a famous battle

182
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
in a book on war.

183
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
No wonder the Moon in the window

184
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
seems to have drifted out of a love poem

185
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
that you used to know by heart.

186
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Applause)

187
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
BC: The next poem is called "The Country"

188
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and it's based on,

189
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
when I was in college

190
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I met a classmate who remains to be a friend of mine.

191
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
He lived, and still does, in rural Vermont.

192
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I lived in New York City.

193
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And we would visit each other.

194
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And when I would go up to the country,

195
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
he would teach me things like deer hunting,

196
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
which meant getting lost with a gun basically --

197
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
(Laughter)

198
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and trout fishing and stuff like that.

199
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And then he'd come down to New York City

200
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and I'd teach him what I knew,

201
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
which was largely smoking and drinking.

202
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And in that way we traded lore with each other.

204
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The poem that's coming up

205
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
is based on him trying to tell me a little something

206
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
about a domestic point of etiquette

207
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in country living

208
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
that I had a very hard time, at first, processing.

209
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
It's called "The Country."

210
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Video) Narration: "The Country."

211
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I wondered about you

212
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
when you told me never to leave

213
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
a box of wooden strike-anywhere matches

214
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
just lying around the house,

215
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
because the mice might get into them

216
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and start a fire.

217
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But your face was absolutely straight

218
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
when you twisted the lid down

219
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
on the round tin

220
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
where the matches, you said, are always stowed.

221
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Who could sleep that night?

222
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Who could whisk away the thought

223
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
of the one unlikely mouse

224
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
padding along a cold water pipe

225
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
behind the floral wallpaper,

226
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
gripping a single wooden match

227
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
between the needles of his teeth?

228
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Who could not see him rounding a corner,

229
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
the blue tip scratching against rough-hewn beam,

230
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the sudden flare

231
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and the creature, for one bright, shining moment,

232
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
suddenly thrust ahead of his time --

233
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
now a fire-starter,

234
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
now a torch-bearer

235
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
in a forgotten ritual,

236
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
little brown druid

237
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
illuminating some ancient night?

238
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And who could fail to notice,

239
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
lit up in the blazing insulation,

240
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the tiny looks of wonderment

241
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
on the faces of his fellow mice --

242
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
one-time inhabitants

243
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
of what once was your house in the country?

244
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Applause)

245
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
BC: Thank you.

246
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
(Applause)

247
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
Thank you. And the last poem is called "The Dead."

248
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I wrote this after a friend's funeral,

249
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but not so much about the friend as something the eulogist kept saying,

250
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
as all eulogists tend to do,

251
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
which is how happy the deceased would be

252
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
to look down and see all of us assembled.

253
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And that to me was a bad start to the afterlife,

254
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
having to witness your own funeral and feel gratified.

255
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So the little poem is called "The Dead."

256
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Video) Narration: "The Dead."

257
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
The dead are always looking down on us,

258
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
they say.

259
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
While we are putting on our shoes or making a sandwich,

260
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
they are looking down

261
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
through the glass-bottom boats of heaven

262
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
as they row themselves slowly

263
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
through eternity.

264
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
They watch the tops of our heads

265
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
moving below on Earth.

266
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
And when we lie down

267
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
in a field or on a couch,

268
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
drugged perhaps

269
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
by the hum of a warm afternoon,

270
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
they think we are looking back at them,

271
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
which makes them lift their oars

272
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
and fall silent

273
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and wait like parents

274
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
for us to close our eyes.

275
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Applause)

276
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
BC: I'm not sure if other poems will be animated.

277
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It took a long time --

278
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I mean, it's rather uncommon to have this marriage --

279
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
a long time to put those two together.

280
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
But then again, it took us a long time

281
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
to put the wheel and the suitcase together.

282
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
(Laughter)

283
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I mean, we had the wheel for some time.

284
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And schlepping is an ancient and honorable art.

285
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Laughter)

286
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I just have time

287
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
to read a more recent poem to you.

288
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
If it has a subject,

289
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
the subject is adolescence.

290
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And it's addressed to a certain person.

291
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
It's called "To My Favorite 17-Year-Old High School Girl."

292
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
"Do you realize that if you had started building the Parthenon

293
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
on the day you were born,

294
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
you would be all done in only one more year?

295
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Of course, you couldn't have done that all alone.

296
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So never mind;

297
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
you're fine just being yourself.

298
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
You're loved for just being you.

299
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But did you know that at your age

300
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Judy Garland was pulling down 150,000 dollars a picture,

301
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Joan of Arc was leading the French army to victory

302
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and Blaise Pascal had cleaned up his room --

303
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
no wait, I mean he had invented the calculator?

304
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Of course, there will be time for all that

305
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
later in your life,

306
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
after you come out of your room

307
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and begin to blossom,

308
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
or at least pick up all your socks.

309
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
For some reason I keep remembering

310
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that Lady Jane Grey was queen of England

311
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
when she was only 15.

312
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
But then she was beheaded, so never mind her as a role model.

313
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
(Laughter)

314
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
A few centuries later,

315
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
when he was your age,

316
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Franz Schubert was doing the dishes for his family,

317
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
but that did not keep him

318
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
from composing two symphonies, four operas

319
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and two complete masses as a youngster.

320
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Laughter)

321
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
But of course, that was in Austria

322
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
at the height of Romantic lyricism,

323
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
not here in the suburbs of Cleveland.

324
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
(Laughter)

325
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Frankly, who cares

326
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
if Annie Oakley was a crack shot at 15

327
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
or if Maria Callas debuted as Tosca at 17?

328
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We think you're special just being you --

329
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
playing with your food and staring into space.

330
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000

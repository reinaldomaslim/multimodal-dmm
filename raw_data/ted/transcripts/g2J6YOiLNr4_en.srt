1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
My story is a little bit about war.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's about disillusionment.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's about death.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And it's about rediscovering

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
idealism

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in all of that wreckage.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And perhaps also, there's a lesson

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
about how to deal with

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
our screwed-up, fragmenting

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and dangerous world of the 21st century.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I don't believe in straightforward narratives.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I don't believe in a life or history

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
written as decision "A" led to consequence "B"

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
led to consequence "C" --

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
these neat narratives that we're presented with,

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and that perhaps we encourage in each other.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I believe in randomness,

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and one of the reasons I believe that

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is because me becoming a diplomat was random.

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'm colorblind.

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I was born unable to see most colors.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
This is why I wear gray and black most of the time,

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and I have to take my wife with me

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to chose clothes.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And I'd always wanted to be a fighter pilot when I was a boy.

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I loved watching planes barrel over

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
our holiday home in the countryside.

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And it was my boyhood dream to be a fighter pilot.

29
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And I did the tests in the Royal Air Force to become a pilot,

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and sure enough, I failed.

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I couldn't see all the blinking different lights,

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and I can't distinguish color.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So I had to choose another career,

34
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and this was in fact relatively easy for me,

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
because I had an abiding passion all the way through my childhood,

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which was international relations.

37
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
As a child,

38
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I read the newspaper thoroughly.

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I was fascinated by the Cold War,

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
by the INF negotiations

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
over intermediate-range nuclear missiles,

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the proxy war between the Soviet Union and the U.S.

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
in Angola or Afghanistan.

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
These things really interested me.

45
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And so I decided quite at an early age

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I wanted to be a diplomat.

47
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And I, one day, I announced this to my parents --

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and my father denies this story to this day --

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I said, "Daddy, I want to be a diplomat."

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And he turned to me, and he said,

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"Carne, you have to be very clever to be a diplomat."

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Laughter)

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And my ambition was sealed.

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
In 1989,

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I entered the British Foreign Service.

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
That year, 5,000 people applied to become a diplomat,

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and 20 of us succeeded.

58
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And as those numbers suggest,

59
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I was inducted into an elite

60
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and fascinating and exhilarating world.

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Being a diplomat, then and now,

62
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
is an incredible job, and I loved every minute of it --

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I enjoyed the status of it.

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I bought myself a nice suit and wore leather-soled shoes

65
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and reveled in

66
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
this amazing access I had to world events.

67
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I traveled to the Gaza Strip.

68
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I headed the Middle East Peace Process section

69
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in the British Foreign Ministry.

70
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
I became a speechwriter

71
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
for the British Foreign Secretary.

72
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I met Yasser Arafat.

73
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I negotiated

74
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
with Saddam's diplomats at the U.N.

75
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Later, I traveled to Kabul

76
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and served in Afghanistan after the fall of the Taliban.

77
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I would travel

78
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in a C-130 transport

79
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and go and visit warlords

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in mountain hideaways

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and negotiate with them

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
about how we were going to eradicate Al Qaeda from Afghanistan,

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
surrounded by my Special Forces escort,

84
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
who, themselves, had to have an escort of a platoon of Royal Marines,

85
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
because it was so dangerous.

86
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And that was exciting -- that was fun.

87
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It was really interesting.

88
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And it's a great cadre of people,

89
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
incredibly close-knit community of people.

90
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And the pinnacle of my career, as it turned out,

91
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
was when I was posted to New York.

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I'd already served in Germany, Norway,

93
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
various other places,

94
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but I was posted to New York

95
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to serve on the U.N. Security Council for the British delegation.

96
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And my responsibility was the Middle East,

97
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
which was my specialty.

98
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And there, I dealt with things

99
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
like the Middle East peace process,

100
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the Lockerbie issue --

101
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
we can talk about that later, if you wish --

102
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but above all, my responsibility was Iraq

103
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and its weapons of mass destruction

104
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and the sanctions we placed on Iraq

105
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to oblige it to disarm itself of these weapons.

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I was the chief British negotiator

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
on the subject,

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and I was steeped in the issue.

109
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And anyway,

110
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
my tour -- it was kind of a very exciting time.

111
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I mean it was very dramatic diplomacy.

112
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We went through several wars

113
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
during my time in New York.

114
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I negotiated for my country

115
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the resolution in the Security Council

116
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
of the 12th of September 2001

117
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
condemning the attacks of the day before,

118
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
which were, of course, deeply present to us

119
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
actually living in New York at the time.

120
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So it was kind of the best of time, worst of times

121
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
kind of experience.

122
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I lived the high-life.

123
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Although I worked very long hours,

124
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I lived in a penthouse in Union Square.

125
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I was a single British diplomat in New York City;

126
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
you can imagine what that might have meant.

127
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I had a good time.

129
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But in 2002,

130
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
when my tour came to an end,

131
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I decided I wasn't going to go back

132
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
to the job that was waiting for me in London.

133
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I decided to take a sabbatical,

134
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in fact, at the New School, Bruce.

135
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
In some inchoate, inarticulate way

136
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I realized that there was something wrong

137
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
with my work, with me.

138
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I was exhausted,

139
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and I was also disillusioned

140
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in a way I couldn't quite put my finger on.

141
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And I decided to take some time out from work.

142
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
The Foreign Office was very generous.

143
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
You could take these special unpaid leave, as they called them,

144
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and yet remain part of the diplomatic service, but not actually do any work.

145
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It was nice.

146
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And eventually, I decided

147
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to take a secondment to join the U.N. in Kosovo,

148
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
which was then under U.N. administration.

149
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And two things happened in Kosovo,

150
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which kind of, again,

151
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
shows the randomness of life,

152
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
because these things turned out to be

153
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
two of the pivots of my life

154
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and helped to deliver me to the next stage.

155
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
But they were random things.

156
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
One was that, in the summer of 2004,

157
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the British government, somewhat reluctantly,

158
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
decided to have an official inquiry

159
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
into the use of intelligence on WMD

160
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in the run up to the Iraq War,

161
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
a very limited subject.

162
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
And I testified to that inquiry in secret.

163
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I had been steeped in the intelligence on Iraq

164
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and its WMD,

165
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and my testimony to the inquiry said three things:

166
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
that the government exaggerated the intelligence,

167
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
which was very clear in all the years I'd read it.

168
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And indeed, our own internal assessment was very clear

169
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that Iraq's WMD

170
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
did not pose a threat to its neighbors, let alone to us.

171
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Secondly, the government had ignored all available alternatives to war,

172
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
which in some ways

173
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
was a more discreditable thing still.

174
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The third reason, I won't go into.

175
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But anyway, I gave that testimony,

176
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and that presented me with a crisis.

177
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
What was I going to do?

178
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
This testimony was deeply critical of my colleagues,

179
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
of my ministers, who had, in my view

180
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
had perpetrated a war on a falsehood.

181
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And so I was in crisis.

182
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And this wasn't a pretty thing.

183
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I moaned about it, I hesitated,

184
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I went on and on and on to my long-suffering wife,

185
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and eventually I decided to resign from the British Foreign Service.

186
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I felt -- there's a scene in the Al Pacino movie "The Insider," which you may know,

187
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
where he goes back to CBS

188
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
after they've let him down over the tobacco guy,

189
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and he goes, "You know, I just can't do this anymore. Something's broken."

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And it was like that for me. I love that movie.

191
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I felt just something's broken.

192
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I can't actually sit with my foreign minister

193
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
or my prime minister again with a smile on my face

194
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and do what I used to do gladly for them.

195
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So took a running leap

196
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and jumped over the edge of a cliff.

197
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And it was a very, very uncomfortable, unpleasant feeling.

198
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And I started to fall.

199
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And today, that fall hasn't stopped;

200
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I'm still falling.

201
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But, in a way, I've got used to the sensation of it.

202
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And in a way, I kind of like

203
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
the sensation of it a lot better

204
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
than I like actually standing on top of the cliff,

205
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
wondering what to do.

206
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
A second thing happened in Kosovo,

207
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
which kind of -- I need a quick gulp of water, forgive me.

208
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
A second thing happened in Kosovo,

209
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
which kind of delivered the answer,

210
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
which I couldn't really answer,

211
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
which is, "What do I do with my life?"

212
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I love diplomacy --

213
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I have no career --

214
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
I expected my entire life to be a diplomat, to be serving my country.

215
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I wanted to be an ambassador,

216
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and my mentors, my heroes,

217
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
people who got to the top of my profession,

218
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and here I was throwing it all away.

219
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
A lot of my friends were still in it.

220
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
My pension was in it.

221
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
And I gave it up.

222
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And what was I going to do?

223
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And that year, in Kosovo,

224
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
this terrible, terrible thing happened, which I saw.

225
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
In March 2004, there were terrible riots

226
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
all over the province -- as it then was -- of Kosovo.

227
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
18 people were killed.

228
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
It was anarchy.

229
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And it's a very horrible thing to see anarchy,

230
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to know that the police and the military --

231
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
there were lots of military troops there --

232
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
actually can't stop that rampaging mob

233
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
who's coming down the street.

234
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And the only way that rampaging mob coming down the street will stop

235
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
is when they decide to stop

236
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and when they've had enough burning and killing.

237
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
And that is not a very nice feeling to see, and I saw it.

238
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And I went through it. I went through those mobs.

239
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
And with my Albanian friends, we tried to stop it, but we failed.

240
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And that riot taught me something,

241
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
which isn't immediately obvious and it's kind of a complicated story.

242
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But one of the reasons that riot took place --

243
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
those riots, which went on for several days, took place --

244
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
was because the Kosovo people

245
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
were disenfranchised from their own future.

246
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
There were diplomatic negotiations about the future of Kosovo

247
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
going on then,

248
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and the Kosovo government, let alone the Kosovo people,

249
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
were not actually

250
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
participating in those talks.

251
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
There was this whole fancy diplomatic system,

252
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
this negotiation process about the future of Kosovo,

253
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and the Kosovars weren't part of it.

254
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And funnily enough, they were frustrated about that.

255
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Those riots were part of the manifestation of that frustration.

256
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It wasn't the only reason,

257
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and life is not simple, one reason narratives.

258
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It was a complicated thing,

259
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and I'm not pretending it was more simple than it was.

260
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But that was one of the reasons.

261
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And that kind of gave me the inspiration --

262
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
or rather to be precise,

263
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
it gave my wife the inspiration.

264
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
She said, "Why don't you advise the Kosovars?

265
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Why don't you advise their government on their diplomacy?"

266
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And the Kosovars were not allowed a diplomatic service.

267
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
They were not allowed diplomats.

268
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
They were not allowed a foreign office

269
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to help them deal with this immensely complicated process,

270
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
which became known as the Final Status Process of Kosovo.

271
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And so that was the idea.

272
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
That was the origin of the thing that became Independent Diplomat,

273
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
the world's first diplomatic advisory group

274
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and a non-profit to boot.

275
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And it began when I flew back from London

276
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
after my time at the U.N. in Kosovo.

277
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I flew back and had dinner with the Kosovo prime minister and said to him,

278
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
"Look, I'm proposing that I come and advise you on the diplomacy.

279
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I know this stuff. It's what I do. Why don't I come and help you?"

280
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And he raised his glass of raki to me and said,

281
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
"Yes, Carne. Come."

282
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And I came to Kosovo

283
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and advised the Kosovo government.

284
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Independent Diplomat ended up advising three successive Kosovo prime ministers

285
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and the multi-party negotiation team of Kosovo.

286
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And Kosovo became independent.

287
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Independent Diplomat is now established

288
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in five diplomatic centers around the world,

289
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and we're advising seven or eight

290
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
different countries, or political groups,

291
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
depending on how you wish to define them --

292
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and I'm not big on definitions.

293
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
We're advising the Northern Cypriots on how to reunify their island.

294
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
We're advising the Burmese opposition,

295
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
the government of Southern Sudan,

296
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
which -- you heard it here first --

297
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
is going to be a new country within the next few years.

298
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We're advising the Polisario Front of the Western Sahara,

299
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
who are fighting to get their country back

300
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
from Moroccan occupation

301
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
after 34 years of dispossession.

302
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We're advising various island states in the climate change negotiations,

303
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
which is suppose to culminate

304
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
in Copenhagen.

305
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
There's a bit of randomness here too

306
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
because, when I was beginning Independent Diplomat,

307
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I went to a party in the House of Lords,

308
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
which is a ridiculous place,

309
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
but I was holding my drink like this, and I bumped into

310
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
this guy who was standing behind me.

311
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And we started talking, and he said --

312
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I told him what I was doing,

313
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and I told him rather grandly

314
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I was going to establish Independent Diplomat in New York.

315
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
At that time there was just me --

316
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and me and my wife were moving back to New York.

317
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And he said, "Why don't you see my colleagues in New York?"

318
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And it turned out

319
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
he worked for an innovation company called ?What If!,

320
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
which some of you have probably heard of.

321
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And one thing led to another,

322
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and I ended up having a desk

323
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
in ?What If! in New York,

324
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
when I started Independent Diplomat.

325
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And watching ?What If!

326
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
develop new flavors of chewing gum for Wrigley

327
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
or new flavors for Coke

328
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
actually helped me innovate

329
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
new strategies for the Kosovars

330
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and for the Saharawis of the Western Sahara.

331
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And I began to realize that there are different ways of doing diplomacy --

332
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
that diplomacy, like business,

333
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
is a business of solving problems,

334
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and yet the word innovation doesn't exist in diplomacy;

335
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
it's all zero sum games and realpolitik

336
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and ancient institutions that have been there for generations

337
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and do things the same way they've always done things.

338
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And Independent Diplomat, today,

339
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
tries to incorporate some of the things I learned at ?What If!.

340
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
We all sit in one office and shout at each other across the office.

341
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
We all work on little laptops and try to move desks to change the way we think.

342
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And we use naive experts

343
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
who may know nothing about the countries we're dealing with,

344
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
but may know something about something else

345
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
to try to inject new thinking

346
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
into the problems

347
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that we try to address for our clients.

348
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
It's not easy, because our clients, by definition,

349
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
are having a difficult time, diplomatically.

350
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
There are, I don't know,

351
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
some lessons from all of this,

352
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
personal and political --

353
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and in a way, they're the same thing.

354
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The personal one

355
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
is falling off a cliff

356
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
is actually a good thing, and I recommend it.

357
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And it's a good thing to do at least once in your life

358
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
just to tear everything up and jump.

359
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
The second thing is a bigger lesson about the world today.

360
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Independent Diplomat is part of a trend

361
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
which is emerging and evident across the world,

362
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
which is that the world is fragmenting.

363
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
States mean less than they used to,

364
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and the power of the state is declining.

365
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
That means the power of others things is rising.

366
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Those other things are called non-state actors.

367
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
They may be corporations,

368
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
they may be mafiosi, they may be nice NGOs,

369
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
they may anything,

370
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
any number of things.

371
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We are living in a more complicated and fragmented world.

372
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
If governments are less able

373
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
to affect the problems

374
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
that affect us in the world,

375
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
then that means, who is left to deal with them,

376
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
who has to take greater responsibility to deal with them?

377
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Us.

378
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
If they can't do it, who's left to deal with it?

379
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
We have no choice but to embrace that reality.

380
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
What this means is

381
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
it's no longer good enough

382
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
to say that international relations, or global affairs,

383
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
or chaos in Somalia,

384
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
or what's going on in Burma is none of your business,

385
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
and that you can leave it to governments to get on with.

386
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
I can connect any one of you

387
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
by six degrees of separation

388
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
to the Al-Shabaab militia in Somalia.

389
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Ask me how later, particularly if you eat fish, interestingly enough,

390
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
but that connection is there.

391
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
We are all intimately connected.

392
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And this isn't just Tom Friedman,

393
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
it's actually provable in case after case after case.

394
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
What that means is, instead of asking your politicians to do things,

395
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
you have to look to yourself to do things.

396
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And Independent Diplomat is a kind of example of this

397
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
in a sort of loose way.

398
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
There aren't neat examples, but one example is this:

399
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
the way the world is changing

400
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
is embodied in what's going on at the place I used to work --

401
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
the U.N. Security Council.

402
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
The U.N. was established in 1945.

403
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Its charter is basically designed

404
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
to stop conflicts between states --

405
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
interstate conflict.

406
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Today, 80 percent of the agenda

407
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
of the U.N. Security Council

408
0:16:50.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
is about conflicts within states,

409
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
involving non-state parties --

410
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
guerillas, separatists,

411
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
terrorists, if you want to call them that,

412
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
people who are not normal governments, who are not normal states.

413
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
That is the state of the world today.

414
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
When I realized this,

415
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
and when I look back on my time at the Security Council

416
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and what happened with the Kosovars,

417
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and I realize that often

418
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
the people who were most directly affected

419
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
by what we were doing in the Security Council

420
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:19,000
weren't actually there, weren't actually invited

421
0:17:19.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
to give their views to the Security Council,

422
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
I thought, this is wrong.

423
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
Something's got to be done about this.

424
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
So I started off in a traditional mode.

425
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Me and my colleagues at Independent Diplomat

426
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
went around the U.N. Security Council.

427
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
We went around 70 U.N. member states --

428
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
the Kazaks, the Ethiopians, the Israelis --

429
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
you name them, we went to see them --

430
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
the secretary general, all of them,

431
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
and said, "This is all wrong.

432
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
This is terrible that you don't consult these people who are actually affected.

433
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
You've got to institutionalize a system

434
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
where you actually invite the Kosovars

435
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
to come and tell you what they think.

436
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
This will allow you to tell me -- you can tell them what you think.

437
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
It'll be great. You can have an exchange.

438
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
You can actually incorporate these people's views into your decisions,

439
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
which means your decisions will be more effective and durable."

440
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Super-logical, you would think.

441
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
I mean, incredibly logical. So obvious, anybody could get it.

442
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
And of course, everybody got it. Everybody went, "Yes, of course, you're absolutely right.

443
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
Come back to us

444
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
in maybe six months."

445
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And of course, nothing happened -- nobody did anything.

446
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
The Security Council does its business

447
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
in exactly the same way today

448
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
that it did X number of years ago,

449
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:26,000
when I was there 10 years ago.

450
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
So we looked at that observation

451
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
of basically failure

452
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:32,000
and thought, what can we do about it.

453
0:18:32.26,000 --> 0:18:34,000
And I thought, I'm buggered

454
0:18:34.26,000 --> 0:18:36,000
if I'm going to spend the rest of my life

455
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
lobbying for these crummy governments

456
0:18:38.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
to do what needs to be done.

457
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
So what we're going to do

458
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:44,000
is we're actually going to set up these meetings ourselves.

459
0:18:44.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
So now, Independent Diplomat

460
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:48,000
is in the process of setting up meetings

461
0:18:48.26,000 --> 0:18:5,000
between the U.N. Security Council

462
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
and the parties to the disputes

463
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
that are on the agenda of the Security Council.

464
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
So we will be bringing

465
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:19:,000
Darfuri rebel groups,

466
0:19:00.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
the Northern Cypriots and the Southern Cypriots,

467
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:07,000
rebels from Aceh,

468
0:19:07.26,000 --> 0:19:09,000
and awful long laundry list

469
0:19:09.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
of chaotic conflicts around the world.

470
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
And we will be trying to bring the parties to New York

471
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:17,000
to sit down in a quiet room

472
0:19:17.26,000 --> 0:19:19,000
in a private setting with no press

473
0:19:19.26,000 --> 0:19:21,000
and actually explain what they want

474
0:19:21.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
to the members of the U. N. Security Council,

475
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
and for the members of the U.N. Security Council

476
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:27,000
to explain to them what they want.

477
0:19:27.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
So there's actually a conversation,

478
0:19:29.26,000 --> 0:19:31,000
which has never before happened.

479
0:19:31.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
And of course, describing all this,

480
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:37,000
any of you who know politics will think this is incredibly difficult,

481
0:19:37.26,000 --> 0:19:39,000
and I entirely agree with you.

482
0:19:39.26,000 --> 0:19:42,000
The chances of failure are very high,

483
0:19:42.26,000 --> 0:19:44,000
but it certainly won't happen

484
0:19:44.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
if we don't try to make it happen.

485
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
And my politics has changed fundamentally

486
0:19:50.26,000 --> 0:19:52,000
from when I was a diplomat to what I am today,

487
0:19:52.26,000 --> 0:19:55,000
and I think that outputs is what matters, not process,

488
0:19:55.26,000 --> 0:19:58,000
not technology, frankly, so much either.

489
0:19:58.26,000 --> 0:20:,000
Preach technology

490
0:20:00.26,000 --> 0:20:03,000
to all the Twittering members of all the Iranian demonstrations

491
0:20:03.26,000 --> 0:20:06,000
who are now in political prison in Tehran,

492
0:20:06.26,000 --> 0:20:08,000
where Ahmadinejad remains in power.

493
0:20:08.26,000 --> 0:20:11,000
Technology has not delivered political change in Iran.

494
0:20:12.26,000 --> 0:20:15,000
You've got to look at the outputs, and you got to say to yourself,

495
0:20:15.26,000 --> 0:20:17,000
"What can I do to produce that particular output?"

496
0:20:17.26,000 --> 0:20:2,000
That is the politics of the 21st century,

497
0:20:20.26,000 --> 0:20:22,000
and in a way, Independent Diplomat

498
0:20:22.26,000 --> 0:20:25,000
embodies that fragmentation, that change,

499
0:20:25.26,000 --> 0:20:28,000
that is happening to all of us.

500
0:20:29.26,000 --> 0:20:31,000
That's my story. Thanks.

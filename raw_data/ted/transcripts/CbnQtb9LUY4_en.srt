1
0:00:12.686,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Do you ever wonder why we're surrounded with things that help us do everything

2
0:00:16.608,000 --> 0:00:19,000
faster and faster and faster?

3
0:00:20.294,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Communicate faster,

4
0:00:21.559,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but also work faster, bank faster,

5
0:00:24.529,000 --> 0:00:26,000
travel faster, find a date faster,

6
0:00:27.487,000 --> 0:00:31,000
cook faster, clean faster and do all of it all at the same time?

7
0:00:32.803,000 --> 0:00:36,000
How do you feel about cramming even more into every waking hour?

8
0:00:38.69,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Well, to my generation of Americans,

9
0:00:40.927,000 --> 0:00:42,000
speed feels like a birthright.

10
0:00:43.2,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Sometimes I think our minimum speed is Mach 3.

11
0:00:46.567,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Anything less, and we fear losing our competitive edge.

12
0:00:50.634,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But even my generation is starting to question

13
0:00:53.285,000 --> 0:00:55,000
whether we're the masters of speed

14
0:00:55.796,000 --> 0:00:57,000
or if speed is mastering us.

15
0:00:59.475,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I'm an anthropologist at the Rand Corporation,

16
0:01:01.921,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and while many anthropologists study ancient cultures,

17
0:01:04.72,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I focus on modern day cultures and how we're adapting

18
0:01:07.762,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to all of this change happening in the world.

19
0:01:11.681,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Recently, I teamed up with an engineer, Seifu Chonde, to study speed.

20
0:01:17.009,000 --> 0:01:22,000
We were interested both in how people are adapting to this age of acceleration

21
0:01:22.067,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and its security and policy implications.

22
0:01:25.556,000 --> 0:01:27,000
What could our world look like in 25 years

23
0:01:28.04,000 --> 0:01:3,000
if the current pace of change keeps accelerating?

24
0:01:30.947,000 --> 0:01:31,000
What would it mean for transportation,

25
0:01:32.836,000 --> 0:01:34,000
or learning, communication,

26
0:01:35.256,000 --> 0:01:37,000
manufacturing, weaponry

27
0:01:37.717,000 --> 0:01:38,000
or even natural selection?

28
0:01:40.253,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Will a faster future make us more secure and productive?

29
0:01:44.279,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Or will it make us more vulnerable?

30
0:01:47.203,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In our research, people accepted acceleration as inevitable,

31
0:01:51.231,000 --> 0:01:53,000
both the thrills and the lack of control.

32
0:01:53.924,000 --> 0:01:55,000
They fear that if they were to slow down,

33
0:01:56.085,000 --> 0:01:58,000
they might run the risk of becoming obsolete.

34
0:01:58.767,000 --> 0:02:,000
They say they'd rather burn out than rust out.

35
0:02:02.285,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Yet at the same time,

36
0:02:03.6,000 --> 0:02:06,000
they worry that speed could erode their cultural traditions

37
0:02:06.817,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and their sense of home.

38
0:02:09.524,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But even people who are winning at the speed game

39
0:02:11.9,000 --> 0:02:12,000
admit to feeling a little uneasy.

40
0:02:13.808,000 --> 0:02:16,000
They see acceleration as widening the gap between the haves,

41
0:02:17.431,000 --> 0:02:19,000
the jet-setters who are buzzing around,

42
0:02:19.95,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and the have-nots,

43
0:02:21.34,000 --> 0:02:23,000
who are left in the digital dust.

44
0:02:24.984,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Yes, we have good reason to forecast that the future will be faster,

45
0:02:29.072,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but what I've come to realize

46
0:02:30.819,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is that speed is paradoxical,

47
0:02:33.366,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and like all good paradoxes,

48
0:02:35.198,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it teaches us about the human experience,

49
0:02:37.921,000 --> 0:02:4,000
as absurd and complex as it is.

50
0:02:41.899,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The first paradox is that we love speed,

51
0:02:44.335,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and we're thrilled by its intensity.

52
0:02:46.44,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But our prehistoric brains aren't really built for it,

53
0:02:50.136,000 --> 0:02:54,000
so we invent roller coasters and race cars and supersonic planes,

54
0:02:54.627,000 --> 0:02:57,000
but we get whiplash, carsick,

55
0:02:57.776,000 --> 0:02:58,000
jet-lagged.

56
0:02:59.584,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We didn't evolve to multitask.

57
0:03:01.885,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Rather, we evolved to do one thing with incredible focus,

58
0:03:06.013,000 --> 0:03:08,000
like hunt -- not necessarily with great speed

59
0:03:08.931,000 --> 0:03:1,000
but with endurance for great distance.

60
0:03:11.705,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But now there's a widening gap between our biology and our lifestyles,

61
0:03:15.875,000 --> 0:03:19,000
a mismatch between what our bodies are built for and what we're making them do.

62
0:03:20.87,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's a phenomenon my mentors have called "Stone Agers in the fast lane."

63
0:03:26.239,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:28.087,000 --> 0:03:31,000
A second paradox of speed is that it can be measured objectively. Right?

65
0:03:31.609,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Miles per hour, gigabytes per second.

66
0:03:34.939,000 --> 0:03:36,000
But how speed feels,

67
0:03:37.203,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and whether we like it,

68
0:03:38.679,000 --> 0:03:39,000
is highly subjective.

69
0:03:40.717,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So we can document

70
0:03:42.504,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that the pace at which we are adopting new technologies is increasing.

71
0:03:46.787,000 --> 0:03:51,000
For example, it took 85 years from the introduction of the telephone

72
0:03:51.993,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to when the majority of Americans had phones at home.

73
0:03:55.438,000 --> 0:03:59,000
In contrast, it only took 13 years for most of us to have smartphones.

74
0:04:00.627,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And how people act and react to speed

75
0:04:03.25,000 --> 0:04:07,000
varies by culture and among different people within the same culture.

76
0:04:08.251,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Interactions that could be seen as pleasantly brisk and convenient

77
0:04:11.432,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in some cultures

78
0:04:12.775,000 --> 0:04:14,000
could be seen as horribly rude in others.

79
0:04:14.824,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I mean, you wouldn't go asking for a to-go cup at a Japanese tea ceremony

80
0:04:19.255,000 --> 0:04:21,000
so you could jet off to your next tourist stop.

81
0:04:21.791,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Would you?

82
0:04:23.968,000 --> 0:04:27,000
A third paradox is that speed begets speed.

83
0:04:28.264,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The faster I respond, the more responses I get,

84
0:04:30.544,000 --> 0:04:31,000
the faster I have to respond again.

85
0:04:33.241,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Having more communication

86
0:04:35.215,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and information at our fingertips

87
0:04:37.478,000 --> 0:04:38,000
at any given moment

88
0:04:39.121,000 --> 0:04:42,000
was supposed to make decision-making easier and more rational.

89
0:04:44.209,000 --> 0:04:46,000
But that doesn't really seem to be happening.

90
0:04:47.759,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Here's just one more paradox:

91
0:04:50.601,000 --> 0:04:55,000
If all of these faster technologies were supposed to free us from drudgery,

92
0:04:56.095,000 --> 0:04:58,000
why do we all feel so pressed for time?

93
0:04:58.99,000 --> 0:05:,000
Why are we crashing our cars in record numbers,

94
0:05:01.749,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because we think we have to answer that text right away?

95
0:05:05.878,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Shouldn't life in the fast lane feel a little more fun

96
0:05:09.398,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and a little less anxious?

97
0:05:11.464,000 --> 0:05:13,000
German speakers even have a word for this:

98
0:05:13.972,000 --> 0:05:14,000
"Eilkrankheit."

99
0:05:15.44,000 --> 0:05:18,000
In English, that's "hurry sickness."

100
0:05:19.055,000 --> 0:05:21,000
When we have to make fast decisions,

101
0:05:21.768,000 --> 0:05:22,000
autopilot brain kicks in,

102
0:05:23.614,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and we rely on our learned behaviors,

103
0:05:26.276,000 --> 0:05:29,000
our reflexes, our cognitive biases,

104
0:05:30.122,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to help us perceive and respond quickly.

105
0:05:33.502,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Sometimes that saves our lives, right?

106
0:05:35.527,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Fight or flight.

107
0:05:37.134,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But sometimes, it leads us astray in the long run.

108
0:05:41.443,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Oftentimes, when our society has major failures,

109
0:05:44.958,000 --> 0:05:46,000
they're not technological failures.

110
0:05:47.88,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They're failures that happen when we made decisions too quickly

111
0:05:51.725,000 --> 0:05:52,000
on autopilot.

112
0:05:53.264,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We didn't do the creative or critical thinking required

113
0:05:56.099,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to connect the dots

114
0:05:57.518,000 --> 0:05:58,000
or weed out false information

115
0:05:59.359,000 --> 0:06:01,000
or make sense of complexity.

116
0:06:02.352,000 --> 0:06:05,000
That kind of thinking can't be done fast.

117
0:06:05.713,000 --> 0:06:06,000
That's slow thinking.

118
0:06:08.218,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Two psychologists, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky,

119
0:06:11.304,000 --> 0:06:14,000
started pointing this out back in 1974,

120
0:06:14.553,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and we're still struggling to do something with their insights.

121
0:06:19.34,000 --> 0:06:23,000
All of modern history can be thought of as one spurt of acceleration after another.

122
0:06:23.794,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It's as if we think if we just speed up enough,

123
0:06:26.155,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we can outrun our problems.

124
0:06:28.797,000 --> 0:06:29,000
But we never do.

125
0:06:30.354,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We know this in our own lives,

126
0:06:32.179,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and policymakers know it, too.

127
0:06:34.94,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So now we're turning to artificial intelligence

128
0:06:37.271,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to help us make faster and smarter decisions

129
0:06:39.704,000 --> 0:06:42,000
to process this ever-expanding universe of data.

130
0:06:44.412,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But machines crunching data are no substitute

131
0:06:47.848,000 --> 0:06:49,000
for critical and sustained thinking

132
0:06:50.314,000 --> 0:06:51,000
by humans,

133
0:06:51.548,000 --> 0:06:55,000
whose Stone Age brains need a little time to let their impulses subside,

134
0:06:56.433,000 --> 0:06:57,000
to slow the mind

135
0:06:58.164,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and let the thoughts flow.

136
0:07:01.04,000 --> 0:07:04,000
If you're starting to think that we should just hit the brakes,

137
0:07:04.236,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that won't always be the right solution.

138
0:07:07.413,000 --> 0:07:11,000
We all know that a train that's going too fast around a bend can derail,

139
0:07:11.534,000 --> 0:07:12,000
but Seifu, the engineer,

140
0:07:13.52,000 --> 0:07:17,000
taught me that a train that's going too slowly around a bend can also derail.

141
0:07:18.86,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So managing this spurt of acceleration starts with the understanding

142
0:07:23.837,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that we have more control over speed than we think we do,

143
0:07:27.397,000 --> 0:07:3,000
individually and as a society.

144
0:07:30.602,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Sometimes, we'll need to engineer ourselves to go faster.

145
0:07:33.904,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We'll want to solve gridlock,

146
0:07:35.735,000 --> 0:07:37,000
speed up disaster relief for hurricane victims

147
0:07:38.414,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or use 3-D printing to produce what we need on the spot,

148
0:07:41.856,000 --> 0:07:42,000
just when we need it.

149
0:07:43.955,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Sometimes, though, we'll want to make our surroundings feel slower

150
0:07:47.92,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to engineer the crash out of the speedy experience.

151
0:07:51.861,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And it's OK not to be stimulated all the time.

152
0:07:55.761,000 --> 0:07:56,000
It's good for adults

153
0:07:57.291,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and for kids.

154
0:07:59.043,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Maybe it's boring, but it gives us time to reflect.

155
0:08:03.258,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Slow time is not wasted time.

156
0:08:08.142,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And we need to reconsider what it means to save time.

157
0:08:12.318,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Culture and rituals around the world build in slowness,

158
0:08:16.219,000 --> 0:08:2,000
because slowness helps us reinforce our shared values and connect.

159
0:08:20.805,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And connection is a critical part of being human.

160
0:08:25.387,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We need to master speed,

161
0:08:27.055,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and that means thinking carefully about the trade-offs of any given technology.

162
0:08:31.629,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Will it help you reclaim time that you can use to express your humanity?

163
0:08:36.07,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Will it give you hurry sickness? Will it give other people hurry sickness?

164
0:08:39.88,000 --> 0:08:43,000
If you're lucky enough to decide the pace that you want to travel through life,

165
0:08:44.426,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it's a privilege.

166
0:08:46.464,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Use it.

167
0:08:48.25,000 --> 0:08:5,000
You might decide that you need both to speed up

168
0:08:50.991,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and to create slow time:

169
0:08:53.869,000 --> 0:08:54,000
time to reflect,

170
0:08:55.623,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to percolate

171
0:08:57.276,000 --> 0:08:58,000
at your own pace;

172
0:08:59.688,000 --> 0:09:,000
time to listen,

173
0:09:01.611,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to empathize,

174
0:09:03.517,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to rest your mind,

175
0:09:05.89,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to linger at the dinner table.

176
0:09:09.402,000 --> 0:09:1,000
So as we zoom into the future,

177
0:09:11.411,000 --> 0:09:14,000
let's consider setting the technologies of speed,

178
0:09:15.196,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the purpose of speed

179
0:09:17.101,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and our expectations of speed

180
0:09:19.82,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to a more human pace.

181
0:09:22.76,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Thank you.

182
0:09:23.937,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Applause)

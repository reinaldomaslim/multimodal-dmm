Julie Taymor: Thank you. Thank you very much.

10
0:01:34.469,000 --> 0:01:36,000
That's a few samples of the theater, opera

11
0:01:37.186,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and films that I have done over the last 20 years.

12
0:01:40.528,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But what I'd like to begin with right now

13
0:01:42.566,000 --> 0:01:43,000
is to take you back to a moment

14
0:01:44.469,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that I went through in Indonesia,

15
0:01:46.934,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which is a seminal moment in my life

16
0:01:49.071,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and, like all myths,

17
0:01:51.151,000 --> 0:01:53,000
these stories need to be retold

18
0:01:53.406,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and told, lest we forget them.

19
0:01:55.905,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And when I'm in the turbulent times, as we know,

20
0:01:58.929,000 --> 0:02:,000
that I am right now, through the crucible

21
0:02:01.317,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and the fire of transformation,

22
0:02:03.508,000 --> 0:02:05,000
which is what all of you do, actually.

23
0:02:06.126,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Anybody who creates knows there's that point where

24
0:02:09.25,000 --> 0:02:14,000
it hasn't quite become the phoenix or the burnt char.

25
0:02:14.359,000 --> 0:02:16,000
(Laughter)

26
0:02:16.457,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And I am right there on the edge,

27
0:02:19.362,000 --> 0:02:2,000
which I'll tell you about, another story.

28
0:02:21.339,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I want to go back to Indonesia

29
0:02:22.792,000 --> 0:02:25,000
where I was about 21, 22 years, a long time ago,

30
0:02:26.476,000 --> 0:02:27,000
on a fellowship.

31
0:02:27.7,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And I found myself, after two years there

32
0:02:30.63,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and performing and learning, on the island of Bali,

33
0:02:33.979,000 --> 0:02:36,000
on the edge of a crater, Gunung Batur.

34
0:02:37.806,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And I was in a village where there was

35
0:02:40.823,000 --> 0:02:42,000
an initiation ceremony for the young men,

36
0:02:43.615,000 --> 0:02:44,000
a rite of passage.

37
0:02:45.179,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Little did I know that it was mine as well.

38
0:02:47.731,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And as I sat in this temple square

39
0:02:50.19,000 --> 0:02:52,000
under this gigantic beringin banyan tree,

40
0:02:53.19,000 --> 0:02:57,000
in the dark, there was no electricity, just the full moon,

41
0:02:58.027,000 --> 0:03:,000
down in this empty square,

42
0:03:00.083,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and I heard the most beautiful sounds,

43
0:03:02.233,000 --> 0:03:03,000
like a Charles Ives concert

44
0:03:04.064,000 --> 0:03:06,000
as I listened to the gamelan music

45
0:03:06.107,000 --> 0:03:08,000
from all the different villagers that came

46
0:03:08.156,000 --> 0:03:11,000
for this once-every-five-years ceremony.

47
0:03:11.554,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And I thought I was alone in the dark under this tree.

48
0:03:15.149,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And all of a sudden, out of the dark,

49
0:03:17.98,000 --> 0:03:18,000
from the other end of the square,

50
0:03:19.864,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I saw the glint of mirrors lit by the moon.

51
0:03:23.772,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And these 20 old men who I'd seen before

52
0:03:27.331,000 --> 0:03:32,000
all of a sudden stood up in these full warrior costumes

53
0:03:32.633,000 --> 0:03:34,000
with the headdress and the spears,

54
0:03:35.118,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and no one was in the square, and I was hidden in the shadows.

55
0:03:39.48,000 --> 0:03:41,000
No one was there, and they came out,

56
0:03:41.841,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and they did this incredible dance.

57
0:03:45.48,000 --> 0:03:48,000
"Huhuhuhuhuhuhuhahahahaha."

58
0:03:49.172,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And they moved their bodies and they came forward,

59
0:03:52.345,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and the lights bounced off these costumes.

60
0:03:55.147,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And I've been in theater since I was 11 years old,

61
0:03:58.563,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and performing, creating, and I went,

62
0:04:01.777,000 --> 0:04:03,000
"Who are they performing for

63
0:04:03.92,000 --> 0:04:05,000
with these elaborate costumes,

64
0:04:06.267,000 --> 0:04:08,000
these extraordinary headdresses?"

65
0:04:08.294,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And I realized that they were performing for God,

66
0:04:13.081,000 --> 0:04:15,000
whatever that means.

67
0:04:15.792,000 --> 0:04:18,000
But somehow, it didn't matter about the publicity.

68
0:04:19.38,000 --> 0:04:21,000
There was no money involved.

69
0:04:21.631,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It wasn't going to be written down. It was no news.

70
0:04:24.851,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And there were these incredible artists

71
0:04:26.997,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that felt for me like an eternity as they performed.

72
0:04:30.498,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The next moment,

73
0:04:32.583,000 --> 0:04:36,000
as soon as they finished and disappeared into the shadows,

74
0:04:36.643,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a young man with a propane lantern came on,

75
0:04:39.149,000 --> 0:04:41,000
hung it up on a tree, set up a curtain.

76
0:04:41.4,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The village square was filled with hundreds of people.

77
0:04:44.861,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And they put on an opera all night long.

78
0:04:47.399,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Human beings needed the light.

79
0:04:49.659,000 --> 0:04:51,000
They needed the light to see.

80
0:04:52.296,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So what I gained and gathered from this incredible,

81
0:04:55.944,000 --> 0:04:57,000
seminal moment in my life as a young artist

82
0:04:58.556,000 --> 0:05:01,000
was that you must be true

83
0:05:01.879,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to what you believe as an artist all the way through,

84
0:05:05.951,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but you also have to be aware

85
0:05:09.49,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that the audience is out there in our lives at this time,

86
0:05:12.979,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and they also need the light.

87
0:05:14.384,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And it's this incredible balance

88
0:05:16.547,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that I think that we walk

89
0:05:18.296,000 --> 0:05:21,000
when we are creating something that is breaking ground,

90
0:05:21.629,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that's trying to do something you've never seen before,

91
0:05:24.283,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that imaginary world

92
0:05:25.969,000 --> 0:05:28,000
where you actually don't know where you're going to end up,

93
0:05:29.346,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that's the fine line on the edge of a crater

94
0:05:32.112,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that I have walked my whole life.

95
0:05:34.742,000 --> 0:05:36,000
What I would like to do now is to tell you

96
0:05:37.29,000 --> 0:05:38,000
a little bit

97
0:05:39.096,000 --> 0:05:41,000
about how I work. Let's take "The Lion King."

98
0:05:41.953,000 --> 0:05:43,000
You saw many examples of my work up there,

99
0:05:44.205,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but it's one that people know.

100
0:05:46.15,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I start with the notion of the ideograph.

101
0:05:48.849,000 --> 0:05:51,000
An ideograph is like a brush painting, a Japanese brush painting.

102
0:05:52.224,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Three strokes, you get the whole bamboo forest.

103
0:05:55.733,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I go to the concept of "The Lion King"

104
0:05:58.264,000 --> 0:06:,000
and I say, "What is the essence of it?

105
0:06:00.332,000 --> 0:06:01,000
What is the abstraction?

106
0:06:01.968,000 --> 0:06:04,000
If I were to reduce this entire story

107
0:06:05.229,000 --> 0:06:07,000
into one image, what would it be?"

108
0:06:07.97,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The circle. The circle. It's so obvious.

109
0:06:10.924,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The circle of life. The circle of Mufasa's mask.

110
0:06:14.901,000 --> 0:06:18,000
The circle that, when we come to Act II and there's a drought,

111
0:06:19.441,000 --> 0:06:2,000
how do you express drought?

112
0:06:20.92,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's a circle of silk on the floor

113
0:06:24.079,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that disappears into the hole in the stage floor.

114
0:06:28.133,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The circle of life comes in the wheels

115
0:06:30.762,000 --> 0:06:32,000
of the gazelles that leap.

116
0:06:33.21,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And you see the mechanics.

117
0:06:34.932,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And being a theater person, what I know and love about the theater

118
0:06:38.31,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is that when the audience comes in

119
0:06:40.005,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and they suspend their disbelief,

120
0:06:41.799,000 --> 0:06:43,000
when you see men walking or women walking

121
0:06:44.634,000 --> 0:06:45,000
with a platter of grass on their heads,

122
0:06:46.531,000 --> 0:06:47,000
you know it's the savanna.

123
0:06:48.147,000 --> 0:06:49,000
You don't question that.

124
0:06:49.691,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I love the apparent truth of theater.

125
0:06:52.175,000 --> 0:06:55,000
I love that people are willing to fill in the blanks.

126
0:06:55.772,000 --> 0:06:56,000
The audience is willing to say,

127
0:06:57.792,000 --> 0:06:59,000
"Oh, I know that's not a real sun.

128
0:07:00.792,000 --> 0:07:02,000
You took pieces of sticks.

129
0:07:03.1,000 --> 0:07:05,000
You added silk to the bottom.

130
0:07:05.195,000 --> 0:07:08,000
You suspended these pieces. You let it fall flat on the floor.

131
0:07:08.899,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And as it rises with the strings, I see that it's a sun.

132
0:07:13.302,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But the beauty of it is that it's just silk and sticks.

133
0:07:17.709,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And in a way, that is what makes it spiritual.

134
0:07:22.261,000 --> 0:07:23,000
That's what moves you.

135
0:07:23.706,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's not the actual literal sunrise that's coming.

136
0:07:27.922,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's the art of it.

137
0:07:29.453,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So in the theater, as much as the story is critical

138
0:07:34.813,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and the book and the language,

139
0:07:36.718,000 --> 0:07:4,000
the telling of the story, how it's told,

140
0:07:41.369,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the mechanics, the methods that you use,

141
0:07:44.987,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is equal to the story itself.

142
0:07:47.586,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And I'm one who loves high tech and low tech.

143
0:07:50.924,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So I could go from --

144
0:07:52.723,000 --> 0:07:54,000
For instance, I'll show you some "Spider-Man" later,

145
0:07:55.224,000 --> 0:07:57,000
these incredible machines that move people along.

146
0:07:57.8,000 --> 0:07:59,000
But the fact is, without the dancer

147
0:08:00.166,000 --> 0:08:02,000
who knows how to use his body and swing on those wires,

148
0:08:02.919,000 --> 0:08:03,000
it's nothing.

149
0:08:04.706,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So now I'm going to show you

150
0:08:07.615,000 --> 0:08:11,000
some clips from the other big project of my life this year,

151
0:08:11.933,000 --> 0:08:12,000
"The Tempest."

152
0:08:12.975,000 --> 0:08:16,000
It's a movie. I did "The Tempest" on a stage three times

153
0:08:17.068,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in the theater since 1984, '86,

154
0:08:20.305,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and I love the play.

155
0:08:22.509,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I did it always with a male Prospero.

156
0:08:25.035,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And all of a sudden, I thought,

157
0:08:26.697,000 --> 0:08:28,000
"Well, who am I gonna get to play Prospero?

158
0:08:28.783,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Why not Helen Mirren? She's a great actor. Why not?"

159
0:08:32.505,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And this material really did work for a woman equally as well.

160
0:08:35.765,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So now, let's take a look at some of the images

161
0:08:38.86,000 --> 0:08:39,000
from "The Tempest."

162
0:08:40.853,000 --> 0:08:44,000
(Music)

163
0:08:57.22,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Video) Prospera: Hast thou, spirit, performed to the point the tempest that I bade thee?

164
0:09:01.483,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Ariel: I boarded the king's ship. In every cabin, I flamed amazement.

165
0:09:09.664,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Prospera: At first sight, they have changed eyes.

166
0:09:12.62,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Miranda: Do you love me?

167
0:09:13.815,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Ferdinand: Beyond all limit.

168
0:09:15.191,000 --> 0:09:17,000
HM: They are both in either's powers.

169
0:09:17.783,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Trinculo: Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows.

170
0:09:22.914,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Music)

171
0:09:26.156,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Looking for business, governor?

172
0:09:29.633,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Caliban: Hast thou not dropped from heaven?

173
0:09:31.705,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Stephano: Out of the moon, I do assure thee.

174
0:09:34.19,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Prospera: Caliban!

175
0:09:36.187,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Caliban: This island is mine.

176
0:09:38.452,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Prospera: For this, be sure, tonight thou shalt have cramps.

177
0:09:41.997,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Antonio: Here lies your brother no better than the earth he lies upon.

178
0:09:45.506,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Sebastian: Draw thy sword.

179
0:09:47.305,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And I, the king, shall love thee.

180
0:09:50.914,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Prospera: I will plague them all, even to roaring.

181
0:09:58.133,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Ariel: I have made you mad.

182
0:10:08.874,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Prospera: We are such stuff as dreams are made on.

183
0:10:11.919,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and our little life is rounded with a sleep.

184
0:10:16.13,000 --> 0:10:21,000
(Music)

185
0:10:21.455,000 --> 0:10:23,000
JT: Okay.

186
0:10:24.305,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Applause)

187
0:10:28.279,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So I went from theater, doing "The Tempest"

188
0:10:30.707,000 --> 0:10:32,000
on the stage in a very low-budget production

189
0:10:33.031,000 --> 0:10:34,000
many years ago,

190
0:10:34.669,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and I love the play, and I also think

191
0:10:37.114,000 --> 0:10:39,000
it's Shakespeare's last play,

192
0:10:39.138,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and it really lends itself, as you can see, to cinema.

193
0:10:42.818,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But I'm just going to give you a little example about

194
0:10:45.366,000 --> 0:10:46,000
how one stages it in theater

195
0:10:47.271,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and then how one takes that same idea or story

196
0:10:51.332,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and moves it into cinema.

197
0:10:54.324,000 --> 0:10:57,000
The ideograph that I talked to you about before,

198
0:10:57.42,000 --> 0:10:59,000
what is it for "The Tempest"?

199
0:10:59.531,000 --> 0:11:01,000
What, if I were to boil it down,

200
0:11:02.357,000 --> 0:11:04,000
would be the one image that I could

201
0:11:04.67,000 --> 0:11:06,000
hang my hat on for this?

202
0:11:06.917,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And it was the sand castle,

203
0:11:09.205,000 --> 0:11:12,000
the idea of nurture versus nature,

204
0:11:12.345,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that we build these civilizations --

205
0:11:14.8,000 --> 0:11:16,000
she speaks about it at the end, Helen Mirren's Prospera --

206
0:11:17.755,000 --> 0:11:22,000
we build them, but under nature, under the grand tempest,

207
0:11:23.228,000 --> 0:11:28,000
these cloud-capped towers, these gorgeous palaces will fade

208
0:11:28.723,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and there will -- leave not a rack behind.

209
0:11:32.946,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So in the theater, I started the play,

210
0:11:35.575,000 --> 0:11:38,000
it was a black sand rake, white cyc,

211
0:11:38.637,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and there was a little girl, Miranda, on the horizon,

212
0:11:41.562,000 --> 0:11:43,000
building a drip castle, a sand castle.

213
0:11:44.23,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And as she was there on the edge of that stage,

214
0:11:47.67,000 --> 0:11:5,000
two stagehands all in black

215
0:11:51.031,000 --> 0:11:55,000
with watering cans ran along the top

216
0:11:55.535,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and started to pour water on the sand castle,

217
0:12:00.162,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and the sand castle started to drip and sink,

218
0:12:02.932,000 --> 0:12:03,000
but before it did,

219
0:12:04.331,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the audience saw the black-clad stagehands.

220
0:12:08.571,000 --> 0:12:12,000
The medium was apparent. It was banal. We saw it.

221
0:12:13.158,000 --> 0:12:15,000
But as they started to pour the water,

222
0:12:16.141,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the light changed from showing you the black-clad stagehands

223
0:12:19.873,000 --> 0:12:22,000
to focusing, this rough magic that we do in theater,

224
0:12:23.187,000 --> 0:12:26,000
it focused right on the water itself.

225
0:12:26.74,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And all of a sudden, the audience's perspective changes.

226
0:12:30.962,000 --> 0:12:33,000
It becomes something magically large.

227
0:12:34.468,000 --> 0:12:36,000
It becomes the rainstorm.

228
0:12:37.1,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The masked actors, the puppeteers, they disappear,

229
0:12:40.744,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and the audience makes that leap into this world,

230
0:12:43.944,000 --> 0:12:47,000
into this imaginary world of "The Tempest" actually happening.

231
0:12:48.267,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Now the difference

232
0:12:49.696,000 --> 0:12:51,000
when I went and did it in the cinema,

233
0:12:52.299,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I started the actual movie

234
0:12:54.683,000 --> 0:12:59,000
with a close-up of a sand castle, a black sand castle,

235
0:12:59.965,000 --> 0:13:,000
and what cinema can do is,

236
0:13:01.803,000 --> 0:13:04,000
by using camera, perspective,

237
0:13:05.259,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and also long shots and close-ups,

238
0:13:08.001,000 --> 0:13:1,000
it started on a close-up of the sand castle,

239
0:13:10.32,000 --> 0:13:11,000
and as it pulled away,

240
0:13:12.203,000 --> 0:13:15,000
you saw that it was a miniature sitting in the palm

241
0:13:15.237,000 --> 0:13:16,000
of the girl's hands.

242
0:13:17.14,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And so I could play with the medium,

243
0:13:18.968,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and why I move from one medium to another

244
0:13:21.92,000 --> 0:13:22,000
is to be able to do this.

245
0:13:23.403,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Now I'm going to take you to "Spider-Man."

246
0:13:25.834,000 --> 0:13:28,000
(Music)

247
0:13:56.794,000 --> 0:13:58,000

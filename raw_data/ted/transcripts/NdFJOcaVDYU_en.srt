0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Hi. I'm going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back,

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
You can mimic what you can see.

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm.

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Soon, you'll be able to look inside your brain and program,

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there.

7
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm going to tell you about that technology.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
People have wanted to look inside the human mind,

9
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
the human brain, for thousands of years.

10
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Well, coming out of the research labs just now, for our generation, is the possibility to do that.

11
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
People envision this as being very difficult.

12
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
You had to take a spaceship, shrink it down, inject it into the bloodstream.

13
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It was terribly dangerous. (Laughter)

14
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries.

15
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But now, we have a real technology to do this.

16
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We're going to fly into my colleague Peter's brain.

17
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We're going to do it non-invasively using MRI.

18
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We don't have to inject anything. We don't need radiation.

19
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter's brain -- literally, fly into his body --

20
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but more importantly, we can look into his mind.

21
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
When Peter moves his arm, that yellow spot you see there

22
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
is the interface to the functioning of Peter's mind taking place.

23
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Now you've seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms,

24
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains.

25
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
What's new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis.

26
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
We've collapsed that through technology to milliseconds,

27
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he's inside the scanner.

28
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second.

29
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
If he can see this pattern in his own brain, he can learn how to control it.

30
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
There have been three ways to try to impact the brain:

31
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the therapist's couch, pills and the knife.

32
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have.

33
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We all know that as we form thoughts, they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains.

34
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Chronic pain is an example. If you burn yourself, you pull your hand away.

35
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But if you're still in pain in six months' or six years' time,

36
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
it's because these circuits are producing pain that's no longer helping you.

37
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
If we can look at the activation in the brain that's producing the pain,

38
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information,

39
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and then we can select the areas that produce the pain.

40
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep.

41
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain

42
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and select brain areas to do that same thing.

43
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
What you're seeing here is, we've selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient.

44
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This may shock you, but we're literally reading this person's brain in real time.

45
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
They're watching their own brain activation,

46
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and they're controlling the pathway that produces their pain.

47
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
They're learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates.

48
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
As they do it, in the upper left is a display

49
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that's yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled.

50
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
When they control their brain, they can control their pain.

51
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This is an investigational technology,

52
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
but, in clinical trials, we're seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients.

53
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
This is not "The Matrix." You can only do this to yourself. You take control.

54
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I've seen inside my brain. You will too, soon.

55
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
When you do, what do you want to control?

56
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself, all your experiences.

57
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
These are some of the areas we're working on today that I don't have time to go into in detail.

58
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
But I want to leave with you the big question.

59
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We are the first generation that's going to be able to enter into,

60
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
using this technology, the human mind and brain.

61
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Where will we take it?

1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It was an incredible surprise to me

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to find out that there was actually an organization that cared about both parts of my life.

3
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Because, basically,

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I work as a theoretical physicist.

5
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I develop and test models of the Big Bang,

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
using observational data.

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And I've been moonlighting for the last five years

8
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
helping with a project in Africa.

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And, I get a lot of flak for this at Cambridge.

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
People wonder, you know, "How do you have time to do this?" And so on.

11
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And so it was simply astonishing to me

12
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to find an organization that actually appreciated both those sides.

13
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So I thought I'd start off by just telling you a little bit about myself

14
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and why I lead this schizophrenic life.

15
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Well, I was born in South Africa and my parents were imprisoned

16
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
for resisting the racist regime.

17
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
When they were released, we left and we went as refugees to Kenya and Tanzania.

18
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Both were very young countries then,

19
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and full of hope for the future.

20
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We had an amazing childhood. We didn't have any money,

21
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but we were outdoors most of the time.

22
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
We had fantastic friends and we saw the wonders of the world,

23
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
like Kilimanjaro, Serengeti and the Olduvai Gorge.

24
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Well, then we moved to London for high school.

25
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And after that -- there's nothing much to say about that.

26
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It was rather dull. But I came back to Africa

27
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
at the age of 17, as a volunteer teacher

28
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to Lesotho, which is a tiny country,

29
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
surrounded at that time by apartheid South Africa.

30
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
Well, 80 percent of the men in Lesotho

31
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
worked in the mines over the border,

32
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in brutal conditions.

33
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Nevertheless, I -- as I'm sure -- as a rather irritating young, white man

34
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
coming into their village, I was welcomed with incredible hospitality and warmth.

35
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
But the kids were the best part.

36
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The kids were amazing: extremely eager and often very bright.

37
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And I'm just going to tell you one story,

38
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
which got through to me.

39
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I used to try to take the kids outside as often as possible,

40
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to try to connect the academic stuff with the real world.

41
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And they weren't used to that.

42
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
But I took them outside one day and I said,

43
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
"I want you to estimate the height of the building."

44
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And I expected them to put a ruler next to the wall,

45
0:02:49.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
size it up with a finger, and make an estimate of the height.

46
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But there was one little boy, very small for his age.

47
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
He was the son of one of the poorest families in the village.

48
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And he wasn't doing that. He was scribbling with chalk on the pavement.

49
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And so, I said -- I was annoyed -- I said, "What are you doing?

50
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I want you to estimate the height of the building."

51
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
He said, "OK. I measured the height of a brick.

52
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I counted the number of bricks and now I'm multiplying."

53
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Well -- (Laughter) -- I hadn't thought of that one.

54
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And many experiences like this happened to me.

55
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Another one is that I met a miner. He was home on his three-month leave from the mines.

56
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Sitting next to him one day, he said, "There's only one thing that I really loved at school.

57
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And you know what it was? Shakespeare." And he recited some to me.

58
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And these and many similar experiences convinced me

59
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that there are just tons of bright kids in Africa

60
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
-- inventive kids, intellectual kids --

61
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and starved of opportunity.

62
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And if Africa is going to get fixed, it's by them, not by us.

63
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Well, after -- (Applause) -- that's the truth.

64
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Well, after Lesotho, I traveled across Africa

65
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
before returning to England

66
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
-- so gray and depressing, in comparison.

67
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And I went to Cambridge. And there, I fell for theoretical physics.

68
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Well, I'm not going to explain this equation,

69
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
but theoretical physics is really an amazing subject.

70
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We can write down all the laws of physics we know in one line.

71
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And, admittedly, it's in a very shorthand notation.

72
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And it contains 18 free parameters,

73
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
OK, which we have to fit to the data.

74
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So it's not the final story,

75
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but it's an incredibly powerful summary of everything we know

76
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
about nature at the most basic level.

77
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And apart from a few very important loose ends, which you've heard about here --

78
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
like dark energy and dark matter --

79
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
this equation describes,

80
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
seems to describe everything about the universe and what's in it.

81
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But there's one big puzzle remaining,

82
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and this was most succinctly put to me by my primary school math teacher in

83
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Tanzania, who's a wonderful Scottish lady

84
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
who I still stay in touch with.

85
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And she's now in her 80s.

86
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And when I try to explain my work to her, she waved away all the details, and she said,

87
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"Neil, there's only one question that really matters.

88
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
What banged?" (Laughter)

89
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
"Everyone talks about the Big Bang. What banged?"

90
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And she's right. It's a question we've all been avoiding.

91
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The standard explanation is that the universe somehow sprang into existence,

92
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
full of a strange kind of energy

93
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
-- inflationary energy -- which blew it up.

94
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But the puzzle of why the universe emerged in that peculiar state

95
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
is completely unsolved.

96
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Now, I worked on that theory for a while, with Stephen Hawking and others.

97
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But then I began to explore another alternative.

98
0:06:25.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The alternative is that the Big Bang wasn't the beginning.

99
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Perhaps the universe existed before the bang,

100
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and the bang was just a violent event in a pre-existing universe.

101
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Well, this possibility is actually suggested

102
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
by the latest theories, the unified theories,

103
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
which try to explain all those 18 free parameters

104
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in a single framework, which will hopefully predict all of them.

105
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And I'll just share a cartoon of this idea here.

106
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's all I can convey. According to these theories,

107
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
there are extra dimensions of space, not just the three we're familiar with,

108
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but at every point in the room there are more dimensions.

109
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And in particular, there's one rather strange one,

110
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in the most elegant unified theories we have.

111
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The strange one looks likes this:

112
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that we live in a three-dimensional world.

113
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We live in one of these worlds, and I can only show it as a sheet,

114
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but it's really three-dimensional.

115
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And a tiny distance away, there's another sheet,

116
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
also three-dimensional, and they're separated by a gap.

117
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The gap is very tiny, and I've blown it up so you can see it.

118
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But it's really a tiny fraction of the size of an atomic nucleus.

119
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I won't go into the details of why we think the universe is like this,

120
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but it comes out of the math and trying to explain the physics that we know.

121
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Well, I got interested in this because it seemed to me that it was an obvious question.

122
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Which is, what happens if these two, three-dimensional worlds

123
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
should actually collide?

124
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And if they collide, it would look a lot like the Big Bang.

125
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
But it's slightly different than in the conventional picture.

126
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The conventional picture of the Big Bang is a point.

127
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Everything comes out of a point;

128
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
you have infinite density. And all the equations break down.

129
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
No hope of describing that.

130
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
In this picture, you'll notice,

131
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the bang is extended. It's not a point.

132
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The density of matter is finite, and we have a chance

133
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
of a consistent set of equations that can describe the whole process.

134
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So, to cut a long story short, we've explored this alternative.

135
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
We've shown that it can fit

136
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
all of the data that we have about the formation of galaxies,

137
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
the fluctuations in the microwave background.

138
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Furthermore, there's an experimental way

139
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
to tell this theory, apart from the inflationary explanation that I told you before.

140
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It involves gravitational waves.

141
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And in this scenario, not only was the Big Bang not the beginning,

142
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
as you can see from the picture,

143
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:54,000
it can happen over and over again.

144
0:08:54.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It may be that we live in an endless universe,

145
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
both in space and in time.

146
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And there've been bangs in the past, and there will be bangs in the future.

147
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And maybe we live in an endless universe.

148
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Well, making and testing models of the universe

149
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
is, for me, the best way I have of enjoying and appreciating the universe.

150
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
We need to make the best mathematical models we can,

151
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
the most consistent ones.

152
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And then we scrutinize them, logically and with data.

153
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And we try to convince ourselves --

154
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we really try to convince ourselves they're wrong.

155
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
That's progress: when we prove things wrong.

156
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And gradually, we hopefully move closer and closer to understanding the world.

157
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
As I pursued my career, something was always gnawing away inside me.

158
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
What about Africa?

159
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
What about those kids I'd left behind?

160
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Instead of developing, as we'd all hoped in the '60s,

161
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
things had gotten worse.

162
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Africa was gripped by poverty, disease and war.

163
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This is very graphically shown by the Worldmapper website and project.

164
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And so the idea is to represent each country

165
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
on a map, but scale the area according to some quantity.

166
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So here's just the standard area map of the world.

167
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
By the way, Africa is very large.

168
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And the next map now shows Africa's GDP in 1960,

169
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
around the time of independence for many African states.

170
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Now, this is 1990, and then 2002. And here's a projection for 2015.

171
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Big changes are happening in the world,

172
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
but they're not helping Africa.

173
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
What about Africa's population? The population isn't out of proportion to its area,

174
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
but Africa leads the world in deaths from often preventable causes:

175
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
malnutrition, simple infections and birth complications.

176
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Then there's HIV/AIDS. And then there are deaths from war.

177
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
OK, currently there are 45,000 people a month dying in the Congo,

178
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
as a consequence of the war

179
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
there over coltan and diamonds and other things.

180
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It's still going on.

181
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
What about Africa's capacity to do something about these problems?

182
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Well, here's the number of physicians in Africa.

183
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Here's the number of people in higher education.

184
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And here -- most shocking to me --

185
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
the number of scientific research papers coming out of Africa.

186
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It just doesn't exist scientifically.

187
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
And this was very eloquently argued at TED Africa:

188
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that all of the aid that's been given

189
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
has completely failed to put Africa onto its own two feet.

190
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Well, the transition to democracy in South Africa in 1994

191
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
was literally a dream come true for many of us.

192
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
My parents were both elected to the first parliament,

193
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
alongside Nelson and Winnie Mandela. They were the only other couple.

194
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And in 2001, I took a research leave to visit them.

195
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And while I was busy working -- I was working on these colliding worlds, in the day.

196
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
But I learned that there was a desperate shortage of skills,

197
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
especially mathematical skills, in industry, in government, in education.

198
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The ability to make and test models has become essential,

199
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
not only to every single area of science today,

200
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
but also to modern society itself.

201
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And if you don't have math, you're not going to enter the modern age.

202
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So I had an idea. And the idea was very simple.

203
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
The idea was to set up an African Institute for Mathematical Sciences, or AIMS.

204
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And let's recruit students from the whole of Africa,

205
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
bring them together with lecturers from all over the world,

206
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and we'll try to give them a fantastic education.

207
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Well, as a Cambridge professor, I had many contacts.

208
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
And to my astonishment, they backed me 100 percent.

209
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
They said, "Go and do it,

210
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and we'll come and lecture."

211
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And I knew it would be amazing fun to bring brilliant students

212
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
from these countries -- where they don't have any opportunities -- together

213
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
with the best lecturers in the world --

214
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
who I knew would come, because of the interest in Africa --

215
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and put them together and just let the sparks fly.

216
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So we bought a derelict hotel near Cape Town.

217
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It's an 80-room Art Deco hotel from the 1920s.

218
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
The area was kind of seedy, so we got an 80-room hotel for 100,000 dollars.

219
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
It's a beautiful building. We decided we would refurbish it

220
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and then put out the word:

221
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
we're going to start the best math institute in Africa

222
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
in this hotel.

223
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Well, the new South Africa is a very exciting country.

224
0:14:16.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And those of you who haven't been there, you should go.

225
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
It's very, very interesting what's happening.

226
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And we recruited wonderful staff,

227
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
highly motivated staff.

228
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
The other thing that's happened, which was good for us, is the Internet.

229
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Even though the Internet is very expensive all over Africa,

230
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
there are Internet cafes everywhere.

231
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And bright young Africans are desperate to join the global community,

232
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
to be successful -- and they're very ambitious.

233
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
They want to be the next Einstein.

234
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And so when word came out that AIMS was opening,

235
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
it spread very quickly via e-mail and our website.

236
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And we got lots of applicants.

237
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Well, we designed AIMS as a 24-hour learning environment,

238
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and it was fantastic to start a university from the beginning.

239
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
You have to rethink, what is the university for?

240
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And that's really exciting.

241
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So we designed it to have interactive teaching.

242
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
No droning on at the chalkboard.

243
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
We emphasize problem-solving, working in groups,

244
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
every student discovering and maximizing their own potential

245
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and not chasing grades.

246
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Everyone lives together in this hotel -- lecturers and students --

247
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
and it's not surprising at all to find an impromptu tutorial at 1 a.m.

248
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
The students don't usually leave the computer lab till 2 or 3 a.m.

249
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And then they're up again at eight in the morning.

250
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Lectures, problem-solving and so on. It's an extraordinary place.

251
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
We especially emphasize areas of great relevance to Africa's development,

252
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
because, in those areas, scientists working in Africa will have a competitive advantage.

253
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
They'll publish, be invited to conferences.

254
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
They'll do well. They'll have successful careers.

255
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And AIMS has done extremely well.

256
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
Here is a list of last year's graduates, graduated in June,

257
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and what they're currently doing -- 48 of them.

258
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And where they are is indicated over here.

259
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
And where they've gone. So these are all postgraduate students.

260
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And they've all gone on to master's and Ph.D. degrees in excellent places.

261
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Five students can be educated at AIMS

262
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
for the cost of educating one in the U.S. or Europe.

263
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
But more important, the pan-African student body

264
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
is a continual source of strength, pride and commitment to Africa.

265
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
We illustrate AIMS' progress by coloring in the countries of Africa.

266
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
So here you can see behind this list.

267
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
When a county is colored yellow, we've received an application;

268
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
orange, we've accepted an application; and green,

269
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
a student has graduated.

270
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So here is where we were after the first graduation in 2004.

271
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And we set ourselves a goal of turning the continent green.

272
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
So there's 2005, -6, -7, -8.

273
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
(Applause)

274
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
We're well on the way to achieving our initial goal.

275
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:37,000
We had some of the students filmed at home before they came to AIMS.

276
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
And I'll just show you one.

277
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
Tendai Mugwagwa: My name is Tendai Mugwagwa.

278
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:47,000
I have a Bachelor of Science with an education degree.

279
0:17:47.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
I will be attending AIMS.

280
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
My understanding of the course is that it covers quite a lot.

281
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:57,000
You know, from physics to medicine,

282
0:17:57.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
in particular, epidemiology and also mathematical modeling.

283
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Neil Turok: So Tendai came to AIMS and did very well.

284
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
And I'll let her take it from there.

285
0:18:16.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
TM: My name is Tendai Mugwagwa

286
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
and I was a student at AIMS in 2003 and 2004.

287
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
After leaving AIMS, I went on to do a master's in applied mathematics

288
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
at the University of Cape Town in South Africa.

289
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:32,000
After that, I came to the Netherlands

290
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
where I'm now doing a Ph.D. in theoretical immunology.

291
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Professor: Tendai is working very independently.

292
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:42,000
She communicates well with the immunologists at the hospital.

293
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
So all in all I have a very good Ph.D. student from South Africa.

294
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:49,000
So I'm happy she's here.

295
0:18:49.16,000 --> 0:18:53,000
NT: Another student in the first year of AIMS was Shehu.

296
0:18:53.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
And he's shown here with his favorite high school teacher.

297
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:04,000
And then entering university in northern Nigeria.

298
0:19:04.16,000 --> 0:19:09,000
And after AIMS, Shehu wanted to do high-energy physics,

299
0:19:09.16,000 --> 0:19:11,000
and he came to Cambridge.

300
0:19:11.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
He's about to finish his Ph.D.,

301
0:19:14.16,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and he was filmed recently with someone you all know.

302
0:19:18.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
Shehu: And from there we will be able to,

303
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:23,000
hopefully, make better predictions and then we compare it

304
0:19:23.16,000 --> 0:19:28,000
to the graph and also make some predictions.

305
0:19:28.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
Stephen Hawking: That is nice.

306
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:34,000
NT: Here are the current students at AIMS. There are 53 of them

307
0:19:34.16,000 --> 0:19:38,000
from 20 different countries, including 20 women.

308
0:19:38.16,000 --> 0:19:41,000
So now I'm going to get to my TED business.

309
0:19:41.16,000 --> 0:19:44,000
Well, we had a party. This is Africa --

310
0:19:44.16,000 --> 0:19:48,000
we have good parties in Africa. And last month, they threw a surprise party for me.

311
0:19:48.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
Here's somebody you've seen already.

312
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:20:14,000
(Applause)

313
0:20:14.16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
I want to point out a few other exceptional people in this picture.

314
0:20:18.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
So, we were having a party,

315
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:23,000
as you can see they're completely eclipsing me at this point.

316
0:20:23.16,000 --> 0:20:26,000
This is Ezra. She's from Darfur.

317
0:20:26.16,000 --> 0:20:3,000
She's a physicist, and somehow stays smiling,

318
0:20:30.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
in spite of everything going on back home.

319
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:36,000
But she wants to continue in physics, and she's doing extremely well.

320
0:20:36.16,000 --> 0:20:4,000
This is Lydia. Lydia is the first ever woman

321
0:20:40.16,000 --> 0:20:43,000
to graduate in mathematics in the Central African Republic.

322
0:20:43.16,000 --> 0:20:48,000
And she's now at AIMS. (Applause)

323
0:20:49.16,000 --> 0:20:53,000
So now let me get to our TED wish.

324
0:20:53.16,000 --> 0:20:58,000
Well, it's not my TED wish; it's our wish, as you've already gathered.

325
0:20:58.16,000 --> 0:21:01,000
And our wish has two parts:

326
0:21:01.16,000 --> 0:21:06,000
one is a dream and the other's a plan. OK.

327
0:21:06.16,000 --> 0:21:22,000
Our TED dream is that the next Einstein will be African. (Applause)

328
0:21:25.16,000 --> 0:21:26,000
In striving for the heights of creative genius,

329
0:21:26.16,000 --> 0:21:31,000
we want to give thousands of people the motivation,

330
0:21:31.16,000 --> 0:21:33,000
the encouragement and the courage

331
0:21:33.16,000 --> 0:21:38,000
to obtain the high-level skills they need to help Africa.

332
0:21:38.16,000 --> 0:21:41,000
Among them will be not only brilliant scientists --

333
0:21:41.16,000 --> 0:21:44,000
I'm sure of that from what we've seen at AIMS --

334
0:21:44.16,000 --> 0:21:5,000
they'll also be the African Gates, Brins and Pages of the future.

335
0:21:50.16,000 --> 0:21:54,000
Well, I said we also have a plan. And our plan is quite simple.

336
0:21:54.16,000 --> 0:21:56,000
AIMS is now a proven model.

337
0:21:56.16,000 --> 0:22:,000
And what we need to do is to replicate it.

338
0:22:00.16,000 --> 0:22:04,000
We want to roll out 15 AIMS centers in the next five years, all over Africa.

339
0:22:04.16,000 --> 0:22:09,000
Each will have a pan-African student body,

340
0:22:09.16,000 --> 0:22:11,000
but specialize in a different area of science.

341
0:22:11.16,000 --> 0:22:16,000
We want to use science to overcome the national and cultural barriers,

342
0:22:16.16,000 --> 0:22:17,000
as it does at AIMS.

343
0:22:17.16,000 --> 0:22:19,000
And we want to add elements to the curriculum.

344
0:22:19.16,000 --> 0:22:24,000
We want to add entrepreneurship and policy skills.

345
0:22:24.16,000 --> 0:22:27,000
The expanded AIMS will be a coherent pan-African institution,

346
0:22:27.16,000 --> 0:22:31,000
and its graduates will form a powerful network,

347
0:22:31.16,000 --> 0:22:37,000
working together for peace and progress across the continent.

348
0:22:37.16,000 --> 0:22:39,000
Over the last year,

349
0:22:39.16,000 --> 0:22:41,000
we've been visiting sites in Africa,

350
0:22:41.16,000 --> 0:22:44,000
looking at potential sites for new AIMS centers.

351
0:22:44.16,000 --> 0:22:46,000
And here are the ones we've selected.

352
0:22:46.16,000 --> 0:22:5,000
And each of these centers has a strong local team,

353
0:22:50.16,000 --> 0:22:52,000
each is in a beautiful place, an interesting place,

354
0:22:52.16,000 --> 0:22:55,000
which international lecturers will be happy to visit.

355
0:22:55.16,000 --> 0:23:,000
And our partners across Africa are extremely enthusiastic about this.

356
0:23:00.16,000 --> 0:23:04,000
Everyone wants an AIMS center in their country.

357
0:23:04.16,000 --> 0:23:06,000
And last November,

358
0:23:06.16,000 --> 0:23:1,000
the conference of all the African ministers of science and technology,

359
0:23:10.16,000 --> 0:23:15,000
held in Mombasa, called for a comprehensive plan to roll out AIMS.

360
0:23:15.16,000 --> 0:23:18,000
So we have political support right across the continent.

361
0:23:18.16,000 --> 0:23:21,000
It won't be easy.

362
0:23:21.16,000 --> 0:23:23,000
At every site there will be huge challenges.

363
0:23:23.16,000 --> 0:23:26,000
Local scientists must play leading roles

364
0:23:26.16,000 --> 0:23:3,000
and governments must be persuaded to buy in.

365
0:23:30.16,000 --> 0:23:32,000
Conditions are very difficult,

366
0:23:32.16,000 --> 0:23:39,000
but we cannot afford to compromise on those principles which made AIMS work.

367
0:23:39.16,000 --> 0:23:41,000
And we summarize them this way:

368
0:23:41.16,000 --> 0:23:44,000
the institutes have got to be relevant, innovative,

369
0:23:44.16,000 --> 0:23:46,000
cost-effective and high quality. Why?

370
0:23:46.16,000 --> 0:23:49,000
Because we want Africa to be rich.

371
0:23:49.16,000 --> 0:23:56,000
Easy to remember the basic rules we need.

372
0:23:56.16,000 --> 0:23:59,000
So, just in ending, let me say the only people who can fix Africa

373
0:23:59.16,000 --> 0:24:02,000
are talented young Africans.

374
0:24:02.16,000 --> 0:24:05,000
By unlocking and nurturing their creative potential,

375
0:24:05.16,000 --> 0:24:09,000
we can create a step change in Africa's future.

376
0:24:09.16,000 --> 0:24:13,000
Over time, they will contribute to African development

377
0:24:13.16,000 --> 0:24:16,000
and to science in ways we can only imagine.

378
0:24:16.16,000 --> 0:24:18,000
Thank you.

379
0:24:18.16,000 --> 0:24:39,000
(Applause)

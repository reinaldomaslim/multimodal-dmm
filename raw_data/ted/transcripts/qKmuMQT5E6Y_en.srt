1
0:00:16.42,000 --> 0:00:19,000
There's a beautiful statement on the screen that says,

2
0:00:19.94,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"Light creates ambiance, light makes the feel of a space,

3
0:00:25.34,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and light is also the expression of structure."

4
0:00:28.42,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Well, that was not by me.

5
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
That was, of course, by Le Corbusier, the famous architect.

6
0:00:34.62,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And here you can see what he meant in one of his beautiful buildings --

7
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the chapel Notre Dame Du Haut De Ronchamp --

8
0:00:43.46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
where he creates this light that he could only make because there's also dark.

9
0:00:49.02,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I think that is the quintessence of this 18-minute talk --

10
0:00:54.94,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that there is no good lighting that is healthy and for our well-being

11
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
without proper darkness.

12
0:01:04.5,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So this is how we normally would light our offices.

13
0:01:07.9,000 --> 0:01:11,000
We have codes and standards that tell us that the lights should be so much Lux

14
0:01:12.82,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and of great uniformity.

15
0:01:15.1,000 --> 0:01:2,000
This is how we create uniform lighting from one wall to the other

16
0:01:20.139,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in a regular grid of lamps.

17
0:01:22.94,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And that is quite different from what I just showed you

18
0:01:26.22,000 --> 0:01:27,000
from Le Corbusier.

19
0:01:28.94,000 --> 0:01:3,000
If we would apply these codes and standards

20
0:01:31.02,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to the Pantheon in Rome,

21
0:01:32.58,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it would never have looked like this,

22
0:01:34.46,000 --> 0:01:39,000
because this beautiful light feature that goes around there all by itself

23
0:01:40.18,000 --> 0:01:43,000
can only appear because there is also darkness in that same building.

24
0:01:44.1,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And the same is more or less what Santiago Calatrava said

25
0:01:48.82,000 --> 0:01:52,000
when he said, "Light: I make it in my buildings for comfort."

26
0:01:53.62,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And he didn't mean the comfort of a five-course dinner

27
0:01:56.82,000 --> 0:01:57,000
as opposed to a one-course meal,

28
0:01:58.78,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but he really meant the comfort

29
0:02:00.5,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of the quality of the building for the people.

30
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
He meant that you can see the sky and that you can experience the sun.

31
0:02:08.74,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And he created these gorgeous buildings where you can see the sky,

32
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and where you can experience the sun,

33
0:02:15.38,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that give us a better life in the built environment,

34
0:02:19.3,000 --> 0:02:25,000
just because of the relevance of light in its brightness and also in its shadows.

35
0:02:25.34,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And what it all boils down to is, of course, the sun.

36
0:02:29.3,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And this image of the Sun may suggest

37
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that the Sun is something evil and aggressive,

38
0:02:34.46,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but we should not forget

39
0:02:35.66,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that all energy on this planet actually comes from the Sun,

40
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and light is only a manifestation of that energy.

41
0:02:44.98,000 --> 0:02:47,000
The sun is for dynamics, for color changes.

42
0:02:48.42,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The sun is for beauty in our environment,

43
0:02:51.02,000 --> 0:02:54,000
like in this building -- the High Museum in Atlanta,

44
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
which has been created by Renzo Piano from Italy,

45
0:02:57.22,000 --> 0:03:01,000
together with Arup Lighting, a brilliant team of lighting designers,

46
0:03:01.82,000 --> 0:03:07,000
who created a very subtle modulation of light across the space,

47
0:03:08.3,000 --> 0:03:1,000
responding to what the sun does outside,

48
0:03:10.642,000 --> 0:03:12,000
just because of all these beautiful openings in the roof.

49
0:03:13.66,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So in an indirect way, you can see the sun.

50
0:03:17.86,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And what they did is they created an integral building element

51
0:03:21.34,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to improve the quality of the space that surrounds the visitors of the museum.

52
0:03:27.14,000 --> 0:03:3,000
They created this shade that you can see here,

53
0:03:30.42,000 --> 0:03:33,000
which actually covers the sun,

54
0:03:34.1,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but opens up to the good light from the sky.

55
0:03:37.14,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And here you can see how they really crafted a beautiful design process

56
0:03:41.1,000 --> 0:03:42,000
with physical models,

57
0:03:42.34,000 --> 0:03:45,000
with quantitative as well as qualitative methods,

58
0:03:45.62,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to come to a final solution that is truly integrated

59
0:03:49.86,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and completely holistic with the architecture.

60
0:03:52.42,000 --> 0:03:54,000
They allowed themselves a few mistakes along the way.

61
0:03:54.94,000 --> 0:03:56,000
As you can see here, there's some direct light on the floor,

62
0:03:57.82,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but they could easily figure out where that comes from.

63
0:04:00.46,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And they allow people in that building to really enjoy the sun,

64
0:04:06.06,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the good part of the sun.

65
0:04:08.18,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And enjoying the sun can be in many different ways, of course.

66
0:04:12.62,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It can be just like this,

67
0:04:14.46,000 --> 0:04:17,000
or maybe like this, which is rather peculiar,

68
0:04:17.904,000 --> 0:04:19,000
but this is in 1963 --

69
0:04:20.02,000 --> 0:04:24,000
the viewing of a sun eclipse in the United States.

70
0:04:24.06,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And it's just a bit bright up there,

71
0:04:26.34,000 --> 0:04:29,000
so these people have found a very intriguing solution.

72
0:04:30.18,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This is, I think, a very illustrative image of what I try to say --

73
0:04:33.38,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that the beautiful dynamics of sun, bringing these into the building,

74
0:04:38.3,000 --> 0:04:42,000
creates a quality of our built environment that truly enhances our lives.

75
0:04:42.86,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And this is all about darkness

76
0:04:45.18,000 --> 0:04:47,000
as much as it is about lightness, of course,

77
0:04:47.3,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because otherwise you don't see these dynamics.

78
0:04:49.94,000 --> 0:04:5,000
As opposed to the first office

79
0:04:51.42,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that I showed you in the beginning of the talk,

80
0:04:54.5,000 --> 0:04:57,000
this is a well-known office, which is the Weidt Group.

81
0:04:57.58,000 --> 0:05:,000
They are in green energy consulting, or something like that.

82
0:05:00.66,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And they really practice what they preach

83
0:05:02.637,000 --> 0:05:04,000
because this office doesn't have any electric lighting at all.

84
0:05:05.58,000 --> 0:05:09,000
It has only, on one side, this big, big glass window

85
0:05:09.86,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that helps to let the sunlight enter deep into the space

86
0:05:13.46,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and create a beautiful quality there and a great dynamic range.

87
0:05:16.9,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So it can be very dim over there, and you do your work,

88
0:05:19.54,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and it can be very bright over there, and you do your work.

89
0:05:22.34,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But actually, the human eye turns out to be remarkably adaptable

90
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
to all these different light conditions that together create an environment

91
0:05:30.18,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that is never boring and that is never dull,

92
0:05:32.62,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and therefore helps us to enhance our lives.

93
0:05:36.66,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I really owe a short introduction of this man to you.

94
0:05:39.98,000 --> 0:05:42,000
This is Richard Kelly who was born 100 years ago,

95
0:05:43.94,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which is the reason I bring him up now, because it's kind of an anniversary year.

96
0:05:47.78,000 --> 0:05:52,000
In the 1930s, Richard Kelly was the first person to really describe

97
0:05:52.9,000 --> 0:05:53,000
a methodology of modern lighting design.

98
0:05:54.86,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And he coined three terms,

99
0:05:56.7,000 --> 0:05:59,000
which are "focal glow," "ambient luminescence"

100
0:06:00.62,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and "play of the brilliants" --

101
0:06:02.3,000 --> 0:06:06,000
three very distinctly different ideas about light in architecture

102
0:06:06.82,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that all together make up this beautiful experience.

103
0:06:10.82,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So to begin with, focal glow.

104
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
He meant something like this --

105
0:06:13.86,000 --> 0:06:15,000
where the light gives direction to the space

106
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and helps you to get around.

107
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Or something like this,

108
0:06:19.5,000 --> 0:06:21,000
which is the lighting design he did for General Motors,

109
0:06:22.14,000 --> 0:06:23,000
for the car showroom.

110
0:06:23.38,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And you enter that space,

111
0:06:24.62,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and you feel like, "Wow! This is so impressive,"

112
0:06:27.94,000 --> 0:06:31,000
just because of this focal point, this huge light source in the middle.

113
0:06:32.02,000 --> 0:06:33,000
To me, it is something from theater,

114
0:06:33.759,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and I will get back to that a little bit later.

115
0:06:35.98,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's the spotlight on the artist that helps you to focus.

116
0:06:39.66,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It could also be the sunlight that breaks through the clouds

117
0:06:42.5,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and lights up a patch of the land,

118
0:06:45.94,000 --> 0:06:48,000
highlighting it compared to the dim environment.

119
0:06:50.38,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Or it can be in today's retail, in the shopping environment --

120
0:06:54.18,000 --> 0:06:58,000
lighting the merchandise and creating accents that help you to get around.

121
0:06:58.22,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Ambient luminescence is something very different.

122
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Richard Kelly saw it as something infinite,

123
0:07:04.38,000 --> 0:07:06,000
something without any focus,

124
0:07:06.7,000 --> 0:07:1,000
something where all details actually dissolve in infinity.

125
0:07:11.54,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And I see it as a very comfortable kind of light that really helps us to relax

126
0:07:17.46,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and to contemplate.

127
0:07:18.9,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It could also be something like this:

128
0:07:20.74,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the National Museum of Science in London,

129
0:07:22.86,000 --> 0:07:27,000
where this blue is embracing all the exhibitions and galleries

130
0:07:27.98,000 --> 0:07:29,000
in one large gesture.

131
0:07:30.5,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And then finally,

132
0:07:31.74,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Kelly's play of brilliants added to that

133
0:07:34.22,000 --> 0:07:37,000
really some play, I think, of the skyline of Hong Kong,

134
0:07:37.58,000 --> 0:07:39,000
or perhaps the chandelier in the opera house,

135
0:07:39.94,000 --> 0:07:4,000
or in the theater here,

136
0:07:41.58,000 --> 0:07:45,000
which is the decoration, the icing on the cake, something playful,

137
0:07:45.78,000 --> 0:07:48,000
something that is just an addition to the architectural environment,

138
0:07:49.34,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I would say.

139
0:07:50.58,000 --> 0:07:52,000
These three distinct elements, together,

140
0:07:53.18,000 --> 0:07:56,000
make a lighting environment that helps us to feel better.

141
0:07:56.94,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And we can only create these out of darkness.

142
0:07:59.1,000 --> 0:08:,000
And I will explain that further.

143
0:08:00.7,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And I guess that is something that Richard Kelly, here on the left,

144
0:08:03.9,000 --> 0:08:05,000
was explaining to Ludwig Mies van Der Rohe.

145
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And behind them, you see that Seagram Building

146
0:08:09.02,000 --> 0:08:13,000
that later turned into an icon of modern lighting design.

147
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Those times, there were some early attempts

148
0:08:17.069,000 --> 0:08:18,000
also for light therapy already.

149
0:08:18.58,000 --> 0:08:19,000
You can see here a photo

150
0:08:19.78,000 --> 0:08:21,000
from the United States Library of Medicine,

151
0:08:21.94,000 --> 0:08:24,000
where people are put in the sun to get better.

152
0:08:25.06,000 --> 0:08:28,000
It's a little bit of a different story, this health aspect of light,

153
0:08:28.275,000 --> 0:08:29,000
than what I'm telling you today.

154
0:08:30.62,000 --> 0:08:32,000
In today's modern medicine,

155
0:08:33.02,000 --> 0:08:38,000
there is a real understanding of light in an almost biochemical way.

156
0:08:38.54,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And there is the idea that, when we look at things,

157
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it is the yellow light that helps us the most,

158
0:08:45.46,000 --> 0:08:46,000
that we are the most sensitive for.

159
0:08:47.46,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But our circadian rhythms,

160
0:08:50.1,000 --> 0:08:52,000
which are the rhythms that help us to wake and sleep

161
0:08:52.58,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and be alert and relaxed and so forth and so on,

162
0:08:54.98,000 --> 0:08:56,000
they are much more triggered by blue light.

163
0:08:57.74,000 --> 0:09:,000
And by modulating the amount of blue in our environment,

164
0:09:01.66,000 --> 0:09:04,000
we can help people to relax, or to be alert,

165
0:09:05.06,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to fall asleep, or to stay awake.

166
0:09:07.38,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And that is how, maybe in the near future, light can help hospitals

167
0:09:13.42,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to make people better sooner, recover them quicker.

168
0:09:18.86,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Maybe in the airplane, we can overcome jet lag like that.

169
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Perhaps in school, we can help children to learn better

170
0:09:26.066,000 --> 0:09:28,000
because they concentrate more on their work.

171
0:09:28.138,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And you can imagine a lot more applications.

172
0:09:30.66,000 --> 0:09:31,000
But I would like to talk further

173
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
about the combination of light and darkness

174
0:09:38.06,000 --> 0:09:39,000
as a quality in our life.

175
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So light is, of course, for social interaction also --

176
0:09:45.18,000 --> 0:09:48,000
to create relationships with all the features around us.

177
0:09:48.86,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It is the place where we gather around

178
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
when we have to say something to each other.

179
0:09:53.54,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And it is all about this planet.

180
0:09:55.74,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But when you look at this planet at night,

181
0:09:58.02,000 --> 0:09:59,000
it looks like this.

182
0:09:59.38,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And I think this is the most shocking image in my talk today.

183
0:10:02.94,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Because all this light here goes up to the sky.

184
0:10:06.58,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It never reaches the ground where it was meant for.

185
0:10:10.5,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It never is to the benefit of people.

186
0:10:12.66,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It only spoils the darkness.

187
0:10:14.5,000 --> 0:10:17,000
So at a global scale, it looks like this.

188
0:10:17.74,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And, I mean, that is quite amazing, what you see here --

189
0:10:20.5,000 --> 0:10:25,000
how much light goes up into the sky and never reaches the ground.

190
0:10:25.86,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Because if we look at the Earth the way it should be,

191
0:10:28.62,000 --> 0:10:31,000
it would be something like this very inspiring image

192
0:10:31.66,000 --> 0:10:35,000
where darkness is for our imagination and for contemplation

193
0:10:35.98,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and to help us to relate to everything.

194
0:10:39.54,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The world is changing though,

195
0:10:40.98,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and urbanization is a big driver of everything.

196
0:10:43.22,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I took this photo two weeks ago in Guangzhou,

197
0:10:45.662,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and I realized that 10 years ago,

198
0:10:47.341,000 --> 0:10:5,000
there was nothing like this, of these buildings.

199
0:10:51.98,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It was just a much smaller city,

200
0:10:54.1,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and the pace of urbanization is incredible and enormous.

201
0:10:57.58,000 --> 0:11:,000
And we have to understand these main questions:

202
0:11:00.62,000 --> 0:11:03,000
How do people move through these new urban spaces?

203
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
How do they share their culture?

204
0:11:05.86,000 --> 0:11:06,000
How do we tackle things like mobility?

205
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And how can light help there?

206
0:11:10.18,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Because the new technologies,

207
0:11:11.66,000 --> 0:11:13,000
they seem to be in a really interesting position

208
0:11:14.14,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to contribute to the solutions of urbanization

209
0:11:18.02,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and to provide us with better environments.

210
0:11:21.38,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It's not that long ago

211
0:11:22.78,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that our lighting was just done with these kinds of lamps.

212
0:11:26.54,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And of course, we had the metal-halide lamps

213
0:11:28.66,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and fluorescent lamps and things like that.

214
0:11:30.78,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Now we have LED,

215
0:11:32.3,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but here you see the latest one, and you see how incredibly small it is.

216
0:11:36.38,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And this is exactly what offers us a unique opportunity,

217
0:11:40.02,000 --> 0:11:43,000
because this tiny, tiny size allows us

218
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to put the light wherever we really need it.

219
0:11:45.62,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And we can actually leave it out where it's not needed at all

220
0:11:48.54,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and where we can preserve darkness.

221
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So that is a really interesting proposition, I think,

222
0:11:52.78,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and a new way of lighting the architectural environment

223
0:11:56.38,000 --> 0:11:57,000
with our well-being in mind.

224
0:11:58.86,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The problem is, though, that I wanted to explain to you how this really works --

225
0:12:02.66,000 --> 0:12:04,000
but I can have four of these on my finger,

226
0:12:05.1,000 --> 0:12:07,000
so you would not be able to really see them.

227
0:12:07.22,000 --> 0:12:1,000
So I asked our laboratory to do something about it,

228
0:12:10.3,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and they said, "Well, we can do something."

229
0:12:12.34,000 --> 0:12:14,000
They created for me the biggest LED in the world

230
0:12:14.9,000 --> 0:12:16,000
especially for TEDx in Amsterdam.

231
0:12:16.94,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So here it is.

232
0:12:18.3,000 --> 0:12:2,000
It's the same thing as you can see over there --

233
0:12:20.74,000 --> 0:12:21,000
just 200 times bigger.

234
0:12:22.38,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And I will very quickly show you how it works.

235
0:12:24.74,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So just to explain.

236
0:12:27.62,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Now, every LED that is made these days gives blue light.

237
0:12:34.82,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Now, this is not very pleasant and comfortable.

238
0:12:38.06,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And for that reason, we cover the LED with a phosphor cap.

239
0:12:44.98,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And the phosphor is excited by the blue

240
0:12:47.7,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and makes the light white and warm and pleasant.

241
0:12:50.82,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And then when you add the lens to that,

242
0:12:53.18,000 --> 0:12:56,000
you can bundle the light and send it wherever you need it

243
0:12:56.9,000 --> 0:12:59,000
without any need to spill any light to the sky or anywhere else.

244
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
So you can preserve the darkness and make the light.

245
0:13:03.58,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I just wanted to show that to you so you understand how this works.

246
0:13:08.7,000 --> 0:13:09,000
(Applause)

247
0:13:09.74,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Thank you.

248
0:13:10.952,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Applause)

249
0:13:12.04,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We can go further.

250
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So we have to rethink the way we light our cities.

251
0:13:16.5,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We have to think again about light as a default solution.

252
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Why are all these motorways permanently lit?

253
0:13:23.7,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Is it really needed?

254
0:13:24.94,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Can we maybe be much more selective

255
0:13:26.66,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and create better environments that also benefit from darkness?

256
0:13:30.02,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Can we be much more gentle with light?

257
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Like here -- this is a very low light level actually.

258
0:13:35.1,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Can we engage people more in the lighting projects that we create,

259
0:13:38.74,000 --> 0:13:4,000
so they really want to connect with it, like here?

260
0:13:41.34,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Or can we create simply sculptures

261
0:13:43.224,000 --> 0:13:45,000
that are very inspiring to be in and to be around?

262
0:13:45.86,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And can we preserve the darkness?

263
0:13:47.86,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Because to find a place like this today on Earth

264
0:13:50.123,000 --> 0:13:52,000
is really very, very challenging.

265
0:13:53.7,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And to find a starry sky like this is even more difficult.

266
0:13:57.02,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Even in the oceans, we are creating a lot of light

267
0:14:00.02,000 --> 0:14:01,000
that we could actually ban

268
0:14:01.5,000 --> 0:14:04,000
also for animal life to have a much greater well-being.

269
0:14:05.18,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And it's known that migrating birds, for example, get very disoriented

270
0:14:08.5,000 --> 0:14:1,000
because of these offshore platforms.

271
0:14:10.58,000 --> 0:14:12,000
And we discovered that when we make those lights green,

272
0:14:13.38,000 --> 0:14:15,000
the birds, they actually go the right way.

273
0:14:15.42,000 --> 0:14:17,000
They are not disturbed anymore.

274
0:14:17.46,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And it turns out once again

275
0:14:19.302,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that spectral sensitivity is very important here.

276
0:14:24.18,000 --> 0:14:26,000
In all of these examples, I think,

277
0:14:26.66,000 --> 0:14:28,000
we should start making the light out of darkness,

278
0:14:29.58,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and use the darkness as a canvas -- like the visual artists do,

279
0:14:33.5,000 --> 0:14:35,000
like Edward Hopper in this painting.

280
0:14:35.78,000 --> 0:14:37,000
I think that there is a lot of suspense in this painting.

281
0:14:38.5,000 --> 0:14:42,000
I think, when I see it, I start to think, who are those people?

282
0:14:42.74,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Where have they come from? Where are they going?

283
0:14:45.02,000 --> 0:14:46,000
What just happened?

284
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
What will be happening in the next five minutes?

285
0:14:48.54,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And it only embodies all these stories and all this suspense

286
0:14:51.42,000 --> 0:14:52,000
because of the darkness and the light.

287
0:14:53.3,000 --> 0:14:54,000
Edward Hopper was a real master

288
0:14:55.1,000 --> 0:14:58,000
in creating the narration by working with light and dark.

289
0:14:58.74,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And we can learn from that

290
0:15:00.06,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and create more interesting and inspiring architectural environments.

291
0:15:03.86,000 --> 0:15:05,000
We can do that in commercial spaces like this.

292
0:15:06.34,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And you can still also go outside

293
0:15:09.22,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and enjoy the greatest show in the universe,

294
0:15:14.06,000 --> 0:15:16,000
which is, of course, the universe itself.

295
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
So I give you this wonderful, informative image of the sky,

296
0:15:23.7,000 --> 0:15:24,000
ranging from the inner city,

297
0:15:25.38,000 --> 0:15:28,000
where you may see one or two stars and nothing else,

298
0:15:29.1,000 --> 0:15:31,000
all the way to the rural environments,

299
0:15:31.46,000 --> 0:15:35,000
where you can enjoy this great and gorgeous and beautiful performance

300
0:15:35.74,000 --> 0:15:37,000
of the constellations and the stars.

301
0:15:38.14,000 --> 0:15:4,000
In architecture, it works just the same.

302
0:15:40.9,000 --> 0:15:43,000
By appreciating the darkness when you design the light,

303
0:15:44.3,000 --> 0:15:46,000
you create much more interesting environments

304
0:15:46.9,000 --> 0:15:48,000
that truly enhance our lives.

305
0:15:49.82,000 --> 0:15:53,000
This is the most well-known example, Tadao Ando's Church of the Light.

306
0:15:53.86,000 --> 0:15:58,000
But I also think of Peter Zumthor's spa in Vals,

307
0:15:59.5,000 --> 0:16:01,000
where light and dark, in very gentle combinations,

308
0:16:02.34,000 --> 0:16:04,000
alter each other to define the space.

309
0:16:04.9,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Or Richard MacCormac's Southwark tube station in London,

310
0:16:08.22,000 --> 0:16:11,000
where you can really see the sky, even though you are under the ground.

311
0:16:12.42,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And finally, I want to point out

312
0:16:14.14,000 --> 0:16:16,000
that a lot of this inspiration comes from theater.

313
0:16:16.66,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And I think it's fantastic that we are today experiencing TEDx

314
0:16:20.82,000 --> 0:16:22,000
in a theater for the first time

315
0:16:23.34,000 --> 0:16:27,000
because I think we really owe to the theater a big thanks.

316
0:16:27.74,000 --> 0:16:29,000
It wouldn't be such an inspiring scenography

317
0:16:30.02,000 --> 0:16:31,000
without this theater.

318
0:16:31.82,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And I think the theater is a place where we truly enhance life with light.

319
0:16:38.06,000 --> 0:16:39,000
Thank you very much.

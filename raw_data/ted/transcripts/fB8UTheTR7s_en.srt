0:00:14.583,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Music)

2
0:01:57.512,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Applause)

3
0:02:01.288,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Music)

4
0:02:20.886,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Music ends)

5
0:02:22.061,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Applause)

6
0:02:31.124,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Robbie Mizzone: Thank you.

7
0:02:33.619,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Tommy Mizzone: Thank you very much.

8
0:02:35.346,000 --> 0:02:37,000
We're so excited to be here. It's such an honor.

9
0:02:37.696,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Like he said, we're three brothers from New Jersey --

10
0:02:40.283,000 --> 0:02:42,000
you know, the bluegrass capital of the world.

11
0:02:42.959,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Laughter)

12
0:02:45.182,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We discovered bluegrass a few years ago,

13
0:02:47.943,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and we fell in love with it.

14
0:02:49.356,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We hope you guys will too.

15
0:02:50.723,000 --> 0:02:54,000
This next song is an original we wrote called "Time Lapse,"

16
0:02:54.762,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and it will probably live up to its name.

17
0:02:56.826,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Tuning)

18
0:03:05.528,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Music)

19
0:04:47.768,000 --> 0:04:48,000
(Music ends)

20
0:04:49.639,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Applause)

21
0:05:01.313,000 --> 0:05:02,000
TM: Thank you very much.

22
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
RM: I'm just going to take a second to introduce the band.

23
0:05:07.116,000 --> 0:05:09,000
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy.

24
0:05:09.404,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Applause)

25
0:05:15.009,000 --> 0:05:16,000
On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny.

26
0:05:17.271,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Applause)

27
0:05:21.066,000 --> 0:05:22,000
He's also our brother.

28
0:05:23.347,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And I'm Robbie, and I'm 14, and I play the fiddle.

29
0:05:25.836,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Applause)

30
0:05:31.185,000 --> 0:05:33,000
As you can see, we decided to make it hard on ourselves,

31
0:05:33.871,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and we chose to play three songs

32
0:05:35.42,000 --> 0:05:36,000
in three different keys.

33
0:05:36.688,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Tuning)

34
0:05:39.061,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Yeah. I'm also going to explain, a lot of people want to know

35
0:05:41.99,000 --> 0:05:43,000
where we got the name "Sleepy Man Banjo Boys" from.

36
0:05:44.913,000 --> 0:05:46,000
So, it started when Jonny was little,

37
0:05:47.205,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and he first started the banjo, he would play on his back

38
0:05:50.603,000 --> 0:05:51,000
with his eyes closed,

39
0:05:51.86,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and we'd say it looked like he was sleeping.

40
0:05:54.389,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So you can probably piece the rest together.

41
0:05:56.508,000 --> 0:05:58,000
TM: We can't really figure out the reason.

42
0:05:58.58,000 --> 0:06:,000
It might have been that it weighs about a million pounds.

43
0:06:02.378,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Music)

44
0:07:41.283,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Applause)

45
0:07:43.828,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Music)

46
0:08:24.055,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Music ends)

47
0:08:25.23,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Applause)

48
0:08:30.288,000 --> 0:08:31,000
TM: Thank you very much.

49
0:08:31.74,000 --> 0:08:32,000
(Cheering)

50
0:08:32.915,000 --> 0:08:33,000
RM: Thank you.

51
0:08:34.423,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Applause)

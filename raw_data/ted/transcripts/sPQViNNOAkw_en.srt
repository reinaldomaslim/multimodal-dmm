1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
How do groups get anything done? Right?

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
How do you organize a group of individuals

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
so that the output of the group

4
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
is something coherent and of lasting value,

5
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
instead of just being chaos?

6
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And the economic framing of that problem

7
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
is called coordination costs.

8
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And a coordination cost is essentially all of the financial

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
or institutional difficulties in arranging group output.

10
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And we've had a classic answer for coordination costs,

11
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
which is, if you want to coordinate the work of a group of people,

12
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
you start an institution, right? You raise some resources.

13
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
You found something. It can be private or public.

14
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It can be for profit or not profit. It can be large or small.

15
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But you get these resources together.

16
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
You found an institution, and you use the institution

17
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to coordinate the activities of the group.

18
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
More recently, because the cost of letting groups

19
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
communicate with each other has fallen through the floor --

20
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and communication costs are one of the big

21
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
inputs to coordination -- there has been a second answer,

22
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
which is to put the cooperation into the infrastructure,

23
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to design systems that coordinate the output

24
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
of the group as a by-product of the operating of the system,

25
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
without regard to institutional models.

26
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So, that's what I want to talk about today.

27
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I'm going to illustrate it with some fairly concrete examples,

28
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but always pointing to the broader themes.

29
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So, I'm going to start by trying to answer a question

30
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
that I know each of you will have asked yourself at some point or other,

31
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and which the Internet is purpose-built to answer,

32
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
which is, where can I get a picture of a roller-skating mermaid?

33
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So, in New York City, on the first Saturday of every summer,

34
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Coney Island, our local, charmingly run-down amusement park,

35
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:51,000
hosts the Mermaid Parade. It's an amateur parade;

36
0:01:51.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
people come from all over the city; people get all dressed up.

37
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Some people get less dressed up.

38
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Young and old, dancing in the streets.

39
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Colorful characters, and a good time is had by all.

40
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And what I want to call your attention to is not the Mermaid Parade itself,

41
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
charming though it is, but rather to these photos.

42
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I didn't take them. How did I get them?

43
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And the answer is: I got them from Flickr.

44
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Flickr is a photo-sharing service

45
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that allows people to take photos, upload them,

46
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
share them over the Web and so forth.

47
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Recently, Flickr has added an additional function called tagging.

48
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Tagging was pioneered by Delicious and Joshua Schachter.

49
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Delicious is a social bookmarking service.

50
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Tagging is a cooperative infrastructure answer to classification.

51
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Right? If I had given this talk last year,

52
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I couldn't do what I just did,

53
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because I couldn't have found those photos.

54
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But instead of saying,

55
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
we need to hire a professional class of librarians

56
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to organize these photos once they're uploaded,

57
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Flickr simply turned over to the users

58
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the ability to characterize the photos.

59
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So, I was able to go in and draw down photos that had been tagged

60
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"Mermaid Parade." There were 3,100 photos taken by 118 photographers,

61
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
all aggregated and then put under this nice, neat name,

62
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
shown in reverse chronological order.

63
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And I was then able to go and retrieve them

64
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to give you that little slideshow.

65
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Now, what hard problem is being solved here?

66
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And it's -- in the most schematic possible view,

67
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
it's a coordination problem, right?

68
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
There are a large number of people on the Internet,

69
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
a very small fraction of them have photos of the Mermaid Parade.

70
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
How do we get those people together to contribute that work?

71
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The classic answer is to form an institution, right?

72
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
To draw those people into some prearranged structure

73
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that has explicit goals.

74
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And I want to call your attention to

75
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
some of the side effects of going the institutional route.

76
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
First of all, when you form an institution,

77
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
you take on a management problem, right?

78
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
No good just hiring employees,

79
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
you also have to hire other employees to manage those employees

80
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and to enforce the goals of the institution and so forth.

81
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Secondly, you have to bring structure into place.

82
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Right? You have to have economic structure.

83
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
You have to have legal structure.

84
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
You have to have physical structure.

85
0:04:01.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And that creates additional costs.

86
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Third, forming an institution is inherently exclusionary.

87
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
You notice we haven't got everybody who has a photo.

88
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
You can't hire everyone in a company, right?

89
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You can't recruit everyone into a governmental organization.

90
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
You have to exclude some people.

91
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And fourth, as a result of that exclusion,

92
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
you end up with a professional class. Look at the change here.

93
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We've gone from people with photos to photographers.

94
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Right? We've created a professional class of photographers

95
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
whose goal is to go out and photograph the Mermaid Parade,

96
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
or whatever else they're sent out to photograph.

97
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
When you build cooperation into the infrastructure,

98
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
which is the Flickr answer,

99
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
you can leave the people where they are

100
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and you take the problem to the individuals, rather than

101
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
moving the individuals to the problem.

102
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
You arrange the coordination in the group, and by doing that

103
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
you get the same outcome, without the institutional difficulties.

104
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
You lose the institutional imperative.

105
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You lose the right to shape people's work when it's volunteer effort,

106
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
but you also shed the institutional cost,

107
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
which gives you greater flexibility.

108
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
What Flickr does is it replaces planning with coordination.

109
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And this is a general aspect of these cooperative systems.

110
0:05:22.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Right. You'll have experienced this in your life

111
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
whenever you bought your first mobile phone,

112
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and you stopped making plans.

113
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
You just said, "I'll call you when I get there."

114
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
"Call me when you get off work." Right?

115
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
That is a point-to-point replacement of coordination with planning.

116
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Right. We're now able to do that kind of thing with groups.

117
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
To say instead of, we must make an advance plan,

118
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
we must have a five-year projection

119
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
of where the Wikipedia is going to be, or whatever,

120
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
you can just say, let's coordinate the group effort,

121
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and let's deal with it as we go,

122
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
because we're now well-enough coordinated

123
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
that we don't have to take on the problems of deciding in advance what to do.

124
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So here's another example. This one's somewhat more somber.

125
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
These are photos on Flickr tagged "Iraq."

126
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And everything that was hard about the coordination cost

127
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
with the Mermaid Parade is even harder here.

128
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
There are more pictures. There are more photographers.

129
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
It's taken over a wider geographic area.

130
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
The photos are spread out over a longer period of time.

131
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And worst of all, that figure at the bottom,

132
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
approximately ten photos per photographer, is a lie.

133
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
It's mathematically true,

134
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but it doesn't really talk about anything important --

135
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
because in these systems, the average isn't really what matters.

136
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
What matters is this.

137
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
This is a graph of photographs tagged Iraq

138
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
as taken by the 529 photographers who contributed the 5,445 photos.

139
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And it's ranked in order of number of photos taken per photographer.

140
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
You can see here, over at the end,

141
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
our most prolific photographer has taken around 350 photos,

142
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and you can see there's a few people who have taken hundreds of photos.

143
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Then there's dozens of people who've taken dozens of photos.

144
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And by the time we get around here,

145
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
we get ten or fewer photos, and then there's this long, flat tail.

146
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And by the time you get to the middle,

147
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
you've got hundreds of people

148
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
who have contributed only one photo each.

149
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
This is called a power-law distribution.

150
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It appears often in unconstrained social systems

151
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
where people are allowed to contribute as much or as little as they like --

152
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
this is often what you get. Right?

153
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
The math behind the power-law distribution is that whatever's in the nth position

154
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is doing about one-nth of whatever's being measured,

155
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
relative to the person in the first position.

156
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So, we'd expect the tenth most prolific photographer

157
0:07:49.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to have contributed about a tenth of the photos,

158
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and the hundredth most prolific photographer

159
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
to have contributed only about a hundred as many photos

160
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
as the most prolific photographer did.

161
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So, the head of the curve can be sharper or flatter.

162
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
But that basic math accounts both for the steep slope

163
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and for the long, flat tail.

164
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And curiously, in these systems, as they grow larger,

165
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the systems don't converge; they diverge more.

166
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
In bigger systems, the head gets bigger

167
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and the tail gets longer, so the imbalance increases.

168
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
You can see the curve is obviously heavily left-weighted. Here's how heavily:

169
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
if you take the top 10 percent of photographers contributing to this system,

170
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
they account for three quarters of the photos taken --

171
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
just the top 10 percent most prolific photographers.

172
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
If you go down to five percent,

173
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
you're still accounting for 60 percent of the photos.

174
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
If you go down to one percent, exclude 99 percent of the group effort,

175
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
you're still accounting for almost a quarter of the photos.

176
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And because of this left weighting,

177
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
the average is actually here, way to the left.

178
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And that sounds strange to our ears,

179
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but what ends up happening is that 80 percent of the contributors

180
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
have contributed a below-average amount.

181
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
That sounds strange because we expect average and middle

182
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to be about the same, but they're not at all.

183
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
This is the math underlying the 80/20 rule. Right?

184
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Whenever you hear anybody talking about the 80/20 rule,

185
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
this is what's going on. Right?

186
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
20 percent of the merchandise accounts for 80 percent of the revenue,

187
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
20 percent of the users use 80 percent of the resources --

188
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
this is the shape people are talking about when that happens.

189
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Institutions only have two tools: carrots and sticks.

190
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And the 80 percent zone is a no-carrot and no-stick zone.

191
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The costs of running the institution mean that you cannot

192
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
take on the work of those people easily in an institutional frame.

193
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The institutional model always pushes leftwards,

194
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
treating these people as employees.

195
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The institutional response is,

196
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
I can get 75 percent of the value for 10 percent of the hires -- great,

197
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
that's what I'll do.

198
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
The cooperative infrastructure model says,

199
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
why do you want to give up a quarter of the value?

200
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
If your system is designed

201
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
so that you have to give up a quarter of the value,

202
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
re-engineer the system.

203
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Don't take on the cost that prevents you

204
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
from getting to the contributions of these people.

205
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Build the system so that anybody can contribute at any amount.

206
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So the coordination response asks not,

207
0:10:30.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
how are these people as employees, but rather,

208
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
what is their contribution like? Right?

209
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We have over here Psycho Milt, a Flickr user,

210
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:43,000
who has contributed one, and only one, photo titled "Iraq."

211
0:10:43.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And here's the photo. Right. Labeled, "Bad Day at Work."

212
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Right? So the question is,

213
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
do you want that photo? Yes or no.

214
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
The question is not, is Psycho Milt a good employee?

215
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And the tension here is between institution as enabler

216
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and institution as obstacle.

217
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
When you're dealing with the left-hand edge

218
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
of one of these distributions,

219
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
when you're dealing with the people who spend a lot of time

220
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
producing a lot of the material you want,

221
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that's an institution-as-enabler world.

222
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
You can hire those people as employees, you can coordinate their work

223
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and you can get some output.

224
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But when you're down here, where the Psycho Milts of the world

225
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:24,000
are adding one photo at a time,

226
0:11:24.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that's institution as obstacle.

227
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Institutions hate being told they're obstacles.

228
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
One of the first things that happens

229
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
when you institutionalize a problem

230
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
is that the first goal of the institution

231
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
immediately shifts from whatever the nominal goal was

232
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to self-preservation.

233
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And the actual goal of the institution goes to two through n.

234
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Right? So, when institutions are told they are obstacles,

235
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and that there are other ways of coordinating the value,

236
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
they go through something a little bit like the Kubler-Ross stages --

237
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
(Laughter)

238
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
-- of reaction, being told you have a fatal illness:

239
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
denial, anger, bargaining, acceptance.

240
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Most of the cooperative systems we've seen

241
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
haven't been around long enough

242
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to have gotten to the acceptance phase.

243
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Many, many institutions are still in denial,

244
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but we're seeing recently a lot of both anger and bargaining.

245
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
There's a wonderful, small example going on right now.

246
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
In France, a bus company is suing people for forming a carpool,

247
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
right, because the fact that they have coordinated

248
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
themselves to create cooperative value is depriving them of revenue.

249
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
You can follow this in the Guardian.

250
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It's actually quite entertaining.

251
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The bigger question is,

252
0:12:40.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
what do you do about the value down here?

253
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Right? How do you capture that?

254
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And institutions, as I've said, are prevented from capturing that.

255
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Steve Ballmer, now CEO of Microsoft,

256
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:54,000
was criticizing Linux a couple of years ago, and he said,

257
0:12:54.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
"Oh, this business of thousands of programmers

258
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
contributing to Linux, this is a myth.

259
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
We've looked at who's contributed to Linux,

260
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and most of the patches have been produced by programmers

261
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
who've only done one thing." Right?

262
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
You can hear this distribution under that complaint.

263
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And you can see why, from Ballmer's point of view,

264
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
that's a bad idea, right?

265
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
We hired this programmer, he came in, he drank our Cokes

266
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and played Foosball for three years and he had one idea.

267
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
(Laughter)

268
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Right? Bad hire. Right?

269
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
(Laughter)

270
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
The Psycho Milt question is, was it a good idea?

271
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
What if it was a security patch?

272
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
What if it was a security patch for a buffer overflow exploit,

273
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
of which Windows has not some, [but] several?

274
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Do you want that patch, right?

275
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
The fact that a single programmer can,

276
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
without having to move into a professional relation

277
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to an institution, improve Linux once

278
0:13:51.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and never be seen from again, should terrify Ballmer.

279
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Because this kind of value is unreachable in classic

280
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
institutional frameworks, but is part of cooperative

281
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
systems of open-source software, of file sharing,

282
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
of the Wikipedia. I've used a lot of examples from Flickr,

283
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
but there are actually stories about this from all over.

284
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Meetup, a service founded so that users could find people

285
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
in their local area who share their interests and affinities

286
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and actually have a real-world meeting offline in a cafe

287
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
or a pub or what have you.

288
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
When Scott Heiferman founded Meetup,

289
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
he thought it would be used for, you know,

290
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
train spotters and cat fanciers -- classic affinity groups.

291
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:3,000
The inventors don't know what the invention is.

292
0:14:30.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Number one group on Meetup right now,

293
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
most chapters in most cities with most members, most active?

294
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Stay-at-home moms. Right?

295
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
In the suburbanized, dual-income United States,

296
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
stay-at-home moms are actually missing

297
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
the social infrastructure that comes from extended family

298
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and local, small-scale neighborhoods.

299
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So they're reinventing it, using these tools.

300
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Meetup is the platform,

301
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
but the value here is in social infrastructure.

302
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
If you want to know what technology is going to change the world,

303
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
don't pay attention to 13-year-old boys --

304
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
pay attention to young mothers,

305
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
because they have got not an ounce of support for technology

306
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that doesn't materially make their lives better.

307
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
This is so much more important than Xbox,

308
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
but it's a lot less glitzy.

309
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I think this is a revolution.

310
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
I think that this is a really profound change

311
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
in the way human affairs are arranged.

312
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And I use that word advisedly.

313
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
It's a revolution in that it's a change in equilibrium.

314
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
It's a whole new way of doing things, which includes new downsides.

315
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
In the United States right now, a woman named Judith Miller

316
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
is in jail for not having given to a Federal Grand Jury her sources --

317
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
she's a reporter for the New York Times --

318
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
her sources, in a very abstract and hard-to-follow case.

319
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:45,000
And journalists are in the street rallying to improve the shield laws.

320
0:15:45.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
The shield laws are our laws -- pretty much a patchwork of state laws --

321
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
that prevent a journalist from having to betray a source.

322
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
This is happening, however, against the background

323
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
of the rise of Web logging.

324
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Web logging is a classic example of mass amateurization.

325
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
It has de-professionalized publishing.

326
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Want to publish globally anything you think today?

327
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
It is a one-button operation that you can do for free.

328
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
That has sent the professional class of publishing down

329
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
into the ranks of mass amateurization.

330
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And so the shield law, as much as we want it --

331
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:23,000
we want a professional class of truth-tellers --

332
0:16:23.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
it is becoming increasingly incoherent, because

333
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
the institution is becoming incoherent.

334
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:3,000
There are people in the States right now

335
0:16:30.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
tying themselves into knots, trying to figure out

336
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:35,000
whether or not bloggers are journalists.

337
0:16:35.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
And the answer to that question is,

338
0:16:37.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
it doesn't matter, because that's not the right question.

339
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Journalism was an answer to an even more important question,

340
0:16:44.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
which is, how will society be informed?

341
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
How will they share ideas and opinions?

342
0:16:49.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And if there is an answer to that that happens outside

343
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
the professional framework of journalism,

344
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
it makes no sense to take a professional metaphor

345
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and apply it to this distributed class.

346
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:04,000
So as much as we want the shield laws,

347
0:17:04.16,000 --> 0:17:08,000
the background -- the institution to which they were attached --

348
0:17:08.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
is becoming incoherent.

349
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
Here's another example.

350
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Pro-ana, the pro-ana groups.

351
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
These are groups of teenage girls

352
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
who have taken on Web logs, bulletin boards,

353
0:17:19.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
other kinds of cooperative infrastructure,

354
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and have used it to set up support groups for

355
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:25,000
remaining anorexic by choice.

356
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
They post pictures of thin models, which they call "thinspiration."

357
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
They have little slogans, like "Salvation through Starvation."

358
0:17:31.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
They even have Lance Armstrong-style bracelets,

359
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
these red bracelets, which signify, in the small group,

360
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
I am trying to maintain my eating disorder.

361
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
They trade tips, like, if you feel like eating something,

362
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
clean a toilet or the litter box. The feeling will pass.

363
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:49,000
We're used to support groups being beneficial.

364
0:17:49.16,000 --> 0:17:52,000
We have an attitude that support groups are inherently beneficial.

365
0:17:52.16,000 --> 0:17:56,000
But it turns out that the logic of the support group is value neutral.

366
0:17:56.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
A support group is simply a small group that wants to maintain

367
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
a way of living in the context of a larger group.

368
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Now, when the larger group is a bunch of drunks,

369
0:18:05.16,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and the small group wants to stay sober, then we think,

370
0:18:07.16,000 --> 0:18:09,000
that's a great support group.

371
0:18:09.16,000 --> 0:18:11,000
But when the small group is teenage girls

372
0:18:11.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
who want to stay anorexic by choice, then we're horrified.

373
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:18,000
What's happened is that the normative goals

374
0:18:18.16,000 --> 0:18:2,000
of the support groups that we're used to,

375
0:18:20.16,000 --> 0:18:23,000
came from the institutions that were framing them,

376
0:18:23.16,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and not from the infrastructure.

377
0:18:24.16,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Once the infrastructure becomes generically available,

378
0:18:28.16,000 --> 0:18:3,000
the logic of the support group has been revealed to be

379
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
accessible to anyone, including people pursuing these kinds of goals.

380
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:37,000
So, there are significant downsides to these changes

381
0:18:37.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
as well as upsides. And of course, in the current environment,

382
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
one need allude only lightly to the work of non-state actors

383
0:18:45.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
trying to influence global affairs, and taking advantage of these.

384
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
This is a social map of the hijackers and their associates

385
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:55,000
who perpetrated the 9/11 attack.

386
0:18:55.16,000 --> 0:18:59,000
It was produced by analyzing their communications patterns

387
0:18:59.16,000 --> 0:19:02,000
using a lot of these tools. And doubtless the intelligence communities of the world

388
0:19:02.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
are doing the same work today for the attacks of last week.

389
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:08,000
Now, this is the part of the talk where I tell you

390
0:19:08.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
what's going to come as a result of all of this,

391
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:13,000
but I'm running out of time, which is good,

392
0:19:13.16,000 --> 0:19:15,000
because I don't know.

393
0:19:15.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
(Laughter)

394
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:21,000
Right. As with the printing press, if it's really a revolution,

395
0:19:21.16,000 --> 0:19:23,000
it doesn't take us from Point A to Point B.

396
0:19:23.16,000 --> 0:19:26,000
It takes us from Point A to chaos.

397
0:19:26.16,000 --> 0:19:31,000
The printing press precipitated 200 years of chaos,

398
0:19:31.16,000 --> 0:19:33,000
moving from a world where the Catholic Church

399
0:19:33.16,000 --> 0:19:37,000
was the sort of organizing political force to the Treaty of Westphalia,

400
0:19:37.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
when we finally knew what the new unit was: the nation state.

401
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:45,000
Now, I'm not predicting 200 years of chaos as a result of this. 50.

402
0:19:45.16,000 --> 0:19:49,000
50 years in which loosely coordinated groups

403
0:19:49.16,000 --> 0:19:52,000
are going to be given increasingly high leverage,

404
0:19:52.16,000 --> 0:19:56,000
and the more those groups forego traditional institutional imperatives --

405
0:19:56.16,000 --> 0:19:59,000
like deciding in advance what's going to happen,

406
0:19:59.16,000 --> 0:20:02,000
or the profit motive -- the more leverage they'll get.

407
0:20:02.16,000 --> 0:20:04,000
And institutions are going to come under

408
0:20:04.16,000 --> 0:20:06,000
an increasing degree of pressure,

409
0:20:06.16,000 --> 0:20:08,000
and the more rigidly managed, and the more they rely

410
0:20:08.16,000 --> 0:20:12,000
on information monopolies, the greater the pressure is going to be.

411
0:20:12.16,000 --> 0:20:14,000
And that's going to happen one arena at a time,

412
0:20:14.16,000 --> 0:20:17,000
one institution at a time. The forces are general,

413
0:20:17.16,000 --> 0:20:19,000
but the results are going to be specific.

414
0:20:19.16,000 --> 0:20:21,000
And so the point here is not,

415
0:20:21.16,000 --> 0:20:24,000
"This is wonderful," or "We're going to see a transition

416
0:20:24.16,000 --> 0:20:27,000
from only institutions to only cooperative framework."

417
0:20:27.16,000 --> 0:20:29,000
It's going to be much more complicated than that.

418
0:20:29.16,000 --> 0:20:32,000
But the point is that it's going to be a massive readjustment.

419
0:20:32.16,000 --> 0:20:34,000
And since we can see it in advance and know it's coming,

420
0:20:34.16,000 --> 0:20:37,000
my argument is essentially: we might as well get good at it.

421
0:20:37.16,000 --> 0:20:39,000
Thank you very much.

422
0:20:39.16,000 --> 0:20:41,000
(Applause)

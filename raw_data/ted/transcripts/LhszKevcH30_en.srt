1
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I became obsessed with records when I was about 12 years old.

2
0:00:16.4,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My parents used to give me money to eat

3
0:00:18.6,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and on most days, instead of eating,

4
0:00:20.36,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I would save it and buy myself a record at the end of the week.

5
0:00:23.76,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Here I am with a gigantic Walkman that's about half my leg --

6
0:00:26.84,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:28.72,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It actually looks more like a VCR.

8
0:00:30.6,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:32.48,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So when I was a teenager,

10
0:00:33.76,000 --> 0:00:36,000
the obsession of buying cassettes, vinyls and CDs just kept growing.

11
0:00:37.76,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I was even working in a record store for many years

12
0:00:40.76,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and only ever got paid in records.

13
0:00:43.68,000 --> 0:00:45,000
One day I realized that I had thousands of records more

14
0:00:46.48,000 --> 0:00:48,000
than I could even listen to in my life.

15
0:00:49.08,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I became what many of us are:

16
0:00:51.08,000 --> 0:00:52,000
record junkies --

17
0:00:52.88,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or record diggers, as we like to call ourselves.

18
0:00:56.48,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Record digging, as the name suggests,

19
0:00:58.56,000 --> 0:01:,000
means getting your hands dirty.

20
0:01:00.72,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It means spending hours rummaging through warehouses,

21
0:01:04.28,000 --> 0:01:05,000
church basements,

22
0:01:05.56,000 --> 0:01:07,000
yard sales, record stores --

23
0:01:07.84,000 --> 0:01:1,000
all to find records that have been forgotten for decades.

24
0:01:11.36,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Records that have become cultural waste.

25
0:01:14.28,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The earliest record collectors from about the '30s to the 1960s

26
0:01:18.52,000 --> 0:01:2,000
found and preserved so many important records

27
0:01:21.36,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that would have been lost forever.

28
0:01:24.28,000 --> 0:01:26,000
In those days, most cultural and public institutions

29
0:01:27.24,000 --> 0:01:29,000
didn't really care to preserve these treasures.

30
0:01:29.48,000 --> 0:01:31,000
In many cases, they were just throwing them into the garbage.

31
0:01:33.68,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Record digging is a lifestyle.

32
0:01:35.64,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We're absolutely obsessed with obscure records,

33
0:01:39.08,000 --> 0:01:41,000
expensive records, dollar-bin records,

34
0:01:41.28,000 --> 0:01:42,000
crazy artwork,

35
0:01:42.6,000 --> 0:01:43,000
sub-subgenres.

36
0:01:44.68,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And all of the tiniest details that go with each release.

37
0:01:48.48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
When the media talks about the vinyl revival

38
0:01:50.6,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that's been happening these last few years,

39
0:01:52.68,000 --> 0:01:54,000
they often forget to mention this community

40
0:01:55.6,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that's been keeping the vinyl and the tradition and the culture alive

41
0:02:00.36,000 --> 0:02:01,000
for these last 30 years.

42
0:02:02.8,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It's a very close-knit but competitive society, a little bit,

43
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
because when you're hunting for extremely rare records,

44
0:02:09.24,000 --> 0:02:1,000
if you miss your opportunity,

45
0:02:10.68,000 --> 0:02:12,000
you might not see that record ever in your life.

46
0:02:14.04,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But I guess the only person in here truly impressed by record collectors

47
0:02:18.84,000 --> 0:02:19,000
is another record collector.

48
0:02:21.68,000 --> 0:02:22,000
To the outside world,

49
0:02:22.96,000 --> 0:02:26,000
we seem like a very weird, oddball group of individuals.

50
0:02:27.04,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And --

51
0:02:28.28,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:29.72,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And they're mostly right.

53
0:02:30.96,000 --> 0:02:32,000
All the record collectors I know are obsessive maniacs.

54
0:02:33.64,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We know we're all crazy in some way.

55
0:02:36.32,000 --> 0:02:38,000
But I think we should be viewed a little bit more like this.

56
0:02:39.28,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:40.32,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We're music archaeologists.

58
0:02:41.68,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We're hunting down the lost artifact.

59
0:02:44.32,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We all have a list of records that we would do anything to get our hands on,

60
0:02:47.96,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that we've been chasing for years,

61
0:02:49.64,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and we actually call this list our "holy grails."

62
0:02:53.2,000 --> 0:02:54,000
When you're digging for records,

63
0:02:54.84,000 --> 0:02:56,000
you're surrounded by music you don't know.

64
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:,000
You're surrounded by mystery and by all these dreams --

65
0:03:00.32,000 --> 0:03:01,000
records that people once believed in.

66
0:03:03.2,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Imagine the thousands of artists who were destined to be legends

67
0:03:06.76,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but for various reasons, were just overlooked.

68
0:03:10.4,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Many of these records only exist in a handful of copies,

69
0:03:13.64,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and some have never even been found,

70
0:03:15.92,000 --> 0:03:16,000
never been heard.

71
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
They're literally endangered species.

72
0:03:20.48,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I'll tell you a story

73
0:03:21.76,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that for me sort of sums up the value of the work of record diggers.

74
0:03:26.72,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The story of a brilliant Montreal musician and composer.

75
0:03:31.6,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Henri-Pierre Noël was born and raised in Haiti,

76
0:03:34.56,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but he lived briefly in the US and in Belgium.

77
0:03:37.76,000 --> 0:03:4,000
He passed through Montreal what was supposed to be for two weeks,

78
0:03:40.88,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but he ended up staying for the next 40 years.

79
0:03:43.08,000 --> 0:03:45,000
When he was young, he learned to play piano

80
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and developed a very particular way of playing his instrument:

81
0:03:48.12,000 --> 0:03:49,000
very fast and almost like a percussion.

82
0:03:50.96,000 --> 0:03:54,000
His style was a mix of his Haitian influences and folklore

83
0:03:55.08,000 --> 0:03:58,000
mixed with the American influences that he grew up hearing.

84
0:03:58.64,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So he created a mix of compas mixed with funk and jazz.

85
0:04:03.8,000 --> 0:04:04,000
As a young man,

86
0:04:05.04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
he played and toured with live bands in the US and in Europe,

87
0:04:07.96,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but had never recorded an album or a song before moving to Canada.

88
0:04:12.2,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It was in Montreal in 1979

89
0:04:14.68,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that he released his first album called, "Piano."

90
0:04:17.32,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Completely on his own, on Henri-Pierre Noël Records.

91
0:04:21.04,000 --> 0:04:24,000
He only made what he could afford: 2,000 copies of the record.

92
0:04:25.52,000 --> 0:04:27,000
The record received a little bit of airplay,

93
0:04:28.519,000 --> 0:04:3,000
a little bit of support in Canada and in Haiti,

94
0:04:31.519,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but without a big label behind it,

95
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:35,000
it was very, very difficult.

96
0:04:36.4,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Back then,

97
0:04:37.64,000 --> 0:04:39,000
if your record wasn't getting played on mainstream radio,

98
0:04:40.36,000 --> 0:04:43,000
if you weren't in jukeboxes or if you weren't invited to play on TV,

99
0:04:43.6,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the odds were completely against you.

100
0:04:45.44,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Releasing an album as an independent artist

101
0:04:48.08,000 --> 0:04:5,000
was so much more difficult than it is today,

102
0:04:50.2,000 --> 0:04:53,000
both in terms of being heard and just distributing the thing.

103
0:04:53.84,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So, soon after, he released a second album,

104
0:04:57.04,000 --> 0:05:,000
kept a busy schedule playing piano in various clubs in the city,

105
0:05:00.12,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but his records started to accumulate dust slowly.

106
0:05:04.04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And those 2,000 copies in the span of 30 years

107
0:05:06.84,000 --> 0:05:07,000
easily started to get lost

108
0:05:08.84,000 --> 0:05:11,000
until only a few copies in the world remained.

109
0:05:12.84,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Then in the mid-2000s,

110
0:05:15.24,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a Montreal record digger that goes by the name Kobal

111
0:05:18.12,000 --> 0:05:21,000
was doing his weekly rounds of just hunting for records.

112
0:05:21.72,000 --> 0:05:22,000
He was in a flea market

113
0:05:23.4,000 --> 0:05:27,000
surrounded by thousands of other dirty, dusty, moldy records.

114
0:05:27.52,000 --> 0:05:28,000
That's where he found the "Piano" album.

115
0:05:30.6,000 --> 0:05:31,000
He wasn't specifically looking for it.

116
0:05:32.48,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Actually, you could say it sort of found him.

117
0:05:34.84,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You could also say that after 20 years of record digging every single week,

118
0:05:38.84,000 --> 0:05:4,000
he had developed a sixth sense for finding the gold.

119
0:05:42.84,000 --> 0:05:43,000
He took the record and inspected it:

120
0:05:44.84,000 --> 0:05:46,000
the front, the artwork, the back, the liner notes,

121
0:05:47.68,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and he was intrigued by the fact that this Haitian musician made a record

122
0:05:51.4,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in Quebec in the late '70s,

123
0:05:53.76,000 --> 0:05:54,000
so he was intrigued.

124
0:05:56.24,000 --> 0:05:58,000
He took out his little, plastic, portable turntable

125
0:05:58.84,000 --> 0:06:01,000
that he brought with him whenever he was on these digging quests

126
0:06:02.72,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and put the record on.

127
0:06:04.4,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So why don't we do the same thing?

128
0:06:14.64,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Music)

129
0:06:45.68,000 --> 0:06:49,000
He fell in love with the music instantly,

130
0:06:49.76,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but he had to know the backstory behind it.

131
0:06:51.84,000 --> 0:06:52,000
He didn't know where it came from.

132
0:06:54.76,000 --> 0:06:55,000
He knew the artist,

133
0:06:56.04,000 --> 0:06:57,000
at the time of the recording,

134
0:06:57.48,000 --> 0:06:58,000
was living in Montreal,

135
0:06:58.76,000 --> 0:07:,000
so for months, he tried to track him down.

136
0:07:01.52,000 --> 0:07:04,000
He even found Noël's business card inside the record sleeve.

137
0:07:05.64,000 --> 0:07:08,000
That's how DIY Henri-Pierre Noël was.

138
0:07:09.68,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So he found the card inside the record sleeve --

139
0:07:13.2,000 --> 0:07:14,000
of course he did try to call,

140
0:07:14.64,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but after 30 years, the number didn't work anymore.

141
0:07:18.88,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So it was only in Belgium,

142
0:07:20.96,000 --> 0:07:21,000
where the artist had once lived,

143
0:07:22.56,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that Kobal managed to find someone that knew the artist personally

144
0:07:25.72,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and gave him the contact.

145
0:07:27.52,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So when he finally sat down with the artist,

146
0:07:30.6,000 --> 0:07:35,000
he made him a promise to someday find a way to get the album rereleased.

147
0:07:37.2,000 --> 0:07:4,000
He then arranged for a British label called Wah Wah 45s

148
0:07:40.84,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to get the two albums reissued.

149
0:07:43.68,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And what happens very often is,

150
0:07:45.52,000 --> 0:07:46,000
in these reissue projects,

151
0:07:46.8,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that it becomes very difficult to find the master tapes --

152
0:07:49.96,000 --> 0:07:51,000
the original recording of the sessions.

153
0:07:52.08,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Art can be destroyed by fires, floods, earthquakes,

154
0:07:55.08,000 --> 0:07:56,000
thrown in the garbage,

155
0:07:56.32,000 --> 0:07:57,000
or just lost forever.

156
0:07:57.84,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But thankfully,

157
0:07:59.08,000 --> 0:08:,000
the Henri-Pierre Noël tapes were safe

158
0:08:00.92,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and they were ready for remastering.

159
0:08:03.32,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The record was finally rereleased

160
0:08:05.32,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and received praise from music critics, DJs and listeners worldwide --

161
0:08:10.08,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the praise that it should have received in 1979.

162
0:08:15.36,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The artist was so inspired that he decided to revive his music career,

163
0:08:18.84,000 --> 0:08:2,000
get back on a stage, and play for new audiences.

164
0:08:22.68,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The artist, now in his 60s,

165
0:08:25.48,000 --> 0:08:27,000
told me, "This changed everything for me.

166
0:08:27.8,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I went from planning my retirement

167
0:08:29.48,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to playing on the BBC Radio in London, and on Radio Canada and more."

168
0:08:33.76,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But also it gave him a chance to play

169
0:08:35.6,000 --> 0:08:37,000
in front of his three sons for the first time.

170
0:08:38.12,000 --> 0:08:43,000
To me, this story shows perfectly the work of record diggers at its best.

171
0:08:43.2,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Beyond the rarity and the dollar value --

172
0:08:45.2,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and I'll be honest, we're totally obsessed by that --

173
0:08:48.159,000 --> 0:08:51,000
the true beauty is to give art a second chance;

174
0:08:51.64,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to save art from oblivion.

175
0:08:54.48,000 --> 0:08:57,000
The work of a good record digger is a constant loop of three phases.

176
0:08:57.8,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The first thing we do is hunt.

177
0:09:00.04,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We spend hours, days, years of our lives

178
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
rummaging through dirty and dusty record bins.

179
0:09:05.24,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Everything that we can do to find our hands on the gold.

180
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Yes, you can find good records online,

181
0:09:12.28,000 --> 0:09:13,000
but for the deepest treasures,

182
0:09:13.76,000 --> 0:09:15,000
you need to get off the couch and into the wild.

183
0:09:16.4,000 --> 0:09:18,000
That's why we call it record digging and not record clicking.

184
0:09:19.32,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Laughter)

185
0:09:20.48,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So what we are is music archaeologists.

186
0:09:23.24,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But then the next thing we do is we gather.

187
0:09:25.44,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Based on our taste, expertise, personal agenda,

188
0:09:27.72,000 --> 0:09:29,000
we choose carefully which records to save,

189
0:09:30.08,000 --> 0:09:32,000
which records mean something to us.

190
0:09:32.28,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We then try and find out every little thing we can about that record --

191
0:09:35.96,000 --> 0:09:36,000
the artist, the label

192
0:09:37.44,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and supervital information

193
0:09:39.48,000 --> 0:09:41,000
like "Who's that playing trumpet on track three?"

194
0:09:42.96,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Then we file them, we contextualize them,

195
0:09:44.96,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and we keep them safe.

196
0:09:46.24,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We are music archivists.

197
0:09:48.4,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And the last thing we do to close the loop is we share.

198
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Most record diggers that I know have some sort of a way

199
0:09:54.84,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to share their discovery and elevate the artist

200
0:09:57.28,000 --> 0:09:58,000
through an album reissue,

201
0:09:58.56,000 --> 0:10:,000
a web article, a radio show.

202
0:10:01.8,000 --> 0:10:04,000
We give records back their rightful place in music history.

203
0:10:05.52,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We are tastemakers and curators.

204
0:10:07.12,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We are musicologists.

205
0:10:09.72,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So for myself

206
0:10:10.96,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and most of the record collectors I've encountered in 20 years,

207
0:10:13.96,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I think that we all have some sort of an outlet

208
0:10:16.4,000 --> 0:10:17,000
for these discoveries.

209
0:10:17.68,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I think it's our way to keep our sanity and sort of sense of purpose

210
0:10:21.76,000 --> 0:10:23,000
in this very maddening obsession,

211
0:10:24.56,000 --> 0:10:25,000
because it can be sort of a lonely one.

212
0:10:26.48,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But I think we also do it because it serves the human need

213
0:10:29.219,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to pass along cultural knowledge.

214
0:10:31.92,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Speaking of the need for curation,

215
0:10:34.12,000 --> 0:10:35,000
in an era of overwhelming choice,

216
0:10:36.04,000 --> 0:10:37,000
it's been demonstrated

217
0:10:37.32,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that too much choice actually hinders discovery.

218
0:10:39.96,000 --> 0:10:4,000
For example,

219
0:10:41.2,000 --> 0:10:43,000
if you're trying to watch something on Netflix,

220
0:10:43.84,000 --> 0:10:47,000
you're actually only browsing through a catalog of 6,000 titles.

221
0:10:48.36,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Now, compare that with Spotify;

222
0:10:50.28,000 --> 0:10:52,000
if you want to pick something to listen to,

223
0:10:52.4,000 --> 0:10:55,000
you're browsing through a catalog of 30 million songs.

224
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So I think as you can see,

225
0:10:57.44,000 --> 0:10:59,000
this notion of paralysis by choice

226
0:10:59.64,000 --> 0:11:02,000
affects music more than movies,

227
0:11:02.72,000 --> 0:11:03,000
for example.

228
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And there's a few studies

229
0:11:05.44,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that are starting to show the effects of this.

230
0:11:07.64,000 --> 0:11:08,000
A recent look at the UK music market

231
0:11:09.4,000 --> 0:11:14,000
shows that the top one percent of artists in the UK are actually earning 77 percent

232
0:11:14.84,000 --> 0:11:16,000
of the total revenues inside the music industry.

233
0:11:17.48,000 --> 0:11:18,000
That's 2013,

234
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and that's progressively getting worse,

235
0:11:22.24,000 --> 0:11:23,000
or progressing.

236
0:11:24.04,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Anyway, if you're in the one percent, I'm sure you're happy.

237
0:11:26.92,000 --> 0:11:27,000
(Laughter)

238
0:11:28.2,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So the takeaway for me is

239
0:11:31.64,000 --> 0:11:35,000
it's easier for people to listen to music than ever before.

240
0:11:36.96,000 --> 0:11:38,000
People have more music at their disposal than ever before,

241
0:11:39.72,000 --> 0:11:42,000
yet people choose to listen to more of the same music than ever before.

242
0:11:43.52,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And that's a sad thing.

243
0:11:47.76,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Inspired by my love for music research, record digging and curation,

244
0:11:51.92,000 --> 0:11:55,000
I started a website called "Music Is My Sanctuary" in 2007.

245
0:11:56.08,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Our slogan has always been "Future Classics and Forgotten Treasures."

246
0:11:59.84,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And it shows our love for discovering music

247
0:12:02.36,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and introducing music both old and new.

248
0:12:04.96,000 --> 0:12:05,000
From humble beginnings,

249
0:12:06.24,000 --> 0:12:08,000
we've built a worldwide platform with a massive audience

250
0:12:09.08,000 --> 0:12:11,000
with over 100 collaborators.

251
0:12:11.28,000 --> 0:12:13,000
We've created over 10,000 pieces of content,

252
0:12:13.64,000 --> 0:12:15,000
over 500 hours of audio content.

253
0:12:16.88,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Our audience consists of people

254
0:12:18.4,000 --> 0:12:2,000
who just want more than what's being offered to them

255
0:12:20.88,000 --> 0:12:21,000
by mainstream music channels.

256
0:12:22.4,000 --> 0:12:23,000
They want to do --

257
0:12:24.32,000 --> 0:12:25,000
they want to dig deeper,

258
0:12:25.68,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but they don't necessarily have 20 hours a week like us nerds,

259
0:12:30.44,000 --> 0:12:31,000
so they trust us to do that for them.

260
0:12:33.4,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Curation is at the heart of everything we do.

261
0:12:35.56,000 --> 0:12:37,000
We believe in human recommendations over algorithms.

262
0:12:40.68,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I could talk about the passion of record digging for days,

263
0:12:44.36,000 --> 0:12:46,000
but let me conclude this way.

264
0:12:46.6,000 --> 0:12:47,000
After many years of doing it,

265
0:12:48.36,000 --> 0:12:52,000
a record collector's collection becomes sort of his autobiography.

266
0:12:54.88,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Last year, I was DJ-ing in Poland,

267
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and the people that were hosting me,

268
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
they had this amazing record collection,

269
0:13:01.28,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and of course I was intrigued

270
0:13:02.92,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and I said, "Are you selling these?"

271
0:13:05.52,000 --> 0:13:07,000
They then explained to me that it was the collection

272
0:13:08.12,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that belonged to their dear friend Maceo who passed away a few months earlier.

273
0:13:13.6,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And they were doing a project of inviting different people

274
0:13:17.2,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to take the collection and to create something new from it,

275
0:13:20.12,000 --> 0:13:22,000
whether it's sampling or DJ mixes,

276
0:13:22.6,000 --> 0:13:24,000
you know, just to give it a second life.

277
0:13:24.8,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And so after a few hours of going through the collection myself

278
0:13:27.8,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and creating a DJ mix from it,

279
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:32,000
even though I never got the chance to meet him,

280
0:13:32.48,000 --> 0:13:34,000
it felt like in a special way,

281
0:13:35.12,000 --> 0:13:36,000
me and him,

282
0:13:36.36,000 --> 0:13:38,000
we got to talk about records for a few hours.

283
0:13:39.12,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So, as record diggers,

284
0:13:42.76,000 --> 0:13:45,000
our work and our record collections are there

285
0:13:45.88,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to be passed on to the next generation.

286
0:13:48.36,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Beautiful art deserves to be cherished, shared and rediscovered.

287
0:13:54.12,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Embrace curators;

288
0:13:55.84,000 --> 0:13:58,000
we are alternative voices to the mainstream music channels,

289
0:13:59.04,000 --> 0:14:,000
digital or otherwise.

290
0:14:01.24,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Go beyond the algorithm.

291
0:14:03.92,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Whatever kind of music you like,

292
0:14:05.52,000 --> 0:14:09,000
there are so many websites, radio shows, DJs, record stores out there

293
0:14:09.92,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that are just waiting to share their discoveries with you.

294
0:14:12.68,000 --> 0:14:13,000
We do this work for you.

295
0:14:14.04,000 --> 0:14:17,000
All you have to do is open your ears and take risks.

296
0:14:17.08,000 --> 0:14:18,000
This music will change your life.

297
0:14:19.04,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Thank you.

298
0:14:20.28,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

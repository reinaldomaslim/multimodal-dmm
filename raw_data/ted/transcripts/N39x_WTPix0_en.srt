1
0:00:12.527,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Anyone in the room thought about sex today?

2
0:00:15.372,000 --> 0:00:16,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:16.532,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Yeah, you did.

4
0:00:17.737,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Thank you for putting your hand up over there.

5
0:00:20.203,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Well, I'm here to provide you with

6
0:00:21.923,000 --> 0:00:22,000
some biological validation

7
0:00:23.618,000 --> 0:00:24,000
for your sordid daydreams.

8
0:00:25.048,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm here to tell you a few things

9
0:00:26.442,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that you might not have known about wild sex.

10
0:00:29.948,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Now, when humans think about sex,

11
0:00:31.796,000 --> 0:00:32,000
male and female forms

12
0:00:33.526,000 --> 0:00:34,000
are generally what come to mind,

13
0:00:35.197,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but for many millions of years,

14
0:00:37.65,000 --> 0:00:39,000
such specific categories didn't even exist.

15
0:00:40.271,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Sex was a mere fusion of bodies

16
0:00:42.874,000 --> 0:00:43,000
or a trickle of DNA

17
0:00:44.484,000 --> 0:00:46,000
shared between two or more beings.

18
0:00:47.026,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It wasn't until about 500 million years ago

19
0:00:49.351,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that we start to see structures akin to a penis

20
0:00:52.715,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or a thing that gives DNA out,

21
0:00:55.373,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and a vagina, something that receives it.

22
0:00:58.527,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now invariably, you're probably thinking about

23
0:01:00.852,000 --> 0:01:02,000
what belongs to our own species,

24
0:01:03.272,000 --> 0:01:04,000
these very familiar structures,

25
0:01:05.17,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but the diversity that we see in sexual structures

26
0:01:07.456,000 --> 0:01:08,000
in the animal kingdom that has evolved

27
0:01:09.444,000 --> 0:01:11,000
in response to the multitude of factors

28
0:01:12.092,000 --> 0:01:13,000
surrounding reproduction

29
0:01:13.753,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is pretty mind-blowing.

30
0:01:16.147,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Penile diversity is especially profuse.

31
0:01:19.788,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So this is a paper nautilus.

32
0:01:21.933,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It's a close relative of squid and octopus,

33
0:01:24.843,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and males have a hectocotylus.

34
0:01:27.965,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Just what is a hectocotylus?

35
0:01:29.715,000 --> 0:01:33,000
A detachable, swimming penis.

36
0:01:33.894,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It leaves the [body of the male],

37
0:01:36.303,000 --> 0:01:39,000
finds the female through pheromonal cues in the water,

38
0:01:39.503,000 --> 0:01:4,000
attaches itself to her body

39
0:01:41.414,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and deposits the sperm.

40
0:01:42.722,000 --> 0:01:44,000
For many decades, biologists actually felt

41
0:01:45.246,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that the hectocotylus was a separate organism altogether.

42
0:01:49.691,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now, the tapir is a mammal from South America.

43
0:01:52.679,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And the tapir has a prehensile penis.

44
0:01:55.627,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It actually has a level of dexterity in its penis

45
0:01:58.669,000 --> 0:02:,000
much akin to what we have with our hands.

46
0:02:01.095,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And it uses this dexterity

47
0:02:02.767,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to bypass the vagina altogether

48
0:02:04.983,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and deposit sperm directly into the female's uterus,

49
0:02:08.354,000 --> 0:02:11,000
not to mention it's a pretty good size.

50
0:02:11.908,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The biggest penis in the animal kingdom,

51
0:02:13.837,000 --> 0:02:14,000
however, is not that of the tapir.

52
0:02:15.532,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The biggest penis-to-body-size ratio

53
0:02:17.864,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in the animal kingdom actually belongs

54
0:02:19.558,000 --> 0:02:21,000
to the meager beach barnacle,

55
0:02:21.809,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and this video is actually showing you

56
0:02:24.001,000 --> 0:02:26,000
what the human penis would look like

57
0:02:26.085,000 --> 0:02:29,000
if it were the same size as that of a barnacle.

58
0:02:29.546,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:32.732,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Mm-hm. (Laughter)

60
0:02:34.995,000 --> 0:02:36,000
So with all of this diversity in structure,

61
0:02:37.793,000 --> 0:02:39,000
one might think, then, that penises

62
0:02:39.95,000 --> 0:02:41,000
are fitting neatly into vaginas all over the place

63
0:02:42.921,000 --> 0:02:44,000
for the purposes of successful reproduction.

64
0:02:44.998,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Simply insert part A into slot B,

65
0:02:47.543,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and we should all be good to go.

66
0:02:49.618,000 --> 0:02:51,000
But of course, that doesn't exactly happen,

67
0:02:51.947,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and that's because we can't just take form into account.

68
0:02:54.875,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We have to think about function as well,

69
0:02:57.157,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and when it comes to sex,

70
0:02:58.947,000 --> 0:03:,000
function relates to the contributions made

71
0:03:01.473,000 --> 0:03:03,000
by the gametes, or the sperm and the eggs.

72
0:03:04.272,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And these contributions are far from equal.

73
0:03:07.606,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Eggs are very expensive to make,

74
0:03:09.992,000 --> 0:03:11,000
so it makes sense for females to be very choosy

75
0:03:12.943,000 --> 0:03:14,000
about who she shares them with.

76
0:03:15.38,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Sperm, on the other hand, is abundant and cheap,

77
0:03:19.193,000 --> 0:03:2,000
so it makes more sense for males

78
0:03:21.045,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to have a more-sex-is-better strategy

79
0:03:23.195,000 --> 0:03:24,000
when it comes to siring members

80
0:03:24.607,000 --> 0:03:25,000
of future generations.

81
0:03:26.453,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So how do animals cope

82
0:03:28.165,000 --> 0:03:3,000
with these very incongruent needs between the sexes?

83
0:03:31.05,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I mean, if a female doesn't choose a particular male,

84
0:03:34.299,000 --> 0:03:36,000
or if she has the ability to store sperm

85
0:03:36.738,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and she simply has enough,

86
0:03:38.415,000 --> 0:03:4,000
then it makes more sense for her to spend her time

87
0:03:40.488,000 --> 0:03:42,000
doing other biologically relevant things:

88
0:03:43.166,000 --> 0:03:45,000
avoiding predators, taking care of offspring,

89
0:03:46.023,000 --> 0:03:48,000
gathering and ingesting food.

90
0:03:48.193,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This is, of course, bad news for any male

91
0:03:50.506,000 --> 0:03:52,000
who has yet to make a deposit in her sperm bank,

92
0:03:53.057,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and this sets the scene for some pretty drastic strategies

93
0:03:56.162,000 --> 0:03:59,000
for successful fertilization.

94
0:03:59.468,000 --> 0:04:01,000
This is bedbug sex,

95
0:04:01.475,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and it's aptly termed traumatic insemination.

96
0:04:05.749,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Males have a spiked, barbed penis

97
0:04:08.543,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that they literally stab into the female,

98
0:04:11.147,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and they don't stab it anywhere near her vagina.

99
0:04:14.008,000 --> 0:04:16,000
They stab it anywhere in her body,

100
0:04:16.143,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and the sperm simply migrates

101
0:04:17.94,000 --> 0:04:2,000
through her hemolymph to her ovaries.

102
0:04:21.244,000 --> 0:04:23,000
If a female gets too many stab wounds,

103
0:04:23.388,000 --> 0:04:25,000
or if a stab wound happens to become infected,

104
0:04:25.734,000 --> 0:04:27,000
she can actually die from it.

105
0:04:28.113,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Now if you've ever been out for a nice,

106
0:04:29.884,000 --> 0:04:3,000
peaceful walk by the lake

107
0:04:31.775,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and happened to see some ducks having sex,

108
0:04:34.517,000 --> 0:04:35,000
you've undoubtedly been alarmed,

109
0:04:36.212,000 --> 0:04:38,000
because it looks like gang rape.

110
0:04:38.723,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And quite frankly, that's exactly what it is.

111
0:04:41.384,000 --> 0:04:43,000
A group of males will grab a female,

112
0:04:43.604,000 --> 0:04:44,000
hold her down,

113
0:04:44.773,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and ballistically ejaculate their spiral-shaped penis

114
0:04:49.203,000 --> 0:04:52,000
into her corkscrew-shaped vagina

115
0:04:52.287,000 --> 0:04:54,000
over and over and over again.

116
0:04:55.193,000 --> 0:04:58,000
From flaccid to ejaculation in less than a second.

117
0:04:58.982,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now the female actually gets the last laugh, though,

118
0:05:01.117,000 --> 0:05:03,000
because she can actually manipulate her posture

119
0:05:03.944,000 --> 0:05:06,000
so as to allow the sperm of certain suitors

120
0:05:07.049,000 --> 0:05:1,000
better access to her ovaries.

121
0:05:10.311,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, I like to share stories like this with my audiences

122
0:05:12.421,000 --> 0:05:13,000
because, yeah, we humans,

123
0:05:13.877,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we tend to think sex, sex is fun, sex is good,

124
0:05:17.022,000 --> 0:05:19,000
there's romance, and there's orgasm.

125
0:05:19.263,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But orgasm didn't actually evolve

126
0:05:20.945,000 --> 0:05:22,000
until about 65 million years ago

127
0:05:23.031,000 --> 0:05:24,000
with the advent of mammals.

128
0:05:24.798,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But some animals had it going on quite a bit before that.

129
0:05:27.662,000 --> 0:05:28,000
There are some more primitive ways

130
0:05:29.416,000 --> 0:05:31,000
of pleasing one's partner.

131
0:05:31.817,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Earwig males have either

132
0:05:33.873,000 --> 0:05:34,000
really large penile appendages

133
0:05:35.631,000 --> 0:05:36,000
or really small ones.

134
0:05:37.032,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It's a very simple genetically inherited trait

135
0:05:39.853,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and the males are not otherwise any different.

136
0:05:41.839,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Those that have long penile appendages

137
0:05:43.801,000 --> 0:05:44,000
are not bigger or stronger

138
0:05:45.569,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or otherwise any different at all.

139
0:05:47.073,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So going back to our biological minds, then,

140
0:05:49.614,000 --> 0:05:51,000
we might think that females should choose

141
0:05:51.731,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to have sex with the guys that have the shorter appendages,

142
0:05:54.712,000 --> 0:05:56,000
because she can use her time for other things:

143
0:05:57.277,000 --> 0:05:58,000
avoiding predators, taking care of young,

144
0:05:58.953,000 --> 0:05:59,000
finding and ingesting food.

145
0:06:00.801,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But biologists have repeatedly observed

146
0:06:03.617,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that females choose to have sex

147
0:06:05.585,000 --> 0:06:09,000
with the males that have the long appendages.

148
0:06:09.714,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Why do they do this?

149
0:06:11.677,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Well, according to the biological literature,

150
0:06:14.076,000 --> 0:06:16,000
"During copulation, the genitalia of certain males

151
0:06:16.903,000 --> 0:06:18,000
may elicit more favorable female responses

152
0:06:19.523,000 --> 0:06:22,000
through superior mechanical or stimulatory interaction

153
0:06:22.6,000 --> 0:06:25,000
with the female reproductive tract."

154
0:06:26.158,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Mm-hm.

155
0:06:28.549,000 --> 0:06:29,000
These are Mexican guppies,

156
0:06:30.486,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and what you see on their upper maxilla

157
0:06:32.617,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is an outgrowth of epidermal filaments,

158
0:06:35.019,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and these filaments basically form

159
0:06:36.864,000 --> 0:06:38,000
a fish mustache, if you will.

160
0:06:39.462,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Now males have been observed to prod

161
0:06:41.804,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the female's genital opening

162
0:06:43.468,000 --> 0:06:44,000
prior to copulating with her,

163
0:06:45.415,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and in what I have lovingly termed the Magnum, P.I. hypothesis,

164
0:06:48.924,000 --> 0:06:52,000
females are overwhelmingly more likely to be found

165
0:06:52.936,000 --> 0:06:55,000
with males that have these fish mustaches.

166
0:06:56.901,000 --> 0:06:59,000
A little guppy porn for you right there.

167
0:07:00.198,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So we've seen very different strategies

168
0:07:02.954,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that males are using when it comes to

169
0:07:05.192,000 --> 0:07:06,000
winning a female partner.

170
0:07:06.788,000 --> 0:07:1,000
We've seen a coercion strategy in which sexual structures are used in a forceful way

171
0:07:11.776,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to basically make a female have sex.

172
0:07:13.549,000 --> 0:07:15,000
We've also seen a titillation strategy

173
0:07:15.606,000 --> 0:07:16,000
where males are actually

174
0:07:17.543,000 --> 0:07:19,000
pleasing their female partners into choosing them

175
0:07:19.691,000 --> 0:07:2,000
as a sex partner.

176
0:07:21.41,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Now unfortunately, in the animal kingdom,

177
0:07:23.855,000 --> 0:07:25,000
it's the coercion strategy that we see

178
0:07:26.271,000 --> 0:07:27,000
time and time again.

179
0:07:28.01,000 --> 0:07:3,000
It's very common in many phyla,

180
0:07:30.357,000 --> 0:07:32,000
from invertebrates to avian species,

181
0:07:32.99,000 --> 0:07:34,000
mammals, and, of course, even in primates.

182
0:07:35.536,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Now interestingly, there are a few mammalian species

183
0:07:39.073,000 --> 0:07:42,000
in which females have evolved specialized genitalia

184
0:07:42.305,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that doesn't allow for sexual coercion to take place.

185
0:07:46.974,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Female elephants and female hyenas

186
0:07:49.342,000 --> 0:07:51,000
have a penile clitoris,

187
0:07:51.716,000 --> 0:07:54,000
or an enlarged clitoral tissue that hangs externally,

188
0:07:55.523,000 --> 0:07:56,000
much like a penis,

189
0:07:57.082,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and in fact it's very difficult to sex these animals

190
0:07:59.466,000 --> 0:08:02,000
by merely looking at their external morphology.

191
0:08:02.633,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So before a male can insert his penis into a female's vagina,

192
0:08:06.225,000 --> 0:08:07,000
she has to take this penile clitoris

193
0:08:08.08,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and basically inside-out it in her own body.

194
0:08:11.643,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I mean, imagine putting a penis into another penis.

195
0:08:14.58,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's simply not going to happen

196
0:08:16.112,000 --> 0:08:19,000
unless the female is on board with the action.

197
0:08:19.434,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Now, even more interesting is the fact

198
0:08:21.247,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that elephant and hyena societies

199
0:08:23.256,000 --> 0:08:25,000
are entirely matriarchal:

200
0:08:25.685,000 --> 0:08:27,000
they're run by females, groups of females,

201
0:08:28.187,000 --> 0:08:3,000
sisters, aunts and offspring,

202
0:08:30.433,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and when young males attain sexual maturity,

203
0:08:33.636,000 --> 0:08:34,000
they're turfed out of the group.

204
0:08:35.513,000 --> 0:08:37,000
In hyena societies, adult males

205
0:08:37.596,000 --> 0:08:4,000
are actually the lowest on the social scale.

206
0:08:40.858,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They can take part in a kill only after

207
0:08:43.291,000 --> 0:08:45,000
everybody else, including the offspring.

208
0:08:46.021,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So it seems that when you take the penis power

209
0:08:48.339,000 --> 0:08:49,000
away from a male,

210
0:08:50.177,000 --> 0:08:54,000
you take away all the social power he has.

211
0:08:54.236,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So what are my take-home messages from my talk today?

212
0:08:56.878,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Well, sex is just so much more

213
0:08:59.559,000 --> 0:09:01,000
than insert part A into slot B

214
0:09:02.158,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and hope that the offspring run around everywhere.

215
0:09:05.3,000 --> 0:09:07,000
The sexual strategies and reproductive structures

216
0:09:07.957,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that we see in the animal kingdom basically

217
0:09:10.98,000 --> 0:09:13,000
dictate how males and females will react to each other,

218
0:09:14.908,000 --> 0:09:16,000
which then dictates how populations and societies

219
0:09:17.654,000 --> 0:09:18,000
form and evolve.

220
0:09:19.284,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So it may not be surprising to any of you

221
0:09:21.753,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that animals, including ourselves,

222
0:09:23.561,000 --> 0:09:26,000
spend a good amount of time thinking about sex,

223
0:09:27.171,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but what might surprise you is the extent to which

224
0:09:30.347,000 --> 0:09:34,000
so many other aspects of their lives and our lives

225
0:09:34.418,000 --> 0:09:35,000
are influenced by it.

226
0:09:36.24,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So thank you, and happy daydreaming.

227
0:09:38.203,000 --> 0:09:42,000

1
0:00:13.389,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So when I do my job, people hate me.

2
0:00:16.786,000 --> 0:00:18,000
In fact, the better I do my job,

3
0:00:19.34,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the more people hate me.

4
0:00:21.145,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And no, I'm not a meter maid,

5
0:00:23.096,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I'm not an undertaker.

6
0:00:25.13,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I am a progressive, lesbian talking head on Fox News.

7
0:00:29.076,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Applause)

8
0:00:31.163,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So y'all heard that, right? Just to make sure, right?

9
0:00:33.679,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I am a gay talking head on Fox News.

10
0:00:36.906,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I am going to tell you how I do it,

11
0:00:38.621,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and the most important thing I've learned.

12
0:00:40.842,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So I go on television.

13
0:00:42.544,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I debate people who literally want to obliterate everything I believe in --

14
0:00:46.664,000 --> 0:00:49,000
in some cases, who don't want me and people like me to even exist.

15
0:00:50.877,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's sort of like Thanksgiving with your conservative uncle

16
0:00:54.008,000 --> 0:00:55,000
on steroids,

17
0:00:55.537,000 --> 0:00:58,000
with a live television audience of millions.

18
0:00:58.933,000 --> 0:01:,000
It's totally almost just like that.

19
0:01:01.242,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And that's just on air.

20
0:01:03.387,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The hate mail I get is unbelievable.

21
0:01:05.671,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Last week alone, I got 238 pieces of nasty email

22
0:01:10.801,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and more hate tweets than I can even count.

23
0:01:13.718,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I was called an idiot, a traitor, a scourge,

24
0:01:17.107,000 --> 0:01:19,000
a cunt and an ugly man,

25
0:01:19.715,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and that was just in one email.

26
0:01:21.377,000 --> 0:01:23,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:24.195,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So what have I realized,

28
0:01:26.978,000 --> 0:01:28,000
being on the receiving end of all this ugliness?

29
0:01:29.739,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Well, my biggest takeaway

30
0:01:31.398,000 --> 0:01:34,000
is that for decades, we've been focused on political correctness,

31
0:01:35.633,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but what matters more is emotional correctness.

32
0:01:39.993,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Let me give you a small example.

33
0:01:41.842,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I don't care if you call me a dyke. I really don't.

34
0:01:44.687,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I care about two things.

35
0:01:46.07,000 --> 0:01:48,000
One, I care that you spell it right.

36
0:01:48.728,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

37
0:01:53.706,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Just quick refresher, it's D-Y-K-E.

38
0:01:57.358,000 --> 0:01:59,000
You'd totally be surprised.

39
0:02:00.247,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And second, I don't care about the word, I care about how you use it.

40
0:02:03.518,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Are you being friendly? Are you just being naive?

41
0:02:05.997,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Or do you really want to hurt me personally?

42
0:02:09.885,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Emotional correctness is the tone, the feeling,

43
0:02:14.407,000 --> 0:02:15,000
how we say what we say,

44
0:02:16.392,000 --> 0:02:18,000
the respect and compassion we show one another.

45
0:02:19.751,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And what I've realized is that political persuasion

46
0:02:22.424,000 --> 0:02:25,000
doesn't begin with ideas or facts or data.

47
0:02:26.335,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Political persuasion begins with being emotionally correct.

48
0:02:30.68,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So when I first went to go work at Fox News,

49
0:02:33.241,000 --> 0:02:34,000
true confession,

50
0:02:34.718,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I expected there to be marks in the carpet

51
0:02:37.384,000 --> 0:02:38,000
from all the knuckle-dragging.

52
0:02:39.93,000 --> 0:02:42,000
That, by the way, in case you're paying attention, is not emotionally correct.

53
0:02:43.63,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But liberals on my side,

54
0:02:47.033,000 --> 0:02:5,000
we can be self-righteous, we can be condescending,

55
0:02:50.588,000 --> 0:02:52,000
we can be dismissive of anyone who doesn't agree with us.

56
0:02:53.385,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In other words, we can be politically right

57
0:02:56.199,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but emotionally wrong.

58
0:02:59.068,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And incidentally, that means that people don't like us. Right?

59
0:03:05.087,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now here's the kicker.

60
0:03:07.003,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Conservatives are really nice.

61
0:03:09.611,000 --> 0:03:1,000
I mean, not all of them,

62
0:03:11.092,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and not the ones who send me hate mail,

63
0:03:12.977,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but you would be surprised.

64
0:03:14.616,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Sean Hannity is one of the sweetest guys I've ever met.

65
0:03:18.91,000 --> 0:03:21,000
He spends his free time trying to fix up his staff on blind dates,

66
0:03:23.089,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and I know that if I ever had a problem,

67
0:03:25.187,000 --> 0:03:26,000
he would do anything he could to help.

68
0:03:27.896,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Now, I think Sean Hannity is 99 percent politically wrong,

69
0:03:33.057,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but his emotional correctness is strikingly impressive.

70
0:03:36.458,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And that's why people listen to him.

71
0:03:38.46,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Because you can't get anyone to agree with you

72
0:03:41.016,000 --> 0:03:42,000
if they don't even listen to you first.

73
0:03:43.792,000 --> 0:03:45,000
We spend so much time talking past each other

74
0:03:46.828,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and not enough time talking through our disagreements.

75
0:03:49.871,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And if we can start to find compassion for one another,

76
0:03:53.71,000 --> 0:03:55,000
then we have a shot at building common ground.

77
0:03:57.792,000 --> 0:04:,000
It actually sounds really hokey to say it standing up here,

78
0:04:01.284,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but when you try to put it in practice,

79
0:04:03.487,000 --> 0:04:04,000
it's really powerful.

80
0:04:05.345,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So someone who says they hate immigrants,

81
0:04:08.224,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I try to imagine how scared they must be

82
0:04:10.687,000 --> 0:04:13,000
that their community is changing from what they've always known.

83
0:04:13.759,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Or someone who says they don't like teachers' unions,

84
0:04:17.237,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I bet they're really devastated to see their kid's school going into the gutter,

85
0:04:21.031,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and they're just looking for someone to blame.

86
0:04:23.879,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Our challenge is to find the compassion for others

87
0:04:28.13,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that we want them to have for us.

88
0:04:30.69,000 --> 0:04:32,000
That is emotional correctness.

89
0:04:33.737,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I'm not saying it's easy.

90
0:04:35.267,000 --> 0:04:38,000
An average of, like, 5.6 times per day

91
0:04:38.341,000 --> 0:04:4,000
I have to stop myself from responding to all of my hate mail

92
0:04:41.183,000 --> 0:04:43,000
with a flurry of vile profanities.

93
0:04:43.949,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This whole finding compassion and common ground with your enemies thing

94
0:04:50.172,000 --> 0:04:53,000
is kind of like a political-spiritual practice for me,

95
0:04:53.584,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and I ain't the Dalai Lama.

96
0:04:56.516,000 --> 0:05:,000
I'm not perfect, but what I am is optimistic.

97
0:05:02.381,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Because I don't just get hate mail.

98
0:05:04.791,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I get a lot of really nice letters, lots of them.

99
0:05:08.039,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And one of my all-time favorites begins:

100
0:05:10.601,000 --> 0:05:12,000
"I am not a big fan of your political leanings

101
0:05:13.294,000 --> 0:05:14,000
or your sometimes tortured logic,

102
0:05:15.569,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Laughter)

103
0:05:19.222,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but I'm a big fan of you as a person."

104
0:05:22.611,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Now this guy doesn't agree with me -- yet.

105
0:05:25.94,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:29.456,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But he's listening --

107
0:05:31.719,000 --> 0:05:34,000
not because of what I said, but because of how I said it.

108
0:05:35.084,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And somehow, even though we've never met, we've managed to form a connection.

109
0:05:39.083,000 --> 0:05:4,000
That's emotional correctness,

110
0:05:41.313,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and that's how we start the conversations

111
0:05:44.102,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that really lead to change.

112
0:05:45.962,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Thank you.

113
0:05:47.14,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Applause)

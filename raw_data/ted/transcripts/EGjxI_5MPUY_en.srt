0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The brilliant playwright, Adrienne Kennedy,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
wrote a volume called

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
"People Who Led to My Plays."

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And if I were to write a volume,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
it would be called,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"Artists Who Have Led My Exhibitions"

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
because my work,

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
in understanding art and in understanding culture,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
has come by following artists,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
by looking at what artists mean

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and what they do and who they are.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
J.J. from "Good Times,"

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Applause)

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
significant to many people of course

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
because of "Dy-no-mite,"

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but perhaps more significant

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
as the first, really, black artist

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
on primetime TV.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Jean-Michel Basquiat,

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
important to me because [he was]

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the first black artist in real time

22
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that showed me the possibility of

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
who and what I was about to enter into.

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
My overall project is about art --

25
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
specifically, about black artists --

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
very generally

27
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
about the way in which art

28
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
can change the way we think

29
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
about culture and ourselves.

30
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
My interest is in artists

31
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
who understand and rewrite history,

32
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
who think about themselves

33
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
within the narrative

34
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of the larger world of art,

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
but who have created new places

36
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
for us to see and understand.

37
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I'm showing two artists here, Glenn Ligon and Kara Walker,

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
two of many who really form for me

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the essential questions that I wanted to bring

40
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
as a curator to the world.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I was interested in the idea

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of why and how

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I could create a new story,

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
a new narrative in art history

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and a new narrative in the world.

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And to do this, I knew

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that I had to see the way in which artists work,

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
understand the artist's studio

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
as a laboratory,

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
imagine, then,

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
reinventing the museum as a think tank

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and looking at the exhibition

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
as the ultimate white paper -- asking questions,

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
providing the space

55
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to look and to think about answers.

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
In 1994,

57
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
when I was a curator at the Whitney Museum,

58
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I made an exhibition called Black Male.

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It looked at the intersection

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
of race and gender

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in contemporary American art.

62
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It sought to express

63
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the ways in which art

64
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
could provide a space for dialogue --

65
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
complicated dialogue,

66
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
dialogue with many, many points of entry --

67
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and how the museum could be the space

68
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
for this contest of ideas.

69
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
This exhibition included

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
over 20 artists

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
of various ages and races,

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but all looking at black masculinity

73
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
from a very particular point of view.

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
What was significant about this exhibition

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
is the way in which

76
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
it engaged me in my role

77
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
as a curator, as a catalyst,

78
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
for this dialogue.

79
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
One of the things that happened

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
very distinctly in the course of this exhibition

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
is I was confronted with the idea

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of how powerful images can be

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in people's understanding of themselves and each other.

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I'm showing you two works, one on the right by Leon Golub,

85
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
one on the left by Robert Colescott.

86
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And in the course of the exhibition --

87
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
which was contentious, controversial

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and ultimately, for me,

89
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
life-changing

90
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in my sense of what art could be --

91
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a woman came up to me on the gallery floor

92
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to express her concern about the nature

93
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
of how powerful images could be

94
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and how we understood each other.

95
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And she pointed to the work on the left

96
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to tell me how problematic this image was,

97
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
as it related, for her, to the idea of

98
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
how black people had been represented.

99
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And she pointed to the image on the right

100
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
as an example, to me, of the kind of dignity

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that needed to be portrayed

102
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to work against those images in the media.

103
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
She then assigned these works racial identities,

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
basically saying to me that the work on the right,

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
clearly, was made by a black artist,

106
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
the work on the left, clearly, by a white artist,

107
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
when, in effect,

108
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that was the opposite case:

109
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Bob Colescott, African-American artist;

110
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Leon Golub, a white artist.

111
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The point of that for me was

112
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to say -- in that space, in that moment --

113
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
that I really, more than anything,

114
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
wanted to understand

115
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
how images could work, how images did work,

116
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and how artists provided

117
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
a space bigger than one

118
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that we could imagine in our day-to-day lives

119
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to work through these images.

120
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Fast-forward and I end up in Harlem;

121
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
home for many of black America,

122
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
very much the psychic heart

123
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of the black experience,

124
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
really the place where the Harlem Renaissance existed.

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Harlem now, sort of explaining

126
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and thinking of itself in this part of the century,

127
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
looking both backwards and forwards ...

128
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I always say Harlem is an interesting community

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
because, unlike many other places,

130
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
it thinks of itself in the past, present

131
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and the future simultaneously;

132
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
no one speaks of it just in the now.

133
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's always what it was and what it can be.

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And, in thinking about that,

135
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
then my second project, the second question I ask is:

136
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Can a museum

137
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
be a catalyst in a community?

138
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Can a museum house artists

139
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and allow them to be change agents

140
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
as communities rethink themselves?

141
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This is Harlem, actually, on January 20th,

142
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
thinking about itself in a very wonderful way.

143
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So I work now at The Studio Museum in Harlem,

144
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
thinking about exhibitions there,

145
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
thinking about what it means to

146
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
discover art's possibility.

147
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Now, what does this mean to some of you?

148
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
In some cases, I know that many of you

149
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
are involved in cross-cultural dialogues,

150
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you're involved in ideas of creativity and innovation.

151
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Think about the place that artists can play in that --

152
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that is the kind of incubation and advocacy

153
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that I work towards, in working with young, black artists.

154
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Think about artists, not as content providers,

155
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
though they can be brilliant at that,

156
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but, again, as real catalysts.

157
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The Studio Museum was founded in the late 60s.

158
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And I bring this up because it's important to locate

159
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
this practice in history.

160
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
To look at 1968,

161
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in the incredible historic moment that it is,

162
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and think of the arc that has happened since then,

163
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to think of the possibilities that we are all

164
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
privileged to stand in today

165
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and imagine that this museum

166
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that came out of a moment of great protest

167
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and one that was so much about

168
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
examining the history and the legacy

169
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
of important African-American artists

170
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to the history of art in this country

171
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
like Jacob Lawrence, Norman Lewis,

172
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Romare Bearden.

173
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And then, of course,

174
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to bring us to today.

175
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
In 1975, Muhammad Ali

176
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
gave a lecture at Harvard University.

177
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
After his lecture, a student got up and said to him,

178
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"Give us a poem."

179
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And Mohammed Ali said, "Me, we."

180
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
A profound statement about the individual and the community.

181
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
The space in which now,

182
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
in my project of discovery, of thinking about artists,

183
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
of trying to define

184
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
what might be

185
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
black art cultural movement of the 21st century.

186
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
What that might mean

187
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
for cultural movements all over this moment,

188
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the "me, we" seems

189
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
incredibly prescient

190
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
totally important.

191
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
To this end,

192
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
the specific project that has made this possible for me

193
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is a series of exhibitions,

194
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
all titled with an F --

195
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Freestyle, Frequency and Flow --

196
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
which have set out to discover

197
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and define

198
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the young, black artists working in this moment

199
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
who I feel strongly

200
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
will continue to work over the next many years.

201
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
This series of exhibitions

202
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
was made specifically

203
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to try and question

204
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
the idea of what it would mean

205
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
now, at this point in history,

206
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to see art as a catalyst;

207
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
what it means now, at this point in history,

208
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
as we define and redefine culture,

209
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
black culture specifically in my case,

210
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
but culture generally.

211
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I named this group of artists

212
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
around an idea, which I put out there

213
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
called post-black,

214
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
really meant to define them

215
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
as artists who came and start their work now,

216
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
looking back at history but start in this moment, historically.

217
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
It is really in this sense of discovery

218
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that I have a new set of questions that I'm asking.

219
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This new set of questions is:

220
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
What does it mean, right now,

221
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to be African-American in America?

222
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
What can artwork say about this?

223
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Where can a museum exist

224
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
as the place for us all

225
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to have this conversation?

226
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Really, most exciting about this

227
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
is thinking about the energy and the excitement

228
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
that young artists can bring.

229
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Their works for me are about,

230
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
not always just simply

231
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
about the aesthetic innovation

232
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that their minds imagine, that their visions create

233
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and put out there in the world,

234
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but more, perhaps, importantly,

235
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
through the excitement of the community

236
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that they create as important voices

237
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that would allow us right now to understand our situation,

238
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
as well as in the future.

239
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I am continually amazed

240
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
by the way in which

241
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
the subject of race

242
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
can take itself in many places

243
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that we don't imagine it should be.

244
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
I am always amazed

245
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
by the way in which artists are willing

246
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to do that in their work.

247
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
It is why I look to art.

248
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It's why I ask questions of art.

249
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
It is why I make exhibitions.

250
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Now, this exhibition, as I said,

251
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
40 young artists done over the course of eight years,

252
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and for me it's about considering the implications.

253
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It's considering the implications of

254
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
what this generation has to say to the rest of us.

255
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It's considering what it means for these artists

256
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to be both out in the world as their work travels,

257
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
but in their communities

258
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
as people who are seeing and thinking

259
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
about the issues that face us.

260
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's also about thinking about

261
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
the creative spirit and nurturing it,

262
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and imagining, particularly in urban America,

263
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
about the nurturing of the spirit.

264
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Now, where, perhaps, does this end up right now?

265
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
For me, it is about re-imagining

266
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
this cultural discourse in an international context.

267
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So the last iteration of this project

268
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
has been called Flow,

269
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
with the idea now of creating

270
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
a real network

271
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
of artists around the world;

272
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
really looking, not so much

273
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
from Harlem and out, but looking across,

274
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and Flow looked at artists all born on the continent of Africa.

275
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
And as many of us think about that continent

276
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and think about what if means

277
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to us all in the 21st century,

278
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I have begun that looking

279
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
through artists, through artworks,

280
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and imagining what they can tell us about the future,

281
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
what they tell us about our future,

282
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and what they create in their sense of

283
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
offering us this great possibility of watching

284
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that continent emerge as part

285
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
of our bigger dialogue.

286
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So, what do I discover

287
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
when I look at artworks?

288
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
What do I think about

289
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
when I think about art?

290
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I feel like the privilege I've had as a curator

291
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
is not just the discovery of new works,

292
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
the discovery of exciting works.

293
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But, really, it has been

294
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
what I've discovered about myself

295
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
and what I can offer

296
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
in the space of an exhibition,

297
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
to talk about beauty, to talk about power,

298
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
to talk about ourselves,

299
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and to talk and speak to each other.

300
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
That's what makes me get up every day

301
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and want to think about

302
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
this generation of black artists and artists around the world.

303
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:13.207,000 --> 0:00:14,000
No other organ,

2
0:00:14.977,000 --> 0:00:17,000
perhaps no other object in human life,

3
0:00:18.654,000 --> 0:00:22,000
is as imbued with metaphor and meaning as the human heart.

4
0:00:23.347,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Over the course of history,

5
0:00:24.782,000 --> 0:00:27,000
the heart has been a symbol of our emotional lives.

6
0:00:28.52,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It was considered by many to be the seat of the soul,

7
0:00:32.846,000 --> 0:00:34,000
the repository of the emotions.

8
0:00:35.278,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The very word "emotion" stems in part from the French verb "émouvoir,"

9
0:00:42.076,000 --> 0:00:43,000
meaning "to stir up."

10
0:00:44.028,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And perhaps it's only logical that emotions would be linked to an organ

11
0:00:48.54,000 --> 0:00:5,000
characterized by its agitated movement.

12
0:00:51.511,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But what is this link?

13
0:00:53.492,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Is it real or purely metaphorical?

14
0:00:57.426,000 --> 0:00:58,000
As a heart specialist,

15
0:00:59.421,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I am here today to tell you that this link is very real.

16
0:01:05.391,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Emotions, you will learn,

17
0:01:07.489,000 --> 0:01:12,000
can and do have a direct physical effect on the human heart.

18
0:01:14.446,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But before we get into this,

19
0:01:15.846,000 --> 0:01:17,000
let's talk a bit about the metaphorical heart.

20
0:01:18.879,000 --> 0:01:22,000
The symbolism of the emotional heart endures even today.

21
0:01:23.415,000 --> 0:01:28,000
If we ask people which image they most associate with love,

22
0:01:28.661,000 --> 0:01:32,000
there's no question that the Valentine heart would the top the list.

23
0:01:33.614,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The heart shape, called a cardioid,

24
0:01:36.645,000 --> 0:01:37,000
is common in nature.

25
0:01:38.55,000 --> 0:01:42,000
It's found in the leaves, flowers and seeds of many plants,

26
0:01:43.487,000 --> 0:01:44,000
including silphium,

27
0:01:45.453,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which was used for birth control in the Middle Ages

28
0:01:48.711,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and perhaps is the reason why the heart became associated

29
0:01:52.056,000 --> 0:01:54,000
with sex and romantic love.

30
0:01:55.708,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Whatever the reason,

31
0:01:57.116,000 --> 0:02:01,000
hearts began to appear in paintings of lovers in the 13th century.

32
0:02:02.479,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Over time, the pictures came to be colored red,

33
0:02:06.22,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the color of blood,

34
0:02:08.086,000 --> 0:02:09,000
a symbol of passion.

35
0:02:09.969,000 --> 0:02:1,000
In the Roman Catholic Church,

36
0:02:11.883,000 --> 0:02:15,000
the heart shape became known as the Sacred Heart of Jesus.

37
0:02:16.559,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Adorned with thorns and emitting ethereal light,

38
0:02:20.369,000 --> 0:02:23,000
it became an insignia of monastic love.

39
0:02:24.039,000 --> 0:02:28,000
This association between the heart and love has withstood modernity.

40
0:02:28.944,000 --> 0:02:33,000
When Barney Clark, a retired dentist with end-stage heart failure,

41
0:02:34.137,000 --> 0:02:39,000
received the first permanent artificial heart in Utah in 1982,

42
0:02:39.996,000 --> 0:02:43,000
his wife of 39 years reportedly asked the doctors,

43
0:02:45.78,000 --> 0:02:46,000
"Will he still be able to love me?"

44
0:02:48.715,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Today, we know that the heart is not the source of love

45
0:02:52.199,000 --> 0:02:54,000
or the other emotions, per se;

46
0:02:54.227,000 --> 0:02:55,000
the ancients were mistaken.

47
0:02:55.907,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And yet, more and more, we have come to understand

48
0:02:58.518,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that the connection between the heart and the emotions is a highly intimate one.

49
0:03:03.343,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The heart may not originate our feelings,

50
0:03:06.03,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but it is highly responsive to them.

51
0:03:08.148,000 --> 0:03:1,000
In a sense, a record of our emotional life

52
0:03:11.074,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is written on our hearts.

53
0:03:13.909,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Fear and grief, for example, can cause profound cardiac injury.

54
0:03:18.735,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The nerves that control unconscious processes such as the heartbeat

55
0:03:23.21,000 --> 0:03:24,000
can sense distress

56
0:03:25.056,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and trigger a maladaptive fight-or-flight response

57
0:03:30.018,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that triggers blood vessels to constrict,

58
0:03:33.53,000 --> 0:03:34,000
the heart to gallop

59
0:03:35.284,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and blood pressure to rise,

60
0:03:37.889,000 --> 0:03:38,000
resulting in damage.

61
0:03:39.667,000 --> 0:03:4,000
In other words,

62
0:03:41.452,000 --> 0:03:43,000
it is increasingly clear

63
0:03:44.116,000 --> 0:03:49,000
that our hearts are extraordinarily sensitive to our emotional system,

64
0:03:49.186,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to the metaphorical heart, if you will.

65
0:03:52.472,000 --> 0:03:56,000
There is a heart disorder first recognized about two decades ago

66
0:03:56.944,000 --> 0:04:,000
called "takotsubo cardiomyopathy," or "the broken heart syndrome,"

67
0:04:01.89,000 --> 0:04:07,000
in which the heart acutely weakens in response to intense stress or grief,

68
0:04:08.006,000 --> 0:04:11,000
such as after a romantic breakup or the death of a loved one.

69
0:04:11.912,000 --> 0:04:14,000
As these pictures show, the grieving heart in the middle

70
0:04:15.627,000 --> 0:04:18,000
looks very different than the normal heart on the left.

71
0:04:18.847,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It appears stunned

72
0:04:20.18,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and frequently balloons into the distinctive shape of a takotsubo,

73
0:04:24.62,000 --> 0:04:25,000
shown on the right,

74
0:04:25.816,000 --> 0:04:29,000
a Japanese pot with a wide base and a narrow neck.

75
0:04:29.981,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We don't know exactly why this happens,

76
0:04:32.889,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and the syndrome usually resolves within a few weeks.

77
0:04:35.515,000 --> 0:04:36,000
However, in the acute period,

78
0:04:37.513,000 --> 0:04:39,000
it can cause heart failure,

79
0:04:40.31,000 --> 0:04:41,000
life-threatening arrhythmias,

80
0:04:42.291,000 --> 0:04:43,000
even death.

81
0:04:43.678,000 --> 0:04:48,000
For example, the husband of an elderly patient of mine

82
0:04:49.11,000 --> 0:04:5,000
had died recently.

83
0:04:51.362,000 --> 0:04:54,000
She was sad, of course, but accepting.

84
0:04:55.568,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Maybe even a bit relieved.

85
0:04:57.472,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It had been a very long illness; he'd had dementia.

86
0:05:00.114,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But a week after the funeral, she looked at his picture

87
0:05:04.481,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and became tearful.

88
0:05:06.811,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And then she developed chest pain, and with it, came shortness of breath,

89
0:05:11.909,000 --> 0:05:14,000
distended neck veins, a sweaty brow,

90
0:05:14.939,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a noticeable panting as she was sitting up in a chair --

91
0:05:18.305,000 --> 0:05:21,000
all signs of heart failure.

92
0:05:23.27,000 --> 0:05:25,000
She was admitted to the hospital,

93
0:05:25.518,000 --> 0:05:29,000
where an ultrasound confirmed what we already suspected:

94
0:05:29.613,000 --> 0:05:35,000
her heart had weakened to less than half its normal capacity

95
0:05:36.061,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and had ballooned into the distinctive shape of a takotsubo.

96
0:05:40.527,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But no other tests were amiss,

97
0:05:43.018,000 --> 0:05:45,000
no sign of clogged arteries anywhere.

98
0:05:46.4,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Two weeks later, her emotional state had returned to normal

99
0:05:50.816,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and so, an ultrasound confirmed,

100
0:05:55.063,000 --> 0:05:56,000
had her heart.

101
0:05:56.978,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been linked to many stressful situations,

102
0:06:02.931,000 --> 0:06:03,000
including public speaking --

103
0:06:05.029,000 --> 0:06:07,000
(Laughter)

104
0:06:10.772,000 --> 0:06:14,000
(Applause)

105
0:06:16.952,000 --> 0:06:19,000
domestic disputes, gambling losses,

106
0:06:20.064,000 --> 0:06:22,000
even a surprise birthday party.

107
0:06:22.229,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Laughter)

108
0:06:23.845,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It's even been associated with widespread social upheaval,

109
0:06:28.438,000 --> 0:06:3,000
such as after a natural disaster.

110
0:06:30.622,000 --> 0:06:32,000
For example, in 2004,

111
0:06:32.952,000 --> 0:06:37,000
a massive earthquake devastated a district on the largest island in Japan.

112
0:06:39.154,000 --> 0:06:42,000
More than 60 people were killed, and thousands were injured.

113
0:06:43.422,000 --> 0:06:45,000
On the heels of this catastrophe,

114
0:06:45.562,000 --> 0:06:5,000
researchers found that the incidents of takotsubo cardiomyopathy

115
0:06:50.623,000 --> 0:06:55,000
increased twenty-four-fold in the district one month after the earthquake,

116
0:06:56.271,000 --> 0:06:58,000
compared to a similar period the year before.

117
0:07:00.131,000 --> 0:07:02,000
The residences of these cases

118
0:07:02.81,000 --> 0:07:04,000
closely correlated with the intensity of the tremor.

119
0:07:05.805,000 --> 0:07:09,000
In almost every case, patients lived near the epicenter.

120
0:07:10.902,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Interestingly, takotsubo cardiomyopathy has been seen after a happy event, too,

121
0:07:17.137,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but the heart appears to react differently,

122
0:07:19.867,000 --> 0:07:22,000
ballooning in the midportion, for example, and not at the apex.

123
0:07:24.382,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Why different emotional precipitants would result in different cardiac changes

124
0:07:29.643,000 --> 0:07:3,000
remains a mystery.

125
0:07:31.567,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But today, perhaps as an ode to our ancient philosophers,

126
0:07:36.409,000 --> 0:07:42,000
we can say that even if emotions are not contained inside our hearts,

127
0:07:42.486,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the emotional heart overlaps

128
0:07:48.696,000 --> 0:07:5,000
its biological counterpart,

129
0:07:50.997,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in surprising and mysterious ways.

130
0:07:54.948,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Heart syndromes, including sudden death,

131
0:07:58.653,000 --> 0:08:03,000
have long been reported in individuals experiencing intense emotional disturbance

132
0:08:03.749,000 --> 0:08:05,000
or turmoil in their metaphorical hearts.

133
0:08:07.235,000 --> 0:08:08,000
In 1942,

134
0:08:09.06,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the Harvard physiologist Walter Cannon published a paper called "'Voodoo' Death,"

135
0:08:14.233,000 --> 0:08:17,000
in which he described cases of death from fright

136
0:08:18.011,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in people who believed they had been cursed,

137
0:08:20.456,000 --> 0:08:24,000
such as by a witch doctor or as a consequence of eating taboo fruit.

138
0:08:25.316,000 --> 0:08:29,000
In many cases, the victim, all hope lost, dropped dead on the spot.

139
0:08:31.139,000 --> 0:08:35,000
What these cases had in common was the victim's absolute belief

140
0:08:36.079,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that there was an external force that could cause their demise,

141
0:08:39.142,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and against which they were powerless to fight.

142
0:08:41.92,000 --> 0:08:44,000
This perceived lack of control, Cannon postulated,

143
0:08:45.554,000 --> 0:08:48,000
resulted in an unmitigated physiological response,

144
0:08:48.883,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in which blood vessels constricted to such a degree

145
0:08:53.512,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that blood volume acutely dropped,

146
0:08:56.746,000 --> 0:08:57,000
blood pressure plummeted,

147
0:08:58.411,000 --> 0:08:59,000
the heart acutely weakened,

148
0:09:00.012,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and massive organ damage resulted from a lack of transported oxygen.

149
0:09:05.853,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Cannon believed that voodoo deaths

150
0:09:09.017,000 --> 0:09:12,000
were limited to indigenous or "primitive" people.

151
0:09:13.511,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But over the years, these types of deaths have been shown to occur

152
0:09:18.386,000 --> 0:09:2,000
in all manner of modern people, too.

153
0:09:21.642,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Today, death by grief has been seen in spouses and in siblings.

154
0:09:28.217,000 --> 0:09:32,000
Broken hearts are literally and figuratively deadly.

155
0:09:32.855,000 --> 0:09:34,000
These associations hold true even for animals.

156
0:09:36.781,000 --> 0:09:42,000
In a fascinating study in 1980 published in the journal "Science,"

157
0:09:42.951,000 --> 0:09:45,000
researchers fed caged rabbits a high-cholesterol diet

158
0:09:46.829,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to study its effect on cardiovascular disease.

159
0:09:50.624,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Surprisingly, they found that some rabbits developed a lot more disease than others,

160
0:09:56.161,000 --> 0:09:57,000
but they couldn't explain why.

161
0:09:57.804,000 --> 0:10:02,000
The rabbits had very similar diet, environment and genetic makeup.

162
0:10:03.583,000 --> 0:10:05,000
They thought it might have something to do with

163
0:10:06.227,000 --> 0:10:1,000
how frequently the technician interacted with the rabbits.

164
0:10:10.422,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So they repeated the study,

165
0:10:12.213,000 --> 0:10:14,000
dividing the rabbits into two groups.

166
0:10:14.594,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Both groups were fed a high-cholesterol diet.

167
0:10:17.88,000 --> 0:10:21,000
But in one group, the rabbits were removed from their cages,

168
0:10:22.13,000 --> 0:10:26,000
held, petted, talked to, played with,

169
0:10:26.454,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and in the other group, the rabbits remained in their cages

170
0:10:29.307,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and were left alone.

171
0:10:31.249,000 --> 0:10:34,000
At one year, on autopsy,

172
0:10:34.679,000 --> 0:10:39,000
the researchers found that the rabbits in the first group,

173
0:10:40.197,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that received human interaction,

174
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
had 60 percent less aortic disease than rabbits in the other group,

175
0:10:48.364,000 --> 0:10:53,000
despite having similar cholesterol levels, blood pressure and heart rate.

176
0:10:53.704,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Today, the care of the heart has become less the province of philosophers,

177
0:10:59.854,000 --> 0:11:03,000
who dwell upon the heart's metaphorical meanings,

178
0:11:04.828,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and more the domain of doctors like me,

179
0:11:08.533,000 --> 0:11:1,000
wielding technologies that even a century ago,

180
0:11:11.38,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because of the heart's exalted status in human culture,

181
0:11:14.501,000 --> 0:11:15,000
were considered taboo.

182
0:11:16.225,000 --> 0:11:2,000
In the process, the heart has been transformed

183
0:11:20.484,000 --> 0:11:25,000
from an almost supernatural object imbued with metaphor and meaning

184
0:11:25.596,000 --> 0:11:29,000
into a machine that can be manipulated and controlled.

185
0:11:31.04,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But this is the key point:

186
0:11:33.383,000 --> 0:11:36,000
these manipulations, we now understand,

187
0:11:36.568,000 --> 0:11:4,000
must be complemented by attention to the emotional life

188
0:11:41.51,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that the heart, for thousands of years, was believed to contain.

189
0:11:45.836,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Consider, for example, the Lifestyle Heart Trial,

190
0:11:49.357,000 --> 0:11:53,000
published in the British journal "The Lancet" in 1990.

191
0:11:53.885,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Forty-eight patients with moderate or severe coronary disease

192
0:11:57.952,000 --> 0:11:59,000
were randomly assigned to usual care

193
0:12:00.719,000 --> 0:12:05,000
or an intensive lifestyle that included a low-fat vegetarian diet,

194
0:12:06.186,000 --> 0:12:07,000
moderate aerobic exercise,

195
0:12:08.059,000 --> 0:12:09,000
group psychosocial support

196
0:12:09.654,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and stress management advice.

197
0:12:11.629,000 --> 0:12:15,000
The researchers found that the lifestyle patients

198
0:12:16.399,000 --> 0:12:21,000
had a nearly five percent reduction in coronary plaque.

199
0:12:21.557,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Control patients, on the other hand,

200
0:12:23.596,000 --> 0:12:27,000
had five percent more coronary plaque at one year

201
0:12:28.09,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and 28 percent more at five years.

202
0:12:30.527,000 --> 0:12:34,000
They also had nearly double the rate of cardiac events,

203
0:12:34.938,000 --> 0:12:37,000
like heart attacks, coronary bypass surgery

204
0:12:38.341,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and cardiac-related deaths.

205
0:12:40.249,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Now, here's an interesting fact:

206
0:12:42.719,000 --> 0:12:47,000
some patients in the control group adopted diet and exercise plans

207
0:12:48.037,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that were nearly as intense as those in the intensive lifestyle group.

208
0:12:53.203,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Their heart disease still progressed.

209
0:12:56.9,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Diet and exercise alone were not enough to facilitate coronary disease regression.

210
0:13:02.738,000 --> 0:13:04,000
At both one- and five-year follow-ups,

211
0:13:06.526,000 --> 0:13:08,000
stress management was more strongly correlated

212
0:13:09.519,000 --> 0:13:11,000
with reversal of coronary disease

213
0:13:11.595,000 --> 0:13:12,000
than exercise was.

214
0:13:14.001,000 --> 0:13:17,000
No doubt, this and similar studies are small,

215
0:13:17.642,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and, of course, correlation does not prove causation.

216
0:13:20.847,000 --> 0:13:24,000
It's certainly possible that stress leads to unhealthy habits,

217
0:13:25.229,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and that's the real reason for the increased cardiovascular risk.

218
0:13:28.532,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But as with the association of smoking and lung cancer,

219
0:13:32.157,000 --> 0:13:35,000
when so many studies show the same thing,

220
0:13:35.438,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and when there are mechanisms to explain a causal relationship,

221
0:13:38.872,000 --> 0:13:42,000
it seems capricious to deny that one probably exists.

222
0:13:43.798,000 --> 0:13:46,000
What many doctors have concluded is what I, too, have learned

223
0:13:47.501,000 --> 0:13:49,000
in my nearly two decades as a heart specialist:

224
0:13:51.033,000 --> 0:13:55,000
the emotional heart intersects with its biological counterpart

225
0:13:55.465,000 --> 0:13:57,000
in surprising and mysterious ways.

226
0:13:58.045,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And yet, medicine today continues to conceptualize the heart as a machine.

227
0:14:03.312,000 --> 0:14:06,000
This conceptualization has had great benefits.

228
0:14:07.027,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Cardiology, my field,

229
0:14:09.609,000 --> 0:14:13,000
is undoubtedly one of the greatest scientific success stories

230
0:14:14.271,000 --> 0:14:15,000
of the past 100 years.

231
0:14:17.17,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Stents, pacemakers, defibrillators, coronary bypass surgery,

232
0:14:22.842,000 --> 0:14:23,000
heart transplants --

233
0:14:24.186,000 --> 0:14:27,000
all these things were developed or invented after World War II.

234
0:14:28.159,000 --> 0:14:3,000
However, it's possible

235
0:14:30.294,000 --> 0:14:35,000
that we are approaching the limits of what scientific medicine can do

236
0:14:35.604,000 --> 0:14:36,000
to combat heart disease.

237
0:14:37.226,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Indeed, the rate of decline of cardiovascular mortality

238
0:14:40.615,000 --> 0:14:43,000
has slowed significantly in the past decade.

239
0:14:45.312,000 --> 0:14:47,000
We will need to shift to a new paradigm

240
0:14:48.316,000 --> 0:14:51,000
to continue to make the kind of progress to which we have become accustomed.

241
0:14:52.335,000 --> 0:14:57,000
In this paradigm, psychosocial factors will need to be front and center

242
0:14:57.784,000 --> 0:14:59,000
in how we think about heart problems.

243
0:15:00.685,000 --> 0:15:02,000
This is going to be an uphill battle,

244
0:15:02.847,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and it remains a domain that is largely unexplored.

245
0:15:07.956,000 --> 0:15:12,000
The American Heart Association still does not list emotional stress

246
0:15:13.145,000 --> 0:15:16,000
as a key modifiable risk factor for heart disease,

247
0:15:16.96,000 --> 0:15:2,000
perhaps in part because blood cholesterol is so much easier to lower

248
0:15:21.787,000 --> 0:15:23,000
than emotional and social disruption.

249
0:15:25.582,000 --> 0:15:27,000
There is a better way, perhaps,

250
0:15:27.998,000 --> 0:15:31,000
if we recognize that when we say "a broken heart,"

251
0:15:32.899,000 --> 0:15:36,000
we are indeed sometimes talking about a real broken heart.

252
0:15:37.537,000 --> 0:15:43,000
We must, must pay more attention to the power and importance of the emotions

253
0:15:44.003,000 --> 0:15:45,000
in taking care of our hearts.

254
0:15:46.442,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Emotional stress, I have learned,

255
0:15:48.805,000 --> 0:15:5,000
is often a matter of life and death.

256
0:15:53.048,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Thank you.

257
0:15:54.232,000 --> 0:15:59,000

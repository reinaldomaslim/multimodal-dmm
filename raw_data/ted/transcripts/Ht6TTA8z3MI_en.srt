1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Beverly Joubert: We are truly passionate

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
about the African wilderness

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and protecting the African wilderness,

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and so what we've done

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
is we've focused on iconic cats.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And I know,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in the light of human suffering and poverty

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and even climate change,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
one would wonder,

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
why worry about a few cats?

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Well today we're here

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to share with you a message that we have learned

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
from a very important and special character --

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
this leopard.

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Dereck Joubert: Well, our lives have basically been

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
like a super long episode of "CSI" --

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
something like 28 years.

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
In essence, what we've done

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
is we've studied the science, we've looked at the behavior,

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
we've seen over 2,000 kills

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
by these amazing animals.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But one of the things that science really lets us down on

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
is that personality,

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that individual personality that these animals have.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And here's a prime example.

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
We found this leopard in a 2,000-year-old

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
baobab tree in Africa,

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the same tree that we found her mother in

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and her grandmother.

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And she took us on a journey

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and revealed something very special to us --

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
her own daughter, eight days old.

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And the minute we found this leopard,

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we realized that we needed to move in,

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and so we basically stayed with this leopard

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
for the next four-and-a-half years --

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
following her every day,

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
getting to know her,

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that individual personality of hers,

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and really coming to know her.

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Now I'm destined

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
to spend a lot of time

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
with some unique,

44
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
very, very special,

45
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
individualistic

46
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and often seductive female characters.

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Beverly's clearly one of them,

49
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and this little leopard, Legadema, is another,

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and she changed our lives.

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
BJ: Well we certainly did spend a lot of time with her --

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
in fact, more time than even her mother did.

53
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
When her mother would go off hunting,

54
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we would stay and film.

55
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And early on, a lightning bolt hit a tree

56
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
20 paces away from us.

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It was frightening,

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and it showered us with leaves and a pungent smell.

59
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And of course, we were stunned for a while,

60
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but when we managed to get our wits about us,

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
we looked at it and said, "My gosh,

62
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
what's going to happen with that little cub?

63
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
She's probably going to forever associate

64
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that deafening crash with us."

65
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Well, we needn't have worried.

66
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
She came charging out of the thicket straight towards us,

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
sat next to us, shivering,

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
with her back towards Dereck, and looking out.

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And actually from that day on,

70
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
she's been comfortable with us.

71
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
So we felt that that day

72
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
was the day that she really earned her name.

73
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We called her Legadema,

74
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which means, "light from the sky."

75
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
DJ: Now we've found these individualisms

76
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in all sorts of animals,

77
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in particular in the cats.

78
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
This particular one is called Eetwidomayloh,

79
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"he who greets with fire,"

80
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and you can just see that about him, you know -- that's his character.

81
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But only by getting up close to these animals

82
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and spending time with them

83
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
can we actually even reach out

84
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and dig out these personal characters that they have.

85
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
BJ: But through our investigation,

86
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we have to seek the wildest places in Africa.

87
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And right now this is in the Okavango Delta

88
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
in Botswana.

89
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Yes, it is swamp. We live in the swamp in a tent,

90
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but I must tell you, every day is exhilarating.

91
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But also, our hearts are in our throats

92
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
a huge amount of the time,

93
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because we're driving through water,

94
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and it's an unknown territory.

95
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But we're really there

96
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
seeking and searching and filming the iconic cats.

97
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
DJ: Now one of the big things, of course,

98
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
everybody knows that cats hate water,

99
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and so this was a real revelation for us.

100
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And we could only find this by pushing ourselves,

101
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
by going where no sane person should go --

102
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
not without some prompting, by the way, from Beverly --

103
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and just pushing the envelope,

104
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
going out there, pushing our vehicle, pushing ourselves.

105
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But we've managed to find that these lions

106
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
are 15 percent bigger than any others,

107
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and they specialize in hunting buffalo in the water.

108
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
BJ: And then of course, the challenge

109
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is knowing when to turn around.

110
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
We don't always get that right,

111
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and on this particular day,

112
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we seriously underestimated the depth.

113
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
We got deeper and deeper,

114
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
until it was at Dereck's chest-height.

115
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Well then we hit a deep depression,

116
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and we seriously submerged the vehicle.

117
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We actually managed to drown

118
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
two million dollars' worth of camera gear.

119
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We drowned our pride, I must tell you,

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
which was really serious,

121
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and we seized the engine.

122
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
DJ: And of course, one of the rules that we have in the vehicle

123
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is that he who drowns the vehicle

124
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
gets to swim with the crocodiles.

125
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
(Laughter)

126
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
You will notice also that all of these images here

127
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
are taken from the top angle by Beverly --

128
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
the dry top angle, by the way.

129
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But all the places we get stuck in really have great views.

131
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And it wasn't a moment, and these lions came back towards us,

132
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and Beverly was able to get a great photograph.

133
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
BJ: But we truly do

134
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
spend day and night

135
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
trying to capture unique footage.

136
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And 20 years ago,

137
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
we did a film called "Eternal Enemies"

138
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
where we managed to capture

139
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
this unusual disturbing behavior across two species --

140
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
lions and hyenas.

141
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And surprisingly, it became a cult film.

142
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And we can only work that out

143
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
as people were seeing parallels

144
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
between the thuggish side of nature

145
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and gang warfare.

146
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
DJ: It was amazing, because you can see that this lion

147
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
is doing exactly what his name,

148
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Eetwidomayloh, represents.

149
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
He's focused on this hyena,

150
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and he is going to get it.

151
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Animal sounds)

152
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But that's, I think, what this is all about,

153
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is that these individuals have these personalities and characters.

154
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But for us to get them, not only do we push ourselves,

155
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but we live by certain rules of engagement,

156
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
which mean we can't interfere.

157
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
This sort of behavior has been going on

158
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
for three, four, five million years,

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and we can't step in and say, "That's wrong, and that's right."

160
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
But that's not always easy for us.

161
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
BJ: So, as Dereck says,

162
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we have to work through extremes --

163
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
extreme temperatures, push ourselves at night.

164
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Sleep deprivation is extreme.

165
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
We're on the edge

166
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
through a large part of the time.

167
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
But, for 10 years, we tried to capture

168
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
lions and elephants together --

169
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and never ever managed

170
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
until this particular night.

171
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
And I have to tell you

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that it was a disturbing night for me.

173
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I had tears rolling down my cheeks.

174
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I was shaking with anxiety,

175
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
but I knew that [I had] to capture something

176
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that had never been seen before, had never been documented.

177
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And I do believe you should stay with us.

178
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
DJ: The amazing thing about these moments --

179
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and this is probably a highlight of our career --

180
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
is that you never know how it's going to end.

181
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Many people believe, in fact,

182
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that death begins in the eyes, not in the heart,

183
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
not in the lungs,

184
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and that's when people give up hope,

185
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
or when any life form gives up hope.

186
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And you can see the start of it here.

187
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
This elephant, against overwhelming odds,

188
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
simply gives up hope.

189
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But by the same token,

190
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
you can get your hope back again.

191
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
So just when you think it's all over, something else happens,

192
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
some spark gets into you,

193
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
some sort of will to fight --

194
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
that iron will that we all have,

195
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that this elephant has,

196
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that conservation has, that big cats have.

197
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Everything has that will to survive,

198
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
to fight, to push through that mental barrier

199
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and to keep going.

200
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And for us, in many ways,

201
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
this elephant has become

202
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
a symbol of inspiration for us,

203
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work.

204
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Applause)

205
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Now back to the leopard.

206
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We were spending so much time with this leopard

207
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and getting to understand her individualism,

208
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
her personal character,

209
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that maybe we were taking it a little bit far.

210
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
We were perhaps taking her for granted,

211
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and maybe she didn't like that that much.

212
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
This is about couples working together,

213
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and so I do need to say that within the vehicle

214
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we have quite strict territories, Beverly and I.

215
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Beverly sits on the one side

216
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
where all her camera gear is,

217
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and I'm on the other side where my space is.

218
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
These are precious to us, these divides.

219
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
BJ: But when this little cub saw

220
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that I had vacated my seat

221
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and climbed to the back to get some camera gear,

222
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
she came in like a curious cat

223
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to come and investigate.

224
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It was phenomenal, and we felt grateful

225
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
that she trusted us to that extent.

226
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But at the same time, we were concerned

227
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that if she created this as a habit

228
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and jumped into somebody else's car,

229
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
it might not turn out the same way --

230
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
she might get shot for that.

231
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
So we knew we had to react quickly.

232
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And the only way we thought we could

233
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
without scaring her

234
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is to try and simulate a growl like her mother would make --

235
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
a hiss and a sound.

236
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So Dereck turned on the heater fan in the car --

237
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
very innovative.

238
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
DJ: It was the only way for me to save the marriage,

239
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
because Beverly felt she was being replaced, you see.

240
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
(Laughter)

241
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But really and truly, this was how

242
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
this little leopard was displaying

243
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
her individual personality.

244
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But nothing prepared us

245
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
for what happened next in our relationship with her,

246
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
when she started hunting.

247
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
BJ: And on this first hunt, we truly were excited.

248
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It was like watching a graduation ceremony.

249
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
We felt like we were surrogate parents.

250
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And of course, we knew now

251
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that she was going to survive.

252
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
But only when we saw the tiny baby baboon

253
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
clinging to the mother's fur

254
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
did we realize that something very unique

255
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
was taking place here with Legadema.

256
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And of course, the baby baboon was so innocent,

257
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
it didn't turn and run.

258
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So what we watched

259
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
over the next couple of hours

260
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
was very unique.

261
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It was absolutely amazing

262
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
when she picked it up to safety,

263
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
protecting it from the hyena.

264
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And over the next five hours,

265
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
she took care of it.

266
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We realized that we actually don't know everything,

267
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and that nature is so unpredictable,

268
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
we have to be open at all times.

269
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
DJ: Okay, so she was a little bit rough.

270
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
(Laughter)

271
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But in fact,

272
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
what we were seeing here was interesting.

273
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Because she is a cub wanting to play,

274
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but she was also a predator needing to kill,

275
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and yet conflicted in some way,

276
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
because she was also an emerging mother.

277
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
She had this maternal instinct,

278
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
much like a young girl on her way to womanhood,

279
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and so this really took us to this new level

280
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
of understanding that personality.

281
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
BJ: And of course, through the night, they lay together.

282
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
They ended up sleeping for hours.

283
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
But I have to tell you --

284
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
everybody always asks, "What happened to the baby baboon?"

285
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
It did die,

286
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and we suspect it was from the freezing winter nights.

287
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
DJ: So at this stage, I guess,

288
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
we had very, very firm ideas

289
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
on what conservation meant.

290
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
We had to deal with these individual personalities.

291
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
We had to deal with them with respect

292
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and celebrate them.

293
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And so we, with the National Geographic, formed the Big Cats Initiative

294
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
to march forward into conservation,

295
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
taking care of the big cats that we loved --

296
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and then had an opportunity to look back over the last 50 years

297
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to see how well we had all collectively been doing.

298
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So when Beverly and I were born,

299
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
there were 450,000 lions,

300
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
and today there are 20,000.

301
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Tigers haven't fared any better --

302
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
45,000

303
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
down to maybe 3,000.

304
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
BJ: And then cheetahs have crashed

305
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
all the way down to 12,000.

306
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Leopards have plummeted

307
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
from 700,000

308
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
down to a mere 50,000.

309
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Now in the extraordinary time

310
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that we have worked with Legadema --

311
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
which is really over a five-year period --

312
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
10,000 leopards were legally shot

313
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
by safari hunters.

314
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And that's not the only leopards

315
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
that were being killed through that period.

316
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
There's an immense amount of poaching as well,

317
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and so possibly the same amount.

318
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
It's simply not sustainable.

319
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We admire them,

320
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and we fear them,

321
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
and yet, as man, we want to steal their power.

322
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It used to be the time

323
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
where only kings wore a leopard skin,

324
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
but now throughout rituals and ceremonies,

325
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
traditional healers and ministers.

326
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
And of course, looking at this lion paw

327
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that has been skinned,

328
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
it eerily reminds me

329
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
of a human hand,

330
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and that's ironic, because their fate is in our hands.

331
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
DJ: There's a burgeoning bone trade.

332
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
South Africa just released some lion bones onto the market.

333
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Lion bones and tiger bones look exactly the same,

334
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and so in a stroke, the lion bone industry

335
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
is going to wipe out all the tigers.

336
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So we have a real problem here,

337
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
no more so than the lions do, the male lions.

338
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
So the 20,000 lion figure that you just saw

339
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
is actually a red herring,

340
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
because there may be 3,000 or 4,000 male lions,

341
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and they all are actually

342
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
infected with the same disease.

343
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I call it complacency --

344
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
our complacency.

345
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
Because there's a sport, there's an activity going on

346
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that we're all aware of, that we condone.

347
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And that's probably because we haven't seen it

348
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
like we are today.

349
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
BJ: And you have to know

350
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
that, when a male lion is killed,

351
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
it completely disrupts the whole pride.

352
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
A new male comes into the area

353
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and takes over the pride,

354
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
and, of course, first of all kills all the cubs

355
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and possibly some of the females that are defending their cubs.

356
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So we've estimated

357
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
that between 20 [and] 30 lions are killed

358
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
when one lion is hanging on a wall

359
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
somewhere in a far-off place.

360
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
DJ: So what our investigations have shown

361
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
is that these lions are essential.

362
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
They're essential to the habitat.

363
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
If they disappear,

364
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
whole ecosystems in Africa disappear.

365
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
There's an 80-billion-dollar-a-year

366
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
ecotourism revenue stream into Africa.

367
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So this is not just a concern about lions;

368
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
it's a concern about communities in Africa as well.

369
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
If they disappear, all of that goes away.

370
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
But what I'm more concerned about in many ways

371
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
is that, as we de-link ourselves from nature,

372
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
as we de-link ourselves spiritually

373
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
from these animals,

374
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
we lose hope,

375
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
we lose that spiritual connection,

376
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
our dignity, that thing within us

377
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
that keeps us connected to the planet.

378
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
BJ: So you have to know, looking into the eyes

379
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
of lions and leopards right now,

380
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
it is all about critical awareness.

381
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And so what we are doing,

382
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
in February, we're bringing out a film called "The Last Lion,"

383
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and "The Last Lion" is exactly

384
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
what is happening right now.

385
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
That is the situation we're in --

386
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
the last lions.

387
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
That is, if we don't take action and do something,

388
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
these plains will be completely devoid

389
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
of big cats,

390
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and then, in turn, everything else will disappear.

391
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
And simply, if we can't protect them,

392
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
we're going to have a job protecting ourselves as well.

393
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
DJ: And in fact, that original thing that we spoke about

394
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
and designed our lives by --

395
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
that conservation was all about respect

396
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and celebration --

397
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
is probably true. That's really what it needs.

398
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
We need it. We respect and celebrate each other

399
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
as a man and a woman, as a community

400
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and as part of this planet,

401
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and we need to continue that.

402
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And Legadema?

403
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
Well we can report, in fact,

404
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
that we're grandparents.

405
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
(Laughter)

406
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
BJ/DJ: Thank you very much.

407
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Can I ask you to please recall a time

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
when you really loved something --

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a movie, an album, a song or a book --

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and you recommended it wholeheartedly

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
to someone you also really liked,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and you anticipated that reaction, you waited for it,

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and it came back, and the person hated it?

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
So, by way of introduction,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that is the exact same state

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in which I spent every working day of the last six years. (Laughter)

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I teach high school math.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I sell a product to a market

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that doesn't want it, but is forced by law to buy it.

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I mean, it's just a losing proposition.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So there's a useful stereotype about students that I see,

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
a useful stereotype about you all.

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I could give you guys

18
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
an algebra-two final exam,

19
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and I would expect no higher

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
than a 25 percent pass rate.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And both of these facts say less about you or my students

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
than they do about what we call math education

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in the U.S. today.

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
To start with, I'd like to break math down into two categories.

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
One is computation; this is the stuff you've forgotten.

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
For example, factoring quadratics with

27
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
leading coefficients greater than one.

28
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This stuff is also really easy to relearn,

29
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
provided you have a really strong grounding

30
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
in reasoning. Math reasoning --

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
we'll call it the application

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
of math processes to the world around us --

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
this is hard to teach.

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
This is what we would love students to retain,

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
even if they don't go into mathematical fields.

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
This is also something that, the way we teach it in the U.S.

37
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
all but ensures they won't retain it.

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So, I'd like to talk about why that is,

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
why that's such a calamity for society, what we can do about it

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and, to close with, why this is an amazing time

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to be a math teacher.

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So first, five symptoms

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
that you're doing math reasoning wrong

44
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in your classroom.

45
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
One is a lack of initiative; your students don't self-start.

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
You finish your lecture block

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and immediately you have five hands going up

48
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks.

49
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Students lack perseverance.

50
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
They lack retention; you find yourself

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
re-explaining concepts three months later, wholesale.

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
There's an aversion to word problems,

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
which describes 99 percent of my students.

54
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And then the other one percent

55
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is eagerly looking for the formula

56
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to apply in that situation.

57
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This is really destructive.

58
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
David Milch, creator of "Deadwood" and other amazing TV shows,

59
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
has a really good description for this.

60
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
He swore off creating

61
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
contemporary drama,

62
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
shows set in the present day,

63
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
because he saw that when people fill their mind

64
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
with four hours a day of, for example, "Two and a Half Men," no disrespect,

65
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
it shapes the neural pathways, he said,

66
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in such a way that they expect simple problems.

67
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
He called it, "an impatience with irresolution."

68
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
You're impatient with things that don't resolve quickly.

69
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes,

70
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
three commercial breaks and a laugh track.

71
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And I'll put it to all of you,

72
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
what you already know, that no problem worth solving is that simple.

73
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I am very concerned about this

74
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
because I'm going to retire in a world that my students will run.

75
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I'm doing bad things

76
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to my own future and well-being

77
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
when I teach this way.

78
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I'm here to tell you that the way our textbooks -- particularly

79
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
mass-adopted textbooks -- teach math reasoning

80
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and patient problem solving,

81
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
it's functionally equivalent to turning on "Two and a Half Men" and calling it a day.

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
In all seriousness. Here's an example from a physics textbook.

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It applies equally to math.

85
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Notice, first of all here,

86
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that you have exactly three pieces of information there,

87
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
each of which will figure into a formula

88
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
somewhere, eventually,

89
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
which the student will then compute.

90
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I believe in real life.

91
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And ask yourself, what problem have you solved, ever,

92
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that was worth solving

93
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
where you knew all of the given information in advance;

94
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
where you didn't have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out,

95
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
or you didn't have sufficient information

96
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and had to go find some.

97
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I'm sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that.

98
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And the textbook, I think, knows how it's hamstringing students

99
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
because, watch this, this is the practice problem set.

100
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
When it comes time to do the actual problem set,

101
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we have problems like this right here

102
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
where we're just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit.

103
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And if the student still doesn't recognize the stamp this was molded from,

104
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
it helpfully explains to you

105
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
what sample problem you can return to to find the formula.

106
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
You could literally, I mean this,

107
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
pass this particular unit without knowing any physics,

108
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
just knowing how to decode a textbook. That's a shame.

109
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math.

110
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Here's a really cool problem. I like this.

111
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
It's about defining steepness and slope

112
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
using a ski lift.

113
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
But what you have here is actually four separate layers,

114
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and I'm curious which of you can see the four separate layers

115
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and, particularly, how when they're compressed together

116
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and presented to the student all at once,

117
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
how that creates this impatient problem solving.

118
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I'll define them here: You have the visual.

119
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
You also have the mathematical structure,

120
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
talking about grids, measurements, labels,

121
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
points, axes, that sort of thing.

122
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
You have substeps, which all lead to what we really want to talk about:

123
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
which section is the steepest.

124
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So I hope you can see.

125
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I really hope you can see how what we're doing here

126
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is taking a compelling question, a compelling answer,

127
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but we're paving a smooth, straight path

128
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
from one to the other

129
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and congratulating our students for how well

130
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
they can step over the small cracks in the way.

131
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
That's all we're doing here.

132
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way

133
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and build them up with students,

134
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
we can have everything we're looking for in terms of patient problem solving.

135
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So right here I start with the visual,

136
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and I immediately ask the question:

137
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Which section is the steepest?

138
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And this starts conversation

139
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers.

140
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So you get people arguing against each other,

141
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
friend versus friend,

142
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in pairs, journaling, whatever.

143
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And then eventually we realize

144
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
it's getting annoying to talk about

145
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen

146
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
or the skier just above the mid line.

147
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And we realize how great would it be

148
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
if we just had some A, B, C and D labels

149
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to talk about them more easily.

150
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean,

151
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
we realize it would be nice to have some measurements

152
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to really narrow it down, specifically what that means.

153
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And then and only then,

154
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
we throw down that mathematical structure.

155
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The math serves the conversation,

156
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
the conversation doesn't serve the math.

157
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And at that point, I'll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes

158
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
are good to go on the whole slope, steepness thing.

159
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But if you need to,

160
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
your students can then develop those substeps together.

161
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Do you guys see how this, right here, compared to that --

162
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
which one creates that patient problem solving, that math reasoning?

163
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's been obvious in my practice, to me.

164
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And I'll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein,

165
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
who, I believe, has paid his dues.

166
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important,

167
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and yet in my practice, in the U.S. here,

168
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we just give problems to students;

169
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
we don't involve them in the formulation of the problem.

170
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So 90 percent of what I do

171
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
with my five hours of prep time per week

172
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
is to take fairly compelling elements

173
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
of problems like this from my textbook

174
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving.

175
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
And here's how it works.

176
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I like this question. It's about a water tank.

177
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The question is: How long will it take you to fill it up?

178
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
First things first, we eliminate all the substeps.

179
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Students have to develop those,

180
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
they have to formulate those.

181
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you'll need.

182
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
None of it's a distractor, so we lose that.

183
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Students need to decide, "All right, well,

184
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
does the height matter? Does the side of it matter?

185
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Does the color of the valve matter? What matters here?"

186
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum.

187
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So now we have a water tank.

188
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
How long will it take you to fill it up? And that's it.

189
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And because this is the 21st century

190
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms,

191
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
not in terms of line art or clip art

192
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that you so often see in textbooks,

193
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
we go out and we take a picture of it.

194
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So now we have the real deal.

195
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
How long will it take it to fill it up?

196
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And then even better is we take a video,

197
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
a video of someone filling it up.

198
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And it's filling up slowly, agonizingly slowly.

199
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It's tedious.

200
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Students are looking at their watches, rolling their eyes,

201
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and they're all wondering at some point or another,

202
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
"Man, how long is it going to take to fill up?"

203
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Laughter)

204
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
That's how you know you've baited the hook, right?

205
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
And that question, off this right here, is really fun for me

206
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
because, like the intro,

207
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I teach kids -- because of my inexperience --

208
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I teach the kids that are the most remedial, all right?

209
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And I've got kids who will not join a conversation about math

210
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
because someone else has the formula;

211
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
someone else knows how to work the formula better than me,

212
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
so I won't talk about it.

213
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But here, every student is on a level playing field of intuition.

214
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Everyone's filled something up with water before,

215
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
so I get kids answering the question, "How long will it take?"

216
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I've got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated

217
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
joining the conversation.

218
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We put names on the board, attach them to guesses,

219
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and kids have bought in here.

220
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And then we follow the process I've described.

221
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And the best part here, or one of the better parts

222
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
is that we don't get our answer from the answer key

223
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
in the back of the teacher's edition.

224
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
We, instead, just watch the end of the movie.

225
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

226
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And that's terrifying,

227
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
because the theoretical models that always work out

228
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
in the answer key in the back of a teacher's edition,

229
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that's great, but

230
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
it's scary to talk about sources of error

231
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
when the theoretical does not match up with the practical.

232
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But those conversations have been so valuable,

233
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
among the most valuable.

234
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
So I'm here to report some really fun games

235
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
with students who come pre-installed

236
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
with these viruses day one of the class.

237
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
These are the kids who now, one semester in,

238
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I can put something on the board,

239
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
totally new, totally foreign,

240
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and they'll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more

241
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
than they would have at the start of the year,

242
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
which is just so fun.

243
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
We're no longer averse to word problems,

244
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
because we've redefined what a word problem is.

245
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We're no longer intimidated by math,

246
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
because we're slowly redefining what math is.

247
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This has been a lot of fun.

248
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia,

249
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
because it brings the real world into your classroom

250
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in high resolution and full color;

251
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
to encourage student intuition for that level playing field;

252
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to ask the shortest question you possibly can

253
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and let those more specific questions come out in conversation;

254
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to let students build the problem,

255
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
because Einstein said so;

256
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and to finally, in total, just be less helpful,

257
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways:

258
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
It's buying you out of your obligation,

259
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
for patient problem solving and math reasoning, to be less helpful.

260
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now

261
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
is because we have the tools to create

262
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket.

263
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It's ubiquitous and fairly cheap,

264
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and the tools to distribute it

265
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
freely under open licenses

266
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous.

267
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago

268
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and it got 6,000 views in two weeks.

269
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I get emails still from teachers in countries I've never visited

270
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
saying, "Wow, yeah. We had a good conversation about that.

271
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Oh, and by the way, here's how I made your stuff better,"

272
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
which, wow.

273
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I put this problem on my blog recently:

274
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
In a grocery store, which line do you get into,

275
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
the one that has one cart and 19 items

276
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
or the line with four carts and three, five, two and one items.

277
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom,

278
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
but it eventually got me on "Good Morning America" a few weeks later,

279
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
which is just bizarre, right?

280
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And from all of this, I can only conclude

281
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that people, not just students,

282
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
are really hungry for this.

283
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Math makes sense of the world.

284
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Math is the vocabulary

285
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
for your own intuition.

286
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So I just really encourage you, whatever your stake is in education --

287
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
whether you're a student, parent, teacher, policy maker, whatever --

288
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
insist on better math curriculum.

289
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We need more patient problem solvers. Thank you. (Applause)

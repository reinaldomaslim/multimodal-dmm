1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I woke up in the middle of the night

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
with the sound of heavy explosion.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It was deep at night.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I do not remember what time it was.

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I just remember the sound

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
was so heavy

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and so very shocking.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Everything in my room was shaking --

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
my heart, my windows,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
my bed, everything.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I looked out the windows

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and I saw a full half-circle

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of explosion.

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I thought it was just like the movies,

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but the movies had not conveyed them

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in the powerful image that I was seeing

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
full of bright red

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and orange and gray,

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and a full circle of explosion.

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And I kept on staring at it

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
until it disappeared.

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I went back to my bed,

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and I prayed,

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and I secretly thanked God

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that that missile

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
did not land on my family's home,

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that it did not kill my family that night.

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Thirty years have passed,

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and I still feel guilty about that prayer,

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
for the next day, I learned that that missile

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
landed on my brother's friend's home

32
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and killed him

33
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and his father,

34
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but did not kill his mother or his sister.

35
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
His mother showed up the next week

36
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
at my brother's classroom

37
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and begged seven-year-old kids

38
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to share with her any picture they may have

39
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
of her son,

40
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
for she had lost everything.

41
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This is not a story

42
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of a nameless survivor of war,

43
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and nameless refugees,

44
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
whose stereotypical images we see in our newspapers

45
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and our TV

46
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
with tattered clothes,

47
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
dirty face, scared eyes.

48
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
This is not a story of a nameless someone

49
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
who lived in some war,

50
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
who we do not know their hopes, their dreams,

51
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
their accomplishments, their families,

52
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
their beliefs, their values.

53
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This is my story.

54
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I was that girl.

55
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I am another image and vision

56
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
of another survivor of war.

57
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I am that refugee,

58
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and I am that girl.

59
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
You see,

60
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I grew up in war-torn Iraq,

61
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and I believe that there are two sides of wars

62
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and we've only seen

63
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
one side of it.

64
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
We only talk about

65
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
one side of it.

66
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
But there's another side

67
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that I have witnessed

68
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
as someone who lived in it

69
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and someone who ended up working in it.

70
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I grew up with the colors of war --

71
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
the red colors of fire and blood,

72
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the brown tones of earth

73
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
as it explodes

74
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in our faces

75
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and the piercing silver

76
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
of an exploded missile,

77
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
so bright

78
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that nothing can protect your eyes from it.

79
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I grew up

80
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
with the sounds of war --

81
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the staccato sounds of gunfire,

82
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
the wrenching booms of explosions,

83
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
ominous drones of jets flying overhead

84
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and the wailing warning sounds

85
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
of sirens.

86
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
These are the sounds you would expect,

87
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but they are also the sounds

88
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
of dissonant concerts of a flock of birds

89
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
screeching in the night,

90
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the high-pitched honest cries

91
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
of children

92
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and the thunderous,

93
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
unbearable

94
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
silence.

95
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
"War," a friend of mine said,

96
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"is not about sound at all.

97
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It is actually about silence,

98
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the silence of humanity."

99
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I have since left Iraq

100
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and founded a group called Women for Women International

101
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that ends up working

102
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
with women survivors of wars.

103
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
In my travels and in my work,

104
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
from Congo to Afghanistan,

105
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
from Sudan to Rwanda,

106
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I have learned not only

107
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that the colors and the sounds of war are the same,

108
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
but the fears of war are the same.

109
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
You know, there is a fear of dying,

110
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and do not believe any movie character

111
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
where the hero is not afraid.

112
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It is very scary

113
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to go through that feeling

114
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
of "I am about to die"

115
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
or "I could die in this explosion."

116
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But there's also the fear

117
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
of losing loved ones,

118
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and I think that's even worse.

119
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It's too painful. You don't want to think about it.

120
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But I think the worst kind of fear is the fear --

121
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
as Samia, a Bosnian woman, once told me,

122
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
who survived the four-years besiege of Sarajevo;

123
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
she said, "The fear

124
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
of losing

125
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
the 'I' in me,

126
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the fear of losing

127
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the 'I' in me."

128
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
That's what my mother in Iraq

129
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
used to tell me.

130
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's like dying from inside-out.

131
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
A Palestinian woman once told me,

132
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
"It is not about the fear of one death,"

133
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
she said, "sometimes I feel

134
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I die 10 times in one day,"

135
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
as she was describing the marches of soldiers

136
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and the sounds of their bullets.

137
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
She said, "But it's not fair,

138
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
because there is only one life,

139
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and there should only be one death."

140
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We have been only seeing

141
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
one side of war.

142
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We have only been discussing and consumed

143
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
with high-level preoccupations

144
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
over troop levels, drawdown timelines,

145
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
surges and sting operations,

146
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
when we should be examining the details

147
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
of where the social fabric

148
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
has been most torn,

149
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
where the community has improvised

150
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and survived

151
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and shown acts of resilience

152
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and amazing courage

153
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
just to keep life going.

154
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
We have been so consumed

155
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
with seemingly objective discussions

156
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
of politics, tactics,

157
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
weapons, dollars

158
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and casualties.

159
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
This is the language

160
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
of sterility.

161
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
How casually

162
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
we treat casualties

163
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in the context of this topic.

164
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
This is where we conceive of rape and casualties

165
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
as inevitabilities.

166
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Eighty percent of refugees around the world

167
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
are women and children. Oh.

168
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Ninety percent of modern war casualties

169
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
are civilians.

170
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Seventy-five percent of them are women and children.

171
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
How interesting.

172
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Oh, half a million women in Rwanda

173
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
get raped in 100 days.

174
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Or, as we speak now,

175
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
hundreds of thousands of Congolese women

176
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
are getting raped and mutilated.

177
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
How interesting.

178
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
These just become numbers that we refer to.

179
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
The front of wars

180
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
is increasingly non-human eyes

181
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
peering down on our perceived enemies

182
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
from space,

183
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
guiding missiles toward unseen targets,

184
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
while the human conduct

185
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
of the orchestra of media relations

186
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in the event that this particular drone attack

187
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
hits a villager

188
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
instead of an extremist.

189
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It is a chess game.

190
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
You learn to play an international relations school

191
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
on your way out and up

192
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to national and international leadership.

193
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Checkmate.

194
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We are missing

195
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
a completely other side of wars.

196
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
We are missing my mother's story,

197
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
who made sure with every siren, with every raid,

198
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
with every cut off-of electricity,

199
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
she played puppet shows for my brothers and I,

200
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
so we would not be scared

201
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
of the sounds of explosions.

202
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
We are missing the story of Fareeda,

203
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
a music teacher,

204
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
a piano teacher, in Sarajevo,

205
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
who made sure

206
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that she kept the music school open

207
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
every single day

208
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
in the four years of besiege in Sarajevo

209
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and walked to that school,

210
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
despite the snipers shooting

211
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
at that school and at her,

212
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and kept the piano, the violin, the cello

213
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
playing the whole duration of the war,

214
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
with students wearing their gloves and hats and coats.

215
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
That was her fight.

216
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
That was her resistance.

217
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We are missing the story of Nehia,

218
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
a Palestinian woman in Gaza

219
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
who, the minute there was a cease-fire in the last year's war,

220
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
she left out of home,

221
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
collected all the flour

222
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and baked as much bread for every neighbor to have,

223
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
in case there is no cease-fire the day after.

224
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We are missing

225
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
the stories of Violet,

226
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
who, despite surviving genocide in the church massacre,

227
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
she kept on going on,

228
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
burying bodies, cleaning homes, cleaning the streets.

229
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
We are missing stories of women

230
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
who are literally keeping life going

231
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
in the midst of wars.

232
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Do you know --

233
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
do you know that people fall in love in war

234
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and go to school

235
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and go to factories and hospitals

236
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and get divorced and go dancing and go playing

237
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and live life going?

238
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And the ones who are keeping that life

239
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
are women.

240
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
There are two sides of war.

241
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
There is a side that fights,

242
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and there is a side that keeps the schools

243
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and the factories and the hospitals open.

244
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
There is a side that is focused on winning battles,

245
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and there is a side that is focused

246
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
on winning life.

247
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
There is a side that leads the front-line discussion,

248
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and there is a side

249
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that leads the back-line discussion.

250
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
There is a side that thinks

251
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that peace is the end of fighting,

252
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and there is a side that thinks

253
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that peace is the arrival

254
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of schools and jobs.

255
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
There is a side

256
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
that is led by men,

257
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and there is a side

258
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that is led by women.

259
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
And in order for us to understand

260
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
how do we build lasting peace,

261
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
we must understand war and peace

262
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
from both sides.

263
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We must have a full picture

264
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
of what that means.

265
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
In order for us to understand

266
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
what actually peace means,

267
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
we need to understand,

268
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
as one Sudanese woman once told me,

269
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
"Peace is the fact that my toenails

270
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
are growing back again."

271
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
She grew up in Sudan, in Southern Sudan,

272
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
for 20 years of war,

273
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
where it killed one million people

274
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and displaced five million refugees.

275
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Many women were taken as slaves

276
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
by rebels and soldiers,

277
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
as sexual slaves who were forced also

278
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to carry the ammunition and the water

279
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and the food for the soldiers.

280
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So that woman walked for 20 years,

281
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
so she would not be kidnapped again.

282
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And only when there was some sort of peace,

283
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
her toenails grew back again.

284
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
We need to understand peace

285
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
from a toenail's perspective.

286
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We need to understand

287
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
that we cannot actually have negotiations

288
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
of ending of wars or peace

289
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
without fully including women

290
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
at the negotiating table.

291
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I find it amazing

292
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that the only group of people

293
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
who are not fighting and not killing

294
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and not pillaging and not burning and not raping,

295
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and the group of people who are mostly --

296
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
though not exclusively --

297
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
who are keeping life going in the midst of war,

298
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
are not included in the negotiating table.

299
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And I do argue that women lead the back-line discussion,

300
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
but there are also men

301
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
who are excluded from that discussion.

302
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
The doctors who are not fighting,

303
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
the artists, the students, the men who refuse to pick up the guns,

304
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
they are, too, excluded

305
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
from the negotiating tables.

306
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
There is no way we can talk about a lasting peace,

307
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
building of democracy, sustainable economies,

308
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
any kind of stabilities,

309
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
if we do not fully include women

310
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
at the negotiating table.

311
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Not one, but 50 percent.

312
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
There is no way we can talk about the building of stability

313
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
if we don't start investing

314
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
in women and girls.

315
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Did you know

316
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that one year

317
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
of the world's military spending

318
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
equals 700 years

319
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
of the U.N. budget

320
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and equals 2,928 years

321
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
of the U.N. budget allocated for women?

322
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
If we just reverse

323
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that distribution of funds,

324
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
perhaps we could have

325
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
a better lasting peace in this world.

326
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And last, but not least,

327
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
we need to invest in peace and women,

328
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
not only because it is the right thing to do,

329
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
not only because it is the right thing to do,

330
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
for all of us to build sustainable and lasting peace today,

331
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but it is for the future.

332
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
A Congolese woman,

333
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
who was telling me about

334
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
how her children saw their father killed in front of them

335
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and saw her raped in front of them

336
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and mutilated in front of them,

337
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and her children saw their nine-year-old sibling

338
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
killed in front of them,

339
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
how they're doing okay right now.

340
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
She got into Women for Women International's program.

341
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
She got a support network.

342
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
She learned about her rights.

343
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
We taught her vocational and business skills. We helped her get a job.

344
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
She was earning 450 dollars. She was doing okay.

345
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
She was sending them to school. Have a new home.

346
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
She said, "But what I worry about the most

347
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
is not any of that.

348
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I worry that my children

349
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
have hate in their hearts,

350
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and when they want to grow up, they want to fight again

351
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
the killers of their father and their brother."

352
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
We need to invest in women,

353
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
because that's our only chance

354
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
to ensure that there is no more war

355
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
in the future.

356
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
That mother has a better chance to heal her children

357
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
than any peace agreement can do.

358
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Are there good news? Of course, there are good news. There are lots of good news.

359
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
To start with, these women that I told you about

360
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
are dancing and singing every single day,

361
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and if they can,

362
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
who are we not to dance?

363
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
That girl that I told you about

364
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
ended up starting Women for Women International Group

365
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
that impacted one million people, sent 80 million dollars,

366
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
and I started this from zero,

367
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
nothing, nada, [unclear].

368
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
(Laughter)

369
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
They are women who are standing on their feet

370
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
in spite of their circumstances,

371
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
not because of it.

372
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Think of how the world can be a much better place

373
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
if, for a change,

374
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
we have a better equality,

375
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
we have equality,

376
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
we have a representation

377
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and we understand war,

378
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
both from the front-line

379
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and the back-line discussion.

380
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Rumi, a 13th-century Sufi poet,

381
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
says, "Out beyond the worlds

382
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
of right-doings and wrong-doings,

383
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
there is a field.

384
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
I will meet you there.

385
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
When the soul lies down in that grass,

386
0:16:52.26,000 --> 0:16:54,000
the world is too full

387
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
to talk about.

388
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Ideas, language,

389
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
even the phrase 'each other'

390
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
no longer makes any sense."

391
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I humbly add -- humbly add --

392
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
that out beyond

393
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
the worlds of war and peace,

394
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
there is a field,

395
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and there are many women and men

396
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
[who] are meeting there.

397
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Let us make this field a much bigger place.

398
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Let us all meet in that field.

399
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Thank you.

400
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.716,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm going to share with you a paradigm-shifting perspective

3
0:00:16.047,000 --> 0:00:19,000
on the issues of gender violence: sexual assault, domestic violence,

4
0:00:19.346,000 --> 0:00:22,000
relationship abuse, sexual harassment, sexual abuse of children.

5
0:00:22.538,000 --> 0:00:23,000
That whole range of issues

6
0:00:23.872,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that I'll refer to in shorthand as "gender violence issues,"

7
0:00:26.783,000 --> 0:00:3,000
they've been seen as women's issues that some good men help out with,

8
0:00:30.891,000 --> 0:00:32,000
but I have a problem with that frame and I don't accept it.

9
0:00:33.69,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I don't see these as women's issues that some good men help out with.

10
0:00:36.967,000 --> 0:00:38,000
In fact, I'm going to argue that these are men's issues,

11
0:00:39.628,000 --> 0:00:4,000
first and foremost.

12
0:00:41.038,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now obviously --

13
0:00:42.25,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Applause)

14
0:00:43.532,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Obviously, they're also women's issues, so I appreciate that,

15
0:00:46.44,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but calling gender violence a women's issue is part of the problem,

16
0:00:51.111,000 --> 0:00:52,000
for a number of reasons.

17
0:00:52.763,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The first is that it gives men an excuse not to pay attention, right?

18
0:00:56.261,000 --> 0:00:58,000
A lot of men hear the term "women's issues"

19
0:00:58.331,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and we tend to tune it out, and we think,

20
0:01:00.344,000 --> 0:01:02,000
"I'm a guy; that's for the girls," or "that's for the women."

21
0:01:03.273,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And a lot of men literally don't get beyond the first sentence as a result.

22
0:01:07.185,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It's almost like a chip in our brain is activated,

23
0:01:09.562,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and the neural pathways take our attention in a different direction

24
0:01:12.746,000 --> 0:01:13,000
when we hear the term "women's issues."

25
0:01:14.631,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This is also true, by the way, of the word "gender,"

26
0:01:17.114,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because a lot of people hear the word "gender"

27
0:01:19.456,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and they think it means "women."

28
0:01:21.06,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So they think that gender issues is synonymous with women's issues.

29
0:01:24.264,000 --> 0:01:26,000
There's some confusion about the term gender.

30
0:01:26.399,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And let me illustrate that confusion by way of analogy.

31
0:01:29.008,000 --> 0:01:3,000
So let's talk for a moment about race.

32
0:01:30.854,000 --> 0:01:31,000
In the US, when we hear the word "race,"

33
0:01:32.798,000 --> 0:01:34,000
a lot of people think that means African-American,

34
0:01:35.184,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Latino, Asian-American, Native American,

35
0:01:37.281,000 --> 0:01:39,000
South Asian, Pacific Islander, on and on.

36
0:01:40.369,000 --> 0:01:42,000
A lot of people, when they hear the word "sexual orientation"

37
0:01:43.305,000 --> 0:01:45,000
think it means gay, lesbian, bisexual.

38
0:01:45.744,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And a lot of people, when they hear the word "gender,"

39
0:01:48.309,000 --> 0:01:49,000
think it means women.

40
0:01:49.487,000 --> 0:01:51,000
In each case, the dominant group doesn't get paid attention to.

41
0:01:52.487,000 --> 0:01:54,000
As if white people don't have some sort of racial identity

42
0:01:55.261,000 --> 0:01:57,000
or belong to some racial category or construct,

43
0:01:58.275,000 --> 0:02:01,000
as if heterosexual people don't have a sexual orientation,

44
0:02:01.835,000 --> 0:02:03,000
as if men don't have a gender.

45
0:02:03.959,000 --> 0:02:06,000
This is one of the ways that dominant systems maintain and reproduce themselves,

46
0:02:07.761,000 --> 0:02:09,000
which is to say the dominant group is rarely challenged

47
0:02:10.374,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to even think about its dominance,

48
0:02:12.058,000 --> 0:02:15,000
because that's one of the key characteristics of power and privilege,

49
0:02:15.335,000 --> 0:02:16,000
the ability to go unexamined,

50
0:02:16.77,000 --> 0:02:21,000
lacking introspection, in fact being rendered invisible, in large measure,

51
0:02:21.971,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in the discourse about issues that are primarily about us.

52
0:02:25.425,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And this is amazing how this works in domestic and sexual violence,

53
0:02:28.639,000 --> 0:02:31,000
how men have been largely erased from so much of the conversation

54
0:02:32.23,000 --> 0:02:34,000
about a subject that is centrally about men.

55
0:02:35.245,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And I'm going to illustrate what I'm talking about

56
0:02:37.604,000 --> 0:02:38,000
by using the old tech.

57
0:02:38.976,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I'm old school on some fundamental regards.

58
0:02:41.707,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I make films and I work with high tech,

59
0:02:44.466,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but I'm still old school as an educator,

60
0:02:47.11,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and I want to share with you this exercise

61
0:02:49.72,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that illustrates on the sentence-structure level

62
0:02:52.477,000 --> 0:02:56,000
how the way that we think, literally the way that we use language,

63
0:02:57.032,000 --> 0:02:59,000
conspires to keep our attention off of men.

64
0:02:59.199,000 --> 0:03:01,000
This is about domestic violence in particular,

65
0:03:01.41,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but you can plug in other analogues.

66
0:03:04.858,000 --> 0:03:07,000
This comes from the work of the feminist linguist Julia Penelope.

67
0:03:07.946,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It starts with a very basic English sentence:

68
0:03:10.138,000 --> 0:03:13,000
"John beat Mary."

69
0:03:13.591,000 --> 0:03:14,000
That's a good English sentence.

70
0:03:15.116,000 --> 0:03:18,000
John is the subject, beat is the verb, Mary is the object, good sentence.

71
0:03:18.626,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Now we're going to move to the second sentence,

72
0:03:20.864,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which says the same thing in the passive voice.

73
0:03:23.234,000 --> 0:03:28,000
"Mary was beaten by John."

74
0:03:29.564,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And now a whole lot has happened in one sentence.

75
0:03:32.374,000 --> 0:03:34,000
We've gone from "John beat Mary"

76
0:03:34.503,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to "Mary was beaten by John."

77
0:03:36.322,000 --> 0:03:39,000
We've shifted our focus in one sentence from John to Mary,

78
0:03:39.609,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and you can see John is very close to the end of the sentence,

79
0:03:42.54,000 --> 0:03:44,000
well, close to dropping off the map of our psychic plain.

80
0:03:45.53,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The third sentence, John is dropped,

81
0:03:47.274,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and we have, "Mary was beaten,"

82
0:03:50.612,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and now it's all about Mary.

83
0:03:52.508,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We're not even thinking about John, it's totally focused on Mary.

84
0:03:55.594,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Over the past generation,

85
0:03:56.829,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the term we've used synonymous with "beaten" is "battered,"

86
0:03:59.629,000 --> 0:04:02,000
so we have "Mary was battered."

87
0:04:03.324,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And the final sentence in this sequence, flowing from the others, is,

88
0:04:07.142,000 --> 0:04:09,000
"Mary is a battered woman."

89
0:04:09.84,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So now Mary's very identity -- Mary is a battered woman --

90
0:04:17.673,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is what was done to her by John in the first instance.

91
0:04:20.244,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But we've demonstrated that John has long ago left the conversation.

92
0:04:23.484,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Those of us who work in the domestic and sexual violence field

93
0:04:26.424,000 --> 0:04:28,000
know that victim-blaming is pervasive in this realm,

94
0:04:28.965,000 --> 0:04:3,000
which is to say, blaming the person to whom something was done

95
0:04:31.928,000 --> 0:04:32,000
rather than the person who did it.

96
0:04:33.583,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And we say: why do they go out with these men?

97
0:04:35.815,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Why are they attracted to them? Why do they keep going back?

98
0:04:38.719,000 --> 0:04:4,000
What was she wearing at that party? What a stupid thing to do.

99
0:04:41.695,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Why was she drinking with those guys in that hotel room?

100
0:04:44.407,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This is victim blaming, and there are many reasons for it,

101
0:04:47.196,000 --> 0:04:5,000
but one is that our cognitive structure is set up to blame victims.

102
0:04:50.826,000 --> 0:04:51,000
This is all unconscious.

103
0:04:52.017,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Our whole cognitive structure is set up to ask questions

104
0:04:54.666,000 --> 0:04:57,000
about women and women's choices and what they're doing, thinking, wearing.

105
0:04:58.181,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And I'm not going to shout down people who ask questions about women.

106
0:05:01.527,000 --> 0:05:02,000
It's a legitimate thing to ask.

107
0:05:03.052,000 --> 0:05:05,000
But's let's be clear: Asking questions about Mary

108
0:05:05.375,000 --> 0:05:08,000
is not going to get us anywhere in terms of preventing violence.

109
0:05:08.531,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We have to ask a different set of questions.

110
0:05:10.616,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The questions are not about Mary, they're about John.

111
0:05:14.297,000 --> 0:05:16,000
They include things like, why does John beat Mary?

112
0:05:17.11,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Why is domestic violence still a big problem in the US and all over the world?

113
0:05:20.965,000 --> 0:05:22,000
What's going on? Why do so many men abuse physically,

114
0:05:23.639,000 --> 0:05:25,000
emotionally, verbally, and other ways,

115
0:05:25.849,000 --> 0:05:28,000
the women and girls, and the men and boys, that they claim to love?

116
0:05:29.099,000 --> 0:05:3,000
What's going on with men?

117
0:05:30.678,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Why do so many adult men sexually abuse little girls and boys?

118
0:05:34.156,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Why is that a common problem in our society

119
0:05:36.345,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and all over the world today?

120
0:05:38.224,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Why do we hear over and over again

121
0:05:39.868,000 --> 0:05:42,000
about new scandals erupting in major institutions

122
0:05:43.29,000 --> 0:05:46,000
like the Catholic Church or the Penn State football program

123
0:05:46.591,000 --> 0:05:48,000
or the Boy Scouts of America, on and on and on?

124
0:05:48.815,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And then local communities all over the country

125
0:05:51.054,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and all over the world.

126
0:05:52.243,000 --> 0:05:53,000
We hear about it all the time.

127
0:05:53.727,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The sexual abuse of children.

128
0:05:55.249,000 --> 0:05:58,000
What's going on with men? Why do so many men rape women

129
0:05:58.663,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in our society and around the world?

130
0:06:00.438,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Why do so many men rape other men?

131
0:06:02.189,000 --> 0:06:03,000
What is going on with men?

132
0:06:03.76,000 --> 0:06:07,000
And then what is the role of the various institutions in our society

133
0:06:08.752,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that are helping to produce abusive men at pandemic rates?

134
0:06:11.56,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Because this isn't about individual perpetrators.

135
0:06:13.894,000 --> 0:06:15,000
That's a naive way to understanding what is a much deeper

136
0:06:16.638,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and more systematic social problem.

137
0:06:18.349,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The perpetrators aren't these monsters who crawl out of the swamp

138
0:06:22.044,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and come into town and do their nasty business

139
0:06:24.512,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and then retreat into the darkness.

140
0:06:26.455,000 --> 0:06:28,000
That's a very naive notion, right?

141
0:06:28.761,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Perpetrators are much more normal than that, and everyday than that.

142
0:06:32.079,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So the question is, what are we doing here in our society and in the world?

143
0:06:36.48,000 --> 0:06:38,000
What are the roles of various institutions

144
0:06:38.509,000 --> 0:06:4,000
in helping to produce abusive men?

145
0:06:41.04,000 --> 0:06:43,000
What's the role of religious belief systems,

146
0:06:43.147,000 --> 0:06:45,000
the sports culture, the pornography culture,

147
0:06:45.312,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the family structure, economics, and how that intersects,

148
0:06:48.051,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and race and ethnicity and how that intersects?

149
0:06:50.314,000 --> 0:06:51,000
How does all this work?

150
0:06:51.817,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And then, once we start making those kinds of connections

151
0:06:54.744,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and asking those important and big questions,

152
0:06:57.402,000 --> 0:06:59,000
then we can talk about how we can be transformative,

153
0:06:59.884,000 --> 0:07:01,000
in other words, how can we do something differently?

154
0:07:02.359,000 --> 0:07:03,000
How can we change the practices?

155
0:07:03.961,000 --> 0:07:05,000
How can we change the socialization of boys

156
0:07:05.991,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and the definitions of manhood that lead to these current outcomes?

157
0:07:09.44,000 --> 0:07:11,000
These are the kind of questions that we need to be asking

158
0:07:12.154,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and the kind of work that we need to be doing,

159
0:07:14.338,000 --> 0:07:17,000
but if we're endlessly focused on what women are doing and thinking

160
0:07:17.925,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in relationships or elsewhere,

161
0:07:19.636,000 --> 0:07:21,000
we're not going to get to that piece.

162
0:07:22.082,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I understand that a lot of women

163
0:07:23.769,000 --> 0:07:25,000
who have been trying to speak out about these issues,

164
0:07:26.272,000 --> 0:07:28,000
today and yesterday and for years and years,

165
0:07:28.363,000 --> 0:07:3,000
often get shouted down for their efforts.

166
0:07:30.643,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They get called nasty names like "male-basher" and "man-hater,"

167
0:07:35.663,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and the disgusting and offensive "feminazi", right?

168
0:07:42.229,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And you know what all this is about?

169
0:07:43.994,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It's called kill the messenger.

170
0:07:45.522,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It's because the women who are standing up

171
0:07:47.553,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and speaking out for themselves and for other women

172
0:07:49.995,000 --> 0:07:51,000
as well as for men and boys,

173
0:07:52.204,000 --> 0:07:54,000
it's a statement to them to sit down and shut up,

174
0:07:54.6,000 --> 0:07:55,000
keep the current system in place,

175
0:07:56.232,000 --> 0:07:58,000
because we don't like it when people rock the boat.

176
0:07:58.654,000 --> 0:08:,000
We don't like it when people challenge our power.

177
0:08:01.026,000 --> 0:08:03,000
You'd better sit down and shut up, basically.

178
0:08:03.172,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And thank goodness that women haven't done that.

179
0:08:05.447,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Thank goodness that we live in a world

180
0:08:07.345,000 --> 0:08:1,000
where there's so much women's leadership that can counteract that.

181
0:08:10.491,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But one of the powerful roles that men can play in this work

182
0:08:13.357,000 --> 0:08:15,000
is that we can say some things that sometimes women can't say,

183
0:08:16.307,000 --> 0:08:18,000
or, better yet, we can be heard saying some things

184
0:08:18.714,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that women often can't be heard saying.

185
0:08:20.691,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Now, I appreciate that that's a problem, it's sexism, but it's the truth.

186
0:08:24.197,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So one of the things that I say to men,

187
0:08:26.119,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and my colleagues and I always say this,

188
0:08:28.082,000 --> 0:08:3,000
is we need more men who have the courage and the strength

189
0:08:30.791,000 --> 0:08:32,000
to start standing up and saying some of this stuff,

190
0:08:33.225,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and standing with women and not against them

191
0:08:35.35,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and pretending that somehow this is a battle between the sexes

192
0:08:38.342,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and other kinds of nonsense.

193
0:08:39.712,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We live in the world together.

194
0:08:41.212,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And by the way, one of the things that really bothers me

195
0:08:43.908,000 --> 0:08:45,000
about some of the rhetoric against feminists and others

196
0:08:46.519,000 --> 0:08:49,000
who have built the battered women's and rape crisis movements around the world

197
0:08:50.245,000 --> 0:08:52,000
is that somehow, like I said, that they're anti-male.

198
0:08:52.773,000 --> 0:08:55,000
What about all the boys who are profoundly affected in a negative way

199
0:08:56.052,000 --> 0:08:59,000
by what some adult man is doing against their mother, themselves, their sisters?

200
0:08:59.859,000 --> 0:09:,000
What about all those boys?

201
0:09:01.159,000 --> 0:09:02,000
What about all the young men and boys

202
0:09:02.951,000 --> 0:09:04,000
who have been traumatized by adult men's violence?

203
0:09:05.336,000 --> 0:09:06,000
You know what?

204
0:09:06.548,000 --> 0:09:08,000
The same system that produces men who abuse women,

205
0:09:08.952,000 --> 0:09:09,000
produces men who abuse other men.

206
0:09:10.563,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And if we want to talk about male victims, let's talk about male victims.

207
0:09:14.055,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Most male victims of violence are the victims of other men's violence.

208
0:09:17.385,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So that's something that both women and men have in common.

209
0:09:20.195,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We are both victims of men's violence.

210
0:09:22.1,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So we have it in our direct self-interest,

211
0:09:24.156,000 --> 0:09:26,000
not to mention the fact that most men that I know

212
0:09:26.47,000 --> 0:09:28,000
have women and girls that we care deeply about,

213
0:09:28.703,000 --> 0:09:3,000
in our families and our friendship circles and every other way.

214
0:09:31.705,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So there's so many reasons why we need men to speak out.

215
0:09:34.378,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It seems obvious saying it out loud, doesn't it?

216
0:09:37.751,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Now, the nature of the work that I do and my colleagues do

217
0:09:41.348,000 --> 0:09:44,000
in the sports culture and the US military, in schools,

218
0:09:45.029,000 --> 0:09:47,000
we pioneered this approach called the bystander approach

219
0:09:47.901,000 --> 0:09:48,000
to gender-violence prevention.

220
0:09:49.913,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And I just want to give you the highlights of the bystander approach,

221
0:09:53.256,000 --> 0:09:55,000
because it's a big thematic shift,

222
0:09:55.715,000 --> 0:09:56,000
although there's lots of particulars,

223
0:09:57.56,000 --> 0:10:,000
but the heart of it is, instead of seeing men as perpetrators

224
0:10:00.882,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and women as victims,

225
0:10:02.144,000 --> 0:10:05,000
or women as perpetrators, men as victims,

226
0:10:05.624,000 --> 0:10:06,000
or any combination in there.

227
0:10:07.211,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I'm using the gender binary.

228
0:10:08.628,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I know there's more than men and women, there's more than male and female.

229
0:10:12.15,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And there are women who are perpetrators,

230
0:10:14.131,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and of course there are men who are victims.

231
0:10:16.302,000 --> 0:10:17,000
There's a whole spectrum.

232
0:10:17.538,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But instead of seeing it in the binary fashion,

233
0:10:19.773,000 --> 0:10:21,000
we focus on all of us as what we call bystanders,

234
0:10:22.153,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and a bystander is defined as anybody who is not a perpetrator or a victim

235
0:10:26.344,000 --> 0:10:27,000
in a given situation,

236
0:10:27.976,000 --> 0:10:31,000
so in other words friends, teammates, colleagues, coworkers, family members,

237
0:10:32.038,000 --> 0:10:35,000
those of us who are not directly involved in a dyad of abuse,

238
0:10:35.976,000 --> 0:10:38,000
but we are embedded in social, family, work, school,

239
0:10:39.322,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and other peer culture relationships

240
0:10:41.106,000 --> 0:10:43,000
with people who might be in that situation.

241
0:10:43.158,000 --> 0:10:46,000
What do we do? How do we speak up? How do we challenge our friends?

242
0:10:46.382,000 --> 0:10:47,000
How do we support our friends?

243
0:10:47.9,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But how do we not remain silent in the face of abuse?

244
0:10:50.435,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Now, when it comes to men and male culture,

245
0:10:53.145,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the goal is to get men who are not abusive to challenge men who are.

246
0:10:56.565,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And when I say abusive, I don't mean just men who are beating women.

247
0:10:59.836,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We're not just saying a man whose friend is abusing his girlfriend

248
0:11:04.656,000 --> 0:11:06,000
needs to stop the guy at the moment of attack.

249
0:11:07.497,000 --> 0:11:11,000
That's a naive way of creating a social change.

250
0:11:11.975,000 --> 0:11:14,000
It's along a continuum, we're trying to get men to interrupt each other.

251
0:11:15.895,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So, for example, if you're a guy and you're in a group of guys

252
0:11:18.847,000 --> 0:11:2,000
playing poker, talking, hanging out, no women present,

253
0:11:21.739,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and another guy says something sexist or degrading or harassing about women,

254
0:11:28.112,000 --> 0:11:3,000
instead of laughing along or pretending you didn't hear it,

255
0:11:30.988,000 --> 0:11:32,000
we need men to say, "Hey, that's not funny.

256
0:11:33.029,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that could be my sister you're talking about,

257
0:11:35.303,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and could you joke about something else?

258
0:11:37.291,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Or could you talk about something else?

259
0:11:39.191,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I don't appreciate that kind of talk."

260
0:11:41.046,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Just like if you're a white person

261
0:11:42.715,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and another white person makes a racist comment, you'd hope, I hope,

262
0:11:45.982,000 --> 0:11:47,000
that white people would interrupt that racist enactment

263
0:11:48.63,000 --> 0:11:49,000
by a fellow white person.

264
0:11:49.891,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Just like with heterosexism, if you're a heterosexual person

265
0:11:52.781,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and you yourself don't enact harassing or abusive behaviors

266
0:11:55.612,000 --> 0:11:57,000
towards people of varying sexual orientations,

267
0:11:57.846,000 --> 0:12:,000
if you don't say something in the face of other heterosexual people doing that,

268
0:12:01.59,000 --> 0:12:04,000
then, in a sense, isn't your silence a form of consent and complicity?

269
0:12:04.925,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Well, the bystander approach is trying to give people tools

270
0:12:07.784,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to interrupt that process and to speak up and to create a peer culture climate

271
0:12:11.629,000 --> 0:12:13,000
where the abusive behavior will be seen as unacceptable,

272
0:12:14.317,000 --> 0:12:16,000
not just because it's illegal, but because it's wrong

273
0:12:17.108,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and unacceptable in the peer culture.

274
0:12:19.183,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And if we can get to the place where men

275
0:12:21.603,000 --> 0:12:23,000
who act out in sexist ways will lose status,

276
0:12:23.918,000 --> 0:12:24,000
young men and boys who act out in sexist

277
0:12:25.847,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and harassing ways towards girls and women,

278
0:12:27.887,000 --> 0:12:28,000
as well as towards other boys and men,

279
0:12:29.85,000 --> 0:12:31,000
will lose status as a result of it, guess what?

280
0:12:32.391,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We'll see a radical diminution of the abuse.

281
0:12:35.396,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Because the typical perpetrator is not sick and twisted.

282
0:12:38.067,000 --> 0:12:4,000
He's a normal guy in every other way, isn't he?

283
0:12:40.785,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Now, among the many great things that Martin Luther King

284
0:12:44.177,000 --> 0:12:45,000
said in his short life was,

285
0:12:45.72,000 --> 0:12:48,000
"In the end, what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies

286
0:12:49.147,000 --> 0:12:51,000
but the silence of our friends."

287
0:12:51.225,000 --> 0:12:54,000
In the end, what will hurt the most is not the words of our enemies

288
0:12:54.42,000 --> 0:12:55,000
but the silence of our friends.

289
0:12:55.959,000 --> 0:12:57,000
There's been an awful lot of silence in male culture

290
0:12:58.438,000 --> 0:13:,000
about this ongoing tragedy of men's violence

291
0:13:00.535,000 --> 0:13:01,000
against women and children, hasn't there?

292
0:13:02.529,000 --> 0:13:03,000
There's been an awful lot of silence.

293
0:13:04.339,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And all I'm saying is that we need to break that silence,

294
0:13:07.215,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and we need more men to do that.

295
0:13:09.475,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Now, it's easier said than done,

296
0:13:12.798,000 --> 0:13:13,000
because I'm saying it now,

297
0:13:14.212,000 --> 0:13:16,000
but I'm telling you it's not easy in male culture

298
0:13:16.71,000 --> 0:13:17,000
for guys to challenge each other,

299
0:13:18.635,000 --> 0:13:2,000
which is one of the reasons

300
0:13:21.04,000 --> 0:13:23,000
why part of the paradigm shift that has to happen

301
0:13:23.372,000 --> 0:13:25,000
is not just understanding these issues as men's issues,

302
0:13:26.134,000 --> 0:13:28,000
but they're also leadership issues for men.

303
0:13:28.205,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Because ultimately, the responsibility for taking a stand on these issues

304
0:13:31.667,000 --> 0:13:33,000
should not fall on the shoulders of little boys

305
0:13:33.966,000 --> 0:13:35,000
or teenage boys in high school or college men.

306
0:13:36.81,000 --> 0:13:37,000
It should be on adult men with power.

307
0:13:38.779,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Adult men with power are the ones we need to be holding accountable

308
0:13:41.964,000 --> 0:13:42,000
for being leaders on these issues,

309
0:13:43.653,000 --> 0:13:45,000
because when somebody speaks up in a peer culture

310
0:13:45.996,000 --> 0:13:46,000
and challenges and interrupts,

311
0:13:47.956,000 --> 0:13:49,000
he or she is being a leader, really.

312
0:13:50.554,000 --> 0:13:53,000
But on a big scale, we need more adult men with power

313
0:13:53.829,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to start prioritizing these issues,

314
0:13:55.999,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and we haven't seen that yet, have we?

315
0:13:58.452,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Now, I was at a dinner a number of years ago,

316
0:14:01.882,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and I work extensively with the US military, all the services.

317
0:14:05.095,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And I was at this dinner and this woman said to me --

318
0:14:08.636,000 --> 0:14:1,000
I think she thought she was a little clever --

319
0:14:10.817,000 --> 0:14:14,000
she said, "So how long have you been doing sensitivity training with the Marines?"

320
0:14:15.387,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And I said, "With all due respect,

321
0:14:18.657,000 --> 0:14:2,000
I don't do sensitivity training with the Marines.

322
0:14:21.21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
I run a leadership program in the Marine Corps."

323
0:14:23.512,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Now, I know it's a bit pompous, my response,

324
0:14:25.61,000 --> 0:14:26,000
but it's an important distinction,

325
0:14:27.395,000 --> 0:14:3,000
because I don't believe that what we need is sensitivity training.

326
0:14:30.568,000 --> 0:14:32,000
We need leadership training, because, for example,

327
0:14:33.028,000 --> 0:14:36,000
when a professional coach or a manager of a baseball team or a football team --

328
0:14:36.818,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and I work extensively in that realm as well --

329
0:14:39.148,000 --> 0:14:42,000
makes a sexist comment, makes a homophobic statement,

330
0:14:42.375,000 --> 0:14:43,000
makes a racist comment,

331
0:14:43.94,000 --> 0:14:46,000
there will be discussions on the sports blogs and in sports talk radio.

332
0:14:47.344,000 --> 0:14:49,000
And some people will say, "He needs sensitivity training."

333
0:14:50.15,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Other people will say, "Well, get off it.

334
0:14:52.179,000 --> 0:14:54,000
That's political correctness run amok,

335
0:14:54.373,000 --> 0:14:55,000
he made a stupid statement, move on."

336
0:14:56.201,000 --> 0:14:58,000
My argument is, he doesn't need sensitivity training.

337
0:14:58.855,000 --> 0:14:59,000
He needs leadership training,

338
0:15:00.287,000 --> 0:15:01,000
because he's being a bad leader,

339
0:15:01.847,000 --> 0:15:04,000
because in a society with gender diversity and sexual diversity --

340
0:15:04.998,000 --> 0:15:05,000
(Applause)

341
0:15:06.087,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and racial and ethnic diversity,

342
0:15:07.65,000 --> 0:15:1,000
you make those kind of comments, you're failing at your leadership.

343
0:15:10.881,000 --> 0:15:12,000
If we can make this point that I'm making

344
0:15:13.093,000 --> 0:15:15,000
to powerful men and women in our society

345
0:15:15.758,000 --> 0:15:18,000
at all levels of institutional authority and power,

346
0:15:18.853,000 --> 0:15:21,000
it's going to change the paradigm of people's thinking.

347
0:15:22.655,000 --> 0:15:23,000
You know, for example,

348
0:15:24.185,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I work a lot in college and university athletics

349
0:15:26.485,000 --> 0:15:27,000
throughout North America.

350
0:15:29.087,000 --> 0:15:32,000
We know so much about how to prevent domestic and sexual violence, right?

351
0:15:33.613,000 --> 0:15:35,000
There's no excuse for a college or university

352
0:15:36.009,000 --> 0:15:38,000
to not have domestic and sexual violence prevention training

353
0:15:38.891,000 --> 0:15:4,000
mandated for all student athletes, coaches, administrators,

354
0:15:41.725,000 --> 0:15:43,000
as part of their educational process.

355
0:15:44.097,000 --> 0:15:46,000
We know enough to know that we can easily do that.

356
0:15:46.669,000 --> 0:15:48,000
But you know what's missing? The leadership.

357
0:15:48.781,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But it's not the leadership of student athletes.

358
0:15:51.045,000 --> 0:15:53,000
It's the leadership of the athletic director,

359
0:15:53.199,000 --> 0:15:55,000
the president of the university, the people in charge

360
0:15:55.734,000 --> 0:15:56,000
who make decisions about resources

361
0:15:57.427,000 --> 0:16:,000
and who make decisions about priorities in the institutional settings.

362
0:16:00.754,000 --> 0:16:02,000
That's a failure, in most cases, of men's leadership.

363
0:16:03.314,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Look at Penn State.

364
0:16:04.532,000 --> 0:16:08,000
Penn State is the mother of all teachable moments for the bystander approach.

365
0:16:08.664,000 --> 0:16:1,000
You had so many situations in that realm

366
0:16:11.149,000 --> 0:16:14,000
where men in powerful positions failed to act

367
0:16:14.816,000 --> 0:16:16,000
to protect children, in this case, boys.

368
0:16:17.251,000 --> 0:16:18,000
It's unbelievable, really.

369
0:16:18.528,000 --> 0:16:21,000
But when you get into it, you realize there are pressures on men.

370
0:16:21.635,000 --> 0:16:23,000
There are constraints within peer cultures on men,

371
0:16:24.46,000 --> 0:16:28,000
which is why we need to encourage men to break through those pressures.

372
0:16:28.668,000 --> 0:16:29,000
And one of the ways to do that is to say

373
0:16:30.621,000 --> 0:16:32,000
there's an awful lot of men who care deeply about these issues.

374
0:16:33.625,000 --> 0:16:34,000
I know this, I work with men,

375
0:16:35.13,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and I've been working with tens of thousands,

376
0:16:37.333,000 --> 0:16:39,000
hundreds of thousands of men for many decades now.

377
0:16:39.721,000 --> 0:16:41,000
It's scary, when you think about it, how many years.

378
0:16:42.219,000 --> 0:16:45,000
But there's so many men who care deeply about these issues,

379
0:16:45.699,000 --> 0:16:47,000
but caring deeply is not enough.

380
0:16:47.864,000 --> 0:16:49,000
We need more men with the guts,

381
0:16:50.378,000 --> 0:16:53,000
with the courage, with the strength, with the moral integrity

382
0:16:53.837,000 --> 0:16:56,000
to break our complicit silence and challenge each other

383
0:16:57.853,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and stand with women and not against them.

384
0:17:00.192,000 --> 0:17:01,000
By the way, we owe it to women.

385
0:17:01.907,000 --> 0:17:02,000
There's no question about it.

386
0:17:03.373,000 --> 0:17:04,000
But we also owe it to our sons.

387
0:17:05.018,000 --> 0:17:08,000
We also owe it to young men who are growing up all over the world

388
0:17:08.261,000 --> 0:17:1,000
in situations where they didn't make the choice

389
0:17:10.552,000 --> 0:17:13,000
to be a man in a culture that tells them that manhood is a certain way.

390
0:17:13.949,000 --> 0:17:14,000
They didn't make the choice.

391
0:17:15.639,000 --> 0:17:19,000
We that have a choice, have an opportunity and a responsibility to them as well.

392
0:17:20.66,000 --> 0:17:22,000
I hope that, going forward, men and women,

393
0:17:23.615,000 --> 0:17:25,000
working together, can begin the change

394
0:17:25.931,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and the transformation that will happen

395
0:17:27.931,000 --> 0:17:29,000
so that future generations won't have the level of tragedy

396
0:17:30.73,000 --> 0:17:31,000
that we deal with on a daily basis.

397
0:17:32.53,000 --> 0:17:33,000
I know we can do it, we can do better.

398
0:17:34.364,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Thank you very much.

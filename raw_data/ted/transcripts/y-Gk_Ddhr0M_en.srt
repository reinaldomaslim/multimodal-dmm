1
0:00:20.97,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Whoa, dude.

2
0:00:23.61,000 --> 0:00:24,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:24.85,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Check out those killer equations. Sweet.

4
0:00:30.57,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Actually, for the next 18 minutes I'm going to do the best I can

5
0:00:34.01,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to describe the beauty of particle physics without equations.

6
0:00:37.97,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It turns out there's a lot we can learn from coral.

7
0:00:41.45,000 --> 0:00:43,000
A coral is a very beautiful and unusual animal.

8
0:00:44.17,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Each coral head consists of thousands of individual polyps.

9
0:00:47.73,000 --> 0:00:49,000
These polyps are continually budding and branching

10
0:00:50.29,000 --> 0:00:51,000
into genetically identical neighbors.

11
0:00:53.13,000 --> 0:00:56,000
If we imagine this to be a hyperintelligent coral,

12
0:00:56.21,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we can single out an individual and ask him a reasonable question.

13
0:00:59.41,000 --> 0:01:02,000
We can ask how exactly he got to be in this particular location

14
0:01:02.81,000 --> 0:01:03,000
compared to his neighbors --

15
0:01:04.53,000 --> 0:01:06,000
if it was just chance, or destiny, or what?

16
0:01:08.05,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now, after admonishing us for turning the temperature up too high,

17
0:01:12.33,000 --> 0:01:14,000
he would tell us that our question was completely stupid.

18
0:01:15.17,000 --> 0:01:17,000
These corals can be kind of mean, you see,

19
0:01:17.194,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I have surfing scars to prove that.

20
0:01:19.833,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But this polyp would continue and tell us

21
0:01:21.81,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that his neighbors were quite clearly identical copies of him.

22
0:01:24.89,000 --> 0:01:26,000
That he was in all these other locations as well,

23
0:01:27.25,000 --> 0:01:29,000
but experiencing them as separate individuals.

24
0:01:30.61,000 --> 0:01:32,000
For a coral, branching into different copies

25
0:01:32.97,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is the most natural thing in the world.

26
0:01:35.65,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Unlike us, a hyperintelligent coral

27
0:01:38.05,000 --> 0:01:4,000
would be uniquely prepared to understand quantum mechanics.

28
0:01:42.17,000 --> 0:01:43,000
The mathematics of quantum mechanics

29
0:01:43.93,000 --> 0:01:45,000
very accurately describes how our universe works.

30
0:01:46.49,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And it tells us our reality is continually branching into different possibilities,

31
0:01:50.372,000 --> 0:01:51,000
just like a coral.

32
0:01:52.81,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It's a weird thing for us humans to wrap our minds around,

33
0:01:55.57,000 --> 0:01:57,000
since we only ever get to experience one possibility.

34
0:01:58.45,000 --> 0:02:,000
This quantum weirdness was first described

35
0:02:00.474,000 --> 0:02:01,000
by Erwin Schrödinger and his cat.

36
0:02:02.25,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The cat likes this version better.

37
0:02:03.97,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:07.77,000 --> 0:02:1,000
In this setup, Schrödinger is in a box with a radioactive sample

39
0:02:11.45,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that, by the laws of quantum mechanics, branches into a state

40
0:02:14.37,000 --> 0:02:16,000
in which it is radiated and a state in which it is not.

41
0:02:17.89,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:21.97,000 --> 0:02:23,000
In the branch in which the sample radiates,

43
0:02:24.01,000 --> 0:02:27,000
it sets off a trigger that releases poison and Schrödinger is dead.

44
0:02:27.41,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But in the other branch of reality, he remains alive.

45
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
These realities are experienced separately by each individual.

46
0:02:33.259,000 --> 0:02:35,000
As far as either can tell, the other one doesn't exist.

47
0:02:36.21,000 --> 0:02:37,000
This seems weird to us,

48
0:02:37.45,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because each of us only experiences an individual existence,

49
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and we don't get to see other branches.

50
0:02:42.45,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's as if each of us, like Schrödinger here,

51
0:02:44.77,000 --> 0:02:47,000
are a kind of coral branching into different possibilities.

52
0:02:49.21,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The mathematics of quantum mechanics tells us

53
0:02:51.37,000 --> 0:02:53,000
this is how the world works at tiny scales.

54
0:02:53.69,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It can be summed up in a single sentence:

55
0:02:56.65,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Everything that can happen, does.

56
0:02:58.69,000 --> 0:02:59,000
That's quantum mechanics.

57
0:03:00.17,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But this does not mean everything happens.

58
0:03:02.93,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The rest of physics is about describing what can happen and what can't.

59
0:03:07.29,000 --> 0:03:1,000
What physics tells us is that everything comes down to geometry

60
0:03:10.45,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and the interactions of elementary particles.

61
0:03:13.17,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And things can happen only if these interactions are perfectly balanced.

62
0:03:18.93,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Now I'll go ahead and describe how we know about these particles,

63
0:03:22.01,000 --> 0:03:24,000
what they are and how this balance works.

64
0:03:25.45,000 --> 0:03:27,000
In this machine, a beam of protons and antiprotons

65
0:03:28.41,000 --> 0:03:3,000
are accelerated to near the speed of light

66
0:03:30.45,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and brought together in a collision, producing a burst of pure energy.

67
0:03:34.13,000 --> 0:03:37,000
This energy is immediately converted into a spray of subatomic particles,

68
0:03:38.05,000 --> 0:03:41,000
with detectors and computers used to figure out their properties.

69
0:03:41.37,000 --> 0:03:42,000
This enormous machine --

70
0:03:42.65,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Geneva --

71
0:03:44.85,000 --> 0:03:46,000
has a circumference of 17 miles and, when it's operating,

72
0:03:47.57,000 --> 0:03:49,000
draws five times as much power as the city of Monterey.

73
0:03:51.17,000 --> 0:03:52,000
We can't predict specifically

74
0:03:53.05,000 --> 0:03:55,000
what particles will be produced in any individual collision.

75
0:03:56.01,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Quantum mechanics tells us all possibilities are realized.

76
0:03:59.41,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But physics does tell us what particles can be produced.

77
0:04:02.85,000 --> 0:04:04,000
These particles must have just as much mass and energy

78
0:04:05.41,000 --> 0:04:07,000
as is carried in by the proton and antiproton.

79
0:04:08.89,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Any particles more massive than this energy limit aren't produced,

80
0:04:12.17,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and remain invisible to us.

81
0:04:15.17,000 --> 0:04:18,000
This is why this new particle accelerator is so exciting.

82
0:04:18.25,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's going to push this energy limit seven times

83
0:04:20.53,000 --> 0:04:21,000
beyond what's ever been done before,

84
0:04:22.29,000 --> 0:04:24,000
so we're going to get to see some new particles very soon.

85
0:04:25.69,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But before talking about what we might see,

86
0:04:27.85,000 --> 0:04:29,000
let me describe the particles we already know of.

87
0:04:30.73,000 --> 0:04:32,000
There's a whole zoo of subatomic particles.

88
0:04:33.53,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Most of us are familiar with electrons.

89
0:04:35.45,000 --> 0:04:38,000
A lot of people in this room make a good living pushing them around.

90
0:04:38.69,000 --> 0:04:39,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:39.89,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But the electron also has a neutral partner called the neutrino,

92
0:04:42.93,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with no electric charge and a very tiny mass.

93
0:04:45.73,000 --> 0:04:48,000
In contrast, the up and down quarks have very large masses,

94
0:04:49.21,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and combine in threes to make the protons and neutrons inside atoms.

95
0:04:53.09,000 --> 0:04:56,000
All of these matter particles come in left- and right-handed varieties,

96
0:04:56.45,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and have antiparticle partners that carry opposite charges.

97
0:05:00.69,000 --> 0:05:01,000
These familiar particles

98
0:05:01.97,000 --> 0:05:04,000
also have less familiar second and third generations,

99
0:05:05.01,000 --> 0:05:08,000
which have the same charges as the first but have much higher masses.

100
0:05:10.01,000 --> 0:05:13,000
These matter particles all interact with the various force particles.

101
0:05:13.57,000 --> 0:05:16,000
The electromagnetic force interacts with electrically charged matter

102
0:05:16.81,000 --> 0:05:17,000
via particles called photons.

103
0:05:18.65,000 --> 0:05:19,000
There is also a very weak force

104
0:05:20.21,000 --> 0:05:22,000
called, rather unimaginatively, the weak force ...

105
0:05:22.967,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

106
0:05:24.13,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that interacts only with left-handed matter.

107
0:05:26.77,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The strong force acts between quarks

108
0:05:28.81,000 --> 0:05:31,000
which carry a different kind of charge, called color charge,

109
0:05:31.97,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and come in three different varieties: red, green and blue.

110
0:05:34.77,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You can blame Murray Gell-Mann for these names -- they're his fault.

111
0:05:38.49,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Finally, there's the force of gravity,

112
0:05:40.61,000 --> 0:05:43,000
which interacts with matter via its mass and spin.

113
0:05:43.73,000 --> 0:05:45,000
The most important thing to understand here

114
0:05:45.97,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is that there's a different kind of charge associated with each of these forces.

115
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
These four different forces interact with matter

116
0:05:52.61,000 --> 0:05:54,000
according to the corresponding charges that each particle has.

117
0:05:56.97,000 --> 0:05:59,000
A particle that hasn't been seen yet, but we're pretty sure exists,

118
0:06:00.17,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is the Higgs particle, which gives masses to all these other particles.

119
0:06:03.89,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The main purpose of the Large Hadron Collider

120
0:06:06.05,000 --> 0:06:09,000
is to see this Higgs particle, and we're almost certain it will.

121
0:06:09.45,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But the greatest mystery is what else we might see.

122
0:06:13.49,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And I'm going to show you one beautiful possibility

123
0:06:15.93,000 --> 0:06:16,000
towards the end of this talk.

124
0:06:18.53,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Now, if we count up all these different particles

125
0:06:20.89,000 --> 0:06:21,000
using their various spins and charges,

126
0:06:22.77,000 --> 0:06:23,000
there are 226.

127
0:06:24.73,000 --> 0:06:26,000
That's a lot of particles to keep track of.

128
0:06:27.21,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And it seems strange

129
0:06:28.45,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that nature would have so many elementary particles.

130
0:06:32.01,000 --> 0:06:34,000
But if we plot them out according to their charges,

131
0:06:34.69,000 --> 0:06:35,000
some beautiful patterns emerge.

132
0:06:38.45,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The most familiar charge is electric charge.

133
0:06:41.17,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Electrons have an electric charge,

134
0:06:42.85,000 --> 0:06:43,000
a negative one,

135
0:06:44.09,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and quarks have electric charges in thirds.

136
0:06:46.13,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So when two up quarks and a down quark are combined to make a proton,

137
0:06:49.41,000 --> 0:06:51,000
it has a total electric charge of plus one.

138
0:06:51.45,000 --> 0:06:54,000
These particles also have antiparticles, which have opposite charges.

139
0:06:54.73,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Now, it turns out the electric charge

140
0:06:56.57,000 --> 0:06:58,000
is actually a combination of two other charges:

141
0:06:59.09,000 --> 0:07:,000
hypercharge and weak charge.

142
0:07:01.77,000 --> 0:07:03,000
If we spread out the hypercharge and weak charge

143
0:07:05.092,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and plot the charges of particles in this two-dimensional charge space,

144
0:07:08.45,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the electric charge is where these particles sit

145
0:07:10.73,000 --> 0:07:11,000
along the vertical direction.

146
0:07:12.77,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The electromagnetic and weak forces interact with matter

147
0:07:15.45,000 --> 0:07:17,000
according to their hypercharge and weak charge,

148
0:07:17.69,000 --> 0:07:18,000
which make this pattern.

149
0:07:18.97,000 --> 0:07:2,000
This is called the unified electroweak model,

150
0:07:21.13,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and it was put together back in 1967.

151
0:07:24.05,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The reason most of us are only familiar with electric charge

152
0:07:26.93,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and not both of these is because of the Higgs particle.

153
0:07:30.73,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The Higgs, over here on the left, has a large mass

154
0:07:33.49,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and breaks the symmetry of this electroweak pattern.

155
0:07:35.97,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It makes the weak force very weak by giving the weak particles a large mass.

156
0:07:39.57,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Since this massive Higgs sits along the horizontal direction in this diagram,

157
0:07:43.69,000 --> 0:07:45,000
the photons of electromagnetism remain massless

158
0:07:46.01,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and interact with electric charge along the vertical direction

159
0:07:48.97,000 --> 0:07:49,000
in this charge space.

160
0:07:52.29,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So the electromagnetic and weak forces

161
0:07:54.17,000 --> 0:07:56,000
are described by this pattern of particle charges

162
0:07:56.53,000 --> 0:07:57,000
in two-dimensional space.

163
0:07:57.93,000 --> 0:08:,000
We can include the strong force by spreading out its two charge directions

164
0:08:02.93,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and plotting the charges of the force particles in quarks

165
0:08:05.65,000 --> 0:08:06,000
along these directions.

166
0:08:07.57,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The charges of all known particles

167
0:08:09.25,000 --> 0:08:11,000
can be plotted in a four-dimensional charge space,

168
0:08:11.65,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and projected down to two dimensions like this so we can see them.

169
0:08:14.85,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Whenever particles interact, nature keeps things in a perfect balance

170
0:08:18.65,000 --> 0:08:2,000
along all four of these charge directions.

171
0:08:21.45,000 --> 0:08:23,000
If a particle and an antiparticle collide,

172
0:08:23.53,000 --> 0:08:25,000
it creates a burst of energy and a total charge of zero

173
0:08:26.21,000 --> 0:08:27,000
in all four charge directions.

174
0:08:28.25,000 --> 0:08:3,000
At this point, anything can be created

175
0:08:30.29,000 --> 0:08:33,000
as long as it has the same energy and maintains a total charge of zero.

176
0:08:34.49,000 --> 0:08:37,000
For example, this weak force particle and its antiparticle

177
0:08:37.73,000 --> 0:08:38,000
can be created in a collision.

178
0:08:39.53,000 --> 0:08:41,000
In further interactions, the charges must always balance.

179
0:08:42.45,000 --> 0:08:46,000
One of the weak particles could decay into an electron and an antineutrino,

180
0:08:47.49,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and these three still add to zero total charge.

181
0:08:50.17,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Nature always keeps a perfect balance.

182
0:08:53.129,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So these patterns of charges are not just pretty.

183
0:08:56.09,000 --> 0:08:58,000
They tell us what interactions are allowed to happen.

184
0:08:58.61,000 --> 0:09:,000
And we can rotate this charge space in four dimensions

185
0:09:01.249,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to get a better look at the strong interaction,

186
0:09:04.05,000 --> 0:09:06,000
which has this nice hexagonal symmetry.

187
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
In a strong interaction, a strong force particle,

188
0:09:09.69,000 --> 0:09:1,000
such as this one,

189
0:09:10.93,000 --> 0:09:12,000
interacts with a colored quark, such as this green one,

190
0:09:14.49,000 --> 0:09:16,000
to give a quark with a different color charge -- this red one.

191
0:09:18.49,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And strong interactions are happening millions of times

192
0:09:21.13,000 --> 0:09:23,000
each second in every atom of our bodies,

193
0:09:23.29,000 --> 0:09:24,000
holding the atomic nuclei together.

194
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But these four charges corresponding to three forces

195
0:09:30.21,000 --> 0:09:31,000
are not the end of the story.

196
0:09:32.25,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We can also include two more charges corresponding to the gravitational force.

197
0:09:36.21,000 --> 0:09:37,000
When we include these,

198
0:09:37.53,000 --> 0:09:39,000
each matter particle has two different spin charges,

199
0:09:40.21,000 --> 0:09:41,000
spin-up and spin-down.

200
0:09:42.21,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So they all split and give a nice pattern in six-dimensional charge space.

201
0:09:46.29,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We can rotate this pattern in six dimensions

202
0:09:49.29,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and see that it's quite pretty.

203
0:09:53.53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Right now, this pattern matches our best current knowledge

204
0:09:57.09,000 --> 0:10:,000
of how nature is built at the tiny scales of these elementary particles.

205
0:10:01.37,000 --> 0:10:02,000
This is what we know for certain.

206
0:10:03.01,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Some of these particles are at the very limit

207
0:10:05.17,000 --> 0:10:07,000
of what we've been able to reach with experiments.

208
0:10:07.57,000 --> 0:10:08,000
From this pattern

209
0:10:08.81,000 --> 0:10:11,000
we already know the particle physics of these tiny scales --

210
0:10:12.17,000 --> 0:10:15,000
the way the universe works at these tiny scales is very beautiful.

211
0:10:17.45,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But now I'm going to discuss some new and old ideas

212
0:10:19.89,000 --> 0:10:2,000
about things we don't know yet.

213
0:10:22.01,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We want to expand this pattern using mathematics alone,

214
0:10:25.17,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and see if we can get our hands on the whole enchilada.

215
0:10:27.81,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We want to find all the particles and forces

216
0:10:29.93,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that make a complete picture of our universe.

217
0:10:32.09,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And we want to use this picture to predict new particles

218
0:10:34.77,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that we'll see when experiments reach higher energies.

219
0:10:39.25,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So there's an old idea in particle physics

220
0:10:41.53,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that this known pattern of charges,

221
0:10:44.29,000 --> 0:10:45,000
which is not very symmetric,

222
0:10:45.89,000 --> 0:10:47,000
could emerge from a more perfect pattern that gets broken --

223
0:10:48.77,000 --> 0:10:51,000
similar to how the Higgs particle breaks the electroweak pattern

224
0:10:51.81,000 --> 0:10:52,000
to give electromagnetism.

225
0:10:53.49,000 --> 0:10:56,000
In order to do this, we need to introduce new forces

226
0:10:56.57,000 --> 0:10:57,000
with new charge directions.

227
0:10:59.81,000 --> 0:11:,000
When we introduce a new direction,

228
0:11:01.53,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we get to guess what charges the particles have along this direction,

229
0:11:04.97,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and then we can rotate it in with the others.

230
0:11:08.05,000 --> 0:11:11,000
If we guess wisely, we can construct the standard charges

231
0:11:11.57,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in six charge dimensions as a broken symmetry

232
0:11:14.29,000 --> 0:11:17,000
of this more perfect pattern in seven charge dimensions.

233
0:11:18.37,000 --> 0:11:2,000
This particular choice corresponds to a grand unified theory

234
0:11:21.37,000 --> 0:11:23,000
introduced by Pati and Salam in 1973.

235
0:11:24.77,000 --> 0:11:26,000
When we look at this new unified pattern,

236
0:11:27.53,000 --> 0:11:29,000
we can see a couple of gaps where particles seem to be missing.

237
0:11:31.41,000 --> 0:11:33,000
This is the way theories of unification work.

238
0:11:34.29,000 --> 0:11:36,000
A physicist looks for larger, more symmetric patterns

239
0:11:36.85,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that include the established pattern as a subset.

240
0:11:40.01,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The larger pattern allows us to predict the existence of particles

241
0:11:43.17,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that have never been seen.

242
0:11:45.57,000 --> 0:11:47,000
This unification model predicts the existence

243
0:11:47.85,000 --> 0:11:49,000
of these two new force particles,

244
0:11:50.37,000 --> 0:11:52,000
which should act a lot like the weak force, only weaker.

245
0:11:54.49,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Now, we can rotate this set of charges in seven dimensions

246
0:11:57.25,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and consider an odd fact about the matter particles:

247
0:12:00.93,000 --> 0:12:02,000
the second and third generations of matter

248
0:12:03.01,000 --> 0:12:05,000
have exactly the same charges in six-dimensional charge space

249
0:12:05.93,000 --> 0:12:06,000
as the first generation.

250
0:12:07.81,000 --> 0:12:1,000
These particles are not uniquely identified by their six charges.

251
0:12:11.65,000 --> 0:12:13,000
They sit on top of one another in the standard charge space.

252
0:12:15.73,000 --> 0:12:18,000
However, if we work in eight-dimensional charge space,

253
0:12:19.37,000 --> 0:12:22,000
then we can assign unique new charges to each particle.

254
0:12:23.69,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Then we can spin these in eight dimensions

255
0:12:26.77,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and see what the whole pattern looks like.

256
0:12:30.313,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Here we can see the second and third generations of matter now,

257
0:12:33.29,000 --> 0:12:36,000
related to the first generation by a symmetry called "triality."

258
0:12:37.85,000 --> 0:12:4,000
This particular pattern of charges in eight dimensions

259
0:12:41.37,000 --> 0:12:44,000
is actually part of the most beautiful geometric structure in mathematics.

260
0:12:46.09,000 --> 0:12:49,000
It's a pattern of the largest exceptional Lie group, E8.

261
0:12:50.05,000 --> 0:12:54,000
This Lie group is a smooth, curved shape with 248 dimensions.

262
0:12:54.09,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Each point in this pattern corresponds to a symmetry

263
0:12:57.09,000 --> 0:12:59,000
of this very complex and beautiful shape.

264
0:13:00.09,000 --> 0:13:02,000
One small part of this E8 shape can be used to describe

265
0:13:02.89,000 --> 0:13:04,000
the curved space-time of Einstein's general relativity,

266
0:13:05.53,000 --> 0:13:06,000
explaining gravity.

267
0:13:07.53,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Together with quantum mechanics,

268
0:13:09.25,000 --> 0:13:11,000
the geometry of this shape could describe everything

269
0:13:11.73,000 --> 0:13:13,000
about how the universe works at the tiniest scales.

270
0:13:14.37,000 --> 0:13:18,000
The pattern of this shape living in eight-dimensional charge space

271
0:13:18.69,000 --> 0:13:19,000
is exquisitely beautiful,

272
0:13:21.37,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and it summarizes thousands of possible interactions

273
0:13:23.85,000 --> 0:13:24,000
between these elementary particles,

274
0:13:25.57,000 --> 0:13:27,000
each of which is just a facet of this complicated shape.

275
0:13:29.81,000 --> 0:13:31,000
As we spin it, we can see many of the other intricate patterns

276
0:13:32.77,000 --> 0:13:33,000
contained in this one.

277
0:13:35.81,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And with a particular rotation,

278
0:13:37.61,000 --> 0:13:41,000
we can look down through this pattern in eight dimensions along a symmetry axis

279
0:13:41.81,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and see all the particles at once.

280
0:13:43.65,000 --> 0:13:44,000
It's a very beautiful object,

281
0:13:45.25,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and as with any unification,

282
0:13:47.65,000 --> 0:13:5,000
we can see some holes where new particles are required by this pattern.

283
0:13:52.17,000 --> 0:13:54,000
There are 20 gaps where new particles should be,

284
0:13:54.93,000 --> 0:13:56,000
two of which have been filled by the Pati-Salam particles.

285
0:13:57.69,000 --> 0:14:,000
From their location in this pattern, we know that these new particles

286
0:14:00.97,000 --> 0:14:02,000
should be scalar fields like the Higgs particle,

287
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:05,000
but have color charge and interact with the strong force.

288
0:14:06.57,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Filling in these new particles completes this pattern,

289
0:14:09.13,000 --> 0:14:1,000
giving us the full E8.

290
0:14:10.49,000 --> 0:14:13,000
This E8 pattern has very deep mathematical roots.

291
0:14:13.53,000 --> 0:14:16,000
It's considered by many to be the most beautiful structure in mathematics.

292
0:14:17.61,000 --> 0:14:21,000
It's a fantastic prospect that this object of great mathematical beauty

293
0:14:21.77,000 --> 0:14:23,000
could describe the truth of particle interactions

294
0:14:24.13,000 --> 0:14:25,000
at the smallest scales imaginable.

295
0:14:28.05,000 --> 0:14:31,000
And this idea that nature is described by mathematics is not at all new.

296
0:14:32.01,000 --> 0:14:34,000
In 1623, Galileo wrote this:

297
0:14:35.69,000 --> 0:14:38,000
"Nature's grand book, which stands continually open to our gaze,

298
0:14:39.41,000 --> 0:14:41,000
is written in the language of mathematics.

299
0:14:41.93,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Its characters are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures,

300
0:14:45.57,000 --> 0:14:48,000
without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it;

301
0:14:49.45,000 --> 0:14:52,000
without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth."

302
0:14:53.89,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I believe this to be true,

303
0:14:55.77,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and I've tried to follow Galileo's guidance

304
0:14:57.81,000 --> 0:14:59,000
in describing the mathematics of particle physics

305
0:15:00.17,000 --> 0:15:03,000
using only triangles, circles and other geometrical figures.

306
0:15:03.57,000 --> 0:15:06,000
Of course, when other physicists and I actually work on this stuff,

307
0:15:07.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
the mathematics can resemble a dark labyrinth.

308
0:15:11.25,000 --> 0:15:13,000
But it's reassuring that at the heart of this mathematics

309
0:15:14.13,000 --> 0:15:15,000
is pure, beautiful geometry.

310
0:15:17.77,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Joined with quantum mechanics,

311
0:15:19.25,000 --> 0:15:22,000
this mathematics describes our universe as a growing E8 coral,

312
0:15:23.21,000 --> 0:15:26,000
with particles interacting at every location in all possible ways

313
0:15:26.85,000 --> 0:15:27,000
according to a beautiful pattern.

314
0:15:29.89,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And as more of the pattern comes into view using new machines

315
0:15:32.81,000 --> 0:15:33,000
like the Large Hadron Collider,

316
0:15:34.65,000 --> 0:15:38,000
we may be able to see whether nature uses this E8 pattern or a different one.

317
0:15:40.09,000 --> 0:15:43,000
This process of discovery is a wonderful adventure to be involved in.

318
0:15:44.01,000 --> 0:15:47,000
If the LHC finds particles that fit this E8 pattern,

319
0:15:47.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
that will be very, very cool.

320
0:15:50.29,000 --> 0:15:53,000
If the LHC finds new particles, but they don't fit this pattern --

321
0:15:53.45,000 --> 0:15:57,000
well, that will be very interesting, but bad for this E8 theory.

322
0:15:57.97,000 --> 0:15:59,000
And, of course, bad for me personally.

323
0:16:00.49,000 --> 0:16:02,000
(Laughter)

324
0:16:02.69,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Now, how bad would that be?

325
0:16:04.49,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Well, pretty bad.

326
0:16:06.61,000 --> 0:16:08,000
(Laughter)

327
0:16:09.73,000 --> 0:16:11,000
But predicting how nature works is a very risky game.

328
0:16:13.53,000 --> 0:16:15,000
This theory and others like it are long shots.

329
0:16:17.41,000 --> 0:16:19,000
One does a lot of hard work knowing that most of these ideas

330
0:16:20.29,000 --> 0:16:22,000
probably won't end up being true about nature.

331
0:16:22.49,000 --> 0:16:24,000
That's what doing theoretical physics is like:

332
0:16:24.69,000 --> 0:16:25,000
there are a lot of wipeouts.

333
0:16:26.13,000 --> 0:16:29,000
In this regard, new physics theories are a lot like start-up companies.

334
0:16:31.69,000 --> 0:16:32,000
As with any large investment,

335
0:16:33.13,000 --> 0:16:35,000
it can be emotionally difficult to abandon a line of research

336
0:16:36.05,000 --> 0:16:37,000
when it isn't working out.

337
0:16:37.37,000 --> 0:16:39,000
But in science, if something isn't working,

338
0:16:39.45,000 --> 0:16:41,000
you have to toss it out and try something else.

339
0:16:42.49,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Now, the only way to maintain sanity

340
0:16:44.25,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and achieve happiness in the midst of this uncertainty

341
0:16:46.89,000 --> 0:16:48,000
is to keep balance and perspective in life.

342
0:16:50.77,000 --> 0:16:52,000
I've tried the best I can to live a balanced life.

343
0:16:53.33,000 --> 0:16:54,000
(Laughter)

344
0:16:55.89,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I try to balance my life equally between physics, love and surfing --

345
0:16:59.49,000 --> 0:17:,000
my own three charge directions.

346
0:17:01.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
(Laughter)

347
0:17:03.49,000 --> 0:17:05,000
This way, even if the physics I work on comes to nothing,

348
0:17:06.21,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I still know I've lived a good life.

349
0:17:08.57,000 --> 0:17:09,000
And I try to live in beautiful places.

350
0:17:10.49,000 --> 0:17:13,000
For most of the past ten years I've lived on the island of Maui,

351
0:17:13.57,000 --> 0:17:14,000
a very beautiful place.

352
0:17:15.17,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Now, it's one of the greatest mysteries in the universe to my parents

353
0:17:18.89,000 --> 0:17:19,000
how I managed to survive all that time

354
0:17:20.77,000 --> 0:17:22,000
without engaging in anything resembling full-time employment.

355
0:17:23.689,000 --> 0:17:24,000
(Laughter)

356
0:17:27.29,000 --> 0:17:28,000
I'm going to let you in on that secret.

357
0:17:30.689,000 --> 0:17:32,000
This was a view from my home office on Maui.

358
0:17:34.89,000 --> 0:17:35,000
And this is another,

359
0:17:38.05,000 --> 0:17:39,000
and another.

360
0:17:39.49,000 --> 0:17:42,000
And you may have noticed that these beautiful views are similar,

361
0:17:42.53,000 --> 0:17:43,000
but in slightly different places.

362
0:17:44.97,000 --> 0:17:47,000
That's because this used to be my home and office on Maui.

363
0:17:48.41,000 --> 0:17:49,000
(Laughter)

364
0:17:50.21,000 --> 0:17:51,000
I've chosen a very unusual life.

365
0:17:53.05,000 --> 0:17:54,000
But not worrying about rent

366
0:17:54.41,000 --> 0:17:56,000
allowed me to spend my time doing what I love.

367
0:17:57.29,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Living a nomadic existence has been hard at times,

368
0:17:59.85,000 --> 0:18:01,000
but it's allowed me to live in beautiful places

369
0:18:02.09,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and keep a balance in my life that I've been happy with.

370
0:18:05.09,000 --> 0:18:09,000
It allows me to spend a lot of my time hanging out with hyperintelligent coral.

371
0:18:11.21,000 --> 0:18:14,000
But I also greatly enjoy the company of hyperintelligent people.

372
0:18:14.37,000 --> 0:18:16,000
So I'm very happy to have been invited here to TED.

373
0:18:17.65,000 --> 0:18:18,000
Thank you very much.

374
0:18:18.89,000 --> 0:18:24,000
(Applause)

375
0:18:25.53,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Chris Anderson: Stay here one second.

376
0:18:27.34,000 --> 0:18:3,000
(Applause)

377
0:18:30.946,000 --> 0:18:32,000
I probably understood two percent of that,

378
0:18:32.97,000 --> 0:18:33,000
but I still absolutely loved it.

379
0:18:36.57,000 --> 0:18:37,000
So I'm going to sound dumb.

380
0:18:38.21,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Your theory of everything --

381
0:18:40.57,000 --> 0:18:41,000
Garrett Lisi: I'm used to coral.

382
0:18:42.17,000 --> 0:18:43,000
CA: That's right.

383
0:18:43.45,000 --> 0:18:45,000
The reason it's got a few people at least excited

384
0:18:45.81,000 --> 0:18:49,000
is because, if you're right, it brings gravity and quantum theory together.

385
0:18:50.21,000 --> 0:18:53,000
So are you saying that we should think of the universe, at its heart --

386
0:18:54.05,000 --> 0:18:56,000
that the smallest things that there are,

387
0:18:56.77,000 --> 0:19:02,000
are somehow an E8 object of possibility?

388
0:19:02.97,000 --> 0:19:05,000
I mean, is there a scale to it, at the smallest scale, or ...?

389
0:19:06.01,000 --> 0:19:08,000
GL: Well, right now the pattern I showed you

390
0:19:08.89,000 --> 0:19:12,000
that corresponds to what we know about elementary particle physics --

391
0:19:13.53,000 --> 0:19:15,000
that already corresponds to a very beautiful shape.

392
0:19:15.97,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And that's the one that I said we knew for certain.

393
0:19:18.41,000 --> 0:19:21,000
And that shape has remarkable similarities --

394
0:19:21.53,000 --> 0:19:24,000
and the way it fits into this E8 pattern, which could be the rest of the picture.

395
0:19:26.45,000 --> 0:19:29,000
And these patterns of points that I've shown for you

396
0:19:29.93,000 --> 0:19:32,000
actually represent symmetries of this high-dimensional object

397
0:19:33.77,000 --> 0:19:35,000
that would be warping and moving and dancing

398
0:19:36.57,000 --> 0:19:38,000
over the space-time that we experience.

399
0:19:38.69,000 --> 0:19:41,000
And that would be what explains all these elementary particles that we see.

400
0:19:42.37,000 --> 0:19:45,000
CA: But a string theorist, as I understand it,

401
0:19:45.77,000 --> 0:19:48,000
explains electrons in terms of much smaller strings vibrating --

402
0:19:48.81,000 --> 0:19:51,000
I know, you don't like string theory -- vibrating inside it.

403
0:19:52.13,000 --> 0:19:56,000
How should we think of an electron in relation to E8?

404
0:19:56.97,000 --> 0:19:59,000
GL: Well, it would be one of the symmetries of this E8 shape.

405
0:20:01.13,000 --> 0:20:06,000
So what's happening is, as the shape is moving over space-time, it's twisting.

406
0:20:06.53,000 --> 0:20:1,000
And the direction it's twisting as it moves is what particle we see.

407
0:20:11.01,000 --> 0:20:12,000
So it would be --

408
0:20:12.25,000 --> 0:20:15,000
CA: The size of the E8 shape, how does that relate to the electron?

409
0:20:15.45,000 --> 0:20:18,000
I feel like I need that for my picture. Is it bigger? Is it smaller?

410
0:20:18.69,000 --> 0:20:2,000
GL: As far as we know, electrons are point particles,

411
0:20:21.191,000 --> 0:20:23,000
so this would be going down to the smallest possible scales.

412
0:20:24.05,000 --> 0:20:27,000
So the way these things are explained in quantum field theory is,

413
0:20:27.89,000 --> 0:20:29,000
all possibilities are expanding and developing at once.

414
0:20:30.57,000 --> 0:20:32,000
And this is why I use the analogy to coral.

415
0:20:33.53,000 --> 0:20:34,000
And --

416
0:20:35.93,000 --> 0:20:39,000
in this way, the way that E8 comes in

417
0:20:40.25,000 --> 0:20:44,000
is it will be as a shape that's attached at each point in the space-time.

418
0:20:45.61,000 --> 0:20:48,000
And, as I said, the way the shape twists --

419
0:20:49.09,000 --> 0:20:51,000
the directional along which way the shape is twisting

420
0:20:51.61,000 --> 0:20:53,000
as it moves over this curved surface --

421
0:20:53.69,000 --> 0:20:55,000
is what the elementary particles are, themselves.

422
0:20:56.49,000 --> 0:20:58,000
So through quantum field theory,

423
0:20:59.17,000 --> 0:21:02,000
they manifest themselves as points and interact that way.

424
0:21:02.41,000 --> 0:21:04,000
I don't know if I'll be able to make this any clearer.

425
0:21:04.97,000 --> 0:21:06,000
(Laughter)

426
0:21:07.93,000 --> 0:21:08,000
CA: It doesn't really matter.

427
0:21:09.37,000 --> 0:21:11,000
It's evoking a kind of sense of wonder,

428
0:21:11.41,000 --> 0:21:15,000
and I certainly want to understand more of this.

429
0:21:16.21,000 --> 0:21:19,000
But thank you so much for coming. That was absolutely fascinating.

430
0:21:19.37,000 --> 0:21:2,000
(Applause)

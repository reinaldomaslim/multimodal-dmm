1
0:00:13.875,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The world today has many problems.

2
0:00:16.625,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And they're all very complicated and interconnected and difficult.

3
0:00:22.167,000 --> 0:00:24,000
But there is something we can do.

4
0:00:24.625,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I believe

5
0:00:25.917,000 --> 0:00:29,000
that girls' education is the closest thing we have to a silver bullet

6
0:00:30.708,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to help solve some of the world's most difficult problems.

7
0:00:35.125,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But you don't have to take my word for it.

8
0:00:37.25,000 --> 0:00:38,000
The World Bank says

9
0:00:38.958,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that girls' education is one of the best investments

10
0:00:42.25,000 --> 0:00:44,000
that a country can make.

11
0:00:44.292,000 --> 0:00:46,000
It helps to positively impact

12
0:00:46.417,000 --> 0:00:49,000
nine of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.

13
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Everything from health, nutrition, employment --

14
0:00:54.458,000 --> 0:00:57,000
all of these are positively impacted when girls are educated.

15
0:00:59.667,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Additionally, climate scientists have recently rated girls' education

16
0:01:04.833,000 --> 0:01:09,000
at number six out of 80 actions to reverse global warming.

17
0:01:10.583,000 --> 0:01:15,000
At number six, it's rated higher than solar panels and electric cars.

18
0:01:17.542,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And that's because when girls are educated,

19
0:01:20.417,000 --> 0:01:21,000
they have smaller families,

20
0:01:22.25,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and the resulting reduction in population

21
0:01:25.667,000 --> 0:01:28,000
reduces carbon emissions significantly.

22
0:01:30.5,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But more than that, you know, it's a problem we have to solve once.

23
0:01:34.75,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Because an educated mother is more than twice as likely

24
0:01:39.083,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to educate her children.

25
0:01:41.125,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Which means that by doing it once,

26
0:01:43.167,000 --> 0:01:47,000
we can close the gender and literacy gap forever.

27
0:01:47.25,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I work in India,

28
0:01:48.708,000 --> 0:01:5,000
which has made incredible progress

29
0:01:51.583,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in bringing elementary education for all.

30
0:01:54.833,000 --> 0:01:58,000
However, we still have four million out-of-school girls,

31
0:01:58.875,000 --> 0:01:59,000
one of the highest in the world.

32
0:02:01.917,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And girls are out of school because of, obviously poverty,

33
0:02:05.625,000 --> 0:02:07,000
social, cultural factors.

34
0:02:07.917,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But there's also this underlying factor of mindset.

35
0:02:12.25,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I have met a girl whose name was Naraaz Nath.

36
0:02:15.625,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Naaraaz means angry.

37
0:02:17.833,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And when I asked her, "Why is your name 'angry'?"

38
0:02:20.333,000 --> 0:02:24,000
she said, "Because everybody was so angry when a girl was born."

39
0:02:26.125,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Another girl called Antim Bala,

40
0:02:28.625,000 --> 0:02:3,000
which means the last girl.

41
0:02:30.917,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Because everybody hoped that would be the last girl to be born.

42
0:02:35.625,000 --> 0:02:36,000
A girl called Aachuki.

43
0:02:38.292,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It means somebody who has arrived.

44
0:02:40.375,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Not wanted, but arrived.

45
0:02:43.667,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And it is this mindset

46
0:02:45.833,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that keeps girls from school or completing their education.

47
0:02:49.458,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It's this belief that a goat is an asset

48
0:02:52.167,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and a girl is a liability.

49
0:02:56.667,000 --> 0:02:59,000
My organization Educate Girls works to change this.

50
0:03:00.167,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And we work in some of the most difficult, rural,

51
0:03:03.083,000 --> 0:03:04,000
remote and tribal villages.

52
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And how do we do it?

53
0:03:07.542,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We first and foremost find

54
0:03:09.875,000 --> 0:03:13,000
young, passionate, educated youth from the same villages.

55
0:03:14.083,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Both men and women.

56
0:03:16.458,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And we call them Team Balika,

57
0:03:17.875,000 --> 0:03:18,000
balika just means the girl child,

58
0:03:19.5,000 --> 0:03:21,000
so this is a team that we are creating for the girl child.

59
0:03:23.417,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And so once we recruit our community volunteers,

60
0:03:26.333,000 --> 0:03:29,000
we train them, we mentor them, we hand-hold them.

61
0:03:30.458,000 --> 0:03:31,000
That's when our work starts.

62
0:03:32.042,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And the first piece we do is about identifying every single girl

63
0:03:36.417,000 --> 0:03:38,000
who's not going to school.

64
0:03:38.708,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But the way we do it is a little different and high-tech,

65
0:03:41.958,000 --> 0:03:43,000
at least in my view.

66
0:03:44.292,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Each of our frontline staff have a smartphone.

67
0:03:47.042,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It has its own Educate Girls app.

68
0:03:49.75,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And this app has everything that our team needs.

69
0:03:52.958,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It has digital maps of where they're going to be conducting the survey,

70
0:03:58.458,000 --> 0:04:,000
it has the survey in it, all the questions,

71
0:04:00.792,000 --> 0:04:02,000
little guides on how best to conduct the survey,

72
0:04:03.667,000 --> 0:04:07,000
so that the data that comes to us is in real time and is of good quality.

73
0:04:08.833,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So armed with this,

74
0:04:10.125,000 --> 0:04:13,000
our teams and our volunteers go door-to-door

75
0:04:13.542,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to every single household to find every single girl

76
0:04:17.333,000 --> 0:04:19,000
who may either we never enrolled or dropped out of school.

77
0:04:20.25,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And because we have this data and technology piece,

78
0:04:23.542,000 --> 0:04:26,000
very quickly we can figure out who the girls are and where they are.

79
0:04:27.5,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Because each of our villages are geotagged,

80
0:04:29.958,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and we can actually build that information out

81
0:04:32.375,000 --> 0:04:33,000
very, very quickly.

82
0:04:34.542,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And so once we know where the girls are,

83
0:04:37.167,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we actually start the process of bringing them back into school.

84
0:04:40.917,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And that actually is just our community mobilization process,

85
0:04:43.833,000 --> 0:04:46,000
it starts with village meetings, neighborhood meetings,

86
0:04:47.292,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and as you see, individual counseling of parents and families,

87
0:04:51.25,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to be able to bring the girls back into school.

88
0:04:53.917,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And this can take anything from a few weeks to a few months.

89
0:04:59.625,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And once we bring the girls into the school system,

90
0:05:02.083,000 --> 0:05:03,000
we also work with the schools

91
0:05:03.542,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to make sure that schools have all the basic infrastructure

92
0:05:07.458,000 --> 0:05:08,000
so that the girls will be able to stay.

93
0:05:09.387,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And this would include a separate toilet for girls,

94
0:05:12.208,000 --> 0:05:13,000
drinking water,

95
0:05:13.833,000 --> 0:05:16,000
things that will help them to be retained.

96
0:05:16.875,000 --> 0:05:19,000
But all of this would be useless if our children weren't learning.

97
0:05:20.667,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So we actually run a learning program.

98
0:05:23.583,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And this is a supplementary learning program,

99
0:05:25.708,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and it's very, very important,

100
0:05:28.042,000 --> 0:05:31,000
because most of our children are first-generation learners.

101
0:05:31.917,000 --> 0:05:33,000
That means there's nobody at home to help them with homework,

102
0:05:34.833,000 --> 0:05:36,000
there's nobody who can support their education.

103
0:05:37.083,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Their parents can't read and write.

104
0:05:38.792,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So it's really, really key

105
0:05:40.458,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that we do the support of the learning in the classrooms.

106
0:05:44.625,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So this is essentially our model,

107
0:05:46.542,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in terms of finding, bringing the girls in,

108
0:05:48.875,000 --> 0:05:5,000
making sure that they're staying and learning.

109
0:05:51.5,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And we know that our model works.

110
0:05:54.125,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And we know this because

111
0:05:56.042,000 --> 0:05:59,000
a most recent randomized control evaluation

112
0:05:59.208,000 --> 0:06:,000
confirms its efficacy.

113
0:06:02.792,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Our evaluator found that over a three-year period

114
0:06:06.542,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Educate Girls was able to bring back 92 percent of all out-of-school girls

115
0:06:11.708,000 --> 0:06:12,000
back into school.

116
0:06:13.458,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Applause)

117
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And in terms of learning,

118
0:06:21.458,000 --> 0:06:23,000
our children's learning went up significantly

119
0:06:24.125,000 --> 0:06:26,000
as compared to control schools.

120
0:06:26.25,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So much so, that it was like an additional year of schooling

121
0:06:30.167,000 --> 0:06:31,000
for the average student.

122
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:33,000
And that's enormous,

123
0:06:33.417,000 --> 0:06:36,000
when you think about a tribal child who's entering the school system

124
0:06:36.792,000 --> 0:06:37,000
for the first time.

125
0:06:39.042,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So here we have a model that works;

126
0:06:41.458,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we know it's scalable,

127
0:06:43.458,000 --> 0:06:46,000
because we are already functioning at 13,000 villages.

128
0:06:47.125,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We know it's smart,

129
0:06:48.458,000 --> 0:06:5,000
because of the use of data and technology.

130
0:06:51.417,000 --> 0:06:53,000
We know that it's sustainable and systemic,

131
0:06:54.208,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because we work in partnership with the community,

132
0:06:57.208,000 --> 0:06:59,000
it's actually led by the community.

133
0:06:59.417,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And we work in partnership with the government,

134
0:07:01.667,000 --> 0:07:03,000
so there's no creation of a parallel delivery system.

135
0:07:05.417,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And so because we have this innovative partnership

136
0:07:08.667,000 --> 0:07:11,000
with the community, the government, this smart model,

137
0:07:12.583,000 --> 0:07:15,000
we have this big, audacious dream today.

138
0:07:17.042,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And that is to solve a full 40 percent of the problem

139
0:07:20.875,000 --> 0:07:23,000
of out-of-school girls in India in the next five years.

140
0:07:24.958,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Applause)

141
0:07:31.375,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And you're thinking, that's a little ...

142
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:37,000
You know, how am I even thinking about doing that,

143
0:07:37.042,000 --> 0:07:4,000
because India is not a small place, it's a huge country.

144
0:07:42.042,000 --> 0:07:44,000
It's a country of over a billion people.

145
0:07:44.583,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We have 650,000 villages.

146
0:07:48.542,000 --> 0:07:49,000
How is it that I'm standing here,

147
0:07:50.208,000 --> 0:07:51,000
saying that one small organization

148
0:07:52.208,000 --> 0:07:55,000
is going to solve a full 40 percent of the problem?

149
0:07:56.125,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And that's because we have a key insight.

150
0:07:58.75,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And that is,

151
0:08:00.042,000 --> 0:08:04,000
because of our entire approach, with data and with technology,

152
0:08:04.542,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that five percent of villages in India

153
0:08:07.25,000 --> 0:08:1,000
have 40 percent of the out-of-school girls.

154
0:08:10.292,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And this is a big, big piece of the puzzle.

155
0:08:13.083,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Which means, I don't have to work across the entire country.

156
0:08:16.292,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I have to work in those five percent of the villages,

157
0:08:19.458,000 --> 0:08:21,000
about 35,000 villages,

158
0:08:21.542,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to actually be able to solve a large piece of the problem.

159
0:08:25.875,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And that's really key,

160
0:08:27.167,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because these villages

161
0:08:29.583,000 --> 0:08:32,000
not only have high burden of out-of-school girls,

162
0:08:32.75,000 --> 0:08:34,000
but also a lot of related indicators, right,

163
0:08:35.625,000 --> 0:08:4,000
like malnutrition, stunting, poverty, infant mortality,

164
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:42,000
child marriage.

165
0:08:42.708,000 --> 0:08:43,000
So by working and focusing here,

166
0:08:44.667,000 --> 0:08:46,000
you can actually create a large multiplier effect

167
0:08:47.167,000 --> 0:08:49,000
across all of these indicators.

168
0:08:49.792,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And it would mean

169
0:08:51.082,000 --> 0:08:55,000
that we would be able to bring back 1.6 million girls back into school.

170
0:08:56.792,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Applause)

171
0:09:03.75,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I have to say, I have been doing this for over a decade,

172
0:09:07.208,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and I have never met a girl who said to me,

173
0:09:12.042,000 --> 0:09:13,000
you know, "I want to stay at home,"

174
0:09:13.792,000 --> 0:09:14,000
"I want to graze the cattle,"

175
0:09:15.208,000 --> 0:09:17,000
"I want to look after the siblings,"

176
0:09:17.5,000 --> 0:09:19,000
"I want to be a child bride."

177
0:09:19.542,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Every single girl I meet wants to go to school.

178
0:09:24.917,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And that's what we really want to do.

179
0:09:26.917,000 --> 0:09:3,000
We want to be able to fulfill those 1.6 million dreams.

180
0:09:32.625,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And it doesn't take much.

181
0:09:33.958,000 --> 0:09:36,000
To find and enroll a girl with our model is about 20 dollars.

182
0:09:37.917,000 --> 0:09:4,000
To make sure that she is learning and providing a learning program,

183
0:09:41.125,000 --> 0:09:43,000
it's another 40 dollars.

184
0:09:43.417,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But today is the time to do it.

185
0:09:45.583,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Because she is truly the biggest asset we have.

186
0:09:49.75,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I am Safeena Husain, and I educate girls.

187
0:09:53.125,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Thank you.

188
0:09:54.417,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
What I want to talk to you about today is

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:37,000
virtual worlds, digital globes, the 3-D Web, the Metaverse.

3
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:39,000
What does this all mean for us?

4
0:00:39,000 --> 0:00:44,000
What it means is the Web is going to become an exciting place again.

5
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
It's going to become super exciting as we transform

6
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:51,000
to this highly immersive and interactive world.

7
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
With graphics, computing power, low latencies,

8
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:57,000
these types of applications and possibilities

9
0:00:57,000 --> 0:01:02,000
are going to stream rich data into your lives.

10
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So the Virtual Earth initiative, and other types of these initiatives,

11
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:13,000
are all about extending our current search metaphor.

12
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
When you think about it, we're so constrained by browsing the Web,

13
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
remembering URLs, saving favorites.

14
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:22,000
As we move to search, we rely on the relevance rankings,

15
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
the Web matching, the index crawling.

16
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But we want to use our brain!

17
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:3,000
We want to navigate, explore, discover information.

18
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In order to do that, we have to put you as a user back in the driver's seat.

19
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We need cooperation between you and the computing network and the computer.

20
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So what better way to put you back in the driver's seat

21
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
than to put you in the real world that you interact in every day?

22
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Why not leverage the learnings that you've been learning your entire life?

23
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So Virtual Earth is about starting off

24
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:58,000
creating the first digital representation, comprehensive, of the entire world.

25
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
What we want to do is mix in all types of data.

26
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Tag it. Attribute it. Metadata. Get the community to add local depth,

27
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
global perspective, local knowledge.

28
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So when you think about this problem,

29
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:15,000
what an enormous undertaking. Where do you begin?

30
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Well, we collect data from satellites, from airplanes,

31
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:22,000
from ground vehicles, from people.

32
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This process is an engineering problem,

33
0:02:27,000 --> 0:02:31,000
a mechanical problem, a logistical problem, an operational problem.

34
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Here is an example of our aerial camera.

35
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
This is panchromatic. It's actually four color cones.

36
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
In addition, it's multi-spectral.

37
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:42,000
We collect four gigabits per second of data,

38
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:44,000
if you can imagine that kind of data stream coming down.

39
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:5,000
That's equivalent to a constellation of 12 satellites at highest res capacity.

40
0:02:5,000 --> 0:02:54,000
We fly these airplanes at 5,000 feet in the air.

41
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:57,000
You can see the camera on the front. We collect multiple viewpoints,

42
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:03,000
vantage points, angles, textures. We bring all that data back in.

43
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:07,000
We sit here -- you know, think about the ground vehicles, the human scale --

44
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:09,000
what do you see in person? We need to capture that up close

45
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to establish that what it's like-type experience.

46
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I bet many of you have seen the Apple commercials,

47
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:23,000
kind of poking at the PC for their brilliance and simplicity.

48
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So a little unknown secret is --

49
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:29,000
did you see the one with the guy, he's got the Web cam?

50
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:33,000
The poor PC guy. They're duct taping his head. They're just wrapping it on him.

51
0:03:33,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Well, a little unknown secret is his brother actually works on the Virtual Earth team.

52
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter). So they've got a little bit of a sibling rivalry thing going on here.

53
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But let me tell you -- it doesn't affect his day job.

54
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We think a lot of good can come from this technology.

55
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:51,000
This was after Katrina. We were the first commercial fleet of airplanes

56
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to be cleared into the disaster impact zone.

57
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We flew the area. We imaged it. We sent in people. We took pictures of interiors,

58
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:03,000
disaster areas. We helped with the first responders, the search and rescue.

59
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Often the first time anyone saw what happened to their house was on Virtual Earth.

60
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We made it all freely available on the Web, just to --

61
0:04:1,000 --> 0:04:14,000
it was obviously our chance of helping out with the cause.

62
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:17,000
When we think about how all this comes together,

63
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:21,000
it's all about software, algorithms and math.

64
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:24,000
You know, we capture this imagery but to build the 3-D models

65
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:29,000
we need to do geo-positioning. We need to do geo-registering of the images.

66
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We have to bundle adjust them. Find tie points.

67
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Extract geometry from the images.

68
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This process is a very calculated process.

69
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:39,000
In fact, it was always done manual.

70
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Hollywood would spend millions of dollars to do a small urban corridor

71
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:46,000
for a movie because they'd have to do it manually.

72
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
They'd drive the streets with lasers called LIDAR.

73
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:52,000
They'd collected information with photos. They'd manually build each building.

74
0:04:52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We do this all through software, algorithms and math --

75
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
a highly automated pipeline creating these cities.

76
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
We took a decimal point off what it cost to build these cities,

77
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and that's how we're going to be able to scale this out and make this reality a dream.

78
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We think about the user interface.

79
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:09,000
What does it mean to look at it from multiple perspectives?

80
0:05:09,000 --> 0:05:14,000
An ortho-view, a nadir-view. How do you keep the precision of the fidelity of the imagery

81
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:18,000
while maintaining the fluidity of the model?

82
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I'll wrap up by showing you the --

83
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:24,000
this is a brand-new peek I haven't really shown into the lab area of Virtual Earth.

84
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
What we're doing is -- people like this a lot,

85
0:05:27,000 --> 0:05:3,000
this bird's eye imagery we work with. It's this high resolution data.

86
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But what we've found is they like the fluidity of the 3-D model.

87
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:38,000
A child can navigate with an Xbox controller or a game controller.

88
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So here what we're trying to do is we bring the picture and project it into the 3-D model space.

89
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:49,000
You can see all types of resolution. From here, I can slowly pan the image over.

90
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I can get the next image. I can blend and transition.

91
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:57,000
By doing this I don't lose the original detail. In fact, I might be recording history.

92
0:05:57,000 --> 0:06:,000
The freshness, the capacity. I can turn this image.

93
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I can look at it from multiple viewpoints and angles.

94
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:06,000
What we're trying to do is build a virtual world.

95
0:06:06,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We hope that we can make computing a user model you're familiar with,

96
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and really derive insights from you, from all different directions.

97
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I thank you very much for your time.

98
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Applause)

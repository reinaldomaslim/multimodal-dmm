1
0:00:13.056,000 --> 0:00:16,000
On the path that American children travel to adulthood,

2
0:00:16.971,000 --> 0:00:19,000
two institutions oversee the journey.

3
0:00:20.519,000 --> 0:00:23,000
The first is the one we hear a lot about: college.

4
0:00:24.262,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Some of you may remember the excitement that you felt

5
0:00:26.845,000 --> 0:00:28,000
when you first set off for college.

6
0:00:29.431,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Some of you may be in college right now

7
0:00:31.983,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and you're feeling this excitement at this very moment.

8
0:00:35.988,000 --> 0:00:36,000
College has some shortcomings.

9
0:00:37.667,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's expensive; it leaves young people in debt.

10
0:00:41.003,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But all in all, it's a pretty good path.

11
0:00:43.947,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Young people emerge from college with pride and with great friends

12
0:00:49.114,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and with a lot of knowledge about the world.

13
0:00:51.453,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And perhaps most importantly,

14
0:00:53.289,000 --> 0:00:57,000
a better chance in the labor market than they had before they got there.

15
0:00:57.795,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Today I want to talk about the second institution

16
0:01:00.498,000 --> 0:01:05,000
overseeing the journey from childhood to adulthood in the United States.

17
0:01:06.056,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And that institution is prison.

18
0:01:10.791,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Young people on this journey are meeting with probation officers

19
0:01:14.536,000 --> 0:01:16,000
instead of with teachers.

20
0:01:16.939,000 --> 0:01:19,000
They're going to court dates instead of to class.

21
0:01:20.832,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Their junior year abroad is instead a trip to a state correctional facility.

22
0:01:25.909,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And they're emerging from their 20s

23
0:01:28.599,000 --> 0:01:31,000
not with degrees in business and English,

24
0:01:31.796,000 --> 0:01:33,000
but with criminal records.

25
0:01:34.514,000 --> 0:01:36,000
This institution is also costing us a lot,

26
0:01:37.107,000 --> 0:01:38,000
about 40,000 dollars a year

27
0:01:38.749,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to send a young person to prison in New Jersey.

28
0:01:43.167,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But here, taxpayers are footing the bill

29
0:01:45.723,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and what kids are getting is a cold prison cell

30
0:01:49.206,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and a permanent mark against them when they come home

31
0:01:52.016,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and apply for work.

32
0:01:54.765,000 --> 0:01:57,000
There are more and more kids on this journey to adulthood

33
0:01:58.211,000 --> 0:02:03,000
than ever before in the United States and that's because in the past 40 years,

34
0:02:03.435,000 --> 0:02:08,000
our incarceration rate has grown by 700 percent.

35
0:02:09.187,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I have one slide for this talk.

36
0:02:11.316,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Here it is.

37
0:02:13.76,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Here's our incarceration rate,

38
0:02:15.623,000 --> 0:02:21,000
about 716 people per 100,000 in the population.

39
0:02:23.205,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Here's the OECD countries.

40
0:02:30.885,000 --> 0:02:32,000
What's more, it's poor kids that we're sending to prison,

41
0:02:33.617,000 --> 0:02:36,000
too many drawn from African-American and Latino communities

42
0:02:37.105,000 --> 0:02:41,000
so that prison now stands firmly between the young people trying to make it

43
0:02:41.986,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and the fulfillment of the American Dream.

44
0:02:45.418,000 --> 0:02:47,000
The problem's actually a bit worse than this

45
0:02:48.274,000 --> 0:02:5,000
'cause we're not just sending poor kids to prison,

46
0:02:50.952,000 --> 0:02:52,000
we're saddling poor kids with court fees,

47
0:02:53.919,000 --> 0:02:55,000
with probation and parole restrictions,

48
0:02:56.24,000 --> 0:02:57,000
with low-level warrants,

49
0:02:58.127,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we're asking them to live in halfway houses and on house arrest,

50
0:03:01.622,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and we're asking them to negotiate a police force

51
0:03:05.227,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that is entering poor communities of color,

52
0:03:07.64,000 --> 0:03:1,000
not for the purposes of promoting public safety,

53
0:03:10.839,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but to make arrest counts, to line city coffers.

54
0:03:18.537,000 --> 0:03:22,000
This is the hidden underside to our historic experiment in punishment:

55
0:03:22.925,000 --> 0:03:27,000
young people worried that at any moment, they will be stopped, searched and seized.

56
0:03:28.635,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Not just in the streets, but in their homes,

57
0:03:31.258,000 --> 0:03:33,000
at school and at work.

58
0:03:34.925,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I got interested in this other path to adulthood

59
0:03:38.116,000 --> 0:03:4,000
when I was myself a college student

60
0:03:40.357,000 --> 0:03:42,000
attending the University of Pennsylvania

61
0:03:42.415,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in the early 2000s.

62
0:03:44.493,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Penn sits within a historic African-American neighborhood.

63
0:03:48.06,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So you've got these two parallel journeys going on simultaneously:

64
0:03:53.298,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the kids attending this elite, private university,

65
0:03:56.419,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and the kids from the adjacent neighborhood,

66
0:03:58.885,000 --> 0:03:59,000
some of whom are making it to college,

67
0:04:00.813,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and many of whom are being shipped to prison.

68
0:04:04.831,000 --> 0:04:08,000
In my sophomore year, I started tutoring a young woman who was in high school

69
0:04:09.415,000 --> 0:04:11,000
who lived about 10 minutes away from the university.

70
0:04:12.409,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Soon, her cousin came home from a juvenile detention center.

71
0:04:15.942,000 --> 0:04:17,000
He was 15, a freshman in high school.

72
0:04:18.6,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I began to get to know him and his friends and family,

73
0:04:22.259,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and I asked him what he thought about me writing about his life

74
0:04:25.611,000 --> 0:04:27,000
for my senior thesis in college.

75
0:04:28.196,000 --> 0:04:32,000
This senior thesis became a dissertation at Princeton

76
0:04:32.387,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and now a book.

77
0:04:33.935,000 --> 0:04:34,000
By the end of my sophomore year,

78
0:04:35.533,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I moved into the neighborhood and I spent the next six years

79
0:04:38.903,000 --> 0:04:42,000
trying to understand what young people were facing as they came of age.

80
0:04:44.234,000 --> 0:04:46,000
The first week I spent in this neighborhood,

81
0:04:46.318,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I saw two boys, five and seven years old,

82
0:04:48.894,000 --> 0:04:49,000
play this game of chase,

83
0:04:50.386,000 --> 0:04:52,000
where the older boy ran after the other boy.

84
0:04:53.337,000 --> 0:04:54,000
He played the cop.

85
0:04:54.532,000 --> 0:04:56,000
When the cop caught up to the younger boy,

86
0:04:56.72,000 --> 0:04:57,000
he pushed him down,

87
0:04:58.42,000 --> 0:05:,000
handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs,

88
0:05:00.971,000 --> 0:05:02,000
took a quarter out of the other child's pocket,

89
0:05:03.282,000 --> 0:05:06,000
saying, "I'm seizing that."

90
0:05:06.874,000 --> 0:05:09,000
He asked the child if he was carrying any drugs

91
0:05:10.214,000 --> 0:05:12,000
or if he had a warrant.

92
0:05:12.659,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Many times, I saw this game repeated,

93
0:05:14.664,000 --> 0:05:16,000
sometimes children would simply give up running,

94
0:05:17.052,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and stick their bodies flat against the ground

95
0:05:19.248,000 --> 0:05:22,000
with their hands above their heads, or flat up against a wall.

96
0:05:22.593,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Children would yell at each other,

97
0:05:24.588,000 --> 0:05:25,000
"I'm going to lock you up,

98
0:05:25.87,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I'm going to lock you up and you're never coming home!"

99
0:05:29.052,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Once I saw a six-year-old child pull another child's pants down

100
0:05:33.406,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and try to do a cavity search.

101
0:05:36.756,000 --> 0:05:39,000
In the first 18 months that I lived in this neighborhood,

102
0:05:39.935,000 --> 0:05:42,000
I wrote down every time I saw any contact between police

103
0:05:43.627,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and people that were my neighbors.

104
0:05:46.553,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So in the first 18 months,

105
0:05:48.652,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I watched the police stop pedestrians or people in cars,

106
0:05:52.421,000 --> 0:05:54,000
search people, run people's names,

107
0:05:54.589,000 --> 0:05:55,000
chase people through the streets,

108
0:05:56.533,000 --> 0:05:57,000
pull people in for questioning,

109
0:05:58.306,000 --> 0:06:02,000
or make an arrest every single day, with five exceptions.

110
0:06:03.142,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Fifty-two times, I watched the police break down doors,

111
0:06:07.077,000 --> 0:06:09,000
chase people through houses

112
0:06:09.118,000 --> 0:06:12,000
or make an arrest of someone in their home.

113
0:06:12.337,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Fourteen times in this first year and a half,

114
0:06:15.15,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I watched the police punch, choke, kick, stomp on or beat young men

115
0:06:20.45,000 --> 0:06:22,000
after they had caught them.

116
0:06:24.289,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Bit by bit, I got to know two brothers,

117
0:06:26.665,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Chuck and Tim.

118
0:06:28.209,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Chuck was 18 when we met, a senior in high school.

119
0:06:31.25,000 --> 0:06:34,000
He was playing on the basketball team and making C's and B's.

120
0:06:34.798,000 --> 0:06:35,000
His younger brother, Tim, was 10.

121
0:06:36.697,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And Tim loved Chuck; he followed him around a lot,

122
0:06:39.848,000 --> 0:06:41,000
looked to Chuck to be a mentor.

123
0:06:42.139,000 --> 0:06:44,000
They lived with their mom and grandfather

124
0:06:44.285,000 --> 0:06:47,000
in a two-story row home with a front lawn and a back porch.

125
0:06:47.724,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Their mom was struggling with addiction all while the boys were growing up.

126
0:06:51.385,000 --> 0:06:54,000
She never really was able to hold down a job for very long.

127
0:06:55.242,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It was their grandfather's pension that supported the family,

128
0:06:58.281,000 --> 0:07:01,000
not really enough to pay for food and clothes

129
0:07:01.484,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and school supplies for growing boys.

130
0:07:04.215,000 --> 0:07:06,000
The family was really struggling.

131
0:07:06.401,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So when we met, Chuck was a senior in high school.

132
0:07:08.78,000 --> 0:07:1,000
He had just turned 18.

133
0:07:11.628,000 --> 0:07:14,000
That winter, a kid in the schoolyard

134
0:07:14.77,000 --> 0:07:17,000
called Chuck's mom a crack whore.

135
0:07:18.029,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Chuck pushed the kid's face into the snow

136
0:07:20.904,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and the school cops charged him with aggravated assault.

137
0:07:24.729,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The other kid was fine the next day,

138
0:07:26.479,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I think it was his pride that was injured more than anything.

139
0:07:29.952,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But anyway, since Chuck was 18,

140
0:07:31.665,000 --> 0:07:34,000
this agg. assault case sent him to adult county jail

141
0:07:34.853,000 --> 0:07:36,000
on State Road in northeast Philadelphia,

142
0:07:37.278,000 --> 0:07:41,000
where he sat, unable to pay the bail -- he couldn't afford it --

143
0:07:41.345,000 --> 0:07:44,000
while the trial dates dragged on and on and on

144
0:07:44.544,000 --> 0:07:46,000
through almost his entire senior year.

145
0:07:47.926,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Finally, near the end of this season,

146
0:07:50.976,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the judge on this assault case threw out most of the charges

147
0:07:54.323,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and Chuck came home

148
0:07:55.657,000 --> 0:07:59,000
with only a few hundred dollars' worth of court fees hanging over his head.

149
0:08:00.004,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Tim was pretty happy that day.

150
0:08:02.547,000 --> 0:08:04,000
The next fall, Chuck tried to re-enroll as a senior,

151
0:08:05.301,000 --> 0:08:07,000
but the school secretary told him that

152
0:08:07.315,000 --> 0:08:1,000
he was then 19 and too old to be readmitted.

153
0:08:10.446,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Then the judge on his assault case issued him a warrant for his arrest

154
0:08:14.113,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because he couldn't pay the 225 dollars in court fees

155
0:08:17.388,000 --> 0:08:2,000
that came due a few weeks after the case ended.

156
0:08:20.915,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Then he was a high school dropout living on the run.

157
0:08:24.935,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Tim's first arrest came later that year

158
0:08:26.987,000 --> 0:08:27,000
after he turned 11.

159
0:08:28.77,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Chuck had managed to get his warrant lifted

160
0:08:30.9,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and he was on a payment plan for the court fees

161
0:08:33.561,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and he was driving Tim to school in his girlfriend's car.

162
0:08:37.071,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So a cop pulls them over, runs the car,

163
0:08:39.806,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and the car comes up as stolen in California.

164
0:08:43.591,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Chuck had no idea where in the history of this car it had been stolen.

165
0:08:47.714,000 --> 0:08:5,000
His girlfriend's uncle bought it from a used car auction

166
0:08:51.19,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in northeast Philly.

167
0:08:52.657,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Chuck and Tim had never been outside of the tri-state,

168
0:08:55.485,000 --> 0:08:57,000
let alone to California.

169
0:08:57.834,000 --> 0:08:59,000
But anyway, the cops down at the precinct

170
0:08:59.932,000 --> 0:09:02,000
charged Chuck with receiving stolen property.

171
0:09:03.5,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And then a juvenile judge, a few days later,

172
0:09:06.312,000 --> 0:09:08,000
charged Tim, age 11,

173
0:09:08.464,000 --> 0:09:11,000
with accessory to receiving a stolen property

174
0:09:11.537,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and then he was placed on three years of probation.

175
0:09:16.43,000 --> 0:09:18,000
With this probation sentence hanging over his head,

176
0:09:19.332,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Chuck sat his little brother down

177
0:09:21.419,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and began teaching him how to run from the police.

178
0:09:24.868,000 --> 0:09:26,000
They would sit side by side on their back porch

179
0:09:27.2,000 --> 0:09:29,000
looking out into the shared alleyway

180
0:09:29.264,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and Chuck would coach Tim how to spot undercover cars,

181
0:09:33.104,000 --> 0:09:37,000
how to negotiate a late-night police raid, how and where to hide.

182
0:09:39.011,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I want you to imagine for a second

183
0:09:40.691,000 --> 0:09:42,000
what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like

184
0:09:43.06,000 --> 0:09:47,000
if they were living in a neighborhood where kids were going to college,

185
0:09:47.809,000 --> 0:09:48,000
not prison.

186
0:09:49.918,000 --> 0:09:52,000
A neighborhood like the one I got to grow up in.

187
0:09:53.071,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Okay, you might say.

188
0:09:54.536,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But Chuck and Tim, kids like them, they're committing crimes!

189
0:09:58.288,000 --> 0:10:,000
Don't they deserve to be in prison?

190
0:10:00.414,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Don't they deserve to be living in fear of arrest?

191
0:10:04.228,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Well, my answer would be no.

192
0:10:07.35,000 --> 0:10:08,000
They don't.

193
0:10:08.43,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And certainly not for the same things that other young people

194
0:10:11.457,000 --> 0:10:14,000
with more privilege are doing with impunity.

195
0:10:14.901,000 --> 0:10:15,000
If Chuck had gone to my high school,

196
0:10:16.718,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that schoolyard fight would have ended there,

197
0:10:19.041,000 --> 0:10:2,000
as a schoolyard fight.

198
0:10:20.717,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It never would have become an aggravated assault case.

199
0:10:24.937,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Not a single kid that I went to college with

200
0:10:27.758,000 --> 0:10:28,000
has a criminal record right now.

201
0:10:29.437,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Not a single one.

202
0:10:31.311,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But can you imagine how many might have if the police had stopped those kids

203
0:10:35.316,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and searched their pockets for drugs as they walked to class?

204
0:10:39.183,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Or had raided their frat parties in the middle of the night?

205
0:10:44.384,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Okay, you might say.

206
0:10:45.656,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But doesn't this high incarceration rate

207
0:10:47.646,000 --> 0:10:49,000
partly account for our really low crime rate?

208
0:10:50.399,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Crime is down. That's a good thing.

209
0:10:52.823,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Totally, that is a good thing. Crime is down.

210
0:10:55.31,000 --> 0:10:58,000
It dropped precipitously in the '90s and through the 2000s.

211
0:10:58.837,000 --> 0:11:,000
But according to a committee of academics

212
0:11:00.882,000 --> 0:11:03,000
convened by the National Academy of Sciences last year,

213
0:11:04.536,000 --> 0:11:08,000
the relationship between our historically high incarceration rates

214
0:11:08.545,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and our low crime rate is pretty shaky.

215
0:11:12.129,000 --> 0:11:15,000
It turns out that the crime rate goes up and down

216
0:11:15.569,000 --> 0:11:19,000
irrespective of how many young people we send to prison.

217
0:11:21.265,000 --> 0:11:24,000
We tend to think about justice in a pretty narrow way:

218
0:11:24.358,000 --> 0:11:27,000
good and bad, innocent and guilty.

219
0:11:27.962,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Injustice is about being wrongfully convicted.

220
0:11:31.317,000 --> 0:11:33,000
So if you're convicted of something you did do,

221
0:11:33.632,000 --> 0:11:34,000
you should be punished for it.

222
0:11:35.467,000 --> 0:11:36,000
There are innocent and guilty people,

223
0:11:37.233,000 --> 0:11:39,000
there are victims and there are perpetrators.

224
0:11:39.67,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Maybe we could think a little bit more broadly than that.

225
0:11:44.071,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Right now, we're asking kids who live in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods,

226
0:11:48.505,000 --> 0:11:5,000
who have the least amount of family resources,

227
0:11:50.786,000 --> 0:11:52,000
who are attending the country's worst schools,

228
0:11:53.347,000 --> 0:11:55,000
who are facing the toughest time in the labor market,

229
0:11:56.253,000 --> 0:11:59,000
who are living in neighborhoods where violence is an everyday problem,

230
0:11:59.906,000 --> 0:12:03,000
we're asking these kids to walk the thinnest possible line --

231
0:12:04.479,000 --> 0:12:07,000
to basically never do anything wrong.

232
0:12:08.29,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Why are we not providing support to young kids facing these challenges?

233
0:12:12.791,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Why are we offering only handcuffs, jail time and this fugitive existence?

234
0:12:20.037,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Can we imagine something better?

235
0:12:22.543,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Can we imagine a criminal justice system that prioritizes recovery,

236
0:12:26.798,000 --> 0:12:28,000
prevention, civic inclusion,

237
0:12:29.385,000 --> 0:12:31,000
rather than punishment?

238
0:12:32.086,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Applause)

239
0:12:39.855,000 --> 0:12:41,000
A criminal justice system that acknowledges

240
0:12:42.13,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the legacy of exclusion that poor people of color in the U.S. have faced

241
0:12:46.11,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and that does not promote and perpetuate those exclusions.

242
0:12:50.266,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Applause)

243
0:12:55.291,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And finally, a criminal justice system that believes in black young people,

244
0:12:59.853,000 --> 0:13:02,000
rather than treating black young people as the enemy to be rounded up.

245
0:13:03.717,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause)

246
0:13:11.46,000 --> 0:13:13,000
The good news is that we already are.

247
0:13:14.287,000 --> 0:13:18,000
A few years ago, Michelle Alexander wrote "The New Jim Crow,"

248
0:13:19.11,000 --> 0:13:23,000
which got Americans to see incarceration as a civil rights issue

249
0:13:23.123,000 --> 0:13:27,000
of historic proportions in a way they had not seen it before.

250
0:13:27.479,000 --> 0:13:3,000
President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have come out very strongly

251
0:13:31.238,000 --> 0:13:32,000
on sentencing reform,

252
0:13:32.955,000 --> 0:13:35,000
on the need to address racial disparity in incarceration.

253
0:13:36.699,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We're seeing states throw out Stop and Frisk

254
0:13:39.309,000 --> 0:13:42,000
as the civil rights violation that it is.

255
0:13:42.345,000 --> 0:13:47,000
We're seeing cities and states decriminalize possession of marijuana.

256
0:13:47.4,000 --> 0:13:48,000
New York, New Jersey and California

257
0:13:49.257,000 --> 0:13:52,000
have been dropping their prison populations, closing prisons,

258
0:13:53.094,000 --> 0:13:55,000
while also seeing a big drop in crime.

259
0:13:55.375,000 --> 0:13:56,000
Texas has gotten into the game now,

260
0:13:57.068,000 --> 0:14:,000
also closing prisons, investing in education.

261
0:14:00.913,000 --> 0:14:03,000
This curious coalition is building from the right and the left,

262
0:14:04.57,000 --> 0:14:07,000
made up of former prisoners and fiscal conservatives,

263
0:14:08.018,000 --> 0:14:11,000
of civil rights activists and libertarians,

264
0:14:11.349,000 --> 0:14:14,000
of young people taking to the streets to protest police violence

265
0:14:15.329,000 --> 0:14:17,000
against unarmed black teenagers,

266
0:14:18.165,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and older, wealthier people --

267
0:14:20.211,000 --> 0:14:21,000
some of you are here in the audience --

268
0:14:22.082,000 --> 0:14:25,000
pumping big money into decarceration initiatives

269
0:14:27.357,000 --> 0:14:28,000
In a deeply divided Congress,

270
0:14:29.107,000 --> 0:14:31,000
the work of reforming our criminal justice system

271
0:14:31.81,000 --> 0:14:33,000
is just about the only thing that the right and the left

272
0:14:34.602,000 --> 0:14:36,000
are coming together on.

273
0:14:37.187,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I did not think I would see this political moment in my lifetime.

274
0:14:41.102,000 --> 0:14:44,000
I think many of the people who have been working tirelessly

275
0:14:44.71,000 --> 0:14:46,000
to write about the causes and consequences

276
0:14:46.872,000 --> 0:14:48,000
of our historically high incarceration rates

277
0:14:49.104,000 --> 0:14:52,000
did not think we would see this moment in our lifetime.

278
0:14:52.87,000 --> 0:14:55,000
The question for us now is, how much can we make of it?

279
0:14:56.653,000 --> 0:14:58,000
How much can we change?

280
0:14:59.618,000 --> 0:15:01,000
I want to end with a call to young people,

281
0:15:02.182,000 --> 0:15:03,000
the young people attending college

282
0:15:03.816,000 --> 0:15:06,000
and the young people struggling to stay out of prison

283
0:15:06.926,000 --> 0:15:09,000
or to make it through prison and return home.

284
0:15:10.03,000 --> 0:15:14,000
It may seem like these paths to adulthood are worlds apart,

285
0:15:14.063,000 --> 0:15:18,000
but the young people participating in these two institutions

286
0:15:18.505,000 --> 0:15:19,000
conveying us to adulthood,

287
0:15:20.43,000 --> 0:15:22,000
they have one thing in common:

288
0:15:22.995,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Both can be leaders in the work of reforming our criminal justice system.

289
0:15:28.483,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Young people have always been leaders in the fight for equal rights,

290
0:15:31.815,000 --> 0:15:33,000
the fight for more people to be granted dignity

291
0:15:34.08,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and a fighting chance at freedom.

292
0:15:36.635,000 --> 0:15:38,000
The mission for the generation of young people

293
0:15:39.014,000 --> 0:15:43,000
coming of age in this, a sea-change moment, potentially,

294
0:15:43.994,000 --> 0:15:48,000
is to end mass incarceration and build a new criminal justice system,

295
0:15:49.258,000 --> 0:15:51,000
emphasis on the word justice.

296
0:15:52.185,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Thanks.

297
0:15:53.589,000 --> 0:15:56,000
(Applause)

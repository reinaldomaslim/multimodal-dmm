1
0:00:12.989,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Imagine that you're a member of Congress.

2
0:00:16.67,000 --> 0:00:17,000
You've worked very hard.

3
0:00:19.114,000 --> 0:00:22,000
You've knocked on thousands of doors,

4
0:00:22.212,000 --> 0:00:25,000
sweating and shivering, depending on the season.

5
0:00:25.874,000 --> 0:00:26,000
You've made hundreds,

6
0:00:27.072,000 --> 0:00:31,000
maybe thousands of phone calls to people you don't even know

7
0:00:31.692,000 --> 0:00:33,000
asking for their support,

8
0:00:33.864,000 --> 0:00:34,000
begging for their money.

9
0:00:36.417,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And now you've got one of these.

10
0:00:38.564,000 --> 0:00:4,000
It's hanging on a door in Washington, DC.

11
0:00:41.398,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It says you're a member of Congress,

12
0:00:43.493,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that you represent the people of your state.

13
0:00:47.052,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now, imagine you're a conservative member of Congress.

14
0:00:53.346,000 --> 0:00:55,000
For some of you here in Boston, Massachusetts,

15
0:00:55.577,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that's going to take a powerful imagination, all right?

16
0:00:58.182,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:59.262,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But imagine with me

18
0:01:02.056,000 --> 0:01:05,000
that you're a conservative member of Congress.

19
0:01:05.64,000 --> 0:01:06,000
You grew up on Milton Friedman.

20
0:01:08.093,000 --> 0:01:09,000
You love his free markets,

21
0:01:09.899,000 --> 0:01:11,000
free enterprise and free trade.

22
0:01:12.686,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You've watched Ronald Reagan's farewell address over and over,

23
0:01:18.237,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and you cry every time --

24
0:01:20.551,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:21.696,000 --> 0:01:24,000
he gets to the part about the shining city on the hill,

26
0:01:25.707,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and how if the city had to have walls,

27
0:01:28.708,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the walls had doors --

28
0:01:30.914,000 --> 0:01:33,000
doors to let in those yearning to breathe free.

29
0:01:35.525,000 --> 0:01:39,000
You get goosebumps when you think of him telling Mr. Gorbachev

30
0:01:40.266,000 --> 0:01:42,000
to tear down his wall.

31
0:01:43.924,000 --> 0:01:45,000
You're a conservative member of Congress,

32
0:01:46.738,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and you agree with President John F. Kennedy

33
0:01:49.68,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that America is an exceptional place.

34
0:01:53.287,000 --> 0:01:54,000
For inspiration,

35
0:01:54.939,000 --> 0:01:58,000
you go to YouTube and you watch his speech at Rice University,

36
0:01:59.084,000 --> 0:02:01,000
September of 1962,

37
0:02:01.577,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the "moon shot" speech.

38
0:02:03.896,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And you're amazed that he admits in that speech --

39
0:02:08.063,000 --> 0:02:12,000
a speech of 17 minutes of pure American exceptionalism --

40
0:02:13.87,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that some of the materials needed for the spacecraft

41
0:02:17.466,000 --> 0:02:18,000
hadn't been invented yet.

42
0:02:19.786,000 --> 0:02:2,000
No matter.

43
0:02:21.108,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We're going to the Moon before the decade is out.

44
0:02:24.986,000 --> 0:02:26,000
You agree with him

45
0:02:27.252,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that the vows of this nation can be fulfilled

46
0:02:30.546,000 --> 0:02:33,000
only if we in this nation are first

47
0:02:33.774,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and therefore we intend to be first.

48
0:02:37.874,000 --> 0:02:41,000
You've taken as your own the affect that he so embodied:

49
0:02:43.384,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that when leaders are optimistic,

50
0:02:46.315,000 --> 0:02:5,000
they're saying they believe in the people they represent.

51
0:02:51.142,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You're a conservative member of Congress,

52
0:02:54.636,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and you believe in the precautionary principle.

53
0:02:58.084,000 --> 0:03:,000
You believe in data-driven analysis.

54
0:03:01.433,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You know that climate change is real and human-caused,

55
0:03:05.528,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and you see in climate change

56
0:03:08.569,000 --> 0:03:12,000
a silent and slow-moving Sputnik moment.

57
0:03:14.228,000 --> 0:03:16,000
One that calls for the greatness of your nation

58
0:03:17.166,000 --> 0:03:2,000
as much as the original Sputnik moment.

59
0:03:21.131,000 --> 0:03:23,000
You are a conservative member of Congress.

60
0:03:25.101,000 --> 0:03:28,000
You high-five the memory of Jack Kemp,

61
0:03:28.947,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and believe with him

62
0:03:31.038,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that the test of conservatism is that it works for everyone,

63
0:03:34.852,000 --> 0:03:35,000
regardless of skin color.

64
0:03:37.424,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You're appalled by the alt-right.

65
0:03:41.094,000 --> 0:03:47,000
You want them to have nothing to do with your brand, your party, your legacy.

66
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
You utterly reject them.

67
0:03:50.271,000 --> 0:03:51,000
You --

68
0:03:51.445,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Applause)

69
0:03:56.525,000 --> 0:03:57,000
You're a conservative member of Congress.

70
0:03:58.54,000 --> 0:04:01,000
You rise with compassion to protect the lives of the unborn,

71
0:04:02.27,000 --> 0:04:06,000
but otherwise you think the bedroom of consenting adults

72
0:04:06.326,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is a rather strange place for the government to be.

73
0:04:09.677,000 --> 0:04:12,000
You are a conservative member of Congress.

74
0:04:15.115,000 --> 0:04:17,000
With John Adams,

75
0:04:18.101,000 --> 0:04:19,000
you fear the mob.

76
0:04:20.52,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Because you know, as he knew,

77
0:04:22.458,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that a mob is not able to protect liberty,

78
0:04:24.483,000 --> 0:04:25,000
not even its own.

79
0:04:26.195,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And you're amazed at the wisdom that he and other framers had

80
0:04:30.482,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in establishing a slow, deliberative governing process --

81
0:04:35.059,000 --> 0:04:38,000
an inherently conservative governing process.

82
0:04:38.955,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It would serve a country.

83
0:04:40.452,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It would grow far greater than they could ever imagine.

84
0:04:45.058,000 --> 0:04:48,000
You are a conservative member of Congress.

85
0:04:49.388,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You fear the fire of populist nationalism,

86
0:04:55.426,000 --> 0:04:57,000
because you know that those who play with fire

87
0:04:58.165,000 --> 0:04:59,000
can't control it.

88
0:05:00.345,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You see their pitchforks and torches,

89
0:05:02.425,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and you know they're not good building tools.

90
0:05:06.745,000 --> 0:05:11,000
The pitchforks and torches can tear down and burn up but they can't build up.

91
0:05:12.417,000 --> 0:05:16,000
They can't build up the institutions and the communities

92
0:05:16.476,000 --> 0:05:2,000
so necessary to a stable and prosperous country.

93
0:05:22.496,000 --> 0:05:25,000
You're a conservative member of Congress,

94
0:05:25.669,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and you fear the next county party convention.

95
0:05:31.692,000 --> 0:05:35,000
You so wish for your party to be the grand opportunity party,

96
0:05:36.161,000 --> 0:05:38,000
not the grumpy old party.

97
0:05:38.264,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

98
0:05:40.253,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You know that they want to hear from you some old saw

99
0:05:45.833,000 --> 0:05:48,000
about how a secret Muslim, non-American socialist took over in the White House

100
0:05:49.778,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and destroyed the country,

101
0:05:51.286,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and you know that none of that's true.

102
0:05:54.135,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Applause)

103
0:05:59.798,000 --> 0:06:05,000
You know that they want to hear you say that you're OK with insults,

104
0:06:06.523,000 --> 0:06:09,000
OK with "lock her up" chants

105
0:06:10.349,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and OK with policy pronouncements

106
0:06:13.868,000 --> 0:06:17,000
with all the sincerity and thoughtfulness that 140 characters can muster.

107
0:06:18.44,000 --> 0:06:22,000
You are a conservative member of Congress.

108
0:06:22.968,000 --> 0:06:27,000
You realize that many in your party look to some good old days

109
0:06:28.334,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that you know never existed.

110
0:06:31.102,000 --> 0:06:33,000
They hold on, for example,

111
0:06:33.261,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to the fossils that fueled the last century of growth,

112
0:06:37.291,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but you know that better, cleaner more abundant fuels await us,

113
0:06:42.857,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and you know that that abundance can lead the world to more energy,

114
0:06:48.215,000 --> 0:06:49,000
more mobility

115
0:06:49.834,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and more freedom.

116
0:06:51.814,000 --> 0:06:53,000
You're a conservative member of Congress.

117
0:06:55.169,000 --> 0:07:,000
You realize that many in your party pine for the '50s and the '60s

118
0:07:00.887,000 --> 0:07:02,000
because those were, after all, the good old days.

119
0:07:04.635,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But you know that the Cuyahoga River was on fire back then.

120
0:07:09.499,000 --> 0:07:1,000
You know that in Pittsburgh,

121
0:07:11.246,000 --> 0:07:15,000
street lights came on at noon because of the soot in the air.

122
0:07:16.271,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The schools were segregated,

123
0:07:17.665,000 --> 0:07:18,000
neighborhoods redlined,

124
0:07:19.309,000 --> 0:07:2,000
that communism threatened freedom,

125
0:07:21.12,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and if you got cancer, you weren't likely to fight for long.

126
0:07:25.699,000 --> 0:07:28,000
You're a conservative member of Congress

127
0:07:28.973,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and you want to sound like JFK at Rice,

128
0:07:33.97,000 --> 0:07:37,000
where JFK said, "It's understandable

129
0:07:38.318,000 --> 0:07:4,000
why some would have us stay where we are

130
0:07:40.919,000 --> 0:07:41,000
a little bit longer,

131
0:07:42.379,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to wait and to rest."

132
0:07:45.615,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But everything within you says with him,

133
0:07:48.986,000 --> 0:07:49,000
this city of Houston,

134
0:07:50.698,000 --> 0:07:51,000
this state of Texas,

135
0:07:52.337,000 --> 0:07:57,000
this country of the United States was not built by those who waited

136
0:07:57.91,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and rested and wished to look behind them.

137
0:08:00.811,000 --> 0:08:01,000
You are ready to lead.

138
0:08:03.012,000 --> 0:08:07,000
You are ready to prove the power of free enterprise

139
0:08:07.1,000 --> 0:08:1,000
to solve challenges like climate change.

140
0:08:10.45,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You are ready to lead.

141
0:08:13.931,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So I've got a suggestion for you then:

142
0:08:17.001,000 --> 0:08:18,000
lead ...

143
0:08:18.638,000 --> 0:08:19,000
now.

144
0:08:19.931,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Step out,

145
0:08:21.63,000 --> 0:08:22,000
step up.

146
0:08:23.85,000 --> 0:08:27,000
You know, we ask America's best

147
0:08:28.009,000 --> 0:08:31,000
to die on literal hills

148
0:08:31.089,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in places like Iraq and Afghanistan.

149
0:08:34.003,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Is it too much to ask you to die a figurative death

150
0:08:40.155,000 --> 0:08:42,000
on a political hill in Washington, DC?

151
0:08:44.318,000 --> 0:08:47,000
You know, at the end of your time in Washington,

152
0:08:47.629,000 --> 0:08:49,000
they're going to take this plaque off the door.

153
0:08:50.54,000 --> 0:08:51,000
They're going to hand it to you;

154
0:08:52.492,000 --> 0:08:53,000
you're going to go home with it.

155
0:08:54.875,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Can you imagine the emptiness of knowing that you stood for nothing,

156
0:09:00.471,000 --> 0:09:02,000
that you risk nothing,

157
0:09:03.06,000 --> 0:09:07,000
that all you did was follow fearful people to where they were already going

158
0:09:07.549,000 --> 0:09:1,000
rather than trying to lead them to a better place?

159
0:09:11.636,000 --> 0:09:14,000
If you're not willing to lose your seat in Congress,

160
0:09:15.462,000 --> 0:09:17,000
there's really very little reason to be there.

161
0:09:18.413,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Applause)

162
0:09:28.37,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So here's the thing:

163
0:09:30.268,000 --> 0:09:31,000
it's not too late.

164
0:09:33.006,000 --> 0:09:35,000
There's still time to lead.

165
0:09:36.95,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Speak out,

166
0:09:38.134,000 --> 0:09:39,000
speak up,

167
0:09:39.563,000 --> 0:09:41,000
call lunacy what it is:

168
0:09:42.272,000 --> 0:09:43,000
lunacy.

169
0:09:44.418,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Tell the American people that we still have moon shots in us.

170
0:09:50.098,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Tell the folks at the county party convention,

171
0:09:52.792,000 --> 0:09:55,000
"You bet free enterprise can solve climate change."

172
0:09:55.828,000 --> 0:10:,000
Tell them that Milton Friedman would say to tax pollution

173
0:10:01.752,000 --> 0:10:02,000
rather than profits.

174
0:10:03.94,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Tell them that it's OK --

175
0:10:06.656,000 --> 0:10:08,000
no, it's a good thing

176
0:10:09.081,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that progressives would agree.

177
0:10:11.942,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Tell them the very good news that we can bring America together

178
0:10:17.762,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to solve these challenges and to lead the world.

179
0:10:22.225,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Tell them that free enterprise can do these things.

180
0:10:26.636,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Tell them that America must stop the dividing,

181
0:10:31.43,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and must start the uniting.

182
0:10:34.143,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Tell them.

183
0:10:36.049,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Play your part before it's too late.

184
0:10:40.906,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Applause)

185
0:10:42.08,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Thank you very much.

186
0:10:43.255,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Applause)

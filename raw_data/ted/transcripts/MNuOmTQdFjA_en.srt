1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I run a design studio in New York.

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Every seven years, I close it for one year

3
0:00:19.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
to pursue

4
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
some little experiments, things that

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
are always difficult to accomplish

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
during the regular working year.

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
In that year, we are not available

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
for any of our clients.

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
We are totally closed.

10
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And as you can imagine,

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
it is a lovely and very energetic time.

12
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I originally had opened the studio in New York

13
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to combine my two loves, music and design.

14
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And we created videos and packaging

15
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
for many musicians that you know,

16
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and for even more that you've never heard of.

17
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
As I realized, just like with many many things in my life

18
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that I actually love,

19
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I adapt to it.

20
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And I get, over time, bored by them.

21
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And for sure, in our case,

22
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
our work started to look the same.

23
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You see here a glass eye in a die cut of a book.

24
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Quite the similar idea, then, a perfume packaged

25
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in a book, in a die cut.

26
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So I decided to close it down for one year.

27
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Also is the knowledge that

28
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
right now we spend about

29
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in the first 25 years of our lives learning,

30
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
then there is another 40 years

31
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that's really reserved for working.

32
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And then tacked on at the end of it

33
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
are about 15 years for retirement.

34
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I thought it might be helpful

35
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to basically cut off five of those retirement years

36
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and intersperse them in between those working years.

37
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Applause)

38
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
That's clearly enjoyable for myself.

39
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But probably even more important is

40
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that the work that comes out of these years

41
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
flows back into the company

42
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and into society at large,

43
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two.

44
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
There is a fellow TEDster who spoke two years ago,

45
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Jonathan Haidt,

46
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
who defined his work into three different levels.

47
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And they rang very true for me.

48
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I can see my work as a job. I do it for money.

49
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I likely already look forward to the weekend on Thursdays.

50
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And I probably will need a hobby as a leveling mechanism.

51
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
In a career I'm definitely more engaged.

52
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But at the same time, there will be periods when I think

53
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is all that really hard work really worth my while?

54
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
While in the third one, in the calling,

55
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
very much likely I would do it also

56
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
if I wouldn't be financially compensated for it.

57
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I am not a religious person myself,

58
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
but I did look for nature.

59
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City.

60
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Looked for something different for the second one.

61
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Europe and the U.S. didn't really feel enticing

62
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
because I knew them too well. So Asia it was.

63
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
The most beautiful landscapes I had seen in Asia

64
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
were Sri Lanka and Bali.

65
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Sri Lanka still had the civil war going on, so Bali it was.

66
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's a wonderful, very craft-oriented society.

67
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I arrived there in September 2008,

68
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and pretty much started to work right away.

69
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
There is wonderful inspiration coming from the area itself.

70
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
However the first thing that I needed was

71
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
mosquito repellent typography

72
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
because they were definitely around heavily.

73
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And then I needed some sort of way

74
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to be able to get back to all the wild dogs

75
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
that surround my house,

76
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and attacked me during my morning walks.

77
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So we created this series of 99 portraits on tee shirts.

78
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Every single dog on one tee shirt.

79
0:04:17.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
As a little retaliation

80
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
with a just ever so slightly menacing message

81
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
on the back of the shirt.

83
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Just before I left New York

85
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I decided I could actually renovate my studio.

86
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And then just leave it all to them.

87
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And I don't have to do anything.

88
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So I looked for furniture.

89
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And it turned out that

90
0:04:43.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
all the furniture that I really liked,

91
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I couldn't afford.

92
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And all the stuff I could afford, I didn't like.

93
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
So one of the things that we pursued in Bali

94
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
was pieces of furniture.

95
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
This one, of course, still works with the wild dogs.

96
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
It's not quite finished yet.

97
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And I think by the time this lamp came about,

98
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I had finally made peace with those dogs.

100
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Then there is a coffee table. I also did a coffee table.

102
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's called Be Here Now.

103
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
It includes 330 compasses.

104
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And we had custom espresso cups made

105
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that hide a magnet inside,

106
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and make those compasses go crazy,

107
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
always centering on them.

108
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Then this is a fairly talkative, verbose kind of chair.

109
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I also started meditating for the first time in my life in Bali.

110
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And at the same time, I'm extremely aware

111
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
how boring it is to hear about other people's happinesses.

112
0:05:52.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
So I will not really go too far into it.

113
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
Many of you will know this TEDster,

114
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Danny Gilbert, whose book, actually,

115
0:06:02.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I got it through the TED book club.

116
0:06:04.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I think it took me four years

117
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to finally read it, while on sabbatical.

118
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And I was pleased to see

119
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that he actually wrote the book while he was on sabbatical.

120
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And I'll show you a couple of people

121
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that did well by pursuing sabbaticals.

122
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This is Ferran Adria. Many people think

123
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
he is right now the best chef in the world

124
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
with his restaurant north of Barcelona, El Bulli.

125
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:32,000
His restaurant is open seven months every year.

126
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
He closes it down for five months

127
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to experiment with a full kitchen staff.

128
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
His latest numbers are fairly impressive.

129
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
He can seat, throughout the year,

130
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
he can seat 8,000 people.

131
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And he has 2.2 million requests for reservations.

132
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
If I look at my cycle, seven years, one year sabbatical,

133
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
it's 12.5 percent of my time.

134
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And if I look at companies that are actually more successful than mine,

135
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
3M since the 1930s

136
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is giving all their engineers

137
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
15 percent to pursue whatever they want.

138
0:07:11.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
There is some good successes.

139
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Scotch tape came out of this program,

140
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
as well as Art Fry developed

141
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
sticky notes from during his personal time for 3M.

142
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Google, of course, very famously

143
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
gives 20 percent for their software engineers

144
0:07:28.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
to pursue their own personal projects.

145
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Anybody in here has actually ever conducted a sabbatical?

146
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
That's about five percent of everybody.

147
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So I'm not sure if you saw your neighbor putting their hand up.

148
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Talk to them about if it was successful or not.

149
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I've found that

150
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
finding out about what I'm going to like in the future,

151
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:,000
my very best way is to talk to people

152
0:08:00.16,000 --> 0:08:02,000
who have actually done it

153
0:08:02.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
much better than myself envisioning it.

154
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
When I had the idea of doing one,

155
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the process was I made the decision and I put it into my daily planner book.

156
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And then I told as many, many people as I possibly could about it

157
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
so that there was no way that I could chicken out later on.

158
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Laughter)

159
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
In the beginning, on the first sabbatical,

160
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
it was rather disastrous.

161
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I had thought that I should do this without any plan,

162
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that this vacuum of time somehow would

163
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
be wonderful and enticing

164
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
for idea generation. It was not.

165
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I just, without a plan, I just reacted

166
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
to little requests, not work requests,

167
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
those I all said no to, but other little requests.

168
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Sending mail to Japanese design magazines and things like that.

169
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So I became my own intern.

170
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Laughter)

171
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And I very quickly

172
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
made a list of the things I was interested in,

173
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
put them in a hierarchy, divided them into chunks of time

174
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and then made a plan, very much like in grade school.

175
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
What does it say here? Monday, 8 to 9: story writing;

176
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
9 to 10: future thinking.

177
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Was not very successful. And so on and so forth.

178
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And that actually, specifically as a starting point

179
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
of the first sabbatical, worked really well for me.

180
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
What came out of it?

181
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I really got close to design again.

182
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I had fun.

183
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Financially, seen over the long term, it was actually successful.

184
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Because of the improved quality, we could ask for higher prices.

185
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And probably most importantly,

186
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
basically everything we've done

187
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
in the seven years following the first sabbatical

188
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
came out of thinking of that one single year.

189
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And I'll show you a couple of projects

190
0:09:56.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
that came out of the seven years following that sabbatical.

191
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
One of the strands of thinking I was involved in was

192
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that sameness is so incredibly overrated.

193
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
This whole idea that everything needs to be exactly the same

194
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
works for a very very few strand of companies,

195
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and not for everybody else.

196
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We were asked to design an identity for Casa da Musica,

197
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the Rem Koolhaas-built music center

198
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
in Porto, in Portugal.

199
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And even though I desired to do an identity

200
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
that doesn't use the architecture,

201
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I failed at that.

202
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And mostly also because I realized

203
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
out of a Rem Koolhaas presentation to the city of Porto, where

204
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
he talked about a conglomeration of various layers of meaning.

205
0:10:45.16,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Which I understood after I

206
0:10:47.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
translated it from architecture speech

207
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
in to regular English,

208
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
basically as logo making.

209
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And I understood that the building itself was a logo.

210
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So then it became quite easy.

211
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:,000
We put a mask on it,

212
0:11:00.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
looked at it deep down in the ground,

213
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
checked it out from all sides,

214
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
west, north, south, east,

215
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:1,000
top and bottom.

216
0:11:10.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Colored them in a very particular way

217
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
by having a friend of mine write a piece of software,

218
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
the Casa da Musica Logo Generator.

219
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
That's connected to a scanner.

220
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
You put any image in there, like that Beethoven image.

221
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And the software, in a second,

222
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
will give you the Casa da Musica Beethoven logo.

223
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Which, when you actually have to design a Beethoven poster,

224
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
comes in handy, because the visual information of the logo

225
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and the actual poster is exactly the same.

226
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So it will always fit together, conceptually, of course.

227
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:48,000
If Zappa's music is performed, it gets its own logo.

228
0:11:48.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Or Philip Glass or Lou Reed or the Chemical Brothers,

229
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
who all performed there, get their own

230
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Casa da Musica logo.

231
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
It works the same internally with the president or the musical director,

232
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
whose Casa da Musica portraits wind up on their business cards.

233
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
There is a full-blown orchestra

234
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
living inside the building.

235
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It has a more transparent identity.

236
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
The truck they go on tour with.

237
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:18,000
Or there's a smaller contemporary orchestra,

238
0:12:18.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
12 people that remixes its own title.

239
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And one of the handy things that came about

240
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
was that you could take the logo type

241
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
and create advertising out of it.

242
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Like this Donna Toney poster,

243
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
or Chopin, or Mozart,

244
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
or La Monte Young.

245
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
You can take the shape and make typography out of it.

246
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
You can grow it underneath the skin.

247
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
You can have a poster for a family event in front of the house,

248
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
or a rave underneath the house

249
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
or a weekly program,

250
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
as well as educational services.

251
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
Second insight. So far, until that point I had

252
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
been mostly involved

253
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
or used the language of design

254
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
for promotional purposes,

255
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
which was fine with me.

256
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
On one hand I have nothing against selling.

257
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
My parents are both salespeople.

258
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
But I did feel that

259
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I spent so much time learning this language,

260
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
why do I only promote with it?

261
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:23,000
There must be something else.

262
0:13:23.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And the whole series of work came out of it.

263
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Some of you might have seen it.

264
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I showed some of it

265
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
at earlier TEDs before,

266
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
under the title "Things I've Learned in My Life So Far."

267
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I'll just show two now.

268
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
This is a whole wall of bananas

269
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
at different ripenesses

270
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
on the opening day in this gallery in New York.

271
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
It says, "Self-confidence produces fine results."

272
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
This is after a week.

273
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
After two weeks,

274
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
three weeks, four weeks, five weeks.

275
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And you see the self confidence almost comes back,

276
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but not quite.

277
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
These are some pictures visitors sent to me.

278
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
(Laughter)

279
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And then the city of Amsterdam

280
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
gave us a plaza and asked us to do something.

281
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
We used the stone plates as a grid

282
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
for our little piece.

283
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
We got 250,000 coins from the central bank,

284
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
at different darknesses.

285
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
So we got brand new ones, shiny ones,

286
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
medium ones, and very old, dark ones.

287
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And with the help of 100 volunteers, over a week,

288
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
created this fairly floral typography

289
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that spelled, "Obsessions make my life worse

290
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and my work better."

291
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And the idea of course was to

292
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
make the type so precious

293
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that as an audience

294
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
you would be in between,

295
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
"Should I really take as much money as I can?

296
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Or should I leave the piece intact as it is right now?"

297
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
While we built all this up

298
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
during that week, with the 100 volunteers,

299
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
a good number of the neighbors surrounding the plaza

300
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
got very close to it and quite loved it.

301
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
So when it was finally done,

302
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and in the first night

303
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
a guy came with big plastic bags

304
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and scooped up as many coins as he could possibly carry,

305
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
one of the neighbors called the police.

306
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
And the Amsterdam police

307
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
in all their wisdom,

308
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
came, saw,

309
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and they wanted to protect the artwork.

310
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And they swept it all up and put it into custody

311
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
at police headquarters.

312
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
(Laughter)

313
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I think you see, you see them sweeping. You see them sweeping right here.

314
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
That's the police, getting rid of it all.

315
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So after eight hours

316
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
that's pretty much all that was left

317
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
of the whole thing.

318
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Laughter)

319
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
We are also working on the start of a bigger project in Bali.

320
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
It's a movie about happiness.

321
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
And here we asked some nearby pigs

322
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to do the titles for us.

323
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
They weren't quite slick enough.

324
0:16:04.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
So we asked the goose to do it again,

325
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
and hoped she would do somehow,

326
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
a more elegant or pretty job.

327
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
And I think she overdid it.

328
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
Just a bit too ornamental.

329
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And my studio is very close to the monkey forest.

330
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And the monkeys in that monkey forest

331
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
looked, actually, fairly happy.

332
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So we asked those guys to do it again.

333
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
They did a fine job, but had

334
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
a couple of readability problems.

335
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:39,000
So of course whatever you don't really do yourself

336
0:16:39.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
doesn't really get done properly.

337
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:47,000
That film we'll be working on for the next two years.

338
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
So it's going to be a while.

339
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:52,000
And of course you might think that

340
0:16:52.16,000 --> 0:16:55,000
doing a film on happiness

341
0:16:55.16,000 --> 0:16:57,000
might not really be worthwhile.

342
0:16:57.16,000 --> 0:16:59,000
Then you can of course always

343
0:16:59.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
go and see this guy.

344
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Video: (Laughter)

345
0:17:16.16,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And I'm happy I'm alive.

346
0:17:18.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
I'm happy I'm alive. I'm happy I'm alive.

347
0:17:25.16,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Stefan Sagmeister: Thank you.

348
0:17:27.16,000 --> 0:17:31,000
(Applause)

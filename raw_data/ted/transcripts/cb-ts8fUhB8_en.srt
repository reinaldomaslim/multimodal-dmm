1
0:00:12.634,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So if I was to ask you

2
0:00:15.17,000 --> 0:00:16,000
what the connection between

3
0:00:16.584,000 --> 0:00:19,000
a bottle of Tide detergent and sweat was,

4
0:00:19.856,000 --> 0:00:2,000
you'd probably think that's the easiest question

5
0:00:21.52,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that you're going to be asked in Edinburgh all week.

6
0:00:24.3,000 --> 0:00:26,000
But if I was to say that they're both examples

7
0:00:26.939,000 --> 0:00:29,000
of alternative or new forms of currency

8
0:00:30.168,000 --> 0:00:33,000
in a hyperconnected, data-driven global economy,

9
0:00:33.706,000 --> 0:00:36,000
you'd probably think I was a little bit bonkers.

10
0:00:37.235,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But trust me, I work in advertising.

11
0:00:39.802,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:41.835,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And I am going to tell you the answer,

13
0:00:43.894,000 --> 0:00:45,000
but obviously after this short break.

14
0:00:46.504,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So a more challenging question is one

15
0:00:48.413,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that I was asked, actually, by one of our writers

16
0:00:50.296,000 --> 0:00:52,000
a couple of weeks ago, and I didn't know the answer:

17
0:00:52.797,000 --> 0:00:54,000
What's the world's best performing currency?

18
0:00:55.037,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's actually Bitcoin.

19
0:00:56.947,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Now, for those of you who may not be familiar,

20
0:00:59.162,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Bitcoin is a crypto-currency, a virtual currency, synthetic currency.

21
0:01:02.62,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It was founded in 2008 by this anonymous programmer

22
0:01:06.426,000 --> 0:01:08,000
using a pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.

23
0:01:09.294,000 --> 0:01:11,000
No one knows who or what he is.

24
0:01:11.665,000 --> 0:01:13,000
He's almost like the Banksy of the Internet.

25
0:01:13.926,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And I'm probably not going to do it proper service here,

26
0:01:17.034,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but my interpretation of how it works is that

27
0:01:19.201,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Bitcoins are released through this process of mining.

28
0:01:21.984,000 --> 0:01:23,000
So there's a network of computers that are challenged

29
0:01:24.532,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to solve a very complex mathematical problem

30
0:01:26.686,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the person that manages to solve it first gets the Bitcoins.

31
0:01:29.952,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And the Bitcoins are released,

32
0:01:30.938,000 --> 0:01:32,000
they're put into a public ledger called the Blockchain,

33
0:01:33.582,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and then they float, so they become a currency,

34
0:01:36.235,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and completely decentralized, that's the sort of

35
0:01:39.282,000 --> 0:01:41,000
scary thing about this, which is why it's so popular.

36
0:01:41.83,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So it's not run by the authorities or the state.

37
0:01:44.306,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It's actually managed by the network.

38
0:01:46.383,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And the reason that it's proved very successful

39
0:01:48.646,000 --> 0:01:51,000
is it's private, it's anonymous, it's fast, and it's cheap.

40
0:01:52.064,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And you do get to the point where there's some wild fluctuations with Bitcoin.

41
0:01:55.856,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So in one level it went from something like 13 dollars

42
0:01:58.771,000 --> 0:02:,000
to 266, literally in the space of four months,

43
0:02:01.363,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and then crashed and lost half of its value in six hours.

44
0:02:04.102,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And it's currently around that kind of

45
0:02:05.936,000 --> 0:02:07,000
110 dollar mark in value.

46
0:02:08.416,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But what it does show is that it's sort of gaining ground,

47
0:02:11.212,000 --> 0:02:11,000
it's gaining respectability.

48
0:02:12.139,000 --> 0:02:14,000
You get services, like Reddit and Wordpress

49
0:02:14.235,000 --> 0:02:17,000
are actually accepting Bitcoin as a payment currency now.

50
0:02:17.53,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And that's showing you that people

51
0:02:19.473,000 --> 0:02:21,000
are actually placing trust in technology,

52
0:02:22.024,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and it's started to trump and disrupt

53
0:02:24.784,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and interrogate traditional institutions

54
0:02:26.829,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and how we think about currencies and money.

55
0:02:29.568,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And that's not surprising, if you think about

56
0:02:31.016,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the basket case that is the E.U.

57
0:02:32.936,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I think there was a Gallup survey out recently

58
0:02:35.151,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that said something like, in America,

59
0:02:37.137,000 --> 0:02:4,000
trust in banks is at an all-time low, it's something like 21 percent.

60
0:02:40.911,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And you can see here some photographs from London

61
0:02:42.726,000 --> 0:02:44,000
where Barclays sponsored the city bike scheme,

62
0:02:44.941,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and some activists have done some nice piece

63
0:02:46.548,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of guerrilla marketing here and doctored the slogans.

64
0:02:49.496,000 --> 0:02:52,000
"Sub-prime pedaling." "Barclays takes you for a ride."

65
0:02:52.993,000 --> 0:02:55,000
These are the more polite ones I could share with you today.

66
0:02:56.696,000 --> 0:02:58,000
But you get the gist, so people have really started

67
0:02:59.149,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to sort of lose faith in institutions.

68
0:03:01.672,000 --> 0:03:03,000
There's a P.R. company called Edelman,

69
0:03:03.72,000 --> 0:03:05,000
they do this very interesting survey every year

70
0:03:05.983,000 --> 0:03:08,000
precisely around trust and what people are thinking.

71
0:03:09.178,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And this is a global survey, so these numbers are global.

72
0:03:11.92,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And what's interesting is that you can see that

73
0:03:14.183,000 --> 0:03:16,000
hierarchy is having a bit of a wobble,

74
0:03:16.787,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and it's all about heterarchical now,

75
0:03:18.573,000 --> 0:03:2,000
so people trust people like themselves more

76
0:03:21.137,000 --> 0:03:24,000
than they trust corporations and governments.

77
0:03:24.221,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And if you look at these figures for the more developed markets

78
0:03:26.404,000 --> 0:03:28,000
like U.K., Germany, and so on, they're actually much lower.

79
0:03:29.132,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And I find that sort of scary.

80
0:03:30.143,000 --> 0:03:32,000
People are actually trusting businesspeople

81
0:03:32.215,000 --> 0:03:35,000
more than they're trusting governments and leaders.

82
0:03:35.644,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So what's starting to happen, if you think about money,

83
0:03:38.751,000 --> 0:03:4,000
if you sort of boil money down to an essence,

84
0:03:40.96,000 --> 0:03:44,000
it is literally just an expression of value, an agreed value.

85
0:03:45.022,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So what's happening now, in the digital age,

86
0:03:47.142,000 --> 0:03:49,000
is that we can quantify value in lots of different ways

87
0:03:49.884,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and do it more easily,

88
0:03:51.501,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and sometimes the way that we quantify those values,

89
0:03:54.179,000 --> 0:03:56,000
it makes it much easier

90
0:03:56.702,000 --> 0:03:59,000
to create new forms and valid forms of currency.

91
0:04:00.499,000 --> 0:04:03,000
In that context, you can see that networks like Bitcoin

92
0:04:03.555,000 --> 0:04:06,000
suddenly start to make a bit more sense.

93
0:04:07.198,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So if you think we're starting to question

94
0:04:10.242,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and disrupt and interrogate what money means,

95
0:04:12.832,000 --> 0:04:15,000
what our relationship with it is, what defines money,

96
0:04:15.939,000 --> 0:04:18,000
then the ultimate extension of that is,

97
0:04:19.017,000 --> 0:04:21,000
is there a reason for the government to be in charge

98
0:04:21.87,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of money anymore?

99
0:04:23.326,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So obviously I'm looking at this through a marketing prism,

100
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
so from a brand perspective,

101
0:04:27.83,000 --> 0:04:3,000
brands literally stand or fall on their reputations.

102
0:04:31.505,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And if you think about it, reputation has now become a currency.

103
0:04:33.832,000 --> 0:04:35,000
You know, reputations are built on trust,

104
0:04:35.943,000 --> 0:04:37,000
consistency, transparency.

105
0:04:38.493,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So if you've actually decided that you trust a brand,

106
0:04:41.041,000 --> 0:04:43,000
you want a relationship, you want to engage with the brand,

107
0:04:43.875,000 --> 0:04:45,000
you're already kind of participating in lots of new forms

108
0:04:46.734,000 --> 0:04:47,000
of currency.

109
0:04:48.273,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So you think about loyalty.

110
0:04:50.263,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Loyalty essentially is a micro-economy.

111
0:04:52.326,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You think about rewards schemes, air miles.

112
0:04:55.561,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The Economist said a few years ago that

113
0:04:57.71,000 --> 0:05:01,000
there are actually more unredeemed air miles in the world

114
0:05:01.9,000 --> 0:05:03,000
than there are dollar bills in circulation.

115
0:05:04.8,000 --> 0:05:06,000
You know, when you are standing in line in Starbucks,

116
0:05:07.348,000 --> 0:05:09,000
30 percent of transactions in Starbucks on any one day

117
0:05:10.058,000 --> 0:05:13,000
are actually being made with Starbucks Star points.

118
0:05:13.12,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So that's a sort of Starbucks currency

119
0:05:14.954,000 --> 0:05:16,000
staying within its ecosystem.

120
0:05:16.987,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And what I find interesting is that Amazon

121
0:05:19.915,000 --> 0:05:22,000
has recently launched Amazon coins.

122
0:05:22.995,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So admittedly it's a currency at the moment that's purely for the Kindle.

123
0:05:25.734,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So you can buy apps and make purchases within those apps,

124
0:05:28.922,000 --> 0:05:29,000
but you think about Amazon,

125
0:05:30.319,000 --> 0:05:32,000
you look at the trust barometer that I showed you

126
0:05:32.677,000 --> 0:05:34,000
where people are starting to trust businesses,

127
0:05:35.615,000 --> 0:05:37,000
especially businesses that they believe in and trust

128
0:05:38.116,000 --> 0:05:39,000
more than governments.

129
0:05:39.506,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So suddenly, you start thinking,

130
0:05:41.008,000 --> 0:05:42,000
well Amazon potentially could push this.

131
0:05:42.846,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It could become a natural extension,

132
0:05:44.536,000 --> 0:05:45,000
that as well as buying stuff --

133
0:05:46.037,000 --> 0:05:48,000
take it out of the Kindle -- you could buy books, music,

134
0:05:48.728,000 --> 0:05:52,000
real-life products, appliances and goods and so on.

135
0:05:53.301,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And suddenly you're getting Amazon, as a brand,

136
0:05:55.729,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is going head to head with the Federal Reserve

137
0:05:57.346,000 --> 0:05:59,000
in terms of how you want to spend your money,

138
0:05:59.513,000 --> 0:06:01,000
what money is, what constitutes money.

139
0:06:01.888,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And I'll get you back to Tide, the detergent now,

140
0:06:05.484,000 --> 0:06:06,000
as I promised.

141
0:06:06.896,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This is a fantastic article I came across in New York Magazine,

142
0:06:09.229,000 --> 0:06:11,000
where it was saying that drug users across America

143
0:06:12.059,000 --> 0:06:14,000
are actually purchasing drugs

144
0:06:14.235,000 --> 0:06:16,000
with bottles of Tide detergent.

145
0:06:16.886,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So they're going into convenience stores,

146
0:06:18.974,000 --> 0:06:19,000
stealing Tide,

147
0:06:20.084,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and a $20 bottle of Tide

148
0:06:22.278,000 --> 0:06:26,000
is equal to 10 dollars of crack cocaine or weed.

149
0:06:27.154,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And what they're saying, so some criminologists

150
0:06:29.417,000 --> 0:06:31,000
have looked at this and they're saying, well, okay,

151
0:06:31.822,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Tide as a product sells at a premium.

152
0:06:33.648,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's 50 percent above the category average.

153
0:06:35.765,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It's infused with a very complex cocktail of chemicals,

154
0:06:39.093,000 --> 0:06:41,000
so it smells very luxurious and very distinctive,

155
0:06:41.478,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and, being a Procter and Gamble brand,

156
0:06:43.426,000 --> 0:06:46,000
it's been supported by a lot of mass media advertising.

157
0:06:47.026,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So what they're saying is that drug users are consumers too,

158
0:06:49.895,000 --> 0:06:51,000
so they have this in their neural pathways.

159
0:06:51.967,000 --> 0:06:52,000
When they spot Tide, there's a shortcut.

160
0:06:53.896,000 --> 0:06:55,000
They say, that is trust. I trust that. That's quality.

161
0:06:56.653,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So it becomes this unit of currency,

162
0:06:59.272,000 --> 0:07:,000
which the New York Magazine described

163
0:07:01.058,000 --> 0:07:04,000
as a very oddly loyal crime wave, brand-loyal crime wave,

164
0:07:04.555,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and criminals are actually calling Tide "liquid gold."

165
0:07:07.908,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Now, what I thought was funny was the reaction

166
0:07:10.123,000 --> 0:07:11,000
from the P&G spokesperson.

167
0:07:11.467,000 --> 0:07:14,000
They said, obviously tried to dissociate themselves from drugs,

168
0:07:14.491,000 --> 0:07:16,000
but said, "It reminds me of one thing

169
0:07:16.897,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and that's the value of the brand has stayed consistent." (Laughter)

170
0:07:20.938,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Which backs up my point and shows he didn't even

171
0:07:22.799,000 --> 0:07:23,000
break a sweat when he said that.

172
0:07:24.636,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So that brings me back to the connection with sweat.

173
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:29,000
In Mexico, Nike has run a campaign recently

174
0:07:29.669,000 --> 0:07:3,000
called, literally, Bid Your Sweat.

175
0:07:31.443,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So you think about,

176
0:07:32.832,000 --> 0:07:33,000
these Nike shoes have got sensors in them,

177
0:07:34.566,000 --> 0:07:35,000
or you're using a Nike FuelBand

178
0:07:36.067,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that basically tracks your movement, your energy,

179
0:07:38.748,000 --> 0:07:39,000
your calorie consumption.

180
0:07:40.553,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And what's happening here, this is where you've actually

181
0:07:42.388,000 --> 0:07:45,000
elected to join that Nike community. You've bought into it.

182
0:07:45.418,000 --> 0:07:47,000
They're not advertising loud messages at you,

183
0:07:47.538,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and that's where advertising has started to shift now

184
0:07:49.736,000 --> 0:07:51,000
is into things like services, tools and applications.

185
0:07:52.39,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So Nike is literally acting as a well-being partner,

186
0:07:55.335,000 --> 0:07:57,000
a health and fitness partner and service provider.

187
0:07:58.22,000 --> 0:08:,000
So what happens with this is they're saying, "Right,

188
0:08:00.378,000 --> 0:08:02,000
you have a data dashboard. We know how far you've run,

189
0:08:02.974,000 --> 0:08:04,000
how far you've moved, what your calorie intake, all that sort of stuff.

190
0:08:05.743,000 --> 0:08:08,000
What you can do is, the more you run, the more points you get,

191
0:08:08.965,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and we have an auction where you can buy Nike stuff

192
0:08:11.943,000 --> 0:08:14,000
but only by proving that you've actually used the product to do stuff."

193
0:08:15.466,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And you can't come into this. This is purely

194
0:08:17.586,000 --> 0:08:18,000
for the community that are sweating

195
0:08:19.309,000 --> 0:08:21,000
using Nike products. You can't buy stuff with pesos.

196
0:08:21.944,000 --> 0:08:25,000
This is literally a closed environment, a closed auction space.

197
0:08:26.942,000 --> 0:08:29,000
In Africa, you know, airtime has become

198
0:08:30.343,000 --> 0:08:31,000
literally a currency in its own right.

199
0:08:32.177,000 --> 0:08:34,000
People are used to, because mobile is king,

200
0:08:34.28,000 --> 0:08:36,000
they're very, very used to transferring money,

201
0:08:37.125,000 --> 0:08:38,000
making payments via mobile.

202
0:08:39.103,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And one of my favorite examples from a brand perspective

203
0:08:41.794,000 --> 0:08:42,000
going on is Vodafone, where, in Egypt,

204
0:08:43.739,000 --> 0:08:45,000
lots of people make purchases in markets

205
0:08:46.448,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and very small independent stores.

206
0:08:48.229,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Loose change, small change is a real problem,

207
0:08:50.655,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and what tends to happen is you buy a bunch of stuff,

208
0:08:53.203,000 --> 0:08:53,000
you're due, say,

209
0:08:54.188,000 --> 0:08:56,000
10 cents, 20 cents in change.

210
0:08:56.331,000 --> 0:08:58,000
The shopkeepers tend to give you things like an onion

211
0:08:58.971,000 --> 0:08:59,000
or an aspirin, or a piece of gum,

212
0:09:00.471,000 --> 0:09:01,000
because they don't have small change.

213
0:09:02.199,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So when Vodafone came in and saw this problem,

214
0:09:04.366,000 --> 0:09:05,000
this consumer pain point, they created

215
0:09:05.817,000 --> 0:09:07,000
some small change which they call Fakka,

216
0:09:07.891,000 --> 0:09:08,000
which literally sits and is given

217
0:09:09.572,000 --> 0:09:11,000
by the shopkeepers to people,

218
0:09:11.767,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and it's credit that goes straight onto their mobile phone.

219
0:09:14.601,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So this currency becomes credit, which again,

220
0:09:16.987,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is really, really interesting.

221
0:09:18.455,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And we did a survey that backs up the fact that,

222
0:09:20.765,000 --> 0:09:21,000
you know, 45 percent of people

223
0:09:22.411,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in this very crucial demographic in the U.S.

224
0:09:25.705,000 --> 0:09:27,000
were saying that they're comfortable using

225
0:09:27.729,000 --> 0:09:29,000
an independent or branded currency.

226
0:09:30.242,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So that's getting really interesting here,

227
0:09:32.266,000 --> 0:09:33,000
a really interesting dynamic going on.

228
0:09:34.156,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And you think, corporations

229
0:09:35.681,000 --> 0:09:37,000
should start taking their assets and thinking of them

230
0:09:38.415,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in a different way and trading them.

231
0:09:40.95,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And you think, is it much of a leap?

232
0:09:43.41,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It seems farfetched, but when you think about it,

233
0:09:46.449,000 --> 0:09:48,000
in America in 1860,

234
0:09:49.167,000 --> 0:09:53,000
there were 1,600 corporations issuing banknotes.

235
0:09:53.374,000 --> 0:09:56,000
There were 8,000 kinds of notes in America.

236
0:09:56.674,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And the only thing that stopped that,

237
0:09:57.931,000 --> 0:09:59,000
the government controlled four percent of the supply,

238
0:10:00.539,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and the only thing that stopped it

239
0:10:02.183,000 --> 0:10:03,000
was the Civil War breaking out,

240
0:10:03.876,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and the government suddenly wanted to take control of the money.

241
0:10:06.948,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So government, money, war, nothing changes there, then.

242
0:10:10.59,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So what I'm going to ask is, basically,

243
0:10:13.445,000 --> 0:10:15,000
is history repeating itself?

244
0:10:15.84,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Is technology making paper money feel outmoded?

245
0:10:19.741,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Are we decoupling money from the government?

246
0:10:21.884,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You know, you think about, brands are starting to fill the gaps.

247
0:10:24.908,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Corporations are filling gaps that governments can't afford to fill.

248
0:10:28.139,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So I think, you know, will we be standing on stage

249
0:10:30.9,000 --> 0:10:33,000
buying a coffee -- organic, fair trade coffee -- next year

250
0:10:34.585,000 --> 0:10:36,000
using TED florins or TED shillings?

251
0:10:37.366,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Thank you very much.

252
0:10:39.053,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Applause)

253
0:10:41.253,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Thank you. (Applause)

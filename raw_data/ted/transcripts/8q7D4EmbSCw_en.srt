1
0:00:13.224,000 --> 0:00:16,000
My day starts just like yours.

2
0:00:17.581,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:22.57,000 --> 0:00:24,000
When I wake up in the morning,

4
0:00:24.61,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I check my phone,

5
0:00:26.822,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and then I have a cup of coffee.

6
0:00:29.512,000 --> 0:00:31,000
But then my day truly starts.

7
0:00:33.154,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It may not be like yours, because I live my life as an artwork.

8
0:00:40.289,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Picture yourself in a giant jewelry box

9
0:00:44.636,000 --> 0:00:47,000
with all the beautiful things that you have ever seen in your life.

10
0:00:49.336,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Then imagine that your body is a canvas.

11
0:00:54.568,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And on that canvas,

12
0:00:56.335,000 --> 0:01:01,000
you have a mission to create a masterpiece

13
0:01:01.421,000 --> 0:01:03,000
using the contents of your giant jewelry box.

14
0:01:05.757,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Once you've created your masterpiece,

15
0:01:08.79,000 --> 0:01:11,000
you might think, "Wow, I created that.

16
0:01:12.322,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This is who I am today."

17
0:01:14.736,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Then you would pick up your house keys,

18
0:01:16.715,000 --> 0:01:18,000
walk out the door into the real world,

19
0:01:18.985,000 --> 0:01:21,000
maybe take public transport to the center of the town ...

20
0:01:23.709,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Possibly walk along the streets or even go shopping.

21
0:01:27.731,000 --> 0:01:28,000
That's my life, every day.

22
0:01:30.686,000 --> 0:01:31,000
When I walk out the door,

23
0:01:32.103,000 --> 0:01:33,000
these artworks are me.

24
0:01:34.281,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I am art.

25
0:01:38.408,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I have lived as art my entire adult life.

26
0:01:42.324,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Living as art is how I became myself.

27
0:01:46.401,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I was brought up in a small village called Fillongley, in England,

28
0:01:50.515,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and it was last mentioned in the "Domesday Book,"

29
0:01:52.826,000 --> 0:01:53,000
so that's the mentality.

30
0:01:54.485,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:55.66,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I was raised by my grandparents,

32
0:01:58.006,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and they were antiques dealers,

33
0:01:59.804,000 --> 0:02:03,000
so I grew up surrounded by history and beautiful things.

34
0:02:04.621,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I had the most amazing dress-up box.

35
0:02:07.309,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So as you can imagine, it started then.

36
0:02:13.817,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I moved to London when I was 17 to become a model.

37
0:02:17.718,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And then I went to study photography.

38
0:02:20.995,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I wasn't really happy with myself at the time,

39
0:02:23.388,000 --> 0:02:24,000
so I was always looking for escapism.

40
0:02:25.884,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I studied the works of David LaChapelle

41
0:02:28.54,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and Steven Arnold,

42
0:02:29.85,000 --> 0:02:32,000
photographers who both curated and created worlds

43
0:02:33.498,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that were mind-blowing to me.

44
0:02:36.038,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So I decided one day to cross over from the superficial fashion world

45
0:02:41.911,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to the superficial art world.

46
0:02:43.594,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:44.991,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I decided to live my life as a work of art.

48
0:02:50.178,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I spend hours, sometimes months, making things.

49
0:02:53.807,000 --> 0:02:56,000
My go-to tool is a safety pin, like this --

50
0:02:57.22,000 --> 0:02:58,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:58.25,000 --> 0:02:59,000
They're never big enough.

52
0:02:59.502,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Laughter)

53
0:03:00.633,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And I use my fabrics time and time again,

54
0:03:03.181,000 --> 0:03:04,000
so I recycle everything that I use.

55
0:03:06.58,000 --> 0:03:09,000
When I get dressed I'm guided by color, texture and shape.

56
0:03:10.848,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I rarely have a theme.

57
0:03:12.865,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I find beautiful objects from all over the world,

58
0:03:15.183,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and I curate them into 3-D tapestries

59
0:03:18.045,000 --> 0:03:2,000
over a base layer that covers my whole body shape ...

60
0:03:20.729,000 --> 0:03:21,000
because I'm not very happy with my body.

61
0:03:22.694,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughs)

62
0:03:24.177,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I ask myself, "Should I take something off

63
0:03:26.201,000 --> 0:03:28,000
or should I put something on?

64
0:03:28.419,000 --> 0:03:29,000
100 pieces, maybe?"

65
0:03:29.616,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And sometimes, I do that.

66
0:03:32.963,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I promise you it's not too uncomfortable --

67
0:03:35.791,000 --> 0:03:36,000
well, just a little --

68
0:03:37.357,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:38.461,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I might have a safety pin poking at me sometimes

70
0:03:40.724,000 --> 0:03:41,000
when I'm having a conversation with you,

71
0:03:42.653,000 --> 0:03:43,000
so I'll kind of go off --

72
0:03:44.219,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:47.091,000 --> 0:03:5,000
It usually takes me about 20 minutes to get ready,

74
0:03:50.59,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which nobody ever believes.

75
0:03:53.828,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's true --

76
0:03:55.002,000 --> 0:03:56,000
sometimes.

77
0:03:56.942,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So, it's my version of a t-shirt and jeans.

78
0:03:59.701,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:01.949,000 --> 0:04:03,000
When I get dressed, I build like an architect.

80
0:04:04.892,000 --> 0:04:06,000
I carefully place things till I feel they belong.

81
0:04:08.157,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Then, I get a lot of my ideas from lucid dreaming.

82
0:04:11.18,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I actually go to sleep to come up with my ideas,

83
0:04:13.79,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and I've taught myself to wake up to write them down.

84
0:04:18.002,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I wear things till they fall apart,

85
0:04:20.019,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and then, I give them a new life.

86
0:04:22.686,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The gold outfit, for example --

87
0:04:24.447,000 --> 0:04:28,000
it was the outfit that I wore to the Houses of Parliament in London.

88
0:04:29.411,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's made of armor, sequins and broken jewelry,

89
0:04:32.268,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and I was the first person to wear armor to Parliament

90
0:04:35.039,000 --> 0:04:37,000
since Oliver Cromwell banned it in the 17th century.

91
0:04:38.889,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Things don't need to be expensive to be beautiful.

92
0:04:42.335,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Try making outfits out of bin liners or trash you found out on the streets.

93
0:04:47.144,000 --> 0:04:48,000
You never know,

94
0:04:48.319,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they might end up on the pages of "Vogue."

95
0:04:51.932,000 --> 0:04:53,000
There's over 6,000 pieces in my collection,

96
0:04:54.18,000 --> 0:04:58,000
ranging from 2,000-year-old Roman rings to ancient Buddhist artifacts.

97
0:04:59.066,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I believe in sharing what I do and what I have with others,

98
0:05:02.108,000 --> 0:05:04,000
so I decided to create an art exhibition,

99
0:05:05.07,000 --> 0:05:07,000
which is currently traveling to museums around the world.

100
0:05:09.08,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It contains an army of me --

101
0:05:11.329,000 --> 0:05:13,000
life-size sculptures as you can see behind me,

102
0:05:13.502,000 --> 0:05:14,000
they're here --

103
0:05:14.677,000 --> 0:05:15,000
they are my life, really.

104
0:05:15.918,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They're kind of like 3-D tapestries of my existence as living as art.

105
0:05:19.176,000 --> 0:05:21,000
They contain plastic crystals mixed with diamonds,

106
0:05:21.676,000 --> 0:05:23,000
beer cans and royal silks all in one look.

107
0:05:24.639,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I like the fact that the viewer can never make the assumption

108
0:05:27.532,000 --> 0:05:28,000
about what's real and what's fake.

109
0:05:29.599,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I find it important to explore and share cultures through my works.

110
0:05:35.746,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I use clothing as a means to investigate

111
0:05:38.18,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and appreciate people from all over the world.

112
0:05:41.557,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Sometimes, people think I'm a performer or a drag queen.

113
0:05:47.704,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I'm not.

114
0:05:49.149,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Although my life appears to be a performance,

115
0:05:52.749,000 --> 0:05:53,000
it's not.

116
0:05:54.149,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's very real.

117
0:05:56.791,000 --> 0:05:59,000
People respond to me as they would any other type of artwork.

118
0:06:00.272,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Many people are fascinated and engaged.

119
0:06:03.536,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Some people walk around me, staring, shy at first.

120
0:06:07.024,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Then they come up to me and they say they love or absolutely hate what I do.

121
0:06:12.242,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I sometimes respond, and other times I let the art talk for itself.

122
0:06:18.187,000 --> 0:06:21,000
The most annoying thing in the world is when people want to touch the artwork.

123
0:06:22.55,000 --> 0:06:23,000
But I understand.

124
0:06:24.822,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But like a lot of contemporary art,

125
0:06:26.555,000 --> 0:06:27,000
many people are dismissive.

126
0:06:28.059,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Some people are critical,

127
0:06:29.99,000 --> 0:06:3,000
others are abusive.

128
0:06:31.918,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I think it comes from the fear of the different --

129
0:06:34.833,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the unknown.

130
0:06:36.194,000 --> 0:06:38,000
There are so many reactions to what I do,

131
0:06:38.695,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and I've just learned not to take them personally.

132
0:06:42.803,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I've never lived as Daniel Lismore, the person.

133
0:06:45.36,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I've lived as Daniel Lismore, the artwork.

134
0:06:48.174,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And I've faced every obstacle as an artwork.

135
0:06:52.402,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It can be hard ...

136
0:06:54.318,000 --> 0:06:58,000
especially if your wardrobe takes up a 40-foot container,

137
0:06:58.483,000 --> 0:07:,000
three storage units and 30 boxes from IKEA --

138
0:07:01.421,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Laughter)

139
0:07:02.96,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and sometimes, it can be very difficult, getting into cars,

140
0:07:06.992,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and sometimes --

141
0:07:08.242,000 --> 0:07:1,000
well, this morning I didn't fit through my bathroom door,

142
0:07:10.934,000 --> 0:07:11,000
so that was a problem.

143
0:07:12.201,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Laughter)

144
0:07:13.872,000 --> 0:07:14,000
What does it mean to be yourself?

145
0:07:16.313,000 --> 0:07:17,000
People say it all the time,

146
0:07:18.206,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but what does it truly mean,

147
0:07:19.92,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and why does it matter?

148
0:07:22.257,000 --> 0:07:26,000
How does life change when you choose to be unapologetically yourself?

149
0:07:28.56,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I've had to face struggles and triumphs whilst living my life as art.

150
0:07:32.49,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I've been put on private jets

151
0:07:34.754,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and flown around the world.

152
0:07:36.724,000 --> 0:07:38,000
My work's been displayed in prestigious museums,

153
0:07:38.971,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and I've had the opportunity --

154
0:07:40.472,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that is my grandparents, by the way,

155
0:07:43.228,000 --> 0:07:44,000
they're the people that raised me,

156
0:07:44.967,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and there I am --

157
0:07:46.347,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Laughs)

158
0:07:47.372,000 --> 0:07:52,000
(Applause)

159
0:07:52.858,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So I've been put on private jets, flown around the world,

160
0:07:55.635,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and yet, it's not been that easy

161
0:07:57.724,000 --> 0:08:,000
because at times, I've been homeless,

162
0:08:00.82,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I've been spat at,

163
0:08:02.206,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I've been abused, sometimes daily,

164
0:08:04.12,000 --> 0:08:05,000
bullied my entire life,

165
0:08:06.032,000 --> 0:08:08,000
rejected by countless individuals,

166
0:08:08.518,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and I've been stabbed.

167
0:08:10.428,000 --> 0:08:11,000
But what hurt the most

168
0:08:12.358,000 --> 0:08:14,000
was being put on the "Worst Dressed" list.

169
0:08:14.541,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Laughter)

170
0:08:17.775,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It can be hard, being yourself,

171
0:08:20.13,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but I've found it's the best way.

172
0:08:21.927,000 --> 0:08:22,000
There's the "Worst Dressed."

173
0:08:23.308,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Laughs)

174
0:08:25.768,000 --> 0:08:27,000
As the quote goes, "Everyone else is already taken."

175
0:08:29.128,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I've come to realize that confidence is a concept you can choose.

176
0:08:32.991,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I've come to realize that authenticity is necessary, and it's powerful.

177
0:08:38.206,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I've tried to spend time being like other people.

178
0:08:41.741,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It didn't work.

179
0:08:43.362,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It's a lot of hard work, not being yourself.

180
0:08:47.6,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I have a few questions for you all.

181
0:08:50.612,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Who are you?

182
0:08:53.074,000 --> 0:08:54,000
How many versions of you are there?

183
0:08:55.85,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And I have one final question:

184
0:08:59.031,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Are you using them all to your advantage?

185
0:09:03.503,000 --> 0:09:06,000
In reality, everyone is capable of creating their own masterpiece.

186
0:09:07.847,000 --> 0:09:08,000
You should try it sometime.

187
0:09:09.652,000 --> 0:09:1,000
It's quite fun.

188
0:09:11.453,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Thank you.

189
0:09:12.628,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Applause and cheers)

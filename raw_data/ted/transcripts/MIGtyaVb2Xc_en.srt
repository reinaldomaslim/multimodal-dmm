1
0:00:12.875,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I've been a political cartoonist on the global stage for the last 20 years.

2
0:00:19.543,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Hey, we have seen a lot of things happen in those 20 years.

3
0:00:23.78,000 --> 0:00:26,000
We saw three different Catholic popes,

4
0:00:27.044,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and we witnessed that unique moment:

5
0:00:31.37,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the election of a pope on St. Peter's Square --

6
0:00:34.024,000 --> 0:00:36,000
you know, the little white smoke

7
0:00:37.571,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and the official announcement.

8
0:00:39.665,000 --> 0:00:4,000
[It's a boy!]

9
0:00:41.046,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:43.256,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Applause)

11
0:00:49.266,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We saw four American presidents.

12
0:00:52.789,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Obama, of course.

13
0:00:54.144,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Oh, Europeans liked him a lot.

14
0:00:56.582,000 --> 0:00:58,000
He was a multilateralist.

15
0:00:58.901,000 --> 0:00:59,000
He favored diplomacy.

16
0:01:00.167,000 --> 0:01:02,000
He wanted to be friends with Iran.

17
0:01:03.187,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:09.831,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And then ...

19
0:01:12.181,000 --> 0:01:14,000
reality imitated caricature

20
0:01:14.44,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the day Donald Trump became the President of the United States of America.

21
0:01:19.483,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:22.35,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Applause)

23
0:01:27.608,000 --> 0:01:29,000
You know, people come to us and they say,

24
0:01:30.116,000 --> 0:01:35,000
"It's too easy for you cartoonists. I mean -- with people like Trump?"

25
0:01:35.795,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Well, no, it's not easy

26
0:01:38.361,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to caricature a man who is himself a caricature.

27
0:01:41.893,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:43.25,000 --> 0:01:44,000
No.

29
0:01:44.443,000 --> 0:01:47,000
(Applause)

30
0:01:48.734,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Populists are no easy target for satire

31
0:01:51.756,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because you try to nail them down one day,

32
0:01:54.304,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and the next day, they outdo you.

33
0:01:55.945,000 --> 0:01:58,000
For example, as soon as he was elected,

34
0:01:59.355,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I tried to imagine the tweet that Trump would send on Christmas Eve.

35
0:02:03.519,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So I did this, OK?

36
0:02:05.623,000 --> 0:02:08,000
[Merry Christmas to all! Except all those pathetic losers. So sad.]

37
0:02:08.814,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:10.624,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And basically, the next day, Trump tweeted this:

39
0:02:13.228,000 --> 0:02:15,000
[Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies

40
0:02:15.72,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and those who have fought me and lost so badly

41
0:02:17.898,000 --> 0:02:18,000
they just don't know what to do. Love!]

42
0:02:19.793,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:20.999,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's the same!

44
0:02:22.467,000 --> 0:02:24,000
(Applause)

45
0:02:25.071,000 --> 0:02:27,000
This is the era of strongmen.

46
0:02:27.559,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And soon, Donald Trump was able to meet his personal hero, Vladimir Putin,

47
0:02:32.959,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and this is how the first meeting went:

48
0:02:35.779,000 --> 0:02:37,000
[I'll help you find the hackers. Give me your password.]

49
0:02:38.498,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:41.268,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And I'm not inventing anything.

51
0:02:44.427,000 --> 0:02:48,000
He came out of that first meeting saying that the two of them had agreed

52
0:02:48.488,000 --> 0:02:5,000
on a joint task force on cybersecurity.

53
0:02:50.904,000 --> 0:02:52,000
This is true, if you do remember.

54
0:02:53.264,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Oh, who would have imagined the things we saw over these 20 years.

55
0:02:57.946,000 --> 0:03:,000
We saw Great Britain run towards a European Union exit.

56
0:03:01.571,000 --> 0:03:02,000
[Hard Brexit?]

57
0:03:02.766,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Laughter)

58
0:03:08.369,000 --> 0:03:1,000
In the Middle East, we believed for a while

59
0:03:10.871,000 --> 0:03:13,000
in the democratic miracle of the Arab Spring.

60
0:03:14.08,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We saw dictators fall, we saw others hang on.

61
0:03:18.497,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Laughter)

62
0:03:21.107,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And then there is the timeless Kim dynasty of North Korea.

63
0:03:25.038,000 --> 0:03:28,000
These guys seem to be coming straight out of Cartoon Network.

64
0:03:28.393,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I was blessed to be able to draw two of them.

65
0:03:31.512,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Kim Jong-il, the father,

66
0:03:33.289,000 --> 0:03:36,000
when he died a few years ago, that was a very dangerous moment.

67
0:03:36.631,000 --> 0:03:37,000
[That was close!]

68
0:03:37.848,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:40.495,000 --> 0:03:41,000
That was --

70
0:03:41.723,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Applause)

71
0:03:46.977,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And then the son, Kim Jong-un,

72
0:03:49.671,000 --> 0:03:51,000
proved himself a worthy successor to the throne.

73
0:03:52.376,000 --> 0:03:54,000
He's now friends with the US president.

74
0:03:54.95,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They meet each other all the time, and they talk like friends.

75
0:03:59.527,000 --> 0:04:,000
[What kind of hair gel?]

76
0:04:01.089,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

77
0:04:06.138,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Should we be surprised

78
0:04:08.402,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to be living in a world

79
0:04:10.209,000 --> 0:04:12,000
ruled by egomaniacs?

80
0:04:12.796,000 --> 0:04:14,000
What if they were just a reflection of ourselves?

81
0:04:16.081,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I mean, look at us, each of us.

82
0:04:19.004,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:21.737,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Yeah, we love our smartphones;

84
0:04:25.324,000 --> 0:04:27,000
we love our selfies;

85
0:04:27.448,000 --> 0:04:28,000
we love ourselves.

86
0:04:29.081,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And thanks to Facebook, we have a lot of friends

87
0:04:32.951,000 --> 0:04:33,000
all over the world.

88
0:04:34.836,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Mark Zuckerberg is our friend.

89
0:04:38.38,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:42.571,000 --> 0:04:45,000
You know, he and his peers in Silicon Valley

91
0:04:45.861,000 --> 0:04:47,000
are the kings and the emperors

92
0:04:48.83,000 --> 0:04:49,000
of our time.

93
0:04:51.124,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Showing that the emperors have no clothes,

94
0:04:55.62,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that's the task of satire, right?

95
0:04:57.909,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Speaking truth to power.

96
0:04:59.264,000 --> 0:05:03,000
This has always been the historical role of political cartooning.

97
0:05:03.548,000 --> 0:05:07,000
In the 1830s, postrevolutionary France under King Louis Philippe,

98
0:05:08.509,000 --> 0:05:12,000
journalists and caricaturists fought hard for the freedom of the press.

99
0:05:13.725,000 --> 0:05:16,000
They were jailed, they were fined, but they prevailed.

100
0:05:17.215,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And this caricature of the king by Daumier

101
0:05:21.107,000 --> 0:05:23,000
came to define the monarch.

102
0:05:23.146,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It marked history.

103
0:05:24.582,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It became the timeless symbol of satire triumphing over autocracy.

104
0:05:31.168,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Today, 200 years after Daumier,

105
0:05:33.863,000 --> 0:05:37,000
are political cartoons at risk of disappearing?

106
0:05:39.942,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Take this blank space on the front page of Turkish opposition newspaper "Cumhuriyet."

107
0:05:45.755,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This is where Musa Kart's cartoon used to appear.

108
0:05:49.228,000 --> 0:05:54,000
In 2018, Musa Kart was sentenced to three years in jail.

109
0:05:54.345,000 --> 0:05:55,000
For doing what?

110
0:05:55.675,000 --> 0:05:59,000

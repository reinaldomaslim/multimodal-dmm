2
0:00:15.693,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I want you to imagine this for a moment.

3
0:00:18.464,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Two men, Rahul and Rajiv,

4
0:00:21.359,000 --> 0:00:22,000
living in the same neighborhood,

5
0:00:23.217,000 --> 0:00:26,000
from the same educational background, similar occupation,

6
0:00:26.512,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and they both turn up at their local accident emergency

7
0:00:29.28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
complaining of acute chest pain.

8
0:00:32.096,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Rahul is offered a cardiac procedure,

9
0:00:35.22,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but Rajiv is sent home.

10
0:00:38.031,000 --> 0:00:4,000
What might explain the difference in the experience

11
0:00:40.541,000 --> 0:00:43,000
of these two nearly identical men?

12
0:00:43.793,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Rajiv suffers from a mental illness.

13
0:00:47.28,000 --> 0:00:5,000
The difference in the quality of medical care

14
0:00:50.379,000 --> 0:00:52,000
received by people with mental illness is one of the reasons

15
0:00:53.24,000 --> 0:00:54,000
why they live shorter lives

16
0:00:55.155,000 --> 0:00:56,000
than people without mental illness.

17
0:00:56.738,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Even in the best-resourced countries in the world,

18
0:00:59.408,000 --> 0:01:03,000
this life expectancy gap is as much as 20 years.

19
0:01:04.178,000 --> 0:01:05,000
In the developing countries of the world, this gap

20
0:01:06.103,000 --> 0:01:08,000
is even larger.

21
0:01:08.728,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But of course, mental illnesses can kill in more direct ways

22
0:01:11.587,000 --> 0:01:14,000
as well. The most obvious example is suicide.

23
0:01:14.948,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It might surprise some of you here, as it did me,

24
0:01:17.603,000 --> 0:01:19,000
when I discovered that suicide is at the top of the list

25
0:01:20.54,000 --> 0:01:22,000
of the leading causes of death in young people

26
0:01:23.105,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in all countries in the world,

27
0:01:24.753,000 --> 0:01:27,000
including the poorest countries of the world.

28
0:01:28.145,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But beyond the impact of a health condition

29
0:01:30.979,000 --> 0:01:32,000
on life expectancy, we're also concerned

30
0:01:33.349,000 --> 0:01:35,000
about the quality of life lived.

31
0:01:36.043,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Now, in order for us to examine the overall impact

32
0:01:38.292,000 --> 0:01:4,000
of a health condition both on life expectancy

33
0:01:40.665,000 --> 0:01:43,000
as well as on the quality of life lived, we need to use

34
0:01:43.823,000 --> 0:01:44,000
a metric called the DALY,

35
0:01:45.209,000 --> 0:01:49,000
which stands for a Disability-Adjusted Life Year.

36
0:01:49.496,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Now when we do that, we discover some startling things

37
0:01:52.017,000 --> 0:01:54,000
about mental illness from a global perspective.

38
0:01:54.839,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We discover that, for example, mental illnesses are

39
0:01:58.103,000 --> 0:02:02,000
amongst the leading causes of disability around the world.

40
0:02:02.691,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Depression, for example, is the third-leading cause

41
0:02:05.426,000 --> 0:02:07,000
of disability, alongside conditions such as

42
0:02:08.398,000 --> 0:02:11,000
diarrhea and pneumonia in children.

43
0:02:11.75,000 --> 0:02:13,000
When you put all the mental illnesses together,

44
0:02:13.854,000 --> 0:02:15,000
they account for roughly 15 percent

45
0:02:16.116,000 --> 0:02:19,000
of the total global burden of disease.

46
0:02:19.322,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Indeed, mental illnesses are also very damaging

47
0:02:23.833,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to people's lives, but beyond just the burden of disease,

48
0:02:29.278,000 --> 0:02:31,000
let us consider the absolute numbers.

49
0:02:31.99,000 --> 0:02:33,000
The World Health Organization estimates

50
0:02:34.049,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that there are nearly four to five hundred million people

51
0:02:37.154,000 --> 0:02:39,000
living on our tiny planet

52
0:02:39.337,000 --> 0:02:4,000
who are affected by a mental illness.

53
0:02:40.998,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Now some of you here

54
0:02:42.717,000 --> 0:02:44,000
look a bit astonished by that number,

55
0:02:45.315,000 --> 0:02:47,000
but consider for a moment the incredible diversity

56
0:02:47.808,000 --> 0:02:5,000
of mental illnesses, from autism and intellectual disability

57
0:02:50.962,000 --> 0:02:52,000
in childhood, through to depression and anxiety,

58
0:02:53.643,000 --> 0:02:55,000
substance misuse and psychosis in adulthood,

59
0:02:55.924,000 --> 0:02:56,000
all the way through to dementia in old age,

60
0:02:57.56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and I'm pretty sure that each and every one us

61
0:03:00.514,000 --> 0:03:03,000
present here today can think of at least one person,

62
0:03:03.866,000 --> 0:03:06,000
at least one person, who's affected by mental illness

63
0:03:07.188,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in our most intimate social networks.

64
0:03:11.619,000 --> 0:03:14,000
I see some nodding heads there.

65
0:03:14.824,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But beyond the staggering numbers,

66
0:03:17.794,000 --> 0:03:2,000
what's truly important from a global health point of view,

67
0:03:20.803,000 --> 0:03:22,000
what's truly worrying from a global health point of view,

68
0:03:23.348,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is that the vast majority of these affected individuals

69
0:03:26.516,000 --> 0:03:28,000
do not receive the care

70
0:03:28.525,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that we know can transform their lives, and remember,

71
0:03:30.991,000 --> 0:03:33,000
we do have robust evidence that a range of interventions,

72
0:03:34.052,000 --> 0:03:36,000
medicines, psychological interventions,

73
0:03:36.504,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and social interventions, can make a vast difference.

74
0:03:39.992,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And yet, even in the best-resourced countries,

75
0:03:42.243,000 --> 0:03:44,000
for example here in Europe, roughly 50 percent

76
0:03:45.178,000 --> 0:03:48,000
of affected people don't receive these interventions.

77
0:03:48.295,000 --> 0:03:5,000
In the sorts of countries I work in,

78
0:03:50.612,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that so-called treatment gap

79
0:03:52.762,000 --> 0:03:56,000
approaches an astonishing 90 percent.

80
0:03:57.649,000 --> 0:04:,000
It isn't surprising, then, that if you should speak

81
0:04:00.861,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to anyone affected by a mental illness,

82
0:04:03.292,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the chances are that you will hear stories

83
0:04:06.104,000 --> 0:04:1,000
of hidden suffering, shame and discrimination

84
0:04:10.154,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in nearly every sector of their lives.

85
0:04:13.103,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But perhaps most heartbreaking of all

86
0:04:15.813,000 --> 0:04:17,000
are the stories of the abuse

87
0:04:18.502,000 --> 0:04:2,000
of even the most basic human rights,

88
0:04:21.034,000 --> 0:04:23,000
such as the young woman shown in this image here

89
0:04:23.891,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that are played out every day,

90
0:04:25.955,000 --> 0:04:28,000
sadly, even in the very institutions that were built to care

91
0:04:29.899,000 --> 0:04:32,000
for people with mental illnesses, the mental hospitals.

92
0:04:33.734,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's this injustice that has really driven my mission

93
0:04:36.762,000 --> 0:04:38,000
to try to do a little bit to transform the lives

94
0:04:39.154,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of people affected by mental illness, and a particularly

95
0:04:41.9,000 --> 0:04:44,000
critical action that I focused on is to bridge the gulf

96
0:04:45.749,000 --> 0:04:47,000
between the knowledge we have that can transform lives,

97
0:04:48.535,000 --> 0:04:5,000
the knowledge of effective treatments, and how we actually

98
0:04:50.977,000 --> 0:04:53,000
use that knowledge in the everyday world.

99
0:04:54.399,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And an especially important challenge that I've had to face

100
0:04:57.558,000 --> 0:04:59,000
is the great shortage of mental health professionals,

101
0:05:00.483,000 --> 0:05:01,000
such as psychiatrists and psychologists,

102
0:05:02.155,000 --> 0:05:04,000
particularly in the developing world.

103
0:05:04.943,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Now I trained in medicine in India, and after that

104
0:05:07.628,000 --> 0:05:1,000
I chose psychiatry as my specialty, much to the dismay

105
0:05:11.047,000 --> 0:05:13,000
of my mother and all my family members who

106
0:05:13.275,000 --> 0:05:14,000
kind of thought neurosurgery would be

107
0:05:14.978,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a more respectable option for their brilliant son.

108
0:05:18.147,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Any case, I went on, I soldiered on with psychiatry,

109
0:05:20.881,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and found myself training in Britain in some of

110
0:05:23.176,000 --> 0:05:25,000
the best hospitals in this country. I was very privileged.

111
0:05:25.551,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I worked in a team of incredibly talented, compassionate,

112
0:05:29.094,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but most importantly, highly trained, specialized

113
0:05:32.345,000 --> 0:05:34,000
mental health professionals.

114
0:05:34.536,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Soon after my training, I found myself working

115
0:05:36.508,000 --> 0:05:38,000
first in Zimbabwe and then in India, and I was confronted

116
0:05:38.951,000 --> 0:05:4,000
by an altogether new reality.

117
0:05:41.811,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This was a reality of a world in which there were almost no

118
0:05:45.157,000 --> 0:05:47,000
mental health professionals at all.

119
0:05:47.522,000 --> 0:05:49,000
In Zimbabwe, for example, there were just about

120
0:05:49.556,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a dozen psychiatrists, most of whom lived and worked

121
0:05:52.616,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in Harare city, leaving only a couple

122
0:05:54.742,000 --> 0:05:56,000
to address the mental health care needs

123
0:05:57.135,000 --> 0:06:,000
of nine million people living in the countryside.

124
0:06:00.803,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In India, I found the situation was not a lot better.

125
0:06:04.42,000 --> 0:06:06,000
To give you a perspective, if I had to translate

126
0:06:06.843,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the proportion of psychiatrists in the population

127
0:06:09.051,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that one might see in Britain to India,

128
0:06:11.433,000 --> 0:06:16,000
one might expect roughly 150,000 psychiatrists in India.

129
0:06:17.042,000 --> 0:06:2,000
In reality, take a guess.

130
0:06:20.073,000 --> 0:06:22,000
The actual number is about 3,000,

131
0:06:22.638,000 --> 0:06:24,000
about two percent of that number.

132
0:06:25.102,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It became quickly apparent to me that I couldn't follow

133
0:06:27.599,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the sorts of mental health care models that I had been trained in,

134
0:06:30.66,000 --> 0:06:32,000
one that relied heavily on specialized, expensive

135
0:06:33.599,000 --> 0:06:35,000
mental health professionals to provide mental health care

136
0:06:36.131,000 --> 0:06:38,000
in countries like India and Zimbabwe.

137
0:06:38.591,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I had to think out of the box about some other model

138
0:06:41.244,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of care.

139
0:06:42.867,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It was then that I came across these books,

140
0:06:45.98,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and in these books I discovered the idea of task shifting

141
0:06:49.223,000 --> 0:06:51,000
in global health.

142
0:06:51.291,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The idea is actually quite simple. The idea is,

143
0:06:53.567,000 --> 0:06:56,000
when you're short of specialized health care professionals,

144
0:06:56.581,000 --> 0:06:59,000
use whoever is available in the community,

145
0:06:59.63,000 --> 0:07:01,000
train them to provide a range of health care interventions,

146
0:07:02.567,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and in these books I read inspiring examples,

147
0:07:05.435,000 --> 0:07:07,000
for example of how ordinary people had been trained

148
0:07:08.371,000 --> 0:07:09,000
to deliver babies,

149
0:07:09.724,000 --> 0:07:12,000
diagnose and treat early pneumonia, to great effect.

150
0:07:13.355,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And it struck me that if you could train ordinary people

151
0:07:16.106,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to deliver such complex health care interventions,

152
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
then perhaps they could also do the same

153
0:07:20.403,000 --> 0:07:21,000
with mental health care.

154
0:07:22.395,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Well today, I'm very pleased to report to you

155
0:07:25.264,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that there have been many experiments in task shifting

156
0:07:28.376,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in mental health care across the developing world

157
0:07:31.147,000 --> 0:07:33,000
over the past decade, and I want to share with you

158
0:07:33.21,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the findings of three particular such experiments,

159
0:07:35.907,000 --> 0:07:37,000
all three of which focused on depression,

160
0:07:37.994,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the most common of all mental illnesses.

161
0:07:40.429,000 --> 0:07:43,000
In rural Uganda, Paul Bolton and his colleagues,

162
0:07:43.771,000 --> 0:07:46,000
using villagers, demonstrated that they could deliver

163
0:07:47.615,000 --> 0:07:49,000
interpersonal psychotherapy for depression

164
0:07:49.97,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and, using a randomized control design,

165
0:07:52.642,000 --> 0:07:54,000
showed that 90 percent of the people receiving

166
0:07:54.887,000 --> 0:07:55,000
this intervention recovered as compared

167
0:07:56.847,000 --> 0:07:59,000
to roughly 40 percent in the comparison villages.

168
0:08:00.388,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Similarly, using a randomized control trial in rural Pakistan,

169
0:08:04.528,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Atif Rahman and his colleagues showed

170
0:08:06.868,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that lady health visitors, who are community maternal

171
0:08:09.603,000 --> 0:08:11,000
health workers in Pakistan's health care system,

172
0:08:12.392,000 --> 0:08:14,000
could deliver cognitive behavior therapy for mothers

173
0:08:14.609,000 --> 0:08:16,000
who were depressed, again showing dramatic differences

174
0:08:17.117,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in the recovery rates. Roughly 75 percent of mothers

175
0:08:19.964,000 --> 0:08:21,000
recovered as compared to about 45 percent

176
0:08:22.529,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in the comparison villages.

177
0:08:24.813,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And in my own trial in Goa, in India, we again showed

178
0:08:27.899,000 --> 0:08:29,000
that lay counselors drawn from local communities

179
0:08:30.427,000 --> 0:08:32,000
could be trained to deliver psychosocial interventions

180
0:08:33.111,000 --> 0:08:35,000
for depression, anxiety, leading to 70 percent

181
0:08:35.693,000 --> 0:08:37,000
recovery rates as compared to 50 percent

182
0:08:37.776,000 --> 0:08:4,000
in the comparison primary health centers.

183
0:08:40.982,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Now, if I had to draw together all these different

184
0:08:42.951,000 --> 0:08:44,000
experiments in task shifting, and there have of course

185
0:08:45.483,000 --> 0:08:47,000
been many other examples, and try and identify

186
0:08:47.857,000 --> 0:08:49,000
what are the key lessons we can learn that makes

187
0:08:49.875,000 --> 0:08:52,000
for a successful task shifting operation,

188
0:08:52.953,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I have coined this particular acronym, SUNDAR.

189
0:08:56.809,000 --> 0:09:,000
What SUNDAR stands for, in Hindi, is "attractive."

190
0:09:01.043,000 --> 0:09:03,000
It seems to me that there are five key lessons

191
0:09:03.258,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that I've shown on this slide that are critically important

192
0:09:05.857,000 --> 0:09:07,000
for effective task shifting.

193
0:09:08.04,000 --> 0:09:11,000
The first is that we need to simplify the message

194
0:09:11.066,000 --> 0:09:13,000
that we're using, stripping away all the jargon

195
0:09:13.45,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that medicine has invented around itself.

196
0:09:16.771,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We need to unpack complex health care interventions

197
0:09:19.728,000 --> 0:09:21,000
into smaller components that can be more easily

198
0:09:21.956,000 --> 0:09:23,000
transferred to less-trained individuals.

199
0:09:24.611,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We need to deliver health care, not in large institutions,

200
0:09:27.178,000 --> 0:09:29,000
but close to people's homes, and we need to deliver

201
0:09:29.404,000 --> 0:09:31,000
health care using whoever is available and affordable

202
0:09:32.176,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in our local communities.

203
0:09:34.557,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And importantly, we need to reallocate the few specialists

204
0:09:37.437,000 --> 0:09:39,000
who are available to perform roles

205
0:09:39.505,000 --> 0:09:42,000
such as capacity-building and supervision.

206
0:09:42.983,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Now for me, task shifting is an idea

207
0:09:45.315,000 --> 0:09:47,000
with truly global significance,

208
0:09:48.274,000 --> 0:09:5,000
because even though it has arisen out of the

209
0:09:50.807,000 --> 0:09:53,000
situation of the lack of resources that you find

210
0:09:54.305,000 --> 0:09:56,000
in developing countries, I think it has a lot of significance

211
0:09:57.264,000 --> 0:09:59,000
for better-resourced countries as well. Why is that?

212
0:10:00.145,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Well, in part, because health care in the developed world,

213
0:10:03.665,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the health care costs in the [developed] world,

214
0:10:06.14,000 --> 0:10:08,000
are rapidly spiraling out of control, and a huge chunk

215
0:10:08.717,000 --> 0:10:11,000
of those costs are human resource costs.

216
0:10:12.137,000 --> 0:10:14,000
But equally important is because health care has become

217
0:10:14.623,000 --> 0:10:17,000
so incredibly professionalized that it's become very remote

218
0:10:18.46,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and removed from local communities.

219
0:10:21.215,000 --> 0:10:24,000
For me, what's truly sundar about the idea of task shifting,

220
0:10:24.937,000 --> 0:10:25,000
though, isn't that it simply makes health care

221
0:10:26.583,000 --> 0:10:29,000
more accessible and affordable but that

222
0:10:29.741,000 --> 0:10:31,000
it is also fundamentally empowering.

223
0:10:32.297,000 --> 0:10:35,000
It empowers ordinary people to be more effective

224
0:10:35.929,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in caring for the health of others in their community,

225
0:10:38.752,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and in doing so, to become better guardians

226
0:10:40.241,000 --> 0:10:43,000
of their own health. Indeed, for me, task shifting

227
0:10:43.523,000 --> 0:10:45,000
is the ultimate example of the democratization

228
0:10:46.21,000 --> 0:10:51,000
of medical knowledge, and therefore, medical power.

229
0:10:51.459,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Just over 30 years ago, the nations of the world assembled

230
0:10:54.91,000 --> 0:10:56,000
at Alma-Ata and made this iconic declaration.

231
0:10:57.883,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Well, I think all of you can guess

232
0:10:59.488,000 --> 0:11:02,000
that 12 years on, we're still nowhere near that goal.

233
0:11:03.203,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Still, today, armed with that knowledge

234
0:11:05.868,000 --> 0:11:07,000
that ordinary people in the community

235
0:11:08.524,000 --> 0:11:11,000
can be trained and, with sufficient supervision and support,

236
0:11:11.687,000 --> 0:11:14,000
can deliver a range of health care interventions effectively,

237
0:11:14.959,000 --> 0:11:17,000
perhaps that promise is within reach now.

238
0:11:18.84,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Indeed, to implement the slogan of Health for All,

239
0:11:22.484,000 --> 0:11:23,000
we will need to involve all

240
0:11:24.27,000 --> 0:11:25,000
in that particular journey,

241
0:11:25.929,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and in the case of mental health, in particular we would

242
0:11:28.875,000 --> 0:11:3,000
need to involve people who are affected by mental illness

243
0:11:31.778,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and their caregivers.

244
0:11:33.232,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It is for this reason that, some years ago,

245
0:11:35.768,000 --> 0:11:36,000
the Movement for Global Mental Health was founded

246
0:11:37.686,000 --> 0:11:41,000
as a sort of a virtual platform upon which professionals

247
0:11:41.709,000 --> 0:11:43,000
like myself and people affected by mental illness

248
0:11:44.516,000 --> 0:11:46,000
could stand together, shoulder-to-shoulder,

249
0:11:47.228,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and advocate for the rights of people with mental illness

250
0:11:49.714,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to receive the care that we know can transform their lives,

251
0:11:52.931,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and to live a life with dignity.

252
0:11:55.94,000 --> 0:11:58,000
And in closing, when you have a moment of peace or quiet

253
0:11:59.457,000 --> 0:12:01,000
in these very busy few days or perhaps afterwards,

254
0:12:02.283,000 --> 0:12:04,000
spare a thought for that person you thought about

255
0:12:05.037,000 --> 0:12:07,000
who has a mental illness, or persons that you thought about

256
0:12:07.614,000 --> 0:12:08,000
who have mental illness,

257
0:12:09.202,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and dare to care for them. Thank you. (Applause)

258
0:12:13.006,000 --> 0:12:17,000
(Applause)

0:00:12.039,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Over the last two decades, India has become

3
0:00:15.013,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a global hub for software development

4
0:00:18.052,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and offshoring of back office services, as we call it,

5
0:00:22.079,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and what we were interested in finding out was that

6
0:00:27.099,000 --> 0:00:3,000
because of this huge industry that has started

7
0:00:31.039,000 --> 0:00:33,000
over the last two decades in India,

8
0:00:33.05,000 --> 0:00:35,000
offshoring software development and back office services,

9
0:00:36.041,000 --> 0:00:38,000
there's been a flight of white collar jobs

10
0:00:38.064,000 --> 0:00:41,000
from the developed world to India.

11
0:00:42.015,000 --> 0:00:45,000
When this is combined with the loss of manufacturing jobs

12
0:00:45.071,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to China, it has, you know, led to considerable angst

13
0:00:49.001,000 --> 0:00:52,000
amongst the Western populations.

14
0:00:52.089,000 --> 0:00:54,000
In fact, if you look at polls, they show a declining

15
0:00:55.051,000 --> 0:01:,000
trend for support for free trade in the West.

16
0:01:00.087,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Now, the Western elites, however, have said

17
0:01:03.086,000 --> 0:01:05,000
this fear is misplaced.

18
0:01:05.086,000 --> 0:01:07,000
For example, if you have read — I suspect many of you

19
0:01:08.008,000 --> 0:01:11,000
have done so — read the book by Thomas Friedman

20
0:01:11.04,000 --> 0:01:14,000
called "The World Is Flat," he said, basically, in his book

21
0:01:14.074,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that, you know, this fear for free trade is wrong

22
0:01:18.093,000 --> 0:01:2,000
because it assumes, it's based on a mistaken assumption

23
0:01:21.067,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that everything that can be invented has been invented.

24
0:01:25.051,000 --> 0:01:27,000
In fact, he says, it's innovation that will keep the West

25
0:01:28.037,000 --> 0:01:29,000
ahead of the developing world,

26
0:01:30.01,000 --> 0:01:33,000
with the more sophisticated, innovative tasks being done

27
0:01:33.052,000 --> 0:01:35,000
in the developed world, and the less sophisticated,

28
0:01:36.025,000 --> 0:01:37,000
shall we say, drudge work being done

29
0:01:37.083,000 --> 0:01:4,000
in the developing world.

30
0:01:40.099,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now, what we were trying to understand was,

31
0:01:44.031,000 --> 0:01:46,000
is this true?

32
0:01:47.007,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Could India become a source, or a global hub,

33
0:01:50.086,000 --> 0:01:53,000
of innovation, just like it's become a global hub

34
0:01:54.003,000 --> 0:01:57,000
for back office services and software development?

35
0:01:57.09,000 --> 0:02:,000
And for the last four years, my coauthor Phanish Puranam

36
0:02:01.072,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and I spent investigating this topic.

37
0:02:05.002,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Initially, or, you know, as people would say, you know,

38
0:02:09.002,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in fact the more aggressive people who are supporting

39
0:02:11.043,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the Western innovative model, say,

40
0:02:13.069,000 --> 0:02:15,000
"Where are the Indian Googles, iPods and Viagras,

41
0:02:16.027,000 --> 0:02:2,000
if the Indians are so bloody smart?" (Laughter)

42
0:02:20.053,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So initially, when we started our research, we went

43
0:02:22.088,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and met several executives, and we asked them,

44
0:02:24.098,000 --> 0:02:26,000
"What do you think? Will India go from being a favored

45
0:02:27.027,000 --> 0:02:3,000
destination for software services and back office services

46
0:02:30.027,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to a destination for innovation?"

47
0:02:33.037,000 --> 0:02:34,000
They laughed. They dismissed us.

48
0:02:35.023,000 --> 0:02:38,000
They said, "You know what? Indians don't do innovation."

49
0:02:38.03,000 --> 0:02:4,000
The more polite ones said, "Well, you know, Indians

50
0:02:40.06,000 --> 0:02:43,000
make good software programmers and accountants,

51
0:02:43.067,000 --> 0:02:45,000
but they can't do the creative stuff."

52
0:02:46.017,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Sometimes, it took a more, took a veneer of sophistication,

53
0:02:50.083,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and people said, "You know, it's nothing to do with Indians.

54
0:02:53.033,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It's really the rule-based, regimented education system

55
0:02:56.094,000 --> 0:03:,000
in India that is responsible for killing all creativity."

56
0:03:01.032,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They said, instead, if you want to see real creativity,

57
0:03:03.086,000 --> 0:03:04,000
go to Silicon Valley, and look at companies

58
0:03:05.085,000 --> 0:03:07,000
like Google, Microsoft, Intel.

59
0:03:08.051,000 --> 0:03:1,000
So we started examining the R&amp;D and innovation labs

60
0:03:11.005,000 --> 0:03:13,000
of Silicon Valley.

61
0:03:13.057,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Well, interestingly, what you find there is,

62
0:03:15.071,000 --> 0:03:17,000
usually you are introduced to the head of the innovation lab

63
0:03:18.064,000 --> 0:03:19,000
or the R&amp;D center as they may call it,

64
0:03:20.061,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and more often than not, it's an Indian. (Laughter)

65
0:03:24.024,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So I immediately said, "Well, but you could not have been

66
0:03:27.027,000 --> 0:03:28,000
educated in India, right?

67
0:03:28.062,000 --> 0:03:29,000
You must have gotten your education here."

68
0:03:30.018,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It turned out, in every single case,

69
0:03:34.004,000 --> 0:03:38,000
they came out of the Indian educational system.

70
0:03:38.026,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So we realized that maybe we had the wrong question,

71
0:03:40.075,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and the right question is, really, can Indians

72
0:03:43.062,000 --> 0:03:46,000
based out of India do innovative work?

73
0:03:47.042,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So off we went to India. We made, I think,

74
0:03:49.07,000 --> 0:03:52,000
about a dozen trips to Bangalore, Mumbai, Gurgaon,

75
0:03:52.092,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Delhi, Hyderabad, you name it, to examine

76
0:03:55.011,000 --> 0:04:,000
what is the level of corporate innovation in these cities.

77
0:04:00.036,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And what we found was, as we progressed in our research,

78
0:04:02.094,000 --> 0:04:04,000
was, that we were asking really the wrong question.

79
0:04:05.09,000 --> 0:04:06,000
When you ask, "Where are the Indian Googles,

80
0:04:07.065,000 --> 0:04:11,000
iPods and Viagras?" you are taking a particular perspective

81
0:04:11.099,000 --> 0:04:15,000
on innovation, which is innovation for end users,

82
0:04:16.015,000 --> 0:04:17,000
visible innovation.

83
0:04:17.078,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Instead, innovation, if you remember, some of you

84
0:04:21.047,000 --> 0:04:23,000
may have read the famous economist Schumpeter,

85
0:04:23.048,000 --> 0:04:25,000
he said, "Innovation is novelty

86
0:04:25.055,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in how value is created and distributed."

87
0:04:29.031,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It could be new products and services,

88
0:04:31.044,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but it could also be new ways of producing products.

89
0:04:33.077,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It could also be novel ways of organizing firms and industries.

90
0:04:36.091,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Once you take this, there's no reason to restrict innovation,

91
0:04:40.077,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the beneficiaries of innovation, just to end users.

92
0:04:44.077,000 --> 0:04:46,000
When you take this broader conceptualization of innovation,

93
0:04:47.038,000 --> 0:04:5,000
what we found was, India is well represented

94
0:04:50.072,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in innovation, but the innovation that is being done in India

95
0:04:54.006,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is of a form we did not anticipate, and what we did was

96
0:04:57.026,000 --> 0:04:59,000
we called it "invisible innovation."

97
0:04:59.091,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And specifically, there are four types of invisible innovation

98
0:05:02.078,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that are coming out of India.

99
0:05:04.098,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The first type of invisible innovation out of India

100
0:05:07.068,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is what we call innovation for business customers,

101
0:05:10.057,000 --> 0:05:12,000
which is led by the multinational corporations,

102
0:05:13.042,000 --> 0:05:15,000
which have -- in the last two decades, there have been

103
0:05:16.035,000 --> 0:05:22,000
750 R&amp;D centers set up in India by multinational companies

104
0:05:22.064,000 --> 0:05:26,000
employing more than 400,000 professionals.

105
0:05:26.086,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Now, when you consider the fact that, historically,

106
0:05:31.012,000 --> 0:05:34,000
the R&amp;D center of a multinational company

107
0:05:34.029,000 --> 0:05:38,000
was always in the headquarters, or in the country of origin

108
0:05:38.098,000 --> 0:05:41,000
of that multinational company, to have 750 R&amp;D centers

109
0:05:42.088,000 --> 0:05:44,000
of multinational corporations in India

110
0:05:45.025,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is truly a remarkable figure.

111
0:05:47.082,000 --> 0:05:49,000
When we went and talked to the people in those innovation

112
0:05:50.005,000 --> 0:05:52,000
centers and asked them what are they working on,

113
0:05:52.066,000 --> 0:05:54,000
they said, "We are working on global products."

114
0:05:54.076,000 --> 0:05:56,000
They were not working on localizing global products

115
0:05:57.039,000 --> 0:06:,000
for India, which is the usual role of a local R&amp;D.

116
0:06:01.011,000 --> 0:06:03,000
They were working on truly global products,

117
0:06:03.061,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and companies like Microsoft, Google, AstraZeneca,

118
0:06:07.037,000 --> 0:06:09,000
General Electric, Philips, have already answered

119
0:06:10.024,000 --> 0:06:13,000
in the affirmative the question that from their Bangalore

120
0:06:13.072,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and Hyderabad R&amp;D centers they are able to produce

121
0:06:17.067,000 --> 0:06:2,000
products and services for the world.

122
0:06:20.069,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But of course, as an end user, you don't see that,

123
0:06:23.036,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because you only see the name of the company,

124
0:06:24.087,000 --> 0:06:27,000
not where it was developed.

125
0:06:28.064,000 --> 0:06:3,000
The other thing we were told then was, "Yes, but, you know,

126
0:06:31.048,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the kind of work that is coming out of the Indian R&amp;D center

127
0:06:33.072,000 --> 0:06:35,000
cannot be compared to the kind of work that is coming out

128
0:06:35.075,000 --> 0:06:37,000
of the U.S. R&amp;D centers."

129
0:06:38.01,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So my coauthor Phanish Puranam, who happens to be

130
0:06:39.071,000 --> 0:06:41,000
one of the smartest people I know, said

131
0:06:42.008,000 --> 0:06:43,000
he's going to do a study.

132
0:06:43.053,000 --> 0:06:45,000
What he did was he looked at those companies

133
0:06:46.019,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that had an R&amp;D center in USA and in India,

134
0:06:49.09,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and then he looked at a patent that was filed

135
0:06:52.047,000 --> 0:06:54,000
out of the U.S. and a similar patent filed out of the same

136
0:06:55.018,000 --> 0:06:57,000
company's subsidiary in India,

137
0:06:57.068,000 --> 0:07:,000
so he's now comparing the patents of R&amp;D centers

138
0:07:00.076,000 --> 0:07:04,000
in the U.S. with R&amp;D centers in India of the same company

139
0:07:04.077,000 --> 0:07:06,000
to find out what is the quality of the patents filed

140
0:07:07.007,000 --> 0:07:08,000
out of the Indian centers and how do they compare

141
0:07:08.094,000 --> 0:07:1,000
with the quality of the patents filed out of the U.S. centers?

142
0:07:11.073,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Interestingly, what he finds is

143
0:07:13.094,000 --> 0:07:15,000
— and by the way, the way we look at the quality of a patent

144
0:07:16.065,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is what we call forward citations: How many times

145
0:07:19.055,000 --> 0:07:23,000
does a future patent reference the older patent? —

146
0:07:23.072,000 --> 0:07:25,000
he finds something very interesting.

147
0:07:26.023,000 --> 0:07:28,000
What we find is that the data says

148
0:07:28.091,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that the number of forward citations of a patent filed

149
0:07:32.01,000 --> 0:07:35,000
out of a U.S. R&amp;D subsidiary is identical to the number

150
0:07:35.051,000 --> 0:07:38,000
of forward citations of a patent filed by an Indian subsidiary

151
0:07:39.023,000 --> 0:07:41,000
of the same company within that company.

152
0:07:41.044,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So within the company, there's no difference in the forward

153
0:07:44.035,000 --> 0:07:46,000
citation rates of their Indian subsidiaries versus

154
0:07:46.086,000 --> 0:07:47,000
their U.S. subsidiaries.

155
0:07:47.096,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So that's the first kind of invisible innovation coming out of India.

156
0:07:51.078,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The second kind of invisible innovation coming out of India

157
0:07:54.033,000 --> 0:07:57,000
is what we call outsourcing innovation to Indian companies,

158
0:07:58.003,000 --> 0:08:01,000
where many companies today are contracting

159
0:08:01.005,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Indian companies to do a major part of their product

160
0:08:04.097,000 --> 0:08:08,000
development work for their global products

161
0:08:09.038,000 --> 0:08:11,000
which are going to be sold to the entire world.

162
0:08:11.069,000 --> 0:08:13,000
For example, in the pharma industry, a lot of the molecules

163
0:08:13.091,000 --> 0:08:15,000
are being developed, but you see a major part of that work

164
0:08:16.051,000 --> 0:08:18,000
is being sent to India.

165
0:08:19.006,000 --> 0:08:22,000
For example, XCL Technologies,

166
0:08:22.007,000 --> 0:08:24,000
they developed two of the mission critical systems

167
0:08:24.099,000 --> 0:08:27,000
for the new Boeing 787 Dreamliner,

168
0:08:28.019,000 --> 0:08:3,000
one to avoid collisions in the sky,

169
0:08:30.091,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and another to allow landing in zero visibility.

170
0:08:34.015,000 --> 0:08:36,000
But of course, when you climb onto the Boeing 787,

171
0:08:36.078,000 --> 0:08:38,000
you are not going to know that this is invisible innovation

172
0:08:39.016,000 --> 0:08:4,000
out of India.

173
0:08:40.043,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The third kind of invisible innovation coming out of India

174
0:08:43.044,000 --> 0:08:45,000
is what we call process innovations, because of an injection

175
0:08:46.043,000 --> 0:08:48,000
of intelligence by Indian firms.

176
0:08:49.016,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Process innovation is different from product innovation.

177
0:08:53.042,000 --> 0:08:56,000
It's about how do you create a new product or develop

178
0:08:56.063,000 --> 0:08:58,000
a new product or manufacture a new product,

179
0:08:58.063,000 --> 0:09:,000
but not a new product itself?

180
0:09:00.067,000 --> 0:09:05,000
Only in India do millions of young people dream

181
0:09:05.077,000 --> 0:09:09,000
of working in a call center.

182
0:09:09.096,000 --> 0:09:12,000
What happens — You know, it's a dead end job in the West,

183
0:09:12.098,000 --> 0:09:14,000
what high school dropouts do.

184
0:09:15.031,000 --> 0:09:18,000
What happens when you put hundreds of thousands

185
0:09:18.043,000 --> 0:09:21,000
of smart, young, ambitious kids

186
0:09:21.059,000 --> 0:09:23,000
on a call center job?

187
0:09:23.089,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Very quickly, they get bored, and they start innovating,

188
0:09:28.079,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and they start telling the boss how to do this job better, and

189
0:09:32.009,000 --> 0:09:35,000
out of this process innovation comes product innovations,

190
0:09:35.03,000 --> 0:09:36,000
which are then marketed around the world.

191
0:09:37.003,000 --> 0:09:39,000
For example, 24/7 Customer,

192
0:09:39.042,000 --> 0:09:41,000
traditional call center company, used to be a traditional

193
0:09:41.071,000 --> 0:09:42,000
call center company. Today they're developing

194
0:09:43.055,000 --> 0:09:46,000
analytical tools to do predictive modeling so that before

195
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:5,000
you pick up the phone, you can guess

196
0:09:50.005,000 --> 0:09:56,000
or predict what this phone call is about.

197
0:09:56.078,000 --> 0:09:58,000
It's because of an injection of intelligence into a process

198
0:09:59.028,000 --> 0:10:01,000
which was considered dead for a long time in the West.

199
0:10:02.01,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And the last kind of innovation, invisible innovation

200
0:10:05.041,000 --> 0:10:07,000
coming out of India is what we call management innovation.

201
0:10:08.002,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It's not a new product or a new process

202
0:10:09.075,000 --> 0:10:11,000
but a new way to organize work,

203
0:10:12.01,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and the most significant management innovation to come

204
0:10:14.059,000 --> 0:10:17,000
out of India, invented by the Indian offshoring industry

205
0:10:18.015,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is what we call the global delivery model.

206
0:10:20.08,000 --> 0:10:22,000
What the global delivery model allows is, it allows you

207
0:10:23.009,000 --> 0:10:26,000
to take previously geographically core-located tasks,

208
0:10:26.059,000 --> 0:10:29,000
break them up into parts, send them around the world

209
0:10:29.06,000 --> 0:10:31,000
where the expertise and the cost structure exists,

210
0:10:31.061,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and then specify the means for reintegrating them.

211
0:10:34.044,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Without that, you could not have any of the other

212
0:10:36.057,000 --> 0:10:38,000
invisible innovations today.

213
0:10:38.085,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So, what I'm trying to say is, what we are finding

214
0:10:41.049,000 --> 0:10:45,000
in our research is, that if products for end users

215
0:10:46.012,000 --> 0:10:49,000
is the visible tip of the innovation iceberg,

216
0:10:49.041,000 --> 0:10:52,000
India is well represented in the invisible, large,

217
0:10:53.033,000 --> 0:10:58,000
submerged portion of the innovation iceberg.

218
0:10:58.057,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Now, this has, of course, some implications,

219
0:11:03.053,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and so we developed three implications of this research.

220
0:11:07.077,000 --> 0:11:1,000
The first is what we called sinking skill ladder,

221
0:11:11.001,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and now I'm going to go back to where I started my

222
0:11:13.073,000 --> 0:11:16,000
conversation with you, which was about the flight of jobs.

223
0:11:16.095,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Now, of course, when we first, as a multinational company,

224
0:11:20.008,000 --> 0:11:22,000
decide to outsource jobs to India in the R&amp;D,

225
0:11:22.09,000 --> 0:11:25,000
what we are going to do is we are going to outsource the

226
0:11:26.034,000 --> 0:11:29,000
bottom rung of the ladder to India, the least sophisticated jobs,

227
0:11:29.042,000 --> 0:11:32,000
just like Tom Friedman would predict.

228
0:11:32.063,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Now, what happens is, when you outsource the bottom rung

229
0:11:35.035,000 --> 0:11:39,000
of the ladder to India for innovation and for R&amp;D work,

230
0:11:40.017,000 --> 0:11:43,000
at some stage in the very near future you are going to have

231
0:11:43.04,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to confront a problem,

232
0:11:45.054,000 --> 0:11:46,000
which is where does the next step

233
0:11:47.043,000 --> 0:11:5,000
of the ladder people come from within your company?

234
0:11:50.069,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So you have two choices then:

235
0:11:53.059,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Either you bring the people from India into

236
0:11:55.077,000 --> 0:11:57,000
the developed world to take positions in the next step

237
0:11:58.068,000 --> 0:12:,000
of the ladder — immigration —

238
0:12:01.042,000 --> 0:12:03,000
or you say, there's so many people in the bottom step

239
0:12:03.086,000 --> 0:12:05,000
of the ladder waiting to take the next position in India,

240
0:12:06.05,000 --> 0:12:1,000
why don't we move the next step to India?

241
0:12:10.073,000 --> 0:12:11,000
What we are trying to say is

242
0:12:12.068,000 --> 0:12:17,000
that once you outsource the bottom end of the ladder, you --

243
0:12:17.091,000 --> 0:12:19,000
it's a self-perpetuating act, because of the sinking skill ladder,

244
0:12:20.061,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and the sinking skill ladder is simply the point that

245
0:12:23.034,000 --> 0:12:25,000
you can't be an investment banker

246
0:12:25.049,000 --> 0:12:26,000
without having been an analyst once.

247
0:12:27.048,000 --> 0:12:29,000
You can't be a professor without having been a student.

248
0:12:29.075,000 --> 0:12:31,000
You can't be a consultant without having been a research associate.

249
0:12:32.061,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So, if you outsource the least sophisticated jobs,

250
0:12:35.02,000 --> 0:12:39,000
at some stage, the next step of the ladder has to follow.

251
0:12:39.047,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The second thing we bring up is what we call

252
0:12:41.032,000 --> 0:12:44,000
the browning of the TMT, the top management teams.

253
0:12:44.068,000 --> 0:12:46,000
If the R&amp;D talent is going to be based out of India

254
0:12:47.032,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and China, and the largest growth markets

255
0:12:49.056,000 --> 0:12:51,000
are going to be based out of India and China,

256
0:12:51.08,000 --> 0:12:52,000
you have to confront the problem that

257
0:12:53.053,000 --> 0:12:54,000
your top management of the future

258
0:12:55.015,000 --> 0:12:58,000
is going to have to come out of India and China,

259
0:12:58.016,000 --> 0:12:59,000
because that's where the product leadership is,

260
0:12:59.099,000 --> 0:13:01,000
that's where the important market leadership is.

261
0:13:02.015,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Right? And the last thing we point out in this slide,

262
0:13:04.093,000 --> 0:13:07,000
which is, you know, that to this story, there's one caveat.

263
0:13:08.036,000 --> 0:13:12,000
India has the youngest growing population in the world.

264
0:13:12.042,000 --> 0:13:16,000
This demographic dividend is incredible, but paradoxically,

265
0:13:16.072,000 --> 0:13:18,000
there's also the mirage of mighty labor pools.

266
0:13:19.011,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Indian institutes and educational system,

267
0:13:22.004,000 --> 0:13:24,000
with a few exceptions, are incapable of producing students

268
0:13:24.097,000 --> 0:13:26,000
in the quantity and quality needed

269
0:13:27.047,000 --> 0:13:29,000
to keep this innovation engine going,

270
0:13:30.001,000 --> 0:13:33,000
so companies are finding innovative ways to overcome this,

271
0:13:33.022,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but in the end it does not absolve the government

272
0:13:35.082,000 --> 0:13:39,000
of the responsibility for creating this educational structure.

273
0:13:40.029,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So finally, I want to conclude

274
0:13:43.062,000 --> 0:13:46,000
by showing you the profile of one company, IBM.

275
0:13:46.094,000 --> 0:13:48,000
As many of you know, IBM has always been considered

276
0:13:49.031,000 --> 0:13:5,000
for the last hundred years to be one of the most

277
0:13:51.029,000 --> 0:13:52,000
innovative companies.

278
0:13:52.056,000 --> 0:13:54,000
In fact, if you look at the number of patents filed over history,

279
0:13:55.031,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I think they are in the top or the top two or three companies

280
0:13:57.071,000 --> 0:14:,000
in the world of all patents filed in the USA as a private company.

281
0:14:01.041,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Here is the profile of employees of

282
0:14:03.091,000 --> 0:14:06,000
IBM over the last decade.

283
0:14:07.084,000 --> 0:14:09,000
In 2003, they had 300,000 employees,

284
0:14:10.059,000 --> 0:14:14,000
or 330,000 employees, out of which, 135,000

285
0:14:14.068,000 --> 0:14:17,000
were in America, 9,000 were in India.

286
0:14:18.027,000 --> 0:14:23,000
In 2009, they had 400,000 employees, by which time

287
0:14:23.03,000 --> 0:14:25,000
the U.S. employees had moved to 105,000,

288
0:14:25.087,000 --> 0:14:28,000
whereas the Indian employees had gone to 100,000.

289
0:14:29.014,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Well, in 2010, they decided they're not going to reveal

290
0:14:32.016,000 --> 0:14:34,000
this data anymore, so I had to make some estimates

291
0:14:34.048,000 --> 0:14:35,000
based on various sources.

292
0:14:35.088,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Here are my best guesses. Okay? I'm not saying

293
0:14:38.052,000 --> 0:14:39,000
this is the exact number, it's my best guess.

294
0:14:39.098,000 --> 0:14:4,000
It gives you a sense of the trend.

295
0:14:41.06,000 --> 0:14:45,000
There are 433,000 people now at IBM, out of which

296
0:14:46.023,000 --> 0:14:48,000
98,000 are remaining in the U.S.,

297
0:14:48.083,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and 150,000 are in India.

298
0:14:52.039,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So you tell me, is IBM an American company,

299
0:14:55.051,000 --> 0:14:59,000
or an Indian company? (Laughter)

300
0:14:59.057,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much. (Applause)

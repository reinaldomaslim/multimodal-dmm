1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'd like to ask you,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
what do these three people have in common?

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Well, you probably recognize the first person.

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm sure you're all avid "American Idol" watchers.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But you might not recognize Aydah Al Jahani,

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
who is a contestant, indeed a finalist,

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in the Poet of the Millions competition,

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which is broadcast out of Abu Dhabi,

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and seen throughout the Arab world.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
In this contest

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
people have to write and recite

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
original poetry, in the Nabati form of poetry,

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
which is the traditional Bedouin form.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And Lima Sahar was a finalist

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in the Afghan Star singing competition.

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now, before I go any further,

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
yes, I know it all began with "Britain's Got Talent."

18
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But my point in discussing this

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
is to show you -- I hope I'll be able to show you

20
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
how these merit-based competitions,

21
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
with equal access to everyone,

22
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
with the winner selected via voting by SMS,

23
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
are changing tribal societies.

24
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And I'm going to focus on Afghanistan

25
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and the Arab world with the UAE,

26
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
how they're changing tribal societies,

27
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
not by introducing Western ideas,

28
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but by being integrated into the language in those places.

29
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
It all begins with enjoyment.

30
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Video: We are late to watch "Afghan Star."

31
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
We are going to watch "Afghan Star." We are late.

32
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We are running late.

33
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We must go to watch "Afghan Star."

34
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Cynthia Schneider: These programs are reaching incredibly deeply into society.

35
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
In Afghanistan, people go to extraordinary lengths

36
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
to be able to watch this program.

37
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And you don't necessarily have to have your own TV set.

38
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
People watch it all over the country

39
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
also in public places.

40
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But it goes beyond watching,

41
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
because also, part of this

42
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is campaigning.

43
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
People become so engaged

44
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that they have volunteers, just like political volunteers anyway,

45
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
who fan out over the countryside,

46
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
campaigning for their candidate.

47
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Contestants also put themselves forward.

48
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Now, of course there is a certain degree of ethnic allegiance, but not entirely.

49
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Because each year the winner has come from a different tribal group.

50
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
This has opened up the door,

51
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
particularly for women.

52
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And in the last season there were two women in the finalists.

53
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
One of them, Lima Sahar, is a Pashtun from Kandahar,

54
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
a very conservative part of the country.

55
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And here she relates, in the documentary film "Afghan Star,"

56
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
how her friends urged her not to do this

57
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and told her that she was leaving them for democracy.

58
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But she also confides that

59
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
she knows that members of the Taliban

60
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
are actually SMS-ing votes in for her.

61
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Aydah Al Jahnani also took risks

62
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and put herself out, to compete

63
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in the Poet of the Millions competition.

64
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I have to say, her husband backed her from the start.

65
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But her tribe and family urged her not to compete

66
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and were very much against it.

67
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But, once she started to win,

68
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
then they got behind her again.

69
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It turns out that competition and winning is a universal human value.

70
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And she's out there.

71
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Her poetry is about women,

72
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and the life of women in society.

73
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So just by presenting herself

74
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and being in competition with men --

75
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
this shows the voting on the program --

76
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
it sets a very important example for young women --

77
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
these are young women in the audience of the program --

78
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
in Abu Dhabi, but also people in the viewing audience.

79
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Now you'd think that "American Idol"

80
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
would introduce a measure of Americanization.

81
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But actually, just the opposite is happening.

82
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
By using this engaging popular format

83
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
for traditional, local culture,

84
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
it actually, in the Gulf, is precipitating a revival

85
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
of interest in Nabati poetry,

86
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
also in traditional dress and dance and music.

87
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And for Afghanistan,

88
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
where the Taliban banned music for many years,

89
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
it is reintroducing their traditional music.

90
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
They don't sing pop songs,

91
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
they sing Afghan music.

92
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And they also have learned how to lose gracefully,

93
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
without avenging the winner.

94
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
No small thing.

96
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And the final, sort of, formulation

97
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
of this "American Idol" format,

98
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
which has just appeared in Afghanistan,

99
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is a new program called "The Candidate."

100
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And in this program, people present

101
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
policy platforms that are then voted on.

102
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Many of them are too young to run for president,

103
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
but by putting the issues out there,

104
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
they are influencing the presidential race.

105
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So for me, the substance of things unseen

106
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is how reality TV is driving reality.

107
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Thank you.

108
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
My name is Ryan Lobo,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I've been involved in the documentary

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
filmmaking business all over the world for the last 10 years.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
During the process of making these films

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I found myself taking photographs,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
often much to the annoyance of the video cameramen.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I found this photography of mine almost compulsive.

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And at the end of a shoot, I would sometimes feel that

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I had photographs that told a better story

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
than a sometimes-sensational documentary.

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I felt, when I had my photographs,

12
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
that I was holding on to something true,

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
regardless of agendas or politics.

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
In 2007, I traveled to three war zones.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I traveled to Iraq, Afghanistan and Liberia.

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
And over there I experienced

17
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
other people's suffering, up close and personal,

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
immersed myself in some rather intense and emotional stories,

19
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and at times I experienced great fear for my own life.

20
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
As always, I would return to Bangalore,

21
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and often to animated discussions at friend's homes,

22
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
where we would discuss various issues

23
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
while they complained bitterly about the new pub timings,

24
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
where a drink often cost more than what they'd paid

25
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
their 14-year-old maid.

26
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I would feel very isolated during these discussions.

27
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But at the same time, I questioned myself

28
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and my own integrity and purpose in storytelling.

29
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And I decided that I had compromised,

30
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
just like my friends in those discussions,

31
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
where we told stories

32
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in contexts we made excuses for,

33
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
rather than taking responsibility for.

34
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I won't go into details about what led to a decision I made,

35
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but let's just say it involved alcohol, cigarettes,

36
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
other substances and a woman.

37
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I basically decided that it was I,

39
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
not the camera or the network,

40
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
or anything that lay outside myself,

41
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that was the only instrument in storytelling

42
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
truly worth tuning.

43
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
In my life, when I tried to achieve things

44
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
like success or recognition, they eluded me.

45
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Paradoxically, when I let go of these objectives,

46
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and worked from a place of compassion and purpose,

47
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
looking for excellence, rather than the results of it,

48
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
everything arrived on its own, including fulfillment.

49
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Photography transcended culture, including my own.

50
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And it is, for me, a language which expressed the intangible,

51
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and gives voice to people and stories without.

52
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I invite you into three recent stories of mine,

53
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
which are about this way of looking, if you will,

54
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
which I believe exemplify the tenets

55
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
of what I like to call compassion in storytelling.

56
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
In 2007 I went to Liberia,

57
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
where a group of my friends and I

58
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
did an independent, self-funded film, still in progress,

59
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
on a very legendary and brutal war-lord

60
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
named General Butt Naked.

61
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
His real name is Joshua, and he's pictured here in a cell

62
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
where he once used to torture and murder people,

63
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
including children.

64
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Joshua claims to have personally killed

65
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
more than 10,000 people during Liberia's civil war.

66
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
He got his name from fighting stark naked.

67
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And he is probably the most prolific mass murderer

68
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
alive on Earth today.

69
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
This woman witnessed the General murdering her brother.

70
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Joshua commanded his child-soldiers to commit unspeakable crimes,

71
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and enforced his command with great brutality.

72
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Today many of these children are addicted to drugs like heroin,

73
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and they are destitute, like these young men in the image.

74
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
How do you live with yourself

75
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
if you know you've committed horrific crimes?

76
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Today the General is a baptized Christian evangelist.

77
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And he's on a mission.

78
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We accompanied Joshua, as he walked the Earth,

79
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
visiting villages where he had once killed and raped.

80
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
He seeked forgiveness,

81
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and he claims to endeavor to improve

82
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the lives of his child-soldiers.

83
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
During this expedition I expected him

84
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to be killed outright, and us as well.

85
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But what I saw opened my eyes

86
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to an idea of forgiveness

87
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
which I never thought possible.

88
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
In the midst of incredible poverty and loss,

89
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
people who had nothing absolved a man

90
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
who had taken everything from them.

91
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
He begs for forgiveness,

92
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and receives it from the same woman

93
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
whose brother he murdered.

94
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Senegalese, the young man seated on the wheelchair here,

95
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
was once a child soldier, under the General's command,

96
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
until he disobeyed orders,

97
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and the General shot off both his legs.

98
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
He forgives the General in this image.

99
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
He risked his life as he walked up to people

100
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
whose families he'd murdered.

101
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
In this photograph a hostile crowd in a slum surrounds him.

102
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And Joshua remains silent

103
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
as they vented their rage against him.

104
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
This image, to me, is almost like from a Shakespearean play,

105
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
with a man, surrounded by various influences,

106
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
desperate to hold on to something true within himself,

107
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
in a context of great suffering that he has created himself.

108
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I was intensely moved during all this.

109
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But the question is,

110
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
does forgiveness and redemption replace justice?

111
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Joshua, in his own words, says that he does not mind

112
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
standing trial for his crimes,

113
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and speaks about them from soapboxes across Monrovia,

114
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
to an audience that often includes his victims.

115
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
A very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of

116
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
separation of church and state.

117
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
The second story I'm going to tell you about

118
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is about a group of very special fighting women

119
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
with rather unique peace-keeping skills.

120
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Liberia has been devastated by one of Africa's

121
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
bloodiest civil wars,

122
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
which has left more than 200,000 people dead,

123
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
thousands of women scarred by rape and crime

124
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
on a spectacular scale.

125
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Liberia is now home

126
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to an all-woman United Nations contingent

127
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
of Indian peacekeepers.

128
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
These women, many from small towns in India,

129
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
help keep the peace, far away from home and family.

130
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
They use negotiation and tolerance

131
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
more often than an armed response.

132
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The commander told me that a woman could gauge

133
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
a potentially violent situation

134
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
much better than men.

135
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And that they were definitely capable of diffusing it non-aggressively.

136
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
This man was very drunk,

137
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and he was very interested in my camera,

138
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
until he noticed the women, who handled him

139
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
with smiles, and AK-47s at the ready, of course.

140
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This contingent seems to be quite lucky,

142
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and it has not sustained any casualties,

143
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
even though dozens of peacekeepers have been killed in Liberia.

144
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And yes, all of those people killed were male.

145
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Many of the women are married with children,

146
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and they say the hardest part of their deployment

147
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
was being kept away from their children.

148
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I accompanied these women on their patrols,

149
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and watched as they walked past men,

150
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
many who passed very lewd comments incessantly.

151
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And when I asked one of the women about the shock and awe response,

152
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
she said, "Don't worry, same thing back home.

153
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We know how to deal with these fellows,"

154
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and ignored them.

155
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
In a country ravaged by violence against women,

156
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Indian peacekeepers have inspired many local women

157
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to join the police force.

158
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Sometimes, when the war is over and all the film crews have left,

159
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the most inspiring stories are the ones

160
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that float just beneath the radar.

161
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I came back to India and nobody was interested in buying the story.

162
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And one editor told me that she wasn't interested

163
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
in doing what she called "manual labor stories."

164
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
In 2007 and 2009 I did stories on the Delhi Fire Service, the DFS,

165
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
which, during the summer, is probably the world's most active fire department.

166
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
They answer more than 5,000 calls in just two months.

167
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And all this against incredible logistical odds,

168
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
like heat and traffic jams.

169
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Something amazing happened during this shoot.

170
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Due to a traffic jam, we were late in getting to a slum,

171
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
a large slum, which had caught fire.

172
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
As we neared, angry crowds attacked our trucks

173
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and stoned them, by hundreds of people all over the place.

174
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
These men were terrified,

175
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
as the mob attacked our vehicle.

176
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
But nonetheless, despite the hostility,

177
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
firefighters left the vehicle and successfully fought the fire.

178
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Running the gauntlet through hostile crowds,

179
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and some wearing motorbike helmets to prevent injury.

180
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Some of the local people forcibly took away the hoses

181
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
from the firemen to put out the fire in their homes.

182
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now, hundreds of homes were destroyed.

183
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But the question that lingered in my mind was,

184
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
what causes people to destroy fire trucks

185
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
headed to their own homes?

186
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Where does such rage come from?

187
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And how are we responsible for this?

188
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
45 percent of the 14 million people

189
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
who live in Delhi live in unauthorized slums,

190
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
which are chronically overcrowded.

191
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
They lack even the most basic amenities.

192
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And this is something that is common to all our big cities.

193
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Back to the DFS. A huge chemical depot caught fire,

194
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
thousands of drums filled with petrochemicals

195
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
were blazing away and exploding all around us.

196
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
The heat was so intense, that hoses were used

197
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to cool down firefighters

198
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
fighting extremely close to the fire, and with no protective clothing.

199
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
In India we often love to complain about our government bodies.

200
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But over here, the heads of the DFS,

201
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Mr. R.C. Sharman, Mr. A.K. Sharman,

202
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
led the firefight with their men.

203
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Something wonderful in a country where

204
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
manual labor is often looked down upon.

205
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Applause)

206
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Over the years, my faith in the power of storytelling has been tested.

207
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And I've had very serious doubt about its efficacy,

208
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and my own faith in humanity.

209
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
However, a film we shot still airs on the National Geographic channel.

210
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And when it airs I get calls from all the guys I was with

211
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and they tell me that they receive hundreds of calls congratulating them.

212
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Some of the firemen told me that they were also inspired

213
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
to do better because they were so pleased

214
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
to get thank-yous rather than brick bats.

215
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
It seems that this story helped change perceptions about the DFS,

216
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
at least in the minds of an audience in part on televisions,

217
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
read magazines and whose huts aren't on fire.

218
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Sometimes, focusing on what's heroic, beautiful and dignified,

219
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
regardless of the context,

220
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
can help magnify these intangibles three ways,

221
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
in the protagonist of the story, in the audience,

222
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and also in the storyteller.

223
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And that's the power of storytelling.

224
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Focus on what's dignified, courageous and beautiful,

225
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and it grows. Thank you.

226
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
(Applause)

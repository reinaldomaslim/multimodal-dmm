1
0:00:15.76,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Now, I want to start with a question:

2
0:00:17.553,000 --> 0:00:2,000
When was the last time you were called "childish"?

3
0:00:20.99,000 --> 0:00:21,000
For kids like me,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
being called childish can be a frequent occurrence.

5
0:00:25.64,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Every time we make irrational demands,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
exhibit irresponsible behavior,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
or display any other signs of being normal American citizens,

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
we are called childish.

9
0:00:37.017,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Which really bothers me.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
After all, take a look at these events:

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Imperialism and colonization,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
world wars, George W. Bush.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Ask yourself, who's responsible? Adults.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now, what have kids done?

15
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Well, Anne Frank touched millions

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
with her powerful account of the Holocaust.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States.

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And, most recently,

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Charlie Simpson helped to raise 120,000 pounds for Haiti,

20
0:01:06.977,000 --> 0:01:07,000
on his little bike.

21
0:01:08.826,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So as you can see evidenced by such examples,

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
age has absolutely nothing to do with it.

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The traits the word "childish" addresses are seen so often in adults,

24
0:01:18.118,000 --> 0:01:2,000
that we should abolish this age-discriminatory word,

25
0:01:20.886,000 --> 0:01:23,000
when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility

26
0:01:24.656,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and irrational thinking.

27
0:01:26.06,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Applause)

28
0:01:31.987,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Thank you.

29
0:01:33.391,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Then again, who's to say that certain types of irrational thinking

30
0:01:37.854,000 --> 0:01:39,000
aren't exactly what the world needs?

31
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Maybe you've had grand plans before,

32
0:01:42.592,000 --> 0:01:43,000
but stopped yourself, thinking,

33
0:01:44.577,000 --> 0:01:46,000
"That's impossible," or "That costs too much,"

34
0:01:46.901,000 --> 0:01:47,000
or "That won't benefit me."

35
0:01:48.782,000 --> 0:01:5,000
For better or worse, we kids aren't hampered as much

36
0:01:51.339,000 --> 0:01:54,000
when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things.

37
0:01:54.91,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking,

38
0:01:58.782,000 --> 0:01:59,000
like my wish that no one went hungry,

39
0:02:00.766,000 --> 0:02:02,000
or that everything were free, a kind of utopia.

40
0:02:03.989,000 --> 0:02:06,000
How many of you still dream like that, and believe in the possibilities?

41
0:02:08.704,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of Utopian ideals

42
0:02:13.116,000 --> 0:02:14,000
can be a burden,

43
0:02:14.299,000 --> 0:02:16,000
because you know that if everything were free,

44
0:02:16.475,000 --> 0:02:19,000
then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos.

45
0:02:20.768,000 --> 0:02:23,000
On the other hand, we kids still dream about perfection.

46
0:02:24.649,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And that's a good thing, because in order to make anything a reality,

47
0:02:28.139,000 --> 0:02:3,000
you have to dream about it first.

48
0:02:31.185,000 --> 0:02:33,000
In many ways, our audacity to imagine

49
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
helps push the boundaries of possibility.

50
0:02:36.529,000 --> 0:02:39,000
For instance, the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington,

51
0:02:39.704,000 --> 0:02:4,000
my home state -- yoohoo, Washington!

52
0:02:41.625,000 --> 0:02:43,000
(Applause)

53
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
has a program called Kids Design Glass,

54
0:02:46.482,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and kids draw their own ideas for glass art.

55
0:02:48.633,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The resident artist said they got some of their best ideas

56
0:02:51.475,000 --> 0:02:54,000
from the program, because kids don't think about the limitations

57
0:02:54.522,000 --> 0:02:56,000
of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes,

58
0:02:57.181,000 --> 0:02:58,000
they just think of good ideas.

59
0:02:58.798,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Now, when you think of glass, you might think of colorful Chihuly designs,

60
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
or maybe Italian vases,

61
0:03:05.441,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that,

62
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
into the realm of brokenhearted snakes

63
0:03:10.979,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and bacon boys, who you can see has meat vision.

64
0:03:14.233,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:15.852,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Now, our inherent wisdom doesn't have to be insider's knowledge.

66
0:03:20.891,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Kids already do a lot of learning from adults,

67
0:03:24.105,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and we have a lot to share.

68
0:03:25.907,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I think that adults should start learning from kids.

69
0:03:29.213,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Now, I do most of my speaking

70
0:03:30.641,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in front of an education crowd -- teachers and students,

71
0:03:33.307,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and I like this analogy:

72
0:03:34.491,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It shouldn't be a teacher at the head of the class,

73
0:03:37.006,000 --> 0:03:38,000
telling students, "Do this, do that."

74
0:03:38.823,000 --> 0:03:4,000
The students should teach their teachers.

75
0:03:42.051,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Learning between grown-ups and kids should be reciprocal.

76
0:03:45.735,000 --> 0:03:47,000
The reality, unfortunately, is a little different,

77
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and it has a lot to do with trust, or a lack of it.

78
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Now, if you don't trust someone, you place restrictions on them, right?

79
0:03:54.656,000 --> 0:03:57,000
If I doubt my older sister's ability to pay back the 10 percent interest

80
0:03:58.602,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I established on her last loan,

81
0:04:00.259,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I'm going to withhold her ability to get more money from me,

82
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
until she pays it back.

83
0:04:04.658,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:05.849,000 --> 0:04:06,000
True story, by the way.

85
0:04:07.772,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Now, adults seem to have

86
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids,

87
0:04:13.96,000 --> 0:04:16,000
from every "Don't do that, don't do this" in the school handbook,

88
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
to restrictions on school Internet use.

89
0:04:20.028,000 --> 0:04:23,000
As history points out, regimes become oppressive

90
0:04:23.085,000 --> 0:04:25,000
when they're fearful about keeping control.

91
0:04:25.332,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And although adults may not be quite at the level

92
0:04:27.69,000 --> 0:04:28,000
of totalitarian regimes,

93
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
kids have no or very little say in making the rules,

94
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
when really, the attitude should be reciprocal,

95
0:04:34.499,000 --> 0:04:36,000
meaning that the adult population should learn

96
0:04:37.22,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and take into account the wishes of the younger population.

97
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now, what's even worse than restriction,

98
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
is that adults often underestimate kids' abilities.

99
0:04:45.856,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We love challenges, but when expectations are low,

100
0:04:49.038,000 --> 0:04:5,000
trust me, we will sink to them.

101
0:04:51.49,000 --> 0:04:54,000
My own parents had anything but low expectations

102
0:04:54.808,000 --> 0:04:55,000
for me and my sister.

103
0:04:56.744,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Okay, so they didn't tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that,

104
0:05:01.887,000 --> 0:05:06,000
but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ-fighters,

105
0:05:07.509,000 --> 0:05:08,000
when lots of other kids were hearing

106
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round."

107
0:05:11.332,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Well, we heard that one too, but "Pioneer Germ Fighters" totally rules.

108
0:05:15.224,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:16.261,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I loved to write from the age of four, and when I was six,

110
0:05:19.259,000 --> 0:05:22,000
my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word.

111
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Thank you, Bill Gates, and thank you, Ma.

112
0:05:25.694,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop,

113
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and I wanted to get published.

114
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published,

115
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
or saying wait until you're older,

116
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
my parents were really supportive.

117
0:05:40.823,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Many publishers were not quite so encouraging.

118
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
One large children's publisher ironically said

119
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that they didn't work with children.

120
0:05:49.521,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Children's publisher not working with children?

121
0:05:52.774,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I don't know, you're kind of alienating a large client there.

122
0:05:55.957,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

123
0:05:57.663,000 --> 0:06:02,000
One publisher, Action Publishing, was willing to take that leap and trust me,

124
0:06:03.515,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and to listen to what I had to say.

125
0:06:05.229,000 --> 0:06:08,000
They published my first book, "Flying Fingers," you see it here.

126
0:06:08.802,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And from there on, it's gone to speaking at hundreds of schools,

127
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
keynoting to thousands of educators,

128
0:06:14.307,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and finally, today, speaking to you.

129
0:06:16.854,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I appreciate your attention today,

130
0:06:18.814,000 --> 0:06:2,000
because to show that you truly care, you listen.

131
0:06:22.879,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But there's a problem with this rosy picture

132
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
of kids being so much better than adults.

133
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Kids grow up and become adults just like you.

134
0:06:31.593,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Or just like you? Really?

136
0:06:35.648,000 --> 0:06:38,000
The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult,

137
0:06:39.14,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but rather, better adults than you have been,

138
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
which may be a little challenging, considering your guys' credentials.

139
0:06:44.6,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Laughter)

140
0:06:45.782,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But the way progress happens,

141
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
is because new generations and new eras

142
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
grow and develop and become better than the previous ones.

143
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It's the reason we're not in the Dark Ages anymore.

144
0:06:56.807,000 --> 0:06:58,000
No matter your position or place in life,

145
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
it is imperative to create opportunities for children,

146
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
so that we can grow up to blow you away.

147
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:08.17,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Adults and fellow TEDsters,

149
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
you need to listen and learn from kids,

150
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and trust us and expect more from us.

151
0:07:16.18,000 --> 0:07:18,000
You must lend an ear today,

152
0:07:18.513,000 --> 0:07:2,000
because we are the leaders of tomorrow, which means

153
0:07:21.235,000 --> 0:07:23,000
we're going to take care of you when you're old and senile.

154
0:07:24.061,000 --> 0:07:25,000
No, just kidding.

155
0:07:25.378,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:26.402,000 --> 0:07:28,000
No, really, we are going to be the next generation,

157
0:07:29.121,000 --> 0:07:31,000
the ones who will bring this world forward.

158
0:07:31.43,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And in case you don't think that this really has meaning for you,

159
0:07:34.605,000 --> 0:07:35,000
remember that cloning is possible,

160
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and that involves going through childhood again,

161
0:07:38.57,000 --> 0:07:41,000
in which case you'll want to be heard, just like my generation.

162
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Now, the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas.

163
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed.

164
0:07:51.556,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Are you ready to make the match?

165
0:07:53.77,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Because the world's problems shouldn't be the human family's heirloom.

166
0:07:58.405,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Thank you.

167
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
(Applause)

168
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Thank you. Thank you.

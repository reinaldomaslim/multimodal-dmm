1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm actually here

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to make a challenge to people.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I know there have been many challenges made to people.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
The one I'm going to make

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
is that it is time for us to reclaim

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
what peace really means.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Peace is not "Kumbaya, my Lord."

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Peace is not the dove and the rainbow --

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
as lovely as they are.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
When I see the symbols

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
of the rainbow and the dove,

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I think of personal serenity.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I think of meditation.

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I do not think

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
about what I consider to be peace,

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
which is sustainable peace

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
with justice and equality.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
It is a sustainable peace

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
in which the majority of people

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
on this planet

21
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
have access to enough resources

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to live dignified lives,

23
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
where these people have enough access

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to education

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and health care,

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
so that they can live in freedom from want

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and freedom from fear.

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
This is called human security.

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And I am not a complete pacifist

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
like some of my really, really heavy-duty,

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
non-violent friends,

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
like Mairead McGuire.

33
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I understand that humans

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
are so "messed up" --

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to use a nice word,

36
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because I promised my mom

37
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I'd stop using the F-bomb in public.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And I'm trying harder and harder.

39
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Mom, I'm really trying.

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We need a little bit of police;

41
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
we need a little bit of military,

42
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but for defense.

43
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We need to redefine

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
what makes us secure

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
in this world.

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It is not arming our country

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to the teeth.

48
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
It is not getting other countries

49
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to arm themselves to the teeth

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
with the weapons that we produce

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and we sell them.

52
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It is using that money more rationally

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to make the countries of the world secure,

54
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to make the people of the world secure.

55
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I was thinking about

56
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the recent ongoings

57
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
in Congress,

58
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
where the president is offering

59
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
8.4 billion dollars

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to try to get the START vote.

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I certainly support the START vote.

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But he's offering 84 billion dollars

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
for the modernizing

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
of nuclear weapons.

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Do you know the figure that the U.N. talks about

66
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
for fulfilling the Millennium Development Goals

67
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is 80 billion dollars?

68
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Just that little bit of money,

69
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
which to me, I wish it was in my bank account --

70
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
it's not, but ...

71
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
In global terms, it's a little bit of money.

72
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But it's going to modernize weapons

73
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we do not need

74
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and will not be gotten rid of in our lifetime,

75
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
unless we get up off our ...

76
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and take action to make it happen,

77
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
unless we begin to believe

78
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that all of the things that we've been hearing about

79
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
in these last two days

80
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
are elements of what come together

81
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to make human security.

82
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
It is saving the tigers.

83
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It is stopping the tar sands.

84
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It is having access

85
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to medical equipment

86
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that can actually tell who does have cancer.

87
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
It is all of those things.

88
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It is using our money for all of those things.

89
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
It is about action.

90
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I was in Hiroshima

91
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
a couple of weeks ago,

92
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and His Holiness --

93
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we're sitting there in front of thousands of people in the city,

94
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and there were about eight of us Nobel laureates.

95
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And he's a bad guy. He's like a bad kid in church.

96
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We're staring at everybody, waiting our turn to speak,

97
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and he leans over to me, and he says,

98
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
"Jody, I'm a Buddhist monk."

99
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I said, "Yes, Your Holiness.

100
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Your robe gives it away."

101
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
He said, "You know

103
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that I kind of like meditation, and I pray."

104
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
I said, "That's good. That's good.

105
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We need that in the world.

106
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
I don't follow that, but that's cool."

107
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And he says, "But I have become skeptical.

108
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I do not believe

109
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that meditation and prayer

110
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
will change this world.

111
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I think what we need

112
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
is action."

113
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
His Holiness, in his robes,

114
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
is my new action hero.

115
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I spoke with Aung Sun Suu Kyi

116
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
a couple of days ago.

117
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
As most of you know,

118
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
she's a hero for democracy in her country, Burma.

119
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
You probably also know

120
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that she has spent 15 of the last 20 years

121
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
imprisoned for her efforts

122
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to bring about democracy.

123
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
She was just released a couple of weeks ago,

124
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and we're very concerned to see how long she will be free,

125
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
because she is already out in the streets in Rangoon,

126
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
agitating for change.

127
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
She is already out in the streets, working with the party

128
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to try to rebuild it.

129
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But I talked to her for a range of issues.

130
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
But one thing that I want to say,

131
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because it's similar to what His Holiness said.

132
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
She said, "You know, we have a long road to go

133
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
to finally get democracy in my country.

134
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
But I don't believe in hope

135
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
without endeavor.

136
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I don't believe in the hope of change,

137
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
unless we take action

138
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
to make it so."

139
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Here's another woman hero of mine.

140
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
She's my friend, Dr. Shirin Ebadi,

141
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the first Muslim woman

142
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

143
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
She has been in exile

144
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
for the last year and a half.

145
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
You ask her where she lives -- where does she live in exile?

146
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
She says the airports of the world.

147
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
She is traveling because she was out of the country

148
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
at the time of the elections.

149
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And instead of going home,

150
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
she conferred with all the other women that she works with,

151
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
who said to her, "Stay out. We need you out.

152
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We need to be able to talk to you out there,

153
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
so that you can give the message

154
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of what's happening here."

155
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
A year and a half --

156
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
she's out speaking

157
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
on behalf of the other women in her country.

158
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Wangari Maathai --

159
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
2004 Peace laureate.

160
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
They call her the "Tree Lady,"

161
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but she's more than the Tree Lady.

162
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Working for peace

163
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
is very creative.

164
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It's hard work every day.

165
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
When she was planting those trees,

166
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I don't think most people understand

167
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that, at the same time,

168
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
she was using the action

169
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
of getting people together to plant those trees

170
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to talk about how to overcome

171
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the authoritarian government in her country.

172
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
People could not gather

173
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
without getting busted and taken to jail.

174
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
But if they were together planting trees for the environment,

175
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
it was okay --

176
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
creativity.

177
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But it's not just iconic women

178
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
like Shirin,

179
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
like Aung Sun Suu Kyi, like Wangari Maathai --

180
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
it is other women in the world

181
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
who are also struggling together

182
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to change this world.

183
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
The Women's League of Burma,

184
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
11 individual organizations of Burmese women

185
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
came together because there's strength in numbers.

186
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Working together is what changes our world.

187
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The Million Signatures Campaign

188
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
of women inside Burma

189
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
working together to change human rights,

190
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
to bring democracy to that country.

191
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
When one is arrested and taken to prison,

192
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
another one comes out and joins the movement,

193
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
recognizing that if they work together,

194
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
they will ultimately bring change

195
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
in their own country.

196
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Mairead McGuire in the middle,

197
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Betty Williams on the right-hand side --

198
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
bringing peace to Northern Ireland.

199
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
I'll tell you the quick story.

200
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
An IRA driver was shot,

201
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and his car plowed into people

202
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
on the side of the street.

203
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
There was a mother and three children.

204
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The children were killed on the spot.

205
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It was Mairead's sister.

206
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Instead of giving in

207
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to grief, depression, defeat

208
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in the face of that violence,

209
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Mairead hooked up with Betty --

210
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
a staunch Protestant and a staunch Catholic --

211
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and they took to the streets

212
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to say, "No more violence."

213
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And they were able to get

214
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
tens of thousands of, primarily, women, some men,

215
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
in the streets to bring about change.

216
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And they have been

217
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
part of what brought peace to Northern Ireland,

218
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and they're still working on it,

219
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
because there's still a lot more to do.

220
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
This is Rigoberta Menchu Tum.

221
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
She also received the Peace Prize.

222
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
She is now running for president.

223
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
She is educating the indigenous people of her country

224
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
about what it means to be a democracy,

225
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
about how you bring democracy to the country,

226
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
about educating, about how to vote --

227
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
but that democracy is not just about voting;

228
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
it's about being an active citizen.

229
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
That's what I got stuck doing --

230
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the landmine campaign.

231
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
One of the things that made this campaign work

232
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
is because we grew from two NGOs

233
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to thousands

234
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
in 90 countries around the world,

235
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
working together in common cause to ban landmines.

236
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Some of the people who worked in our campaign

237
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
could only work maybe an hour a month.

238
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
They could maybe volunteer that much.

239
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
There were others, like myself,

240
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
who were full-time.

241
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
But it was the actions, together, of all of us

242
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
that brought about that change.

243
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
In my view, what we need today

244
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
is people getting up

245
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and taking action

246
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
to reclaim the meaning of peace.

247
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
It's not a dirty word.

248
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It's hard work every single day.

249
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And if each of us

250
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
who cares about the different things we care about

251
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
got up off our butts

252
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and volunteered

253
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
as much time as we could,

254
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
we would change this world,

255
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
we would save this world.

256
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And we can't wait for the other guy. We have to do it ourselves.

257
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Thank you.

258
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Applause)

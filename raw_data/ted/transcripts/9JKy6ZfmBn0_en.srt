Before March, 2011, I was a photographic retoucher

3
0:00:20.581,000 --> 0:00:22,000
based in New York City.

4
0:00:23.528,000 --> 0:00:25,000
We're pale, gray creatures.

5
0:00:25.584,000 --> 0:00:27,000
We hide in dark, windowless rooms,

6
0:00:27.644,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and generally avoid sunlight.

7
0:00:29.972,000 --> 0:00:33,000
We make skinny models skinnier, perfect skin more perfect,

8
0:00:34.236,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and the impossible possible,

9
0:00:36.216,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and we get criticized in the press all the time,

10
0:00:40.266,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but some of us are actually talented artists

11
0:00:43.767,000 --> 0:00:45,000
with years of experience

12
0:00:45.847,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and a real appreciation for images and photography.

13
0:00:49.751,000 --> 0:00:54,000
On March 11, 2011, I watched from home, as the rest

14
0:00:54.915,000 --> 0:00:57,000
of the world did, as the tragic events unfolded in Japan.

15
0:00:58.751,000 --> 0:01:,000
Soon after, an organization I volunteer with,

16
0:01:00.924,000 --> 0:01:03,000
All Hands Volunteers, were on the ground, within days,

17
0:01:04.766,000 --> 0:01:06,000
working as part of the response efforts.

18
0:01:07.598,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers,

19
0:01:09.894,000 --> 0:01:1,000
knew we couldn't just sit at home,

20
0:01:11.558,000 --> 0:01:14,000
so I decided to join them for three weeks.

21
0:01:15.282,000 --> 0:01:18,000

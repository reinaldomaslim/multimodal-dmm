1
0:00:12.758,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm going to first tell you something that in my grandmother

2
0:00:16.524,000 --> 0:00:18,000
would've elicited a five-oy alarm:

3
0:00:19.286,000 --> 0:00:2,000
"Oy-oy-oy-oy-oy."

4
0:00:20.572,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:21.746,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And here it is ... are you ready?

6
0:00:25.522,000 --> 0:00:26,000
OK.

7
0:00:27.73,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I have stage IV lung cancer.

8
0:00:32.269,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Oh, I know, "poor me."

9
0:00:33.595,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I don't feel that way.

10
0:00:34.861,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I'm so OK with it.

11
0:00:37.38,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And granted, I have certain advantages --

12
0:00:39.543,000 --> 0:00:41,000
not everybody can take so cavalier an attitude.

13
0:00:42.224,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I don't have young children.

14
0:00:44.355,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I have a grown daughter who's brilliant and happy and wonderful.

15
0:00:48.674,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I don't have huge financial stress.

16
0:00:52.711,000 --> 0:00:54,000
My cancer isn't that aggressive.

17
0:00:54.745,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's kind of like the Democratic leadership --

18
0:00:56.989,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:00.696,000 --> 0:01:01,000
not convinced it can win.

20
0:01:02.586,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It's basically just sitting there,

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
waiting for Goldman Sachs to give it some money.

22
0:01:06.62,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:07.659,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Applause)

24
0:01:12.572,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Oh, and the best thing of all --

25
0:01:15.429,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I have a major accomplishment under my belt.

26
0:01:18.921,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Yes.

27
0:01:20.096,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I didn't even know it until someone tweeted me a year ago.

28
0:01:24.024,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And here's what they said:

29
0:01:26.27,000 --> 0:01:28,000
"You are responsible

30
0:01:28.515,000 --> 0:01:31,000
for the pussification of the American male."

31
0:01:32.039,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:33.893,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Applause)

33
0:01:37.768,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Not that I can take all the credit, but ...

34
0:01:40.594,000 --> 0:01:44,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:44.856,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But what if you don't have my advantages?

36
0:01:48.809,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The only advice I can give you is to do what I did:

37
0:01:52.507,000 --> 0:01:54,000
make friends with reality.

38
0:01:55.634,000 --> 0:01:58,000
You couldn't have a worse relationship with reality than I did.

39
0:02:00.003,000 --> 0:02:02,000
From the get-go,

40
0:02:02.515,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I wasn't even attracted to reality.

41
0:02:05.376,000 --> 0:02:07,000
If they'd had Tinder when I met reality,

42
0:02:08.107,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I would have swiped left

43
0:02:09.321,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and the whole thing would have been over.

44
0:02:11.338,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:13.028,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And reality and I --

46
0:02:15.041,000 --> 0:02:18,000
we don't share the same values, the same goals --

47
0:02:18.46,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:19.491,000 --> 0:02:21,000
To be honest, I don't have goals;

49
0:02:22.214,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I have fantasies.

50
0:02:24.388,000 --> 0:02:27,000
They're exactly like goals but without the hard work.

51
0:02:28.102,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:30.076,000 --> 0:02:31,000
(Applause)

53
0:02:31.529,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I'm not a big fan of hard work,

54
0:02:34.799,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but you know reality --

55
0:02:36.721,000 --> 0:02:38,000
it's either push, push, push, push, push

56
0:02:39.714,000 --> 0:02:43,000
through its agent, the executive brain function --

57
0:02:44.051,000 --> 0:02:45,000
one of the "yays" of dying:

58
0:02:45.62,000 --> 0:02:48,000
my executive brain function won't have me to kick around anymore.

59
0:02:49.267,000 --> 0:02:53,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:53.337,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But something happened

61
0:02:56.666,000 --> 0:03:,000
that made me realize

62
0:03:00.895,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that reality may not be reality.

63
0:03:05.566,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So what happened was,

64
0:03:07.112,000 --> 0:03:11,000
because I basically wanted reality to leave me alone --

65
0:03:11.596,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but I wanted to be left alone in a nice house

66
0:03:14.613,000 --> 0:03:17,000
with a Wolf range and Sub-Zero refrigerator ...

67
0:03:18.403,000 --> 0:03:2,000
private yoga lessons --

68
0:03:20.778,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I ended up with a development deal at Disney.

69
0:03:24.527,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And one day I found myself in my new office

70
0:03:28.01,000 --> 0:03:3,000
on Two Dopey Drive --

71
0:03:30.349,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:33.363,000 --> 0:03:36,000
which reality thought I should be proud of ...

73
0:03:36.467,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:37.641,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I'm staring at the present they sent me to celebrate my arrival --

75
0:03:42.071,000 --> 0:03:47,000
not the Lalique vase or the grand piano I've heard of other people getting,

76
0:03:47.189,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but a three-foot-tall, stuffed Mickey Mouse

77
0:03:50.57,000 --> 0:03:51,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:51.609,000 --> 0:03:53,000
with a catalog, in case I wanted to order some more stuff

79
0:03:54.491,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that didn't jibe with my aesthetic.

80
0:03:56.519,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:57.58,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And when I looked up in the catalog

82
0:03:59.35,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to see how much this three-foot-high mouse cost,

83
0:04:03.732,000 --> 0:04:05,000
here's how it was described ...

84
0:04:07.603,000 --> 0:04:09,000
"Life-sized."

85
0:04:09.955,000 --> 0:04:13,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:14.817,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And that's when I knew.

87
0:04:16.878,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Reality wasn't "reality."

88
0:04:19.297,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Reality was an imposter.

89
0:04:21.937,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So I dived into quantum physics and chaos theory

90
0:04:26.462,000 --> 0:04:28,000
to try to find actual reality,

91
0:04:28.632,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and I've just finished a movie --

92
0:04:30.301,000 --> 0:04:32,000
yes, finally finished --

93
0:04:32.525,000 --> 0:04:33,000
about all that,

94
0:04:33.727,000 --> 0:04:34,000
so I won't go into it here,

95
0:04:35.056,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and anyway, it wasn't until after we shot the movie,

96
0:04:37.546,000 --> 0:04:39,000
when I broke my leg and then it didn't heal,

97
0:04:39.632,000 --> 0:04:41,000
so then they had to do another surgery a year later,

98
0:04:42.097,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and then that took a year --

99
0:04:43.492,000 --> 0:04:44,000
two years in a wheelchair,

100
0:04:44.773,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and that's when I came into contact with actual reality:

101
0:04:50.747,000 --> 0:04:51,000
limits.

102
0:04:52.598,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Those very limits I'd spent my whole life denying

103
0:04:55.652,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and pushing past and ignoring

104
0:04:59.466,000 --> 0:05:,000
were real,

105
0:05:01.057,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and I had to deal with them,

106
0:05:03.418,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and they took imagination, creativity and my entire skill set.

107
0:05:09.461,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It turned out I was great at actual reality.

108
0:05:14.289,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I didn't just come to terms with it,

109
0:05:16.028,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I fell in love.

110
0:05:17.646,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And I should've known,

111
0:05:19.131,000 --> 0:05:22,000
given my equally shaky relationship with the zeitgeist ...

112
0:05:24.167,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I'll just say, if anyone is in the market for a Betamax --

113
0:05:28.387,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:30.784,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I should have known that the moment I fell in love with reality,

115
0:05:34.656,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the rest of the country would decide to go in the opposite direction.

116
0:05:37.963,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:40.296,000 --> 0:05:44,000
But I'm not here to talk about Trump or the alt-right or climate-change deniers

118
0:05:44.865,000 --> 0:05:46,000
or even the makers of this thing,

119
0:05:47.279,000 --> 0:05:48,000
which I would have called a box,

120
0:05:49.169,000 --> 0:05:51,000
except that right here, it says,

121
0:05:52.078,000 --> 0:05:54,000
"This is not a box."

122
0:05:54.789,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

123
0:05:59.329,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They're gaslighting me.

124
0:06:01.491,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

125
0:06:03.177,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Applause)

126
0:06:06.701,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But what I do want to talk about

127
0:06:11.456,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is a personal challenge to reality

128
0:06:16.598,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that I take personally,

129
0:06:19.269,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and I want to preface it by saying that I absolutely love science.

130
0:06:26.316,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I have this --

131
0:06:27.721,000 --> 0:06:28,000
not a scientist myself --

132
0:06:29.709,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but an uncanny ability to understand everything about science,

133
0:06:34.551,000 --> 0:06:35,000
except the actual science --

134
0:06:36.458,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:37.483,000 --> 0:06:38,000
which is math.

136
0:06:38.705,000 --> 0:06:42,000
But the most outlandish concepts make sense to me.

137
0:06:44.968,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The string theory;

138
0:06:46.381,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the idea that all of reality emanates from the vibrations of these teeny --

139
0:06:50.573,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I call it "The Big Twang."

140
0:06:52.509,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:54.405,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Wave-particle duality:

142
0:06:56.426,000 --> 0:06:59,000
the idea that one thing can manifest as two things ...

143
0:07:00.091,000 --> 0:07:01,000
you know?

144
0:07:01.266,000 --> 0:07:04,000
That a photon can manifest as a wave and a particle

145
0:07:05.112,000 --> 0:07:07,000
coincided with my deepest intuitions

146
0:07:07.497,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that people are good and bad,

147
0:07:09.204,000 --> 0:07:11,000
ideas are right and wrong.

148
0:07:11.318,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Freud was right about penis envy

149
0:07:13.622,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and he was wrong about who has it.

150
0:07:16.226,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:19.839,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Applause)

152
0:07:22.387,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Thank you.

153
0:07:23.654,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Applause)

154
0:07:24.685,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And then there's this slight variation on that,

155
0:07:28.1,000 --> 0:07:3,000
which is reality looks like two things,

156
0:07:30.807,000 --> 0:07:34,000
but it turns out to be the interaction of those two things,

157
0:07:34.989,000 --> 0:07:36,000
like space -- time,

158
0:07:37.161,000 --> 0:07:38,000
mass -- energy

159
0:07:38.826,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and life and death.

160
0:07:42.444,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So I don't understand --

161
0:07:43.997,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I simply just don't understand

162
0:07:47.091,000 --> 0:07:51,000
the mindset of people who are out to "defeat death" and "overcome death."

163
0:07:51.48,000 --> 0:07:52,000
How do you do that?

164
0:07:53.096,000 --> 0:07:55,000
How do you defeat death without killing off life?

165
0:07:56.539,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It doesn't make sense to me.

166
0:07:58.778,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I also have to say,

167
0:08:00.734,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I find it incredibly ungrateful.

168
0:08:04.526,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I mean, you're given this extraordinary gift --

169
0:08:07.315,000 --> 0:08:08,000
life --

170
0:08:08.725,000 --> 0:08:12,000
but it's as if you had asked Santa for a Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow

171
0:08:13.407,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and you had gotten a salad spinner instead.

172
0:08:16.672,000 --> 0:08:18,000
You know, it's the beef --

173
0:08:19.044,000 --> 0:08:22,000
the beef with it is that it comes with an expiration date.

174
0:08:22.889,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Death is the deal breaker.

175
0:08:25.954,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I don't get that.

176
0:08:27.129,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I don't understand --

177
0:08:28.304,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to me, it's disrespectful.

178
0:08:29.972,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It's disrespectful to nature.

179
0:08:32.404,000 --> 0:08:34,000
The idea that we're going to dominate nature,

180
0:08:34.901,000 --> 0:08:36,000
we're going to master nature,

181
0:08:37.107,000 --> 0:08:4,000
nature is too weak to withstand our intellect --

182
0:08:41.884,000 --> 0:08:43,000
no, I don't think so.

183
0:08:45.055,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I think if you've actually read quantum physics as I have --

184
0:08:48.499,000 --> 0:08:5,000
well, I read an email from someone who'd read it, but --

185
0:08:51.395,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Laughter)

186
0:08:55.292,000 --> 0:08:56,000
You have to understand

187
0:08:56.563,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that we don't live in Newton's clockwork universe anymore.

188
0:09:00.42,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We live in a banana peel universe,

189
0:09:03.649,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and we won't ever be able to know everything

190
0:09:07.353,000 --> 0:09:08,000
or control everything

191
0:09:09.023,000 --> 0:09:1,000
or predict everything.

192
0:09:10.53,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Nature is like a self-driving car.

193
0:09:12.761,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The best we can be is like the old woman in that joke --

194
0:09:16.118,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I don't know if you've heard it.

195
0:09:18.252,000 --> 0:09:2,000
An old woman is driving

196
0:09:20.599,000 --> 0:09:24,000
with her middle-aged daughter in the passenger seat,

197
0:09:24.852,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and the mother goes right through a red light.

198
0:09:27.275,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And the daughter doesn't want to say anything that makes it sound like,

199
0:09:31.475,000 --> 0:09:32,000
"You're too old to drive,"

200
0:09:33.193,000 --> 0:09:34,000
so she didn't say anything.

201
0:09:35.028,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And then the mother goes through a second red light,

202
0:09:37.776,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and the daughter, as tactfully as possible,

203
0:09:40.174,000 --> 0:09:42,000
says, "Mom, are you aware

204
0:09:42.353,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that you just went through two red lights?"

205
0:09:44.615,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And the mother says, "Oh, am I driving?"

206
0:09:46.634,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughter)

207
0:09:50.839,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Applause)

208
0:09:55.227,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So ...

209
0:09:58.004,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and now, I'm going to take a mental leap,

210
0:10:02.18,000 --> 0:10:05,000
which is easy for me because I'm the Evel Knievel of mental leaps;

211
0:10:06.093,000 --> 0:10:07,000
my license plate says,

212
0:10:07.912,000 --> 0:10:09,000
"Cogito, ergo zoom."

213
0:10:11.072,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I hope you're willing to come with me on this,

214
0:10:14.463,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but my real problem with the mindset that is so out to defeat death

215
0:10:20.107,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is if you're anti-death,

216
0:10:23.891,000 --> 0:10:25,000
which to me translates as anti-life,

217
0:10:26.312,000 --> 0:10:29,000
which to me translates as anti-nature,

218
0:10:30.197,000 --> 0:10:33,000
it also translates to me as anti-woman,

219
0:10:33.352,000 --> 0:10:37,000
because women have long been identified with nature.

220
0:10:37.682,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And my source on this is Hannah Arendt,

221
0:10:39.948,000 --> 0:10:42,000
the German philosopher who wrote a book called "The Human Condition."

222
0:10:44.17,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And in it, she says that classically,

223
0:10:47.633,000 --> 0:10:49,000
work is associated with men.

224
0:10:50.323,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Work is what comes out of the head;

225
0:10:52.557,000 --> 0:10:53,000
it's what we invent,

226
0:10:53.857,000 --> 0:10:54,000
it's what we create,

227
0:10:55.412,000 --> 0:10:57,000
it's how we leave our mark upon the world.

228
0:10:59.434,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Whereas labor is associated with the body.

229
0:11:03.9,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It's associated with the people who perform labor

230
0:11:06.715,000 --> 0:11:07,000
or undergo labor.

231
0:11:08.915,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So to me,

232
0:11:11.662,000 --> 0:11:15,000
the mindset that denies that,

233
0:11:15.814,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that denies that we're in sync with the biorhythms,

234
0:11:20.151,000 --> 0:11:23,000
the cyclical rhythms of the universe,

235
0:11:23.262,000 --> 0:11:28,000
does not create a hospitable environment for women

236
0:11:28.94,000 --> 0:11:3,000
or for people associated with labor,

237
0:11:31.398,000 --> 0:11:32,000
which is to say,

238
0:11:32.936,000 --> 0:11:35,000
people that we associate as descendants of slaves,

239
0:11:36.379,000 --> 0:11:38,000
or people who perform manual labor.

240
0:11:39.838,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So here's how it looks from a banana-peel-universe point of view,

241
0:11:45.576,000 --> 0:11:48,000
from my mindset, which I call "Emily's universe."

242
0:11:49.808,000 --> 0:11:5,000
First of all,

243
0:11:52.323,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I am incredibly grateful for life,

244
0:11:57.592,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but I don't want to be immortal.

245
0:12:00.132,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I have no interest in having my name live on after me.

246
0:12:04.174,000 --> 0:12:06,000
In fact, I don't want it to,

247
0:12:06.377,000 --> 0:12:07,000
because it's been my observation

248
0:12:08.055,000 --> 0:12:1,000
that no matter how nice and how brilliant

249
0:12:10.804,000 --> 0:12:11,000
or how talented you are,

250
0:12:12.44,000 --> 0:12:14,000
50 years after you die, they turn on you.

251
0:12:15.076,000 --> 0:12:16,000
(Laughter)

252
0:12:16.576,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And I have actual proof of that.

253
0:12:19.115,000 --> 0:12:22,000
A headline from the Los Angeles Times:

254
0:12:22.371,000 --> 0:12:25,000
"Anne Frank: Not so nice after all."

255
0:12:25.526,000 --> 0:12:3,000
(Laughter)

256
0:12:30.82,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Plus, I love being in sync

257
0:12:34.206,000 --> 0:12:36,000
with the cyclical rhythms of the universe.

258
0:12:36.749,000 --> 0:12:38,000
That's what's so extraordinary about life:

259
0:12:39.042,000 --> 0:12:41,000
it's a cycle of generation,

260
0:12:41.263,000 --> 0:12:42,000
degeneration,

261
0:12:42.693,000 --> 0:12:43,000
regeneration.

262
0:12:44.316,000 --> 0:12:47,000
"I" am just a collection of particles

263
0:12:48.238,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that is arranged into this pattern,

264
0:12:51.141,000 --> 0:12:53,000
then will decompose and be available,

265
0:12:53.927,000 --> 0:12:55,000
all of its constituent parts, to nature,

266
0:12:56.498,000 --> 0:12:58,000
to reorganize into another pattern.

267
0:12:59.779,000 --> 0:13:01,000
To me, that is so exciting,

268
0:13:02.262,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and it makes me even more grateful to be part of that process.

269
0:13:07.331,000 --> 0:13:08,000
You know,

270
0:13:09.075,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I look at death now from the point of view of a German biologist,

271
0:13:15.141,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Andreas Weber,

272
0:13:16.62,000 --> 0:13:19,000
who looks at it as part of the gift economy.

273
0:13:20.246,000 --> 0:13:22,000
You're given this enormous gift, life,

274
0:13:23.048,000 --> 0:13:25,000
you enrich it as best you can,

275
0:13:25.415,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and then you give it back.

276
0:13:28.019,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And, you know, Auntie Mame said, "Life is a banquet" --

277
0:13:31.376,000 --> 0:13:33,000
well, I've eaten my fill.

278
0:13:34.126,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I have had an enormous appetite for life,

279
0:13:36.421,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I've consumed life,

280
0:13:37.668,000 --> 0:13:39,000
but in death, I'm going to be consumed.

281
0:13:40.327,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I'm going into the ground just the way I am,

282
0:13:43.802,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and there, I invite every microbe

283
0:13:46.777,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and detritus-er

284
0:13:48.157,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and decomposer

285
0:13:50.331,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to have their fill.

286
0:13:51.521,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I think they'll find me delicious.

287
0:13:54.101,000 --> 0:13:55,000
(Laughter)

288
0:13:55.327,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I do.

289
0:13:57.584,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So the best thing about my attitude, I think, is that it's real.

290
0:14:02.647,000 --> 0:14:03,000
You can see it.

291
0:14:03.997,000 --> 0:14:04,000
You can observe it.

292
0:14:05.172,000 --> 0:14:06,000
It actually happens.

293
0:14:06.662,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Well, maybe not my enriching the gift,

294
0:14:10.401,000 --> 0:14:11,000
I don't know about that --

295
0:14:12.18,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but my life has certainly been enriched by other people.

296
0:14:15.772,000 --> 0:14:16,000
By TED,

297
0:14:17.001,000 --> 0:14:2,000
which introduced me to a whole network of people

298
0:14:20.184,000 --> 0:14:22,000
who have enriched my life,

299
0:14:22.887,000 --> 0:14:25,000
including Tricia McGillis, my website designer,

300
0:14:26.104,000 --> 0:14:28,000
who's working with my wonderful daughter

301
0:14:28.493,000 --> 0:14:31,000
to take my website and turn it into something

302
0:14:32.055,000 --> 0:14:33,000
where all I have to do is write a blog.

303
0:14:33.97,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I don't have to use the executive brain function ...

304
0:14:36.49,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Ha, ha, ha, I win!

305
0:14:40.093,000 --> 0:14:41,000
(Laughter)

306
0:14:41.216,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And I am so grateful to you.

307
0:14:44.853,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I don't want to say "the audience,"

308
0:14:47.397,000 --> 0:14:51,000
because I don't really see it as we're two separate things.

309
0:14:51.826,000 --> 0:14:56,000
I think of it in terms of quantum physics, again.

310
0:14:58.001,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And, you know, quantum physicists are not exactly sure what happens

311
0:15:03.322,000 --> 0:15:05,000
when the wave becomes a particle.

312
0:15:05.944,000 --> 0:15:06,000
There are different theories --

313
0:15:07.507,000 --> 0:15:08,000
the collapse of the wave function,

314
0:15:09.152,000 --> 0:15:1,000
decoherence --

315
0:15:10.327,000 --> 0:15:11,000
but they're all agreed on one thing:

316
0:15:12.067,000 --> 0:15:15,000
that reality comes into being through an interaction.

317
0:15:18.408,000 --> 0:15:19,000
(Voice breaking) So do you.

318
0:15:20.628,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And every audience I've ever had,

319
0:15:22.992,000 --> 0:15:23,000
past and present.

320
0:15:25.508,000 --> 0:15:28,000
Thank you so much for making my life real.

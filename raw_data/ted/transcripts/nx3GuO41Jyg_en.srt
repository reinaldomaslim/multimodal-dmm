1
0:00:16.458,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I would be willing to bet I'm the dumbest guy in the room,

2
0:00:19.285,000 --> 0:00:21,000
because I couldn't get through school; I struggled with school.

3
0:00:22.271,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But I knew at a very early age that I loved money, I loved business

4
0:00:25.505,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and I loved this entrepreneurial thing.

5
0:00:27.416,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I was raised to be an entrepreneur.

6
0:00:29.225,000 --> 0:00:31,000
What I've been really passionate about ever since --

7
0:00:31.702,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I've never spoken about this ever, until now --

8
0:00:34.543,000 --> 0:00:36,000
so this is the first time anyone's heard it,

9
0:00:36.624,000 --> 0:00:37,000
except my wife, three days ago.

10
0:00:38.146,000 --> 0:00:39,000
She said, "What are you talking about?"

11
0:00:40.068,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I told her that I think we miss an opportunity

12
0:00:43.031,000 --> 0:00:46,000
to find these kids who have the entrepreneurial traits,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and to groom them or show them

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
that being an entrepreneur is actually a cool thing.

15
0:00:50.962,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It's not something that is a bad thing and is vilified,

16
0:00:54.319,000 --> 0:00:56,000
which is what happens in a lot of society.

17
0:00:56.767,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Kids, when we grow up, have dreams,

18
0:00:59.926,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and we have passions, and we have visions,

19
0:01:01.956,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and somehow we get those things crushed.

20
0:01:03.913,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We get told that we need to study harder

21
0:01:05.952,000 --> 0:01:07,000
or be more focused or get a tutor.

22
0:01:08.613,000 --> 0:01:11,000
My parents got me a tutor in French, and I still suck in French.

23
0:01:13.732,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Two years ago,

24
0:01:14.909,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I was the highest-rated lecturer at MIT's Entrepreneurial Master's Program.

25
0:01:18.527,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It was a speaking event in front of groups of entrepreneurs

26
0:01:21.354,000 --> 0:01:22,000
from around the world.

27
0:01:22.535,000 --> 0:01:24,000
When I was in grade two, I won a citywide speaking competition,

28
0:01:25.522,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but nobody had ever said, "Hey, this kid's a good speaker.

29
0:01:28.3,000 --> 0:01:31,000
He can't focus, but he loves walking around and getting people energized."

30
0:01:31.842,000 --> 0:01:33,000
No one said, "Get him a coach in speaking."

31
0:01:33.886,000 --> 0:01:35,000
They said, get me a tutor in what I suck at.

32
0:01:36.017,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So as kids show these traits -- and we need to start looking for them --

33
0:01:39.79,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I think we should be raising kids to be entrepreneurs instead of lawyers.

34
0:01:44.209,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Unfortunately, the school system is grooming this world to say,

35
0:01:47.751,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"Let's be a lawyer," or, "Let's be a doctor."

36
0:01:49.899,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We're missing that opportunity,

37
0:01:51.401,000 --> 0:01:53,000
because no one ever says, "Hey, be an entrepreneur."

38
0:01:53.858,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Entrepreneurs are people -- we have a lot of them in this room --

39
0:01:56.933,000 --> 0:01:58,000
who have ideas and passions or see these needs in the world

40
0:01:59.774,000 --> 0:02:,000
and decide to stand up and do it.

41
0:02:01.448,000 --> 0:02:03,000
And we put everything on the line to make that stuff happen.

42
0:02:04.322,000 --> 0:02:06,000
We have the ability to get the groups of people around us

43
0:02:07.075,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that want to build that dream with us.

44
0:02:08.972,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And I think if we could get kids to embrace the idea at a young age,

45
0:02:12.679,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of being entrepreneurial,

46
0:02:13.917,000 --> 0:02:15,000
we could change everything in the world that's a problem today.

47
0:02:16.928,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Every problem out there, somebody has the idea for.

48
0:02:19.358,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And as a young kid, nobody can say it can't happen,

49
0:02:21.989,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because you're too dumb to realize that you couldn't figure it out.

50
0:02:25.781,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I think we have an obligation as parents and a society

51
0:02:28.365,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to start teaching our kids to fish instead of giving them the fish --

52
0:02:32.555,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the old parable: "Give a man a fish, you feed him for a day.

53
0:02:35.444,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Teach a man to fish, you feed him for a lifetime."

54
0:02:37.818,000 --> 0:02:39,000
If we can teach our kids to be entrepreneurial,

55
0:02:40.05,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the ones that show the traits to be,

56
0:02:41.804,000 --> 0:02:44,000
like we teach the ones who have science gifts to go on in science,

57
0:02:44.955,000 --> 0:02:46,000
what if we saw the ones with entrepreneurial traits

58
0:02:47.392,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and taught them to be entrepreneurs?

59
0:02:49.152,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We could have these kids spreading businesses

60
0:02:51.28,000 --> 0:02:53,000
instead of waiting for government handouts.

61
0:02:53.333,000 --> 0:02:55,000
What we do is teach our kids the things they shouldn't do:

62
0:02:56.087,000 --> 0:02:57,000
don't hit; don't bite; don't swear.

63
0:02:57.899,000 --> 0:03:,000
Right now we teach our kids to go after really good jobs;

64
0:03:00.957,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the school system teaches them to go after things like

65
0:03:03.561,000 --> 0:03:06,000
being a doctor and being a lawyer and being an accountant and a dentist

66
0:03:06.966,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and a teacher and a pilot.

67
0:03:08.244,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And the media says it's really cool if we could go out

68
0:03:10.928,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and be a model or a singer

69
0:03:12.451,000 --> 0:03:14,000
or a sports hero like Luongo or Crosby.

70
0:03:15.41,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Our MBA programs do not teach kids to be entrepreneurs.

71
0:03:19.01,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The reason I avoided an MBA program, other than that I didn't get into any,

72
0:03:22.596,000 --> 0:03:24,000
since I had a 61 percent average out of high school,

73
0:03:25.083,000 --> 0:03:26,000
then a 61 percent average

74
0:03:26.302,000 --> 0:03:28,000
at the only school in Canada that accepted me, Carlton,

75
0:03:29.001,000 --> 0:03:31,000
is that our MBA programs don't teach kids to be entrepreneurs.

76
0:03:31.991,000 --> 0:03:32,000
They teach them to work in corporations.

77
0:03:33.942,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So who's starting these companies? It's these random few people.

78
0:03:37.069,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Even in popular literature, the only book I've ever found --

79
0:03:40.096,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and this should be on all your reading lists --

80
0:03:42.319,000 --> 0:03:43,000
the only book I've ever found

81
0:03:43.733,000 --> 0:03:45,000
that makes the entrepreneur a hero is "Atlas Shrugged."

82
0:03:46.337,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Everything else in the world looks at entrepreneurs

83
0:03:48.775,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and says we're bad people.

84
0:03:50.07,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I look at even my family.

85
0:03:51.302,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Both my grandfathers and my dad were entrepreneurs.

86
0:03:53.777,000 --> 0:03:56,000
My brother, sister and I, all three of us own companies as well.

87
0:03:56.824,000 --> 0:03:59,000
We all decided to start these things because it's the only place we fit.

88
0:04:00.415,000 --> 0:04:03,000
We didn't fit in normal work; we couldn't work for somebody else,

89
0:04:03.511,000 --> 0:04:05,000
we're stubborn and we have all these other traits.

90
0:04:05.875,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But kids could be entrepreneurs as well.

91
0:04:07.812,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I'm a big part of a couple organizations

92
0:04:09.749,000 --> 0:04:12,000
called the Entrepreneurs' Organization and the Young Presidents' Organization.

93
0:04:13.445,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I just came back from speaking in Barcelona at the YPO global conference.

94
0:04:16.914,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And everyone I met over there who's an entrepreneur

95
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
struggled with school.

96
0:04:21.8,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I have 18 out of the 19 signs of attention deficit disorder diagnosed.

97
0:04:25.403,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So this thing right here is freaking me out.

98
0:04:28.236,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:30.664,000 --> 0:04:31,000
It's probably why I'm a bit panicked,

100
0:04:32.487,000 --> 0:04:34,000
other than all the caffeine I've had and the sugar.

101
0:04:34.915,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But this is really creepy for an entrepreneur.

102
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Attention deficit disorder, bipolar disorder.

103
0:04:39.427,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Do you know that bipolar disorder is nicknamed the CEO disease?

104
0:04:42.451,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Ted Turner's got it. Steve Jobs has it.

105
0:04:45.149,000 --> 0:04:48,000
All three of the founders of Netscape had it.

106
0:04:48.565,000 --> 0:04:49,000
I could go on and on.

107
0:04:49.972,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Kids -- you can see these signs in kids.

108
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And we're giving them Ritalin and saying,

109
0:04:54.412,000 --> 0:04:56,000
"Don't be an entrepreneurial type.

110
0:04:56.529,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Fit into this other system and try to become a student."

111
0:04:59.203,000 --> 0:05:,000
Sorry, entrepreneurs aren't students.

112
0:05:00.999,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We fast-track. We figure out the game.

113
0:05:02.856,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I stole essays. I cheated on exams.

114
0:05:04.928,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I hired kids to do my accounting assignments in university

115
0:05:07.729,000 --> 0:05:08,000
for 13 consecutive assignments.

116
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But as an entrepreneur, you don't do accounting, you hire accountants.

117
0:05:12.639,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So I just figured that out earlier.

118
0:05:14.57,000 --> 0:05:15,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Applause)

120
0:05:18.069,000 --> 0:05:21,000
At least I can admit I cheated in university; most of you won't.

121
0:05:21.283,000 --> 0:05:24,000
I'm also quoted -- and I told the person who wrote the textbook --

122
0:05:24.641,000 --> 0:05:26,000
I'm now quoted in that exact same university textbook

123
0:05:27.197,000 --> 0:05:29,000
in every Canadian university and college studies --

124
0:05:30.027,000 --> 0:05:32,000
in managerial accounting, I'm chapter eight.

125
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I open up chapter eight, talking about budgeting.

126
0:05:34.57,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I told the author, after they did my interview,

127
0:05:36.789,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that I cheated in that same course.

128
0:05:38.511,000 --> 0:05:4,000
She thought it was too funny to not include it.

129
0:05:40.926,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But kids, you can see these signs in them.

130
0:05:43.299,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The definition of entrepreneur is "a person who organizes, operates

131
0:05:46.622,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and assumes the risk of a business venture."

132
0:05:48.86,000 --> 0:05:5,000
That doesn't mean you have to go to an MBA program,

133
0:05:51.29,000 --> 0:05:52,000
or that you have to get through school.

134
0:05:53.184,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It just means that those few things have to feel right in your gut.

135
0:05:56.379,000 --> 0:05:58,000
We've heard, "Is it nurture or is it nature?" Right?

136
0:05:58.869,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Is it thing one or thing two? What is it?

137
0:06:00.871,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Well, I don't think it's either. I think it can be both.

138
0:06:03.524,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I was groomed as an entrepreneur.

139
0:06:05.151,000 --> 0:06:07,000
When I was growing up as a young kid, I had no choice,

140
0:06:07.935,000 --> 0:06:08,000
because I was taught at a very early age,

141
0:06:09.935,000 --> 0:06:11,000
when my dad realized I didn't fit into everything else

142
0:06:12.569,000 --> 0:06:13,000
that was being taught to me in school,

143
0:06:14.428,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that he could teach me to figure out business at an early age.

144
0:06:17.403,000 --> 0:06:2,000
He groomed us, the three of us, to hate the thought of having a job

145
0:06:20.675,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and to love the fact of creating companies

146
0:06:22.708,000 --> 0:06:23,000
where we could employ other people.

147
0:06:24.407,000 --> 0:06:26,000
My first business venture: I was seven years old, in Winnipeg.

148
0:06:27.365,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I was in my bedroom with one of those long extension cords,

149
0:06:30.162,000 --> 0:06:31,000
calling all the dry cleaners in Winnipeg

150
0:06:32.113,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to find out how much they'd pay me for coat hangers.

151
0:06:34.569,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And my mom came into the room and said,

152
0:06:36.57,000 --> 0:06:39,000
"Where are you going to get the hangers to sell to the dry cleaners?"

153
0:06:39.894,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And I said, "Let's go look in the basement."

154
0:06:42.017,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We went down to the basement, and I opened up this cupboard.

155
0:06:44.867,000 --> 0:06:46,000
There was about 1,000 hangers that I'd collected,

156
0:06:47.209,000 --> 0:06:49,000
because, when I told her I was going out to play,

157
0:06:49.535,000 --> 0:06:51,000
I was going door to door in the neighborhood

158
0:06:51.615,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to collect hangers to put in the basement,

159
0:06:53.701,000 --> 0:06:55,000
because I saw her a few weeks before that --

160
0:06:56.321,000 --> 0:06:58,000
you could get paid, they used to pay two cents per coat hanger.

161
0:06:59.323,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So I was like, well, there's all kinds of hangers,

162
0:07:01.709,000 --> 0:07:02,000
so I'll just go get them.

163
0:07:02.935,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I knew she wouldn't want me to get them,

164
0:07:04.871,000 --> 0:07:05,000
so I just did it anyway.

165
0:07:06.1,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And I learned that you could actually negotiate with people.

166
0:07:08.935,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This one guy offered me three cents and I got him up to three and a half.

167
0:07:12.431,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I even knew at seven years old

168
0:07:13.901,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that I could get a fractional percent of a cent,

169
0:07:16.179,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and people would pay it, because it multiplied up.

170
0:07:18.55,000 --> 0:07:19,000
At seven years old I figured it out.

171
0:07:20.305,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I got three and a half cents for 1,000 hangers.

172
0:07:22.538,000 --> 0:07:24,000
I sold license plate protectors door to door.

173
0:07:24.674,000 --> 0:07:25,000
My dad actually made me go find someone

174
0:07:26.585,000 --> 0:07:27,000
who would sell me them at wholesale.

175
0:07:28.369,000 --> 0:07:3,000
At nine years old, I walked around in the city of Sudbury

176
0:07:31.082,000 --> 0:07:33,000
selling license-plate protectors door to door.

177
0:07:33.264,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And I remember this one customer so vividly --

178
0:07:35.468,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I also did some other stuff with these clients, I sold newspapers,

179
0:07:39.043,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and he wouldn't buy a newspaper from me, ever.

180
0:07:41.219,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But I was convinced I was going to get him to buy a license-plate protector.

181
0:07:44.823,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And he's like, "We don't need one."

182
0:07:46.524,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I said, "But you've got two cars."

183
0:07:48.196,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Remember, I'm nine years old.

184
0:07:49.626,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I'm like, "You have two cars and they don't have license-plate protectors.

185
0:07:53.158,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And this car has one license plate that's all crumpled up."

186
0:07:55.996,000 --> 0:07:56,000
He said, "That's my wife's car."

187
0:07:57.574,000 --> 0:08:,000
I said, "Why don't we test one on her car and see if it lasts longer?"

188
0:08:00.935,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So I knew there were two cars with two license plates on each.

189
0:08:03.935,000 --> 0:08:05,000
If I couldn't sell all four, I could at least get one.

190
0:08:06.553,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I learned that at a young age.

191
0:08:08.025,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I did comic book arbitrage.

192
0:08:09.343,000 --> 0:08:11,000
When I was about 10 years old, I sold comic books

193
0:08:11.687,000 --> 0:08:12,000
out of our cottage on Georgian Bay.

194
0:08:13.451,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I would go biking up to the end of the beach,

195
0:08:15.58,000 --> 0:08:16,000
buy all the comics from the poor kids,

196
0:08:17.478,000 --> 0:08:2,000
then go back to the other end of the beach to sell them to the rich kids.

197
0:08:20.935,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It was obvious to me: buy low, sell high.

198
0:08:22.935,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You've got this demand over here that has money.

199
0:08:25.207,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Don't try to sell to the poor kids; they don't have cash.

200
0:08:27.977,000 --> 0:08:28,000
The rich people do. Obvious, right?

201
0:08:29.844,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It's like a recession.

202
0:08:31.031,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So there's a recession.

203
0:08:32.222,000 --> 0:08:35,000
There's still 13 trillion dollars circulating in the US economy.

204
0:08:35.262,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Go get some of that. I learned that at a young age.

205
0:08:37.874,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I also learned, don't reveal your source:

206
0:08:39.888,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I got beat up after four weeks of this,

207
0:08:41.795,000 --> 0:08:44,000
because one of the rich kids found out where I was buying my comics,

208
0:08:45.126,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and didn't like that he was paying more.

209
0:08:47.071,000 --> 0:08:49,000
I was forced to get a paper route at 10 years old.

210
0:08:49.458,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I didn't want a paper route, but my dad said, "That's your next business."

211
0:08:53.002,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Not only did he get me one, but I had to get two.

212
0:08:55.35,000 --> 0:08:57,000
He wanted me to hire someone to deliver half the papers,

213
0:08:58.065,000 --> 0:08:59,000
which I did.

214
0:08:59.24,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Then I realized: collecting tips is how you made all the money.

215
0:09:02.272,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So I'd collect tips and get payment.

216
0:09:04.024,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I would collect for the papers -- he could just deliver them.

217
0:09:06.935,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Because then I realized I could make money.

218
0:09:08.974,000 --> 0:09:1,000
By this point, I was definitely not going to be an employee.

219
0:09:11.832,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter)

220
0:09:13.228,000 --> 0:09:15,000
My dad owned an automotive and industrial repair shop.

221
0:09:15.784,000 --> 0:09:17,000
He had all these old automotive parts lying around.

222
0:09:18.224,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They had this old brass and copper.

223
0:09:19.923,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I asked what he did with it, and he said he just throws it out.

224
0:09:22.924,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I said, "Wouldn't somebody pay for that?" And he goes, "Maybe."

225
0:09:25.934,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Remember: at 10 years old, 34 years ago,

226
0:09:27.887,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I saw opportunity in this stuff, I saw there was money in garbage.

227
0:09:31.01,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And I collected it from the automotive shops in the area on my bicycle.

228
0:09:34.386,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Then my dad would drive me on Saturdays to a scrap metal recycler

229
0:09:37.495,000 --> 0:09:38,000
where I got paid.

230
0:09:38.674,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And I thought that was kind of cool.

231
0:09:40.418,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Strangely enough, 30 years later, we're building 1-800-GOT-JUNK?

232
0:09:43.491,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and making money off that, too.

233
0:09:45.003,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I built these little pincushions when I was 11 years old in Cubs.

234
0:09:48.081,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We made these pincushions for our moms for Mother's Day

235
0:09:50.701,000 --> 0:09:51,000
out of wooden clothespins --

236
0:09:52.381,000 --> 0:09:54,000
when we used to hang clothes on clotheslines outside.

237
0:09:54.899,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And you'd make these chairs.

238
0:09:56.289,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And I had these little pillows that I would sew up.

239
0:09:58.711,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And you could stuff pins in them.

240
0:10:00.333,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Because people used to sew and they needed a pincushion.

241
0:10:04.317,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But I realized you had to have options,

242
0:10:06.438,000 --> 0:10:08,000
so I spray-painted a whole bunch of them brown,

243
0:10:08.682,000 --> 0:10:11,000
so when I went to the door, it wasn't, "Do you want to buy one?"

244
0:10:11.71,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It was, "Which color would you like?"

245
0:10:13.51,000 --> 0:10:15,000
I'm 10 years old; you're not going to say no,

246
0:10:15.642,000 --> 0:10:18,000
especially if you have two options, the brown one or the clear one.

247
0:10:18.847,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So I learned that lesson at a young age.

248
0:10:20.796,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I learned that manual labor really sucks.

249
0:10:23.178,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Right, like cutting lawns is brutal.

250
0:10:26.191,000 --> 0:10:29,000
But because I had to cut lawns all summer for all of our neighbors

251
0:10:29.329,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and get paid to do that,

252
0:10:30.536,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I realized that recurring revenue from one client is amazing,

253
0:10:34.03,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that if I land this client once,

254
0:10:36.45,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and every week I get paid by that person,

255
0:10:38.597,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that's way better than trying to sell one clothespin thing to one person,

256
0:10:42.935,000 --> 0:10:43,000
because you can't sell them more.

257
0:10:44.58,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So I love that recurring revenue model I started to learn at a young age.

258
0:10:48.073,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Remember, I was being groomed to do this. I was not allowed to have jobs.

259
0:10:51.557,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I would go to the golf course and caddy for people,

260
0:10:53.999,000 --> 0:10:56,000
but I realized there was this one hill on our golf course, the 13th hole,

261
0:10:57.513,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that had this huge hill,

262
0:10:58.711,000 --> 0:11:,000
and people could never get their bags up it.

263
0:11:00.808,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So I'd sit there in a lawn chair and carry for all the people

264
0:11:03.721,000 --> 0:11:04,000
who didn't have caddies.

265
0:11:04.921,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I'd carry their golf bags to the top; they'd pay me a dollar,

266
0:11:07.816,000 --> 0:11:09,000
while my friends worked for hours hauling some guy's bag around

267
0:11:10.801,000 --> 0:11:11,000
for 10 bucks.

268
0:11:11.983,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I'm like, "That's stupid. You have to work for five hours.

269
0:11:14.728,000 --> 0:11:17,000
That doesn't make sense. Figure out a way to make more money faster.

270
0:11:17.953,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Every week, I'd go to the corner store and buy all these pops,

271
0:11:20.888,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Then I'd deliver them to these 70-year-old women playing bridge.

272
0:11:23.935,000 --> 0:11:25,000
They'd give me their orders for the following week.

273
0:11:26.403,000 --> 0:11:27,000
I'd deliver pop and charge twice.

274
0:11:28.061,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I had this captured market.

275
0:11:29.394,000 --> 0:11:32,000
You didn't need contracts, you just needed to have a supply and demand

276
0:11:33.078,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and this audience who bought into you.

277
0:11:34.935,000 --> 0:11:36,000
These women weren't going to go to anybody else

278
0:11:37.155,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because they liked me, and I kind of figured it out.

279
0:11:39.657,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I went and got golf balls from golf courses.

280
0:11:41.799,000 --> 0:11:43,000
But everybody else was looking in the bush

281
0:11:43.935,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and looking in the ditches for golf balls.

282
0:11:46.011,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I'm like, screw that. They're in the pond. And nobody's going into the pond.

283
0:11:49.742,000 --> 0:11:52,000
So I'd go into the ponds and crawl around and pick them up with my toes,

284
0:11:53.154,000 --> 0:11:54,000
just pick them up with both feet.

285
0:11:54.771,000 --> 0:11:55,000
You can't do it onstage.

286
0:11:56.605,000 --> 0:11:58,000
You get the golf balls, throw them in your bathing suit trunks

287
0:11:59.558,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and when you're done, you've got a couple hundred of them.

288
0:12:02.321,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But the problem is, people didn't want all the golf balls.

289
0:12:05.102,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So I just packaged them. I'm like 12, right?

290
0:12:07.222,000 --> 0:12:08,000
I packaged them up three ways.

291
0:12:08.683,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I had the Pinnacles, DDHs and the really cool ones.

292
0:12:11.106,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Those sold for two dollars each.

293
0:12:12.661,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Then I had the good ones that didn't look crappy: 50 cents each.

294
0:12:15.731,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And then I'd sell 50 at a time of all the crappy ones.

295
0:12:18.333,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And they could use those for practice balls.

296
0:12:20.609,000 --> 0:12:22,000
I sold sunglasses when I was in school,

297
0:12:23.487,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to all the kids in high school.

298
0:12:25.108,000 --> 0:12:27,000
This is what really kind of gets everybody hating you,

299
0:12:27.719,000 --> 0:12:3,000
because you're trying to extract money from all your friends all the time.

300
0:12:31.241,000 --> 0:12:32,000
But it paid the bills.

301
0:12:32.447,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So I sold lots and lots of sunglasses.

302
0:12:34.34,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Then when the school shut me down --

303
0:12:36.118,000 --> 0:12:38,000
they called me into the office and told me I couldn't do it --

304
0:12:39.071,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I went to the gas stations and sold lots of them to the gas stations

305
0:12:42.646,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and had the gas stations sell them to their customers.

306
0:12:45.217,000 --> 0:12:47,000
That was cool because then, I had retail outlets.

307
0:12:47.605,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I think I was 14.

308
0:12:48.78,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Then I paid my entire way through first year of university at Carlton

309
0:12:52.06,000 --> 0:12:53,000
by selling wineskins door to door.

310
0:12:53.716,000 --> 0:12:55,000
You know you can hold a 40-ounce bottle of rum

311
0:12:55.9,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and two bottles of coke in a wineskin?

312
0:12:57.757,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So what, right? But you know what?

313
0:12:59.415,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Stuff that down your shorts when you go to a football game,

314
0:13:02.205,000 --> 0:13:03,000
you can get booze in for free.

315
0:13:03.667,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Everybody bought them.

316
0:13:04.891,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Supply, demand, big opportunity.

317
0:13:07.211,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I also branded it, so I sold them for five times the normal cost.

318
0:13:10.336,000 --> 0:13:11,000
It had our university logo on it.

319
0:13:11.935,000 --> 0:13:13,000
You know, we teach our kids and we buy them games,

320
0:13:14.328,000 --> 0:13:17,000
but why don't we get them games, if they're entrepreneurial kids,

321
0:13:17.449,000 --> 0:13:19,000
that nurture the traits you need to be entrepreneurs?

322
0:13:19.96,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Why don't you teach them not to waste money?

323
0:13:22.274,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I remember being told to walk out into the middle of a street

324
0:13:25.21,000 --> 0:13:26,000
in Banff, Alberta.

325
0:13:26.404,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I'd thrown a penny out in the street,

326
0:13:28.238,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and my dad said, "Go pick it up.

327
0:13:29.795,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I work too damn hard for my money. I'm not going to see you waste a penny."

328
0:13:33.431,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I remember that lesson to this day.

329
0:13:35.139,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Allowances teach kids the wrong habits.

330
0:13:37.057,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Allowances, by nature, are teaching kids to think about a job.

331
0:13:40.652,000 --> 0:13:42,000
An entrepreneur doesn't expect a regular paycheck.

332
0:13:43.653,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Allowance is breeding kids at a young age to expect a regular paycheck.

333
0:13:47.358,000 --> 0:13:49,000
That's wrong, for me, if you want to raise entrepreneurs.

334
0:13:50.071,000 --> 0:13:51,000
What I do with my kids, nine and seven,

335
0:13:52.082,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is teach them to walk around the house and the yard,

336
0:13:54.576,000 --> 0:13:55,000
looking for stuff that needs to get done.

337
0:13:56.577,000 --> 0:13:57,000
Come and tell me what it is.

338
0:13:57.988,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Or I'll say, "Here's what I need done."

339
0:13:59.935,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And then, you know what we do? We negotiate.

340
0:14:02.057,000 --> 0:14:03,000
They go around looking for what it is,

341
0:14:03.935,000 --> 0:14:04,000
then we negotiate what they'll get paid.

342
0:14:05.935,000 --> 0:14:06,000
They don't have a regular check,

343
0:14:07.585,000 --> 0:14:09,000
but they have opportunities to find more stuff,

344
0:14:09.847,000 --> 0:14:12,000
and learn the skill of negotiating and of finding opportunities.

345
0:14:12.935,000 --> 0:14:13,000
You breed that kind of stuff.

346
0:14:14.365,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Each of my kids has two piggy banks.

347
0:14:16.158,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Fifty percent of all the money they earn goes in their house account,

348
0:14:19.637,000 --> 0:14:2,000
50 percent goes in their toy account.

349
0:14:21.439,000 --> 0:14:23,000
The toy account, they spend on whatever they want.

350
0:14:23.834,000 --> 0:14:26,000
The 50 percent in their house account, every six months, goes to the bank.

351
0:14:27.366,000 --> 0:14:28,000
they walk up with me.

352
0:14:28.541,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Every year, all the money in the bank goes to their broker.

353
0:14:31.363,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Both my nine- and seven-year-olds have a stockbroker already.

354
0:14:34.355,000 --> 0:14:36,000
I'm teaching them to force that savings habit.

355
0:14:36.579,000 --> 0:14:38,000
It drives me crazy that 30-year-olds are saying,

356
0:14:38.89,000 --> 0:14:4,000
"Maybe I'll start contributing to my RSP now."

357
0:14:41.106,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Shit, you've missed 25 years.

358
0:14:42.861,000 --> 0:14:43,000
You can teach those habits to young kids,

359
0:14:44.85,000 --> 0:14:45,000
when they don't even feel the pain yet.

360
0:14:46.748,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Don't read bedtime stories every night -- maybe four nights of the week,

361
0:14:50.934,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and three nights, have them tell stories.

362
0:14:53.237,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Why don't you sit down with kids and give them four items,

363
0:14:56.021,000 --> 0:14:58,000
a red shirt, a blue tie, a kangaroo and a laptop,

364
0:14:58.935,000 --> 0:15:,000
and have them tell a story about those four things?

365
0:15:01.388,000 --> 0:15:02,000
My kids do that all the time.

366
0:15:02.81,000 --> 0:15:04,000
It teaches them to sell, teaches them creativity,

367
0:15:05.151,000 --> 0:15:06,000
teaches them to think on their feet.

368
0:15:06.99,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Do that kind of stuff, have fun with it.

369
0:15:08.935,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Get kids to stand up in front of groups and talk,

370
0:15:11.277,000 --> 0:15:13,000
even if it's just in front of their friends,

371
0:15:13.376,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and do plays and have speeches.

372
0:15:14.882,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Those are entrepreneurial traits you want to be nurturing.

373
0:15:17.651,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Show kids what bad customers or bad employees look like.

374
0:15:20.323,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Show them grumpy employees.

375
0:15:21.681,000 --> 0:15:23,000
When you see grumpy customer service, point it out.

376
0:15:24.185,000 --> 0:15:26,000
Say, "By the way, that guy is a crappy employee."

377
0:15:26.531,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And say, "These are good ones."

378
0:15:28.115,000 --> 0:15:3,000
(Laughter)

379
0:15:30.172,000 --> 0:15:32,000
If you go into a restaurant and have bad customer service,

380
0:15:32.93,000 --> 0:15:34,000
show them what bad customer service looks like.

381
0:15:35.194,000 --> 0:15:36,000
(Laughter)

382
0:15:37.11,000 --> 0:15:38,000
We have all these lessons in front of us,

383
0:15:39.11,000 --> 0:15:42,000
but we don't take those opportunities; we teach kids to get a tutor.

384
0:15:42.37,000 --> 0:15:45,000
Imagine if you actually took all the kids' junk in the house right now,

385
0:15:45.768,000 --> 0:15:46,000
all the toys they outgrew two years ago

386
0:15:47.674,000 --> 0:15:5,000
and said, "Why don't we sell some of this on Craigslist and Kijiji?"

387
0:15:50.919,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And they actually sell it and learn how to find scammers when offers come in.

388
0:15:54.634,000 --> 0:15:56,000
They can come into your account or a sub account or whatever.

389
0:15:57.542,000 --> 0:15:59,000
But teach them how to fix the price, guess the price,

390
0:16:00.051,000 --> 0:16:01,000
pull up the photos.

391
0:16:01.935,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Teach them how to do that kind of stuff and make money.

392
0:16:04.615,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Then 50 percent goes in their house account,

393
0:16:06.704,000 --> 0:16:07,000
50 percent in their toy account.

394
0:16:08.286,000 --> 0:16:09,000
My kids love this stuff.

395
0:16:09.518,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Some of the entrepreneurial traits you've got to nurture in kids:

396
0:16:12.608,000 --> 0:16:15,000
attainment, tenacity, leadership, introspection, interdependence, values.

397
0:16:16.078,000 --> 0:16:19,000
All these traits, you can find in young kids, and you can help nurture them.

398
0:16:19.699,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Look for that kind of stuff.

399
0:16:21.063,000 --> 0:16:23,000
There's two traits I want you to also look out for

400
0:16:23.477,000 --> 0:16:25,000
that we don't get out of their system.

401
0:16:25.692,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Don't medicate kids for attention deficit disorder

402
0:16:28.098,000 --> 0:16:29,000
unless it is really, really freaking bad.

403
0:16:30.099,000 --> 0:16:31,000
(Applause)

404
0:16:31.695,000 --> 0:16:34,000
The same with the whole things on mania and stress and depression,

405
0:16:34.837,000 --> 0:16:35,000
unless it is so clinically brutal, man.

406
0:16:36.838,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Bipolar disorder is nicknamed "the CEO disease."

407
0:16:39.321,000 --> 0:16:43,000
When Steve Jurvetson, Jim Clark and Jim Barksdale have all got it,

408
0:16:43.895,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and they built Netscape --

409
0:16:45.335,000 --> 0:16:46,000
imagine if they were given Ritalin.

410
0:16:47.069,000 --> 0:16:48,000
We wouldn't have that stuff, right?

411
0:16:48.935,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Al Gore really would have had to invented the Internet.

412
0:16:51.712,000 --> 0:16:52,000
(Laughter)

413
0:16:53.474,000 --> 0:16:55,000
These are the skills we should be teaching in the classroom,

414
0:16:56.413,000 --> 0:16:57,000
as well as everything else.

415
0:16:57.732,000 --> 0:16:59,000
I'm not saying don't get kids to want to be lawyers.

416
0:17:00.252,000 --> 0:17:03,000
But how about getting entrepreneurship to be ranked right up there

417
0:17:03.429,000 --> 0:17:04,000
with the rest of them?

418
0:17:04.605,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Because there's huge opportunities in that.

419
0:17:06.659,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I want to close with a quick video

420
0:17:08.39,000 --> 0:17:1,000
that was done by one of the companies I mentor.

421
0:17:10.645,000 --> 0:17:11,000
These guys, Grasshopper.

422
0:17:12.163,000 --> 0:17:13,000
It's about kids.

423
0:17:13.352,000 --> 0:17:14,000
It's about entrepreneurship.

424
0:17:14.742,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Hopefully, this inspires you to take what you've heard from me

425
0:17:17.691,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and do something with it to change the world.

426
0:17:20.164,000 --> 0:17:22,000
[Kid... "And you thought you could do anything?"]

427
0:17:22.482,000 --> 0:17:23,000
[You still can.]

428
0:17:24.483,000 --> 0:17:26,000
[Because a lot of what we consider impossible]

429
0:17:27.34,000 --> 0:17:29,000
[is easy to overcome]

430
0:17:29.935,000 --> 0:17:32,000
[Because in case you haven't noticed, we live in a place where]

431
0:17:32.959,000 --> 0:17:34,000
[one individual can make a difference]

432
0:17:35.721,000 --> 0:17:36,000
[Want proof?]

433
0:17:36.944,000 --> 0:17:38,000
[Just look at the people who built our country:]

434
0:17:39.255,000 --> 0:17:41,000
[Our parents, grandparents, our aunts, uncles]

435
0:17:41.472,000 --> 0:17:43,000
[They were immigrants, newcomers ready to make their mark]

436
0:17:44.266,000 --> 0:17:46,000
[Maybe they came with very little]

437
0:17:46.935,000 --> 0:17:48,000
[or perhaps they didn't own anything except for]

438
0:17:49.219,000 --> 0:17:51,000
[a single brilliant idea]

439
0:17:52.109,000 --> 0:17:54,000
[These people were thinkers, doers]

440
0:17:55.768,000 --> 0:17:56,000
[innovators]

441
0:17:57.649,000 --> 0:17:58,000
[until they came up with the name]

442
0:18:01.409,000 --> 0:18:03,000
[entrepreneurs]

443
0:18:04.424,000 --> 0:18:06,000
[They change the way we think about what is possible.]

444
0:18:07.002,000 --> 0:18:09,000
[They have a clear vision of how life can be better]

445
0:18:09.573,000 --> 0:18:11,000
[for all of us, even when times are tough.]

446
0:18:11.792,000 --> 0:18:12,000
[Right now, it's hard to see]

447
0:18:13.248,000 --> 0:18:15,000
[when our view is cluttered with obstacles.]

448
0:18:16.003,000 --> 0:18:2,000
[But turbulence creates opportunities]

449
0:18:20.273,000 --> 0:18:23,000
[for success, achievement, and pushes us]

450
0:18:23.919,000 --> 0:18:24,000
[to discover new ways of doing things]

451
0:18:26.226,000 --> 0:18:28,000
[So what opportunities will you go after and why?]

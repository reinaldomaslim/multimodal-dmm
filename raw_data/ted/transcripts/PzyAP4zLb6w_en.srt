0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The decorative use of wire in southern Africa

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
dates back hundreds of years.

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But modernization actually brought communication

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and a whole new material, in the form of telephone wire.

5
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Rural to urban migration meant that newfound industrial materials

6
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
started to replace hard-to-come-by natural grasses.

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So, here you can see the change

8
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
from use -- starting to use contemporary materials.

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
These pieces date back from the '40s to the late '50s.

10
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
In the '90s, my interest and passion for transitional art forms

11
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
led me to a new form,

12
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
which came from a squatter camp outside Durban.

13
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And I got the opportunity to start working with this community

14
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
at that point, and started developing, really,

15
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and mentoring them in terms of scale, in terms of the design.

16
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And the project soon grew from five to 50 weavers in about a year.

17
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Soon we had outgrown the scrap yards, what they could provide,

18
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
so we coerced a wire manufacturer to help us,

19
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and not only to supply the materials on bobbins,

20
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but to produce to our color specifications.

21
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
At the same time, I was thinking, well,

22
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
there's lots of possibility here to produce contemporary products,

23
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
away from the ethnic, a little bit more contemporary.

24
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So I developed a whole range around -- mass-produced range --

25
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that obviously fitted into a much higher-end decor market

26
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that could be exported and also service our local market.

27
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We started experimenting, as you can see, in terms of shapes,

28
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
forms. The scale became very important,

29
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and it's become our pet project. It's successful,

30
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
it's been running for 12 years. And we supply the Conran shops,

31
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
and Donna Karan, and so it's kind of great.

32
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This is our group, our main group of weavers.

33
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
They come on a weekly basis to Durban.

34
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
They all have bank accounts.

35
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They've all moved back to the rural area where they came from.

36
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It's a weekly turnaround of production.

37
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is the community that I originally showed you the slide of.

38
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And that's also modernized today,

39
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and it's supporting work for 300 weavers.

40
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And the rest says it all.

41
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Thank you very much.

42
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000

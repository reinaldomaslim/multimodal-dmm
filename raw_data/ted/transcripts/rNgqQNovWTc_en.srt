1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's not about technology,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
it's about people and stories.

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I could show you

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
what recently was on television

5
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
as a high quality video:

6
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
60 Minutes, many of you may have seen it.

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And it was the now director of the entire piece

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
of the veteran's administration --

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
who, himself, had lost an arm 39 years ago

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in Vietnam --

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
who was adamantly opposed to these crazy devices

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that don't work.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And it turns out that with 60 Minutes cameras rolling in the background,

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
after he pretty much made his position clear on this --

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
he had his hook and he had his --

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
he wore this arm for less than two hours

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
and was able to pour himself a drink and got quite emotional over the fact

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that, quote -- his quote --

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
it's the first time he's felt like he's had an arm in 39 years.

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But that would sort of be jumping to the middle of the story,

21
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and I'm not going to show you that polished video.

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I'm going to, instead, in a minute or two,

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
show you an early, crude video

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
because I think it's

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
a better way to tell a story.

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
A few years ago I was visited by

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
the guy that runs DARPA,

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the people that fund all the advanced technologies

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
that businesses and universities probably wouldn't take the risk of doing.

30
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
They have a particular interest in ones that will help our soldiers.

31
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I get this sort of unrequested -- by me anyway -- visit,

32
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and sitting in my conference room is a very senior surgeon

33
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
from the military

34
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and the guy that runs DARPA.

35
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
They proceed to tell me a story which comes down

36
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
to basically the following. We have used such advanced technologies

37
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
now and made them available

38
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
in the most remote places that we put soldiers:

39
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
hills of Afghanistan, Iraq ...

40
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
They were quite proud of the fact that

41
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
you know, before the dust clears,

42
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
if some soldier has been hurt

43
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
they will have collected him or her, they will have brought him back,

44
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
they will be getting world-class triage emergency care

45
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
faster than you and I would be getting it if we were hurt

46
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in a car accident in a major city in the United States.

47
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
That's the good news.

48
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The bad news is if they've collected this person

49
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and he or she is missing an arm or leg,

50
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
part of the face, it's probably not coming back.

51
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
So, they started giving me the statistics on how many of these kids had lost an arm.

52
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And then the surgeon pointed out, with a lot of anger,

53
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
he said, "Why is it? At the end of the Civil War,

54
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
they were shooting each other with muskets. If somebody lost an arm,

55
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
we gave them a wooden stick with a hook on it.

56
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Now we've got F18s and F22s,

57
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and if somebody loses an arm,

58
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
we give them a plastic stick with a hook on it."

59
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And they basically said, "This is unacceptable,"

60
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and then the punchline: "So, Dean,

61
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we're here because you make medical stuff.

62
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
You're going to give us an arm."

63
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I was waiting for the 500 pages of bureaucracy,

64
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
paperwork and DODs.

65
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
No, the guy says,

66
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
"We're going to bring a guy into this conference room,

67
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and wearing the arm you're going to give us,

68
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
he or she is going to pick up a raisin or a grape

69
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
off this table.

70
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
If it's the grape, they won't break it."

71
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Great he needs efferent, afferent, haptic response sensors.

72
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"If it's the raisin, they won't drop it."

73
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So he wants fine motor control: flex at the wrist,

74
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
flex at the elbow, abduct and flex at the shoulder.

75
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Either way they were going to eat it.

76
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
"Oh, by the way Dean. It's going to fit on a 50th percentile female frame --

77
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
namely 32 inches from the long finger --

78
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and weigh less than nine pounds."

79
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
50th percentile female frame.

80
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
"And it's going to be completely self contained including all its power."

81
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So, they finished that. And I, as you can tell,

82
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
am a bashful guy.

83
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I told them they're nuts.

84
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
They've been watching too much "Terminator."

86
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Laughter)

87
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Then, the surgeon says to me,

88
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
"Dean, you need to know

89
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
more than two dozen of these kids have come back

90
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
bilateral."

91
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Now, I cannot imagine --

92
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I'm sorry, you may have a better

93
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
imagination than I do --

94
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I can't imagine losing my arm,

95
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
and typically at 22 years old.

96
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But compared to that, losing two?

97
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Seems like that would be an inconvenience.

98
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Anyway, I went home that night. I thought about it.

99
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I literally could not sleep

100
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
thinking about, "I wonder how you'd roll over

101
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
with no shoulders."

102
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So, I decided we've got to do this.

103
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And trust me, I've got a day job, I've got a lot of day jobs.

104
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Most of my day job keeps me busy

105
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
funding my fantasies like FIRST and water and power ....

106
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And I've got a lot of day jobs.

107
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But I figured I gotta do this.

108
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Did a little investigation,

109
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
went down to Washington, told them

110
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I still think they're nuts but we're going to do it.

111
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And I told them I'd build them an arm.

112
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I told them it would probably take five years to get through the FDA,

113
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and probably 10 years to be reasonably functional.

114
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Look what it takes to make things like iPods.

115
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
"Great," he said, "You got two years."

116
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I said, "I'll tell you what. I'll build you an arm

118
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
that's under nine pounds

119
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that has all that capability in one year.

120
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It will take the other nine to make it functional and useful."

121
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We sort of agreed to disagree.

122
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I went back and I started putting a team together,

123
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
the best guys I could find with a passion to do this.

124
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
At the end of exactly one year

125
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
we had a device with 14 degrees of freedom,

126
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
all the sensors, all the microprocessors,

127
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
all the stuff inside.

128
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I could show you it with a cosmesis on it

129
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that's so real it's eerie, but then you wouldn't see

130
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
all this cool stuff.

131
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I then thought it would be years

132
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
before we'd be able to make it really, really useful.

133
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It turned out, as I think you could see

134
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in Aimee's capabilities and attitudes,

135
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
people with a desire to do something

136
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
are quite remarkable and nature is quite adaptable.

137
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Anyway, with less than 10 hours of use,

138
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
two guys -- one that's bilateral.

139
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
He's literally, he's got no shoulder on one side,

140
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and he's high trans-humeral on the other.

141
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And that's Chuck and Randy together,

142
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
after 10 hours -- were playing in our office.

143
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And we took some pretty cruddy home movies.

144
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
At the end of the one I'm going to show, it's only about a minute

145
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and a couple of seconds long,

146
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Chuck does something that to this day I'm jealous of,

147
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I can't do it.

148
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
He picks up a spoon, picks it up,

149
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
scoops out some Shredded Wheat and milk,

150
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
holds the spoon level

151
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
as he translates it, moving all these joints simultaneously,

152
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
to his mouth, and he doesn't drop any milk.

153
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I cannot do that.

155
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

156
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
His wife was standing behind me.

157
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
She's standing behind me at the time

158
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and she says, "Dean,

159
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Chuck hasn't fed himself in 19 years.

160
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So, you've got a choice:

161
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We keep the arm, or you keep Chuck."

162
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

163
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So, can we see that?

164
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
This is Chuck showing simultaneous control

165
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of all the joints.

166
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
He's punching our controls guy. The guy behind him

167
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
is our engineer/surgeon,

168
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
which is a convenient guy to have around.

169
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
There's Randy, these guys are passing a rubber

170
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
little puck between them.

171
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And just as in the spirit of FIRST,

172
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
gracious professionalism, they are quite proud of this,

173
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
so they decide to share a drink.

174
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
This is a non-trivial thing to do, by the way.

175
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Imagine doing that with a wooden stick and a hook on the end of it,

176
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
doing either of those.

177
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now Chuck is doing something quite extraordinary,

178
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
at least for my limited physical skill.

179
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And now he's going to do what DARPA asked me for.

180
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
He's going to pick up a grape -- he didn't drop it,

181
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
he didn't break it --

182
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and he's going to eat it.

183
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So, that's where we were

184
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
at the end of about 15 months.

185
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Applause)

186
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But, as I've learned from Richard,

187
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
the technology, the processors, the sensors, the motors,

188
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
is not the story.

189
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I hadn't dealt with this kind of problem

190
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
or frankly, this whole segment

191
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
of the medical world.

192
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I'll give you some astounding things that have happened

193
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
as we started this.

194
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
After we were pretty much convinced we had a good design,

195
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and we'd have to make all the standard engineering trade-offs you always make --

196
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
you can always get three out of four of anything you want;

197
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
the weight, the size, the cost, the functionality --

198
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I put a bunch of guys in my plane

199
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and I said, "We're flying down to Walter Reed, and we're going talk to these kids,

200
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
because frankly it doesn't matter whether we like this arm.

201
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It doesn't matter whether the

202
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Department of Defense likes this arm."

203
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
When I told them that they weren't entirely enthusiastic,

204
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but I told them, "It really doesn't matter what their opinion is.

205
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
There is only one opinion that matters,

206
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
the kids that are either going to use it or not."

207
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I told a bunch of my engineers, "Look we're going to walk into Walter Reed,

208
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and you're going to see people, lots of them,

209
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
missing major body parts.

210
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
They're probably going to be angry, depressed, frustrated.

211
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
We're probably going to have to give them support, encouragement.

212
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But we've got to extract from them

213
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
enough information to make sure we're doing the right thing."

214
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We walked into Walter Reed and I could not have been more wrong.

215
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
We did see a bunch of people,

216
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
a lot of them missing a lot of body parts,

217
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and parts they had left were burned;

218
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
half a face gone, an ear burned off.

219
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
They were sitting at a table. They were brought together for us.

220
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And we started asking them all questions.

221
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
"Look," I'd say to them, "We're not quite as good as nature yet.

222
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
I could give you fine motor control,

223
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
or I could let you curl 40 pounds;

224
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I probably can't do both.

225
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I can give you fast control

226
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
with low reduction ratios in these gears,

227
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
or I can give you power;

228
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
I can't give you both.

229
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And we were trying to get them to all help us

230
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
know what to give them.

231
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Not only were they enthusiastic, they kept thinking

232
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
they're there to help us.

233
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
"Well, would it help if I ..."

234
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
"Guys, and woman,

235
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
you've given enough.

236
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
We're here to help you. We need data. We need to know

237
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
what you need."

238
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
After a half an hour, maybe, there was one guy at the far end of the table

239
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
who wasn't saying much.

240
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
You could see he was missing an arm.

241
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
He was leaning on his other arm.

242
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I called down to the end, "Hey, you haven't said much.

243
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
If we needed this or this, what would you want?"

244
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And he said, "You know,

245
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
I'm the lucky guy at this table.

246
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I lost my right arm,

247
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
but I'm a lefty."

248
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
(Laughter)

249
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So, he wouldn't say much.

250
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
He had a great spirit, like all the rest of them had great spirits.

251
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And he made a few comments.

252
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And then the meeting ended. We said goodbye to all these guys.

253
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And that guy pushed himself back from the table ...

254
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
he has no legs.

255
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So, we left.

256
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And I was thinking,

257
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
"We didn't give them support and encouragement;

258
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
they gave it to us.

259
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
They're not finished giving yet."

260
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
It was astounding.

261
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
So, we went back.

262
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And I started working harder, faster.

263
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Then we went out to Brooke Army Medical Center.

264
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And we saw lots of these kids, lots of them.

265
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And it was astounding

266
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
how positive they are.

267
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
So, we went back,

268
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and we've been working harder yet.

269
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We're in clinical trials,

270
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
we've got five of them on people.

271
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We're screaming along.

272
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And I get a call and we go back

273
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to Washington.

274
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
We go back to Walter Reed,

275
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and a kid, literally,

276
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
20 some-odd days before that

277
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
was blown up.

278
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And they shipped him to Germany

279
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and 24 hours later they shipped him from Germany

280
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
to Walter Reed.

281
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
And he was there,

282
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and they said we needed to come.

283
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And I went down

284
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and they rolled him into a room.

285
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
He's got no legs.

286
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
He's got no arms.

287
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
He's got a small residual limb on one side.

288
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Half of his face is gone,

289
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
but they said his vision is coming back.

290
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
He had one good eye.

291
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
His name is Brandon Marrocco.

292
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And he said,

293
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
"I need your arms,

294
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
but I need two of them."

295
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
"You'll get them."

296
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
This kid was from Staten Island.

297
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And he said, "I had a truck,

298
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
before I went over there,

299
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
and it had a stick.

300
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
You think I'll be able to drive it?"

301
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
"Sure."

302
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And I turned around and went, "How are we going to do this?"

303
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Laughter)

304
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Anyway, he was just like all the rest of them.

305
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
He doesn't really want a lot.

306
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
He wants to help. He told me that

307
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
he wanted to go back

308
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
to help his buddies.

309
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So, I was on my way out here.

310
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
I was asked to stop at Texas.

311
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
There were 3,500 people,

312
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
the Veteran's Administration,

313
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
U.S. ... just 3,500 at this huge event

314
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
to help the families

315
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
of all the kids --

316
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
some that have died, some that are

317
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
like Brandon --

318
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and they wanted me to speak.

319
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
I said, "What am I going to say?

320
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
This is not a happy thing. Look, if this happens to you,

321
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
I can give you ... This stuff is

322
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
still not as good at the original equipment."

323
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
"You need to come."

324
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So, I went.

325
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And, as I think you get the point,

326
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
there were a lot people there recovering.

327
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
Some further along than others.

328
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
But universally, these people that had been through this

329
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
had astounding attitudes,

330
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and just the fact that people care

331
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
makes a huge difference to them.

332
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
I'll shut up, except one message

333
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
or concern I have.

334
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
I don't think anybody does it intentionally,

335
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
but there were people there literally talking about,

336
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
"Well, how much will they get?"

337
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
You know, this country is involved as we've all heard,

338
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
in this great healthcare debate.

339
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
"Who is entitled to what?

340
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
Who is entitled to how much?

341
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Who is going to pay for it?"

342
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Those are tough questions.

343
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
I don't have an answer to that. Not everybody

344
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
can be entitled to everything simply because you were born here.

345
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
It's not possible. It would be nice

346
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
but let's be realistic.

347
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
They were tough questions. There's polarized groups down there.

348
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
I don't know the answers.

349
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
There are other questions that are tough.

350
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
"Should we be there?

351
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
How do we get out?

352
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
What do we need to do?" There's very polarized

353
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
answers to that question too,

354
0:17:14.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and I don't have any answers to that.

355
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Those are political questions, economic questions,

356
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
strategic questions.

357
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
I don't have the answer. But let me give you a simple

358
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
concern or maybe statement, then.

359
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
It is an easy answer.

360
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
I know what these kids deserve

361
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
on the healthcare side.

362
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
I was talking to one of them,

363
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
and he was really liking this arm --

364
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
it's way, way, way better than a plastic

365
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
stick with a hook on it --

366
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
but there's nobody in this room that would rather have that

367
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
than the one you got.

368
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
But I was saying to him, "You know,

369
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
the first airplane

370
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
went 100 feet in 1903.

371
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
Wilbur and Orville.

372
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
But you know what? It wouldn't have made an old pigeon jealous.

373
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
But now we got Eagles out there,

374
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
F15s, even that Bald Eagle.

375
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
I've never seen a bird flying around at Mach 2.

376
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
I think eventually we'll make these things extraordinary."

377
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:3,000
And I said to that kid,

378
0:18:30.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
"I'll stop when your buddies

379
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
are envious of your Luke arm

380
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:4,000
because of what it can do, and how it does it.

381
0:18:40.26,000 --> 0:18:43,000
And we'll keep working. And I'm not going to stop working

382
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
until we do that."

383
0:18:46.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
And I think this country

384
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:51,000
ought to continue its great debate,

385
0:18:51.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
whining and complaining, "I'm entitled." "You're a victim."

386
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:58,000
And whining and complaining about what our foreign policy ought to be.

387
0:18:58.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
But while we have the luxury of whining and complaining about

388
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:04,000
who's paying for what and how much we get,

389
0:19:04.26,000 --> 0:19:06,000
the people that are out there

390
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
giving us that great privilege of whining and complaining,

391
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
I know what they deserve:

392
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:13,000
everything humanly possible.

393
0:19:13.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
And we ought to give it to them.

394
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
(Applause)

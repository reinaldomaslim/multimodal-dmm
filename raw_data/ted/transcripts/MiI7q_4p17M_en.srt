0:00:13.333,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Piano)

2
0:00:29.939,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Singing) It was done

3
0:00:32.86,000 --> 0:00:35,000
When the benediction had been sung

4
0:00:38.415,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Firelight gently woke us from our golden night

5
0:00:47.111,000 --> 0:00:48,000
My surprise

6
0:00:49.94,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I can turn to see your open eyes

7
0:00:54.681,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I know You are alive

8
0:01:01.576,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I know that smile

9
0:01:05.306,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Nothing more

10
0:01:09.718,000 --> 0:01:12,000
In the after

11
0:01:13.197,000 --> 0:01:16,000
There is waking from your sleep

12
0:01:16.998,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And your lover

13
0:01:20.95,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Is the only face you see

14
0:01:24.755,000 --> 0:01:27,000
We are after

15
0:01:28.449,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Ever after

16
0:01:32.178,000 --> 0:01:34,000
There is laughter

17
0:01:35.529,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Afterneath

18
0:01:56.413,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The war

19
0:01:59.131,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Nobody ever even asked what for

20
0:02:04.694,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Up above

21
0:02:07.508,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Nothing matters but the ones you love

22
0:02:12.075,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So get out with me

23
0:02:14.992,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Now you've got enough with me

24
0:02:18.814,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Just the two of us you see

25
0:02:22.805,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And nothing more

26
0:02:27.164,000 --> 0:02:3,000
In the after

27
0:02:30.98,000 --> 0:02:33,000
There is waking from your sleep

28
0:02:34.738,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And your lover

29
0:02:38.409,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Is the only face you see

30
0:02:42.127,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We are after

31
0:02:45.755,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Ever after

32
0:02:49.509,000 --> 0:02:55,000
There is laughter Afterneath

33
0:02:56.234,000 --> 0:03:,000
Oh, we after

34
0:03:00.674,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Ever after

35
0:03:04.461,000 --> 0:03:06,000
There is laughter

36
0:03:07.42,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Afterneath

37
0:03:14.062,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Oh

38
0:03:22.571,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Oh

39
0:03:30.914,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Oh

40
0:03:39.482,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Oh

41
0:03:49.944,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Thank you.

42
0:03:51.15,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Applause)

43
0:03:55.326,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Thank you very much.

44
0:03:56.501,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Applause)

45
0:03:58.401,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Thanks.

46
0:04:00.363,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I love a depressing song ...

47
0:04:02.805,000 --> 0:04:03,000
(Laughter)

48
0:04:03.83,000 --> 0:04:04,000
you know?

49
0:04:05.005,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I've been writing them for 15 years now,

50
0:04:07.418,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and to be honest, over that time,

51
0:04:10.448,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I've come to kind of believe that they're not really depressing at all.

52
0:04:14.196,000 --> 0:04:17,000
In fact, I think they're kind of the most important songs we have.

53
0:04:18.317,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Songs that sing of sorrow,

54
0:04:21.465,000 --> 0:04:22,000
of grief,

55
0:04:22.64,000 --> 0:04:23,000
of longing,

56
0:04:24.022,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of the darker side of love,

57
0:04:26.21,000 --> 0:04:28,000
the underside of being alive,

58
0:04:28.665,000 --> 0:04:3,000
these are the songs I just never tire of hearing

59
0:04:31.531,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and I never tire of writing,

60
0:04:33.766,000 --> 0:04:35,000
because they make me feel less alone.

61
0:04:36.973,000 --> 0:04:39,000
They speak to a very real part of being human

62
0:04:40.322,000 --> 0:04:42,000
that can often be hidden in fear and shame

63
0:04:42.967,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and pushed deep down where it lingers and rots.

64
0:04:46.318,000 --> 0:04:48,000
But I think in listening to these songs --

65
0:04:48.521,000 --> 0:04:5,000
really listening --

66
0:04:50.624,000 --> 0:04:54,000
can allow us to refeel these hard emotions,

67
0:04:55.038,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but in a cathartic and healing way.

68
0:04:57.999,000 --> 0:05:02,000
In a way that reminds us, as we listen, that we're not alone in darkness.

69
0:05:04.676,000 --> 0:05:08,000
There's a Japanese phrase known as "mono no aware,"

70
0:05:09.443,000 --> 0:05:13,000
which roughly translates as "the bittersweet poignancy of things,"

71
0:05:14.262,000 --> 0:05:17,000
or the pathos or "ahness" of things.

72
0:05:18.428,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It's a valuable awareness of impermanence,

73
0:05:22.324,000 --> 0:05:27,000
both a kind of gentle, transient sadness as things pass by in life,

74
0:05:27.367,000 --> 0:05:31,000
but also a deeper, softly lingering sadness

75
0:05:32.055,000 --> 0:05:34,000
about the impermanence of all reality.

76
0:05:34.939,000 --> 0:05:38,000
"Mono no aware" can be manifest in lots of life stories and moments

77
0:05:39.949,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and songs.

78
0:05:41.162,000 --> 0:05:45,000
One example in Japanese culture is the celebration of the cherry blossom.

79
0:05:46.262,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The cherry blossom in and of itself is no more impressive

80
0:05:49.382,000 --> 0:05:52,000
than that of an apple or orange tree,

81
0:05:52.494,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but what sets it apart is its brevity.

82
0:05:55.564,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Cherry blossoms fall within a single week --

83
0:05:58.413,000 --> 0:06:,000
can be whisked away on the gentlest breeze --

84
0:06:01.686,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and it's this that makes it more beautiful.

85
0:06:04.536,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It's utterly fragile,

86
0:06:06.377,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and fragility gives life its poignancy.

87
0:06:09.918,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Now, being a cheery chap,

88
0:06:11.274,000 --> 0:06:13,000
nothing speaks to me more than this, and --

89
0:06:14.116,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

90
0:06:15.402,000 --> 0:06:19,000
you know, I think it's been the essence of my songwriting for years,

91
0:06:19.819,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of what moves me to write,

92
0:06:21.655,000 --> 0:06:22,000
what inspires me to sing.

93
0:06:24.052,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Because pain and grief and doubt,

94
0:06:27.258,000 --> 0:06:3,000
when it's made manifest in music, in song --

95
0:06:30.814,000 --> 0:06:33,000
when it's made beautiful in poetry and painting,

96
0:06:36.097,000 --> 0:06:38,000
it can build a community and a kinship

97
0:06:38.668,000 --> 0:06:41,000
in the knowledge that we are none of us alone in darkness.

98
0:06:43.243,000 --> 0:06:47,000
My next song is one that I call "Killing Me,"

99
0:06:47.544,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and as the name suggests,

100
0:06:48.766,000 --> 0:06:49,000
it's not a dance floor favorite.

101
0:06:50.633,000 --> 0:06:51,000
(Laughter)

102
0:06:51.658,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But it isn't miserable.

103
0:06:55.073,000 --> 0:06:57,000
It's full of love and hope.

104
0:06:57.176,000 --> 0:07:,000
And I think it exemplifies everything I've been talking about.

105
0:07:00.192,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And it's the first song I've written from the perspective of somebody else,

106
0:07:04.722,000 --> 0:07:06,000
specifically my grandmother,

107
0:07:07.191,000 --> 0:07:09,000
as she lives on without my late grandfather,

108
0:07:10.412,000 --> 0:07:12,000
as she experiences new things in her life --

109
0:07:13.51,000 --> 0:07:15,000
her grandchildren getting married,

110
0:07:16.179,000 --> 0:07:17,000
having their own children,

111
0:07:17.804,000 --> 0:07:18,000
speaking at TED --

112
0:07:20.358,000 --> 0:07:21,000
all the while she lives without,

113
0:07:21.91,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and all the while she misses her soul mate.

114
0:07:24.851,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Thank you.

115
0:07:31.495,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Piano)

116
0:07:45.083,000 --> 0:07:49,000
(Singing) Sweetheart would you wake up today?

117
0:07:52.12,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I promise you would recognize my faith

118
0:07:58.776,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I want to show you how I've grown in this place

119
0:08:05.825,000 --> 0:08:08,000
In this place I'm not alone

120
0:08:09.542,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And I know I'll be OK

121
0:08:13.248,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But it's always harder When the winter comes to stay

122
0:08:20.082,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And I can't help remember all the words I never said

123
0:08:30.87,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And it's killing me That you're not here with me

124
0:08:37.409,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I'm living happily

125
0:08:40.862,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But I'm feeling guilty

126
0:08:45.429,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And you won't believe The wonders I can see

127
0:08:51.899,000 --> 0:08:54,000
This world is changing me

128
0:08:55.689,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But I will love you faithfully.

129
0:09:00.571,000 --> 0:09:05,000
(Piano)

130
0:09:07.477,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Oh, everything is taller these days

131
0:09:14.37,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Maybe I feel smaller and time rushes away

132
0:09:21.56,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So much I could show you

133
0:09:25.006,000 --> 0:09:28,000
How all the great-grandchildren

134
0:09:28.262,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Have been laughing like we did when we were young

135
0:09:35.36,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I've been laughing like we did when we were young

136
0:09:42.782,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Oh, it's killing me that you're not here with me

137
0:09:49.283,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I'm living happily

138
0:09:52.644,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But I'm feeling guilty

139
0:09:57.023,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Oh, you won't believe The wonders I can see

140
0:10:03.394,000 --> 0:10:06,000
This world is changing me

141
0:10:06.894,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I will love you faithfully

142
0:10:11.992,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Oh

143
0:10:17.283,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Oh

144
0:10:26.19,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Oh

145
0:10:31.44,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Oh

146
0:10:38.472,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Oh, it's killing me

147
0:10:42.272,000 --> 0:10:45,000
That you're not here with me

148
0:10:45.868,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I'm living happily

149
0:10:49.217,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But I'm feeling guilty

150
0:10:53.645,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Oh, you won't believe The wonders I can see

151
0:10:59.94,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This world is changing me

152
0:11:03.475,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I will love you faithfully

153
0:11:07.956,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Oh, it's killing me

154
0:11:11.007,000 --> 0:11:14,000
That you're not here with me

155
0:11:14.506,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I'm living happily

156
0:11:17.899,000 --> 0:11:2,000
But I'm feeling guilty

157
0:11:22.675,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Oh, you won't believe The wonders I can see

158
0:11:29.914,000 --> 0:11:33,000
This world is changing me

159
0:11:33.957,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But I will love you faithfully

160
0:11:41.467,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Thank you very much.

161
0:11:42.711,000 --> 0:11:46,000
(Applause and cheering)

1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I’d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa --

2
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:36,000
those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid.

3
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And, of course, I’m dedicating it also to my grandmother,

4
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:45,000
whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles,

5
0:00:45,000 --> 0:00:51,000
especially for me when I was an activist, and being harassed by the police.

6
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:56,000
You will recall that in 1976, June 16, the students of South Africa boycotted

7
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:,000
the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor,

8
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:03,000
as they were sort of like really told

9
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that they must do everything in Afrikaans --

10
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:1,000
biology, mathematics -- and what about our languages?

11
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And the students wanted to speak to the government,

12
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and police answered with bullets.

13
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
So every year, June 16, we will commemorate

14
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:22,000
all those comrades or students who died.

15
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And I was very young then. I think I was 11 years,

16
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and I started asking questions,

17
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and that’s when my political education started.

18
0:01:33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I joined, later on, the youth organization

19
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:39,000
under the African National Congress.

20
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So as part of organizing this and whatever,

21
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:45,000
this commemoration, the police will round us up

22
0:01:45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
as they call us leaders.

23
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And I used to run away from home,

24
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
when I know that maybe the police might be coming

25
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:56,000
around the ninth or 10th of June or so.

26
0:01:56,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And my grandmother one time said,

27
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"No, look, you’re not going to run away.

28
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This is your place, you stay here."

29
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And indeed, the police came -- because they’ll just arrest us

30
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like, after the 20th or so.

31
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:19,000
So it was on the 10th of June, and they came, and they surrounded the house,

32
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house,

33
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and opened the kitchen door.

34
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And she said to them, "Vusi's here, and you're not going to take him tonight.

35
0:02:33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I'm tired of you having to come here, harassing us,

36
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes.

37
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
He is here, and you're not going to take him.

38
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I've got a bowl full of boiling water -- the first one who comes in here, gets it."

39
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And they left.

40
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Applause) (Music)

41
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:29,000

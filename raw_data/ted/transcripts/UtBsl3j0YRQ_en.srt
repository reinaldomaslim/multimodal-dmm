1
0:00:12.496,000 --> 0:00:15,000
There is something you know about me,

2
0:00:16.255,000 --> 0:00:19,000
something very personal,

3
0:00:20.095,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and there is something I know about every one of you

4
0:00:24.55,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and that's very central to your concerns.

5
0:00:28.663,000 --> 0:00:3,000
There is something that we know

6
0:00:31.268,000 --> 0:00:37,000
about everyone we meet anywhere in the world, on the street,

7
0:00:37.326,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that is the very mainspring of whatever they do

8
0:00:42.304,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and whatever they put up with.

9
0:00:46.047,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And that is that all of us want to be happy.

10
0:00:52.341,000 --> 0:00:54,000
In this, we are all together.

11
0:00:55.203,000 --> 0:01:,000
How we imagine our happiness, that differs from one another,

12
0:01:00.701,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but it's already a lot that we have all in common,

13
0:01:05.529,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that we want to be happy.

14
0:01:09.164,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now my topic is gratefulness.

15
0:01:12.612,000 --> 0:01:17,000
What is the connection between happiness and gratefulness?

16
0:01:19.31,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Many people would say, well, that's very easy.

17
0:01:22.328,000 --> 0:01:24,000
When you are happy, you are grateful.

18
0:01:26.331,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But think again.

19
0:01:29.688,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Is it really the happy people that are grateful?

20
0:01:35.077,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We all know quite a number of people

21
0:01:38.642,000 --> 0:01:42,000
who have everything that it would take to be happy,

22
0:01:42.843,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and they are not happy,

23
0:01:44.624,000 --> 0:01:47,000
because they want something else or they want more of the same.

24
0:01:50.173,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And we all know people who have lots of misfortune,

25
0:01:57.021,000 --> 0:02:,000
misfortune that we ourselves would not want to have,

26
0:02:00.822,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and they are deeply happy.

27
0:02:03.574,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They radiate happiness. You are surprised.

28
0:02:07.017,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Why? Because they are grateful.

29
0:02:10.348,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So it is not happiness that makes us grateful.

30
0:02:14.407,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's gratefulness that makes us happy.

31
0:02:17.835,000 --> 0:02:19,000
If you think it's happiness that makes you grateful,

32
0:02:20.776,000 --> 0:02:21,000
think again.

33
0:02:22.285,000 --> 0:02:24,000
It's gratefulness that makes you happy.

34
0:02:26.293,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Now, we can ask,

35
0:02:28.805,000 --> 0:02:31,000
what do we really mean by gratefulness?

36
0:02:32.897,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And how does it work?

37
0:02:37.985,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I appeal to your own experience.

38
0:02:39.975,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We all know from experience how it goes.

39
0:02:43.055,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We experience something that's valuable to us.

40
0:02:48.734,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Something is given to us that's valuable to us.

41
0:02:53.925,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And it's really given.

42
0:02:55.871,000 --> 0:02:57,000
These two things have to come together.

43
0:02:58.114,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It has to be something valuable, and it's a real gift.

44
0:03:03.727,000 --> 0:03:06,000
You haven't bought it. You haven't earned it.

45
0:03:06.894,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You haven't traded it in. You haven't worked for it.

46
0:03:09.369,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's just given to you.

47
0:03:10.821,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And when these two things come together,

48
0:03:13.088,000 --> 0:03:18,000
something that's really valuable to me and I realize it's freely given,

49
0:03:18.737,000 --> 0:03:22,000
then gratefulness spontaneously rises in my heart,

50
0:03:23.674,000 --> 0:03:26,000
happiness spontaneously rises in my heart.

51
0:03:28.037,000 --> 0:03:3,000
That's how gratefulness happens.

52
0:03:31.546,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now the key to all this

53
0:03:36.965,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is that we cannot only experience this once in a while.

54
0:03:44.997,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We cannot only have grateful experiences.

55
0:03:48.755,000 --> 0:03:51,000
We can be people who live gratefully.

56
0:03:52.649,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Grateful living, that is the thing.

57
0:03:56.216,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And how can we live gratefully?

58
0:04:00.136,000 --> 0:04:04,000
By experiencing, by becoming aware

59
0:04:04.52,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that every moment is a given moment, as we say.

60
0:04:09.293,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It's a gift. You haven't earned it.

61
0:04:11.898,000 --> 0:04:13,000
You haven't brought it about in any way.

62
0:04:14.805,000 --> 0:04:17,000
You have no way of assuring

63
0:04:17.917,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that there will be another moment given to you,

64
0:04:20.917,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and yet, that's the most valuable thing that can ever be given to us,

65
0:04:26.006,000 --> 0:04:31,000
this moment, with all the opportunity that it contains.

66
0:04:31.518,000 --> 0:04:33,000
If we didn't have this present moment,

67
0:04:34.182,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we wouldn't have any opportunity to do anything

68
0:04:37.382,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or experience anything,

69
0:04:39.23,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and this moment is a gift.

70
0:04:41.242,000 --> 0:04:42,000
It's a given moment, as we say.

71
0:04:43.712,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now, we say the gift within this gift is really the opportunity.

72
0:04:50.352,000 --> 0:04:54,000
What you are really grateful for is the opportunity,

73
0:04:54.918,000 --> 0:04:55,000
not the thing that is given to you,

74
0:04:56.876,000 --> 0:04:57,000
because if that thing were somewhere else

75
0:04:58.855,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and you didn't have the opportunity to enjoy it,

76
0:05:02.385,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to do something with it,

77
0:05:04.22,000 --> 0:05:05,000
you wouldn't be grateful for it.

78
0:05:07.149,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Opportunity is the gift within every gift,

79
0:05:11.169,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and we have this saying, opportunity knocks only once.

80
0:05:17.943,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Well, think again.

81
0:05:20.679,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Every moment is a new gift, over and over again,

82
0:05:24.89,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and if you miss the opportunity of this moment,

83
0:05:28.158,000 --> 0:05:31,000
another moment is given to us, and another moment.

84
0:05:32.175,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We can avail ourselves of this opportunity,

85
0:05:34.889,000 --> 0:05:35,000
or we can miss it,

86
0:05:36.76,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and if we avail ourselves of the opportunity,

87
0:05:40.694,000 --> 0:05:42,000
it is the key to happiness.

88
0:05:43.511,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Behold the master key to our happiness

89
0:05:46.776,000 --> 0:05:47,000
in our own hands.

90
0:05:48.579,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Moment by moment, we can be grateful for this gift.

91
0:05:53.593,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Does that mean

92
0:05:56.116,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that we can be grateful for everything?

93
0:05:59.629,000 --> 0:06:,000
Certainly not.

94
0:06:01.597,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We cannot be grateful for violence, for war,

95
0:06:06.537,000 --> 0:06:08,000
for oppression, for exploitation.

96
0:06:09.36,000 --> 0:06:11,000
On the personal level, we cannot be grateful

97
0:06:12.123,000 --> 0:06:15,000
for the loss of a friend, for unfaithfulness,

98
0:06:15.424,000 --> 0:06:16,000
for bereavement.

99
0:06:18.733,000 --> 0:06:21,000
But I didn't say we can be grateful for everything.

100
0:06:22.527,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I said we can be grateful in every given moment

101
0:06:27.033,000 --> 0:06:28,000
for the opportunity,

102
0:06:28.887,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and even when we are confronted with something that is terribly difficult,

103
0:06:35.306,000 --> 0:06:37,000
we can rise to this occasion

104
0:06:37.846,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and respond to the opportunity that is given to us.

105
0:06:42.101,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It isn't as bad as it might seem.

106
0:06:44.476,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Actually, when you look at it and experience it,

107
0:06:48.369,000 --> 0:06:5,000
you find that most of the time,

108
0:06:51.325,000 --> 0:06:54,000
what is given to us is the opportunity to enjoy,

109
0:06:55.058,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and we only miss it because we are rushing through life

110
0:06:58.099,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and we are not stopping to see the opportunity.

111
0:07:01.919,000 --> 0:07:02,000
But once in a while,

112
0:07:03.35,000 --> 0:07:05,000
something very difficult is given to us,

113
0:07:06.296,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and when this difficult thing occurs to us,

114
0:07:10.387,000 --> 0:07:14,000
it's a challenge to rise to that opportunity,

115
0:07:14.715,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and we can rise to it by learning something

116
0:07:18.135,000 --> 0:07:19,000
which is sometimes painful.

117
0:07:19.876,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Learning patience, for instance.

118
0:07:21.963,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We have been told that the road to peace

119
0:07:24.96,000 --> 0:07:27,000
is not a sprint, but is more like a marathon.

120
0:07:28.728,000 --> 0:07:3,000
That takes patience. That's difficult.

121
0:07:32.439,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It may be to stand up for your opinion, to stand up for your conviction.

122
0:07:39.126,000 --> 0:07:41,000
That's an opportunity that is given to us.

123
0:07:42.314,000 --> 0:07:45,000
To learn, to suffer, to stand up,

124
0:07:45.763,000 --> 0:07:47,000
all these opportunities are given to us,

125
0:07:48.133,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but they are opportunities,

126
0:07:49.639,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and those who avail themselves of those opportunities

127
0:07:53.515,000 --> 0:07:55,000
are the ones that we admire.

128
0:07:55.642,000 --> 0:07:57,000
They make something out of life.

129
0:07:57.914,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And those who fail get another opportunity.

130
0:08:03.023,000 --> 0:08:05,000
We always get another opportunity.

131
0:08:05.24,000 --> 0:08:08,000
That's the wonderful richness of life.

132
0:08:10.272,000 --> 0:08:16,000
So how can we find a method that will harness this?

133
0:08:16.821,000 --> 0:08:21,000
How can each one of us find a method for living gratefully,

134
0:08:21.851,000 --> 0:08:22,000
not just once in a while being grateful,

135
0:08:23.78,000 --> 0:08:25,000
but moment by moment to be grateful.

136
0:08:26.591,000 --> 0:08:29,000
How can we do it? It's a very simple method.

137
0:08:29.967,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It's so simple that it's actually what we were told as children

138
0:08:35.054,000 --> 0:08:37,000
when we learned to cross the street.

139
0:08:37.882,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Stop.

140
0:08:39.421,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Look.

141
0:08:40.646,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Go.

142
0:08:41.871,000 --> 0:08:42,000
That's all.

143
0:08:43.27,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But how often do we stop?

144
0:08:45.982,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We rush through life. We don't stop.

145
0:08:48.751,000 --> 0:08:51,000
We miss the opportunity because we don't stop.

146
0:08:53.012,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We have to stop.

147
0:08:55.883,000 --> 0:08:56,000
We have to get quiet.

148
0:08:58.128,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And we have to build stop signs into our lives.

149
0:09:03.628,000 --> 0:09:07,000
When I was in Africa some years ago and then came back,

150
0:09:08.62,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I noticed water.

151
0:09:11.114,000 --> 0:09:15,000
In Africa where I was, I didn't have drinkable water.

152
0:09:15.293,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Every time I turned on the faucet, I was overwhelmed.

153
0:09:20.067,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Every time I clicked on the light, I was so grateful.

154
0:09:23.676,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It made me so happy.

155
0:09:25.241,000 --> 0:09:26,000
But after a while, this wears off.

156
0:09:27.248,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So I put little stickers on the light switch

157
0:09:31.034,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and on the water faucet,

158
0:09:32.735,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and every time I turned it on, water.

159
0:09:35.817,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So leave it up to your own imagination.

160
0:09:38.697,000 --> 0:09:39,000
You can find whatever works best for you,

161
0:09:40.674,000 --> 0:09:43,000
but you need stop signs in your life.

162
0:09:44.278,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And when you stop,

163
0:09:46.229,000 --> 0:09:48,000
then the next thing is to look.

164
0:09:48.73,000 --> 0:09:5,000
You look. You open your eyes.

165
0:09:50.985,000 --> 0:09:52,000
You open your ears. You open your nose.

166
0:09:53.271,000 --> 0:09:55,000
You open all your senses

167
0:09:55.691,000 --> 0:09:58,000
for this wonderful richness that is given to us.

168
0:09:59.326,000 --> 0:10:02,000
There is no end to it, and that is what life is all about,

169
0:10:03.302,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to enjoy, to enjoy what is given to us.

170
0:10:06.932,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And then we can also open our hearts,

171
0:10:09.775,000 --> 0:10:11,000
our hearts for the opportunities,

172
0:10:12.621,000 --> 0:10:15,000
for the opportunities also to help others,

173
0:10:15.863,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to make others happy,

174
0:10:17.158,000 --> 0:10:21,000
because nothing makes us more happy than when all of us are happy.

175
0:10:22.743,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And when we open our hearts to the opportunities,

176
0:10:26.901,000 --> 0:10:29,000
the opportunities invite us to do something,

177
0:10:30.541,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and that is the third.

178
0:10:31.888,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Stop, look, and then go, and really do something.

179
0:10:36.351,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And what we can do

180
0:10:37.955,000 --> 0:10:41,000
is whatever life offers to you in that present moment.

181
0:10:42.641,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Mostly it's the opportunity to enjoy,

182
0:10:47.708,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but sometimes it's something more difficult.

183
0:10:51.108,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But whatever it is, if we take this opportunity,

184
0:10:55.4,000 --> 0:11:,000
we go with it, we are creative, those are the creative people.

185
0:11:00.871,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And that little stop, look, go,

186
0:11:04.744,000 --> 0:11:06,000
is such a potent seed

187
0:11:06.998,000 --> 0:11:09,000
that it can revolutionize our world.

188
0:11:10.5,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Because we are at the present moment

189
0:11:15.82,000 --> 0:11:18,000
in the middle of a change of consciousness,

190
0:11:19.156,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and you will be surprised if you --

191
0:11:22.002,000 --> 0:11:24,000
I am always surprised when I hear how many times

192
0:11:24.688,000 --> 0:11:26,000
this word "gratefulness" and "gratitude" comes up.

193
0:11:27.952,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Everywhere you find it,

194
0:11:29.29,000 --> 0:11:32,000
a grateful airline, a restaurant gratefulness,

195
0:11:32.569,000 --> 0:11:35,000
a café gratefulness, a wine that is gratefulness.

196
0:11:35.778,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Yes, I have even come across a toilet paper

197
0:11:39.053,000 --> 0:11:41,000
whose brand is called "Thank You."

198
0:11:41.42,000 --> 0:11:42,000
(Laughter)

199
0:11:43.04,000 --> 0:11:44,000
There is a wave of gratefulness

200
0:11:45.006,000 --> 0:11:48,000
because people are becoming aware how important this is

201
0:11:48.812,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and how this can change our world.

202
0:11:51.884,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It can change our world in immensely important ways,

203
0:11:58.524,000 --> 0:12:01,000
because if you're grateful, you're not fearful,

204
0:12:02.135,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and if you're not fearful, you're not violent.

205
0:12:05.521,000 --> 0:12:09,000
If you're grateful, you act out of a sense of enough

206
0:12:09.707,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and not of a sense of scarcity,

207
0:12:11.801,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and you are willing to share.

208
0:12:13.85,000 --> 0:12:14,000
If you are grateful,

209
0:12:15.142,000 --> 0:12:17,000
you are enjoying the differences between people,

210
0:12:18.017,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and you are respectful to everybody,

211
0:12:20.396,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and that changes this power pyramid under which we live.

212
0:12:24.129,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And it doesn't make for equality, but it makes for equal respect,

213
0:12:29.157,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and that is the important thing.

214
0:12:31.161,000 --> 0:12:34,000
The future of the world will be a network,

215
0:12:34.861,000 --> 0:12:37,000
not a pyramid turned upside down.

216
0:12:38.511,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The revolution of which I am speaking is a nonviolent revolution,

217
0:12:43.023,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and it's so revolutionary that it even revolutionizes

218
0:12:46.912,000 --> 0:12:48,000
the very concept of a revolution,

219
0:12:49.093,000 --> 0:12:51,000
because the normal revolution

220
0:12:51.354,000 --> 0:12:53,000
is one where the power pyramid is turned upside down

221
0:12:54.362,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and those who were on the bottom are now on the top

222
0:12:57.531,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and are doing exactly the same thing that the ones before.

223
0:13:02.246,000 --> 0:13:06,000
What we need is a networking of smaller groups,

224
0:13:06.582,000 --> 0:13:09,000
smaller and smaller groups who know one another,

225
0:13:10.252,000 --> 0:13:14,000
who interact with one another, and that is a grateful world.

226
0:13:14.823,000 --> 0:13:18,000
A grateful world is a world of joyful people.

227
0:13:18.971,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Grateful people are joyful people,

228
0:13:21.642,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and joyful people --

229
0:13:23.683,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the more and more joyful people there are,

230
0:13:26.446,000 --> 0:13:29,000
the more and more we'll have a joyful world.

231
0:13:30.758,000 --> 0:13:36,000
We have a network for grateful living, and it has mushroomed.

232
0:13:36.829,000 --> 0:13:38,000
We couldn't understand why it mushroomed.

233
0:13:39.276,000 --> 0:13:42,000
We have an opportunity for people to light a candle

234
0:13:42.612,000 --> 0:13:44,000
when they are grateful for something.

235
0:13:45.217,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And there have been 15 million candles lit in one decade.

236
0:13:52.072,000 --> 0:13:58,000
People are becoming aware that a grateful world is a happy world,

237
0:13:58.297,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and we all have the opportunity by the simple stop, look, go,

238
0:14:04.323,000 --> 0:14:07,000
to transform the world, to make it a happy place.

239
0:14:08.059,000 --> 0:14:09,000
And that is what I hope for us,

240
0:14:09.561,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and if this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same,

241
0:14:14.459,000 --> 0:14:15,000
stop, look, go.

242
0:14:16.121,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Thank you.

243
0:14:17.314,000 --> 0:14:2,000
(Applause)

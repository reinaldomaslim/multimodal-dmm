1
0:00:12.871,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Some days, it feels like the only thing we can agree on

2
0:00:16.627,000 --> 0:00:18,000
is that we can't agree on anything.

3
0:00:20.143,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Public discourse is broken.

4
0:00:23.046,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And we feel that everywhere --

5
0:00:24.784,000 --> 0:00:26,000
panelists on TV are screaming at each other,

6
0:00:27.228,000 --> 0:00:3,000
we go online to find community and connection,

7
0:00:30.721,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and we end up leaving feeling angry and alienated.

8
0:00:34.689,000 --> 0:00:38,000
In everyday life, probably because everyone else is yelling,

9
0:00:38.713,000 --> 0:00:41,000
we are so scared to get into an argument

10
0:00:41.792,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that we're willing not to engage at all.

11
0:00:44.895,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Contempt has replaced conversation.

12
0:00:49.727,000 --> 0:00:53,000
My mission in life is to help us disagree productively.

13
0:00:54.752,000 --> 0:00:58,000
To find ways to bring truth to light, to bring new ideas to life.

14
0:01:00.165,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I think -- I hope --

15
0:01:02.015,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that there is a model for structured disagreement

16
0:01:04.879,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that's kind of mutually respectful

17
0:01:08.212,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and assumes a genuine desire to persuade and be persuaded.

18
0:01:12.974,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And to uncover it, let me take you back a little bit.

19
0:01:16.307,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So, when I was 10 years old, I loved arguing.

20
0:01:21.442,000 --> 0:01:23,000
This, like, tantalizing possibility

21
0:01:23.885,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that you could convince someone of your point of view,

22
0:01:26.884,000 --> 0:01:28,000
just with the power of your words.

23
0:01:30.225,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And perhaps unsurprisingly,

24
0:01:31.734,000 --> 0:01:34,000
my parents and teachers loved this somewhat less.

25
0:01:35.233,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:36.45,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And in much the same way as they decided

27
0:01:38.508,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that four-year-old Julia might benefit from gymnastics to burn off some energy,

28
0:01:42.736,000 --> 0:01:45,000
they decided that I might benefit from joining a debate team.

29
0:01:45.807,000 --> 0:01:48,000
That is, kind of, go somewhere to argue where they were not.

30
0:01:49.442,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:51.445,000 --> 0:01:52,000
For the uninitiated,

32
0:01:53.017,000 --> 0:01:55,000
the premises of formal debate are really straightforward:

33
0:01:55.807,000 --> 0:01:57,000
there's a big idea on the table --

34
0:01:57.88,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that we support civil disobedience, that we favor free trade --

35
0:02:02.355,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and one group of people who speaks in favor of that idea,

36
0:02:05.673,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and one against.

37
0:02:08.665,000 --> 0:02:09,000
My first debate

38
0:02:09.9,000 --> 0:02:11,000
in the cavernous auditorium of Canberra Girls Grammar School

39
0:02:12.871,000 --> 0:02:15,000
was kind of a bundle of all of the worst mistakes

40
0:02:16.03,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that you see on cable news.

41
0:02:18.085,000 --> 0:02:22,000
It felt easier to me to attack the person making the argument

42
0:02:22.449,000 --> 0:02:24,000
rather than the substance of the ideas themselves.

43
0:02:25.792,000 --> 0:02:28,000
When that same person challenged my ideas,

44
0:02:29.117,000 --> 0:02:32,000
it felt terrible, I felt humiliated and ashamed.

45
0:02:33.125,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And it felt to me like the sophisticated response to that

46
0:02:36.768,000 --> 0:02:38,000
was to be as extreme as possible.

47
0:02:40.736,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And despite this very shaky entry into the world of debate, I loved it.

48
0:02:45.538,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I saw the possibility, and over many years worked really hard at it,

49
0:02:50.006,000 --> 0:02:53,000
became really skilled at the technical craft of debate.

50
0:02:54.006,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I went on to win the World Schools Debating Championships three times.

51
0:02:58.053,000 --> 0:03:,000
I know, you're just finding out that this is a thing.

52
0:03:00.625,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

53
0:03:04.157,000 --> 0:03:07,000
But it wasn't until I started coaching debaters,

54
0:03:07.609,000 --> 0:03:1,000
persuaders who are really at the top of their game,

55
0:03:11.093,000 --> 0:03:12,000
that I actually got it.

56
0:03:13.188,000 --> 0:03:17,000
The way that you reach people is by finding common ground.

57
0:03:18.45,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's by separating ideas from identity

58
0:03:21.339,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and being genuinely open to persuasion.

59
0:03:24.927,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Debate is a way to organize conversations about how the world is, could, should be.

60
0:03:32.525,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Or to put it another way,

61
0:03:33.759,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I would love to offer you my experience-backed,

62
0:03:37.052,000 --> 0:03:4,000
evidence-tested guide to talking to your cousin about politics

63
0:03:40.629,000 --> 0:03:42,000
at your next family dinner;

64
0:03:42.657,000 --> 0:03:45,000
reorganizing the way in which your team debates new proposals;

65
0:03:46.522,000 --> 0:03:49,000
thinking about how we change our public conversation.

66
0:03:50.617,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And so, as an entry point into that:

67
0:03:52.776,000 --> 0:03:56,000
debate requires that we engage with the conflicting idea,

68
0:03:57.157,000 --> 0:04:,000
directly, respectfully, face to face.

69
0:04:01.093,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The foundation of debate is rebuttal.

70
0:04:03.608,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The idea that you make a claim and I provide a response,

71
0:04:07.395,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and you respond to my response.

72
0:04:10.022,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Without rebuttal, it's not debate, it's just pontificating.

73
0:04:14.449,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And I had originally imagined that the most successful debaters,

74
0:04:18.925,000 --> 0:04:19,000
really excellent persuaders,

75
0:04:20.853,000 --> 0:04:23,000
must be great at going to extremes.

76
0:04:24.339,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They must have some magical ability to make the polarizing palatable.

77
0:04:31.101,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And it took me a really long time to figure out

78
0:04:34.226,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that the opposite is actually true.

79
0:04:38.014,000 --> 0:04:43,000
People who disagree the most productively start by finding common ground,

80
0:04:43.53,000 --> 0:04:44,000
no matter how narrow it is.

81
0:04:45.53,000 --> 0:04:47,000
They identify the thing that we can all agree on

82
0:04:48.482,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and go from there:

83
0:04:50.141,000 --> 0:04:54,000
the right to an education, equality between all people,

84
0:04:55.001,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the importance of safer communities.

85
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
What they're doing is inviting us

86
0:04:59.783,000 --> 0:05:02,000
into what psychologists call shared reality.

87
0:05:04.263,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And shared reality is the antidote to alternative facts.

88
0:05:10.438,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The conflict, of course, is still there.

89
0:05:13.208,000 --> 0:05:14,000
That's why it's a debate.

90
0:05:15.212,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Shared reality just gives us a platform to start to talk about it.

91
0:05:20.465,000 --> 0:05:23,000
But the trick of debate is that you end up doing it directly,

92
0:05:24.18,000 --> 0:05:26,000
face to face, across the table.

93
0:05:26.656,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And research backs up that that really matters.

94
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Professor Juliana Schroeder at UC Berkeley and her colleagues

95
0:05:34.122,000 --> 0:05:37,000
have research that suggests that listening to someone's voice

96
0:05:38.075,000 --> 0:05:4,000
as they make a controversial argument

97
0:05:40.543,000 --> 0:05:41,000
is literally humanizing.

98
0:05:42.847,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It makes it easier to engage with what that person has to say.

99
0:05:47.617,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So, step away from the keyboards, start conversing.

100
0:05:52.077,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And if we are to expand that notion a little bit,

101
0:05:54.753,000 --> 0:06:,000
nothing is stopping us from pressing pause on a parade of keynote speeches,

102
0:06:01.633,000 --> 0:06:04,000
the sequence of very polite panel discussions,

103
0:06:05.363,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and replacing some of that with a structured debate.

104
0:06:09.03,000 --> 0:06:12,000
All of our conferences could have, at their centerpiece,

105
0:06:12.347,000 --> 0:06:15,000
a debate over the biggest, most controversial ideas in the field.

106
0:06:17.022,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Each of our weekly team meetings could devote 10 minutes

107
0:06:21.091,000 --> 0:06:25,000
to a debate about a proposal to change the way in which that team works.

108
0:06:26.329,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And as innovative ideas go, this one is both easy and free.

109
0:06:31.547,000 --> 0:06:32,000
You could start tomorrow.

110
0:06:33.293,000 --> 0:06:34,000
(Laughter)

111
0:06:34.872,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And once we're inside this shared reality,

112
0:06:37.483,000 --> 0:06:4,000
debate also requires that we separate ideas

113
0:06:41.427,000 --> 0:06:44,000
from the identity of the person discussing them.

114
0:06:45.014,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So in formal debate, nothing is a topic unless it is controversial:

115
0:06:49.419,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that we should raise the voting age, outlaw gambling.

116
0:06:54.575,000 --> 0:06:57,000
But the debaters don't choose their sides.

117
0:06:58.419,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So that's why it makes no sense to do what 10-year-old Julia did.

118
0:07:02.791,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Attacking the identity of the person making the argument is irrelevant,

119
0:07:07.221,000 --> 0:07:08,000
because they didn't choose it.

120
0:07:09.22,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Your only winning strategy

121
0:07:12.656,000 --> 0:07:18,000
is to engage with the best, clearest, least personal version of the idea.

122
0:07:20.292,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And it might sound impossible or naive to imagine

123
0:07:24.197,000 --> 0:07:28,000
that you could ever take that notion outside the high school auditorium.

124
0:07:28.946,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We spend so much time dismissing ideas as democrat or republican.

125
0:07:35.216,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Rejecting proposals because they came from headquarters,

126
0:07:38.942,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or from a region that we think is not like ours.

127
0:07:42.815,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But it is possible.

128
0:07:44.482,000 --> 0:07:48,000
When I work with teams, trying to come up with the next big idea,

129
0:07:48.847,000 --> 0:07:5,000
or solve a really complex problem,

130
0:07:51.395,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I start by asking them, all of them, to submit ideas anonymously.

131
0:07:57.355,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So by way of illustration, two years ago,

132
0:07:59.782,000 --> 0:08:01,000
I was working with multiple government agencies

133
0:08:02.498,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to generate new solutions to reduce long-term unemployment.

134
0:08:06.44,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Which is one of those really wicked,

135
0:08:08.531,000 --> 0:08:11,000
sticky, well-studied public policy problems.

136
0:08:12.543,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So exactly as I described, right at the beginning,

137
0:08:15.141,000 --> 0:08:18,000
potential solutions were captured from everywhere.

138
0:08:18.942,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We aggregated them,

139
0:08:20.8,000 --> 0:08:22,000
each of them was produced on an identical template.

140
0:08:23.458,000 --> 0:08:26,000
At this point, they all look the same, they have no separate identity.

141
0:08:27.252,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And then, of course, they are discussed, picked over,

142
0:08:31.014,000 --> 0:08:32,000
refined, finalized.

143
0:08:33.022,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And at the end of that process, more than 20 of those new ideas

144
0:08:36.799,000 --> 0:08:39,000
are presented to the cabinet ministers responsible for consideration.

145
0:08:41.982,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But more than half of those, the originator of those ideas

146
0:08:47.53,000 --> 0:08:51,000
was someone who might have a hard time getting the ear of a policy advisor.

147
0:08:52.006,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Or who, because of their identity,

148
0:08:53.835,000 --> 0:08:56,000
might not be taken entirely seriously if they did.

149
0:08:57.379,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Folks who answer the phones, assistants who manage calendars,

150
0:09:01.482,000 --> 0:09:04,000
representatives from agencies who weren't always trusted.

151
0:09:07.371,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Imagine if our news media did the same thing.

152
0:09:09.601,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You can kind of see it now -- a weekly cable news segment

153
0:09:13.313,000 --> 0:09:15,000
with a big policy proposal on the table

154
0:09:15.992,000 --> 0:09:18,000
that doesn't call it liberal or conservative.

155
0:09:19.766,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Or a series of op-eds for and against a big idea

156
0:09:25.125,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that don't tell you where the writers worked.

157
0:09:28.703,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Our public conversations, even our private disagreements,

158
0:09:32.41,000 --> 0:09:37,000
can be transformed by debating ideas, rather than discussing identity.

159
0:09:40.041,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And then, the thing that debate allows us to do as human beings

160
0:09:43.693,000 --> 0:09:46,000
is open ourselves, really open ourselves up

161
0:09:47.581,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to the possibility that we might be wrong.

162
0:09:50.605,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The humility of uncertainty.

163
0:09:54.375,000 --> 0:09:58,000
One of the reasons it is so hard to disagree productively

164
0:09:58.542,000 --> 0:10:,000
is because we become attached to our ideas.

165
0:10:01.407,000 --> 0:10:06,000
We start to believe that we own them and that by extension, they own us.

166
0:10:08.132,000 --> 0:10:11,000
But eventually, if you debate long enough,

167
0:10:11.18,000 --> 0:10:12,000
you will switch sides,

168
0:10:12.49,000 --> 0:10:15,000
you'll argue for and against the expansion of the welfare state.

169
0:10:16.244,000 --> 0:10:18,000
For and against compulsory voting.

170
0:10:19.331,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And that exercise flips a kind of cognitive switch.

171
0:10:24.231,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The suspicions that you hold

172
0:10:26.514,000 --> 0:10:3,000
about people who espouse beliefs that you don't have, starts to evaporate.

173
0:10:31.514,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Because you can imagine yourself stepping into those shoes.

174
0:10:35.188,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And as you're stepping into those,

175
0:10:37.792,000 --> 0:10:39,000
you're embracing the humility of uncertainty.

176
0:10:40.386,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The possibility of being wrong.

177
0:10:43.411,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And it's that exact humility that makes us better decision-makers.

178
0:10:48.061,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Neuroscientist and psychologist Mark Leary at Duke University and his colleagues

179
0:10:53.355,000 --> 0:10:55,000
have found that people who are able to practice --

180
0:10:55.76,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and it is a skill --

181
0:10:57.22,000 --> 0:11:,000
what those researchers call intellectual humility

182
0:11:00.538,000 --> 0:11:03,000
are more capable of evaluating a broad range of evidence,

183
0:11:04.363,000 --> 0:11:06,000
are more objective when they do so,

184
0:11:06.64,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and become less defensive when confronted with conflicting evidence.

185
0:11:11.339,000 --> 0:11:14,000
All attributes that we want in our bosses,

186
0:11:14.573,000 --> 0:11:17,000
colleagues, discussion partners, decision-makers,

187
0:11:17.76,000 --> 0:11:2,000
all virtues that we would like to claim for ourselves.

188
0:11:22.688,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And so, as we're embracing that humility of uncertainty,

189
0:11:26.276,000 --> 0:11:29,000
we should be asking each other, all of us, a question.

190
0:11:30.696,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Our debate moderators, our news anchors should be asking it

191
0:11:34.149,000 --> 0:11:37,000
of our elective representatives and candidates for office, too.

192
0:11:38.355,000 --> 0:11:42,000
"What is it that you have changed your mind about and why?"

193
0:11:44.982,000 --> 0:11:47,000
"What uncertainty are you humble about?"

194
0:11:50.221,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And this by the way, isn't some fantasy

195
0:11:52.275,000 --> 0:11:55,000
about how public life and public conversations could work.

196
0:11:56.174,000 --> 0:11:57,000
It has precedent.

197
0:11:57.982,000 --> 0:11:58,000
So, in 1969,

198
0:11:59.84,000 --> 0:12:02,000
beloved American children's television presenter Mister Rogers

199
0:12:03.476,000 --> 0:12:04,000
sits impaneled

200
0:12:05.003,000 --> 0:12:08,000
before the United States congressional subcommittee on communications,

201
0:12:08.99,000 --> 0:12:12,000
chaired by the seemingly very curmudgeonly John Pastore.

202
0:12:13.651,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And Mister Rogers is there to make a kind of classic debate case,

203
0:12:16.81,000 --> 0:12:17,000
a really bold proposal:

204
0:12:18.714,000 --> 0:12:21,000
an increase in federal funding for public broadcasting.

205
0:12:23.815,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And at the outset,

206
0:12:25.03,000 --> 0:12:27,000
committee disciplinarian Senator Pastore is not having it.

207
0:12:27.815,000 --> 0:12:3,000
This is about to end really poorly for Mister Rogers.

208
0:12:31.792,000 --> 0:12:36,000
But patiently, very reasonably, Mister Rogers makes the case

209
0:12:37.204,000 --> 0:12:4,000
why good quality children's broadcasting,

210
0:12:40.617,000 --> 0:12:44,000
the kinds of television programs that talk about the drama that arises

211
0:12:44.974,000 --> 0:12:46,000
in the most ordinary of families,

212
0:12:47.339,000 --> 0:12:48,000
matters to all of us.

213
0:12:49.252,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Even while it costs us.

214
0:12:51.927,000 --> 0:12:53,000
He invites us into a shared reality.

215
0:12:55.593,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And on the other side of that table,

216
0:12:57.555,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Senator Pastore listens, engages and opens his mind.

217
0:13:05.333,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Out loud, in public, on the record.

218
0:13:10.604,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And Senator Pastore says to Mister Rogers,

219
0:13:13.397,000 --> 0:13:15,000
"You know, I'm supposed to be a pretty tough guy,

220
0:13:15.913,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and this is the first time I've had goosebumps in two days."

221
0:13:19.664,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And then, later, "It looks like you just earned the 20 million dollars."

222
0:13:26.307,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We need many more Mister Rogers.

223
0:13:29.839,000 --> 0:13:32,000
People with the technical skills of debate and persuasion.

224
0:13:33.768,000 --> 0:13:34,000
But on the other side of that table,

225
0:13:35.752,000 --> 0:13:4,000
we need many, many, many more Senator Pastores.

226
0:13:41.585,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And the magic of debate is that it lets you, it empowers you

227
0:13:45.434,000 --> 0:13:5,000
to be both Mister Rogers and Senator Pastore simultaneously.

228
0:13:51.8,000 --> 0:13:54,000
When I work with those same teams that we talked about before,

229
0:13:54.982,000 --> 0:13:58,000
I ask them at the outset to pre-commit to the possibility of being wrong.

230
0:14:00.323,000 --> 0:14:05,000
To explain to me and to each other what it would take to change their minds.

231
0:14:05.782,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And that's all about the attitude, not the exercise.

232
0:14:09.655,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Once you start thinking about what it would take to change your mind,

233
0:14:12.956,000 --> 0:14:16,000
you start to wonder why you were quite so sure in the first place.

234
0:14:17.996,000 --> 0:14:2,000
There is so much that the practice of debate

235
0:14:21.672,000 --> 0:14:23,000
has to offer us for how to disagree productively.

236
0:14:24.894,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And we should bring it to our workplaces,

237
0:14:27.093,000 --> 0:14:29,000
our conferences, our city council meetings.

238
0:14:30.085,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And the principles of debate can transform the way that we talk to one another,

239
0:14:35.815,000 --> 0:14:39,000
to empower us to stop talking and to start listening.

240
0:14:40.41,000 --> 0:14:43,000
To stop dismissing and to start persuading.

241
0:14:44.156,000 --> 0:14:48,000
To stop shutting down and to start opening our minds.

242
0:14:48.759,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Thank you so much.

243
0:14:50.005,000 --> 0:14:54,000
(Applause)

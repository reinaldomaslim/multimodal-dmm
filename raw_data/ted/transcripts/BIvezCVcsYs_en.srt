1
0:00:13.436,000 --> 0:00:14,000
In the movie "Interstellar,"

2
0:00:15.32,000 --> 0:00:18,000
we get an up-close look at a supermassive black hole.

3
0:00:18.671,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Set against a backdrop of bright gas,

4
0:00:20.838,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the black hole's massive gravitational pull

5
0:00:22.98,000 --> 0:00:23,000
bends light into a ring.

6
0:00:24.439,000 --> 0:00:26,000
However, this isn't a real photograph,

7
0:00:26.572,000 --> 0:00:27,000
but a computer graphic rendering --

8
0:00:28.382,000 --> 0:00:31,000
an artistic interpretation of what a black hole might look like.

9
0:00:32.401,000 --> 0:00:33,000
A hundred years ago,

10
0:00:33.591,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Albert Einstein first published his theory of general relativity.

11
0:00:37.216,000 --> 0:00:38,000
In the years since then,

12
0:00:38.679,000 --> 0:00:4,000
scientists have provided a lot of evidence in support of it.

13
0:00:41.676,000 --> 0:00:44,000
But one thing predicted from this theory, black holes,

14
0:00:44.784,000 --> 0:00:46,000
still have not been directly observed.

15
0:00:47.158,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Although we have some idea as to what a black hole might look like,

16
0:00:50.388,000 --> 0:00:52,000
we've never actually taken a picture of one before.

17
0:00:53.191,000 --> 0:00:57,000
However, you might be surprised to know that that may soon change.

18
0:00:57.494,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We may be seeing our first picture of a black hole in the next couple years.

19
0:01:01.682,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Getting this first picture will come down to an international team of scientists,

20
0:01:05.664,000 --> 0:01:06,000
an Earth-sized telescope

21
0:01:07.255,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and an algorithm that puts together the final picture.

22
0:01:10.111,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Although I won't be able to show you a real picture of a black hole today,

23
0:01:13.663,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I'd like to give you a brief glimpse into the effort involved

24
0:01:16.598,000 --> 0:01:17,000
in getting that first picture.

25
0:01:19.477,000 --> 0:01:2,000
My name is Katie Bouman,

26
0:01:20.938,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and I'm a PhD student at MIT.

27
0:01:23.528,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I do research in a computer science lab

28
0:01:25.579,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that works on making computers see through images and video.

29
0:01:28.901,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But although I'm not an astronomer,

30
0:01:31.087,000 --> 0:01:32,000
today I'd like to show you

31
0:01:32.396,000 --> 0:01:34,000
how I've been able to contribute to this exciting project.

32
0:01:35.323,000 --> 0:01:37,000
If you go out past the bright city lights tonight,

33
0:01:38.178,000 --> 0:01:4,000
you may just be lucky enough to see a stunning view

34
0:01:40.638,000 --> 0:01:41,000
of the Milky Way Galaxy.

35
0:01:42.155,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And if you could zoom past millions of stars,

36
0:01:44.641,000 --> 0:01:47,000
26,000 light-years toward the heart of the spiraling Milky Way,

37
0:01:48.42,000 --> 0:01:51,000
we'd eventually reach a cluster of stars right at the center.

38
0:01:51.965,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Peering past all the galactic dust with infrared telescopes,

39
0:01:55.195,000 --> 0:01:58,000
astronomers have watched these stars for over 16 years.

40
0:01:59.086,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But it's what they don't see that is the most spectacular.

41
0:02:02.699,000 --> 0:02:05,000
These stars seem to orbit an invisible object.

42
0:02:05.789,000 --> 0:02:07,000
By tracking the paths of these stars,

43
0:02:08.136,000 --> 0:02:09,000
astronomers have concluded

44
0:02:09.454,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that the only thing small and heavy enough to cause this motion

45
0:02:12.607,000 --> 0:02:13,000
is a supermassive black hole --

46
0:02:14.599,000 --> 0:02:18,000
an object so dense that it sucks up anything that ventures too close --

47
0:02:18.801,000 --> 0:02:19,000
even light.

48
0:02:20.319,000 --> 0:02:23,000
But what happens if we were to zoom in even further?

49
0:02:23.404,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Is it possible to see something that, by definition, is impossible to see?

50
0:02:28.719,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Well, it turns out that if we were to zoom in at radio wavelengths,

51
0:02:31.987,000 --> 0:02:32,000
we'd expect to see a ring of light

52
0:02:33.693,000 --> 0:02:35,000
caused by the gravitational lensing of hot plasma

53
0:02:36.128,000 --> 0:02:37,000
zipping around the black hole.

54
0:02:37.981,000 --> 0:02:38,000
In other words,

55
0:02:39.165,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the black hole casts a shadow on this backdrop of bright material,

56
0:02:42.36,000 --> 0:02:43,000
carving out a sphere of darkness.

57
0:02:44.226,000 --> 0:02:47,000
This bright ring reveals the black hole's event horizon,

58
0:02:47.589,000 --> 0:02:49,000
where the gravitational pull becomes so great

59
0:02:50.013,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that not even light can escape.

60
0:02:51.663,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Einstein's equations predict the size and shape of this ring,

61
0:02:54.546,000 --> 0:02:57,000
so taking a picture of it wouldn't only be really cool,

62
0:02:57.778,000 --> 0:02:59,000
it would also help to verify that these equations hold

63
0:03:00.42,000 --> 0:03:02,000
in the extreme conditions around the black hole.

64
0:03:02.91,000 --> 0:03:04,000
However, this black hole is so far away from us,

65
0:03:05.492,000 --> 0:03:08,000
that from Earth, this ring appears incredibly small --

66
0:03:08.614,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the same size to us as an orange on the surface of the moon.

67
0:03:12.758,000 --> 0:03:14,000
That makes taking a picture of it extremely difficult.

68
0:03:16.645,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Why is that?

69
0:03:18.512,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Well, it all comes down to a simple equation.

70
0:03:21.724,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Due to a phenomenon called diffraction,

71
0:03:24.164,000 --> 0:03:25,000
there are fundamental limits

72
0:03:25.543,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to the smallest objects that we can possibly see.

73
0:03:28.789,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This governing equation says that in order to see smaller and smaller,

74
0:03:32.485,000 --> 0:03:34,000
we need to make our telescope bigger and bigger.

75
0:03:35.096,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But even with the most powerful optical telescopes here on Earth,

76
0:03:38.189,000 --> 0:03:4,000
we can't even get close to the resolution necessary

77
0:03:40.632,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to image on the surface of the moon.

78
0:03:42.854,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In fact, here I show one of the highest resolution images ever taken

79
0:03:46.495,000 --> 0:03:47,000
of the moon from Earth.

80
0:03:47.916,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It contains roughly 13,000 pixels,

81
0:03:50.497,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and yet each pixel would contain over 1.5 million oranges.

82
0:03:55.396,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So how big of a telescope do we need

83
0:03:57.392,000 --> 0:03:59,000
in order to see an orange on the surface of the moon

84
0:04:00.181,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and, by extension, our black hole?

85
0:04:02.419,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Well, it turns out that by crunching the numbers,

86
0:04:04.783,000 --> 0:04:06,000
you can easily calculate that we would need a telescope

87
0:04:07.417,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the size of the entire Earth.

88
0:04:08.834,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:09.882,000 --> 0:04:11,000
If we could build this Earth-sized telescope,

90
0:04:12.025,000 --> 0:04:14,000
we could just start to make out that distinctive ring of light

91
0:04:14.974,000 --> 0:04:16,000
indicative of the black hole's event horizon.

92
0:04:17.181,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Although this picture wouldn't contain all the detail we see

93
0:04:20.123,000 --> 0:04:21,000
in computer graphic renderings,

94
0:04:21.653,000 --> 0:04:23,000
it would allow us to safely get our first glimpse

95
0:04:23.976,000 --> 0:04:25,000
of the immediate environment around a black hole.

96
0:04:26.487,000 --> 0:04:27,000
However, as you can imagine,

97
0:04:28.124,000 --> 0:04:31,000
building a single-dish telescope the size of the Earth is impossible.

98
0:04:31.772,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But in the famous words of Mick Jagger,

99
0:04:33.683,000 --> 0:04:34,000
"You can't always get what you want,

100
0:04:35.498,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but if you try sometimes, you just might find

101
0:04:37.709,000 --> 0:04:38,000
you get what you need."

102
0:04:38.948,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And by connecting telescopes from around the world,

103
0:04:41.436,000 --> 0:04:44,000
an international collaboration called the Event Horizon Telescope

104
0:04:44.998,000 --> 0:04:47,000
is creating a computational telescope the size of the Earth,

105
0:04:48.131,000 --> 0:04:49,000
capable of resolving structure

106
0:04:49.692,000 --> 0:04:51,000
on the scale of a black hole's event horizon.

107
0:04:51.915,000 --> 0:04:54,000
This network of telescopes is scheduled to take its very first picture

108
0:04:55.326,000 --> 0:04:56,000
of a black hole next year.

109
0:04:57.165,000 --> 0:05:,000
Each telescope in the worldwide network works together.

110
0:05:00.527,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Linked through the precise timing of atomic clocks,

111
0:05:03.263,000 --> 0:05:05,000
teams of researchers at each of the sites freeze light

112
0:05:05.944,000 --> 0:05:07,000
by collecting thousands of terabytes of data.

113
0:05:08.93,000 --> 0:05:13,000
This data is then processed in a lab right here in Massachusetts.

114
0:05:13.971,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So how does this even work?

115
0:05:15.789,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Remember if we want to see the black hole in the center of our galaxy,

116
0:05:19.216,000 --> 0:05:21,000
we need to build this impossibly large Earth-sized telescope?

117
0:05:22.222,000 --> 0:05:24,000
For just a second, let's pretend we could build

118
0:05:24.478,000 --> 0:05:25,000
a telescope the size of the Earth.

119
0:05:26.344,000 --> 0:05:28,000
This would be a little bit like turning the Earth

120
0:05:28.823,000 --> 0:05:29,000
into a giant spinning disco ball.

121
0:05:30.594,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Each individual mirror would collect light

122
0:05:32.818,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that we could then combine together to make a picture.

123
0:05:35.439,000 --> 0:05:37,000
However, now let's say we remove most of those mirrors

124
0:05:38.124,000 --> 0:05:39,000
so only a few remained.

125
0:05:40.12,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We could still try to combine this information together,

126
0:05:43.021,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but now there are a lot of holes.

127
0:05:45.038,000 --> 0:05:49,000
These remaining mirrors represent the locations where we have telescopes.

128
0:05:49.435,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This is an incredibly small number of measurements to make a picture from.

129
0:05:53.538,000 --> 0:05:56,000
But although we only collect light at a few telescope locations,

130
0:05:57.4,000 --> 0:06:,000
as the Earth rotates, we get to see other new measurements.

131
0:06:00.847,000 --> 0:06:03,000
In other words, as the disco ball spins, those mirrors change locations

132
0:06:04.69,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and we get to observe different parts of the image.

133
0:06:07.613,000 --> 0:06:11,000
The imaging algorithms we develop fill in the missing gaps of the disco ball

134
0:06:11.655,000 --> 0:06:14,000
in order to reconstruct the underlying black hole image.

135
0:06:14.712,000 --> 0:06:16,000
If we had telescopes located everywhere on the globe --

136
0:06:17.372,000 --> 0:06:18,000
in other words, the entire disco ball --

137
0:06:19.337,000 --> 0:06:2,000
this would be trivial.

138
0:06:20.645,000 --> 0:06:23,000
However, we only see a few samples, and for that reason,

139
0:06:23.991,000 --> 0:06:25,000
there are an infinite number of possible images

140
0:06:26.403,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that are perfectly consistent with our telescope measurements.

141
0:06:29.391,000 --> 0:06:32,000
However, not all images are created equal.

142
0:06:32.849,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Some of those images look more like what we think of as images than others.

143
0:06:37.331,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And so, my role in helping to take the first image of a black hole

144
0:06:40.577,000 --> 0:06:42,000
is to design algorithms that find the most reasonable image

145
0:06:43.533,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that also fits the telescope measurements.

146
0:06:46.727,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Just as a forensic sketch artist uses limited descriptions

147
0:06:50.693,000 --> 0:06:53,000
to piece together a picture using their knowledge of face structure,

148
0:06:54.231,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the imaging algorithms I develop use our limited telescope data

149
0:06:57.57,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to guide us to a picture that also looks like stuff in our universe.

150
0:07:01.916,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Using these algorithms, we're able to piece together pictures

151
0:07:05.591,000 --> 0:07:07,000
from this sparse, noisy data.

152
0:07:07.795,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So here I show a sample reconstruction done using simulated data,

153
0:07:12.348,000 --> 0:07:13,000
when we pretend to point our telescopes

154
0:07:14.305,000 --> 0:07:16,000
to the black hole in the center of our galaxy.

155
0:07:16.914,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Although this is just a simulation, reconstruction such as this give us hope

156
0:07:21.393,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that we'll soon be able to reliably take the first image of a black hole

157
0:07:24.87,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and from it, determine the size of its ring.

158
0:07:28.118,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Although I'd love to go on about all the details of this algorithm,

159
0:07:31.341,000 --> 0:07:33,000
luckily for you, I don't have the time.

160
0:07:33.539,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But I'd still like to give you a brief idea

161
0:07:35.564,000 --> 0:07:37,000
of how we define what our universe looks like,

162
0:07:37.89,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and how we use this to reconstruct and verify our results.

163
0:07:42.38,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Since there are an infinite number of possible images

164
0:07:44.9,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that perfectly explain our telescope measurements,

165
0:07:47.289,000 --> 0:07:49,000
we have to choose between them in some way.

166
0:07:49.918,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We do this by ranking the images

167
0:07:51.78,000 --> 0:07:53,000
based upon how likely they are to be the black hole image,

168
0:07:54.638,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and then choosing the one that's most likely.

169
0:07:57.144,000 --> 0:07:59,000
So what do I mean by this exactly?

170
0:07:59.862,000 --> 0:08:,000
Let's say we were trying to make a model

171
0:08:01.864,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that told us how likely an image were to appear on Facebook.

172
0:08:05.071,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We'd probably want the model to say

173
0:08:06.796,000 --> 0:08:09,000
it's pretty unlikely that someone would post this noise image on the left,

174
0:08:10.377,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and pretty likely that someone would post a selfie

175
0:08:12.82,000 --> 0:08:13,000
like this one on the right.

176
0:08:14.178,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The image in the middle is blurry,

177
0:08:15.841,000 --> 0:08:17,000
so even though it's more likely we'd see it on Facebook

178
0:08:18.504,000 --> 0:08:19,000
compared to the noise image,

179
0:08:19.888,000 --> 0:08:21,000
it's probably less likely we'd see it compared to the selfie.

180
0:08:22.872,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But when it comes to images from the black hole,

181
0:08:25.186,000 --> 0:08:28,000
we're posed with a real conundrum: we've never seen a black hole before.

182
0:08:28.712,000 --> 0:08:3,000
In that case, what is a likely black hole image,

183
0:08:31.027,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and what should we assume about the structure of black holes?

184
0:08:33.989,000 --> 0:08:35,000
We could try to use images from simulations we've done,

185
0:08:36.645,000 --> 0:08:38,000
like the image of the black hole from "Interstellar,"

186
0:08:39.199,000 --> 0:08:41,000
but if we did this, it could cause some serious problems.

187
0:08:42.161,000 --> 0:08:45,000
What would happen if Einstein's theories didn't hold?

188
0:08:45.565,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We'd still want to reconstruct an accurate picture of what was going on.

189
0:08:49.55,000 --> 0:08:52,000
If we bake Einstein's equations too much into our algorithms,

190
0:08:52.945,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we'll just end up seeing what we expect to see.

191
0:08:55.724,000 --> 0:08:57,000
In other words, we want to leave the option open

192
0:08:58.024,000 --> 0:09:,000
for there being a giant elephant at the center of our galaxy.

193
0:09:00.971,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Laughter)

194
0:09:02.052,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Different types of images have very distinct features.

195
0:09:05.065,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We can easily tell the difference between black hole simulation images

196
0:09:08.637,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and images we take every day here on Earth.

197
0:09:10.937,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We need a way to tell our algorithms what images look like

198
0:09:14.065,000 --> 0:09:17,000
without imposing one type of image's features too much.

199
0:09:17.865,000 --> 0:09:18,000
One way we can try to get around this

200
0:09:19.782,000 --> 0:09:22,000
is by imposing the features of different kinds of images

201
0:09:22.868,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and seeing how the type of image we assume affects our reconstructions.

202
0:09:27.712,000 --> 0:09:3,000
If all images' types produce a very similar-looking image,

203
0:09:31.227,000 --> 0:09:33,000
then we can start to become more confident

204
0:09:33.308,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that the image assumptions we're making are not biasing this picture that much.

205
0:09:37.505,000 --> 0:09:39,000
This is a little bit like giving the same description

206
0:09:40.519,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to three different sketch artists from all around the world.

207
0:09:43.539,000 --> 0:09:45,000
If they all produce a very similar-looking face,

208
0:09:46.423,000 --> 0:09:47,000
then we can start to become confident

209
0:09:48.24,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that they're not imposing their own cultural biases on the drawings.

210
0:09:51.88,000 --> 0:09:54,000
One way we can try to impose different image features

211
0:09:55.219,000 --> 0:09:57,000
is by using pieces of existing images.

212
0:09:58.214,000 --> 0:10:,000
So we take a large collection of images,

213
0:10:00.398,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and we break them down into their little image patches.

214
0:10:03.14,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We then can treat each image patch a little bit like pieces of a puzzle.

215
0:10:07.449,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And we use commonly seen puzzle pieces to piece together an image

216
0:10:11.751,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that also fits our telescope measurements.

217
0:10:15.04,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Different types of images have very distinctive sets of puzzle pieces.

218
0:10:18.807,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So what happens when we take the same data

219
0:10:21.637,000 --> 0:10:25,000
but we use different sets of puzzle pieces to reconstruct the image?

220
0:10:25.791,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Let's first start with black hole image simulation puzzle pieces.

221
0:10:30.581,000 --> 0:10:31,000
OK, this looks reasonable.

222
0:10:32.196,000 --> 0:10:34,000
This looks like what we expect a black hole to look like.

223
0:10:34.914,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But did we just get it

224
0:10:36.131,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because we just fed it little pieces of black hole simulation images?

225
0:10:39.469,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Let's try another set of puzzle pieces

226
0:10:41.373,000 --> 0:10:43,000
from astronomical, non-black hole objects.

227
0:10:44.914,000 --> 0:10:46,000
OK, we get a similar-looking image.

228
0:10:47.064,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And then how about pieces from everyday images,

229
0:10:49.324,000 --> 0:10:51,000
like the images you take with your own personal camera?

230
0:10:53.312,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Great, we see the same image.

231
0:10:55.451,000 --> 0:10:58,000
When we get the same image from all different sets of puzzle pieces,

232
0:10:58.841,000 --> 0:11:,000
then we can start to become more confident

233
0:11:00.911,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that the image assumptions we're making

234
0:11:02.901,000 --> 0:11:04,000
aren't biasing the final image we get too much.

235
0:11:05.846,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Another thing we can do is take the same set of puzzle pieces,

236
0:11:09.123,000 --> 0:11:11,000
such as the ones derived from everyday images,

237
0:11:11.636,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and use them to reconstruct many different kinds of source images.

238
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So in our simulations,

239
0:11:16.555,000 --> 0:11:19,000
we pretend a black hole looks like astronomical non-black hole objects,

240
0:11:20.354,000 --> 0:11:23,000
as well as everyday images like the elephant in the center of our galaxy.

241
0:11:24.227,000 --> 0:11:27,000
When the results of our algorithms on the bottom look very similar

242
0:11:27.419,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to the simulation's truth image on top,

243
0:11:29.539,000 --> 0:11:32,000
then we can start to become more confident in our algorithms.

244
0:11:32.909,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And I really want to emphasize here

245
0:11:34.8,000 --> 0:11:35,000
that all of these pictures were created

246
0:11:36.758,000 --> 0:11:38,000
by piecing together little pieces of everyday photographs,

247
0:11:39.718,000 --> 0:11:41,000
like you'd take with your own personal camera.

248
0:11:41.957,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So an image of a black hole we've never seen before

249
0:11:45.257,000 --> 0:11:48,000
may eventually be created by piecing together pictures we see all the time

250
0:11:49.224,000 --> 0:11:51,000
of people, buildings, trees, cats and dogs.

251
0:11:51.993,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Imaging ideas like this will make it possible for us

252
0:11:54.662,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to take our very first pictures of a black hole,

253
0:11:57.305,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and hopefully, verify those famous theories

254
0:11:59.776,000 --> 0:12:01,000
on which scientists rely on a daily basis.

255
0:12:02.221,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But of course, getting imaging ideas like this working

256
0:12:04.853,000 --> 0:12:07,000
would never have been possible without the amazing team of researchers

257
0:12:08.199,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that I have the privilege to work with.

258
0:12:10.11,000 --> 0:12:11,000
It still amazes me

259
0:12:11.297,000 --> 0:12:14,000
that although I began this project with no background in astrophysics,

260
0:12:14.672,000 --> 0:12:16,000
what we have achieved through this unique collaboration

261
0:12:17.315,000 --> 0:12:19,000
could result in the very first images of a black hole.

262
0:12:20.098,000 --> 0:12:22,000
But big projects like the Event Horizon Telescope

263
0:12:22.82,000 --> 0:12:24,000
are successful due to all the interdisciplinary expertise

264
0:12:25.658,000 --> 0:12:26,000
different people bring to the table.

265
0:12:27.472,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We're a melting pot of astronomers,

266
0:12:29.202,000 --> 0:12:31,000
physicists, mathematicians and engineers.

267
0:12:31.458,000 --> 0:12:33,000
This is what will make it soon possible

268
0:12:34.036,000 --> 0:12:36,000
to achieve something once thought impossible.

269
0:12:36.913,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I'd like to encourage all of you to go out

270
0:12:39.193,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and help push the boundaries of science,

271
0:12:41.313,000 --> 0:12:44,000
even if it may at first seem as mysterious to you as a black hole.

272
0:12:45.238,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Thank you.

273
0:12:46.436,000 --> 0:12:48,000
(Applause)

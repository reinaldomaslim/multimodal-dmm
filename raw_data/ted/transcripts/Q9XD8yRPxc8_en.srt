1
0:00:13.737,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Preparing for this talk has been scarier for me

2
0:00:16.803,000 --> 0:00:18,000
than preparing for LSD therapy.

3
0:00:19.128,000 --> 0:00:2,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:21.414,000 --> 0:00:23,000
"Psychedelics are to the study of the mind

5
0:00:24.374,000 --> 0:00:27,000
what the microscope is to biology

6
0:00:27.45,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and the telescope is to astronomy."

7
0:00:30.338,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Dr. Stanislav Grof spoke those words.

8
0:00:33.18,000 --> 0:00:36,000
He's one of the leading psychedelic researchers in the world,

9
0:00:36.221,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and he's also been my mentor.

10
0:00:38.95,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Today, I'd like to share with you how psychedelics, when used wisely,

11
0:00:43.95,000 --> 0:00:45,000
have the potential to help heal us,

12
0:00:46.657,000 --> 0:00:48,000
help inspire us,

13
0:00:48.823,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and perhaps even to help save us.

14
0:00:51.395,000 --> 0:00:52,000
In the 1950s and 60s,

15
0:00:53.194,000 --> 0:00:55,000
psychedelic research flourished all over the world

16
0:00:56.18,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and showed great promise for the fields of psychiatry,

17
0:00:59.895,000 --> 0:01:01,000
psychology and psychotherapy,

18
0:01:01.919,000 --> 0:01:04,000
neuroscience and the study of mystical experiences.

19
0:01:05.577,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But psychedelics leaked out of the research settings

20
0:01:08.905,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and began to be used by the counterculture,

21
0:01:11.445,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and by the anti-Vietnam War movement.

22
0:01:14.175,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And there was unwise use.

23
0:01:16.667,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And so there was a backlash.

24
0:01:18.284,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And in 1970, the US government criminalized all uses of psychedelics,

25
0:01:23.927,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and they began shutting down all psychedelic research.

26
0:01:27.323,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And this ban spread all over the world and lasted for decades.

27
0:01:30.819,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and it was tragic,

28
0:01:32.347,000 --> 0:01:34,000
since psychedelics are really just tools,

29
0:01:34.537,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and whether their outcomes are beneficial or harmful

30
0:01:37.776,000 --> 0:01:39,000
depends on how they're used.

31
0:01:40.919,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Psychedelic means "mind-manifesting,"

32
0:01:46.951,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and it relates to drugs like LSD, psilocybin, mescaline,

33
0:01:54.514,000 --> 0:01:56,000
iboga and other drugs.

34
0:01:57.997,000 --> 0:01:58,000
When I was 18 years old,

35
0:01:59.83,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I was a college freshman,

36
0:02:02.672,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I was experimenting with LSD and mescaline,

37
0:02:05.99,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and these experiences brought me in touch with my emotions.

38
0:02:09.919,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And they helped me have a spiritual connection

39
0:02:12.363,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that unfortunately, my bar mitzvah did not produce.

40
0:02:16.397,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:18.651,000 --> 0:02:19,000
When I wanted to tease my parents,

42
0:02:20.636,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I would tell them that they drove me to psychedelics

43
0:02:23.349,000 --> 0:02:26,000
because my bar mitzvah had failed to turn me into a man.

44
0:02:27.043,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:29.892,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But most importantly,

46
0:02:31.091,000 --> 0:02:34,000
psychedelics gave me this feeling of our shared humanity,

47
0:02:34.257,000 --> 0:02:36,000
of our unity with all life.

48
0:02:37.125,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And other people reported that same thing as well.

49
0:02:39.958,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And I felt that these experiences had the potential

50
0:02:43.712,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to help be an antidote

51
0:02:46.337,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to tribalism, to fundamentalism, to genocide and environmental destruction.

52
0:02:51.448,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And so I decided to focus my life

53
0:02:54.432,000 --> 0:02:55,000
on changing the laws

54
0:02:56.387,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and becoming a legal psychedelic psychotherapist.

55
0:03:00.625,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Applause)

56
0:03:04.49,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Now, half a century after the ban,

57
0:03:06.546,000 --> 0:03:09,000
we're in the midst of a global renaissance of psychedelic research.

58
0:03:10.958,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Psychedelic psychotherapy is showing great promise

59
0:03:13.961,000 --> 0:03:17,000
for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD,

60
0:03:18.636,000 --> 0:03:22,000
depression, social anxiety, substance abuse and alcoholism

61
0:03:24.08,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and suicide.

62
0:03:25.371,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Psychedelic psychotherapy is an attempt to go after the root causes

63
0:03:29.339,000 --> 0:03:3,000
of the problems,

64
0:03:30.514,000 --> 0:03:32,000
with just relatively few administrations,

65
0:03:33.009,000 --> 0:03:37,000
as contrasted to most of the psychiatric drugs used today

66
0:03:37.533,000 --> 0:03:4,000
that are mostly just reducing symptoms

67
0:03:40.731,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and are meant to be taken on a daily basis.

68
0:03:45.516,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Psychedelics are now also being used as tools for neuroscience

69
0:03:49.287,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to study brain function

70
0:03:50.76,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and to study the enduring mystery of human consciousness.

71
0:03:55.307,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And psychedelics and the mystical experiences they produce

72
0:03:58.546,000 --> 0:04:01,000
are being explored for their connections between meditation and mindfulness,

73
0:04:02.157,000 --> 0:04:04,000
including a paper just recently published

74
0:04:04.726,000 --> 0:04:07,000
about lifelong zen meditators taking psilocybin

75
0:04:08.744,000 --> 0:04:09,000
in the midst of a meditation retreat

76
0:04:10.656,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and showing long-term benefits and brain changes.

77
0:04:15.411,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now, how do these drugs work?

78
0:04:17.577,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Modern neuroscience research has demonstrated

79
0:04:19.893,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that psychedelics reduce activity

80
0:04:22.395,000 --> 0:04:24,000
in what's known as the brain's default mode network.

81
0:04:24.942,000 --> 0:04:26,000
This is where we create our sense of self.

82
0:04:28.269,000 --> 0:04:29,000
It's our equivalent to the ego,

83
0:04:30.096,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and it filters all incoming information

84
0:04:32.745,000 --> 0:04:35,000
according to our personal needs and priorities.

85
0:04:36.334,000 --> 0:04:39,000
When activity is reduced in the default mode network,

86
0:04:39.876,000 --> 0:04:43,000
our ego shifts from the foreground to the background,

87
0:04:44.178,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and we see that it's just part of a larger field of awareness.

88
0:04:49.803,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It's similar to the shift

89
0:04:51.065,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that Copernicus and Galileo were able to produce in humanity

90
0:04:54.588,000 --> 0:04:55,000
using the telescope

91
0:04:55.794,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to show that the earth was no longer the center of the universe,

92
0:05:00.482,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but was actually something that revolved around the sun,

93
0:05:03.808,000 --> 0:05:05,000
something bigger than itself.

94
0:05:06.355,000 --> 0:05:08,000
For some people, this shift in awareness

95
0:05:09.268,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is the most important

96
0:05:11.336,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and among the most important experiences of their lives.

97
0:05:14.569,000 --> 0:05:18,000
They feel more connected to the world bigger than themselves.

98
0:05:18.839,000 --> 0:05:19,000
They feel more altruistic,

99
0:05:20.601,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and they lose some of their fear of death.

100
0:05:24.386,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Not all drugs work this way.

101
0:05:26.188,000 --> 0:05:3,000
MDMA, also known as Ecstasy, or Molly,

102
0:05:30.22,000 --> 0:05:31,000
works fundamentally different.

103
0:05:31.673,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And I'll be able to share with you the story of Marcela,

104
0:05:34.341,000 --> 0:05:37,000
who suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder

105
0:05:37.601,000 --> 0:05:39,000
from a violent sexual assault.

106
0:05:40.786,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Marcela and I were introduced in 1984,

107
0:05:44.397,000 --> 0:05:46,000
when MDMA was still legal,

108
0:05:46.651,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but it was beginning also to leak out of therapeutic circles.

109
0:05:50.659,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Marcela had tried MDMA in a recreational setting,

110
0:05:54.664,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and during that, her past trauma flooded her awareness

111
0:05:58.339,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and it intensified her suicidal feelings.

112
0:06:03.006,000 --> 0:06:04,000
During our first conversation,

113
0:06:04.696,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I shared that when MDMA is taken therapeutically,

114
0:06:08.838,000 --> 0:06:11,000
it can reduce the fear of difficult emotions,

115
0:06:12.139,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and she could help move forward past her trauma.

116
0:06:15.575,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I asked her to promise not to commit suicide

117
0:06:19.642,000 --> 0:06:2,000
if we were to work together.

118
0:06:21.617,000 --> 0:06:24,000
She agreed and made that promise.

119
0:06:25.498,000 --> 0:06:26,000
During her therapeutic sessions,

120
0:06:27.332,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Marcela was able to process her trauma more fluidly, more easily.

121
0:06:33.419,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And yet, she was able to tell

122
0:06:36.395,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that the rapist had told her that if she ever shared her story,

123
0:06:40.003,000 --> 0:06:41,000
he would kill her.

124
0:06:41.823,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And she realized that that was keeping her a prisoner in her own mind.

125
0:06:46.307,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So being able to share the story

126
0:06:48.402,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and experience the feelings and the thoughts in her mind

127
0:06:53.032,000 --> 0:06:54,000
freed her,

128
0:06:54.206,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and she was able to decide

129
0:06:55.524,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that she wanted to move forward with her life.

130
0:06:58.167,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And in that moment,

131
0:06:59.4,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I realized that MDMA could be very effective for treating PTSD.

132
0:07:04.749,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Now, 35 years later, after Marcela's treatment,

133
0:07:08.495,000 --> 0:07:1,000
she's actually a therapist,

134
0:07:11.115,000 --> 0:07:15,000
training other therapists to help people overcome PTSD with MDMA.

135
0:07:17.657,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Now, how does MDMA work?

136
0:07:20.015,000 --> 0:07:21,000
How did MDMA help Marcela?

137
0:07:22.387,000 --> 0:07:25,000
People who have PTSD have brains that are different

138
0:07:25.889,000 --> 0:07:27,000
from those of us who don't have PTSD.

139
0:07:28.403,000 --> 0:07:31,000
They have a hyperactive amygdala, where we process fear.

140
0:07:31.823,000 --> 0:07:34,000
They have reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex,

141
0:07:35.593,000 --> 0:07:36,000
where we think logically.

142
0:07:37.379,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And they have reduced activity in the hippocampus,

143
0:07:39.975,000 --> 0:07:42,000
where we store memories into long-term storage.

144
0:07:43.919,000 --> 0:07:46,000
MDMA changes the brain in the opposite way.

145
0:07:47.689,000 --> 0:07:49,000
MDMA reduces activity in the amygdala,

146
0:07:50.458,000 --> 0:07:53,000
increases activity in the prefrontal cortex

147
0:07:53.76,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and increases connectivity between the amygdala and the hippocampus

148
0:07:57.427,000 --> 0:08:,000
to remit traumatic memories to move into long-term storage.

149
0:08:01.72,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Recently, researchers at Johns Hopkins published a paper in "Nature,"

150
0:08:06.093,000 --> 0:08:09,000
in which they demonstrated that MDMA releases oxytocin,

151
0:08:09.464,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the hormone of love and nurturing.

152
0:08:12.744,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The same researchers also did studies in octopuses,

153
0:08:15.923,000 --> 0:08:19,000
who are normally asocial, unless it's mating season.

154
0:08:20.053,000 --> 0:08:22,000
But lo and behold, you give them MDMA,

155
0:08:22.696,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and they become prosocial.

156
0:08:24.712,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Laughter)

157
0:08:27.388,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Several months after Marcela and I worked together,

158
0:08:30.166,000 --> 0:08:34,000
the Drug Enforcement Administration moved to criminalize Ecstasy,

159
0:08:34.812,000 --> 0:08:36,000
having no knowledge of its therapeutic use.

160
0:08:37.243,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So I went to Washington,

161
0:08:39.006,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and I went into the headquarters of the Drug Enforcement Administration,

162
0:08:42.649,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and I filed a lawsuit demanding a hearing,

163
0:08:45.037,000 --> 0:08:48,000
at which psychiatrists and psychotherapists

164
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
would be able to present information about therapeutic use of MDMA

165
0:08:51.762,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to try to keep it legal.

166
0:08:54.032,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And in the middle of the hearing, the DEA freaked out,

167
0:08:56.829,000 --> 0:08:58,000
declared an emergency

168
0:08:59.715,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and criminalized all uses of MDMA.

169
0:09:02.366,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And so the only way that I could see to bring it back

170
0:09:05.219,000 --> 0:09:07,000
was through science, through medicine

171
0:09:07.989,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and through the FDA drug development process.

172
0:09:10.301,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So in 1986, I started MAPS

173
0:09:13.172,000 --> 0:09:16,000
as a nonprofit psychedelic pharmaceutical company.

174
0:09:17.609,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It took us 30 years, till 2016,

175
0:09:20.569,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to develop the data that we needed to present to FDA

176
0:09:24.45,000 --> 0:09:27,000
to request permission to move into the large-scale Phase 3 studies

177
0:09:28.317,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that are required to prove safety and efficacy

178
0:09:31.243,000 --> 0:09:34,000
before you get approval for prescription use.

179
0:09:34.694,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Tony was a veteran in one of our pilot studies.

180
0:09:38.998,000 --> 0:09:39,000
According to the Veterans Administration,

181
0:09:41.006,000 --> 0:09:44,000
there's over a million veterans now disabled with PTSD.

182
0:09:44.546,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And at least 20 veterans a day are committing suicide,

183
0:09:48.101,000 --> 0:09:5,000
many of them from PTSD.

184
0:09:51.555,000 --> 0:09:55,000
The treatment that Tony was to receive was three and a half months long.

185
0:09:56.459,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But during that period of time,

186
0:09:57.976,000 --> 0:09:59,000
he would only get MDMA on three occasions,

187
0:10:00.784,000 --> 0:10:03,000
separated by 12, 90-minute non-drug psychotherapy sessions,

188
0:10:04.688,000 --> 0:10:06,000
three before the first MDMA session for preparation

189
0:10:07.649,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and three after each MDMA session for integration.

190
0:10:11.8,000 --> 0:10:14,000
We call our treatment approach "inner-directed therapy,"

191
0:10:15.599,000 --> 0:10:19,000
in that we support the patient to experience whatever's emerging

192
0:10:19.893,000 --> 0:10:21,000
within their minds or their bodies.

193
0:10:23.361,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Even with MDMA, this is hard work.

194
0:10:26.077,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And a lot of our subjects have said,

195
0:10:28.123,000 --> 0:10:3,000
"I don't know why they call this Ecstasy."

196
0:10:30.442,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Laughter)

197
0:10:32.435,000 --> 0:10:34,000
During Tony's first MDMA session,

198
0:10:34.872,000 --> 0:10:36,000
he lay on the couch, he had eyeshades on,

199
0:10:37.538,000 --> 0:10:39,000
he listened to music,

200
0:10:39.729,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and he would speak to the therapists,

201
0:10:41.569,000 --> 0:10:42,000
who were a male-female co-therapy team,

202
0:10:43.494,000 --> 0:10:45,000
whenever he felt that he needed to.

203
0:10:46.022,000 --> 0:10:47,000
After several hours,

204
0:10:47.355,000 --> 0:10:5,000
in a moment of calmness and clarity,

205
0:10:50.442,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Tony shared that he had realized

206
0:10:54.014,000 --> 0:10:59,000
his PTSD was a way of connecting him to his friends.

207
0:10:59.688,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It was a way of honoring the memory of his friends who had died.

208
0:11:04.34,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But he was able to shift and see himself through the eyes of his dead friends.

209
0:11:08.609,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And he realized that they would not want him to suffer,

210
0:11:11.385,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to squander his life.

211
0:11:12.657,000 --> 0:11:13,000
They would want him to live more fully,

212
0:11:14.553,000 --> 0:11:15,000
which they were unable to do.

213
0:11:16.354,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And so he realized that there was a new way to honor their memory,

214
0:11:20.409,000 --> 0:11:22,000
which was to live as fully as possible.

215
0:11:23.822,000 --> 0:11:26,000
He also realized that he was telling himself a story

216
0:11:26.964,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that he was taking opiates for pain.

217
0:11:29.355,000 --> 0:11:31,000
But actually, he realized, he was taking them for escape.

218
0:11:32.643,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So he decided he didn't need the opiates anymore,

219
0:11:35.538,000 --> 0:11:36,000
he didn't need the MDMA anymore,

220
0:11:37.324,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and he was dropping out of the study.

221
0:11:39.752,000 --> 0:11:4,000
That was seven years ago.

222
0:11:41.323,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Tony is still free of PTSD,

223
0:11:43.561,000 --> 0:11:45,000
has never returned to opiates

224
0:11:46.141,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and is helping others less fortunate than himself in Cambodia.

225
0:11:50.84,000 --> 0:11:54,000
(Applause)

226
0:11:55.551,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The data that we presented to FDA

227
0:11:58.185,000 --> 0:12:01,000
from 107 people in our pilot studies, including Tony,

228
0:12:01.391,000 --> 0:12:06,000
showed that 23 percent of the people that received therapy without active MDMA

229
0:12:07.183,000 --> 0:12:1,000
no longer had PTSD at the end of treatment.

230
0:12:10.238,000 --> 0:12:13,000
This is really pretty good for this patient population.

231
0:12:13.371,000 --> 0:12:15,000
However, when you add MDMA,

232
0:12:15.696,000 --> 0:12:19,000
the results more than double, to 56 percent no longer having PTSD.

233
0:12:21.175,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Applause)

234
0:12:24.635,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But most importantly,

235
0:12:25.897,000 --> 0:12:28,000
once people learn that if they don't need to suppress their trauma,

236
0:12:29.069,000 --> 0:12:3,000
but they can process it,

237
0:12:30.728,000 --> 0:12:32,000
they keep getting better on their own.

238
0:12:32.831,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So at the 12-month follow-up one year after the last treatment session,

239
0:12:36.806,000 --> 0:12:39,000
two-thirds no longer have PTSD.

240
0:12:39.895,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And of the one-third that do,

241
0:12:41.68,000 --> 0:12:44,000
many have clinically significant reductions in symptoms.

242
0:12:45.347,000 --> 0:12:48,000
(Applause)

243
0:12:49.552,000 --> 0:12:5,000
On the basis of this data,

244
0:12:51.379,000 --> 0:12:55,000
the FDA has declared MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD

245
0:12:55.95,000 --> 0:12:56,000
a breakthrough therapy.

246
0:12:57.782,000 --> 0:13:,000
FDA has also declared psilocybin a breakthrough therapy

247
0:13:01.125,000 --> 0:13:02,000
for treatment-resistant depression

248
0:13:03.131,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and just recently approved esketamine for depression.

249
0:13:08.972,000 --> 0:13:12,000
I'm proud to say that we have now initiated our Phase 3 studies.

250
0:13:14.631,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And if the results are as we hope,

251
0:13:17.425,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and if they're similar to the Phase 2 studies,

252
0:13:19.704,000 --> 0:13:24,000
by the end of 2021, FDA will approve MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD.

253
0:13:25.927,000 --> 0:13:26,000
If approved,

254
0:13:27.102,000 --> 0:13:31,000
the only therapists who will be able to directly administer it to patients

255
0:13:31.163,000 --> 0:13:34,000
are going to be therapists that have been through our training program,

256
0:13:34.554,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and they will only be able to administer MDMA

257
0:13:36.769,000 --> 0:13:38,000
under direct supervision in clinic settings.

258
0:13:41.157,000 --> 0:13:45,000
We anticipate that over the next several decades,

259
0:13:45.237,000 --> 0:13:47,000
there will be thousands of psychedelic clinics established,

260
0:13:48.237,000 --> 0:13:51,000
at which, therapists will be able to administer MDMA,

261
0:13:52.023,000 --> 0:13:55,000
psilocybin, ketamine and other psychedelics

262
0:13:55.173,000 --> 0:13:57,000
to potentially millions of patients.

263
0:13:58.609,000 --> 0:14:02,000
These clinics can also evolve into centers where people can come

264
0:14:03.304,000 --> 0:14:06,000
for psychedelic psychotherapy for personal growth,

265
0:14:06.335,000 --> 0:14:07,000
for couples therapy

266
0:14:08.272,000 --> 0:14:11,000
or for spiritual, mystical experiences.

267
0:14:12.924,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Humanity now is in a race between catastrophe and consciousness.

268
0:14:20.392,000 --> 0:14:25,000
The psychedelic renaissance is here to help consciousness triumph.

269
0:14:26.243,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And now, if you all just look under your seats ...

270
0:14:30.243,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Just joking!

271
0:14:31.426,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Laughter)

272
0:14:32.608,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Thank you.

273
0:14:33.806,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Applause)

274
0:14:35.593,000 --> 0:14:36,000
(Laughter)

275
0:14:36.775,000 --> 0:14:4,000
(Applause)

276
0:14:41.792,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Thank you.

277
0:14:42.982,000 --> 0:14:46,000
(Applause)

278
0:14:48.014,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Corey Hajim: You've got to stay up here for a minute.

279
0:14:50.85,000 --> 0:14:51,000
Thank you so much, Rick.

280
0:14:52.482,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I guess it's a supportive audience.

281
0:14:54.45,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Rick Doblin: Yes, very.

282
0:14:57.84,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Many of them have also been to Burning Man.

283
0:14:59.927,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Laughter)

284
0:15:01.514,000 --> 0:15:02,000
CH: There's some synergy.

285
0:15:03.244,000 --> 0:15:04,000
RD: (Laughs)

286
0:15:04.421,000 --> 0:15:08,000
CH: So, in your talk, you talked about using these drugs

287
0:15:08.546,000 --> 0:15:1,000
to address some pretty serious traumas.

288
0:15:10.989,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So what about some more common mental illnesses

289
0:15:14.038,000 --> 0:15:15,000
like anxiety and depression,

290
0:15:15.8,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and is that where microdosing comes in?

291
0:15:18.427,000 --> 0:15:2,000
RD: Well, microdosing can be helpful for depression,

292
0:15:21.204,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I do know someone that has been using it.

293
0:15:23.585,000 --> 0:15:26,000
But in general, for therapeutic purposes,

294
0:15:26.736,000 --> 0:15:29,000
we prefer macro-dosing rather than microdosing,

295
0:15:29.823,000 --> 0:15:31,000
in order to really help people deal with the root causes.

296
0:15:32.601,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Microdosing is more for creativity,

297
0:15:35.133,000 --> 0:15:36,000
for artistic inspiration,

298
0:15:37.151,000 --> 0:15:38,000
for focus ...

299
0:15:38.918,000 --> 0:15:41,000
And it also does have a mood-elevation lift.

300
0:15:42.336,000 --> 0:15:43,000
But I think for serious illnesses,

301
0:15:43.982,000 --> 0:15:46,000
we'd rather not get people thinking that they need a daily drug,

302
0:15:47.061,000 --> 0:15:49,000
but do more deeper, intense work.

303
0:15:49.458,000 --> 0:15:52,000
CH: And what about outside the United States and North America,

304
0:15:53.357,000 --> 0:15:54,000
is this research being done there?

305
0:15:55.061,000 --> 0:15:57,000
RD: Oh yeah, we're globalizing.

306
0:15:57.974,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Our Phase 3 studies are actually being done

307
0:16:00.284,000 --> 0:16:02,000
in Israel, Canada and the United States.

308
0:16:02.721,000 --> 0:16:03,000
So once we get approval in FDA,

309
0:16:04.373,000 --> 0:16:07,000
it will also become approved in Israel and in Canada.

310
0:16:07.729,000 --> 0:16:1,000
We're just starting research in Europe.

311
0:16:10.927,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And we're actually going to be training some therapists from China.

312
0:16:15.506,000 --> 0:16:16,000
CH: That's great.

313
0:16:16.681,000 --> 0:16:17,000
We were going to do an audience vote

314
0:16:18.436,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to see if people felt like this was a good idea

315
0:16:20.682,000 --> 0:16:22,000
to move forward with this research or not,

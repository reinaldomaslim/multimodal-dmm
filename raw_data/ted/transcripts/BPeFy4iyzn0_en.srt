1
0:00:12.489,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is a talk about sugar and cancer.

2
0:00:15.709,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I became interested in sugar when I was in college.

3
0:00:19.01,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Not this kind of sugar.

4
0:00:20.886,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It was the sugar that our biology professors taught us about

5
0:00:25.861,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in the context of the coating of your cells.

6
0:00:30.553,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Maybe you didn't know that your cells are coated with sugar.

7
0:00:34.687,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And I didn't know that, either,

8
0:00:36.286,000 --> 0:00:38,000
until I took these courses in college,

9
0:00:38.465,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but back then --

10
0:00:39.901,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and this was in, let's just call it the 1980s --

11
0:00:44.38,000 --> 0:00:48,000
people didn't know much about why our cells are coated with sugar.

12
0:00:48.658,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And when I dug through my notes, what I noticed I had written down

13
0:00:52.649,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is that the sugar coating on our cells is like the sugar coating

14
0:00:57.218,000 --> 0:00:58,000
on a peanut M and M.

15
0:00:59.018,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And people thought the sugar coating on our cells

16
0:01:02.708,000 --> 0:01:03,000
was like a protective coating

17
0:01:04.562,000 --> 0:01:07,000
that somehow made our cells stronger or tougher.

18
0:01:08.754,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But we now know, many decades later,

19
0:01:10.904,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that it's much more complicated than that,

20
0:01:13.726,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and that the sugars on our cells are actually very complex.

21
0:01:19.003,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And if you could shrink yourself down to a little miniature airplane

22
0:01:24.539,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and fly right along the surface of your cells,

23
0:01:28.345,000 --> 0:01:3,000
it might look something like this --

24
0:01:30.735,000 --> 0:01:32,000
with geographical features.

25
0:01:32.96,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And now, the complex sugars are these trees and bushes --

26
0:01:37.014,000 --> 0:01:39,000
weeping willows that are swaying in the wind

27
0:01:39.57,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and moving with the waves.

28
0:01:41.631,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And when I started thinking about all these complex sugars

29
0:01:45.468,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that are like this foliage on our cells,

30
0:01:48.418,000 --> 0:01:51,000
it became one of the most interesting problems that I encountered

31
0:01:51.559,000 --> 0:01:54,000
as a biologist and also as a chemist.

32
0:01:55.477,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And so now we tend to think about the sugars

33
0:01:58.436,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that are populating the surface of our cells

34
0:02:01.728,000 --> 0:02:02,000
as a language.

35
0:02:04.162,000 --> 0:02:07,000
They have a lot of information stored in their complex structures.

36
0:02:08.962,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But what are they trying to tell us?

37
0:02:12.368,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I can tell you that we do know some information

38
0:02:15.707,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that comes from these sugars,

39
0:02:17.336,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and it's turned out already to be incredibly important

40
0:02:20.295,000 --> 0:02:21,000
in the world of medicine.

41
0:02:22.597,000 --> 0:02:25,000
For example, one thing your sugars are telling us

42
0:02:26.282,000 --> 0:02:27,000
is your blood type.

43
0:02:28.861,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So your blood cells, your red blood cells, are coated with sugars,

44
0:02:33.039,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and the chemical structures of those sugars determine your blood type.

45
0:02:37.74,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So for example, I know that I am blood type O.

46
0:02:41.687,000 --> 0:02:44,000
How many people are also blood type O?

47
0:02:44.822,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Put your hands up.

48
0:02:46.004,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It's a pretty common one,

49
0:02:47.221,000 --> 0:02:49,000
so when so few hands go up, either you're not paying attention

50
0:02:50.18,000 --> 0:02:52,000
or you don't know your blood type, and both of those are bad.

51
0:02:53.094,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:54.133,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But for those of you who share the blood type O with me,

53
0:02:56.82,000 --> 0:02:58,000
what this means is that we have this chemical structure

54
0:02:59.559,000 --> 0:03:01,000
on the surface of our blood cells:

55
0:03:02.116,000 --> 0:03:05,000
three simple sugars linked together to make a more complex sugar.

56
0:03:05.863,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And that, by definition, is blood type O.

57
0:03:09.186,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Now, how many people are blood type A?

58
0:03:12.394,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Right here.

59
0:03:13.587,000 --> 0:03:15,000
That means you have an enzyme in your cells

60
0:03:16.572,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that adds one more building block,

61
0:03:19.012,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that red sugar,

62
0:03:20.411,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to build a more complex structure.

63
0:03:22.936,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And how many people are blood type B?

64
0:03:26.118,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Quite a few.

65
0:03:27.307,000 --> 0:03:29,000
You have a slightly different enzyme than the A people,

66
0:03:30.059,000 --> 0:03:32,000
so you build a slightly different structure,

67
0:03:32.199,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and those of you that are AB

68
0:03:34.336,000 --> 0:03:37,000
have the enzyme from your mother, the other enzyme from your father,

69
0:03:37.552,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and now you make both of these structures in roughly equal proportions.

70
0:03:41.351,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And when this was figured out,

71
0:03:43.779,000 --> 0:03:45,000
which is now back in the previous century,

72
0:03:46.541,000 --> 0:03:49,000
this enabled one of the most important medical procedures in the world,

73
0:03:50.082,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which, of course, is the blood transfusion.

74
0:03:52.484,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And by knowing what your blood type is,

75
0:03:54.404,000 --> 0:03:56,000
we can make sure, if you ever need a transfusion,

76
0:03:57.02,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that your donor has the same blood type,

77
0:03:59.565,000 --> 0:04:02,000
so that your body doesn't see foreign sugars,

78
0:04:03.603,000 --> 0:04:05,000
which it wouldn't like and would certainly reject.

79
0:04:07.933,000 --> 0:04:11,000
What else are the sugars on the surface of your cells trying to tell us?

80
0:04:12.932,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Well, those sugars might be telling us that you have cancer.

81
0:04:18.528,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So a few decades ago,

82
0:04:20.804,000 --> 0:04:25,000
correlations began to emerge from the analysis of tumor tissue.

83
0:04:26.221,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And the typical scenario is a patient would have a tumor detected,

84
0:04:30.756,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and the tissue would be removed in a biopsy procedure

85
0:04:34.608,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and then sent down to a pathology lab

86
0:04:37.402,000 --> 0:04:41,000
where that tissue would be analyzed to look for chemical changes

87
0:04:41.557,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that might inform the oncologist about the best course of treatment.

88
0:04:46.799,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And what was discovered from studies like that

89
0:04:49.707,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is that the sugars have changed

90
0:04:52.595,000 --> 0:04:56,000
when the cell transforms from being healthy to being sick.

91
0:04:58.643,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And those correlations have come up again and again and again.

92
0:05:04.317,000 --> 0:05:08,000
But a big question in the field has been: Why?

93
0:05:08.807,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Why do cancers have different sugars? What's the importance of that?

94
0:05:13.075,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Why does it happen, and what can we do about it if it does turn out

95
0:05:16.46,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to be related to the disease process?

96
0:05:21.603,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So, one of the changes that we study

97
0:05:24.838,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is an increase in the density of a particular sugar

98
0:05:30.407,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that's called sialic acid.

99
0:05:33.437,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And I think this is going to be one of the most important sugars

100
0:05:37.385,000 --> 0:05:38,000
of our times,

101
0:05:38.567,000 --> 0:05:42,000
so I would encourage everybody to get familiar with this word.

102
0:05:43.322,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Sialic acid is not the kind of sugar that we eat.

103
0:05:46.311,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Those are different sugars.

104
0:05:48.422,000 --> 0:05:5,000
This is a kind of sugar that is actually found

105
0:05:51.41,000 --> 0:05:54,000
at certain levels on all of the cells in your body.

106
0:05:54.562,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It's actually quite common on your cells.

107
0:05:58.213,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But for some reason,

108
0:06:00.271,000 --> 0:06:05,000
cancer cells, at least in a successful, progressive disease,

109
0:06:05.783,000 --> 0:06:08,000
tend to have more sialic acid

110
0:06:08.916,000 --> 0:06:1,000
than a normal, healthy cell would have.

111
0:06:11.287,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And why?

112
0:06:12.753,000 --> 0:06:13,000
What does that mean?

113
0:06:15.096,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Well, what we've learned

114
0:06:16.572,000 --> 0:06:19,000
is that it has to do with your immune system.

115
0:06:20.755,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So let me tell you a little bit about the importance of your immune system

116
0:06:24.345,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in cancer.

117
0:06:25.533,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And this is something that's, I think, in the news a lot these days.

118
0:06:29.075,000 --> 0:06:31,000
You know, people are starting to become familiar with the term

119
0:06:32.005,000 --> 0:06:34,000
"cancer immune therapy."

120
0:06:34.791,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And some of you might even know people

121
0:06:36.626,000 --> 0:06:39,000
who are benefiting from these very new ways of treating cancer.

122
0:06:41.668,000 --> 0:06:44,000
What we now know is that your immune cells,

123
0:06:44.933,000 --> 0:06:47,000
which are the white blood cells coursing through your bloodstream,

124
0:06:48.891,000 --> 0:06:52,000
protect you on a daily basis from things gone bad --

125
0:06:53.571,000 --> 0:06:54,000
including cancer.

126
0:06:55.771,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And so in this picture,

127
0:06:57.786,000 --> 0:06:59,000
those little green balls are your immune cells,

128
0:07:00.531,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and that big pink cell is a cancer cell.

129
0:07:04.07,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And these immune cells go around and taste all the cells in your body.

130
0:07:08.859,000 --> 0:07:09,000
That's their job.

131
0:07:10.733,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And most of the time, the cells taste OK.

132
0:07:13.512,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But once in a while, a cell might taste bad.

133
0:07:16.564,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Hopefully, that's the cancer cell,

134
0:07:18.399,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and when those immune cells get the bad taste,

135
0:07:20.806,000 --> 0:07:22,000
they launch an all-out strike and kill those cells.

136
0:07:24.45,000 --> 0:07:25,000
So we know that.

137
0:07:25.627,000 --> 0:07:29,000
We also know that if you can potentiate that tasting,

138
0:07:30.067,000 --> 0:07:33,000
if you can encourage those immune cells to actually take a big old bite

139
0:07:33.919,000 --> 0:07:34,000
out of a cancer cell,

140
0:07:35.186,000 --> 0:07:38,000
you get a better job protecting yourself from cancer every day

141
0:07:38.801,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and maybe even curing a cancer.

142
0:07:41.329,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And there are now a couple of drugs out there in the market

143
0:07:44.199,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that are used to treat cancer patients

144
0:07:46.294,000 --> 0:07:48,000
that act exactly by this process.

145
0:07:49.546,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They activate the immune system

146
0:07:51.199,000 --> 0:07:53,000
so that the immune system can be more vigorous

147
0:07:53.97,000 --> 0:07:54,000
in protecting us from cancer.

148
0:07:55.746,000 --> 0:07:57,000
In fact, one of those drugs

149
0:07:57.813,000 --> 0:07:59,000
may well have spared President Jimmy Carter's life.

150
0:08:01.336,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Do you remember, President Carter had malignant melanoma

151
0:08:05.84,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that had metastasized to his brain,

152
0:08:08.722,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and that diagnosis is one that is usually accompanied by numbers

153
0:08:12.1,000 --> 0:08:13,000
like "months to live."

154
0:08:14.913,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But he was treated with one of these new immune-stimulating drugs,

155
0:08:19.332,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and now his melanoma appears to be in remission,

156
0:08:22.715,000 --> 0:08:23,000
which is remarkable,

157
0:08:24.38,000 --> 0:08:27,000
considering the situation only a few years ago.

158
0:08:27.845,000 --> 0:08:28,000
In fact, it's so remarkable

159
0:08:29.689,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that provocative statements like this one:

160
0:08:32.513,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"Cancer is having a penicillin moment," people are saying,

161
0:08:36.252,000 --> 0:08:37,000
with these new immune therapy drugs.

162
0:08:38.097,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I mean, that's an incredibly bold thing to say about a disease

163
0:08:41.319,000 --> 0:08:43,000
which we've been fighting for a long time

164
0:08:43.992,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and mostly losing the battle with.

165
0:08:46.675,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So this is very exciting.

166
0:08:48.727,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Now what does this have to do with sugars?

167
0:08:51.163,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Well, I'll tell you what we've learned.

168
0:08:54.764,000 --> 0:09:,000
When an immune cell snuggles up against a cancer cell to take a taste,

169
0:09:01.124,000 --> 0:09:03,000
it's looking for signs of disease,

170
0:09:03.797,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and if it finds those signs,

171
0:09:05.74,000 --> 0:09:09,000
the cell gets activated and it launches a missile strike and kills the cell.

172
0:09:11.089,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But if that cancer cell has a dense forest of that sugar, sialic acid,

173
0:09:17.551,000 --> 0:09:19,000
well, it starts to taste pretty good.

174
0:09:21.327,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And there's a protein on immune cells that grabs the sialic acid,

175
0:09:25.995,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and if that protein gets held at that synapse

176
0:09:29.82,000 --> 0:09:31,000
between the immune cell and the cancer cell,

177
0:09:32.991,000 --> 0:09:33,000
it puts that immune cell to sleep.

178
0:09:35.629,000 --> 0:09:38,000
The sialic acids are telling the immune cell,

179
0:09:38.955,000 --> 0:09:41,000
"Hey, this cell's all right. Nothing to see here, move along.

180
0:09:42.18,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Look somewhere else."

181
0:09:44.561,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So in other words,

182
0:09:45.807,000 --> 0:09:49,000
as long as our cells are wearing a thick coat of sialic acid,

183
0:09:51.219,000 --> 0:09:53,000
they look fabulous, right?

184
0:09:53.856,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It's amazing.

185
0:09:56.344,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And what if you could strip off that coat

186
0:09:59.522,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and take that sugar away?

187
0:10:01.844,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Well, your immune system

188
0:10:04.867,000 --> 0:10:08,000
might be able to see that cancer cell for what it really is:

189
0:10:09.092,000 --> 0:10:11,000
something that needs to be destroyed.

190
0:10:12.695,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And so this is what we're doing in my lab.

191
0:10:15.524,000 --> 0:10:17,000
We're developing new medicines

192
0:10:17.87,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that are basically cell-surface lawnmowers --

193
0:10:21.681,000 --> 0:10:24,000
molecules that go down to the surface of these cancer cells

194
0:10:25.358,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and just cut off those sialic acids,

195
0:10:28.247,000 --> 0:10:32,000
so that the immune system can reach its full potential

196
0:10:32.576,000 --> 0:10:34,000
in eliminating those cancer cells from our body.

197
0:10:36.803,000 --> 0:10:38,000
So in closing,

198
0:10:39.639,000 --> 0:10:41,000
let me just remind you again:

199
0:10:41.816,000 --> 0:10:43,000
your cells are coated with sugars.

200
0:10:44.792,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The sugars are telling cells around that cell

201
0:10:49.511,000 --> 0:10:5,000
whether the cell is good or bad.

202
0:10:52.502,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And that's important,

203
0:10:53.691,000 --> 0:10:56,000
because our immune system needs to leave the good cells alone.

204
0:10:56.771,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Otherwise, we'd have autoimmune diseases.

205
0:11:00.135,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But once in a while, cancers get the ability

206
0:11:03.307,000 --> 0:11:04,000
to express these new sugars.

207
0:11:04.887,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And now that we understand

208
0:11:06.243,000 --> 0:11:09,000
how those sugars mesmerize the immune system,

209
0:11:09.427,000 --> 0:11:13,000
we can come up with new medicines to wake up those immune cells,

210
0:11:13.636,000 --> 0:11:16,000
tell them, "Ignore the sugars, eat the cell

211
0:11:16.887,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and have a delicious snack, on cancer."

212
0:11:20.394,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Thank you.

213
0:11:21.893,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Applause)

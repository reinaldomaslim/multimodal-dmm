2
0:00:12.838,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I think the beautiful Malin [Akerman] put it perfectly.

3
0:00:14.812,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Every man deserves the opportunity

4
0:00:17.152,000 --> 0:00:19,000
to grow a little bit of luxury.

5
0:00:19.775,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Ladies and gentlemen, and more importantly,

6
0:00:21.605,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Mo Bros and Mo Sistas — (Laughter) —

7
0:00:24.458,000 --> 0:00:26,000
for the next 17 minutes, I'm going to share with you

8
0:00:26.994,000 --> 0:00:29,000
my Movember journey, and how, through that journey,

9
0:00:30.645,000 --> 0:00:33,000
we've redefined charity, we're redefining the way

10
0:00:33.816,000 --> 0:00:36,000
prostate cancer researchers are working together

11
0:00:36.954,000 --> 0:00:39,000
throughout the world, and I hope, through that process,

12
0:00:40.706,000 --> 0:00:43,000
that I inspire you to create something significant

13
0:00:44.077,000 --> 0:00:47,000
in your life, something significant that will go on

14
0:00:47.659,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and make this world a better place.

15
0:00:51.242,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So the most common question I get asked,

16
0:00:54.171,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and I'm going to answer it now so I don't have to do it

17
0:00:56.359,000 --> 0:01:,000
over drinks tonight, is how did this come about?

18
0:01:00.832,000 --> 0:01:02,000
How did Movember start?

19
0:01:03.395,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Well, normally, a charity starts with the cause, and someone

20
0:01:06.132,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that is directly affected by a cause.

21
0:01:09.194,000 --> 0:01:12,000
They then go on to create an event, and beyond that,

22
0:01:12.378,000 --> 0:01:15,000
a foundation to support that.

23
0:01:15.548,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Pretty much in every case, that's how a charity starts.

24
0:01:20.251,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Not so with Movember. Movember started in a very

25
0:01:23.682,000 --> 0:01:26,000
traditional Australian way. It was on a Sunday afternoon.

26
0:01:27.46,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I was with my brother and a mate having a few beers,

27
0:01:30.048,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and I was watching the world go by,

28
0:01:32.219,000 --> 0:01:34,000
had a few more beers, and the conversation turned

29
0:01:34.628,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to '70s fashion — (Laughter) —

30
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and how everything manages to come back into style.

31
0:01:41.908,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And a few more beers, I said, "There has to be some stuff

32
0:01:44.204,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that hasn't come back." (Laughter)

33
0:01:49.042,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Then one more beer and it was, whatever happened to the mustache?

34
0:01:52.564,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Why hasn't that made a comeback? (Laughter)

35
0:01:56.948,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So then there was a lot more beers, and then the day ended

36
0:01:58.501,000 --> 0:02:03,000
with a challenge to bring the mustache back. (Laughter)

37
0:02:03.711,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So in Australia, "mo" is slang for mustache,

38
0:02:06.444,000 --> 0:02:09,000
so we renamed the month of November "Movember"

39
0:02:09.452,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and created some pretty basic rules, which still stand today.

40
0:02:12.399,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And they are: start the month clean-shaven,

41
0:02:15.166,000 --> 0:02:18,000
rock a mustache -- not a beard, not a goatee, a mustache --

42
0:02:18.42,000 --> 0:02:2,000
for the 30 days of November, and then we agreed

43
0:02:21.195,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that we would come together at the end of the month,

44
0:02:23.697,000 --> 0:02:27,000
have a mustache-themed party, and award a prize

45
0:02:27.709,000 --> 0:02:31,000
for the best, and of course, the worst mustache. (Laughter)

46
0:02:32.531,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now trust me, when you're growing a mustache

47
0:02:34.005,000 --> 0:02:37,000
back in 2003, and there were 30 of us back then,

48
0:02:37.21,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and this was before the ironic hipster mustache movement

49
0:02:41.25,000 --> 0:02:45,000
— (Laughter) —

50
0:02:45.714,000 --> 0:02:49,000
it created a lot of controversy. (Laughter)

51
0:02:50.251,000 --> 0:02:52,000
So my boss wouldn't let me go and see clients.

52
0:02:52.546,000 --> 0:02:58,000
My girlfriend at the time, who's no longer my girlfriend — (Laughter) — hated it.

53
0:02:58.882,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Parents would shuffle kids away from us. (Laughter)

54
0:03:04.542,000 --> 0:03:05,000
But we came together at the end of the month and

55
0:03:05.989,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we celebrated our journey, and it was a real journey.

56
0:03:09.277,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And we had a lot of fun, and in 2004, I said to the guys,

57
0:03:14.049,000 --> 0:03:17,000
"That was so much fun. We need to legitimize this

58
0:03:17.236,000 --> 0:03:21,000
so we can get away with it year on year." (Laughter)

59
0:03:22.019,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So we started thinking about that, and we were inspired

60
0:03:25.858,000 --> 0:03:28,000
by the women around us and all they were doing for breast cancer.

61
0:03:28.946,000 --> 0:03:3,000
And we thought, you know what, there's nothing for men's health.

62
0:03:31.407,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Why is that? Why can't we combine growing a mustache

63
0:03:35.32,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and doing something for men's health?

64
0:03:36.812,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And I started to research that topic, and discovered

65
0:03:39.476,000 --> 0:03:41,000
prostate cancer is the male equivalent of breast cancer

66
0:03:42.39,000 --> 0:03:44,000
in terms of the number of men that die from it and are diagnosed with it.

67
0:03:45.351,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But there was nothing for this cause,

68
0:03:47.919,000 --> 0:03:51,000
so we married growing a mustache with prostate cancer,

69
0:03:52.074,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and then we created our tagline, which is,

70
0:03:54.18,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"Changing the face of men's health."

71
0:03:56.189,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And that eloquently describes the challenge,

72
0:03:58.928,000 --> 0:04:,000
changing your appearance for the 30 days,

73
0:04:01.039,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and also the outcome that we're trying to achieve:

74
0:04:02.859,000 --> 0:04:04,000
getting men engaged in their health, having them have

75
0:04:05.495,000 --> 0:04:09,000
a better understanding about the health risks that they face.

76
0:04:09.799,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So with that model, I then

77
0:04:12.479,000 --> 0:04:14,000
cold-called the CEO of the Prostate Cancer Foundation.

78
0:04:15.158,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I said to him, "I've got the most amazing idea

79
0:04:17.525,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that's going to transform your organization." (Laughter)

80
0:04:20.719,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And I didn't want to share with him the idea over the phone,

81
0:04:23.138,000 --> 0:04:25,000
so I convinced him to meet with me for coffee in Melbourne

82
0:04:25.494,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in 2004.

83
0:04:27.206,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And we sat down, and I shared with him my vision

84
0:04:30.399,000 --> 0:04:32,000
of getting men growing mustaches across Australia,

85
0:04:33.119,000 --> 0:04:35,000
raising awareness for this cause,

86
0:04:35.831,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and funds for his organization. And I needed a partnership

87
0:04:38.463,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to legitimately do that.

88
0:04:41.04,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And I said, "We're going to come together at the end,

89
0:04:42.641,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we're going to have a mustache-themed party, we're going to have DJs,

90
0:04:45.311,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we're going to celebrate life, and we're going to change the face of men's health."

91
0:04:49.114,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And he just looked at me and laughed, and he said,

92
0:04:51.891,000 --> 0:04:54,000
he said, "Adam, that's a really novel idea,

93
0:04:55.526,000 --> 0:04:57,000
but we're an ultraconservative organization.

94
0:04:58.031,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We can't have anything to do with you." (Laughter)

95
0:05:02.847,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So I paid for coffee that day — (Laughter) —

96
0:05:07.207,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and his parting comment as we shook hands was,

97
0:05:10.21,000 --> 0:05:12,000
"Listen, if you happen to raise any money out of this,

98
0:05:12.873,000 --> 0:05:16,000
we'll gladly take it." (Laughter)

99
0:05:17.427,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So my lesson that year was persistence.

100
0:05:21.151,000 --> 0:05:25,000
And we persisted, and we got 450 guys

101
0:05:25.551,000 --> 0:05:3,000
growing mustaches, and together we raised 54,000 dollars,

102
0:05:30.719,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and we donated every cent of that to the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia,

103
0:05:33.751,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and that represented at the time the single biggest donation

104
0:05:36.857,000 --> 0:05:38,000
they'd ever received.

105
0:05:39.413,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So from that day forward, my life has become about a mustache.

106
0:05:44.014,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Every day -- this morning, I wake up and go, my life

107
0:05:46.603,000 --> 0:05:49,000
is about a mustache. (Laughter)

108
0:05:50.58,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Essentially, I'm a mustache farmer. (Laughter)

109
0:05:55.563,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And my season is November. (Applause)

110
0:05:58.828,000 --> 0:06:01,000
(Applause)

111
0:06:01.919,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So in 2005, the campaign got more momentum,

112
0:06:05.828,000 --> 0:06:07,000
was more successful in Australia and then New Zealand,

113
0:06:08.269,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and then in 2006 we came to a pivotal point.

114
0:06:13.027,000 --> 0:06:16,000
It was consuming so much of our time after hours

115
0:06:16.764,000 --> 0:06:19,000
on weekends that we thought, we either need

116
0:06:19.889,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to close this down or figure a way to fund Movember

117
0:06:23.203,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so that I could quit my job and go and spend more time

118
0:06:26.036,000 --> 0:06:29,000
in the organization and take it to the next level.

119
0:06:29.866,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's really interesting when you try and figure a way

120
0:06:32.724,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to fund a fundraising organization

121
0:06:34.865,000 --> 0:06:36,000
built off growing mustaches. (Laughter)

122
0:06:37.32,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Let me tell you that there's not too many people interested

123
0:06:39.691,000 --> 0:06:43,000
in investing in that, not even the Prostate Cancer Foundation,

124
0:06:43.723,000 --> 0:06:46,000
who we'd raised about 1.2 million dollars for at that stage.

125
0:06:46.988,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So again we persisted, and Foster's Brewing came to the party

126
0:06:51.123,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and gave us our first ever sponsorship,

127
0:06:54.263,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and that was enough for me to quit my job, I did consulting on the side.

128
0:06:58.836,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And leading into Movember 2006,

129
0:07:03.802,000 --> 0:07:05,000
we'd run through all the money from Foster's,

130
0:07:06.387,000 --> 0:07:09,000
we'd run through all the money I had, and essentially

131
0:07:09.545,000 --> 0:07:12,000
we had no money left, and we'd convinced all our suppliers --

132
0:07:12.643,000 --> 0:07:14,000
creative agencies, web development agencies,

133
0:07:14.836,000 --> 0:07:18,000
hosting companies, whatnot -- to delay their billing until December.

134
0:07:19.289,000 --> 0:07:22,000
So we'd racked up at this stage about 600,000 dollars

135
0:07:22.319,000 --> 0:07:26,000
worth of debt. So if Movember 2006 didn't happen,

136
0:07:26.574,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the four founders, well, we would've been broke,

137
0:07:29.944,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we would've been homeless, sitting on the street

138
0:07:31.637,000 --> 0:07:33,000
with mustaches. (Laughter)

139
0:07:34.495,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But we thought, you know what, if that's the worst thing

140
0:07:36.4,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that happens, so what?

141
0:07:38.645,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We're going to have a lot of fun doing it, and it taught us

142
0:07:40.407,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the importance of taking risks and really smart risks.

143
0:07:44.905,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Then in early 2007, a really interesting thing happened.

144
0:07:49.168,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We had Mo Bros from Canada, from the U.S.,

145
0:07:52.887,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and from the U.K. emailing us and calling us and saying,

146
0:07:55.831,000 --> 0:07:56,000
hey, there's nothing for prostate cancer.

147
0:07:57.815,000 --> 0:08:,000
Bring this campaign to these countries.

148
0:08:01.317,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So we thought, why not? Let's do it.

149
0:08:03.679,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So I cold-called the CEO of Prostate Cancer Canada,

150
0:08:06.809,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and I said to him, "I have this most amazing concept."

151
0:08:10.335,000 --> 0:08:11,000
(Laughter)

152
0:08:12.103,000 --> 0:08:15,000
"It's going to transform your organization. I don't want

153
0:08:15.15,000 --> 0:08:16,000
to tell you about it now, but will you meet with me

154
0:08:16.614,000 --> 0:08:19,000
if I fly all the way to Toronto?" So I flew here,

155
0:08:20.023,000 --> 0:08:23,000
met down on Front Street East, and we sat in the boardroom,

156
0:08:23.151,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and I said, "Right, here's my vision of getting men growing mustaches

157
0:08:27.228,000 --> 0:08:31,000
all across Canada raising awareness and funds for your organization."

158
0:08:31.999,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And he looked at me and laughed and said,

159
0:08:33.24,000 --> 0:08:35,000
"Adam, sounds like a really novel idea, but we're

160
0:08:35.598,000 --> 0:08:37,000
an ultraconservative organization." (Laughter)

161
0:08:38.493,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I've heard this before. I know how it goes.

162
0:08:41.5,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But he said, "We will partner with you,

163
0:08:43.974,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but we're not going to invest in it. You need to figure

164
0:08:47.192,000 --> 0:08:49,000
a way to bring this campaign across here and make it work."

165
0:08:50.063,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So what we did was, we took some of the money that

166
0:08:51.976,000 --> 0:08:53,000
we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across

167
0:08:54.079,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to this country, the U.S, and the U.K., and we did that

168
0:08:56.68,000 --> 0:08:58,000
because we knew, if this was successful,

169
0:08:59.136,000 --> 0:09:01,000
we could raise infinitely more money globally

170
0:09:01.744,000 --> 0:09:03,000
than we could just in Australia. And that money

171
0:09:04.279,000 --> 0:09:07,000
fuels research, and that research will get us to a cure.

172
0:09:07.365,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And we're not about finding an Australian cure

173
0:09:09.119,000 --> 0:09:13,000
or a Canadian cure, we're about finding the cure.

174
0:09:13.498,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So in 2007, we brought the campaign across here,

175
0:09:17.806,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and it was, it set the stage for the campaign.

176
0:09:22.351,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It wasn't as successful as we thought it would be.

177
0:09:24.384,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We were sort of very gung ho with our success in Australia

178
0:09:27.034,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and New Zealand at that stage.

179
0:09:29.855,000 --> 0:09:32,000
So that year really taught us the importance of being patient

180
0:09:33.359,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and really understanding the local market before you

181
0:09:35.647,000 --> 0:09:38,000
become so bold as to set lofty targets.

182
0:09:39.295,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But what I'm really pleased to say is, in 2010,

183
0:09:43.319,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Movember became a truly global movement.

184
0:09:45.923,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Canada was just pipped to the post in terms of

185
0:09:48.199,000 --> 0:09:5,000
the number one fundraising campaign in the world.

186
0:09:50.871,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Last year we had 450,000 Mo Bros spread across the world

187
0:09:56.003,000 --> 0:10:,000
and together we raised 77 million dollars.

188
0:10:00.055,000 --> 0:10:07,000
(Applause)

189
0:10:07.963,000 --> 0:10:09,000
And that makes Movember now the biggest funder

190
0:10:10.302,000 --> 0:10:14,000
of prostate cancer research and support programs in the world.

191
0:10:14.545,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And that is an amazing achievement when you think about

192
0:10:16.894,000 --> 0:10:19,000
us growing mustaches. (Laughter)

193
0:10:20.63,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And for us, we have redefined charity.

194
0:10:22.646,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Our ribbon is a hairy ribbon. (Laughter)

195
0:10:28.022,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Our ambassadors are the Mo Bros and the Mo Sistas,

196
0:10:30.379,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and I think that's been fundamental to our success.

197
0:10:33.574,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We hand across our brand and our campaign to those people.

198
0:10:37.678,000 --> 0:10:4,000
We let them embrace it and interpret it in their own way.

199
0:10:41.622,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So now I live in Los Angeles, because

200
0:10:44.221,000 --> 0:10:46,000
the Prostate Cancer Foundation of the U.S. is based there,

201
0:10:46.99,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and I always get asked by the media down there,

202
0:10:49.518,000 --> 0:10:51,000
because it's so celebrity-driven,

203
0:10:52.054,000 --> 0:10:54,000
"Who are your celebrity ambassadors?"

204
0:10:54.821,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And I say to them, "Last year we were fortunate enough

205
0:10:57.622,000 --> 0:11:,000
to have 450,000 celebrity ambassadors."

206
0:11:01.084,000 --> 0:11:02,000
And they go, "What, what do you mean?"

207
0:11:02.324,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And it's like, everything single person, every single Mo Bro

208
0:11:05.286,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and Mo Sista that participates in Movember

209
0:11:07.877,000 --> 0:11:1,000
is our celebrity ambassador, and that is so, so important

210
0:11:11.367,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and fundamental to our success.

211
0:11:14.286,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Now what I want to share with you is

212
0:11:16.958,000 --> 0:11:2,000
one of my most touching Movember moments,

213
0:11:20.958,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and it happened here in Toronto last year,

214
0:11:23.798,000 --> 0:11:25,000
at the end of the campaign.

215
0:11:26.278,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I was out with a team. It was the end of Movember.

216
0:11:29.719,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We'd had a great campaign, and to be honest, we'd had

217
0:11:32.472,000 --> 0:11:34,000
our fair share of beer that night, but I said,

218
0:11:35.246,000 --> 0:11:38,000
"You know what, I think we've got one more bar left in us." (Laughter)

219
0:11:38.713,000 --> 0:11:41,000
So we piled into a taxi, and this is our taxi driver,

220
0:11:42.118,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and I was sitting in the back seat, and he turned around

221
0:11:44.31,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and said, "Where are you going?"

222
0:11:45.854,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And I said, "Hang on, that is an amazing mustache."

223
0:11:48.936,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

224
0:11:53.343,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And he said, "I'm doing it for Movember." And I said,

225
0:11:55.279,000 --> 0:11:59,000
"So am I." And I said, "Tell me your Movember story."

226
0:11:59.589,000 --> 0:12:,000
And he goes, "Listen, I know it's about men's health,

227
0:12:01.565,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I know it's about prostate cancer, but this is for breast cancer."

228
0:12:04.627,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And I said, "Okay, that's interesting."

229
0:12:06.275,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And he goes, "Last year, my mom passed away from breast cancer in Sri Lanka,

230
0:12:09.832,000 --> 0:12:12,000
because we couldn't afford proper treatment for her,"

231
0:12:13.198,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and he said, "This mustache is my tribute to my mom."

232
0:12:17.51,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And we sort of all choked up in the back of the taxi,

233
0:12:20.338,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and I didn't tell him who I was, because I didn't think it was appropriate,

234
0:12:22.871,000 --> 0:12:23,000
and I just shook his hand and I said, "Thank you so much.

235
0:12:24.814,000 --> 0:12:25,000
Your mom would be so proud."

236
0:12:26.158,000 --> 0:12:27,000
And from that moment I realized that Movember

237
0:12:28.086,000 --> 0:12:31,000
is so much more than a mustache, having a joke.

238
0:12:31.124,000 --> 0:12:34,000
It's about each person coming to this platform,

239
0:12:34.833,000 --> 0:12:36,000
embracing it in their own way,

240
0:12:36.963,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and being significant in their own life.

241
0:12:40.036,000 --> 0:12:45,000
For us now at Movember, we really focus on

242
0:12:45.311,000 --> 0:12:49,000
three program areas, and having a true impact:

243
0:12:49.583,000 --> 0:12:51,000
awareness and education,

244
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:54,000
survivor support programs, and research.

245
0:12:54.787,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Now we always focus, naturally, on how much we raise,

246
0:12:58.332,000 --> 0:13:01,000
because it's a very tangible outcome, but for me,

247
0:13:01.453,000 --> 0:13:05,000
awareness and education is more important than the funds we raise,

248
0:13:05.66,000 --> 0:13:07,000
because I know that is changing and saving lives today,

249
0:13:08.524,000 --> 0:13:1,000
and it's probably best exampled by

250
0:13:10.806,000 --> 0:13:12,000
a young guy that I met at South by Southwest

251
0:13:13.636,000 --> 0:13:15,000
in Austin, Texas, at the start of the year.

252
0:13:16.476,000 --> 0:13:19,000
He came up to me and said, "Thank you for starting Movember."

253
0:13:19.5,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And I said, "Thank you for doing Movember."

254
0:13:21.432,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And I looked at him, and I was like, "I'm pretty sure you can't grow a mustache." (Laughter)

255
0:13:25.292,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And I said, "What's your Movember story?"

256
0:13:27.676,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And he said, "I grew the worst mustache ever." (Laughter)

257
0:13:31.699,000 --> 0:13:33,000
"But I went home for Thanksgiving dinner, and pretty quickly

258
0:13:34.269,000 --> 0:13:36,000
the conversation around the table turned to

259
0:13:36.269,000 --> 0:13:39,000
what the hell was going on." (Laughter)

260
0:13:39.6,000 --> 0:13:43,000
"And we talked -- I talked to them about Movember,

261
0:13:43.748,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and then after that, my dad came up to me, and at the age

262
0:13:46.093,000 --> 0:13:5,000
of 26, for the first time ever, I had a conversation with my dad

263
0:13:50.164,000 --> 0:13:53,000
one on one about men's health. I had a conversation

264
0:13:53.265,000 --> 0:13:56,000
with my dad about prostate cancer, and I learned

265
0:13:56.388,000 --> 0:13:58,000
that my grandfather had prostate cancer

266
0:13:59.174,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and I was able to share with my dad that he was

267
0:14:02.357,000 --> 0:14:05,000
twice as likely to get that disease, and he didn't know that,

268
0:14:05.38,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and he hadn't been getting screened for it."

269
0:14:07.45,000 --> 0:14:1,000
So now, that guy is getting screened for prostate cancer.

270
0:14:10.947,000 --> 0:14:12,000
So those conversations, getting men engaged in this,

271
0:14:13.537,000 --> 0:14:15,000
at whatever age, is so critically important,

272
0:14:16.332,000 --> 0:14:18,000
and in my view so much more important

273
0:14:18.354,000 --> 0:14:21,000
than the funds we raise.

274
0:14:21.469,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Now to the funds we raise, and research,

275
0:14:24.269,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and how we're redefining research.

276
0:14:26.946,000 --> 0:14:3,000
We fund prostate cancer foundations now in 13 countries.

277
0:14:31.584,000 --> 0:14:34,000
We literally fund hundreds if not thousands of institutions

278
0:14:34.989,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and researchers around the world, and when we looked

279
0:14:37.799,000 --> 0:14:41,000
at this more recently, we realized there's a real lack

280
0:14:42.172,000 --> 0:14:46,000
of collaboration going on even within institutions,

281
0:14:46.331,000 --> 0:14:48,000
let alone nationally, let alone globally, and this is not unique

282
0:14:48.684,000 --> 0:14:51,000
to prostate cancer. This is cancer research the world over.

283
0:14:52.104,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And so we said, right, we'd redefined charity. We need

284
0:14:55.722,000 --> 0:14:59,000
to redefine the way these guys operate. How do we do that?

285
0:14:59.773,000 --> 0:15:02,000
So what we did was, we created a global action plan,

286
0:15:03.382,000 --> 0:15:04,000
and we're taking 10 percent of what's raised in each country

287
0:15:05.199,000 --> 0:15:07,000
now and putting it into a global fund, and we've got

288
0:15:07.541,000 --> 0:15:09,000
the best prostate cancer scientific minds in the world

289
0:15:10.277,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that look after that fund,

290
0:15:12.84,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and they come together each year and identify

291
0:15:14.949,000 --> 0:15:16,000
the number one priority,

292
0:15:17.936,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and that, last year, was getting a better screening test.

293
0:15:21.832,000 --> 0:15:23,000
So they identified that as a priority, and then

294
0:15:23.989,000 --> 0:15:25,000
they've got and recruited now 300 researchers

295
0:15:26.618,000 --> 0:15:28,000
from around the world that are studying that topic,

296
0:15:29.302,000 --> 0:15:3,000
essentially the same topic.

297
0:15:31.253,000 --> 0:15:32,000
So now we're funding them to the tune of about

298
0:15:33.014,000 --> 0:15:35,000
five or six million dollars to collaborate

299
0:15:35.797,000 --> 0:15:37,000
and bringing them together, and that's a unique thing

300
0:15:38.405,000 --> 0:15:4,000
in the cancer world, and we know, through that collaboration,

301
0:15:41.381,000 --> 0:15:44,000
it will accelerate outcomes.

302
0:15:44.773,000 --> 0:15:5,000
And that's how we're redefining the research world.

303
0:15:51.033,000 --> 0:15:57,000
So, what I know about my Movember journey is that,

304
0:15:57.677,000 --> 0:16:,000
with a really creative idea,

305
0:16:00.819,000 --> 0:16:04,000
with passion, with persistence, and a lot of patience,

306
0:16:05.236,000 --> 0:16:08,000
four mates, four mustaches,

307
0:16:08.266,000 --> 0:16:1,000
can inspire a room full of people,

308
0:16:10.589,000 --> 0:16:12,000
and that room full of people can go on and inspire a city,

309
0:16:13.502,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and that city is Melbourne, my home.

310
0:16:15.702,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And that city can go on and inspire a state, and that state

311
0:16:18.965,000 --> 0:16:21,000
can go on and inspire a nation, and beyond that,

312
0:16:22.538,000 --> 0:16:24,000
you can create a global movement

313
0:16:25.381,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that is changing the face of men's health.

314
0:16:27.75,000 --> 0:16:29,000
My name is Adam Garone, and that's my story.

315
0:16:30.125,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Thank you. (Applause)

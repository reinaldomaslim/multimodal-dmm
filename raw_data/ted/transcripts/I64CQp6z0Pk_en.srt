1
0:00:12.882,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, I have a feature on my website where every week

2
0:00:15.391,000 --> 0:00:17,000
people submit hypothetical questions

3
0:00:17.391,000 --> 0:00:18,000
for me to answer,

4
0:00:18.979,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I try to answer them using math, science

5
0:00:21.36,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and comics.

6
0:00:22.82,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So for example, one person asked,

7
0:00:25.228,000 --> 0:00:26,000
what would happen if you tried to hit a baseball

8
0:00:26.922,000 --> 0:00:28,000
pitched at 90 percent of the speed of light?

9
0:00:29.328,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So I did some calculations.

10
0:00:32.28,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Now, normally, when an object flies through the air,

11
0:00:34.547,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the air will flow around the object,

12
0:00:36.021,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but in this case, the ball would be going so fast

13
0:00:37.95,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that the air molecules wouldn't have time

14
0:00:39.401,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to move out of the way.

15
0:00:41.02,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The ball would smash right into and through them,

16
0:00:44.007,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and the collisions with these air molecules

17
0:00:45.668,000 --> 0:00:46,000
would knock away the nitrogen,

18
0:00:47.333,000 --> 0:00:48,000
carbon and hydrogen from the ball,

19
0:00:49.291,000 --> 0:00:5,000
fragmenting it off into tiny particles,

20
0:00:51.128,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and also triggering waves of thermonuclear fusion

21
0:00:53.612,000 --> 0:00:54,000
in the air around it.

22
0:00:55.14,000 --> 0:00:57,000
This would result in a flood of x-rays

23
0:00:57.305,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that would spread out in a bubble

24
0:00:59.056,000 --> 0:01:,000
along with exotic particles,

25
0:01:00.482,000 --> 0:01:03,000
plasma inside, centered on the pitcher's mound,

26
0:01:03.602,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and that would move away from the pitcher's mound

27
0:01:07.144,000 --> 0:01:09,000
slightly faster than the ball.

28
0:01:09.629,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now at this point, about 30 nanoseconds in,

29
0:01:12.311,000 --> 0:01:13,000
the home plate is far enough away

30
0:01:14.214,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that light hasn't had time to reach it,

31
0:01:16.12,000 --> 0:01:17,000
which means the batter

32
0:01:17.571,000 --> 0:01:19,000
still sees the pitcher about to throw

33
0:01:20.335,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and has no idea that anything is wrong.

34
0:01:22.352,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:24.624,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Now, after 70 nanoseconds,

36
0:01:27.05,000 --> 0:01:28,000
the ball will reach home plate,

37
0:01:28.504,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or at least the cloud of expanding plasma

38
0:01:31.241,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that used to be the ball,

39
0:01:33.37,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and it will engulf the bat and the batter

40
0:01:37.135,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and the plate and the catcher and the umpire

41
0:01:40.596,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and start disintegrating them all

42
0:01:43.401,000 --> 0:01:46,000
as it also starts to carry them backward

43
0:01:46.567,000 --> 0:01:49,000
through the backstop, which also starts to disintegrate.

44
0:01:50.031,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So if you were watching this whole thing

45
0:01:51.801,000 --> 0:01:52,000
from a hill,

46
0:01:53.108,000 --> 0:01:56,000
ideally, far away,

47
0:01:56.481,000 --> 0:01:57,000
what you'd see is a bright flash of light

48
0:01:57.936,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that would fade over a few seconds,

49
0:01:59.442,000 --> 0:02:01,000
followed by a blast wave spreading out,

50
0:02:01.57,000 --> 0:02:03,000
shredding trees and houses

51
0:02:04.03,000 --> 0:02:06,000
as it moves away from the stadium,

52
0:02:06.149,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and then eventually a mushroom cloud

53
0:02:09.081,000 --> 0:02:12,000
rising up over the ruined city. (Laughter)

54
0:02:12.842,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So the Major League Baseball rules

55
0:02:13.998,000 --> 0:02:15,000
are a little bit hazy,

56
0:02:16.102,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but — (Laughter) — under rule 6.02 and 5.09,

57
0:02:20.987,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I think that in this situation,

58
0:02:22.596,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the batter would be considered hit by pitch

59
0:02:25.049,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and would be eligible to take first base,

60
0:02:27.683,000 --> 0:02:3,000
if it still existed.

61
0:02:30.886,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So this is the kind of question I answer,

62
0:02:32.682,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and I get people writing in with

63
0:02:34.821,000 --> 0:02:35,000
a lot of other strange questions.

64
0:02:36.695,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I've had someone write and say,

65
0:02:39.242,000 --> 0:02:4,000
scientifically speaking, what is the best

66
0:02:41.161,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and fastest way to hide a body?

67
0:02:43.231,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Can you do this one soon?

68
0:02:45.453,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And I had someone write in,

69
0:02:47.313,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I've had people write in about,

70
0:02:49.328,000 --> 0:02:51,000
can you prove whether or not you can find love again

71
0:02:51.532,000 --> 0:02:52,000
after your heart's broken?

72
0:02:53.204,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And I've had people send in

73
0:02:54.979,000 --> 0:02:55,000
what are clearly homework questions

74
0:02:56.97,000 --> 0:02:59,000
they're trying to get me to do for them.

75
0:03:00.113,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But one week, a couple months ago,

76
0:03:03.018,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I got a question that was actually about Google.

77
0:03:06.679,000 --> 0:03:08,000
If all digital data in the world were stored on punch cards,

78
0:03:09.645,000 --> 0:03:11,000
how big would Google's data warehouse be?

79
0:03:12.324,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Now, Google's pretty secretive about their operations,

80
0:03:15.046,000 --> 0:03:18,000
so no one really knows how much data Google has,

81
0:03:18.422,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and in fact, no one really knows how many data centers Google has,

82
0:03:20.937,000 --> 0:03:22,000
except people at Google itself.

83
0:03:23.428,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I've tried, I've met them a few times,

84
0:03:24.662,000 --> 0:03:29,000
tried asking them, and they aren't revealing anything.

85
0:03:29.885,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So I decided to try to figure this out myself.

86
0:03:32.42,000 --> 0:03:34,000
There are a few things that I looked at here.

87
0:03:34.579,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I started with money.

88
0:03:36.485,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Google has to reveal how much they spend,

89
0:03:38.627,000 --> 0:03:39,000
in general, and that lets you put some caps

90
0:03:40.617,000 --> 0:03:43,000
on how many data centers could they be building,

91
0:03:44.403,000 --> 0:03:46,000
because a big data center costs a certain amount of money.

92
0:03:46.703,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And you can also then put a cap on

93
0:03:49.135,000 --> 0:03:51,000
how much of the world hard drive market are they taking up,

94
0:03:51.466,000 --> 0:03:52,000
which turns out, it's pretty sizable.

95
0:03:53.418,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I read a calculation at one point,

96
0:03:55.355,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I think Google has a drive failure

97
0:03:56.82,000 --> 0:03:59,000
about every minute or two,

98
0:04:00.074,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and they just throw out the hard drive

99
0:04:01.424,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and swap in a new one.

100
0:04:02.81,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So they go through a huge number of them.

101
0:04:05.01,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And so by looking at money,

102
0:04:06.121,000 --> 0:04:08,000
you can get an idea of how many of these centers they have.

103
0:04:08.97,000 --> 0:04:09,000
You can also look at power.

104
0:04:10.83,000 --> 0:04:13,000
You can look at how much electricity they need,

105
0:04:14.727,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because you need a certain amount of electricity to run the servers,

106
0:04:16.534,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and Google is more efficient than most,

107
0:04:18.573,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but they still have some basic requirements,

108
0:04:21.67,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and that lets you put a limit

109
0:04:23.586,000 --> 0:04:24,000
on the number of servers that they have.

110
0:04:25.533,000 --> 0:04:29,000
You can also look at square footage and see

111
0:04:29.724,000 --> 0:04:3,000
of the data centers that you know,

112
0:04:31,000 --> 0:04:32,000
how big are they?

113
0:04:32.353,000 --> 0:04:32,000
How much room is that?

114
0:04:33.275,000 --> 0:04:35,000
How many server racks could you fit in there?

115
0:04:35.635,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And for some data centers,

116
0:04:37.338,000 --> 0:04:38,000
you might get two of these pieces of information.

117
0:04:39.327,000 --> 0:04:4,000
You know how much they spent,

118
0:04:41.023,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and they also, say, because they had to contract

119
0:04:43.38,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with the local government

120
0:04:44.799,000 --> 0:04:45,000
to get the power provided,

121
0:04:46.479,000 --> 0:04:48,000
you might know what they made a deal to buy,

122
0:04:49.136,000 --> 0:04:5,000
so you know how much power it takes.

123
0:04:50.89,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Then you can look at the ratios of those numbers,

124
0:04:53.184,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and figure out for a data center

125
0:04:54.713,000 --> 0:04:55,000
where you don't have that information,

126
0:04:56.349,000 --> 0:04:57,000
you can figure out,

127
0:04:57.441,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but maybe you only have one of those,

128
0:04:59.628,000 --> 0:05:,000
you know the square footage, then you could figure out

129
0:05:01.307,000 --> 0:05:03,000
well, maybe the power is proportional.

130
0:05:03.63,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And you can do this same thing with a lot of different quantities,

131
0:05:05.95,000 --> 0:05:07,000
you know, with guesses about the total amount of storage,

132
0:05:08.026,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the number of servers, the number of drives per server,

133
0:05:10.619,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and in each case using what you know

134
0:05:13.666,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to come up with a model that narrows down

135
0:05:16.193,000 --> 0:05:18,000
your guesses for the things that you don't know.

136
0:05:18.323,000 --> 0:05:2,000
It's sort of circling around the number you're trying to get.

137
0:05:20.588,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And this is a lot of fun.

138
0:05:23.143,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The math is not all that advanced,

139
0:05:25.325,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and really it's like nothing more than

140
0:05:28.46,000 --> 0:05:3,000
solving a sudoku puzzle.

141
0:05:30.472,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So what I did, I went through all of this information,

142
0:05:35.781,000 --> 0:05:36,000
spent a day or two researching.

143
0:05:37.54,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And there are some things I didn't look at.

144
0:05:39.579,000 --> 0:05:42,000
You could always look at the Google

145
0:05:42.622,000 --> 0:05:43,000
recruitment messages that they post.

146
0:05:44.439,000 --> 0:05:45,000
That gives you an idea of where they have people.

147
0:05:46.377,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Sometimes, when people visit a data center,

148
0:05:47.988,000 --> 0:05:48,000
they'll take a cell-cam photo and post it,

149
0:05:49.833,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and they aren't supposed to,

150
0:05:51.323,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but you can learn things about their hardware that way.

151
0:05:54.136,000 --> 0:05:56,000
And in fact, you can just look at pizza delivery drivers.

152
0:05:56.689,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Turns out, they know where all the Google data centers are,

153
0:05:59.344,000 --> 0:06:01,000
at least the ones that have people in them.

154
0:06:02.22,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But I came up with my estimate,

155
0:06:04.405,000 --> 0:06:05,000
which I felt pretty good about,

156
0:06:06.269,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that was about 10 exabytes of data

157
0:06:09.518,000 --> 0:06:11,000
across all of Google's operations,

158
0:06:11.94,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and then another maybe five exabytes or so

159
0:06:15.372,000 --> 0:06:17,000
of offline storage in tape drives,

160
0:06:17.417,000 --> 0:06:18,000
which it turns out Google is

161
0:06:18.992,000 --> 0:06:2,000
about the world's largest consumer of.

162
0:06:21.502,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So I came up with this estimate, and this is

163
0:06:25.063,000 --> 0:06:26,000
a staggering amount of data.

164
0:06:26.306,000 --> 0:06:28,000
It's quite a bit more than any other organization

165
0:06:29.18,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in the world has, as far as we know.

166
0:06:30.927,000 --> 0:06:31,000
There's a couple of other contenders,

167
0:06:32.673,000 --> 0:06:34,000
especially everyone always thinks of the NSA.

168
0:06:35.017,000 --> 0:06:36,000
But using some of these same methods,

169
0:06:36.446,000 --> 0:06:38,000
we can look at the NSA's data centers,

170
0:06:38.469,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and figure out, you know, we don't know what's going on there,

171
0:06:40.951,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but it's pretty clear that their operation

172
0:06:43.041,000 --> 0:06:44,000
is not the size of Google's.

173
0:06:44.638,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Adding all of this up, I came up with

174
0:06:46.377,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the other thing that we can answer, which is,

175
0:06:48.273,000 --> 0:06:49,000
how many punch cards would this take?

176
0:06:50.258,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And so a punch card can hold

177
0:06:53.216,000 --> 0:06:54,000
about 80 characters,

178
0:06:55.207,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and you can fit about 2,000 or so cards into a box,

179
0:06:58.98,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and you put them in, say,

180
0:07:00.254,000 --> 0:07:01,000
my home region of New England,

181
0:07:02.206,000 --> 0:07:04,000
it would cover the entire region

182
0:07:04.546,000 --> 0:07:07,000
up to a depth of a little less than five kilometers,

183
0:07:08.02,000 --> 0:07:09,000
which is about three times deeper

184
0:07:09.463,000 --> 0:07:11,000
than the glaciers during the last ice age

185
0:07:11.862,000 --> 0:07:13,000
about 20,000 years ago.

186
0:07:14.03,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So this is impractical, but I think

187
0:07:16.453,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that's about the best answer I could come up with.

188
0:07:19.404,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And I posted it on my website. I wrote it up.

189
0:07:21.542,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And I didn't expect to get an answer from Google,

190
0:07:25.232,000 --> 0:07:26,000
because of course they've been so secretive,

191
0:07:26.863,000 --> 0:07:27,000
they didn't answer of my questions,

192
0:07:28.267,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and so I just put it up and said,

193
0:07:29.774,000 --> 0:07:3,000
well, I guess we'll never know.

194
0:07:31.297,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But then a little while later

195
0:07:33.321,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I got a message, a couple weeks later, from Google,

196
0:07:35.77,000 --> 0:07:38,000
saying, hey, someone here has an envelope for you.

197
0:07:39.212,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So I go and get it, open it up,

198
0:07:42.013,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and it's punch cards. (Laughter)

199
0:07:44.54,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Google-branded punch cards.

200
0:07:47.622,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And on these punch cards, there are a bunch of holes,

201
0:07:50.87,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and I said, thank you, thank you,

202
0:07:52.171,000 --> 0:07:53,000
okay, so what's on here?

203
0:07:53.69,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So I get some software and start reading it,

204
0:07:55.32,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and scan them, and it turns out

205
0:07:57.32,000 --> 0:07:58,000
it's a puzzle.

206
0:07:58.689,000 --> 0:07:59,000
There's a bunch of code,

207
0:08:00.327,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and I get some friends to help,

208
0:08:01.581,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and we crack the code, and then inside that is another code,

209
0:08:04.133,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and then there are some equations,

210
0:08:05.428,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and then we solve those equations,

211
0:08:06.599,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and then finally out pops a message from Google

212
0:08:10.07,000 --> 0:08:13,000
which is their official answer to my article,

213
0:08:13.259,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and it said, "No comment."

214
0:08:15.711,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

215
0:08:26.292,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And I love calculating these kinds of things,

216
0:08:29.509,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and it's not that I love doing the math.

217
0:08:31.224,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I do a lot of math,

218
0:08:32.789,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but I don't really like math for its own sake.

219
0:08:35.865,000 --> 0:08:36,000
What I love is that it lets you take

220
0:08:37.815,000 --> 0:08:38,000
some things that you know,

221
0:08:39.215,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and just by moving symbols around on a piece of paper,

222
0:08:43.993,000 --> 0:08:44,000
find out something that you didn't know

223
0:08:45.69,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that's very surprising.

224
0:08:47.87,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And I have a lot of stupid questions,

225
0:08:49.546,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and I love that math gives the power

226
0:08:51.349,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to answer them sometimes.

227
0:08:54.106,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And sometimes not.

228
0:08:55.633,000 --> 0:08:57,000
This is a question I got from a reader,

229
0:08:58.557,000 --> 0:08:59,000
an anonymous reader,

230
0:08:59.73,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and the subject line just said, "Urgent,"

231
0:09:01.775,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and this was the entire email:

232
0:09:03.704,000 --> 0:09:05,000
"If people had wheels and could fly,

233
0:09:06.466,000 --> 0:09:08,000
how would we differentiate them from airplanes?"

234
0:09:09.162,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Urgent. (Laughter)

235
0:09:11.837,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I think there are some questions

236
0:09:15.19,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that math just cannot answer.

237
0:09:17.86,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Thank you.

238
0:09:20.331,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Applause)

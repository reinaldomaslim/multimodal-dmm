1
0:00:20.056,000 --> 0:00:23,000
You might think there are many things that I can't do

2
0:00:23.693,000 --> 0:00:24,000
because I cannot see.

3
0:00:26.326,000 --> 0:00:27,000
That's largely true.

4
0:00:27.998,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Actually, I just needed to have a bit of help

5
0:00:30.505,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to come up to the stage.

6
0:00:32.363,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But there is also a lot that I can do.

7
0:00:35.73,000 --> 0:00:38,000
This is me rock climbing for the first time.

8
0:00:39.166,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Actually, I love sports and I can play many sports,

9
0:00:43.267,000 --> 0:00:48,000
like swimming, skiing, skating, scuba diving, running and so on.

10
0:00:49.382,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But there is one limitation:

11
0:00:52.145,000 --> 0:00:53,000
somebody needs to help me.

12
0:00:54.514,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I want to be independent.

13
0:00:57.741,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I lost my sight at the age of 14 in a swimming pool accident.

14
0:01:02.989,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I was an active, independent teenager,

15
0:01:05.637,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and suddenly I became blind.

16
0:01:08.84,000 --> 0:01:12,000
The hardest thing for me was losing my independence.

17
0:01:13.6,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Things that until then seemed simple became almost impossible to do alone.

18
0:01:19.962,000 --> 0:01:22,000
For example, one of my challenges was textbooks.

19
0:01:24.084,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Back then, there were no personal computers,

20
0:01:26.858,000 --> 0:01:28,000
no Internet, no smartphones.

21
0:01:29.319,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So I had to ask one of my two brothers to read me textbooks,

22
0:01:34.776,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and I had to create my own books in Braille.

23
0:01:38.653,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Can you imagine?

24
0:01:40.603,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Of course, my brothers were not happy about it,

25
0:01:43.746,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and later, I noticed they were not there whenever I needed them.

26
0:01:47.593,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:48.618,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I think they tried to stay away from me.

28
0:01:52.434,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I don't blame them.

29
0:01:54.581,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I really wanted to be freed from relying on someone.

30
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That became my strong desire to ignite innovation.

31
0:02:04.1,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Jump ahead to the mid-1980s.

32
0:02:06.81,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I got to know cutting-edge technologies

33
0:02:09.58,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and I thought to myself,

34
0:02:11.701,000 --> 0:02:14,000
how come there is no computer technology

35
0:02:15.344,000 --> 0:02:17,000
to create books in Braille?

36
0:02:18.288,000 --> 0:02:22,000
These amazing technologies must be able to also help people

37
0:02:22.676,000 --> 0:02:24,000
with limitations like myself.

38
0:02:25.805,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That's the moment my innovation journey began.

39
0:02:30.686,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I started developing digital book technologies,

40
0:02:34.564,000 --> 0:02:39,000
such as a digital Braille editor, digital Braille dictionary

41
0:02:39.881,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and a digital Braille library network.

42
0:02:43.178,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Today, every student who is visually impaired can read textbooks,

43
0:02:47.57,000 --> 0:02:5,000
by using personal computers and mobile devices,

44
0:02:51.421,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in Braille or in voice.

45
0:02:53.998,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This may not surprise you,

46
0:02:56.158,000 --> 0:03:01,000
since everyone now has digital books in their tablets in 2015.

47
0:03:01.242,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But Braille went digital many years before digital books,

48
0:03:07.113,000 --> 0:03:12,000
already in the late 1980s, almost 30 years ago.

49
0:03:13.242,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Strong and specific needs of the blind people

50
0:03:17.065,000 --> 0:03:22,000
made this opportunity to create digital books way back then.

51
0:03:23.343,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And this is actually not the first time this happened,

52
0:03:28.373,000 --> 0:03:34,000
because history shows us accessibility ignites innovation.

53
0:03:35.467,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The telephone was invented while developing a communication tool

54
0:03:39.508,000 --> 0:03:4,000
for hearing impaired people.

55
0:03:41.737,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Some keyboards were also invented to help people with disabilities.

56
0:03:48.807,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Now I'm going to give you another example from my own life.

57
0:03:52.688,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In the '90s, people around me started talking about the Internet

58
0:03:56.975,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and web browsing.

59
0:03:58.895,000 --> 0:04:,000
I remember the first time I went on the web.

60
0:04:02.148,000 --> 0:04:03,000
I was astonished.

61
0:04:04.352,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I could access newspapers at any time and every day.

62
0:04:08.81,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I could even search for any information by myself.

63
0:04:13.175,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I desperately wanted to help the blind people have access to the Internet,

64
0:04:19.013,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and I found ways to render the web into synthesized voice,

65
0:04:24.343,000 --> 0:04:27,000
which dramatically simplified the user interface.

66
0:04:28.685,000 --> 0:04:33,000
This led me to develop the Home Page Reader in 1997,

67
0:04:34.119,000 --> 0:04:38,000
first in Japanese and later, translated into 11 languages.

68
0:04:39.784,000 --> 0:04:41,000
When I developed the Home Page Reader,

69
0:04:42.385,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I got many comments from users.

70
0:04:45.909,000 --> 0:04:47,000
One that I strongly remember said,

71
0:04:49.032,000 --> 0:04:54,000
"For me, the Internet is a small window to the world."

72
0:04:55.185,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It was a revolutionary moment for the blind.

73
0:04:59.13,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The cyber world became accessible,

74
0:05:01.331,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and this technology that we created for the blind has many uses,

75
0:05:06.025,000 --> 0:05:07,000
way beyond what I imagined.

76
0:05:08.539,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It can help drivers listen to their emails

77
0:05:12.709,000 --> 0:05:16,000
or it can help you listen to a recipe while cooking.

78
0:05:18.116,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Today, I am more independent,

79
0:05:20.65,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but it is still not enough.

80
0:05:23.668,000 --> 0:05:28,000
For example, when I approached the stage just now, I needed assistance.

81
0:05:30.412,000 --> 0:05:33,000
My goal is to come up here independently.

82
0:05:34.147,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And not just here.

83
0:05:35.991,000 --> 0:05:4,000
My goal is to be able to travel and do things that are simple to you.

84
0:05:42.638,000 --> 0:05:44,000
OK, now let me show you the latest technologies.

85
0:05:45.471,000 --> 0:05:48,000
This is a smartphone app that we are working on.

86
0:05:50.625,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Video) Electronic voice: 51 feet to the door, and keep straight.

87
0:05:57.702,000 --> 0:06:,000
EV: Take the two doors to go out. The door is on your right.

88
0:06:07.731,000 --> 0:06:08,000
EV: Nick is approaching. Looks so happy.

89
0:06:09.693,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Chieko Asakawa: Hi, Nick!

90
0:06:10.922,000 --> 0:06:11,000
(Laughter)

91
0:06:11.947,000 --> 0:06:13,000
CA: Where are you going? You look so happy.

92
0:06:14.114,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Nick: Oh -- well, my paper just got accepted.

93
0:06:16.251,000 --> 0:06:17,000
CA: That's great! Congratulations.

94
0:06:17.922,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Nick: Thanks. Wait -- how'd you know it was me, and that I look happy?

95
0:06:21.597,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Chieko and Nick laugh)

96
0:06:22.971,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Man: Hi.

97
0:06:24.154,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Laughter)

98
0:06:25.895,000 --> 0:06:26,000
CA: Oh ... hi.

99
0:06:27.07,000 --> 0:06:29,000
EV: He is not talking to you, but on his phone.

100
0:06:36.434,000 --> 0:06:37,000
EV: Potato chips.

101
0:06:45.159,000 --> 0:06:46,000
EV: Dark chocolate with almonds.

102
0:06:48.155,000 --> 0:06:51,000
EV: You gained 5 pounds since yesterday; take apple instead of chocolate.

103
0:06:51.7,000 --> 0:06:53,000
(Laughter)

104
0:06:54.456,000 --> 0:06:55,000
EV: Approaching.

105
0:07:00.038,000 --> 0:07:01,000
EV: You arrived.

106
0:07:02.939,000 --> 0:07:03,000
CA: Now ...

107
0:07:04.202,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Applause)

108
0:07:08.154,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Thank you.

109
0:07:09.369,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So now the app navigates me

110
0:07:12.291,000 --> 0:07:16,000
by analyzing beacon signals and smartphone sensors

111
0:07:16.331,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and permits me to move around indoor and outdoor environments

112
0:07:21.491,000 --> 0:07:22,000
all by myself.

113
0:07:23.103,000 --> 0:07:27,000
But the computer vision part that showed who is approaching,

114
0:07:27.975,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in which mood -- we are still working on that part.

115
0:07:32.251,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And recognizing facial expressions is very important for me to be social.

116
0:07:39.398,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So now the fusions of technologies are ready to help me

117
0:07:45.588,000 --> 0:07:46,000
see the real world.

118
0:07:47.92,000 --> 0:07:5,000
We call this cognitive assistance.

119
0:07:51.821,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It understands our surrounding world

120
0:07:55.164,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and whispers to me in voice or sends a vibration to my fingers.

121
0:08:02.088,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Cognitive assistance will augment missing or weakened abilities --

122
0:08:08.176,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in other words, our five senses.

123
0:08:11.464,000 --> 0:08:14,000
This technology is only in an early stage,

124
0:08:14.799,000 --> 0:08:18,000
but eventually, I'll be able to find a classroom on campus,

125
0:08:19.6,000 --> 0:08:2,000
enjoy window shopping

126
0:08:21.378,000 --> 0:08:24,000
or find a nice restaurant while walking along a street.

127
0:08:26.088,000 --> 0:08:3,000
It will be amazing if I can find you on the street before you notice me.

128
0:08:31.595,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It will become my best buddy, and yours.

129
0:08:36.308,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So, this really is a great challenge.

130
0:08:40.395,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It is a challenge that needs collaboration,

131
0:08:44.388,000 --> 0:08:46,000
which is why we are creating an open community

132
0:08:47.314,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to accelerate research activities.

133
0:08:51.192,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Just this morning, we announced the open-source fundamental technologies

134
0:08:56.114,000 --> 0:08:57,000
you just saw in the video.

135
0:08:58.487,000 --> 0:09:,000
The frontier is the real world.

136
0:09:01.878,000 --> 0:09:05,000
The blind community is exploring this technical frontier

137
0:09:06.315,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and the pathfinder.

138
0:09:08.559,000 --> 0:09:11,000
I hope to work with you to explore the new era,

139
0:09:12.321,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and the next time that I'm on this stage,

140
0:09:15.432,000 --> 0:09:17,000
through technology and innovation,

141
0:09:17.87,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I will be able to walk up here

142
0:09:19.919,000 --> 0:09:2,000
all by myself.

143
0:09:21.539,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Thank you so much.

144
0:09:22.802,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Applause)

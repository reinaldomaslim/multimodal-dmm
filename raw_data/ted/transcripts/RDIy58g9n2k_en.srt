1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
If you had caught me straight out of college

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
in the halls of the Vermont State House

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
where I was a lobbyist in training

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and asked me what I was going to do with my life,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I would have told you

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that I'd just passed the Hanyu Shuiping Kaoshi,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
the Chinese equivalency exam,

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and I was going to go study law in Beijing,

9
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and I was going to improve U.S.-China relations

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
through top-down policy changes

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and judicial system reforms.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Applause)

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I had a plan,

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I never ever thought

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
it would have anything to do

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
with the banjo.

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
Little did I know

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
what a huge impact it would have on me one night

20
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
when I was at a party

21
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and I heard a sound coming out of a record player

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
in the corner of a room.

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And it was Doc Watson

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
singing and playing "Shady Grove."

25
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000

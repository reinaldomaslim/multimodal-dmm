Cabbie: Twenty-two dollars. Steven Pinker: Okay.

5
0:00:29.857,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Rebecca Newberger Goldstein: Reason appears to have fallen on hard times:

6
0:00:33.975,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Popular culture plumbs new depths of dumbth

7
0:00:37.31,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and political discourse has become a race

8
0:00:39.776,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to the bottom.

9
0:00:42.791,000 --> 0:00:46,000
We're living in an era of scientific creationism,

10
0:00:47.345,000 --> 0:00:51,000
9/11 conspiracy theories, psychic hotlines,

11
0:00:51.359,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and a resurgence of religious fundamentalism.

12
0:00:54.466,000 --> 0:00:56,000
People who think too well

13
0:00:56.52,000 --> 0:00:58,000
are often accused of elitism,

14
0:00:58.876,000 --> 0:01:,000
and even in the academy,

15
0:01:01.035,000 --> 0:01:03,000
there are attacks on logocentrism,

16
0:01:03.684,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the crime of letting logic dominate our thinking.

17
0:01:08.569,000 --> 0:01:1,000
SP: But is this necessarily a bad thing?

18
0:01:11.076,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Perhaps reason is overrated.

19
0:01:13.295,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Many pundits have argued that a good heart

20
0:01:15.438,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and steadfast moral clarity

21
0:01:17.388,000 --> 0:01:21,000
are superior to triangulations of overeducated policy wonks,

22
0:01:21.626,000 --> 0:01:23,000
like the best and brightest and that dragged us

23
0:01:24.291,000 --> 0:01:25,000
into the quagmire of Vietnam.

24
0:01:26.153,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And wasn't it reason that gave us the means

25
0:01:27.975,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to despoil the planet

26
0:01:29.705,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and threaten our species with weapons of mass destruction?

27
0:01:32.726,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In this way of thinking, it's character and conscience,

28
0:01:35.965,000 --> 0:01:38,000
not cold-hearted calculation, that will save us.

29
0:01:39.091,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Besides, a human being is not a brain on a stick.

30
0:01:42.956,000 --> 0:01:44,000
My fellow psychologists have shown that we're led

31
0:01:45.474,000 --> 0:01:46,000
by our bodies and our emotions

32
0:01:47.375,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and use our puny powers of reason

33
0:01:49.36,000 --> 0:01:52,000
merely to rationalize our gut feelings after the fact.

34
0:01:52.72,000 --> 0:01:55,000
RNG: How could a reasoned argument logically entail

35
0:01:55.917,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the ineffectiveness of reasoned arguments?

36
0:01:59.349,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Look, you're trying to persuade us of reason's impotence.

37
0:02:03.185,000 --> 0:02:05,000
You're not threatening us or bribing us,

38
0:02:05.572,000 --> 0:02:06,000
suggesting that we resolve the issue

39
0:02:07.203,000 --> 0:02:1,000
with a show of hands or a beauty contest.

40
0:02:10.411,000 --> 0:02:13,000
By the very act of trying to reason us into your position,

41
0:02:14.348,000 --> 0:02:17,000
you're conceding reason's potency.

42
0:02:17.366,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Reason isn't up for grabs here. It can't be.

43
0:02:20.372,000 --> 0:02:21,000
You show up for that debate

44
0:02:21.77,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and you've already lost it.

45
0:02:24.612,000 --> 0:02:26,000
SP: But can reason lead us in directions

46
0:02:27.327,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that are good or decent or moral?

47
0:02:29.999,000 --> 0:02:31,000
After all, you pointed out that reason

48
0:02:32.51,000 --> 0:02:33,000
is just a means to an end,

49
0:02:34.284,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and the end depends on the reasoner's passions.

50
0:02:36.75,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Reason can lay out a road map to peace and harmony

51
0:02:39.317,000 --> 0:02:4,000
if the reasoner wants peace and harmony,

52
0:02:41.173,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but it can also lay out a road map to conflict and strife

53
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:46,000
if the reasoner delights in conflict and strife.

54
0:02:46.677,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Can reason force the reasoner to want

55
0:02:49.003,000 --> 0:02:51,000
less cruelty and waste?

56
0:02:51.312,000 --> 0:02:54,000
RNG: All on its own, the answer is no,

57
0:02:54.584,000 --> 0:02:56,000
but it doesn't take much to switch it to yes.

58
0:02:57.345,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You need two conditions:

59
0:02:59.699,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The first is that reasoners all care

60
0:03:02.258,000 --> 0:03:03,000
about their own well-being.

61
0:03:03.968,000 --> 0:03:05,000
That's one of the passions that has to be present

62
0:03:06.864,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in order for reason to go to work,

63
0:03:09.068,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and it's obviously present in all of us.

64
0:03:10.956,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We all care passionately

65
0:03:13.486,000 --> 0:03:15,000
about our own well-being.

66
0:03:15.75,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The second condition is that reasoners

67
0:03:17.583,000 --> 0:03:19,000
are members of a community of reasoners

68
0:03:20.068,000 --> 0:03:22,000
who can affect one another's well-being,

69
0:03:22.142,000 --> 0:03:23,000
can exchange messages,

70
0:03:23.655,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and comprehend each other's reasoning.

71
0:03:26.483,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And that's certainly true of our gregarious

72
0:03:29.469,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and loquatious species,

73
0:03:31.481,000 --> 0:03:33,000
well endowed with the instinct for language.

74
0:03:34.337,000 --> 0:03:36,000
SP: Well, that sounds good in theory,

75
0:03:36.659,000 --> 0:03:38,000
but has it worked that way in practice?

76
0:03:38.673,000 --> 0:03:39,000
In particular, can it explain

77
0:03:40.507,000 --> 0:03:41,000
a momentous historical development

78
0:03:42.438,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that I spoke about five years ago here at TED?

79
0:03:45.305,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Namely, we seem to be getting more humane.

80
0:03:47.95,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Centuries ago, our ancestors would burn cats alive

81
0:03:51.31,000 --> 0:03:53,000
as a form of popular entertainment.

82
0:03:53.57,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Knights waged constant war on each other

83
0:03:55.449,000 --> 0:03:58,000
by trying to kill as many of each other's peasants as possible.

84
0:03:58.615,000 --> 0:04:,000
Governments executed people for frivolous reasons,

85
0:04:01.29,000 --> 0:04:02,000
like stealing a cabbage

86
0:04:02.7,000 --> 0:04:04,000
or criticizing the royal garden.

87
0:04:04.948,000 --> 0:04:06,000
The executions were designed to be as prolonged

88
0:04:07.201,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and as painful as possible, like crucifixion,

89
0:04:10.139,000 --> 0:04:12,000
disembowelment, breaking on the wheel.

90
0:04:12.233,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Respectable people kept slaves.

91
0:04:14.299,000 --> 0:04:15,000
For all our flaws, we have abandoned

92
0:04:16.272,000 --> 0:04:17,000
these barbaric practices.

93
0:04:17.765,000 --> 0:04:19,000
RNG: So, do you think it's human nature that's changed?

94
0:04:20.533,000 --> 0:04:22,000
SP: Not exactly. I think we still harbor instincts

95
0:04:23.318,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that can erupt in violence,

96
0:04:24.917,000 --> 0:04:28,000
like greed, tribalism, revenge, dominance, sadism.

97
0:04:29.287,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But we also have instincts that can steer us away,

98
0:04:32.286,000 --> 0:04:35,000
like self-control, empathy, a sense of fairness,

99
0:04:35.778,000 --> 0:04:36,000
what Abraham Lincoln called

100
0:04:37.054,000 --> 0:04:38,000
the better angels of our nature.

101
0:04:38.643,000 --> 0:04:4,000
RNG: So if human nature didn't change,

102
0:04:40.685,000 --> 0:04:41,000
what invigorated those better angels?

103
0:04:42.684,000 --> 0:04:43,000
SP: Well, among other things,

104
0:04:44.217,000 --> 0:04:46,000
our circle of empathy expanded.

105
0:04:46.359,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Years ago, our ancestors would feel the pain

106
0:04:48.806,000 --> 0:04:5,000
only of their family and people in their village.

107
0:04:51.279,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But with the expansion of literacy and travel,

108
0:04:54.081,000 --> 0:04:55,000
people started to sympathize

109
0:04:56.007,000 --> 0:04:57,000
with wider and wider circles,

110
0:04:57.672,000 --> 0:04:59,000
the clan, the tribe, the nation, the race,

111
0:05:00.553,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and perhaps eventually, all of humanity.

112
0:05:03.508,000 --> 0:05:05,000
RNG: Can hard-headed scientists

113
0:05:05.714,000 --> 0:05:08,000
really give so much credit to soft-hearted empathy?

114
0:05:08.735,000 --> 0:05:09,000
SP: They can and do.

115
0:05:10.416,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Neurophysiologists have found neurons in the brain

116
0:05:12.417,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that respond to other people's actions

117
0:05:14.597,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the same way they respond to our own.

118
0:05:16.664,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Empathy emerges early in life,

119
0:05:18.391,000 --> 0:05:19,000
perhaps before the age of one.

120
0:05:20.274,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Books on empathy have become bestsellers,

121
0:05:21.917,000 --> 0:05:23,000
like "The Empathic Civilization"

122
0:05:23.931,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and "The Age of Empathy."

123
0:05:26.111,000 --> 0:05:28,000
RNG: I'm all for empathy. I mean, who isn't?

124
0:05:28.809,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But all on its own, it's a feeble instrument

125
0:05:32.477,000 --> 0:05:33,000
for making moral progress.

126
0:05:34.347,000 --> 0:05:36,000
For one thing, it's innately biased

127
0:05:36.534,000 --> 0:05:38,000
toward blood relations, babies

128
0:05:38.66,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and warm, fuzzy animals.

129
0:05:40.494,000 --> 0:05:42,000
As far as empathy is concerned,

130
0:05:42.893,000 --> 0:05:45,000
ugly outsiders can go to hell.

131
0:05:46.426,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And even our best attempts to work up sympathy

132
0:05:49.829,000 --> 0:05:5,000
for those who are unconnected with us

133
0:05:51.813,000 --> 0:05:55,000
fall miserably short, a sad truth about human nature

134
0:05:56.012,000 --> 0:05:58,000
that was pointed out by Adam Smith.

135
0:05:58.566,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Adam Smith: Let us suppose that the great empire

136
0:06:00.347,000 --> 0:06:02,000
of China was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake,

137
0:06:02.962,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and let us consider how a man of humanity in Europe

138
0:06:05.552,000 --> 0:06:06,000
would react on receiving intelligence

139
0:06:07.254,000 --> 0:06:09,000
of this dreadful calamity.

140
0:06:09.317,000 --> 0:06:11,000
He would, I imagine, first of all express very strongly

141
0:06:11.534,000 --> 0:06:13,000
his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people.

142
0:06:14.194,000 --> 0:06:15,000
He would make many melancholy reflections

143
0:06:16.071,000 --> 0:06:18,000
upon the precariousness of human life,

144
0:06:18.261,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and when all these humane sentiments

145
0:06:20.275,000 --> 0:06:21,000
had been once fairly expressed,

146
0:06:22.118,000 --> 0:06:24,000
he would pursue his business or his pleasure

147
0:06:24.37,000 --> 0:06:26,000
with the same ease and tranquility

148
0:06:26.519,000 --> 0:06:28,000
as if no such accident had happened.

149
0:06:28.611,000 --> 0:06:3,000
If he was to lose his little finger tomorrow,

150
0:06:31.153,000 --> 0:06:32,000
he would not sleep tonight,

151
0:06:32.69,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but provided he never saw them,

152
0:06:34.432,000 --> 0:06:36,000
he would snore with the most profound security

153
0:06:36.87,000 --> 0:06:38,000
over the ruin of a hundred million of his brethren.

154
0:06:39.779,000 --> 0:06:41,000
SP: But if empathy wasn't enough to make us more humane,

155
0:06:42.682,000 --> 0:06:43,000
what else was there?

156
0:06:44.242,000 --> 0:06:46,000
RNG: Well, you didn't mention what might be

157
0:06:46.936,000 --> 0:06:49,000
one of our most effective better angels: reason.

158
0:06:50.762,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Reason has muscle.

159
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It's reason that provides the push to widen

160
0:06:56.704,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that circle of empathy.

161
0:06:58.849,000 --> 0:07:,000
Every one of the humanitarian developments

162
0:07:01.757,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that you mentioned originated with thinkers

163
0:07:04.355,000 --> 0:07:06,000
who gave reasons for why some practice

164
0:07:07.225,000 --> 0:07:08,000
was indefensible.

165
0:07:09.183,000 --> 0:07:11,000
They demonstrated that the way people treated

166
0:07:11.822,000 --> 0:07:12,000
some particular group of others

167
0:07:13.769,000 --> 0:07:14,000
was logically inconsistent

168
0:07:15.555,000 --> 0:07:17,000
with the way they insisted on being treated themselves.

169
0:07:18.127,000 --> 0:07:19,000
SP: Are you saying that reason

170
0:07:19.821,000 --> 0:07:21,000
can actually change people's minds?

171
0:07:22.127,000 --> 0:07:23,000
Don't people just stick with whatever conviction

172
0:07:24.057,000 --> 0:07:25,000
serves their interests

173
0:07:25.538,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or conforms to the culture that they grew up in?

174
0:07:28.354,000 --> 0:07:31,000
RNG: Here's a fascinating fact about us:

175
0:07:31.513,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Contradictions bother us,

176
0:07:33.591,000 --> 0:07:35,000
at least when we're forced to confront them,

177
0:07:35.726,000 --> 0:07:36,000
which is just another way of saying

178
0:07:37.544,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that we are susceptible to reason.

179
0:07:40.29,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And if you look at the history of moral progress,

180
0:07:43.121,000 --> 0:07:46,000
you can trace a direct pathway from reasoned arguments

181
0:07:46.828,000 --> 0:07:49,000
to changes in the way that we actually feel.

182
0:07:50.167,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Time and again, a thinker would lay out an argument

183
0:07:53.748,000 --> 0:07:56,000
as to why some practice was indefensible,

184
0:07:57.018,000 --> 0:08:02,000
irrational, inconsistent with values already held.

185
0:08:02.067,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Their essay would go viral,

186
0:08:04.135,000 --> 0:08:06,000
get translated into many languages,

187
0:08:06.42,000 --> 0:08:09,000
get debated at pubs and coffee houses and salons,

188
0:08:09.77,000 --> 0:08:1,000
and at dinner parties,

189
0:08:11.377,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and influence leaders, legislators,

190
0:08:15.43,000 --> 0:08:16,000
popular opinion.

191
0:08:16.968,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Eventually their conclusions get absorbed

192
0:08:20.221,000 --> 0:08:22,000
into the common sense of decency,

193
0:08:22.548,000 --> 0:08:24,000
erasing the tracks of the original argument

194
0:08:25.237,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that had gotten us there.

195
0:08:27.045,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Few of us today feel any need to put forth

196
0:08:29.842,000 --> 0:08:31,000
a rigorous philosophical argument

197
0:08:31.95,000 --> 0:08:33,000
as to why slavery is wrong

198
0:08:34.209,000 --> 0:08:37,000
or public hangings or beating children.

199
0:08:37.767,000 --> 0:08:39,000
By now, these things just feel wrong.

200
0:08:40.667,000 --> 0:08:42,000
But just those arguments had to be made,

201
0:08:43.504,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and they were, in centuries past.

202
0:08:46.253,000 --> 0:08:47,000
SP: Are you saying that people needed

203
0:08:48.005,000 --> 0:08:5,000
a step-by-step argument to grasp

204
0:08:50.053,000 --> 0:08:52,000
why something might be a wee bit wrong

205
0:08:52.112,000 --> 0:08:53,000
with burning heretics at the stake?

206
0:08:53.89,000 --> 0:08:55,000
RNG: Oh, they did. Here's the French theologian

207
0:08:56.807,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Sebastian Castellio making the case.

208
0:08:59.729,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Sebastian Castellio: Calvin says that he's certain,

209
0:09:01.744,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and other sects say that they are.

210
0:09:03.384,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Who shall be judge?

211
0:09:04.657,000 --> 0:09:06,000
If the matter is certain, to whom is it so? To Calvin?

212
0:09:07.095,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But then, why does he write so many books about manifest truth?

213
0:09:10.114,000 --> 0:09:12,000
In view of the uncertainty, we must define heretics

214
0:09:12.65,000 --> 0:09:13,000
simply as one with whom we disagree.

215
0:09:14.414,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And if then we are going to kill heretics,

216
0:09:16.386,000 --> 0:09:18,000
the logical outcome will be a war of extermination,

217
0:09:18.627,000 --> 0:09:19,000
since each is sure of himself.

218
0:09:20.498,000 --> 0:09:21,000
SP: Or with hideous punishments

219
0:09:22.047,000 --> 0:09:23,000
like breaking on the wheel?

220
0:09:23.89,000 --> 0:09:25,000
RNG: The prohibition in our constitution

221
0:09:26.398,000 --> 0:09:28,000
of cruel and unusual punishments

222
0:09:28.43,000 --> 0:09:31,000
was a response to a pamphlet circulated in 1764

223
0:09:32.011,000 --> 0:09:35,000
by the Italian jurist Cesare Beccaria.

224
0:09:35.53,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Cesare Beccaria: As punishments become more cruel,

225
0:09:37.881,000 --> 0:09:39,000
the minds of men, which like fluids

226
0:09:39.964,000 --> 0:09:4,000
always adjust to the level of the objects

227
0:09:41.923,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that surround them, become hardened,

228
0:09:43.802,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and after a hundred years of cruel punishments,

229
0:09:46.647,000 --> 0:09:48,000
breaking on the wheel causes no more fear

230
0:09:48.839,000 --> 0:09:5,000
than imprisonment previously did.

231
0:09:50.983,000 --> 0:09:52,000
For a punishment to achieve its objective,

232
0:09:53.03,000 --> 0:09:55,000
it is only necessary that the harm that it inflicts

233
0:09:55.77,000 --> 0:09:58,000
outweighs the benefit that derives from the crime,

234
0:09:58.829,000 --> 0:10:,000
and into this calculation ought to be factored

235
0:10:00.937,000 --> 0:10:01,000
the certainty of punishment

236
0:10:02.603,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and the loss of the good

237
0:10:03.741,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that the commission of the crime will produce.

238
0:10:06.376,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Everything beyond this is superfluous,

239
0:10:08.168,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and therefore tyrannical.

240
0:10:10.119,000 --> 0:10:12,000
SP: But surely antiwar movements depended

241
0:10:12.469,000 --> 0:10:13,000
on mass demonstrations

242
0:10:13.998,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and catchy tunes by folk singers

243
0:10:16.08,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and wrenching photographs of the human costs of war.

244
0:10:18.987,000 --> 0:10:21,000
RNG: No doubt, but modern anti-war movements

245
0:10:22.165,000 --> 0:10:24,000
reach back to a long chain of thinkers

246
0:10:24.858,000 --> 0:10:26,000
who had argued as to why we ought to mobilize

247
0:10:27.446,000 --> 0:10:29,000
our emotions against war,

248
0:10:29.685,000 --> 0:10:32,000
such as the father of modernity, Erasmus.

249
0:10:32.812,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Erasmus: The advantages derived from peace

250
0:10:34.669,000 --> 0:10:35,000
diffuse themselves far and wide,

251
0:10:36.334,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and reach great numbers,

252
0:10:38.233,000 --> 0:10:4,000
while in war, if anything turns out happily,

253
0:10:40.234,000 --> 0:10:42,000
the advantage redounds only to a few,

254
0:10:42.458,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and those unworthy of reaping it.

255
0:10:44.469,000 --> 0:10:46,000
One man's safety is owing to the destruction of another.

256
0:10:47.346,000 --> 0:10:49,000
One man's prize is derived from the plunder of another.

257
0:10:50.015,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The cause of rejoicings made by one side

258
0:10:52.182,000 --> 0:10:54,000
is to the other a cause of mourning.

259
0:10:54.53,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Whatever is unfortunate in war,

260
0:10:56.071,000 --> 0:10:57,000
is severely so indeed,

261
0:10:57.731,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and whatever, on the contrary,

262
0:10:59.133,000 --> 0:11:,000
is called good fortune,

263
0:11:00.422,000 --> 0:11:01,000
is a savage and a cruel good fortune,

264
0:11:02.341,000 --> 0:11:05,000
an ungenerous happiness deriving its existence from another's woe.

265
0:11:05.978,000 --> 0:11:06,000
SP: But everyone knows that the movement

266
0:11:07.835,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to abolish slavery depended on faith and emotion.

267
0:11:11.053,000 --> 0:11:13,000
It was a movement spearheaded by the Quakers,

268
0:11:13.303,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and it only became popular when Harriet Beecher Stowe's novel

269
0:11:16.638,000 --> 0:11:18,000
"Uncle Tom's Cabin" became a bestseller.

270
0:11:18.922,000 --> 0:11:2,000
RNG: But the ball got rolling a century before.

271
0:11:21.839,000 --> 0:11:24,000
John Locke bucked the tide of millennia

272
0:11:25.077,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that had regarded the practice as perfectly natural.

273
0:11:28.502,000 --> 0:11:3,000
He argued that it was inconsistent

274
0:11:31.076,000 --> 0:11:32,000
with the principles of rational government.

275
0:11:32.998,000 --> 0:11:33,000
John Locke: Freedom of men under government

276
0:11:34.643,000 --> 0:11:36,000
is to have a standing rule to live by

277
0:11:36.662,000 --> 0:11:38,000
common to everyone of that society

278
0:11:38.715,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and made by the legislative power erected in it,

279
0:11:41.787,000 --> 0:11:43,000
a liberty to follow my own will in all things

280
0:11:43.971,000 --> 0:11:44,000
where that rule prescribes not,

281
0:11:45.691,000 --> 0:11:46,000
not to be subject to the inconstant,

282
0:11:47.602,000 --> 0:11:5,000
uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man,

283
0:11:51.009,000 --> 0:11:53,000
as freedom of nature is to be under no other restraint

284
0:11:53.608,000 --> 0:11:54,000
but the law of nature.

285
0:11:55.558,000 --> 0:11:56,000
SP: Those words sound familiar.

286
0:11:57.35,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Where have I read them before? Ah, yes.

287
0:12:00.076,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Mary Astell: If absolute sovereignty be not necessary

288
0:12:02.819,000 --> 0:12:04,000
in a state, how comes it to be so in a family?

289
0:12:05.431,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Or if in a family, why not in a state?

290
0:12:08.411,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Since no reason can be alleged for the one

291
0:12:10.279,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that will not hold more strongly for the other,

292
0:12:12.387,000 --> 0:12:13,000
if all men are born free,

293
0:12:13.82,000 --> 0:12:15,000
how is it that all women are born slaves,

294
0:12:16.209,000 --> 0:12:18,000
as they must be if being subjected

295
0:12:18.637,000 --> 0:12:2,000
to the inconstant, uncertain,

296
0:12:20.675,000 --> 0:12:22,000
unknown, arbitrary will of men

297
0:12:23.195,000 --> 0:12:25,000
be the perfect condition of slavery?

298
0:12:26.095,000 --> 0:12:27,000
RNG: That sort of co-option

299
0:12:28.028,000 --> 0:12:3,000
is all in the job description of reason.

300
0:12:30.594,000 --> 0:12:32,000
One movement for the expansion of rights

301
0:12:32.769,000 --> 0:12:35,000
inspires another because the logic is the same,

302
0:12:36.659,000 --> 0:12:37,000
and once that's hammered home,

303
0:12:38.558,000 --> 0:12:4,000
it becomes increasingly uncomfortable

304
0:12:41.092,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to ignore the inconsistency.

305
0:12:43.286,000 --> 0:12:45,000
In the 1960s, the Civil Rights Movement

306
0:12:46.081,000 --> 0:12:47,000
inspired the movements for women's rights,

307
0:12:47.999,000 --> 0:12:5,000
children's rights, gay rights and even animal rights.

308
0:12:51.622,000 --> 0:12:53,000
But fully two centuries before,

309
0:12:54.044,000 --> 0:12:56,000
the Enlightenment thinker Jeremy Bentham

310
0:12:56.192,000 --> 0:12:58,000
had exposed the indefensibility

311
0:12:58.894,000 --> 0:13:,000
of customary practices such as

312
0:13:01.336,000 --> 0:13:03,000
the cruelty to animals.

313
0:13:03.439,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Jeremy Bentham: The question is not, can they reason,

314
0:13:05.819,000 --> 0:13:08,000
nor can they talk, but can they suffer?

315
0:13:09.212,000 --> 0:13:11,000
RNG: And the persecution of homosexuals.

316
0:13:12.056,000 --> 0:13:13,000
JB: As to any primary mischief,

317
0:13:14.024,000 --> 0:13:17,000
it's evident that it produces no pain in anyone.

318
0:13:17.281,000 --> 0:13:19,000
On the contrary, it produces pleasure.

319
0:13:19.531,000 --> 0:13:2,000
The partners are both willing.

320
0:13:21.061,000 --> 0:13:22,000
If either of them be unwilling,

321
0:13:22.605,000 --> 0:13:23,000
the act is an offense,

322
0:13:23.963,000 --> 0:13:25,000
totally different in its nature of effects.

323
0:13:26.172,000 --> 0:13:28,000
It's a personal injury. It's a kind of rape.

324
0:13:28.784,000 --> 0:13:3,000
As to the any danger exclusive of pain,

325
0:13:31.028,000 --> 0:13:32,000
the danger, if any, much consist

326
0:13:32.74,000 --> 0:13:33,000
in the tendency of the example.

327
0:13:34.579,000 --> 0:13:37,000
But what is the tendency of this example?

328
0:13:37.713,000 --> 0:13:39,000
To dispose others to engage in the same practices.

329
0:13:39.985,000 --> 0:13:41,000
But this practice produces not pain of any kind

330
0:13:42.679,000 --> 0:13:43,000
to anyone.

331
0:13:44.313,000 --> 0:13:46,000
SP: Still, in every case, it took at least a century

332
0:13:46.779,000 --> 0:13:47,000
for the arguments of these great thinkers

333
0:13:48.638,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to trickle down and infiltrate the population as a whole.

334
0:13:52.043,000 --> 0:13:54,000
It kind of makes you wonder about our own time.

335
0:13:54.522,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Are there practices that we engage in

336
0:13:56.491,000 --> 0:13:58,000
where the arguments against them are there for all to see

337
0:13:59.286,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but nonetheless we persist in them?

338
0:14:01.575,000 --> 0:14:03,000
RNG: When our great grandchildren look back at us,

339
0:14:04.567,000 --> 0:14:07,000
will they be as appalled by some of our practices

340
0:14:07.782,000 --> 0:14:1,000
as we are by our slave-owning, heretic-burning,

341
0:14:11.441,000 --> 0:14:14,000
wife-beating, gay-bashing ancestors?

342
0:14:14.529,000 --> 0:14:16,000
SP: I'm sure everyone here could think of an example.

343
0:14:17.321,000 --> 0:14:19,000
RNG: I opt for the mistreatment of animals

344
0:14:19.351,000 --> 0:14:2,000
in factory farms.

345
0:14:21.062,000 --> 0:14:23,000
SP: The imprisonment of nonviolent drug offenders

346
0:14:23.292,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and the toleration of rape in our nation's prisons.

347
0:14:25.994,000 --> 0:14:27,000
RNG: Scrimping on donations to life-saving charities

348
0:14:28.719,000 --> 0:14:29,000
in the developing world.

349
0:14:30.376,000 --> 0:14:32,000
SP: The possession of nuclear weapons.

350
0:14:32.718,000 --> 0:14:34,000
RNG: The appeal to religion to justify

351
0:14:35.095,000 --> 0:14:36,000
the otherwise unjustifiable,

352
0:14:36.735,000 --> 0:14:38,000
such as the ban on contraception.

353
0:14:39.247,000 --> 0:14:4,000
SP: What about religious faith in general?

354
0:14:41.035,000 --> 0:14:43,000
RNG: Eh, I'm not holding my breath.

355
0:14:43.216,000 --> 0:14:45,000
SP: Still, I have become convinced

356
0:14:45.273,000 --> 0:14:46,000
that reason is a better angel

357
0:14:46.984,000 --> 0:14:47,000
that deserves the greatest credit

358
0:14:48.556,000 --> 0:14:5,000
for the moral progress our species has enjoyed

359
0:14:51.21,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and that holds out the greatest hope

360
0:14:53.325,000 --> 0:14:55,000
for continuing moral progress in the future.

361
0:14:56.141,000 --> 0:14:57,000
RNG: And if, our friends,

362
0:14:58.043,000 --> 0:15:,000
you detect a flaw in this argument,

363
0:15:00.723,000 --> 0:15:03,000
just remember you'll be depending on reason

364
0:15:04.045,000 --> 0:15:05,000
to point it out.

365
0:15:05.416,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Thank you. SP: Thank you.

366
0:15:08.13,000 --> 0:15:14,000
(Applause)

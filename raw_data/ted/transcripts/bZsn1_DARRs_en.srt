1
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:15,000
You're watching the life cycle of a Streptomyces coelicolor.

2
0:00:17.52,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It's a strain of bacteria that's found in the soil

3
0:00:19.92,000 --> 0:00:21,000
where it lives in a community with other organisms,

4
0:00:22.36,000 --> 0:00:23,000
decomposing organic matter.

5
0:00:24.68,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Coelicolor is a beautiful organism.

6
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
A powerhouse for synthesizing organic chemical compounds.

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It produces an antibiotic called actinorhodin,

8
0:00:34.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
which ranges in color from blue to pink and purple,

9
0:00:38.76,000 --> 0:00:4,000
depending on the acidity of its environment.

10
0:00:41.92,000 --> 0:00:44,000
That it produces these pigment molecules sparked my curiosity

11
0:00:45.08,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and led me to collaborate closely with coelicolor.

12
0:00:48.28,000 --> 0:00:5,000
It is an unlikely partnership,

13
0:00:50.36,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but it's one that completely transformed my practice as a materials designer.

14
0:00:55.56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
From it, I understood how nature was going to completely revolutionize

15
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:02,000
how we design and build our environments,

16
0:01:02.88,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and that organisms like coelicolor

17
0:01:05.36,000 --> 0:01:07,000
were going to help us grow our material future.

18
0:01:08.72,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So what's wrong with things as they are?

19
0:01:12.56,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Well, for the last century,

20
0:01:13.92,000 --> 0:01:16,000
we've organized ourselves around fossil fuels,

21
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:2,000
arguably, the most valuable material system we have ever known.

22
0:01:20.08,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We are tethered to this resource, and we've crafted a dependency on it

23
0:01:23.8,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that defines our identities, cultures, our ways of making and our economies.

24
0:01:29.36,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But our fossil fuel-based activities are reshaping the earth

25
0:01:33.88,000 --> 0:01:37,000
with a kind of violence that is capable of dramatically changing the climate,

26
0:01:38.48,000 --> 0:01:41,000
of accelerating a loss of biodiversity

27
0:01:41.88,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and even sustaining human conflict.

28
0:01:44.64,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We're living in a world

29
0:01:45.92,000 --> 0:01:48,000
where the denial of this dependence has become deadly.

30
0:01:50.2,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And its reasons are multiple,

31
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
but they include the privilege of not being affected

32
0:01:56.6,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and what I believe is a profound lack of imagination

33
0:02:00.36,000 --> 0:02:02,000
about how else we could live

34
0:02:02.4,000 --> 0:02:04,000
within the limits of this planet's boundaries.

35
0:02:06.2,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Fossil fuels will one day give way to renewable energy.

36
0:02:10.84,000 --> 0:02:12,000
That means we need to find new material systems

37
0:02:13.24,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that are not petroleum-based.

38
0:02:15.36,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I believe that those material systems will be biological,

39
0:02:19.08,000 --> 0:02:22,000
but what matters is how we design and build them.

40
0:02:22.199,000 --> 0:02:26,000
They mustn't perpetuate the destructive legacies of the oil age.

41
0:02:27.96,000 --> 0:02:29,000
When you look at this image,

42
0:02:30.08,000 --> 0:02:31,000
what do you see?

43
0:02:33.68,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Well, I see a highly sophisticated biological system,

44
0:02:37.32,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that through the use of enzymes,

45
0:02:39.4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
can move and place atoms more quickly and precisely

46
0:02:42.48,000 --> 0:02:43,000
than anything we've ever engineered.

47
0:02:45.12,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And we know that it can do this at scale.

48
0:02:48.92,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Nature has evolved over 3.8 billion years

49
0:02:51.84,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to be able to do this,

50
0:02:53.72,000 --> 0:02:55,000
but now through the use of synthetic biology,

51
0:02:56.72,000 --> 0:02:57,000
an emerging scientific discipline

52
0:02:58.36,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that seeks to customize this functionality of living systems,

53
0:03:02.36,000 --> 0:03:05,000
we can now rapid prototype the assembly of DNA.

54
0:03:07.12,000 --> 0:03:11,000
That means that we can engineer the kind of biological precision

55
0:03:11.56,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that makes it possible to design a bacteria

56
0:03:16.12,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that can recycle metal,

57
0:03:18.24,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to grow fungi into furniture

58
0:03:20.24,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and even sequester renewable energy from algae.

59
0:03:24.84,000 --> 0:03:28,000
To think about how we might access this inherent brilliance of nature --

60
0:03:29.68,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to build things from living things --

61
0:03:32.48,000 --> 0:03:35,000
let's consider the biological process of fermentation.

62
0:03:35.64,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I've come to think of fermentation, when harnessed by humans,

63
0:03:39.32,000 --> 0:03:42,000
as an advanced technological toolkit for our survival.

64
0:03:42.6,000 --> 0:03:44,000
When a solid or a liquid ferments,

65
0:03:44.68,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it's chemically broken down by bacterial fungi.

66
0:03:47.88,000 --> 0:03:49,000
The byproduct of this is what we value.

67
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So for example, we add yeast to grapes to make wine.

68
0:03:54.84,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Well in nature, these transformations are part of a complex network --

69
0:03:59.36,000 --> 0:04:02,000
a continuous cycle that redistributes energy.

70
0:04:02.4,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Fermentation gives rise to multispecies interactions

71
0:04:05.28,000 --> 0:04:07,000
of bacteria and fungi,

72
0:04:07.44,000 --> 0:04:09,000
plants, insects, animals and humans:

73
0:04:10.08,000 --> 0:04:12,000
in other words, whole ecosystems.

74
0:04:13.12,000 --> 0:04:16,000
We've known about these powerful microbial interactions

75
0:04:16.8,000 --> 0:04:18,000
for thousands of years.

76
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:21,000
You can see how through the fermentation of grains,

77
0:04:21.92,000 --> 0:04:23,000
vegetal matter and animal products,

78
0:04:24.6,000 --> 0:04:28,000
all peoples and cultures of the world have domesticated microorganisms

79
0:04:29.32,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to make the inedible edible.

80
0:04:31.839,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And there's even evidence that as early as 350 AD,

81
0:04:36.2,000 --> 0:04:4,000
people deliberately fermented foodstuffs that contained antibiotics.

82
0:04:41.04,000 --> 0:04:43,000
The skeletal remains of some Sudanese Nubian

83
0:04:43.72,000 --> 0:04:46,000
were found to contain significant deposits of tetracycline.

84
0:04:47.6,000 --> 0:04:49,000
That's an antibiotic that we use in modern medicine today.

85
0:04:51.44,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And nearly 1500 years later,

86
0:04:54.96,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Alexander Fleming discovered the antimicrobial properties of mold.

87
0:04:59.44,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And it was only through the industrialized fermentation of penicillin

88
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:06,000
that millions could survive infectious diseases.

89
0:05:07.52,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Fermentation could once again play an important role

90
0:05:10.72,000 --> 0:05:12,000
in our human development.

91
0:05:13.04,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Could it represent a new mode of survival

92
0:05:15.72,000 --> 0:05:18,000
if we harness it to completely change our industries?

93
0:05:19.88,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I've worked in my creative career to develop new material systems

94
0:05:23.4,000 --> 0:05:24,000
for the textile industry.

95
0:05:24.96,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And while it is work that I love,

96
0:05:27.24,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I cannot reconcile with the fact that the textile industry

97
0:05:29.979,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is one of the most polluting in the world.

98
0:05:32.28,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Most of the ecological harm caused by textile processing

99
0:05:37.12,000 --> 0:05:39,000
occurs at the finishing and the dyeing stage.

100
0:05:40.84,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Processing textiles requires huge amounts of water.

101
0:05:45.12,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And since the oil age completely transformed the textile industry,

102
0:05:49.56,000 --> 0:05:5,000
many of the materials

103
0:05:50.84,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and the chemicals used to process them are petroleum based.

104
0:05:55.4,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And so coupled with our insatiable appetite for fast fashion,

105
0:06:00.68,000 --> 0:06:04,000
a huge amount of textile waste is ending up in landfill every year

106
0:06:05.4,000 --> 0:06:08,000
because it remains notoriously difficult to recycle.

107
0:06:09.64,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So again, contrast this with biology.

108
0:06:13.12,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Evolved over 3.8 billion years,

109
0:06:16.24,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to rapid prototype,

110
0:06:18.12,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to recycle and to replenish

111
0:06:20.72,000 --> 0:06:22,000
better than any system we've ever engineered.

112
0:06:24.48,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I was inspired by this immense potential

113
0:06:26.84,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and wanted to explore it through a seemingly simple question --

114
0:06:30.8,000 --> 0:06:31,000
at the time.

115
0:06:32.88,000 --> 0:06:34,000
If a bacteria produces a pigment,

116
0:06:35.4,000 --> 0:06:37,000
how do we work with it to dye textiles?

117
0:06:39.08,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Well, one of my favorite ways

118
0:06:41.48,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is to grow Streptomyces coelicolor directly onto silk.

119
0:06:46.56,000 --> 0:06:5,000
You can see how each colony produces pigment around its own territory.

120
0:06:51.72,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Now, if you add many, many cells,

121
0:06:54.48,000 --> 0:06:59,000
they generate enough dyestuff to saturate the entire cloth.

122
0:07:07.12,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now, the magical thing about dyeing textiles in this way --

123
0:07:10.84,000 --> 0:07:11,000
this sort of direct fermentation

124
0:07:12.44,000 --> 0:07:15,000
when you add the bacteria directly onto the silk --

125
0:07:16.36,000 --> 0:07:19,000
is that to dye one t-shirt,

126
0:07:19.6,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the bacteria survive on just 200 milliliters of water.

127
0:07:24.36,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And you can see how this process generates very little runoff

128
0:07:29.68,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and produces a colorfast pigment without the use of any chemicals.

129
0:07:35.28,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So now you're thinking --

130
0:07:36.84,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and you're thinking right --

131
0:07:39.36,000 --> 0:07:44,000
an inherent problem associated with designing with a living system is:

132
0:07:44.42,000 --> 0:07:47,000
How do you guide a medium that has a life force of its own?

133
0:07:48.48,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Well, once you've established the baseline for cultivating Streptomyces

134
0:07:53.88,000 --> 0:07:56,000
so that it consistently produces enough pigment,

135
0:07:57.12,000 --> 0:08:,000
you can turn to twisting, folding,

136
0:08:00.2,000 --> 0:08:02,000
clamping, dipping, spraying,

137
0:08:03.08,000 --> 0:08:04,000
submerging --

138
0:08:04.64,000 --> 0:08:09,000
all of these begin to inform the aesthetics of coelicolor's activity.

139
0:08:10.88,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And using them in a systematic way

140
0:08:12.64,000 --> 0:08:15,000
enables us to be able to generate an organic pattern ...

141
0:08:18.32,000 --> 0:08:19,000
a uniform dye ...

142
0:08:21.04,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and even a graphic print.

143
0:08:25.24,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Another problem is how to scale these artisanal methods of making

144
0:08:31.36,000 --> 0:08:34,000
so that we can start to use them in industry.

145
0:08:36.8,000 --> 0:08:37,000
When we talk about scale,

146
0:08:38.28,000 --> 0:08:4,000
we consider two things in parallel:

147
0:08:40.84,000 --> 0:08:41,000
scaling the biology,

148
0:08:42.48,000 --> 0:08:44,000
and then scaling the tools and the processes

149
0:08:45.36,000 --> 0:08:46,000
required to work with the biology.

150
0:08:48.44,000 --> 0:08:49,000
If we can do this,

151
0:08:49.679,000 --> 0:08:51,000
then we can move what happens on a petri dish

152
0:08:52.08,000 --> 0:08:54,000
so that it can meet the human scale,

153
0:08:54.6,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and then hopefully the architecture of our environments.

154
0:09:02.76,000 --> 0:09:03,000
If Fleming were alive today,

155
0:09:04.2,000 --> 0:09:06,000
this would definitely be a part of his toolkit.

156
0:09:07.76,000 --> 0:09:09,000
You're looking at our current best guess

157
0:09:10.6,000 --> 0:09:11,000
of how to scale biology.

158
0:09:13.28,000 --> 0:09:14,000
It's a bioreactor;

159
0:09:14.56,000 --> 0:09:17,000
a kind of microorganism brewery that contains yeasts

160
0:09:17.68,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that have been engineered to produce specific commodity chemicals and compounds

161
0:09:22.84,000 --> 0:09:24,000
like fragrances and flavors.

162
0:09:25.76,000 --> 0:09:28,000
It's actually connected to a suite of automated hardware and software

163
0:09:29.28,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that read in real time

164
0:09:31.24,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and feed back to a design team the growth conditions of the microbe.

165
0:09:37.44,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So we can use this system to model the growth characteristics

166
0:09:40.56,000 --> 0:09:42,000
of an organism like coelicolor

167
0:09:43.2,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to see how it would ferment at 50,000 liters.

168
0:09:47.8,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I'm currently based at Ginkgo Bioworks,

169
0:09:50.64,000 --> 0:09:52,000
which is a biotechnology startup in Boston.

170
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I am working to see how their platform for scaling biology

171
0:09:58.52,000 --> 0:10:03,000
interfaces with my artisanal methods of designing with bacteria for textiles.

172
0:10:03.8,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We're doing things like engineering Streptomyces coelicolor

173
0:10:08.12,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to see if it can produce more pigment.

174
0:10:11.64,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And we're even looking at the tools for synthetic biology.

175
0:10:15.8,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Tools that have been designed specifically to automate synthetic biology

176
0:10:20.72,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to see how they could adapt to become tools to print and dye textiles.

177
0:10:25.44,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I'm also leveraging digital fabrication,

178
0:10:28.52,000 --> 0:10:31,000
because the tools that I need to work with Streptomyces coelicolor

179
0:10:32.12,000 --> 0:10:33,000
don't actually exist.

180
0:10:34.04,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So in this case --

181
0:10:35.6,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in the last week actually,

182
0:10:37.04,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I've just designed a petri dish

183
0:10:39.32,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that is engineered to produce a bespoke print on a whole garment.

184
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:45,000
We're making lots of kimonos.

185
0:10:46.76,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Here's the exciting thing:

186
0:10:48.76,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I'm not alone.

187
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
There are others who are building capacity in this field,

188
0:10:53.08,000 --> 0:10:54,000
like MycoWorks.

189
0:10:55.04,000 --> 0:10:56,000
MycoWorks is a startup

190
0:10:56.8,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that wants to replace animal leather with mushroom leather,

191
0:10:59.76,000 --> 0:11:01,000
a versatile, high-performance material

192
0:11:02.44,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that has applications beyond textiles and into product and architecture.

193
0:11:07.84,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And Bolt Threads --

194
0:11:09.6,000 --> 0:11:14,000
they've engineered a yeast to produce spider-silk protein

195
0:11:14.88,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that can be spun into a highly programmable yarn.

196
0:11:18.8,000 --> 0:11:19,000
So think water resistance,

197
0:11:20.68,000 --> 0:11:22,000
stretchability and superstrength.

198
0:11:24.48,000 --> 0:11:25,000
To reach economies of scale,

199
0:11:26.4,000 --> 0:11:3,000
these kinds of startups are having to build and design

200
0:11:31.12,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and engineer the infrastructure to work with biology.

201
0:11:34.64,000 --> 0:11:35,000
For example,

202
0:11:35.88,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Bolt Threads have had to engage in some extreme biomimicry.

203
0:11:40.36,000 --> 0:11:45,000
To be able to spin the product this yeast creates into a yarn,

204
0:11:45.68,000 --> 0:11:48,000
they've engineered a yarn-making machine

205
0:11:49.12,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that mimics the physiological conditions

206
0:11:52.04,000 --> 0:11:55,000
under which spiders ordinarily spin their own silk.

207
0:11:56.96,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So you can start to see how imaginative

208
0:12:00.48,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and inspiring modes of making exist in nature

209
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that we can use to build capacity around new bio-based industries.

210
0:12:11.84,000 --> 0:12:13,000
What we now have is the technology

211
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to design, build, test and scale these capabilities.

212
0:12:19.84,000 --> 0:12:2,000
At this present moment,

213
0:12:21.12,000 --> 0:12:25,000
as we face the ecological crisis in front of us,

214
0:12:25.8,000 --> 0:12:27,000
what we have to do is to determine

215
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
how we're going to build these new material systems

216
0:12:31.36,000 --> 0:12:36,000
so that they don't mirror the damaging legacies of the oil age.

217
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
How we're going to distribute them to ensure a sustainable development

218
0:12:41.64,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that is fair and equitable across the world.

219
0:12:44.44,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And crucially, how we would like the regulatory and ethical frameworks

220
0:12:47.92,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that govern these technologies

221
0:12:49.4,000 --> 0:12:5,000
to interact with our society.

222
0:12:52.4,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Biotechnology is going to touch every part of our lived experience.

223
0:12:56.08,000 --> 0:12:57,000
It is living;

224
0:12:57.32,000 --> 0:12:58,000
it is digital;

225
0:12:58.8,000 --> 0:13:,000
it is designed, and it can be crafted.

226
0:13:01.6,000 --> 0:13:04,000
This is a material future that we must be bold enough to shape.

227
0:13:05.36,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Thank you.

228
0:13:06.8,000 --> 0:13:08,000
(Applause)

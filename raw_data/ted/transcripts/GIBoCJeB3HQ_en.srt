1
0:00:13.125,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm here to tell you

2
0:00:15.167,000 --> 0:00:18,000
how change is happening at a local level in Pakistan,

3
0:00:19.042,000 --> 0:00:22,000
because women are finding their place in the political process.

4
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I want to take you all on a journey to the place I was raised,

5
0:00:29.417,000 --> 0:00:32,000
northwest Pakistan, called Dir.

6
0:00:32.75,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Dir was founded in the 17th century.

7
0:00:36.458,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It was a princely state until its merger with Pakistan in 1969.

8
0:00:41.75,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Our prince, Nawab Shah Jahan, reserved the right to wear white,

9
0:00:47.375,000 --> 0:00:49,000
the color of honor, but only for himself.

10
0:00:51.25,000 --> 0:00:53,000
He didn't believe in educating his people.

11
0:00:55.333,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And at the time of my birth in 1979,

12
0:00:58.667,000 --> 0:01:02,000
only five percent of boys and one percent of girls

13
0:01:02.708,000 --> 0:01:03,000
received any schooling at all.

14
0:01:06.208,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I was one among that one percent.

15
0:01:12.625,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Growing up, I was very close to my father.

16
0:01:17.542,000 --> 0:01:2,000
He is a pharmacy doctor, and he sent me to school.

17
0:01:22.625,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Every day, I would go to his clinic when my lessons finished.

18
0:01:27.375,000 --> 0:01:3,000
He's a wonderful man and a well-respected community leader.

19
0:01:32.917,000 --> 0:01:35,000
He was leading a welfare organization,

20
0:01:36.042,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and I would go with him to the social and political gatherings

21
0:01:39.375,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to listen and talk to the local men about our social and economic problems.

22
0:01:44.667,000 --> 0:01:47,000
However, when I was 16,

23
0:01:48.583,000 --> 0:01:52,000
my father asked me to stop coming with him to the public gatherings.

24
0:01:54.042,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now, I was a young woman, and my place was in the home.

25
0:01:58.792,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I was very upset.

26
0:02:01.125,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But most of my family members, they were happy with this decision.

27
0:02:05.833,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It was very difficult for me

28
0:02:07.833,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to sit back in the home and not be involved.

29
0:02:13.75,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It took two years

30
0:02:16.25,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that finally my family agreed that my father could reconnect me

31
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:21,000
with women and girls,

32
0:02:21.958,000 --> 0:02:24,000
so they could share their problems and together we could resolve them.

33
0:02:27.583,000 --> 0:02:29,000
So, with his blessings,

34
0:02:29.625,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I started to reconnect with women and girls

35
0:02:33.25,000 --> 0:02:35,000
so we could resolve their problems together.

36
0:02:37.625,000 --> 0:02:38,000
When women show up,

37
0:02:39.625,000 --> 0:02:43,000
they bring their realities and views with them.

38
0:02:45.75,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And yet, I have found all too often,

39
0:02:49.083,000 --> 0:02:51,000
women underestimate their own strength,

40
0:02:51.917,000 --> 0:02:53,000
their potential and their self-respect.

41
0:02:56.125,000 --> 0:02:59,000
However, while connecting with these women and girls,

42
0:03:00.833,000 --> 0:03:01,000
it became very clear to me

43
0:03:02.833,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that if there was to be any hope to create a better life

44
0:03:07.833,000 --> 0:03:09,000
for these women and girls and their families,

45
0:03:10.583,000 --> 0:03:12,000
we must stand up for our own rights --

46
0:03:13.167,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and not wait for someone else to come and help us.

47
0:03:18.208,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So I took a huge leap of faith

48
0:03:22.042,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and founded my own organization in '94

49
0:03:26.125,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to create our very own platform for women empowerment.

50
0:03:31.875,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I engaged many women and girls to work with me.

51
0:03:35.625,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It was hard.

52
0:03:37.875,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Many of the women working with me had to leave once they got married,

53
0:03:41.75,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because their husbands wouldn't let them work.

54
0:03:45.583,000 --> 0:03:48,000
One colleague of mine was given away by her family

55
0:03:49.542,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to make amends for a crime her brother had committed.

56
0:03:55.333,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I couldn't help her.

57
0:03:57.25,000 --> 0:04:,000
And I felt so helpless at that time.

58
0:04:02.208,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But it made me more determined to continue my struggle.

59
0:04:08.5,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I saw many practices like these,

60
0:04:11.583,000 --> 0:04:15,000
where these women suffered silently, bearing this brutality.

61
0:04:16.917,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But when I see a woman

62
0:04:18.833,000 --> 0:04:22,000
struggling to change her situation instead of giving up,

63
0:04:23.417,000 --> 0:04:24,000
it motivates me.

64
0:04:26.083,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So I ran for a public office

65
0:04:30.25,000 --> 0:04:33,000
as an independent candidate in Lower Dir

66
0:04:33.333,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in the local elections in 2001.

67
0:04:37.542,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Despite all the challenges and hurdles I faced throughout this process, I won.

68
0:04:43.333,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Applause)

69
0:04:49.458,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I served in the public office for six years.

70
0:04:54.375,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But unfortunately,

71
0:04:56.375,000 --> 0:04:58,000
we women, elected women,

72
0:04:58.625,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we were not allowed to sit in the council together with all the members

73
0:05:04.792,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and to take part in the proceedings.

74
0:05:08.083,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We had to sit in a separate, ladies-only room,

75
0:05:11.417,000 --> 0:05:13,000
not even aware what was happening in the council.

76
0:05:16.958,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Men told me

77
0:05:19.167,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that, "You women, elected women members,

78
0:05:23.917,000 --> 0:05:25,000
should buy sewing machines for women."

79
0:05:27.292,000 --> 0:05:31,000
When I knew what they needed the most was access to clean drinking water.

80
0:05:33.208,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So I did everything I could do

81
0:05:36.042,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to prioritize the real challenges these women faced.

82
0:05:41.667,000 --> 0:05:46,000
I set up five hand pumps in the two dried up wells in my locality.

83
0:05:48.167,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Well, we got them working again.

84
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Before long, we made water accessible for over 5,000 families.

85
0:05:59.5,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We proved that anything the men could do,

86
0:06:02.625,000 --> 0:06:03,000
so could we women.

87
0:06:05.958,000 --> 0:06:08,000
I built alliances with other elected women members,

88
0:06:09.375,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and last year,

89
0:06:10.875,000 --> 0:06:14,000
we women were allowed to sit together with all the members in the council.

90
0:06:15.625,000 --> 0:06:21,000
(Applause)

91
0:06:23.542,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And to take part in the legislation and planning and budgeting,

92
0:06:30.333,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in all the decisions.

93
0:06:33.083,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I saw there is strength in numbers.

94
0:06:36.208,000 --> 0:06:37,000
You know yourselves.

95
0:06:38.042,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Lack of representation means no one is fighting for you.

96
0:06:43.333,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Pakistan is --

97
0:06:45.625,000 --> 0:06:49,000
We're 8,000 miles away from where I'm here with you today.

98
0:06:52.167,000 --> 0:06:56,000
But I hope what I'm about to tell you will resonate with you,

99
0:06:57.917,000 --> 0:07:01,000
though we have this big distance in miles and in our cultures.

100
0:07:04.167,000 --> 0:07:05,000
When women show up,

101
0:07:05.917,000 --> 0:07:08,000
they bring the realities and hopes of half a population with them.

102
0:07:12.667,000 --> 0:07:17,000
In 2007, we saw the rise of the Taliban

103
0:07:18.333,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in Swat, Dir and nearby districts.

104
0:07:23.292,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It was horrifying.

105
0:07:25.917,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The Taliban killed innocent people.

106
0:07:30.5,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Almost every day,

107
0:07:32.125,000 --> 0:07:35,000
people collected the dead bodies of their loved ones from the streets.

108
0:07:36.5,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Most of the social and political leaders

109
0:07:39.042,000 --> 0:07:42,000
struggling and working for the betterment of their communities

110
0:07:42.292,000 --> 0:07:43,000
were threatened and targeted.

111
0:07:46.375,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Even I had to leave,

112
0:07:48.417,000 --> 0:07:5,000
leaving my children behind with my in-laws.

113
0:07:54.917,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I closed my office in Dir and relocated to Peshawar,

114
0:08:00.042,000 --> 0:08:01,000
the capital of my province.

115
0:08:03.083,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I was in trauma, kept thinking what to do next.

116
0:08:09.25,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And most of the family members and friends

117
0:08:13.542,000 --> 0:08:16,000
were suggesting, "Shad, stop working.

118
0:08:17.208,000 --> 0:08:18,000
The threat is very serious."

119
0:08:20.5,000 --> 0:08:21,000
But I persisted.

120
0:08:24.792,000 --> 0:08:3,000
In 2009, we experienced a historic influx of internally displaced persons,

121
0:08:31.708,000 --> 0:08:33,000
from Swat, Dir and other nearby districts.

122
0:08:35.5,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I started visiting the camps almost every day,

123
0:08:40.625,000 --> 0:08:42,000
until the internally displaced persons

124
0:08:42.875,000 --> 0:08:44,000
started to go back to their place of origin.

125
0:08:45.875,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I established four mother-child health care units,

126
0:08:50.582,000 --> 0:08:53,000
especially to take care of over 10,000 women and children

127
0:08:54.582,000 --> 0:08:55,000
nearby the camps.

128
0:08:57.25,000 --> 0:09:01,000
But you know, during all these visits,

129
0:09:02.25,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I observed that there was very little attention towards women's needs.

130
0:09:08.583,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And I was looking for what is the reason behind it.

131
0:09:11.292,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And I found it was because of the underrepresentation of women

132
0:09:16.625,000 --> 0:09:2,000
in both social and political platforms, in our society as a whole.

133
0:09:21.75,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And that was the time when I realized

134
0:09:25.042,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that I need to narrow down my focus

135
0:09:27.792,000 --> 0:09:3,000
on building and strengthening women's political leadership

136
0:09:32.458,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to increase their political representation,

137
0:09:34.75,000 --> 0:09:36,000
so they would have their own voice in their future.

138
0:09:38.25,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So we started training around 300 potential women and youth

139
0:09:42.833,000 --> 0:09:45,000
for the upcoming local elections in 2015.

140
0:09:47.75,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And you know what?

141
0:09:49.375,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Fifty percent of them won.

142
0:09:51.708,000 --> 0:09:58,000
(Applause)

143
0:09:58.958,000 --> 0:10:01,000
And they are now sitting in the councils,

144
0:10:02.042,000 --> 0:10:06,000
taking part actively in the legislation, planning and budgeting.

145
0:10:09.375,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Most of them are now investing their funds

146
0:10:12.875,000 --> 0:10:16,000
on women's health, education, skill development and safe drinking water.

147
0:10:18.708,000 --> 0:10:2,000
All these elected women now

148
0:10:20.875,000 --> 0:10:22,000
share, discuss and resolve their problems together.

149
0:10:25.333,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Let me tell you about two of the women I have been working with:

150
0:10:29.375,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Saira Shams.

151
0:10:31.25,000 --> 0:10:35,000
You can see, this young lady, age 26,

152
0:10:35.625,000 --> 0:10:4,000
she ran for a public office in 2015 in Lower Dir, and she won.

153
0:10:42.417,000 --> 0:10:45,000
She completed two of the community infrastructure schemes.

154
0:10:45.75,000 --> 0:10:48,000
You know, women, community infrastructure schemes ...

155
0:10:51.25,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Some people think this is men's job.

156
0:10:55.833,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But no, this is women's job, too, we can do it.

157
0:10:59.833,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And she also fixed two of the roads leading towards girls schools,

158
0:11:05.75,000 --> 0:11:07,000
knowing that without access to these schools,

159
0:11:07.917,000 --> 0:11:08,000
they are useless to the girls of Dir.

160
0:11:11.417,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And another young woman is Asma Gul.

161
0:11:14.875,000 --> 0:11:18,000
She is a very active member of the young leaders forum we established.

162
0:11:19.375,000 --> 0:11:21,000
She was unable to run for the public office,

163
0:11:23.125,000 --> 0:11:27,000
so she has become the first female journalist of our region.

164
0:11:29.292,000 --> 0:11:34,000
She speaks and writes for women's and girls' issues and their rights.

165
0:11:35.417,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Saira and Asma, they are the living examples

166
0:11:39.125,000 --> 0:11:42,000
of the importance of inclusion and representation.

167
0:11:44.958,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Let me tell you this, too.

168
0:11:47.042,000 --> 0:11:49,000
In the 2013 general elections in Pakistan

169
0:11:49.875,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and the local elections in 2015,

170
0:11:54.5,000 --> 0:11:56,000
there were less than 100 women voters in Dir.

171
0:11:58.833,000 --> 0:11:59,000
But you know what?

172
0:12:00.125,000 --> 0:12:04,000
I'm proud to tell you that this year, during the general elections,

173
0:12:04.792,000 --> 0:12:07,000
there were 93,000 women voters in Dir.

174
0:12:08.125,000 --> 0:12:14,000
(Applause)

175
0:12:16.042,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So our struggle is far from over.

176
0:12:19.958,000 --> 0:12:21,000
But this shift is historic.

177
0:12:22.167,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And a sign that women are standing up, showing up and making it absolutely clear

178
0:12:28.25,000 --> 0:12:32,000
that we all must invest in building women's leadership.

179
0:12:37.167,000 --> 0:12:4,000
In Pakistan and here in the United States,

180
0:12:41.042,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and everywhere in the world,

181
0:12:43.5,000 --> 0:12:47,000
this means women in politics, women in business

182
0:12:47.917,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and women in positions of power making important decisions.

183
0:12:54.833,000 --> 0:12:57,000
It took me 23 years to get here.

184
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:02,000
But I don't want any girl or any woman

185
0:13:02.875,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to take 23 years of her life to make herself heard.

186
0:13:08.458,000 --> 0:13:1,000
I have had some dark days.

187
0:13:12.917,000 --> 0:13:15,000
But I have spent every waking moment of my life

188
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
working for the right of every woman to live her full potential.

189
0:13:21.875,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Imagine with me a world

190
0:13:25.333,000 --> 0:13:27,000
where thousands of us stand up

191
0:13:29.292,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and they support other young women together,

192
0:13:33.458,000 --> 0:13:37,000
creating opportunities and choices that benefit all.

193
0:13:39.75,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And that, my friends, can change the world.

194
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Thank you.

195
0:13:45.292,000 --> 0:13:5,000
(Applause)

0:00:13,000 --> 0:00:15,000
If your life were a book

3
0:00:15,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and you were the author,

4
0:00:19,000 --> 0:00:22,000
how would you want your story to go?

5
0:00:22.573,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That's the question that changed my life forever.

6
0:00:27.002,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Growing up in the hot Last Vegas desert,

7
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
all I wanted was to be free.

8
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I would daydream about traveling the world,

9
0:00:37,000 --> 0:00:4,000
living in a place where it snowed,

10
0:00:4,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and I would picture all of the stories

11
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that I would go on to tell.

12
0:00:46,000 --> 0:00:48,000
At the age of 19,

13
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the day after I graduated high school,

14
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I moved to a place where it snowed

15
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and I became a massage therapist.

16
0:00:56,000 --> 0:00:59,000
With this job all I needed were my hands

17
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and my massage table by my side

18
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and I could go anywhere.

19
0:01:05.245,000 --> 0:01:07,000
For the first time in my life,

20
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I felt free, independent

21
0:01:11.53,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and completely in control of my life.

22
0:01:16.574,000 --> 0:01:21,000
That is, until my life took a detour.

23
0:01:22.01,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I went home from work early one day

24
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:26,000
with what I thought was the flu,

25
0:01:26.82,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and less than 24 hours later

26
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I was in the hospital

27
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:34,000
on life support

28
0:01:34,000 --> 0:01:37,000
with less than a two percent chance of living.

29
0:01:37.01,000 --> 0:01:39,000
It wasn't until days later

30
0:01:39.52,000 --> 0:01:41,000
as I lay in a coma

31
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that the doctors diagnosed me

32
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:47,000
with bacterial meningitis,

33
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:51,000
a vaccine-preventable blood infection.

34
0:01:51.563,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Over the course of two and a half months

35
0:01:53.978,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I lost my spleen, my kidneys,

36
0:01:57.67,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the hearing in my left ear

37
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and both of my legs below the knee.

38
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:07,000
When my parents wheeled me out of the hospital

39
0:02:07.824,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I felt like I had been pieced back together

40
0:02:10.682,000 --> 0:02:13,000
like a patchwork doll.

41
0:02:14.008,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I thought the worst was over

42
0:02:16.607,000 --> 0:02:18,000
until weeks later when I saw my new legs

43
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:21,000
for the first time.

44
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The calves were bulky blocks of metal

45
0:02:25.792,000 --> 0:02:28,000
with pipes bolted together for the ankles

46
0:02:29.53,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and a yellow rubber foot

47
0:02:32.011,000 --> 0:02:35,000
with a raised rubber line from the toe to the ankle

48
0:02:35.971,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to look like a vein.

49
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I didn't know what to expect,

50
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but I wasn't expecting that.

51
0:02:44,000 --> 0:02:47,000
With my mom by my side

52
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and tears streaming down our faces,

53
0:02:52.716,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I strapped on these chunky legs

54
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and I stood up.

55
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They were so painful and so confining

56
0:03:03.28,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that all I could think was,

57
0:03:06.01,000 --> 0:03:08,000
how am I ever going to travel the world

58
0:03:08.71,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in these things?

59
0:03:1,000 --> 0:03:12,000
How was I ever going to live

60
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
the life full of adventure and stories,

61
0:03:14.728,000 --> 0:03:16,000
as I always wanted?

62
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And how was I going to snowboard again?

63
0:03:21.844,000 --> 0:03:24,000
That day, I went home, I crawled into bed

64
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and this is what my life looked like

65
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:29,000
for the next few months:

66
0:03:29.441,000 --> 0:03:33,000
me passed out, escaping from reality,

67
0:03:33.64,000 --> 0:03:37,000
with my legs resting by my side.

68
0:03:38.013,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I was absolutely physically and emotionally broken.

69
0:03:46.29,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But I knew that in order to move forward,

70
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I had to let go of the old Amy

71
0:03:55.23,000 --> 0:04:,000
and learn to embrace the new Amy.

72
0:04:01.02,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And that is when it dawned on me

73
0:04:04.35,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that I didn't have to be five-foot-five anymore.

74
0:04:08.08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I could be as tall as I wanted!

75
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:16,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

76
0:04:16.68,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Or as short as I wanted, depending on who I was dating.

77
0:04:20.011,000 --> 0:04:21,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And if I snowboarded again,

79
0:04:24.57,000 --> 0:04:25,000
my feet aren't going to get cold.

80
0:04:26.43,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:28.214,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And best of all, I thought,

82
0:04:30.45,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I can make my feet the size of all the shoes

83
0:04:34.176,000 --> 0:04:36,000
that are on the sales rack. (Laughter)

84
0:04:36.676,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And I did!

85
0:04:38.59,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So there were benefits here.

86
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
It was this moment that I asked myself

87
0:04:43.665,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that life-defining question:

88
0:04:46.592,000 --> 0:04:48,000
If my life were a book

89
0:04:48.932,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and I were the author,

90
0:04:52.15,000 --> 0:04:54,000
how would I want the story to go?

91
0:04:54.96,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And I began to daydream.

92
0:04:57.45,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I daydreamed like I did as a little girl

93
0:05:00.24,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and I imagined myself

94
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:06,000
walking gracefully,

95
0:05:06,000 --> 0:05:08,000
helping other people through my journey

96
0:05:08.441,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and snowboarding again.

97
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And I didn't just see myself

98
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:15,000
carving down a mountain of powder,

99
0:05:15,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I could actually feel it.

100
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I could feel the wind against my face

101
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and the beat of my racing heart

102
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:29,000
as if it were happening in that very moment.

103
0:05:29.01,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And that is when a new chapter in my life began.

104
0:05:35.4,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Four months later I was back up on a snowboard,

105
0:05:38.83,000 --> 0:05:4,000
although things didn't go quite as expected:

106
0:05:41.42,000 --> 0:05:43,000
My knees and my ankles wouldn't bend

107
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and at one point I traumatized all the skiers on the chair lift

108
0:05:48.71,000 --> 0:05:52,000
when I fell and my legs,

109
0:05:53.07,000 --> 0:05:54,000
still attached to my snowboard —

110
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Laughter) —

111
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:02,000
went flying down the mountain,

112
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and I was on top of the mountain still.

113
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I was so shocked,

114
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:11,000
I was just as shocked as everybody else, and I was so discouraged,

115
0:06:11.308,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but I knew that if I could find the right pair of feet

116
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that I would be able to do this again.

117
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And this is when I learned that our borders

118
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and our obstacles can only do two things:

119
0:06:24.028,000 --> 0:06:26,000
one, stop us in our tracks

120
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:31,000
or two, force us to get creative.

121
0:06:31.19,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I did a year of research, still couldn't figure out

122
0:06:33.6,000 --> 0:06:34,000
what kind of legs to use,

123
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
couldn't find any resources that could help me.

124
0:06:37.287,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So I decided to make a pair myself.

125
0:06:40.58,000 --> 0:06:43,000
My leg maker and I put random parts together

126
0:06:43.637,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and we made a pair of feet that I could snowboard in.

127
0:06:46.902,000 --> 0:06:48,000
As you can see,

128
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:56,000
rusted bolts, rubber, wood and neon pink duct tape.

129
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And yes, I can change my toenail polish.

130
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It was these legs

131
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and the best 21st birthday gift I could ever receive —

132
0:07:04.965,000 --> 0:07:06,000
a new kidney from my dad —

133
0:07:07.452,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that allowed me to follow my dreams again.

134
0:07:1,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I started snowboarding,

135
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
then I went back to work, then I went back to school.

136
0:07:14.916,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Then in 2005 I cofounded a nonprofit organization

137
0:07:18.605,000 --> 0:07:2,000
for youth and young adults with physical disabilities

138
0:07:20.852,000 --> 0:07:23,000
so they could get involved with action sports.

139
0:07:24.48,000 --> 0:07:27,000
From there, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa,

140
0:07:28.06,000 --> 0:07:31,000
where I helped to put shoes on thousands of children's feet

141
0:07:31.255,000 --> 0:07:33,000
so they could attend school.

142
0:07:33.461,000 --> 0:07:35,000
And just this past February,

143
0:07:35.67,000 --> 0:07:39,000
I won two back-to-back World Cup gold medals —

144
0:07:40.36,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Applause) —

145
0:07:49.156,000 --> 0:07:5,000
which made me

146
0:07:50.75,000 --> 0:07:53,000
the highest ranked adaptive female snowboarder

147
0:07:54.113,000 --> 0:07:55,000
in the world.

148
0:07:55.759,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Eleven years ago, when I lost my legs,

149
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I had no idea what to expect.

150
0:08:02.449,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But if you ask me today,

151
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
if I would ever want to change my situation,

152
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:09,000
I would have to say no.

153
0:08:09,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Because my legs haven't disabled me,

154
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:13,000
if anything they've enabled me.

155
0:08:13.54,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They've forced me to rely on my imagination

156
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and to believe in the possibilities,

157
0:08:2,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and that's why I believe

158
0:08:21.78,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that our imaginations can be used as tools

159
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
for breaking through borders,

160
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
because in our minds, we can do anything

161
0:08:29,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and we can be anything.

162
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It's believing in those dreams

163
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and facing our fears head-on

164
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that allows us to live our lives

165
0:08:39.57,000 --> 0:08:41,000
beyond our limits.

166
0:08:42.49,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And although today is about innovation without borders,

167
0:08:45.86,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I have to say that in my life,

168
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:51,000
innovation has only been possible

169
0:08:51.428,000 --> 0:08:54,000
because of my borders.

170
0:08:54.6,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I've learned that borders are where the actual ends,

171
0:08:59.005,000 --> 0:09:01,000
but also where the imagination

172
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and the story begins.

173
0:09:04.93,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So the thought that I would like to challenge you with today

174
0:09:07.916,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is that maybe instead of looking at our challenges and our limitations

175
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:15,000
as something negative or bad,

176
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:18,000
we can begin to look at them as blessings,

177
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:23,000
magnificent gifts that can be used to ignite our imaginations

178
0:09:23.525,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and help us go further than we ever knew we could go.

179
0:09:29.027,000 --> 0:09:32,000
It's not about breaking down borders.

180
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
It's about pushing off of them

181
0:09:36.34,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and seeing what amazing places

182
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:41,000
they might bring us.

183
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Thank you.

1
0:00:13.42,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I would like to tell you about the most embarrassing thing

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that has ever happened to me in my years of working as a palliative care physician.

3
0:00:22.66,000 --> 0:00:23,000
This happened a couple of years ago.

4
0:00:24.42,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I was asked as a consultant to see a woman in her 70s --

5
0:00:28.38,000 --> 0:00:31,000
retired English professor who had pancreatic cancer.

6
0:00:32.3,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I was asked to see her because she had pain, nausea, vomiting ...

7
0:00:37.74,000 --> 0:00:39,000
When I went to see her, we talked about those symptoms

8
0:00:40.42,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and in the course of that consultation,

9
0:00:42.34,000 --> 0:00:46,000
she asked me whether I thought that medical marijuana might help her.

10
0:00:48.38,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I thought back to everything

11
0:00:50.5,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that I had learned in medical school about medical marijuana,

12
0:00:53.86,000 --> 0:00:56,000
which didn't take very long because I had learned absolutely nothing.

13
0:00:58.58,000 --> 0:01:,000
And so I told her that as far as I knew,

14
0:01:01.46,000 --> 0:01:04,000
medical marijuana had no benefits whatsoever.

15
0:01:04.94,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And she smiled and nodded and reached into the handbag next to the bed,

16
0:01:09.62,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and pulled out a stack of about a dozen randomized controlled trials

17
0:01:13.66,000 --> 0:01:15,000
showing that medical marijuana has benefits

18
0:01:16.339,000 --> 0:01:2,000
for symptoms like nausea and pain and anxiety.

19
0:01:20.62,000 --> 0:01:22,000
She handed me those articles and said,

20
0:01:23.54,000 --> 0:01:27,000
"Maybe you should read these before offering an opinion ...

21
0:01:28.7,000 --> 0:01:29,000
doctor."

22
0:01:29.94,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:31.18,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So I did.

24
0:01:33.06,000 --> 0:01:36,000
That night I read all of those articles and found a bunch more.

25
0:01:36.58,000 --> 0:01:38,000
When I came to see her the next morning,

26
0:01:38.74,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I had to admit that it looks like there is some evidence

27
0:01:42.5,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that marijuana can offer medical benefits

28
0:01:45.86,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and I suggested that if she really was interested,

29
0:01:49.54,000 --> 0:01:5,000
she should try it.

30
0:01:51.62,000 --> 0:01:52,000
You know what she said?

31
0:01:53.98,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This 73-year-old, retired English professor?

32
0:01:58.02,000 --> 0:02:,000
She said, "I did try it about six months ago.

33
0:02:00.46,000 --> 0:02:01,000
It was amazing.

34
0:02:02.02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I've been using it every day since.

35
0:02:04.74,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It's the best drug I've discovered.

36
0:02:07.02,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I don't know why it took me 73 years to discover this stuff. It's amazing."

37
0:02:11.18,000 --> 0:02:12,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:12.22,000 --> 0:02:14,000
That was the moment at which I realized

39
0:02:14.38,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I needed to learn something about medical marijuana

40
0:02:17.66,000 --> 0:02:19,000
because what I was prepared for in medical school

41
0:02:20.54,000 --> 0:02:22,000
bore no relationship to reality.

42
0:02:23.78,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So I started reading more articles, I started talking to researchers,

43
0:02:27.3,000 --> 0:02:28,000
I started talking to doctors,

44
0:02:28.74,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and most importantly, I started listening to patients.

45
0:02:32.18,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I ended up writing a book based on those conversations,

46
0:02:34.98,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and that book really revolved around three surprises --

47
0:02:38.1,000 --> 0:02:39,000
surprises to me, anyway.

48
0:02:40.1,000 --> 0:02:41,000
One I already alluded to --

49
0:02:41.66,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that there really are some benefits to medical marijuana.

50
0:02:44.82,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Those benefits may not be as huge or as stunning

51
0:02:48.58,000 --> 0:02:5,000
as some of the most avid proponents of medical marijuana

52
0:02:51.54,000 --> 0:02:52,000
would have us believe,

53
0:02:52.78,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but they are real.

54
0:02:54.74,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Surprise number two:

55
0:02:56.18,000 --> 0:02:58,000
medical marijuana does have some risks.

56
0:02:58.9,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Those risks may not be as huge and as scary

57
0:03:01.94,000 --> 0:03:04,000
as some of the opponents of medical marijuana would have us believe,

58
0:03:05.3,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but they are real risks, nonetheless.

59
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But it was the third surprise that was most ...

60
0:03:10.74,000 --> 0:03:11,000
surprising.

61
0:03:12.22,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And that is that a lot of the patients I talked with

62
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
who've turned to medical marijuana for help,

63
0:03:17.98,000 --> 0:03:19,000
weren't turning to medical marijuana because of its benefits

64
0:03:20.94,000 --> 0:03:22,000
or the balance of risks and benefits,

65
0:03:22.98,000 --> 0:03:24,000
or because they thought it was a wonder drug,

66
0:03:25.38,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but because it gave them control over their illness.

67
0:03:29.14,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It let them manage their health

68
0:03:31.34,000 --> 0:03:34,000
in a way that was productive and efficient

69
0:03:34.54,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and effective and comfortable for them.

70
0:03:38.02,000 --> 0:03:4,000
To show you what I mean, let me tell you about another patient.

71
0:03:41.02,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Robin was in her early 40s when I met her.

72
0:03:43.22,000 --> 0:03:46,000
She looked though like she was in her late 60s.

73
0:03:46.62,000 --> 0:03:49,000
She had suffered from rheumatoid arthritis for the last 20 years,

74
0:03:49.9,000 --> 0:03:51,000
her hands were gnarled by arthritis,

75
0:03:52.34,000 --> 0:03:53,000
her spine was crooked,

76
0:03:54.1,000 --> 0:03:56,000
she had to rely on a wheelchair to get around.

77
0:03:56.74,000 --> 0:03:57,000
She looked weak and frail,

78
0:03:58.38,000 --> 0:04:,000
and I guess physically she probably was,

79
0:04:00.66,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but emotionally, cognitively, psychologically,

80
0:04:03.66,000 --> 0:04:06,000
she was among the toughest people I've ever met.

81
0:04:08.06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And when I sat down next to her

82
0:04:09.58,000 --> 0:04:11,000
in a medical marijuana dispensary in Northern California

83
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to ask her about why she turned to medical marijuana,

84
0:04:15.7,000 --> 0:04:17,000
what it did for her and how it helped her,

85
0:04:18.7,000 --> 0:04:19,000
she started out by telling me things

86
0:04:20.46,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that I had heard from many patients before.

87
0:04:22.5,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It helped with her anxiety;

88
0:04:24.5,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it helped with her pain;

89
0:04:25.9,000 --> 0:04:27,000
when her pain was better, she slept better.

90
0:04:27.98,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And I'd heard all that before.

91
0:04:29.46,000 --> 0:04:31,000
But then she said something that I'd never heard before,

92
0:04:32.14,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and that is that it gave her control over her life

93
0:04:35.94,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and over her health.

94
0:04:37.66,000 --> 0:04:39,000
She could use it when she wanted,

95
0:04:39.78,000 --> 0:04:4,000
in the way that she wanted,

96
0:04:41.22,000 --> 0:04:43,000
at the dose and frequency that worked for her.

97
0:04:43.66,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And if it didn't work for her, then she could make changes.

98
0:04:47.06,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Everything was up to her.

99
0:04:48.5,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The most important thing she said

100
0:04:50.22,000 --> 0:04:52,000
was she didn't need anybody else's permission --

101
0:04:52.9,000 --> 0:04:54,000
not a clinic appointment, not a doctor's prescription,

102
0:04:55.54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
not a pharmacist's order.

103
0:04:57.1,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It was all up to her.

104
0:04:59.02,000 --> 0:05:,000
She was in control.

105
0:05:01.62,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And if that seems like a little thing for somebody with chronic illness,

106
0:05:05.06,000 --> 0:05:06,000
it's not -- not at all.

107
0:05:07.1,000 --> 0:05:09,000
When we face a chronic serious illness,

108
0:05:09.3,000 --> 0:05:14,000
whether it's rheumatoid arthritis or lupus or cancer or diabetes,

109
0:05:14.62,000 --> 0:05:15,000
or cirrhosis,

110
0:05:16.14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we lose control.

111
0:05:17.98,000 --> 0:05:19,000
And note what I said: "when," not "if."

112
0:05:20.54,000 --> 0:05:24,000
All of us at some point in our lives will face a chronic serious illness

113
0:05:24.82,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that causes us to lose control.

114
0:05:27.34,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We'll see our function decline, some of us will see our cognition decline,

115
0:05:31.22,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we'll be no longer able to care for ourselves,

116
0:05:33.9,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to do the things that we want to do.

117
0:05:36.18,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Our bodies will betray us,

118
0:05:38.3,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and in that process, we'll lose control.

119
0:05:40.9,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And that's scary.

120
0:05:42.82,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Not just scary -- that's frightening,

121
0:05:44.98,000 --> 0:05:45,000
it's terrifying.

122
0:05:46.58,000 --> 0:05:48,000
When I talk to my patients, my palliative care patients,

123
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
many of whom are facing illnesses that will end their lives,

124
0:05:53.18,000 --> 0:05:55,000
they have a lot of be frightened of --

125
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation, fatigue,

126
0:05:58.9,000 --> 0:05:59,000
their impending mortality.

127
0:06:00.22,000 --> 0:06:02,000
But what scares them more than anything else

128
0:06:02.82,000 --> 0:06:04,000
is this possibility that at some point,

129
0:06:05.02,000 --> 0:06:07,000
tomorrow or a month from now,

130
0:06:07.22,000 --> 0:06:1,000
they're going to lose control of their health,

131
0:06:10.38,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of their lives,

132
0:06:12.02,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of their healthcare,

133
0:06:13.42,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and they're going to become dependent on others,

134
0:06:15.94,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and that's terrifying.

135
0:06:18.54,000 --> 0:06:21,000
So it's no wonder really that patients like Robin,

136
0:06:22.1,000 --> 0:06:24,000
who I just told you about,

137
0:06:24.14,000 --> 0:06:25,000
who I met in that clinic,

138
0:06:25.58,000 --> 0:06:26,000
turn to medical marijuana

139
0:06:27.14,000 --> 0:06:3,000
to try to claw back some semblance of control.

140
0:06:30.62,000 --> 0:06:31,000
How do they do it though?

141
0:06:31.9,000 --> 0:06:33,000
How do these medical marijuana dispensaries --

142
0:06:34.58,000 --> 0:06:35,000
like the one where I met Robin --

143
0:06:36.58,000 --> 0:06:42,000
how do they give patients like Robin back the sort of control that they need?

144
0:06:43.3,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And how do they do it

145
0:06:44.62,000 --> 0:06:48,000
in a way that mainstream medical hospitals and clinics,

146
0:06:48.7,000 --> 0:06:5,000
at least for Robin, weren't able to?

147
0:06:51.06,000 --> 0:06:52,000
What's their secret?

148
0:06:52.9,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So I decided to find out.

149
0:06:55.58,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I went to a seedy clinic in Venice Beach in California

150
0:06:59.74,000 --> 0:07:,000
and got a recommendation

151
0:07:01.06,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that would allow me to be a medical marijuana patient.

152
0:07:04.62,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I got a letter of recommendation that would let me buy medical marijuana.

153
0:07:08.66,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I got that recommendation illegally,

154
0:07:10.5,000 --> 0:07:12,000
because I'm not a resident of California --

155
0:07:12.58,000 --> 0:07:13,000
I should note that.

156
0:07:13.82,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I should also note, for the record,

157
0:07:15.58,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that I never used that letter of recommendation to make a purchase,

158
0:07:19.14,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and to all of you DEA agents out there --

159
0:07:21.86,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:23.1,000 --> 0:07:24,000
love the work that you're doing,

161
0:07:24.7,000 --> 0:07:25,000
keep it up.

162
0:07:25.94,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

163
0:07:26.98,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Even though it didn't let me make a purchase though,

164
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that letter was priceless because it let me be a patient.

165
0:07:34.14,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It let me experience what patients like Robin experience

166
0:07:38.38,000 --> 0:07:41,000
when they go to a medical marijuana dispensary.

167
0:07:41.42,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And what I experienced --

168
0:07:42.86,000 --> 0:07:44,000
what they experience every day,

169
0:07:45.1,000 --> 0:07:48,000
hundreds of thousands of people like Robin --

170
0:07:48.58,000 --> 0:07:5,000
was really amazing.

171
0:07:50.82,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I walked into the clinic,

172
0:07:52.1,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and from the moment that I entered many of these clinics and dispensaries,

173
0:07:55.78,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I felt like that dispensary, that clinic,

174
0:07:58.38,000 --> 0:07:59,000
was there for me.

175
0:08:00.7,000 --> 0:08:02,000
There were questions at the outset about who I am,

176
0:08:03.62,000 --> 0:08:04,000
what kind of work I do,

177
0:08:05.5,000 --> 0:08:09,000
what my goals are in looking for a medical marijuana prescription,

178
0:08:09.58,000 --> 0:08:11,000
or product,

179
0:08:12.42,000 --> 0:08:14,000
what my goals are, what my preferences are,

180
0:08:14.82,000 --> 0:08:15,000
what my hopes are,

181
0:08:16.1,000 --> 0:08:18,000
how do I think, how do I hope this might help me,

182
0:08:18.78,000 --> 0:08:19,000
what am I afraid of.

183
0:08:20.42,000 --> 0:08:21,000
These are the sorts of questions

184
0:08:22.02,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that patients like Robin get asked all the time.

185
0:08:24.5,000 --> 0:08:26,000
These are the sorts of questions that make me confident

186
0:08:27.46,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that the person I'm talking with really has my best interests at heart

187
0:08:31.14,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and wants to get to know me.

188
0:08:34.02,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The second thing I learned in those clinics

189
0:08:36.74,000 --> 0:08:38,000
is the availability of education.

190
0:08:38.94,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Education from the folks behind the counter,

191
0:08:41.78,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but also education from folks in the waiting room.

192
0:08:45.02,000 --> 0:08:48,000
People I met were more than happy, as I was sitting next to them --

193
0:08:48.58,000 --> 0:08:49,000
people like Robin --

194
0:08:49.859,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to tell me about who they are, why they use medical marijuana,

195
0:08:53.66,000 --> 0:08:55,000
what helps them, how it helps them,

196
0:08:55.9,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and to give me advice and suggestions.

197
0:08:57.86,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Those waiting rooms really are a hive of interaction, advice and support.

198
0:09:04.46,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And third, the folks behind the counter.

199
0:09:06.74,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I was amazed at how willing those people were

200
0:09:10.14,000 --> 0:09:14,000
to spend sometimes an hour or more talking me through the nuances

201
0:09:14.7,000 --> 0:09:16,000
of this strain versus that strain,

202
0:09:16.78,000 --> 0:09:17,000
smoking versus vaporizing,

203
0:09:18.5,000 --> 0:09:19,000
edibles versus tinctures --

204
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
all, remember, without me making any purchase whatsoever.

205
0:09:25.06,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Think about the last time you went to any hospital or clinic

206
0:09:28.9,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and the last time anybody spent an hour explaining those sorts of things to you.

207
0:09:34.5,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The fact that patients like Robin are going to these clinics,

208
0:09:38.14,000 --> 0:09:39,000
are going to these dispensaries

209
0:09:39.74,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and getting that sort of personalized attention

210
0:09:42.7,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and education and service,

211
0:09:44.58,000 --> 0:09:47,000
really should be a wake-up call to the healthcare system.

212
0:09:48.02,000 --> 0:09:5,000
People like Robin are turning away from mainstream medicine,

213
0:09:51.02,000 --> 0:09:53,000
turning to medical marijuana dispensaries

214
0:09:53.38,000 --> 0:09:56,000
because those dispensaries are giving them what they need.

215
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
If that's a wake-up call to the medical establishment,

216
0:10:00.86,000 --> 0:10:03,000
it's a wake-up call that many of my colleagues are either not hearing

217
0:10:04.66,000 --> 0:10:05,000
or not wanting to hear.

218
0:10:07.06,000 --> 0:10:09,000
When I talk to my colleagues, physicians in particular,

219
0:10:09.82,000 --> 0:10:1,000
about medical marijuana,

220
0:10:11.18,000 --> 0:10:13,000
they say, "Oh, we need more evidence.

221
0:10:13.86,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We need more research into benefits, we need more evidence about risks."

222
0:10:18.42,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And you know what? They're right.

223
0:10:20.3,000 --> 0:10:21,000
They're absolutely right.

224
0:10:21.58,000 --> 0:10:25,000
We do need much more evidence about the benefits of medical marijuana.

225
0:10:25.78,000 --> 0:10:3,000
We also need to ask the federal government to reschedule marijuana to Schedule II,

226
0:10:31.18,000 --> 0:10:34,000
or to deschedule it entirely to make that research possible.

227
0:10:35.58,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We also need more research into medical marijuana's risks.

228
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Medical marijuana's risks --

229
0:10:40.66,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we know a lot about the risks of recreational use,

230
0:10:43.06,000 --> 0:10:45,000
we know next to nothing about the risks of medical marijuana.

231
0:10:45.98,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So we absolutely do need research,

232
0:10:48.58,000 --> 0:10:5,000
but to say that we need research

233
0:10:50.94,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and not that we need to make any changes now

234
0:10:54.02,000 --> 0:10:55,000
is to miss the point entirely.

235
0:10:55.98,000 --> 0:10:57,000
People like Robin aren't seeking out medical marijuana

236
0:10:58.58,000 --> 0:10:59,000
because they think it's a wonder drug,

237
0:11:00.46,000 --> 0:11:02,000
or because they think it's entirely risk-free.

238
0:11:03.22,000 --> 0:11:07,000
They seek it out because the context in which it's delivered and administered

239
0:11:07.9,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and used,

240
0:11:09.14,000 --> 0:11:12,000
gives them the sort of control they need over their lives.

241
0:11:12.7,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And that's a wake-up call we really need to pay attention to.

242
0:11:16.86,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The good news though is that there are lessons we can learn today

243
0:11:20.62,000 --> 0:11:22,000
from those medical marijuana dispensaries.

244
0:11:23.62,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And those are lessons we really should learn.

245
0:11:25.78,000 --> 0:11:27,000
These are often small, mom-and-pop operations

246
0:11:28.54,000 --> 0:11:3,000
run by people with no medical training.

247
0:11:31.02,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And while it's embarrassing to think

248
0:11:33.62,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that many of these clinics and dispensaries are providing services

249
0:11:37.7,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and support and meeting patients' needs

250
0:11:40.1,000 --> 0:11:44,000
in ways that billion-dollar healthcare systems aren't --

251
0:11:44.14,000 --> 0:11:45,000
we should be embarrassed by that --

252
0:11:45.86,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but we can also learn from that.

253
0:11:47.78,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And there are probably three lessons at least

254
0:11:49.94,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that we can learn from those small dispensaries.

255
0:11:52.66,000 --> 0:11:55,000
One: we need to find ways to give patients more control

256
0:11:56.34,000 --> 0:11:58,000
in small but important ways.

257
0:11:58.38,000 --> 0:12:,000
How to interact with healthcare providers,

258
0:12:00.46,000 --> 0:12:02,000
when to interact with healthcare providers,

259
0:12:02.66,000 --> 0:12:05,000
how to use medications in ways that work for them.

260
0:12:06.3,000 --> 0:12:07,000
In my own practice,

261
0:12:07.54,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I've gotten much more creative and flexible

262
0:12:10.3,000 --> 0:12:13,000
in supporting my patients in using drugs safely

263
0:12:13.46,000 --> 0:12:14,000
to manage their symptoms --

264
0:12:14.98,000 --> 0:12:15,000
with the emphasis on safely.

265
0:12:16.38,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Many of the drugs I prescribe are drugs like opioids or benzodiazepines

266
0:12:20.86,000 --> 0:12:22,000
which can be dangerous if overused.

267
0:12:23.66,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But here's the point.

268
0:12:24.9,000 --> 0:12:26,000
They can be dangerous if they're overused,

269
0:12:26.98,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but they can also be ineffective if they're not used in a way

270
0:12:29.9,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that's consistent with what patients want and need.

271
0:12:32.58,000 --> 0:12:35,000
So that flexibility, if it's delivered safely,

272
0:12:35.82,000 --> 0:12:38,000
can be extraordinarily valuable for patients and their families.

273
0:12:38.94,000 --> 0:12:39,000
That's number one.

274
0:12:40.18,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Number two: education.

275
0:12:42.22,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Huge opportunities

276
0:12:43.46,000 --> 0:12:46,000
to learn from some of the tricks of those medical marijuana dispensaries

277
0:12:46.94,000 --> 0:12:47,000
to provide more education

278
0:12:48.34,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that doesn't require a lot of physician time necessarily,

279
0:12:51.1,000 --> 0:12:52,000
or any physician time,

280
0:12:52.86,000 --> 0:12:56,000
but opportunities to learn about what medications we're using

281
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and why,

282
0:12:58.5,000 --> 0:13:,000
prognoses, trajectories of illness,

283
0:13:00.58,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and most importantly,

284
0:13:01.82,000 --> 0:13:03,000
opportunities for patients to learn from each other.

285
0:13:04.58,000 --> 0:13:05,000
How can we replicate what goes on

286
0:13:06.54,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in those clinic and medical dispensary waiting rooms?

287
0:13:09.98,000 --> 0:13:12,000
How patients learn from each other, how people share with each other.

288
0:13:14.3,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And last but not least,

289
0:13:15.7,000 --> 0:13:19,000
putting patients first the way those medical marijuana dispensaries do,

290
0:13:19.78,000 --> 0:13:23,000
making patients feel legitimately like what they want,

291
0:13:24.62,000 --> 0:13:25,000
what they need,

292
0:13:25.9,000 --> 0:13:26,000
is why, as healthcare providers,

293
0:13:27.62,000 --> 0:13:28,000
we're here.

294
0:13:29.46,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Asking patients about their hopes, their fears, their goals and preferences.

295
0:13:33.7,000 --> 0:13:34,000
As a palliative care provider,

296
0:13:35.18,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I ask all my patients what they're hoping for and what they're afraid of.

297
0:13:39.38,000 --> 0:13:4,000
But here's the thing.

298
0:13:40.66,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Patients shouldn't have to wait until they're chronically seriously ill,

299
0:13:44.18,000 --> 0:13:45,000
often near the end of life,

300
0:13:46.02,000 --> 0:13:5,000
they shouldn't have to wait until they're seeing a physician like me

301
0:13:50.34,000 --> 0:13:51,000
before somebody asks them,

302
0:13:52.1,000 --> 0:13:53,000
"What are you hoping for?"

303
0:13:53.38,000 --> 0:13:54,000
"What are you afraid of?"

304
0:13:54.66,000 --> 0:13:57,000
That should be baked into the way that healthcare is delivered.

305
0:13:59.54,000 --> 0:14:,000
We can do this --

306
0:14:01.02,000 --> 0:14:02,000
we really can.

307
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Medical marijuana dispensaries and clinics all across the country

308
0:14:05.66,000 --> 0:14:06,000
are figuring this out.

309
0:14:07.46,000 --> 0:14:08,000
They're figuring this out

310
0:14:08.74,000 --> 0:14:13,000
in ways that larger, more mainstream health systems are years behind.

311
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
But we can learn from them,

312
0:14:15.66,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and we have to learn from them.

313
0:14:17.22,000 --> 0:14:19,000
All we have to do is swallow our pride --

314
0:14:19.58,000 --> 0:14:2,000
put aside the thought for a minute

315
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that because we have lots of letters after our name,

316
0:14:23.78,000 --> 0:14:24,000
because we're experts,

317
0:14:25.06,000 --> 0:14:28,000
because we're chief medical officers of a large healthcare system,

318
0:14:28.22,000 --> 0:14:32,000
we know all there is to know about how to meet patients' needs.

319
0:14:32.42,000 --> 0:14:33,000
We need to swallow our pride.

320
0:14:33.86,000 --> 0:14:36,000
We need to go visit a few medical marijuana dispensaries.

321
0:14:36.94,000 --> 0:14:37,000
We need to figure out what they're doing.

322
0:14:38.94,000 --> 0:14:4,000
We need to figure out why so many patients like Robin

323
0:14:41.54,000 --> 0:14:43,000
are leaving our mainstream medical clinics

324
0:14:43.74,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and going to these medical marijuana dispensaries instead.

325
0:14:47.14,000 --> 0:14:49,000
We need to figure out what their tricks are,

326
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
what their tools are,

327
0:14:50.54,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and we need to learn from them.

328
0:14:52.7,000 --> 0:14:53,000
If we do,

329
0:14:53.98,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and I think we can, and I absolutely think we have to,

330
0:14:56.94,000 --> 0:14:59,000
we can guarantee all of our patients will have a much better experience.

331
0:15:00.86,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Thank you.

332
0:15:02.1,000 --> 0:15:05,000

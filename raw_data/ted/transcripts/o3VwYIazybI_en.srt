1
0:00:12.556,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Our emotions influence every aspect of our lives,

2
0:00:16.573,000 --> 0:00:19,000
from our health and how we learn, to how we do business and make decisions,

3
0:00:20.149,000 --> 0:00:21,000
big ones and small.

4
0:00:22.672,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Our emotions also influence how we connect with one another.

5
0:00:27.132,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We've evolved to live in a world like this,

6
0:00:31.108,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but instead, we're living more and more of our lives like this --

7
0:00:35.427,000 --> 0:00:38,000
this is the text message from my daughter last night --

8
0:00:38.561,000 --> 0:00:4,000
in a world that's devoid of emotion.

9
0:00:41.301,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So I'm on a mission to change that.

10
0:00:43.252,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I want to bring emotions back into our digital experiences.

11
0:00:48.223,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I started on this path 15 years ago.

12
0:00:51.3,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I was a computer scientist in Egypt,

13
0:00:53.366,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and I had just gotten accepted to a Ph.D. program at Cambridge University.

14
0:00:57.871,000 --> 0:00:59,000
So I did something quite unusual

15
0:00:59.984,000 --> 0:01:03,000
for a young newlywed Muslim Egyptian wife:

16
0:01:05.599,000 --> 0:01:07,000
With the support of my husband, who had to stay in Egypt,

17
0:01:08.598,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I packed my bags and I moved to England.

18
0:01:11.616,000 --> 0:01:14,000
At Cambridge, thousands of miles away from home,

19
0:01:14.844,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I realized I was spending more hours with my laptop

20
0:01:18.257,000 --> 0:01:2,000
than I did with any other human.

21
0:01:20.486,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Yet despite this intimacy, my laptop had absolutely no idea how I was feeling.

22
0:01:25.339,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It had no idea if I was happy,

23
0:01:28.55,000 --> 0:01:3,000
having a bad day, or stressed, confused,

24
0:01:31.538,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and so that got frustrating.

25
0:01:35.6,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Even worse, as I communicated online with my family back home,

26
0:01:41.421,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I felt that all my emotions disappeared in cyberspace.

27
0:01:44.703,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I was homesick, I was lonely, and on some days I was actually crying,

28
0:01:49.858,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but all I had to communicate these emotions was this.

29
0:01:54.786,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:56.806,000 --> 0:02:,000
Today's technology has lots of I.Q., but no E.Q.;

31
0:02:01.78,000 --> 0:02:04,000
lots of cognitive intelligence, but no emotional intelligence.

32
0:02:04.956,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So that got me thinking,

33
0:02:07.153,000 --> 0:02:1,000
what if our technology could sense our emotions?

34
0:02:10.777,000 --> 0:02:14,000
What if our devices could sense how we felt and reacted accordingly,

35
0:02:14.853,000 --> 0:02:17,000
just the way an emotionally intelligent friend would?

36
0:02:18.666,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Those questions led me and my team

37
0:02:22.23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
to create technologies that can read and respond to our emotions,

38
0:02:26.607,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and our starting point was the human face.

39
0:02:30.577,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So our human face happens to be one of the most powerful channels

40
0:02:33.75,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that we all use to communicate social and emotional states,

41
0:02:37.766,000 --> 0:02:4,000
everything from enjoyment, surprise,

42
0:02:40.776,000 --> 0:02:44,000
empathy and curiosity.

43
0:02:44.979,000 --> 0:02:48,000
In emotion science, we call each facial muscle movement an action unit.

44
0:02:49.907,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So for example, action unit 12,

45
0:02:52.832,000 --> 0:02:54,000
it's not a Hollywood blockbuster,

46
0:02:54.87,000 --> 0:02:57,000
it is actually a lip corner pull, which is the main component of a smile.

47
0:02:58.312,000 --> 0:03:,000
Try it everybody. Let's get some smiles going on.

48
0:03:01.3,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Another example is action unit 4. It's the brow furrow.

49
0:03:03.954,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's when you draw your eyebrows together

50
0:03:06.192,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and you create all these textures and wrinkles.

51
0:03:08.459,000 --> 0:03:12,000
We don't like them, but it's a strong indicator of a negative emotion.

52
0:03:12.754,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So we have about 45 of these action units,

53
0:03:14.96,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and they combine to express hundreds of emotions.

54
0:03:18.35,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Teaching a computer to read these facial emotions is hard,

55
0:03:22.251,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because these action units, they can be fast, they're subtle,

56
0:03:25.223,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and they combine in many different ways.

57
0:03:27.777,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So take, for example, the smile and the smirk.

58
0:03:31.515,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They look somewhat similar, but they mean very different things.

59
0:03:35.268,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:36.986,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So the smile is positive,

61
0:03:39.99,000 --> 0:03:4,000
a smirk is often negative.

62
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Sometimes a smirk can make you become famous.

63
0:03:45.136,000 --> 0:03:47,000
But seriously, it's important for a computer to be able

64
0:03:47.96,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to tell the difference between the two expressions.

65
0:03:50.815,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So how do we do that?

66
0:03:52.627,000 --> 0:03:53,000
We give our algorithms

67
0:03:54.414,000 --> 0:03:58,000
tens of thousands of examples of people we know to be smiling,

68
0:03:58.524,000 --> 0:04:01,000
from different ethnicities, ages, genders,

69
0:04:01.589,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and we do the same for smirks.

70
0:04:04.4,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And then, using deep learning,

71
0:04:05.954,000 --> 0:04:07,000
the algorithm looks for all these textures and wrinkles

72
0:04:08.81,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and shape changes on our face,

73
0:04:11.39,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and basically learns that all smiles have common characteristics,

74
0:04:14.592,000 --> 0:04:17,000
all smirks have subtly different characteristics.

75
0:04:17.773,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And the next time it sees a new face,

76
0:04:20.141,000 --> 0:04:22,000
it essentially learns that

77
0:04:22.44,000 --> 0:04:25,000
this face has the same characteristics of a smile,

78
0:04:25.473,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and it says, "Aha, I recognize this. This is a smile expression."

79
0:04:30.381,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So the best way to demonstrate how this technology works

80
0:04:33.181,000 --> 0:04:35,000
is to try a live demo,

81
0:04:35.317,000 --> 0:04:38,000
so I need a volunteer, preferably somebody with a face.

82
0:04:39.23,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:41.564,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Cloe's going to be our volunteer today.

84
0:04:45.325,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So over the past five years, we've moved from being a research project at MIT

85
0:04:49.783,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to a company,

86
0:04:50.939,000 --> 0:04:53,000
where my team has worked really hard to make this technology work,

87
0:04:54.131,000 --> 0:04:56,000
as we like to say, in the wild.

88
0:04:56.54,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And we've also shrunk it so that the core emotion engine

89
0:04:59.21,000 --> 0:05:02,000
works on any mobile device with a camera, like this iPad.

90
0:05:02.53,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So let's give this a try.

91
0:05:06.756,000 --> 0:05:09,000
As you can see, the algorithm has essentially found Cloe's face,

92
0:05:10.68,000 --> 0:05:11,000
so it's this white bounding box,

93
0:05:12.372,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and it's tracking the main feature points on her face,

94
0:05:14.943,000 --> 0:05:16,000
so her eyebrows, her eyes, her mouth and her nose.

95
0:05:17.799,000 --> 0:05:19,000
The question is, can it recognize her expression?

96
0:05:20.786,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So we're going to test the machine.

97
0:05:22.457,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So first of all, give me your poker face. Yep, awesome. (Laughter)

98
0:05:26.643,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And then as she smiles, this is a genuine smile, it's great.

99
0:05:29.456,000 --> 0:05:31,000
So you can see the green bar go up as she smiles.

100
0:05:31.756,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now that was a big smile.

101
0:05:32.978,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Can you try a subtle smile to see if the computer can recognize?

102
0:05:36.021,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It does recognize subtle smiles as well.

103
0:05:38.352,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We've worked really hard to make that happen.

104
0:05:40.477,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And then eyebrow raised, indicator of surprise.

105
0:05:43.439,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Brow furrow, which is an indicator of confusion.

106
0:05:47.688,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Frown. Yes, perfect.

107
0:05:51.695,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So these are all the different action units. There's many more of them.

108
0:05:55.188,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This is just a slimmed-down demo.

109
0:05:57.22,000 --> 0:06:,000
But we call each reading an emotion data point,

110
0:06:00.368,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and then they can fire together to portray different emotions.

111
0:06:03.337,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So on the right side of the demo -- look like you're happy.

112
0:06:07.99,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So that's joy. Joy fires up.

113
0:06:09.444,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And then give me a disgust face.

114
0:06:11.371,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Try to remember what it was like when Zayn left One Direction.

115
0:06:15.643,000 --> 0:06:16,000
(Laughter)

116
0:06:17.153,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Yeah, wrinkle your nose. Awesome.

117
0:06:21.495,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And the valence is actually quite negative, so you must have been a big fan.

118
0:06:25.226,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So valence is how positive or negative an experience is,

119
0:06:27.926,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and engagement is how expressive she is as well.

120
0:06:30.712,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So imagine if Cloe had access to this real-time emotion stream,

121
0:06:34.126,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and she could share it with anybody she wanted to.

122
0:06:36.935,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Thank you.

123
0:06:39.858,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Applause)

124
0:06:45.749,000 --> 0:06:5,000
So, so far, we have amassed 12 billion of these emotion data points.

125
0:06:51.019,000 --> 0:06:53,000
It's the largest emotion database in the world.

126
0:06:53.63,000 --> 0:06:55,000
We've collected it from 2.9 million face videos,

127
0:06:56.593,000 --> 0:06:58,000
people who have agreed to share their emotions with us,

128
0:06:59.193,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and from 75 countries around the world.

129
0:07:02.398,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It's growing every day.

130
0:07:04.603,000 --> 0:07:06,000
It blows my mind away

131
0:07:06.67,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that we can now quantify something as personal as our emotions,

132
0:07:09.865,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and we can do it at this scale.

133
0:07:12.1,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So what have we learned to date?

134
0:07:15.057,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Gender.

135
0:07:17.388,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Our data confirms something that you might suspect.

136
0:07:21.034,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Women are more expressive than men.

137
0:07:22.891,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Not only do they smile more, their smiles last longer,

138
0:07:25.574,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and we can now really quantify what it is that men and women

139
0:07:28.478,000 --> 0:07:3,000
respond to differently.

140
0:07:30.614,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Let's do culture: So in the United States,

141
0:07:32.904,000 --> 0:07:35,000
women are 40 percent more expressive than men,

142
0:07:36.108,000 --> 0:07:39,000
but curiously, we don't see any difference in the U.K. between men and women.

143
0:07:39.753,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

144
0:07:43.296,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Age: People who are 50 years and older

145
0:07:47.323,000 --> 0:07:5,000
are 25 percent more emotive than younger people.

146
0:07:51.899,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Women in their 20s smile a lot more than men the same age,

147
0:07:55.751,000 --> 0:07:58,000
perhaps a necessity for dating.

148
0:07:59.59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But perhaps what surprised us the most about this data

149
0:08:02.207,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is that we happen to be expressive all the time,

150
0:08:05.41,000 --> 0:08:07,000
even when we are sitting in front of our devices alone,

151
0:08:08.243,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and it's not just when we're watching cat videos on Facebook.

152
0:08:12.217,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We are expressive when we're emailing, texting, shopping online,

153
0:08:15.227,000 --> 0:08:17,000
or even doing our taxes.

154
0:08:17.527,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Where is this data used today?

155
0:08:19.919,000 --> 0:08:21,000
In understanding how we engage with media,

156
0:08:22.682,000 --> 0:08:24,000
so understanding virality and voting behavior;

157
0:08:25.166,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and also empowering or emotion-enabling technology,

158
0:08:27.906,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and I want to share some examples that are especially close to my heart.

159
0:08:33.197,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Emotion-enabled wearable glasses can help individuals

160
0:08:36.265,000 --> 0:08:39,000
who are visually impaired read the faces of others,

161
0:08:39.493,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and it can help individuals on the autism spectrum interpret emotion,

162
0:08:43.68,000 --> 0:08:45,000
something that they really struggle with.

163
0:08:47.918,000 --> 0:08:49,000
In education, imagine if your learning apps

164
0:08:50.777,000 --> 0:08:52,000
sense that you're confused and slow down,

165
0:08:53.587,000 --> 0:08:54,000
or that you're bored, so it's sped up,

166
0:08:55.444,000 --> 0:08:57,000
just like a great teacher would in a classroom.

167
0:08:59.043,000 --> 0:09:01,000
What if your wristwatch tracked your mood,

168
0:09:01.644,000 --> 0:09:03,000
or your car sensed that you're tired,

169
0:09:04.337,000 --> 0:09:06,000
or perhaps your fridge knows that you're stressed,

170
0:09:06.885,000 --> 0:09:12,000
so it auto-locks to prevent you from binge eating. (Laughter)

171
0:09:12.951,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I would like that, yeah.

172
0:09:15.668,000 --> 0:09:16,000
What if, when I was in Cambridge,

173
0:09:17.595,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I had access to my real-time emotion stream,

174
0:09:19.908,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and I could share that with my family back home in a very natural way,

175
0:09:23.437,000 --> 0:09:26,000
just like I would've if we were all in the same room together?

176
0:09:27.408,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I think five years down the line,

177
0:09:30.55,000 --> 0:09:32,000
all our devices are going to have an emotion chip,

178
0:09:32.887,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and we won't remember what it was like when we couldn't just frown at our device

179
0:09:36.951,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and our device would say, "Hmm, you didn't like that, did you?"

180
0:09:41.2,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Our biggest challenge is that there are so many applications of this technology,

181
0:09:44.961,000 --> 0:09:46,000
my team and I realize that we can't build them all ourselves,

182
0:09:47.864,000 --> 0:09:5,000
so we've made this technology available so that other developers

183
0:09:51.36,000 --> 0:09:53,000
can get building and get creative.

184
0:09:53.474,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We recognize that there are potential risks

185
0:09:57.56,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and potential for abuse,

186
0:09:59.627,000 --> 0:10:01,000
but personally, having spent many years doing this,

187
0:10:02.576,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I believe that the benefits to humanity

188
0:10:05.548,000 --> 0:10:07,000
from having emotionally intelligent technology

189
0:10:07.823,000 --> 0:10:1,000
far outweigh the potential for misuse.

190
0:10:11.399,000 --> 0:10:13,000
And I invite you all to be part of the conversation.

191
0:10:13.93,000 --> 0:10:15,000
The more people who know about this technology,

192
0:10:16.484,000 --> 0:10:19,000
the more we can all have a voice in how it's being used.

193
0:10:21.081,000 --> 0:10:25,000
So as more and more of our lives become digital,

194
0:10:25.655,000 --> 0:10:28,000
we are fighting a losing battle trying to curb our usage of devices

195
0:10:29.153,000 --> 0:10:31,000
in order to reclaim our emotions.

196
0:10:32.622,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So what I'm trying to do instead is to bring emotions into our technology

197
0:10:36.536,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and make our technologies more responsive.

198
0:10:38.765,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So I want those devices that have separated us

199
0:10:41.435,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to bring us back together.

200
0:10:43.897,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And by humanizing technology, we have this golden opportunity

201
0:10:48.485,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to reimagine how we connect with machines,

202
0:10:51.782,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and therefore, how we, as human beings,

203
0:10:56.263,000 --> 0:10:57,000
connect with one another.

204
0:10:58.167,000 --> 0:11:,000
Thank you.

205
0:11:00.327,000 --> 0:11:03,000
(Applause)

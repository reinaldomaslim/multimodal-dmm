1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Take a look at this picture.

2
0:00:21.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It poses a very fascinating puzzle for us.

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
These African students are doing their homework

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
under streetlights at the airport in the capital city

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
because they don't have any electricity at home.

6
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Now, I haven't met these particular students,

7
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but I've met students like them.

8
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Let's just pick one -- for example, the one in the green shirt.

9
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Let's give him a name, too: Nelson.

10
0:00:45.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I'll bet Nelson has a cellphone.

11
0:00:48.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So here is the puzzle.

12
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Why is it that Nelson has access

13
0:00:52.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
to a cutting-edge technology, like the cellphone,

14
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
but doesn't have access to a 100-year-old technology

15
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:02,000
for generating electric light in the home?

16
0:01:02.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, in a word, the answer is "rules."

17
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that's available

18
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
when people can bring new technologies in

19
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and make them available to someone like Nelson.

20
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
What kinds of rules?

21
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
The electric company in this nation

22
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
operates under a rule, which says that it has to sell

23
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
electricity at a very low, subsidized price --

24
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in fact, a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells.

25
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So it has neither the resources, nor the incentives,

26
0:01:34.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to hook up many other users.

27
0:01:36.33,000 --> 0:01:39,000
The president wanted to change this rule.

28
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
He's seen that it's possible to have a different set of rules,

29
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
rules where businesses earn a small profit,

30
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
so they have an incentive to sign up more customers.

31
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
That's the kind of rules that the cellphone company

32
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that Nelson purchases his telephony from operates under.

33
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The president has seen how those rules worked well.

34
0:01:58.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity,

35
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but ran into a firestorm of protest

36
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
from businesses and consumers

37
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:09,000
who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates.

38
0:02:09.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So he was stuck with rules that prevented him

39
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
from letting the win-win solution help his country.

40
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And Nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights.

41
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
The real challenge then, is to try to figure out

42
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
how we can change rules.

43
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Are there some rules we can develop for changing rules?

44
0:02:32.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I want to argue that there is a general abstract insight

45
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that we can make practical,

46
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which is that, if we can give more choices to people,

47
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and more choices to leaders --

48
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:48,000
who, in many countries, are also people.

49
0:02:48.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

50
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But, it's useful to present the opposition between these two.

51
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader,

52
0:02:58.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
a choice like giving the president the choice

53
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to raise prices on electricity,

54
0:03:03.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
takes away a choice that people in the economy want.

55
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They want the choice to be able to continue consuming

56
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
subsidized electric power.

57
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So if you give just to one side or the other,

58
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
you'll have tension or friction.

59
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
But if we can find ways to give more choices to both,

60
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that will give us a set of rules

61
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
for changing rules that get us out of traps.

62
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Now, Nelson also has access to the Internet.

63
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And he says that if you want to see

64
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:33,000
the damaging effects of rules,

65
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
the ways that rules can keep people in the dark,

66
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
look at the pictures from NASA of the earth at night.

67
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
In particular check out Asia.

68
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
If you zoom in here,

69
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
you can see North Korea, in outline here,

70
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:49,000
which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors.

71
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Now, you won't be surprised to learn

72
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that the rules in North Korea

73
0:03:53.33,000 --> 0:03:55,000
keep people there in the dark.

74
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
But it is important to recognize

75
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
that North Korea and South Korea

76
0:03:59.33,000 --> 0:04:02,000
started out with identical sets of rules

77
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in both the sense of laws and regulations,

78
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
but also in the deeper senses of understandings,

79
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
norms, culture, values and beliefs.

80
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:14,000
When they separated, they made choices

81
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that led to very divergent paths

82
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
for their sets of rules.

83
0:04:18.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So we can change -- we as humans can change the rules

84
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that we use to interact with each other,

85
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:27,000
for better, or for worse.

86
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now let's look at another region, the Caribbean.

87
0:04:30.33,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Zoom in on Haiti,

88
0:04:32.33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in outline here.

89
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Haiti is also dark,

90
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
compared to its neighbor here, the Dominican Republic,

91
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:42,000
which has about the same number of residents.

92
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Both of these countries are dark compared to Puerto Rico,

93
0:04:45.33,000 --> 0:04:47,000
which has half as many residents

94
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
as either Haiti or the Dominican Republic.

95
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
What Haiti warns us is that

96
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
rules can be bad because governments are weak.

97
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It's not just that the rules are bad because

98
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
the government is too strong and oppressive, as in North Korea.

99
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So that if we want to create environments with good rules,

100
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:06,000
we can't just tear down.

101
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We've got to find ways to build up, as well.

102
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Now, China dramatically demonstrates

103
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
both the potential and the challenges

104
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
of working with rules.

105
0:05:18.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart,

106
0:05:21.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
China was the world's high-technology leader.

107
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Chinese had pioneered technologies like steel, printing, gunpowder.

108
0:05:29.33,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But the Chinese never adopted, at least in that period,

109
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas --

110
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread.

111
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And they soon adopted rules which

112
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
slowed down innovation

113
0:05:43.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and cut China off from the rest of the world.

114
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So as other countries in the world innovated,

115
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
in the sense both of developing

116
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
newer technologies,

117
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
but also developing newer rules,

118
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the Chinese were cut off from those advances.

119
0:05:58.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
Income there stayed stagnant,

120
0:06:00.33,000 --> 0:06:03,000
as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world.

121
0:06:03.33,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This next chart looks at more recent data.

122
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
It plots income, average income in China

123
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
as a percentage of average income in the United States.

124
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
In the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent.

125
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But then in the late '70s something changed.

126
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Growth took off in China. The Chinese started catching up

127
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:23,000
very quickly with the United States.

128
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
If you go back to the map at night, you can get a clue

129
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in China.

130
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The brightest spot in China,

131
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
which you can see on the edge of the outline here,

132
0:06:35.33,000 --> 0:06:37,000
is Hong Kong.

133
0:06:37.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Hong Kong was a small bit of China

134
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that, for most of the 20th century,

135
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
operated under a very different set of rules

136
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
than the rest of mainland China --

137
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
rules that were copied

138
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
from working market economies of the time,

139
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and administered by the British.

140
0:06:53.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
In the 1950s, Hong Kong was a place where

141
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
millions of people could go, from the mainland,

142
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to start in jobs like sewing shirts, making toys.

143
0:07:03.33,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But, to get on a process of increasing income,

144
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
increasing skills

145
0:07:08.33,000 --> 0:07:11,000
led to very rapid growth there.

146
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Hong Kong was also the model

147
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:16,000
which leaders like Deng Xiaoping

148
0:07:16.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
could copy, when they decided to move

149
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
all of the mainland towards the market model.

150
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But Deng Xiaoping instinctively understood

151
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
the importance of offering choices to his people.

152
0:07:28.33,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So instead of forcing everyone in China

153
0:07:31.33,000 --> 0:07:33,000
to shift immediately to the market model,

154
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
they proceeded by creating some special zones

155
0:07:36.33,000 --> 0:07:38,000
that could do, in a sense, what Britain did:

156
0:07:38.33,000 --> 0:07:4,000
make the opportunity to go work with the market rules

157
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
available to the people who wanted to opt in there.

158
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So they created four special economic zones around Hong Kong:

159
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
zones where Chinese could come and work,

160
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and cities grew up very rapidly there;

161
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:54,000
also zones where foreign firms could come in

162
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and make things.

163
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:59,000
One of the zones next to Hong Kong has a city called Shenzhen.

164
0:07:59.33,000 --> 0:08:02,000
In that city there is a Taiwanese firm

165
0:08:02.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that made the iPhone that many of you have,

166
0:08:05.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and they made it with labor from Chinese

167
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
who moved there to Shenzhen.

168
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So after the four special zones,

169
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
there were 14 coastal cites

170
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that were open in the same sense,

171
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and eventually demonstrated successes

172
0:08:19.33,000 --> 0:08:21,000
in these places that people could opt in to,

173
0:08:21.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered.

174
0:08:24.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for

175
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
a move toward the market model for the entire economy.

176
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now the Chinese example shows us several points.

177
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
One is: preserve choices for people.

178
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Two: operate on the right scale.

179
0:08:42.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
If you try to change the rules in a village, you could do that,

180
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but a village would be too small

181
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people

182
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
all working under good rules.

183
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
On the other hand, the nation is too big.

184
0:08:54.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
If you try to change the rules in the nation,

185
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
you can't give some people a chance

186
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
to hold back, see how things turn out,

187
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules.

188
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But cities give you this opportunity

189
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
to create new places,

190
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
with new rules that people can opt in to.

191
0:09:09.33,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And they're large enough

192
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to get all of the benefits that we can have

193
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
when millions of us work together under good rules.

194
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
So the proposal is that we

195
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
conceive of something called a charter city.

196
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
We start with a charter that specifies

197
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
all the rules required

198
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to attract the people who we'll need to build the city.

199
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
We'll need to attract the investors

200
0:09:33.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
who will build out the infrastructure --

201
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the power system, the roads, the port, the airport, the buildings.

202
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
You'll need to attract firms,

203
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
who will come hire the people who move there first.

204
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And you'll need to attract families,

205
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the residents who will come and live there permanently,

206
0:09:47.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
raise their children, get an education for their children,

207
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and get their first job.

208
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:54,000
With that charter, people will move there.

209
0:09:54.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The city can be built.

210
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And we can scale this model.

211
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We can go do it over and over again.

212
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
To make it work, we need good rules. We've already discussed that.

213
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Those are captured in the charter.

214
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:1,000
We also need the choices for people.

215
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
That's really built into the model

216
0:10:12.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
if we allow for the possibility of building cities

217
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:17,000
on uninhabited land.

218
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
You start from uninhabited territory.

219
0:10:19.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
People can come live under the new charter,

220
0:10:21.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but no one is forced to live under it.

221
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
The final thing we need are choices for leaders.

222
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And, to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders

223
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations:

224
0:10:33.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
cases where nations work together,

225
0:10:35.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
in effect, de facto,

226
0:10:37.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
the way China and Britain worked together

227
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
to build, first a little enclave of the market model,

228
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and then scale it throughout China.

229
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:47,000
In a sense, Britain, inadvertently,

230
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:49,000
through its actions in Hong Kong,

231
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:52,000
did more to reduce world poverty

232
0:10:52.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
than all the aid programs that we've undertaken

233
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
in the last century.

234
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
So if we allow for these kind of partnerships

235
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:,000
to replicate this again,

236
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world.

237
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:08,000
In some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility,

238
0:11:08.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
a delegation of control from one country to another

239
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities.

240
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Now, when I say that,

241
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:21,000
some of you are starting to think,

242
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
"Well, is this just bringing back colonialism?"

243
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It's not. But it's important to recognize that the kind of emotions

244
0:11:30.33,000 --> 0:11:32,000
that come up when we start to think about these things,

245
0:11:32.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
can get in the way, can make us pull back,

246
0:11:35.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
can shut down our ability,

247
0:11:37.33,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and our interest in trying to explore new ideas.

248
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Why is this not like colonialism?

249
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The thing that was bad about colonialism,

250
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs,

251
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
is that it involved elements of

252
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
coercion and condescension.

253
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
This model is all about choices,

254
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places.

255
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And, choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension.

256
0:12:04.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So let's talk about how this could play out in practice.

257
0:12:07.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Let's take a particular leader, Raul Castro, who is the leader of Cuba.

258
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It must have occurred to Castro

259
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that he has the chance to do for Cuba

260
0:12:15.33,000 --> 0:12:17,000
what Deng Xiaoping did for China,

261
0:12:17.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
but he doesn't have a Hong Kong there on the island in Cuba.

262
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
He does, though, have a little bit of light down in the south

263
0:12:25.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that has a very special status.

264
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
There is a zone there, around Guantanamo Bay,

265
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
where a treaty gives the United States

266
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
administrative responsibility

267
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
for a piece of land that's about twice the size of Manhattan.

268
0:12:38.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Castro goes to the prime minister of Canada

269
0:12:41.33,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and says, "Look, the Yankees have a terrible PR problem.

270
0:12:45.33,000 --> 0:12:47,000
They want to get out.

271
0:12:47.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Why don't you, Canada, take over?

272
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Build -- run a special administrative zone.

273
0:12:53.33,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Allow a new city to be built up there.

274
0:12:55.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Allow many people to come in.

275
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
Let us have a Hong Kong nearby.

276
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Some of my citizens will move into that city as well.

277
0:13:02.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Others will hold back. But this will be

278
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
the gateway that will connect

279
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:08,000
the modern economy and the modern world

280
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to my country."

281
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Now, where else might this model be tried?

282
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Well, Africa. I've talked with leaders in Africa.

283
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Many of them totally get the notion of a special zone

284
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that people can opt into as a rule.

285
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
It's a rule for changing rules.

286
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
It's a way to create new rules, and let people opt-in

287
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
without coercion, and the opposition that coercion can force.

288
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
They also totally get the idea that in some instances

289
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:38,000
they can make more credible promises to long-term investors --

290
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
the kind of investors who will come build the port,

291
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
build the roads, in a new city --

292
0:13:43.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
they can make more credible promises

293
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
if they do it along with a partner nation.

294
0:13:47.33,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Perhaps even in some arrangement

295
0:13:49.33,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that's a little bit like an escrow account,

296
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
where you put land in the escrow account

297
0:13:53.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and the partner nation takes responsibility for it.

298
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
There is also lots of land in Africa

299
0:13:59.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
where new cities could be built.

300
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
This is a picture I took when I was flying along the coast.

301
0:14:04.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
There are immense stretches of land like this --

302
0:14:06.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
land where hundreds of millions of people could live.

303
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Now, if we generalize this and think about

304
0:14:11.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
not just one or two charter cites, but dozens --

305
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:18,000
cities that will help create places for the

306
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
many hundreds of millions, perhaps billions of people

307
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:23,000
who will move to cities in the coming century --

308
0:14:23.33,000 --> 0:14:25,000
is there enough land for them?

309
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Well, throughout the world, if we look at the lights at night,

310
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:3,000
the one thing that's misleading is that, visually, it looks

311
0:14:30.33,000 --> 0:14:32,000
like most of the world is already built out.

312
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
So let me show you why that's wrong.

313
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Take this representation of all of the land.

314
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Turn it into a square that stands for

315
0:14:39.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
all the arable land on Earth.

316
0:14:41.33,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And let these dots represent the land that's already taken up

317
0:14:43.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
by the cities that three billion people now live in.

318
0:14:46.33,000 --> 0:14:49,000
If you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle

319
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents

320
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
take up only three percent of the arable land on earth.

321
0:14:57.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
So if we wanted to build cities for another billion people,

322
0:15:00.33,000 --> 0:15:02,000
they would be dots like this.

323
0:15:02.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
We'd go from three percent of the arable land, to four percent.

324
0:15:05.33,000 --> 0:15:09,000
We'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on Earth

325
0:15:09.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
by building more cities that people can move to.

326
0:15:11.33,000 --> 0:15:14,000
And if these are cities governed by good rules,

327
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:17,000
they can be cities where people are safe from crime,

328
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:2,000
safe from disease and bad sanitation,

329
0:15:20.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
where people have a chance to get a job.

330
0:15:22.33,000 --> 0:15:24,000
They can get basic utilities like electricity.

331
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Their kids can get an education.

332
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
So what will it take to get started

333
0:15:29.33,000 --> 0:15:31,000
building the first charter cities,

334
0:15:31.33,000 --> 0:15:33,000
scaling this so we build many more?

335
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:35,000
It would help to have a manual.

336
0:15:35.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Laughter)

337
0:15:39.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
What university professors could do

338
0:15:41.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
is write some details that might go into this manual.

339
0:15:45.33,000 --> 0:15:48,000
You wouldn't want to let us run the cities,

340
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:5,000
go out and design them.

341
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
You wouldn't let academics out in the wild. (Laughter)

342
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
But, you could set us to work thinking about questions like,

343
0:15:56.33,000 --> 0:15:58,000
suppose it isn't just Canada

344
0:15:58.33,000 --> 0:16:01,000
that does the deal with Raul Castro.

345
0:16:01.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Perhaps Brazil comes in as a participant,

346
0:16:04.33,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and Spain as well. And perhaps Cuba wants to be

347
0:16:06.33,000 --> 0:16:09,000
one of the partners in a four-way joint venture.

348
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
How would we write the treaty to do that?

349
0:16:11.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
There is less precedent for that, but that could easily be worked out.

350
0:16:14.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
How would we finance this?

351
0:16:16.33,000 --> 0:16:18,000
Turns out Singapore and Hong Kong

352
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:2,000
are cities that made huge gains

353
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
on the value of the land that they owned when they got started.

354
0:16:23.33,000 --> 0:16:25,000
You could use the gains on the value of the land

355
0:16:25.33,000 --> 0:16:28,000
to pay for things like the police, the courts,

356
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but the school system and the health care system too,

357
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:33,000
which make this a more attractive place to live,

358
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:35,000
makes this a place where people have higher incomes --

359
0:16:35.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
which, incidentally, makes the land more valuable.

360
0:16:38.33,000 --> 0:16:41,000
So the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone

361
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
and build it, and set up the basic rules,

362
0:16:44.33,000 --> 0:16:46,000
go very much in the right direction.

363
0:16:46.33,000 --> 0:16:48,000
So there are many other details like this.

364
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
How could we have buildings that are

365
0:16:50.33,000 --> 0:16:52,000
low cost and affordable for people who work

366
0:16:52.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
in a first job, assembling something like an iPhone,

367
0:16:55.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
but make those buildings energy efficient,

368
0:16:57.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
and make sure that they are safe, so they don't fall down

369
0:16:59.33,000 --> 0:17:02,000
in an earthquake or a hurricane.

370
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:04,000
Many technical details to be worked out,

371
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:08,000
but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things

372
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:1,000
can already tell that there is no roadblock,

373
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
there's no impediment, other than a failure of imagination,

374
0:17:13.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
that will keep us from delivering on

375
0:17:15.33,000 --> 0:17:2,000
a truly global win-win solution.

376
0:17:20.33,000 --> 0:17:23,000
Let me conclude with this picture.

377
0:17:23.33,000 --> 0:17:25,000
The reason we can be so well off,

378
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:27,000
even though there is so many people on earth,

379
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:3,000
is because of the power of ideas.

380
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
We can share ideas with other people,

381
0:17:32.33,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and when they discover them, they share with us.

382
0:17:34.33,000 --> 0:17:36,000
It's not like scarce objects,

383
0:17:36.33,000 --> 0:17:38,000
where sharing means we each get less.

384
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:41,000
When we share ideas we all get more.

385
0:17:41.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
When we think about ideas in that way,

386
0:17:43.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
we usually think about technologies.

387
0:17:45.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
But there is another class of ideas:

388
0:17:47.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
the rules that govern how we interact with each other;

389
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:52,000
rules like, let's have a tax system

390
0:17:52.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
that supports a research university

391
0:17:54.33,000 --> 0:17:57,000
that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free.

392
0:17:57.33,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Let's have a system where we have ownership of land

393
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
that is registered in a government office,

394
0:18:01.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
that people can pledge as collateral.

395
0:18:03.33,000 --> 0:18:05,000
If we can keep innovating on our space of rules,

396
0:18:05.33,000 --> 0:18:07,000
and particularly innovate in the sense

397
0:18:07.33,000 --> 0:18:09,000
of coming up with rules for changing rules,

398
0:18:09.33,000 --> 0:18:12,000
so we don't get stuck with bad rules,

399
0:18:12.33,000 --> 0:18:15,000
then we can keep moving progress forward

400
0:18:15.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
and truly make the world a better place,

401
0:18:17.33,000 --> 0:18:2,000
so that people like Nelson and his friends

402
0:18:20.33,000 --> 0:18:23,000
don't have to study any longer under the streetlights. Thank you.

403
0:18:23.33,000 --> 0:18:25,000
(Applause)

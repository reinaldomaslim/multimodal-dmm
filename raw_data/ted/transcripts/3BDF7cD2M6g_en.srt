1
0:00:12.41,000 --> 0:00:18,000
so in the run-up to the 2016 election I

2
0:00:15.99,000 --> 0:00:2,000
was like most of us watching the rise in

3
0:00:18.99,000 --> 0:00:24,000
discord and vitriol and nastiness and

4
0:00:21.449,000 --> 0:00:25,000
our public spaces it was as crazy uptick

5
0:00:25.019,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in polarization

6
0:00:25.92,000 --> 0:00:3,000
it was both disheartening and

7
0:00:28.47,000 --> 0:00:32,000
distressing and so I started thinking

8
0:00:31.14,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with a fellow journalist Jeremy hey

9
0:00:33.059,000 --> 0:00:38,000
about how we might practice our craft

10
0:00:35.34,000 --> 0:00:39,000
differently how we might go to the heart

11
0:00:38.46,000 --> 0:00:42,000
of divides the places of conflict like

12
0:00:40.23,000 --> 0:00:46,000
journalists always have but then once

13
0:00:42.69,000 --> 0:00:47,000
there do something really different we

14
0:00:46.5,000 --> 0:00:5,000
knew we wanted to take the core tools of

15
0:00:48.57,000 --> 0:00:53,000
our craft careful vetting of information

16
0:00:50.61,000 --> 0:00:55,000
diligent research curiosity a commitment

17
0:00:53.579,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to serving the public good to serving

18
0:00:55.89,000 --> 0:01:,000
our democracy and do something new and

19
0:00:58.219,000 --> 0:01:02,000
so we mapped out this process what we

20
0:01:01.109,000 --> 0:01:04,000
call dialogue journalism for going to

21
0:01:03.149,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the heart of social and political

22
0:01:04.739,000 --> 0:01:08,000
divides and then once they are building

23
0:01:07.2,000 --> 0:01:1,000
journalism supported conversations

24
0:01:09.15,000 --> 0:01:15,000
between people on opposite side of

25
0:01:10.979,000 --> 0:01:16,000
opposite sides of polarizing issues but

26
0:01:15.63,000 --> 0:01:19,000
how actually to do this in a world that

27
0:01:17.7,000 --> 0:01:21,000
we that's so divided so deeply divided

28
0:01:20.28,000 --> 0:01:24,000
when we live in a world in which we with

29
0:01:22.59,000 --> 0:01:25,000
cousins and aunts and uncles can't talk

30
0:01:24.509,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to one another when we often live in

31
0:01:26.52,000 --> 0:01:31,000
separate and distinct news ecosystems

32
0:01:29.189,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and when we reflexively and habitually

33
0:01:32.25,000 --> 0:01:38,000
malign and dismiss those with whom we

34
0:01:34.11,000 --> 0:01:4,000
disagree but we wanted to try and so

35
0:01:39.21,000 --> 0:01:42,000
right after the 2016 election and that

36
0:01:41.04,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in that time between the election and

37
0:01:42.78,000 --> 0:01:46,000
the inauguration we partnered with the

38
0:01:45.36,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Alabama media group to do something

39
0:01:47.22,000 --> 0:01:5,000
really different

40
0:01:48.06,000 --> 0:01:53,000
we brought 25 Trump supporters from

41
0:01:50.939,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Alabama together in conversation with 25

42
0:01:53.159,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Clinton supporters from California and

43
0:01:55.11,000 --> 0:02:,000
we brought them together in a closed

44
0:01:57.09,000 --> 0:02:04,000
moderated Facebook group that we kept

45
0:02:00.329,000 --> 0:02:05,000
open for a month what we wanted to do

46
0:02:04.439,000 --> 0:02:09,000
was to give them a place to engage with

47
0:02:06.21,000 --> 0:02:1,000
genuine curiosity and openness and we

48
0:02:09.599,000 --> 0:02:11,000
wanted to support them in building

49
0:02:10.739,000 --> 0:02:12,000
relationships not just with each other

50
0:02:12.15,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but with us as journal

51
0:02:13.47,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and then we wanted to supply facts and

52
0:02:16.59,000 --> 0:02:2,000
information facts and information that

53
0:02:18.6,000 --> 0:02:22,000
they could actually receive and process

54
0:02:20.91,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and use to undergird their conversations

55
0:02:23.01,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and so as a prelude to this conversation

56
0:02:26.73,000 --> 0:02:32,000
verse a ssin the first step in what we

57
0:02:28.65,000 --> 0:02:33,000
call dialogue journalism we asked what

58
0:02:32.79,000 --> 0:02:37,000
they thought the other side's thought of

59
0:02:34.47,000 --> 0:02:38,000
them so when we asked the Trump

60
0:02:38.31,000 --> 0:02:4,000
supporters from Alabama what they

61
0:02:39.45,000 --> 0:02:42,000
thought the Clinton supporters in

62
0:02:40.8,000 --> 0:02:44,000
California thought of them this is not

63
0:02:42.6,000 --> 0:02:46,000
what they said they'd think we were

64
0:02:44.94,000 --> 0:02:49,000
religious bible thumpers that were

65
0:02:46.71,000 --> 0:02:5,000
backwards and Hickock and stupid they

66
0:02:50.37,000 --> 0:02:53,000
think that we all have confederate flags

67
0:02:51.69,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in our yards that were racist and sexist

68
0:02:53.85,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and uneducated they think we're barefoot

69
0:02:56.19,000 --> 0:03:,000
and pregnant with dirt driveways and

70
0:02:58.7,000 --> 0:03:01,000
then think we're all prissy butts and we

71
0:03:01.08,000 --> 0:03:05,000
walk around in hoop skirts with cotton

72
0:03:02.61,000 --> 0:03:06,000
fields in the background and then we ask

73
0:03:05.61,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that same questions of question of the

74
0:03:07.32,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Californians what do you think to

75
0:03:08.49,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Alabamians think about you and they said

76
0:03:11.22,000 --> 0:03:15,000
this that were crazy liberal

77
0:03:13.23,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Californians that were not patriotic or

78
0:03:15.78,000 --> 0:03:18,000
snobby and were elitist or godless and

79
0:03:18.209,000 --> 0:03:21,000
were permissive with our children and

80
0:03:19.73,000 --> 0:03:23,000
then we're focused on our career is not

81
0:03:22.02,000 --> 0:03:24,000
our family and there were leadest

82
0:03:23.94,000 --> 0:03:26,000
pie-in-the-sky

83
0:03:24.87,000 --> 0:03:31,000
intellectuals rich people whole food

84
0:03:27.63,000 --> 0:03:33,000
eating very out of touch so by asking

85
0:03:32.55,000 --> 0:03:35,000
questions like this at the start of

86
0:03:33.9,000 --> 0:03:38,000
every conversation and by identifying

87
0:03:35.88,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and sharing stereotypes we find that

88
0:03:38.91,000 --> 0:03:43,000
people people on all sides begin to see

89
0:03:41.37,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the simplistic and often mean-spirited

90
0:03:43.92,000 --> 0:03:47,000
caricatures they carry and in that after

91
0:03:47.04,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that we can move into a process of

92
0:03:48.87,000 --> 0:03:54,000
genuine conversation so in the two years

93
0:03:53.58,000 --> 0:03:56,000
since that launched California Alabama

94
0:03:55.23,000 --> 0:03:58,000
project we've gone on to host dialogues

95
0:03:57.15,000 --> 0:04:,000
and partnerships with media

96
0:03:58.86,000 --> 0:04:01,000
organizations across the country and

97
0:04:00.51,000 --> 0:04:04,000
they've been about some of our most

98
0:04:02.37,000 --> 0:04:09,000
contentious issues guns immigration race

99
0:04:05.13,000 --> 0:04:12,000
education and what we found remarkably

100
0:04:10.17,000 --> 0:04:14,000
is that real dialogue is in fact

101
0:04:12.3,000 --> 0:04:17,000
possible and that when given a chance

102
0:04:14.489,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and structure around doing so many not

103
0:04:17.37,000 --> 0:04:24,000
all but many of our fellow citizens are

104
0:04:19.29,000 --> 0:04:26,000
eager to engage with the other too often

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
journalists have sharp

106
0:04:26.68,000 --> 0:04:29,000
divides in the name of drama or

107
0:04:28.36,000 --> 0:04:32,000
readership or in service to our own

108
0:04:30.009,000 --> 0:04:34,000
views and too often we've gone to each

109
0:04:32.86,000 --> 0:04:35,000
side loading a partisan voice on one

110
0:04:34.87,000 --> 0:04:37,000
side and a partisan voice on the other

111
0:04:36.49,000 --> 0:04:4,000
with the telling anecdotal lede in a

112
0:04:38.65,000 --> 0:04:43,000
pissy final quote all of which readers

113
0:04:40.93,000 --> 0:04:45,000
are keen to mind for bias but our

114
0:04:43.96,000 --> 0:04:49,000
dialogue based process has a slower pace

115
0:04:46.66,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and a different center and our work is

116
0:04:50.139,000 --> 0:04:54,000
guided by the principle that dialogue

117
0:04:52.78,000 --> 0:04:55,000
across difference is essential to a

118
0:04:54.28,000 --> 0:04:57,000
functioning democracy and that

119
0:04:55.949,000 --> 0:04:59,000
journalism and journalists have a

120
0:04:58.12,000 --> 0:05:06,000
multi-faceted role to play in supporting

121
0:05:00.4,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that so how do we work at every stage

122
0:05:06.25,000 --> 0:05:1,000
we're as transparent as possible about

123
0:05:08.979,000 --> 0:05:11,000
our methods and our motives at every

124
0:05:11.139,000 --> 0:05:14,000
stage we take time to answer people's

125
0:05:12.49,000 --> 0:05:17,000
questions explain why we're doing what

126
0:05:14.56,000 --> 0:05:19,000
we're doing we tell people it's not a

127
0:05:17.59,000 --> 0:05:19,000
trap no one's there to tell you you're

128
0:05:19.66,000 --> 0:05:2,000
stupid

129
0:05:20.139,000 --> 0:05:24,000
no one's there to tell you your

130
0:05:21.34,000 --> 0:05:25,000
experience doesn't matter and we always

131
0:05:24.55,000 --> 0:05:28,000
ask for a really different sort of

132
0:05:26.169,000 --> 0:05:31,000
behavior a reap a turning away from the

133
0:05:29.229,000 --> 0:05:33,000
reflexive name-calling so entrenched in

134
0:05:31.36,000 --> 0:05:36,000
our discourse that most of us on all

135
0:05:33.31,000 --> 0:05:36,000
sides don't even notice it anymore

136
0:05:37.08,000 --> 0:05:41,000
so people often come into our

137
0:05:39.01,000 --> 0:05:42,000
conversations a bit angrily and they

138
0:05:41.289,000 --> 0:05:45,000
they say things like how can you believe

139
0:05:43,000 --> 0:05:49,000
acts and how can you read why and and

140
0:05:45.789,000 --> 0:05:5,000
you believe that this happened but

141
0:05:49.27,000 --> 0:05:52,000
generally in this miracle that it

142
0:05:50.919,000 --> 0:05:53,000
delights us every time people begin to

143
0:05:53.169,000 --> 0:05:56,000
introduce themselves and they begin to

144
0:05:54.669,000 --> 0:05:57,000
explain who they are and where they come

145
0:05:56.47,000 --> 0:06:01,000
from and they begin to ask questions of

146
0:05:58.57,000 --> 0:06:02,000
one another and slowly over time people

147
0:06:01.539,000 --> 0:06:04,000
circle back again and again to difficult

148
0:06:03.28,000 --> 0:06:07,000
topics each time with a little more

149
0:06:05.32,000 --> 0:06:1,000
empathy a little more nuance a little

150
0:06:07.63,000 --> 0:06:11,000
more curiosity and our journalist

151
0:06:10.659,000 --> 0:06:13,000
moderators work really hard to support

152
0:06:12.19,000 --> 0:06:17,000
this because it's not a debate it's not

153
0:06:14.5,000 --> 0:06:19,000
a battle it's not a Sunday morning talk

154
0:06:17.229,000 --> 0:06:22,000
show it's not the flinging of talking

155
0:06:19.78,000 --> 0:06:23,000
points it's not the stacking of memes

156
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and gifts or articles with headlines

157
0:06:23.83,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that prove a point and it's not about

158
0:06:26.74,000 --> 0:06:32,000
scoring political victories with

159
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:36,000
question traps so what we've learned is

160
0:06:33.539,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that our state of discord is bad for

161
0:06:36.19,000 --> 0:06:39,000
everyone it is a deeply unhappy state of

162
0:06:38.469,000 --> 0:06:41,000
being

163
0:06:39.86,000 --> 0:06:42,000
people tell us this again and again they

164
0:06:42.139,000 --> 0:06:46,000
say they appreciate the chance to engage

165
0:06:43.759,000 --> 0:06:47,000
respectfully with curiosity with

166
0:06:46.49,000 --> 0:06:49,000
openness and that they are glad and

167
0:06:48.139,000 --> 0:06:53,000
relieved for a chance to put down their

168
0:06:50.09,000 --> 0:06:56,000
arms and so we do our work in direct

169
0:06:54.11,000 --> 0:06:58,000
challenge to the political climate in

170
0:06:56.479,000 --> 0:06:59,000
our country right now and we do it

171
0:06:58.159,000 --> 0:07:01,000
knowing that it is difficult challenging

172
0:06:59.81,000 --> 0:07:03,000
work to hold and support people in

173
0:07:01.939,000 --> 0:07:07,000
opposing backgrounds and conversation

174
0:07:03.919,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and we do it knowing democracy depends

175
0:07:08.24,000 --> 0:07:12,000
on our ability to address our shared

176
0:07:09.8,000 --> 0:07:13,000
problems together and we do this work by

177
0:07:12.65,000 --> 0:07:15,000
putting community at the heart of our

178
0:07:14.3,000 --> 0:07:18,000
journalistic process by putting our egos

179
0:07:16.25,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to the side to listen first to listen

180
0:07:18.349,000 --> 0:07:23,000
deeply to listen around and through our

181
0:07:21.289,000 --> 0:07:26,000
own biases our own habits of thought and

182
0:07:23.719,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to support others in doing the same and

183
0:07:26.949,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we do this work knowing that journalism

184
0:07:29.539,000 --> 0:07:32,000
is an institution is struggling and that

185
0:07:31.219,000 --> 0:07:34,000
it has always had a role to play and can

186
0:07:33.529,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we'll continue to have a role to play in

187
0:07:35.21,000 --> 0:07:41,000
supporting the exchange of ideas and

188
0:07:37.009,000 --> 0:07:42,000
views so for many of the participants in

189
0:07:41.96,000 --> 0:07:44,000
our groups there are lasting

190
0:07:42.879,000 --> 0:07:45,000
reverberations many people have become

191
0:07:45.349,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Facebook friends and in real life

192
0:07:46.699,000 --> 0:07:5,000
friends too across political lines after

193
0:07:49.789,000 --> 0:07:53,000
we closed that first Trump Clinton

194
0:07:51.199,000 --> 0:07:55,000
project about two-thirds of the women

195
0:07:54.319,000 --> 0:07:56,000
went on to form their own Facebook group

196
0:07:55.969,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and they chose a moderator from each

197
0:07:57.289,000 --> 0:08:01,000
state and they continued to talk about

198
0:07:59.479,000 --> 0:08:02,000
difficult and challenging issues and

199
0:08:01.55,000 --> 0:08:04,000
people tell us again and again that they

200
0:08:03.469,000 --> 0:08:07,000
are grateful for the opportunity to be a

201
0:08:05.479,000 --> 0:08:09,000
part of this work grateful to know the

202
0:08:07.969,000 --> 0:08:11,000
people on the other side aren't crazy

203
0:08:09.729,000 --> 0:08:12,000
grateful that they've had a chance to

204
0:08:12.229,000 --> 0:08:17,000
connect with people they wouldn't have

205
0:08:13.31,000 --> 0:08:18,000
otherwise talked to and a lot of what

206
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
we've seen and learned despite the fact

207
0:08:18.529,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that we call herself spaceship media is

208
0:08:20.089,000 --> 0:08:24,000
not at all rocket science if you call

209
0:08:22.939,000 --> 0:08:26,000
people names if you label them if you

210
0:08:24.919,000 --> 0:08:27,000
insult them they're not inclined to

211
0:08:26.96,000 --> 0:08:29,000
listen to you

212
0:08:27.939,000 --> 0:08:33,000
snark doesn't help shame doesn't help

213
0:08:30.68,000 --> 0:08:36,000
condescension doesn't help genuine

214
0:08:34.399,000 --> 0:08:39,000
communication takes practice and effort

215
0:08:36.829,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and restraint and self-awareness there

216
0:08:40.37,000 --> 0:08:46,000
isn't an algorithm to solve where we are

217
0:08:43.57,000 --> 0:08:49,000
because real human connection is in fact

218
0:08:46.519,000 --> 0:08:51,000
real human connection so lead with

219
0:08:49.88,000 --> 0:08:52,000
curiosity emphasize discussion not

220
0:08:52.339,000 --> 0:08:57,000
debate yet

221
0:08:53.3,000 --> 0:09:,000
out of your silo because real connection

222
0:08:58.04,000 --> 0:09:05,000
across difference this is a salve that

223
0:09:01.22,000 --> 0:09:1,000
our democracy sorely needs thank you

224
0:09:05.52,000 --> 0:09:1,000
[Applause]

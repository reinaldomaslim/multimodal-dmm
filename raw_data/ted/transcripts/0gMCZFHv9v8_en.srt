Translator: Timothy Covell Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:12.346,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is me building a prototype

3
0:00:15.116,000 --> 0:00:17,000
for six hours straight.

4
0:00:18.036,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This is slave labor to my own project.

5
0:00:21.957,000 --> 0:00:25,000
This is what the DIY and maker movements really look like.

6
0:00:26.947,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And this is an analogy for today's construction and manufacturing world

7
0:00:31.713,000 --> 0:00:33,000
with brute-force assembly techniques.

8
0:00:34.501,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And this is exactly why I started studying

9
0:00:37.335,000 --> 0:00:41,000
how to program physical materials to build themselves.

10
0:00:41.604,000 --> 0:00:42,000
But there is another world.

11
0:00:43.364,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Today at the micro- and nanoscales,

12
0:00:45.359,000 --> 0:00:47,000
there's an unprecedented revolution happening.

13
0:00:48.11,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And this is the ability to program physical and biological materials

14
0:00:52.242,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to change shape, change properties

15
0:00:54.966,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and even compute outside of silicon-based matter.

16
0:00:57.952,000 --> 0:00:59,000
There's even a software called cadnano

17
0:01:00.459,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that allows us to design three-dimensional shapes

18
0:01:03.242,000 --> 0:01:06,000
like nano robots or drug delivery systems

19
0:01:06.326,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and use DNA to self-assemble those functional structures.

20
0:01:10.629,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But if we look at the human scale,

21
0:01:12.702,000 --> 0:01:15,000
there's massive problems that aren't being addressed

22
0:01:15.758,000 --> 0:01:17,000
by those nanoscale technologies.

23
0:01:18.126,000 --> 0:01:2,000
If we look at construction and manufacturing,

24
0:01:20.225,000 --> 0:01:24,000
there's major inefficiencies, energy consumption

25
0:01:24.418,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and excessive labor techniques.

26
0:01:26.745,000 --> 0:01:28,000
In infrastructure, let's just take one example.

27
0:01:29.25,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Take piping.

28
0:01:30.733,000 --> 0:01:33,000
In water pipes, we have fixed-capacity water pipes

29
0:01:34.458,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that have fixed flow rates, except for expensive pumps and valves.

30
0:01:38.917,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We bury them in the ground.

31
0:01:40.208,000 --> 0:01:42,000
If anything changes -- if the environment changes,

32
0:01:42.829,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the ground moves, or demand changes --

33
0:01:45.466,000 --> 0:01:49,000
we have to start from scratch and take them out and replace them.

34
0:01:49.716,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So I'd like to propose that we can combine those two worlds,

35
0:01:53.084,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that we can combine the world of the nanoscale programmable adaptive materials

36
0:01:58.255,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and the built environment.

37
0:01:59.932,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I don't mean automated machines.

38
0:02:02.118,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I don't just mean smart machines that replace humans.

39
0:02:04.577,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But I mean programmable materials that build themselves.

40
0:02:08.461,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And that's called self-assembly,

41
0:02:10.517,000 --> 0:02:14,000
which is a process by which disordered parts build an ordered structure

42
0:02:15.034,000 --> 0:02:17,000
through only local interaction.

43
0:02:17.527,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So what do we need if we want to do this at the human scale?

44
0:02:20.702,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We need a few simple ingredients.

45
0:02:22.677,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The first ingredient is materials and geometry,

46
0:02:25.516,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and that needs to be tightly coupled with the energy source.

47
0:02:28.985,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And you can use passive energy --

48
0:02:30.643,000 --> 0:02:34,000
so heat, shaking, pneumatics, gravity, magnetics.

49
0:02:35.327,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And then you need smartly designed interactions.

50
0:02:38.402,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And those interactions allow for error correction,

51
0:02:40.535,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and they allow the shapes to go from one state to another state.

52
0:02:44.535,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So now I'm going to show you a number of projects that we've built,

53
0:02:47.767,000 --> 0:02:5,000
from one-dimensional, two-dimensional, three-dimensional

54
0:02:51.051,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and even four-dimensional systems.

55
0:02:54.118,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So in one-dimensional systems --

56
0:02:56.004,000 --> 0:02:58,000
this is a project called the self-folding proteins.

57
0:02:58.911,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And the idea is that you take the three-dimensional structure of a protein --

58
0:03:03.618,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in this case it's the crambin protein --

59
0:03:06.299,000 --> 0:03:09,000
you take the backbone -- so no cross-linking, no environmental interactions --

60
0:03:09.945,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and you break that down into a series of components.

61
0:03:13.096,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And then we embed elastic.

62
0:03:15.37,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And when I throw this up into the air and catch it,

63
0:03:17.711,000 --> 0:03:21,000
it has the full three-dimensional structure of the protein, all of the intricacies.

64
0:03:22.562,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And this gives us a tangible model

65
0:03:24.662,000 --> 0:03:27,000
of the three-dimensional protein and how it folds

66
0:03:28.396,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and all of the intricacies of the geometry.

67
0:03:30.68,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So we can study this as a physical, intuitive model.

68
0:03:34.128,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And we're also translating that into two-dimensional systems --

69
0:03:36.93,000 --> 0:03:4,000
so flat sheets that can self-fold into three-dimensional structures.

70
0:03:41.229,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In three dimensions, we did a project last year at TEDGlobal

71
0:03:45.682,000 --> 0:03:46,000
with Autodesk and Arthur Olson

72
0:03:47.646,000 --> 0:03:48,000
where we looked at autonomous parts --

73
0:03:49.344,000 --> 0:03:53,000
so individual parts not pre-connected that can come together on their own.

74
0:03:53.663,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And we built 500 of these glass beakers.

75
0:03:56.429,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They had different molecular structures inside

76
0:03:58.896,000 --> 0:04:,000
and different colors that could be mixed and matched.

77
0:04:01.12,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And we gave them away to all the TEDsters.

78
0:04:03.369,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And so these became intuitive models

79
0:04:05.87,000 --> 0:04:08,000
to understand how molecular self-assembly works at the human scale.

80
0:04:09.362,000 --> 0:04:1,000
This is the polio virus.

81
0:04:11.179,000 --> 0:04:12,000
You shake it hard and it breaks apart.

82
0:04:13.111,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And then you shake it randomly

83
0:04:14.557,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and it starts to error correct and built the structure on its own.

84
0:04:18.061,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And this is demonstrating that through random energy,

85
0:04:21.028,000 --> 0:04:25,000
we can build non-random shapes.

86
0:04:25.656,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We even demonstrated that we can do this at a much larger scale.

87
0:04:29.18,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Last year at TED Long Beach,

88
0:04:31.334,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we built an installation that builds installations.

89
0:04:34.545,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The idea was, could we self-assemble furniture-scale objects?

90
0:04:38.082,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So we built a large rotating chamber,

91
0:04:40.583,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and people would come up and spin the chamber faster or slower,

92
0:04:43.796,000 --> 0:04:44,000
adding energy to the system

93
0:04:45.381,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and getting an intuitive understanding of how self-assembly works

94
0:04:48.827,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and how we could use this

95
0:04:50.206,000 --> 0:04:54,000
as a macroscale construction or manufacturing technique for products.

96
0:04:54.952,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So remember, I said 4D.

97
0:04:56.619,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So today for the first time, we're unveiling a new project,

98
0:05:00.314,000 --> 0:05:01,000
which is a collaboration with Stratasys,

99
0:05:02.2,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and it's called 4D printing.

100
0:05:04.035,000 --> 0:05:05,000
The idea behind 4D printing

101
0:05:05.995,000 --> 0:05:08,000
is that you take multi-material 3D printing --

102
0:05:08.995,000 --> 0:05:1,000
so you can deposit multiple materials --

103
0:05:11.184,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and you add a new capability,

104
0:05:13.068,000 --> 0:05:14,000
which is transformation,

105
0:05:14.934,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that right off the bed,

106
0:05:16.251,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the parts can transform from one shape to another shape directly on their own.

107
0:05:20.578,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And this is like robotics without wires or motors.

108
0:05:24.078,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So you completely print this part,

109
0:05:25.729,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and it can transform into something else.

110
0:05:28.533,000 --> 0:05:32,000
We also worked with Autodesk on a software they're developing called Project Cyborg.

111
0:05:33.494,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And this allows us to simulate this self-assembly behavior

112
0:05:36.617,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and try to optimize which parts are folding when.

113
0:05:39.819,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But most importantly, we can use this same software

114
0:05:42.549,000 --> 0:05:44,000
for the design of nanoscale self-assembly systems

115
0:05:45.457,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and human scale self-assembly systems.

116
0:05:48.3,000 --> 0:05:51,000
These are parts being printed with multi-material properties.

117
0:05:51.813,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Here's the first demonstration.

118
0:05:53.53,000 --> 0:05:54,000
A single strand dipped in water

119
0:05:55.434,000 --> 0:05:57,000
that completely self-folds on its own

120
0:05:57.783,000 --> 0:06:,000
into the letters M I T.

121
0:06:01.701,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I'm biased.

122
0:06:03.523,000 --> 0:06:06,000
This is another part, single strand, dipped in a bigger tank

123
0:06:06.972,000 --> 0:06:1,000
that self-folds into a cube, a three-dimensional structure, on its own.

124
0:06:11.595,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So no human interaction.

125
0:06:13.446,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And we think this is the first time

126
0:06:15.335,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that a program and transformation

127
0:06:17.582,000 --> 0:06:2,000
has been embedded directly into the materials themselves.

128
0:06:20.832,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And it also might just be the manufacturing technique

129
0:06:23.562,000 --> 0:06:27,000
that allows us to produce more adaptive infrastructure in the future.

130
0:06:27.696,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So I know you're probably thinking,

131
0:06:28.882,000 --> 0:06:32,000
okay, that's cool, but how do we use any of this stuff for the built environment?

132
0:06:33.114,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So I've started a lab at MIT,

133
0:06:35.369,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and it's called the Self-Assembly Lab.

134
0:06:37.251,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And we're dedicated to trying to develop programmable materials

135
0:06:40.395,000 --> 0:06:41,000
for the built environment.

136
0:06:41.586,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And we think there's a few key sectors

137
0:06:43.549,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that have fairly near-term applications.

138
0:06:45.863,000 --> 0:06:47,000
One of those is in extreme environments.

139
0:06:47.918,000 --> 0:06:49,000
These are scenarios where it's difficult to build,

140
0:06:50.464,000 --> 0:06:52,000
our current construction techniques don't work,

141
0:06:52.952,000 --> 0:06:55,000
it's too large, it's too dangerous, it's expensive, too many parts.

142
0:06:56.512,000 --> 0:06:58,000
And space is a great example of that.

143
0:06:58.879,000 --> 0:07:,000
We're trying to design new scenarios for space

144
0:07:01.245,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that have fully reconfigurable and self-assembly structures

145
0:07:04.545,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that can go from highly functional systems from one to another.

146
0:07:08.235,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Let's go back to infrastructure.

147
0:07:10.346,000 --> 0:07:13,000
In infrastructure, we're working with a company out of Boston called Geosyntec.

148
0:07:14.245,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And we're developing a new paradigm for piping.

149
0:07:17.045,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Imagine if water pipes could expand or contract

150
0:07:20.668,000 --> 0:07:22,000
to change capacity or change flow rate,

151
0:07:23.418,000 --> 0:07:27,000
or maybe even undulate like peristaltics to move the water themselves.

152
0:07:27.952,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So this isn't expensive pumps or valves.

153
0:07:30.562,000 --> 0:07:34,000
This is a completely programmable and adaptive pipe on its own.

154
0:07:34.845,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So I want to remind you today

155
0:07:36.66,000 --> 0:07:39,000
of the harsh realities of assembly in our world.

156
0:07:40.044,000 --> 0:07:43,000
These are complex things built with complex parts

157
0:07:43.509,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that come together in complex ways.

158
0:07:46.294,000 --> 0:07:49,000
So I would like to invite you from whatever industry you're from

159
0:07:49.493,000 --> 0:07:53,000
to join us in reinventing and reimagining the world,

160
0:07:53.546,000 --> 0:07:56,000
how things come together from the nanoscale to the human scale,

161
0:07:57.245,000 --> 0:08:,000
so that we can go from a world like this

162
0:08:00.32,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to a world that's more like this.

163
0:08:12.632,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Thank you.

164
0:08:14.542,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Applause)

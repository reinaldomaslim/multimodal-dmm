1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Do we live in a borderless world?

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Before you answer that, have a look at this map.

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Contemporary political map shows

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that we have over 200 countries in the world today.

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
That's probably more than at any time in centuries.

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Now, many of you will object.

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
For you this would be a more appropriate map.

8
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
You could call it TEDistan.

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
In TEDistan, there are no borders,

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
just connected spaces and unconnected spaces.

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Most of you probably reside in one of the 40 dots

12
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
on this screen, of the many more

13
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that represent 90 percent of the world economy.

14
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But let's talk about the 90 percent of the world population

15
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that will never leave the place in which they were born.

16
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
For them, nations, countries, boundaries, borders still matter a great deal,

17
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and often violently.

18
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Now here at TED, we're solving some of the great

19
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
riddles of science and mysteries of the universe.

20
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Well here is a fundamental problem we have not solved:

21
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
our basic political geography.

22
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
How do we distribute ourselves around the world?

23
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Now this is important, because border conflicts

24
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
justify so much of the world's military-industrial complex.

25
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Border conflicts can derail

26
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
so much of the progress that we hope to achieve here.

27
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So I think we need a deeper understanding

28
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
of how people, money, power,

29
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
religion, culture, technology

30
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
interact to change the map of the world.

31
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And we can try to anticipate those changes,

32
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and shape them in a more constructive direction.

33
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So we're going to look at some maps of the past,

34
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the present and some maps you haven't seen

35
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
in order to get a sense of where things are going.

36
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Let's start with the world of 1945.

37
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
1945 there were just 100 countries in the world.

38
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
After World War II, Europe was devastated,

39
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but still held large overseas colonies:

40
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
French West Africa, British East Africa, South Asia, and so forth.

41
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Then over the late '40s,

42
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
'50s, '60s, '70s and '80s,

43
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
waves of decolonization took place.

44
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Over 50 new countries were born.

45
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
You can see that Africa has been fragmented.

46
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South East Asian nations created.

47
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Then came the end of the Cold War.

48
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The end of the Cold War and the disintegration of the Soviet Union.

49
0:02:24.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
You had the creation of new states in Eastern Europe,

50
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
the former Yugoslav republics and the Balkans,

51
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and the 'stans of central Asia.

52
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Today we have 200 countries in the world.

53
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
The entire planet is covered

54
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
by sovereign, independent nation-states.

55
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Does that mean that someone's gain has to be someone else's loss?

56
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Let's zoom in on one of the most strategic areas of the world,

57
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Eastern Eurasia.

58
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
As you can see on this map,

59
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Russia is still the largest country in the world.

60
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And as you know, China is the most populous.

61
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And they share a lengthy land border.

62
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
What you don't see on this map

63
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is that most of Russia's 150 million people

64
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
are concentrated in its western provinces

65
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and areas that are close to Europe.

66
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And only 30 million people are in its eastern areas.

67
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
In fact, the World Bank predicts

68
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that Russia's population is declining

69
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
towards about 120 million people

70
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And there is another thing that you don't see on this map.

71
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Stalin, Khrushchev and other Soviet leaders

72
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
forced Russians out to the far east

73
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
to be in gulags, labor camps,

74
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
nuclear cities, whatever the case was.

75
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But as oil prices rose,

76
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Russian governments have invested in infrastructure

77
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to unite the country, east and west.

78
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
But nothing has more perversely impacted

79
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Russia's demographic distribution,

80
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
because the people in the east, who never wanted to be there anyway,

81
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
have gotten on those trains and roads

82
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and gone back to the west.

83
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
As a result, in the Russian far east today,

84
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
which is twice the size of India,

85
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
you have exactly six million Russians.

86
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So let's get a sense of what is happening in this part of the world.

87
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We can start with Mongolia, or as some call it, Mine-golia.

88
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Why do they call it that?

89
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Because in Mine-golia, Chinese firms operate

90
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and own most of the mines -- copper, zinc, gold --

91
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and they truck the resources south and east into mainland China.

92
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
China isn't conquering Mongolia.

93
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It's buying it.

94
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Colonies were once conquered. Today countries are bought.

95
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So let's apply this principle to Siberia.

96
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Siberia most of you probably think of

97
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
as a cold, desolate, unlivable place.

98
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
But in fact, with global warming and rising temperatures,

99
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
all of a sudden you have vast wheat fields

100
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and agribusiness, and grain being produced in Siberia.

101
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
But who is it going to feed?

102
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Well, just on the other side of the Amo River,

103
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in the Heilongjiang and Harbin provinces of China,

104
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
you have over 100 million people.

105
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
That's larger than the entire population of Russia.

106
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Every single year, for at least a decade or more,

107
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
[60,000] of them have been voting with their feet,

108
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
crossing, moving north and inhabiting this desolate terrain.

109
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
They set up their own bazaars and medical clinics.

110
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They've taken over the timber industry

111
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and been shipping the lumber east, back into China.

112
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Again, like Mongolia,

113
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
China isn't conquering Russia. It's just leasing it.

114
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
That's what I call globalization Chinese style.

115
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Now maybe this is what the map of the region

116
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
might look like in 10 to 20 years.

117
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But hold on. This map is 700 years old.

118
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This is the map of the Yuan Dynasty,

119
0:05:31.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
led by Kublai Khan, the grandson of Genghis Khan.

120
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
So history doesn't necessarily repeat itself,

121
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
but it does rhyme.

122
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
This is just to give you a taste of what's happening in this part of the world.

123
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Again, globalization Chinese style.

124
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Because globalization opens up all kinds of ways for us to

125
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
undermine and change the way we think about political geography.

126
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:56,000
So, the history of East Asia in fact,

127
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
people don't think about nations and borders.

128
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
They think more in terms of empires and hierarchies,

129
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
usually Chinese or Japanese.

130
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Well it's China's turn again.

131
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So let's look at how China is re-establishing

132
0:06:07.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that hierarchy in the far East.

133
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It starts with the global hubs.

134
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Remember the 40 dots on the nighttime map

135
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that show the hubs of the global economy?

136
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
East Asia today has more of those global hubs

137
0:06:18.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
than any other region in the world.

138
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Shanghai,

139
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Hong Kong, Singapore and Sidney.

140
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
These are the filters and funnels of global capital.

141
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Trillions of dollars a year are being brought into the region,

142
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
so much of it being invested into China.

143
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Then there is trade.

144
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
These vectors and arrows represent ever stronger

145
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
trade relationships that China has

146
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
with every country in the region.

147
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Specifically, it targets Japan

148
0:06:44.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and Korea and Australia,

149
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
countries that are strong allies of the United States.

150
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Australia, for example, is heavily dependent

151
0:06:50.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
on exporting iron ore and natural gas to China.

152
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
For poorer countries, China reduces tariffs

153
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
so that Laos and Cambodia can sell their goods more cheaply

154
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and become dependent on exporting to China as well.

155
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And now many of you have been reading in the news

156
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
how people are looking to China

157
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to lead the rebound, the economic rebound, not just in Asia, but potentially for the world.

158
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The Asian free trade zone, almost free trade zone, that's emerging

159
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
now has a greater trade volume than trade across the Pacific.

160
0:07:20.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So China is becoming the anchor of the economy in the region.

161
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Another pillar of this strategy is diplomacy.

162
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
China has signed military agreements with many countries in the region.

163
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It has become the hub of diplomatic institutions

164
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
such as the East Asian Community.

165
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Some of these organizations don't even have

166
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
the United States as a member.

167
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
There is a treaty of nonaggression between countries,

168
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
such that if there were a conflict between China and the United States,

169
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
most countries vow to just sit it out,

170
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
including American allies like Korea and Australia.

171
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Another pillar of the strategy,

172
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
like Russia, is demographic.

173
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:58,000
China exports business people, nannies, students,

174
0:07:58.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
teachers to teach Chinese around the region,

175
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to intermarry and to occupy ever greater

176
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
commanding heights of the economies.

177
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Already ethnic Chinese people

178
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
in Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia

179
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
are the real key factors and drivers

180
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
in the economies there.

181
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Chinese pride is resurgent in the region

182
0:08:18.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
as a result.

183
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Singapore, for example, used to ban Chinese language education.

184
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Now it encourages it.

185
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
If you add it all up what do you get?

186
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Well, if you remember before World War II,

187
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Japan had a vision

188
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
for a greater Japanese co-prosperity sphere.

189
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
What's emerging today is what you might call

190
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
a greater Chinese co-prosperity sphere.

191
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So no matter what the lines on the map tell you

192
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
in terms of nations and borders,

193
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
what you really have emerging in the far east

194
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
are national cultures,

195
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
but in a much more fluid, imperial zone.

196
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
All of this is happening without firing a shot.

197
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
That's most certainly not the case in the Middle East

198
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
where countries are still very uncomfortable

199
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:02,000
in the borders left behind by European colonialists.

200
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So what can we do to think about borders differently in this part of the world?

201
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
What lines on the map should we focus on?

202
0:09:08.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
What I want to present to you is what I call

203
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:13,000
state building, day by day.

204
0:09:13.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Let's start with Iraq.

205
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Six years after the U.S. invasion of Iraq,

206
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the country still exists more on a map than it does in reality.

207
0:09:20.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Oil used to be one of the forces holding Iraq together;

208
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
now it is the most significant cause of the country's disintegration.

209
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
The reason is Kurdistan.

210
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The Kurds for 3,000 years

211
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
have been waging a struggle for independence,

212
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and now is their chance to finally have it.

213
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
These are pipeline routes, which emerge from Kurdistan,

214
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
which is an oil-rich region.

215
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And today, if you go to Kurdistan,

216
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
you'll see that Kurdish Peshmerga guerillas

217
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
are squaring off against the Sunni Iraqi army.

218
0:09:47.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
But what are they guarding?

219
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Is it really a border on the map?

220
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
No. It's the pipelines.

221
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
If the Kurds can control their pipelines, they can set the terms

222
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of their own statehood.

223
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
Now should we be upset about this, about the potential disintegration of Iraq?

224
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I don't believe we should.

225
0:10:02.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Iraq will still be the second largest oil producer in the world,

226
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
behind Saudi Arabia.

227
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And we'll have a chance to solve a 3,000 year old dispute.

228
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Now remember Kurdistan is landlocked.

229
0:10:12.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It has no choice but to behave.

230
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
In order to profit from its oil

231
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
it has to export it through Turkey or Syria,

232
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and other countries, and Iraq itself.

233
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And therefore it has to have amicable relations with them.

234
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Now lets look at a perennial conflict in the region.

235
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
That is, of course, in Palestine.

236
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly

237
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
because it's two parts Palestinian, one part Israel.

238
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
30 years of rose garden diplomacy

239
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:41,000
have not delivered us peace in this conflict.

240
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
What might? I believe that what might

241
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
solve the problem is infrastructure.

242
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Today donors are spending billions of dollars on this.

243
0:10:49.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
These two arrows are an arc,

244
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
an arc of commuter railroads and other infrastructure

245
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
that link the West Bank and Gaza.

246
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
If Gaza can have a functioning port

247
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and be linked to the West Bank, you can have a viable Palestinian state,

248
0:11:02.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Palestinian economy.

249
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
That, I believe, is going to bring peace to this particular conflict.

250
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The lesson from Kurdistan and from Palestine

251
0:11:12.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is that independence alone, without infrastructure,

252
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
is futile.

253
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Now what might this entire region look like

254
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
if in fact we focus on other lines on the map besides borders,

255
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
when the insecurities might abate?

256
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The last time that was the case was actually

257
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
a century ago, during the Ottoman Empire.

258
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
This is the Hejaz Railway.

259
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
The Hejaz Railway ran from Istanbul to Medina via Damascus.

260
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
It even had an offshoot running to Haifa

261
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
in what is today Israel, on the Mediterranean Sea.

262
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
But today the Hejaz Railway lies in tatters, ruins.

263
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
If we were to focus on reconstructing these curvy lines on the map,

264
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
infrastructure, that cross the straight lines, the borders,

265
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
I believe the Middle East would be a far more peaceful region.

266
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Now let's look at another part of the world,

267
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the former Soviet Republics of Central Asia, the 'stans.

268
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
These countries' borders originate from Stalin's decrees.

269
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
He purposely did not want these countries to make sense.

270
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
He wanted ethnicities to mingle

271
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
in ways that would allow him to divide and rule.

272
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Fortunately for them, most of their oil and gas resources

273
0:12:13.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
were discovered after the Soviet Union collapsed.

274
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Now I know some of you may be thinking, "Oil, oil, oil.

275
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Why is it all he's talking about is oil?"

276
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Well, there is a big difference in the way we used to talk about oil

277
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and the way we're talking about it now.

278
0:12:26.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Before it was, how do we control their oil?

279
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Now it's their oil for their own purposes.

280
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And I assure you it's every bit as important to them

281
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
as it might have been to colonizers and imperialists.

282
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Here are just some of the pipeline projections

283
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and possibilities and scenarios

284
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and routes that are being mapped out for the next several decades.

285
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
A great deal of them.

286
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
For a number of countries in this part of the world,

287
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
having pipelines is the ticket to becoming part of the global economy

288
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and for having some meaning

289
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
besides the borders that they are not loyal to themselves.

290
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Just take Azerbaijan.

291
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
Azerbaijan was a forgotten corner of the Caucuses,

292
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
but now with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline into Turkey,

293
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
it has rebranded itself as the frontier of the west.

294
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Then there is Turkmenistan, which most people think of

295
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
as a frozen basket case.

296
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
But now it's contributing gas across the Caspian Sea

297
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
to provide for Europe,

298
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and even a potentially Turkmen-

299
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Afghan-Pakistan-India pipeline as well.

300
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Then there is Kazakhstan, which didn't even have a name before.

301
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
It was more considered South Siberia during the Soviet Union.

302
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Today most people recognize Kazakhstan

303
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
as an emerging geopolitical player. Why?

304
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Because it has shrewdly designed pipelines to flow across the Caspian,

305
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
north through Russia, and even east to China.

306
0:13:42.16,000 --> 0:13:46,000
More pipelines means more silk roads, instead of the Great Game.

307
0:13:46.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
The Great Game connotes dominance of one over the other.

308
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Silk road connotes independence and mutual trust.

309
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:56,000
The more pipelines we have, the more silk roads we'll have,

310
0:13:56.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and the less of a dominant Great Game competition

311
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
we'll have in the 21st century.

312
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Now let's look at the only part of the world that really has brought down its borders,

313
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
and how that has enhanced its strength.

314
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And that is, of course, Europe.

315
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
The European Union began as just the coal and steel community of six countries,

316
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and their main purpose was really to keep the rehabilitation of Germany

317
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to happen in a peaceful way.

318
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:23,000
But then eventually it grew into 12 countries,

319
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and those are the 12 stars on the European flag.

320
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
The E.U. also became a currency block,

321
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and is now the most powerful trade block in the entire world.

322
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
On average, the E.U. has grown by one country per year

323
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
since the end of the Cold War.

324
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
In fact most of that happened on just one day.

325
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
In 2004, 15 new countries joined the E.U.

326
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and now you have what most people consider

327
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
a zone of peace spanning 27 countries

328
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and 450 million people.

329
0:14:49.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
So what is next? What is the future of the European Union?

330
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Well in light blue, you see the zones

331
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
or the regions that are at least two-thirds

332
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:14:59,000
or more dependent on the European Union

333
0:14:59.16,000 --> 0:15:01,000
for trade and investment.

334
0:15:01.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
What does that tell us? Trade and investment tell us

335
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
that Europe is putting its money where its mouth is.

336
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Even if these regions aren't part of the E.U.,

337
0:15:09.16,000 --> 0:15:11,000
they are becoming part of its sphere of influence.

338
0:15:11.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Just take the Balkans. Croatia, Serbia

339
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Bosnia, they're not members of the E.U. yet.

340
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
But you can get on a German ICE train

341
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and make it almost to Albania.

342
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:24,000
In Bosnia you use the Euro currency already,

343
0:15:24.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and that's the only currency they're probably ever going to have.

344
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
So, looking at other parts of Europe's periphery, such as North Africa.

345
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
On average, every year or two,

346
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
a new oil or gas pipeline opens up under the Mediterranean,

347
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
connecting North Africa to Europe.

348
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
That not only helps Europe diminish its reliance

349
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
on Russia for energy,

350
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
but if you travel to North Africa today, you'll hear more and more people saying

351
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
that they don't really think of their region as the Middle East.

352
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
So in other words, I believe that President Sarkozy of France

353
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
is right when he talks about a Mediterranean union.

354
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
Now let's look at Turkey and the Caucasus.

355
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:01,000
I mentioned Azerbaijan before.

356
0:16:01.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
That corridor of Turkey and the Caucasus

357
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
has become the conduit for 20 percent

358
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
of Europe's energy supply.

359
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
So does Turkey really have to be a member of the European Union?

360
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:12,000
I don't think it does. I think it's already part of

361
0:16:12.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
a Euro-Turkish superpower.

362
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So what's next? Where are we going to see borders change

363
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
and new countries born?

364
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Well, South Central Asia, South West Asia

365
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
is a very good place to start.

366
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Eight years after the U.S. invaded Afghanistan

367
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:28,000
there is still a tremendous amount of instability.

368
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Pakistan and Afghanistan are still so fragile

369
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
that neither of them have dealt constructively

370
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
with the problem of Pashtun nationalism.

371
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
This is the flag that flies in the minds

372
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:4,000
of 20 million Pashtuns

373
0:16:40.16,000 --> 0:16:43,000
who live on both sides of the Afghan and Pakistan border.

374
0:16:43.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Let's not neglect the insurgency just to the south,

375
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Balochistan. Two weeks ago,

376
0:16:48.16,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Balochi rebels attacked a Pakistani military garrison,

377
0:16:51.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
and this was the flag that they raised over it.

378
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:56,000
The post-colonial entropy

379
0:16:56.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
that is happening around the world is accelerating,

380
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and I expect more such changes to occur in the map

381
0:17:01.16,000 --> 0:17:03,000
as the states fragment.

382
0:17:03.16,000 --> 0:17:05,000
Of course, we can't forget Africa.

383
0:17:05.16,000 --> 0:17:07,000
53 countries, and by far the most number

384
0:17:07.16,000 --> 0:17:1,000
of suspiciously straight lines on the map.

385
0:17:10.16,000 --> 0:17:12,000
If we were to look at all of Africa

386
0:17:12.16,000 --> 0:17:15,000
we could most certainly acknowledge far more,

387
0:17:15.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
tribal divisions and so forth.

388
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
But let's just look at Sudan, the second-largest country in Africa.

389
0:17:21.16,000 --> 0:17:23,000
It has three ongoing civil wars,

390
0:17:23.16,000 --> 0:17:26,000
the genocide in Darfur, which you all know about,

391
0:17:26.16,000 --> 0:17:28,000
the civil war in the east of the country,

392
0:17:28.16,000 --> 0:17:3,000
and south Sudan.

393
0:17:30.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
South Sudan is going to be having a referendum in 2011

394
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
in which it is very likely to vote itself independence.

395
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:4,000
Now let's go up to the Arctic Circle.

396
0:17:40.16,000 --> 0:17:42,000
There is a great race on for energy resources

397
0:17:42.16,000 --> 0:17:44,000
under the Arctic seabed.

398
0:17:44.16,000 --> 0:17:46,000
Who will win? Canada? Russia? The United States?

399
0:17:46.16,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Actually Greenland.

400
0:17:48.16,000 --> 0:17:51,000
Several weeks ago Greenland's [60,000] people

401
0:17:51.16,000 --> 0:17:53,000
voted themselves self-governance rights

402
0:17:53.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
from Denmark.

403
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
So Denmark is about to get a whole lot smaller.

404
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:,000
What is the lesson from all of this?

405
0:18:00.16,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Geopolitics is a very unsentimental discipline.

406
0:18:04.16,000 --> 0:18:06,000
It's constantly morphing and changing the world,

407
0:18:06.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
like climate change.

408
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And like our relationship with the ecosystem

409
0:18:10.16,000 --> 0:18:12,000
we're always searching for equilibrium

410
0:18:12.16,000 --> 0:18:15,000
in how we divide ourselves across the planet.

411
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:17,000
Now we fear changes on the map.

412
0:18:17.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
We fear civil wars, death tolls,

413
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:22,000
having to learn the names of new countries.

414
0:18:22.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
But I believe that the inertia of the existing borders that we have today

415
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:27,000
is far worse and far more violent.

416
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
The question is how do we change those borders,

417
0:18:29.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
and what lines do we focus on?

418
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:33,000
I believe we focus on the lines that cross borders,

419
0:18:33.16,000 --> 0:18:35,000
the infrastructure lines.

420
0:18:35.16,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Then we'll wind up with the world we want, a borderless one.

421
0:18:38.16,000 --> 0:18:4,000
Thank you.

422
0:18:40.16,000 --> 0:18:45,000
(Applause)

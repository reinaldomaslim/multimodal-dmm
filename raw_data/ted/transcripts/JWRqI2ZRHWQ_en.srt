0:00:04.939,000 --> 0:00:09,000
hello friends how's it going it's good

3
0:00:09.599,000 --> 0:00:14,000
to see you

4
0:00:10.639,000 --> 0:00:15,000
my name is Jacob Collier and I'm live

5
0:00:14.669,000 --> 0:00:18,000
all the way from London North London

6
0:00:16.59,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I'm quarantined at home I'm playing the

7
0:00:19.23,000 --> 0:00:23,000
piano right now it is so so nice about

8
0:00:22.08,000 --> 0:00:26,000
to do this I'm gonna sing you some songs

9
0:00:23.46,000 --> 0:00:3,000
for the next 30 minutes or so I've got a

10
0:00:26.189,000 --> 0:00:32,000
few songs to play and this is just it's

11
0:00:30.779,000 --> 0:00:33,000
it's a nice Street but I make some music

12
0:00:32.25,000 --> 0:00:35,000
it feels like making music is one of the

13
0:00:34.47,000 --> 0:00:37,000
more universal of the things that we

14
0:00:35.61,000 --> 0:00:39,000
could be doing right now I'm gonna kick

15
0:00:37.68,000 --> 0:00:42,000
off with a song of mine it's called

16
0:00:40.5,000 --> 0:01:04,000
making me cry and it goes just like this

17
0:00:43.2,000 --> 0:01:11,000
you ready in every sea there's a mouth

18
0:01:05.189,000 --> 0:01:16,000
of a river where waterful riches flow

19
0:01:11.25,000 --> 0:01:21,000
down why do they say

20
0:01:17.17,000 --> 0:01:24,000
[Music]

21
0:01:21.58,000 --> 0:01:29,000
so no one knows why

22
0:01:25.14,000 --> 0:01:29,000
[Music]

23
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
in every mouth there's a word

24
0:01:33.77,000 --> 0:01:5,000
forgiveness that melts or the eyes to

25
0:01:38.93,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the ground why do you sigh see I don't

26
0:01:51.32,000 --> 0:02:12,000
know I why does the sky fall down like

27
0:02:03.89,000 --> 0:02:18,000
war to let it flow again

28
0:02:12.58,000 --> 0:02:18,000

so come a little close to the meter so

30
0:02:25.58,000 --> 0:02:49,000
many things I wanted to see singing

31
0:02:45.23,000 --> 0:02:55,000
every laugh is the soul of all of those

32
0:02:49.73,000 --> 0:02:58,000
tears you've had for so long would you

33
0:02:56.09,000 --> 0:02:59,000

34
0:03:01.36,000 --> 0:03:16,000
let me run try in every tear are the

35
0:03:11.69,000 --> 0:03:21,000
eyes of a father and mother that brought

36
0:03:17.03,000 --> 0:03:26,000
you to see sing lullaby

[Music]

113
0:10:18.18,000 --> 0:10:26,000
thank you very much that was a no sky

114
0:10:22.18,000 --> 0:10:27,000
above how are you all doing it's a very

115
0:10:26.65,000 --> 0:10:28,000
strange time to be alive as a human

116
0:10:27.88,000 --> 0:10:31,000
being you think about this a lot

117
0:10:28.96,000 --> 0:10:32,000
recently all sorts of unknowns at first

118
0:10:32.11,000 --> 0:10:35,000
times people trying to figure out what

119
0:10:33.88,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to do with free time what to do with

120
0:10:35.98,000 --> 0:10:4,000
involved time and in a brand new way

121
0:10:38.52,000 --> 0:10:43,000
it's a it's a fascinating challenge

122
0:10:41.01,000 --> 0:10:45,000
there is any that this is extreme at

123
0:10:43.9,000 --> 0:10:46,000
togetherness I suppose I'm feeling with

124
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
the world everything feels like it's

125
0:10:47.14,000 --> 0:10:49,000
uniting and in a particular kind of a

126
0:10:48.52,000 --> 0:10:51,000
way and everything also feels very

127
0:10:50.08,000 --> 0:10:53,000
disparate and so much that's like an

128
0:10:51.79,000 --> 0:10:54,000
extension of our of our ordinary lives

129
0:10:53.38,000 --> 0:10:56,000
because we're also connected and we're

130
0:10:55.06,000 --> 0:11:,000
also also disparate but feel like now

131
0:10:57.28,000 --> 0:11:01,000
we're so definitively disparate that

132
0:11:00.55,000 --> 0:11:02,000
potentially once this is all over we can

133
0:11:01.78,000 --> 0:11:04,000
come together like never before

134
0:11:03.01,000 --> 0:11:07,000
I'm very very excited about that I'm

135
0:11:05.32,000 --> 0:11:09,000
forever in gratitude to the

136
0:11:07.45,000 --> 0:11:11,000
extraordinary health care workers who

137
0:11:09.94,000 --> 0:11:13,000
are keeping us all in check and who are

138
0:11:11.89,000 --> 0:11:16,000
holding our forts and keep our

139
0:11:14.23,000 --> 0:11:19,000
communities strong it's it's really a

140
0:11:17.32,000 --> 0:11:2,000
wild thing too to be attending to from a

141
0:11:19.48,000 --> 0:11:23,000
distance I suppose everything feels very

142
0:11:20.92,000 --> 0:11:26,000
invisible but yet so huge so I feel like

143
0:11:24.37,000 --> 0:11:27,000
at least I can make some music and make

144
0:11:26.95,000 --> 0:11:3,000
sense of it for myself

145
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:32,000
we've got makes any sense let's see I've

146
0:11:31.24,000 --> 0:11:34,000
got a couple more a couple locations

147
0:11:32.97,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Limpopo South Africa that's a long way

148
0:11:35.11,000 --> 0:11:38,000
away that's a very long way away Fort

149
0:11:37.24,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Lauderdale Florida Philippines Thailand

150
0:11:38.86,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Poland Costa Rica Copenhagen and Denmark

151
0:11:42.07,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Indonesia this is just wow this is

152
0:11:43.48,000 --> 0:11:46,000
blowing my mind

153
0:11:44.53,000 --> 0:11:48,000
this room is quite small and I'm quite

154
0:11:46.99,000 --> 0:11:51,000
small but there's also people listening

155
0:11:49.3,000 --> 0:11:53,000
it's why it's very nice I'm gonna play a

156
0:11:52.15,000 --> 0:11:55,000
song called hideaway so I've spent the

157
0:11:53.89,000 --> 0:11:56,000
last couple of years making four albums

158
0:11:55.84,000 --> 0:12:,000
because I just can't I can't help myself

159
0:11:57.52,000 --> 0:12:02,000
it's called Jesse DJ esse that's that's

160
0:12:01.27,000 --> 0:12:04,000
the sort of quadruple album and each arm

161
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
is like a different universe like a

162
0:12:04.84,000 --> 0:12:08,000
different musical space I suppose and

163
0:12:07.36,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that the two songs are just playable

164
0:12:09.25,000 --> 0:12:12,000
from Jesse vol 2 which is quite cosy an

165
0:12:11.59,000 --> 0:12:13,000
acoustic feeling

166
0:12:12.85,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Jesse vol 1 it's like an orchestral

167
0:12:14.14,000 --> 0:12:18,000
record it's really broadened and sort of

168
0:12:16.48,000 --> 0:12:19,000
glorious and the album was some sort of

169
0:12:19.06,000 --> 0:12:22,000
currently finish off is called Jesse vol

170
0:12:20.32,000 --> 0:12:23,000
3 which is extremely wild and electronic

171
0:12:22.66,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and groovy and hip-hop and R&B and soul

172
0:12:24.28,000 --> 0:12:27,000

this very room kind of about this very

242

room actually this is kind of my

hideaway it's like a little treasure

0:21:47.08,000 --> 0:21:5,000
trove I have in my family home where I

245
0:21:49.929,000 --> 0:21:51,000
guess many of us is spending time

246
0:21:50.919,000 --> 0:21:53,000
nowadays I've just been notified that

247

248
0:21:54.49,000 --> 0:21:59,000
really really cool if you're just tuning

249
0:21:56.679,000 --> 0:22:03,000
in welcome to my humble abode and to the

250
0:21:59.98,000 --> 0:22:04,000
glorious world of Ted and I've played

251
0:22:04.21,000 --> 0:22:06,000
three songs so far there are two more

252
0:22:05.44,000 --> 0:22:08,000
songs to go the next song is rather

253
0:22:06.97,000 --> 0:22:11,000
exciting because I've never ever played

254
0:22:09.01,000 --> 0:22:15,000
this song before ever to anybody I'm a

255
0:22:12.88,000 --> 0:22:16,000
master procrastinator down about you I'm

256
0:22:15.01,000 --> 0:22:19,000
very good at procrastinating and in in

257
0:22:17.649,000 --> 0:22:2,000
procrastination for finishing this album

258
0:22:19.72,000 --> 0:22:21,000
I'm currently working on called Jessie

259
0:22:20.74,000 --> 0:22:24,000
vol 3 which will come out soon I promise

260
0:22:22.33,000 --> 0:22:26,000
you I wrote a song last week and no one

261
0:22:25.48,000 --> 0:22:27,000
knows I haven't even told my friends

262
0:22:26.98,000 --> 0:22:28,000
about this this is just really just you

263
0:22:28.24,000 --> 0:22:32,000
guys have putting this in the first time

264
0:22:29.77,000 --> 0:22:34,000
and it's a song that is there is a bit

265
0:22:33.01,000 --> 0:22:37,000
it was a bit of an escape from the thing

266
0:22:35.35,000 --> 0:22:38,000
I was doing but I quite liked it and I

267
0:22:37.33,000 --> 0:22:39,000
just thought why not I play it today

268
0:22:38.409,000 --> 0:22:43,000
because I like it want to do something

269
0:22:39.85,000 --> 0:22:43,000
for the first time live and I like doing

270
0:22:43.419,000 --> 0:22:46,000
that in concerts but seeing as there are

271
0:22:44.62,000 --> 0:22:48,000
no concerts nowadays it's nice to do it

272
0:22:46.75,000 --> 0:22:5,000
right here from hope so this is a brand

273
0:22:49.539,000 --> 0:22:53,000
new song literally world premiere of

274
0:22:51.309,000 --> 0:22:55,000

275
0:22:53.86,000 --> 0:22:57,000

308
0:25:20.74,000 --> 0:25:24,000
we have a little bit of time remaining

309
0:25:23.309,000 --> 0:25:26,000
libertine remaining hope that the

310
0:25:25.72,000 --> 0:25:3,000
connections cause is that the Internet

311
0:25:27.19,000 --> 0:25:35,000
is dropping out one second

0:25:30.72,000 --> 0:25:35,000

if you can see me were just holding

315
0:25:55.649,000 --> 0:26:51,000
while the internet figures herself out

0:25:58.02,000 --> 0:26:52,000
[Music]

317
0:26:55.8,000 --> 0:27:25,000

320
0:27:27.39,000 --> 0:27:31,000
little bit shaky I apologize for that I

321
0:27:30.21,000 --> 0:27:33,000
have one more song if you'd like to

322
0:27:31.56,000 --> 0:27:35,000
stick around please do this is a song

323
0:27:33.72,000 --> 0:27:37,000
that you may know it's one of my most

324
0:27:35.67,000 --> 0:27:39,000
favorite songs in the world and it's a

325
0:27:37.86,000 --> 0:27:41,000
very old song and it's called Danny Boy

326
0:27:40.26,000 --> 0:27:44,000
it's a folk song Danny Boy and I figured

327
0:27:42.81,000 --> 0:27:45,000
that since it's one of my most favourite

328
0:27:44.43,000 --> 0:27:47,000
songs I would finish today by playing

329
0:27:46.53,000 --> 0:27:48,000
Danny Boyd for you if you're still

330
0:27:47.64,000 --> 0:27:5,000
around that's fantastic

331
0:27:49.29,000 --> 0:27:57,000
trying to tell what key to play Danny

thank you very much that was Danny Boy

380
0:36:17.41,000 --> 0:36:21,000
one of my most favorite songs and I've

381
0:36:20.089,000 --> 0:36:22,000
never played like that before I kind of

382
0:36:21.41,000 --> 0:36:24,000
kind of improvised in the middle I

383
0:36:22.91,000 --> 0:36:26,000
wasn't expecting that but I went through

384
0:36:25.309,000 --> 0:36:27,000
some keys and we ended up in a major for

385
0:36:27.38,000 --> 0:36:3,000
those of you who are asking in the

386
0:36:28.279,000 --> 0:36:33,000
comments a major so we moved down a

387
0:36:30.74,000 --> 0:36:35,000
minor third that concludes today's

388
0:36:33.95,000 --> 0:36:36,000
little concert from home it's so so nice

389
0:36:36.589,000 --> 0:36:4,000
to see you it's nice to meet some of you

390
0:36:37.94,000 --> 0:36:41,000
nice to see some of you again my name is

391
0:36:40.609,000 --> 0:36:43,000
jacob collier if you're just tuning in

392
0:36:42.17,000 --> 0:36:45,000
now I apologize for the fact that this

393
0:36:44.45,000 --> 0:36:48,000
is over but you can go back and re-watch

394
0:36:46.069,000 --> 0:36:49,000
it on Ted's page after this from

395
0:36:48.589,000 --> 0:36:52,000
wherever you are in the world

396
0:36:49.73,000 --> 0:36:53,000
I'm sending you lots of love I'm sending

397
0:36:52.67,000 --> 0:36:56,000
you a reminder that we're one family the

398
0:36:54.71,000 --> 0:36:58,000
human being race is a family and we will

399
0:36:57.529,000 --> 0:37:,000
come through this we've come through

400
0:36:58.73,000 --> 0:37:01,000
greater challenges in this and if we

401
0:37:00.89,000 --> 0:37:03,000
continue to make music have

402
0:37:02.42,000 --> 0:37:07,000
conversations keep our doors open so to

403
0:37:04.7,000 --> 0:37:08,000
speak with each other I think that we

404
0:37:08.029,000 --> 0:37:12,000
will emerge from this stronger than ever

405
0:37:09.23,000 --> 0:37:15,000
before in the meantime stay at home if

406
0:37:12.859,000 --> 0:37:17,000
you can stay safe give each other love

407
0:37:15.92,000 --> 0:37:19,000
and it's absolutely wonderful to spend

408
0:37:18.829,000 --> 0:37:22,000
half an hour with you I'll see you again

409
0:37:19.94,000 --> 0:37:22,000
sometime see you very soon

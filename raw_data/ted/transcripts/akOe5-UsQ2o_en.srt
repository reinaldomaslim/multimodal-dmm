1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I'd like to try something new.

2
0:00:15.2,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Those of you who are able,

3
0:00:16.76,000 --> 0:00:17,000
please stand up.

4
0:00:20.48,000 --> 0:00:23,000
OK, so I'm going to name some names.

5
0:00:24.08,000 --> 0:00:26,000
When you hear a name that you don't recognize,

6
0:00:26.48,000 --> 0:00:27,000
you can't tell me anything about them,

7
0:00:28.36,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'd like you to take a seat

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and stay seated.

9
0:00:32.24,000 --> 0:00:35,000
The last person standing, we're going to see what they know. OK?

10
0:00:35.88,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:37.48,000 --> 0:00:38,000
All right.

12
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Eric Garner.

13
0:00:42.48,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Mike Brown.

14
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Tamir Rice.

15
0:00:51.76,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Freddie Gray.

16
0:00:56.24,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So those of you who are still standing,

17
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
I'd like you to turn around and take a look.

18
0:01:00.28,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I'd say half to most of the people are still standing.

19
0:01:04.92,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So let's continue.

20
0:01:07.64,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Michelle Cusseaux.

21
0:01:15.72,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Tanisha Anderson.

22
0:01:22.4,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Aura Rosser.

23
0:01:27.56,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Meagan Hockaday.

24
0:01:30.76,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So if we look around again,

25
0:01:32.24,000 --> 0:01:35,000
there are about four people still standing,

26
0:01:35.28,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and actually I'm not going to put you on the spot.

27
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I just say that to encourage transparency, so you can be seated.

28
0:01:41.6,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:44.56,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So those of you who recognized the first group of names know

30
0:01:47.8,000 --> 0:01:5,000
that these were African-Americans who have been killed by the police

31
0:01:51.72,000 --> 0:01:53,000
over the last two and a half years.

32
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
What you may not know

33
0:01:56.44,000 --> 0:02:01,000
is that the other list is also African-Americans

34
0:02:01.88,000 --> 0:02:05,000
who have been killed within the last two years.

35
0:02:07.68,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Only one thing distinguishes the names that you know

36
0:02:11.68,000 --> 0:02:12,000
from the names that you don't know:

37
0:02:14.32,000 --> 0:02:15,000
gender.

38
0:02:16.72,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So let me first let you know that there's nothing at all distinct

39
0:02:22.56,000 --> 0:02:23,000
about this audience

40
0:02:24.36,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that explains the pattern of recognition that we've just seen.

41
0:02:28.2,000 --> 0:02:32,000
I've done this exercise dozens of times around the country.

42
0:02:32.72,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I've done it to women's rights organizations.

43
0:02:35.32,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I've done it with civil rights groups.

44
0:02:37.48,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I've done it with professors. I've done it with students.

45
0:02:40.48,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I've done it with psychologists. I've done it with sociologists.

46
0:02:44.76,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I've done it even with progressive members of Congress.

47
0:02:48.28,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And everywhere, the awareness of the level of police violence

48
0:02:52.6,000 --> 0:02:53,000
that black women experience

49
0:02:54.52,000 --> 0:02:56,000
is exceedingly low.

50
0:02:57.6,000 --> 0:03:,000
Now, it is surprising, isn't it, that this would be the case.

51
0:03:01.2,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I mean, there are two issues involved here.

52
0:03:03.24,000 --> 0:03:06,000
There's police violence against African-Americans,

53
0:03:06.36,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and there's violence against women,

54
0:03:08.44,000 --> 0:03:1,000
two issues that have been talked about a lot lately.

55
0:03:12.12,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But when we think about who is implicated by these problems,

56
0:03:18.12,000 --> 0:03:21,000
when we think about who is victimized by these problems,

57
0:03:21.64,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the names of these black women never come to mind.

58
0:03:25.68,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Now, communications experts tell us

59
0:03:28.44,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that when facts do not fit with the available frames,

60
0:03:32.92,000 --> 0:03:35,000
people have a difficult time incorporating new facts

61
0:03:36.68,000 --> 0:03:39,000
into their way of thinking about a problem.

62
0:03:41.04,000 --> 0:03:44,000
These women's names have slipped through our consciousness

63
0:03:44.36,000 --> 0:03:47,000
because there are no frames for us to see them,

64
0:03:47.8,000 --> 0:03:49,000
no frames for us to remember them,

65
0:03:50.12,000 --> 0:03:51,000
no frames for us to hold them.

66
0:03:53.48,000 --> 0:03:54,000
As a consequence,

67
0:03:55.72,000 --> 0:03:56,000
reporters don't lead with them,

68
0:03:58.32,000 --> 0:04:01,000
policymakers don't think about them,

69
0:04:01.4,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and politicians aren't encouraged or demanded that they speak to them.

70
0:04:07.8,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now, you might ask,

71
0:04:09.44,000 --> 0:04:1,000
why does a frame matter?

72
0:04:11.04,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I mean, after all,

73
0:04:12.88,000 --> 0:04:17,000
an issue that affects black people and an issue that affects women,

74
0:04:18.2,000 --> 0:04:22,000
wouldn't that necessarily include black people who are women

75
0:04:22.28,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and women who are black people?

76
0:04:25.52,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Well, the simple answer is that this is a trickle-down approach to social justice,

77
0:04:30.8,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and many times it just doesn't work.

78
0:04:34.28,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Without frames that allow us to see

79
0:04:36.8,000 --> 0:04:4,000
how social problems impact all the members of a targeted group,

80
0:04:41.56,000 --> 0:04:44,000
many will fall through the cracks of our movements,

81
0:04:44.8,000 --> 0:04:47,000
left to suffer in virtual isolation.

82
0:04:49.36,000 --> 0:04:52,000
But it doesn't have to be this way.

83
0:04:54.08,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Many years ago, I began to use the term "intersectionality"

84
0:04:59.24,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to deal with the fact that many of our social justice problems

85
0:05:03.36,000 --> 0:05:04,000
like racism and sexism

86
0:05:05.28,000 --> 0:05:07,000
are often overlapping,

87
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:12,000
creating multiple levels of social injustice.

88
0:05:13.24,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Now, the experience that gave rise to intersectionality

89
0:05:18.44,000 --> 0:05:22,000
was my chance encounter with a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid.

90
0:05:24.24,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Emma DeGraffenreid was an African-American woman,

91
0:05:28.08,000 --> 0:05:3,000
a working wife and a mother.

92
0:05:30.8,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I actually read about Emma's story from the pages of a legal opinion

93
0:05:36.24,000 --> 0:05:4,000
written by a judge who had dismissed Emma's claim

94
0:05:40.4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
of race and gender discrimination

95
0:05:42.52,000 --> 0:05:46,000
against a local car manufacturing plant.

96
0:05:47.44,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Emma, like so many African-American women,

97
0:05:51.2,000 --> 0:05:54,000
sought better employment for her family and for others.

98
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:59,000
She wanted to create a better life for her children and for her family.

99
0:05:59.44,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But she applied for a job,

100
0:06:01.68,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and she was not hired,

101
0:06:03.4,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and she believed that she was not hired because she was a black woman.

102
0:06:07.8,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Now, the judge in question dismissed Emma's suit,

103
0:06:12.44,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and the argument for dismissing the suit was

104
0:06:15.04,000 --> 0:06:19,000
that the employer did hire African-Americans

105
0:06:19.4,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and the employer hired women.

106
0:06:23.36,000 --> 0:06:27,000
The real problem, though, that the judge was not willing to acknowledge

107
0:06:27.44,000 --> 0:06:3,000
was what Emma was actually trying to say,

108
0:06:30.64,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that the African-Americans that were hired,

109
0:06:33.56,000 --> 0:06:37,000
usually for industrial jobs, maintenance jobs, were all men.

110
0:06:39.32,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And the women that were hired,

111
0:06:41.24,000 --> 0:06:44,000
usually for secretarial or front-office work,

112
0:06:44.88,000 --> 0:06:45,000
were all white.

113
0:06:46.84,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Only if the court was able to see how these policies came together

114
0:06:51.48,000 --> 0:06:54,000
would he be able to see the double discrimination

115
0:06:55.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing.

116
0:06:58.96,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But the court refused to allow Emma to put two causes of action together

117
0:07:04.48,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to tell her story

118
0:07:05.88,000 --> 0:07:08,000
because he believed that, by allowing her to do that,

119
0:07:09.84,000 --> 0:07:12,000
she would be able to have preferential treatment.

120
0:07:13.8,000 --> 0:07:18,000
She would have an advantage by having two swings at the bat,

121
0:07:19.04,000 --> 0:07:23,000
when African-American men and white women only had one swing at the bat.

122
0:07:24.36,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But of course, neither African-American men or white women

123
0:07:29.48,000 --> 0:07:33,000
needed to combine a race and gender discrimination claim

124
0:07:34.08,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to tell the story of the discrimination they were experiencing.

125
0:07:39.28,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Why wasn't the real unfairness

126
0:07:42.52,000 --> 0:07:46,000
law's refusal to protect African-American women

127
0:07:46.68,000 --> 0:07:5,000
simply because their experiences weren't exactly the same

128
0:07:50.8,000 --> 0:07:53,000
as white women and African-American men?

129
0:07:55.28,000 --> 0:08:,000
Rather than broadening the frame to include African-American women,

130
0:08:00.56,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the court simply tossed their case completely out of court.

131
0:08:06.08,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Now, as a student of antidiscrimination law,

132
0:08:10.08,000 --> 0:08:11,000
as a feminist,

133
0:08:11.56,000 --> 0:08:13,000
as an antiracist,

134
0:08:13.96,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I was struck by this case.

135
0:08:17.2,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It felt to me like injustice squared.

136
0:08:21.88,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So first of all,

137
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:26,000
black women weren't allowed to work at the plant.

138
0:08:27.52,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Second of all, the court doubled down on this exclusion

139
0:08:31.64,000 --> 0:08:34,000
by making it legally inconsequential.

140
0:08:35.48,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And to boot, there was no name for this problem.

141
0:08:39.6,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And we all know that, where there's no name for a problem,

142
0:08:43.12,000 --> 0:08:44,000
you can't see a problem,

143
0:08:44.4,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and when you can't see a problem, you pretty much can't solve it.

144
0:08:50.159,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Many years later, I had come to recognize

145
0:08:52.799,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that the problem that Emma was facing was a framing problem.

146
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
The frame that the court was using

147
0:09:01.12,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to see gender discrimination or to see race discrimination

148
0:09:06.12,000 --> 0:09:08,000
was partial, and it was distorting.

149
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:12,000
For me, the challenge that I faced was

150
0:09:12.8,000 --> 0:09:16,000
trying to figure out whether there was an alternative narrative,

151
0:09:17.64,000 --> 0:09:21,000
a prism that would allow us to see Emma's dilemma,

152
0:09:22.36,000 --> 0:09:27,000
a prism that would allow us to rescue her from the cracks in the law,

153
0:09:28.32,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that would allow judges to see her story.

154
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:34,000
So it occurred to me,

155
0:09:34.92,000 --> 0:09:39,000
maybe a simple analogy to an intersection

156
0:09:39.96,000 --> 0:09:43,000
might allow judges to better see Emma's dilemma.

157
0:09:44.84,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So if we think about this intersection, the roads to the intersection would be

158
0:09:49.72,000 --> 0:09:54,000
the way that the workforce was structured by race and by gender.

159
0:09:56.48,000 --> 0:10:,000
And then the traffic in those roads would be the hiring policies

160
0:10:00.88,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and the other practices that ran through those roads.

161
0:10:05.44,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Now, because Emma was both black and female,

162
0:10:10.4,000 --> 0:10:14,000
she was positioned precisely where those roads overlapped,

163
0:10:15.76,000 --> 0:10:19,000
experiencing the simultaneous impact

164
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
of the company's gender and race traffic.

165
0:10:25.4,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The law -- the law is like that ambulance that shows up

166
0:10:31.2,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and is ready to treat Emma only if it can be shown

167
0:10:34.64,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that she was harmed on the race road or on the gender road

168
0:10:39.28,000 --> 0:10:42,000
but not where those roads intersected.

169
0:10:43.92,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So what do you call being impacted by multiple forces

170
0:10:49.2,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and then abandoned to fend for yourself?

171
0:10:53.72,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Intersectionality seemed to do it for me.

172
0:10:58.12,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I would go on to learn that African-American women,

173
0:11:02.8,000 --> 0:11:03,000
like other women of color,

174
0:11:04.76,000 --> 0:11:08,000
like other socially marginalized people all over the world,

175
0:11:08.84,000 --> 0:11:11,000
were facing all kinds of dilemmas and challenges

176
0:11:12.84,000 --> 0:11:15,000
as a consequence of intersectionality,

177
0:11:15.96,000 --> 0:11:18,000
intersections of race and gender,

178
0:11:19.56,000 --> 0:11:24,000
of heterosexism, transphobia, xenophobia, ableism,

179
0:11:24.8,000 --> 0:11:28,000
all of these social dynamics come together

180
0:11:29.4,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and create challenges that are sometimes quite unique.

181
0:11:35.04,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But in the same way

182
0:11:36.88,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that intersectionality

183
0:11:39.2,000 --> 0:11:44,000
raised our awareness to the way that black women live their lives,

184
0:11:45.28,000 --> 0:11:49,000
it also exposes the tragic circumstances

185
0:11:49.44,000 --> 0:11:52,000
under which African-American women die.

186
0:11:54.24,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Police violence against black women

187
0:11:58.12,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is very real.

188
0:12:00.08,000 --> 0:12:02,000
The level of violence that black women face

189
0:12:02.6,000 --> 0:12:04,000
is such that it's not surprising

190
0:12:05.64,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that some of them do not survive their encounters with police.

191
0:12:11.2,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Black girls as young as seven,

192
0:12:14.68,000 --> 0:12:17,000
great grandmothers as old as 95

193
0:12:19.52,000 --> 0:12:2,000
have been killed by the police.

194
0:12:21.96,000 --> 0:12:23,000
They've been killed in their living rooms,

195
0:12:24.76,000 --> 0:12:25,000
in their bedrooms.

196
0:12:26.8,000 --> 0:12:27,000
They've been killed in their cars.

197
0:12:29.8,000 --> 0:12:3,000
They've been killed on the street.

198
0:12:31.76,000 --> 0:12:33,000
They've been killed in front of their parents

199
0:12:34.64,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and they've been killed in front of their children.

200
0:12:38.12,000 --> 0:12:39,000
They have been shot to death.

201
0:12:41.08,000 --> 0:12:42,000
They have been stomped to death.

202
0:12:43.96,000 --> 0:12:44,000
They have been suffocated to death.

203
0:12:46.56,000 --> 0:12:48,000
They have been manhandled to death.

204
0:12:49.52,000 --> 0:12:51,000
They have been tasered to death.

205
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
They've been killed when they've called for help.

206
0:12:57.56,000 --> 0:13:,000
They've been killed when they were alone,

207
0:13:00.68,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and they've been killed when they were with others.

208
0:13:04.88,000 --> 0:13:06,000
They've been killed shopping while black,

209
0:13:08.52,000 --> 0:13:09,000
driving while black,

210
0:13:11.4,000 --> 0:13:14,000
having a mental disability while black,

211
0:13:15.12,000 --> 0:13:17,000
having a domestic disturbance while black.

212
0:13:19.2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
They've even been killed being homeless while black.

213
0:13:24.2,000 --> 0:13:26,000
They've been killed talking on the cell phone,

214
0:13:26.84,000 --> 0:13:28,000
laughing with friends,

215
0:13:29.24,000 --> 0:13:32,000
sitting in a car reported as stolen

216
0:13:32.32,000 --> 0:13:35,000
and making a U-turn in front of the White House

217
0:13:35.96,000 --> 0:13:37,000
with an infant strapped in the backseat of the car.

218
0:13:40.04,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Why don't we know these stories?

219
0:13:44.64,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Why is it that their lost lives

220
0:13:48.44,000 --> 0:13:52,000
don't generate the same amount of media attention and communal outcry

221
0:13:53.2,000 --> 0:13:56,000
as the lost lives of their fallen brothers?

222
0:13:57.8,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It's time for a change.

223
0:14:03.04,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So what can we do?

224
0:14:06.8,000 --> 0:14:11,000
In 2014, the African-American Policy Forum began to demand

225
0:14:12.2,000 --> 0:14:14,000
that we "say her name"

226
0:14:16.36,000 --> 0:14:18,000
at rallies, at protests,

227
0:14:19.96,000 --> 0:14:21,000
at conferences, at meetings,

228
0:14:22.64,000 --> 0:14:24,000
anywhere and everywhere

229
0:14:25.28,000 --> 0:14:29,000
that state violence against black bodies is being discussed.

230
0:14:30.8,000 --> 0:14:32,000
But saying her name is not enough.

231
0:14:33.48,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We have to be willing to do more.

232
0:14:36.08,000 --> 0:14:39,000
We have to be willing to bear witness,

233
0:14:39.32,000 --> 0:14:42,000
to bear witness to the often painful realities

234
0:14:42.96,000 --> 0:14:44,000
that we would just rather not confront,

235
0:14:45.72,000 --> 0:14:51,000
the everyday violence and humiliation that many black women have had to face,

236
0:14:52.2,000 --> 0:14:54,000
black women across color,

237
0:14:54.6,000 --> 0:14:56,000
age, gender expression,

238
0:14:57.04,000 --> 0:14:59,000
sexuality and ability.

239
0:15:01.04,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So we have the opportunity right now --

240
0:15:05.24,000 --> 0:15:09,000
bearing in mind that some of the images that I'm about to share with you

241
0:15:09.28,000 --> 0:15:1,000
may be triggering for some --

242
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:16,000
to collectively bear witness to some of this violence.

243
0:15:18.12,000 --> 0:15:22,000
We're going to hear the voice of the phenomenal Abby Dobson.

244
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And as we sit with these women,

245
0:15:26.76,000 --> 0:15:31,000
some who have experienced violence and some who have not survived them,

246
0:15:33.28,000 --> 0:15:34,000
we have an opportunity

247
0:15:34.92,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to reverse what happened at the beginning of this talk,

248
0:15:38.68,000 --> 0:15:4,000
when we could not stand for these women

249
0:15:41.4,000 --> 0:15:44,000
because we did not know their names.

250
0:15:45.64,000 --> 0:15:48,000
So at the end of this clip, there's going to be a roll call.

251
0:15:50.56,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Several black women's names will come up.

252
0:15:54.8,000 --> 0:15:58,000
I'd like those of you who are able to join us in saying these names

253
0:15:59.76,000 --> 0:16:01,000
as loud as you can,

254
0:16:02.16,000 --> 0:16:04,000
randomly, disorderly.

255
0:16:04.92,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Let's create a cacophony of sound

256
0:16:08.6,000 --> 0:16:1,000
to represent our intention

257
0:16:11.48,000 --> 0:16:13,000
to hold these women up,

258
0:16:14.32,000 --> 0:16:15,000
to sit with them,

259
0:16:15.96,000 --> 0:16:16,000
to bear witness to them,

260
0:16:18.64,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to bring them into the light.

261
0:16:28.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
(Singing) Abby Dobson: Say,

262
0:16:35.36,000 --> 0:16:41,000
say her name.

263
0:16:42.64,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Say,

264
0:16:50.08,000 --> 0:16:54,000
say her name.

265
0:16:54.28,000 --> 0:16:55,000
(Audience) Shelly!

266
0:16:56.6,000 --> 0:16:57,000
(Audience) Kayla!

267
0:16:57.84,000 --> 0:17:03,000
AD: Oh,

268
0:17:05.68,000 --> 0:17:11,000
say her name.

269
0:17:11.88,000 --> 0:17:13,000
(Audience shouting names)

270
0:17:14.44,000 --> 0:17:2,000
Say, say,

271
0:17:21.76,000 --> 0:17:26,000
say her name.

272
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Say her name.

273
0:17:34.68,000 --> 0:17:36,000
For all the names

274
0:17:37.56,000 --> 0:17:42,000
I'll never know,

275
0:17:44.68,000 --> 0:17:47,000
say her name.

276
0:17:47.8,000 --> 0:17:49,000
KC: Aiyanna Stanley Jones, Janisha Fonville,

277
0:17:50.6,000 --> 0:17:52,000
Kathryn Johnston, Kayla Moore,

278
0:17:52.96,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Michelle Cusseaux, Rekia Boyd,

279
0:17:55.84,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Shelly Frey, Tarika, Yvette Smith.

280
0:18:00.88,000 --> 0:18:06,000
AD: Say her name.

281
0:18:11.04,000 --> 0:18:13,000
KC: So I said at the beginning,

282
0:18:13.92,000 --> 0:18:15,000
if we can't see a problem,

283
0:18:17.8,000 --> 0:18:18,000
we can't fix a problem.

284
0:18:20.56,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Together, we've come together to bear witness

285
0:18:24,000 --> 0:18:26,000
to these women's lost lives.

286
0:18:27.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
But the time now is to move

287
0:18:29.64,000 --> 0:18:31,000
from mourning and grief

288
0:18:32.16,000 --> 0:18:34,000
to action and transformation.

289
0:18:36.12,000 --> 0:18:38,000
This is something that we can do.

290
0:18:39.44,000 --> 0:18:4,000
It's up to us.

291
0:18:42.84,000 --> 0:18:43,000
Thank you for joining us.

292
0:18:44.76,000 --> 0:18:45,000
Thank you.

293
0:18:46,000 --> 0:18:48,000
(Applause)

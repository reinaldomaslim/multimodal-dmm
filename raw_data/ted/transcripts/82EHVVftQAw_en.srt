1
0:00:12.613,000 --> 0:00:16,000
As a kid, I was fascinated with all things air and space.

2
0:00:17.051,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I would watch Nova on PBS.

3
0:00:19.592,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy.

4
0:00:22.545,000 --> 0:00:26,000
When I was in elementary school, my next door neighbor,

5
0:00:26.67,000 --> 0:00:27,000
he gave me a book for my birthday.

6
0:00:28.52,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It was an astronomy book,

7
0:00:29.689,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and I poured over that thing for hours on end,

8
0:00:32.641,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and it was a combination of all these things

9
0:00:35.241,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that inspired me to pursue space exploration

10
0:00:38.909,000 --> 0:00:42,000
as my own personal dream, and part of that dream was,

11
0:00:43.377,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I always wanted to just fly around the solar system

12
0:00:45.986,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft.

13
0:00:49.383,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Well, a number of years later, I graduated from UCLA

14
0:00:54.077,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and I found myself at NASA,

15
0:00:56.259,000 --> 0:00:58,000
working for the jet propulsion laboratory,

16
0:00:58.363,000 --> 0:01:,000
and there our team was challenged

17
0:01:01.058,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to create a 3D visualization of the solar system,

18
0:01:05.447,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and today I want to show you what we've done so far.

19
0:01:09.321,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Now, the kicker is, everything I'm about to do here

20
0:01:12.707,000 --> 0:01:15,000
you can do at home, because we built this

21
0:01:16.513,000 --> 0:01:18,000
for the public for you guys to use.

22
0:01:19.323,000 --> 0:01:2,000
So what you're looking at right now is the Earth.

23
0:01:21.244,000 --> 0:01:22,000
You can see the United States and California

24
0:01:23.215,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and San Diego, and you can use the mouse

25
0:01:25.994,000 --> 0:01:27,000
or the keyboard to spin things around.

26
0:01:28.049,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now, this isn't new. Anyone who's used Google Earth

27
0:01:31.488,000 --> 0:01:34,000
has seen this before, but one thing we like to say

28
0:01:34.499,000 --> 0:01:37,000
in our group is, we do the opposite of Google Earth.

29
0:01:38.312,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard.

30
0:01:42.361,000 --> 0:01:45,000
We go from this view out to the stars.

31
0:01:45.894,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So the Earth is cool, but what we really want to show

32
0:01:48.821,000 --> 0:01:49,000
are the spacecraft,

33
0:01:50.687,000 --> 0:01:52,000
so I'm going to bring the interface back up,

34
0:01:53.432,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and now you're looking at a number of satellites

35
0:01:56.154,000 --> 0:01:56,000
orbiting the Earth.

36
0:01:57.091,000 --> 0:02:,000
These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters.

37
0:02:00.373,000 --> 0:02:02,000
We haven't included military satellites and weather satellites

38
0:02:02.691,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites.

39
0:02:04.704,000 --> 0:02:06,000
If we did, it would be a complete mess,

40
0:02:07.203,000 --> 0:02:09,000
because there's a lot of stuff out there.

41
0:02:09.259,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And the cool thing is, we actually created 3D models

42
0:02:13.064,000 --> 0:02:16,000
for a number of these spacecraft, so if you want to visit

43
0:02:16.329,000 --> 0:02:19,000
any of these, all you need to do is double-click on them.

44
0:02:19.355,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So I'm going to find the International Space Station,

45
0:02:22.591,000 --> 0:02:27,000
double-click, and it will take us all the way down to the ISS.

46
0:02:27.598,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And now you're riding along with the ISS

47
0:02:30.207,000 --> 0:02:33,000
where it is right now.

48
0:02:33.402,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And the other cool thing is, not only can we

49
0:02:35.194,000 --> 0:02:38,000
move the camera around, we can also control time,

50
0:02:38.469,000 --> 0:02:4,000
so I can slide this jog dial here

51
0:02:40.582,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to shuttle time forward, and now

52
0:02:42.877,000 --> 0:02:46,000
we can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like,

53
0:02:47.31,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and they get one every 90 minutes. (Laughter)

54
0:02:52.763,000 --> 0:02:54,000
All right, so what about the rest of it?

55
0:02:55.346,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Well, I can click on this home button over here,

56
0:02:57.987,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and that will take us up to the inner solar system,

57
0:03:00.954,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and now we're looking at the rest of the solar system.

58
0:03:03.081,000 --> 0:03:05,000
You can see, there's Saturn, there's Jupiter,

59
0:03:05.624,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and while we're here, I want to point out something.

60
0:03:08.74,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's actually pretty busy.

61
0:03:11.297,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory

62
0:03:13.386,000 --> 0:03:15,000
on its way to Mars, just launched last weekend.

63
0:03:15.929,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter, there.

64
0:03:19.911,000 --> 0:03:2,000
We have Dawn orbiting Vesta,

65
0:03:21.873,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and we have over here New Horizons

66
0:03:23.883,000 --> 0:03:25,000
on a straight shot to Pluto.

67
0:03:26.341,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And I mention this because

68
0:03:28.296,000 --> 0:03:3,000
there's this strange public perception that

69
0:03:31.101,000 --> 0:03:33,000
NASA's dead, that the space shuttles stopped flying

70
0:03:33.894,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and all of the sudden there's no more spacecraft out there.

71
0:03:36.478,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Well, a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration,

72
0:03:41.057,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and we have a lot of spacecraft out there.

73
0:03:43.656,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Granted, we're not sending humans up at the moment,

74
0:03:45.929,000 --> 0:03:47,000
well at least with our own launch vehicles,

75
0:03:48.736,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but NASA is far from dead,

76
0:03:50.98,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and one of the reasons why we write a program like this

77
0:03:54.31,000 --> 0:03:56,000
is so that people realize that there's so many other things

78
0:03:56.797,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that we're doing.

79
0:03:58.488,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Anyway, while we're here, again,

80
0:04:00.21,000 --> 0:04:01,000
if you want to visit anything,

81
0:04:02.14,000 --> 0:04:03,000
all you need to do is double-click.

82
0:04:04.057,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So I'm just going to double-click on Vesta,

83
0:04:06.627,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta,

84
0:04:10.721,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and this is happening right now.

85
0:04:12.911,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I'm going to double-click on Uranus, and we can see

86
0:04:17.118,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons.

87
0:04:20.426,000 --> 0:04:23,000
You can see how it's tilted at about 89 degrees.

88
0:04:24.218,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And just being able to visit different places

89
0:04:28.178,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and go through different times,

90
0:04:29.464,000 --> 0:04:32,000
we have data from 1950 to 2050.

91
0:04:32.559,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Granted, we don't have everything in between,

92
0:04:34.776,000 --> 0:04:35,000
because some of the data is hard to get.

93
0:04:36.542,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Just being able to visit places in different times,

94
0:04:40.457,000 --> 0:04:43,000
you can explore this for hours,

95
0:04:44.125,000 --> 0:04:45,000
literally hours on end,

96
0:04:46.081,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but I want to show you one thing in particular,

97
0:04:48.959,000 --> 0:04:5,000
so I'm going to open up the destination tab,

98
0:04:51.344,000 --> 0:04:54,000
spacecraft outer planet missions, Voyager 1,

99
0:04:54.731,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and I'm going to bring up the Titan flyby.

100
0:04:57.731,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So now we've gone back in time.

101
0:05:00.521,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We're now riding along with Voyager 1.

102
0:05:03.458,000 --> 0:05:06,000
The date here is November 11, 1980.

103
0:05:06.855,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now, there's a funny thing going on here.

104
0:05:09.184,000 --> 0:05:11,000
It doesn't look like anything's going on.

105
0:05:11.377,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It looks like I've paused the program.

106
0:05:13.477,000 --> 0:05:15,000
It's actually running at real rate right now,

107
0:05:15.503,000 --> 0:05:17,000
one second per second, and in fact,

108
0:05:17.503,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at

109
0:05:21.061,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I think it's 38,000 miles per hour.

110
0:05:25.171,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It only looks like nothing's moving because, well,

111
0:05:27.874,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Saturn here is 700,000 miles away,

112
0:05:30.68,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away.

113
0:05:33.522,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It's just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing's happening.

114
0:05:37.607,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But to make it more interesting,

115
0:05:39.485,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I'm going to speed up time, and we can watch

116
0:05:42.331,000 --> 0:05:44,000
as Voyager 1 flies by Titan,

117
0:05:44.986,000 --> 0:05:46,000
which is a hazy moon of Saturn.

118
0:05:47.201,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It actually has a very thick atmosphere.

119
0:05:49.505,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And I'm going to recenter the camera on Saturn, here.

120
0:05:52.766,000 --> 0:05:55,000
I'm going to pull out, and I want to show you

121
0:05:56.655,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Voyager 1 as it flies by Saturn.

122
0:05:59.885,000 --> 0:06:01,000
There's a point to be made here.

123
0:06:02.135,000 --> 0:06:04,000
With a 3D visualization like this,

124
0:06:04.777,000 --> 0:06:07,000
we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn.

125
0:06:08.558,000 --> 0:06:09,000
There's a whole story to tell here.

126
0:06:10.18,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And even better, because it's an interactive application,

127
0:06:13.036,000 --> 0:06:14,000
you can tell the story for yourself.

128
0:06:15.016,000 --> 0:06:17,000
If you want to pause it, you can pause it.

129
0:06:17.221,000 --> 0:06:18,000
If you want to keep going, if you want to change

130
0:06:18.708,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the camera angle, you can do that,

131
0:06:21.032,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and because of that, I can show you

132
0:06:23.555,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that Voyager 1 doesn't just fly by Saturn.

133
0:06:26.376,000 --> 0:06:29,000
It actually flies underneath Saturn.

134
0:06:30.355,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now, what happens is, as it flies underneath Saturn,

135
0:06:33.725,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up

136
0:06:36.636,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and out of the solar system,

137
0:06:38.926,000 --> 0:06:41,000
so if I just keep letting this go,

138
0:06:41.964,000 --> 0:06:45,000
you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that.

139
0:06:46.621,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And, in fact, I'm going to go back to the solar system.

140
0:06:48.753,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I'm going to go back to today, now,

141
0:06:51.661,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and I want to show you where Voyager 1 is.

142
0:06:55.307,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Right there, above, way above the solar system,

143
0:06:59.91,000 --> 0:07:01,000
way beyond our solar system.

144
0:07:02.45,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And here's the thing. Now you know how it got there.

145
0:07:05.037,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now you know why, and to me,

146
0:07:06.665,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that's the point of this program.

147
0:07:08.453,000 --> 0:07:11,000
You can manipulate it yourself.

148
0:07:11.726,000 --> 0:07:14,000
You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself.

149
0:07:15.022,000 --> 0:07:18,000
You know, the theme today is "The World In Your Grasp."

150
0:07:18.513,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Well, we're trying to give you

151
0:07:19.935,000 --> 0:07:2,000
the solar system in your grasp — (Laughter) —

152
0:07:21.532,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and we hope once it's there,

153
0:07:23.081,000 --> 0:07:25,000
you'll be able to learn for yourself

154
0:07:25.334,000 --> 0:07:27,000
what we've done out there, and what we're about to do.

155
0:07:27.528,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And my personal dream is for kids to take this

156
0:07:31.027,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and explore and see the wonders out there

157
0:07:33.712,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and be inspired, as I was as a kid,

158
0:07:36.721,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to pursue STEM education

159
0:07:38.279,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and to pursue a dream in space exploration.

160
0:07:41.029,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Thank you. (Applause)

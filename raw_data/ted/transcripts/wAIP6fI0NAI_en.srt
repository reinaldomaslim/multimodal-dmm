1
0:00:12.112,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In the early days of Twitter, it was like a place of radical de-shaming.

2
0:00:17.463,000 --> 0:00:19,000
People would admit shameful secrets about themselves,

3
0:00:20.435,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and other people would say, "Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."

4
0:00:24.953,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Voiceless people realized that they had a voice,

5
0:00:27.779,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and it was powerful and eloquent.

6
0:00:30.758,000 --> 0:00:34,000
If a newspaper ran some racist or homophobic column,

7
0:00:35.551,000 --> 0:00:37,000
we realized we could do something about it.

8
0:00:37.966,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We could get them.

9
0:00:39.359,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We could hit them with a weapon that we understood but they didn't --

10
0:00:42.835,000 --> 0:00:44,000
a social media shaming.

11
0:00:45.744,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Advertisers would withdraw their advertising.

12
0:00:48.933,000 --> 0:00:51,000
When powerful people misused their privilege,

13
0:00:51.967,000 --> 0:00:52,000
we were going to get them.

14
0:00:54.312,000 --> 0:00:56,000
This was like the democratization of justice.

15
0:00:57.116,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Hierarchies were being leveled out.

16
0:00:59.543,000 --> 0:01:,000
We were going to do things better.

17
0:01:02.755,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Soon after that, a disgraced pop science writer called Jonah Lehrer --

18
0:01:06.988,000 --> 0:01:09,000
he'd been caught plagiarizing and faking quotes,

19
0:01:10.147,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and he was drenched in shame and regret, he told me.

20
0:01:13.903,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And he had the opportunity

21
0:01:15.418,000 --> 0:01:18,000
to publicly apologize at a foundation lunch.

22
0:01:19.272,000 --> 0:01:21,000
This was going to be the most important speech of his life.

23
0:01:22.227,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Maybe it would win him some salvation.

24
0:01:25.114,000 --> 0:01:26,000
He knew before he arrived

25
0:01:26.467,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that the foundation was going to be live-streaming his event,

26
0:01:29.57,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but what he didn't know until he turned up,

27
0:01:31.618,000 --> 0:01:35,000
was that they'd erected a giant screen Twitter feed right next to his head.

28
0:01:36.57,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:38.086,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Another one in a monitor screen in his eye line.

30
0:01:40.653,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I don't think the foundation did this because they were monstrous.

31
0:01:44.113,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I think they were clueless: I think this was a unique moment

32
0:01:47.291,000 --> 0:01:49,000
when the beautiful naivety of Twitter

33
0:01:49.852,000 --> 0:01:52,000
was hitting the increasingly horrific reality.

34
0:01:53.807,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And here were some of the Tweets that were cascading into his eye line,

35
0:01:57.184,000 --> 0:01:58,000
as he was trying to apologize:

36
0:01:58.934,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"Jonah Lehrer, boring us into forgiving him."

37
0:02:02.22,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:03.319,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And, "Jonah Lehrer has not proven that he is capable of feeling shame."

39
0:02:08.589,000 --> 0:02:11,000
That one must have been written by the best psychiatrist ever,

40
0:02:12.304,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to know that about such a tiny figure behind a lectern.

41
0:02:16.135,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And, "Jonah Lehrer is just a frigging sociopath."

42
0:02:19.874,000 --> 0:02:24,000
That last word is a very human thing to do, to dehumanize the people we hurt.

43
0:02:25.298,000 --> 0:02:29,000
It's because we want to destroy people but not feel bad about it.

44
0:02:30.503,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Imagine if this was an actual court,

45
0:02:32.975,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and the accused was in the dark, begging for another chance,

46
0:02:35.825,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and the jury was yelling out,

47
0:02:37.59,000 --> 0:02:39,000
"Bored! Sociopath!"

48
0:02:40.301,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:41.466,000 --> 0:02:44,000
You know, when we watch courtroom dramas, we tend to identify

50
0:02:44.509,000 --> 0:02:46,000
with the kindhearted defense attorney,

51
0:02:47.504,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but give us the power, and we become like hanging judges.

52
0:02:51.846,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Power shifts fast.

53
0:02:54.284,000 --> 0:02:58,000
We were getting Jonah because he was perceived to have misused his privilege,

54
0:02:58.804,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but Jonah was on the floor then, and we were still kicking,

55
0:03:02.111,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and congratulating ourselves for punching up.

56
0:03:05.734,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And it began to feel weird and empty when there wasn't a powerful person

57
0:03:09.957,000 --> 0:03:12,000
who had misused their privilege that we could get.

58
0:03:13.332,000 --> 0:03:16,000
A day without a shaming began to feel like a day

59
0:03:16.658,000 --> 0:03:18,000
picking fingernails and treading water.

60
0:03:21.387,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Let me tell you a story.

61
0:03:23.561,000 --> 0:03:25,000
It's about a woman called Justine Sacco.

62
0:03:26.8,000 --> 0:03:29,000
She was a PR woman from New York with 170 Twitter followers,

63
0:03:30.768,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and she'd Tweet little acerbic jokes to them,

64
0:03:33.748,000 --> 0:03:36,000
like this one on a plane from New York to London:

65
0:03:37.395,000 --> 0:03:4,000
[Weird German Dude: You're in first class. It's 2014. Get some deodorant."

66
0:03:40.93,000 --> 0:03:43,000
-Inner monologue as inhale BO. Thank god for pharmaceuticals.]

67
0:03:44.056,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So Justine chuckled to herself, and pressed send, and got no replies,

68
0:03:47.343,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and felt that sad feeling that we all feel

69
0:03:49.428,000 --> 0:03:52,000
when the Internet doesn't congratulate us for being funny.

70
0:03:53.086,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:54.281,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Black silence when the Internet doesn't talk back.

72
0:03:58.039,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And then she got to Heathrow, and she had a little time to spare

73
0:04:01.206,000 --> 0:04:05,000
before her final leg, so she thought up another funny little acerbic joke:

74
0:04:06.006,000 --> 0:04:1,000
[Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!]

75
0:04:10.352,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And she chuckled to herself, pressed send, got on the plane, got no replies,

76
0:04:16.502,000 --> 0:04:18,000
turned off her phone, fell asleep,

77
0:04:19.109,000 --> 0:04:2,000
woke up 11 hours later,

78
0:04:21.122,000 --> 0:04:24,000
turned on her phone while the plane was taxiing on the runway,

79
0:04:24.74,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and straightaway there was a message from somebody

80
0:04:27.121,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that she hadn't spoken to since high school,

81
0:04:29.241,000 --> 0:04:33,000
that said, "I am so sorry to see what's happening to you."

82
0:04:35.012,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And then another message from a best friend,

83
0:04:37.817,000 --> 0:04:39,000
"You need to call me right now.

84
0:04:39.855,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You are the worldwide number one trending topic on Twitter."

85
0:04:43.892,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:46.254,000 --> 0:04:49,000
What had happened is that one of her 170 followers had sent the Tweet

87
0:04:49.728,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to a Gawker journalist, and he retweeted it to his 15,000 followers:

88
0:04:55.506,000 --> 0:04:57,000
[And now, a funny holiday joke from IAC's PR boss]

89
0:04:57.896,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And then it was like a bolt of lightning.

90
0:04:59.883,000 --> 0:05:01,000
A few weeks later, I talked to the Gawker journalist.

91
0:05:02.409,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I emailed him and asked him how it felt, and he said, "It felt delicious."

92
0:05:06.121,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And then he said, "But I'm sure she's fine."

93
0:05:09.65,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But she wasn't fine, because while she slept,

94
0:05:12.785,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Twitter took control of her life and dismantled it piece by piece.

95
0:05:19.147,000 --> 0:05:21,000
First there were the philanthropists:

96
0:05:21.566,000 --> 0:05:23,000
[If @JustineSacco's unfortunate words ... bother you,

97
0:05:24.072,000 --> 0:05:26,000
join me in supporting @CARE's work in Africa.]

98
0:05:26.243,000 --> 0:05:29,000
[In light of ... disgusting, racist tweet, I'm donating to @care today]

99
0:05:30.056,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Then came the beyond horrified:

100
0:05:31.571,000 --> 0:05:35,000
[... no words for that horribly disgusting racist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco.

101
0:05:35.611,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I am beyond horrified.]

102
0:05:36.786,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Was anybody on Twitter that night? A few of you.

103
0:05:39.063,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Did Justine's joke overwhelm your Twitter feed the way it did mine?

104
0:05:42.557,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It did mine, and I thought what everybody thought that night,

105
0:05:45.473,000 --> 0:05:48,000
which was, "Wow, somebody's screwed!

106
0:05:48.585,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Somebody's life is about to get terrible!"

107
0:05:50.949,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And I sat up in my bed,

108
0:05:52.281,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and I put the pillow behind my head,

109
0:05:55.229,000 --> 0:06:,000
and then I thought, I'm not entirely sure that joke was intended to be racist.

110
0:06:00.5,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Maybe instead of gleefully flaunting her privilege,

111
0:06:03.286,000 --> 0:06:05,000
she was mocking the gleeful flaunting of privilege.

112
0:06:05.91,000 --> 0:06:06,000
There's a comedy tradition of this,

113
0:06:07.747,000 --> 0:06:1,000
like South Park or Colbert or Randy Newman.

114
0:06:11.459,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Maybe Justine Sacco's crime was not being as good at it as Randy Newman.

115
0:06:16.444,000 --> 0:06:18,000
In fact, when I met Justine a couple of weeks later in a bar,

116
0:06:19.388,000 --> 0:06:21,000
she was just crushed,

117
0:06:21.501,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and I asked her to explain the joke,

118
0:06:23.474,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and she said, "Living in America puts us in a bit of a bubble

119
0:06:27.133,000 --> 0:06:29,000
when it comes to what is going on in the Third World.

120
0:06:29.651,000 --> 0:06:31,000
I was making of fun of that bubble."

121
0:06:32.848,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You know, another woman on Twitter that night, a New Statesman writer Helen Lewis,

122
0:06:36.758,000 --> 0:06:39,000
she reviewed my book on public shaming and wrote that she Tweeted that night,

123
0:06:40.43,000 --> 0:06:43,000
"I'm not sure that her joke was intended to be racist,"

124
0:06:43.744,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and she said straightaway she got a fury of Tweets saying,

125
0:06:46.507,000 --> 0:06:48,000
"Well, you're just a privileged bitch, too."

126
0:06:48.984,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And so to her shame, she wrote,

127
0:06:51.244,000 --> 0:06:55,000
she shut up and watched as Justine's life got torn apart.

128
0:06:57.697,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It started to get darker:

129
0:06:59.53,000 --> 0:07:01,000
[Everyone go report this cunt @JustineSacco]

130
0:07:02.464,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Then came the calls for her to be fired.

131
0:07:05.074,000 --> 0:07:07,000
[Good luck with the job hunt in the new year. #GettingFired]

132
0:07:07.97,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Thousands of people around the world

133
0:07:09.729,000 --> 0:07:12,000
decided it was their duty to get her fired.

134
0:07:13.28,000 --> 0:07:16,000
[@JustineSacco last tweet of your career. #SorryNotSorry

135
0:07:17.162,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Corporations got involved, hoping to sell their products

136
0:07:20.361,000 --> 0:07:22,000
on the back of Justine's annihilation:

137
0:07:22.742,000 --> 0:07:25,000
[Next time you plan to tweet something stupid before you take off,

138
0:07:25.983,000 --> 0:07:27,000
make sure you are getting on a @Gogo flight!]

139
0:07:28.158,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

140
0:07:30.588,000 --> 0:07:32,000
A lot of companies were making good money that night.

141
0:07:33.218,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You know, Justine's name was normally Googled 40 times a month.

142
0:07:37.159,000 --> 0:07:4,000
That month, between December the 20th and the end of December,

143
0:07:40.511,000 --> 0:07:44,000
her name was Googled 1,220,000 times.

144
0:07:45.893,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And one Internet economist told me that that meant that Google made

145
0:07:49.442,000 --> 0:07:54,000
somewhere between 120,000 dollars and 468,000 dollars

146
0:07:54.476,000 --> 0:07:58,000
from Justine's annihilation, whereas those of us doing the actual shaming --

147
0:07:58.566,000 --> 0:07:59,000
we got nothing.

148
0:07:59.744,000 --> 0:08:,000
(Laughter)

149
0:08:00.768,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We were like unpaid shaming interns for Google.

150
0:08:04.242,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Laughter)

151
0:08:07.553,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And then came the trolls:

152
0:08:09.973,000 --> 0:08:11,000

"Somebody HIV-positive should rape this bitch and then we'll find out

if her skin color protects her from AIDS."

156
0:08:19.534,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And that person got a free pass.

157

Nobody went after that person.

158
0:08:24.248,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We were all so excited about destroying Justine,

159
0:08:26.907,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and our shaming brains are so simple-minded,

160
0:08:29.558,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that we couldn't also handle destroying somebody

161
0:08:31.967,000 --> 0:08:33,000
who was inappropriately destroying Justine.

162
0:08:35.695,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Justine was really uniting a lot of disparate groups that night,

163
0:08:39.247,000 --> 0:08:41,000
from philanthropists to "rape the bitch."

When a man gets shamed, it's, "I'm going to get you fired."

168
0:08:55.316,000 --> 0:08:56,000
When a woman gets shamed, it's,

169
0:08:57.038,000 --> 0:09:01,000
"I'm going to get you fired and raped and cut out your uterus."

170
0:09:01.943,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And then Justine's employers got involved:

We knew something that Justine didn't.

182

Can you think of anything less judicial than this?

183
0:09:35.474,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Justine was asleep on a plane and unable to explain herself,

184
0:09:38.375,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and her inability was a huge part of the hilarity.

185
0:09:42.529,000 --> 0:09:46,000
On Twitter that night, we were like toddlers crawling towards a gun.

186

So why did we do it?

206
0:10:39.933,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I think some people were genuinely upset,

207
0:10:42.858,000 --> 0:10:43,000
but I think for other people,

208
0:10:44.31,000 --> 0:10:47,000
it's because Twitter is basically a mutual approval machine.

209
0:10:47.357,000 --> 0:10:49,000
We surround ourselves with people who feel the same way we do,

210
0:10:50.3,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and we approve each other,

211
0:10:51.587,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and that's a really good feeling.

212
0:10:53.262,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And if somebody gets in the way, we screen them out.

213
0:10:55.934,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And do you know what that's the opposite of?

214
0:10:58.045,000 --> 0:10:59,000
It's the opposite of democracy.

215
0:11:00.336,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We wanted to show that we cared about people dying of AIDS in Africa.

216
0:11:04.357,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Our desire to be seen to be compassionate is what led us to commit

217
0:11:08.388,000 --> 0:11:11,000
this profoundly un-compassionate act.

218
0:11:11.887,000 --> 0:11:13,000
As Meghan O'Gieblyn wrote in the Boston Review,

219
0:11:14.441,000 --> 0:11:18,000
"This isn't social justice. It's a cathartic alternative."

220
0:11:19.686,000 --> 0:11:2,000
For the past three years,

221
0:11:20.909,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I've been going around the world meeting people like Justine Sacco --

222
0:11:24.211,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and believe me, there's a lot of people like Justine Sacco.

223
0:11:27.019,000 --> 0:11:28,000
There's more every day.

224
0:11:28.749,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And we want to think they're fine, but they're not fine.

225
0:11:32.065,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The people I met were mangled.

226
0:11:34.224,000 --> 0:11:35,000
They talked to me about depression,

227
0:11:36.089,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and anxiety and insomnia and suicidal thoughts.

228
0:11:40.029,000 --> 0:11:44,000
One woman I talked to, who also told a joke that landed badly,

229
0:11:44.792,000 --> 0:11:46,000
she stayed home for a year and a half.

230
0:11:47.427,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Before that, she worked with adults with learning difficulties,

231
0:11:51.893,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and was apparently really good at her job.

232
0:11:55.306,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Justine was fired, of course, because social media demanded it.

233
0:11:59.607,000 --> 0:12:,000
But it was worse than that.

234
0:12:01.375,000 --> 0:12:02,000
She was losing herself.

235
0:12:03.358,000 --> 0:12:07,000
She was waking up in the middle of the night, forgetting who she was.

236
0:12:08.079,000 --> 0:12:11,000
She was got because she was perceived to have misused her privilege.

237
0:12:12.059,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And of course, that's a much better thing to get people for than the things

238
0:12:15.644,000 --> 0:12:18,000
we used to get people for, like having children out of wedlock.

239
0:12:18.828,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But the phrase "misuse of privilege" is becoming a free pass

240
0:12:21.683,000 --> 0:12:24,000
to tear apart pretty much anybody we choose to.

241
0:12:25.135,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It's becoming a devalued term,

242
0:12:27.465,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and it's making us lose our capacity for empathy

243
0:12:30.474,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and for distinguishing between serious and unserious transgressions.

244
0:12:36.334,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Justine had 170 Twitter followers, and so to make it work,

245
0:12:39.887,000 --> 0:12:4,000
she had to be fictionalized.

246
0:12:41.88,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Word got around that she was the daughter the mining billionaire Desmond Sacco.

247
0:12:46.719,000 --> 0:12:49,000
[Let us not be fooled by #JustineSacco her father is a SA mining billionaire.

248
0:12:50.367,000 --> 0:12:52,000
She's not sorry. And neither is her father.]

249
0:12:52.446,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I thought that was true about Justine,

250
0:12:54.293,000 --> 0:12:57,000
until I met her at a bar, and I asked her about her billionaire father,

251
0:12:57.655,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and she said, "My father sells carpets."

252
0:12:59.592,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And I think back on the early days of Twitter,

253
0:13:01.773,000 --> 0:13:03,000
when people would admit shameful secrets about themselves,

254
0:13:04.527,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and other people would say, "Oh my God, I'm exactly the same."

255
0:13:07.477,000 --> 0:13:11,000
These days, the hunt is on for people's shameful secrets.

256
0:13:11.674,000 --> 0:13:13,000
You can lead a good, ethical life,

257
0:13:13.74,000 --> 0:13:17,000
but some bad phraseology in a Tweet can overwhelm it all,

258
0:13:18.198,000 --> 0:13:2,000
become a clue to your secret inner evil.

259
0:13:21.797,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Maybe there's two types of people in the world:

260
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
those people who favor humans over ideology,

261
0:13:27.811,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and those people who favor ideology over humans.

262
0:13:31.107,000 --> 0:13:33,000
I favor humans over ideology,

263
0:13:33.779,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but right now, the ideologues are winning,

264
0:13:36.564,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and they're creating a stage for constant artificial high dramas

265
0:13:41.258,000 --> 0:13:43,000
where everybody's either a magnificent hero

266
0:13:43.71,000 --> 0:13:44,000
or a sickening villain,

267
0:13:45.342,000 --> 0:13:48,000
even though we know that's not true about our fellow humans.

268
0:13:48.383,000 --> 0:13:51,000
What's true is that we are clever and stupid;

269
0:13:52.393,000 --> 0:13:55,000
what's true is that we're grey areas.

270
0:13:55.603,000 --> 0:13:57,000
The great thing about social media was how it gave a voice

271
0:13:58.505,000 --> 0:13:59,000
to voiceless people,

272
0:13:59.925,000 --> 0:14:01,000
but we're now creating a surveillance society,

273
0:14:02.603,000 --> 0:14:06,000
where the smartest way to survive is to go back to being voiceless.

274
0:14:07.423,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Let's not do that.

275
0:14:08.88,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Thank you.

BG: Don't go away.

280
0:14:26.939,000 --> 0:14:27,000
What strikes me about Justine's story

281
0:14:28.758,000 --> 0:14:3,000
is also the fact that if you Google her name today,

282
0:14:31.215,000 --> 0:14:33,000
this story covers the first 100 pages of Google results --

283
0:14:33.986,000 --> 0:14:35,000
there is nothing else about her.

284
0:14:36.222,000 --> 0:14:38,000
In your book, you mention another story

285
0:14:38.834,000 --> 0:14:42,000
of another victim who actually got taken on by a reputation management firm,

286
0:14:43.389,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and by creating blogs and posting nice, innocuous stories about her love for cats

287
0:14:48.497,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and holidays and stuff, managed to get the story

288
0:14:51.237,000 --> 0:14:54,000
off the first couple pages of Google results, but it didn't last long.

289
0:14:55.184,000 --> 0:14:59,000
A couple of weeks later, they started creeping back up to the top result.

290
0:15:00.161,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Is this a totally lost battle?

291
0:15:02.483,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Jon Ronson: You know, I think the very best thing we can do,

292
0:15:05.341,000 --> 0:15:09,000
if you see a kind of unfair or an ambiguous shaming,

293
0:15:09.939,000 --> 0:15:12,000
is to speak up, because I think the worst thing that happened to Justine

294
0:15:13.363,000 --> 0:15:16,000
was that nobody supported her -- like, everyone was against her,

295
0:15:16.403,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and that is profoundly traumatizing,

296
0:15:18.152,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to be told by tens of thousands of people that you need to get out.

297
0:15:21.998,000 --> 0:15:25,000
But if a shaming happens and there's a babble of voices, like in a democracy,

298
0:15:26.112,000 --> 0:15:29,000
where people are discussing it, I think that's much less damaging.

299
0:15:29.232,000 --> 0:15:3,000
So I think that's the way forward,

300
0:15:30.883,000 --> 0:15:32,000
but it's hard, because if you do stand up for somebody,

301
0:15:33.503,000 --> 0:15:34,000
it's incredibly unpleasant.

302
0:15:35.223,000 --> 0:15:36,000
BG: So let's talk about your experience,

303
0:15:37.167,000 --> 0:15:39,000
because you stood up by writing this book.

304
0:15:39.199,000 --> 0:15:41,000
By the way, it's mandatory reading for everybody, okay?

305
0:15:41.812,000 --> 0:15:45,000
You stood up because the book actually puts the spotlight on shamers.

306
0:15:46.146,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And I assume you didn't only have friendly reactions on Twitter.

307
0:15:49.202,000 --> 0:15:51,000
JR: It didn't go down that well with some people.

308
0:15:51.906,000 --> 0:15:52,000
(Laughter)

309
0:15:52.931,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I mean, you don't want to just concentrate --

310
0:15:55.059,000 --> 0:15:58,000
because lots of people understood, and were really nice about the book.

311
0:15:58.48,000 --> 0:16:01,000
But yeah, for 30 years I've been writing stories about abuses of power,

312
0:16:01.857,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and when I say the powerful people over there in the military,

313
0:16:05.161,000 --> 0:16:07,000
or in the pharmaceutical industry, everybody applauds me.

314
0:16:07.953,000 --> 0:16:11,000
As soon as I say, "We are the powerful people abusing our power now,"

315
0:16:12.352,000 --> 0:16:14,000
I get people saying, "Well you must be a racist too."

316
0:16:15.1,000 --> 0:16:17,000
BG: So the other night -- yesterday -- we were at dinner,

317
0:16:17.799,000 --> 0:16:18,000
and there were two discussions going on.

318
0:16:19.738,000 --> 0:16:22,000
On one side you were talking with people around the table --

319
0:16:22.81,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and that was a nice, constructive discussion.

320
0:16:24.997,000 --> 0:16:26,000
On the other, every time you turned to your phone,

321
0:16:27.368,000 --> 0:16:28,000
there is this deluge of insults.

322
0:16:28.953,000 --> 0:16:31,000
JR: Yeah. This happened last night. We had like a TED dinner last night.

323
0:16:32.368,000 --> 0:16:35,000
We were chatting and it was lovely and nice, and I decided to check Twitter.

324
0:16:36.192,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Somebody said, "You are a white supremacist."

325
0:16:38.336,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And then I went back and had a nice conversation with somebody,

326
0:16:41.334,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and then I went back to Twitter,

327
0:16:42.899,000 --> 0:16:45,000
somebody said my very existence made the world a worse place.

328
0:16:46.011,000 --> 0:16:48,000
My friend Adam Curtis says

329
0:16:48.782,000 --> 0:16:51,000
that maybe the Internet is like a John Carpenter movie from the 1980s,

330
0:16:52.614,000 --> 0:16:55,000
when eventually everyone will start screaming at each other

331
0:16:55.679,000 --> 0:16:57,000
and shooting each other, and then eventually everybody

332
0:16:58.233,000 --> 0:16:59,000
would flee to somewhere safer,

333
0:17:00.253,000 --> 0:17:03,000
and I'm starting to think of that as a really nice option.

334
0:17:04.177,000 --> 0:17:05,000
BG: Jon, thank you. JR: Thank you, Bruno.

335
0:17:06.154,000 --> 0:17:09,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
There's a poem written

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
by a very famous English poet

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
at the end of the 19th century.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It was said to echo in Churchill's brain

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in the 1930s.

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And the poem goes:

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
"On the idle hill of summer,

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
lazy with the flow of streams,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
hark I hear a distant drummer,

10
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
drumming like a sound in dreams,

11
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
far and near and low and louder on the roads of earth go by,

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
dear to friend and food to powder,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
soldiers marching,

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
soon to die."

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Those who are interested in poetry,

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the poem is "A Shropshire Lad" written by A.E. Housman.

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But what Housman understood,

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and you hear it in the symphonies of Nielsen too,

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
was that the long, hot, silvan summers

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
of stability of the 19th century

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
were coming to a close,

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and that we were about to move

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
into one of those terrifying periods of history

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
when power changes.

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And these are always periods, ladies and gentlemen,

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
accompanied by turbulence,

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and all too often by blood.

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And my message for you

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
is that I believe we are condemned, if you like,

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to live at just one of those moments in history

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
when the gimbals upon which

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the established order of power is beginning to change

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and the new look of the world,

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
the new powers that exist in the world,

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
are beginning to take form.

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And these are -- and we see it very clearly today --

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
nearly always highly turbulent times, highly difficult times,

38
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and all too often very bloody times.

39
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
By the way, it happens about once every century.

40
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You might argue that the last time it happened --

41
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and that's what Housman felt coming and what Churchill felt too --

42
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
was that when power passed from the old nations,

43
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
the old powers of Europe,

44
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
across the Atlantic to the new emerging power

45
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
of the United States of America --

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the beginning of the American century.

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And of course, into the vacuum

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
where the too-old European powers used to be

49
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
were played the two bloody catastrophes

50
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
of the last century --

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the one in the first part and the one in the second part: the two great World Wars.

52
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Mao Zedong used to refer to them as the European civil wars,

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and it's probably a more accurate way of describing them.

54
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Well, ladies and gentlemen,

55
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
we live at one of those times.

56
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But for us, I want to talk about three factors today.

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And the first of these, the first two of these,

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is about a shift in power.

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And the second is about some new dimension which I want to refer to,

60
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which has never quite happened in the way it's happening now.

61
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But let's talk about the shifts of power that are occurring to the world.

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And what is happening today

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
is, in one sense, frightening

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
because it's never happened before.

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
We have seen lateral shifts of power --

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the power of Greece passed to Rome

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and the power shifts that occurred

68
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
during the European civilizations --

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but we are seeing something slightly different.

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
For power is not just moving laterally

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
from nation to nation.

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It's also moving vertically.

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
What's happening today is that the power that was encased,

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
held to accountability, held to the rule of law,

75
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
within the institution of the nation state

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
has now migrated in very large measure onto the global stage.

77
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The globalization of power --

78
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
we talk about the globalization of markets,

79
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
but actually it's the globalization of real power.

80
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And where, at the nation state level

81
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that power is held to accountability

82
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
subject to the rule of law,

83
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
on the international stage it is not.

84
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The international stage and the global stage where power now resides:

85
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the power of the Internet, the power of the satellite broadcasters,

86
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the power of the money changers --

87
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
this vast money-go-round

88
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
that circulates now 32 times the amount of money necessary

89
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
for the trade it's supposed to be there to finance --

90
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the money changers, if you like,

91
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
the financial speculators

92
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that have brought us all to our knees quite recently,

93
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the power of the multinational corporations

94
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
now developing budgets

95
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
often bigger than medium-sized countries.

96
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
These live in a global space

97
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
which is largely unregulated,

98
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
not subject to the rule of law,

99
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and in which people may act free of constraint.

100
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Now that suits the powerful

101
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
up to a moment.

102
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's always suitable for those who have the most power

103
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
to operate in spaces without constraint,

104
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but the lesson of history is that, sooner or later,

105
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
unregulated space --

106
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
space not subject to the rule of law --

107
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
becomes populated, not just by the things you wanted --

108
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
international trade, the Internet, etc. --

109
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but also by the things you don't want --

110
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
international criminality, international terrorism.

111
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The revelation of 9/11

112
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
is that even if you are the most powerful nation on earth,

113
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
nevertheless,

114
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
those who inhabit that space can attack you

115
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
even in your most iconic of cities

116
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
one bright September morning.

117
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's said that something like 60 percent

118
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
of the four million dollars that was taken to fund 9/11

119
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
actually passed through the institutions of the Twin Towers

120
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
which 9/11 destroyed.

121
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You see, our enemies also use this space --

122
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the space of mass travel, the Internet, satellite broadcasters --

123
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
to be able to get around their poison,

124
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
which is about destroying our systems and our ways.

125
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Sooner or later,

126
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
sooner or later,

127
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the rule of history

128
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
is that where power goes

129
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
governance must follow.

130
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And if it is therefore the case, as I believe it is,

131
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that one of the phenomenon of our time

132
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
is the globalization of power,

133
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
then it follows that one of the challenges of our time

134
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
is to bring governance to the global space.

135
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And I believe that the decades ahead of us now

136
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
will be to a greater or lesser extent turbulent

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
the more or less we are able to achieve that aim:

138
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to bring governance to the global space.

139
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Now notice, I'm not talking about government.

140
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
I'm not talking about setting up

141
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
some global democratic institution.

142
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
My own view, by the way, ladies and gentlemen,

143
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
is that this is unlikely to be done

144
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
by spawning more U.N. institutions.

145
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
If we didn't have the U.N., we'd have to invent it.

146
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The world needs an international forum.

147
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It needs a means by which you can legitimize international action.

148
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But when it comes to governance of the global space,

149
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
my guess is this won't happen

150
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
through the creation of more U.N. institutions.

151
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It will actually happen by the powerful coming together

152
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and making treaty-based systems,

153
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
treaty-based agreements,

154
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to govern that global space.

155
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
And if you look, you can see them happening, already beginning to emerge.

156
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
The World Trade Organization: treaty-based organization,

157
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
entirely treaty-based,

158
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and yet, powerful enough to hold even the most powerful, the United States,

159
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to account if necessary.

160
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Kyoto: the beginnings of struggling to create

161
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
a treaty-based organization.

162
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
The G20:

163
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
we know now that we have to put together an institution

164
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
which is capable of bringing governance

165
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to that financial space for financial speculation.

166
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And that's what the G20 is, a treaty-based institution.

167
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Now there's a problem there,

168
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and we'll come back to it in a minute,

169
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
which is that if you bring the most powerful together

170
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
to make the rules in treaty-based institutions,

171
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to fill that governance space,

172
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
then what happens to the weak who are left out?

173
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And that's a big problem,

174
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and we'll return to it in just a second.

175
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So there's my first message,

176
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that if you are to pass through these turbulent times

177
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
more or less turbulently,

178
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
then our success in doing that

179
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
will in large measure depend on our capacity

180
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to bring sensible governance

181
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to the global space.

182
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And watch that beginning to happen.

183
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
My second point is,

184
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and I know I don't have to talk to an audience like this

185
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
about such a thing,

186
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
but power is not just shifting vertically,

187
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
it's also shifting horizontally.

188
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
You might argue that the story, the history of civilizations,

189
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
has been civilizations gathered around seas --

190
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
with the first ones around the Mediterranean,

191
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
the more recent ones in the ascendents of Western power around the Atlantic.

192
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Well it seems to me

193
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that we're now seeing a fundamental shift of power, broadly speaking,

194
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
away from nations gathered around the Atlantic [seaboard]

195
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to the nations gathered around the Pacific rim.

196
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Now that begins with economic power,

197
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
but that's the way it always begins.

198
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
You already begin to see the development of foreign policies,

199
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
the augmentation of military budgets

200
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
occurring in the other growing powers in the world.

201
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I think actually

202
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
this is not so much a shift from the West to the East;

203
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
something different is happening.

204
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
My guess is, for what it's worth,

205
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
is that the United States will remain

206
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
the most powerful nation on earth

207
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
for the next 10 years, 15,

208
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but the context in which she holds her power

209
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
has now radically altered; it has radically changed.

210
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
We are coming out of 50 years,

211
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
most unusual years, of history

212
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
in which we have had a totally mono-polar world,

213
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
in which every compass needle

214
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
for or against

215
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
has to be referenced by its position to Washington --

216
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
a world bestrode by a single colossus.

217
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
But that's not a usual case in history.

218
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
In fact, what's now emerging

219
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is the much more normal case of history.

220
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
You're beginning to see the emergence

221
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
of a multi-polar world.

222
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
Up until now,

223
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
the United States has been the dominant feature of our world.

224
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
They will remain the most powerful nation,

225
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
but they will be the most powerful nation

226
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in an increasingly multi-polar world.

227
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And you begin to see the alternative centers of power building up --

228
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in China, of course,

229
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
though my own guess is that China's ascent to greatness is not smooth.

230
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It's going to be quite grumpy

231
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
as China begins to democratize her society

232
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
after liberalizing her economy.

233
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
But that's a subject of a different discussion.

234
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
You see India, you see Brazil.

235
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
You see increasingly

236
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that the world now looks actually, for us Europeans,

237
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
much more like Europe in the 19th century.

238
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Europe in the 19th century:

239
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
a great British foreign secretary, Lord Canning,

240
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
used to describe it as the "European concert of powers."

241
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
There was a balance, a five-sided balance.

242
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Britain always played to the balance.

243
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
If Paris got together with Berlin,

244
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Britain got together with Vienna and Rome to provide a counterbalance.

245
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Now notice,

246
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in a period which is dominated by a mono-polar world,

247
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
you have fixed alliances --

248
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
NATO, the Warsaw Pact.

249
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
A fixed polarity of power

250
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
means fixed alliances.

251
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But a multiple polarity of power

252
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
means shifting and changing alliances.

253
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And that's the world we're coming into,

254
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
in which we will increasingly see

255
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
that our alliances are not fixed.

256
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Canning, the great British foreign secretary once said,

257
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
"Britain has a common interest,

258
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
but no common allies."

259
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And we will see increasingly

260
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
that even we in the West

261
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
will reach out, have to reach out,

262
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
beyond the cozy circle of the Atlantic powers

263
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to make alliances with others

264
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
if we want to get things done in the world.

265
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Note, that when we went into Libya,

266
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
it was not good enough for the West to do it alone;

267
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
we had to bring others in.

268
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
We had to bring, in this case, the Arab League in.

269
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
My guess is Iraq and Afghanistan are the last times

270
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
when the West has tried to do it themselves,

271
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and we haven't succeeded.

272
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
My guess

273
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is that we're reaching the beginning of the end of 400 years --

274
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
I say 400 years because it's the end of the Ottoman Empire --

275
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
of the hegemony of Western power,

276
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Western institutions and Western values.

277
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
You know, up until now, if the West got its act together,

278
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
it could propose and dispose

279
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in every corner of the world.

280
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
But that's no longer true.

281
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Take the last financial crisis

282
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
after the Second World War.

283
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
The West got together --

284
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
the Bretton Woods Institution, World Bank, International Monetary Fund --

285
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
the problem solved.

286
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Now we have to call in others.

287
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Now we have to create the G20.

288
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Now we have to reach beyond the cozy circle

289
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
of our Western friends.

290
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Let me make a prediction for you,

291
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
which is probably even more startling.

292
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
I suspect we are now reaching the end

293
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
of 400 years

294
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
when Western power was enough.

295
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
People say to me, "The Chinese, of course,

296
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
they'll never get themselves involved

297
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
in peace-making, multilateral peace-making around the world."

298
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Oh yes? Why not?

299
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
How many Chinese troops

300
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
are serving under the blue beret, serving under the blue flag,

301
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
serving under the U.N. command in the world today?

302
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
3,700.

303
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
How many Americans? 11.

304
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
What is the largest naval contingent

305
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
tackling the issue of Somali pirates?

306
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
The Chinese naval contingent.

307
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Of course they are, they are a mercantilist nation.

308
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
They want to keep the sea lanes open.

309
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Increasingly, we are going to have to do business

310
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
with people with whom we do not share values,

311
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
but with whom, for the moment, we share common interests.

312
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
It's a whole new different way

313
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
of looking at the world that is now emerging.

314
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And here's the third factor,

315
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
which is totally different.

316
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Today in our modern world,

317
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
because of the Internet,

318
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
because of the kinds of things people have been talking about here,

319
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
everything is connected to everything.

320
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
We are now interdependent.

321
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We are now interlocked,

322
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
as nations, as individuals,

323
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
in a way which has never been the case before,

324
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
never been the case before.

325
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
The interrelationship of nations,

326
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
well it's always existed.

327
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Diplomacy is about managing the interrelationship of nations.

328
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
But now we are intimately locked together.

329
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
You get swine flu in Mexico,

330
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
it's a problem for Charles de Gaulle Airport

331
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
24 hours later.

332
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Lehman Brothers goes down, the whole lot collapses.

333
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
There are fires in the steppes of Russia,

334
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
food riots in Africa.

335
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
We are all now deeply, deeply, deeply interconnected.

336
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And what that means

337
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
is the idea of a nation state acting alone,

338
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
not connected with others,

339
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
not working with others,

340
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
is no longer a viable proposition.

341
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Because the actions of a nation state

342
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
are neither confined to itself,

343
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
nor is it sufficient for the nation state itself

344
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
to control its own territory,

345
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
because the effects outside the nation state

346
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
are now beginning to affect what happens inside them.

347
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I was a young soldier

348
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
in the last of the small empire wars of Britain.

349
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
At that time, the defense of my country

350
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
was about one thing and one thing only:

351
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
how strong was our army, how strong was our air force,

352
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
how strong was our navy and how strong were our allies.

353
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
That was when the enemy was outside the walls.

354
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Now the enemy is inside the walls.

355
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Now if I want to talk about the defense of my country,

356
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
I have to speak to the Minister of Health

357
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
because pandemic disease is a threat to my security,

358
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
I have to speak to the Minister of Agriculture

359
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
because food security is a threat to my security,

360
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I have to speak to the Minister of Industry

361
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
because the fragility of our hi-tech infrastructure

362
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
is now a point of attack for our enemies --

363
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
as we see from cyber warfare --

364
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
I have to speak to the Minister of Home Affairs

365
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
because who has entered my country,

366
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
who lives in that terraced house in that inner city

367
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
has a direct effect on what happens in my country --

368
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
as we in London saw in the 7/7 bombings.

369
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It's no longer the case that the security of a country

370
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
is simply a matter for its soldiers and its ministry of defense.

371
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
It's its capacity to lock together its institutions.

372
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And this tells you something very important.

373
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
It tells you that, in fact,

374
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
our governments, vertically constructed,

375
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
constructed on the economic model of the Industrial Revolution --

376
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
vertical hierarchy, specialization of tasks,

377
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
command structures --

378
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
have got the wrong structures completely.

379
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
You in business know

380
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
that the paradigm structure of our time, ladies and gentlemen,

381
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
is the network.

382
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
It's your capacity to network that matters,

383
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
both within your governments and externally.

384
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So here is Ashdown's third law.

385
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
By the way, don't ask me about Ashdown's first law and second law

386
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
because I haven't invented those yet;

387
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
it always sounds better if there's a third law, doesn't it?

388
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Ashdown's third law is that in the modern age,

389
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
where everything is connected to everything,

390
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
the most important thing about what you can do

391
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
is what you can do with others.

392
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
The most important bit about your structure --

393
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
whether you're a government, whether you're an army regiment,

394
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
whether you're a business --

395
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
is your docking points, your interconnectors,

396
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
your capacity to network with others.

397
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
You understand that in industry;

398
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
governments don't.

399
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
But now one final thing.

400
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
If it is the case, ladies and gentlemen -- and it is --

401
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
that we are now locked together

402
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
in a way that has never been quite the same before,

403
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
then it's also the case that we share a destiny with each other.

404
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
Suddenly and for the very first time,

405
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
collective defense, the thing that has dominated us

406
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
as the concept of securing our nations,

407
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
is no longer enough.

408
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
It used to be the case

409
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
that if my tribe was more powerful than their tribe, I was safe;

410
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
if my country was more powerful than their country, I was safe;

411
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
my alliance, like NATO, was more powerful than their alliance, I was safe.

412
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
It is no longer the case.

413
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:56,000
The advent of the interconnectedness

414
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and of the weapons of mass destruction

415
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
means that, increasingly,

416
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I share a destiny with my enemy.

417
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
When I was a diplomat

418
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:07,000
negotiating the disarmament treaties with the Soviet Union

419
0:17:07.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
in Geneva in the 1970s,

420
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
we succeeded because we understood

421
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
we shared a destiny with them.

422
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Collective security is not enough.

423
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
Peace has come to Northern Ireland

424
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
because both sides realized that the zero-sum game couldn't work.

425
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
They shared a destiny with their enemies.

426
0:17:24.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
One of the great barriers to peace in the Middle East

427
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
is that both sides, both Israel and, I think, the Palestinians,

428
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
do not understand

429
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
that they share a collective destiny.

430
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
And so suddenly, ladies and gentlemen,

431
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
what has been the proposition

432
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
of visionaries and poets down the ages

433
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
becomes something we have to take seriously

434
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
as a matter of public policy.

435
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
I started with a poem, I'll end with one.

436
0:17:48.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
The great poem of John Donne's.

437
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
"Send not for whom the bell tolls."

438
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
The poem is called "No Man is an Island."

439
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
And it goes:

440
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
"Every man's death affected me,

441
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:04,000
for I am involved in mankind,

442
0:18:04.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
send not to ask

443
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
for whom the bell tolls,

444
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
it tolls for thee."

445
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
For John Donne, a recommendation of morality.

446
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
For us, I think,

447
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
part of the equation for our survival.

448
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
Thank you very much.

449
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
(Applause)

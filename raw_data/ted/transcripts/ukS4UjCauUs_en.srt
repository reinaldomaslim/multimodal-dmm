1
0:00:13.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I study ants, and that's because I like to think about how organizations work.

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And in particular, how the simple parts of organizations

3
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
interact to create the behavior of the whole organization.

4
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So, ant colonies are a good example of an organization like that,

5
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and there are many others. The web is one.

6
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
There are many biological systems like that --

7
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
brains, cells, developing embryos.

8
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
There are about 10,000 species of ants.

9
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
They all live in colonies consisting of one or a few queens,

10
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and then all the ants you see walking around are sterile female workers.

11
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And all ant colonies have in common that there's no central control.

12
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Nobody tells anybody what to do.

13
0:01:01.16,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The queen just lays the eggs. There's no management.

14
0:01:05.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
No ant directs the behavior of any other ant.

15
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And I try to figure out how that works.

16
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And I've been working for the past 20 years

17
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
on a population of seed-eating ants in southeastern Arizona.

18
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Here's my study site. This is really a picture of ants,

19
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and the rabbit just happens to be there.

20
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And these ants are called harvester ants because they eat seeds.

21
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
This is the nest of the mature colony, and there's the nest entrance.

22
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And they forage maybe for about 20 meters away,

23
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
gather up the seeds and bring them back to the nest, and store them.

24
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And every year I go there and make a map of my study site.

25
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
This is just a road. And it's not very big:

26
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
it's about 250 meters on one side, 400 on the other.

27
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And every colony has a name, which is a number,

28
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:53,000
which is painted on a rock. And I go there every year

29
0:01:53.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and look for all the colonies that were alive the year before,

30
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
and figure out which ones have died, and put all the new ones on the map.

31
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And by doing this I know how old they all are.

32
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And because of that, I've been able to study how their behavior changes

33
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
as the colony gets older and larger.

34
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So I want to tell you about the life cycle of a colony.

35
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Ants never make more ants; colonies make more colonies.

36
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And they do that by each year sending out the reproductives --

37
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
those are the ones with wings -- on a mating flight.

38
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So every year, on the same day -- and it's a mystery exactly how that happens --

39
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
each colony sends out its virgin, unmated queens with wings, and the males,

40
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and they all fly to a common place. And they mate.

41
0:02:36.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And this shows a recently virgin queen. Here's her wings.

42
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And she's in the process of mating with this male,

43
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and there's another male on top waiting his turn.

44
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Often the queens mate more than once.

45
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And after that, the males all die. That's it for them.

46
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And then the newly mated queens fly off somewhere, drop their wings,

48
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:06,000
dig a hole and go into that hole and start laying eggs.

49
0:03:06.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And they will live for 15 or 20 years, continuing to lay eggs

50
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
using the sperm from that original mating.

51
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So the queen goes down in there.

52
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
She lays eggs, she feeds the larvae -- so an ant starts as an egg, then it's a larva.

53
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
She feeds the larvae by regurgitating from her fat reserves.

54
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Then, as soon as the ants -- the first group of ants -- emerge,

55
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
they're larvae. Then they're pupae. Then they come out as adult ants.

56
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They go out, they get the food, they dig the nest,

57
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and the queen never comes out again.

58
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So this is a one-year-old colony -- this happens to be 536.

59
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
There's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.

60
0:03:43.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So this is the colony founded by a queen the previous summer.

61
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
This is a three-year-old colony.

62
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
There's the nest entrance, there's a pencil for scale.

63
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
They make a midden, a pile of refuse -- mostly the husks of the seeds that they eat.

64
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This is a five-year-old colony. This is the nest entrance, here's a pencil for scale.

65
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
This is about as big as they get, about a meter across.

66
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And then this is how colony size and numbers of worker ants changes --

67
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
so this is about 10,000 worker ants --

68
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
changes as a function of colony age, in years.

69
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So it starts out with zero ants, just the founding queen,

70
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and it grows to a size of about 10 or 12 thousand ants when the colony is five.

71
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And it stays that size until the queen dies

72
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and there's nobody to make more ants, when she's about 15 or 20 years old.

73
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And it's when they reach this stable size, in numbers of ants,

74
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that they start to reproduce.

75
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:47,000
That is, to send more winged queens and males to that year's mating flight.

76
0:04:47.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I know how colony size changes as a function of colony age

77
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
because I've dug up colonies of known age and counted all the ants. (Laughter)

78
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So that's not the most fun part of this research, although it's interesting.

79
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

80
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Really the question that I think about with these ants is what I call task allocation.

81
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
That's not just how is the colony organized,

82
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but how does it change what it's doing?

83
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
How is it that the colony manages to adjust

84
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the numbers of workers performing each task as conditions change?

85
0:05:23.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So, things happen to an ant colony.

86
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
When it rains in the summer, it floods in the desert.

87
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
There's a lot of damage to the nest,

88
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and extra ants are needed to clean up that mess.

89
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
When extra food becomes available --

90
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and this is what everybody knows about picnics --

91
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
then extra ants are allocated to collect the food.

92
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So, with nobody telling anybody what to do, how is it that

93
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the colony manages to adjust the numbers of workers performing each task?

94
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And that's the process that I call task allocation.

95
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
And in harvester ants, I divide the tasks

96
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
of the ants I see just outside the nest

97
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
into these four categories: where an ant is foraging,

98
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
when it's out along the foraging trail, searching for food or bringing food back.

99
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
The patrollers -- that's supposed to be a magnifying glass --

100
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
are an interesting group that go out early in the morning

101
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
before the foragers are active.

102
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:13,000
They somehow choose the direction that the foragers will go,

103
0:06:13.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and by coming back -- just by making it back --

104
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
they tell the foragers that it's safe to go out.

105
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Then the nest maintenance workers work inside the nest,

106
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and I wanted to say that the nests look a lot like Bill Lishman's house.

107
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
That is, that there are chambers inside,

108
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
they line the walls of the chambers with moist soil

109
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and it dries to a kind of an adobe-like surface in it.

110
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It also looks very similar to some of the cave dwellings

111
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of the Hopi people that are in that area.

112
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And the nest maintenance workers do that inside the nest,

113
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and then they come out of the nest carrying bits of dry soil in their mandibles.

114
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So you see the nest maintenance workers come out with a bit of sand,

115
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
put it down, turn around, and go back in.

116
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And finally, the midden workers put some kind of territorial chemical in the garbage.

117
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
So what you see the midden workers doing is making a pile of refuse.

118
0:07:05.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
On one day, it'll all be here, and then the next day

119
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
they'll move it over there, and then they'll move it back.

120
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
So that's what the midden workers do.

121
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And these four groups are just the ants outside the nest.

122
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So that's only about 25 percent of the colony, and they're the oldest ants.

123
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So, an ant starts out somewhere near the queen.

124
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And when we dig up nests we find they're about as deep

125
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:31,000
as the colony is wide, so about a meter deep for the big old nests.

126
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
And then there's another long tunnel and a chamber, where we often find the queen,

127
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
after eight hours of hacking away at the rock with pickaxes.

128
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
I don't think that chamber has evolved because of me and my backhoe

129
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and my crew of students with pickaxes,

130
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but instead because when there's flooding,

131
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
occasionally the colony has to go down deep.

132
0:07:51.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So there's this whole network of chambers.

133
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The queen's in there somewhere; she just lays eggs.

134
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
There's the larvae, and they consume most of the food.

135
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And this is true of most ants --

136
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that the ants you see walking around don't do much eating.

137
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
They bring it back and feed it to the larvae.

138
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
When the foragers come in with food, they just drop it into the upper chamber,

139
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and other ants come up from below, get the food,

140
0:08:13.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
bring it back, husk the seeds, and pile them up.

141
0:08:16.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
There are nest maintenance workers working throughout the nest.

142
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And curiously, and interestingly, it looks as though at any time

143
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
about half the ants in the colony are just doing nothing.

144
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So, despite what it says in the Bible,

145
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
about, you know, "Look to the ant, thou sluggard,"

146
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in fact, you could think of those ants as reserves.

147
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
That is to say, if something happened -- and I've never seen anything like this happen,

148
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
but I've only been looking for 20 years --

149
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
if something happened, they might all come out if they were needed.

150
0:08:45.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But in fact, mostly they're just hanging around in there.

151
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And I think it's a very interesting question --

152
0:08:49.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
what is there about the way the colony is organized

153
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that might give some function to a reserve of ants who are doing nothing?

154
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And they sort of stand as a buffer in between

155
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
the ants working deep inside the nest and the ants working outside.

156
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And if you mark ants that are working outside, and dig up a colony,

157
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
you never see them deep down.

158
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So what's happening is that the ants work inside the nest when they're younger.

159
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They somehow get into this reserve.

160
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
And then eventually they get recruited to join this exterior workforce.

161
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And once they belong to the ants that work outside, they never go back down.

162
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Now ants -- most ants, including these, don't see very well.

163
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:34,000
They have eyes, they can distinguish between light and dark,

164
0:09:34.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but they mostly work by smell.

165
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So just to reinforce that what you might have thought

166
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
about ant queens isn't true --

167
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
you know, even if the queen did have the intelligence

168
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to send chemical messages through this whole network of chambers

169
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to tell the ants outside what to do,

170
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
there is no way that such messages could make it in time to see

171
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
the shifts in the allocation of workers that we actually see outside the nest.

172
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So that's one way that we know the queen isn't directing the behavior of the colony.

173
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So when I first set out to work on task allocation,

174
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
my first question was, "What's the relationship

175
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
between the ants doing different tasks?

176
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Does it matter to the foragers what the nest maintenance workers are doing?

177
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Does it matter to the midden workers what the patrollers are doing?"

178
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And I was working in the context of a view of ant colonies in which each ant

179
0:10:26.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
was somehow dedicated to its task from birth

180
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and sort of performed independently of the others,

181
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
knowing its place on the assembly line.

182
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And instead I wanted to ask, "How are the different task groups interdependent?"

183
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So I did experiments where I changed one thing.

184
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So for example, I created more work for the nest maintenance workers

185
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
by putting out a pile of toothpicks near the nest entrance,

186
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
early in the morning when the nest maintenance workers are first active.

187
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
This is what it looks like about 20 minutes later.

188
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Here it is about 40 minutes later.

189
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And the nest maintenance workers just take all the toothpicks

190
0:10:58.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
to the outer edge of the nest mound and leave them there.

191
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And what I wanted to know was, "OK,

192
0:11:04.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
here's a situation where extra nest maintenance workers were recruited --

193
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
is this going to have any effect on the workers performing other tasks?"

194
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Then we repeated all those experiments with the ants marked.

195
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So here's some blue nest maintenance workers.

196
0:11:18.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And lately we've gotten more sophisticated

197
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and we have this three-color system.

198
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And we can mark them individually so we know which ant is which.

199
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:27,000
We started out with model airplane paint

200
0:11:27.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and then we found these wonderful little Japanese markers,

201
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and they work really well.

202
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And so just to summarize the result,

203
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
well it turns out that yes, the different tasks are interdependent.

204
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So, if I change the numbers performing one task,

205
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:41,000
it changes the numbers performing another.

206
0:11:41.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So for example, if I make a mess

207
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that the nest maintenance workers have to clean up,

208
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:47,000
then I see fewer ants out foraging.

209
0:11:47.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And this was true for all the pair-wise combinations of tasks.

210
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And the second result, which was surprising to a lot of people,

211
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:57,000
was that ants actually switch tasks.

212
0:11:57.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The same ant doesn't do the same task over and over its whole life.

213
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So for example, if I put out extra food, everybody else --

214
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
the midden workers stop doing midden work and go get the food,

215
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
they become foragers.

216
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The nest maintenance workers become foragers.

217
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
The patrollers become foragers.

218
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
But not every transition is possible. And this shows how it works.

219
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Like I just said, if there is more food to collect, the patrollers, the midden workers,

220
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
the nest maintenance workers will all change to forage.

221
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
If there's more patrolling to do --

222
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
so I created a disturbance, so extra patrollers were needed --

223
0:12:28.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the nest maintenance workers will switch to patrol.

224
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
But if more nest maintenance work is needed --

225
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
for example, if I put out a bunch of toothpicks --

226
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
then nobody will ever switch back to nest maintenance,

227
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
they have to get nest maintenance workers from inside the nest.

228
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So foraging acts as a sink, and the ants inside the nest act as a source.

229
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And finally, it looks like each ant is deciding

230
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
moment to moment whether to be active or not.

231
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So, for example, when there's extra nest maintenance work to do,

232
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
it's not that the foragers switch over. I know that they don't do that.

233
0:13:01.16,000 --> 0:13:03,000
But the foragers somehow decide not to come out.

234
0:13:03.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And here was the most intriguing result: the task allocation.

235
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
This process changes with colony age, and it changes like this.

236
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
When I do these experiments with older colonies --

237
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
so ones that are five years or older --

238
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
they're much more consistent from one time to another

239
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and much more homeostatic. The worse things get,

240
0:13:21.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
the more I hassle them, the more they act like undisturbed colonies.

241
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Whereas the young, small colonies --

242
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
the two-year-old colonies of just 2,000 ants -- are much more variable.

243
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And the amazing thing about this is that an ant lives only a year.

244
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
It could be this year, or this year.

245
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So, the ants in the older colony that seem to be more stable

246
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
are not any older than the ants in the younger colony.

247
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
It's not due to the experience of older, wiser ants.

248
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Instead, something about the organization

249
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
must be changing as the colony gets older.

250
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And the obvious thing that's changing is its size.

251
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So since I've had this result, I've spent a lot of time trying to figure out

252
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
what kinds of decision rules -- very simple, local, probably olfactory, chemical

253
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
rules could an ant could be using, since no ant can assess the global situation --

254
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
that would have the outcome that I see,

255
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
these predictable dynamics, in who does what task.

256
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And it would change as the colony gets larger.

257
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And what I've found out is that ants are using a network of antennal contact.

258
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
So anybody who's ever looked at ants has seen them touch antennae.

259
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
They smell with their antennae.

260
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
When one ant touches another, it's smelling it,

261
0:14:35.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and it can tell, for example, whether the other ant is a nest mate

262
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
because ants cover themselves and each other, through grooming,

263
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
with a layer of grease, which carries a colony-specific odor.

264
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And what we're learning is that an ant uses the pattern of its antennal contacts,

265
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
the rate at which it meets ants of other tasks, in deciding what to do.

266
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
And so what the message is, is not any message

267
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that they transmit from one ant to another, but the pattern.

268
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
The pattern itself is the message.

269
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
And I'll tell you a little bit more about that.

270
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
But first you might be wondering:

271
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
how is it that an ant can tell, for example, I'm a forager.

272
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
I expect to meet another forager every so often.

273
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
But if instead I start to meet a higher number of nest maintenance workers,

274
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
I'm less likely to forage.

275
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
So it has to know the difference between

276
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
a forager and a nest maintenance worker.

277
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And we've learned that, in this species --

278
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and I suspect in others as well --

279
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
these hydrocarbons, this layer of grease on the outside of ants,

280
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
is different as ants perform different tasks.

281
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And we've done experiments that show that

282
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
that's because the longer an ant stays outside,

283
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
the more these simple hydrocarbons on its surface change,

284
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and so they come to smell different by doing different tasks.

285
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And they can use that task-specific odor in cuticular hydrocarbons --

286
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:59,000
they can use that in their brief antennal contacts to somehow

287
0:15:59.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
keep track of the rate at which they're meeting ants of certain tasks.

288
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:06,000
And we've just recently demonstrated this

289
0:16:06.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
by putting extract of hydrocarbons on little glass beads,

290
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and dropping the beads gently down into the nest entrance at the right rate.

291
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:18,000
And it turns out that ants will respond to the right rate of contact

292
0:16:18.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
with a glass bead with hydrocarbon extract on it,

293
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
as they would to contact with real ants.

294
0:16:26.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
So I want now to show you a bit of film --

295
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:38,000
and this will start out, first of all, showing you the nest entrance.

296
0:16:38.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
So the idea is that ants are coming in and out of the nest entrance.

297
0:16:41.16,000 --> 0:16:46,000
They've gone out to do different tasks, and the rate at which they meet

298
0:16:46.16,000 --> 0:16:5,000
as they come in and out of the nest entrance determines, or influences,

299
0:16:50.16,000 --> 0:16:54,000
each ant's decision about whether to go out, and which task to perform.

300
0:16:54.16,000 --> 0:16:58,000
This is taken through a fiber optics microscope. It's down inside the nest.

301
0:16:58.16,000 --> 0:17:,000
In the beginning you see the ants

302
0:17:00.16,000 --> 0:17:02,000
just kind of engaging with the fiber optics microscope.

303
0:17:02.16,000 --> 0:17:06,000
But the idea is that the ants are in there,

304
0:17:06.16,000 --> 0:17:11,000
and each ant is experiencing a certain flow of ants past it --

305
0:17:11.16,000 --> 0:17:14,000
a stream of contacts with other ants.

306
0:17:14.16,000 --> 0:17:17,000
And the pattern of these interactions determines

307
0:17:17.16,000 --> 0:17:22,000
whether the ant comes back out, and what it does when it comes back out.

308
0:17:22.16,000 --> 0:17:29,000
You can also see this in the ants just outside the nest entrance like these.

309
0:17:29.16,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Each ant, then, as it comes back in, is contacting other ants.

310
0:17:33.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
And the ants that are waiting just inside the nest entrance

311
0:17:36.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
to decide whether to go out on their next trip,

312
0:17:39.16,000 --> 0:17:41,000
are contacting the ants coming in.

313
0:17:41.16,000 --> 0:17:45,000
So, what's interesting about this system is that it's messy.

314
0:17:45.16,000 --> 0:17:5,000
It's variable. It's noisy. And, in particular, in two ways.

315
0:17:50.16,000 --> 0:17:55,000
The first is that the experience of the ant -- of each ant -- can't be very predictable.

316
0:17:55.16,000 --> 0:17:58,000
Because the rate at which ants come back depends on

317
0:17:58.16,000 --> 0:18:03,000
all the little things that happen to an ant as it goes out and does its task outside.

318
0:18:03.16,000 --> 0:18:08,000
And the second thing is that an ant's ability to assess this pattern

319
0:18:08.16,000 --> 0:18:14,000
must be very crude because no ant can do any sophisticated counting.

320
0:18:15.16,000 --> 0:18:19,000
So, we do a lot of simulation and modeling, and also experimental work,

321
0:18:19.16,000 --> 0:18:25,000
to try to figure out how those two kinds of noise combine to,

322
0:18:25.16,000 --> 0:18:29,000
in the aggregate, produce the predictable behavior of ant colonies.

323
0:18:31.16,000 --> 0:18:36,000
Again, I don't want to say that this kind of haphazard pattern of interactions

324
0:18:36.16,000 --> 0:18:43,000
produces a factory that works with the precision and efficiency of clockwork.

325
0:18:43.16,000 --> 0:18:46,000
In fact, if you watch ants at all, you end up trying to help them

326
0:18:46.16,000 --> 0:18:48,000
because they never seem to be doing anything

327
0:18:48.16,000 --> 0:18:51,000
exactly the way that you think that they ought to be doing it.

328
0:18:51.16,000 --> 0:18:58,000
So it's not really that out of these haphazard contacts, perfection arises.

329
0:18:58.16,000 --> 0:19:,000
But it works pretty well.

330
0:19:00.16,000 --> 0:19:03,000
Ants have been around for several hundred million years.

331
0:19:03.16,000 --> 0:19:06,000
They cover the earth, except for Antarctica.

332
0:19:06.16,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Something that they're doing is clearly successful enough

333
0:19:10.16,000 --> 0:19:13,000
that this pattern of haphazard contacts, in the aggregate,

334
0:19:13.16,000 --> 0:19:17,000
produces something that allows ants to make a lot more ants.

335
0:19:17.16,000 --> 0:19:2,000
And one of the things that we're studying is how natural selection

336
0:19:20.16,000 --> 0:19:27,000
might be acting now to shape this use of interaction patterns --

337
0:19:27.16,000 --> 0:19:29,000
this network of interaction patterns --

338
0:19:29.16,000 --> 0:19:34,000
to perhaps increase the foraging efficiency of ant colonies.

339
0:19:34.16,000 --> 0:19:37,000
So the one thing, though, that I want you to remember about this

340
0:19:37.16,000 --> 0:19:4,000
is that these patterns of interactions

341
0:19:40.16,000 --> 0:19:45,000
are something that you'd expect to be closely connected to colony size.

342
0:19:45.16,000 --> 0:19:5,000
The simplest idea is that when an ant is in a small colony --

343
0:19:50.16,000 --> 0:19:54,000
and an ant in a large colony can use the same rule,

344
0:19:54.16,000 --> 0:19:58,000
like "I expect to meet another forager every three seconds."

345
0:19:58.16,000 --> 0:20:01,000
But in a small colony, it's likely to meet fewer foragers,

346
0:20:01.16,000 --> 0:20:05,000
just because there are fewer other foragers there to meet.

347
0:20:05.16,000 --> 0:20:11,000
So this is the kind of rule that, as the colony develops and gets older and larger,

348
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:16,000
will produce different behavior in an old colony and a small young one.

349
0:20:16.16,000 --> 0:20:18,000
Thank you.

350
0:20:18.16,000 --> 0:20:2,000

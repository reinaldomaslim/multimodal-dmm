1
0:00:12.838,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Cancer affects all of us --

2
0:00:15.045,000 --> 0:00:18,000
especially the ones that come back over and over again,

3
0:00:18.436,000 --> 0:00:2,000
the highly invasive and drug-resistant ones,

4
0:00:21.456,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the ones that defy medical treatment,

5
0:00:23.859,000 --> 0:00:25,000
even when we throw our best drugs at them.

6
0:00:27.247,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Engineering at the molecular level,

7
0:00:30.191,000 --> 0:00:32,000
working at the smallest of scales,

8
0:00:32.863,000 --> 0:00:34,000
can provide exciting new ways

9
0:00:35.41,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to fight the most aggressive forms of cancer.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Cancer is a very clever disease.

11
0:00:42.346,000 --> 0:00:43,000
There are some forms of cancer,

12
0:00:43.947,000 --> 0:00:47,000
which, fortunately, we've learned how to address relatively well

13
0:00:48.706,000 --> 0:00:51,000
with known and established drugs and surgery.

14
0:00:52.627,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But there are some forms of cancer

15
0:00:54.628,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that don't respond to these approaches,

16
0:00:56.884,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and the tumor survives or comes back,

17
0:00:59.536,000 --> 0:01:01,000
even after an onslaught of drugs.

18
0:01:02.053,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We can think of these very aggressive forms of cancer

19
0:01:06.071,000 --> 0:01:08,000
as kind of supervillains in a comic book.

20
0:01:09.455,000 --> 0:01:11,000
They're clever, they're adaptable,

21
0:01:12.184,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and they're very good at staying alive.

22
0:01:15.744,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And, like most supervillains these days,

23
0:01:18.996,000 --> 0:01:21,000
their superpowers come from a genetic mutation.

24
0:01:24.74,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The genes that are modified inside these tumor cells

25
0:01:27.706,000 --> 0:01:32,000
can enable and encode for new and unimagined modes of survival,

26
0:01:32.997,000 --> 0:01:34,000
allowing the cancer cell to live through

27
0:01:35.496,000 --> 0:01:37,000
even our best chemotherapy treatments.

28
0:01:38.789,000 --> 0:01:42,000
One example is a trick in which a gene allows a cell,

29
0:01:43.32,000 --> 0:01:45,000
even as the drug approaches the cell,

30
0:01:46.39,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to push the drug out,

31
0:01:49.85,000 --> 0:01:51,000
before the drug can have any effect.

32
0:01:52.047,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Imagine -- the cell effectively spits out the drug.

33
0:01:56.393,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This is just one example of the many genetic tricks

34
0:01:59.347,000 --> 0:02:01,000
in the bag of our supervillain, cancer.

35
0:02:01.971,000 --> 0:02:03,000
All due to mutant genes.

36
0:02:04.717,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So, we have a supervillain with incredible superpowers.

37
0:02:09.462,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And we need a new and powerful mode of attack.

38
0:02:13.704,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Actually, we can turn off a gene.

39
0:02:17.328,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The key is a set of molecules known as siRNA.

40
0:02:21.143,000 --> 0:02:24,000
siRNA are short sequences of genetic code

41
0:02:25.253,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that guide a cell to block a certain gene.

42
0:02:28.982,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Each siRNA molecule can turn off a specific gene

43
0:02:32.581,000 --> 0:02:33,000
inside the cell.

44
0:02:35.292,000 --> 0:02:37,000
For many years since its discovery,

45
0:02:37.337,000 --> 0:02:38,000
scientists have been very excited

46
0:02:39.311,000 --> 0:02:42,000
about how we can apply these gene blockers in medicine.

47
0:02:43.216,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But, there is a problem.

48
0:02:44.958,000 --> 0:02:46,000
siRNA works well inside the cell.

49
0:02:47.854,000 --> 0:02:49,000
But if it gets exposed to the enzymes

50
0:02:50.872,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that reside in our bloodstream or our tissues,

51
0:02:53.396,000 --> 0:02:54,000
it degrades within seconds.

52
0:02:55.769,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It has to be packaged, protected through its journey through the body

53
0:03:00.109,000 --> 0:03:03,000
on its way to the final target inside the cancer cell.

54
0:03:03.74,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So, here's our strategy.

55
0:03:06.468,000 --> 0:03:09,000
First, we'll dose the cancer cell with siRNA, the gene blocker,

56
0:03:10.295,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and silence those survival genes,

57
0:03:11.915,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and then we'll whop it with a chemo drug.

58
0:03:14.501,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But how do we carry that out?

59
0:03:16.764,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Using molecular engineering,

60
0:03:19.705,000 --> 0:03:22,000
we can actually design a superweapon

61
0:03:23.648,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that can travel through the bloodstream.

62
0:03:25.923,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It has to be tiny enough to get through the bloodstream,

63
0:03:28.943,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it's got to be small enough to penetrate the tumor tissue,

64
0:03:32.368,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and it's got to be tiny enough to be taken up inside the cancer cell.

65
0:03:37.049,000 --> 0:03:38,000
To do this job well,

66
0:03:38.675,000 --> 0:03:42,000
it has to be about one one-hundredth the size of a human hair.

67
0:03:44.224,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Let's take a closer look at how we can build this nanoparticle.

68
0:03:49.146,000 --> 0:03:51,000
First, let's start with the nanoparticle core.

69
0:03:51.567,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It's a tiny capsule that contains the chemotherapy drug.

70
0:03:56.089,000 --> 0:03:59,000
This is the poison that will actually end the tumor cell's life.

71
0:04:00.152,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Around this core, we'll wrap a very thin,

72
0:04:03.961,000 --> 0:04:05,000
nanometers-thin blanket of siRNA.

73
0:04:06.818,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is our gene blocker.

74
0:04:09.093,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Because siRNA is strongly negatively charged,

75
0:04:12.706,000 --> 0:04:13,000
we can protect it

76
0:04:14.287,000 --> 0:04:18,000
with a nice, protective layer of positively charged polymer.

77
0:04:19.503,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The two oppositely charged molecules stick together

78
0:04:22.784,000 --> 0:04:23,000
through charge attraction,

79
0:04:24.244,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and that provides us with a protective layer

80
0:04:26.402,000 --> 0:04:29,000
that prevents the siRNA from degrading in the bloodstream.

81
0:04:30.106,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We're almost done.

82
0:04:31.43,000 --> 0:04:32,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:32.914,000 --> 0:04:36,000
But there is one more big obstacle we have to think about.

84
0:04:37.016,000 --> 0:04:39,000
In fact, it may be the biggest obstacle of all.

85
0:04:39.432,000 --> 0:04:4,000
How do we deploy this superweapon?

86
0:04:41.43,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I mean, every good weapon needs to be targeted,

87
0:04:44.008,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we have to target this superweapon to the supervillain cells

88
0:04:48.097,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that reside in the tumor.

89
0:04:50.071,000 --> 0:04:53,000
But our bodies have a natural immune-defense system:

90
0:04:53.916,000 --> 0:04:54,000
cells that reside in the bloodstream

91
0:04:55.891,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and pick out things that don't belong,

92
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
so that it can destroy or eliminate them.

93
0:05:00.583,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And guess what? Our nanoparticle is considered a foreign object.

94
0:05:05.718,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We have to sneak our nanoparticle past the tumor defense system.

95
0:05:09.841,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We have to get it past this mechanism of getting rid of the foreign object

96
0:05:16.119,000 --> 0:05:17,000
by disguising it.

97
0:05:17.563,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So we add one more negatively charged layer

98
0:05:21.932,000 --> 0:05:22,000
around this nanoparticle,

99
0:05:23.28,000 --> 0:05:24,000
which serves two purposes.

100
0:05:25.14,000 --> 0:05:28,000
First, this outer layer is one of the naturally charged,

101
0:05:29.132,000 --> 0:05:32,000
highly hydrated polysaccharides that resides in our body.

102
0:05:33.456,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It creates a cloud of water molecules around the nanoparticle

103
0:05:38.313,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that gives us an invisibility cloaking effect.

104
0:05:42.257,000 --> 0:05:44,000
This invisibility cloak allows the nanoparticle

105
0:05:44.998,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to travel through the bloodstream

106
0:05:46.628,000 --> 0:05:48,000
long and far enough to reach the tumor,

107
0:05:49.417,000 --> 0:05:51,000
without getting eliminated by the body.

108
0:05:52.121,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Second, this layer contains molecules

109
0:05:56.537,000 --> 0:05:59,000
which bind specifically to our tumor cell.

110
0:06:00.19,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Once bound, the cancer cell takes up the nanoparticle,

111
0:06:04.734,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and now we have our nanoparticle inside the cancer cell

112
0:06:09.132,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and ready to deploy.

113
0:06:11.304,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Alright! I feel the same way. Let's go!

114
0:06:13.565,000 --> 0:06:19,000
(Applause)

115
0:06:20.057,000 --> 0:06:23,000
The siRNA is deployed first.

116
0:06:24.287,000 --> 0:06:25,000
It acts for hours,

117
0:06:25.937,000 --> 0:06:29,000
giving enough time to silence and block those survival genes.

118
0:06:31.398,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We have now disabled those genetic superpowers.

119
0:06:35.725,000 --> 0:06:38,000
What remains is a cancer cell with no special defenses.

120
0:06:38.978,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Then, the chemotherapy drug comes out of the core

121
0:06:41.904,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and destroys the tumor cell cleanly and efficiently.

122
0:06:46.228,000 --> 0:06:48,000
With sufficient gene blockers,

123
0:06:48.589,000 --> 0:06:51,000
we can address many different kinds of mutations,

124
0:06:51.823,000 --> 0:06:53,000
allowing the chance to sweep out tumors,

125
0:06:54.208,000 --> 0:06:56,000
without leaving behind any bad guys.

126
0:06:56.811,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So, how does our strategy work?

127
0:07:01.543,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We've tested these nanostructure particles in animals

128
0:07:05.528,000 --> 0:07:08,000
using a highly aggressive form of triple-negative breast cancer.

129
0:07:09.135,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This triple-negative breast cancer exhibits the gene

130
0:07:11.714,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that spits out cancer drug as soon as it is delivered.

131
0:07:15.742,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Usually, doxorubicin -- let's call it "dox" -- is the cancer drug

132
0:07:20.937,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that is the first line of treatment for breast cancer.

133
0:07:24.178,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So, we first treated our animals with a dox core, dox only.

134
0:07:30.661,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The tumor slowed their rate of growth,

135
0:07:32.892,000 --> 0:07:33,000
but they still grew rapidly,

136
0:07:34.356,000 --> 0:07:36,000
doubling in size over a period of two weeks.

137
0:07:37.297,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Then, we tried our combination superweapon.

138
0:07:41.415,000 --> 0:07:45,000
A nanolayer particle with siRNA against the chemo pump,

139
0:07:45.851,000 --> 0:07:47,000
plus, we have the dox in the core.

140
0:07:48.87,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And look -- we found that not only did the tumors stop growing,

141
0:07:53.209,000 --> 0:07:55,000
they actually decreased in size

142
0:07:55.749,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and were eliminated in some cases.

143
0:07:58.188,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The tumors were actually regressing.

144
0:08:01.859,000 --> 0:08:07,000
(Applause)

145
0:08:09.82,000 --> 0:08:12,000
What's great about this approach is that it can be personalized.

146
0:08:13.652,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We can add many different layers of siRNA

147
0:08:16.512,000 --> 0:08:19,000
to address different mutations and tumor defense mechanisms.

148
0:08:20.094,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And we can put different drugs into the nanoparticle core.

149
0:08:23.946,000 --> 0:08:26,000
As doctors learn how to test patients

150
0:08:27.177,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and understand certain tumor genetic types,

151
0:08:30.975,000 --> 0:08:33,000
they can help us determine which patients can benefit from this strategy

152
0:08:34.741,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and which gene blockers we can use.

153
0:08:38.41,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Ovarian cancer strikes a special chord with me.

154
0:08:41.337,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It is a very aggressive cancer,

155
0:08:43.334,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in part because it's discovered at very late stages,

156
0:08:46.243,000 --> 0:08:47,000
when it's highly advanced

157
0:08:47.714,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and there are a number of genetic mutations.

158
0:08:50.566,000 --> 0:08:52,000
After the first round of chemotherapy,

159
0:08:53.579,000 --> 0:08:57,000
this cancer comes back for 75 percent of patients.

160
0:08:58.333,000 --> 0:09:,000
And it usually comes back in a drug-resistant form.

161
0:09:02.215,000 --> 0:09:03,000
High-grade ovarian cancer

162
0:09:03.933,000 --> 0:09:05,000
is one of the biggest supervillains out there.

163
0:09:06.124,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And we're now directing our superweapon

164
0:09:08.06,000 --> 0:09:09,000
toward its defeat.

165
0:09:11.375,000 --> 0:09:12,000
As a researcher,

166
0:09:12.661,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I usually don't get to work with patients.

167
0:09:16.164,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But I recently met a mother

168
0:09:18.605,000 --> 0:09:22,000
who is an ovarian cancer survivor, Mimi, and her daughter, Paige.

169
0:09:24.257,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I was deeply inspired by the optimism and strength

170
0:09:28.385,000 --> 0:09:3,000
that both mother and daughter displayed

171
0:09:31.495,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and by their story of courage and support.

172
0:09:35.119,000 --> 0:09:38,000
At this event, we spoke about the different technologies

173
0:09:38.546,000 --> 0:09:39,000
directed at cancer.

174
0:09:40.355,000 --> 0:09:41,000
And Mimi was in tears

175
0:09:41.688,000 --> 0:09:43,000
as she explained how learning about these efforts

176
0:09:44.539,000 --> 0:09:46,000
gives her hope for future generations,

177
0:09:46.773,000 --> 0:09:47,000
including her own daughter.

178
0:09:49.449,000 --> 0:09:5,000
This really touched me.

179
0:09:51.524,000 --> 0:09:54,000
It's not just about building really elegant science.

180
0:09:55.14,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It's about changing people's lives.

181
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It's about understanding the power of engineering

182
0:10:01.565,000 --> 0:10:02,000
on the scale of molecules.

183
0:10:03.47,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I know that as students like Paige move forward in their careers,

184
0:10:07.577,000 --> 0:10:08,000
they'll open new possibilities

185
0:10:09.041,000 --> 0:10:12,000
in addressing some of the big health problems in the world --

186
0:10:12.455,000 --> 0:10:16,000
including ovarian cancer, neurological disorders, infectious disease --

187
0:10:18.104,000 --> 0:10:21,000
just as chemical engineering has found a way to open doors for me,

188
0:10:22.437,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and has provided a way of engineering

189
0:10:25.095,000 --> 0:10:28,000
on the tiniest scale, that of molecules,

190
0:10:28.651,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to heal on the human scale.

191
0:10:31.797,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Thank you.

192
0:10:32.979,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Applause)

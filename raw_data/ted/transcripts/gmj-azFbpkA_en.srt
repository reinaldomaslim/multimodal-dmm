1
0:00:12.96,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So a while ago, I tried an experiment.

2
0:00:16.64,000 --> 0:00:19,000
For one year, I would say yes to all the things that scared me.

3
0:00:20.72,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Anything that made me nervous, took me out of my comfort zone,

4
0:00:24.08,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I forced myself to say yes to.

5
0:00:26.36,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Did I want to speak in public?

6
0:00:28.04,000 --> 0:00:29,000
No, but yes.

7
0:00:30.28,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Did I want to be on live TV?

8
0:00:32.2,000 --> 0:00:33,000
No, but yes.

9
0:00:34.48,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Did I want to try acting?

10
0:00:36.32,000 --> 0:00:39,000
No, no, no, but yes, yes, yes.

11
0:00:39.4,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And a crazy thing happened:

12
0:00:41.48,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the very act of doing the thing that scared me

13
0:00:44.24,000 --> 0:00:45,000
undid the fear,

14
0:00:45.92,000 --> 0:00:46,000
made it not scary.

15
0:00:47.48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
My fear of public speaking, my social anxiety, poof, gone.

16
0:00:52.6,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It's amazing, the power of one word.

17
0:00:55.6,000 --> 0:00:57,000
"Yes" changed my life.

18
0:00:57.76,000 --> 0:00:58,000
"Yes" changed me.

19
0:00:59.48,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But there was one particular yes

20
0:01:01.88,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that affected my life in the most profound way,

21
0:01:04.84,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in a way I never imagined,

22
0:01:06.68,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and it started with a question from my toddler.

23
0:01:10.44,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I have these three amazing daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson,

24
0:01:13.76,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and Emerson is a toddler who inexplicably refers to everyone as "honey."

25
0:01:17.28,000 --> 0:01:18,000
as though she's a Southern waitress.

26
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:20.4,000 --> 0:01:22,000
"Honey, I'm gonna need some milk for my sippy cup."

28
0:01:23.24,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

29
0:01:24.88,000 --> 0:01:27,000
The Southern waitress asked me to play with her one evening

30
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
when I was on my way somewhere, and I said, "Yes."

31
0:01:30.96,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And that yes was the beginning of a new way of life for my family.

32
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I made a vow that from now on,

33
0:01:37,000 --> 0:01:39,000
every time one of my children asks me to play,

34
0:01:39.36,000 --> 0:01:41,000
no matter what I'm doing or where I'm going,

35
0:01:41.92,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I say yes, every single time.

36
0:01:46.28,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Almost. I'm not perfect at it, but I try hard to practice it.

37
0:01:49.92,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And it's had a magical effect on me,

38
0:01:52.36,000 --> 0:01:54,000
on my children, on our family.

39
0:01:55.52,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But it's also had a stunning side effect,

40
0:01:58.48,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and it wasn't until recently that I fully understood it,

41
0:02:02.08,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that I understood that saying yes to playing with my children

42
0:02:05.68,000 --> 0:02:07,000
likely saved my career.

43
0:02:08.76,000 --> 0:02:11,000
See, I have what most people would call a dream job.

44
0:02:11.92,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I'm a writer. I imagine. I make stuff up for a living.

45
0:02:14.72,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Dream job.

46
0:02:16.2,000 --> 0:02:17,000
No.

47
0:02:17.56,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I'm a titan.

48
0:02:19.32,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Dream job.

49
0:02:20.68,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I create television. I executive produce television.

50
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
I make television, a great deal of television.

51
0:02:26.28,000 --> 0:02:27,000
In one way or another, this TV season,

52
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I'm responsible for bringing about 70 hours of programming to the world.

53
0:02:31.72,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV --

54
0:02:33.8,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Applause)

55
0:02:34.84,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Three shows in production at a time, sometimes four.

56
0:02:37.32,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Each show creates hundreds of jobs that didn't exist before.

57
0:02:40.68,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The budget for one episode of network television

58
0:02:42.96,000 --> 0:02:44,000
can be anywhere from three to six million dollars.

59
0:02:45.36,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Let's just say five.

60
0:02:46.64,000 --> 0:02:48,000
A new episode made every nine days times four shows,

61
0:02:49.12,000 --> 0:02:52,000
so every nine days that's 20 million dollars worth of television,

62
0:02:52.2,000 --> 0:02:53,000
four television programs, 70 hours of TV,

63
0:02:54.2,000 --> 0:02:56,000
three shows in production at a time, sometimes four,

64
0:02:56.68,000 --> 0:02:57,000
16 episodes going on at all times:

65
0:02:58.4,000 --> 0:03:,000
24 episodes of "Grey's," 21 episodes of "Scandal,"

66
0:03:00.8,000 --> 0:03:02,000
15 episodes of "How To Get Away With Murder,"

67
0:03:03.08,000 --> 0:03:05,000
10 episodes of "The Catch," that's 70 hours of TV,

68
0:03:05.48,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that's 350 million dollars for a season.

69
0:03:07.44,000 --> 0:03:08,000
In America, my television shows

70
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:11,000
are back to back to back on Thursday night.

71
0:03:11.04,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Around the world, my shows air in 256 territories in 67 languages

72
0:03:14.84,000 --> 0:03:15,000
for an audience of 30 million people.

73
0:03:16.68,000 --> 0:03:17,000
My brain is global,

74
0:03:18.88,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and 45 hours of that 70 hours of TV are shows I personally created

75
0:03:22.24,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and not just produced, so on top of everything else,

76
0:03:24.72,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I need to find time, real quiet, creative time,

77
0:03:28.28,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to gather my fans around the campfire

78
0:03:30.48,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and tell my stories.

79
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV,

80
0:03:34.137,000 --> 0:03:35,000
three shows in production at a time,

81
0:03:35.88,000 --> 0:03:39,000
sometimes four, 350 million dollars, campfires burning all over the world.

82
0:03:40.64,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You know who else is doing that?

83
0:03:42.8,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Nobody, so like I said, I'm a titan.

84
0:03:45.56,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Dream job.

85
0:03:46.84,000 --> 0:03:47,000
(Applause)

86
0:03:48.08,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Now, I don't tell you this to impress you.

87
0:03:50.36,000 --> 0:03:54,000
I tell you this because I know what you think of when you hear the word "writer."

88
0:03:54.52,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I tell you this so that all of you out there who work so hard,

89
0:03:57.449,000 --> 0:04:,000
whether you run a company or a country or a classroom

90
0:04:00.88,000 --> 0:04:02,000
or a store or a home,

91
0:04:03.4,000 --> 0:04:05,000
take me seriously when I talk about working,

92
0:04:06.12,000 --> 0:04:09,000
so you'll get that I don't peck at a computer and imagine all day,

93
0:04:10.12,000 --> 0:04:11,000
so you'll hear me when I say

94
0:04:12.04,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that I understand that a dream job is not about dreaming.

95
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It's all job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat, no tears.

96
0:04:21.44,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I work a lot, very hard, and I love it.

97
0:04:25.84,000 --> 0:04:27,000
When I'm hard at work, when I'm deep in it,

98
0:04:28.2,000 --> 0:04:3,000
there is no other feeling.

99
0:04:30.72,000 --> 0:04:33,000
For me, my work is at all times building a nation out of thin air.

100
0:04:34.2,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It is manning the troops. It is painting a canvas.

101
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It is hitting every high note. It is running a marathon.

102
0:04:39.68,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It is being Beyoncé.

103
0:04:41.32,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And it is all of those things at the same time.

104
0:04:44.92,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I love working.

105
0:04:46.6,000 --> 0:04:49,000
It is creative and mechanical and exhausting and exhilarating

106
0:04:49.68,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and hilarious and disturbing and clinical and maternal

107
0:04:52.28,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and cruel and judicious,

108
0:04:53.68,000 --> 0:04:56,000
and what makes it all so good is the hum.

109
0:04:57.64,000 --> 0:05:,000
There is some kind of shift inside me when the work gets good.

110
0:05:00.88,000 --> 0:05:01,000
A hum begins in my brain,

111
0:05:02.8,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and it grows and it grows and that hum sounds like the open road,

112
0:05:06.52,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and I could drive it forever.

113
0:05:09.4,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And a lot of people, when I try to explain the hum,

114
0:05:12.52,000 --> 0:05:14,000
they assume that I'm talking about the writing,

115
0:05:14.76,000 --> 0:05:15,000
that my writing brings me joy.

116
0:05:16.24,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And don't get me wrong, it does.

117
0:05:19.4,000 --> 0:05:2,000
But the hum --

118
0:05:21.64,000 --> 0:05:23,000
it wasn't until I started making television

119
0:05:23.68,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that I started working, working and making

120
0:05:25.92,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and building and creating and collaborating,

121
0:05:28.56,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that I discovered this thing, this buzz, this rush, this hum.

122
0:05:33.8,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The hum is more than writing.

123
0:05:35.84,000 --> 0:05:38,000
The hum is action and activity. The hum is a drug.

124
0:05:39.12,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The hum is music. The hum is light and air.

125
0:05:41.76,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The hum is God's whisper right in my ear.

126
0:05:45.68,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And when you have a hum like that,

127
0:05:48.12,000 --> 0:05:5,000
you can't help but strive for greatness.

128
0:05:50.68,000 --> 0:05:54,000
That feeling, you can't help but strive for greatness at any cost.

129
0:05:56.12,000 --> 0:05:57,000
That's called the hum.

130
0:05:58.12,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Or, maybe it's called being a workaholic.

131
0:06:01.72,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:03.4,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Maybe it's called genius.

133
0:06:06.2,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Maybe it's called ego.

134
0:06:08.52,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Maybe it's just fear of failure.

135
0:06:11.68,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I don't know.

136
0:06:13.32,000 --> 0:06:16,000
I just know that I'm not built for failure,

137
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and I just know that I love the hum.

138
0:06:19.84,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I just know that I want to tell you I'm a titan,

139
0:06:22.12,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and I know that I don't want to question it.

140
0:06:24.6,000 --> 0:06:25,000
But here's the thing:

141
0:06:27.08,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the more successful I become,

142
0:06:28.92,000 --> 0:06:31,000
the more shows, the more episodes, the more barriers broken,

143
0:06:32.56,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the more work there is to do,

144
0:06:34.76,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the more balls in the air,

145
0:06:36.04,000 --> 0:06:38,000
the more eyes on me, the more history stares,

146
0:06:38.96,000 --> 0:06:39,000
the more expectations there are.

147
0:06:41.28,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The more I work to be successful,

148
0:06:43.4,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the more I need to work.

149
0:06:45.92,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And what did I say about work?

150
0:06:47.68,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I love working, right?

151
0:06:49.64,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running,

152
0:06:52.04,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum,

153
0:06:54.28,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the hum, the hum.

154
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:58,000
I like that hum. I love that hum.

155
0:06:58.24,000 --> 0:07:,000
I need that hum. I am that hum.

156
0:07:01.6,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Am I nothing but that hum?

157
0:07:05.32,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And then the hum stopped.

158
0:07:07.68,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Overworked, overused,

159
0:07:10.12,000 --> 0:07:11,000
overdone, burned out.

160
0:07:11.44,000 --> 0:07:13,000
The hum stopped.

161
0:07:15.08,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Now, my three daughters are used to the truth

162
0:07:17.68,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that their mother is a single working titan.

163
0:07:20.56,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Harper tells people,

164
0:07:21.8,000 --> 0:07:23,000
"My mom won't be there, but you can text my nanny."

165
0:07:25.24,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And Emerson says, "Honey, I'm wanting to go to ShondaLand."

166
0:07:29.68,000 --> 0:07:3,000
They're children of a titan.

167
0:07:31.08,000 --> 0:07:32,000
They're baby titans.

168
0:07:33.52,000 --> 0:07:36,000
They were 12, 3, and 1 when the hum stopped.

169
0:07:37.72,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The hum of the engine died.

170
0:07:39.8,000 --> 0:07:41,000
I stopped loving work. I couldn't restart the engine.

171
0:07:42.32,000 --> 0:07:43,000
The hum would not come back.

172
0:07:44.32,000 --> 0:07:46,000
My hum was broken.

173
0:07:47.48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I was doing the same things I always did, all the same titan work,

174
0:07:51.32,000 --> 0:07:53,000
15-hour days, working straight through the weekends,

175
0:07:53.8,000 --> 0:07:56,000
no regrets, never surrender, a titan never sleeps, a titan never quits,

176
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
full hearts, clear eyes, yada, whatever.

177
0:08:,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But there was no hum.

178
0:08:02.84,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Inside me was silence.

179
0:08:06.08,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time,

180
0:08:09.8,000 --> 0:08:1,000
sometimes four.

181
0:08:11.04,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three shows in production at a time ...

182
0:08:14.88,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I was the perfect titan.

183
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I was a titan you could take home to your mother.

184
0:08:20.52,000 --> 0:08:23,000
All the colors were the same, and I was no longer having any fun.

185
0:08:24.56,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And it was my life.

186
0:08:26.8,000 --> 0:08:27,000
It was all I did.

187
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I was the hum, and the hum was me.

188
0:08:31.64,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So what do you do when the thing you do,

189
0:08:34.24,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the work you love, starts to taste like dust?

190
0:08:37.88,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Now, I know somebody's out there thinking,

191
0:08:39.96,000 --> 0:08:41,000
"Cry me a river, stupid writer titan lady."

192
0:08:42.36,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Laughter)

193
0:08:44.159,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But you know, you do,

194
0:08:46.24,000 --> 0:08:48,000
if you make, if you work, if you love what you do,

195
0:08:49.039,000 --> 0:08:52,000
being a teacher, being a banker, being a mother, being a painter,

196
0:08:52.12,000 --> 0:08:53,000
being Bill Gates,

197
0:08:53.36,000 --> 0:08:56,000
if you simply love another person and that gives you the hum,

198
0:08:56.72,000 --> 0:08:57,000
if you know the hum,

199
0:08:58.32,000 --> 0:09:02,000
if you know what the hum feels like, if you have been to the hum,

200
0:09:02.36,000 --> 0:09:05,000
when the hum stops, who are you?

201
0:09:06.64,000 --> 0:09:07,000
What are you?

202
0:09:08.76,000 --> 0:09:09,000
What am I?

203
0:09:10.2,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Am I still a titan?

204
0:09:13.08,000 --> 0:09:17,000
If the song of my heart ceases to play, can I survive in the silence?

205
0:09:19.84,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And then my Southern waitress toddler asks me a question.

206
0:09:23.92,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I'm on my way out the door, I'm late, and she says,

207
0:09:27.84,000 --> 0:09:29,000
"Momma, wanna play?"

208
0:09:30.88,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And I'm just about to say no, when I realize two things.

209
0:09:34.24,000 --> 0:09:36,000
One, I'm supposed to say yes to everything,

210
0:09:37.44,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and two, my Southern waitress didn't call me "honey."

211
0:09:41.56,000 --> 0:09:43,000
She's not calling everyone "honey" anymore.

212
0:09:44.64,000 --> 0:09:45,000
When did that happen?

213
0:09:46.36,000 --> 0:09:48,000
I'm missing it, being a titan and mourning my hum,

214
0:09:48.84,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and here she is changing right before my eyes.

215
0:09:52.44,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And so she says, "Momma, wanna play?"

216
0:09:55.96,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And I say, "Yes."

217
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
There's nothing special about it.

218
0:10:00.6,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We play, and we're joined by her sisters,

219
0:10:03.32,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and there's a lot of laughing,

220
0:10:04.8,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and I give a dramatic reading from the book Everybody Poops.

221
0:10:08.44,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Nothing out of the ordinary.

222
0:10:09.84,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Laughter)

223
0:10:10.96,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And yet, it is extraordinary,

224
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
because in my pain and my panic,

225
0:10:15.68,000 --> 0:10:17,000
in the homelessness of my humlessness,

226
0:10:17.76,000 --> 0:10:19,000
I have nothing to do but pay attention.

227
0:10:20.76,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I focus.

228
0:10:22.2,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I am still.

229
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running,

230
0:10:26.56,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the troops, the canvas, the high note does not exist.

231
0:10:30.4,000 --> 0:10:31,000
All that exists are sticky fingers

232
0:10:32.36,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and gooey kisses and tiny voices and crayons

233
0:10:35.72,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and that song about letting go

234
0:10:37.32,000 --> 0:10:4,000
of whatever it is that Frozen girl needs to let go of.

235
0:10:40.36,000 --> 0:10:41,000
(Laughter)

236
0:10:42.32,000 --> 0:10:44,000
It's all peace and simplicity.

237
0:10:45.88,000 --> 0:10:49,000
The air is so rare in this place for me that I can barely breathe.

238
0:10:50.12,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I can barely believe I'm breathing.

239
0:10:52.92,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Play is the opposite of work.

240
0:10:56.52,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And I am happy.

241
0:10:58.68,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Something in me loosens.

242
0:11:00.08,000 --> 0:11:02,000
A door in my brain swings open,

243
0:11:03.32,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and a rush of energy comes.

244
0:11:04.84,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And it's not instantaneous, but it happens, it does happen.

245
0:11:09.12,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I feel it.

246
0:11:10.64,000 --> 0:11:11,000
A hum creeps back.

247
0:11:12.48,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Not at full volume, barely there,

248
0:11:15.2,000 --> 0:11:18,000
it's quiet, and I have to stay very still to hear it, but it is there.

249
0:11:18.52,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Not the hum, but a hum.

250
0:11:21.88,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And now I feel like I know a very magical secret.

251
0:11:25.8,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Well, let's not get carried away.

252
0:11:28.32,000 --> 0:11:31,000
It's just love. That's all it is.

253
0:11:32.24,000 --> 0:11:35,000
No magic. No secret. It's just love.

254
0:11:36.12,000 --> 0:11:37,000
It's just something we forgot.

255
0:11:38.56,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The hum, the work hum, the hum of the titan,

256
0:11:42.08,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that's just a replacement.

257
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:46,000
If I have to ask you who I am,

258
0:11:46.4,000 --> 0:11:47,000
if I have to tell you who I am,

259
0:11:48.36,000 --> 0:11:5,000
if I describe myself in terms of shows

260
0:11:50.84,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and hours of television and how globally badass my brain is,

261
0:11:55.12,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I have forgotten what the real hum is.

262
0:11:58.68,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The hum is not power and the hum is not work-specific.

263
0:12:02.88,000 --> 0:12:03,000
The hum is joy-specific.

264
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
The real hum is love-specific.

265
0:12:07.32,000 --> 0:12:1,000
The hum is the electricity that comes from being excited by life.

266
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:13,000
The real hum is confidence and peace.

267
0:12:13.76,000 --> 0:12:15,000
The real hum ignores the stare of history,

268
0:12:16.28,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and the balls in the air, and the expectation, and the pressure.

269
0:12:19.32,000 --> 0:12:21,000
The real hum is singular and original.

270
0:12:22.48,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The real hum is God's whisper in my ear,

271
0:12:24.56,000 --> 0:12:26,000
but maybe God was whispering the wrong words,

272
0:12:26.96,000 --> 0:12:28,000
because which one of the gods was telling me I was the titan?

273
0:12:30.8,000 --> 0:12:31,000
It's just love.

274
0:12:32.92,000 --> 0:12:34,000
We could all use a little more love,

275
0:12:35.92,000 --> 0:12:36,000
a lot more love.

276
0:12:38.28,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Any time my child asks me to play,

277
0:12:40.92,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I will say yes.

278
0:12:43.24,000 --> 0:12:44,000
I make it a firm rule for one reason,

279
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
to give myself permission,

280
0:12:46.44,000 --> 0:12:48,000
to free me from all of my workaholic guilt.

281
0:12:49.24,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It's a law, so I don't have a choice,

282
0:12:51.56,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and I don't have a choice,

283
0:12:53.72,000 --> 0:12:54,000
not if I want to feel the hum.

284
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I wish it were that easy,

285
0:12:57.76,000 --> 0:13:,000
but I'm not good at playing.

286
0:13:01.36,000 --> 0:13:02,000
I don't like it.

287
0:13:04.44,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I'm not interested in doing it the way I'm interested in doing work.

288
0:13:09.4,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The truth is incredibly humbling and humiliating to face.

289
0:13:12.68,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I don't like playing.

290
0:13:14.44,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I work all the time because I like working.

291
0:13:17.24,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I like working more than I like being at home.

292
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Facing that fact is incredibly difficult to handle,

293
0:13:26.72,000 --> 0:13:32,000
because what kind of person likes working more than being at home?

294
0:13:33.64,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Well, me.

295
0:13:35.92,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I mean, let's be honest, I call myself a titan.

296
0:13:39.2,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I've got issues.

297
0:13:40.6,000 --> 0:13:41,000
(Laughter)

298
0:13:42.24,000 --> 0:13:45,000
And one of those issues isn't that I am too relaxed.

299
0:13:45.28,000 --> 0:13:47,000
(Laughter)

300
0:13:47.4,000 --> 0:13:5,000
We run around the yard, up and back and up and back.

301
0:13:51.72,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We have 30-second dance parties.

302
0:13:54.2,000 --> 0:13:56,000
We sing show tunes. We play with balls.

303
0:13:57.24,000 --> 0:13:59,000
I blow bubbles and they pop them.

304
0:13:59.36,000 --> 0:14:03,000
And I feel stiff and delirious and confused most of the time.

305
0:14:04.8,000 --> 0:14:06,000
I itch for my cell phone always.

306
0:14:08.08,000 --> 0:14:09,000
But it is OK.

307
0:14:09.92,000 --> 0:14:13,000
My tiny humans show me how to live and the hum of the universe fills me up.

308
0:14:14.8,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I play and I play until I begin to wonder

309
0:14:17.8,000 --> 0:14:2,000
why we ever stop playing in the first place.

310
0:14:21.48,000 --> 0:14:22,000
You can do it too,

311
0:14:23.48,000 --> 0:14:25,000
say yes every time your child asks you to play.

312
0:14:27.6,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Are you thinking that maybe I'm an idiot in diamond shoes?

313
0:14:30.52,000 --> 0:14:32,000
You're right, but you can still do this.

314
0:14:33.36,000 --> 0:14:34,000
You have time.

315
0:14:35.04,000 --> 0:14:38,000
You know why? Because you're not Rihanna and you're not a Muppet.

316
0:14:38.8,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Your child does not think you're that interesting.

317
0:14:41.2,000 --> 0:14:42,000
(Laughter)

318
0:14:42.36,000 --> 0:14:43,000
You only need 15 minutes.

319
0:14:44.36,000 --> 0:14:46,000
My two- and four-year-old only ever want to play with me

320
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
for about 15 minutes or so

321
0:14:48.6,000 --> 0:14:51,000
before they think to themselves they want to do something else.

322
0:14:51.64,000 --> 0:14:54,000
It's an amazing 15 minutes, but it's 15 minutes.

323
0:14:55.24,000 --> 0:14:58,000
If I'm not a ladybug or a piece of candy, I'm invisible after 15 minutes.

324
0:14:59.24,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Laughter)

325
0:15:00.28,000 --> 0:15:04,000
And my 13-year-old, if I can get a 13-year-old to talk to me for 15 minutes

326
0:15:05.04,000 --> 0:15:06,000
I'm Parent of the Year.

327
0:15:06.4,000 --> 0:15:07,000
(Laughter)

328
0:15:08.08,000 --> 0:15:09,000
15 minutes is all you need.

329
0:15:09.84,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I can totally pull off 15 minutes of uninterrupted time on my worst day.

330
0:15:15.12,000 --> 0:15:17,000
Uninterrupted is the key.

331
0:15:17.24,000 --> 0:15:19,000
No cell phone, no laundry, no anything.

332
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
You have a busy life. You have to get dinner on the table.

333
0:15:22.92,000 --> 0:15:25,000
You have to force them to bathe. But you can do 15 minutes.

334
0:15:26.08,000 --> 0:15:28,000
My kids are my happy place, they're my world,

335
0:15:28.52,000 --> 0:15:3,000
but it doesn't have to be your kids,

336
0:15:31.04,000 --> 0:15:32,000
the fuel that feeds your hum,

337
0:15:32.48,000 --> 0:15:34,000
the place where life feels more good than not good.

338
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
It's not about playing with your kids,

339
0:15:37.68,000 --> 0:15:38,000
it's about joy.

340
0:15:38.96,000 --> 0:15:4,000
It's about playing in general.

341
0:15:42.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Give yourself the 15 minutes.

342
0:15:44.12,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Find what makes you feel good.

343
0:15:46.32,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Just figure it out and play in that arena.

344
0:15:50.92,000 --> 0:15:54,000
I'm not perfect at it. In fact, I fail as often as I succeed,

345
0:15:55.12,000 --> 0:15:57,000
seeing friends, reading books, staring into space.

346
0:15:58.64,000 --> 0:16:01,000
"Wanna play?" starts to become shorthand for indulging myself

347
0:16:01.72,000 --> 0:16:05,000
in ways I'd given up on right around the time I got my first TV show,

348
0:16:05.96,000 --> 0:16:07,000
right around the time I became a titan-in-training,

349
0:16:08.72,000 --> 0:16:11,000
right around the time I started competing with myself for ways unknown.

350
0:16:13.24,000 --> 0:16:16,000
15 minutes? What could be wrong with giving myself my full attention

351
0:16:16.76,000 --> 0:16:17,000
for 15 minutes?

352
0:16:18.52,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Turns out, nothing.

353
0:16:20.96,000 --> 0:16:24,000
The very act of not working has made it possible for the hum to return,

354
0:16:25.04,000 --> 0:16:28,000
as if the hum's engine could only refuel while I was away.

355
0:16:29.6,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Work doesn't work without play.

356
0:16:33.4,000 --> 0:16:35,000
It takes a little time, but after a few months,

357
0:16:36.6,000 --> 0:16:37,000
one day the floodgates open

358
0:16:38.24,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and there's a rush, and I find myself standing in my office

359
0:16:41.64,000 --> 0:16:45,000
filled with an unfamiliar melody, full on groove inside me,

360
0:16:45.76,000 --> 0:16:47,000
and around me, and it sends me spinning with ideas,

361
0:16:48.56,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and the humming road is open, and I can drive it and drive it,

362
0:16:51.64,000 --> 0:16:52,000
and I love working again.

363
0:16:54,000 --> 0:16:57,000
But now, I like that hum, but I don't love that hum.

364
0:16:57.76,000 --> 0:16:58,000
I don't need that hum.

365
0:16:59.04,000 --> 0:17:02,000
I am not that hum. That hum is not me,

366
0:17:02.24,000 --> 0:17:03,000
not anymore.

367
0:17:04.04,000 --> 0:17:07,000
I am bubbles and sticky fingers and dinners with friends.

368
0:17:07.76,000 --> 0:17:08,000
I am that hum.

369
0:17:09.4,000 --> 0:17:1,000
Life's hum.

370
0:17:10.76,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Love's hum.

371
0:17:12.08,000 --> 0:17:16,000
Work's hum is still a piece of me, it is just no longer all of me,

372
0:17:16.88,000 --> 0:17:17,000
and I am so grateful.

373
0:17:19.2,000 --> 0:17:21,000
And I don't give a crap about being a titan,

374
0:17:21.319,000 --> 0:17:24,000
because I have never once seen a titan play Red Rover, Red Rover.

375
0:17:25.88,000 --> 0:17:29,000
I said yes to less work and more play, and somehow I still run my world.

376
0:17:30.2,000 --> 0:17:32,000
My brain is still global. My campfires still burn.

377
0:17:33.96,000 --> 0:17:36,000
The more I play, the happier I am, and the happier my kids are.

378
0:17:37.92,000 --> 0:17:4,000
The more I play, the more I feel like a good mother.

379
0:17:41.2,000 --> 0:17:43,000
The more I play, the freer my mind becomes.

380
0:17:43.68,000 --> 0:17:44,000
The more I play, the better I work.

381
0:17:45.6,000 --> 0:17:47,000
The more I play, the more I feel the hum,

382
0:17:48.12,000 --> 0:17:5,000
the nation I'm building, the marathon I'm running,

383
0:17:50.52,000 --> 0:17:52,000
the troops, the canvas, the high note, the hum, the hum,

384
0:17:53.164,000 --> 0:17:55,000
the other hum, the real hum,

385
0:17:56,000 --> 0:17:57,000
life's hum.

386
0:17:57.48,000 --> 0:17:58,000
The more I feel that hum,

387
0:17:58.76,000 --> 0:18:01,000
the more this strange, quivering, uncocooned,

388
0:18:02.32,000 --> 0:18:03,000
awkward, brand new,

389
0:18:03.68,000 --> 0:18:05,000
alive non-titan feels like me.

390
0:18:07.12,000 --> 0:18:09,000
The more I feel that hum, the more I know who I am.

391
0:18:10.56,000 --> 0:18:13,000
I'm a writer, I make stuff up, I imagine.

392
0:18:14.4,000 --> 0:18:16,000
That part of the job, that's living the dream.

393
0:18:17.28,000 --> 0:18:19,000
That's the dream of the job.

394
0:18:19.96,000 --> 0:18:21,000
Because a dream job should be a little bit dreamy.

395
0:18:23.84,000 --> 0:18:25,000
I said yes to less work and more play.

396
0:18:27.68,000 --> 0:18:28,000
Titans need not apply.

397
0:18:30.16,000 --> 0:18:31,000
Wanna play?

398
0:18:31.96,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Thank you.

399
0:18:33.2,000 --> 0:18:42,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.751,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This summer I was back in Ohio for a family wedding,

2
0:00:19.784,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and when I was there,

3
0:00:21.985,000 --> 0:00:24,000
there was a meet and greet with Anna and Elsa from "Frozen."

4
0:00:25.478,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Not the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen,"

5
0:00:29.103,000 --> 0:00:31,000
as this was not a Disney-sanctioned event.

6
0:00:31.833,000 --> 0:00:35,000
These two entrepreneurs had a business of running princess parties.

7
0:00:36.433,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Your kid is turning five?

8
0:00:38.017,000 --> 0:00:41,000
They'll come sing some songs, sprinkle some fairy dust, it's great.

9
0:00:41.554,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And they were not about to miss out on the opportunity

10
0:00:45.168,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that was the phenomenon and that was "Frozen."

11
0:00:47.804,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So they get hired by a local toy store,

12
0:00:49.701,000 --> 0:00:5,000
kids come in on a Saturday morning,

13
0:00:51.458,000 --> 0:00:54,000
buy some Disney swag, get their picture taken with the princesses,

14
0:00:54.557,000 --> 0:00:55,000
call it a day.

15
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's like Santa Claus without the seasonal restrictions.

16
0:00:58.857,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:00.463,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And my three-and-a-half-year-old niece Samantha was in the thick of it.

18
0:01:05.55,000 --> 0:01:1,000
She could care less that these two women were signing posters and coloring books

19
0:01:10.672,000 --> 0:01:15,000
as Snow Queen and Princess Ana with one N to avoid copyright lawsuits.

20
0:01:15.956,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:17.123,000 --> 0:01:21,000
According to my niece and the 200-plus kids in the parking lot that day,

22
0:01:21.819,000 --> 0:01:25,000
this was the Anna and Elsa from "Frozen."

23
0:01:27.955,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It is a blazing hot Saturday morning in August in Ohio.

24
0:01:33.598,000 --> 0:01:36,000
We get there at 10 o'clock, the scheduled start time,

25
0:01:36.873,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and we are handed number 59.

26
0:01:39.106,000 --> 0:01:43,000
By 11 o'clock they had called numbers 21 through 25;

27
0:01:43.674,000 --> 0:01:44,000
this was going to be a while,

28
0:01:45.427,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and there is no amount of free face painting or temporary tattoos

29
0:01:49.892,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that could prevent the meltdowns that were occurring outside of the store.

30
0:01:53.397,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:54.972,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So, by 12:30 we get called:

32
0:01:59.114,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"56 to 63, please."

33
0:02:02.316,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And as we walk in, it is a scene I can only describe you

34
0:02:05.678,000 --> 0:02:07,000
as saying it looked like Norway threw up.

35
0:02:08.568,000 --> 0:02:09,000
(Laughter)

36
0:02:09.948,000 --> 0:02:13,000
There were cardboard cut-out snowflakes covering the floor,

37
0:02:14.334,000 --> 0:02:18,000
glitter on every flat surface, and icicles all over the walls.

38
0:02:19.87,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And as we stood in line

39
0:02:21.063,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in an attempt to give my niece a better vantage point

40
0:02:23.596,000 --> 0:02:25,000
than the backside of the mother of number 58,

41
0:02:26.151,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I put her up on my shoulders,

42
0:02:27.88,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and she was instantly riveted by the sight of the princesses.

43
0:02:31.979,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And as we moved forward, her excitement only grew,

44
0:02:34.52,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and as we finally got to the front of the line,

45
0:02:36.804,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and number 58 unfurled her poster to be signed by the princesses,

46
0:02:40.498,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I could literally feel the excitement running through her body.

47
0:02:44.098,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And let's be honest, at that point, I was pretty excited too.

48
0:02:47.063,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:48.458,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I mean, the Scandinavian decadence was mesmerizing.

50
0:02:51.457,000 --> 0:02:52,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:52.626,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So we get to the front of the line,

52
0:02:54.536,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and the haggard clerk turns to my niece and says,

53
0:02:57.546,000 --> 0:02:58,000
"Hi, honey. You're next!

54
0:02:59.366,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Do you want to get down, or you're going to stay

55
0:03:01.656,000 --> 0:03:03,000
on your dad's shoulders for the picture?'

56
0:03:03.913,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:05.4,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And I was, for a lack of a better word, frozen.

58
0:03:09.262,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:10.874,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's amazing that in an unexpected instant we are faced with the question,

60
0:03:15.667,000 --> 0:03:16,000
who am I?

61
0:03:16.998,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Am I an aunt? Or am I an advocate?

62
0:03:20.466,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Millions of people have seen my video about how to have a hard conversation,

63
0:03:24.297,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and there one was, right in front of me.

64
0:03:26.614,000 --> 0:03:27,000
At the same time,

65
0:03:27.686,000 --> 0:03:29,000
there's nothing more important to me than the kids in my life,

66
0:03:30.596,000 --> 0:03:33,000
so I found myself in a situation that we so often find ourselves in,

67
0:03:34.544,000 --> 0:03:37,000
torn between two things, two impossible choices.

68
0:03:37.767,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Would I be an advocate?

69
0:03:39.794,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Would I take my niece off my shoulders and turn to the clerk and explain to her

70
0:03:44.342,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that I was in fact her aunt, not her father,

71
0:03:47.48,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and that she should be more careful

72
0:03:49.849,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and not to jump to gender conclusions based on haircuts and shoulder rides --

73
0:03:54.605,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter) --

74
0:03:55.741,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and while doing that,

75
0:03:57.598,000 --> 0:04:01,000
miss out on what was, to this point, the greatest moment of my niece's life.

76
0:04:03.116,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Or would I be an aunt?

77
0:04:05.206,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Would I brush off that comment, take a million pictures,

78
0:04:08.344,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and not be distracted for an instant from the pure joy of that moment,

79
0:04:13.322,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and by doing that,

80
0:04:14.841,000 --> 0:04:17,000
walk out with the shame that comes up for not standing up for myself,

81
0:04:18.224,000 --> 0:04:2,000
especially in front of my niece.

82
0:04:20.607,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Who was I?

83
0:04:22.41,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Which one was more important? Which role was more worth it?

84
0:04:27.23,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Was I an aunt? Or was I an advocate?

85
0:04:30.219,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And I had a split second to decide.

86
0:04:34.235,000 --> 0:04:35,000
We are taught right now

87
0:04:35.814,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that we are living in a world of constant and increasing polarity.

88
0:04:40.113,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It's so black and white, so us and them, so right and wrong.

89
0:04:45.524,000 --> 0:04:49,000
There is no middle, there is no gray, just polarity.

90
0:04:49.691,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Polarity is a state in which two ideas or opinions

91
0:04:52.132,000 --> 0:04:54,000
are completely opposite from each other;

92
0:04:54.712,000 --> 0:04:56,000
a diametrical opposition.

93
0:04:58.127,000 --> 0:05:,000
Which side are you on?

94
0:05:00.581,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Are you unequivocally and without question antiwar, pro-choice, anti-death penalty,

95
0:05:04.646,000 --> 0:05:07,000
pro-gun regulation, proponent of open borders and pro-union?

96
0:05:08.104,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Or, are you absolutely and uncompromisingly

97
0:05:13.337,000 --> 0:05:15,000
pro-war, pro-life, pro-death penalty,

98
0:05:15.522,000 --> 0:05:17,000
a believer that the Second Amendment is absolute,

99
0:05:17.838,000 --> 0:05:18,000
anti-immigrant and pro-business?

100
0:05:19.542,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It's all or none, you're with us or against us.

101
0:05:21.787,000 --> 0:05:22,000
That is polarity.

102
0:05:24.247,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The problem with polarity and absolutes is that

103
0:05:29.191,000 --> 0:05:34,000
it eliminates the individuality of our human experience

104
0:05:34.355,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and that makes it contradictory to our human nature.

105
0:05:39.187,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But if we are pulled in these two directions,

106
0:05:41.297,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but it's not really where we exist --

107
0:05:43.077,000 --> 0:05:45,000
polarity is not our actual reality --

108
0:05:45.507,000 --> 0:05:46,000
where do we go from there?

109
0:05:46.887,000 --> 0:05:49,000
What's at the other end of that spectrum?

110
0:05:50.368,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I don't think it's an unattainable, harmonious utopia,

111
0:05:54.408,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I think the opposite of polarity is duality.

112
0:05:57.842,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Duality is a state of having two parts,

113
0:06:00.446,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but not in diametrical opposition,

114
0:06:03.73,000 --> 0:06:05,000
in simultaneous existence.

115
0:06:06.676,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Don't think it's possible?

116
0:06:08.663,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Here are the people I know:

117
0:06:10.334,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I know Catholics who are pro-choice, and feminists who wear hijabs,

118
0:06:13.497,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and veterans who are antiwar,

119
0:06:15.202,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and NRA members who think I should be able to get married.

120
0:06:17.987,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Those are the people I know, those are my friends and family,

121
0:06:21.023,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that is the majority of our society, that is you, that is me.

122
0:06:24,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Applause)

123
0:06:32.717,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Duality is the ability to hold both things.

124
0:06:37.886,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But the question is: Can we own our duality?

125
0:06:42.008,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Can we have the courage to hold both things?

126
0:06:46.23,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I work at a restaurant in town,

127
0:06:48.422,000 --> 0:06:5,000
I became really good friends with the busser.

128
0:06:51.032,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I was a server and we had a great relationship,

129
0:06:54.05,000 --> 0:06:55,000
we had a really great time together.

130
0:06:55.99,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Her Spanish was great

131
0:06:59.609,000 --> 0:07:,000
because she was from Mexico.

132
0:07:01.451,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Laughter)

133
0:07:03.313,000 --> 0:07:05,000
That line actually went the other way.

134
0:07:05.747,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Her English was limited, but significantly better than my Spanish.

135
0:07:11.848,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But we were united by our similarities,

136
0:07:15.678,000 --> 0:07:17,000
not separated by our differences.

137
0:07:18.578,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And we were close, even though we came from very different worlds.

138
0:07:21.698,000 --> 0:07:22,000
She was from Mexico,

139
0:07:22.838,000 --> 0:07:25,000
she left her family behind so she could come here

140
0:07:26.169,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and afford them a better life back home.

141
0:07:28.166,000 --> 0:07:3,000
She was a devout conservative Catholic,

142
0:07:31.106,000 --> 0:07:33,000
a believer in traditional family values,

143
0:07:33.826,000 --> 0:07:35,000
stereotypical roles of men and women,

144
0:07:35.933,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and I was, well, me.

145
0:07:38.728,000 --> 0:07:39,000
(Laughter)

146
0:07:40.633,000 --> 0:07:43,000
But the things that bonded us were when she asked about my girlfriend,

147
0:07:44.319,000 --> 0:07:47,000
or she shared pictures that she had from her family back home.

148
0:07:47.788,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Those were the things that brought us together.

149
0:07:50.416,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So one day, we were in the back,

150
0:07:52.003,000 --> 0:07:55,000
scarfing down food as quickly as we could, gathered around a small table,

151
0:07:55.683,000 --> 0:07:56,000
during a very rare lull,

152
0:07:57.313,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and a new guy from the kitchen came over --

153
0:07:59.323,000 --> 0:08:,000
who happened to be her cousin --

154
0:08:00.985,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and sat down with all the bravado and machismo

155
0:08:03.788,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that his 20-year-old body could hold.

156
0:08:05.95,000 --> 0:08:06,000
(Laughter)

157
0:08:07.772,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And he said to her, [in Spanish] "Does Ash have a boyfriend?"

158
0:08:13.904,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And she said, [in Spanish] "No, she has a girlfriend."

159
0:08:19.386,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And he said, [in Spanish] "A girlfriend?!?"

160
0:08:22.912,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And she set down her fork, and locked eyes with him,

161
0:08:26.025,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and said, [in Spanish] "Yes, a girlfriend. That is all."

162
0:08:31.048,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And his smug smile quickly dropped to one of maternal respect,

163
0:08:35.941,000 --> 0:08:38,000
grabbed his plate, walked off, went back to work.

164
0:08:39.144,000 --> 0:08:4,000
She never made eye contact with me.

165
0:08:41.668,000 --> 0:08:42,000
She left, did the same thing --

166
0:08:43.384,000 --> 0:08:46,000
it was a 10-second conversation, such a short interaction.

167
0:08:46.655,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And on paper, she had so much more in common with him:

168
0:08:49.191,000 --> 0:08:54,000
language, culture, history, family, her community was her lifeline here,

169
0:08:54.289,000 --> 0:08:58,000
but her moral compass trumped all of that.

170
0:08:58.461,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And a little bit later, they were joking around in the kitchen in Spanish,

171
0:09:02.124,000 --> 0:09:03,000
that had nothing to do with me,

172
0:09:04.025,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and that is duality.

173
0:09:06.47,000 --> 0:09:1,000
She didn't have to choose some P.C. stance on gayness over her heritage.

174
0:09:10.983,000 --> 0:09:13,000
She didn't have to choose her family over our friendship.

175
0:09:14.134,000 --> 0:09:16,000
It wasn't Jesus or Ash.

176
0:09:16.409,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Laughter)

177
0:09:20.556,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Applause)

178
0:09:27.183,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Her individual morality was so strongly rooted

179
0:09:31.761,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that she had the courage to hold both things.

180
0:09:35.143,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Our moral integrity is our responsibility

181
0:09:38.325,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and we must be prepared to defend it even when it's not convenient.

182
0:09:42.557,000 --> 0:09:45,000
That's what it means to be an ally, and if you're going to be an ally,

183
0:09:45.87,000 --> 0:09:47,000
you have to be an active ally:

184
0:09:48.158,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Ask questions, act when you hear something inappropriate,

185
0:09:52.046,000 --> 0:09:54,000
actually engage.

186
0:09:54.075,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I had a family friend who for years used to call my girlfriend my lover.

187
0:10:00.531,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Really? Lover?

188
0:10:02.976,000 --> 0:10:04,000
So overly sexual,

189
0:10:05.001,000 --> 0:10:07,000
so '70s gay porn.

190
0:10:07.047,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Laughter)

191
0:10:11.293,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But she was trying, and she asked.

192
0:10:13.789,000 --> 0:10:14,000
She could have called her my friend,

193
0:10:15.573,000 --> 0:10:19,000
or my "friend," or my "special friend" --

194
0:10:19.708,000 --> 0:10:2,000
(Laughter) --

195
0:10:21.093,000 --> 0:10:23,000
or even worse, just not asked at all.

196
0:10:24.059,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Believe me, we would rather have you ask.

197
0:10:27.69,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I would rather have her say lover, than say nothing at all.

198
0:10:32.932,000 --> 0:10:35,000
People often say to me, "Well, Ash, I don't care.

199
0:10:35.964,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I don't see race or religion or sexuality.

200
0:10:39.757,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It doesn't matter to me. I don't see it."

201
0:10:43.91,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But I think the opposite of homophobia and racism and xenophobia is not love,

202
0:10:49.245,000 --> 0:10:5,000
it's apathy.

203
0:10:50.859,000 --> 0:10:54,000
If you don't see my gayness, then you don't see me.

204
0:10:54.963,000 --> 0:10:56,000
If it doesn't matter to you who I sleep with,

205
0:10:57.949,000 --> 0:10:59,000
then you cannot imagine what it feels like

206
0:11:00.135,000 --> 0:11:02,000
when I walk down the street late at night holding her hand,

207
0:11:03.011,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and approach a group of people and have to make the decision

208
0:11:05.829,000 --> 0:11:07,000
if I should hang on to it or if I should I drop it

209
0:11:08.175,000 --> 0:11:1,000
when all I want to do is squeeze it tighter.

210
0:11:10.494,000 --> 0:11:12,000
And the small victory I feel

211
0:11:13.012,000 --> 0:11:15,000
when I make it by and don't have to let go.

212
0:11:15.72,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And the incredible cowardice and disappointment I feel when I drop it.

213
0:11:20.839,000 --> 0:11:21,000
If you do not see that struggle

214
0:11:22.788,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that is unique to my human experience because I am gay, then you don't see me.

215
0:11:29.264,000 --> 0:11:34,000
If you are going to be an ally, I need you to see me.

216
0:11:34.679,000 --> 0:11:36,000
As individuals, as allies, as humans,

217
0:11:37.622,000 --> 0:11:4,000
we need to be able to hold both things:

218
0:11:40.622,000 --> 0:11:42,000
both the good and the bad,

219
0:11:43.07,000 --> 0:11:44,000
the easy and the hard.

220
0:11:44.9,000 --> 0:11:48,000
You don't learn how to hold two things just from the fluff,

221
0:11:49.372,000 --> 0:11:51,000
you learn it from the grit.

222
0:11:51.774,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And what if duality is just the first step?

223
0:11:56.308,000 --> 0:12:,000
What if through compassion and empathy and human interaction

224
0:12:01.138,000 --> 0:12:03,000
we are able to learn to hold two things?

225
0:12:03.533,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And if we can hold two things, we can hold four,

226
0:12:05.848,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and if we can hold four, we can hold eight,

227
0:12:07.859,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and if we can hold eight, we can hold hundreds.

228
0:12:10.1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We are complex individuals,

229
0:12:12.562,000 --> 0:12:13,000
swirls of contradiction.

230
0:12:14.362,000 --> 0:12:16,000
You are all holding so many things right now.

231
0:12:17.888,000 --> 0:12:2,000
What can you do to hold just a few more?

232
0:12:22.1,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So, back to Toledo, Ohio.

233
0:12:24.237,000 --> 0:12:26,000
I'm at the front of the line,

234
0:12:26.417,000 --> 0:12:3,000
niece on my shoulders, the frazzled clerk calls me Dad.

235
0:12:30.52,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Have you ever been mistaken for the wrong gender?

236
0:12:35.111,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Not even that.

237
0:12:37.31,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Have you ever been called something you are not?

238
0:12:43.509,000 --> 0:12:45,000
Here's what it feels like for me:

239
0:12:46.04,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I am instantly an internal storm of contrasting emotions.

240
0:12:50.114,000 --> 0:12:55,000
I break out into a sweat that is a combination of rage and humiliation,

241
0:12:55.657,000 --> 0:12:57,000
I feel like the entire store is staring at me,

242
0:12:58.618,000 --> 0:13:,000
and I simultaneously feel invisible.

243
0:13:01.179,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I want to explode in a tirade of fury,

244
0:13:04.123,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and I want to crawl under a rock.

245
0:13:06.717,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And top all of that off with the frustration that I'm wearing

246
0:13:09.82,000 --> 0:13:12,000
an out-of-character tight-fitting purple t-shirt,

247
0:13:13.418,000 --> 0:13:15,000
so this whole store can see my boobs,

248
0:13:15.456,000 --> 0:13:18,000
to make sure this exact same thing doesn't happen.

249
0:13:18.458,000 --> 0:13:2,000
(Laughter)

250
0:13:20.64,000 --> 0:13:24,000
But, despite my best efforts to be seen as the gender I am,

251
0:13:24.962,000 --> 0:13:25,000
it still happens.

252
0:13:26.804,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And I hope with every ounce of my body that no one heard --

253
0:13:31.497,000 --> 0:13:35,000
not my sister, not my girlfriend, and certainly not my niece.

254
0:13:36.05,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I am accustomed to this familiar hurt,

255
0:13:38.491,000 --> 0:13:42,000
but I will do whatever I need to do to protect the people I love from it.

256
0:13:43.906,000 --> 0:13:45,000
But then I take my niece off my shoulders,

257
0:13:46.441,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and she runs to Elsa and Anna --

258
0:13:48.616,000 --> 0:13:5,000
the thing she's been waiting so long for --

259
0:13:51.183,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and all that stuff goes away.

260
0:13:53.27,000 --> 0:13:56,000
All that matters is the smile on her face.

261
0:13:56.98,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And as the 30 seconds we waited two and a half hours for comes to a close

262
0:14:02.638,000 --> 0:14:07,000
we gather up our things, and I lock eyes with the clerk again;

263
0:14:07.842,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and she gives me an apologetic smile and mouths,

264
0:14:10.979,000 --> 0:14:12,000
"I am so sorry!"

265
0:14:13.276,000 --> 0:14:15,000
(Laughter)

266
0:14:15.386,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And her humanity, her willingness to admit her mistake disarms me immediately,

267
0:14:21.243,000 --> 0:14:26,000
then I give her a: "It's okay, it happens. But thanks."

268
0:14:26.416,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And I realize in that moment

269
0:14:29.407,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that I don't have to be

270
0:14:31.445,000 --> 0:14:35,000
either an aunt or an advocate, I can be both.

271
0:14:36.903,000 --> 0:14:41,000
I can live in duality, and I can hold two things.

272
0:14:42.252,000 --> 0:14:44,000
And if I can hold two things in that environment,

273
0:14:45.19,000 --> 0:14:47,000
I can hold so many more things.

274
0:14:47.543,000 --> 0:14:5,000
As my girlfriend and my niece hold hands and skip out the front of the door,

275
0:14:51.296,000 --> 0:14:53,000
I turn to my sister and say, "Was it worth it?"

276
0:14:54.04,000 --> 0:14:55,000
And she said, "Are you kidding me?

277
0:14:55.815,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Did you see the look on her face? This was the greatest day of her life!"

278
0:14:59.703,000 --> 0:15:,000
(Laughter)

279
0:15:00.801,000 --> 0:15:02,000
"It was worth the two and a half hours in the heat,

280
0:15:03.759,000 --> 0:15:07,000
it was worth the overpriced coloring book that we already had a copy of."

281
0:15:08.147,000 --> 0:15:09,000
(Laughter)

282
0:15:09.855,000 --> 0:15:12,000
"It was even worth you getting called Dad."

283
0:15:13.51,000 --> 0:15:14,000
(Laughter)

284
0:15:17.205,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And for the first time ever in my life, it actually was.

285
0:15:22.92,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Thank you, Boulder. Have a good night.

286
0:15:25.099,000 --> 0:15:26,000
(Applause)

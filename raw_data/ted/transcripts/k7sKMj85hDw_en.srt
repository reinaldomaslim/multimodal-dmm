0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
About a year ago,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I asked myself a question:

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
"Knowing what I know,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
why am I not a vegetarian?"

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
After all, I'm one of the green guys:

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I started a site called TreeHugger --

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I care about this stuff.

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
can increase my risk of dying by a third.

11
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Cruelty: I knew that the 10 billion

12
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
animals we raise each year for meat

13
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
are raised in factory farm conditions

14
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that we, hypocritically, wouldn't even consider

15
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
for our own cats, dogs and other pets.

16
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Environmentally, meat, amazingly,

17
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
causes more emissions

18
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
than all of transportation combined:

19
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
cars, trains, planes, buses, boats, all of it.

20
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And beef production uses 100 times the water

21
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that most vegetables do.

22
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I also knew that I'm not alone.

23
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We as a society

24
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
are eating twice as much meat

25
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
as we did in the 50s.

26
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So what was once the special little side treat

27
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
now is the main, much more regular.

28
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So really, any of these angles

29
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian.

30
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Yet, there I was -- chk, chk, chk --

31
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
tucking into a big old steak.

32
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So why was I stalling?

33
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I realized that what I was being pitched

34
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
was a binary solution.

35
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It was either

36
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
you're a meat eater or you're a vegetarian,

37
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
and I guess I just wasn't quite ready.

38
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Imagine your last hamburger.

39
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So my common sense,

41
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
my good intentions,

42
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
were in conflict with my taste buds.

43
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And I'd commit to doing it later,

44
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and not surprisingly, later never came.

45
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Sound familiar?

46
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So I wondered,

47
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
might there be a third solution?

48
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And I thought about it, and I came up with one.

49
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I've been doing it for the last year, and it's great.

50
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's called weekday veg.

51
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The name says it all:

52
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Nothing with a face Monday through Friday.

53
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
On the weekend, your choice.

54
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Simple.

55
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
If you want to take it to the next level,

56
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
remember, the major culprits

57
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in terms of environmental damage and health

58
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
are red and processed meats.

59
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So you want to swap those out

60
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
with some good, sustainably harvested fish.

61
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's structured,

62
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
so it ends up being simple to remember,

63
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and it's okay to break it here and there.

64
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
After all, cutting five days a week

65
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake.

66
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
The program has been great, weekday veg.

67
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
My footprint's smaller,

68
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
I'm lessening pollution,

69
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I feel better about the animals,

70
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
I'm even saving money.

71
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Best of all, I'm healthier,

72
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I know that I'm going to live longer,

73
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and I've even lost a little weight.

74
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So, please ask yourselves,

75
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
for your health,

76
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
for your pocketbook,

77
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
for the environment, for the animals:

78
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
What's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot?

79
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
After all, if all of us

80
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
ate half as much meat,

81
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
it would be like half of us

82
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
were vegetarians.

83
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Thank you.

84
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Applause)

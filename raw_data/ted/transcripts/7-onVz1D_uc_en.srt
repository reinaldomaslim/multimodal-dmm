1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I don't know your name. Audience Member: Howard. Howard.

2
0:00:28,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Thom Mayne: Howard? I'm sitting next to Howard. I don't know Howard, obviously,

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and he's going, I hope you're not next.

4
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:42,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Amazing. Amazing performance.

6
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that.

7
0:00:49,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Let me start some place. I'm interested --

8
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I kind of do the same thing, but I don't move my body. (Laughter)

9
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:08,000
And instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space,

10
0:01:09,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I work in the mineral world. I work with more or less inert matter.

11
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And I organize it. And, well, it's also a bit different

12
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:21,000
because an architect versus, let's say, a dance company

13
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:26,000
finally is a negotiation between one's private world,

14
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
one's conceptual world, the world of ideas, the world of aspirations,

15
0:01:31,000 --> 0:01:35,000
of inventions, with the relationship of the exterior world

16
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and all the limitations, the naysayers.

17
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Because I have to say, for my whole career,

18
0:01:43,000 --> 0:01:46,000
if there's anything that's been consistent, it's been that you can't do it.

19
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
No matter what I've done, what I've tried to do,

20
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
everybody says it can't be done.

21
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And it's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various

22
0:01:54,000 --> 0:01:56,000
kind of realities that you confront with your ideas.

23
0:01:56,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And to be an architect, somehow you have to negotiate between left and right,

24
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place

25
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and the outside world, and then make it understood.

26
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I can start any number of places, because this process is also --

27
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I think -- very different from some of the morning sessions,

28
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:21,000
which you had such a kind of very clear, such a lineal idea,

29
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:23,000
like the last one, say, with Howard,

30
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
that I think the creative process in architecture,

31
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
the design process, is extremely circuitous. It's labyrinthine.

32
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It's Calvino's idea of the quickest way between two points

33
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:37,000
is the circuitous line, not the straight line.

34
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And definitely my life has been part of that.

35
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I'm going to start with some simple kind of

36
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:43,000
notions of how we organize things.

37
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But basically, what we do is, we try to give coherence to the world.

38
0:02:47,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We make physical things, buildings

39
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:52,000
that become a part in an accretional process; they make cities.

40
0:02:52,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And those things are the reflection of the processes,

41
0:02:57,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and the time that they are made.

42
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And what I'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world

43
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and the territories which are useful as generative material.

44
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Because, really, all I'm interested in, always, as an architect,

45
0:03:13,000 --> 0:03:17,000
is the way things are produced because that's what I do. Right?

46
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And it's not based on an a priori notion.

47
0:03:19,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain

48
0:03:23,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and saying, "This is what it looks like." In fact, somebody mentioned --

49
0:03:26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Ewan, maybe it was you in your introduction --

50
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:3,000
about this is what architects --

51
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
did somebody say it's what business people come to,

52
0:03:32,000 --> 0:03:34,000
it's what the corporate world comes to

53
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:38,000
when they want to make it look like something at the end of the line? Huh. Wow.

54
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It doesn't work that way for me at all.

55
0:03:4,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I have no interest in that whatsoever.

56
0:03:42,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Architecture is the beginning of something, because it's --

57
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
if you're not involved in first principles,

58
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
if you're not involved in the absolute,

59
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the beginning of that generative process, it's cake decoration.

60
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And I've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators,

61
0:03:56,000 --> 0:03:58,000
if anybody's involved in cake decorations --

62
0:03:58,000 --> 0:04:,000
it's not what I'm interested in doing. (Laughter)

63
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And so, in the formation of things, in giving it form,

64
0:04:05,000 --> 0:04:08,000
in concretizing these things,

65
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
it starts with some notion of how one organizes.

66
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And I've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities

67
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
where a series of forces are brought to bear,

68
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and to understand the nature of the final result of that,

69
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:25,000
representing the building itself.

70
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
There's been a continual relationship between inventions,

71
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:34,000
which are private, and reality, which has been important to me.

72
0:04:34,000 --> 0:04:39,000
A project which is part of an exhibition in Copenhagen 10 years ago,

73
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
which was the modeling of a hippocampus --

74
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the territory of the brain that records short-term memory --

75
0:04:44,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and the documentation of that, the imaginative and documentation of that

76
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:53,000
through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience.

77
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer,

78
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
observing every kilometer a particular object of desire,

79
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and then placing that within this.

80
0:05:02,000 --> 0:05:05,000
And the notion was that I could make an organization

81
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:11,000
not built on normal coherencies, but built on non-sequiturs, built on randomness.

82
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And I'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness

83
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:16,000
as it produces architectural work

84
0:05:16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city,

85
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:2,000
an accretional notion of the city,

86
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:23,000
and that led to various ideas of organization.

87
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And then this led to broader ideas of buildings

88
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that come together through the multiplicity of systems.

89
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And it's not any single system that makes the work.

90
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
It's the relationship -- it's the dynamics between the systems --

91
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
which have the power to transform and invent

92
0:05:39,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and produce an architecture that is -- that would otherwise not exist.

93
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And those systems could be identified,

94
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and they could be grouped together.

95
0:05:48,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And of course, today, with the technology of the computer

96
0:05:51,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and with the rapid prototyping, etc., we have the mechanisms

97
0:05:55,000 --> 0:05:58,000
to understand and to respond to these systems,

98
0:05:58,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities

99
0:06:03,000 --> 0:06:05,000
because that's all we do.

100
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
We're producing spaces that accommodate human activity.

101
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And what I'm interested in is not the styling of that,

102
0:06:11,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity.

103
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And that directly connects to ideas of city-making.

104
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:22,000
This is a project that we just finished in Penang

105
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:26,000
for a very, very large city project that came directly out of this process,

106
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it.

107
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And the project -- again, enormous, enormous competition --

108
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
on the Hudson River and in New York

109
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:39,000
that we were asked to do three years ago, which uses these processes.

110
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And what you're looking at are possibilities that have to do

111
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:48,000
with the generation of the city as one applies a methodology

112
0:06:48,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that uses notions of these multiple forces,

113
0:06:51,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that deals with the enormity of the problem, the complexity of the problem,

114
0:06:56,000 --> 0:06:59,000
when we're designing cities at larger and larger aggregates.

115
0:06:59,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Because one of the issues today is

116
0:07:01,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate,

117
0:07:06,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and as the aggregates get larger we require

118
0:07:08,000 --> 0:07:13,000
more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems.

119
0:07:13,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And that led us directly to the Olympic Village.

120
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
I was in New York on Monday presenting it to the IOC.

121
0:07:19,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We won the competition -- what was it, nine months ago?

122
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Again, a direct reflection from using these processes

123
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to develop extremely complicated, very large-scale organisms.

124
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And then, also, was working with broad strategies.

125
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:39,000
In this case, we only used 15 of the 60 acres of land,

126
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and the 45 acres was a park and would become the legacy of the Olympic Village.

127
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And it would become the second largest park in the boroughs, etc.

128
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Its position, of course, in the middle of Manhattan -- it's on Hunter's Point.

129
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And then the broader ideas of city-making

130
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:58,000
start having direct influences on architecture,

131
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
on the elements that make up the broader scheme,

132
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the buildings themselves, and start guiding us.

133
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces

134
0:08:1,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that could come from literally any place.

135
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And so I can start this discussion in any number of places,

136
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and I've chosen three or four to talk about.

137
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And it has also to do with an interest in

138
0:08:24,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the vast kind of territory that architecture touches.

139
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base.

140
0:08:33,000 --> 0:08:36,000
There's just no place that it doesn't somehow

141
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
have a connective tissue to.

142
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:41,000
This is Jim Dine, and it's the absence of presence, etc.

143
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:45,000
It's the clothing, the skin, without the presence of the character.

144
0:08:45,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work,

145
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface,

146
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded

147
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and made into a very, kind of complex space.

148
0:09:01,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And the idea was the relationship of the space,

149
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
which was made up of the fold of the image,

150
0:09:07,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration,

151
0:09:12,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and the clarity of the image

152
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and the complexity of the space, which were in dialog.

153
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work

154
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and how we make things,

155
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces,

156
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations.

157
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And this was the first prototype in Korea,

158
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
as we're dealing with a dynamic envelope,

159
0:09:37,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and then the same characteristic of the fabric.

160
0:09:4,000 --> 0:09:45,000
It has a material identity and it's translucent and it's porous,

161
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is.

162
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And that turned right away into another project.

163
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This is the Caltrans building in Los Angeles.

164
0:09:54,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And now we're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated.

165
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:,000
Again, it's a very, very simple notion.

166
0:10:,000 --> 0:10:02,000
If you look at most buildings,

167
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:04,000
what you look at is the building, the facade, and it is the building.

168
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And all of a sudden we're kind of moving away,

169
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and we're separating the skin from the body,

170
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and that's going to lead to broader performance criteria,

171
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:12,000
which I'm going to talk about in a minute.

172
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And you're looking at how it drapes over

173
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and differentiates from the body.

174
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And then, again, the building itself,

175
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:22,000
middle of Los Angeles, right across from City Hall.

176
0:10:22,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And as it moves, it takes pieces of the earth with it. It bends up.

177
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It's part of a sign system,

178
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:29,000
which was part of the kind of legacy of Los Angeles --

179
0:10:29,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the two-dimension, three-dimension signing, etc.

180
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
And then it allows one to penetrate the work itself.

181
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's transparent, and it allows you to understand, I think,

182
0:10:41,000 --> 0:10:43,000
what is always the most interesting thing in any building,

183
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:46,000
which is the actual constructional processes that make it.

184
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And it's probably the most intense kind of territory

185
0:10:51,000 --> 0:10:53,000
of the work, which is not occupied,

186
0:10:53,000 --> 0:10:56,000
because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism

187
0:10:56,000 --> 0:10:58,000
when it's separated from function,

188
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
and this is an area that allows for that.

189
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And then the skin starts transforming into other materials.

190
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We're using light as a building material in this case.

191
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We're working with Keith Sonnier in New York,

192
0:11:07,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and we're making this large outside room,

193
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:13,000
which is possible in Los Angeles, and which is very much reflective

194
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:16,000
of the urban, the contemporary urban environments

195
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
that you would find in Shibuya or you'd find in Mexico City

196
0:11:19,000 --> 0:11:21,000
or Sao Paulo, etc.,

197
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time.

198
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And that was very much part of the notion

199
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:3,000
of the urban objective of this project in Los Angeles.

200
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And, again, all of it promoting transparency.

201
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium,

202
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that light becomes literally a building material.

203
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Well, that immediately turned into something much broader, and as a scope.

204
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And again, we're looking at an early sketch

205
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:55,000
where I'm understanding now

206
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower.

207
0:11:58,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This is a building in San Francisco which is under construction.

208
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And now it turned into something much, much broader as a problem,

209
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and it has to do with performance.

210
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:1,000
This will be the first building in the United States that took --

211
0:12:1,000 --> 0:12:12,000
well, I can't say it took the air conditioning out. It's a hybrid.

212
0:12:12,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I wanted a pure thing, and I can't get it.

213
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It's a wrong attitude, actually, because the hybrid is probably more interesting.

214
0:12:17,000 --> 0:12:19,000
But we took the air conditioning out of the tower.

215
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
There's some air conditioning left in the base,

216
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:23,000
but the skin now moves on hydraulics.

217
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:27,000
It forces air through a Venturi force if there's no wind.

218
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It adjusts continually. And we removed the air conditioning.

219
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Huge, huge thing. Half a million dollars a year delta.

220
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:36,000
10 of these -- it's just under a million square feet --

221
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:38,000
800 and some thousand square feet --

222
0:12:38,000 --> 0:12:41,000
10 of these would power Sausalito -- the delta on this.

223
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:44,000
And so now what we're looking at, as the projects get larger in scale,

224
0:12:44,000 --> 0:12:49,000
as they interface with broader problems,

225
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that they expand the capabilities

226
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:54,000
in terms of their performance.

227
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Well, I could also start here.

228
0:12:57,000 --> 0:12:59,000
We could talk about the relationship

229
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:03,000
at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground.

230
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Well, our research -- my generation for sure,

231
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:08,000
people who were going to school in the late '60s --

232
0:13:08,000 --> 0:13:14,000
made very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture,

233
0:13:14,000 --> 0:13:16,000
looking at architecture within its own territory,

234
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and we were much more affected by film,

235
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:2,000
by what was going on in the art world, etc.

236
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:22,000
This is, of course, Michael Heizer.

237
0:13:22,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And when I saw this, first an image and then visited,

238
0:13:26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
it completely changed the way I thought after that point.

239
0:13:3,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And I understood that building really could be

240
0:13:32,000 --> 0:13:34,000
the augmentation of the Earth's surface,

241
0:13:34,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense.

242
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And then -- well, he was probably looking at this -- this is Nazca;

243
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:49,000
this is 700 years ago -- the most amazing four-kilometer land sculptures.

244
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
They're just totally incredible.

245
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw, how we work.

246
0:13:55,000 --> 0:13:58,000
This is the first sketch of a high school in Pomona --

247
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:02,000
well, whatever it is, a model, a conceptual, kind of idea.

248
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And it's the reshaping of the Earth to make it occupiable.

249
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work

250
0:14:11,000 --> 0:14:13,000
in the surface of that Earth.

251
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:16,000
There it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work.

252
0:14:16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And there it is, again, as it's starting to get resolved tectonically,

253
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and then there's the school.

254
0:14:22,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And, of course,

255
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:26,000
we're interested in participating with education.

256
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
I have absolutely no interest in producing a building

257
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:3,000
that just accommodates X, Y and Z function.

258
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:32,000
What I'm interested in are how these ideas

259
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:35,000
participate in the educational process of young people.

260
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:37,000
It demands some sort of notion of inquiry

261
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:39,000
because it's a system that's developed not sculpturally.

262
0:14:39,000 --> 0:14:42,000
It's an idea that started from my first discussion.

263
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:45,000
It has to do with a broad, consistent logic,

264
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building.

265
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:51,000
And there's an overt -- at least,

266
0:14:51,000 --> 0:14:54,000
there's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building

267
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
that connects to the land in a very different way

268
0:14:56,000 --> 0:14:59,000
because I was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem,

269
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:01,000
as one would understand that.

270
0:15:01,000 --> 0:15:03,000
And the second project that was just finished in Los Angeles

271
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:07,000
that uses some of the same ideas. It uses landscape as a major idea.

272
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Then, again, we're doing the headquarters for NOAA --

273
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:13,000
National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Agency --

274
0:15:13,000 --> 0:15:15,000
outside of Washington in Maryland.

275
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And this is how they see the world.

276
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:21,000
They have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles,

277
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:23,000
and the site's in red.

278
0:15:23,000 --> 0:15:26,000
And what we really want to do -- well, the architects,

279
0:15:26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
if there are architects out there, this is the Laugier Hut;

280
0:15:29,000 --> 0:15:31,000
this is the primitive hut that's been around for so long --

281
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:33,000
and what we wanted to do is really build this,

282
0:15:33,000 --> 0:15:37,000
because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world,

283
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and we wanted them to look down at their satellite,

284
0:15:39,000 --> 0:15:41,000
how they see their own site, that eight-acre site,

285
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:44,000
and we wanted nothing left. We wanted it to stay green.

286
0:15:44,000 --> 0:15:46,000
There's actually three baseball fields on it right now,

287
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and they're going to stay there.

288
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:49,000
We put one piece directly north-south,

289
0:15:49,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and it holds the dishes at the ears, right?

290
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And then right below that the processing, and the mission lift,

291
0:15:55,000 --> 0:15:59,000
and the mission control room, and all the other spaces are underground.

292
0:15:59,000 --> 0:16:01,000
And what you look at is an aircraft carrier

293
0:16:01,000 --> 0:16:05,000
that's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes.

294
0:16:05,000 --> 0:16:09,000
And that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion,

295
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
broken up by a series of courts,

296
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:14,000
and it's five acres of uninterrupted, horizontal space

297
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:17,000
for their administrative offices.

298
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:2,000
And then that, in turn, propelled us to look at

299
0:16:2,000 --> 0:16:24,000
larger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface

300
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:26,000
becomes a connective tissue.

301
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
The new capital competition for Berlin, four years ago.

302
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And again we just finished the ECB --

303
0:16:34,000 --> 0:16:37,000
actually Coop Himmelblau in Vienna just won this project,

304
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:43,000
where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements

305
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
that became part of a connective tissue of a park,

306
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:52,000
which is parallel to the river, and develops ideas of the buildings themselves

307
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and becomes part of the connective fabric --

308
0:16:55,000 --> 0:17:,000
the social, cultural and the landscape, recreational fabric of the city.

309
0:17:,000 --> 0:17:02,000
And the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing,

310
0:17:02,000 --> 0:17:04,000
but something that's only inextricably connected

311
0:17:04,000 --> 0:17:06,000
to this city and this place at this time.

312
0:17:06,000 --> 0:17:1,000
And a project that was realized in Austria, the Hooper Bank,

313
0:17:1,000 --> 0:17:13,000
which again used this idea of connecting typology,

314
0:17:13,000 --> 0:17:16,000
the traditional buildings, and morphology,

315
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:19,000
or the relationship of the development of land as an idea,

316
0:17:19,000 --> 0:17:23,000
into a complex, which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it

317
0:17:23,000 --> 0:17:25,000
is literally just this augmenting,

318
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:28,000
this movement of the land that's a very simple idea of

319
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:29,000
just lifting it up and occupying it,

320
0:17:29,000 --> 0:17:32,000
and other parts are much more energetic and intense.

321
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And talk about that intensity

322
0:17:34,000 --> 0:17:38,000
in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make

323
0:17:38,000 --> 0:17:4,000
that have to do with putting a series of systems together,

324
0:17:4,000 --> 0:17:44,000
and then where part of it is in the ground, part of it is oppositional lifts.

325
0:17:44,000 --> 0:17:47,000
One enters the building as it lifts off the ground,

326
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:49,000
and it becomes part of the idea.

327
0:17:49,000 --> 0:17:52,000
And then the skin -- the edges of this --

328
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:55,000
all promote the dynamic, the movement of the building

329
0:17:55,000 --> 0:18:,000
as a series of seismic shifts, geologic shifts. Right?

330
0:18:,000 --> 0:18:04,000
And it makes for event space and then it breaks in places

331
0:18:04,000 --> 0:18:07,000
that allow you to peer into the interior, and those interiors, again,

332
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:09,000
are promoting transparency for the workplace,

333
0:18:09,000 --> 0:18:12,000
which has been a continual interest of ours.

334
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And then, again, in a more, kind of traditional setting,

335
0:18:17,000 --> 0:18:19,000
this is a graduate student housing in Toronto,

336
0:18:19,000 --> 0:18:23,000
and it's very much about the relationship of a building

337
0:18:23,000 --> 0:18:25,000
as it makes a connective tissue to the city.

338
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:28,000
The main idea was the gateway, where it breaks the site,

339
0:18:28,000 --> 0:18:32,000
and the building occupies both the public space and the private space.

340
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:36,000
And it's that territory of -- it's this thing.

341
0:18:36,000 --> 0:18:39,000
I visited the site many times, and everybody, kind of --

342
0:18:39,000 --> 0:18:43,000
you can see this from two kilometers away; it's an exact center of the street,

343
0:18:43,000 --> 0:18:45,000
and the whole notion is to engage the public,

344
0:18:45,000 --> 0:18:5,000
to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city.

345
0:18:51,000 --> 0:18:55,000
And finally, one of the most interesting projects -- it's a courthouse.

346
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:58,000
And what I want to talk about -- this is the Supreme Court, of course --

347
0:18:58,000 --> 0:19:02,000
and, well, I'm dealing with Michael Hogan, the Chief Justice of Oregon.

348
0:19:02,000 --> 0:19:06,000
You could not proceed without making this negotiation

349
0:19:06,000 --> 0:19:1,000
between one's own values and the relationship

350
0:19:1,000 --> 0:19:14,000
of the character you're working with and how he understands the court,

351
0:19:14,000 --> 0:19:17,000
because I'm showing him, of course, Corbusier at Savoy,

352
0:19:17,000 --> 0:19:2,000
which is 1928, which is the beginning of modern architecture.

353
0:19:2,000 --> 0:19:23,000
Well, then we get to this image.

354
0:19:23,000 --> 0:19:27,000
And this is where the project started. Because I'm going,

355
0:19:27,000 --> 0:19:32,000
I'm interested in the phenomenon that's taking place in here.

356
0:19:32,000 --> 0:19:36,000
And really what we're talking about is constructing reality.

357
0:19:36,000 --> 0:19:38,000
And I'm a character that's extremely interested

358
0:19:38,000 --> 0:19:41,000
in understanding the nature of that constructed reality

359
0:19:41,000 --> 0:19:45,000
because there's no such thing as nature any more. Nature is gone.

360
0:19:45,000 --> 0:19:47,000
Nature in the 19th-century sense, alright?

361
0:19:47,000 --> 0:19:5,000
Nature is only a cultural edifice today, right?

362
0:19:5,000 --> 0:19:53,000
We construct it and we construct those ideas.

363
0:19:53,000 --> 0:19:56,000
And then of course, this one, our governor at the moment.

364
0:19:56,000 --> 0:20:01,000
And we spent some time with Conan, believe it or not,

365
0:20:01,000 --> 0:20:05,000
and then that led us to, kind of, the very differences of our worlds

366
0:20:05,000 --> 0:20:07,000
from a legal and an artistic, architectural.

367
0:20:07,000 --> 0:20:11,000
And it forced us to talk about notions of how we work,

368
0:20:11,000 --> 0:20:14,000
and the dynamics of that, and what other sources of the work is.

369
0:20:14,000 --> 0:20:17,000
And it led us to the project, the courthouse,

370
0:20:17,000 --> 0:20:2,000
which is absolutely a part of a negotiation

371
0:20:2,000 --> 0:20:23,000
between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse.

372
0:20:23,000 --> 0:20:25,000
You'll find a stair that's the same length as the Supreme Court.

373
0:20:25,000 --> 0:20:28,000
Here's a piano nobile, which is a device used in the Renaissance.

374
0:20:28,000 --> 0:20:32,000
The courts were made of that. The skin is this series of layers

375
0:20:32,000 --> 0:20:35,000
that reflect even rusticated stonework,

376
0:20:35,000 --> 0:20:39,000
but which were embedded with fragments of the Constitution,

377
0:20:39,000 --> 0:20:41,000
which were part of the little process,

378
0:20:41,000 --> 0:20:43,000
all set on a plinth that defined it from the community.

379
0:20:43,000 --> 0:20:45,000
Thank you so much.

380
0:20:45,000 --> 0:20:48,000
(Applause)

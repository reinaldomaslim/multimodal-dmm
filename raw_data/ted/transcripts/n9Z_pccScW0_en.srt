1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Salaam. Namaskar.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Good morning.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Given my TED profile, you might be expecting

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
that I'm going to speak to you about

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the latest philanthropic trends --

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the one that's currently got Wall Street

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and the World Bank buzzing --

8
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
how to invest in women,

9
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
how to empower them, how to save them.

10
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Not me.

11
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I am interested in how women

12
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
are saving us.

13
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
They're saving us by redefining and re-imagining

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
a future that defies and blurs

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
accepted polarities,

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
polarities we've taken for granted for a long time,

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
like the ones between modernity and tradition,

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
First World and Third World,

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
oppression and opportunity.

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
In the midst of the daunting challenges

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
we face as a global community,

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
there's something about

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
this third way raga

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that is making my heart sing.

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
What intrigues me most

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
is how women are doing this,

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
despite a set of paradoxes

28
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that are both frustrating and fascinating.

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Why is it that women are, on the one hand,

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
viciously oppressed by cultural practices,

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and yet at the same time,

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
are the preservers of cultures in most societies?

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Is the hijab or the headscarf

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
a symbol of submission

35
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
or resistance?

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
When so many women and girls

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
are beaten, raped, maimed

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
on a daily basis

39
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
in the name of all kinds of causes --

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
honor, religion, nationality --

41
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
what allows women to replant trees,

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to rebuild societies,

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
to lead radical, non-violent movements

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
for social change?

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Is it different women

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
who are doing the preserving and the radicalizing?

47
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Or are they one and the same?

48
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Are we guilty, as Chimamanda Adichie reminded us

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
at the TED conference in Oxford,

50
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
of assuming that there is a single story

51
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of women's struggles for their rights

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
while there are, in fact, many?

53
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
And what, if anything,

54
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
do men have to do with it?

55
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Much of my life has been a quest

56
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to get some answers to these questions.

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It's taken me across the globe

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and introduced me to some amazing people.

59
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
In the process, I've gathered a few fragments

60
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that help me shed some light on this puzzle.

61
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Among those who've helped open my eyes

62
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
to a third way

63
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
are: a devout Muslim in Afghanistan,

64
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
a group of harmonizing lesbians in Croatia

65
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and a taboo breaker in Liberia.

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I'm indebted to them,

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
as I am to my parents,

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
who for some set of misdemeanors in their last life,

69
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
were blessed with three daughters in this one.

70
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And for reasons equally unclear to me,

71
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
seem to be inordinately proud of the three of us.

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I was born and raised here in India,

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and I learned from an early age

74
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to be deeply suspicious of the aunties and uncles

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
who would bend down, pat us on the head

76
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and then say to my parents

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
with no problem at all,

78
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
"Poor things. You only have three daughters.

79
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
But you're young, you could still try again."

80
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
My sense of outrage

81
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
about women's rights

82
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
was brought to a boil when I was about 11.

83
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
My aunt, an incredibly articulate

84
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and brilliant woman,

85
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
was widowed early.

86
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
A flock of relatives descended on her.

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
They took off her colorful sari.

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They made her wear a white one.

89
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
They wiped her bindi off her forehead.

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
They broke her bangles.

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Her daughter, Rani,

92
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
a few years older than me,

93
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
sat in her lap bewildered,

94
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
not knowing what had happened

95
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
to the confident woman

96
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
she once knew as her mother.

97
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Late that night, I heard my mother

98
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
begging my father,

99
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
"Please do something Ramu. Can't you intervene?"

100
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And my father, in a low voice, muttering,

101
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
"I'm just the youngest brother, there's nothing I can do.

102
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
This is tradition."

103
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
That's the night I learned the rules

104
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
about what it means to be female in this world.

105
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Women don't make those rules,

106
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
but they define us, and they define

107
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
our opportunities and our chances.

108
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And men are affected by those rules too.

109
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
My father, who had fought in three wars,

110
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
could not save his own sister

111
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
from this suffering.

112
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
By 18,

113
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
under the excellent tutelage of my mother,

114
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I was therefore, as you might expect,

115
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
defiantly feminist.

116
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
On the streets chanting,

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
"[Hindi]

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
[Hindi]

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
We are the women of India.

120
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We are not flowers, we are sparks of change."

121
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
By the time I got to Beijing in 1995,

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
it was clear to me, the only way

123
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to achieve gender equality

124
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
was to overturn centuries

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
of oppressive tradition.

126
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Soon after I returned from Beijing,

127
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I leapt at the chance to work for this wonderful organization,

128
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
founded by women,

129
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to support women's rights organizations around the globe.

130
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
But barely six months into my new job,

131
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I met a woman

132
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
who forced me to challenge all my assumptions.

133
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Her name is Sakena Yacoobi.

134
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
She walked into my office

135
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
at a time when no one knew

136
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
where Afghanistan was in the United States.

137
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
She said to me, "It is not about the burka."

138
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
She was the most determined advocate

139
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
for women's rights I had ever heard.

140
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
She told me women were running underground schools

141
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
in her communities inside Afghanistan,

142
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and that her organization, the Afghan Institute of Learning,

143
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
had started a school in Pakistan.

144
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
She said, "The first thing anyone who is a Muslim knows

145
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
is that the Koran requires

146
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and strongly supports literacy.

147
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
The prophet wanted every believer

148
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
to be able to read the Koran for themselves."

149
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Had I heard right?

150
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Was a women's rights advocate

151
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
invoking religion?

152
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But Sakena defies labels.

153
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
She always wears a headscarf,

154
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
but I've walked alongside with her on a beach

155
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
with her long hair flying in the breeze.

156
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
She starts every lecture with a prayer,

157
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
but she's a single, feisty,

158
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
financially independent woman

159
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
in a country where girls are married off at the age of 12.

160
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
She is also immensely pragmatic.

161
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
"This headscarf and these clothes," she says,

162
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
"give me the freedom to do what I need to do

163
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to speak to those whose support and assistance

164
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
are critical for this work.

165
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
When I had to open the school in the refugee camp,

166
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I went to see the imam.

167
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I told him, 'I'm a believer, and women and children

168
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
in these terrible conditions

169
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
need their faith to survive.'"

170
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
She smiles slyly.

171
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
"He was flattered.

172
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
He began to come twice a week to my center

173
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
because women could not go to the mosque.

174
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And after he would leave,

175
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
women and girls would stay behind.

176
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We began with a small literacy class

177
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to read the Koran,

178
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
then a math class, then an English class, then computer classes.

179
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
In a few weeks, everyone in the refugee camp

180
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
was in our classes."

181
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Sakena is a teacher

182
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
at a time when to educate women

183
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
is a dangerous business in Afghanistan.

184
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
She is on the Taliban's hit list.

185
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I worry about her every time she travels across that country.

186
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
She shrugs when I ask her about safety.

187
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
"Kavita jaan, we cannot allow ourselves to be afraid.

188
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Look at those young girls who go back to school

189
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
when acid is thrown in their face."

190
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And I smile, and I nod,

191
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
realizing I'm watching women and girls

192
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
using their own religious traditions and practices,

193
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
turning them into instruments

194
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
of opposition and opportunity.

195
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Their path is their own

196
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and it looks towards an Afghanistan

197
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that will be different.

198
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Being different is something the women

199
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
of Lesbor in Zagreb, Croatia

200
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
know all too well.

201
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
To be a lesbian, a dyke,

202
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
a homosexual

203
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in most parts of the world, including right here

204
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
in our country, India,

205
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
is to occupy a place of immense discomfort

206
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and extreme prejudice.

207
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
In post-conflict societies like Croatia,

208
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
where a hyper-nationalism and religiosity

209
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
have created an environment unbearable

210
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
for anyone who might

211
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
be considered a social outcast.

212
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So enter a group of out dykes,

213
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
young women who love the old music

214
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that once spread across that region

215
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
from Macedonia to Bosnia,

216
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
from Serbia to Slovenia.

217
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
These folk singers met at college at a gender studies program.

218
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Many are in their 20s, some are mothers.

219
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Many have struggled to come out to their communities,

220
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
in families whose religious beliefs make it hard to accept

221
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that their daughters are not sick,

222
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
just queer.

223
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
As Leah, one of the founders of the group, says,

224
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
"I like traditional music very much.

225
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
I also like rock and roll.

226
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
So Lesbor, we blend the two.

227
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I see traditional music like a kind of rebellion,

228
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in which people can really speak their voice,

229
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
especially traditional songs

230
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
from other parts of the former Yugoslav Republic.

231
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
After the war, lots of these songs were lost,

232
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
but they are a part of our childhood and our history,

233
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and we should not forget them."

234
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Improbably, this LGBT singing choir

235
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
has demonstrated how women

236
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
are investing in tradition to create change,

237
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
like alchemists turning discord into harmony.

238
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Their repertoire includes

239
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
the Croatian national anthem,

240
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
a Bosnian love song

241
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and Serbian duets.

242
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And, Leah adds with a grin,

243
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
"Kavita, we especially are proud of our Christmas music,

244
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
because it shows we are open to religious practices

245
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
even though Catholic Church

246
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
hates us LGBT."

247
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Their concerts draw from

248
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
their own communities, yes,

249
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
but also from an older generation:

250
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
a generation that might be

251
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
suspicious of homosexuality,

252
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but is nostalgic for its own music and the past it represents.

253
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
One father, who had initially balked at his daughter

254
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
coming out in such a choir,

255
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
now writes songs for them.

256
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
In the Middle Ages, troubadours

257
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
would travel across the land

258
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
singing their tales and sharing their verses:

259
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Lesbor travels through the Balkans like this,

260
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
singing, connecting people divided

261
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
by religion, nationality and language.

262
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Bosnians, Croats and Serbs

263
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
find a rare shared space of pride in their history,

264
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and Lesbor reminds them that

265
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
the songs one group often claims as theirs alone

266
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
really belong to them all.

267
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
(Singing)

268
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Yesterday, Mallika Sarabhai showed us

269
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that music can create a world

270
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
more accepting of difference

271
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
than the one we have been given.

272
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The world Leymah Gbowee was given

273
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
was a world at war.

274
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Liberia had been torn apart by civil strife for decades.

275
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Leymah was not an activist, she was a mother of three.

276
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But she was sick with worry:

277
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
She worried her son would be abducted

278
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and taken off to be a child soldier,

279
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
she worried her daughters would be raped,

280
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
she worried for their lives.

281
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
One night, she had a dream.

282
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
She dreamt she and thousands of other women

283
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
ended the bloodshed.

284
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
The next morning at church, she asked others how they felt.

285
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
They were all tired of the fighting.

286
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We need peace, and we need our leaders to know

287
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
we will not rest until there is peace.

288
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Among Leymah's friends was a policewoman who was Muslim.

289
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
She promised to raise the issue with her community.

290
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
At the next Friday sermon,

291
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
the women who were sitting in the side room of the mosque

292
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
began to share their distress at the state of affairs.

293
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
"What does it matter?" they said, "A bullet doesn't distinguish

294
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
between a Muslim and a Christian."

295
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
This small group of women,

296
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
determined to bring an end to the war,

297
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and they chose to use their traditions to make a point:

298
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Liberian women usually wear

299
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
lots of jewelry and colorful clothing.

300
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
But no, for the protest, they dressed

301
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
all in white, no makeup.

302
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
As Leymah said, "We wore the white

303
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
saying we were out for peace."

304
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
They stood on the side of the road on which

305
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Charles Taylor's motorcade passed every day.

306
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
They stood for weeks --

307
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
first just 10, then 20, then 50, then hundreds of women --

308
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
wearing white, singing, dancing,

309
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
saying they were out for peace.

310
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Eventually, opposing forces in Liberia

311
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
were pushed to hold peace talks in Ghana.

312
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The peace talks dragged on and on and on.

313
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Leymah and her sisters had had enough.

314
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
With their remaining funds, they took

315
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
a small group of women down to the venue of the peace talks

316
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and they surrounded the building.

317
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
In a now famous CNN clip,

318
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
you can see them sitting on the ground, their arms linked.

319
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We know this in India. It's called a [Hindi].

320
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Then things get tense.

321
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
The police are called in to physically remove the women.

322
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
As the senior officer approaches with a baton,

323
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Leymah stands up with deliberation,

324
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
reaches her arms up over her head,

325
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and begins, very slowly,

326
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to untie her headdress that covers her hair.

327
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
You can see the policeman's face.

328
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
He looks embarrassed. He backs away.

329
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And the next thing you know,

330
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
the police have disappeared.

331
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Leymah said to me later,

332
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
"It's a taboo, you know, in West Africa.

333
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
If an older woman undresses in front of a man

334
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
because she wants to,

335
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
the man's family is cursed."

336
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Laughter)

337
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
(Applause)

338
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
She said, "I don't know if he did it because he believed,

339
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
but he knew we were not going to leave.

340
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
We were not going to leave until the peace accord was signed."

341
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And the peace accord was signed.

342
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And the women of Liberia

343
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
then mobilized in support of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf,

344
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
a woman who broke a few taboos herself

345
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
becoming the first elected woman head of state

346
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
in Africa in years.

347
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
When she made her presidential address,

348
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
she acknowledged these brave women of Liberia

349
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
who allowed her to win against a football star --

350
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
that's soccer for you Americans --

351
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
no less.

352
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
Women like Sakena and Leah

353
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and Leymah

354
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
have humbled me and changed me

355
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and made me realize that I should not be so quick

356
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
to jump to assumptions of any kind.

357
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
They've also saved me from my righteous anger

358
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
by offering insights into this third way.

359
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
A Filipina activist once said to me,

360
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
"How do you cook a rice cake?

361
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
With heat from the bottom and heat from the top."

362
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
The protests, the marches,

363
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
the uncompromising position that

364
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
women's rights are human rights, full stop.

365
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
That's the heat from the bottom.

366
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
That's Malcolm X and the suffragists

367
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and gay pride parades.

368
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
But we also need the heat from the top.

369
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And in most parts of the world,

370
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
that top is still

371
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
controlled by men.

372
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
So to paraphrase Marx: Women make change,

373
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
but not in circumstances of their own choosing.

374
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
They have to negotiate.

375
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
They have to subvert tradition that once silenced them

376
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
in order to give voice to new aspirations.

377
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
And they need allies from their communities.

378
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Allies like the imam,

379
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
allies like the father who now writes songs

380
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
for a lesbian group in Croatia,

381
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
allies like the policeman who honored a taboo and backed away,

382
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
allies like my father,

383
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
who couldn't help his sister but has helped three daughters

384
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
pursue their dreams.

385
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
Maybe this is because feminism,

386
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
unlike almost every other social movement,

387
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
is not a struggle against a distinct oppressor --

388
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
it's not the ruling class

389
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
or the occupiers or the colonizers --

390
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
it's against a deeply held set of beliefs and assumptions

391
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
that we women, far too often,

392
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
hold ourselves.

393
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
And perhaps this is the ultimate gift of feminism,

394
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
that the personal is in fact the political.

395
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
So that, as Eleanor Roosevelt said once of human rights,

396
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
the same is true of gender equality:

397
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
that it starts in small places, close to home.

398
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
On the streets, yes,

399
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
but also in negotiations at the kitchen table

400
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and in the marital bed

401
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and in relationships between lovers and parents

402
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
and sisters and friends.

403
0:16:57.26,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And then

404
0:16:59.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
you realize that by integrating

405
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
aspects of tradition and community

406
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
into their struggles,

407
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
women like Sakena and Leah and Leymah --

408
0:17:08.26,000 --> 0:17:1,000
but also women like Sonia Gandhi here in India

409
0:17:10.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
and Michelle Bachelet in Chile

410
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:16,000
and Shirin Ebadi in Iran --

411
0:17:16.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
are doing something else.

412
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
They're challenging the very notion

413
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
of Western models of development.

414
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:26,000
They are saying, we don't have to be like you

415
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
to make change.

416
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
We can wear a sari or a hijab

417
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
or pants or a boubou,

418
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
and we can be party leaders and presidents

419
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and human rights lawyers.

420
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
We can use our tradition to navigate change.

421
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
We can demilitarize societies

422
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:46,000
and pour resources, instead,

423
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
into reservoirs of genuine security.

424
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
It is in these little stories,

425
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
these individual stories,

426
0:17:55.26,000 --> 0:17:57,000
that I see a radical epic being written

427
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
by women around the world.

428
0:17:59.26,000 --> 0:18:01,000
It is in these threads

429
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
that are being woven into a resilient fabric

430
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:06,000
that will sustain communities,

431
0:18:06.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
that I find hope.

432
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
And if my heart is singing,

433
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
it's because in these little fragments,

434
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:15,000
every now and again, you catch a glimpse

435
0:18:15.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
of a whole, of a whole new world.

436
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
And she is definitely on her way.

437
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Thank you.

438
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
(Applause)

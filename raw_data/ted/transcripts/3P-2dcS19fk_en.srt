1
0:00:12.92,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Let me tell you about rock snot.

2
0:00:19.08,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Since 1992, Dr. Max Bothwell,

3
0:00:22.64,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a Government of Canada scientist,

4
0:00:25.68,000 --> 0:00:29,000
has been studying a type of algae that grows on rocks.

5
0:00:30.64,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Now, the very unscientific term for that algae is rock snot,

6
0:00:37.24,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because as you can imagine,

7
0:00:39.68,000 --> 0:00:41,000
it looks a lot like snot.

8
0:00:43.08,000 --> 0:00:48,000
But scientists also call it Didymosphenia geminata

9
0:00:48.76,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and for decades, this algae has been sliming up riverbeds

10
0:00:53.12,000 --> 0:00:55,000
around the world.

11
0:00:55.28,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The problem with this algae

12
0:00:57.84,000 --> 0:01:,000
is that it is a threat to salmon, to trout

13
0:01:01.76,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and the river ecosystems it invades.

14
0:01:05.44,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, it turns out Canada's Dr. Bothwell

15
0:01:08.68,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is actually a world expert in the field,

16
0:01:12.88,000 --> 0:01:16,000
so it was no surprise in 2014

17
0:01:17.08,000 --> 0:01:2,000
when a reporter contacted Dr. Bothwell

18
0:01:20.56,000 --> 0:01:22,000
for a story on the algae.

19
0:01:23.88,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The problem was, Dr. Bothwell wasn't allowed to speak to the reporter,

20
0:01:30.56,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because the government of the day wouldn't let him.

21
0:01:35.32,000 --> 0:01:38,000
110 pages of emails

22
0:01:38.76,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and 16 government communication experts

23
0:01:42.72,000 --> 0:01:45,000
stood in Dr. Bothwell's way.

24
0:01:46.8,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Why couldn't Dr. Bothwell speak?

25
0:01:50.08,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Well, we'll never know for sure,

26
0:01:52.92,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but Dr. Bothwell's research did suggest

27
0:01:56.68,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that climate change may have been responsible

28
0:02:00.56,000 --> 0:02:02,000
for the aggressive algae blooms.

29
0:02:03.92,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But who the heck would want to stifle climate change information, right?

30
0:02:12.24,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Yes, you can laugh.

31
0:02:14.08,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's a joke,

32
0:02:16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because it is laughable.

33
0:02:19.76,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We know that climate change is suppressed for all sorts of reasons.

34
0:02:25.2,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I saw it firsthand when I was a university professor.

35
0:02:29.48,000 --> 0:02:34,000
We see it when countries pull out of international climate agreements

36
0:02:35.04,000 --> 0:02:39,000
like the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Accord,

37
0:02:39.2,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and we see it when industry fails to meet its emissions reduction targets.

38
0:02:45.4,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But it's not just climate change information that's being stifled.

39
0:02:50.72,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So many other scientific issues are obscured by alternate facts,

40
0:02:57.4,000 --> 0:03:01,000
fake news and other forms of suppression.

41
0:03:02.2,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We've seen it in the United Kingdom,

42
0:03:04.44,000 --> 0:03:05,000
we've seen it in Russia,

43
0:03:06.4,000 --> 0:03:08,000
we've seen it in the United States

44
0:03:09.04,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and, until 2015,

45
0:03:11.8,000 --> 0:03:13,000
right here in Canada.

46
0:03:15.84,000 --> 0:03:17,000
In our modern technological age,

47
0:03:18.68,000 --> 0:03:22,000
when our very survival depends on discovery,

48
0:03:22.88,000 --> 0:03:24,000
innovation and science,

49
0:03:25.68,000 --> 0:03:29,000
it is critical, absolutely critical,

50
0:03:29.84,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that our scientists are free to undertake their work,

51
0:03:33.88,000 --> 0:03:36,000
free to collaborate with other scientists,

52
0:03:37.2,000 --> 0:03:39,000
free to speak to the media

53
0:03:39.8,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and free to speak to the public.

54
0:03:42.84,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Because after all,

55
0:03:44.64,000 --> 0:03:5,000
science is humanity's best effort at uncovering the truth

56
0:03:50.72,000 --> 0:03:51,000
about our world,

57
0:03:52.28,000 --> 0:03:54,000
about our very existence.

58
0:03:55.04,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Every new fact that is uncovered

59
0:03:57.72,000 --> 0:04:02,000
adds to the growing body of our collective knowledge.

60
0:04:03.56,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Scientists must be free to explore

61
0:04:07.32,000 --> 0:04:11,000
unconventional or controversial topics.

62
0:04:11.72,000 --> 0:04:14,000
They must be free to challenge the thinking of the day

63
0:04:15.4,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and they must be free

64
0:04:16.72,000 --> 0:04:22,000
to present uncomfortable or inconvenient truths,

65
0:04:24.4,000 --> 0:04:26,000
because that's how scientists push boundaries

66
0:04:27.24,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and pushing boundaries is, after all, what science is all about.

67
0:04:32.279,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And here's another point:

68
0:04:34.4,000 --> 0:04:38,000
scientists must be free to fail,

69
0:04:38.88,000 --> 0:04:42,000
because even a failed hypothesis teaches us something.

70
0:04:43.76,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And the best way I can explain that is through one of my own adventures.

71
0:04:48.96,000 --> 0:04:5,000
But first I've got to take you back in time.

72
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It's the early 1900s

73
0:04:55.48,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and Claire and Vera are roommates in southern Ontario.

74
0:05:00.52,000 --> 0:05:04,000
One evening during the height of the Spanish flu pandemic,

75
0:05:04.8,000 --> 0:05:06,000
the two attend a lecture together.

76
0:05:08.28,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The end of the evening, they head for home and for bed.

77
0:05:12.36,000 --> 0:05:15,000
In the morning, Claire calls up to Vera

78
0:05:15.6,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and says she's going out to breakfast.

79
0:05:19.08,000 --> 0:05:22,000
When she returns a short while later,

80
0:05:22.36,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Vera wasn't up.

81
0:05:24.36,000 --> 0:05:27,000
She pulls back the covers

82
0:05:27.4,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and makes the gruesome discovery.

83
0:05:30.72,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Vera was dead.

84
0:05:34.24,000 --> 0:05:36,000
When it comes to Spanish flu,

85
0:05:36.6,000 --> 0:05:38,000
those stories are common,

86
0:05:38.84,000 --> 0:05:41,000
of lightning speed deaths.

87
0:05:42.4,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Well, I was a professor in my mid-20s

88
0:05:45.52,000 --> 0:05:48,000
when I first heard those shocking facts

89
0:05:49.12,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and the scientist in me wanted to know why and how.

90
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:59,000
My curiosity would lead me to a frozen land

91
0:05:59.28,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and to lead an expedition

92
0:06:01.92,000 --> 0:06:05,000
to uncover the cause of the 1918 Spanish flu.

93
0:06:06.12,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I wanted to test our current drugs against one of history's deadliest diseases.

94
0:06:12.4,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I hoped we could make a flu vaccine

95
0:06:15.2,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that would be effective against the virus

96
0:06:18.48,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and mutation of it,

97
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
should it ever return.

98
0:06:24.28,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And so I led a team, a research team,

99
0:06:29.04,000 --> 0:06:31,000
of 17 men

100
0:06:31.6,000 --> 0:06:34,000
from Canada, Norway, the United Kingdom

101
0:06:35.56,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and the United States

102
0:06:37.44,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to the Svalbard Islands in the Arctic Ocean.

103
0:06:41.68,000 --> 0:06:45,000
These islands are between Norway and the North Pole.

104
0:06:46.04,000 --> 0:06:48,000
We exhumed six bodies

105
0:06:49.28,000 --> 0:06:53,000
who had died of Spanish flu and were buried in the permafrost

106
0:06:53.48,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and we hoped the frozen ground would preserve the body and the virus.

107
0:06:59.6,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Now, I know what you are all waiting for,

108
0:07:02.2,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that big scientific payoff.

109
0:07:06.24,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But my science story doesn't have that spectacular Hollywood ending.

110
0:07:12.8,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Most don't.

111
0:07:14.56,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Truth is, we didn't find the virus,

112
0:07:18.4,000 --> 0:07:21,000
but we did develop new techniques

113
0:07:21.6,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to safely exhume bodies

114
0:07:24.24,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that might contain virus.

115
0:07:26.92,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We did develop new techniques

116
0:07:29.64,000 --> 0:07:31,000
to safely remove tissue

117
0:07:32.24,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that might contain virus.

118
0:07:35.28,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And we developed new safety protocols

119
0:07:38.56,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to protect our research team and the nearby community.

120
0:07:44.24,000 --> 0:07:47,000
We made important contributions to science

121
0:07:47.76,000 --> 0:07:5,000
even though the contributions we made

122
0:07:51.28,000 --> 0:07:54,000
were not the ones originally intended.

123
0:07:55.28,000 --> 0:07:58,000
In science, attempts fail,

124
0:07:58.44,000 --> 0:08:,000
results prove inconclusive

125
0:08:01.08,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and theories don't pan out.

126
0:08:04.36,000 --> 0:08:05,000
In science,

127
0:08:07.32,000 --> 0:08:11,000
research builds upon the work and knowledge of others,

128
0:08:11.52,000 --> 0:08:12,000
or by seeing further,

129
0:08:13.08,000 --> 0:08:16,000
by standing on the shoulders of giants,

130
0:08:16.12,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to paraphrase Newton.

131
0:08:18.84,000 --> 0:08:21,000
The point is, scientists must be free

132
0:08:22.48,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to choose what they want to explore,

133
0:08:26.52,000 --> 0:08:28,000
what they are passionate about

134
0:08:28.76,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and they must be free to report their findings.

135
0:08:33.2,000 --> 0:08:34,000
You heard me say

136
0:08:34.48,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that respect for science started to improve in Canada in 2015.

137
0:08:40.72,000 --> 0:08:42,000
How did we get here?

138
0:08:42.76,000 --> 0:08:45,000
What lessons might we have to share?

139
0:08:46.52,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Well, it actually goes back to my time as a professor.

140
0:08:51,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I watched while agencies, governments and industries around the world

141
0:08:56.6,000 --> 0:09:,000
suppressed information on climate change.

142
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
It infuriated me.

143
0:09:03.44,000 --> 0:09:05,000
It kept me up at night.

144
0:09:05.72,000 --> 0:09:11,000
How could politicians twist scientific fact for partisan gain?

145
0:09:13.56,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So I did what anyone appalled by politics would do:

146
0:09:18.24,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I ran for office, and I won.

147
0:09:21.56,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Applause)

148
0:09:27.84,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I thought I would use my new platform

149
0:09:31.4,000 --> 0:09:34,000
to talk about the importance of science.

150
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It quickly became a fight for the freedom of science.

151
0:09:40.52,000 --> 0:09:45,000
After all, I was a scientist, I came from the world under attack,

152
0:09:45.8,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and I had personally felt the outrage.

153
0:09:50.8,000 --> 0:09:54,000
I could be a voice for those who were being silenced.

154
0:09:55.68,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But I quickly learned that scientists were nervous,

155
0:10:00.08,000 --> 0:10:02,000
even afraid to talk to me.

156
0:10:02.84,000 --> 0:10:04,000
One government scientist, a friend of mine,

157
0:10:05.64,000 --> 0:10:06,000
we'll call him McPherson,

158
0:10:08.92,000 --> 0:10:1,000
was concerned about the impact

159
0:10:11.92,000 --> 0:10:15,000
government policies were having on his research

160
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and the state of science deteriorating in Canada.

161
0:10:20.64,000 --> 0:10:23,000
He was so concerned, he wrote to me

162
0:10:23.84,000 --> 0:10:25,000
from his wife's email account

163
0:10:26.84,000 --> 0:10:29,000
because he was afraid a phone call could be traced.

164
0:10:30.48,000 --> 0:10:34,000
He wanted me to phone his wife's cell phone

165
0:10:34.8,000 --> 0:10:37,000
so that call couldn't be traced.

166
0:10:37.88,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I only wish I were kidding.

167
0:10:41.2,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It quickly brought what was happening in Canada into sharp focus for me.

168
0:10:47.36,000 --> 0:10:52,000
How could my friend of 20 years be that afraid to talk to me?

169
0:10:53.36,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So I did what I could at the time.

170
0:10:56.04,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I listened and I shared what I learned

171
0:11:01.72,000 --> 0:11:03,000
with my friend in Parliament,

172
0:11:04.28,000 --> 0:11:07,000
a man who was interested in all things environment, science,

173
0:11:08.24,000 --> 0:11:1,000
technology, innovation.

174
0:11:12.12,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And then the 2015 election rolled around

175
0:11:16.2,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and our party won.

176
0:11:19.4,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And we formed government.

177
0:11:21.6,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And that friend of mine

178
0:11:25.12,000 --> 0:11:28,000
is now the Prime Minister of Canada, Justin Trudeau.

179
0:11:28.84,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Applause)

180
0:11:34.48,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And he asked if I would serve as his Minister of Science.

181
0:11:38.96,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Together, with the rest of the government,

182
0:11:41.8,000 --> 0:11:47,000
we are working hard to restore science to its rightful place.

183
0:11:47.88,000 --> 0:11:52,000
I will never forget that day in December 2015

184
0:11:53.32,000 --> 0:11:56,000
when I proudly stood in Parliament

185
0:11:56.36,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and proclaimed,

186
0:11:57.72,000 --> 0:12:,000
"The war on science is now over."

187
0:12:02.72,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Applause)

188
0:12:08.32,000 --> 0:12:12,000
And I have worked hard to back up those words with actions.

189
0:12:12.6,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We've had many successes.

190
0:12:15.08,000 --> 0:12:17,000
There's still more work to do,

191
0:12:18.64,000 --> 0:12:2,000
because we're building this culture shift.

192
0:12:21.12,000 --> 0:12:26,000
But we want our government scientists to talk to the media, talk to the public.

193
0:12:27.08,000 --> 0:12:3,000
It'll take time, but we are committed.

194
0:12:30.56,000 --> 0:12:36,000
After all, Canada is seen as a beacon for science internationally.

195
0:12:36.96,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And we want to send a message

196
0:12:40.56,000 --> 0:12:44,000
that you do not mess with something so fundamental,

197
0:12:44.84,000 --> 0:12:46,000
so precious, as science.

198
0:12:49.68,000 --> 0:12:54,000
So, for Dr. Bothwell, for Claire and Vera,

199
0:12:54.72,000 --> 0:12:57,000
for McPherson and all those other voices,

200
0:12:58.32,000 --> 0:13:03,000
if you see that science is being stifled, suppressed or attacked,

201
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
speak up.

202
0:13:05.88,000 --> 0:13:1,000
If you see that scientists are being silenced, speak up.

203
0:13:11.56,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We must hold our leaders to account.

204
0:13:15.4,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Whether that is by exercising our right to vote,

205
0:13:19.28,000 --> 0:13:23,000
whether it is by penning an op-ed in a newspaper

206
0:13:23.64,000 --> 0:13:27,000
or by starting a conversation on social media,

207
0:13:28.52,000 --> 0:13:33,000
it is our collective voice that will ensure the freedom of science.

208
0:13:34.52,000 --> 0:13:38,000
And after all, science is for everyone,

209
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and it will lead to a better, brighter, bolder future for us all.

210
0:13:45.92,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Thank you.

211
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:51,000
(Applause)

0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
If nothing else, at least I've discovered

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
what it is we put our speakers through:

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
sweaty palms, sleepless nights,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a wholly unnatural fear of clocks.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I mean, it's quite brutal.

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I'm also a little nervous about this.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
There are nine billion humans coming our way.

8
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now, the most optimistic dreams

9
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
can get dented by the prospect

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
of people plundering the planet.

11
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But recently, I've become intrigued

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
by a different way of thinking of large human crowds,

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
because there are circumstances

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
where they can do something really cool.

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's a phenomenon that I think

16
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
any organization or individual can tap into.

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It certainly impacted the way we think about TED's future,

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and perhaps the world's future overall.

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So, let's explore.

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The story starts with just a single person,

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
a child, behaving a little strangely.

22
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This kid is known online as Lil Demon.

23
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
He's doing tricks here, dance tricks,

24
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that probably no six-year-old in history ever managed before.

25
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
How did he learn them?

26
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And what drove him to spend the hundreds of hours of practice

27
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
this must have taken?

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Here's a clue.

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000

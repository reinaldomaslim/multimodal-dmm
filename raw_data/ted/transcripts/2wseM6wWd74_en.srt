1
0:00:13.484,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Where does the end begin?

2
0:00:15.44,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Well, for me, it all began with this little fellow.

3
0:00:20.24,000 --> 0:00:21,000
This adorable organism --

4
0:00:21.68,000 --> 0:00:22,000
well, I think it's adorable --

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
is called Tetrahymena and it's a single-celled creature.

6
0:00:27.2,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It's also been known as pond scum.

7
0:00:29.12,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So that's right, my career started with pond scum.

8
0:00:33.68,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Now, it was no surprise I became a scientist.

9
0:00:36.76,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Growing up far away from here,

10
0:00:38.88,000 --> 0:00:4,000
as a little girl I was deadly curious

11
0:00:41.8,000 --> 0:00:42,000
about everything alive.

12
0:00:43.8,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I used to pick up lethally poisonous stinging jellyfish and sing to them.

13
0:00:49.8,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And so starting my career,

14
0:00:52.64,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I was deadly curious about fundamental mysteries

15
0:00:56.04,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of the most basic building blocks of life,

16
0:00:59.4,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and I was fortunate to live in a society where that curiosity was valued.

17
0:01:05.12,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now, for me, this little pond scum critter Tetrahymena

18
0:01:07.72,000 --> 0:01:09,000
was a great way to study the fundamental mystery

19
0:01:10.04,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I was most curious about:

20
0:01:12.12,000 --> 0:01:16,000
those bundles of DNA in our cells called chromosomes.

21
0:01:16.519,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And it was because I was curious about the very ends of chromosomes,

22
0:01:22.96,000 --> 0:01:24,000
known as telomeres.

23
0:01:25,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Now, when I started my quest,

24
0:01:27.72,000 --> 0:01:3,000
all we knew was that they helped protect the ends of chromosomes.

25
0:01:31.64,000 --> 0:01:32,000
It was important when cells divide.

26
0:01:33.36,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It was really important,

27
0:01:34.76,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but I wanted to find out what telomeres consisted of,

28
0:01:38.88,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and for that, I needed a lot of them.

29
0:01:41.68,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And it so happens that cute little Tetrahymena

30
0:01:44.28,000 --> 0:01:47,000
has a lot of short linear chromosomes,

31
0:01:47.32,000 --> 0:01:48,000
around 20,000,

32
0:01:48.96,000 --> 0:01:49,000
so lots of telomeres.

33
0:01:51.2,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And I discovered that telomeres consisted of special segments

34
0:01:55.92,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of noncoding DNA right at the very ends of chromosomes.

35
0:01:59.64,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But here's a problem.

36
0:02:01.84,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Now, we all start life as a single cell.

37
0:02:04.68,000 --> 0:02:06,000
It multiples to two. Two becomes four. Four becomes eight,

38
0:02:07.44,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and on and on to form the 200 million billion cells

39
0:02:10.68,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that make up our adult body.

40
0:02:12.96,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And some of those cells have to divide thousands of times.

41
0:02:17.64,000 --> 0:02:19,000
In fact, even as I stand here before you,

42
0:02:20.52,000 --> 0:02:23,000
all throughout my body, cells are furiously replenishing

43
0:02:23.64,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to, well, keep me standing here before you.

44
0:02:27.04,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So every time a cell divides, all of its DNA has to be copied,

45
0:02:31.52,000 --> 0:02:33,000
all of the coding DNA inside of those chromosomes,

46
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
because that carries the vital operating instructions

47
0:02:38.72,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that keep our cells in good working order,

48
0:02:41.76,000 --> 0:02:45,000
so my heart cells can keep a steady beat,

49
0:02:46.44,000 --> 0:02:48,000
which I assure you they're not doing right now,

50
0:02:48.68,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and my immune cells

51
0:02:51.6,000 --> 0:02:55,000
can fight off bacteria and viruses,

52
0:02:56.52,000 --> 0:03:,000
and our brain cells can save the memory of our first kiss

53
0:03:01.4,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and keep on learning throughout life.

54
0:03:04.52,000 --> 0:03:08,000
But there is a glitch in the way DNA is copied.

55
0:03:09.36,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It is just one of those facts of life.

56
0:03:12.24,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Every time the cell divides and the DNA is copied,

57
0:03:15.64,000 --> 0:03:19,000
some of that DNA from the ends gets worn down and shortened,

58
0:03:19.68,000 --> 0:03:21,000
some of that telomere DNA.

59
0:03:22,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And think about it

60
0:03:24.2,000 --> 0:03:27,000
like the protective caps at the ends of your shoelace.

61
0:03:27.68,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And those keep the shoelace, or the chromosome, from fraying,

62
0:03:33.24,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and when that tip gets too short, it falls off,

63
0:03:38.6,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and that worn down telomere sends a signal to the cells.

64
0:03:43.52,000 --> 0:03:45,000
"The DNA is no longer being protected."

65
0:03:45.56,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It sends a signal. Time to die.

66
0:03:47.6,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So, end of story.

67
0:03:49.08,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Well, sorry, not so fast.

68
0:03:53.12,000 --> 0:03:54,000
It can't be the end of the story,

69
0:03:54.76,000 --> 0:03:56,000
because life hasn't died off the face of the earth.

70
0:03:57.28,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So I was curious:

71
0:03:59.92,000 --> 0:04:01,000
if such wear and tear is inevitable,

72
0:04:02.04,000 --> 0:04:05,000
how on earth does Mother Nature make sure

73
0:04:05.28,000 --> 0:04:07,000
we can keep our chromosomes intact?

74
0:04:08.6,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Now, remember that little pond scum critter Tetrahymena?

75
0:04:13.08,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The craziest thing was, Tetrahymena cells never got old and died.

76
0:04:18.6,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Their telomeres weren't shortening as time marched on.

77
0:04:25.32,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Sometimes they even got longer.

78
0:04:27.12,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Something else was at work,

79
0:04:29.04,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and believe me, that something was not in any textbook.

80
0:04:32.68,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So working in my lab with my extraordinary student Carol Greider --

81
0:04:35.96,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and Carol and I shared the Nobel Prize for this work --

82
0:04:39.4,000 --> 0:04:4,000
we began running experiments

83
0:04:42.2,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and we discovered cells do have something else.

84
0:04:45.96,000 --> 0:04:47,000
It was a previously undreamed-of enzyme

85
0:04:48.96,000 --> 0:04:51,000
that could replenish, make longer, telomeres,

86
0:04:52.52,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and we named it telomerase.

87
0:04:55.84,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And when we removed our pond scum's telomerase,

88
0:04:59.48,000 --> 0:05:01,000
their telomeres ran down and they died.

89
0:05:02.6,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So it was thanks to their plentiful telomerase

90
0:05:05.32,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that our pond scum critters never got old.

91
0:05:10.04,000 --> 0:05:13,000
OK, now, that's an incredibly hopeful message

92
0:05:14.08,000 --> 0:05:17,000
for us humans to be receiving from pond scum,

93
0:05:18.4,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because it turns out

94
0:05:19.68,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that as we humans age, our telomeres do shorten,

95
0:05:23.52,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and remarkably, that shortening is aging us.

96
0:05:27.56,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Generally speaking, the longer your telomeres,

97
0:05:29.76,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the better off you are.

98
0:05:32.64,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It's the overshortening of telomeres

99
0:05:34.4,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that leads us to feel and see signs of aging.

100
0:05:38.48,000 --> 0:05:39,000
My skin cells start to die

101
0:05:40.32,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and I start to see fine lines, wrinkles.

102
0:05:43.2,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Hair pigment cells die.

103
0:05:45.48,000 --> 0:05:46,000
You start to see gray.

104
0:05:47.48,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Immune system cells die.

105
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:52,000
You increase your risks of getting sick.

106
0:05:52.88,000 --> 0:05:55,000
In fact, the cumulative research from the last 20 years

107
0:05:56.52,000 --> 0:05:59,000
has made clear that telomere attrition

108
0:05:59.72,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is contributing to our risks of getting cardiovascular diseases,

109
0:06:04.28,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Alzheimer's, some cancers and diabetes,

110
0:06:08.12,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the very conditions many of us die of.

111
0:06:12.6,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And so we have to think about this.

112
0:06:17.36,000 --> 0:06:18,000
What is going on?

113
0:06:19.32,000 --> 0:06:2,000
This attrition,

114
0:06:21.08,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we look and we feel older, yeah.

115
0:06:23.08,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Our telomeres are losing the war of attrition faster.

116
0:06:26.64,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And those of us who feel youthful longer,

117
0:06:30.12,000 --> 0:06:32,000
it turns out our telomeres are staying longer

118
0:06:32.8,000 --> 0:06:33,000
for longer periods of time,

119
0:06:34.12,000 --> 0:06:36,000
extending our feelings of youthfulness

120
0:06:36.92,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and reducing the risks of all we most dread

121
0:06:40.44,000 --> 0:06:42,000
as the birthdays go by.

122
0:06:44.48,000 --> 0:06:45,000
OK,

123
0:06:45.72,000 --> 0:06:47,000
seems like a no-brainer.

124
0:06:48.64,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Now, if my telomeres are connected

125
0:06:52.32,000 --> 0:06:55,000
to how quickly I'm going to feel and get old,

126
0:06:55.92,000 --> 0:06:59,000
if my telomeres can be renewed by my telomerase,

127
0:07:00.4,000 --> 0:07:04,000
then all I have to do to reverse the signs and symptoms of aging

128
0:07:04.92,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is figure out where to buy that Costco-sized bottle

129
0:07:08.48,000 --> 0:07:12,000
of grade A organic fair trade telomerase, right?

130
0:07:12.68,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Great! Problem solved.

131
0:07:14.36,000 --> 0:07:15,000
(Applause)

132
0:07:15.4,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Not so fast, I'm sorry.

133
0:07:18.32,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Alas, that's not the case.

134
0:07:21.8,000 --> 0:07:22,000
OK. And why?

135
0:07:23.08,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It's because human genetics has taught us

136
0:07:27.44,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that when it comes to our telomerase,

137
0:07:30.56,000 --> 0:07:33,000
we humans live on a knife edge.

138
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:35,000
OK, simply put,

139
0:07:36.28,000 --> 0:07:42,000
yes, nudging up telomerase does decrease the risks of some diseases,

140
0:07:42.56,000 --> 0:07:48,000
but it also increases the risks of certain and rather nasty cancers.

141
0:07:48.64,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So even if you could buy that Costco-sized bottle of telomerase,

142
0:07:54.44,000 --> 0:08:,000
and there are many websites marketing such dubious products,

143
0:08:01.2,000 --> 0:08:05,000
the problem is you could nudge up your risks of cancers.

144
0:08:06.6,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And we don't want that.

145
0:08:09.4,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Now, don't worry,

146
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and because, while I think it's kind of funny that right now,

147
0:08:17.08,000 --> 0:08:2,000
you know, many of us may be thinking, "Well, I'd rather be like pond scum," ...

148
0:08:22.72,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Laughter)

149
0:08:26.64,000 --> 0:08:27,000
there is something for us humans

150
0:08:28.24,000 --> 0:08:3,000
in the story of telomeres and their maintenance.

151
0:08:30.84,000 --> 0:08:31,000
But I want to get one thing clear.

152
0:08:32.52,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It isn't about enormously extending human lifespan

153
0:08:35.72,000 --> 0:08:37,000
or immortality.

154
0:08:37.76,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It's about health span.

155
0:08:40.68,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Now, health span is the number of years of your life

156
0:08:43.4,000 --> 0:08:46,000
when you're free of disease, you're healthy, you're productive,

157
0:08:47.2,000 --> 0:08:49,000
you're zestfully enjoying life.

158
0:08:49.36,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Disease span, the opposite of health span,

159
0:08:52.08,000 --> 0:08:55,000
is the time of your life spent feeling old and sick and dying.

160
0:08:55.84,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So the real question becomes,

161
0:08:59.44,000 --> 0:09:,000
OK, if I can't guzzle telomerase,

162
0:09:02.92,000 --> 0:09:05,000
do I have control over my telomeres' length

163
0:09:06.12,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and hence my well-being, my health,

164
0:09:09.88,000 --> 0:09:11,000
without those downsides of cancer risks?

165
0:09:13.48,000 --> 0:09:14,000
OK?

166
0:09:14.84,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So, it's the year 2000.

167
0:09:17.6,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Now, I've been minutely scrutinizing little teeny tiny telomeres

168
0:09:22.84,000 --> 0:09:24,000
very happily for many years,

169
0:09:25.28,000 --> 0:09:28,000
when into my lab walks a psychologist named Elissa Epel.

170
0:09:29.12,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Now, Elissa's expertise is in the effects of severe, chronic psychological stress

171
0:09:35.84,000 --> 0:09:36,000
on our mind's and our body's health.

172
0:09:39.28,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And there she was standing in my lab,

173
0:09:41.24,000 --> 0:09:46,000
which ironically overlooked the entrance to a mortuary, and --

174
0:09:46.32,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

175
0:09:48.68,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And she had a life-and-death question for me.

176
0:09:51.36,000 --> 0:09:54,000
"What happens to telomeres in people who are chronically stressed?"

177
0:09:55.04,000 --> 0:09:56,000
she asked me.

178
0:09:56.28,000 --> 0:09:58,000
You see, she'd been studying caregivers,

179
0:09:58.44,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and specifically mothers of children with a chronic condition,

180
0:10:04,000 --> 0:10:08,000
be it gut disorder, be it autism, you name it --

181
0:10:08.56,000 --> 0:10:13,000
a group obviously under enormous and prolonged psychological stress.

182
0:10:16.6,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I have to say, her question

183
0:10:19.08,000 --> 0:10:21,000
changed me profoundly.

184
0:10:21.12,000 --> 0:10:23,000
See, all this time I had been thinking of telomeres

185
0:10:23.88,000 --> 0:10:26,000
as those miniscule molecular structures that they are,

186
0:10:27.2,000 --> 0:10:29,000
and the genes that control telomeres.

187
0:10:30.76,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And when Elissa asked me about studying caregivers,

188
0:10:33.96,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I suddenly saw telomeres in a whole new light.

189
0:10:39.56,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I saw beyond the genes and the chromosomes

190
0:10:42.32,000 --> 0:10:45,000
into the lives of the real people we were studying.

191
0:10:46.28,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And I'm a mom myself,

192
0:10:48.52,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and at that moment,

193
0:10:50.48,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I was struck by the image of these women

194
0:10:54.32,000 --> 0:10:57,000
dealing with a child with a condition

195
0:10:58.32,000 --> 0:11:,000
very difficult to deal with, often without help.

196
0:11:02.08,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And such women, simply,

197
0:11:05.12,000 --> 0:11:08,000
often look worn down.

198
0:11:09.68,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So was it possible their telomeres were worn down as well?

199
0:11:13.72,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So our collective curiosity went into overdrive.

200
0:11:17.4,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Elissa selected for our first study a group of such caregiving mothers,

201
0:11:21.32,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and we wanted to ask: What's the length of their telomeres

202
0:11:25.52,000 --> 0:11:29,000
compared with the number of years that they have been caregiving

203
0:11:30.12,000 --> 0:11:32,000
for their child with a chronic condition?

204
0:11:32.92,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So four years go by

205
0:11:35.72,000 --> 0:11:38,000
and the day comes when all the results are in,

206
0:11:38.88,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and Elissa looked down at our first scatterplot

207
0:11:41.6,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and literally gasped,

208
0:11:44.96,000 --> 0:11:46,000
because there was a pattern to the data,

209
0:11:47.6,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and it was the exact gradient that we most feared might exist.

210
0:11:53.04,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It was right there on the page.

211
0:11:55,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The longer, the more years that is,

212
0:11:57.44,000 --> 0:11:59,000
the mother had been in this caregiving situation,

213
0:12:00.36,000 --> 0:12:01,000
no matter her age,

214
0:12:02.08,000 --> 0:12:03,000
the shorter were her telomeres.

215
0:12:04.08,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And the more she perceived

216
0:12:07.2,000 --> 0:12:11,000
her situation as being more stressful,

217
0:12:11.88,000 --> 0:12:16,000
the lower was her telomerase and the shorter were her telomeres.

218
0:12:19.36,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So we had discovered something unheard of:

219
0:12:22.88,000 --> 0:12:25,000
the more chronic stress you are under, the shorter your telomeres,

220
0:12:26.76,000 --> 0:12:31,000
meaning the more likely you were to fall victim to an early disease span

221
0:12:32.44,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and perhaps untimely death.

222
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Our findings meant that people's life events

223
0:12:39.36,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and the way we respond to these events

224
0:12:42.32,000 --> 0:12:46,000
can change how you maintain your telomeres.

225
0:12:48.08,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So telomere length wasn't just a matter of age counted in years.

226
0:12:54.52,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Elissa's question to me,

227
0:12:55.96,000 --> 0:12:58,000
back when she first came to my lab, indeed had been a life-and-death question.

228
0:13:01.92,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Now, luckily, hidden in that data there was hope.

229
0:13:06.08,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We noticed that some mothers,

230
0:13:07.72,000 --> 0:13:11,000
despite having been carefully caring for their children for many years,

231
0:13:11.88,000 --> 0:13:13,000
had been able to maintain their telomeres.

232
0:13:15.52,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So studying these women closely revealed that they were resilient to stress.

233
0:13:20.96,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Somehow they were able to experience their circumstances

234
0:13:23.64,000 --> 0:13:25,000
not as a threat day in and day out

235
0:13:26.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
but as a challenge,

236
0:13:27.84,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and this has led to a very important insight for all of us:

237
0:13:31.92,000 --> 0:13:34,000
we have control over the way we age

238
0:13:35.72,000 --> 0:13:37,000
all the way down into our cells.

239
0:13:39.68,000 --> 0:13:42,000
OK, now our initial curiosity became infectious.

240
0:13:43.12,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Thousands of scientists from different fields

241
0:13:45.72,000 --> 0:13:48,000
added their expertise to telomere research,

242
0:13:49.24,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and the findings have poured in.

243
0:13:51.84,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It's up to over 10,000 scientific papers and counting.

244
0:13:58.84,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So several studies rapidly confirmed our initial finding

245
0:14:02.36,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that yes, chronic stress is bad for telomeres.

246
0:14:06.72,000 --> 0:14:07,000
And now many are revealing

247
0:14:08.12,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that we have more control over this particular aging process

248
0:14:12.04,000 --> 0:14:14,000
than any of us could ever have imagined.

249
0:14:14.88,000 --> 0:14:15,000
A few examples:

250
0:14:16.12,000 --> 0:14:2,000
a study from the University of California, Los Angeles

251
0:14:20.28,000 --> 0:14:25,000
of people who are caring for a relative with dementia, long-term,

252
0:14:25.72,000 --> 0:14:3,000
and looked at their caregiver's telomere maintenance capacity

253
0:14:31.2,000 --> 0:14:33,000
and found that it was improved

254
0:14:33.44,000 --> 0:14:36,000
by them practicing a form of meditation

255
0:14:37.28,000 --> 0:14:39,000
for as little as 12 minutes a day for two months.

256
0:14:41.72,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Attitude matters.

257
0:14:43.4,000 --> 0:14:45,000
If you're habitually a negative thinker,

258
0:14:45.8,000 --> 0:14:5,000
you typically see a stressful situation with a threat stress response,

259
0:14:51.56,000 --> 0:14:53,000
meaning if your boss wants to see you,

260
0:14:54.04,000 --> 0:14:56,000
you automatically think, "I'm about to be fired,"

261
0:14:56.4,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and your blood vessels constrict,

262
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and your level of the stress hormone cortisol creeps up,

263
0:15:02.36,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and then it stays up,

264
0:15:03.92,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and over time, that persistently high level of the cortisol

265
0:15:08.88,000 --> 0:15:09,000
actually damps down your telomerase.

266
0:15:10.8,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Not good for your telomeres.

267
0:15:14.2,000 --> 0:15:15,000
On the other hand,

268
0:15:15.48,000 --> 0:15:2,000
if you typically see something stressful as a challenge to be tackled,

269
0:15:21.48,000 --> 0:15:24,000
then blood flows to your heart and to your brain,

270
0:15:24.96,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and you experience a brief but energizing spike of cortisol.

271
0:15:29.68,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And thanks to that habitual "bring it on" attitude,

272
0:15:32.24,000 --> 0:15:35,000
your telomeres do just fine.

273
0:15:37.6,000 --> 0:15:38,000
So ...

274
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:42,000
What is all of this telling us?

275
0:15:45.48,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Your telomeres do just fine.

276
0:15:47.44,000 --> 0:15:52,000
You really do have power to change what is happening

277
0:15:53.44,000 --> 0:15:55,000
to your own telomeres.

278
0:15:56.48,000 --> 0:16:01,000
But our curiosity just got more and more intense,

279
0:16:02.52,000 --> 0:16:04,000
because we started to wonder,

280
0:16:04.96,000 --> 0:16:07,000
what about factors outside our own skin?

281
0:16:08.2,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Could they impact our telomere maintenance as well?

282
0:16:12.8,000 --> 0:16:15,000
You know, we humans are intensely social beings.

283
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Was it even possible that our telomeres were social as well?

284
0:16:21.44,000 --> 0:16:22,000
And the results have been startling.

285
0:16:24.4,000 --> 0:16:25,000
As early as childhood,

286
0:16:28.36,000 --> 0:16:31,000
emotional neglect, exposure to violence,

287
0:16:31.56,000 --> 0:16:33,000
bullying and racism

288
0:16:33.6,000 --> 0:16:37,000
all impact your telomeres, and the effects are long-term.

289
0:16:39.8,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Can you imagine the impact on children

290
0:16:42.12,000 --> 0:16:43,000
of living years in a war zone?

291
0:16:46.24,000 --> 0:16:47,000
People who can't trust their neighbors

292
0:16:48.12,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and who don't feel safe in their neighborhoods

293
0:16:51.28,000 --> 0:16:53,000
consistently have shorter telomeres.

294
0:16:54.6,000 --> 0:16:56,000
So your home address matters for telomeres as well.

295
0:16:57.6,000 --> 0:16:58,000
On the flip side,

296
0:17:00.2,000 --> 0:17:03,000
tight-knit communities, being in a marriage long-term,

297
0:17:03.52,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and lifelong friendships, even,

298
0:17:06.48,000 --> 0:17:08,000
all improve telomere maintenance.

299
0:17:10.36,000 --> 0:17:13,000
So what is all this telling us?

300
0:17:13.84,000 --> 0:17:17,000
It's telling us that I have the power to impact my own telomeres,

301
0:17:18.359,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and I also have the power to impact yours.

302
0:17:21.68,000 --> 0:17:26,000
Telomere science has told us just how interconnected we all are.

303
0:17:29.52,000 --> 0:17:3,000
But I'm still curious.

304
0:17:31.92,000 --> 0:17:33,000
I do wonder

305
0:17:35.2,000 --> 0:17:37,000
what legacy all of us

306
0:17:38.56,000 --> 0:17:39,000
will leave for the next generation?

307
0:17:40.96,000 --> 0:17:41,000
Will we invest

308
0:17:42.56,000 --> 0:17:45,000
in the next young woman or man

309
0:17:45.6,000 --> 0:17:49,000
peering through a microscope at the next little critter,

310
0:17:49.84,000 --> 0:17:51,000
the next bit of pond scum,

311
0:17:52.52,000 --> 0:17:55,000
curious about a question we don't even know today is a question?

312
0:17:56.32,000 --> 0:17:58,000
It could be a great question that could impact all the world.

313
0:17:59.24,000 --> 0:18:02,000
And maybe, maybe you're curious about you.

314
0:18:04.08,000 --> 0:18:06,000
Now that you know how to protect your telomeres,

315
0:18:06.36,000 --> 0:18:07,000
are you curious what are you going to do

316
0:18:08.289,000 --> 0:18:1,000
with all those decades of brimming good health?

317
0:18:11.2,000 --> 0:18:14,000
And now that you know you could impact the telomeres of others,

318
0:18:16.04,000 --> 0:18:17,000
are you curious

319
0:18:18.04,000 --> 0:18:19,000
how will you make a difference?

320
0:18:21.88,000 --> 0:18:25,000
And now that you know the power of curiosity to change the world,

321

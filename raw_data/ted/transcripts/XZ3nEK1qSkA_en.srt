1
0:00:15.474,000 --> 0:00:19,000
There's currently over a thousand TED Talks on the TED website.

2
0:00:19.654,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And I guess many of you here think that this is quite fantastic,

3
0:00:24.674,000 --> 0:00:25,000
except for me, I don't agree with this.

4
0:00:26.572,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I think we have a situation here.

5
0:00:28.181,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Because if you think about it, 1,000 TED Talks,

6
0:00:31.656,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that's over 1,000 ideas worth spreading.

7
0:00:35.113,000 --> 0:00:38,000
How on earth are you going to spread a thousand ideas?

8
0:00:38.726,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head

9
0:00:41.618,000 --> 0:00:43,000
by watching all those thousand TED videos,

10
0:00:43.663,000 --> 0:00:46,000
it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so.

11
0:00:47.823,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And I did a little calculation of this.

12
0:00:50.411,000 --> 0:00:54,000
The damage to the economy for each one who does this is around $15,000.

13
0:00:54.94,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So having seen this danger to the economy,

14
0:00:58.497,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I thought, we need to find a solution to this problem.

15
0:01:01.624,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Here's my approach to it all.

16
0:01:03.406,000 --> 0:01:06,000
If you look at the current situation, you have a thousand TED Talks.

17
0:01:06.636,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Each of those TED Talks has an average length of about 2,300 words.

18
0:01:11.535,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Now take this together, and you end up with 2.3 million words of TED Talks,

19
0:01:16.259,000 --> 0:01:18,000
which is about three Bibles-worth of content.

20
0:01:18.969,000 --> 0:01:19,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:19.994,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The obvious question here is, does a TED Talk really need 2,300 words?

22
0:01:24.474,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Isn't there something shorter?

23
0:01:25.963,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I mean, if you have an idea worth spreading,

24
0:01:28.067,000 --> 0:01:31,000
surely you can put it into something shorter than 2,300 words.

25
0:01:31.549,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The only question is, how short can you get?

26
0:01:34.267,000 --> 0:01:37,000
What's the minimum amount of words you would need to do a TED Talk?

27
0:01:38.205,000 --> 0:01:39,000
While I was pondering this question,

28
0:01:39.951,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I came across this urban legend about Ernest Hemingway,

29
0:01:43.172,000 --> 0:01:46,000
who allegedly said that these six words here:

30
0:01:46.268,000 --> 0:01:48,000
"For sale: baby shoes, never worn,"

31
0:01:49.144,000 --> 0:01:51,000
were the best novel he had ever written.

32
0:01:51.882,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And I also encountered a project called Six-Word Memoirs

33
0:01:54.532,000 --> 0:01:56,000
where people were asked, take your whole life

34
0:01:56.676,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and please sum this up into six words, such as these here:

35
0:01:59.436,000 --> 0:02:01,000
"Found true love, married someone else."

36
0:02:01.471,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Or "Living in existential vacuum; it sucks."

37
0:02:03.87,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I actually like that one.

38
0:02:05.952,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So if a novel can be put into six words

39
0:02:08.372,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and a whole memoir can be put into six words,

40
0:02:11.978,000 --> 0:02:13,000
you don't need more than six words for a TED Talk.

41
0:02:14.923,000 --> 0:02:17,000
We could have been done by lunch here.

42
0:02:18.165,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:19.672,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And if you did this for all thousand TED Talks,

44
0:02:21.906,000 --> 0:02:24,000
you would get from 2.3 million words down to 6,000.

45
0:02:25.258,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So I thought this was quite worthwhile.

46
0:02:27.155,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So I started asking all my friends,

47
0:02:28.937,000 --> 0:02:3,000
please take your favorite TED Talk and put that into six words.

48
0:02:31.959,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So here are some of the results that I received.

49
0:02:34.227,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I think they're quite nice.

50
0:02:35.599,000 --> 0:02:38,000
For example, Dan Pink's talk on motivation, which was pretty good,

51
0:02:38.723,000 --> 0:02:41,000
if you haven't seen it: "Drop carrot. Drop stick. Bring meaning."

52
0:02:41.853,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It's what he's basically talking about in those 18,5 minutes.

53
0:02:44.749,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Or some even included references to the speakers,

54
0:02:47.067,000 --> 0:02:5,000
such as Nathan Myhrvold's speaking style, or the one of Tim Ferriss,

55
0:02:50.295,000 --> 0:02:52,000
which might be considered a bit strenuous at times.

56
0:02:52.728,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The challenge here is, if I try to systematically do this,

57
0:02:55.473,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I would probably end up with a lot of summaries,

58
0:02:57.822,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but not with many friends in the end.

59
0:02:59.618,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So I had to find a different method, preferably involving total strangers.

60
0:03:03.137,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And luckily, there's a website for that, called Mechanical Turk,

61
0:03:06.497,000 --> 0:03:08,000
which is a website where you can post tasks

62
0:03:08.689,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that you don't want to do yourself,

63
0:03:10.403,000 --> 0:03:13,000
such as "Please summarize this text for me in six words."

64
0:03:13.432,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And I didn't allow any low-cost countries to work on this,

65
0:03:16.291,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but I found out I could get a six-word summary for just 10 cents,

66
0:03:20.015,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which I think is a pretty good price.

67
0:03:22.285,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Even then, unfortunately,

68
0:03:24.009,000 --> 0:03:26,000
it's not possible to summarize each TED Talk individually.

69
0:03:26.878,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Because if you do the math, you have a thousand TED Talks,

70
0:03:29.656,000 --> 0:03:3,000
you pay 10 cents each;

71
0:03:30.846,000 --> 0:03:32,000
you have to do more than one summary for each of those talks,

72
0:03:33.815,000 --> 0:03:35,000
because some of them will probably be, or are, really bad.

73
0:03:36.626,000 --> 0:03:38,000
So I would end up paying hundreds of dollars.

74
0:03:39.46,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So I thought of a different way,

75
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
by thinking, well, the talks revolve around certain themes.

76
0:03:44.658,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So what if I don't let people summarize individual TED Talks to six words,

77
0:03:49.343,000 --> 0:03:51,000
but give them 10 TED Talks at the same time

78
0:03:51.383,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and say, "Please do a six-word summary for that one."

79
0:03:54.028,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I would cut my costs by 90 percent.

80
0:03:56.215,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So for $60,

81
0:03:58.769,000 --> 0:04:01,000
I could summarize a thousand TED Talks into just 600 summaries,

82
0:04:02.784,000 --> 0:04:03,000
which would actually be quite nice.

83
0:04:04.806,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Some of you might actually right now be thinking,

84
0:04:07.123,000 --> 0:04:1,000
it's downright crazy to have 10 TED Talks summarized into just six words.

85
0:04:10.645,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But it's actually not,

86
0:04:11.949,000 --> 0:04:14,000
because there's an example by statistics professor Hans Rosling.

87
0:04:15.102,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I guess many of you have seen one or more of his talks.

88
0:04:17.712,000 --> 0:04:18,000
He's got eight talks online,

89
0:04:19.072,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and those can basically be summed up into just four words,

90
0:04:21.812,000 --> 0:04:25,000
because that's all he's basically showing us, our intuition is really bad.

91
0:04:26.44,000 --> 0:04:27,000
He always proves us wrong.

92
0:04:27.83,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So people on the Internet, some didn't do so well.

93
0:04:30.417,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And when I asked them to summarize the 10 TED Talks at the same time,

94
0:04:33.834,000 --> 0:04:34,000
some took the easy route out.

95
0:04:35.338,000 --> 0:04:37,000
They just had some general comment.

96
0:04:37.773,000 --> 0:04:4,000
There were others -- and I found this quite cheeky --

97
0:04:40.833,000 --> 0:04:42,000
They used their six words to talk back to me

98
0:04:43.267,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and ask me if I'd been too much on Google lately.

99
0:04:45.6,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:46.783,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And finally also, I never understood this,

101
0:04:49.9,000 --> 0:04:52,000
some people really came up with their own version of the truth.

102
0:04:53.058,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I don't know any TED Talk that contains this.

103
0:04:55.891,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But, oh well.

104
0:04:57.465,000 --> 0:04:59,000
In the end, however, and this is really amazing,

105
0:04:59.825,000 --> 0:05:01,000
for each of those 10 TED Talk clusters that I submitted,

106
0:05:02.689,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I actually received meaningful summaries.

107
0:05:04.675,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Here are some of my favorites.

108
0:05:06.142,000 --> 0:05:08,000
For example, for the TED Talks about food,

109
0:05:08.446,000 --> 0:05:11,000
someone summed this up into: "Food shaping body, brains and environment,"

110
0:05:11.929,000 --> 0:05:12,000
which I think is pretty good.

111
0:05:13.341,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Or happiness: "Striving toward happiness = moving toward unhappiness."

112
0:05:16.655,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So here I was.

113
0:05:17.832,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I had started out with a thousand TED Talks

114
0:05:19.866,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and I had 600 six-word summaries for those.

115
0:05:23.29,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Actually, it sounded nice in the beginning,

116
0:05:25.317,000 --> 0:05:28,000
but when you look at 600 summaries, it's quite a lot, it's a huge list.

117
0:05:28.739,000 --> 0:05:29,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:29.778,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So I thought, I probably have to take this one step further here

119
0:05:32.86,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and create summaries of the summaries, and this is exactly what I did.

120
0:05:36.512,000 --> 0:05:39,000
So I took the 600 summaries that I had, put them into nine groups

121
0:05:39.806,000 --> 0:05:42,000
according to the ratings that the talks had originally received on TED.com

122
0:05:43.718,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and asked people to do summaries of those.

123
0:05:47.039,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Again, there were some misunderstandings.

124
0:05:49.035,000 --> 0:05:51,000
For example, when I had a cluster of all the "Beautiful" talks,

125
0:05:52.024,000 --> 0:05:55,000
someone thought I was just trying to find the ultimate pick-up line.

126
0:05:55.267,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But in the end, amazingly,

127
0:05:57.468,000 --> 0:05:58,000
again, people were able to do it.

128
0:05:59.073,000 --> 0:06:01,000
For example, all the courageous TED Talks:

129
0:06:01.151,000 --> 0:06:03,000
"People dying" or "People suffering" was also one,

130
0:06:03.614,000 --> 0:06:04,000
"with easy solutions around."

131
0:06:05.035,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Or the recipe for the ultimate jaw-dropping TED Talk:

132
0:06:07.544,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"Flickr photos of intergalactic classical composer."

133
0:06:10.099,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I mean that's the essence of it all.

134
0:06:12.972,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Now I had my nine groups, but, I mean, it's already quite a reduction.

135
0:06:17.968,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But of course, once you are that far, you're not really satisfied.

136
0:06:21.427,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I wanted to go all the way, all the way down the distillery,

137
0:06:24.276,000 --> 0:06:25,000
starting out with a thousand TED Talks.

138
0:06:26.19,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I wanted to have a thousand TED Talks summarized into just six words --

139
0:06:29.578,000 --> 0:06:32,000
which would be a 99.9997 percent reduction in content.

140
0:06:33.08,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And I would only pay $99.50 --

141
0:06:36.741,000 --> 0:06:38,000
so stay even below $100 for it.

142
0:06:39.87,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So I had 50 overall summaries done.

143
0:06:41.587,000 --> 0:06:42,000
This time I paid 25 cents

144
0:06:43.019,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because I thought the task was a bit harder.

145
0:06:45.147,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And unfortunately, when I first received the answers --

146
0:06:48.599,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and here, you'll see six of the answers -- I was a bit disappointed.

147
0:06:51.841,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Because I think you'll agree, they all summarize some aspect of TED,

148
0:06:55.089,000 --> 0:06:56,000
but to me, they felt a bit bland,

149
0:06:57.037,000 --> 0:07:,000
or they just had a certain aspect of TED in them.

150
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So I was almost ready to give up

151
0:07:02.118,000 --> 0:07:05,000
when one night, I played around with these sentences

152
0:07:05.241,000 --> 0:07:08,000

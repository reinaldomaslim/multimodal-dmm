2
0:00:12.567,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Well, now we're going to the Bahamas to meet

3
0:00:14.844,000 --> 0:00:16,000
a remarkable group of dolphins that I've been working with

4
0:00:17.087,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in the wild for the last 28 years.

5
0:00:20.554,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now I'm interested in dolphins because of their large brains

6
0:00:23.749,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and what they might be doing with all that brainpower

7
0:00:25.863,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in the wild.

8
0:00:27.338,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And we know they use some of that brainpower

9
0:00:29.61,000 --> 0:00:31,000
for just living complicated lives,

10
0:00:31.774,000 --> 0:00:33,000
but what do we really know about dolphin intelligence?

11
0:00:34.634,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Well, we know a few things.

12
0:00:36.338,000 --> 0:00:38,000
We know that their brain-to-body ratio,

13
0:00:38.527,000 --> 0:00:39,000
which is a physical measure of intelligence,

14
0:00:40.497,000 --> 0:00:42,000
is second only to humans.

15
0:00:42.993,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Cognitively, they can understand

16
0:00:44.551,000 --> 0:00:46,000
artificially-created languages.

17
0:00:46.98,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And they pass self-awareness tests in mirrors.

18
0:00:50.121,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And in some parts of the world, they use tools,

19
0:00:52.225,000 --> 0:00:54,000
like sponges to hunt fish.

20
0:00:54.54,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But there's one big question left:

21
0:00:57.191,000 --> 0:00:58,000
do they have a language, and if so,

22
0:00:59.058,000 --> 0:01:01,000
what are they talking about?

23
0:01:01.462,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So decades ago, not years ago,

24
0:01:04.905,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I set out to find a place in the world

25
0:01:07.068,000 --> 0:01:08,000
where I could observe dolphins underwater

26
0:01:08.866,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to try to crack the code of their communication system.

27
0:01:12.109,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now in most parts of the world, the water's pretty murky,

28
0:01:14.723,000 --> 0:01:17,000
so it's very hard to observe animals underwater,

29
0:01:17.962,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but I found a community of dolphins that live

30
0:01:19.721,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in these beautiful, clear, shallow sandbanks of the Bahamas

31
0:01:22.747,000 --> 0:01:24,000
which are just east of Florida.

32
0:01:24.989,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And they spend their daytime resting and socializing

33
0:01:27.4,000 --> 0:01:28,000
in the safety of the shallows, but at night,

34
0:01:29.27,000 --> 0:01:32,000
they go off the edge and hunt in deep water.

35
0:01:33.069,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Now, it's not a bad place to be a researcher, either.

36
0:01:36.893,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So we go out for about five months every summer

37
0:01:39.069,000 --> 0:01:43,000
in a 20-meter catamaran, and we live, sleep and work

38
0:01:43.271,000 --> 0:01:45,000
at sea for weeks at a time.

39
0:01:45.349,000 --> 0:01:47,000
My main tool is an underwater video with a hydrophone,

40
0:01:47.989,000 --> 0:01:48,000
which is an underwater microphone, and this is so

41
0:01:49.939,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I can correlate sound and behavior.

42
0:01:52.033,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And most of our work's pretty non-invasive.

43
0:01:53.679,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We try to follow dolphin etiquette while we're in the water,

44
0:01:56.501,000 --> 0:01:59,000
since we're actually observing them physically in the water.

45
0:01:59.629,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now, Atlantic spotted dolphins are a really nice species

46
0:02:02.769,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to work with for a couple of reasons.

47
0:02:04.733,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They're born without spots, and they get spots with age,

48
0:02:07.664,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and they go through pretty distinct developmental phases,

49
0:02:10.698,000 --> 0:02:11,000
so that's fun to track their behavior.

50
0:02:12.64,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And by about the age of 15, they're fully spotted black and white.

51
0:02:16.093,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now the mother you see here is Mugsy.

52
0:02:18.516,000 --> 0:02:19,000
She's 35 years old in this shot,

53
0:02:20.501,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but dolphins can actually live into their early 50s.

54
0:02:23.691,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And like all the dolphins in our community,

55
0:02:26.994,000 --> 0:02:28,000
we photographed Mugsy and tracked her little spots

56
0:02:29.765,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and nicks in her dorsal fin,

57
0:02:31.507,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and also the unique spot patterns

58
0:02:33.71,000 --> 0:02:35,000
as she matured over time.

59
0:02:36.053,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Now, young dolphins learn a lot as they're growing up,

60
0:02:38.712,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and they use their teenage years to practice social skills,

61
0:02:41.787,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and at about the age of nine, the females

62
0:02:44.14,000 --> 0:02:46,000
become sexually mature, so they can get pregnant,

63
0:02:46.81,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and the males mature quite a bit later,

64
0:02:48.781,000 --> 0:02:5,000
at around 15 years of age.

65
0:02:50.896,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And dolphins are very promiscuous,

66
0:02:52.636,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and so we have to determine who the fathers are,

67
0:02:55.498,000 --> 0:02:57,000
so we do paternity tests by collecting fecal material

68
0:02:57.952,000 --> 0:02:59,000
out of the water and extracting DNA.

69
0:03:00.816,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So what that means is, after 28 years,

70
0:03:03.28,000 --> 0:03:05,000
we are tracking three generations,

71
0:03:05.688,000 --> 0:03:07,000
including grandmothers and grandfathers.

72
0:03:08.032,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now, dolphins are natural acousticians.

73
0:03:10.648,000 --> 0:03:12,000
They make sounds 10 times as high

74
0:03:12.932,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and hear sounds 10 times as high as we do.

75
0:03:15.12,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But they have other communication signals they use.

76
0:03:17.715,000 --> 0:03:2,000
They have good vision, so they use body postures to communicate.

77
0:03:21.056,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They have taste, not smell.

78
0:03:23.256,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And they have touch.

79
0:03:25.296,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And sound can actually be felt in the water,

80
0:03:27.492,000 --> 0:03:3,000
because the acoustic impedance of tissue and water's about the same.

81
0:03:30.523,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So dolphins can buzz and tickle each other at a distance.

82
0:03:34.153,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, we do know some things about how sounds are used

83
0:03:36.693,000 --> 0:03:37,000
with certain behaviors.

84
0:03:38.102,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Now, the signature whistle is a whistle

85
0:03:40.201,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that's specific to an individual dolphin, and it's like a name. (Dolphin whistling noises)

86
0:03:44.9,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And this is the best-studied sound,

87
0:03:47.076,000 --> 0:03:48,000
because it's easy to measure, really,

88
0:03:48.705,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and you'd find this whistle when mothers and calves

89
0:03:50.662,000 --> 0:03:52,000
are reuniting, for example.

90
0:03:52.799,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Another well studied sound are echolocation clicks.

91
0:03:55.857,000 --> 0:03:58,000
This is the dolphin's sonar. (Dolphin echolocation noises)

92
0:03:59.103,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And they use these clicks to hunt and feed.

93
0:04:02.42,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But they can also tightly pack these clicks together

94
0:04:04.808,000 --> 0:04:06,000
into buzzes and use them socially.

95
0:04:06.943,000 --> 0:04:07,000
For example, males will stimulate a female

96
0:04:08.921,000 --> 0:04:1,000
during a courtship chase.

97
0:04:11.425,000 --> 0:04:13,000
You know, I've been buzzed in the water.

98
0:04:13.752,000 --> 0:04:14,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:15.684,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Don't tell anyone. It's a secret.

100
0:04:18.065,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And you can really feel the sound. That was my point with that.

101
0:04:20.361,000 --> 0:04:23,000
(Laughter)

102
0:04:24.093,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So dolphins are also political animals,

103
0:04:26.618,000 --> 0:04:28,000
so they have to resolve conflicts.

104
0:04:28.929,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Dolphin noises)

105
0:04:30.572,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And they use these burst-pulsed sounds as well as

106
0:04:32.945,000 --> 0:04:34,000
their head-to-head behaviors when they're fighting.

107
0:04:35.353,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And these are very unstudied sounds

108
0:04:37.425,000 --> 0:04:39,000
because they're hard to measure.

109
0:04:39.563,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now this is some video of a typical dolphin fight.

110
0:04:42.282,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Dolphin noises)

111
0:04:44.303,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So you're going to see two groups,

112
0:04:46.393,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and you're going to see the head-to-head posturing,

113
0:04:48.601,000 --> 0:04:51,000
some open mouths,

114
0:04:51.945,000 --> 0:04:53,000
lots of squawking.

115
0:04:54.101,000 --> 0:04:57,000
There's a bubble.

116
0:04:57.686,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And basically, one of these groups will kind of back off

117
0:05:00.269,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and everything will resolve fine,

118
0:05:01.923,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and it doesn't really escalate into violence too much.

119
0:05:05.583,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Now, in the Bahamas, we also have resident bottlenose

120
0:05:07.887,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that interact socially with the spotted dolphins.

121
0:05:10.831,000 --> 0:05:12,000
For example, they babysit each other's calves.

122
0:05:13.542,000 --> 0:05:15,000
The males have dominance displays that they use

123
0:05:15.719,000 --> 0:05:17,000
when they're chasing each other's females.

124
0:05:18.119,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And the two species actually form temporary alliances

125
0:05:20.541,000 --> 0:05:22,000
when they're chasing sharks away.

126
0:05:22.919,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And one of the mechanisms they use to communicate

127
0:05:25.83,000 --> 0:05:27,000
their coordination is synchrony.

128
0:05:27.83,000 --> 0:05:3,000
They synchronize their sounds and their body postures

129
0:05:30.941,000 --> 0:05:32,000
to look bigger and sound stronger.

130
0:05:33.075,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Dolphins noises)

131
0:05:34.551,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Now, these are bottlenose dolphins,

132
0:05:37.143,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and you'll see them starting to synchronize

133
0:05:38.914,000 --> 0:05:39,000
their behavior and their sounds.

134
0:05:40.815,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Dolphin noises)

135
0:05:45.183,000 --> 0:05:47,000
You see, they're synchronizing with their partner

136
0:05:47.429,000 --> 0:05:5,000
as well as the other dyad.

137
0:05:51.401,000 --> 0:05:53,000
I wish I was that coordinated.

138
0:05:56.731,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Now, it's important to remember that you're only hearing

139
0:05:59.805,000 --> 0:06:,000
the human-audible parts of dolphin sounds,

140
0:06:01.7,000 --> 0:06:03,000
and dolphins make ultrasonic sounds,

141
0:06:03.863,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and we use special equipment in the water

142
0:06:05.421,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to collect these sounds.

143
0:06:07.158,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Now, researchers have actually measured whistle complexity

144
0:06:09.723,000 --> 0:06:11,000
using information theory,

145
0:06:11.786,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and whistles rate very high relative to even human languages.

146
0:06:15.677,000 --> 0:06:18,000
But burst-pulsed sounds is a bit of a mystery.

147
0:06:19.529,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Now, these are three spectragrams.

148
0:06:22.616,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Two are human words, and one is a dolphin vocalizing.

149
0:06:25.291,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So just take a guess in your mind which one is the dolphin.

150
0:06:31.15,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now, it turns out burst-pulsed sounds actually look

151
0:06:33.743,000 --> 0:06:35,000
a bit like human phonemes.

152
0:06:36.247,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now, one way to crack the code

153
0:06:37.513,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is to interpret these signals and figure out what they mean,

154
0:06:40.058,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but it's a difficult job, and we actually don't have a Rosetta Stone yet.

155
0:06:44.056,000 --> 0:06:46,000
But a second way to crack the code

156
0:06:46.178,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is to develop some technology,

157
0:06:48.143,000 --> 0:06:5,000
an interface to do two-way communication,

158
0:06:50.323,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and that's what we've been trying to do in the Bahamas

159
0:06:52.687,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and in real time.

160
0:06:55.127,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Now, scientists have used keyboard interfaces

161
0:06:57.783,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to try to bridge the gap with species

162
0:06:59.847,000 --> 0:07:01,000
including chimpanzees and dolphins.

163
0:07:01.935,000 --> 0:07:04,000
This underwater keyboard in Orlando, Florida,

164
0:07:04.96,000 --> 0:07:05,000
at the Epcot Center, was actually

165
0:07:06.702,000 --> 0:07:08,000
the most sophisticated ever two-way interface designed

166
0:07:09.519,000 --> 0:07:11,000
for humans and dolphins to work together under the water

167
0:07:12.383,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and exchange information.

168
0:07:14.31,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So we wanted to develop an interface like this

169
0:07:16.93,000 --> 0:07:18,000
in the Bahamas, but in a more natural setting.

170
0:07:19.3,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And one of the reasons we thought we could do this

171
0:07:21.467,000 --> 0:07:23,000
is because the dolphins were starting to show us

172
0:07:23.489,000 --> 0:07:24,000
a lot of mutual curiosity.

173
0:07:25.093,000 --> 0:07:27,000
They were spontaneously mimicking our vocalizations

174
0:07:28.004,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and our postures, and they were also inviting us

175
0:07:30.324,000 --> 0:07:32,000
into dolphin games.

176
0:07:32.957,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Now, dolphins are social mammals, so they love to play,

177
0:07:35.604,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and one of their favorite games is to drag seaweed,

178
0:07:38.924,000 --> 0:07:41,000
or sargassum in this case, around.

179
0:07:42.036,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And they're very adept. They like to drag it

180
0:07:44.172,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and drop it from appendage to appendage.

181
0:07:48.492,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Now in this footage, the adult is Caroh.

182
0:07:51.188,000 --> 0:07:54,000
She's 25 years old here, and this is her newborn, Cobalt,

183
0:07:55.06,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and he's just learning how to play this game.

184
0:07:57.744,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Dolphin noises)

185
0:07:59.47,000 --> 0:08:03,000
She's kind of teasing him and taunting him.

186
0:08:03.94,000 --> 0:08:07,000
He really wants that sargassum.

187
0:08:08.369,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Now, when dolphins solicit humans for this game,

188
0:08:11.28,000 --> 0:08:14,000
they'll often sink vertically in the water,

189
0:08:14.331,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and they'll have a little sargassum on their flipper,

190
0:08:16.76,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and they'll sort of nudge it and drop it sometimes

191
0:08:19.379,000 --> 0:08:2,000
on the bottom and let us go get it,

192
0:08:20.913,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and then we'll have a little seaweed keep away game.

193
0:08:23.129,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But when we don't dive down and get it,

194
0:08:24.965,000 --> 0:08:25,000
they'll bring it to the surface

195
0:08:26.938,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and they'll sort of wave it in front of us on their tail

196
0:08:30.112,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and drop it for us like they do their calves,

197
0:08:32.198,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and then we'll pick it up and have a game.

198
0:08:34.4,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And so we started thinking, well, wouldn't it be neat

199
0:08:36.75,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to build some technology that would allow the dolphins

200
0:08:39.568,000 --> 0:08:42,000
to request these things in real time, their favorite toys?

201
0:08:42.843,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So the original vision was to have a keyboard

202
0:08:45.213,000 --> 0:08:47,000
hanging from the boat attached to a computer,

203
0:08:47.386,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and the divers and dolphins would activate the keys

204
0:08:49.901,000 --> 0:08:51,000
on the keypad and happily exchange information

205
0:08:52.791,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and request toys from each other.

206
0:08:54.949,000 --> 0:08:55,000
But we quickly found out that dolphins simply

207
0:08:56.743,000 --> 0:08:59,000
were not going to hang around the boat using a keyboard.

208
0:08:59.869,000 --> 0:09:01,000
They've got better things to do in the wild.

209
0:09:02.005,000 --> 0:09:04,000
They might do it in captivity, but in the wild --

210
0:09:04.269,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So we built a portable keyboard that we could push through the water,

211
0:09:06.994,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and we labeled four objects they like to play with,

212
0:09:09.734,000 --> 0:09:11,000
the scarf, rope, sargassum, and also had a bow ride,

213
0:09:12.675,000 --> 0:09:14,000
which is a fun activity for a dolphin. (Whistle)

214
0:09:14.786,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And that's the scarf whistle,

215
0:09:16.629,000 --> 0:09:18,000
which is also associated with a visual symbol.

216
0:09:19.547,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And these are artificially created whistles.

217
0:09:21.841,000 --> 0:09:23,000
They're outside the dolphin's normal repertoire,

218
0:09:24.469,000 --> 0:09:26,000
but they're easily mimicked by the dolphins.

219
0:09:26.889,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And I spent four years with my colleagues Adam Pack and Fabienne Delfour,

220
0:09:31.068,000 --> 0:09:33,000
working out in the field with this keyboard

221
0:09:33.289,000 --> 0:09:35,000
using it with each other to do requests for toys

222
0:09:35.933,000 --> 0:09:36,000
while the dolphins were watching.

223
0:09:37.592,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And the dolphins could get in on the game.

224
0:09:38.959,000 --> 0:09:39,000
They could point at the visual object,

225
0:09:40.894,000 --> 0:09:42,000
or they could mimic the whistle.

226
0:09:43.368,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Now this is video of a session.

227
0:09:46.736,000 --> 0:09:48,000
The diver here has a rope toy,

228
0:09:48.937,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and I'm on the keyboard on the left,

229
0:09:51.185,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and I've just played the rope key,

230
0:09:53.833,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and that's the request for the toy from the human.

231
0:09:57.044,000 --> 0:10:,000
So I've got the rope, I'm diving down,

232
0:10:00.247,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and I'm basically trying to get the dolphin's attention,

233
0:10:02.881,000 --> 0:10:03,000
because they're kind of like little kids.

234
0:10:03.949,000 --> 0:10:05,000
You have to keep their attention.

235
0:10:06.506,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I'm going to drop the rope, see if they come over.

236
0:10:11.193,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Here they come,

237
0:10:13.697,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and then they're going to pick up the rope

238
0:10:15.006,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and drag it around as a toy.

239
0:10:16.612,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Now, I'm at the keyboard on the left,

240
0:10:18.397,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and this is actually the first time that we tried this.

241
0:10:20.707,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I'm going to try to request this toy, the rope toy,

242
0:10:23.573,000 --> 0:10:25,000
from the dolphins using the rope sound.

243
0:10:26.141,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Let's see if they might actually understand what that means.

244
0:10:31.752,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Whistle)

245
0:10:32.978,000 --> 0:10:34,000
That's the rope whistle.

246
0:10:35.678,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Up come the dolphins,

247
0:10:36.975,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and drop off the rope, yay. Wow.

248
0:10:40.58,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Applause)

249
0:10:43.564,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So this is only once.

250
0:10:45.324,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We don't know for sure if they really understand the function of the whistles.

251
0:10:48.132,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Okay, so here's a second toy in the water.

252
0:10:50.6,000 --> 0:10:51,000
This is a scarf toy, and I'm trying to lead the dolphin

253
0:10:52.389,000 --> 0:10:54,000
over to the keyboard to show her

254
0:10:54.726,000 --> 0:10:57,000
the visual and the acoustic signal.

255
0:10:57.916,000 --> 0:11:,000
Now this dolphin, we call her "the scarf thief,"

256
0:11:00.983,000 --> 0:11:03,000
because over the years she's absconded

257
0:11:04.476,000 --> 0:11:06,000
with about 12 scarves.

258
0:11:07.054,000 --> 0:11:1,000
In fact, we think she has a boutique somewhere in the Bahamas.

259
0:11:10.828,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So I'm reaching over. She's got the scarf on her right side.

260
0:11:14.522,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And we try to not touch the animals too much,

261
0:11:16.286,000 --> 0:11:18,000
we really don't want to over-habituate them.

262
0:11:18.422,000 --> 0:11:2,000
And I'm trying to lead her back to the keyboard.

263
0:11:20.537,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And the diver there is going to activate the scarf sound

264
0:11:24.483,000 --> 0:11:25,000
to request the scarf.

265
0:11:26.294,000 --> 0:11:28,000
So I try to give her the scarf.

266
0:11:29.043,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Whoop. Almost lost it.

267
0:11:32.018,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But this is the moment where everything becomes possible.

268
0:11:34.934,000 --> 0:11:35,000
The dolphin's at the keyboard.

269
0:11:36.679,000 --> 0:11:37,000
You've got full attention.

270
0:11:38.237,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And this sometimes went on for hours.

271
0:11:40.493,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And I wanted to share this video with you

272
0:11:41.948,000 --> 0:11:42,000
not to show you any big breakthroughs,

273
0:11:43.733,000 --> 0:11:44,000
because they haven't happened yet,

274
0:11:44.853,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but to show you the level of intention and focus

275
0:11:47.479,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that these dolphins have, and interest in the system.

276
0:11:50.126,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And because of this, we really decided we needed

277
0:11:52.147,000 --> 0:11:54,000
some more sophisticated technology.

278
0:11:54.241,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So we joined forces with Georgia Tech,

279
0:11:56.441,000 --> 0:11:58,000
with Thad Starner's wearable computing group,

280
0:11:59.117,000 --> 0:12:,000
to build us an underwater wearable computer

281
0:12:01.079,000 --> 0:12:02,000
that we're calling CHAT. [CHAT: Cetacean Hearing And Telemetry]

282
0:12:02.945,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Now, instead of pushing a keyboard through the water,

283
0:12:04.981,000 --> 0:12:07,000
the diver's wearing the complete system, and it's acoustic only,

284
0:12:08.599,000 --> 0:12:11,000
so basically the diver activates the sounds on a keypad

285
0:12:11.607,000 --> 0:12:12,000
on the forearm,

286
0:12:12.786,000 --> 0:12:14,000
the sounds go out through an underwater speaker,

287
0:12:14.974,000 --> 0:12:15,000
if a dolphin mimics the whistle

288
0:12:16.384,000 --> 0:12:18,000
or a human plays the whistle, the sounds come in

289
0:12:18.893,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and are localized by two hydrophones.

290
0:12:21.469,000 --> 0:12:24,000
The computer can localize who requested the toy

291
0:12:24.816,000 --> 0:12:26,000
if there's a word match.

292
0:12:26.853,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And the real power of the system is in the real-time

293
0:12:29.417,000 --> 0:12:3,000
sound recognition, so we can respond to the dolphins

294
0:12:31.334,000 --> 0:12:33,000
quickly and accurately.

295
0:12:33.461,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And we're at prototype stage, but this is how we hope it will play out.

296
0:12:37.645,000 --> 0:12:4,000
So Diver A and Diver B both have a wearable computer

297
0:12:40.923,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and the dolphin hears the whistle as a whistle,

298
0:12:43.517,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the diver hears the whistle as a whistle in the water,

299
0:12:45.997,000 --> 0:12:47,000
but also as a word through bone conduction.

300
0:12:48.429,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So Diver A plays the scarf whistle

301
0:12:50.678,000 --> 0:12:51,000
or Diver B plays the sargassum whistle

302
0:12:52.574,000 --> 0:12:54,000
to request a toy from whoever has it.

303
0:12:54.99,000 --> 0:12:57,000
What we hope will happen is that the dolphin mimics the whistle,

304
0:12:58.199,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and if Diver A has the sargassum, if that's the sound

305
0:13:01.369,000 --> 0:13:03,000
that was played and requested,

306
0:13:04.114,000 --> 0:13:07,000
then the diver will give the sargassum to the requesting dolphin

307
0:13:07.962,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and they'll swim away happily into the sunset

308
0:13:09.778,000 --> 0:13:12,000
playing sargassum for forever.

309
0:13:12.895,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Now, how far can this kind of communication go?

310
0:13:16.275,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Well, CHAT is designed specifically to empower the dolphins

311
0:13:20.164,000 --> 0:13:21,000
to request things from us.

312
0:13:21.746,000 --> 0:13:23,000
It's designed to really be two-way.

313
0:13:24.139,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Now, will they learn to mimic the whistles functionally?

314
0:13:27.418,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We hope so and we think so.

315
0:13:29.299,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But as we decode their natural sounds,

316
0:13:31.443,000 --> 0:13:34,000
we're also planning to put those back into the computerized system.

317
0:13:35.031,000 --> 0:13:38,000
For example, right now we can put their own signature whistles

318
0:13:38.531,000 --> 0:13:42,000
in the computer and request to interact with a specific dolphin.

319
0:13:42.626,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Likewise, we can create our own whistles,

320
0:13:46.356,000 --> 0:13:48,000
our own whistle names, and let the dolphins

321
0:13:48.675,000 --> 0:13:5,000
request specific divers to interact with.

322
0:13:51.443,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Now it may be that all our mobile technology

323
0:13:54.364,000 --> 0:13:57,000
will actually be the same technology that helps us

324
0:13:57.5,000 --> 0:14:,000
communicate with another species down the road.

325
0:14:00.731,000 --> 0:14:03,000
In the case of a dolphin, you know, it's a species that,

326
0:14:04.363,000 --> 0:14:07,000
well, they're probably close to our intelligence in many ways

327
0:14:07.746,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and we might not be able to admit that right now,

328
0:14:10.289,000 --> 0:14:11,000
but they live in quite a different environment,

329
0:14:12.113,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and you still have to bridge the gap with the sensory systems.

330
0:14:16.613,000 --> 0:14:17,000
I mean, imagine what it would be like

331
0:14:18.297,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to really understand the mind

332
0:14:19.906,000 --> 0:14:22,000
of another intelligent species on the planet.

333
0:14:23.691,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Thank you.

334
0:14:25.039,000 --> 0:14:29,000
(Applause)

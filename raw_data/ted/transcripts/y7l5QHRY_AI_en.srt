1
0:00:13.04,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I believe big institutions

2
0:00:15.08,000 --> 0:00:17,000
have unique potential to create change,

3
0:00:17.72,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and I believe that we as individuals

4
0:00:19.72,000 --> 0:00:2,000
have unique power

5
0:00:21.04,000 --> 0:00:23,000
to influence the direction that those institutions take.

6
0:00:24.72,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now, these beliefs did not come naturally to me,

7
0:00:27.08,000 --> 0:00:29,000
because trusting big institutions,

8
0:00:29.68,000 --> 0:00:3,000
not really part of my family legacy.

9
0:00:32.64,000 --> 0:00:34,000
My mother escaped North Korea

10
0:00:34.76,000 --> 0:00:35,000
when she was 10 years old.

11
0:00:36.64,000 --> 0:00:4,000
To do so, she had to elude every big institution in her life:

12
0:00:40.68,000 --> 0:00:42,000
repressive governments, occupying armies

13
0:00:43.56,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and even armed border patrols.

14
0:00:46.72,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Later, when she decided she wanted to emigrate to the United States,

15
0:00:50.44,000 --> 0:00:52,000
she had to defy an entire culture

16
0:00:52.52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that said the girls would never be the best and brightest.

17
0:00:56.68,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Only because her name happens to sound like a boy's

18
0:00:59.64,000 --> 0:01:02,000
was she able to finagle her way into the government immigration exam

19
0:01:02.92,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to come to the United States.

20
0:01:05.6,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Because of her bravery and passion,

21
0:01:08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I've had all the opportunities that she never did,

22
0:01:10.88,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and that has made my story so different.

23
0:01:14.08,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Instead of running away from big institutions,

24
0:01:16.48,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I've actually run toward them.

25
0:01:18.32,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I've had the chance over the course of my career

26
0:01:20.6,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to work for The Wall Street Journal,

27
0:01:22.44,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the White House

28
0:01:23.68,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and now one of the largest financial institutions in the world,

29
0:01:26.68,000 --> 0:01:28,000
where I lead sustainable investing.

30
0:01:28.84,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now, these institutions are like tankers,

31
0:01:31.28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and working inside of them,

32
0:01:32.72,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I've come to appreciate what large wakes they can leave,

33
0:01:36.36,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and I've become convinced

34
0:01:37.68,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that the institution of the global capital markets,

35
0:01:40.44,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the nearly 290 trillion dollars of stocks and bonds in the world,

36
0:01:45.36,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that that may be one of our most powerful forces

37
0:01:48.24,000 --> 0:01:5,000
for positive social change at our disposal,

38
0:01:50.84,000 --> 0:01:51,000
if we ask it to be.

39
0:01:52.92,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Now, I know some of you are thinking,

40
0:01:54.8,000 --> 0:01:56,000
global capital markets, positive social change,

41
0:01:57.32,000 --> 0:02:,000
not usually in the same sentence or even the same paragraph.

42
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I think many people think of the capital markets

43
0:02:03.52,000 --> 0:02:04,000
kind of like an ocean.

44
0:02:04.84,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's a vast, impersonal, uncaring force of nature

45
0:02:08.68,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that is not affected by our wishes or desires.

46
0:02:11.36,000 --> 0:02:13,000
So the best that our little savings accounts

47
0:02:13.72,000 --> 0:02:14,000
or retirement accounts can do

48
0:02:15.44,000 --> 0:02:17,000
is to try to catch some waves in the good cycles

49
0:02:18.04,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and hope that we don't get inundated in the turbulent ones,

50
0:02:20.826,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but certainly our decisions on how to steer our little retirement accounts

51
0:02:25.08,000 --> 0:02:26,000
don't affect the tides,

52
0:02:26.6,000 --> 0:02:29,000
don't change the shape or size or direction of the waves.

53
0:02:31.8,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But why is that?

54
0:02:33.04,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Because actually, one third of this ocean of capital

55
0:02:36.4,000 --> 0:02:39,000
actually belongs to individuals like us,

56
0:02:40.04,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and most of the rest of the capital markets

57
0:02:42.12,000 --> 0:02:45,000
is controlled by the institutions that get their power and authority

58
0:02:45.36,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and their capital from us,

59
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
as members, participants, beneficiaries, shareholders or citizens.

60
0:02:51.32,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So if we are the ultimate owners of the capital markets,

61
0:02:55.24,000 --> 0:02:57,000
why aren't we able to make our voices heard?

62
0:02:58.36,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Why can't we make some waves?

63
0:03:00.96,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So let me ask you a different question:

64
0:03:02.88,000 --> 0:03:04,000
did any of you buy fair trade coffee

65
0:03:05.12,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the last time you were at a supermarket or at Starbucks?

66
0:03:07.8,000 --> 0:03:09,000
OK. Do any of you go to the restaurant

67
0:03:10.24,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and order the sustainably farmed trout

68
0:03:12.92,000 --> 0:03:14,000
instead of the miso-glazed Chilean sea bass

69
0:03:15.48,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that you really wish you could have?

70
0:03:17.96,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Do any of you drive hybrid cars or even electric cars?

71
0:03:21.44,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So why do we do these things?

72
0:03:23.56,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Right? One electric car doesn't amount to much in a fleet of 1.2 billion

73
0:03:27.44,000 --> 0:03:28,000
combustion engine vehicles.

74
0:03:29.76,000 --> 0:03:31,000
One fish is just one fish in the sea.

75
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And one cup of coffee

76
0:03:35.36,000 --> 0:03:37,000
doesn't amount to a hill of beans in this crazy world.

77
0:03:39.4,000 --> 0:03:41,000
But we do these things because we believe they matter,

78
0:03:41.96,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that our actions add up,

79
0:03:43.24,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that our choices might influence others

80
0:03:45.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and collectively, what an impact we can have.

81
0:03:48.44,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So, in my bag I have a coffee mug that I bought a couple of years ago.

82
0:03:51.88,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It's a reusable mug. It has all these things printed on it.

83
0:03:54.84,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Look at some of the things that are on it, that it says.

84
0:03:57.96,000 --> 0:03:59,000
"This one cup can be used again and again."

85
0:04:00.52,000 --> 0:04:03,000
"This one cup may inspire others to use one too."

86
0:04:04.4,000 --> 0:04:06,000
"This one cup helps save the planet."

87
0:04:06.72,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I had no idea this plastic cup was so powerful.

88
0:04:09.2,000 --> 0:04:1,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:10.32,000 --> 0:04:11,000
So why do we think that our choice

90
0:04:12.24,000 --> 0:04:15,000
of a four dollar shade-grown fair trade artisanal cup of coffee

91
0:04:16.08,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in a reusable mug matters,

92
0:04:18.28,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but what we do with 4,000 dollars in our investment account

93
0:04:21.066,000 --> 0:04:22,000
for our IRA doesn't?

94
0:04:23.8,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Why can't we tell the supermarket and the capital markets

95
0:04:26.92,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that we care,

96
0:04:28.36,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that we care about fair labor standards,

97
0:04:30.64,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that we care about sustainable production methods

98
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and about healthy communities?

99
0:04:34.88,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Why aren't we voting with our investment dollars,

100
0:04:37.92,000 --> 0:04:38,000
but we would vote with our lattes?

101
0:04:40.52,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So I think it has something to do with the myths,

102
0:04:43.76,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the fables that we all carry around in our collective consciousness.

103
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Do you remember the Grimm's fairy tale about the magic porridge pot?

104
0:04:50.6,000 --> 0:04:52,000
If you said to the pot, "Boil, little pot, boil,"

105
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
it would fill up with sweet porridge.

106
0:04:55.32,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And if you said, "Stop, little pot, stop,"

107
0:04:57.44,000 --> 0:04:58,000
it would stop.

108
0:04:59.44,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But if you got the words wrong, it wouldn't listen,

109
0:05:02.64,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and things could go terribly awry.

110
0:05:05.64,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So I think when it comes to markets,

111
0:05:07.4,000 --> 0:05:09,000
we have a little bit of a similar fable in our heads.

112
0:05:09.92,000 --> 0:05:11,000
We believe that the markets is this magic pot

113
0:05:12.28,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that obeys only one command:

114
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
make more money.

115
0:05:16.92,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Only those words said exactly that way

116
0:05:19.84,000 --> 0:05:2,000
will make the pot fill up with gold.

117
0:05:22.64,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Add in some extra words like "protect the environment,"

118
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
the spell might not work.

119
0:05:28.4,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Put in the wrong words like "promote social justice,"

120
0:05:32.56,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and you might see your gold coins shrink

121
0:05:34.6,000 --> 0:05:36,000
or even vanish entirely, according to this fable.

122
0:05:38.44,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So we asked people, what do you really think?

123
0:05:41.24,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And we actually went out and polled a thousand individual investors,

124
0:05:45.48,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and we found something fascinating.

125
0:05:47.52,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Overwhelmingly,

126
0:05:49.04,000 --> 0:05:52,000
people wanted to add those extra words into the formula.

127
0:05:52.68,000 --> 0:05:55,000
71 percent of people said yes,

128
0:05:55.76,000 --> 0:05:57,000
they were interested in sustainable investing,

129
0:05:58.36,000 --> 0:06:,000
which we define as taking the best in class investment process

130
0:06:01.32,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that you already have traditionally

131
0:06:03.08,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and adding in the extra information you get

132
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
when you think about the environment and society and good governance.

133
0:06:08.44,000 --> 0:06:09,000
71 percent wanted that.

134
0:06:10.2,000 --> 0:06:13,000
72 percent said that they believe that companies who did that

135
0:06:13.88,000 --> 0:06:14,000
would actually do better financially.

136
0:06:15.72,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So people really do believe that you can do well by doing good.

137
0:06:19.4,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But here was the weird thing:

138
0:06:20.84,000 --> 0:06:21,000
54 percent of the people

139
0:06:22.4,000 --> 0:06:26,000
still said if they put their money in those kinds of stocks,

140
0:06:26.6,000 --> 0:06:28,000
they thought that they would make less money.

141
0:06:29.88,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So is it true?

142
0:06:31.52,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Do you get less sweet porridge if you invest in shade-grown coffee

143
0:06:35.32,000 --> 0:06:36,000
instead of drinking it?

144
0:06:37.84,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Well, you know, the investors in companies like Burt's Bees

145
0:06:41.04,000 --> 0:06:42,000
or Ben & Jerry's wouldn't say so.

146
0:06:42.84,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Right? Both of those started out as small, socially conscious companies

147
0:06:46.84,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that ended up becoming so popular with consumers

148
0:06:5,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that the giants Unilever and Clorox bought them

149
0:06:53.08,000 --> 0:06:55,000
for hundreds of millions of dollars

150
0:06:55.88,000 --> 0:06:56,000
each.

151
0:06:57.84,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But here's the important thing.

152
0:06:59.4,000 --> 0:07:,000
Those corporations realized

153
0:07:00.76,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that if they wanted to protect the value of their investments,

154
0:07:03.72,000 --> 0:07:05,000
they had to preserve that socially conscious mission.

155
0:07:06.24,000 --> 0:07:08,000
If they didn't keep adding in those extra words

156
0:07:08.48,000 --> 0:07:1,000
of environmentally friendly and socially conscious,

157
0:07:10.92,000 --> 0:07:12,000
those brands wouldn't make more money.

158
0:07:14.44,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But maybe this is just the exception the proves the rule, right?

159
0:07:17.8,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The serious companies that fund our economy

160
0:07:20.36,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and that fund our retirements and that really make the world go round,

161
0:07:23.68,000 --> 0:07:25,000
they need to stick to making more money.

162
0:07:26.96,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So, Harvard Business School actually researched this,

163
0:07:29.68,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and they found something fascinating.

164
0:07:31.466,000 --> 0:07:33,000
If you had invested a dollar 20 years ago

165
0:07:34.12,000 --> 0:07:35,000
in a portfolio of companies

166
0:07:35.8,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that focused narrowly on making more money

167
0:07:38.04,000 --> 0:07:39,000
quarter by quarter,

168
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that one dollar

169
0:07:41.44,000 --> 0:07:44,000
would have grown to 14 dollars and 46 cents.

170
0:07:45.32,000 --> 0:07:47,000
That's not bad until you consider

171
0:07:47.6,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that if instead you'd invested that same dollar

172
0:07:50.64,000 --> 0:07:51,000
in a portfolio of companies

173
0:07:52.32,000 --> 0:07:53,000
that focused on growing their business

174
0:07:54.154,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and on the most important environmental and social issues,

175
0:07:58.04,000 --> 0:08:,000
that one dollar would have grown

176
0:08:00.24,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to 28 dollars and 36 cents.

177
0:08:04.24,000 --> 0:08:06,000
almost twice as much sweet porridge.

178
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Now, let's be clear, they didn't make that outperformance

179
0:08:10.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
by giving away money to seem like a nice corporate citizen.

180
0:08:13.08,000 --> 0:08:16,000
They did it by focusing on the things that matter to their business,

181
0:08:16.32,000 --> 0:08:18,000
like wasting less energy and water

182
0:08:18.76,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in their manufacturing processes;

183
0:08:20.56,000 --> 0:08:23,000
like making sure the CEO contracts had the CEOs incentivized

184
0:08:23.96,000 --> 0:08:26,000
for the long-term results of the company and the communities they served,

185
0:08:27.44,000 --> 0:08:28,000
not just quarterly results;

186
0:08:28.84,000 --> 0:08:3,000
or building a first class culture

187
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
that would have higher employee loyalty,

188
0:08:33.52,000 --> 0:08:34,000
retention and productivity.

189
0:08:36.48,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now, Harvard's not alone.

190
0:08:37.76,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Oxford also did a research study where they examined 120 different studies

191
0:08:41.8,000 --> 0:08:44,000
looking at the effect of sustainability and economic results,

192
0:08:45.28,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and they found time and time and time again

193
0:08:48.08,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that the companies that cared about these kinds of important things

194
0:08:51.96,000 --> 0:08:53,000
actually had better operational efficiency,

195
0:08:54.6,000 --> 0:08:55,000
lower cost of capital

196
0:08:56.44,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and better performance in their stock price.

197
0:08:59.32,000 --> 0:09:,000
And then there's Al Gore.

198
0:09:00.88,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So 20 years ago, when I worked for Al Gore in the White House,

199
0:09:03.84,000 --> 0:09:06,000
he was one of the early pioneers pleading with businesses and governments

200
0:09:07.32,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to pay attention to the challenges of climate change.

201
0:09:10.04,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Post-White House, he opened an investment firm called Generation,

202
0:09:13.112,000 --> 0:09:16,000
where he baked environmental sustainability and other things

203
0:09:16.4,000 --> 0:09:17,000
right into the core investment process.

204
0:09:18.84,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And at the time there was a good bit of skepticism about his views.

205
0:09:22.52,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Ten years later, his track record is one more proof point

206
0:09:26.28,000 --> 0:09:29,000
that sustainable investing done right can be sound investing.

207
0:09:3,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Far from making less sweet porridge

208
0:09:31.88,000 --> 0:09:33,000
because he added sustainability into the mix,

209
0:09:34.28,000 --> 0:09:36,000
he actually significantly outperformed the benchmark.

210
0:09:37.56,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Now, sustainable investing,

211
0:09:39.12,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the good news is it doesn't require a magic spell

212
0:09:42.92,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and it doesn't require some investment secret,

213
0:09:46.12,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and it's not just for the elite.

214
0:09:47.72,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It is not just about private equity for billionaires.

215
0:09:51.24,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's not just groovy-sounding investments like clean technology

216
0:09:54.217,000 --> 0:09:55,000
or microfinance in emerging markets

217
0:09:55.937,000 --> 0:09:57,000
or artisanal bakeries in Brooklyn.

218
0:09:59,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It's about stocks and bonds and Fortune 500 companies.

219
0:10:02.04,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It's about mutual funds.

220
0:10:03.28,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It's about all the things

221
0:10:04.76,000 --> 0:10:06,000
we already see in the market today.

222
0:10:07.52,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So here's why I'm convinced

223
0:10:09.52,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that we collectively have the power

224
0:10:11.68,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to make sustainable investing the new normal.

225
0:10:15.56,000 --> 0:10:19,000
First, the proof points are coming out all the time

226
0:10:19.8,000 --> 0:10:21,000
that sustainable investing done right,

227
0:10:21.84,000 --> 0:10:24,000
preserving all the same good principles of investing,

228
0:10:25.08,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the traditional sphere, can pay.

229
0:10:27.52,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It makes sense.

230
0:10:29.36,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Secondly,

231
0:10:30.8,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the biggest obstacle standing in our way

232
0:10:32.96,000 --> 0:10:34,000
may actually just be in our heads.

233
0:10:35.52,000 --> 0:10:37,000
We just need to let go of that myth

234
0:10:37.6,000 --> 0:10:41,000
that if you add your values into your investment thinking,

235
0:10:41.88,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that you get less sweet porridge.

236
0:10:43.52,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And once you get rid of the fable,

237
0:10:45.2,000 --> 0:10:48,000
you can actually start appreciating those facts we've been talking about.

238
0:10:48.68,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And third, the future is already here.

239
0:10:50.68,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Sustainable investment today is a 20 trillion dollar market

240
0:10:53.68,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and it's the fastest-growing segment of the investment industry.

241
0:10:57.08,000 --> 0:11:,000
In the United States, it has grown enormously, as you can see.

242
0:11:00.32,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It now represents one out of every six dollars

243
0:11:03.04,000 --> 0:11:05,000
under professional management in the United States.

244
0:11:06.4,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So what are we waiting for?

245
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:12,000
For me, it goes back to the inspiration that I received from my mother.

246
0:11:13.24,000 --> 0:11:14,000
She knew that she wanted a life

247
0:11:14.8,000 --> 0:11:16,000
where she would have the freedom to make her own choices

248
0:11:18.28,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and to have her voice heard and write her own story.

249
0:11:21.52,000 --> 0:11:23,000
She was passionate about that goal

250
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and she was clear that she would let no army, no obstacle,

251
0:11:27.64,000 --> 0:11:29,000
no big institution stand in her way.

252
0:11:31.04,000 --> 0:11:32,000
She made it to the States,

253
0:11:32.92,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and she became a teacher,

254
0:11:34.68,000 --> 0:11:35,000
an award-winning author

255
0:11:36.4,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and a mother,

256
0:11:37.68,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and ended up sending her daughters to Harvard.

257
0:11:40.4,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And these days, you can tell that she is amply comfortable

258
0:11:43.52,000 --> 0:11:47,000
holding court in the most powerful institutions in the world.

259
0:11:47.6,000 --> 0:11:48,000
It seems almost too prophetic

260
0:11:49.52,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that her name in Korean means

261
0:11:51.84,000 --> 0:11:52,000
"passionate clarity."

262
0:11:54.28,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Passionate clarity:

263
0:11:55.96,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that's what I think we need to drive change.

264
0:11:58.76,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Passion about the change we want to see in the world,

265
0:12:02.12,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and clarity that we are able to help chart the course.

266
0:12:06.52,000 --> 0:12:08,000
We have more opportunity today than ever before

267
0:12:09.52,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to make choices.

268
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
We have more power than ever before to make our voices heard.

269
0:12:16.8,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So change your perspective.

270
0:12:20.24,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Vote with your small change.

271
0:12:21.96,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Invest in the change you want to see in the world.

272
0:12:25.8,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Change the fables

273
0:12:27.6,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and change the markets.

274
0:12:29.28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
Thank you.

275
0:12:30.52,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Applause)

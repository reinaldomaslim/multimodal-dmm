1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Many times

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I go around the world to speak,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and people ask me questions

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
about the challenges,

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
my moments,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
some of my regrets.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
1998:

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
A single mother of four,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
three months after the birth of my fourth child,

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I went to do a job

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
as a research assistant.

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I went to Northern Liberia.

13
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And as part of the work,

14
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
the village would give you lodgings.

15
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And they gave me lodging with a single mother

16
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and her daughter.

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
This girl happened to be

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
the only girl in the entire village

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
who had made it

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
to the ninth grade.

21
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
She was the laughing stock of the community.

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Her mother was often told by other women,

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
"You and your child

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
will die poor."

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
After two weeks of working in that village,

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
it was time to go back.

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The mother came to me, knelt down,

28
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and said, "Leymah, take my daughter.

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I wish for her

30
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to be a nurse."

31
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Dirt poor, living in the home with my parents,

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I couldn't afford to.

33
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
With tears in my eyes,

34
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I said, "No."

35
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Two months later,

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I go to another village

37
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
on the same assignment

38
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and they asked me to live with the village chief.

39
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The women's chief of the village has this little girl,

40
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
fair color like me,

41
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
totally dirty.

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And all day she walked around

43
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
only in her underwear.

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
When I asked, "Who is that?"

45
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
She said, "That's Wei.

46
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
The meaning of her name is pig.

47
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Her mother died while giving birth to her,

48
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and no one had any idea who her father was."

49
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
For two weeks, she became my companion,

50
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
slept with me.

51
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I bought her used clothes

52
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and bought her her first doll.

53
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
The night before I left,

54
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
she came to the room

55
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and said, "Leymah, don't leave me here.

56
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I wish to go with you.

57
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I wish to go to school."

58
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Dirt poor, no money,

59
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
living with my parents,

60
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
I again said, "No."

61
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Two months later,

62
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
both of those villages fell into another war.

63
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Till today, I have no idea

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
where those two girls are.

65
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Fast-forward, 2004:

66
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
In the peak of our activism,

67
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the minister of Gender Liberia called me

68
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and said, "Leymah, I have a nine-year-old for you.

69
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I want you to bring her home

70
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
because we don't have safe homes."

71
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The story of this little girl:

72
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
She had been raped

73
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
by her paternal grandfather

74
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
every day for six months.

75
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
She came to me bloated,

76
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
very pale.

77
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Every night I'd come from work and lie on the cold floor.

78
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
She'd lie beside me

79
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and say, "Auntie, I wish to be well.

80
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I wish to go to school."

81
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
2010:

82
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
A young woman stands before President Sirleaf

83
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and gives her testimony

84
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
of how she and her siblings live together,

85
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
their father and mother died during the war.

86
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
She's 19; her dream is to go to college

87
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
to be able to support them.

88
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
She's highly athletic.

89
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
One of the things that happens

90
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is that she applies for a scholarship.

91
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Full scholarship. She gets it.

92
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Her dream of going to school,

93
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
her wish of being educated,

94
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
is finally here.

95
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
She goes to school on the first day.

96
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The director of sports

97
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
who's responsible for getting her into the program

98
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
asks her to come out of class.

99
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And for the next three years,

100
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
her fate will be

101
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
having sex with him every day,

102
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
as a favor for getting her in school.

103
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Globally, we have policies,

104
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
international instruments,

105
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
work leaders.

106
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Great people have made commitments --

107
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
we will protect our children

108
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
from want and from fear.

109
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
The U.N. has the Convention on the Rights of the Child.

110
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Countries like America, we've heard things like No Child Left Behind.

111
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Other countries come with different things.

112
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
There is a Millennium Development called Three

113
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that focuses on girls.

114
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
All of these great works by great people

115
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
aimed at getting young people

116
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
to where we want to get them globally,

117
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
I think, has failed.

118
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
In Liberia, for example,

119
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the teenage pregnancy rate

120
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is three to every 10 girls.

121
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Teen prostitution is at its peak.

122
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
In one community, we're told,

123
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
you wake up in the morning

124
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and see used condoms like used chewing gum paper.

125
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Girls as young as 12 being prostituted

126
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
for less than a dollar a night.

127
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It's disheartening, it's sad.

128
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And then someone asked me,

129
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
just before my TEDTalk, a few days ago,

130
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
"So where is the hope?"

131
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Several years ago, a few friends of mine

132
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
decided we needed to bridge the disconnect

133
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
between our generation

134
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and the generation of young women.

135
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's not enough to say

136
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
you have two Nobel laureates from the Republic of Liberia

137
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
when your girls' kids are totally out there

138
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and no hope, or seemingly no hope.

139
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We created a space

140
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
called the Young Girls Transformative Project.

141
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We go into rural communities

142
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and all we do, like has been done in this room,

143
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
is create the space.

144
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
When these girls sit,

145
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
you unlock intelligence,

146
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
you unlock passion,

147
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
you unlock commitment,

148
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
you unlock focus,

149
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
you unlock great leaders.

150
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Today, we've worked with over 300.

151
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And some of those girls

152
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
who walked in the room very shy

153
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
have taken bold steps, as young mothers,

154
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to go out there and advocate

155
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
for the rights of other young women.

156
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
One young woman I met,

157
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
teen mother of four,

158
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
never thought about finishing high school,

159
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
graduated successfully;

160
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
never thought about going to college,

161
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
enrolled in college.

162
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
One day she said to me,

163
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
"My wish is to finish college

164
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and be able to support my children."

165
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
She's at a place where she can't find money

166
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to go to school.

167
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
She sells water, sells soft drinks

168
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and sells recharge cards for cellphones.

169
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And you would think she would take that money

170
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and put it back into her education.

171
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Juanita is her name.

172
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
She takes that money

173
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and finds single mothers in her community

174
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to send back to school.

175
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Says, "Leymah, my wish

176
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is to be educated.

177
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And if I can't be educated,

178
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
when I see some of my sisters being educated,

179
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
my wish has been fulfilled.

180
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
I wish for a better life.

181
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I wish for food for my children.

182
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I wish that sexual abuse and exploitation in schools would stop."

183
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
This is the dream of the African girl.

184
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Several years ago,

185
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
there was one African girl.

186
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
This girl had a son

187
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
who wished for a piece of doughnut

188
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
because he was extremely hungry.

189
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Angry, frustrated,

190
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
really upset

191
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
about the state of her society

192
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and the state of her children,

193
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
this young girl started a movement,

194
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
a movement of ordinary women

195
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
banding together

196
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
to build peace.

197
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I will fulfill the wish.

198
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This is another African girl's wish.

199
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I failed to fulfill the wish of those two girls.

200
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I failed to do this.

201
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
These were the things that were going through the head of this other young woman --

202
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I failed, I failed, I failed.

203
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So I will do this.

204
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Women came out,

205
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
protested a brutal dictator,

206
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
fearlessly spoke.

207
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Not only did the wish of a piece of doughnut come true,

208
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the wish of peace came true.

209
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
This young woman

210
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
wished also to go to school.

211
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
She went to school.

212
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
This young woman wished for other things to happen,

213
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
it happened for her.

214
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Today, this young woman is me,

215
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
a Nobel laureate.

216
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I'm now on a journey

217
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to fulfill the wish,

218
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in my tiny capacity,

219
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
of little African girls --

220
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
the wish of being educated.

221
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
We set up a foundation.

222
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
We're giving full four-year scholarships

223
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to girls from villages that we see with potential.

224
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
I don't have much to ask of you.

225
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I've also been to places in this U.S.,

226
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and I know that girls in this country

227
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
also have wishes,

228
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
a wish for a better life somewhere in the Bronx,

229
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
a wish for a better life

230
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
somewhere in downtown L.A.,

231
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
a wish for a better life somewhere in Texas,

232
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
a wish for a better life somewhere in New York,

233
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
a wish for a better life

234
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
somewhere in New Jersey.

235
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Will you journey with me

236
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to help that girl,

237
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
be it an African girl or an American girl

238
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
or a Japanese girl,

239
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
fulfill her wish,

240
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
fulfill her dream,

241
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
achieve that dream?

242
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Because all of these

243
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
great innovators and inventors

244
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that we've talked to and seen

245
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
over the last few days

246
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
are also sitting in tiny corners

247
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
in different parts of the world,

248
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and all they're asking us to do

249
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
is create that space

250
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
to unlock the intelligence,

251
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
unlock the passion,

252
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
unlock all of the great things

253
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
that they hold within themselves.

254
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Let's journey together. Let's journey together.

255
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Thank you.

256
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
(Applause)

257
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you so much.

258
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Right now in Liberia,

259
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
what do you see

260
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
as the main issue that troubles you?

261
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
LG: I've been asked to lead

262
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
the Liberian Reconciliation Initiative.

263
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
As part of my work,

264
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
I'm doing these tours

265
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
in different villages and towns --

266
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
13, 15 hours on dirt roads --

267
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and there is no community that I've gone into

268
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that I haven't seen intelligent girls.

269
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
But sadly,

270
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
the vision of a great future,

271
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
or the dream of a great future,

272
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
is just a dream,

273
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
because you have all of these vices.

274
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Teen pregnancy, like I said, is epidemic.

275
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
So what troubles me

276
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
is that I was at that place

277
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and somehow I'm at this place,

278
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
and I just don't want to be the only one

279
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
at this place.

280
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
I'm looking for ways

281
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
for other girls to be with me.

282
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I want to look back 20 years from now

283
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and see that there's another Liberian girl,

284
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Ghanaian girl, Nigerian girl, Ethiopian girl

285
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
standing on this TED stage.

286
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And maybe, just maybe, saying,

287
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
"Because of that Nobel laureate

288
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
I'm here today."

289
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So I'm troubled

290
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
when I see them like there's no hope.

291
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
But I'm also not pessimistic,

292
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
because I know it doesn't take a lot

293
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
to get them charged up.

294
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
CA: And in the last year,

295
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
tell us one hopeful thing

296
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
that you've seen happening.

297
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
LG: I can tell you many hopeful things that I've seen happening.

298
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
But in the last year,

299
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
where President Sirleaf comes from, her village,

300
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:12:59,000
we went there to work with these girls.

301
0:12:59.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And we could not find 25 girls

302
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
in high school.

303
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
All of these girls went to the gold mine,

304
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
and they were predominantly prostitutes

305
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
doing other things.

306
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
We took 50 of those girls

307
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and we worked with them.

308
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And this was at the beginning of elections.

309
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
This is one place where women were never --

310
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
even the older ones

311
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
barely sat in the circle with the men.

312
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
These girls banded together and formed a group

313
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and launched a campaign

314
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
for voter registration.

315
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
This is a real rural village.

316
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And the theme they used was:

317
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
"Even pretty girls vote."

318
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
They were able to mobilize young women.

319
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
But not only did they do that,

320
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
they went to those who were running for seats

321
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
to ask them, "What is it

322
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
that you will give the girls of this community

323
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
when you win?"

324
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And one of the guys

325
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
who already had a seat was very --

326
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
because Liberia has one of the strongest rape laws,

327
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
and he was one of those really fighting in parliament

328
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
to overturn that law

329
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
because he called it barbaric.

330
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
Rape is not barbaric, but the law, he said, was barbaric.

331
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And when the girls started engaging him,

332
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
he was very hostile towards them.

333
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
These little girls turned to him and said,

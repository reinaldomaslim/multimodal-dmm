1
0:00:12.62,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When we think about mapping cities,

2
0:00:14.395,000 --> 0:00:16,000
we tend to think about roads and streets and buildings,

3
0:00:17.2,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and the settlement narrative that led to their creation,

4
0:00:2,000 --> 0:00:22,000
or you might think about the bold vision of an urban designer,

5
0:00:22.984,000 --> 0:00:24,000
but there's other ways to think about mapping cities

6
0:00:25.487,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and how they got to be made.

7
0:00:27.653,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Today, I want to show you a new kind of map.

8
0:00:29.746,000 --> 0:00:3,000
This is not a geographic map.

9
0:00:31.242,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This is a map of the relationships between people in my hometown

10
0:00:34.373,000 --> 0:00:35,000
of Baltimore, Maryland,

11
0:00:35.713,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and what you can see here is that each dot represents a person,

12
0:00:40.13,000 --> 0:00:43,000
each line represents a relationship between those people,

13
0:00:43.424,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and each color represents a community within the network.

14
0:00:46.87,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now, I'm here on the green side, down on the far right where the geeks are,

15
0:00:51.732,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and TEDx also is down on the far right. (Laughter)

16
0:00:55.58,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Now, on the other side of the network,

17
0:00:58.157,000 --> 0:01:,000
you tend to have primarily African-American and Latino folks

18
0:01:01.117,000 --> 0:01:04,000
who are really concerned about somewhat different things than the geeks are,

19
0:01:04.707,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but just to give some sense,

20
0:01:06.148,000 --> 0:01:08,000
the green part of the network we call Smalltimore,

21
0:01:08.554,000 --> 0:01:09,000
for those of us that inhabit it,

22
0:01:10.099,000 --> 0:01:12,000
because it seems as though we're living in a very small town.

23
0:01:13.014,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We see the same people over and over again,

24
0:01:15.048,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but that's because we're not really exploring

25
0:01:17.219,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the full depth and breadth of the city.

26
0:01:20.081,000 --> 0:01:21,000
On the other end of the network,

27
0:01:21.833,000 --> 0:01:23,000
you have folks who are interested in things like hip-hop music

28
0:01:24.77,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and they even identify with living in the DC/Maryland/Virginia area

29
0:01:28.574,000 --> 0:01:32,000
over, say, the Baltimore city designation proper.

30
0:01:32.99,000 --> 0:01:34,000
But in the middle, you see that there's

31
0:01:35.09,000 --> 0:01:37,000
something that connects the two communities together,

32
0:01:37.573,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and that's sports.

33
0:01:38.452,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We have the Baltimore Orioles, the Baltimore Ravens football team,

34
0:01:41.54,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Michael Phelps, the Olympian.

35
0:01:42.986,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Under Armour, you may have heard of, is a Baltimore company,

36
0:01:45.824,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and that community of sports acts as the only bridge

37
0:01:48.257,000 --> 0:01:5,000
between these two ends of the network.

38
0:01:50.528,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Let's take a look at San Francisco.

39
0:01:52.423,000 --> 0:01:55,000
You see something a little bit different happening in San Francisco.

40
0:01:55.609,000 --> 0:01:59,000
On the one hand, you do have the media, politics and news lobe

41
0:02:00.002,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that tends to exist in Baltimore and other cities,

42
0:02:02.537,000 --> 0:02:04,000
but you also have this very predominant group

43
0:02:04.892,000 --> 0:02:08,000
of geeks and techies that are sort of taking over the top half of the network,

44
0:02:09.285,000 --> 0:02:11,000
and there's even a group that's so distinct and clear

45
0:02:11.787,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that we can identify it as Twitter employees,

46
0:02:14.137,000 --> 0:02:17,000
next to the geeks, in between the gamers and the geeks,

47
0:02:17.504,000 --> 0:02:19,000
at the opposite end of the hip-hop spectrum.

48
0:02:20.445,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So you can see, though,

49
0:02:22.162,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that the tensions that we've heard about in San Francisco

50
0:02:24.843,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in terms of people being concerned about gentrification

51
0:02:27.764,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and all the new tech companies that are bringing new wealth

52
0:02:30.523,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and settlement into the city are real,

53
0:02:32.62,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and you can actually see that documented here.

54
0:02:34.849,000 --> 0:02:36,000
You can see the LGBT community

55
0:02:36.869,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is not really getting along with the geek community that well,

56
0:02:40.165,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the arts community, the music community.

57
0:02:42.297,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And so it leads to things like this.

58
0:02:44.07,000 --> 0:02:44,000
["Evict Twitter"]

59
0:02:45.043,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Somebody sent me this photo a few weeks ago,

60
0:02:46.867,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and it shows what is happening on the ground in San Francisco,

61
0:02:49.774,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and I think you can actually try to understand that

62
0:02:52.158,000 --> 0:02:53,000
through looking at a map like this.

63
0:02:53.86,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Let's take a look at Rio de Janeiro.

64
0:02:55.62,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I spent the last few weeks gathering data about Rio,

65
0:02:58.074,000 --> 0:03:,000
and one of the things that stood out to me about this city

66
0:03:00.881,000 --> 0:03:02,000
is that everything's really kind of mixed up.

67
0:03:03.003,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It's a very heterogenous city in a way that Baltimore or San Francisco is not.

68
0:03:07.107,000 --> 0:03:09,000
You still have the lobe of people involved

69
0:03:09.562,000 --> 0:03:11,000
with government, newspapers, politics, columnists.

70
0:03:11.946,000 --> 0:03:14,000
TEDxRio is down in the lower right, right next to bloggers and writers.

71
0:03:15.35,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But then you also have this tremendous diversity of people

72
0:03:18.059,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that are interested in different kinds of music.

73
0:03:20.333,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Even Justin Bieber fans are represented here.

74
0:03:22.537,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Other boy bands, country singers,

75
0:03:25.429,000 --> 0:03:27,000
gospel music, funk and rap and stand-up comedy,

76
0:03:28.337,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and there's even a whole section around drugs and jokes.

77
0:03:31.376,000 --> 0:03:32,000
How cool is that?

78
0:03:32.862,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And then the Flamengo football team is also represented here.

79
0:03:35.996,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So you have that same kind of spread

80
0:03:38.156,000 --> 0:03:4,000
of sports and civics and the arts and music,

81
0:03:40.871,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but it's represented in a very different way,

82
0:03:43.032,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and I think that maybe fits with our understanding of Rio

83
0:03:46.352,000 --> 0:03:5,000
as being a very multicultural, musically diverse city.

84
0:03:50.366,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So we have all this data.

85
0:03:53.984,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It's an incredibly rich set of data that we have about cities now,

86
0:03:57.102,000 --> 0:04:,000
maybe even richer than any data set that we've ever had before.

87
0:04:00.348,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So what can we do with it?

88
0:04:02.272,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Well, I think the first thing that we can try to understand

89
0:04:05.142,000 --> 0:04:07,000
is that segregation is a social construct.

90
0:04:07.48,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's something that we choose to do, and we could choose not to do it,

91
0:04:10.824,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and if you kind of think about it,

92
0:04:12.756,000 --> 0:04:15,000
what we're doing with this data is aiming a space telescope at a city

93
0:04:16.167,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and looking at it as if was a giant high school cafeteria,

94
0:04:19.199,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and seeing how everybody arranged themselves in a seating chart.

95
0:04:22.937,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Well maybe it's time to shake up the seating chart a little bit.

96
0:04:26.25,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The other thing that we start to realize

97
0:04:28.79,000 --> 0:04:3,000
is that race is a really poor proxy for diversity.

98
0:04:31.428,000 --> 0:04:33,000
We've got people represented from all different types of races

99
0:04:34.365,000 --> 0:04:36,000
across the entire map here --

100
0:04:36.691,000 --> 0:04:38,000
only looking at race

101
0:04:39.067,000 --> 0:04:41,000
doesn't really contribute to our development of diversity.

102
0:04:41.785,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So if we're trying to use diversity

103
0:04:43.524,000 --> 0:04:46,000
as a way to tackle some of our more intractable problems,

104
0:04:46.605,000 --> 0:04:49,000
we need to start to think about diversity in a new way.

105
0:04:49.899,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And lastly, we have the ability to create

106
0:04:53.426,000 --> 0:04:56,000
interventions to start to reshape our cities in a new way,

107
0:04:56.52,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and I believe that if we have that capability,

108
0:04:59.12,000 --> 0:05:02,000
we may even bear some responsibility to do so.

109
0:05:02.185,000 --> 0:05:03,000
So what is a city?

110
0:05:03.95,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I think some might say that it is

111
0:05:06.156,000 --> 0:05:09,000
a geographical area or a collection of streets and buildings,

112
0:05:09.316,000 --> 0:05:11,000
but I believe that a city is the sum of the relationships

113
0:05:12.068,000 --> 0:05:13,000
of the people that live there,

114
0:05:13.629,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and I believe that if we can start to document those relationships in a real way

115
0:05:19.68,000 --> 0:05:2,000
then maybe we have a real shot

116
0:05:21.413,000 --> 0:05:23,000
at creating those kinds of cities that we'd like to have.

117
0:05:24.088,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Thank you.

118
0:05:25.445,000 --> 0:05:27,000
(Applause)

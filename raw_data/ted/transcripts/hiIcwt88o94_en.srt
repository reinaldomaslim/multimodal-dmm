1
0:00:12.56,000 --> 0:00:15,000
We are stealing nature from our children.

2
0:00:16.84,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Now, when I say this, I don't mean that we are destroying nature

3
0:00:19.92,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that they will have wanted us to preserve,

4
0:00:22.32,000 --> 0:00:24,000
although that is unfortunately also the case.

5
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:28,000
What I mean here is that we've started to define nature in a way

6
0:00:28.84,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that's so purist and so strict

7
0:00:31.88,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that under the definition we're creating for ourselves,

8
0:00:34.64,000 --> 0:00:36,000
there won't be any nature left for our children

9
0:00:37.04,000 --> 0:00:38,000
when they're adults.

10
0:00:39.12,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But there's a fix for this.

11
0:00:41.68,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So let me explain.

12
0:00:43.68,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Right now, humans use half of the world

13
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
to live, to grow their crops and their timber,

14
0:00:49.88,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to pasture their animals.

15
0:00:51.8,000 --> 0:00:52,000
If you added up all the human beings,

16
0:00:53.64,000 --> 0:00:57,000
we would weigh 10 times as much as all the wild mammals put together.

17
0:00:58.8,000 --> 0:01:,000
We cut roads through the forest.

18
0:01:01.68,000 --> 0:01:05,000
We have added little plastic particles to the sand on ocean beaches.

19
0:01:06.04,000 --> 0:01:11,000
We've changed the chemistry of the soil with our artificial fertilizers.

20
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And of course, we've changed the chemistry of the air.

21
0:01:14.4,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So when you take your next breath,

22
0:01:16.28,000 --> 0:01:19,000
you'll be breathing in 42 percent more carbon dioxide

23
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
than if you were breathing in 1750.

24
0:01:23.28,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So all of these changes, and many others,

25
0:01:25.76,000 --> 0:01:29,000
have come to be kind of lumped together under this rubric of the "Anthropocene."

26
0:01:30.48,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And this is a term that some geologists are suggesting

27
0:01:33.04,000 --> 0:01:34,000
we should give to our current epoch,

28
0:01:34.88,000 --> 0:01:36,000
given how pervasive human influence has been over it.

29
0:01:38.32,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, it's still just a proposed epoch, but I think it's a helpful way

30
0:01:42.2,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to think about the magnitude of human influence on the planet.

31
0:01:46.8,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So where does this put nature?

32
0:01:48.52,000 --> 0:01:51,000
What counts as nature in a world where everything is influenced by humans?

33
0:01:53.4,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So 25 years ago, environmental writer Bill McKibben said

34
0:01:57.6,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that because nature was a thing apart from man

35
0:02:02.12,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and because climate change meant

36
0:02:03.72,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that every centimeter of the Earth was altered by man,

37
0:02:07.36,000 --> 0:02:09,000
then nature was over.

38
0:02:09.48,000 --> 0:02:11,000
In fact, he called his book "The End of Nature."

39
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I disagree with this. I just disagree with this.

40
0:02:16.28,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I disagree with this definition of nature, because, fundamentally, we are animals.

41
0:02:20.639,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Right? Like, we evolved on this planet

42
0:02:23.48,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in the context of all the other animals with which we share a planet,

43
0:02:27.6,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and all the other plants, and all the other microbes.

44
0:02:30.2,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And so I think that nature

45
0:02:32.52,000 --> 0:02:36,000
is not that which is untouched by humanity, man or woman.

46
0:02:36.6,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I think that nature is anywhere where life thrives,

47
0:02:40.76,000 --> 0:02:43,000
anywhere where there are multiple species together,

48
0:02:43.8,000 --> 0:02:46,000
anywhere that's green and blue and thriving and filled with life

49
0:02:47.04,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and growing.

50
0:02:49.6,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And under that definition,

51
0:02:51.52,000 --> 0:02:53,000
things look a little bit different.

52
0:02:54.08,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now, I understand that there are certain parts of this nature

53
0:02:57.8,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that speak to us in a special way.

54
0:03:00.44,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Places like Yellowstone,

55
0:03:02.12,000 --> 0:03:03,000
or the Mongolian steppe,

56
0:03:03.84,000 --> 0:03:04,000
or the Great Barrier Reef

57
0:03:05.2,000 --> 0:03:06,000
or the Serengeti.

58
0:03:06.72,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Places that we think of as kind of Edenic representations

59
0:03:10.76,000 --> 0:03:12,000
of a nature before we screwed everything up.

60
0:03:14.56,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And in a way, they are less impacted by our day to day activities.

61
0:03:18.6,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Many of these places have no roads or few roads,

62
0:03:21.32,000 --> 0:03:22,000
so on, like such.

63
0:03:22.92,000 --> 0:03:27,000
But ultimately, even these Edens are deeply influenced by humans.

64
0:03:28.72,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Now, let's just take North America, for example,

65
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:32,000
since that's where we're meeting.

66
0:03:32.64,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So between about 15,000 years ago when people first came here,

67
0:03:36.08,000 --> 0:03:38,000
they started a process of interacting with the nature

68
0:03:38.6,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that led to the extinction of a big slew of large-bodied animals,

69
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:45,000
from the mastodon to the giant ground sloth,

70
0:03:45.28,000 --> 0:03:46,000
saber-toothed cats,

71
0:03:46.56,000 --> 0:03:49,000
all of these cool animals that unfortunately are no longer with us.

72
0:03:50.2,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And when those animals went extinct,

73
0:03:52.04,000 --> 0:03:54,000
you know, the ecosystems didn't stand still.

74
0:03:54.64,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Massive ripple effects changed grasslands into forests,

75
0:03:58.28,000 --> 0:04:,000
changed the composition of forest from one tree to another.

76
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So even in these Edens,

77
0:04:03.68,000 --> 0:04:04,000
even in these perfect-looking places

78
0:04:05.52,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that seem to remind us of a past before humans,

79
0:04:09.04,000 --> 0:04:12,000
we're essentially looking at a humanized landscape.

80
0:04:12.96,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Not just these prehistoric humans, but historical humans, indigenous people

81
0:04:16.56,000 --> 0:04:19,000
all the way up until the moment when the first colonizers showed up.

82
0:04:20.48,000 --> 0:04:22,000
And the case is the same for the other continents as well.

83
0:04:23.28,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Humans have just been involved in nature

84
0:04:26.12,000 --> 0:04:28,000
in a very influential way for a very long time.

85
0:04:30.44,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, just recently, someone told me,

86
0:04:32.24,000 --> 0:04:33,000
"Oh, but there are still wild places."

87
0:04:34.12,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And I said, "Where? Where? I want to go."

88
0:04:36.36,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And he said, "The Amazon."

89
0:04:38.28,000 --> 0:04:41,000
And I was like, "Oh, the Amazon. I was just there.

90
0:04:41.76,000 --> 0:04:44,000
It's awesome. National Geographic sent me to Manú National Park,

91
0:04:44.92,000 --> 0:04:45,000
which is in the Peruvian Amazon,

92
0:04:46.52,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but it's a big chunk of rainforest, uncleared, no roads,

93
0:04:50.2,000 --> 0:04:51,000
protected as a national park,

94
0:04:51.84,000 --> 0:04:53,000
one of the most, in fact, biodiverse parks in the world.

95
0:04:54.56,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And when I got in there with my canoe, what did I find, but people.

96
0:04:59.64,000 --> 0:05:02,000
People have been living there for hundreds and thousands of years.

97
0:05:03.48,000 --> 0:05:05,000
People live there, and they don't just float over the jungle.

98
0:05:06.36,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They have a meaningful relationship with the landscape.

99
0:05:09.48,000 --> 0:05:11,000
They hunt. They grow crops.

100
0:05:11.8,000 --> 0:05:12,000
They domesticate crops.

101
0:05:13.32,000 --> 0:05:15,000
They use the natural resources to build their houses,

102
0:05:16.24,000 --> 0:05:17,000
to thatch their houses.

103
0:05:17.52,000 --> 0:05:21,000
They even make pets out of animals that we consider to be wild animals.

104
0:05:21.56,000 --> 0:05:23,000
These people are there

105
0:05:23.68,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and they're interacting with the environment

106
0:05:25.8,000 --> 0:05:28,000
in a way that's really meaningful and that you can see in the environment.

107
0:05:29.32,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Now, I was with an anthropologist on this trip,

108
0:05:31.56,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and he told me, as we were floating down the river,

109
0:05:34.44,000 --> 0:05:38,000
he said, "There are no demographic voids in the Amazon."

110
0:05:39.12,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This statement has really stuck with me,

111
0:05:41.08,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because what it means is that the whole Amazon is like this.

112
0:05:43.96,000 --> 0:05:44,000
There's people everywhere.

113
0:05:45.88,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And many other tropical forests are the same,

114
0:05:48.24,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and not just tropical forests.

115
0:05:49.84,000 --> 0:05:52,000
People have influenced ecosystems in the past,

116
0:05:53.08,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and they continue to influence them in the present,

117
0:05:55.88,000 --> 0:05:58,000
even in places where they're harder to notice.

118
0:05:59.72,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So, if all of the definitions of nature that we might want to use

119
0:06:04.96,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that involve it being untouched by humanity

120
0:06:07.96,000 --> 0:06:08,000
or not having people in it,

121
0:06:09.32,000 --> 0:06:14,000
if all of those actually give us a result where we don't have any nature,

122
0:06:14.68,000 --> 0:06:16,000
then maybe they're the wrong definitions.

123
0:06:17.12,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Maybe we should define it by the presence of multiple species,

124
0:06:20.64,000 --> 0:06:22,000
by the presence of a thriving life.

125
0:06:23.44,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Now, if we do it that way,

126
0:06:25.48,000 --> 0:06:26,000
what do we get?

127
0:06:26.96,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Well, it's this kind of miracle.

128
0:06:29.36,000 --> 0:06:31,000
All of a sudden, there's nature all around us.

129
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
All of a sudden, we see this Monarch caterpillar

130
0:06:34.88,000 --> 0:06:35,000
munching on this plant,

131
0:06:36.76,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and we realize that there it is,

132
0:06:38.6,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and it's in this empty lot in Chattanooga.

133
0:06:42.32,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And look at this empty lot.

134
0:06:43.68,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I mean, there's, like, probably,

135
0:06:45.48,000 --> 0:06:47,000
a dozen, minimum, plant species growing there,

136
0:06:48.44,000 --> 0:06:5,000
supporting all kinds of insect life,

137
0:06:50.72,000 --> 0:06:54,000
and this is a completely unmanaged space, a completely wild space.

138
0:06:55.08,000 --> 0:06:57,000
This is a kind of wild nature right under our nose,

139
0:06:58.08,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that we don't even notice.

140
0:07:00.76,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And there's an interesting little paradox, too.

141
0:07:03,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So this nature,

142
0:07:04.84,000 --> 0:07:06,000
this kind of wild, untended part

143
0:07:07.52,000 --> 0:07:1,000
of our urban, peri-urban, suburban agricultural existence

144
0:07:11.32,000 --> 0:07:13,000
that flies under the radar,

145
0:07:13.72,000 --> 0:07:16,000
it's arguably more wild than a national park,

146
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
because national parks are very carefully managed

147
0:07:20.6,000 --> 0:07:21,000
in the 21st century.

148
0:07:22.36,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Crater Lake in southern Oregon, which is my closest national park,

149
0:07:25.96,000 --> 0:07:3,000
is a beautiful example of a landscape that seems to be coming out of the past.

150
0:07:31.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But they're managing it carefully.

151
0:07:32.92,000 --> 0:07:35,000
One of the issues they have now is white bark pine die-off.

152
0:07:36.52,000 --> 0:07:38,000
White bark pine is a beautiful, charismatic --

153
0:07:39.04,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I'll say it's a charismatic megaflora

154
0:07:42.08,000 --> 0:07:43,000
that grows up at high altitude --

155
0:07:43.76,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and it's got all these problems right now with disease.

156
0:07:46.76,000 --> 0:07:48,000
There's a blister rust that was introduced,

157
0:07:48.92,000 --> 0:07:49,000
bark beetle.

158
0:07:50.44,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So to deal with this, the park service has been planting

159
0:07:54.04,000 --> 0:07:57,000
rust-resistant white bark pine seedlings in the park,

160
0:07:58.56,000 --> 0:08:01,000
even in areas that they are otherwise managing as wilderness.

161
0:08:02.2,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And they're also putting out beetle repellent in key areas

162
0:08:05.04,000 --> 0:08:06,000
as I saw last time I went hiking there.

163
0:08:07.64,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And this kind of thing is really much more common than you would think.

164
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:12,000
National parks are heavily managed.

165
0:08:12.72,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The wildlife is kept to a certain population size and structure.

166
0:08:15.8,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Fires are suppressed.

167
0:08:17.36,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Fires are started.

168
0:08:18.68,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Non-native species are removed.

169
0:08:20.88,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Native species are reintroduced.

170
0:08:22.6,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And in fact, I took a look,

171
0:08:23.96,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and Banff National Park is doing all of the things I just listed:

172
0:08:27.04,000 --> 0:08:28,000
suppressing fire, having fire,

173
0:08:28.52,000 --> 0:08:3,000
radio-collaring wolves, reintroducing bison.

174
0:08:30.76,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It takes a lot of work to make these places look untouched.

175
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:37.08,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Applause)

177
0:08:43.08,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And in a further irony, these places that we love the most

178
0:08:47.559,000 --> 0:08:49,000
are the places that we love a little too hard, sometimes.

179
0:08:50.28,000 --> 0:08:51,000
A lot of us like to go there,

180
0:08:51.72,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and because we're managing them to be stable

181
0:08:54.28,000 --> 0:08:56,000
in the face of a changing planet,

182
0:08:56.36,000 --> 0:08:58,000
they often are becoming more fragile over time.

183
0:08:59.44,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Which means that they're the absolute worst places

184
0:09:01.92,000 --> 0:09:02,000
to take your children on vacation,

185
0:09:03.88,000 --> 0:09:04,000
because you can't do anything there.

186
0:09:05.8,000 --> 0:09:06,000
You can't climb the trees.

187
0:09:07.12,000 --> 0:09:08,000
You can't fish the fish.

188
0:09:08.36,000 --> 0:09:1,000
You can't make a campfire out in the middle of nowhere.

189
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:12,000
You can't take home the pinecones.

190
0:09:12.68,000 --> 0:09:13,000
There are so many rules and restrictions

191
0:09:14.609,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that from a child's point of view,

192
0:09:16.6,000 --> 0:09:17,000
this is, like, the worst nature ever.

193
0:09:19.32,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Because children don't want to hike

194
0:09:21.96,000 --> 0:09:23,000
through a beautiful landscape for five hours

195
0:09:24.32,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and then look at a beautiful view.

196
0:09:26.2,000 --> 0:09:28,000
That's maybe what we want to do as adults,

197
0:09:28.224,000 --> 0:09:3,000
but what kids want to do is hunker down in one spot

198
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and just tinker with it, just work with it,

199
0:09:33.4,000 --> 0:09:36,000
just pick it up, build a house, build a fort, do something like that.

200
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Additionally, these sort of Edenic places

201
0:09:40.72,000 --> 0:09:43,000
are often distant from where people live.

202
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
And they're expensive to get to. They're hard to visit.

203
0:09:46.96,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So this means that they're only available to the elites,

204
0:09:49.76,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and that's a real problem.

205
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
The Nature Conservancy did a survey of young people,

206
0:09:56.4,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and they asked them, how often do you spend time outdoors?

207
0:10:00.12,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And only two out of five spent time outdoors

208
0:10:02.68,000 --> 0:10:03,000
at least once a week.

209
0:10:03.92,000 --> 0:10:06,000
The other three out of five were just staying inside.

210
0:10:06.96,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And when they asked them why, what are the barriers to going outside,

211
0:10:11.08,000 --> 0:10:13,000
the response of 61 percent was,

212
0:10:14.08,000 --> 0:10:17,000
"There are no natural areas near my home."

213
0:10:18.2,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And this is crazy. This is just patently false.

214
0:10:21.92,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I mean, 71 percent of people in the US

215
0:10:24.92,000 --> 0:10:26,000
live within a 10-minute walk of a city park.

216
0:10:27.72,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And I'm sure the figures are similar in other countries.

217
0:10:30.4,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And that doesn't even count your back garden,

218
0:10:32.56,000 --> 0:10:33,000
the urban creek, the empty lot.

219
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Everybody lives near nature.

220
0:10:37.08,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Every kid lives near nature.

221
0:10:39.76,000 --> 0:10:41,000
We've just somehow forgotten how to see it.

222
0:10:41.84,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We've spent too much time watching David Attenborough documentaries

223
0:10:45.04,000 --> 0:10:46,000
where the nature is really sexy --

224
0:10:46.72,000 --> 0:10:47,000
(Laughter)

225
0:10:47.76,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and we've forgotten how to see the nature that is literally right outside our door,

226
0:10:51.72,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the nature of the street tree.

227
0:10:53.68,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So here's an example: Philadelphia.

228
0:10:56.48,000 --> 0:10:58,000
There's this cool elevated railway

229
0:10:58.88,000 --> 0:11:,000
that you can see from the ground, that's been abandoned.

230
0:11:01.32,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Now, this may sound like the beginning of the High Line story in Manhattan,

231
0:11:04.76,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and it's very similar, except they haven't developed this into a park yet,

232
0:11:08.08,000 --> 0:11:09,000
although they're working on it.

233
0:11:09.64,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So for now, it's still this little sort of secret wilderness

234
0:11:12.84,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in the heart of Philadelphia,

235
0:11:14.28,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and if you know where the hole is in the chain-link fence,

236
0:11:17.4,000 --> 0:11:19,000
you can scramble up to the top

237
0:11:19.48,000 --> 0:11:21,000
and you can find this completely wild meadow

238
0:11:22.32,000 --> 0:11:24,000
just floating above the city of Philadelphia.

239
0:11:25.2,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Every single one of these plants grew from a seed

240
0:11:27.56,000 --> 0:11:28,000
that planted itself there.

241
0:11:28.92,000 --> 0:11:3,000
This is completely autonomous, self-willed nature.

242
0:11:31.88,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And it's right in the middle of the city.

243
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And they've sent people up there to do sort of biosurveys,

244
0:11:37.4,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and there are over 50 plant species up there.

245
0:11:40.56,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And it's not just plants.

246
0:11:41.84,000 --> 0:11:44,000
This is an ecosystem, a functioning ecosystem.

247
0:11:45.36,000 --> 0:11:47,000
It's creating soil. It's sequestering carbon.

248
0:11:47.84,000 --> 0:11:48,000
There's pollination going on.

249
0:11:49.76,000 --> 0:11:5,000
I mean, this is really an ecosystem.

250
0:11:53.4,000 --> 0:11:56,000
So scientists have started calling ecosystems like these "novel ecosystems,"

251
0:11:57.28,000 --> 0:11:59,000
because they're often dominated by non-native species,

252
0:11:59.88,000 --> 0:12:,000
and because they're just super weird.

253
0:12:01.64,000 --> 0:12:03,000
They're just unlike anything we've ever seen before.

254
0:12:04.12,000 --> 0:12:08,000
For so long, we dismissed all these novel ecosystems as trash.

255
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
We're talking about regrown agricultural fields,

256
0:12:10.6,000 --> 0:12:13,000
timber plantations that are not being managed on a day-to-day basis,

257
0:12:14.2,000 --> 0:12:16,000
second-growth forests generally, the entire East Coast,

258
0:12:16.88,000 --> 0:12:2,000
where after agriculture moved west, the forest sprung up.

259
0:12:21.04,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And of course, pretty much all of Hawaii,

260
0:12:23.68,000 --> 0:12:25,000
where novel ecosystems are the norm,

261
0:12:26.52,000 --> 0:12:28,000
where exotic species totally dominate.

262
0:12:29.12,000 --> 0:12:31,000
This forest here has Queensland maple,

263
0:12:31.56,000 --> 0:12:33,000
it has sword ferns from Southeast Asia.

264
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
You can make your own novel ecosystem, too.

265
0:12:37.24,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It's really simple.

266
0:12:38.48,000 --> 0:12:39,000
You just stop mowing your lawn.

267
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

268
0:12:41.6,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Ilkka Hanski was an ecologist in Finland, and he did this experiment himself.

269
0:12:45.32,000 --> 0:12:46,000
He just stopped mowing his lawn,

270
0:12:46.92,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and after a few years, he had some grad students come,

271
0:12:49.48,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and they did sort of a bio-blitz of his backyard,

272
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and they found 375 plant species,

273
0:12:56.28,000 --> 0:12:58,000
including two endangered species.

274
0:12:59.56,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So when you're up there on that future High Line of Philadelphia,

275
0:13:06.04,000 --> 0:13:07,000
surrounded by this wildness,

276
0:13:07.88,000 --> 0:13:1,000
surrounded by this diversity, this abundance, this vibrance,

277
0:13:11.68,000 --> 0:13:12,000
you can look over the side

278
0:13:12.96,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and you can see a local playground for a local school,

279
0:13:16.24,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and that's what it looks like.

280
0:13:18.2,000 --> 0:13:2,000
These children have, that --

281
0:13:20.24,000 --> 0:13:21,000
You know, under my definition,

282
0:13:21.72,000 --> 0:13:23,000
there's a lot of the planet that counts as nature,

283
0:13:24.12,000 --> 0:13:27,000
but this would be one of the few places that wouldn't count as nature.

284
0:13:27.48,000 --> 0:13:3,000
There's nothing there except humans, no other plants, no other animals.

285
0:13:30.88,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And what I really wanted to do

286
0:13:32.36,000 --> 0:13:34,000
was just, like, throw a ladder over the side

287
0:13:34.48,000 --> 0:13:37,000
and get all these kids to come up with me into this cool meadow.

288
0:13:38.04,000 --> 0:13:41,000
In a way, I feel like this is the choice that faces us.

289
0:13:41.36,000 --> 0:13:45,000
If we dismiss these new natures as not acceptable or trashy or no good,

290
0:13:47.04,000 --> 0:13:49,000
we might as well just pave them over.

291
0:13:49.64,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And in a world where everything is changing,

292
0:13:52.2,000 --> 0:13:54,000
we need to be very careful about how we define nature.

293
0:13:55.8,000 --> 0:13:57,000
In order not to steal it from our children,

294
0:13:57.88,000 --> 0:13:58,000
we have to do two things.

295
0:13:59.84,000 --> 0:14:02,000
First, we cannot define nature as that which is untouched.

296
0:14:04.36,000 --> 0:14:05,000
This never made any sense anyway.

297
0:14:05.96,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Nature has not been untouched for thousands of years.

298
0:14:08.48,000 --> 0:14:11,000
And it excludes most of the nature that most people can visit

299
0:14:12.32,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and have a relationship with,

300
0:14:14.32,000 --> 0:14:17,000
including only nature that children cannot touch.

301
0:14:18.36,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Which brings me to the second thing that we have to do,

302
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:23,000
which is that we have to let children touch nature,

303
0:14:23.52,000 --> 0:14:25,000
because that which is untouched is unloved.

304
0:14:26.04,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Applause)

305
0:14:35.4,000 --> 0:14:38,000
We face some pretty grim environmental challenges on this planet.

306
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Climate change is among them.

307
0:14:40.72,000 --> 0:14:42,000
There's others too: habitat loss is my favorite thing

308
0:14:43.24,000 --> 0:14:45,000
to freak out about in the middle of the night.

309
0:14:45.96,000 --> 0:14:46,000
But in order to solve them,

310
0:14:47.32,000 --> 0:14:49,000
we need people -- smart, dedicated people --

311
0:14:50.08,000 --> 0:14:51,000
who care about nature.

312
0:14:51.88,000 --> 0:14:53,000
And the only way we're going to raise up a generation of people

313
0:14:54.88,000 --> 0:14:55,000
who care about nature

314
0:14:56.12,000 --> 0:14:58,000
is by letting them touch nature.

315
0:14:58.32,000 --> 0:15:,000
I have a Fort Theory of Ecology,

316
0:15:00.64,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Fort Theory of Conservation.

317
0:15:02.56,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Every ecologist I know, every conservation biologist I know,

318
0:15:05.8,000 --> 0:15:06,000
every conservation professional I know,

319
0:15:07.72,000 --> 0:15:09,000
built forts when they were kids.

320
0:15:10.84,000 --> 0:15:12,000
If we have a generation that doesn't know how to build a fort,

321
0:15:13.8,000 --> 0:15:16,000
we'll have a generation that doesn't know how to care about nature.

322
0:15:17,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And I don't want to be the one to tell this kid,

323
0:15:19.28,000 --> 0:15:2,000
who is on a special program

324
0:15:20.64,000 --> 0:15:22,000
that takes Philadelphia kids from poor neighborhoods

325
0:15:23.12,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and takes them to city parks,

326
0:15:24.56,000 --> 0:15:27,000
I don't want to be the one to tell him that the flower he's holding

327
0:15:27.76,000 --> 0:15:3,000
is a non-native invasive weed that he should throw away as trash.

328
0:15:31.76,000 --> 0:15:34,000
I think I would much rather learn from this boy

329
0:15:34.96,000 --> 0:15:36,000
that no matter where this plant comes from,

330
0:15:37.64,000 --> 0:15:41,000
it is beautiful, and it deserves to be touched and appreciated.

331
0:15:41.84,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Thank you.

332
0:15:43.08,000 --> 0:15:51,000
(Applause)

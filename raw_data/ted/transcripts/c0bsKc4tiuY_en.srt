1
0:00:13.72,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hello.

2
0:00:15.12,000 --> 0:00:16,000
My name is Simone.

3
0:00:17.28,000 --> 0:00:2,000
You know how people tell you if you get nervous when onstage,

4
0:00:20.6,000 --> 0:00:22,000
picture people in the audience naked?

5
0:00:23.12,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Like it's this thing that's supposed to make you feel better.

6
0:00:26.52,000 --> 0:00:27,000
But I was thinking --

7
0:00:27.8,000 --> 0:00:32,000
picturing all of you naked in 2018 feels kind of weird and wrong.

8
0:00:33.24,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Like, we're working really hard on moving past stuff like that,

9
0:00:36.28,000 --> 0:00:38,000
so we need a new method of dealing with

10
0:00:38.92,000 --> 0:00:4,000
if you get nervous onstage.

11
0:00:41.08,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And I realized that what I'd really like

12
0:00:43.24,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is that I can look at you as much as you're looking at me --

13
0:00:47.32,000 --> 0:00:49,000
just to even things out a little bit.

14
0:00:49.76,000 --> 0:00:51,000
So if I had way more eyeballs,

15
0:00:52.52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
then we'd all be really comfortable, right?

16
0:00:55.32,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So in preparation for this talk, I made myself a shirt.

17
0:00:59.23,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Rattling)

18
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:06,000
(Laughter)

19
0:01:09.8,000 --> 0:01:11,000
It's googly eyes.

20
0:01:12.8,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It took me 14 hours

21
0:01:14.92,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and 227 googly eyes to make this shirt.

22
0:01:18.64,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And being able to look at you as much as you're looking at me

23
0:01:21.72,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is actually only half of the reason I made this.

24
0:01:24.24,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The other half is being able to do this.

25
0:01:26.2,000 --> 0:01:27,000
(Googly eyes rattle)

26
0:01:27.56,000 --> 0:01:28,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:28.84,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So I do a lot of things like this.

28
0:01:30.6,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I see a problem and I invent some sort of solution to it.

29
0:01:34.44,000 --> 0:01:35,000
For example, brushing your teeth.

30
0:01:36.28,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Like, it's this thing we all have to do, it's kind of boring,

31
0:01:39.24,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and nobody really likes it.

32
0:01:41.36,000 --> 0:01:43,000
If there were any seven-year-olds in the audience,

33
0:01:43.76,000 --> 0:01:45,000
they'd be like, "Yes!"

34
0:01:46.28,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So what about if you had a machine that could do it for you?

35
0:01:54.8,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Laughter)

36
0:01:58.72,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I call it ...

37
0:02:02.36,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I call it "The Toothbrush Helmet."

38
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:09.48,000 --> 0:02:11,000
(Robot arm buzzing)

40
0:02:12.24,000 --> 0:02:15,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:15.48,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Applause)

42
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So my toothbrush helmet is recommended by zero out of 10 dentists,

43
0:02:23.56,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and it definitely did not revolutionize the world of dentistry,

44
0:02:27.76,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but it did completely change my life.

45
0:02:30.96,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Because I finished making this toothbrush helmet three years ago

46
0:02:34.44,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and after I finished making it,

47
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I went into my living room and I put up a camera,

48
0:02:38.68,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and I filmed a seven-second clip of it working.

49
0:02:41.76,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And by now,

50
0:02:43,000 --> 0:02:45,000
this is a pretty standard modern-day fairy tale

51
0:02:45.92,000 --> 0:02:47,000
of girl posting on the internet,

52
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the internet takes the girl by storm,

53
0:02:50.76,000 --> 0:02:52,000
thousands of men voyage into the comment sections

54
0:02:53.6,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to ask for her hand in marriage --

55
0:02:55.32,000 --> 0:02:56,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:56.36,000 --> 0:02:58,000
She ignores all of them, starts a YouTube channel

57
0:02:58.72,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and keeps on building robots.

58
0:03:01.12,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Since then, I've carved out this little niche for myself on the internet

59
0:03:05.08,000 --> 0:03:07,000
as an inventor of useless machines,

60
0:03:07.6,000 --> 0:03:08,000
because as we all know,

61
0:03:09.28,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the easiest way to be at the top of your field

62
0:03:12.96,000 --> 0:03:14,000
is to choose a very small field.

63
0:03:15.08,000 --> 0:03:17,000
(Laughter)

64
0:03:17.32,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Applause)

65
0:03:21.68,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So I run a YouTube channel about my machines,

66
0:03:24.88,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and I've done things like cutting hair with drones --

67
0:03:27.68,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Drone buzzes)

68
0:03:29.4,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:31.8,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Drone crashes)

70
0:03:32.88,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:34.32,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Drone buzzes)

72
0:03:35.44,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Laughter)

73
0:03:37.36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Applause)

74
0:03:39.48,000 --> 0:03:41,000
To a machine that helps me wake up in the morning --

75
0:03:42.24,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Alarm)

76
0:03:44.2,000 --> 0:03:46,000
(Laughter)

77
0:03:49.2,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Video) Simone: Ow!

78
0:03:50.96,000 --> 0:03:52,000
To this machine that helps me chop vegetables.

79
0:03:53.56,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Knives chop)

80
0:03:57.2,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I'm not an engineer.

81
0:03:58.48,000 --> 0:04:,000
I did not study engineering in school.

82
0:04:00.84,000 --> 0:04:03,000
But I was a super ambitious student growing up.

83
0:04:04.44,000 --> 0:04:06,000
In middle school and high school, I had straight A's,

84
0:04:06.96,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and I graduated at the top of my year.

85
0:04:09.2,000 --> 0:04:1,000
On the flip side of that,

86
0:04:10.48,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I struggled with very severe performance anxiety.

87
0:04:14.2,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Here's an email I sent to my brother around that time.

88
0:04:17.24,000 --> 0:04:19,000
"You won't understand how difficult it is for me to tell you,

89
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to confess this.

90
0:04:21.4,000 --> 0:04:22,000
I'm so freaking embarrassed.

91
0:04:22.8,000 --> 0:04:24,000
I don't want people to think that I'm stupid.

92
0:04:25.04,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now I'm starting to cry too.

93
0:04:26.64,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Damn."

94
0:04:28.12,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And no, I did not accidentally burn our parents' house down.

95
0:04:31.68,000 --> 0:04:35,000
The thing I'm writing about in the email and the thing I'm so upset about

96
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
is that I got a B on a math test.

97
0:04:39.48,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So something obviously happened between here and here.

98
0:04:43.6,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

99
0:04:48.04,000 --> 0:04:5,000
One of those things was puberty.

100
0:04:50.24,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:51.64,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Beautiful time indeed.

102
0:04:53.04,000 --> 0:04:54,000
But moreover,

103
0:04:54.4,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I got interested in building robots,

104
0:04:56.56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and I wanted to teach myself about hardware.

105
0:04:59.84,000 --> 0:05:02,000
But building things with hardware, especially if you're teaching yourself,

106
0:05:03.36,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is something that's really difficult to do.

107
0:05:05.76,000 --> 0:05:06,000
It has a high likelihood of failure

108
0:05:07.68,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and moreover,

109
0:05:08.92,000 --> 0:05:1,000
it has a high likelihood of making you feel stupid.

110
0:05:11.72,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And that was my biggest fear at the time.

111
0:05:14.64,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So I came up with a setup that would guarantee success 100 percent of the time.

112
0:05:20.92,000 --> 0:05:23,000
With my setup, it would be nearly impossible to fail.

113
0:05:24.32,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And that was that instead of trying to succeed,

114
0:05:27.32,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I was going to try to build things that would fail.

115
0:05:31.36,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And even though I didn't realize it at the time,

116
0:05:33.64,000 --> 0:05:36,000
building stupid things was actually quite smart,

117
0:05:37.6,000 --> 0:05:39,000
because as I kept on learning about hardware,

118
0:05:40.28,000 --> 0:05:41,000
for the first time in my life,

119
0:05:41.76,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I did not have to deal with my performance anxiety.

120
0:05:44.88,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And as soon as I removed all pressure and expectations from myself,

121
0:05:48.6,000 --> 0:05:51,000
that pressure quickly got replaced by enthusiasm,

122
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and it allowed me to just play.

123
0:05:54.88,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So as an inventor,

124
0:05:56.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I'm interested in things that people struggle with.

125
0:05:58.6,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It can be small things or big things or medium-sized things

126
0:06:02.2,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and something like giving a TED talk presents this whole new set of problems

127
0:06:06.76,000 --> 0:06:07,000
that I can solve.

128
0:06:08.28,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And identifying a problem is the first step in my process

129
0:06:11.4,000 --> 0:06:12,000
of building a useless machine.

130
0:06:13.52,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So before I came here,

131
0:06:15.08,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I sat down and I thought of some of the potential problems I might have

132
0:06:18.68,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in giving this talk.

133
0:06:20.72,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Forgetting what to say.

134
0:06:23.48,000 --> 0:06:24,000
That people won't laugh --

135
0:06:24.8,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that's you.

136
0:06:27.08,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Or even worse,

137
0:06:28.32,000 --> 0:06:29,000
that you'll laugh at the wrong things --

138
0:06:31.48,000 --> 0:06:32,000
that was an OK part to laugh at,

139
0:06:33.08,000 --> 0:06:34,000
thank you.

140
0:06:34.32,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:35.36,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Or that when I get nervous, my hands start shaking

142
0:06:37.76,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and I'm really self-conscious about it.

143
0:06:39.84,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Or that my fly has been open this entire time

144
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and all of you noticed but I didn't,

145
0:06:45.08,000 --> 0:06:48,000
but it's closed so we're all good on that one.

146
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But one thing I'm actually really nervous about is my hands shaking.

147
0:06:51.64,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I remember when I was a kid,

148
0:06:53.84,000 --> 0:06:54,000
giving presentations in school,

149
0:06:55.56,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I would have my notes on a piece of paper,

150
0:06:57.68,000 --> 0:07:,000
and I would put a notebook behind the paper

151
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
so that people wouldn't be able to see the paper quivering.

152
0:07:04.44,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And I give a lot of talks.

153
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I know that about half of you in the audience are probably like,

154
0:07:11.08,000 --> 0:07:12,000
"Building useless machines is really fun,

155
0:07:13.08,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but how is this in any way or form a business?"

156
0:07:15.76,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And giving talks is a part of it.

157
0:07:17.72,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And the arrangers always put out a glass of water for you onstage

158
0:07:20.8,000 --> 0:07:22,000
so you have something to drink if you get thirsty,

159
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and I always so badly want to drink that water,

160
0:07:27.08,000 --> 0:07:28,000
but I don't dare to pick the glass up

161
0:07:28.96,000 --> 0:07:31,000
because then people might be able to see that my hands are shaking.

162
0:07:32.28,000 --> 0:07:36,000
So what about a machine that hands you a glass of water?

163
0:07:36.4,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Sold to the nervous girl in the googly-eye shirt.

164
0:07:39.6,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Actually, I need to take this off because I have a thing --

165
0:07:43.44,000 --> 0:07:45,000
(Googly eyes rattle)

166
0:07:51.4,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Oh.

167
0:07:52.84,000 --> 0:07:53,000
(Clanking)

168
0:07:54.36,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:05.48,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I still don't know what to call this,

170
0:08:08.48,000 --> 0:08:11,000
but I think some sort of "head orbit device,"

171
0:08:12.04,000 --> 0:08:15,000
because it rotates this platform around you

172
0:08:15.08,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and you can put anything on it.

173
0:08:16.6,000 --> 0:08:19,000
You can have a camera; you can get photos of your entire head.

174
0:08:20.44,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Like it's really -- it's a very versatile machine.

175
0:08:24.36,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Laughter)

176
0:08:26.08,000 --> 0:08:27,000
OK, and I have --

177
0:08:28,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I mean, you can put some snacks on it, for example,

178
0:08:30.44,000 --> 0:08:31,000
if you want to.

179
0:08:31.72,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I have some popcorn here.

180
0:08:33.56,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And you just put a little bit like that.

181
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And then you want to --

182
0:08:40.56,000 --> 0:08:42,000
there's some sacrifices for science --

183
0:08:43.4,000 --> 0:08:46,000
just some popcorn falling on the floor.

184
0:08:46.48,000 --> 0:08:47,000
Let's do the long way around.

185
0:08:47.919,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Robot buzzes)

186
0:08:49.64,000 --> 0:08:5,000
(Laughter)

187
0:08:51.44,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And then you have a little hand.

188
0:08:53.039,000 --> 0:08:54,000
You need to adjust the height of it,

189
0:08:54.88,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and you just do it by shrugging.

190
0:08:56.48,000 --> 0:08:57,000
(Laughter)

191
0:08:58.4,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Applause)

192
0:08:59.64,000 --> 0:09:,000
It has a little hand.

193
0:09:00.92,000 --> 0:09:01,000
(Hand thwacks)

194
0:09:02.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

195
0:09:03.4,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Applause)

196
0:09:11.48,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I just bumped my mic off,

197
0:09:14.2,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but I think we're all good.

198
0:09:17.24,000 --> 0:09:19,000
OK, also I need to chew this popcorn,

199
0:09:19.68,000 --> 0:09:21,000
so if you guys could just clap your hands a little bit more --

200
0:09:22.64,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Applause)

201
0:09:26.76,000 --> 0:09:28,000
OK, so it's like your own little personal solar system,

202
0:09:29.6,000 --> 0:09:3,000
because I'm a millennial,

203
0:09:31.52,000 --> 0:09:33,000
so I want everything to revolve around me.

204
0:09:34,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

205
0:09:37.08,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Back to the glass of water, that's what we're here for.

206
0:09:39.72,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So, I promise -- I mean, it still has --

207
0:09:41.8,000 --> 0:09:42,000
it doesn't have any water in it,

208
0:09:43.4,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

209
0:09:44.92,000 --> 0:09:48,000
But I still need to work on this machine a little bit

210
0:09:49.52,000 --> 0:09:52,000
because I still need to pick up the glass and put it on the platform,

211
0:09:52.8,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but if your hands are shaking a little bit,

212
0:09:54.84,000 --> 0:09:55,000
nobody's going to notice

213
0:09:56.12,000 --> 0:09:58,000
because you're wearing a very mesmerizing piece of equipment.

214
0:09:59.04,000 --> 0:10:,000
So, we're all good.

215
0:10:00.48,000 --> 0:10:01,000
OK.

216
0:10:02.146,000 --> 0:10:03,000
(Robot buzzes)

217
0:10:03.32,000 --> 0:10:04,000
(Singing)

218
0:10:05.8,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Oh no, it got stuck.

219
0:10:08.32,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Isn't it comforting that even robots sometimes get stage fright?

220
0:10:12.2,000 --> 0:10:13,000
It just gets stuck a little bit.

221
0:10:15.48,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It's very human of them.

222
0:10:17.88,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Oh wait, let's go back a little bit,

223
0:10:20.52,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and then --

224
0:10:21.76,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Glass falls)

225
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Laughter)

226
0:10:25.2,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Isn't it a beautiful time to be alive?

227
0:10:27.68,000 --> 0:10:29,000
(Laughter)

228
0:10:29.96,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Applause)

229
0:10:36.68,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So as much as my machines can seem like simple engineering slapstick,

230
0:10:41.32,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I realize that I stumbled on something bigger than that.

231
0:10:44.76,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It's this expression of joy and humility that often gets lost in engineering,

232
0:10:49.68,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and for me it was a way to learn about hardware

233
0:10:52.24,000 --> 0:10:54,000
without having my performance anxiety get in the way.

234
0:10:56.04,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I often get asked if I think I'm ever going to build something useful,

235
0:10:59.68,000 --> 0:11:,000
and maybe someday I will.

236
0:11:02.44,000 --> 0:11:03,000
But the way I see it,

237
0:11:03.76,000 --> 0:11:04,000
I already have

238
0:11:05.08,000 --> 0:11:07,000
because I've built myself this job

239
0:11:08.32,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and it's something that I could never have planned for,

240
0:11:11.2,000 --> 0:11:12,000
or that I could --

241
0:11:12.44,000 --> 0:11:16,000
(Applause)

242
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:2,000
It's something that I could never have planned for.

243
0:11:20.44,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Instead it happened just because I was enthusiastic about what I was doing,

244
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and I was sharing that enthusiasm with other people.

245
0:11:26.76,000 --> 0:11:29,000
To me that's the true beauty of making useless things,

246
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because it's this acknowledgment

247
0:11:32.2,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that you don't always know what the best answer is.

248
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And it turns off that voice in your head

249
0:11:37.52,000 --> 0:11:4,000
that tells you that you know exactly how the world works.

250
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And maybe a toothbrush helmet isn't the answer,

251
0:11:43.36,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but at least you're asking the question.

252
0:11:45.32,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Thank you.

253
0:11:46.56,000 --> 0:11:5,000
(Applause)

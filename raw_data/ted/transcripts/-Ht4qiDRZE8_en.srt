1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
How many of you had to fill out a web form

2
0:00:17.284,000 --> 0:00:18,000
where you've been asked to read

3
0:00:18.82,000 --> 0:00:2,000
a distorted sequence of characters like this?

4
0:00:20.98,000 --> 0:00:21,000
How many of you found it really annoying?

5
0:00:22.957,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:24.08,000 --> 0:00:25,000
OK, outstanding. So I invented that.

7
0:00:25.84,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:27.7,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Or I was one of the people who did it.

9
0:00:29.58,000 --> 0:00:3,000
That thing is called a CAPTCHA.

10
0:00:31.14,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And it is there to make sure you, the entity filling out the form,

11
0:00:34.3,000 --> 0:00:35,000
are a human and not a computer program

12
0:00:36.18,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that was written to submit the form millions of times.

13
0:00:38.78,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The reason it works is because humans, at least non-visually-impaired humans,

14
0:00:42.46,000 --> 0:00:44,000
have no trouble reading these distorted characters,

15
0:00:44.9,000 --> 0:00:45,000
whereas programs can't do it as well yet.

16
0:00:46.9,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In the case of Ticketmaster,

17
0:00:48.42,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the reason you have to type these characters

18
0:00:50.54,000 --> 0:00:52,000
is to prevent scalpers from writing a program

19
0:00:52.7,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that can buy millions of tickets, two at a time.

20
0:00:54.98,000 --> 0:00:55,000
CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet.

21
0:00:56.94,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And since they're used so often,

22
0:00:58.54,000 --> 0:01:01,000
a lot of times the sequence of random characters shown to the user

23
0:01:01.7,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is not so fortunate.

24
0:01:02.94,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page.

25
0:01:05.62,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The random characters that happened to be shown to the user

26
0:01:08.46,000 --> 0:01:1,000
were W, A, I, T, which, of course, spell a word.

27
0:01:11.18,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But the best part is the message

28
0:01:13.3,000 --> 0:01:15,000
that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later.

29
0:01:15.78,000 --> 0:01:18,000
[Help! I've been waiting for over 20 minutes and nothing happens.]

30
0:01:18.94,000 --> 0:01:22,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:23.82,000 --> 0:01:24,000
This person thought they needed to wait.

32
0:01:25.749,000 --> 0:01:27,000
This, of course, is not as bad as this poor person.

33
0:01:28.18,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:30.58,000 --> 0:01:33,000
CAPTCHA Project is something that we did at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago,

35
0:01:34.34,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and it's been used everywhere.

36
0:01:35.82,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later,

37
0:01:38.98,000 --> 0:01:4,000
which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA.

38
0:01:41.22,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA,

39
0:01:43.22,000 --> 0:01:45,000
which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon,

40
0:01:46.02,000 --> 0:01:48,000
then we turned it into a start-up company.

41
0:01:48.052,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And then about a year and a half ago, Google actually acquired this company.

42
0:01:51.664,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Let me tell you what this project started.

43
0:01:53.695,000 --> 0:01:55,000
This project started from the following realization:

44
0:01:56.25,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs

45
0:01:58.711,000 --> 0:02:,000
are typed everyday by people around the world.

46
0:02:00.886,000 --> 0:02:02,000
When I first heard this, I was quite proud of myself.

47
0:02:03.394,000 --> 0:02:05,000
I thought, look at the impact my research has had.

48
0:02:05.759,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But then I started feeling bad.

49
0:02:07.267,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Here's the thing: each time you type a CAPTCHA,

50
0:02:09.497,000 --> 0:02:11,000
essentially, you waste 10 seconds of your time.

51
0:02:11.86,000 --> 0:02:12,000
And if you multiply that by 200 million,

52
0:02:13.82,000 --> 0:02:16,000
you get that humanity is wasting about 500,000 hours every day

53
0:02:16.86,000 --> 0:02:17,000
typing these annoying CAPTCHAs.

54
0:02:18.42,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:19.46,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So then I started feeling bad.

56
0:02:20.913,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:22.74,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And then I started thinking, of course, we can't just get rid of CAPTCHAs,

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
because the security of the web depends on them.

59
0:02:28.54,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But then I started thinking, can we use this effort

60
0:02:30.98,000 --> 0:02:31,000
for something that is good for humanity?

61
0:02:32.94,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So see, here's the thing.

62
0:02:34.46,000 --> 0:02:36,000
While you're typing a CAPTCHA, during those 10 seconds,

63
0:02:37.1,000 --> 0:02:38,000
your brain is doing something amazing.

64
0:02:38.98,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do.

65
0:02:41.82,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds?

66
0:02:44.54,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve,

67
0:02:48.06,000 --> 0:02:5,000
yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks

68
0:02:50.86,000 --> 0:02:52,000
such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA,

69
0:02:53.06,000 --> 0:02:54,000
they solve a little bit of this problem?

70
0:02:55.02,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And the answer to that is "yes," and this is what we're doing now.

71
0:02:58.18,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Nowadays, while you're typing a CAPTCHA,

72
0:03:00.14,000 --> 0:03:02,000
not only are you authenticating yourself as a human,

73
0:03:02.593,000 --> 0:03:04,000
but in addition you're helping us to digitize books.

74
0:03:05.06,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Let me explain how this works.

75
0:03:06.54,000 --> 0:03:08,000
There's a lot of projects trying to digitize books.

76
0:03:08.98,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Google has one. The Internet Archive has one.

77
0:03:11.14,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Amazon, with the Kindle, is trying to digitize books.

78
0:03:13.66,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Basically, the way this works is you start with an old book.

79
0:03:16.86,000 --> 0:03:17,000
You've seen those things, right?

80
0:03:18.46,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Like a book?

81
0:03:19.7,000 --> 0:03:2,000
(Laughter)

82
0:03:20.98,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So you start with a book and then you scan it.

83
0:03:23.54,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now, scanning a book

84
0:03:24.78,000 --> 0:03:26,000
is like taking a digital photograph of every page.

85
0:03:27.18,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It gives you an image for every page.

86
0:03:29.02,000 --> 0:03:31,000
This is an image with text for every page of the book.

87
0:03:31.62,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able

88
0:03:34.78,000 --> 0:03:35,000
to decipher the words in this image.

89
0:03:36.54,000 --> 0:03:39,000
That's using a technology called OCR, for optical character recognition,

90
0:03:39.98,000 --> 0:03:4,000
which takes a picture of text

91
0:03:41.42,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and tries to figure out what text is in there.

92
0:03:43.62,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Now, the problem is that OCR is not perfect.

93
0:03:46.3,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Especially for older books

94
0:03:47.74,000 --> 0:03:5,000
where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow,

95
0:03:50.9,000 --> 0:03:51,000
OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words.

96
0:03:52.86,000 --> 0:03:54,000
For things that were written more than 50 years ago,

97
0:03:55.34,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words.

98
0:03:58.22,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So now we're taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize

99
0:04:01.62,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and we're getting people to read them for us

100
0:04:03.9,000 --> 0:04:05,000
while they're typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet.

101
0:04:06.14,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So the next time you type a CAPTCHA, these words that you're typing

102
0:04:09.34,000 --> 0:04:11,000
are actually words from books that are being digitized

103
0:04:11.94,000 --> 0:04:12,000
that the computer could not recognize.

104
0:04:13.82,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The reason we have two words nowadays instead of one

105
0:04:16.3,000 --> 0:04:17,000
is because one of the words

106
0:04:17.74,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is a word that the system just got out of a book,

107
0:04:20.34,000 --> 0:04:23,000
it didn't know what it was and it's going to present it to you.

108
0:04:23.38,000 --> 0:04:25,000
But since it doesn't know the answer, it cannot grade it.

109
0:04:26.1,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So we give you another word,

110
0:04:27.5,000 --> 0:04:29,000
for which the system does know the answer.

111
0:04:29.524,000 --> 0:04:32,000
We don't tell you which one's which and we say, please type both.

112
0:04:32.62,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And if you type the correct word

113
0:04:34.219,000 --> 0:04:36,000
for the one for which the system knows the answer,

114
0:04:36.62,000 --> 0:04:37,000
it assumes you are human

115
0:04:37.9,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly.

116
0:04:41.38,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And if we repeat this process to 10 different people

117
0:04:43.86,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and they agree on what the new word is,

118
0:04:45.78,000 --> 0:04:47,000
then we get one more word digitized accurately.

119
0:04:48.02,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So this is how the system works.

120
0:04:49.62,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And since we released it about three or four years ago,

121
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA,

122
0:04:55.22,000 --> 0:04:56,000
where people wasted their time,

123
0:04:56.78,000 --> 0:04:58,000
to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books.

124
0:04:59.74,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster,

125
0:05:01.94,000 --> 0:05:02,000
you help to digitize a book.

126
0:05:03.34,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Facebook: Every time you add a friend or poke somebody,

127
0:05:05.98,000 --> 0:05:06,000
you help to digitize a book.

128
0:05:07.38,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA.

129
0:05:10.34,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high

130
0:05:13.18,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that the number of words we're digitizing per day is really large.

131
0:05:16.34,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It's about 100 million a day,

132
0:05:17.78,000 --> 0:05:2,000
which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year.

133
0:05:21.3,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And this is all being done one word at a time

134
0:05:23.46,000 --> 0:05:25,000
by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet.

135
0:05:25.7,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Applause)

136
0:05:32.94,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Now, of course,

137
0:05:34.18,000 --> 0:05:37,000
since we're doing so many words per day,

138
0:05:37.54,000 --> 0:05:38,000
funny things can happen.

139
0:05:38.82,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This is especially true because now we're giving people

140
0:05:41.46,000 --> 0:05:43,000
two randomly chosen English words next to each other.

141
0:05:43.98,000 --> 0:05:44,000
So funny things can happen.

142
0:05:45.34,000 --> 0:05:46,000
For example, we presented this word.

143
0:05:47.1,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's the word "Christians"; there's nothing wrong with it.

144
0:05:49.86,000 --> 0:05:51,000
But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word,

145
0:05:52.82,000 --> 0:05:53,000
bad things can happen.

146
0:05:54.18,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So we get this.

147
0:05:55.42,000 --> 0:05:56,000
[bad Christians]

148
0:05:56.66,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But it's even worse, because the website where we showed this

149
0:05:59.58,000 --> 0:06:02,000
actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God.

150
0:06:02.66,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

151
0:06:04.38,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Oops.

152
0:06:05.62,000 --> 0:06:08,000
(Laughter)

153
0:06:09.5,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Here's another really bad one.

154
0:06:11.22,000 --> 0:06:12,000
JohnEdwards.com

155
0:06:12.54,000 --> 0:06:13,000
[Damn liberal]

156
0:06:13.78,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

157
0:06:18.3,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday.

158
0:06:21.14,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Of course, we're not just insulting people.

159
0:06:23.18,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Here's the thing. Since we're presenting two randomly chosen words,

160
0:06:26.38,000 --> 0:06:27,000
interesting things can happen.

161
0:06:27.86,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme

162
0:06:32.5,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that tens of thousands of people have participated in,

163
0:06:35.06,000 --> 0:06:36,000
which is called CAPTCHA art.

164
0:06:36.74,000 --> 0:06:37,000
I'm sure some of you have heard about it.

165
0:06:38.74,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Here's how it works.

166
0:06:40.02,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Imagine you're using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA

167
0:06:42.66,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that you think is somewhat peculiar,

168
0:06:44.42,000 --> 0:06:45,000
like this CAPTCHA.

169
0:06:45.66,000 --> 0:06:46,000
[invisible toaster]

170
0:06:46.9,000 --> 0:06:48,000
What you're supposed to do is you take a screenshot of it.

171
0:06:49.66,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Then of course, you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book.

172
0:06:53.34,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But first you take a screenshot

173
0:06:54.86,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and then you draw something that is related to it.

174
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter)

175
0:06:58.98,000 --> 0:06:59,000
That's how it works.

176
0:07:00.22,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Laughter)

177
0:07:01.58,000 --> 0:07:03,000
There are tens of thousands of these.

178
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Some of them are very cute.

179
0:07:06.356,000 --> 0:07:07,000
[clenched it]

180
0:07:07.593,000 --> 0:07:08,000
(Laughter)

181
0:07:09.46,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Some of them are funnier.

182
0:07:11.02,000 --> 0:07:12,000
[stoned Founders]

183
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Laughter)

184
0:07:16.66,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And some of them, like paleontological shvisle ...

185
0:07:20.113,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

186
0:07:22.06,000 --> 0:07:23,000
they contain Snoop Dogg.

187
0:07:23.3,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

188
0:07:26.46,000 --> 0:07:28,000
OK, so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA.

189
0:07:29.06,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project.

190
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
This is the number of distinct people

191
0:07:34.1,000 --> 0:07:37,000
that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCHA:

192
0:07:37.86,000 --> 0:07:4,000
750 million, a little over 10 percent of the world's population,

193
0:07:40.94,000 --> 0:07:41,000
has helped us digitize human knowledge.

194
0:07:42.86,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda.

195
0:07:45.98,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So the question that motivates my research is the following:

196
0:07:49.06,000 --> 0:07:51,000
If you look at humanity's large-scale achievements,

197
0:07:51.5,000 --> 0:07:52,000
these really big things

198
0:07:52.74,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that humanity has gotten together and done historically --

199
0:07:55.479,000 --> 0:07:57,000
like, for example, building the pyramids of Egypt

200
0:07:57.98,000 --> 0:07:58,000
or the Panama Canal

201
0:07:59.58,000 --> 0:08:01,000
or putting a man on the Moon --

202
0:08:01.66,000 --> 0:08:02,000
there is a curious fact about them,

203
0:08:03.38,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and it is that they were all done with about the same number of people.

204
0:08:06.74,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's weird; they were all done with about 100,000 people.

205
0:08:09.46,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And the reason for that is because, before the Internet,

206
0:08:12.14,000 --> 0:08:13,000
coordinating more than 100,000 people,

207
0:08:14.02,000 --> 0:08:17,000
let alone paying them, was essentially impossible.

208
0:08:17.06,000 --> 0:08:19,000
But now with the Internet, I've just shown you a project

209
0:08:19.74,000 --> 0:08:22,000
where we've gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge.

210
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So the question that motivates my research is,

211
0:08:25.46,000 --> 0:08:27,000
if we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000,

212
0:08:27.62,000 --> 0:08:29,000
what can we do with 100 million?

213
0:08:29.82,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So based on this question,

214
0:08:31.1,000 --> 0:08:34,000
we've had a lot of different projects that we've been working on.

215
0:08:34.18,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Let me tell you about one that I'm most excited about.

216
0:08:36.74,000 --> 0:08:38,000
This is something that we've been semiquietly working on

217
0:08:39.42,000 --> 0:08:4,000
for the last year and a half or so.

218
0:08:41.14,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It hasn't yet been launched. It's called Duolingo.

219
0:08:43.54,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Since it hasn't been launched, shhh!

220
0:08:45.3,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

221
0:08:46.98,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Yeah, I can trust you'll do that.

222
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So this is the project. Here's how it started.

223
0:08:51.5,000 --> 0:08:54,000
It started with me posing a question to my graduate student, Severin Hacker.

224
0:08:55.1,000 --> 0:08:56,000
OK, that's Severin Hacker.

225
0:08:57.299,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So I posed the question to my graduate student.

226
0:08:59.54,000 --> 0:09:01,000
By the way, you did hear me correctly; his last name is Hacker.

227
0:09:02.54,000 --> 0:09:03,000
(Laughter)

228
0:09:03.58,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So I posed this question to him: How can we get 100 million people

229
0:09:06.9,000 --> 0:09:08,000
translating the web into every major language for free?

230
0:09:10.5,000 --> 0:09:12,000
There's a lot of things to say about this question.

231
0:09:12.94,000 --> 0:09:13,000
First of all, translating the web.

232
0:09:14.62,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Right now, the web is partitioned into multiple languages.

233
0:09:17.44,000 --> 0:09:18,000
A large fraction of it is in English.

234
0:09:19.28,000 --> 0:09:21,000
If you don't know English, you can't access it.

235
0:09:21.52,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But there's large fractions in other different languages,

236
0:09:24.24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and if you don't know them, you can't access it.

237
0:09:26.52,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So I would like to translate all of the web,

238
0:09:28.64,000 --> 0:09:3,000
or at least most of it, into every major language.

239
0:09:31.04,000 --> 0:09:32,000
That's what I would like to do.

240
0:09:32.56,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Now, some of you may say, why can't we use computers to translate?

241
0:09:37.06,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Machine translation is starting to translate

242
0:09:39.18,000 --> 0:09:4,000
some sentences here and there.

243
0:09:40.66,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Why can't we use it to translate the web?

244
0:09:42.66,000 --> 0:09:44,000
The problem with that is it's not yet good enough

245
0:09:45.02,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and it probably won't be for the next 15 to 20 years.

246
0:09:47.54,000 --> 0:09:49,000
It makes a lot of mistakes. Even when it doesn't,

247
0:09:49.9,000 --> 0:09:52,000
since it makes so many mistakes, you don't know whether to trust it or not.

248
0:09:53.5,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So let me show you an example

249
0:09:54.94,000 --> 0:09:56,000
of something that was translated with a machine.

250
0:09:57.22,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Actually, it was a forum post.

251
0:09:58.7,000 --> 0:10:01,000
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript.

252
0:10:01.9,000 --> 0:10:03,000
It was translated from Japanese into English.

253
0:10:04.54,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So I'll just let you read.

254
0:10:06.34,000 --> 0:10:07,000
This person starts apologizing

255
0:10:08.14,000 --> 0:10:1,000
for the fact that it's translated with a computer.

256
0:10:10.62,000 --> 0:10:13,000
So the next sentence is going to be the preamble to the question.

257
0:10:14.42,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So he's just explaining something.

258
0:10:16.1,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Remember, it's a question about JavaScript.

259
0:10:18.18,000 --> 0:10:2,000
[At often, the goat-time install a error is vomit.]

260
0:10:20.82,000 --> 0:10:25,000
(Laughter)

261
0:10:25.94,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Then comes the first part of the question.

262
0:10:29.5,000 --> 0:10:31,000
[How many times like the wind, a pole, and the dragon?]

263
0:10:32.46,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Laughter)

264
0:10:37.14,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Then comes my favorite part of the question.

265
0:10:39.22,000 --> 0:10:4,000
[This insult to father's stones?]

266
0:10:41.18,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Laughter)

267
0:10:45.06,000 --> 0:10:46,000
And then comes the ending,

268
0:10:46.38,000 --> 0:10:48,000
which is my favorite part of the whole thing.

269
0:10:48.54,000 --> 0:10:51,000
[Please apologize for your stupidity. There are a many thank you.]

270
0:10:51.7,000 --> 0:10:53,000
(Laughter)

271
0:10:53.9,000 --> 0:10:55,000
OK, so computer translation, not yet good enough.

272
0:10:56.86,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So back to the question.

273
0:10:58.14,000 --> 0:11:,000
So we need people to translate the whole web.

274
0:11:01.14,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So now the next question you may have is,

275
0:11:03.14,000 --> 0:11:05,000
well, why can't we just pay people to do this?

276
0:11:05.34,000 --> 0:11:08,000
We could pay professional translators to translate the whole web.

277
0:11:08.46,000 --> 0:11:09,000
We could do that.

278
0:11:09.74,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Unfortunately, it would be extremely expensive.

279
0:11:11.98,000 --> 0:11:14,000
For example, translating a tiny fraction of the whole web, Wikipedia,

280
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
into one other language, Spanish.

281
0:11:17.78,000 --> 0:11:18,000
OK? Wikipedia exists in Spanish,

282
0:11:19.78,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but it's very small compared to the size of English.

283
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It's about 20 percent of the size of English.

284
0:11:24.46,000 --> 0:11:26,000
If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish,

285
0:11:27.34,000 --> 0:11:29,000
it would cost at least 50 million dollars --

286
0:11:29.5,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and this is even at the most exploited, outsourcing country out there.

287
0:11:33.18,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So it would be very expensive.

288
0:11:34.66,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So what we want to do is, we want to get 100 million people

289
0:11:37.446,000 --> 0:11:39,000
translating the web into every major language for free.

290
0:11:40.06,000 --> 0:11:42,000
If this is what you want to do, you quickly realize

291
0:11:42.5,000 --> 0:11:44,000
you're going to run into two big hurdles, two big obstacles.

292
0:11:45.46,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The first one is a lack of bilinguals.

293
0:11:48.78,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So I don't even know

294
0:11:50.98,000 --> 0:11:52,000
if there exists 100 million people out there using the web

295
0:11:53.74,000 --> 0:11:55,000
who are bilingual enough to help us translate.

296
0:11:56.06,000 --> 0:11:57,000
That's a big problem.

297
0:11:57.3,000 --> 0:12:,000
The other problem you're going to run into is a lack of motivation.

298
0:12:00.5,000 --> 0:12:03,000
How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the web for free?

299
0:12:04.06,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Normally, you have to pay people to do this.

300
0:12:06.38,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free?

301
0:12:09.02,000 --> 0:12:12,000
When we were starting to think about this, we were blocked by these two things.

302
0:12:12.78,000 --> 0:12:13,000
But then we realized, there's a way

303
0:12:14.5,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to solve both these problems with the same solution.

304
0:12:16.98,000 --> 0:12:17,000
To kill two birds with one stone.

305
0:12:18.62,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And that is to transform language translation

306
0:12:20.78,000 --> 0:12:22,000
into something that millions of people want to do

307
0:12:23.62,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals,

308
0:12:26.78,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and that is language education.

309
0:12:29.18,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So it turns out that today,

310
0:12:31.18,000 --> 0:12:34,000
there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language.

311
0:12:35.3,000 --> 0:12:37,000
People really want to learn a foreign language.

312
0:12:37.54,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And it's not just because they're being forced to do so in school.

313
0:12:40.7,000 --> 0:12:42,000
In the US alone, there are over five million people

314
0:12:43.14,000 --> 0:12:45,000
who have paid over $500 for software to learn a new language.

315
0:12:46.06,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So people really want to learn a new language.

316
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
So what we've been working on for the last year and a half

317
0:12:51.02,000 --> 0:12:53,000
is a new website -- it's called Duolingo --

318
0:12:53.1,000 --> 0:12:55,000
where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free

319
0:12:55.98,000 --> 0:12:57,000
while simultaneously translating the web.

320
0:12:58.06,000 --> 0:13:,000
And so basically, they're learning by doing.

321
0:13:00.62,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So the way this works

322
0:13:01.86,000 --> 0:13:04,000
is whenever you're a just a beginner, we give you very simple sentences.

323
0:13:05.3,000 --> 0:13:07,000
There's a lot of very simple sentences on the web.

324
0:13:07.7,000 --> 0:13:1,000
We give you very simple sentences along with what each word means.

325
0:13:10.94,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And as you translate them

326
0:13:12.3,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and as you see how other people translate them,

327
0:13:14.54,000 --> 0:13:15,000
you start learning the language.

328
0:13:16.14,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And as you get more advanced,

329
0:13:17.58,000 --> 0:13:19,000
we give you more complex sentences to translate.

330
0:13:19.86,000 --> 0:13:21,000
But at all times, you're learning by doing.

331
0:13:21.9,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Now, the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works.

332
0:13:25.62,000 --> 0:13:26,000
People are really learning a language.

333
0:13:27.5,000 --> 0:13:29,000
We're mostly done building it and now we're testing it.

334
0:13:30.14,000 --> 0:13:32,000
People really can learn a language with it.

335
0:13:32.22,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software.

336
0:13:35.74,000 --> 0:13:36,000
So people really do learn a language.

337
0:13:37.58,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And not only do they learn it as well, but actually it's more interesting.

338
0:13:41.1,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Because with Duolingo, people are learning with real content.

339
0:13:44.02,000 --> 0:13:46,000
As opposed to learning with made-up sentences,

340
0:13:46.22,000 --> 0:13:49,000
people are learning with real content, which is inherently interesting.

341
0:13:49.58,000 --> 0:13:5,000
So people really do learn a language.

342
0:13:51.42,000 --> 0:13:52,000
But perhaps more surprisingly,

343
0:13:53.06,000 --> 0:13:55,000
the translations that we get from people using the site,

344
0:13:55.82,000 --> 0:13:56,000
even though they're just beginners,

345
0:13:57.62,000 --> 0:13:58,000
the translations that we get

346
0:13:59.02,000 --> 0:14:01,000
are as accurate as those of professional language translators,

347
0:14:01.98,000 --> 0:14:02,000
which is very surprising.

348
0:14:03.22,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So let me show you one example.

349
0:14:04.78,000 --> 0:14:07,000
This is a sentence that was translated from German into English.

350
0:14:07.82,000 --> 0:14:09,000
The top is the German. The middle is an English translation

351
0:14:10.62,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that was done by a professional translator

352
0:14:12.9,000 --> 0:14:14,000
who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation.

353
0:14:15.3,000 --> 0:14:17,000
And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo,

354
0:14:18.02,000 --> 0:14:21,000
none of whom knew any German before they started using the site.

355
0:14:21.78,000 --> 0:14:22,000
If you can see, it's pretty much perfect.

356
0:14:23.78,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Of course, we play a trick here

357
0:14:25.34,000 --> 0:14:28,000
to make the translations as good as professional language translators.

358
0:14:28.7,000 --> 0:14:3,000
We combine the translations of multiple beginners

359
0:14:31.06,000 --> 0:14:33,000
to get the quality of a single professional translator.

360
0:14:33.98,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Now, even though we're combining the translations,

361
0:14:38.54,000 --> 0:14:4,000
the site actually can translate pretty fast.

362
0:14:41.34,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So let me show you,

363
0:14:42.58,000 --> 0:14:44,000
this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia

364
0:14:45.54,000 --> 0:14:46,000
from English into Spanish.

365
0:14:46.86,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Remember, this is 50 million dollars' worth of value.

366
0:14:49.86,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish,

367
0:14:52.34,000 --> 0:14:54,000
we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users.

368
0:14:55.06,000 --> 0:14:58,000
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users.

369
0:14:58.14,000 --> 0:15:,000
Since all the projects my group has worked on so far

370
0:15:00.62,000 --> 0:15:01,000
have gotten millions of users,

371
0:15:02.1,000 --> 0:15:04,000
we're hopeful that we'll be able to translate extremely fast.

372
0:15:05.02,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Now, the thing that I'm most excited about with Duolingo

373
0:15:08.02,000 --> 0:15:11,000
is I think this provides a fair business model for language education.

374
0:15:11.78,000 --> 0:15:12,000
So here's the thing:

375
0:15:13.02,000 --> 0:15:15,000
The current business model for language education

376
0:15:15.38,000 --> 0:15:16,000
is the student pays,

377
0:15:16.78,000 --> 0:15:19,000
and in particular, the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars.

378
0:15:19.86,000 --> 0:15:2,000
(Laughter)

379
0:15:21.7,000 --> 0:15:22,000
That's the current business model.

380
0:15:23.38,000 --> 0:15:24,000
The problem with this business model

381
0:15:25.14,000 --> 0:15:28,000
is that 95 percent of the world's population doesn't have 500 dollars.

382
0:15:28.46,000 --> 0:15:3,000
So it's extremely unfair towards the poor.

383
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
This is totally biased towards the rich.

384
0:15:33.22,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Now, see, in Duolingo,

385
0:15:34.86,000 --> 0:15:37,000
because while you learn, you're actually creating value,

386
0:15:38.54,000 --> 0:15:39,000
you're translating stuff --

387
0:15:39.9,000 --> 0:15:41,000
which, for example, we could charge somebody for translations,

388
0:15:42.86,000 --> 0:15:43,000
so this is how we could monetize this.

389
0:15:44.74,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Since people are creating value while they're learning,

390
0:15:47.38,000 --> 0:15:5,000
they don't have to pay with their money, they pay with their time.

391
0:15:50.5,000 --> 0:15:51,000
But the magical thing here

392
0:15:52.447,000 --> 0:15:54,000
is that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways

393
0:15:55.467,000 --> 0:15:56,000
learning the language.

394
0:15:56.7,000 --> 0:15:57,000
So the nice thing about Duolingo

395
0:15:58.3,000 --> 0:16:,000
is, I think, it provides a fair business model --

396
0:16:00.66,000 --> 0:16:02,000
one that doesn't discriminate against poor people.

397
0:16:03.06,000 --> 0:16:04,000
So here's the site. Thank you.

398
0:16:04.54,000 --> 0:16:11,000
(Applause)

399
0:16:13.06,000 --> 0:16:15,000
We haven't yet launched,

400
0:16:15.5,000 --> 0:16:18,000
but if you go there, you can sign up to be part of our private beta,

401
0:16:18.82,000 --> 0:16:2,000
which is probably going to start in three or four weeks.

402
0:16:21.5,000 --> 0:16:22,000
We haven't yet launched it.

403
0:16:22.86,000 --> 0:16:23,000
By the way, I'm the one talking here,

404
0:16:24.7,000 --> 0:16:26,000
but Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team,

405
0:16:27.1,000 --> 0:16:28,000
some of whom are here. So thank you.

406
0:16:28.86,000 --> 0:16:33,000
(Applause)

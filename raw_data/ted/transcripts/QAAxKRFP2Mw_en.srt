1
0:00:13.38,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'd like you to imagine, just for a moment,

2
0:00:16.642,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that your eyelashes grew inwards instead of outwards,

3
0:00:21.72,000 --> 0:00:23,000
so that every time you blinked,

4
0:00:24.045,000 --> 0:00:27,000
they would scrape the front of your eyeballs,

5
0:00:27.165,000 --> 0:00:28,000
damaging the corneas,

6
0:00:28.966,000 --> 0:00:31,000
so that slowly and painfully, you went blind.

7
0:00:33.307,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Well, that's what happens to a person who has trachoma.

8
0:00:37.607,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now, this little boy here, Pamelo, from Zambia, he has trachoma.

9
0:00:42.8,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And if we don't do anything, he's going to go blind.

10
0:00:46.7,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Trachoma is a curious disease.

11
0:00:48.916,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's a bacterial infection that's passed from person to person

12
0:00:53.1,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and by flies.

13
0:00:55.057,000 --> 0:00:58,000
The repeated infection will scar your eyelids

14
0:00:58.895,000 --> 0:01:02,000
so that they contract and they turn inside out.

15
0:01:03.879,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It particularly affects women,

16
0:01:05.815,000 --> 0:01:07,000
because they have the contact with children.

17
0:01:08.569,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So what you'll often see in places like Ethiopia

18
0:01:12.117,000 --> 0:01:16,000
are girls who have tweezers like this around their necks,

19
0:01:16.869,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and they use them to pluck out their eyelashes.

20
0:01:20.482,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But of course, that only gives them temporary respite,

21
0:01:23.15,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because they just grow back more vicious than before.

22
0:01:27.538,000 --> 0:01:31,000
There are around two million people in the world

23
0:01:31.64,000 --> 0:01:34,000
who are blind or visually impaired because of trachoma.

24
0:01:35.283,000 --> 0:01:39,000
And we believe there may be as many as 200 million people

25
0:01:39.649,000 --> 0:01:4,000
who are at risk.

26
0:01:41.418,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Now, it's a very old disease.

27
0:01:44.188,000 --> 0:01:49,000
What you can see is a photo of a wall of a tomb in Northern Sudan.

28
0:01:49.855,000 --> 0:01:51,000
A colleague and I were traveling in a very remote village,

29
0:01:52.851,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and we asked an old man to take us down into a little tomb.

30
0:01:56.955,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Now, on the wall, we saw two eyes.

31
0:01:59.829,000 --> 0:02:,000
One is crying,

32
0:02:01.169,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and you can see there are tweezers next to it.

33
0:02:04.127,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Simon said to me, "My God, do you think that's trachoma?"

34
0:02:08.103,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So we sent this picture to the British Museum,

35
0:02:11.523,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and they confirmed that, yes, this is trachoma.

36
0:02:14.879,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So, thousands of years ago,

37
0:02:17.188,000 --> 0:02:2,000
the ancient Nubians were painting pictures of trachoma

38
0:02:21.038,000 --> 0:02:22,000
on the walls of their tomb.

39
0:02:22.926,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And the tragedy is

40
0:02:24.95,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that disease is still rampant in that area today.

41
0:02:28.98,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And the crazy thing is, we know how to stop it.

42
0:02:33.171,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And what's great is that the trachoma community have all come together

43
0:02:38.072,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to pool their efforts.

44
0:02:40.157,000 --> 0:02:43,000
We don't compete; we collaborate.

45
0:02:43.712,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I have to tell you, that's not always the case

46
0:02:45.94,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in my experience in the NGO world.

47
0:02:50.149,000 --> 0:02:51,000
We've created something

48
0:02:51.996,000 --> 0:02:54,000
called the International Coalition for Trachoma Control.

49
0:02:56.298,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And together, we've developed a strategy to fight it.

50
0:03:00.719,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This strategy is called the SAFE strategy,

51
0:03:03.688,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and it's been approved by the World Health Organization.

52
0:03:07.434,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The "S" stands for "surgery."

53
0:03:10.292,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It's very straightforward procedure

54
0:03:12.347,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to turn the eyelids back the right way.

55
0:03:15.141,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We train nurses to do it,

56
0:03:17.165,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and they use local anesthetics.

57
0:03:19.236,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And as you can see, you can do it in somebody's front porch, if need be.

58
0:03:24.688,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Then "A" stands for "antibiotics."

59
0:03:27.982,000 --> 0:03:29,000
These are donated by Pfizer,

60
0:03:30.784,000 --> 0:03:34,000
who also pay for those drugs to be transported to the port in-country.

61
0:03:35.768,000 --> 0:03:38,000
From there, they're taken to the villages,

62
0:03:39.078,000 --> 0:03:43,000
where hundreds of thousands of community volunteers

63
0:03:43.919,000 --> 0:03:46,000
will distribute those drugs to the people.

64
0:03:47.696,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Now, we train those volunteers,

65
0:03:50.157,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and we also help the ministries with all that complex logistics.

66
0:03:54.819,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And every one of those volunteers has a pole like this.

67
0:04:00.526,000 --> 0:04:01,000
It's called a "dose pole."

68
0:04:02.606,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This one's from Cameroon.

69
0:04:04.759,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And you can see it's marked different colors,

70
0:04:07.213,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and you can tell how many pills you should give somebody,

71
0:04:10.807,000 --> 0:04:11,000
based on how tall they are.

72
0:04:14.442,000 --> 0:04:16,000
"F" stands for "face washing."

73
0:04:17.498,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Now, we used to have trachoma in the UK and in the US.

74
0:04:21.22,000 --> 0:04:22,000
In fact, President Carter,

75
0:04:23.236,000 --> 0:04:26,000
he talks about how trachoma was a real problem in Georgia

76
0:04:27.077,000 --> 0:04:28,000
when he was a little boy.

77
0:04:29.046,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And in the UK, the famous eye hospital, Moorfields,

78
0:04:33.053,000 --> 0:04:35,000
was originally a trachoma hospital.

79
0:04:36.039,000 --> 0:04:41,000
What we do is teach kids like this how important it is to wash their faces.

80
0:04:42.976,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And finally, "E" stands for "environment,"

81
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
where we help the communities build latrines,

82
0:04:48.904,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and we teach them to separate their animals from their living quarters

83
0:04:52.777,000 --> 0:04:54,000
in order to reduce the fly population.

84
0:04:56.19,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So we know how to tackle the disease.

85
0:04:59.491,000 --> 0:05:01,000
But we need to know where it is.

86
0:05:01.784,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And we do,

87
0:05:03.182,000 --> 0:05:07,000
because a few years ago, Sightsavers led an incredible program

88
0:05:07.809,000 --> 0:05:09,000
called the Global Trachoma Mapping Project.

89
0:05:11.158,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It took us three years,

90
0:05:13.487,000 --> 0:05:16,000
but we went through 29 countries,

91
0:05:16.864,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and we taught local health workers to go district by district,

92
0:05:21.936,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and they examined the eyelids of over two and a half million people.

93
0:05:27.38,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And they used Android phones in order to download the data.

94
0:05:31.776,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And from that, we were able to build a map

95
0:05:34.577,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that showed us where the disease was.

96
0:05:37.125,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Now, this is a very high-level map

97
0:05:39.571,000 --> 0:05:42,000
that shows you which countries had a problem with trachoma.

98
0:05:43.38,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And you may ask me, "Well, does this strategy actually work?"

99
0:05:47.634,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Yes, it does.

100
0:05:49.426,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This map shows you the progress that we've made to date.

101
0:05:52.803,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The green countries believe they've already eliminated trachoma,

102
0:05:56.899,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and they have either been through or are in the process of

103
0:05:59.907,000 --> 0:06:01,000
having that validated by the WHO.

104
0:06:02.642,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Countries in yellow have the money they need,

105
0:06:05.293,000 --> 0:06:08,000
they have the resources to eliminate trachoma.

106
0:06:08.937,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And some of them are really nearly there.

107
0:06:11.795,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But the red countries, they don't have enough funding.

108
0:06:14.898,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They cannot eliminate trachoma unless they get more.

109
0:06:18.721,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And we're quite concerned, though, that the progress to date may stall.

110
0:06:23.857,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So when we were talking to the Audacious ideas guys,

111
0:06:28.658,000 --> 0:06:29,000
we asked ourselves:

112
0:06:30.468,000 --> 0:06:34,000
If we really, really pushed ourselves over the next four or five years

113
0:06:34.96,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and we had the money,

114
0:06:36.817,000 --> 0:06:38,000
what do we think we could achieve?

115
0:06:39.523,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Well, we believe that we can eliminate trachoma

116
0:06:44.396,000 --> 0:06:46,000
in 12 African countries

117
0:06:47.245,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and across the Americas

118
0:06:50.445,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and all across the Pacific.

119
0:06:53.15,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And we can make significant progress

120
0:06:56.196,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in two countries which have the highest burden of the disease,

121
0:07:00.015,000 --> 0:07:02,000
which is Ethiopia and Nigeria.

122
0:07:03.237,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And in doing all of that,

123
0:07:05.333,000 --> 0:07:1,000
we can leverage more than two billion dollars' worth of donated drugs.

124
0:07:11.039,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Applause)

125
0:07:17.277,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Now, this map here shows you the impact that we'll have --

126
0:07:20.077,000 --> 0:07:22,000
look how many countries are going green.

127
0:07:22.419,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And there, you can see progress in Ethiopia and Nigeria.

128
0:07:25.491,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Now, yes, there are some countries that are still red.

129
0:07:28.436,000 --> 0:07:3,000
These are mainly countries which are in conflict --

130
0:07:31.261,000 --> 0:07:34,000
places like Yemen, South Sudan -- where it's very difficult to work.

131
0:07:35.555,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So, we have the team, the strategy and the map.

132
0:07:40.364,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And we also have the relationships with the governments

133
0:07:44.46,000 --> 0:07:47,000
so that we can make sure that our program is coordinated

134
0:07:48.386,000 --> 0:07:5,000
with other disease-control programs,

135
0:07:50.697,000 --> 0:07:51,000
so that we can be efficient.

136
0:07:53.449,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Wouldn't it be amazing if we could do this?

137
0:07:57.704,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We'd have trachoma on the run.

138
0:07:59.982,000 --> 0:08:01,000
We would be on the home straight

139
0:08:02.341,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to eliminate this disease from the whole world.

140
0:08:06.8,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But before I finish, I just want to share with you

141
0:08:09.737,000 --> 0:08:11,000
some words from the founder of Sightsavers,

142
0:08:12.264,000 --> 0:08:14,000
a guy called Sir John Wilson.

143
0:08:14.571,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Now, he was blinded at the age of 12.

144
0:08:16.988,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And he said,

145
0:08:18.309,000 --> 0:08:2,000
"People don't go blind by the million.

146
0:08:21.468,000 --> 0:08:23,000
They go blind one by one."

147
0:08:24.658,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And in the excitement of being able to say

148
0:08:27.226,000 --> 0:08:3,000
we've got rid of trachoma for the whole country,

149
0:08:30.674,000 --> 0:08:34,000
let's not forget that, actually, this is a devastating disease

150
0:08:35.317,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that destroys the lives of individual people.

151
0:08:39.156,000 --> 0:08:4,000
People like Twiba.

152
0:08:40.681,000 --> 0:08:42,000
Now, I met Twiba last year in Tanzania.

153
0:08:43.618,000 --> 0:08:46,000
She had had trachoma for as long as she could remember.

154
0:08:46.887,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And a couple of months before I met her, she'd had the operation.

155
0:08:50.66,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's no exaggeration to say

156
0:08:53.158,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that this had totally transformed her life.

157
0:08:57.198,000 --> 0:09:,000
We'd saved the sight that she had left, and she was free of pain.

158
0:09:01.515,000 --> 0:09:02,000
She could sleep.

159
0:09:03.071,000 --> 0:09:05,000
She could work, she could socialize.

160
0:09:05.848,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And she said to me,

161
0:09:08.222,000 --> 0:09:09,000
"I have my life back."

162
0:09:10.587,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And it was impossible not to be moved by her story.

163
0:09:14.445,000 --> 0:09:16,000
But there are so many Twibas.

164
0:09:16.786,000 --> 0:09:18,000
I want to find all the Twibas,

165
0:09:19.35,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and I don't want anyone to go blind in agony anymore.

166
0:09:23.138,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Now, you know, there are so many intractable problems in this world.

167
0:09:29.333,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But this is not one of them.

168
0:09:31.602,000 --> 0:09:33,000
This is something that we can solve.

169
0:09:34.983,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And we can ensure

170
0:09:36.507,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that kids like this can grow up free from the fear of trachoma.

171
0:09:42.261,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So, for the sake of kids like this,

172
0:09:45.65,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and for the sake of people like Twiba,

173
0:09:48.849,000 --> 0:09:5,000
let's get rid of trachoma.

174
0:09:52.391,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Do you think we can?

175
0:09:55.01,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Well, yeah, if we really, really want to.

176
0:09:58.121,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Yes, we can.

177
0:10:00.06,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So thank you.

178
0:10:01.251,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Applause)

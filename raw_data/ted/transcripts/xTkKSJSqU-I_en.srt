1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What we're really here to talk about is the "how."

2
0:00:15.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Okay, so how exactly do we create this

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
world-shattering, if you will, innovation?

4
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Now, I want to tell you a quick story.

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
We'll go back a little more than a year.

6
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
In fact, the date -- I'm curious to know

7
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
if any of you know what happened on this momentous date?

8
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
It was February 3rd, 2008.

9
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Anyone remember what happened,

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
February 3rd, 2008?

11
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Super Bowl. I heard it over here. It was the date of the Super Bowl.

12
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And the reason that this date was so momentous

13
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
is that what my colleagues, John King

14
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and Halee Fischer-Wright, and I noticed

15
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:52,000
as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties,

16
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
is that it seemed to us

17
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that across the United States,

18
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
if you will, tribal councils had convened.

19
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And they had discussed things of great national importance.

20
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Like, "Do we like the Budweiser commercial?"

21
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and, "Do we like the nachos?" and, "Who is going to win?"

22
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support.

23
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And if you go back in time to February 3rd,

24
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination.

25
0:01:20.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way.

26
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But when we talked to people,

27
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
it appeared that a funnel effect had happened

28
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
in these tribes all across the United States.

29
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now what is a tribe? A tribe is a group of

30
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
about 20 -- so kind of more than a team --

31
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
20 to about 150 people.

32
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And it's within these tribes that all of our work gets done.

33
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
But not just work. It's within these tribes

34
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that societies get built,

35
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that important things happen.

36
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And so as we surveyed the, if you will, representatives

37
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
from various tribal councils that met,

38
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
also known as Super Bowl parties,

39
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day.

40
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
February 4th, we posted it on our website. This was before Super Tuesday.

41
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We said, "The tribes that we're in

42
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
are saying it's going to be Obama."

43
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now, the reason we knew that

44
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
was because we spent the previous 10 years

45
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
studying tribes, studying these naturally occurring groups.

46
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:16,000
All of you are members of tribes.

47
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
In walking around at the break,

48
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
many of you had met members of your tribe. And you were talking to them.

49
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And many of you were doing what great, if you will, tribal leaders do,

50
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which is to find someone

51
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
who is a member of a tribe,

52
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe,

53
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and make introductions.

54
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
That is in fact what great tribal leaders do.

55
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So here is the bottom line.

56
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
If you focus in on a group like this --

57
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
this happens to be a USC game --

58
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras

59
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and do magnification factors so you could see individual people,

60
0:02:52.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
you would in fact see not a single crowd,

61
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
just like there is not a single crowd here,

62
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
but you would see these tribes that are then coming together.

63
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And from a distance it appears that it's a single group.

64
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And so people form tribes.

65
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
They always have. They always will.

66
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Just as fish swim and birds fly,

67
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:12,000
people form tribes. It's just what we do.

68
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But here's the rub.

69
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Not all tribes are the same,

70
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and what makes the difference is the culture.

71
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Now here is the net out of this.

72
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You're all a member of tribes.

73
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:25,000
If you can find a way to take the tribes that you're in

74
0:03:25.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and nudge them forward,

75
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
along these tribal stages

76
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to what we call Stage Five, which is the top of the mountain.

77
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:35,000
But we're going to start with what we call Stage One.

78
0:03:35.16,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Now, this is the lowest of the stages.

79
0:03:37.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
You don't want this. Okay?

80
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen.

81
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
But it's one that I think we need to learn from.

82
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Stage One produces people

83
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
who do horrible things.

84
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech.

85
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Stage One is a group where people

86
0:03:52.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
systematically sever relationships from functional tribes,

87
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and then pool together

88
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
with people who think like they do.

89
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Stage One is literally the culture of gangs

90
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and it is the culture of prisons.

91
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now, again, we don't often deal with Stage One.

92
0:04:06.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And I want to make the point

93
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that as members of society, we need to.

94
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It's not enough to simply write people off.

95
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
But let's move on to Stage Two.

96
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Now, Stage One, you'll notice, says, in effect, "Life Sucks."

97
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So, this other book that Steve mentioned,

98
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that just came out, called "The Three Laws of Performance,"

99
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
my colleague, Steve Zaffron and I,

100
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
argue that as people see the world, so they behave.

101
0:04:31.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Well, if people see the world in such a way that life sucks,

102
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
then their behavior will follow automatically from that.

103
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
It will be despairing hostility.

104
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
They'll do whatever it takes to survive,

105
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:45,000
even if that means undermining other people.

106
0:04:45.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Now, my birthday is coming up shortly,

107
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and my driver's license expires.

108
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And the reason that that's relevant is that very soon

109
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I will be walking into what we call

110
0:04:54.16,000 --> 0:04:56,000
a Stage Two tribe,

111
0:04:56.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
which looks like this.

112
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

113
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now, am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles

114
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
across the land, you find a Stage Two culture?

115
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
No. But in the one near me,

116
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
where I have to go in just a few days,

117
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:1,000
what I will say when I'm standing in line is,

118
0:05:10.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
"How can people be so dumb, and yet live?"

119
0:05:13.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Now, am I saying that there are dumb people working here?

121
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Actually, no, I'm not.

122
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But I'm saying the culture makes people dumb.

123
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So in a Stage Two culture --

124
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and we find these in all sorts of different places --

125
0:05:29.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
you find them, in fact, in the best organizations in the world.

126
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
You find them in all places in society.

127
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I've come across them at the organizations

128
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
that everybody raves about as being best in class.

129
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But here is the point. If you believe and you say

130
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:43,000
to people in your tribe, in effect,

131
0:05:43.16,000 --> 0:05:45,000
"My life sucks.

132
0:05:45.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I mean, if I got to go to TEDx USC

133
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does."

134
0:05:49.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
If that's how you talked, imagine what kind of work would get done.

135
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
What kind of innovation would get done?

136
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen?

137
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
In fact it would be basically nil.

138
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Now when we go on to Stage Three: this is the one

139
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that hits closest to home for many of us.

140
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move.

141
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And we park. And we stay.

142
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Stage Three says, "I'm great. And you're not."

143
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

144
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I'm great and you're not.

145
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Now imagine having a whole room of people

146
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
saying, in effect, "I'm great and you're not."

147
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Or, "I'm going to find some way to compete with you

148
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and come out on top as a result of that."

149
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
A whole group of people communicating that way, talking that way.

150
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I know this sounds like a joke. Three doctors walk into a bar.

151
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But, in this case, three doctors walk into an elevator.

152
0:06:38.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book.

153
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And one doctor said to the others, "Did you see my article

154
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in the New England Journal of Medicine?"

155
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And the other said, "No. That's great. Congratulations!"

156
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said,

157
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
"Well while you were, you know, doing your research," --

158
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
notice the condescending tone --

159
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
"While you were off doing your research, I was off doing more surgeries

160
0:06:59.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution."

161
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And the third one got the same wry smile and said,

162
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
"Well, while you were off doing your research,

163
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery,

164
0:07:09.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that eventually we'll train monkeys to do,

165
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
or cells or robots, or maybe not even need to do it at all,

166
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
I was off running the future of the residency program,

167
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
which is really the future of medicine."

168
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back.

169
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And the elevator door opened, and they all walked out.

170
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe.

171
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Now, we find these in places

172
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:32,000
where really smart, successful people show up.

173
0:07:32.16,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Like, oh, I don't know, TEDx USC.

174
0:07:36.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

175
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation.

176
0:07:40.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
It is moving from Stage Three

177
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to Stage Four.

178
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Let's take a look at a quick video snippet.

179
0:07:47.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
This is from a company called Zappos, located outside Las Vegas.

180
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And my question on the other side is just going to be,

181
0:07:53.16,000 --> 0:07:55,000
"What do you think they value?"

182
0:07:55.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
It was not Christmas time. There was a Christmas tree.

183
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
This is their lobby.

184
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth.

185
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon.

186
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Okay, we're going through the hallway here at Zappos.

187
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
This is a call center. Notice how it's decorated.

188
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Notice people are applauding for us.

189
0:08:20.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
They don't know who we are and they don't care. And if they did

190
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
they probably wouldn't applaud.

191
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
But you'll notice the level of excitement.

192
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Notice, again, how they decorate their office.

193
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Now, what's important to people at Zappos,

194
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
these may not be the things that are important to you.

195
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:37,000
But they value things like fun. And they value creativity.

196
0:08:37.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
One of their stated values is, "Be a little bit weird."

197
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And you'll notice they are a little bit weird.

198
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So when individuals come together

199
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and find something that unites them

200
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that's greater than their individual competence,

201
0:08:51.16,000 --> 0:08:53,000
then something very important happens.

202
0:08:53.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
The group gels. And it changes

203
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
from a group of highly motivated

204
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
but fairly individually-centric people

205
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
into something larger,

206
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:06,000
into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence.

207
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things.

208
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
But you'll notice we're not at the top of the mountain yet.

209
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
There is, in fact, another stage.

210
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Now, some of you may not recognize the scene that's up here.

211
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five, which is "Life is Great,"

212
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:23,000
this may seem a little incongruous.

213
0:09:23.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
This is a scene or snippet

214
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:28,000
from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa

215
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:31,000
for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize.

216
0:09:31.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Now think about that. South Africa,

217
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
terrible atrocities had happened in the society.

218
0:09:36.16,000 --> 0:09:38,000
And people came together

219
0:09:38.16,000 --> 0:09:42,000
focused only on those two values: truth and reconciliation.

220
0:09:42.16,000 --> 0:09:44,000
There was no road map. No one had ever done

221
0:09:44.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
anything like this before.

222
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And in this atmosphere, where the only guidance

223
0:09:49.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
was people's values and their noble cause,

224
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
what this group accomplished was historic.

225
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And people, at the time, feared that South Africa

226
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:,000
would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone,

227
0:10:00.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
descending into one skirmish after another

228
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
in a civil war that seems to have no end.

229
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:08,000
In fact, South Africa has not gone down that road.

230
0:10:08.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Largely because people like Desmond Tutu

231
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
set up a Stage Five process

232
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to involve the thousands and perhaps millions

233
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
of tribes in the country, to bring everyone together.

234
0:10:19.16,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So, people hear this and they conclude the following,

235
0:10:22.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
as did we in doing the study.

236
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Okay, got it. I don't want to talk Stage One.

237
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
That's like, you know, "Life sucks." Who wants to talk that way?

238
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
I don't want to talk like they do

239
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
at the particular DMV that's close to where Dave lives.

240
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
I really don't want to just say "I'm great,"

241
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
because that kind of sounds narcissistic, and then I won't have any friends.

242
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Saying, "We're great" -- that sounds pretty good.

243
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
But I should really talk Stage Five, right? "Life is great."

244
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Well, in fact, there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings

245
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
that come out of all this.

246
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
The first one, if you look at the Declaration of Independence

247
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and actually read it,

248
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
the phrase that sticks in many of our minds

249
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
is things about inalienable rights.

250
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I mean, that's Stage Five, right? Life is great,

251
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
oriented only by our values,

252
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
no other guidance.

253
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
In fact, most of the document is written at Stage Two.

254
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
"My life sucks because I live under a tyrant,

255
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
also known as King George.

256
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
We're great! Who is not great? England!"

257
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Sorry. (Laughter)

258
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Well, what about other great leaders? What about Gandhi?

259
0:11:21.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
What about Martin Luther King?

260
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I mean, surely these were just people who preached, "Life is great," right?

261
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another.

262
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
In fact, Martin Luther King's most famous line was at Stage Three.

263
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
He didn't say "We have a dream." He said, "I have a dream."

264
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Why did he do that? Because most people

265
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
are not at Stage Five.

266
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Two percent are at Stage One.

267
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
About 25 percent are at Stage Two,

268
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
saying, in effect, "My life sucks."

269
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:54,000
48 percent of working tribes say, these are employed tribes,

270
0:11:54.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
say, "I'm great and you're not."

271
0:11:56.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And we have to duke it out every day, so we resort to politics.

272
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Only about 22 percent of tribes

273
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
are at Stage Four,

274
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
oriented by our values, saying "We're great.

275
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And our values are beginning to unite us."

276
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Only two percent, only two percent of tribes

277
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
get to Stage Five.

278
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And those are the ones that change the world.

279
0:12:14.16,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So the first little finding from this

280
0:12:16.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels

281
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
so that you can touch every person in society.

282
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
But you don't leave them where you found them. Okay?

283
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are.

284
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So we have to have the ability to talk

285
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
all the levels, to go to where they are.

286
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And then leaders nudge people

287
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
within their tribes to the next level.

288
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I'd like to show you some examples of this.

289
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:42,000
One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan,

290
0:12:42.16,000 --> 0:12:44,000
former Mayor of San Francisco. Before that

291
0:12:44.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
he was Chief of Police in San Francisco.

292
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And he grew up essentially in Stage One.

293
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And you know what changed his life? It was walking into

294
0:12:51.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
one of these, a Boys and Girls Club.

295
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Now here is what happened to this person

296
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco.

297
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
He went from being alive and passionate

298
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
at Stage One -- remember, "Life sucks,

299
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
despairing hostility, I will do whatever it takes to survive" --

300
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:08,000
to walking into a Boys and Girls Club,

301
0:13:08.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
folding his arms, sitting down in a chair,

302
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and saying, "Wow. My life really sucks.

303
0:13:12.16,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I don't know anybody.

304
0:13:14.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I mean, if I was into boxing, like they were,

305
0:13:16.16,000 --> 0:13:18,000
then my life wouldn't suck. But I don't. So it does.

306
0:13:18.16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
So I'm going to sit here in my chair and not do anything."

307
0:13:20.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
In fact, that's progress.

308
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
We move people from Stage One to Stage Two

309
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
by getting them in a new tribe

310
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and then, over time, getting them connected.

311
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So, what about moving

312
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
from Stage Three to Stage Four?

313
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:37,000
I want to argue that we're doing that right here.

314
0:13:37.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
TED represents a set of values,

315
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and as we unite around these values,

316
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
something really interesting begins to emerge.

317
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
If you want this experience to live on

318
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
as something historic,

319
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
then at the reception tonight I'd like to encourage you to do something

320
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
beyond what people normally do

321
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and call networking.

322
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Which is not just to meet new people

323
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
and extend your reach, extend your influence,

324
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
but instead, find someone you don't know,

325
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
and find someone else you don't know,

326
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and introduce them.

327
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
That's called a triadic relationship.

328
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
See, people who build world-changing tribes do that.

329
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:18,000
They extend the reach of their tribes

330
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
by connecting them, not just to myself,

331
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
so that my following is greater,

332
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
but I connect people who don't know each other

333
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
to something greater than themselves.

334
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And ultimately that adds to their values.

335
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
But we're not done yet. Because then how do we go from Stage Four,

336
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
which is great, to Stage Five?

337
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
The story that I like to end with is this. It comes out of

338
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
a place called the Gallup Organization.

339
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:42,000
You know they do polls, right?

340
0:14:42.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So it's Stage Four. We're great. Who is not great?

341
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Pretty much everybody else who does polls.

342
0:14:47.16,000 --> 0:14:5,000
If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll,

343
0:14:50.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
people will pay attention to the Gallup poll. Okay, we understand that.

344
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So, they were bored.

345
0:14:55.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
They wanted to change the world. So here is the question someone asked.

346
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
"How could we,

347
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
instead of just polling what Asia thinks

348
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
or what the United States thinks,

349
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
or who thinks what about Obama

350
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
versus McCain or something like that,

351
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
what does the entire world think?"

352
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:16,000
And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll.

353
0:15:16.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
They had people involved who were Nobel laureates

354
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
in economics, who reported being bored.

355
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper

356
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and were trying to figure out, "How do we survey the population

357
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
of Sub-Saharan Africa?

358
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
How do we survey populations that don't have access to technology,

359
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and speak languages we don't speak,

360
0:15:32.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
and we don't know anyone who speaks those languages. Because in order

361
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
to achieve on this great mission,

362
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
we have to be able to do it.

363
0:15:39.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Incidentally, they did pull it off.

364
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And they released the first-ever world poll.

365
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
So I'd like to leave you with these thoughts.

366
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:49,000
First of all: we all form tribes, all of us.

367
0:15:49.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
You're in tribes here. Hopefully you're extending the reach

368
0:15:51.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
of the tribes that you have.

369
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
But the question on the table is this:

370
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:15:58,000
What kind of an impact are the tribes

371
0:15:58.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
that you are in making?

372
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
You're hearing one presentation after another,

373
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
often representing a group of people, a tribe,

374
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
about how they have changed the world.

375
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:1,000
If you do what we've talked about, you listen

376
0:16:10.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you're in.

377
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:16,000
And you don't leave them where they are. You nudge them forward.

378
0:16:16.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
You remember to talk all five culture stages.

379
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Because we've got people in all five, around us.

380
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And the question that I'd like to leave you with is this:

381
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Will your tribes change the world?

382
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Thank you very much.

383
0:16:29.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
(Applause)

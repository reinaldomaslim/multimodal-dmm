2
0:00:12.765,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm a little nervous, because my wife Yvonne said to me,

3
0:00:16.274,000 --> 0:00:18,000
she said, "Geoff, you watch the TED Talks."

4
0:00:18.443,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I said, "Yes, honey, I love TED Talks."

5
0:00:20.379,000 --> 0:00:23,000
She said, "You know, they're like, really smart, talented -- "

6
0:00:23.867,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I said, "I know, I know." (Laughter)

7
0:00:25.61,000 --> 0:00:29,000
She said, "They don't want, like, the angry black man."

8
0:00:30.402,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:32.355,000 --> 0:00:33,000
So I said, "No, I'm gonna be good, Honey,

10
0:00:33.966,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'm gonna be good. I am."

11
0:00:36.021,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But I am angry. (Laughter)

12
0:00:39.439,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And the last time I looked, I'm --

13
0:00:43.145,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Applause)

14
0:00:45.952,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So this is why I'm excited but I'm angry.

15
0:00:51.38,000 --> 0:00:55,000
This year, there are going to be millions of our children

16
0:00:56.299,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that we're going to needlessly lose,

17
0:00:59.263,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that we could -- right now, we could save them all.

18
0:01:03.853,000 --> 0:01:06,000
You saw the quality of the educators who were here.

19
0:01:07.698,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Do not tell me they could not reach those kids

20
0:01:11.035,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and save them. I know they could.

21
0:01:13.306,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It is absolutely possible.

22
0:01:16.167,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Why haven't we fixed this?

23
0:01:18.55,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Those of us in education have held on to a business plan

24
0:01:23.314,000 --> 0:01:26,000
that we don't care how many millions of young people fail,

25
0:01:27.169,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we're going to continue to do the same thing that didn't work,

26
0:01:30.264,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and nobody is getting crazy about it -- right? --

27
0:01:35.207,000 --> 0:01:37,000
enough to say, "Enough is enough."

28
0:01:37.352,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So here's a business plan that simply does not make any sense.

29
0:01:41.736,000 --> 0:01:44,000
You know, I grew up in the inner city,

30
0:01:45.096,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and there were kids who were failing

31
0:01:49.983,000 --> 0:01:55,000
in schools 56 years ago when I first went to school,

32
0:01:56.517,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and those schools are still lousy today, 56 years later.

33
0:02:03.291,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And you know something about a lousy school?

34
0:02:05.275,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's not like a bottle of wine.

35
0:02:07.891,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Right? (Laughter)

36
0:02:09.202,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Where you say, like, '87 was like a good year, right?

37
0:02:12.98,000 --> 0:02:15,000
That's now how this thing -- I mean, every single year,

38
0:02:16.096,000 --> 0:02:18,000
it's still the same approach, right?

39
0:02:18.502,000 --> 0:02:22,000
One size fits all, if you get it, fine, and if you don't,

40
0:02:23.061,000 --> 0:02:26,000
tough luck. Just tough luck.

41
0:02:26.721,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Why haven't we allowed innovation to happen?

42
0:02:29.666,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Do not tell me we can't do better than this.

43
0:02:32.131,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Look, you go into a place that's failed kids for 50 years,

44
0:02:37.596,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and you say, "So what's the plan?"

45
0:02:40.06,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And they say, "We'll, we're going to do

46
0:02:42.164,000 --> 0:02:45,000
what we did last year this year."

47
0:02:45.18,000 --> 0:02:47,000
What kind of business model is that?

48
0:02:47.983,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Banks used to open and operate between 10 and 3.

49
0:02:53.961,000 --> 0:02:58,000
They operated 10 to 3. They were closed for lunch hour.

50
0:02:59.074,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now, who can bank between 10 and 3? The unemployed.

51
0:03:04.007,000 --> 0:03:07,000
They don't need banks. They got no money in the banks.

52
0:03:07.395,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Who created that business model? Right?

53
0:03:10.781,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And it went on for decades.

54
0:03:12.894,000 --> 0:03:13,000
You know why? Because they didn't care.

55
0:03:14.809,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It wasn't about the customers.

56
0:03:16.793,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It was about bankers. They created something that worked for them.

57
0:03:22.311,000 --> 0:03:24,000
How could you go to the bank

58
0:03:24.39,000 --> 0:03:26,000
when you were at work? It didn't matter.

59
0:03:26.799,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And they don't care whether or not Geoff is upset

60
0:03:29.422,000 --> 0:03:31,000
he can't go to the bank. Go find another bank.

61
0:03:32.011,000 --> 0:03:35,000
They all operate the same way. Right?

62
0:03:35.449,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Now, one day, some crazy banker had an idea.

63
0:03:39.312,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Maybe we should keep the bank open when people come home from work.

64
0:03:43.289,000 --> 0:03:46,000
They might like that. What about a Saturday?

65
0:03:46.416,000 --> 0:03:48,000
What about introducing technology?

66
0:03:49.384,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Now look, I'm a technology fan, but I have to admit

67
0:03:51.603,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to you all I'm a little old.

68
0:03:53.944,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So I was a little slow, and I did not trust technology,

69
0:03:56.897,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and when they first came out with those new contraptions,

70
0:04:00.795,000 --> 0:04:03,000
these tellers that you put in a card and they give you money,

71
0:04:04.465,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I was like, "There's no way that machine is going to count that money right.

72
0:04:08.08,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I am never using that, right?"

73
0:04:10.428,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So technology has changed. Things have changed.

74
0:04:16.363,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Yet not in education. Why?

75
0:04:19.049,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Why is it that when we had rotary phones,

76
0:04:24.009,000 --> 0:04:28,000
when we were having folks being crippled by polio,

77
0:04:28.32,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that we were teaching

78
0:04:31.417,000 --> 0:04:33,000
the same way then that we're doing right now?

79
0:04:33.672,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And if you come up with a plan to change things,

80
0:04:38.08,000 --> 0:04:4,000
people consider you radical.

81
0:04:40.341,000 --> 0:04:42,000
They will say the worst things about you.

82
0:04:42.732,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I said one day, well, look, if the science says --

83
0:04:46.624,000 --> 0:04:49,000
this is science, not me -- that our poorest children

84
0:04:50.283,000 --> 0:04:53,000
lose ground in the summertime --

85
0:04:53.593,000 --> 0:04:55,000
You see where they are in June and say, okay, they're there.

86
0:04:55.695,000 --> 0:04:57,000
You look at them in September, they've gone down.

87
0:04:58.372,000 --> 0:05:02,000
You say, whoo! So I heard about that in '75

88
0:05:02.588,000 --> 0:05:03,000
when I was at the Ed School at Harvard.

89
0:05:04.219,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I said, "Oh, wow, this is an important study."

90
0:05:07.109,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Because it suggests we should do something.

91
0:05:11.119,000 --> 0:05:14,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:14.684,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Every 10 years they reproduce the same study.

93
0:05:17.788,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It says exactly the same thing:

94
0:05:19.411,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Poor kids lose ground in the summertime.

95
0:05:21.677,000 --> 0:05:25,000
The system decides you can't run schools in the summer.

96
0:05:26.51,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You know, I always wonder, who makes up those rules?

97
0:05:29.736,000 --> 0:05:31,000
For years I went to -- Look, I went the Harvard Ed School.

98
0:05:32.307,000 --> 0:05:33,000
I thought I knew something.

99
0:05:33.415,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They said it was the agrarian calendar, and people had —

100
0:05:36.496,000 --> 0:05:37,000
but let me tell you why that doesn't make sense.

101
0:05:38.078,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I never got that. I never got that,

102
0:05:41.36,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because anyone knows if you farm,

103
0:05:43.512,000 --> 0:05:46,000
you don't plant crops in July and August.

104
0:05:46.587,000 --> 0:05:48,000
You plant them in the spring.

105
0:05:49.336,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So who came up with this idea? Who owns it?

106
0:05:53.105,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Why did we ever do it?

107
0:05:54.788,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Well it just turns out in the 1840s we did have,

108
0:05:57.086,000 --> 0:05:59,000
schools were open all year. They were open all year,

109
0:06:00.064,000 --> 0:06:03,000
because we had a lot of folks who had to work all day.

110
0:06:03.088,000 --> 0:06:04,000
They didn't have any place for their kids to go.

111
0:06:04.435,000 --> 0:06:06,000
It was a perfect place to have schools.

112
0:06:06.469,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So this is not something that is ordained

113
0:06:09.36,000 --> 0:06:11,000
from the education gods.

114
0:06:12.354,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So why don't we? Why don't we?

115
0:06:14.53,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Because our business has refused to use science.

116
0:06:20.48,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Science. You have Bill Gates coming out and saying,

117
0:06:23.492,000 --> 0:06:26,000
"Look, this works, right? We can do this."

118
0:06:26.592,000 --> 0:06:31,000
How many places in America are going to change? None.

119
0:06:31.741,000 --> 0:06:33,000
None. Okay, yeah, there are two. All right?

120
0:06:34.453,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Yes, there'll be some place, because some folks will do the right thing.

121
0:06:39.239,000 --> 0:06:43,000
As a profession, we have to stop this. The science is clear.

122
0:06:43.784,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Here's what we know.

123
0:06:46.079,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We know that the problem begins immediately.

124
0:06:52.054,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Right? This idea, zero to three.

125
0:06:55.963,000 --> 0:06:57,000
My wife, Yvonne, and I, we have four kids,

126
0:06:58.449,000 --> 0:07:01,000
three grown ones and a 15-year-old.

127
0:07:01.956,000 --> 0:07:02,000
That's a longer story.

128
0:07:03.443,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Laughter)

129
0:07:05.092,000 --> 0:07:08,000
With our first kids, we did not know the science

130
0:07:08.171,000 --> 0:07:09,000
about brain development.

131
0:07:10.011,000 --> 0:07:12,000
We didn't know how critical those first three years were.

132
0:07:12.625,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We didn't know what was happening in those young brains.

133
0:07:15.039,000 --> 0:07:17,000
We didn't know the role that language,

134
0:07:17.593,000 --> 0:07:19,000
a stimulus and response, call and response,

135
0:07:20.484,000 --> 0:07:22,000
how important that was in developing those children.

136
0:07:23.113,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We know that now. What are we doing about it? Nothing.

137
0:07:27.978,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Wealthy people know. Educated people know.

138
0:07:32.074,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And their kids have an advantage.

139
0:07:33.744,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Poor people don't know,

140
0:07:35.331,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and we're not doing anything to help them at all.

141
0:07:38.335,000 --> 0:07:39,000
But we know this is critical.

142
0:07:39.68,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Now, you take pre-kindergarten.

143
0:07:43.41,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We know it's important for kids.

144
0:07:45.48,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Poor kids need that experience.

145
0:07:48.854,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Nope. Lots of places, it doesn't exist.

146
0:07:53.783,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We know health services matter.

147
0:07:56.331,000 --> 0:07:57,000
You know, we provide health services

148
0:07:57.928,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and people are always fussing at me about, you know,

149
0:08:00.867,000 --> 0:08:03,000
because I'm all into accountability and data

150
0:08:04.782,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and all of that good stuff, but we do health services,

151
0:08:07.976,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and I have to raise a lot of money.

152
0:08:09.217,000 --> 0:08:1,000
People used to say when they'd come fund us,

153
0:08:11.034,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"Geoff, why do you provide these health services?"

154
0:08:13.813,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I used to make stuff up. Right?

155
0:08:15.922,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I'd say, "Well, you know a child

156
0:08:18.473,000 --> 0:08:21,000
who has cavities is not going to, uh,

157
0:08:22.226,000 --> 0:08:24,000
be able to study as well."

158
0:08:24.286,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And I had to because I had to raise the money.

159
0:08:28.291,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But now I'm older, and you know what I tell them?

160
0:08:30.843,000 --> 0:08:32,000
You know why I provide kids with those health benefits

161
0:08:33.585,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and the sports and the recreation and the arts?

162
0:08:35.525,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Because I actually like kids.

163
0:08:39.019,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I actually like kids. (Laughter) (Applause)

164
0:08:44.38,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But when they really get pushy, people really get pushy,

165
0:08:47.555,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I say, "I do it because you do it for your kid."

166
0:08:50.651,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And you've never read a study from MIT that says

167
0:08:53.643,000 --> 0:08:55,000
giving your kid dance instruction

168
0:08:56.619,000 --> 0:08:58,000
is going to help them do algebra better,

169
0:08:59.536,000 --> 0:09:01,000
but you will give that kid dance instruction,

170
0:09:01.611,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and you will be thrilled that that kid wants to do dance instruction,

171
0:09:05.124,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and it will make your day. And why shouldn't poor kids

172
0:09:08.445,000 --> 0:09:13,000
have the same opportunity? It's the floor for these children.

173
0:09:13.999,000 --> 0:09:15,000
(Applause)

174
0:09:16.701,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So here's the other thing.

175
0:09:19.673,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I'm a tester guy. I believe you need data, you need information,

176
0:09:23.54,000 --> 0:09:25,000
because you work at something, you think it's working,

177
0:09:25.705,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and you find out it's not working.

178
0:09:28.442,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I mean, you're educators. You work, you say,

179
0:09:30.308,000 --> 0:09:33,000
you think you've got it, great, no? And you find out they didn't get it.

180
0:09:33.353,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But here's the problem with testing.

181
0:09:35.922,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The testing that we do --

182
0:09:38.187,000 --> 0:09:4,000
we're going to have our test in New York next week —

183
0:09:40.906,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is in April.

184
0:09:42.861,000 --> 0:09:44,000
You know when we're going to get the results back?

185
0:09:45.787,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Maybe July, maybe June.

186
0:09:48.954,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And the results have great data.

187
0:09:51.762,000 --> 0:09:54,000
They'll tell you Raheem really struggled,

188
0:09:54.839,000 --> 0:09:57,000
couldn't do two-digit multiplication -- so great data,

189
0:09:58.217,000 --> 0:10:,000
but you're getting it back after school is over.

190
0:10:00.746,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And so, what do you do?

191
0:10:03.229,000 --> 0:10:06,000
You go on vacation. (Laughter)

192
0:10:06.431,000 --> 0:10:07,000
You come back from vacation.

193
0:10:07.766,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Now you've got all of this test data from last year.

194
0:10:13.216,000 --> 0:10:15,000
You don't look at it.

195
0:10:15.569,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Why would you look at it?

196
0:10:17.832,000 --> 0:10:19,000
You're going to go and teach this year.

197
0:10:19.991,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So how much money did we just spend on all of that?

198
0:10:23.243,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Billions and billions of dollars

199
0:10:26.246,000 --> 0:10:29,000
for data that it's too late to use.

200
0:10:29.303,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I need that data in September.

201
0:10:31.129,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I need that data in November.

202
0:10:32.9,000 --> 0:10:34,000
I need to know you're struggling, and I need to know

203
0:10:34.908,000 --> 0:10:36,000
whether or not what I did corrected that.

204
0:10:37.293,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I need to know that this week.

205
0:10:39.274,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I don't need to know that at the end of the year when it's too late.

206
0:10:42.853,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Because in my older years, I've become somewhat of a clairvoyant.

207
0:10:48.043,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I can predict school scores.

208
0:10:51.266,000 --> 0:10:53,000
You take me to any school.

209
0:10:53.311,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I'm really good at inner city schools that are struggling.

210
0:10:56.369,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And you tell me last year 48 percent of those kids

211
0:11:00.184,000 --> 0:11:02,000
were on grade level.

212
0:11:02.791,000 --> 0:11:03,000
And I say, "Okay, what's the plan, what did we do

213
0:11:04.685,000 --> 0:11:04,000
from last year to this year?"

214
0:11:05.634,000 --> 0:11:06,000
You say, "We're doing the same thing."

215
0:11:07.449,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I'm going to make a prediction. (Laughter)

216
0:11:10.204,000 --> 0:11:13,000
This year, somewhere between 44

217
0:11:13.37,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and 52 percent of those kids will be on grade level.

218
0:11:16.265,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And I will be right every single time.

219
0:11:19.84,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So we're spending all of this money, but we're getting what?

220
0:11:24.229,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Teachers need real information right now

221
0:11:26.821,000 --> 0:11:27,000
about what's happening to their kids.

222
0:11:28.41,000 --> 0:11:33,000
The high stakes is today, because you can do something about it.

223
0:11:33.803,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So here's the other issue that I just think

224
0:11:38.637,000 --> 0:11:4,000
we've got to be concerned about.

225
0:11:41.445,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We can't stifle innovation in our business.

226
0:11:45.725,000 --> 0:11:48,000
We have to innovate. And people in our business get mad about innovation.

227
0:11:49.618,000 --> 0:11:5,000
They get angry if you do something different.

228
0:11:51.605,000 --> 0:11:52,000
If you try something new, people are always like,

229
0:11:53.382,000 --> 0:11:57,000
"Ooh, charter schools." Hey, let's try some stuff. Let's see.

230
0:11:57.879,000 --> 0:11:59,000
This stuff hasn't worked for 55 years.

231
0:12:00.24,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Let's try something different. And here's the rub.

232
0:12:03.311,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Some of it's not going to work.

233
0:12:05.403,000 --> 0:12:07,000
You know, people tell me, "Yeah, those charter schools, a lot of them don't work."

234
0:12:08.141,000 --> 0:12:11,000
A lot of them don't. They should be closed.

235
0:12:11.609,000 --> 0:12:12,000
I mean, I really believe they should be closed.

236
0:12:13.515,000 --> 0:12:17,000
But we can't confuse figuring out the science

237
0:12:17.824,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and things not working with we shouldn't therefore do anything.

238
0:12:22.6,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Right? Because that's not the way the world works.

239
0:12:24.502,000 --> 0:12:25,000
If you think about technology,

240
0:12:26.008,000 --> 0:12:28,000
imagine if that's how we thought about technology.

241
0:12:28.522,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Every time something didn't work,

242
0:12:29.819,000 --> 0:12:31,000
we just threw in the towel and said, "Let's forget it." Right?

243
0:12:32.365,000 --> 0:12:35,000
You know, they convinced me. I'm sure some of you were like me --

244
0:12:35.534,000 --> 0:12:39,000
the latest and greatest thing, the PalmPilot.

245
0:12:40.059,000 --> 0:12:42,000
They told me, "Geoff, if you get this PalmPilot

246
0:12:42.538,000 --> 0:12:43,000
you'll never need another thing."

247
0:12:44.491,000 --> 0:12:48,000
That thing lasted all of three weeks. It was over.

248
0:12:48.932,000 --> 0:12:51,000
I was so disgusted I spent my money on this thing.

249
0:12:52.691,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Did anybody stop inventing? Not a person. Not a soul.

250
0:12:58.608,000 --> 0:13:,000
The folks went out there. They kept inventing.

251
0:13:01.112,000 --> 0:13:04,000
The fact that you have failure, that shouldn't stop you

252
0:13:04.222,000 --> 0:13:06,000
from pushing the science forward.

253
0:13:07.108,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Our job as educators,

254
0:13:09.28,000 --> 0:13:11,000
there's some stuff we know that we can do.

255
0:13:11.745,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And we've got to do better. The evaluation, we have to start with kids earlier,

256
0:13:15.724,000 --> 0:13:17,000
we have to make sure that we provide the support to young people.

257
0:13:18.648,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We've got to give them all of these opportunities.

258
0:13:21.056,000 --> 0:13:24,000
So that we have to do. But this innovation issue,

259
0:13:24.372,000 --> 0:13:27,000
this idea that we've got to keep innovating

260
0:13:28.164,000 --> 0:13:3,000
until we really nail this science down

261
0:13:31.088,000 --> 0:13:33,000
is something that is absolutely critical.

262
0:13:33.296,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And this is something, by the way,

263
0:13:35.52,000 --> 0:13:38,000
that I think is going to be a challenge for our entire field.

264
0:13:39.055,000 --> 0:13:44,000
America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right.

265
0:13:44.334,000 --> 0:13:46,000
We have run out of time.

266
0:13:47.003,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I don't know about a fiscal cliff, but I know there's an educational cliff

267
0:13:50.091,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that we are walking over right this very second,

268
0:13:53.544,000 --> 0:13:57,000
and if we allow folks to continue this foolishness

269
0:13:57.984,000 --> 0:13:59,000
about saying we can't afford this —

270
0:14:00.946,000 --> 0:14:02,000
So Bill Gates says it's going to cost five billion dollars.

271
0:14:03.192,000 --> 0:14:05,000
What is five billion dollars to the United States?

272
0:14:05.752,000 --> 0:14:07,000
What did we spend in Afghanistan this year?

273
0:14:08.425,000 --> 0:14:11,000
How many trillions? (Applause)

274
0:14:12.392,000 --> 0:14:15,000
When the country cares about something,

275
0:14:15.416,000 --> 0:14:18,000
we'll spend a trillion dollars without blinking an eye.

276
0:14:19.065,000 --> 0:14:21,000
When the safety of America is threatened,

277
0:14:22.009,000 --> 0:14:24,000
we will spend any amount of money.

278
0:14:24.88,000 --> 0:14:27,000
The real safety of our nation

279
0:14:27.936,000 --> 0:14:29,000
is preparing this next generation

280
0:14:30.313,000 --> 0:14:32,000
so that they can take our place

281
0:14:32.552,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and be the leaders of the world

282
0:14:36.739,000 --> 0:14:39,000
when it comes to thinking and technology and democracy

283
0:14:39.936,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and all that stuff we care about.

284
0:14:42.313,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I dare say it's a pittance,

285
0:14:46.858,000 --> 0:14:49,000
what it would require for us to really

286
0:14:50.543,000 --> 0:14:52,000
begin to solve some of these problems.

287
0:14:52.791,000 --> 0:14:57,000
So once we do that, I'll no longer be angry. (Laughter)

288
0:14:58.18,000 --> 0:15:03,000
So, you guys, help me get there.

289
0:15:03.975,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Thank you all very much. Thank you.

290
0:15:06.304,000 --> 0:15:15,000
(Applause)

291
0:15:15.627,000 --> 0:15:19,000
John Legend: So what is the high school dropout rate at Harlem Children's Zone?

292
0:15:19.835,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Geoffrey Canada: Well, you know, John,

293
0:15:21.302,000 --> 0:15:23,000
100 percent of our kids graduated high school

294
0:15:23.625,000 --> 0:15:24,000
last year in my school.

295
0:15:24.776,000 --> 0:15:25,000
A hundred percent of them went to college.

296
0:15:26.244,000 --> 0:15:29,000
This year's seniors will have 100 percent graduating high school.

297
0:15:29.634,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Last I heard we had 93 percent accepted to college.

298
0:15:32.696,000 --> 0:15:34,000
We'd better get that other seven percent.

299
0:15:35.31,000 --> 0:15:41,000
So that's just how this goes. (Applause)

300
0:15:42.005,000 --> 0:15:44,000
JL: So how do you stick with them after they leave high school?

301
0:15:44.598,000 --> 0:15:46,000
GC: Well, you know, one of the bad problems

302
0:15:47.187,000 --> 0:15:49,000
we have in this country is these kids, the same kids,

303
0:15:49.629,000 --> 0:15:5,000
these same vulnerable kids, when you get them in school,

304
0:15:51.558,000 --> 0:15:52,000
they drop out in record numbers.

305
0:15:52.9,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And so we've figured out that you've got to really design

306
0:15:56.565,000 --> 0:15:59,000
a network of support for these kids that in many ways

307
0:15:59.989,000 --> 0:16:01,000
mimics what a good parent does.

308
0:16:02.454,000 --> 0:16:05,000
They harass you, right? They call you, they say,

309
0:16:05.551,000 --> 0:16:07,000
"I want to see your grades. How'd you do on that last test?

310
0:16:07.662,000 --> 0:16:09,000
What are you talking about that you want to leave school?

311
0:16:10.625,000 --> 0:16:11,000
And you're not coming back here."

312
0:16:11.915,000 --> 0:16:13,000
So a bunch of my kids know you can't come back to Harlem

313
0:16:14.17,000 --> 0:16:15,000
because Geoff is looking for you.

314
0:16:15.501,000 --> 0:16:18,000
They're like, "I really can't come back." No. You'd better stay in school.

315
0:16:18.804,000 --> 0:16:2,000
But I'm not kidding about some of this,

316
0:16:21.63,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and it gets a little bit to the grit issue.

317
0:16:23.426,000 --> 0:16:27,000
When kids know that you refuse to let them fail,

318
0:16:27.62,000 --> 0:16:28,000
it puts a different pressure on them,

319
0:16:29.524,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and they don't give up as easy.

320
0:16:31.212,000 --> 0:16:33,000
So sometimes they don't have it inside,

321
0:16:33.654,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and they're, like, "You know, I don't want to do this,

322
0:16:35.7,000 --> 0:16:38,000
but I know my mother's going to be mad."

323
0:16:39.053,000 --> 0:16:41,000
Well, that matters to kids, and it helps get them through.

324
0:16:41.782,000 --> 0:16:44,000
We try to create a set of strategies that gets them tutoring

325
0:16:45.591,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and help and support, but also a set of encouragements

326
0:16:49.526,000 --> 0:16:51,000
that say to them, "You can do it. It is going to be hard,

327
0:16:52.136,000 --> 0:16:54,000
but we refuse to let you fail."

328
0:16:54.194,000 --> 0:16:55,000
JL: Well, thank you Dr. Canada.

329
0:16:55.774,000 --> 0:16:56,000
Please give it up for him one more time.

330
0:16:57.438,000 --> 0:17:02,000

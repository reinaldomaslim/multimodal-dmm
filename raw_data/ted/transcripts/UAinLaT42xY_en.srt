0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I'd like to talk a little bit this morning

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
about what happens if we move from design

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to design thinking.

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Now this rather old photo up there

5
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is actually the first project I was ever hired to do,

6
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
something like 25 years ago.

7
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
It's a woodworking machine, or at least a piece of one,

8
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and my task was to

9
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
make this thing a little bit more modern,

10
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
a little bit easier to use.

11
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I thought, at the time, I did a pretty good job.

12
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Unfortunately, not very long afterwards

13
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
the company went out of business.

14
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
This is the second project that I did. It's a fax machine.

15
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I put an attractive shell around some new technology.

16
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Again, 18 months later,

17
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the product was obsolete.

18
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And now, of course, the whole technology is obsolete.

19
0:00:58.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
Now, I'm a fairly slow learner,

20
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
but eventually it occurred to me that

21
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
maybe what passed for design

22
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
wasn't all that important --

23
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
making things more attractive,

24
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
making them a bit easier to use,

25
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
making them more marketable.

26
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
By focusing on a design,

27
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
maybe just a single product,

28
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I was being incremental

29
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and not having much of an impact.

30
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
But I think this small view of design

31
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is a relatively recent phenomenon,

32
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and in fact really emerged

33
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:31,000
in the latter half of the 20th century

34
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
as design became a tool of consumerism.

35
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So when we talk about design today,

36
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and particularly when we read about it in the popular press,

37
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
we're often talking about products like these.

38
0:01:42.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Amusing? Yes. Desirable? Maybe.

39
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Important? Not so very.

40
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But this wasn't always the way.

41
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And I'd like to suggest that if we take

42
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
a different view of design,

43
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and focus less on the object

44
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
and more on design thinking as an approach,

45
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that we actually might see the result in a bigger impact.

46
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now this gentleman, Isambard Kingdom Brunel,

47
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
designed many great things in his career in the 19th century,

48
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
including the Clifton suspension bridge in Bristol

49
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and the Thames tunnel at Rotherhithe.

50
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Both great designs and actually very innovative too.

51
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
His greatest creation

52
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
runs actually right through here in Oxford.

53
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
It's called the Great Western Railway.

54
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And as a kid I grew up very close to here,

55
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and one of my favorite things to do

56
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
was to cycle along by the side of the railway

57
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
waiting for the great big express trains to roar past.

58
0:02:41.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
You can see it represented here in J.M.W. Turner's painting,

59
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:46,000
"Rain, Steam and Speed".

60
0:02:46.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Now, what Brunel said that he wanted to achieve for his passengers

61
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
was the experience of floating across the countryside.

62
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now, this was back in the 19th century.

63
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And to do that meant creating the flattest gradients

64
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
that had ever yet been made,

65
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which meant building long viaducts across river valleys --

66
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
this is actually the viaduct across the Thames at Maidenhead --

67
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and long tunnels such as the one at Box, in Wiltshire.

68
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But he didn't stop there. He didn't stop

69
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
with just trying to design the best railway journey.

70
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
He imagined an integrated transportation system

71
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in which it would be possible for a passenger to embark

72
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:29,000
on a train in London

73
0:03:29.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and disembark from a ship in New York.

74
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
One journey from London to New York.

75
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
This is the S.S. Great Western that he built

76
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to take care of the second half of that journey.

77
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now, Brunel was working 100 years before

78
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:47,000
the emergence of the design profession,

79
0:03:47.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but I think he was using design thinking

80
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:55,000
to solve problems and to create world-changing innovations.

81
0:03:55.16,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Now, design thinking begins with what Roger Martin,

82
0:03:57.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
the business school professor at the University of Toronto,

83
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
calls integrative thinking.

84
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And that's the ability to exploit opposing ideas

85
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and opposing constraints

86
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
to create new solutions.

87
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
In the case of design, that means

88
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
balancing desirability, what humans need,

89
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
with technical feasibility,

90
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and economic viability.

91
0:04:21.16,000 --> 0:04:23,000
With innovations like the Great Western,

92
0:04:23.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
we can stretch that balance to the absolute limit.

93
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
So somehow, we went from this to this.

94
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Systems thinkers who were reinventing the world,

95
0:04:37.16,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to a priesthood of folks in black turtlenecks and designer glasses

96
0:04:42.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
working on small things.

97
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
As our industrial society matured,

98
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:5,000
so design became a profession

99
0:04:50.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and it focused on an ever smaller canvas

100
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
until it came to stand for aesthetics,

101
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
image and fashion.

102
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
Now I'm not trying to throw stones here.

103
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I'm a fully paid-up member of that priesthood,

104
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and somewhere in here I have my designer glasses.

105
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
There we go.

106
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But I do think that perhaps design

107
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is getting big again.

108
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And that's happening through

109
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
the application of design thinking

110
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to new kinds of problems --

111
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to global warming, to education,

112
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
healthcare, security, clean water, whatever.

113
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And as we see this reemergence of design thinking

114
0:05:27.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and we see it beginning to tackle new kinds of problems,

115
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:33,000
there are some basic ideas that I think we can observe that are useful.

116
0:05:33.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And I'd like to talk about some of those

117
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
just for the next few minutes.

118
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The first of those is that design is

119
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
human-centered.

120
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
It may integrate technology and economics,

121
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but it starts with what humans need, or might need.

122
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
What makes life easier, more enjoyable?

123
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
What makes technology useful and usable?

124
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But that is more than simply good ergonomics,

125
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
putting the buttons in the right place.

126
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It's often about understanding culture and context

127
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
before we even know where to start to have ideas.

128
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So when a team was working on a new vision screening program in India,

129
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
they wanted to understand what the aspirations

130
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and motivations were of these school children

131
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to understand how they might play a role

132
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in screening their parents.

133
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Conversion Sound has developed a high quality,

134
0:06:24.16,000 --> 0:06:27,000
ultra-low-cost digital hearing aid

135
0:06:27.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
for the developing world.

136
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now, in the West we rely on highly trained technicians

137
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to fit these hearing aids.

138
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
In places like India, those technicians simply don't exist.

139
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So it took a team working in India

140
0:06:41.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
with patients and community health workers

141
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to understand how a PDA

142
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and an application on a PDA

143
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
might replace those technicians

144
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:52,000
in a fitting and diagnostic service.

145
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Instead of starting with technology,

146
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
the team started with people and culture.

147
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
So if human need is the place to start,

148
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:02,000
then design thinking rapidly moves on to

149
0:07:02.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
learning by making.

150
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Instead of thinking about what to build,

151
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
building in order to think.

152
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now, prototypes speed up the process of innovation,

153
0:07:13.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
because it is only when we put our ideas out into the world

154
0:07:16.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that we really start to understand their strengths and weaknesses.

155
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And the faster we do that,

156
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
the faster our ideas evolve.

157
0:07:24.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Now, much has been said and written about

158
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
the Aravind Eye Institute in Madurai, India.

159
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
They do an incredible job of serving very poor patients

160
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
by taking the revenues from those who can afford to pay

161
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to cross-subsidize those who cannot.

162
0:07:39.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Now, they are very efficient,

163
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
but they are also very innovative.

164
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
When I visited them a few years ago,

165
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
what really impressed me was their willingness

166
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
to prototype their ideas very early.

167
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
This is the manufacturing facility

168
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:56,000
for one of their biggest cost breakthroughs.

169
0:07:56.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
They make their own intraocular lenses.

170
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
These are the lenses that replace those

171
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that are damaged by cataracts.

172
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And I think it's partly their prototyping mentality

173
0:08:07.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that really allowed them to achieve the breakthrough.

174
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Because they brought the cost down

175
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
from $200 a pair,

176
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
down to just $4 a pair.

177
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Partly they did this by instead of building

178
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
a fancy new factory,

179
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:25,000
they used the basement of one of their hospitals.

180
0:08:25.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And instead of installing the large-scale machines

181
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:3,000
used by western producers,

182
0:08:30.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
they used low-cost CAD/CAM prototyping technology.

183
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
They are now the biggest manufacturer of these lenses in the developing world

184
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and have recently moved into a custom factory.

185
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
So if human need is the place to start,

186
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and prototyping, a vehicle for progress,

187
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
then there are also some questions to ask about the destination.

188
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Instead of seeing its primary objective as consumption,

189
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:58,000
design thinking is beginning to explore the potential of participation --

190
0:08:58.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
the shift from a passive relationship

191
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
between consumer and producer

192
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to the active engagement of everyone

193
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
in experiences that are meaningful,

194
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
productive and profitable.

195
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So I'd like to take the idea that Rory Sutherland talked about,

196
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
this notion that intangible things are worth perhaps more than physical things,

197
0:09:17.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and take that a little bit further and say that

198
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I think the design of participatory systems,

199
0:09:22.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in which many more forms of value

200
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
beyond simply cash

201
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
are both created and measured,

202
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:33,000
is going to be the major theme, not only for design,

203
0:09:33.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
but also for our economy as we go forward.

204
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:41,000
So William Beveridge, when he wrote the first of his famous reports in 1942,

205
0:09:41.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
created what became Britain's welfare state

206
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
in which he hoped that every citizen

207
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
would be an active participant

208
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:52,000
in their own social well-being.

209
0:09:52.16,000 --> 0:09:55,000
By the time he wrote his third report,

210
0:09:55.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
he confessed that he had failed

211
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and instead had created a society of welfare consumers.

212
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Hilary Cottam, Charlie Leadbeater,

213
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and Hugo Manassei of Participle

214
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
have taken this idea of participation,

215
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and in their manifesto entitled Beveridge 4.0,

216
0:10:13.16,000 --> 0:10:15,000
they are suggesting a framework

217
0:10:15.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
for reinventing the welfare state.

218
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So in one of their projects called Southwark Circle,

219
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
they worked with residents in Southwark, South London

220
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and a small team of designers

221
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
to develop a new membership organization

222
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
to help the elderly with household tasks.

223
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Designs were refined and developed

224
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
with 150 older people and their families

225
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
before the service was launched earlier this year.

226
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
We can take this idea of participation

227
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
perhaps to its logical conclusion

228
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and say that design may have its greatest impact

229
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
when it's taken out of the hands of designers

230
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and put into the hands of everyone.

231
0:10:56.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Nurses and practitioners at U.S. healthcare system

232
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Kaiser Permanente

233
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:06,000
study the topic of improving the patient experience,

234
0:11:06.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
and particularly focused on the way that they exchange knowledge

235
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and change shift.

236
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Through a program of observational research,

237
0:11:16.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
brainstorming new solutions and rapid prototyping,

238
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:22,000
they've developed a completely new way to change shift.

239
0:11:22.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
They went from retreating to the nurse's station

240
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to discuss the various states and needs of patients,

241
0:11:28.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
to developing a system that happened on the ward

242
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:34,000
in front of patients, using a simple software tool.

243
0:11:34.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
By doing this they brought the time that they were away from patients

244
0:11:36.16,000 --> 0:11:4,000
down from 40 minutes to 12 minutes, on average.

245
0:11:40.16,000 --> 0:11:44,000
They increased patient confidence and nurse happiness.

246
0:11:44.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
When you multiply that by all the nurses

247
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
in all the wards in 40 hospitals in the system,

248
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:51,000
it resulted, actually, in a pretty big impact.

249
0:11:51.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And this is just one of thousands

250
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:59,000
of opportunities in healthcare alone.

251
0:11:59.16,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So these are just some of the kind of basic ideas

252
0:12:02.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
around design thinking

253
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and some of the new kinds of projects

254
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that they're being applied to.

255
0:12:09.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
But I'd like to go back to Brunel here,

256
0:12:11.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and suggest a connection that might explain why this is happening now,

257
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and maybe why design thinking is a useful tool.

258
0:12:20.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And that connection is change.

259
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:25,000
In times of change we need

260
0:12:25.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
new alternatives, new ideas.

261
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Now, Brunel worked at the height of the Industrial Revolution,

262
0:12:31.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
when all of life and our economy

263
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:35,000
was being reinvented.

264
0:12:35.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Now the industrial systems of Brunel's time have run their course,

265
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and indeed they are part of the problem today.

266
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:45,000
But, again, we are in the midst of massive change.

267
0:12:45.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And that change is forcing us to question

268
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
quite fundamental aspects of our society --

269
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:53,000
how we keep ourselves healthy, how we govern ourselves,

270
0:12:53.16,000 --> 0:12:57,000
how we educate ourselves, how we keep ourselves secure.

271
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
And in these times of change, we need these new choices

272
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:05,000
because our existing solutions are simply becoming obsolete.

273
0:13:05.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So why design thinking?

274
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Because it gives us a new way of tackling problems.

275
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Instead of defaulting to our normal convergent approach

276
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
where we make the best choice out of available alternatives,

277
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
it encourages us to take a divergent approach,

278
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:24,000
to explore new alternatives, new solutions,

279
0:13:24.16,000 --> 0:13:28,000
new ideas that have not existed before.

280
0:13:28.16,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But before we go through that process of divergence,

281
0:13:30.16,000 --> 0:13:33,000
there is actually quite an important first step.

282
0:13:33.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And that is, what is the question that we're trying to answer?

283
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
What's the design brief?

284
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Now Brunel may have asked a question like this,

285
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:44,000
"How do I take a train from London to New York?"

286
0:13:44.16,000 --> 0:13:48,000
But what are the kinds of questions that we might ask today?

287
0:13:48.16,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So these are some that we've been asked to think about recently.

288
0:13:54.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And one in particular, is one that we're working on with the Acumen Fund,

289
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
in a project that's been funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

290
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:04,000
How might we improve access to safe drinking water

291
0:14:04.16,000 --> 0:14:06,000
for the world's poorest people,

292
0:14:06.16,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and at the same time stimulate innovation

293
0:14:08.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
amongst local water providers?

294
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:14,000
So instead of having a bunch of American designers

295
0:14:14.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
come up with new ideas that may or may not have been appropriate,

296
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:21,000
we took a sort of more open, collaborative and participative approach.

297
0:14:21.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
We teamed designers and investment experts up with

298
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
11 water organizations across India.

299
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And through workshops they developed

300
0:14:29.16,000 --> 0:14:32,000
innovative new products, services, and business models.

301
0:14:32.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
We hosted a competition

302
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and then funded five of those organizations

303
0:14:36.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
to develop their ideas.

304
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:4,000
So they developed and iterated these ideas.

305
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And then IDEO and Acumen spent several weeks working with them

306
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
to help design new social marketing campaigns,

307
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
community outreach strategies, business models,

308
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
new water vessels for storing water

309
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:56,000
and carts for delivering water.

310
0:14:56.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
Some of those ideas are just getting launched into the market.

311
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
And the same process is just getting underway

312
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
with NGOs in East Africa.

313
0:15:03.16,000 --> 0:15:06,000
So for me, this project shows

314
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
kind of how far we can go from

315
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
some of those sort of small things

316
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that I was working on

317
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
at the beginning of my career.

318
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:18,000
That by focusing on the needs of humans

319
0:15:18.16,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and by using prototypes

320
0:15:20.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
to move ideas along quickly,

321
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
by getting the process out of the hands of designers,

322
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
and by getting the active participation of the community,

323
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
we can tackle bigger and more interesting questions.

324
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:34,000
And just like Brunel, by focusing on systems,

325
0:15:34.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
we can have a bigger impact.

326
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:4,000
So that's one thing that we've been working on.

327
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I'm actually really quite interested, and perhaps more interested

328
0:15:43.16,000 --> 0:15:47,000
to know what this community thinks we could work on.

329
0:15:47.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
What kinds of questions do we think

330
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:53,000
design thinking could be used to tackle?

331
0:15:53.16,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And if you've got any ideas

332
0:15:55.16,000 --> 0:15:57,000
then feel free, you can post them to Twitter.

333
0:15:57.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
There is a hash tag there that you can use, #CBDQ.

334
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And the list looked something like this a little while ago.

335
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And of course you can search to find the questions that you're interested in

336
0:16:07.16,000 --> 0:16:09,000
by using the same hash code.

337
0:16:09.16,000 --> 0:16:13,000
So I'd like to believe that design thinking

338
0:16:13.16,000 --> 0:16:15,000
actually can make a difference,

339
0:16:15.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
that it can help create new ideas

340
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and new innovations,

341
0:16:19.16,000 --> 0:16:21,000
beyond the latest High Street products.

342
0:16:21.16,000 --> 0:16:25,000
To do that I think we have to take a more expansive view of design,

343
0:16:25.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
more like Brunel, less a domain of a professional priesthood.

344
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And the first step is to start asking the right questions.

345
0:16:34.16,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Thank you very much.

346
0:16:36.16,000 --> 0:16:41,000
(Applause)

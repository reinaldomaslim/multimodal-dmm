1
0:00:12.625,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I am obsessed with forming healthy communities,

2
0:00:16.667,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and that's why I started Twitch --

3
0:00:18.958,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to help people watch other people play video games on the internet.

4
0:00:22.417,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:23.75,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

6
0:00:25.792,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:27.375,000 --> 0:00:28,000
So in seriousness,

8
0:00:29.083,000 --> 0:00:32,000
video games and communities truly are quite related.

9
0:00:33.625,000 --> 0:00:35,000
From our early human history,

10
0:00:36.458,000 --> 0:00:39,000
we made our entertainment together in small tribes.

11
0:00:40.042,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We shared stories around the campfire,

12
0:00:42.292,000 --> 0:00:44,000
we sang together, we danced together.

13
0:00:44.917,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Our earliest entertainment was both shared and interactive.

14
0:00:49.667,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It wasn't until pretty recently on the grand scale of human history

15
0:00:53.75,000 --> 0:00:55,000
that interactivity took a back seat

16
0:00:56.333,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and broadcast entertainment took over.

17
0:00:58.833,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Radio and records brought music into our vehicles, into our homes.

18
0:01:04.458,000 --> 0:01:09,000
TV and VHS brought sports and drama into our living rooms.

19
0:01:09.667,000 --> 0:01:13,000
This access to broadcast entertainment was unprecedented.

20
0:01:14.25,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It gave people amazing content around the globe.

21
0:01:17.875,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It created a shared culture for millions of people.

22
0:01:23.583,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And now, if you want to go watch or listen to Mozart,

23
0:01:27.75,000 --> 0:01:3,000
you don't have to buy an incredibly expensive ticket and find an orchestra.

24
0:01:32.667,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And if you like to sing --

25
0:01:34.292,000 --> 0:01:37,000
(Sings) I can show you the world --

26
0:01:37.542,000 --> 0:01:41,000
then you have something in common with people around the world.

27
0:01:44.542,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But with this amazing access,

28
0:01:46.5,000 --> 0:01:5,000
we allowed for a separation between creator and consumer,

29
0:01:51.917,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and the relationship between the two became much more one-way.

30
0:01:58.417,000 --> 0:02:03,000
We wound up in a world where we had a smaller class of professional creators

31
0:02:04.417,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and most of us became spectators,

32
0:02:08.25,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and as a result it became far easier for us to enjoy that content alone.

33
0:02:14.375,000 --> 0:02:15,000
There's a trend counteracting this:

34
0:02:16.125,000 --> 0:02:17,000
scarcity.

35
0:02:17.417,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So, Vienna in the 1900s, was famous for its café culture.

36
0:02:22.208,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And one of the big drivers of that café culture

37
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
was expensive newspapers that were hard to get,

38
0:02:29.458,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and as a result,

39
0:02:30.792,000 --> 0:02:33,000
people would go to the café and read the shared copy there.

40
0:02:34.417,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And once they're in the cafe,

41
0:02:35.875,000 --> 0:02:38,000
they meet the other people also reading the same newspaper,

42
0:02:39.042,000 --> 0:02:41,000
they converse, they exchange ideas

43
0:02:41.625,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and they form a community.

44
0:02:44.542,000 --> 0:02:45,000
In a similar way,

45
0:02:46.333,000 --> 0:02:48,000
TV and cable used to be more expensive,

46
0:02:49.083,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and so you might not watch the game at home.

47
0:02:51.917,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Instead you'd go to the local bar

48
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and cheer along with your fellow sports fans there.

49
0:02:57.458,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But as the price of media continues to fall over time thanks to technology,

50
0:03:03.458,000 --> 0:03:07,000
this shared necessity that used to bring our communities together falls away.

51
0:03:09.167,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We have so many amazing options for our entertainment,

52
0:03:14.167,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and yet it's easier than ever for us to wind up consuming those options alone.

53
0:03:21.125,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Our communities are bearing the consequences.

54
0:03:24.125,000 --> 0:03:25,000
For example,

55
0:03:25.417,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the number of people who report having at least two close friends

56
0:03:28.625,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is at an all-time low.

57
0:03:33.25,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I believe that one of the major contributing causes to this

58
0:03:38.125,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is that our entertainment today allows us to be separate.

59
0:03:45.708,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There is one trend reversing this atomization of our society:

60
0:03:50.125,000 --> 0:03:52,000
modern multiplayer video games.

61
0:03:54.375,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Games are like a shared campfire.

62
0:03:58.417,000 --> 0:04:,000
They're both interactive and connecting.

63
0:04:01.875,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now these campfires may have beautiful animations,

64
0:04:05.333,000 --> 0:04:06,000
heroic quests,

65
0:04:07,000 --> 0:04:09,000
occasionally too many loot boxes,

66
0:04:09.5,000 --> 0:04:11,000
but games today are very different

67
0:04:12.292,000 --> 0:04:14,000
than the solitary activity of 20 years ago.

68
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:17,000
They're deeply complex,

69
0:04:17.5,000 --> 0:04:18,000
they're more intellectually stimulating,

70
0:04:19.458,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and most of all, they're intrinsically social.

71
0:04:24.25,000 --> 0:04:27,000
One of the recent breakout genres exemplifying this change

72
0:04:27.542,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is the battle royale.

73
0:04:29.666,000 --> 0:04:34,000
100 people parachute onto an island in a last-man-standing competition.

74
0:04:35.125,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Think of it as being kind of like "American Idol,"

75
0:04:38.292,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but with a lot more fighting and a lot less Simon Cowell.

76
0:04:43.542,000 --> 0:04:44,000
You may have heard of "Fortnite,"

77
0:04:45.167,000 --> 0:04:48,000
which is a breakout example of the battle royale genre,

78
0:04:48.875,000 --> 0:04:52,000
which has been played by more than 250 million people around the world.

79
0:04:53.042,000 --> 0:04:55,000
It's everyone from kids in your neighborhood

80
0:04:55.167,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to Drake and Ellen DeGeneres.

81
0:04:57.542,000 --> 0:05:,000
2.3 billion people in the world play video games.

82
0:05:01.125,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Early games like "Tetris" and "Mario" may have been simple puzzles or quests,

83
0:05:06.167,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but with the rise of arcades and then internet play,

84
0:05:09.083,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and now massively multiplayer games of huge, thriving online communities,

85
0:05:13.625,000 --> 0:05:16,000
games have emerged as the one form of entertainment

86
0:05:16.917,000 --> 0:05:19,000
where consumption truly requires human connection.

87
0:05:21.667,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So this brings us to streaming.

88
0:05:23.958,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Why do people stream themselves playing video games?

89
0:05:27.417,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And why do hundreds of millions of people around the world

90
0:05:31.542,000 --> 0:05:32,000
congregate to watch them?

91
0:05:34.917,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I want you all the imagine for second --

92
0:05:37.542,000 --> 0:05:39,000
imagine you land on an alien planet,

93
0:05:40.083,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and on this planet, there's a giant green rectangle.

94
0:05:43.25,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And in this green rectangle,

95
0:05:45.125,000 --> 0:05:46,000
aliens in matching outfits

96
0:05:46.542,000 --> 0:05:48,000
are trying to push a checkered sphere between two posts

97
0:05:49.167,000 --> 0:05:5,000
using only their feet.

98
0:05:50.583,000 --> 0:05:51,000
It's pretty evenly matched,

99
0:05:51.917,000 --> 0:05:53,000
so the ball is just going back and forth,

100
0:05:54.75,000 --> 0:05:57,000
but there's hundreds of millions of people watching from home anyway,

101
0:05:58.583,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and cheering and getting excited and engaged right along with them.

102
0:06:02.583,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Now I grew up watching sports with my dad,

103
0:06:05.375,000 --> 0:06:09,000
so I get why soccer is entertaining and engaging.

104
0:06:09.458,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But if you don't watch sports,

105
0:06:12.375,000 --> 0:06:14,000
maybe you like watching "Dancing with the Stars"

106
0:06:15.208,000 --> 0:06:16,000
or you enjoy "Top Chef."

107
0:06:17.792,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Regardless, the principle is the same.

108
0:06:20.875,000 --> 0:06:22,000
If there is an activity that you really enjoy,

109
0:06:24.583,000 --> 0:06:26,000
you're probably going to like watching other people do it

110
0:06:27.417,000 --> 0:06:29,000
with skill and panache.

111
0:06:30.708,000 --> 0:06:32,000
It might be perplexing to an alien,

112
0:06:33.042,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but bonding over shared passion is a human universal.

113
0:06:36.708,000 --> 0:06:42,000
So gamers grew up expecting this live, interactive entertainment,

114
0:06:43.167,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and passive consumption just doesn't feel as fulfilling.

115
0:06:46.292,000 --> 0:06:49,000
That's why livestreaming has taken off with video games.

116
0:06:51.333,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Because livestreaming offers that same kind of interactive feeling.

117
0:06:59.167,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So when you imagine what's happening on Twitch,

118
0:07:03.333,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I don't want you to think of a million livestreams of video games.

119
0:07:09.583,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Instead, what I want you to picture is millions of campfires.

120
0:07:16.708,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Some of them are bonfires --

121
0:07:18.417,000 --> 0:07:22,000
huge, roaring bonfires with hundreds of thousands of people around them.

122
0:07:22.875,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Some of them are smaller, more intimate community gatherings

123
0:07:25.917,000 --> 0:07:26,000
where everyone knows your name.

124
0:07:28.458,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Let's try taking a seat by one of those campfires right now.

125
0:07:34.958,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Hey Cohh, how's it going?

126
0:07:36.667,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Cohh: Hey, how's it going, Emmett?

127
0:07:38.333,000 --> 0:07:41,000
ES: So I'm here at TED with about 1,000 of my closest friends,

128
0:07:41.792,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and we thought we'd come and join you guys for a little stream.

129
0:07:46.5,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Cohh: Awesome! It's great to hear from you guys.

130
0:07:48.917,000 --> 0:07:51,000
ES: So Cohh, can you share with the TED audience here --

131
0:07:52.333,000 --> 0:07:55,000
what have you learned about your community on Twitch?

132
0:07:56.25,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Cohh: Ah, man, where to begin?

133
0:07:58.292,000 --> 0:08:,000
I've been doing this for over five years now,

134
0:08:00.542,000 --> 0:08:05,000
and if there's one thing that doesn't cease to impress me on the daily,

135
0:08:05.667,000 --> 0:08:09,000
it's just kind of how incredible this whole thing is for communication.

136
0:08:09.833,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I've been playing games for 20 years of my life,

137
0:08:12.708,000 --> 0:08:14,000
I've led online MMO guilds for over 10,

138
0:08:15.708,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and it's the kind of thing where there's very few places in life

139
0:08:20.042,000 --> 0:08:23,000
where you can go to meet so many people with similar interests.

140
0:08:23.875,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I was listening in a bit earlier;

141
0:08:25.5,000 --> 0:08:27,000
I love the campfire analogy, I actually use a similar one.

142
0:08:28.292,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I see it all as a bunch of people on a big couch

143
0:08:30.583,000 --> 0:08:31,000
but only one person has the controller.

144
0:08:32.5,000 --> 0:08:34,000
So it's kind of like a "Pass the snack!" situation, you know?

145
0:08:35.417,000 --> 0:08:36,000
700 people that way --

146
0:08:36.75,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but it's great and really it's just --

147
0:08:39.542,000 --> 0:08:42,000
ES: So Cohh, what is going on in chat right now?

148
0:08:43.542,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Can you explain that a little bit to us?

149
0:08:45.5,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Because my eyesight isn't that good but I see a lot of emotes.

150
0:08:49.917,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Cohh: So this is my community; this is the Cohhilition.

151
0:08:52.625,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I stream every single day.

152
0:08:53.957,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I actually just wrapped up a 2,000-day challenge,

153
0:08:56.292,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and as such, we have developed a pretty incredible community

154
0:09:00.292,000 --> 0:09:01,000
here in the channel.

155
0:09:01.583,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Right now we have about 6200 people with us.

156
0:09:03.708,000 --> 0:09:06,000
What you're seeing is a spam of "Hello, TED" good-vibe emotes,

157
0:09:07.083,000 --> 0:09:09,000
love emotes,

158
0:09:09.125,000 --> 0:09:1,000
"this is awesome,"

159
0:09:10.417,000 --> 0:09:11,000
"Hi, guys," "Hi, everyone."

160
0:09:11.792,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Basically just a huge collection of people --

161
0:09:14.5,000 --> 0:09:15,000
huge collection of gamers

162
0:09:15.875,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that are all just experiencing a positive event together.

163
0:09:18.583,000 --> 0:09:21,000
ES: So is there anything that -- can we poll chat?

164
0:09:21.667,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I want ask chat a question.

165
0:09:23.5,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Is there anything that chat would like the world,

166
0:09:26.833,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and particularly these people here with me at TED right now,

167
0:09:29.708,000 --> 0:09:32,000
to know about what they get out of playing video games

168
0:09:33.625,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and being part of this community?

169
0:09:36.375,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Cohh: Oh, wow.

170
0:09:38.292,000 --> 0:09:4,000
I am already starting to see a lot of answers here.

171
0:09:42.958,000 --> 0:09:43,000
"I like the good vibes."

172
0:09:46.125,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"Best communities are on Twitch."

173
0:09:49.292,000 --> 0:09:5,000
(Laughter)

174
0:09:51.375,000 --> 0:09:53,000
"They get us through the rough patches in life."

175
0:09:54.833,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Oh, that's a message I definitely see a lot on Twitch,

176
0:09:57.625,000 --> 0:09:58,000
which is very good.

177
0:09:59.625,000 --> 0:10:,000
"A very positive community,"

178
0:10:01.25,000 --> 0:10:03,000
"a lot of positivity,"

179
0:10:03.75,000 --> 0:10:04,000
which is pretty great.

180
0:10:05.125,000 --> 0:10:09,000
ES: So Cohh, before I get back to my TED talk,

181
0:10:09.375,000 --> 0:10:12,000
which I actually should probably get back to doing at some point --

182
0:10:12.583,000 --> 0:10:13,000
(Laughter)

183
0:10:13.875,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Do you have anything else that you want to share with me

184
0:10:16.542,000 --> 0:10:17,000
or any question you wanted to ask,

185
0:10:18.208,000 --> 0:10:21,000
you've always wanted to get out there before an audience?

186
0:10:21.625,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Cohh: Honestly, not too much.

187
0:10:23.375,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I mean, I absolutely love what you're doing right now.

188
0:10:25.958,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I think that the interactive streaming

189
0:10:27.833,000 --> 0:10:3,000
is the big unexplored frontier of the future in entertainment,

190
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and thank you for doing everything you're doing up there.

191
0:10:33.75,000 --> 0:10:35,000
The more people that hear about what you do, the better --

192
0:10:36.542,000 --> 0:10:37,000
for everyone on here.

193
0:10:37.875,000 --> 0:10:38,000
ES: Awesome, Cohh. Thanks so much.

194
0:10:39.519,000 --> 0:10:41,000
I'm going to get back to giving this talk now,

195
0:10:41.708,000 --> 0:10:42,000
but we should catch up later.

196
0:10:43.167,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Cohh: Sounds great!

197
0:10:44.458,000 --> 0:10:46,000
(Applause)

198
0:10:48.958,000 --> 0:10:5,000
ES: So that was a new way to interact.

199
0:10:52.083,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We could influence what happened on the stream,

200
0:10:55.5,000 --> 0:10:57,000
we could cocreate the experience along with him,

201
0:11:00.917,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and we really had a multiplayer experience with chat and with Cohh.

202
0:11:07.333,000 --> 0:11:09,000
At Twitch, we've started calling this,

203
0:11:1,000 --> 0:11:13,000
as a result, "multiplayer entertainment."

204
0:11:14.333,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Because going from watching a video alone to watching a live interactive stream

205
0:11:20.625,000 --> 0:11:26,000
is similar to the difference between going from playing a single-player game

206
0:11:26.667,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to playing a multiplayer game.

207
0:11:30.667,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Gamers are often as the forefront of exploration in new technology.

208
0:11:37.833,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Microcomputers, for example, were used early on for video games,

209
0:11:43.333,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and the very first handheld, digital mass-market devices weren't cell phones,

210
0:11:49.917,000 --> 0:11:5,000
they were Gameboys ...

211
0:11:51.667,000 --> 0:11:52,000
for video games.

212
0:11:53.292,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And as a result,

213
0:11:56.417,000 --> 0:12:01,000
one way that you can get a hint of what the future might hold

214
0:12:01.792,000 --> 0:12:05,000
is to look to this fun, interactive sandbox of video games

215
0:12:06.208,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and ask yourself,

216
0:12:08.292,000 --> 0:12:09,000
"what are these gamers doing today?"

217
0:12:10.292,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And that might give you a hint as to what the future is going to hold

218
0:12:13.583,000 --> 0:12:14,000
for all of us.

219
0:12:16.25,000 --> 0:12:18,000
One of the things we're already seeing on Twitch

220
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:21,000
is multiplayer entertainment coming to sports.

221
0:12:21.75,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So, Twitch and the NFL teamed up to offer livestreaming football,

222
0:12:26.792,000 --> 0:12:29,000
but instead of network announcers in suits streaming the game,

223
0:12:30.792,000 --> 0:12:32,000
we got Twitch users to come in

224
0:12:33.5,000 --> 0:12:35,000
and stream it themselves on their own channel

225
0:12:36.25,000 --> 0:12:38,000
and interact with their community

226
0:12:38.667,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and make it a real multiplayer experience.

227
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So I actually think that if you look out into the future --

228
0:12:47.458,000 --> 0:12:51,000
only hundreds of people today get to be sports announcers.

229
0:12:53.458,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It's a tiny, tiny number of people who have that opportunity.

230
0:12:56.5,000 --> 0:12:59,000
But sports are about to go multiplayer,

231
0:13:00.458,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and that means that anyone who wants to around the world

232
0:13:03.333,000 --> 0:13:07,000
is going to get the opportunity to become a sports announcer,

233
0:13:08.083,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to give it a shot.

234
0:13:09.625,000 --> 0:13:12,000
And I think that's going to unlock incredible amounts of new talent

235
0:13:12.833,000 --> 0:13:13,000
for all of us.

236
0:13:14.125,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And we're not going to be asking, "Did you catch the game?"

237
0:13:17.125,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Instead, we're going to be asking,

238
0:13:19.083,000 --> 0:13:22,000
"Whose channel did you catch the game on?"

239
0:13:24.25,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We already see this happening with cooking, with singing --

240
0:13:28.958,000 --> 0:13:3,000
we even see people streaming welding.

241
0:13:32.292,000 --> 0:13:36,000
And all of this stuff is going to happen around the metaphorical campfire.

242
0:13:37.667,000 --> 0:13:39,000
There's going to be millions of these campfires lit

243
0:13:40.208,000 --> 0:13:41,000
over the next few years.

244
0:13:41.792,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And on every topic,

245
0:13:45.042,000 --> 0:13:47,000
you're going to be able to find a campfire

246
0:13:47.125,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that will allow you to bond with your people around the world.

247
0:13:51.167,000 --> 0:13:52,000
For most of human history,

248
0:13:52.708,000 --> 0:13:54,000
entertainment was simply multiplayer.

249
0:13:55.542,000 --> 0:13:57,000
We sang together in person,

250
0:13:58.125,000 --> 0:14:01,000
we shared news together in the town square in person,

251
0:14:02.125,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and somewhere along the way,

252
0:14:04.625,000 --> 0:14:09,000
that two-way conversation turned into a one-way transmission.

253
0:14:10.625,000 --> 0:14:12,000
As someone who cares about communities,

254
0:14:12.917,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I am excited for a world

255
0:14:14.833,000 --> 0:14:18,000
where our entertainment could connect us instead of isolating us.

256
0:14:21.708,000 --> 0:14:25,000
A world where we can bond with each other over our shared interests

257
0:14:26.542,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and create real, strong communities.

258
0:14:30.458,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Games, streams and the interactions they encourage,

259
0:14:33.708,000 --> 0:14:37,000
are only just beginning to turn the wheel back

260
0:14:37.917,000 --> 0:14:41,000
to our interactive, community-rich, multiplayer past.

261
0:14:43.042,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Thank you all for sharing this experience here with me,

262
0:14:46.042,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and may you all find your best campfire.

263
0:14:48.583,000 --> 0:14:5,000
(Applause)

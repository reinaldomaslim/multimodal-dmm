1
0:00:12.988,000 --> 0:00:16,000
These dragons from deep time are incredible creatures.

2
0:00:17.701,000 --> 0:00:18,000
They're bizzarre,

3
0:00:19.146,000 --> 0:00:2,000
they're beautiful,

4
0:00:20.856,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and there's very little we know about them.

5
0:00:23.841,000 --> 0:00:25,000
These thoughts were going through my head

6
0:00:26.131,000 --> 0:00:3,000
when I looked at the pages of my first dinosaur book.

7
0:00:30.574,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I was about five years old at the time,

8
0:00:33.078,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I decided there and then

9
0:00:35.031,000 --> 0:00:37,000
that I would become a paleontologist.

10
0:00:37.876,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Paleontology allowed me to combine my love for animals

11
0:00:41.213,000 --> 0:00:45,000
with my desire to travel to far-flung corners of the world.

12
0:00:45.941,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And now, a few years later, I've led several expeditions

13
0:00:48.964,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to the ultimate far-flung corner on this planet, the Sahara.

14
0:00:54.146,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I've worked in the Sahara because I've been on a quest

15
0:00:58.195,000 --> 0:01:03,000
to uncover new remains of a bizarre, giant predatory dinosaur

16
0:01:03.3,000 --> 0:01:06,000
called Spinosaurus.

17
0:01:06.451,000 --> 0:01:09,000
A few bones of this animal have been found

18
0:01:09.804,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in the deserts of Egypt

19
0:01:11.184,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and were described about 100 years ago by a German paleontologist.

20
0:01:16.537,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Unfortunately, all his Spinosaurus bones were destroyed in World War II.

21
0:01:21.485,000 --> 0:01:25,000
So all we're left with are just a few drawings and notes.

22
0:01:25.789,000 --> 0:01:26,000
From these drawings,

23
0:01:27.05,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we know that this creature, which lived about 100 million years ago,

24
0:01:30.461,000 --> 0:01:31,000
was very big,

25
0:01:32.012,000 --> 0:01:35,000
it had tall spines on its back, forming a magnificent sail,

26
0:01:35.425,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and it had long, slender jaws, a bit like a crocodile,

27
0:01:41.542,000 --> 0:01:43,000
with conical teeth,

28
0:01:43.76,000 --> 0:01:47,000
that may have been used to catch slippery prey, like fish.

29
0:01:48.647,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But that was pretty much all we knew

30
0:01:50.704,000 --> 0:01:53,000
about this animal for the next 100 years.

31
0:01:58.563,000 --> 0:02:02,000
My fieldwork took me to the border region between Morocco and Algeria,

32
0:02:03.365,000 --> 0:02:05,000
a place called the Kem Kem.

33
0:02:05.938,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It's a difficult place to work in.

34
0:02:08.251,000 --> 0:02:11,000
You have to deal with sandstorms and snakes and scorpions,

35
0:02:11.94,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and it's very difficult to find good fossils there.

36
0:02:15.084,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But our hard work paid off.

37
0:02:17.9,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We discovered many incredible specimens.

38
0:02:20.115,000 --> 0:02:21,000
There's the largest dinosaur bone

39
0:02:21.867,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that had ever been found in this part of the Sahara.

40
0:02:25.475,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We found remains of giant predatory dinosaurs,

41
0:02:28.969,000 --> 0:02:3,000
medium-sized predatory dinosaurs,

42
0:02:31.632,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and seven or eight different kinds of crocodile-like hunters.

43
0:02:37.231,000 --> 0:02:4,000
These fossils were deposited in a river system.

44
0:02:40.233,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The river system was also home to a giant, car-sized coelacanth,

45
0:02:44.403,000 --> 0:02:47,000
a monster sawfish,

46
0:02:47.863,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and the skies over the river system were filled with pterosaurs,

47
0:02:51.563,000 --> 0:02:53,000
flying reptiles.

48
0:02:53.591,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It was a pretty dangerous place,

49
0:02:55.21,000 --> 0:02:58,000
not the kind of place where you'd want to travel to if you had a time machine.

50
0:03:00.159,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So we're finding all these incredible fossils of animals

51
0:03:03.079,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that lived alongside Spinosaurus,

52
0:03:05.769,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but Spinosaurus itself proved to be very elusive.

53
0:03:08.538,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We were just finding bits and pieces

54
0:03:10.285,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and I was hoping that we'd find a partial skeleton at some point.

55
0:03:15.64,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Finally, very recently,

56
0:03:17.357,000 --> 0:03:2,000
we were able to track down a dig site

57
0:03:20.467,000 --> 0:03:24,000
where a local fossil hunter found several bones of Spinosaurus.

58
0:03:25.431,000 --> 0:03:27,000
We returned to the site, we collected more bones.

59
0:03:28.291,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And so after 100 years we finally had another partial skeleton

60
0:03:32.364,000 --> 0:03:34,000
of this bizarre creature.

61
0:03:34.525,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And we were able to reconstruct it.

62
0:03:36.196,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We now know that Spinosaurus had a head

63
0:03:38.09,000 --> 0:03:39,000
a little bit like a crocodile,

64
0:03:39.886,000 --> 0:03:41,000
very different from other predatory dinosaurs,

65
0:03:42.081,000 --> 0:03:44,000
very different from the T. rex.

66
0:03:44.818,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But the really interesting information came from the rest of the skeleton.

67
0:03:49.671,000 --> 0:03:5,000
We had long spines,

68
0:03:51.004,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the spines forming the big sail.

69
0:03:53.632,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We had leg bones, we had skull bones,

70
0:03:55.877,000 --> 0:03:58,000
we had paddle-shaped feet, wide feet --

71
0:03:59.325,000 --> 0:04:01,000
again, very unusual, no other dinosaur has feet like this --

72
0:04:02.14,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and we think they may have been used to walk on soft sediment,

73
0:04:05.251,000 --> 0:04:07,000
or maybe for paddling in the water.

74
0:04:07.943,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We also looked at the fine microstructure of the bone,

75
0:04:11.381,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the inside structure of Spinosaurus bones,

76
0:04:13.377,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and it turns out that they're very dense and compact.

77
0:04:16.136,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Again, this is something we see in animals that spend a lot of time in the water,

78
0:04:19.994,000 --> 0:04:22,000
it's useful for buoyancy control in the water.

79
0:04:23.186,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We C.T.-scanned all of our bones and built a digital Spinosaurus skeleton.

80
0:04:28.559,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And when we looked at the digital skeleton,

81
0:04:30.77,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we realized that yes, this was a dinosaur unlike any other.

82
0:04:35.206,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It's bigger than a T. rex,

83
0:04:36.805,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and yes, the head has "fish-eating" written all over it,

84
0:04:39.53,000 --> 0:04:43,000
but really the entire skeleton has "water-loving" written all over it --

85
0:04:43.629,000 --> 0:04:47,000
dense bone, paddle-like feet, and the hind limbs are reduced in size,

86
0:04:48.464,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and again, this is something we see in animals

87
0:04:50.672,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that spend a substantial amount of time in the water.

88
0:04:54.711,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So, as we fleshed out our Spinosaurus --

89
0:04:58.104,000 --> 0:05:02,000
I'm looking at muscle attachments and wrapping our dinosaur in skin --

90
0:05:02.268,000 --> 0:05:05,000
we realize that we're dealing with a river monster,

91
0:05:06.148,000 --> 0:05:08,000
a predatory dinosaur, bigger than T. rex,

92
0:05:08.477,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the ruler of this ancient river of giants,

93
0:05:11.253,000 --> 0:05:14,000
feeding on the many aquatic animals I showed you earlier on.

94
0:05:14.503,000 --> 0:05:16,000
So that's really what makes this an incredible discovery.

95
0:05:17.369,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It's a dinosaur like no other.

96
0:05:18.874,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And some people told me, "Wow, this is a once-in-a-lifetime discovery.

97
0:05:22.441,000 --> 0:05:25,000
There are not many things left to discover in the world."

98
0:05:26.803,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Well, I think nothing could be further from the truth.

99
0:05:29.975,000 --> 0:05:31,000
I think the Sahara's still full of treasures,

100
0:05:32.246,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and when people tell me there are no places left to explore,

101
0:05:35.431,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I like to quote a famous dinosaur hunter, Roy Chapman Andrews,

102
0:05:39.468,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and he said, "Always, there has been an adventure just around the corner --

103
0:05:45.084,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and the world is still full of corners."

104
0:05:47.896,000 --> 0:05:48,000
That was true many decades ago

105
0:05:49.815,000 --> 0:05:51,000
when Roy Chapman Andrews wrote these lines.

106
0:05:51.857,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And it is still true today.

107
0:05:53.839,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Thank you.

108
0:05:54.727,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Applause)

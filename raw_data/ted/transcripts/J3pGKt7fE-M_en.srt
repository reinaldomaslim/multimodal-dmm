1
0:00:12.936,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It's 4am in the morning.

2
0:00:16.159,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm waking up in a Boston hotel room

3
0:00:18.603,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and can only think of one thing:

4
0:00:21.992,000 --> 0:00:22,000
tooth pain.

5
0:00:24.061,000 --> 0:00:26,000
One of my ceramic inlays fell off the evening before.

6
0:00:27.592,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Five hours later, I'm sitting in a dentist's chair.

7
0:00:31.719,000 --> 0:00:35,000
But instead of having a repair of my inlay so that I can get rid of my pain,

8
0:00:36.363,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the dentist pitches me on the advantages of a titanium implant surgery.

9
0:00:42.647,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Ever heard of that?

10
0:00:43.915,000 --> 0:00:44,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:45.3,000 --> 0:00:48,000
It essentially means to replace a damaged tooth

12
0:00:49.045,000 --> 0:00:5,000
by an artificial one,

13
0:00:50.78,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that is screwed into your jaw.

14
0:00:53.934,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Estimated costs for the implant surgery may add up to 10,000 US dollars.

15
0:00:59.513,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Replacing the ceramic inlay I had before

16
0:01:02.117,000 --> 0:01:03,000
would come in at 100 US dollars.

17
0:01:06.2,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Was it my health or the money that could be earned with me

18
0:01:10.041,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that was the biggest concern for my dentist?

19
0:01:13.966,000 --> 0:01:16,000
As it turned out, my experience wasn't an isolated case.

20
0:01:18.419,000 --> 0:01:23,000
A study by a US national newspaper estimated that in the United States,

21
0:01:24.235,000 --> 0:01:27,000
up to 30 percent of all surgical procedures --

22
0:01:27.561,000 --> 0:01:3,000
including stent and pacemaker implantations,

23
0:01:31.141,000 --> 0:01:34,000
hip replacements and uterus removals --

24
0:01:34.501,000 --> 0:01:35,000
were conducted

25
0:01:35.676,000 --> 0:01:39,000
although other nonsurgical treatment options had not been fully exploited

26
0:01:39.873,000 --> 0:01:4,000
by the physician in charge.

27
0:01:43.32,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Isn't that figure shocking?

28
0:01:45.914,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Numbers may be slightly different in other countries,

29
0:01:48.459,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but what it means is that if you go to a doctor in the US,

30
0:01:52.292,000 --> 0:01:56,000
you have a not-insignificant chance to be subjected to a surgical intervention

31
0:01:57.188,000 --> 0:01:59,000
without there being an immediate need for it.

32
0:02:00.632,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Why is this?

33
0:02:02.831,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Why are some practitioners incentivized to run such unnecessary procedures?

34
0:02:09.243,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Well, perhaps it is because health care systems themselves

35
0:02:14.538,000 --> 0:02:16,000
incentivize in a nonideal way

36
0:02:17.157,000 --> 0:02:2,000
towards applying or not applying certain procedures or treatments.

37
0:02:21.721,000 --> 0:02:23,000
As most health care systems reimburse practitioners

38
0:02:24.586,000 --> 0:02:26,000
in a fee-for-service-based fashion

39
0:02:27.102,000 --> 0:02:3,000
on the number and kind of treatments performed,

40
0:02:30.8,000 --> 0:02:33,000
it may be this economic incentive that tempts some practitioners

41
0:02:34.464,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to rather perform high-profit surgical treatments

42
0:02:37.051,000 --> 0:02:39,000
instead of exploring other treatment options.

43
0:02:40.903,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Although certain countries started to implement

44
0:02:43.187,000 --> 0:02:45,000
performance-based reimbursement,

45
0:02:45.236,000 --> 0:02:47,000
anchored on a quality and efficacy matrix,

46
0:02:48.855,000 --> 0:02:51,000
overall, there's very little in today's health care systems' architecture

47
0:02:52.848,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to incentivize practitioners broadly

48
0:02:54.956,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to actively prevent the appearance of a disease in the first place

49
0:02:58.572,000 --> 0:03:,000
and to limit the procedures applied to a patient

50
0:03:01.158,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to the most effective options.

51
0:03:03.993,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So how do we fix this?

52
0:03:07.452,000 --> 0:03:09,000
What it may take is a fundamental redesign

53
0:03:10.233,000 --> 0:03:12,000
of our health care system's architecture --

54
0:03:12.429,000 --> 0:03:14,000
a complete rethinking of the incentive structure.

55
0:03:16.49,000 --> 0:03:17,000
What we may need is a health care system

56
0:03:18.482,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that reimburses practitioners for keeping their customers healthy

57
0:03:22.569,000 --> 0:03:26,000
instead of almost only paying for services once people are already sick.

58
0:03:28.284,000 --> 0:03:3,000
What we may need is a transformation

59
0:03:31.261,000 --> 0:03:33,000
from today's system that largely cares for the sick,

60
0:03:34.903,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to a system that cares for the healthy.

61
0:03:38.545,000 --> 0:03:4,000
To change our current "sick care" approach

62
0:03:41.45,000 --> 0:03:43,000
into a true "health care" approach.

63
0:03:44.784,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It is a paradigm shift from treating people once they have become sick

64
0:03:49.411,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to preserving the health of the healthy before they get sick.

65
0:03:53.831,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This shift may move the focus of all those involved --

66
0:03:57.546,000 --> 0:04:01,000
from doctors, to hospitals, to pharmaceutical and medical companies --

67
0:04:02.427,000 --> 0:04:05,000
on the product that this industry ultimately sells:

68
0:04:07.006,000 --> 0:04:08,000
health.

69
0:04:09.887,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Imagine the following.

70
0:04:12.139,000 --> 0:04:14,000
What if we redesign our health care system

71
0:04:15.154,000 --> 0:04:17,000
into one that does not reimburse practitioners

72
0:04:18.036,000 --> 0:04:2,000
for the actual procedures performed on a patient

73
0:04:20.861,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but rather reimburses doctors, hospitals,

74
0:04:23.911,000 --> 0:04:25,000
pharmaceutical and medical companies

75
0:04:26.093,000 --> 0:04:28,000
for every day a single individual is kept healthy

76
0:04:29.11,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and doesn't develop a disease?

77
0:04:31.56,000 --> 0:04:33,000
In practical terms, we could, for example,

78
0:04:34.212,000 --> 0:04:38,000
use public money to pay a health fee to an insurance company

79
0:04:38.553,000 --> 0:04:4,000
for every day a single individual is kept healthy

80
0:04:41.08,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and doesn't develop a disease

81
0:04:42.576,000 --> 0:04:45,000
or doesn't require any other form of acute medical intervention.

82
0:04:47.188,000 --> 0:04:49,000
If the individual becomes sick,

83
0:04:49.323,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the insurance company will not receive any further monetary compensation

84
0:04:54.061,000 --> 0:04:58,000
for the medical interventions required to treat the disease of that individual,

85
0:04:58.204,000 --> 0:05:02,000
but they would be obliged to pay for every evidence-based treatment option

86
0:05:02.276,000 --> 0:05:04,000
to return the customer back to health.

87
0:05:05.825,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Once the customer's healthy again,

88
0:05:07.977,000 --> 0:05:1,000
the health fee for that individual will be paid again.

89
0:05:11.707,000 --> 0:05:13,000
In effect, all players in the system

90
0:05:14.252,000 --> 0:05:17,000
are now responsible for keeping their customers healthy,

91
0:05:17.776,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and they're incentivized to avoid any unnecessary medical interventions

92
0:05:22.173,000 --> 0:05:26,000
by simply reducing the number of people that eventually become sick.

93
0:05:28.743,000 --> 0:05:3,000
The more healthy people there are,

94
0:05:31.927,000 --> 0:05:33,000
the less the cost to treat the sick will be,

95
0:05:35.315,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and the higher the economic benefit for all parties being involved

96
0:05:39.323,000 --> 0:05:41,000
in keeping these individuals healthy is.

97
0:05:43.323,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This change of the incentive structure shifts, now,

98
0:05:45.967,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the attention of the complete health care system

99
0:05:48.252,000 --> 0:05:52,000
away from providing isolated and singular treatment options,

100
0:05:52.53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
towards a holistic view of what is useful

101
0:05:55.8,000 --> 0:05:58,000
for an individual to stay healthy and live long.

102
0:06:00.545,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Now, to effectively preserve health,

103
0:06:04.45,000 --> 0:06:07,000
people will need to be willing to share their health data

104
0:06:07.617,000 --> 0:06:08,000
on a constant basis,

105
0:06:09.149,000 --> 0:06:12,000
so that the health care system understands early enough

106
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
if any assistance with regard to their health is needed.

107
0:06:16.458,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Physical examination,

108
0:06:18.323,000 --> 0:06:2,000
monitoring of lifetime health data

109
0:06:20.68,000 --> 0:06:24,000
as well as genetic sequencing, cardiometabolic profiling

110
0:06:25.006,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and imaging-based technologies

111
0:06:27.03,000 --> 0:06:28,000
will allow customers to make,

112
0:06:28.648,000 --> 0:06:31,000
together with health coaches and general practitioners,

113
0:06:32.053,000 --> 0:06:34,000
optimal and science-guided decisions --

114
0:06:34.847,000 --> 0:06:38,000
for their diet, their medication and their physical activity --

115
0:06:39.085,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to diminish their unique probability

116
0:06:41.693,000 --> 0:06:45,000
to fall sick of an identified, individual high-risk disease.

117
0:06:47.283,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Artificial intelligence-based data analysis

118
0:06:49.562,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and the miniaturization of sensor technologies

119
0:06:51.736,000 --> 0:06:55,000
are already starting to make monitoring of the individual health status possible.

120
0:06:57.118,000 --> 0:07:,000
Measuring cardiometabolic parameters by devices like this

121
0:07:01.076,000 --> 0:07:04,000
or the detection of circulating tumor DNA in your bloodstream

122
0:07:04.673,000 --> 0:07:06,000
early on after cancer disease onset

123
0:07:07.022,000 --> 0:07:09,000
are only two examples for such monitoring technologies.

124
0:07:11.084,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Take cancer.

125
0:07:13.108,000 --> 0:07:16,000
One of the biggest problems in certain oncological diseases

126
0:07:16.512,000 --> 0:07:2,000
is that a large number of patients is diagnosed too late

127
0:07:20.839,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to allow them to be cured,

128
0:07:22.49,000 --> 0:07:25,000
although the drugs and treatments that could potentially have cured them

129
0:07:25.903,000 --> 0:07:26,000
are already existing today,

130
0:07:27.744,000 --> 0:07:29,000
if the disease had only been detected earlier.

131
0:07:31.109,000 --> 0:07:34,000
New technologies allow now, based on a few milliliters of blood,

132
0:07:35.109,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to detect the presence of circulating tumor DNA

133
0:07:37.923,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and thus, the presence of cancer,

134
0:07:39.665,000 --> 0:07:41,000
early on in a really convenient manner.

135
0:07:42.736,000 --> 0:07:44,000
The impact that this early-stage detection can have

136
0:07:46.3,000 --> 0:07:47,000
may be dramatic.

137
0:07:48.893,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The five-year survival rate for non-small cell lung cancer

138
0:07:52.57,000 --> 0:07:56,000
when diagnosed at stage one, which is early, is 49 percent.

139
0:07:58.792,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The same, when diagnosed at stage four, which is late,

140
0:08:03.206,000 --> 0:08:04,000
is below one percent.

141
0:08:06.093,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Being potentially able to prevent a large number of deaths

142
0:08:10.22,000 --> 0:08:15,000
by something as simple as a blood test for circulating tumor DNA

143
0:08:15.684,000 --> 0:08:17,000
could make certain cancer types a manageable disease,

144
0:08:18.561,000 --> 0:08:2,000
as disease onset can be detected earlier

145
0:08:21.403,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and positive treatment outcomes can likely be increased.

146
0:08:27.593,000 --> 0:08:28,000
In 2012,

147
0:08:30.124,000 --> 0:08:34,000
50 percent of all Americans had a single chronic disease,

148
0:08:34.784,000 --> 0:08:39,000
resulting in 86 percent of the $3 trillion US health care budget

149
0:08:40.196,000 --> 0:08:42,000
being spent for treating such chronic diseases.

150
0:08:44.03,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Eighty-six percent.

151
0:08:48.919,000 --> 0:08:52,000
If new technologies allow now to reduce this 86 percent,

152
0:08:53.39,000 --> 0:08:56,000
why have health care systems not reacted and changed already?

153
0:08:58.159,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Well, a redesign of what today is a sick care system

154
0:09:03.758,000 --> 0:09:06,000
into a true health care system that focuses on prevention

155
0:09:07.72,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and behavioral changes

156
0:09:08.91,000 --> 0:09:1,000
requires every actor in the system to change.

157
0:09:12.521,000 --> 0:09:15,000
It requires the political willingness to shift budgets and policies

158
0:09:16.096,000 --> 0:09:18,000
towards prevention and health education

159
0:09:18.418,000 --> 0:09:21,000
to design a new set of financial and non-financial incentives.

160
0:09:22.902,000 --> 0:09:24,000
It requires creating a regulatory framework

161
0:09:25.578,000 --> 0:09:29,000
for the gathering, using and sharing of personal health data

162
0:09:30.022,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that's at the same time stringent and sensible.

163
0:09:33.157,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It needs doctors, hospitals, insurers, pharmaceutical and medical companies

164
0:09:37.974,000 --> 0:09:4,000
to reframe their approach and, most important,

165
0:09:41.919,000 --> 0:09:44,000
it can't happen without the willingness and motivation

166
0:09:45.053,000 --> 0:09:49,000
of individuals to change their lifestyle in a sustained way,

167
0:09:49.581,000 --> 0:09:51,000
to prioritize staying healthy,

168
0:09:51.748,000 --> 0:09:55,000
in addition to opening up for sharing the health data on a constant basis.

169
0:09:56.668,000 --> 0:09:58,000
This change may not come overnight.

170
0:09:58.815,000 --> 0:10:02,000
But by refocusing the incentives within the health care industry today

171
0:10:03.419,000 --> 0:10:05,000
to actively keep people healthy,

172
0:10:05.982,000 --> 0:10:08,000
we may not only be able to prevent more diseases in the first place

173
0:10:09.887,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but we may also be able to detect the onset of certain preventable diseases

174
0:10:13.532,000 --> 0:10:14,000
earlier than we do today,

175
0:10:15.3,000 --> 0:10:18,000
which will lead to longer and healthier lives for more people.

176
0:10:20.136,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Most of the technologies that we need to initiate that change

177
0:10:23.03,000 --> 0:10:24,000
are already existing today.

178
0:10:25.327,000 --> 0:10:27,000
But this is not a technology question.

179
0:10:27.736,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It is primarily a question of vision

180
0:10:31.156,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and will.

181
0:10:33.5,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Thanks a lot.

182
0:10:34.675,000 --> 0:10:38,000

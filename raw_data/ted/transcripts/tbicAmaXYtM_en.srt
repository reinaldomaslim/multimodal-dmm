0:00:13.8,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Mia Birdsong: Why is Black Lives Matter important for the US right now

2
0:00:18.4,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and in the world?

3
0:00:20.56,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Patrisse Cullors: Black Lives Matter is our call to action.

4
0:00:24.44,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It is a tool to reimagine a world

5
0:00:28.72,000 --> 0:00:31,000
where black people are free to exist,

6
0:00:31.96,000 --> 0:00:32,000
free to live.

7
0:00:33.92,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It is a tool for our allies to show up differently for us.

8
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I grew up in a neighborhood that was heavily policed.

9
0:00:42.48,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I witnessed my brothers and my siblings

10
0:00:46.2,000 --> 0:00:49,000
continuously stopped and frisked by law enforcement.

11
0:00:49.96,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I remember my home being raided.

12
0:00:52.52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And one of my questions as a child was, why?

13
0:00:56.44,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Why us?

14
0:00:58.36,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Black Lives Matter offers answers to the why.

15
0:01:03.6,000 --> 0:01:08,000
It offers a new vision for young black girls around the world

16
0:01:09.4,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that we deserve to be fought for,

17
0:01:12.36,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that we deserve to call on local governments to show up for us.

18
0:01:19.36,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Opal Tometi: And antiblack racism --

19
0:01:21.12,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Applause)

20
0:01:24.36,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And antiblack racism is not only happening in the United States.

21
0:01:28.4,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's actually happening all across the globe.

22
0:01:31.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And what we need now more than ever is a human rights movement

23
0:01:35.32,000 --> 0:01:39,000
that challenges systemic racism in every single context.

24
0:01:40.2,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Applause)

25
0:01:44.24,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We need this because the global reality

26
0:01:47.8,000 --> 0:01:52,000
is that black people are subject to all sorts of disparities

27
0:01:53.24,000 --> 0:01:56,000
in most of our most challenging issues of our day.

28
0:01:57.04,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I think about issues like climate change,

29
0:01:59.84,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and how six of the 10 worst impacted nations by climate change

30
0:02:05.36,000 --> 0:02:07,000
are actually on the continent of Africa.

31
0:02:09.08,000 --> 0:02:13,000
People are reeling from all sorts of unnatural disasters,

32
0:02:13.8,000 --> 0:02:15,000
displacing them from their ancestral homes

33
0:02:16.64,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and leaving them without a chance at making a decent living.

34
0:02:20.84,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We also see disasters like Hurricane Matthew,

35
0:02:24.92,000 --> 0:02:27,000
which recently wreaked havoc in many different nations,

36
0:02:28.48,000 --> 0:02:3,000
but caused the most damage to Haiti.

37
0:02:31.8,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Haiti is the poorest country in this hemisphere,

38
0:02:36.04,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and its inhabitants are black people.

39
0:02:39.88,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And what we're seeing in Haiti

40
0:02:41.76,000 --> 0:02:44,000
is that they were actually facing a number of challenges

41
0:02:44.96,000 --> 0:02:46,000
that even preceded this hurricane.

42
0:02:47.68,000 --> 0:02:48,000
They were reeling from the earthquake,

43
0:02:49.56,000 --> 0:02:53,000
they were reeling from cholera that was brought in by UN peacekeepers

44
0:02:53.76,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and still hasn't been eradicated.

45
0:02:56.56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
This is unconscionable.

46
0:02:58.72,000 --> 0:03:03,000
And this would not happen if this nation didn't have a population that was black,

47
0:03:04.64,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and we have to be real about that.

48
0:03:07.04,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But what's most heartening right now

49
0:03:09.24,000 --> 0:03:11,000
is that despite these challenges,

50
0:03:11.44,000 --> 0:03:13,000
what we're seeing is that there's a network of Africans

51
0:03:14.44,000 --> 0:03:15,000
all across the continent

52
0:03:16.08,000 --> 0:03:2,000
who are rising up and fighting back and demanding climate justice.

53
0:03:20.28,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Applause)

54
0:03:23.84,000 --> 0:03:24,000
MB: So Alicia,

55
0:03:25.08,000 --> 0:03:27,000
you've said that when black people are free,

56
0:03:27.88,000 --> 0:03:28,000
everyone is free.

57
0:03:29.84,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Can you talk about what that means?

58
0:03:31.56,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Alicia Garza: Sure.

59
0:03:32.8,000 --> 0:03:35,000
So I think race and racism is probably the most studied

60
0:03:36.76,000 --> 0:03:39,000
social, economic and political phenomenon in this country,

61
0:03:40.68,000 --> 0:03:43,000
but it's also the least understood.

62
0:03:43.84,000 --> 0:03:45,000
The reality is that race in the United States

63
0:03:46.64,000 --> 0:03:48,000
operates on a spectrum from black to white.

64
0:03:49.6,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Doesn't mean that people who are in between don't experience racism,

65
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:57,000
but it means that the closer you are to white on that spectrum,

66
0:03:57.88,000 --> 0:03:58,000
the better off you are.

67
0:03:59.2,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And the closer to black that you are on that spectrum

68
0:04:02.2,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the worse off your are.

69
0:04:04.04,000 --> 0:04:07,000
When we think about how we address problems in this country,

70
0:04:07.88,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we often start from a place of trickle-down justice.

71
0:04:11.64,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So using white folks as the control we say,

72
0:04:14.48,000 --> 0:04:16,000
well, if we make things better for white folks

73
0:04:16.647,000 --> 0:04:18,000
then everybody else is going to get free.

74
0:04:19.44,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But actually it doesn't work that way.

75
0:04:21.32,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We have to address problems at the root,

76
0:04:24,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and when you deal with what's happening in black communities,

77
0:04:28.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
it creates an effervescence, right?

78
0:04:30.519,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So a bubble up rather than a trickle down.

79
0:04:33.36,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Let me give an example.

80
0:04:35.12,000 --> 0:04:36,000
When we talk about the wage gap,

81
0:04:36.72,000 --> 0:04:41,000
we often say women make 78 cents to every dollar that a man makes.

82
0:04:42.24,000 --> 0:04:43,000
You all have heard that before.

83
0:04:44.12,000 --> 0:04:47,000
But those are the statistics for white women and white men.

84
0:04:47.36,000 --> 0:04:51,000
The reality is that black women make something like 64 cents

85
0:04:51.48,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to every 78 cents that white women make.

86
0:04:54.96,000 --> 0:04:58,000
When we talk about latinas, it goes down to about 58 cents.

87
0:04:59.04,000 --> 0:05:01,000
If we were to talk about indigenous women,

88
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
if we were to talk about trans women,

89
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:04,000
it would even go further down.

90
0:05:04.92,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So again,

91
0:05:06.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
if you deal with those who are the most impacted,

92
0:05:08.56,000 --> 0:05:11,000
everybody has an opportunity to benefit from that,

93
0:05:11.84,000 --> 0:05:15,000
rather than dealing with the folks who are not as impacted,

94
0:05:15.88,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and expecting it to trickle down.

95
0:05:18.12,000 --> 0:05:19,000
MB: So I love the effervescence,

96
0:05:19.72,000 --> 0:05:2,000
bubbling up.

97
0:05:20.96,000 --> 0:05:21,000
AG: Effervescence -- like champagne.

98
0:05:22.72,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:23.96,000 --> 0:05:25,000
MB: Who doesn't love a glass of champagne, right?

100
0:05:26.32,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Champagne and freedom, right?

101
0:05:27.76,000 --> 0:05:28,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:29.04,000 --> 0:05:3,000
What more could we want, y'all?

103
0:05:31.32,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So you all have been doing this for a minute,

104
0:05:34.28,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and the last few years have been --

105
0:05:37.68,000 --> 0:05:38,000
well, I can't even imagine,

106
0:05:39.04,000 --> 0:05:41,000
but I'm sure very transformative.

107
0:05:41.44,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And I know that you all have learned a lot about leadership.

108
0:05:45.48,000 --> 0:05:47,000
What do you want to share with these people

109
0:05:47.56,000 --> 0:05:49,000
about what you've learned about leadership?

110
0:05:49.64,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Patrisse, let's start with you.

111
0:05:51.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
PC: Yeah, we have to invest in black leadership.

112
0:05:53.76,000 --> 0:05:55,000
That's what I've learned the most in the last few years.

113
0:05:56.44,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Applause)

114
0:05:58.8,000 --> 0:06:03,000
What we've seen is thousands of black people showing up for our lives

115
0:06:04.8,000 --> 0:06:07,000
with very little infrastructure and very little support.

116
0:06:09.4,000 --> 0:06:14,000
I think our work as movement leaders isn't just about our own visibility

117
0:06:14.72,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but rather how do we make the whole visible.

118
0:06:19.36,000 --> 0:06:22,000
How do we not just fight for our individual selves

119
0:06:22.48,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but fight for everybody?

120
0:06:24.32,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And I also think

121
0:06:27.68,000 --> 0:06:31,000
leadership looks like everybody in this audience

122
0:06:32.96,000 --> 0:06:34,000
showing up for black lives.

123
0:06:35.8,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It's not just about coming and watching people on a stage, right?

124
0:06:40.04,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It's about how do you become that leader --

125
0:06:42.064,000 --> 0:06:46,000
whether it's in your workplace, whether it's in your home --

126
0:06:46.2,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and believe that the movement for black lives isn't just for us,

127
0:06:50.28,000 --> 0:06:51,000
but it's for everybody.

128
0:06:53.48,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Applause)

129
0:06:57,000 --> 0:06:58,000
MB: What about you, Opal?

130
0:06:58.64,000 --> 0:07:01,000
OT: So I've been learning a great deal about interdependence.

131
0:07:02.44,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I've been learning about how to trust your team.

132
0:07:06.4,000 --> 0:07:07,000
I've come up with this new mantra

133
0:07:08.04,000 --> 0:07:1,000
after coming back from a three-month sabbatical,

134
0:07:10.8,000 --> 0:07:13,000
which is rare for black women to take who are in leadership,

135
0:07:14.48,000 --> 0:07:18,000
but I felt it was really important for my leadership and for my team

136
0:07:18.88,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to also practice stepping back

137
0:07:21.52,000 --> 0:07:23,000
as well as also sometimes stepping in.

138
0:07:24.36,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And what I learned in this process was that we need to acknowledge

139
0:07:29.36,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that different people contribute different strengths,

140
0:07:33.08,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and that in order for our entire team to flourish,

141
0:07:36.6,000 --> 0:07:4,000
we have to allow them to share and allow them to shine.

142
0:07:40.76,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And so during my sabbatical

143
0:07:42.48,000 --> 0:07:44,000
with the organization that I also work with,

144
0:07:45.08,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I saw our team rise up in my absence.

145
0:07:48.32,000 --> 0:07:5,000
They were able to launch new programs,

146
0:07:50.8,000 --> 0:07:51,000
fundraise.

147
0:07:52.24,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And when I came back,

148
0:07:53.96,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I had to give them a lot of gratitude and praise

149
0:07:58.04,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because they showed me that they truly had my back

150
0:08:01.8,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and that they truly had their own backs.

151
0:08:04.72,000 --> 0:08:06,000
You know, in this process of my sabbatical,

152
0:08:07.36,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I was really reminded

153
0:08:08.64,000 --> 0:08:12,000
of this Southern African philosophy of Ubuntu.

154
0:08:13.6,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I am because you are;

155
0:08:16.72,000 --> 0:08:17,000
you are because I am.

156
0:08:19.12,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I realized that my own leadership,

157
0:08:22.56,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and the contributions that I'm able to make,

158
0:08:25.12,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is in large part due to the contributions that they make, right?

159
0:08:29.4,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And I have to acknowledge that, and I have to see that,

160
0:08:32.04,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and so my new mantra is, "Keep calm and trust the team."

161
0:08:36.4,000 --> 0:08:37,000
And also,

162
0:08:37.64,000 --> 0:08:39,000
"Keep calm and thank the team."

163
0:08:40.08,000 --> 0:08:42,000
MB: You know, one of the things I feel like I've heard

164
0:08:42.68,000 --> 0:08:45,000
in the context of the Black Lives Matter movement more than anywhere else

165
0:08:46.48,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is about being a leaderful movement,

166
0:08:48.72,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and that's such a beautiful concept,

167
0:08:50.48,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and I think that something

168
0:08:51.76,000 --> 0:08:53,000
that women often bring to the conversation about leadership

169
0:08:54.6,000 --> 0:08:55,000
is really the collective piece.

170
0:08:56.12,000 --> 0:08:57,000
What about you, Alicia?

171
0:08:58.04,000 --> 0:08:59,000
AG: Yeah ...

172
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:03,000
How many of you heard that saying that leadership is lonely?

173
0:09:05.4,000 --> 0:09:07,000
I think that there is an element where leadership is lonely,

174
0:09:08.32,000 --> 0:09:11,000
but I also believe that it doesn't have to be like that.

175
0:09:11.56,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And in order for us to get to that point,

176
0:09:14.04,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I think there's a few things that we need to be doing.

177
0:09:16.8,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So one is we have to stop treating leaders like superheroes.

178
0:09:21.24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We are ordinary people attempting to do extraordinary things,

179
0:09:26.6,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and so we need to be supported in that way.

180
0:09:29.68,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The other thing that I've learned about leadership

181
0:09:32.44,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is that there's a difference between leadership and celebrities, right?

182
0:09:38.64,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And there's a way in which we've been kind of transformed into celebrities

183
0:09:44,000 --> 0:09:46,000
rather than people who are trying to solve a problem.

184
0:09:47.84,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And the way that we treat celebrities is very fickle, right?

185
0:09:50.8,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We like them one day,

186
0:09:52.08,000 --> 0:09:54,000
we don't like what they're wearing the next day,

187
0:09:54.36,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and all of a sudden we have issues, right?

188
0:09:56.68,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So we need to stop deifying leaders

189
0:09:59.08,000 --> 0:10:01,000
so that more people will step into leadership.

190
0:10:01.72,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Lots of people are terrified to step into leadership

191
0:10:04.36,000 --> 0:10:06,000
because of how much scrutiny they receive

192
0:10:07.08,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and how brutal we are with leaders.

193
0:10:10.2,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And then the last thing that I've learned about leadership

194
0:10:12.96,000 --> 0:10:15,000
is that it's really easy to be a leader when everybody likes you.

195
0:10:17.28,000 --> 0:10:21,000
But it's hard to be a leader when you have to make hard choices

196
0:10:21.96,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and when you have to do what's right,

197
0:10:23.84,000 --> 0:10:25,000
even though people are not going to like you for it.

198
0:10:26.76,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And so in that way,

199
0:10:28.04,000 --> 0:10:3,000
I think another way that we can support leaders

200
0:10:30.4,000 --> 0:10:32,000
is to struggle with us,

201
0:10:33.12,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but struggle with us politically,

202
0:10:34.76,000 --> 0:10:35,000
not personally.

203
0:10:36.52,000 --> 0:10:39,000
We can have disagreements without being disagreeable,

204
0:10:40.44,000 --> 0:10:43,000
but it's important for us to sharpen each other,

205
0:10:43.64,000 --> 0:10:44,000
so that we all can rise.

206
0:10:45.28,000 --> 0:10:46,000
MB: That's beautiful, thank you.

207
0:10:46.853,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Applause)

208
0:10:51.72,000 --> 0:10:53,000
So you all are doing work

209
0:10:54.6,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that forces you to face some brutal, painful realities

210
0:10:59.32,000 --> 0:11:,000
on a daily basis.

211
0:11:02.32,000 --> 0:11:03,000
What gives you hope

212
0:11:03.8,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and inspires you in that context?

213
0:11:07.32,000 --> 0:11:09,000
PC: I am hopeful for black futures.

214
0:11:10.32,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And I say that because we live in a society

215
0:11:14.56,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that's so obsessed with black death.

216
0:11:17.24,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We have images of our death on the TV screen,

217
0:11:21.84,000 --> 0:11:22,000
on our Twitter timelines,

218
0:11:23.76,000 --> 0:11:25,000
on our Facebook timelines,

219
0:11:26.32,000 --> 0:11:29,000
but what if instead we imagine black life?

220
0:11:30.32,000 --> 0:11:33,000
We imagine black people living and thriving.

221
0:11:33.72,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And that --

222
0:11:35.2,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that inspires me.

223
0:11:39.12,000 --> 0:11:42,000
OT: What inspires me these days are immigrants.

224
0:11:43.64,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Immigrants all over the world who are doing the best that they can

225
0:11:48.28,000 --> 0:11:52,000
to make a living, to survive and also to thrive.

226
0:11:52.76,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Right now there are over 244 million people

227
0:11:56.04,000 --> 0:11:58,000
who aren't living in their country of origin.

228
0:11:59.12,000 --> 0:12:02,000
This is a 40 percent increase since the year 2000.

229
0:12:03.44,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So what this tells me

230
0:12:05.12,000 --> 0:12:09,000
is that the disparities across the globe are only getting worse.

231
0:12:10.36,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Yet there are people who are finding the strength and wherewithal to travel,

232
0:12:15.64,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to move,

233
0:12:16.88,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to eke out a better living for themselves

234
0:12:19.2,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and to provide for their families and their loved ones.

235
0:12:22.44,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And some of these people who are immigrants

236
0:12:25,000 --> 0:12:26,000
are also undocumented.

237
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:28,000
They're unauthorized.

238
0:12:28.72,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And they inspire me even more

239
0:12:30.88,000 --> 0:12:33,000
because although our society is telling them, you're not wanted,

240
0:12:34.64,000 --> 0:12:35,000
you're not needed here,

241
0:12:36.04,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and they're highly vulnerable and subject to abuse, to wage theft,

242
0:12:40.44,000 --> 0:12:43,000
to exploitation and xenophobic attacks,

243
0:12:43.72,000 --> 0:12:47,000
many of them are also beginning to organize in their communities.

244
0:12:47.92,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And what I'm seeing is that there's also an emerging network

245
0:12:52.12,000 --> 0:12:56,000
of black, undocumented people who are resisting the framework,

246
0:12:56.44,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and resisting the criminalization of their existence.

247
0:12:59.4,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And that to me is incredibly powerful

248
0:13:02,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and inspires me every singe day.

249
0:13:04.32,000 --> 0:13:05,000
MB: Thank you.

250
0:13:06.68,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Alicia?

251
0:13:09.12,000 --> 0:13:13,000
AG: So we know that young people are the present and the future,

252
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:16,000
but what inspires me are older people

253
0:13:16.6,000 --> 0:13:2,000
who are becoming transformed in the service of this movement.

254
0:13:21.32,000 --> 0:13:22,000
We all know that as you get older,

255
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:25,000
you get a little more entrenched in your ways.

256
0:13:25.2,000 --> 0:13:27,000
It's happening to me, I know that's right.

257
0:13:28,000 --> 0:13:32,000
But I'm so inspired when I see people who have a way that they do things,

258
0:13:32.8,000 --> 0:13:34,000
have a way that they think about the world,

259
0:13:34.88,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and they're courageous enough to be open to listening to what the experiences are

260
0:13:40.32,000 --> 0:13:43,000
of so many of us who want to live in world that's just

261
0:13:43.76,000 --> 0:13:45,000
and want to live in a world that's equitable.

262
0:13:46.36,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And I'm also inspired by the actions that I'm seeing older people taking

263
0:13:51.04,000 --> 0:13:52,000
in service of this movement.

264
0:13:52.6,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I'm inspired by seeing older people step into their own power and leadership

265
0:13:57.48,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and say, "I'm not passing a torch,

266
0:14:00.28,000 --> 0:14:01,000
I'm helping you light the fire."

267
0:14:03.24,000 --> 0:14:04,000
(Applause)

268
0:14:04.48,000 --> 0:14:05,000
MB: I love that --

269
0:14:05.72,000 --> 0:14:06,000
yes.

270
0:14:07.12,000 --> 0:14:09,000
So in terms of action,

271
0:14:09.36,000 --> 0:14:13,000
I think that it is awesome to sit here and be able to listen to you all,

272
0:14:13.8,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and to have our minds open and shift,

273
0:14:18.08,000 --> 0:14:2,000
but that's not going to get black people free.

274
0:14:21.08,000 --> 0:14:24,000
So if you had one thing you would like this audience

275
0:14:24.56,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and the folks who are watching around the world to actually do,

276
0:14:28.28,000 --> 0:14:29,000
what would that be?

277
0:14:31.72,000 --> 0:14:34,000
AG: OK, two quick ones.

278
0:14:35.12,000 --> 0:14:36,000
One, call the White House.

279
0:14:37.04,000 --> 0:14:41,000
The water protectors are being forcibly removed

280
0:14:41.32,000 --> 0:14:46,000
from the camp that they have set up to defend what keeps us alive.

281
0:14:46.92,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And that is intricately related to black lives.

282
0:14:49.8,000 --> 0:14:53,000
So definitely call the White House and demand that they stop doing that.

283
0:14:53.88,000 --> 0:14:54,000
There are tanks

284
0:14:55.12,000 --> 0:14:59,000
and police officers arresting every single person there as we speak.

285
0:15:00.28,000 --> 0:15:02,000
(Applause)

286
0:15:02.88,000 --> 0:15:06,000
The second thing that you can do

287
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:09,000
is to join something.

288
0:15:10.36,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Be a part of something.

289
0:15:11.72,000 --> 0:15:13,000
There are groups, collectives --

290
0:15:14.24,000 --> 0:15:16,000
doesn't have to be a non-profit, you know what I mean?

291
0:15:16.84,000 --> 0:15:19,000
But there are groups that are doing work in our communities right now

292
0:15:20.44,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to make sure that black lives matter so all lives matter.

293
0:15:24.48,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Get involved;

294
0:15:25.72,000 --> 0:15:28,000
don't sit on your couch and tell people what you think they should be doing.

295
0:15:29.32,000 --> 0:15:3,000
Go do it with us.

296
0:15:31.84,000 --> 0:15:33,000
MB: Do you guys want to add anything?

297
0:15:34.32,000 --> 0:15:35,000
That's good? All right. So --

298
0:15:36.2,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And I think that the joining something,

299
0:15:38.32,000 --> 0:15:41,000
like if you feel like there's not something where you are, start it.

300
0:15:41.56,000 --> 0:15:42,000
AG: Start it.

301
0:15:42.8,000 --> 0:15:44,000
MB: These conversations that we're having,

302
0:15:44.88,000 --> 0:15:46,000
have those conversations with somebody else.

303
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And then instead of just letting it be a talk that you had,

304
0:15:49.84,000 --> 0:15:5,000
actually decide to start something.

305
0:15:51.56,000 --> 0:15:52,000
OT: That's right.

306
0:15:52.84,000 --> 0:15:53,000
MB: I mean, that's what you all did.

307
0:15:54.579,000 --> 0:15:56,000
You started something, and look what's happened.

308
0:15:56.859,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Thank you all so much for being here with us today.

309
0:15:59.8,000 --> 0:16:,000
OT: Thank you.

310
0:16:01.04,000 --> 0:16:04,000
(Applause)

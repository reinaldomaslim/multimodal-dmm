1
0:00:12.2,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Today I'm going to talk about work.

2
0:00:15.13,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And the question I want to ask and answer is this:

3
0:00:18.19,000 --> 0:00:19,000
"Why do we work?"

4
0:00:21.14,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Why do we drag ourselves out of bed every morning

5
0:00:25.07,000 --> 0:00:27,000
instead of living our lives

6
0:00:27.11,000 --> 0:00:32,000
just filled with bouncing from one TED-like adventure to another?

7
0:00:32.19,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

8
0:00:34.01,000 --> 0:00:37,000
You may be asking yourselves that very question.

9
0:00:37.09,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now, I know of course, we have to make a living,

10
0:00:39.21,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but nobody in this room thinks that that's the answer to the question,

11
0:00:43.06,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"Why do we work?"

12
0:00:44.11,000 --> 0:00:47,000
For folks in this room, the work we do is challenging,

13
0:00:48.11,000 --> 0:00:51,000
it's engaging, it's stimulating, it's meaningful.

14
0:00:52.02,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And if we're lucky, it might even be important.

15
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So, we wouldn't work if we didn't get paid,

16
0:00:57.17,000 --> 0:00:59,000
but that's not why we do what we do.

17
0:01:00.05,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And in general,

18
0:01:01.1,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I think we think that material rewards are a pretty bad reason

19
0:01:04.17,000 --> 0:01:05,000
for doing the work that we do.

20
0:01:06.1,000 --> 0:01:1,000
When we say of somebody that he's "in it for the money,"

21
0:01:10.14,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we are not just being descriptive.

22
0:01:13.02,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:14.1,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Now, I think this is totally obvious,

24
0:01:16.13,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but the very obviousness of it raises what is for me

25
0:01:19.12,000 --> 0:01:21,000
an incredibly profound question.

26
0:01:21.23,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Why, if this is so obvious,

27
0:01:24.05,000 --> 0:01:29,000
why is it that for the overwhelming majority of people on the planet,

28
0:01:30.06,000 --> 0:01:33,000
the work they do has none of the characteristics

29
0:01:34.02,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that get us up and out of bed and off to the office every morning?

30
0:01:38.21,000 --> 0:01:41,000
How is it that we allow the majority of people on the planet

31
0:01:42.11,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to do work that is monotonous, meaningless and soul-deadening?

32
0:01:47.11,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Why is it that as capitalism developed,

33
0:01:50.08,000 --> 0:01:53,000
it created a mode of production, of goods and services,

34
0:01:53.13,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in which all the nonmaterial satisfactions that might come from work were eliminated?

35
0:02:00.09,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Workers who do this kind of work,

36
0:02:02.11,000 --> 0:02:04,000
whether they do it in factories, in call centers,

37
0:02:05.07,000 --> 0:02:07,000
or in fulfillment warehouses,

38
0:02:07.19,000 --> 0:02:08,000
do it for pay.

39
0:02:09.19,000 --> 0:02:14,000
There is certainly no other earthly reason to do what they do except for pay.

40
0:02:15.01,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So the question is, "Why?"

41
0:02:18,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And here's the answer:

42
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the answer is technology.

43
0:02:23.11,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Now, I know, I know --

44
0:02:24.2,000 --> 0:02:27,000
yeah, yeah, yeah, technology, automation screws people, blah blah --

45
0:02:28.09,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that's not what I mean.

46
0:02:29.21,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I'm not talking about the kind of technology

47
0:02:32.13,000 --> 0:02:35,000
that has enveloped our lives, and that people come to TED to hear about.

48
0:02:36.13,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I'm not talking about the technology of things,

49
0:02:39.12,000 --> 0:02:4,000
profound though that is.

50
0:02:41.11,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I'm talking about another technology.

51
0:02:43.1,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I'm talking about the technology of ideas.

52
0:02:47.05,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I call it, "idea technology" --

53
0:02:49.14,000 --> 0:02:5,000
how clever of me.

54
0:02:50.22,000 --> 0:02:51,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:52.03,000 --> 0:02:56,000
In addition to creating things, science creates ideas.

56
0:02:56.15,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Science creates ways of understanding.

57
0:02:59.13,000 --> 0:03:,000
And in the social sciences,

58
0:03:01.08,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the ways of understanding that get created are ways of understanding ourselves.

59
0:03:06.07,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And they have an enormous influence on how we think, what we aspire to,

60
0:03:10.14,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and how we act.

61
0:03:12.04,000 --> 0:03:15,000
If you think your poverty is God's will, you pray.

62
0:03:16.05,000 --> 0:03:2,000
If you think your poverty is the result of your own inadequacy,

63
0:03:20.17,000 --> 0:03:22,000
you shrink into despair.

64
0:03:23.12,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And if you think your poverty is the result of oppression and domination,

65
0:03:27.22,000 --> 0:03:29,000
then you rise up in revolt.

66
0:03:29.23,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Whether your response to poverty is resignation or revolution,

67
0:03:34.03,000 --> 0:03:37,000
depends on how you understand the sources of your poverty.

68
0:03:37.21,000 --> 0:03:42,000
This is the role that ideas play in shaping us as human beings,

69
0:03:43.11,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and this is why idea technology may be the most profoundly important technology

70
0:03:49.05,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that science gives us.

71
0:03:51.1,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And there's something special about idea technology,

72
0:03:55.12,000 --> 0:03:57,000
that makes it different from the technology of things.

73
0:03:58.04,000 --> 0:04:01,000
With things, if the technology sucks,

74
0:04:01.19,000 --> 0:04:03,000
it just vanishes, right?

75
0:04:04,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Bad technology disappears.

76
0:04:06.12,000 --> 0:04:07,000
With ideas --

77
0:04:08.02,000 --> 0:04:13,000
false ideas about human beings will not go away

78
0:04:13.06,000 --> 0:04:15,000
if people believe that they're true.

79
0:04:16.23,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Because if people believe that they're true,

80
0:04:19.11,000 --> 0:04:22,000
they create ways of living and institutions

81
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
that are consistent with these very false ideas.

82
0:04:26.02,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And that's how the industrial revolution created a factory system

83
0:04:30.05,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in which there was really nothing you could possibly get out of your day's work,

84
0:04:34.2,000 --> 0:04:36,000
except for the pay at the end of the day.

85
0:04:37.08,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Because the father -- one of the fathers

86
0:04:39.07,000 --> 0:04:41,000
of the Industrial Revolution, Adam Smith --

87
0:04:41.13,000 --> 0:04:44,000
was convinced that human beings were by their very natures lazy,

88
0:04:45.11,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and wouldn't do anything unless you made it worth their while,

89
0:04:48.12,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and the way you made it worth their while

90
0:04:50.12,000 --> 0:04:52,000
was by incentivizing, by giving them rewards.

91
0:04:53.12,000 --> 0:04:55,000
That was the only reason anyone ever did anything.

92
0:04:56.07,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So we created a factory system consistent with that false view of human nature.

93
0:05:01.22,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But once that system of production was in place,

94
0:05:04.19,000 --> 0:05:06,000
there was really no other way for people to operate,

95
0:05:07.19,000 --> 0:05:11,000
except in a way that was consistent with Adam Smith's vision.

96
0:05:12.15,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So the work example is merely an example

97
0:05:15.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
of how false ideas can create a circumstance

98
0:05:19.22,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that ends up making them true.

99
0:05:23.14,000 --> 0:05:24,000
It is not true

100
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that you "just can't get good help anymore."

101
0:05:29.21,000 --> 0:05:3,000
It is true

102
0:05:31.12,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that you "can't get good help anymore"

103
0:05:34.04,000 --> 0:05:38,000
when you give people work to do that is demeaning and soulless.

104
0:05:39.03,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And interestingly enough, Adam Smith --

105
0:05:41.1,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the same guy who gave us this incredible invention

106
0:05:45.07,000 --> 0:05:47,000
of mass production, and division of labor

107
0:05:47.18,000 --> 0:05:48,000
-- understood this.

108
0:05:48.23,000 --> 0:05:51,000
He said, of people who worked in assembly lines,

109
0:05:52.18,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of men who worked in assembly lines, he says:

110
0:05:54.21,000 --> 0:06:,000
"He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become."

111
0:06:01.17,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Now, notice the word here is "become."

112
0:06:03.2,000 --> 0:06:09,000
"He generally becomes as stupid as it is possible for a human being to become."

113
0:06:09.23,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Whether he intended it or not, what Adam Smith was telling us there,

114
0:06:13.13,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is that the very shape of the institution within which people work

115
0:06:17.04,000 --> 0:06:21,000
creates people who are fitted to the demands of that institution

116
0:06:21.14,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and deprives people of the opportunity

117
0:06:24.04,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to derive the kinds of satisfactions from their work that we take for granted.

118
0:06:29.1,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The thing about science -- natural science --

119
0:06:32.1,000 --> 0:06:36,000
is that we can spin fantastic theories about the cosmos,

120
0:06:36.22,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and have complete confidence

121
0:06:38.17,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that the cosmos is completely indifferent to our theories.

122
0:06:43,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It's going to work the same damn way

123
0:06:45.02,000 --> 0:06:48,000
no matter what theories we have about the cosmos.

124
0:06:48.23,000 --> 0:06:53,000
But we do have to worry about the theories we have of human nature,

125
0:06:54.09,000 --> 0:06:59,000
because human nature will be changed by the theories we have

126
0:06:59.17,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that are designed to explain and help us understand human beings.

127
0:07:03.17,000 --> 0:07:07,000
The distinguished anthropologist, Clifford Geertz, said, years ago,

128
0:07:08.15,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that human beings are the "unfinished animals."

129
0:07:12.04,000 --> 0:07:16,000
And what he meant by that was that it is only human nature

130
0:07:16.22,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to have a human nature

131
0:07:18.14,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that is very much the product of the society in which people live.

132
0:07:23.01,000 --> 0:07:26,000
That human nature, that is to say our human nature,

133
0:07:26.12,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is much more created than it is discovered.

134
0:07:30.1,000 --> 0:07:32,000
We design human nature

135
0:07:32.15,000 --> 0:07:36,000
by designing the institutions within which people live and work.

136
0:07:37.08,000 --> 0:07:38,000
And so you people --

137
0:07:38.22,000 --> 0:07:42,000
pretty much the closest I ever get to being with masters of the universe --

138
0:07:43.04,000 --> 0:07:46,000
you people should be asking yourself a question,

139
0:07:47.02,000 --> 0:07:5,000
as you go back home to run your organizations.

140
0:07:50.06,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Just what kind of human nature do you want to help design?

141
0:07:54.14,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Thank you.

142
0:07:55.2,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Applause)

143
0:07:57.09,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Thanks.

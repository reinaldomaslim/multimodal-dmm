1
0:00:12.619,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I came to talk about first principles

2
0:00:15.578,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and communities that I love --

3
0:00:17.762,000 --> 0:00:19,000
especially East Palo Alto, California,

4
0:00:20.825,000 --> 0:00:22,000
which is full of amazing people.

5
0:00:23.588,000 --> 0:00:26,000
It's also a community that's oddly separated

6
0:00:26.619,000 --> 0:00:29,000
by the 101 freeway that runs through Silicon Valley.

7
0:00:29.929,000 --> 0:00:32,000
On the west side of the freeway in Palo Alto are the "haves,"

8
0:00:33.318,000 --> 0:00:35,000
on just about any dimension you can think of:

9
0:00:35.457,000 --> 0:00:37,000
education, income, access to water.

10
0:00:38.165,000 --> 0:00:41,000
On the east side of the freeway are the "have-nots."

11
0:00:41.842,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And even if you don't know East Palo Alto,

12
0:00:43.883,000 --> 0:00:45,000
you might know the story of eastside disparity,

13
0:00:46.169,000 --> 0:00:5,000
whether it's the separation of the railroad tracks in East Pittsburgh

14
0:00:50.388,000 --> 0:00:52,000
or the Grosse Pointe Gate in East Detroit

15
0:00:53.307,000 --> 0:00:55,000
or East St. Louis, East Oakland, East Philly.

16
0:00:56.903,000 --> 0:01:,000
Why is it that communities on the social, economic and environmental margin

17
0:01:01.756,000 --> 0:01:03,000
tend to be on the east sides of places?

18
0:01:05.533,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Turns out,

19
0:01:06.896,000 --> 0:01:07,000
it's the wind.

20
0:01:09.211,000 --> 0:01:11,000
If you look at the Earth from the North Pole,

21
0:01:11.331,000 --> 0:01:13,000
you'd see that it rotates counterclockwise.

22
0:01:13.966,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The impact of this

23
0:01:15.167,000 --> 0:01:18,000
is that the winds in the northern and the southern hemispheres

24
0:01:18.316,000 --> 0:01:21,000
blow in the same direction as the rotation of the Earth --

25
0:01:21.414,000 --> 0:01:22,000
to the east.

26
0:01:22.604,000 --> 0:01:23,000
A way to think about this is:

27
0:01:24.055,000 --> 0:01:25,000
imagine you're sitting around a campfire.

28
0:01:26.043,000 --> 0:01:29,000
You've got to seat 10 people, you've got to keep everyone warm.

29
0:01:29.248,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The question is: Who sits with the smoky wind blowing in their face?

30
0:01:33.401,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And the answer is:

31
0:01:34.843,000 --> 0:01:35,000
people with less power.

32
0:01:37.329,000 --> 0:01:39,000
This campfire dynamic is what's playing out in cities,

33
0:01:39.948,000 --> 0:01:41,000
not just in the US, but all around the world:

34
0:01:42.086,000 --> 0:01:45,000
East London; the east side of Paris is this way;

35
0:01:45.352,000 --> 0:01:46,000
East Jerusalem.

36
0:01:46.998,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Even down the street from where we're sitting right now,

37
0:01:49.681,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the marginalized community is East Vancouver.

38
0:01:52.6,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I'm not the only one to notice this.

39
0:01:54.363,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I nerded on this hard, for years.

40
0:01:56.68,000 --> 0:01:59,000
And I finally found a group of economic historians in the UK

41
0:02:00.084,000 --> 0:02:03,000
who modeled industrial-era smokestack dispersion.

42
0:02:03.673,000 --> 0:02:05,000
And they came to the same conclusion mathematically

43
0:02:06.133,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that I'd come to as an anthropologist,

44
0:02:08.115,000 --> 0:02:12,000
which is: wind and pollution are driving marginalized communities to the east.

45
0:02:13.395,000 --> 0:02:16,000
The dominant logic of the industrial era

46
0:02:16.419,000 --> 0:02:17,000
is about disparity.

47
0:02:18.18,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's about haves and have-nots, and that's become part of our culture.

48
0:02:21.711,000 --> 0:02:23,000
That's why you know exactly what I'm talking about

49
0:02:24.165,000 --> 0:02:26,000
if I tell you someone's from the "wrong side of the tracks."

50
0:02:27.038,000 --> 0:02:31,000
That phrase comes from the direction that wind would blow dirty train smoke --

51
0:02:31.411,000 --> 0:02:33,000
to the east, usually.

52
0:02:34.649,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I'm not saying every single community in the east is on the margin,

53
0:02:37.887,000 --> 0:02:39,000
or every community on the margin is in the east,

54
0:02:40.212,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but I'm trying to make a bigger point about disparity by design.

55
0:02:44.751,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So if you find yourself talking about any cardinal direction

56
0:02:47.988,000 --> 0:02:49,000
of a freeway, a river, some train tracks,

57
0:02:51.489,000 --> 0:02:53,000
you're talking about an eastside community.

58
0:02:54.776,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now, the wind is obviously a natural phenomenon.

59
0:02:58.044,000 --> 0:03:02,000
But the human design decisions that we make to separate ourselves

60
0:03:02.085,000 --> 0:03:03,000
is not natural.

61
0:03:04.502,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Consider the fact that every eastside community in the United States

62
0:03:08.335,000 --> 0:03:11,000
was built during the era of legal segregation.

63
0:03:11.974,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We clearly weren't even trying to design for the benefit of everyone,

64
0:03:15.657,000 --> 0:03:17,000
so we ended up dealing with issues like redlining.

65
0:03:18.585,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This is where the government literally created maps

66
0:03:21.435,000 --> 0:03:23,000
to tell bankers where they shouldn't lend.

67
0:03:23.831,000 --> 0:03:25,000
These are some of those actual maps.

68
0:03:25.879,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And you'll notice how the red tends to be clustered

69
0:03:28.3,000 --> 0:03:3,000
on the east sides of these cities.

70
0:03:32.038,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Those financial design decisions became a self-fulfilling prophecy:

71
0:03:36.21,000 --> 0:03:38,000
no loans turned into low property tax base

72
0:03:39.203,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and that bled into worse schools and a less well-prepared workforce,

73
0:03:44.173,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and -- lo and behold -- lower incomes.

74
0:03:46.046,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It means that you can't qualify for a loan.

75
0:03:49.188,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Just a vicious downward spiral.

76
0:03:51.292,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And that's just the case with lending.

77
0:03:53.165,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We've made similarly sinister design decisions on any number of issues,

78
0:03:57.647,000 --> 0:03:58,000
from water infrastructure

79
0:03:59.111,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to where we decide to place grocery stores versus liquor stores,

80
0:04:03.276,000 --> 0:04:08,000
or even for whom and how we design and fund technology products.

81
0:04:09.682,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Collectively, this list of harms

82
0:04:13.365,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is the artifact of our more primitive selves.

83
0:04:17.76,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I don't think this is how we'd want to be remembered,

84
0:04:20.53,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but this is basically what we've been doing

85
0:04:22.585,000 --> 0:04:24,000
to eastside communities for the last century.

86
0:04:26.212,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The good news is, it doesn't have to be this way.

87
0:04:29.514,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We got ourselves into this eastside dilemma

88
0:04:31.856,000 --> 0:04:32,000
through bad design,

89
0:04:33.058,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and so we can get out of it with good design.

90
0:04:35.854,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I believe the first principle of good design is actually really simple:

91
0:04:39.649,000 --> 0:04:43,000
we have to start with the commitment to design for the benefit of everyone.

92
0:04:43.807,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So, remember the campfire metaphor.

93
0:04:46.173,000 --> 0:04:49,000
If we want to benefit everyone, maybe we just sit in a horseshoe,

94
0:04:49.252,000 --> 0:04:51,000
so nobody gets the smoke in their face.

95
0:04:52.116,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I've got to make a note to the gentrifiers,

96
0:04:54.163,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because the point of this image is not to say

97
0:04:56.314,000 --> 0:04:59,000
you get to roll into eastside communities and just move people out of the way,

98
0:05:00.108,000 --> 0:05:01,000
because you don't.

99
0:05:01.322,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Applause)

100
0:05:02.702,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But the point is,

101
0:05:04.426,000 --> 0:05:07,000
if you start with this first principle of benefiting everyone,

102
0:05:07.95,000 --> 0:05:1,000
then elegant solutions may become more obvious than you assume.

103
0:05:12.855,000 --> 0:05:14,000
What are the elegant solutions to close this gap

104
0:05:15.236,000 --> 0:05:18,000
between Palo Alto and East Palo Alto in Silicon Valley?

105
0:05:19.427,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I've got to like the odds of starting with EPA [East Palo Alto].

106
0:05:22.576,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It's in the middle of Silicon Valley, the epicenter of innovation

107
0:05:26.585,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and wealth creation.

108
0:05:27.832,000 --> 0:05:29,000
If we can solve this problem anywhere, it ought to be here.

109
0:05:31.339,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And if we can solve the problems for EPA,

110
0:05:33.323,000 --> 0:05:35,000
we could apply those solutions to other eastside communities.

111
0:05:36.76,000 --> 0:05:39,000
If you think about it, it's actually a massive investment opportunity

112
0:05:41.458,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and an opportunity to drive policy change and philanthropy.

113
0:05:47.109,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But at the core, it's this fundamental design principle,

114
0:05:50.68,000 --> 0:05:54,000
this choice of whether we're going to decide to take care of everyone.

115
0:05:56.014,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And it's a choice we can make, loved ones.

116
0:05:59.482,000 --> 0:06:,000
We've got the capital.

117
0:06:01.498,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We've got technology on our side,

118
0:06:03.248,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and it keeps getting better.

119
0:06:04.951,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We've got some of the best entrepreneurs in the world in this building

120
0:06:08.285,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and in these communities right now.

121
0:06:11.633,000 --> 0:06:13,000
But the fundamental question is: What are we designing for?

122
0:06:14.499,000 --> 0:06:16,000
More haves and have-nots? More disparity?

123
0:06:17.963,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Or parity,

124
0:06:19.447,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the choice to come together.

125
0:06:22.24,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Because the reality is, this is not the industrial era.

126
0:06:27.5,000 --> 0:06:3,000
We don't live in the era of legal segregation.

127
0:06:32.112,000 --> 0:06:35,000
So the punchline is, there is no wrong side of the tracks.

128
0:06:36.93,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And all I'm saying is,

129
0:06:38.238,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we should design our economy and our communities with that in mind.

130
0:06:43.499,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Thank you.

131
0:06:44.675,000 --> 0:06:48,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
So I want to tell you a story -- an encouraging story --

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
about addressing

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
desperation, depression and despair in Afghanistan,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and what we have learned from it,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and how to help people

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
to overcome traumatic experiences

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
and how to help them to regain some confidence

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in the time ahead -- in the future --

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and how to participate again in everyday life.

10
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So, I am a Jungian psychoanalyst,

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and I went to Afghanistan in January 2004, by chance,

12
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
on an assignment for Medica Mondiale.

13
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Jung in Afghanistan --

14
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
you get the picture.

15
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Afghanistan is one of the poorest countries in the world,

16
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and 70 percent of the people are illiterate.

17
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
War and malnutrition kills people

18
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
together with hope.

19
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
You may know this from the media,

20
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
but what you may not know

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is that the average age of the Afghan people is 17 years old,

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
which means they grow up in such an environment

23
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and -- I repeat myself --

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
in 30 years of war.

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So this translates

26
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
into ongoing violence,

27
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
foreign interests, bribery,

28
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
drugs, ethnic conflicts,

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
bad health, shame, fear

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and cumulative traumatic experiences.

31
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Local and foreign military

32
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
are supposed to build peace together with the donors

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and the governmental and non-governmental organizations.

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And people had hope, yes,

35
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
but until they realized

36
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
their situation worsens every day --

37
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
either because they are being killed

38
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
or because, somehow,

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
they are poorer than eight years ago.

40
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
One figure for that:

41
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
54 percent of the children under the age of five years

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
suffer from malnutrition.

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Yet, there is hope.

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
One day a man told me,

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
"My future does not look brilliant,

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but I want to have a brilliant future for my son."

47
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
This is a picture I took in 2005,

48
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
walking on Fridays over the hills in Kabul,

49
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and for me it's a symbolic picture

50
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
of an open future for a young generation.

51
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So, doctors prescribe medication.

52
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And donors

53
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
are supposed to bring peace

54
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
by building schools and roads.

55
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Military collect weapons,

56
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and depression stays intact.

57
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Why?

58
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Because people don't have tools

59
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
to cope with it, to get over it.

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So, soon after my arrival,

61
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I had confirmed something which I had already known;

62
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that my instruments come from the heart of modern Europe, yes.

63
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
However, what can wound us

64
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and our reaction to those wounds --

65
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
they are universal.

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And the big challenge

67
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
was how to understand the meaning of the symptom

68
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
in this specific cultural context.

69
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
After a counseling session, a woman said to me,

70
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
"Because you have felt me, I can feel myself again,

71
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and I want to participate again

72
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in my family life."

73
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This was very important,

74
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
because the family is central

75
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
in Afghans' social system.

76
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
No one can survive alone.

77
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And if people feel used, worthless and ashamed,

78
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because something horrible has happened to them,

79
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
then they retreat, and they fall into social isolation,

80
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and they do not dare to tell this evil

81
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
to other people or to their loved ones,

82
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because they do not want to burden them.

83
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And very often violence is a way to cope with it.

84
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Traumatized people also easily lose control --

85
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
symptoms are hyper-arousal and memory flashbacks --

86
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
so people are in a constant fear

87
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that those horrible feelings of that traumatic event

88
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
might come back unexpectedly,

89
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
suddenly,

90
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and they cannot control it.

91
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
To compensate this loss of inner control,

92
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
they try to control the outside,

93
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
very understandably -- mostly the family --

94
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and unfortunately,

95
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
this fits very well

96
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
into the traditional side,

97
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
regressive side, repressive side,

98
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
restrictive side of the cultural context.

99
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So, husbands start beating wives,

100
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
mothers and fathers beat their children,

101
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and afterward, they feel awful.

102
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
They did not want to do this, it just happened --

103
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
they lost control.

104
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The desperate try

105
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to restore order and normality,

106
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and if we are not able to cut this circle of violence,

107
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
it will be transferred to the next generation without a doubt.

108
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And partly this is already happening.

109
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So everybody needs a sense for the future,

110
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and the Afghan sense of the future

111
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is shattered.

112
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But let me repeat the words of the woman.

113
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
"Because you have felt me,

114
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
I can feel myself again."

115
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So the key here is empathy.

116
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Somebody has to be a witness

117
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to what has happened to you.

118
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Somebody has to feel how you felt.

119
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
And somebody has to see you and listen to you.

120
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Everybody must be able

121
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
to know what he or she has experienced is true,

122
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and this only goes with another person.

123
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So everybody must be able to say,

124
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
"This happened to me, and it did this with me,

125
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but I'm able to live with it, to cope with it,

126
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and to learn from it.

127
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And I want to engage myself

128
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in the bright future for my children

129
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and the children of my children,

130
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I will not marry-off my 13 year-old daughter," --

131
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
what happens too often in Afghanistan.

132
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So something can be done,

133
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
even in such extreme environments as Afghanistan.

134
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And I started thinking about a counseling program.

135
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But, of course, I needed help and funds.

136
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And one evening,

137
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I was sitting next to a very nice gentleman in Kabul,

138
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and he asked what I thought would be good in Afghanistan.

139
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And I explained to him quickly,

140
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I would train psycho-social counselors,

141
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I would open centers, and I explained to him why.

142
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
This man gave me his contact details at the end of the evening

143
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and said, "If you want to do this, call me."

144
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
At that time, it was the head of Caritas Germany.

145
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So, I was able to launch a three-year project with Caritas Germany,

146
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and we trained 30 Afghan women and men,

147
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and we opened 15 counseling centers in Kabul.

148
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
This was our sign -- it's hand-painted,

149
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and we had 45 all over Kabul.

150
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Eleven thousand people came -- more than that.

151
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
And 70 percent regained their lives.

152
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This was a very exciting time,

153
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
developing this with my wonderful Afghan team.

154
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And they are working with me up to today.

155
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We developed a culturally-sensitive

156
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
psycho-social counseling approach.

157
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So, from 2008 up until today,

158
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
a substantial change and step forward

159
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
has been taking place.

160
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The European Union delegation in Kabul

161
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
came into this and hired me to work

162
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
inside the Ministry of Public Health,

163
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
to lobby this approach --

164
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
we succeeded.

165
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
We revised the mental health component

166
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
of the primary health care services

167
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
by adding psycho-social care

168
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and psycho-social counselors to the system.

169
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
This means, certainly, to retrain all health staff.

170
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But for that, we already have the training manuals,

171
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
which are approved by the Ministry

172
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and moreover, this approach is now part

173
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
of the mental health strategy in Afghanistan.

174
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So we also have implemented it already

175
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
in some selected clinics in three provinces,

176
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and you are the first to see the results.

177
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
We wanted to know if what is being done is effective.

178
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And here you can see

179
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the patients all had symptoms of depression,

180
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
moderate and severe.

181
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And the red line is the treatment as usual --

182
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
medication with a medical doctor.

183
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And all the symptoms

184
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
stayed the same or even got worse.

185
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And the green line is treatment with psycho-social counseling only,

186
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
without medication.

187
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And you can see the symptoms almost completely go away,

188
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and the psycho-social stress has dropped significantly,

189
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
which is explicable,

190
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
because you cannot take away the psycho-social stresses,

191
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
but you can learn how to cope with them.

192
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So this makes us very happy,

193
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
because now we also have some evidence

194
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
that this is working.

195
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So here you see,

196
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
this is a health facility in Northern Afghanistan,

197
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and every morning it looks like this all over.

198
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And doctors usually have three to six minutes for the patients,

199
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but now this will change.

200
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
They go to the clinics,

201
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
because they want to cure their immediate symptoms,

202
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and they will find somebody to talk to

203
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and discuss these issues

204
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and talk about what is burdening them

205
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and find solutions, develop their resources,

206
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
learn tools to solve their family conflicts

207
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and gain some confidence in the future.

208
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And I would like to share one short vignette.

209
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
One Hazara said to his Pashtun counselor,

210
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
"If we were to have met some years ago,

211
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
then we would have killed each other.

212
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And now you are helping me

213
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
to regain some confidence in the future."

214
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
And another counselor said to me after the training,

215
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
"You know, I never knew why I survived the killings in my village,

216
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but now I know,

217
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
because I am part of a nucleus

218
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
of a new peaceful society in Afghanistan."

219
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So I believe this kept me running.

220
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And this is a really emancipatory and political contribution

221
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
to peace and reconciliation.

222
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And also -- I think --

223
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
without psycho-social therapy,

224
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and without considering this

225
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in all humanitarian projects,

226
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
we cannot build-up civil societies.

227
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I thought it was an idea worth spreading,

228
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and I think it must be,

229
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
can be, could be replicated elsewhere.

230
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I thank you for your attention.

231
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Applause)

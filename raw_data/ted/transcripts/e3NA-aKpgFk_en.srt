1
0:00:25.6,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I've always wanted to be a cyborg.

2
0:00:27.28,000 --> 0:00:3,000
One of my favorite shows as a kid was "The Six Million Dollar Man,"

3
0:00:30.48,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and this is a little bit closer to the 240-dollar man or so, but --

4
0:00:33.68,000 --> 0:00:34,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:38,000
At any rate, I would normally feel very self-conscious and geeky

6
0:00:38.44,000 --> 0:00:39,000
wearing this around,

7
0:00:39.68,000 --> 0:00:42,000
but a few days ago I saw one world-renowned statistician

8
0:00:43.04,000 --> 0:00:44,000
swallowing swords on stage here,

9
0:00:44.64,000 --> 0:00:46,000
so I figure it's OK amongst this group.

10
0:00:48.28,000 --> 0:00:5,000
But that's not what I want to talk about today.

11
0:00:50.52,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I want to talk about toys, and the power that I see inherent in them.

12
0:00:54.44,000 --> 0:00:56,000
When I was a kid, I attended Montessori school

13
0:00:56.64,000 --> 0:00:58,000
up to sixth grade in Atlanta, Georgia.

14
0:00:59.04,000 --> 0:01:01,000
And at the time I didn't think much about it,

15
0:01:01.2,000 --> 0:01:04,000
but then later, I realized that that was the high point of my education.

16
0:01:04.64,000 --> 0:01:07,000
From that point on, everything else was pretty much downhill.

17
0:01:07.92,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And it wasn't until later, as I started making games, that --

18
0:01:10.88,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I really actually think of them more as toys.

19
0:01:13.04,000 --> 0:01:14,000
People call me a game designer,

20
0:01:14.6,000 --> 0:01:16,000
but I really think of these things more as toys.

21
0:01:16.88,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I started getting very interested in Maria Montessori and her methods,

22
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and the way she went about things,

23
0:01:21.94,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and the way she thought it very valuable for kids

24
0:01:24.3,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to discover things on their own

25
0:01:25.86,000 --> 0:01:27,000
rather than being taught these things overtly.

26
0:01:28.06,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And she would design these toys, where kids in playing with the toys

27
0:01:31.32,000 --> 0:01:33,000
would come to understand these deep principles

28
0:01:33.52,000 --> 0:01:34,000
of life and nature through play.

29
0:01:35.12,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And since they discovered this, it stuck with them so much more,

30
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and also they would experience their own failures.

31
0:01:40.56,000 --> 0:01:43,000
There was a failure-based aspect to learning there. It was very important.

32
0:01:44.08,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And so, the games that I do,

33
0:01:45.48,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I think of really more as modern Montessori toys.

34
0:01:47.84,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And I really kind of want them to be presented in a way

35
0:01:50.46,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles.

36
0:01:53.68,000 --> 0:01:54,000
So a few years ago,

37
0:01:54.869,000 --> 0:01:56,000
I started getting very interested in the SETI program.

38
0:01:57.46,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And that's the way I work.

39
0:01:58.781,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I get interested in different subjects, I dive in, research them,

40
0:02:01.882,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and then try to figure out how to craft a toy around that,

41
0:02:04.663,000 --> 0:02:06,000
so that other people can experience the same sense of discovery

42
0:02:07.664,000 --> 0:02:09,000
that I did as I was learning that subject.

43
0:02:09.727,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And it led me to astrobiology,

44
0:02:11.208,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the study of possible life in the universe.

45
0:02:13.289,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And then Drake's equation,

46
0:02:14.61,000 --> 0:02:16,000
looking at the probability of life arising on planets,

47
0:02:17.211,000 --> 0:02:19,000
how long it might last, how many planets are out there.

48
0:02:19.852,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And I started looking at how interesting Drake's equation was,

49
0:02:22.813,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because it spanned all these different subjects --

50
0:02:25.214,000 --> 0:02:28,000
physics, chemistry, sociology, economics, astronomy.

51
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And another thing that really impressed me a long time ago

52
0:02:31.92,000 --> 0:02:33,000
was "Powers of Ten," Charles and Ray Eames' film.

53
0:02:34.919,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And I started putting those two together and wondering, could I build a toy

54
0:02:38.52,000 --> 0:02:41,000
where kids would trip across all these interesting principles of life,

55
0:02:41.88,000 --> 0:02:43,000
as it exists and as it might go in the future.

56
0:02:44.08,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Things where you might trip across things

57
0:02:46.08,000 --> 0:02:48,000
like the Copernican principle, the Fermi paradox,

58
0:02:48.44,000 --> 0:02:5,000
the anthropic principle, the origin of life.

59
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And so I'm going to show you a toy today that I've been working on,

60
0:02:54.2,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that I think of more as kind of a philosophy toy.

61
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
Playing this toy will bring up philosophical questions in you.

62
0:03:00.56,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The game is "Spore." I've been working on it for several years.

63
0:03:03.64,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It's getting pretty close to finished now.

64
0:03:05.68,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It occurs at all these different scales, from very small to very large.

65
0:03:09.081,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I'm going to pop in at the start of the game.

66
0:03:11.242,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And you actually start this game in a drop of water,

67
0:03:13.723,000 --> 0:03:15,000
as a very, very small single-cell creature,

68
0:03:15.764,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and right off the bat you basically just have to live, survive, reproduce.

69
0:03:19.821,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So here we are, at a very microscopic scale,

70
0:03:22.8,000 --> 0:03:23,000
swimming around.

71
0:03:24.28,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And I actually realize that cells don't have eyes,

72
0:03:26.68,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but it helps to make it cute.

73
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The players are going to play through every generation of this species,

74
0:03:32.88,000 --> 0:03:33,000
and as you play the game,

75
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the creature is actually growing bit by bit.

76
0:03:36.28,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And as we start growing,

77
0:03:37.88,000 --> 0:03:39,000
the camera will actually start zooming out,

78
0:03:39.96,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and things that you see in the background there

79
0:03:42.2,000 --> 0:03:44,000
will start slowly pulling into the foreground,

80
0:03:44.4,000 --> 0:03:47,000
showing you a little bit of what you'll be interacting with as you grow.

81
0:03:47.84,000 --> 0:03:49,000
So as we eat, the camera starts pulling out,

82
0:03:5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and then we start interacting with larger and larger organisms.

83
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We actually play through many generations here,

84
0:03:55.24,000 --> 0:03:56,000
at the cellular scale.

85
0:03:56.48,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I'm going to skip ahead here.

86
0:03:57.92,000 --> 0:03:58,000
At some point we get larger,

87
0:03:59.32,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and we actually get to a macroevolution scale.

88
0:04:03.102,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Now, at this point we're leaving the water,

89
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and one thing that's kind of important about this game is that, at every level,

90
0:04:09.76,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the player is designing their creature,

91
0:04:12.04,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and that's a fundamental aspect of this.

92
0:04:14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Now, in the evolution game here, the creature scale,

93
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:19,000
basically you have to eat, survive, and then reproduce.

94
0:04:19.6,000 --> 0:04:2,000
You know, very Darwinian.

95
0:04:21.44,000 --> 0:04:23,000
One thing we noticed with "The Sims," a game I did earlier,

96
0:04:24.44,000 --> 0:04:25,000
is that players love making stuff.

97
0:04:26.12,000 --> 0:04:28,000
When they were able to make stuff in the game,

98
0:04:28.32,000 --> 0:04:3,000
they had a lot of empathy in connection to it.

99
0:04:30.561,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Even if it wasn't as pretty

100
0:04:32.261,000 --> 0:04:34,000
as a professional artist would make for games,

101
0:04:34.976,000 --> 0:04:35,000
it really stuck with them

102
0:04:36.217,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and they really cared about what would happen to it.

103
0:04:38.698,000 --> 0:04:41,000
At this point, we've left the water, and now with this little creature --

104
0:04:42.152,000 --> 0:04:44,000
we could bring up the volume a little bit --

105
0:04:44.246,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and now we might try to eat.

106
0:04:46.814,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We might sneak up on this little guy over here maybe,

107
0:04:51.08,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and try and eat him.

108
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:54,000
OK, well, we fight.

109
0:04:54.4,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Creatures grunting)

110
0:04:57.76,000 --> 0:04:58,000
OK, we got him.

111
0:05:00.28,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now we get a meal.

112
0:05:03.344,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So really, at this part of the game,

113
0:05:05.12,000 --> 0:05:07,000
what we're doing is we're running around and surviving,

114
0:05:07.76,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and also getting to the next generation,

115
0:05:09.72,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because we're going to play through every generation of this creature.

116
0:05:13.04,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We can mate, so I'm going to see

117
0:05:14.64,000 --> 0:05:16,000
if one of these creatures wants to mate with me. Yeah.

118
0:05:21.636,000 --> 0:05:23,000
(Creatures grunting)

119
0:05:23.68,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We didn't want to replay actual evolution with humans and all that,

120
0:05:27.52,000 --> 0:05:28,000
because it's almost more interesting

121
0:05:29.28,000 --> 0:05:31,000
to look at alternate possibilities in evolution.

122
0:05:31.56,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Evolution is usually presented as this one path that we took through,

123
0:05:34.84,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but really it represents this huge set of possibilities.

124
0:05:37.52,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Now, once we mate, we click on the egg.

125
0:05:39.44,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And this is where the game starts getting interesting,

126
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:44,000
because one of the things we really focused on here

127
0:05:44.44,000 --> 0:05:46,000
was giving the players very high-leverage tools,

128
0:05:46.72,000 --> 0:05:49,000
so that for very little effort, the player can make something very cool.

129
0:05:50.32,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And it involves a lot of intelligence on the tool side.

130
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:54,000
But basically, this is the editor

131
0:05:54.6,000 --> 0:05:56,000
where we're going to design the next generation.

132
0:05:56.902,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So it has a little spine. I can move around, I can extend.

133
0:05:59.96,000 --> 0:06:01,000
I can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel,

134
0:06:02.52,000 --> 0:06:03,000
so you sculpt it like clay.

135
0:06:03.88,000 --> 0:06:05,000
We have parts here that I can put on or pull off.

136
0:06:06.24,000 --> 0:06:08,000
The idea is that the player can basically design

137
0:06:08.52,000 --> 0:06:1,000
anything they can think of in this editor,

138
0:06:10.56,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and we'll basically bring it to life.

139
0:06:12.4,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So I might put some limbs on the character here.

140
0:06:14.68,000 --> 0:06:15,000
I'll inflate them kind of large.

141
0:06:16.28,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And in this case I might decide I'm going to put --

142
0:06:20.92,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I'll put mouths on the limbs.

143
0:06:25.88,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game.

144
0:06:30.12,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Here, I'll give it one eye in the middle, maybe scale it up a bit. Point it down.

145
0:06:34.44,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And I'll also give it a few legs.

146
0:06:39.12,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So in some sense

147
0:06:40.36,000 --> 0:06:43,000
we want this to feel like an amplifier for the player's imagination,

148
0:06:43.8,000 --> 0:06:46,000
so that with a very small number of clicks a player can create something

149
0:06:47.56,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that they didn't really think was possible before.

150
0:06:49.96,000 --> 0:06:51,000
This is almost like designing something like Maya --

151
0:06:52.44,000 --> 0:06:53,000
that an eight-year-old can use.

152
0:06:53.96,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But really the goal here was,

153
0:06:55.4,000 --> 0:06:57,000
within about a minute, I wanted somebody to replicate

154
0:06:57.92,000 --> 0:07:,000
what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create.

155
0:07:01.2,000 --> 0:07:02,000
OK, now I'll put some hands on it.

156
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:05,000
OK, so here I've basically thrown together a little creature.

157
0:07:06.08,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Let me give it a little weapon on the tail here, so it can fight.

158
0:07:09.88,000 --> 0:07:1,000
OK, so that's the complete model.

159
0:07:11.52,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Now we can actually go to the painting phase.

160
0:07:13.68,000 --> 0:07:15,000
At this phase, the program has some understanding

161
0:07:16.2,000 --> 0:07:17,000
of the topology of this creature.

162
0:07:17.84,000 --> 0:07:2,000
It knows where the backbone is, where the spine, the limbs are,

163
0:07:20.9,000 --> 0:07:22,000
how stripes should run, how it should be shaded.

164
0:07:23.18,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And so we're procedurally generating the texture map,

165
0:07:25.7,000 --> 0:07:27,000
something a texture artist would take many days to work on.

166
0:07:28.6,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And then we can test it out, and see how it would move around.

167
0:07:31.56,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature.

168
0:07:35.08,000 --> 0:07:38,000
It's looking at whatever I've designed. It will actually bring it to life.

169
0:07:38.6,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And I can see how it might dance.

170
0:07:40.2,000 --> 0:07:41,000
(Laughter)

171
0:07:41.44,000 --> 0:07:43,000
How it might show emotions, how it might fight.

172
0:07:45.64,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So it's acting with its two mouths there.

173
0:07:47.64,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I can even have it pose for a photo.

174
0:07:49.52,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Snap a little photo of it.

175
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:52,000
(Laughter)

176
0:07:53,000 --> 0:07:55,000
So then I bring this back into the game.

177
0:07:55.04,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It's born, and I play the next generation of my creature through evolution.

178
0:07:58.6,000 --> 0:08:,000
Now again, the empathy that the players have

179
0:08:01.08,000 --> 0:08:03,000
when they create the content is tremendous.

180
0:08:03.12,000 --> 0:08:06,000
When players create content in this game, it's automatically sent up to a server

181
0:08:06.92,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and then redistributed to all the other players transparently.

182
0:08:09.88,000 --> 0:08:12,000
So in fact, as I'm interacting in this world with other creatures,

183
0:08:13.04,000 --> 0:08:16,000
these creatures are transparently coming from other players as they play.

184
0:08:16.96,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So the process of playing the game

185
0:08:18.64,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is a process of building up this huge database of content.

186
0:08:21.52,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And pretty much everything you're going to see in this game,

187
0:08:24.4,000 --> 0:08:26,000
there's an editor for that the player can create,

188
0:08:27.08,000 --> 0:08:28,000
up through civilization.

189
0:08:28.703,000 --> 0:08:3,000
This is my baby. When I eat, I'll actually start growing.

190
0:08:31.42,000 --> 0:08:34,000
This is the next generation. But I'm going to skip ahead here.

191
0:08:34.48,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Normally what would happen is these creatures would work their way up,

192
0:08:37.84,000 --> 0:08:38,000
eventually become intelligent.

193
0:08:39.32,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I'd start dealing with tribes, cities and civilizations of them over time.

194
0:08:42.84,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I'm going to skip way ahead to the space phase.

195
0:08:45.08,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Eventually they would go out into space,

196
0:08:47.04,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and start colonizing and exploring the universe.

197
0:08:50.68,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Now, really, in some sense,

198
0:08:52.382,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I want the players to be building this world in their imagination,

199
0:08:55.68,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and then extracting it from them with the least amount of pain.

200
0:08:58.72,000 --> 0:09:,000
So that's kind of what these tools are about.

201
0:09:00.88,000 --> 0:09:02,000
How do we make the gameplay,

202
0:09:03.159,000 --> 0:09:06,000
you know, basically the player's imagination amplifier?

203
0:09:06.36,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And how do we make these tools, these editors,

204
0:09:09.09,000 --> 0:09:12,000
something that are just as fun as the game itself?

205
0:09:12.12,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So this is the planet that we've been playing on

206
0:09:14.4,000 --> 0:09:15,000
up to this point in the game.

207
0:09:16.08,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here.

208
0:09:19.88,000 --> 0:09:22,000
At this point we're actually dealing with a very little toy planet.

209
0:09:23.08,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Almost, again, like the Montessori toy idea.

210
0:09:25.2,000 --> 0:09:27,000
What happens if you give somebody a toy planet,

211
0:09:27.44,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and let them play with a lot of dynamics on it?

212
0:09:29.68,000 --> 0:09:31,000
What could they discover? What might they learn on this?

213
0:09:32.36,000 --> 0:09:35,000
This world was actually extracted from the player's imagination.

214
0:09:35.4,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So, this is the planet that the player evolved on.

215
0:09:37.8,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Things like the buildings, the vehicles, the architecture, civilizations

216
0:09:41.24,000 --> 0:09:43,000
were all designed by the player up to this point.

217
0:09:43.6,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So here's a little city with some of our guys walking around in it.

218
0:09:46.8,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And most games put the player in the role of Luke Skywalker,

219
0:09:49.68,000 --> 0:09:51,000
this protagonist playing through this story.

220
0:09:51.8,000 --> 0:09:54,000
This is more about putting the player in the role of George Lucas.

221
0:09:54.96,000 --> 0:09:56,000
I want them, after they've played this game,

222
0:09:57.08,000 --> 0:10:,000
to have extracted an entire world that they're now interacting with.

223
0:10:00.32,000 --> 0:10:01,000
As we pull down here,

224
0:10:01.56,000 --> 0:10:04,000
we still have a whole set of creatures living on the surface of the planet.

225
0:10:05.12,000 --> 0:10:07,000
All these different dynamics going on here.

226
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I can look over here, and this is a little simplified food web

227
0:10:10.12,000 --> 0:10:11,000
that's going on with the creatures.

228
0:10:11.84,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I can open this up and then scan what exists on the surface.

229
0:10:14.72,000 --> 0:10:17,000
You get some sense of the diversity of creatures that were brought in.

230
0:10:18.1,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Some of these were created by the player,

231
0:10:20.1,000 --> 0:10:22,000
others by other players, automatically sent over here.

232
0:10:22.72,000 --> 0:10:24,000
But there's a very simple calculation of what's required,

233
0:10:25.46,000 --> 0:10:27,000
how many plants are required for the herbivores to live,

234
0:10:28.14,000 --> 0:10:3,000
how many herbivores for the carnivores to eat, etc.,

235
0:10:30.62,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that you have to balance actively.

236
0:10:32.3,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Also with this phase,

237
0:10:33.54,000 --> 0:10:35,000
we're getting more and more God-like powers for the player,

238
0:10:36.34,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and you can experiment with this planet as a toy.

239
0:10:38.68,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So I can come in and I can do things,

240
0:10:40.48,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and just treat this planet as a lump of clay.

241
0:10:42.6,000 --> 0:10:44,000
We have very simple weather systems, simple geology.

242
0:10:45.081,000 --> 0:10:48,000
For instance, I could open one of my tools here and then carve out rivers.

243
0:10:49.92,000 --> 0:10:52,000
So this whole thing is kind of like a big lump of clay, a sculpture.

244
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I can also play with the dynamics in this world over time.

245
0:10:55.92,000 --> 0:10:56,000
So one of the things I can do

246
0:10:57.36,000 --> 0:11:,000
is start pumping more CO2 gases into the atmosphere,

247
0:11:00.76,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and so that's what I'm doing here.

248
0:11:02.44,000 --> 0:11:04,000
There's actually a little readout down there

249
0:11:04.56,000 --> 0:11:06,000
of our planetary atmosphere, pressure and temperature.

250
0:11:07.88,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So as I start pumping in more atmosphere,

251
0:11:09.88,000 --> 0:11:11,000
we're going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here

252
0:11:12.6,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and if you'll start noticing,

253
0:11:14.04,000 --> 0:11:16,000
we start seeing the ocean levels rise over time.

254
0:11:16.88,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And our cities are going to be at risk too,

255
0:11:18.96,000 --> 0:11:2,000
because a lot of these are coastal cities.

256
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
You can see the ocean levels are rising now

257
0:11:23.04,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and as they encroach upon the cities, I'll start losing cities here.

258
0:11:26.34,000 --> 0:11:29,000
So basically, I want the players to be able to experiment and explore

259
0:11:29.62,000 --> 0:11:3,000
a huge amount of failure space.

260
0:11:31.18,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So there goes one city.

261
0:11:33.467,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Now, over time, this is going to heat up the planet.

262
0:11:35.92,000 --> 0:11:36,000
So at first what we're going to see

263
0:11:37.64,000 --> 0:11:39,000
is a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet,

264
0:11:40.2,000 --> 0:11:42,000
but then over time -- I can speed it up --

265
0:11:42.241,000 --> 0:11:44,000
we'll see the heat impact of that as well.

266
0:11:44.362,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Not only will it get hotter,

267
0:11:46.289,000 --> 0:11:49,000
but at some point it's going to get so hot the oceans will evaporate.

268
0:11:49.63,000 --> 0:11:52,000
They'll go up, and then they'll evaporate, and that'll be my planet.

269
0:11:52.971,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So basically, what we're getting here

270
0:11:54.772,000 --> 0:11:56,000
is the sequel to "An Inconvenient Truth," in about two minutes,

271
0:11:57.773,000 --> 0:12:,000
and that actually brings up an interesting point about games.

272
0:12:00.934,000 --> 0:12:03,000
Now here, our entire oceans are evaporating off the surface,

273
0:12:05.12,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and as it keeps getting hotter,

274
0:12:06.68,000 --> 0:12:09,000
at some point the entire planet is going to melt down. Here it goes.

275
0:12:10.24,000 --> 0:12:12,000
So we're not only simulating biological dynamics --

276
0:12:12.68,000 --> 0:12:13,000
food webs and all that --

277
0:12:13.92,000 --> 0:12:15,000
but also geologic, you know, on a very simple core scale.

278
0:12:16.64,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And what's interesting to me about games

279
0:12:18.569,000 --> 0:12:2,000
is that I think we can take a lot of long-term dynamics

280
0:12:21.2,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and compress them into very short-term experiences.

281
0:12:24.24,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Because it's so hard for people to think 50 or 100 years out,

282
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:28,000
but when you can give them a toy,

283
0:12:28.8,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and they can experience these long-term dynamics in just a few minutes,

284
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I think it's an entirely different point of view,

285
0:12:34.52,000 --> 0:12:36,000
where we're actually using the game to remap our intuition.

286
0:12:37.32,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It's almost in the same way

287
0:12:38.68,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that a telescope or microscope recalibrates your eyesight;

288
0:12:41.44,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I think computer simulations can recalibrate your instinct

289
0:12:44.2,000 --> 0:12:46,000
across vast scales of both space and time.

290
0:12:46.224,000 --> 0:12:47,000
So here's our little solar system,

291
0:12:47.88,000 --> 0:12:49,000
as we pull away from our melted planet here.

292
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
We actually have a couple of other planets in this solar system.

293
0:12:53.08,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Let's fly to another one.

294
0:12:54.32,000 --> 0:12:57,000
We're going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can explore here.

295
0:12:57.8,000 --> 0:12:58,000
As we move into the future,

296
0:12:59.16,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and we start going out into space and doing stuff,

297
0:13:01.56,000 --> 0:13:03,000
we're drawing a lot from things like science fiction.

298
0:13:04.08,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And all my favorite science fiction movies

299
0:13:06.12,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I want to play out here as different dynamics.

300
0:13:08.32,000 --> 0:13:09,000
This planet actually has some life on it.

301
0:13:10.32,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Here it is, some indigenous life down here.

302
0:13:12.36,000 --> 0:13:14,000
One of the tools I can eventually earn for my UFO

303
0:13:14.72,000 --> 0:13:15,000
is a monolith that I can drop down.

304
0:13:16.44,000 --> 0:13:17,000
(Laughter)

305
0:13:18.96,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Now, as you can see,

306
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:24,000
these guys are actually starting to go up and bow to it,

307
0:13:24.32,000 --> 0:13:27,000
and over time, once they touch it, they will become intelligent.

308
0:13:27.36,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So I can actually pick a species on a planet

309
0:13:29.48,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and then make them sentient.

310
0:13:30.88,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Now they've actually gone to tribal dynamics.

311
0:13:33.04,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And now, because I'm actually the one here,

312
0:13:35.08,000 --> 0:13:36,000
I can get out of the UFO and walk up,

313
0:13:36.92,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and they should be worshipping me at this point as a god.

314
0:13:40.04,000 --> 0:13:41,000
At first they're a little freaked out.

315
0:13:46.536,000 --> 0:13:48,000
OK, well maybe they're not worshipping me.

316
0:13:48.56,000 --> 0:13:49,000
(Laughter)

317
0:13:49.6,000 --> 0:13:51,000
I think I'll leave before they get hostile.

318
0:13:52.72,000 --> 0:13:54,000
But we basically want a diversity of activities

319
0:13:54.96,000 --> 0:13:55,000
the players can play through this.

320
0:13:56.64,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I want to be able to play

321
0:13:57.92,000 --> 0:13:59,000
"The Day the Earth Stood Still," "2001: A Space Odyssey,"

322
0:14:00.64,000 --> 0:14:01,000
"Star Trek," "War Of the Worlds."

323
0:14:02.28,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Now, as we pull away from this world --

324
0:14:04.28,000 --> 0:14:06,000
we're going to keep pulling away from the star now.

325
0:14:06.72,000 --> 0:14:08,000
One of the things that always frustrated me about astronomy

326
0:14:09.56,000 --> 0:14:1,000
when I was a kid

327
0:14:10.8,000 --> 0:14:13,000
is how it was always presented so two-dimensionally and so static.

328
0:14:13.96,000 --> 0:14:14,000
As we pull away from the star here,

329
0:14:15.68,000 --> 0:14:17,000
we're actually going now out into interstellar space,

330
0:14:18.2,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and we're getting a sense of the space around our home star.

331
0:14:21.08,000 --> 0:14:23,000
What I really wanted to do is to present this, basically,

332
0:14:23.8,000 --> 0:14:25,000
as wonderfully 3D as it is actually is.

333
0:14:26.12,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And also show the dynamics,

334
0:14:28.12,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and a lot of the interesting objects that you might find, like, in the Hubble,

335
0:14:31.84,000 --> 0:14:33,000
at pretty much realistic frequencies and scales.

336
0:14:34.12,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So most people have no idea of the difference

337
0:14:36.28,000 --> 0:14:38,000
between an emission nebula and a planetary nebula.

338
0:14:38.68,000 --> 0:14:39,000
But these are the things

339
0:14:39.96,000 --> 0:14:41,000
that we can put in this little galaxy here.

340
0:14:42.04,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So we're flying over here to what looks like a black hole.

341
0:14:44.8,000 --> 0:14:46,000
I want to basically have the entire zoo of Hubble objects

342
0:14:47.52,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that people can interact with and play with, again, as toys.

343
0:14:50.4,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So here's a little black hole

344
0:14:51.84,000 --> 0:14:53,000
that we probably don't want to get too close to.

345
0:14:55.12,000 --> 0:14:57,000
But we also have stars and things as well.

346
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
If we pull all the way back, we start seeing the entire galaxy here,

347
0:15:00.64,000 --> 0:15:01,000
kind of slowly in motion.

348
0:15:02.6,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Typically, when people present galaxies,

349
0:15:05.84,000 --> 0:15:07,000
it's always beautiful photos, but they're always static.

350
0:15:08.547,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And when you bring it forward in time and start animating it,

351
0:15:11.46,000 --> 0:15:13,000
it's amazing what a galaxy would look like fast forwarded.

352
0:15:14.278,000 --> 0:15:16,000
This would be about a million years a second,

353
0:15:16.459,000 --> 0:15:18,000
because you have about one supernova every century.

354
0:15:19.08,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And so you'd have this wonderful sparkling thing,

355
0:15:21.44,000 --> 0:15:22,000
with the disk slowly rotating,

356
0:15:22.92,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and this is roughly what it would look like.

357
0:15:25.04,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Part of this is about bringing the beauty of the natural world

358
0:15:28.06,000 --> 0:15:29,000
to somebody in a very imaginative way,

359
0:15:29.94,000 --> 0:15:31,000
so that they can start calibrating their instinct

360
0:15:32.3,000 --> 0:15:34,000
across these vast scales of space and time.

361
0:15:34.38,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Chris was wondering what kind of gods the players would become.

362
0:15:38.64,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Because if you think about it,

363
0:15:40.12,000 --> 0:15:43,000
you're going to have 15-year-olds, 20-year-olds flying around this universe.

364
0:15:43.74,000 --> 0:15:44,000
They might be a nurturing god.

365
0:15:45.22,000 --> 0:15:47,000
They might be bootstrapping life on planets,

366
0:15:47.34,000 --> 0:15:49,000
trying to terraform and spread civilization.

367
0:15:49.46,000 --> 0:15:51,000
You might be a vengeful god, conquesting,

368
0:15:51.72,000 --> 0:15:54,000
because you actually can do that, you can attack other intelligent races.

369
0:15:55.2,000 --> 0:15:58,000
You might be a networking god, building alliances,

370
0:15:58.246,000 --> 0:16:01,000
or just curious, going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can.

371
0:16:02.682,000 --> 0:16:05,000
But basically, the reason why I make toys like this

372
0:16:06.451,000 --> 0:16:08,000
is because I think if there's one difference

373
0:16:08.737,000 --> 0:16:1,000
I could possibly make in the world,

374
0:16:11.48,000 --> 0:16:12,000
that I would choose to make,

375
0:16:12.88,000 --> 0:16:14,000
it's that I would like to somehow give people

376
0:16:15.04,000 --> 0:16:17,000
just a little bit better calibration on long-term thinking.

377
0:16:17.88,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Because I think most of the problems that our world is facing right now

378
0:16:21.24,000 --> 0:16:22,000
are the result of short-term thinking,

379
0:16:23.08,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50, 100, or 1,000 years out.

380
0:16:27.28,000 --> 0:16:3,000
And I think by giving kids toys like this and letting them replay dynamics,

381
0:16:30.96,000 --> 0:16:32,000
very long-term dynamics over the short term,

382
0:16:33.08,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and getting some sense of what we're doing now,

383
0:16:35.32,000 --> 0:16:36,000
what it's going to be like in 100 years,

384
0:16:37.28,000 --> 0:16:4,000
I think probably is the most effective thing I can be doing to help the world.

385
0:16:41.28,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And so that's why I think that toys can change the world.

386
0:16:43.971,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Thank you.

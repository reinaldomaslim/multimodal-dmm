1
0:00:13.638,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Billie Jean King: Hi, everyone!

2
0:00:16.006,000 --> 0:00:18,000
(Applause)

3
0:00:18.372,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Thanks, Pat.

4
0:00:19.574,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Thank you!

5
0:00:23.92,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Getting me all wound up, now!

6
0:00:25.54,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:26.57,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Pat Mitchell: Good!

8
0:00:28.641,000 --> 0:00:31,000
You know, when I was watching the video again of the match,

9
0:00:32.562,000 --> 0:00:36,000
you must have felt like the fate of the world's women

10
0:00:37.075,000 --> 0:00:39,000
was on every stroke you took.

11
0:00:40.446,000 --> 0:00:41,000
Were you feeling that?

12
0:00:42.835,000 --> 0:00:45,000
BJK: First of all, Bobby Riggs -- he was the former number one player,

13
0:00:46.178,000 --> 0:00:48,000
he wasn't just some hacker, by the way.

14
0:00:48.204,000 --> 0:00:5,000
He was one of my heroes and I admired him.

15
0:00:51.848,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And that's the reason I beat him, actually, because I respected him.

16
0:00:55.36,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:56.483,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's true -- my mom and especially my dad always said:

18
0:00:59.103,000 --> 0:01:01,000
"Respect your opponent, and never underestimate them, ever."

19
0:01:02.005,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And he was correct. He was absolutely correct.

20
0:01:05.245,000 --> 0:01:07,000
But I knew it was about social change.

21
0:01:08.962,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And I was really nervous whenever we announced it,

22
0:01:12.348,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and I felt like the whole world was on my shoulders.

23
0:01:15.241,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And I thought, "If I lose, it's going to put women back 50 years, at least."

24
0:01:20.926,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Title IX had just been passed the year before -- June 23, 1972.

25
0:01:25.892,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And women's professional tennis --

26
0:01:28.49,000 --> 0:01:31,000
there were nine of us who signed a one-dollar contract in 1970 --

27
0:01:31.787,000 --> 0:01:33,000
now remember, the match is in '73.

28
0:01:34.454,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So we were only in our third year of having a tour

29
0:01:37.638,000 --> 0:01:41,000
where we could actually play, have a place to compete and make a living.

30
0:01:41.922,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So there were nine of us that signed that one-dollar contract.

31
0:01:44.942,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And our dream was for any girl, born any place in the world --

32
0:01:49.935,000 --> 0:01:5,000
if she was good enough --

33
0:01:51.517,000 --> 0:01:55,000
there would be a place for her to compete and for us to make a living.

34
0:01:55.652,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Because before 1968, we made 14 dollars a day,

35
0:01:59.436,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and we were under the control of organizations.

36
0:02:01.912,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So we really wanted to break away from that.

37
0:02:04.129,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But we knew it wasn't really about our generation so much;

38
0:02:06.869,000 --> 0:02:08,000
we knew it was about the future generations.

39
0:02:08.943,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We do stand on the shoulders of the people that came before us, there is no question.

40
0:02:12.972,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But every generation has the chance to make it better.

41
0:02:16.265,000 --> 0:02:18,000
That was really on my mind.

42
0:02:18.706,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I really wanted to start matching the hearts and minds to Title IX.

43
0:02:22.349,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Title IX, in case anybody doesn't know, which a lot of people probably don't,

44
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
said that any federal funds given to a high school, college or university,

45
0:02:30.462,000 --> 0:02:32,000
either public or private,

46
0:02:32.56,000 --> 0:02:36,000
had to -- finally -- give equal monies to boys and girls.

47
0:02:37.909,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And that changed everything.

48
0:02:39.424,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Applause)

49
0:02:42.274,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So you can have a law,

50
0:02:44.056,000 --> 0:02:46,000
but it's changing the hearts and minds to match up with it.

51
0:02:46.995,000 --> 0:02:48,000
That's when it really rocks, totally.

52
0:02:49.566,000 --> 0:02:5,000
So that was on my mind.

53
0:02:50.741,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I wanted to start that change in the hearts and minds.

54
0:02:54.354,000 --> 0:02:56,000
But two things came out of that match.

55
0:02:57.17,000 --> 0:03:,000
For women: self-confidence, empowerment.

56
0:03:00.35,000 --> 0:03:02,000
They actually had enough nerve to ask for a raise.

57
0:03:03.675,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Some women have waited 10, 15 years to ask.

58
0:03:07.838,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I said, "More importantly, did you get it?"

59
0:03:09.863,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

60
0:03:10.955,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And they did!

61
0:03:12.153,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And for the men?

62
0:03:13.971,000 --> 0:03:15,000
A lot of the men today don't realize it,

63
0:03:16.826,000 --> 0:03:21,000
but if you're in your 50s, 60s or whatever, late 40s,

64
0:03:22.255,000 --> 0:03:25,000
you're the first generation of men of the Women's Movement --

65
0:03:25.855,000 --> 0:03:26,000
whether you like it or not!

66
0:03:27.171,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:30.217,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Applause)

68
0:03:31.524,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And for the men,

69
0:03:32.699,000 --> 0:03:34,000
what happened for the men, they'd come up to me --

70
0:03:35.338,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and most times, the men are the ones who have tears in their eyes,

71
0:03:38.463,000 --> 0:03:39,000
it's very interesting.

72
0:03:39.638,000 --> 0:03:43,000
They go, "Billie, I was very young when I saw that match,

73
0:03:43.675,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and now I have a daughter.

74
0:03:47.193,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And I am so happy I saw that as a young man."

75
0:03:50.588,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And one of those young men, at 12 years old, was President Obama.

76
0:03:54.934,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And he actually told me that when I met him, he said:

77
0:03:57.678,000 --> 0:03:59,000
"You don't realize it, but I saw that match at 12.

78
0:04:00.66,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And now I have two daughters,

79
0:04:02.537,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and it has made a difference in how I raise them."

80
0:04:04.987,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So both men and women got a lot out of it, but different things.

81
0:04:10.276,000 --> 0:04:13,000
PM: And now there are generations -- at least one or two --

82
0:04:13.455,000 --> 0:04:15,000
who have experienced the equality

83
0:04:16.179,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that Title IX and other fights along the way made possible.

84
0:04:21.089,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And for women, there are generations who have also experienced teamwork.

85
0:04:25.704,000 --> 0:04:29,000
They got to play team sports in a way they hadn't before.

86
0:04:30.146,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So you had a legacy already built in terms of being an athlete,

87
0:04:35.251,000 --> 0:04:4,000
a legacy of the work you did to lobby for equal pay for women athletes

88
0:04:40.53,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and the Women's Sports Foundation.

89
0:04:43.368,000 --> 0:04:45,000
What now are you looking to accomplish

90
0:04:46.094,000 --> 0:04:48,000
with The Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative?

91
0:04:49.36,000 --> 0:04:51,000
BJK: I think it goes back to an epiphany I had at 12.

92
0:04:52.232,000 --> 0:04:55,000
At 11, I wanted to be the number one tennis player in the world,

93
0:04:55.257,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and a friend had asked me to play and I said, "What's that?"

94
0:04:59.098,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Tennis was not in my family -- basketball was, other sports.

95
0:05:02.597,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Fast forward to 12 years old,

96
0:05:04.489,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:06.11,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and I'm finally starting to play in tournaments

98
0:05:08.348,000 --> 0:05:1,000
where you get a ranking at the end of the year.

99
0:05:11.432,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So I was daydreaming at the Los Angeles Tennis Club,

100
0:05:14.825,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and I started thinking about my sport and how tiny it was,

101
0:05:19.613,000 --> 0:05:22,000
but also that everybody who played wore white shoes, white clothes,

102
0:05:23.286,000 --> 0:05:25,000
played with white balls -- everybody who played was white.

103
0:05:26.88,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And I said to myself, at 12 years old, "Where is everyone else?"

104
0:05:34.222,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And that just kept sticking in my brain.

105
0:05:37.397,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And that moment,

106
0:05:38.572,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I promised myself I'd fight for equal rights and opportunities

107
0:05:41.55,000 --> 0:05:43,000
for boys and girls, men and women, the rest of my life.

108
0:05:44.779,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And that tennis, if I was fortunate enough to become number one --

109
0:05:49.015,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and I knew, being a girl, it would be harder to have influence,

110
0:05:52.53,000 --> 0:05:53,000
already at that age --

111
0:05:54.531,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that I had this platform.

112
0:05:58.301,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And tennis is global.

113
0:06:01.451,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And I thought, "You know what?

114
0:06:04.163,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I've been given an opportunity that very few people have had."

115
0:06:07.115,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I didn't know if I was going to make it -- this was only 12.

116
0:06:10.094,000 --> 0:06:13,000
I sure wanted it, but making it is a whole other discussion.

117
0:06:13.246,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I just remember I promised myself, and I really try to keep my word.

118
0:06:18.174,000 --> 0:06:21,000
That's who I truly am, just fighting for people.

119
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And, unfortunately, women have had less.

120
0:06:27.031,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And we are considered less.

121
0:06:29.324,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And so my attentions, where did they have to go?

122
0:06:31.616,000 --> 0:06:33,000
It was just ... you have to.

123
0:06:33.825,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And learn to stick up for yourself, hear your own voice.

124
0:06:37.08,000 --> 0:06:4,000
You hear the same words keep coming out all the time,

125
0:06:40.441,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and I got really lucky because I had an education.

126
0:06:44.182,000 --> 0:06:46,000
And I think if you can see it you can be it, you know?

127
0:06:46.774,000 --> 0:06:48,000
If you can see it, you can be it.

128
0:06:49.014,000 --> 0:06:51,000
You look at Pat, you look at other leaders,

129
0:06:51.042,000 --> 0:06:53,000
you look at these speakers, look at yourself,

130
0:06:53.212,000 --> 0:06:54,000
because everyone --

131
0:06:54.894,000 --> 0:06:55,000
everyone --

132
0:06:56.276,000 --> 0:06:57,000
can do something extraordinary.

133
0:06:58.113,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Every single person.

134
0:06:59.579,000 --> 0:07:03,000
PM: And your story, Billie, has inspired so many women everywhere.

135
0:07:04.287,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now with the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative,

136
0:07:07.182,000 --> 0:07:09,000
you're taking on an even bigger cause.

137
0:07:09.39,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Because one thing we hear a lot about is women taking their voice,

138
0:07:13.438,000 --> 0:07:16,000
working to find their way into leadership positions.

139
0:07:16.889,000 --> 0:07:18,000
But what you're talking about is even bigger than that.

140
0:07:19.745,000 --> 0:07:21,000
It's inclusive leadership.

141
0:07:21.998,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And this is a generation that has grown up thinking more inclusively --

142
0:07:25.612,000 --> 0:07:27,000
BJK: Isn't it great? Look at the technology!

143
0:07:27.757,000 --> 0:07:31,000
It's amazing how it connects us all! It's about connection.

144
0:07:32.333,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It's simply amazing what's possible because of it.

145
0:07:35.971,000 --> 0:07:37,000
But the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative

146
0:07:38.435,000 --> 0:07:41,000
is really about the workforce mostly, and trying to change it,

147
0:07:41.523,000 --> 0:07:45,000
so people can actually go to work and be their authentic selves.

148
0:07:45.892,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Because most of us have two jobs:

149
0:07:48.953,000 --> 0:07:5,000
One, to fit in -- I'll give you a perfect example.

150
0:07:51.596,000 --> 0:07:54,000
An African American woman gets up an hour earlier to go to work,

151
0:07:54.951,000 --> 0:07:55,000
straightens her hair in the bathroom,

152
0:07:56.776,000 --> 0:07:59,000
goes to the bathroom probably four, five, six times a day

153
0:07:59.983,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to keep straightening her hair, to keep making sure she fits in.

154
0:08:03.095,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So she's working two jobs.

155
0:08:04.389,000 --> 0:08:06,000
She's got this other job, whatever that may be,

156
0:08:06.798,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but she's also trying to fit in.

157
0:08:09.032,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Or this poor man who kept his diploma --

158
0:08:13.099,000 --> 0:08:14,000
he went to University of Michigan,

159
0:08:14.839,000 --> 0:08:17,000
but he never would talk about his poverty as a youngster, ever --

160
0:08:18.184,000 --> 0:08:19,000
just would not mention it.

161
0:08:19.527,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So he made sure they saw he was well-educated.

162
0:08:22.338,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And then you see a gay guy who has an NFL --

163
0:08:24.806,000 --> 0:08:26,000
which means American football for all of you out there,

164
0:08:27.471,000 --> 0:08:28,000
it's a big deal, it's very macho --

165
0:08:29.447,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and he talked about football all the time,

166
0:08:31.493,000 --> 0:08:34,000
because he was gay and he didn't want anybody to know.

167
0:08:35.097,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It just goes on and on.

168
0:08:36.898,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So my wish for everyone is to be able to be their authentic self 24/7,

169
0:08:43.035,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that would be the ultimate.

170
0:08:44.865,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And we catch ourselves -- I mean, I catch myself to this day.

171
0:08:48.415,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Even being gay I catch myself, you know, like,

172
0:08:50.586,000 --> 0:08:51,000
(Gasp)

173
0:08:52.464,000 --> 0:08:55,000
a little uncomfortable, a little surge in my gut,

174
0:08:55.576,000 --> 0:08:58,000
feeling not totally comfortable in my own skin.

175
0:09:00.655,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So, I think you have to ask yourself --

176
0:09:02.908,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I want people to be themselves, whatever that is, just let it be.

177
0:09:06.079,000 --> 0:09:09,000
PM: And the first research the Leadership Initiative did showed that,

178
0:09:09.815,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that these examples you just used --

179
0:09:13.075,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that many of us have the problem of being authentic.

180
0:09:17.904,000 --> 0:09:21,000
But what you've just looked at is this millennial generation,

181
0:09:21.953,000 --> 0:09:24,000
who have benefited from all these equal opportunities --

182
0:09:25.515,000 --> 0:09:27,000
which may not be equal but exist everywhere --

183
0:09:27.7,000 --> 0:09:28,000
BJK: First of all, I'm really lucky.

184
0:09:29.443,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Partnership with Teneo, a strategic company that's amazing.

185
0:09:33.999,000 --> 0:09:35,000
That's really the reason I'm able to do this.

186
0:09:36.517,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I've had two times in my life

187
0:09:38.002,000 --> 0:09:4,000
where I've actually had men really behind me with power.

188
0:09:40.712,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And that was in the old days with Philip Morris with Virginia Slims,

189
0:09:44.026,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and this is the second time in my entire life.

190
0:09:46.384,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And then Deloitte.

191
0:09:49.157,000 --> 0:09:51,000
The one thing I wanted was data -- facts.

192
0:09:52.465,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So Deloitte sent out a survey,

193
0:09:54.216,000 --> 0:09:58,000
and over 4,000 people now have answered,

194
0:09:58.245,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and we're continuing in the workplace.

195
0:10:00.871,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And what do the millennials feel?

196
0:10:04.157,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Well, they feel a lot, but what they're so fantastic about is --

197
0:10:07.442,000 --> 0:10:1,000
you know, our generation was like, "Oh, we're going to get representation."

198
0:10:10.995,000 --> 0:10:12,000
So if you walk into a room, you see everybody represented.

199
0:10:13.807,000 --> 0:10:15,000
That's not good enough anymore, which is so good!

200
0:10:16.301,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So the millennials are fantastic; they want connection, engagement.

201
0:10:20.545,000 --> 0:10:23,000
They just want you to tell us what you're feeling, what you're thinking,

202
0:10:23.993,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and get into the solution.

203
0:10:25.27,000 --> 0:10:26,000
They're problem-solvers,

204
0:10:26.532,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and of course, you've got the information at your fingertips,

205
0:10:29.431,000 --> 0:10:31,000
compared to when I was growing up.

206
0:10:32.157,000 --> 0:10:34,000
PM: What did the research show you about millennials?

207
0:10:34.709,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Are they going to make a difference?

208
0:10:36.452,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Are they going to create a world where there is really an inclusive work force?

209
0:10:40.493,000 --> 0:10:45,000
BJK: Well, in 2025, 75 percent of the global workforce

210
0:10:46.409,000 --> 0:10:47,000
is going to be millennials.

211
0:10:48.202,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I think they are going to help solve problems.

212
0:10:50.513,000 --> 0:10:52,000
I think they have the wherewithal to do it.

213
0:10:52.633,000 --> 0:10:53,000
I know they care a lot.

214
0:10:54.228,000 --> 0:10:58,000
They have big ideas and they can make big things happen.

215
0:10:59.049,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I want to stay in the now with the young people,

216
0:11:01.391,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I don't want to get behind.

217
0:11:04.673,000 --> 0:11:05,000
(Laughter)

218
0:11:06.368,000 --> 0:11:07,000
PM: I don't think there's any chance!

219
0:11:09.604,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But what you found out in the research about millennials

220
0:11:12.623,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is not really the experience that a lot of people have with millennials.

221
0:11:17.274,000 --> 0:11:2,000
BJK: No, well, if we want to talk -- OK, I've been doing my little mini-survey.

222
0:11:21.062,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I've been talking to the Boomers, who are their bosses, and I go,

223
0:11:25.969,000 --> 0:11:27,000
"What do you think about the millennials?"

224
0:11:28.039,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And I'm pretty excited, like it's good,

225
0:11:29.939,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and they get this face --

226
0:11:31.419,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Laughter)

227
0:11:33.759,000 --> 0:11:34,000
"Oh, you mean the 'Me' generation?"

228
0:11:35.465,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:37.07,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I say, "Do you really think so?

230
0:11:38.582,000 --> 0:11:4,000
Because I do think they care about the environment

231
0:11:41.488,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and all these things."

232
0:11:43.442,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And they go, "Oh, Billie, they cannot focus."

233
0:11:47.951,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Laughter)

234
0:11:50.677,000 --> 0:11:51,000
They actually have proven

235
0:11:52.32,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that the average focus for an 18-year-old is 37 seconds.

236
0:11:55.838,000 --> 0:11:56,000
(Laughter)

237
0:11:57.431,000 --> 0:11:58,000
They can't focus.

238
0:11:58.854,000 --> 0:11:59,000
And they don't really care.

239
0:12:00.287,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I just heard a story the other night:

240
0:12:02.152,000 --> 0:12:04,000
a woman owns a gallery and she has these workers.

241
0:12:05.547,000 --> 0:12:08,000
She gets a text from one of the workers,

242
0:12:08.736,000 --> 0:12:1,000
like an intern, she's just starting -- she goes,

243
0:12:11.408,000 --> 0:12:14,000
"Oh, by the way, I'm going to be late because I'm at the hairdresser's."

244
0:12:14.815,000 --> 0:12:18,000
(Laughter)

245
0:12:19.751,000 --> 0:12:22,000
So she arrives, and this boss says,

246
0:12:23.587,000 --> 0:12:24,000
"What's going on?"

247
0:12:24.762,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And she says, "Oh, I was late, sorry, how's it going?"

248
0:12:27.312,000 --> 0:12:31,000
She says, "Well, guess what? I'd like you leave, you're finished."

249
0:12:31.436,000 --> 0:12:32,000
She goes, "OK."

250
0:12:32.826,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Laughter)

251
0:12:36.052,000 --> 0:12:37,000
No problem!

252
0:12:37.227,000 --> 0:12:38,000
PM: Now Billie, that story --

253
0:12:38.673,000 --> 0:12:4,000
I know, but that's what scares the boomers --

254
0:12:41.131,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I'm just telling you -- so I think it's good for us to share.

255
0:12:44.018,000 --> 0:12:45,000
(Laughter)

256
0:12:45.611,000 --> 0:12:46,000
No, it is good for us to share,

257
0:12:47.118,000 --> 0:12:5,000
because we're our authentic selves and what we're really feeling,

258
0:12:50.211,000 --> 0:12:52,000
so we've got to take it both ways, you know?

259
0:12:52.508,000 --> 0:12:53,000
But I have great faith because --

260
0:12:54.479,000 --> 0:12:56,000
if you've been in sports like I have --

261
0:12:57.396,000 --> 0:12:58,000
every generation gets better.

262
0:12:59.053,000 --> 0:13:,000
It's a fact.

263
0:13:00.362,000 --> 0:13:04,000
With the Women's Sports Foundation being the advocates for Title IX still,

264
0:13:04.395,000 --> 0:13:06,000
because we're trying to keep protecting the law,

265
0:13:06.672,000 --> 0:13:09,000
because it's in a tenuous position always,

266
0:13:09.841,000 --> 0:13:1,000
so we really are concerned,

267
0:13:11.745,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and we do a lot of research.

268
0:13:13.46,000 --> 0:13:14,000
That's very important to us.

269
0:13:15.158,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And I want to hear from people.

270
0:13:17.407,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But we really have to protect what Title IX stands for worldwide.

271
0:13:22.88,000 --> 0:13:26,000
And you heard President Carter talk about how Title IX is protected.

272
0:13:28.598,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And do you know that every single lawsuit

273
0:13:32.216,000 --> 0:13:35,000
that girls, at least in sports, have gone up against --

274
0:13:35.758,000 --> 0:13:37,000
whatever institutions --

275
0:13:38.191,000 --> 0:13:39,000
has won?

276
0:13:39.616,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Title IX is there to protect us.

277
0:13:42.199,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And it is amazing.

278
0:13:43.812,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But we still have to get the hearts and minds --

279
0:13:47.812,000 --> 0:13:49,000
the hearts and minds to match the legislation is huge.

280
0:13:50.573,000 --> 0:13:52,000
PM: So what gets you up every morning?

281
0:13:52.68,000 --> 0:13:54,000
What keeps you sustaining your work,

282
0:13:55.136,000 --> 0:13:58,000
sustaining the fight for equality, extending it,

283
0:13:58.358,000 --> 0:14:01,000
always exploring new areas, trying to find new ways ... ?

284
0:14:01.813,000 --> 0:14:04,000
BJK: Well, I always drove my parents crazy because I was always the curious one.

285
0:14:06.678,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I'm highly motivated.

286
0:14:08.446,000 --> 0:14:11,000
My younger brother was a Major League Baseball player.

287
0:14:12.745,000 --> 0:14:14,000
My poor parents did not care if we were any good.

288
0:14:15.32,000 --> 0:14:16,000
(Laughter)

289
0:14:16.586,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And we drove them crazy because we pushed,

290
0:14:19.349,000 --> 0:14:21,000
we pushed because we wanted to be the best.

291
0:14:24.587,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And I think it's because of what I'm hearing today in TED talks.

292
0:14:29.858,000 --> 0:14:32,000
I think to listen to these different women,

293
0:14:33.538,000 --> 0:14:34,000
to listen to different people,

294
0:14:35.042,000 --> 0:14:38,000
to listen to President Carter -- 90 years old, by the way,

295
0:14:38.312,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and he we was throwing these figures out that I would never --

296
0:14:41.808,000 --> 0:14:42,000
I'd have to go,

297
0:14:42.986,000 --> 0:14:45,000
"Excuse me, wait a minute, I need to get a list out of these figures."

298
0:14:46.301,000 --> 0:14:48,000
He was rattling off -- I mean, that's amazing, I'm sorry.

299
0:14:49.931,000 --> 0:14:5,000
PM: He's an amazing man.

300
0:14:51.353,000 --> 0:14:53,000
(Applause)

301
0:14:54.085,000 --> 0:14:57,000
BJK: And then you're going to have President Mary Robinson,

302
0:14:57.501,000 --> 0:14:58,000
who's a former president --

303
0:14:59.41,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Thank you, Irish! 62 percent! LGBTQ! Yes!

304
0:15:04.316,000 --> 0:15:05,000
(Applause)

305
0:15:05.494,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Congress is voting in June on same-sex marriage,

306
0:15:08.935,000 --> 0:15:11,000
so these are things that for some people are very hard to hear.

307
0:15:12.895,000 --> 0:15:14,000
But always remember, every one of us is an individual,

308
0:15:15.7,000 --> 0:15:16,000
a human being with a beating heart,

309
0:15:17.396,000 --> 0:15:21,000
who cares and wants to live their authentic life.

310
0:15:22.258,000 --> 0:15:24,000
OK? You don't have to agree with somebody,

311
0:15:24.398,000 --> 0:15:25,000
but everyone has the opportunity.

312
0:15:27.824,000 --> 0:15:3,000
I think we all have an obligation

313
0:15:31.023,000 --> 0:15:35,000
to continue to keep moving the needle forward, always.

314
0:15:35.911,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And these people have been so inspiring.

315
0:15:38.705,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Everyone matters.

316
0:15:39.887,000 --> 0:15:4,000
And every one of you is an influencer.

317
0:15:41.788,000 --> 0:15:44,000
You out there listening, out there in the world, plus the people here --

318
0:15:45.222,000 --> 0:15:46,000
every single person's an influencer.

319
0:15:47.061,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Never, ever forget that. OK?

320
0:15:49.603,000 --> 0:15:51,000
So don't ever give up on yourself.

321
0:15:52.622,000 --> 0:15:54,000
PM: Billie, you have been an inspiration for us.

322
0:15:54.924,000 --> 0:15:55,000
BJK: Thanks, Pat!

323
0:15:56.098,000 --> 0:15:59,000
(Applause)

324
0:15:59.937,000 --> 0:16:,000
Thanks, TED!

325
0:16:01.112,000 --> 0:16:02,000
(Applause)

326
0:16:03.128,000 --> 0:16:04,000
Thanks a lot!

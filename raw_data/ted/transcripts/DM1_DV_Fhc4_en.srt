1
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'd like to start by asking you all to go to your happy place, please.

2
0:00:17.44,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Yes, your happy place,

3
0:00:18.68,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I know you've got one even if it's fake.

4
0:00:20.64,000 --> 0:00:21,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:21.88,000 --> 0:00:22,000
OK, so, comfortable?

6
0:00:23.2,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Good.

7
0:00:24.44,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Now I'd like to you to mentally answer the following questions.

8
0:00:27.88,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Is there any strip lighting in your happy place?

9
0:00:31.08,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Any plastic tables?

10
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Polyester flooring?

11
0:00:35,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Mobile phones?

12
0:00:36.52,000 --> 0:00:37,000
No?

13
0:00:37.76,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I think we all know that our happy place

14
0:00:39.689,000 --> 0:00:41,000
is meant to be somewhere natural, outdoors --

15
0:00:42.52,000 --> 0:00:43,000
on a beach, fireside.

16
0:00:44.159,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We'll be reading or eating or knitting.

17
0:00:48.28,000 --> 0:00:52,000
And we're surrounded by natural light and organic elements.

18
0:00:52.68,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Natural things make us happy.

19
0:00:55.32,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And happiness is a great motivator; we strive for happiness.

20
0:00:59.2,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Perhaps that's why we're always redesigning everything,

21
0:01:01.84,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in the hopes that our solutions might feel more natural.

22
0:01:06.88,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So let's start there --

23
0:01:08.36,000 --> 0:01:11,000
with the idea that good design should feel natural.

24
0:01:12.8,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Your phone is not very natural.

25
0:01:17.099,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And you probably think you're addicted to your phone,

26
0:01:19.6,000 --> 0:01:2,000
but you're really not.

27
0:01:21.24,000 --> 0:01:23,000
We're not addicted to devices,

28
0:01:23.32,000 --> 0:01:26,000
we're addicted to the information that flows through them.

29
0:01:26.68,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I wonder how long you would be happy in your happy place

30
0:01:29.68,000 --> 0:01:32,000
without any information from the outside world.

31
0:01:33.52,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I'm interested in how we access that information,

32
0:01:35.84,000 --> 0:01:37,000
how we experience it.

33
0:01:37.88,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We're moving from a time of static information,

34
0:01:41.92,000 --> 0:01:43,000
held in books and libraries and bus stops,

35
0:01:44.92,000 --> 0:01:46,000
through a period of digital information,

36
0:01:47.2,000 --> 0:01:49,000
towards a period of fluid information,

37
0:01:49.48,000 --> 0:01:55,000
where your children will expect to be able to access anything, anywhere at any time,

38
0:01:55.72,000 --> 0:01:58,000
from quantum physics to medieval viticulture,

39
0:01:59.64,000 --> 0:02:02,000
from gender theory to tomorrow's weather,

40
0:02:03.52,000 --> 0:02:05,000
just like switching on a lightbulb --

41
0:02:06.68,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Imagine that.

42
0:02:08.12,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Humans also like simple tools.

43
0:02:11.32,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Your phone is not a very simple tool.

44
0:02:14.48,000 --> 0:02:15,000
A fork is a simple tool.

45
0:02:16.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Laughter)

46
0:02:17.4,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And we don't like them made of plastic,

47
0:02:20.24,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in the same way I don't really like my phone very much --

48
0:02:22.931,000 --> 0:02:25,000
it's not how I want to experience information.

49
0:02:27.48,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I think there are better solutions than a world mediated by screens.

50
0:02:31.6,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I don't hate screens, but I don't feel --

51
0:02:34.04,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and I don't think any of us feel that good

52
0:02:36.08,000 --> 0:02:38,000
about how much time we spend slouched over them.

53
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Fortunately,

54
0:02:41.44,000 --> 0:02:42,000
the big tech companies seem to agree.

55
0:02:43.24,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They're actually heavily invested in touch and speech and gesture,

56
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and also in senses --

57
0:02:49.8,000 --> 0:02:51,000
things that can turn dumb objects, like cups,

58
0:02:52.56,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and imbue them with the magic of the Internet,

59
0:02:56.4,000 --> 0:02:58,000
potentially turning this digital cloud

60
0:02:58.8,000 --> 0:03:,000
into something we might touch and move.

61
0:03:01.88,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The parents in crisis over screen time

62
0:03:04.52,000 --> 0:03:07,000
need physical digital toys teaching their kids to read,

63
0:03:07.68,000 --> 0:03:09,000
as well as family-safe app stores.

64
0:03:11.84,000 --> 0:03:13,000
And I think, actually, that's already really happening.

65
0:03:15.72,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Reality is richer than screens.

66
0:03:20.64,000 --> 0:03:22,000
For example, I love books.

67
0:03:24.12,000 --> 0:03:29,000
For me they are time machines -- atoms and molecules bound in space,

68
0:03:29.48,000 --> 0:03:32,000
from the moment of their creation to the moment of my experience.

69
0:03:33.48,000 --> 0:03:34,000
But frankly,

70
0:03:35.04,000 --> 0:03:37,000
the content's identical on my phone.

71
0:03:37.44,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So what makes this a richer experience than a screen?

72
0:03:41.8,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I mean, scientifically.

73
0:03:45.44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
We need screens, of course.

74
0:03:47.32,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I'm going to show film, I need the enormous screen.

75
0:03:52.88,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But there's more than you can do with these magic boxes.

76
0:03:56.88,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Your phone is not the Internet's door bitch.

77
0:03:59.68,000 --> 0:04:,000
(Laughter)

78
0:04:00.92,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We can build things -- physical things,

79
0:04:03.8,000 --> 0:04:05,000
using physics and pixels,

80
0:04:06.32,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that can integrate the Internet into the world around us.

81
0:04:09.011,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And I'm going to show you a few examples of those.

82
0:04:14.48,000 --> 0:04:16,000
A while ago, I got to work with a design agency, Berg,

83
0:04:17.44,000 --> 0:04:21,000
on an exploration of what the Internet without screens might actually look like.

84
0:04:22.28,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And they showed us a range ways

85
0:04:24.36,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that light can work with simple senses and physical objects

86
0:04:29.32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to really bring the Internet to life, to make it tangible.

87
0:04:33.64,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Like this wonderfully mechanical YouTube player.

88
0:04:38.56,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And this was an inspiration to me.

89
0:04:42.6,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Next I worked with the Japanese agency, AQ,

90
0:04:45.56,000 --> 0:04:47,000
on a research project into mental health.

91
0:04:47.92,000 --> 0:04:48,000
We wanted to create an object

92
0:04:49.325,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that could capture the subjective data around mood swings

93
0:04:53.08,000 --> 0:04:55,000
that's so essential to diagnosis.

94
0:04:56.04,000 --> 0:04:58,000
This object captures your touch,

95
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
so you might press it very hard if you're angry,

96
0:05:01.04,000 --> 0:05:03,000
or stroke it if you're calm.

97
0:05:03.2,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's like a digital emoji stick.

98
0:05:05.84,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And then you might revisit those moments later,

99
0:05:09.04,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and add context to them online.

100
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Most of all,

101
0:05:12.68,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we wanted to create an intimate, beautiful thing

102
0:05:16.2,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that could live in your pocket

103
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and be loved.

104
0:05:20.753,000 --> 0:05:22,000
The binoculars are actually a birthday present

105
0:05:22.92,000 --> 0:05:24,000
for the Sydney Opera House's 40th anniversary.

106
0:05:25.087,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Our friends at Tellart in Boston brought over a pair of street binoculars,

107
0:05:29.08,000 --> 0:05:31,000
the kind you might find on the Empire State Building,

108
0:05:31.581,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and they fitted them with 360-degree views

109
0:05:34.44,000 --> 0:05:36,000
of other iconic world heritage sights --

110
0:05:37.08,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:38.8,000 --> 0:05:4,000
using Street View.

112
0:05:40.84,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And then we stuck them under the steps.

113
0:05:43.92,000 --> 0:05:47,000
So, they became this very physical, simple reappropriation,

114
0:05:48.64,000 --> 0:05:5,000
or like a portal to these other icons.

115
0:05:50.72,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So you might see Versailles or Shackleton's Hut.

116
0:05:53.68,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Basically, it's virtual reality circa 1955.

117
0:05:56.76,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:59.44,000 --> 0:06:02,000
In our office we use hacky sacks to exchange URLs.

119
0:06:02.92,000 --> 0:06:04,000
This is incredibly simple, it's like your Opal card.

120
0:06:05.72,000 --> 0:06:08,000
You basically put a website on the little chip in here,

121
0:06:09.52,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and then you do this and ... bosh! --

122
0:06:13.08,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the website appears on your phone.

123
0:06:15.44,000 --> 0:06:17,000
It's about 10 cents.

124
0:06:17.96,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Treehugger is a project that we're working on

125
0:06:20.08,000 --> 0:06:22,000
with Grumpy Sailor and Finch, here in Sydney.

126
0:06:22.52,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And I'm very excited about what might happen

127
0:06:25.44,000 --> 0:06:28,000
when you pull the phones apart and you put the bits into trees,

128
0:06:29.28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and that my children might have an opportunity

129
0:06:32.2,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to visit an enchanted forest guided by a magic wand,

130
0:06:36.84,000 --> 0:06:39,000
where they could talk to digital fairies and ask them questions,

131
0:06:39.88,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and be asked questions in return.

132
0:06:42.12,000 --> 0:06:43,000
As you can see,

133
0:06:43.36,000 --> 0:06:45,000
we're at the cardboard stage with this one.

134
0:06:45.4,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Laughter)

135
0:06:46.6,000 --> 0:06:47,000
But I'm very excited

136
0:06:47.84,000 --> 0:06:5,000
by the possibility of getting kids back outside without screens,

137
0:06:51.76,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but with all the powerful magic of the Internet at their fingertips.

138
0:06:55.72,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And we hope to have something like this working by the end of the year.

139
0:07:01.6,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So let's recap.

140
0:07:03.84,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Humans like natural solutions.

141
0:07:05.88,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Humans love information.

142
0:07:07.96,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Humans need simple tools.

143
0:07:10.64,000 --> 0:07:14,000
These principles should underpin how we design for the future,

144
0:07:15.64,000 --> 0:07:16,000
not just for the Internet.

145
0:07:18.04,000 --> 0:07:23,000
You may feel uncomfortable about the age of information that we're moving into.

146
0:07:23.72,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You may feel challenged, rather than simply excited.

147
0:07:28.2,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Guess what? Me too.

148
0:07:30.24,000 --> 0:07:33,000
It's a really extraordinary period of human history.

149
0:07:35.84,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We are the people that actually build our world,

150
0:07:39.72,000 --> 0:07:41,000
there are no artificial intelligences...

151
0:07:41.991,000 --> 0:07:42,000
yet.

152
0:07:43.44,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

153
0:07:45.36,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It's us -- designers, architects, artists, engineers.

154
0:07:50.8,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And if we challenge ourselves,

155
0:07:53.32,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I think that actually we can have a happy place

156
0:07:57.28,000 --> 0:07:59,000
filled with the information we love

157
0:07:59.8,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that feels as natural and as simple as switching on lightbulb.

158
0:08:04.64,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And although it may seem inevitable,

159
0:08:06.379,000 --> 0:08:11,000
that what the public wants is watches and websites and widgets,

160
0:08:11.76,000 --> 0:08:17,000
maybe we could give a bit of thought to cork and light and hacky sacks.

161
0:08:17.96,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Thank you very much.

162
0:08:19.32,000 --> 0:08:21,000
(Applause)

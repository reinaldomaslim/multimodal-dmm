1
0:00:12,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'm speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view,

2
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of

3
0:00:2,000 --> 0:00:24,000
as being one that is grounded in compassion.

4
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:26,000
The truth of the matter is otherwise.

5
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Our holy book, the Koran, consists of 114 chapters,

6
0:00:32,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala,

7
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the saying of "In the name of God, the all compassionate, the all merciful,"

8
0:00:42,000 --> 0:00:44,000
or, as Sir Richard Burton --

9
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:47,000
not the Richard Burton who was married to Elizabeth Taylor,

10
0:00:47,000 --> 0:00:5,000
but the Sir Richard Burton who lived a century before that

11
0:00:5,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and who was a worldwide traveler

12
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and translator of many works of literature --

13
0:00:56,000 --> 0:01:03,000
translates it. "In the name of God, the compassionating, the compassionate."

14
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And in a saying of the Koran, which to Muslims is God speaking to humanity,

15
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
God says to his prophet Muhammad --

16
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets,

17
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
beginning with Adam, including Noah, including Moses, including Abraham,

18
0:01:22,000 --> 0:01:26,000
including Jesus Christ, and ending with Muhammad --

19
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
that, "We have not sent you, O Muhammad,

20
0:01:29,000 --> 0:01:35,000
except as a 'rahmah,' except as a source of compassion to humanity."

21
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:39,000
For us human beings, and certainly for us as Muslims,

22
0:01:39,000 --> 0:01:44,000
whose mission, and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet

23
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:48,000
is to make ourselves as much like the prophet.

24
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And the prophet, in one of his sayings, said,

25
0:01:5,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"Adorn yourselves with the attributes of God."

26
0:01:55,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And because God Himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion --

27
0:02:01,000 --> 0:02:06,000
in fact, the Koran says that "God decreed upon himself compassion,"

28
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
or, "reigned himself in by compassion" --

29
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:17,000
therefore, our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion,

30
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:21,000
activators of compassion, actors of compassion

31
0:02:21,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion.

32
0:02:25,000 --> 0:02:28,000
That is all well and good,

33
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but where do we go wrong,

34
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world?

35
0:02:36,000 --> 0:02:41,000
For the answer to this, we turn to our spiritual path.

36
0:02:41,000 --> 0:02:48,000
In every religious tradition, there is the outer path and the inner path,

37
0:02:48,000 --> 0:02:53,000
or the exoteric path and the esoteric path.

38
0:02:53,000 --> 0:03:01,000
The esoteric path of Islam is more popularly known as Sufism, or "tasawwuf" in Arabic.

39
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And these doctors or these masters,

40
0:03:04,000 --> 0:03:08,000
these spiritual masters of the Sufi tradition,

41
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:12,000
refer to teachings and examples of our prophet

42
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that teach us where the source of our problems lies.

43
0:03:16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
In one of the battles that the prophet waged,

44
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:25,000
he told his followers, "We are returning from the lesser war

45
0:03:25,000 --> 0:03:29,000
to the greater war, to the greater battle."

46
0:03:29,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And they said, "Messenger of God, we are battle-weary.

47
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:37,000
How can we go to a greater battle?"

48
0:03:37,000 --> 0:03:45,000
He said, "That is the battle of the self, the battle of the ego."

49
0:03:45,000 --> 0:03:54,000
The sources of human problems have to do with egotism, "I."

50
0:03:54,000 --> 0:04:,000
The famous Sufi master Rumi, who is very well known to most of you,

51
0:04:,000 --> 0:04:06,000
has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend,

52
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and he knocks on the door,

53
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and a voice answers, "Who's there?"

54
0:04:12,000 --> 0:04:17,000
"It's me," or, more grammatically correctly, "It is I,"

55
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:19,000
as we might say in English.

56
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:22,000
The voice says, "Go away."

57
0:04:22,000 --> 0:04:3,000
After many years of training, of disciplining, of search and struggle,

58
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:32,000
he comes back.

59
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:36,000
With much greater humility, he knocks again on the door.

60
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The voice asks, "Who is there?"

61
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:43,000
He said, "It is you, O heartbreaker."

62
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:47,000
The door swings open, and the voice says,

63
0:04:47,000 --> 0:04:54,000
"Come in, for there is no room in this house for two I's,"

64
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:58,000
-- two capital I's, not these eyes -- "for two egos."

65
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And Rumi's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path.

66
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:13,000
In the presence of God, there is no room for more than one "I,"

67
0:05:13,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and that is the "I" of divinity.

68
0:05:18,000 --> 0:05:22,000
In a teaching -- called a "hadith qudsi" in our tradition --

69
0:05:22,000 --> 0:05:28,000
God says that, "My servant," or "My creature, my human creature,

70
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:34,000
does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me

71
0:05:34,000 --> 0:05:37,000
than what I have asked them to do."

72
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And those of you who are employers know exactly what I mean.

73
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You want your employees to do what you ask them to do,

74
0:05:45,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and if they've done that, then they can do extra.

75
0:05:47,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But don't ignore what you've asked them to do.

76
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:56,000
"And," God says, "my servant continues to get nearer to me,

77
0:05:56,000 --> 0:05:59,000
by doing more of what I've asked them to do" --

78
0:05:59,000 --> 0:06:01,000
extra credit, we might call it --

79
0:06:01,000 --> 0:06:05,000
"until I love him or love her.

80
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And when I love my servant," God says,

81
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:14,000
"I become the eyes by which he or she sees,

82
0:06:14,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the ears by which he or she listens,

83
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:25,000
the hand by which he or she grasps,

84
0:06:25,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and the foot by which he or she walks,

85
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the heart by which he or she understands."

86
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It is this merging of our self with divinity

87
0:06:39,000 --> 0:06:47,000
that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions.

88
0:06:47,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Muslims regard Jesus as the master of Sufism,

89
0:06:53,000 --> 0:07:,000
the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path.

90
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:04,000
When he says, "I am the spirit, and I am the way,"

91
0:07:04,000 --> 0:07:09,000
and when the prophet Muhammad said, "Whoever has seen me has seen God,"

92
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:14,000
it is because they became so much an instrument of God,

93
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:16,000
they became part of God's team --

94
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:2,000
so that God's will was manifest through them,

95
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos.

96
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Compassion on earth is given, it is in us.

97
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:36,000
All we have to do is to get our egos out of the way,

98
0:07:36,000 --> 0:07:39,000
get our egotism out of the way.

99
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I'm sure, probably all of you here, or certainly the very vast majority of you,

100
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:51,000
have had what you might call a spiritual experience,

101
0:07:51,000 --> 0:07:58,000
a moment in your lives when, for a few seconds, a minute perhaps,

102
0:07:58,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the boundaries of your ego dissolved.

103
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And at that minute, you felt at one with the universe --

104
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:17,000
one with that jug of water, one with every human being,

105
0:08:17,000 --> 0:08:21,000
one with the Creator --

106
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and you felt you were in the presence of power, of awe,

107
0:08:26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
of the deepest love, the deepest sense of compassion and mercy

108
0:08:3,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that you have ever experienced in your lives.

109
0:08:34,000 --> 0:08:4,000
That is a moment which is a gift of God to us --

110
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:44,000
a gift when, for a moment, he lifts that boundary

111
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:5,000
which makes us insist on "I, I, I, me, me, me,"

112
0:08:5,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and instead, like the person in Rumi's story,

113
0:08:54,000 --> 0:09:,000
we say, "Oh, this is all you.

114
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:02,000
This is all you. And this is all us.

115
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And us, and I, and us are all part of you.

116
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:14,000
O, Creator! O, the Objective! The source of our being

117
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and the end of our journey,

118
0:09:16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
you are also the breaker of our hearts.

119
0:09:21,000 --> 0:09:27,000
You are the one whom we should all be towards, for whose purpose we live,

120
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and for whose purpose we shall die,

121
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again

122
0:09:35,000 --> 0:09:42,000
to account to God to what extent we have been compassionate beings."

123
0:09:42,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Our message today, and our purpose today,

124
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and those of you who are here today,

125
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and the purpose of this charter of compassion, is to remind.

126
0:09:54,000 --> 0:10:02,000
For the Koran always urges us to remember, to remind each other,

127
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:1,000
because the knowledge of truth is within every human being.

128
0:10:1,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We know it all.

129
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We have access to it all.

130
0:10:15,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Jung may have called it "the subconscious."

131
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Through our subconscious, in your dreams --

132
0:10:23,000 --> 0:10:31,000
the Koran calls our state of sleep "the lesser death,"

133
0:10:31,000 --> 0:10:35,000
"the temporary death" --

134
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:4,000
in our state of sleep we have dreams, we have visions,

135
0:10:4,000 --> 0:10:46,000
we travel even outside of our bodies, for many of us,

136
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and we see wonderful things.

137
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:54,000
We travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it,

138
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and beyond the limitations of time as we know it.

139
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator

140
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:14,000
whose primary name is the compassionating, the compassionate.

141
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:21,000
God, Bokh, whatever name you want to call him with, Allah, Ram, Om,

142
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
whatever the name might be through which you name

143
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:28,000
or access the presence of divinity,

144
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:34,000
it is the locus of absolute being,

145
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:38,000
absolute love and mercy and compassion,

146
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and absolute knowledge and wisdom,

147
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:44,000
what Hindus call "satchidananda."

148
0:11:44,000 --> 0:11:47,000
The language differs,

149
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:51,000
but the objective is the same.

150
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Rumi has another story

151
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:56,000
about three men, a Turk, an Arab and --

152
0:11:56,000 --> 0:12:,000
and I forget the third person, but for my sake, it could be a Malay.

153
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:03,000
One is asking for angur -- one is, say, an Englishman --

154
0:12:03,000 --> 0:12:08,000
one is asking for eneb, and one is asking for grapes.

155
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:11,000
And they have a fight and an argument because

156
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:15,000
-- "I want grapes." "I want eneb. "I want angur." --

157
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:18,000
not knowing that the word that they're using

158
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:21,000
refers to the same reality in different languages.

159
0:12:21,000 --> 0:12:27,000
There's only one absolute reality by definition,

160
0:12:27,000 --> 0:12:3,000
one absolute being by definition,

161
0:12:3,000 --> 0:12:33,000
because absolute is, by definition, single,

162
0:12:33,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and absolute and singular.

163
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:39,000
There's this absolute concentration of being,

164
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:42,000
the absolute concentration of consciousness,

165
0:12:42,000 --> 0:12:52,000
awareness, an absolute locus of compassion and love

166
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:56,000
that defines the primary attributes of divinity.

167
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And these should also be

168
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:04,000
the primary attributes of what it means to be human.

169
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:1,000
For what defines humanity, perhaps biologically,

170
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:13,000
is our physiology,

171
0:13:13,000 --> 0:13:21,000
but God defines humanity by our spirituality, by our nature.

172
0:13:21,000 --> 0:13:25,000
And the Koran says, He speaks to the angels and says,

173
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:29,000
"When I have finished the formation of Adam from clay,

174
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and breathed into him of my spirit,

175
0:13:33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
then, fall in prostration to him."

176
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:45,000
The angels prostrate, not before the human body,

177
0:13:45,000 --> 0:13:48,000
but before the human soul.

178
0:13:48,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Why? Because the soul, the human soul,

179
0:13:52,000 --> 0:13:58,000
embodies a piece of the divine breath,

180
0:13:58,000 --> 0:14:01,000
a piece of the divine soul.

181
0:14:01,000 --> 0:14:06,000
This is also expressed in biblical vocabulary

182
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:12,000
when we are taught that we were created in the divine image.

183
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:14,000
What is the imagery of God?

184
0:14:14,000 --> 0:14:18,000
The imagery of God is absolute being,

185
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:21,000
absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom

186
0:14:21,000 --> 0:14:24,000
and absolute compassion and love.

187
0:14:24,000 --> 0:14:28,000
And therefore, for us to be human --

188
0:14:28,000 --> 0:14:32,000
in the greatest sense of what it means to be human,

189
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:35,000
in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human --

190
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:41,000
means that we too have to be proper stewards

191
0:14:41,000 --> 0:14:45,000
of the breath of divinity within us,

192
0:14:45,000 --> 0:14:5,000
and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being,

193
0:14:5,000 --> 0:14:53,000
of being alive, of beingness;

194
0:14:53,000 --> 0:14:58,000
the attribute of wisdom, of consciousness, of awareness;

195
0:14:58,000 --> 0:15:03,000
and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings.

196
0:15:03,000 --> 0:15:09,000
This is what I understand from my faith tradition,

197
0:15:09,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions,

198
0:15:16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and this is the common platform on which we must all stand,

199
0:15:22,000 --> 0:15:25,000
and when we stand on this platform as such,

200
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world.

201
0:15:31,000 --> 0:15:37,000
And I believe, personally, that we're on the verge

202
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and that, with the presence and help of people like you here,

203
0:15:41,000 --> 0:15:47,000
we can bring about the prophecy of Isaiah.

204
0:15:47,000 --> 0:15:51,000
For he foretold of a period

205
0:15:51,000 --> 0:15:58,000
when people shall transform their swords into plowshares

206
0:15:58,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and will not learn war or make war anymore.

207
0:16:04,000 --> 0:16:1,000
We have reached a stage in human history that we have no option:

208
0:16:1,000 --> 0:16:19,000
we must, we must lower our egos,

209
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:24,000
control our egos -- whether it is individual ego, personal ego,

210
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:3,000
family ego, national ego --

211
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and let all be for the glorification of the one.

212
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Thank you, and God bless you.

213
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:38,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.8,000 --> 0:00:17,000
15 years ago, I volunteered to participate in a research study

2
0:00:18.08,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that involved a genetic test.

3
0:00:20.64,000 --> 0:00:22,000
When I arrived at the clinic to be tested,

4
0:00:22.672,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I was handed a questionnaire.

5
0:00:25.08,000 --> 0:00:29,000
One of the very first questions asked me to check a box for my race:

6
0:00:29.32,000 --> 0:00:32,000
White, black, Asian, or Native American.

7
0:00:33.68,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I wasn't quite sure how to answer the question.

8
0:00:37.2,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Was it aimed at measuring the diversity

9
0:00:39.6,000 --> 0:00:42,000
of research participants' social backgrounds?

10
0:00:43.2,000 --> 0:00:46,000
In that case, I would answer with my social identity,

11
0:00:46.84,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and check the box for "black."

12
0:00:49.48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
But what if the researchers were interested in investigating

13
0:00:53.04,000 --> 0:00:59,000
some association between ancestry and the risk for certain genetic traits?

14
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
In that case, wouldn't they want to know something about my ancestry,

15
0:01:03.72,000 --> 0:01:06,000
which is just as much European as African?

16
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And how could they make scientific findings about my genes

17
0:01:11.64,000 --> 0:01:15,000
if I put down my social identity as a black woman?

18
0:01:16.48,000 --> 0:01:21,000
After all, I consider myself a black woman with a white father

19
0:01:21.64,000 --> 0:01:24,000
rather than a white woman with a black mother

20
0:01:25.08,000 --> 0:01:27,000
entirely for social reasons.

21
0:01:27.8,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Which racial identity I check

22
0:01:30.28,000 --> 0:01:32,000
has nothing to do with my genes.

23
0:01:34.08,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Well, despite the obvious importance of this question

24
0:01:37.48,000 --> 0:01:39,000
to the study's scientific validity,

25
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I was told, "Don't worry about it,

26
0:01:42.56,000 --> 0:01:44,000
just put down however you identify yourself."

27
0:01:46.2,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So I check "black,"

28
0:01:48.6,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but I had no confidence in the results of a study

29
0:01:52.32,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that treated a critical variable so unscientifically.

30
0:01:58.36,000 --> 0:02:02,000
That personal experience with the use of race in genetic testing

31
0:02:02.72,000 --> 0:02:03,000
got me thinking:

32
0:02:04.32,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Where else in medicine is race used to make false biological predictions?

33
0:02:10.72,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Well, I found out that race runs deeply throughout all of medical practice.

34
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It shapes physicians' diagnoses,

35
0:02:20.039,000 --> 0:02:22,000
measurements, treatments,

36
0:02:22.68,000 --> 0:02:23,000
prescriptions,

37
0:02:24.32,000 --> 0:02:27,000
even the very definition of diseases.

38
0:02:28.4,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And the more I found out, the more disturbed I became.

39
0:02:33.72,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Sociologists like me have long explained

40
0:02:36.84,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that race is a social construction.

41
0:02:39.76,000 --> 0:02:45,000
When we identify people as black, white, Asian, Native American, Latina,

42
0:02:46.28,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we're referring to social groupings

43
0:02:49.04,000 --> 0:02:52,000
with made up demarcations that have changed over time

44
0:02:52.76,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and vary around the world.

45
0:02:55.32,000 --> 0:02:58,000
As a legal scholar, I've also studied

46
0:02:58.56,000 --> 0:03:,000
how lawmakers, not biologists,

47
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
have invented the legal definitions of races.

48
0:03:06.64,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And it's not just the view of social scientists.

49
0:03:10.12,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You remember when the map of the human genome

50
0:03:12.76,000 --> 0:03:16,000
was unveiled at a White House ceremony in June 2000?

51
0:03:17.04,000 --> 0:03:2,000
President Bill Clinton famously declared,

52
0:03:20.68,000 --> 0:03:22,000
"I believe one of the great truths

53
0:03:22.88,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to emerge from this triumphant expedition

54
0:03:26.08,000 --> 0:03:27,000
inside the human genome

55
0:03:27.92,000 --> 0:03:28,000
is that in genetic terms,

56
0:03:29.8,000 --> 0:03:31,000
human beings, regardless of race,

57
0:03:32.64,000 --> 0:03:35,000
are more than 99.9 percent the same."

58
0:03:36.92,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And he might have added

59
0:03:38.52,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that that less than one percent of genetic difference

60
0:03:42.24,000 --> 0:03:44,000
doesn't fall into racial boxes.

61
0:03:45.44,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Francis Collins, who led the Human Genome Project

62
0:03:49.12,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and now heads NIH,

63
0:03:50.84,000 --> 0:03:52,000
echoed President Clinton.

64
0:03:52.92,000 --> 0:03:53,000
"I am happy that today,

65
0:03:54.88,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the only race we're talking about is the human race."

66
0:04:00.4,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Doctors are supposed to practice evidence-based medicine,

67
0:04:04.4,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and they're increasingly called to join the genomic revolution.

68
0:04:08.36,000 --> 0:04:12,000
But their habit of treating patients by race lags far behind.

69
0:04:14.2,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Take the estimate

70
0:04:15.44,000 --> 0:04:18,000
of glomerular filtration rate, or GFR.

71
0:04:18.72,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Doctors routinely interpret GFR,

72
0:04:22.28,000 --> 0:04:26,000
this important indicator of kidney function, by race.

73
0:04:27.84,000 --> 0:04:3,000
As you can see in this lab test,

74
0:04:31.72,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the exact same creatinine level,

75
0:04:36.92,000 --> 0:04:39,000
the concentration in the blood of the patient,

76
0:04:40.72,000 --> 0:04:44,000
automatically produces a different GFR estimate

77
0:04:45.2,000 --> 0:04:49,000
depending on whether or not the patient is African-American.

78
0:04:51.12,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Why?

79
0:04:53.28,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I've been told it's based on an assumption

80
0:04:56.56,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that African-Americans have more muscle mass

81
0:04:59.68,000 --> 0:05:01,000
than people of other races.

82
0:05:02.88,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But what sense does it make

83
0:05:04.72,000 --> 0:05:07,000
for a doctor to automatically assume

84
0:05:08.2,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I have more muscle mass than that female bodybuilder?

85
0:05:12.6,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Wouldn't it be far more accurate and evidence-based

86
0:05:16.6,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to determine the muscle mass of individual patients

87
0:05:20.64,000 --> 0:05:22,000
just by looking at them?

88
0:05:24.36,000 --> 0:05:27,000
Well, doctors tell me they're using race as a shortcut.

89
0:05:27.8,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It's a crude but convenient proxy

90
0:05:30.56,000 --> 0:05:33,000
for more important factors, like muscle mass,

91
0:05:33.84,000 --> 0:05:35,000
enzyme level, genetic traits

92
0:05:36.24,000 --> 0:05:38,000
they just don't have time to look for.

93
0:05:39.6,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But race is a bad proxy.

94
0:05:42.4,000 --> 0:05:46,000
In many cases, race adds no relevant information at all.

95
0:05:46.56,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's just a distraction.

96
0:05:49.6,000 --> 0:05:53,000
But race also tends to overwhelm the clinical measures.

97
0:05:55.44,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It blinds doctors to patients' symptoms,

98
0:05:59.76,000 --> 0:06:,000
family illnesses,

99
0:06:02.44,000 --> 0:06:06,000
their history, their own illnesses they might have --

100
0:06:06.8,000 --> 0:06:09,000
all more evidence-based than the patient's race.

101
0:06:11.92,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Race can't substitute for these important clinical measures

102
0:06:16.72,000 --> 0:06:19,000
without sacrificing patient well-being.

103
0:06:21.8,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Doctors also tell me race is just one of many factors

104
0:06:25.48,000 --> 0:06:26,000
they take into account,

105
0:06:27.04,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but there are numerous medical tests,

106
0:06:29.2,000 --> 0:06:3,000
like the GFR,

107
0:06:30.96,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that use race categorically

108
0:06:34.24,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to treat black, white, Asian patients differently

109
0:06:38.24,000 --> 0:06:4,000
just because of their race.

110
0:06:41.68,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Race medicine also leaves patients of color especially vulnerable

111
0:06:47.2,000 --> 0:06:49,000
to harmful biases and stereotypes.

112
0:06:50.6,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Black and Latino patients are twice as likely

113
0:06:53.92,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to receive no pain medication as whites

114
0:06:57.44,000 --> 0:07:01,000
for the same painful long bone fractures

115
0:07:02.04,000 --> 0:07:04,000
because of stereotypes

116
0:07:04.28,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that black and brown people feel less pain,

117
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:09,000
exaggerate their pain,

118
0:07:10.12,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and are predisposed to drug addiction.

119
0:07:14.32,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The Food and Drug Administration has even approved a race-specific medicine.

120
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It's a pill called BiDil

121
0:07:22.44,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to treat heart failure in self-identified African-American patients.

122
0:07:27.64,000 --> 0:07:33,000
A cardiologist developed this drug without regard to race or genetics,

123
0:07:33.84,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but it became convenient

124
0:07:36.12,000 --> 0:07:37,000
for commercial reasons

125
0:07:38.04,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to market the drug to black patients.

126
0:07:42.36,000 --> 0:07:44,000
The FDA then allowed

127
0:07:44.64,000 --> 0:07:47,000
the company, the drug company,

128
0:07:47.72,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to test the efficacy in a clinical trial

129
0:07:51.36,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that only included African-American subjects.

130
0:07:56.76,000 --> 0:07:57,000
It speculated

131
0:07:58.56,000 --> 0:08:04,000
that race stood in as a proxy for some unknown genetic factor

132
0:08:04.68,000 --> 0:08:06,000
that affects heart disease

133
0:08:07.48,000 --> 0:08:09,000
or response to drugs.

134
0:08:11.56,000 --> 0:08:14,000
But think about the dangerous message it sent,

135
0:08:15.04,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that black people's bodies are so substandard,

136
0:08:19.52,000 --> 0:08:2,000
a drug tested in them

137
0:08:21.24,000 --> 0:08:24,000
is not guaranteed to work in other patients.

138
0:08:26.84,000 --> 0:08:29,000
In the end, the drug company's marketing scheme failed.

139
0:08:30.68,000 --> 0:08:33,000
For one thing, black patients were understandably wary

140
0:08:34.68,000 --> 0:08:37,000
of using a drug just for black people.

141
0:08:38.08,000 --> 0:08:41,000
One elderly black woman stood up in a community meeting and shouted,

142
0:08:42.04,000 --> 0:08:44,000
"Give me what the white people are taking!"

143
0:08:44.52,000 --> 0:08:45,000
(Laughter)

144
0:08:47.559,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And if you find race-specific medicine surprising,

145
0:08:52.2,000 --> 0:08:53,000
wait until you learn

146
0:08:54.159,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that many doctors in the United States

147
0:08:57,000 --> 0:09:,000
still use an updated version

148
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
of a diagnostic tool

149
0:09:02.08,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that was developed by a physician during the slavery era,

150
0:09:06.56,000 --> 0:09:09,000
a diagnostic tool that is tightly linked

151
0:09:09.88,000 --> 0:09:11,000
to justifications for slavery.

152
0:09:13.56,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Dr. Samuel Cartwright graduated

153
0:09:16.24,000 --> 0:09:19,000
from the University of Pennsylvania Medical School.

154
0:09:19.64,000 --> 0:09:22,000
He practiced in the Deep South before the Civil War,

155
0:09:23.24,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and he was a well-known expert on what was then called "Negro medicine."

156
0:09:28.12,000 --> 0:09:31,000
He promoted the racial concept of disease,

157
0:09:31.36,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that people of different races suffer from different diseases

158
0:09:35.08,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and experience common diseases differently.

159
0:09:39.88,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Cartwright argued in the 1850s

160
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that slavery was beneficial for black people

161
0:09:47.2,000 --> 0:09:49,000
for medical reasons.

162
0:09:49.28,000 --> 0:09:53,000
He claimed that because black people have lower lung capacity than whites,

163
0:09:54.2,000 --> 0:09:56,000
forced labor was good for them.

164
0:09:57.84,000 --> 0:09:59,000
He wrote in a medical journal,

165
0:10:00.12,000 --> 0:10:03,000
"It is the red vital blood sent to the brain

166
0:10:03.56,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that liberates their minds when under the white man's control,

167
0:10:07.92,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and it is the want of sufficiency of red vital blood

168
0:10:11.68,000 --> 0:10:15,000
that chains their minds to ignorance and barbarism when in freedom."

169
0:10:17.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
To support this theory, Cartwright helped to perfect

170
0:10:20.32,000 --> 0:10:24,000
a medical device for measuring breathing called the spirometer

171
0:10:26.24,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to show the presumed deficiency in black people's lungs.

172
0:10:31.88,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Today, doctors still uphold Cartwright's claim

173
0:10:37.44,000 --> 0:10:39,000
the black people as a race

174
0:10:40.08,000 --> 0:10:43,000
have lower lung capacity than white people.

175
0:10:44.28,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Some even use a modern day spirometer

176
0:10:48.6,000 --> 0:10:51,000
that actually has a button labeled "race"

177
0:10:52.36,000 --> 0:10:54,000
so the machine adjusts the measurement

178
0:10:55.04,000 --> 0:10:58,000
for each patient according to his or her race.

179
0:10:59.04,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It's a well-known function called "correcting for race."

180
0:11:05.88,000 --> 0:11:1,000
The problem with race medicine extends far beyond misdiagnosing patients.

181
0:11:11.92,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Its focus on innate racial differences in disease

182
0:11:16.4,000 --> 0:11:19,000
diverts attention and resources

183
0:11:19.52,000 --> 0:11:21,000
from the social determinants

184
0:11:21.76,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that cause appalling racial gaps in health:

185
0:11:25.76,000 --> 0:11:28,000
lack of access to high-quality medical care;

186
0:11:29.56,000 --> 0:11:31,000
food deserts in poor neighborhoods;

187
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:36,000
exposure to environmental toxins;

188
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:39,000
high rates of incarceration;

189
0:11:39.92,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and experiencing the stress of racial discrimination.

190
0:11:45.12,000 --> 0:11:48,000
You see, race is not a biological category

191
0:11:48.92,000 --> 0:11:51,000
that naturally produces these health disparities

192
0:11:52.36,000 --> 0:11:54,000
because of genetic difference.

193
0:11:55.24,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Race is a social category

194
0:11:57.88,000 --> 0:12:,000
that has staggering biological consequences,

195
0:12:01.56,000 --> 0:12:05,000
but because of the impact of social inequality on people's health.

196
0:12:07.16,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Yet race medicine pretends the answer to these gaps in health

197
0:12:11.32,000 --> 0:12:14,000
can be found in a race-specific pill.

198
0:12:14.56,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It's much easier and more lucrative

199
0:12:17.32,000 --> 0:12:19,000
to market a technological fix

200
0:12:20.68,000 --> 0:12:22,000
for these gaps in health

201
0:12:22.84,000 --> 0:12:26,000
than to deal with the structural inequities that produce them.

202
0:12:29.96,000 --> 0:12:33,000
The reason I'm so passionate about ending race medicine

203
0:12:34.32,000 --> 0:12:37,000
isn't just because it's bad medicine.

204
0:12:37.4,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I'm also on this mission

205
0:12:39.28,000 --> 0:12:41,000
because the way doctors practice medicine

206
0:12:42.24,000 --> 0:12:47,000
continues to promote a false and toxic view of humanity.

207
0:12:48.84,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Despite the many visionary breakthroughs in medicine we've been learning about,

208
0:12:54.96,000 --> 0:12:56,000
there's a failure of imagination

209
0:12:57.6,000 --> 0:12:58,000
when it comes to race.

210
0:13:00.92,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Would you imagine with me, just a moment:

211
0:13:04.6,000 --> 0:13:1,000
What would happen if doctors stopped treating patients by race?

212
0:13:12.36,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Suppose they rejected

213
0:13:14.92,000 --> 0:13:17,000
an 18th-century classification system

214
0:13:18.64,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and incorporated instead the most advanced knowledge

215
0:13:22.4,000 --> 0:13:24,000
of human genetic diversity and unity,

216
0:13:25.36,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that human beings cannot be categorized into biological races?

217
0:13:32.6,000 --> 0:13:36,000
What if, instead of using race as a crude proxy

218
0:13:37.4,000 --> 0:13:39,000
for some more important factor,

219
0:13:39.8,000 --> 0:13:44,000
doctors actually investigated and addressed that more important factor?

220
0:13:46.72,000 --> 0:13:49,000
What if doctors joined the forefront

221
0:13:49.88,000 --> 0:13:52,000
of a movement to end the structural inequities

222
0:13:53.64,000 --> 0:13:55,000
caused by racism,

223
0:13:55.88,000 --> 0:13:57,000
not by genetic difference?

224
0:14:01.24,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Race medicine is bad medicine,

225
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
it's poor science

226
0:14:07.32,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and it's a false interpretation of humanity.

227
0:14:11.52,000 --> 0:14:13,000
It is more urgent than ever

228
0:14:14.12,000 --> 0:14:18,000
to finally abandon this backward legacy

229
0:14:18.68,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and to affirm our common humanity

230
0:14:22.12,000 --> 0:14:27,000
by ending the social inequalities that truly divide us.

231
0:14:28.04,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Thank you.

232
0:14:29.28,000 --> 0:14:31,000
(Applause)

233
0:14:31.52,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Thank you. Thanks.

234
0:14:34.32,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Thank you.

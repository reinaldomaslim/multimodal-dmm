0:00:12.396,000 --> 0:00:15,000
What is love?

3
0:00:15.654,000 --> 0:00:17,000
It's a hard term to define

4
0:00:17.961,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in so far as it has a very wide application.

5
0:00:21.85,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I can love jogging.

6
0:00:23.619,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I can love a book, a movie.

7
0:00:25.645,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I can love escalopes.

8
0:00:28.516,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I can love my wife.

9
0:00:30.711,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:35.776,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But there's a great difference

11
0:00:38.81,000 --> 0:00:43,000
between an escalope and my wife, for instance.

12
0:00:43.901,000 --> 0:00:46,000
That is, if I value the escalope,

13
0:00:46.906,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the escalope, on the other hand, it doesn't value me back.

14
0:00:53.019,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Whereas my wife, she calls me

15
0:00:56.321,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the star of her life.

16
0:00:58.122,000 --> 0:01:,000
(Laughter)

17
0:01:00.706,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Therefore, only another desiring conscience

18
0:01:02.662,000 --> 0:01:05,000
can conceive me as a desirable being.

19
0:01:05.894,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I know this, that's why

20
0:01:07.474,000 --> 0:01:09,000
love can be defined in a more accurate way

21
0:01:09.82,000 --> 0:01:13,000
as the desire of being desired.

22
0:01:14.13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Hence the eternal problem of love:

23
0:01:16.925,000 --> 0:01:21,000
how to become and remain desirable?

24
0:01:22.869,000 --> 0:01:25,000
The individual used to find

25
0:01:26.489,000 --> 0:01:28,000
an answer to this problem

26
0:01:28.722,000 --> 0:01:31,000
by submitting his life to community rules.

27
0:01:31.727,000 --> 0:01:33,000
You had a specific part to play

28
0:01:33.834,000 --> 0:01:35,000
according to your sex, your age,

29
0:01:36.049,000 --> 0:01:37,000
your social status,

30
0:01:37.925,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and you only had to play your part

31
0:01:39.955,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to be valued and loved by the whole community.

32
0:01:44.032,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Think about the young woman who must remain chaste before marriage.

33
0:01:47.789,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Think about the youngest son who must obey the eldest son,

34
0:01:52.155,000 --> 0:01:57,000
who in turn must obey the patriarch.

35
0:01:57.861,000 --> 0:02:01,000
But a phenomenon

36
0:02:02.147,000 --> 0:02:05,000
started in the 13th century,

37
0:02:05.51,000 --> 0:02:09,000
mainly in the Renaissance, in the West,

38
0:02:09.512,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that caused the biggest identity crisis

39
0:02:12.891,000 --> 0:02:14,000
in the history of humankind.

40
0:02:15.088,000 --> 0:02:17,000
This phenomenon is modernity.

41
0:02:17.358,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We can basically summarize it through a triple process.

42
0:02:20.306,000 --> 0:02:25,000
First, a process of rationalization of scientific research,

43
0:02:26.029,000 --> 0:02:28,000
which has accelerated technical progress.

44
0:02:28.714,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Next, a process of political democratization,

45
0:02:33.178,000 --> 0:02:36,000
which has fostered individual rights.

46
0:02:36.292,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And finally, a process of rationalization of economic production

47
0:02:40.85,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and of trade liberalization.

48
0:02:43.735,000 --> 0:02:45,000
These three intertwined processes

49
0:02:46.617,000 --> 0:02:48,000
have completely annihilated

50
0:02:49.026,000 --> 0:02:53,000
all the traditional bearings of Western societies,

51
0:02:53.332,000 --> 0:02:55,000
with radical consequences for the individual.

52
0:02:55.957,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Now individuals are free

53
0:02:58.518,000 --> 0:03:01,000
to value or disvalue

54
0:03:01.922,000 --> 0:03:05,000
any attitude, any choice, any object.

55
0:03:06.127,000 --> 0:03:12,000
But as a result, they are themselves confronted

56
0:03:12.344,000 --> 0:03:14,000
with this same freedom that others have

57
0:03:14.409,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to value or disvalue them.

58
0:03:18.861,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In other words, my value was once ensured

59
0:03:24.201,000 --> 0:03:27,000
by submitting myself to the traditional authorities.

60
0:03:28.114,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now it is quoted in the stock exchange.

61
0:03:33.398,000 --> 0:03:37,000
On the free market of individual desires,

62
0:03:38.048,000 --> 0:03:41,000
I negotiate my value every day.

63
0:03:42.033,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Hence the anxiety of contemporary man.

64
0:03:44.619,000 --> 0:03:48,000
He is obsessed: "Am I desirable? How desirable?

65
0:03:48.705,000 --> 0:03:51,000
How many people are going to love me?"

66
0:03:51.803,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And how does he respond to this anxiety?

67
0:03:54.509,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Well, by hysterically collecting symbols of desirability.

68
0:04:04.493,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Laughter)

69
0:04:07.46,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I call this act of collecting,

70
0:04:09.765,000 --> 0:04:12,000
along with others, seduction capital.

71
0:04:13.119,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Indeed, our consumer society

72
0:04:15.162,000 --> 0:04:2,000
is largely based on seduction capital.

73
0:04:20.631,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It is said about this consumption that our age is materialistic.

74
0:04:24.742,000 --> 0:04:27,000
But it's not true! We only accumulate objects

75
0:04:28.69,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in order to communicate with other minds.

76
0:04:31.501,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We do it to make them love us, to seduce them.

77
0:04:36.918,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Nothing could be less materialistic, or more sentimental,

78
0:04:40.638,000 --> 0:04:44,000
than a teenager buying brand new jeans

79
0:04:44.863,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and tearing them at the knees,

80
0:04:47.355,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because he wants to please Jennifer.

81
0:04:49.467,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:51.917,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Consumerism is not materialism.

83
0:04:55.201,000 --> 0:04:57,000
It is rather what is swallowed up

84
0:04:57.276,000 --> 0:05:,000
and sacrificed in the name of the god of love,

85
0:05:00.285,000 --> 0:05:04,000
or rather in the name of seduction capital.

86
0:05:04.731,000 --> 0:05:09,000
In light of this observation on contemporary love,

87
0:05:10.112,000 --> 0:05:13,000
how can we think of love in the years to come?

88
0:05:13.427,000 --> 0:05:15,000
We can envision two hypotheses:

89
0:05:15.711,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The first one consists of betting

90
0:05:18.447,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that this process of narcissistic capitalization will intensify.

91
0:05:24.141,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It is hard to say what shape this intensification will take,

92
0:05:28.209,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because it largely depends

93
0:05:29.94,000 --> 0:05:31,000
on social and technical innovations,

94
0:05:32.708,000 --> 0:05:37,000
which are by definition difficult to predict.

95
0:05:37.755,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But we can, for instance,

96
0:05:39.657,000 --> 0:05:42,000
imagine a dating website

97
0:05:43.381,000 --> 0:05:47,000
which, a bit like those loyalty points programs,

98
0:05:47.513,000 --> 0:05:5,000
uses seduction capital points

99
0:05:50.705,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that vary according to my age, my height/weight ratio,

100
0:05:54.5,000 --> 0:05:56,000
my degree, my salary,

101
0:05:57.023,000 --> 0:06:01,000
or the number of clicks on my profile.

102
0:06:01.488,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We can also imagine

103
0:06:05.374,000 --> 0:06:08,000
a chemical treatment for breakups

104
0:06:08.747,000 --> 0:06:11,000
that weakens the feelings of attachment.

105
0:06:12.565,000 --> 0:06:16,000
By the way, there's a program on MTV already

106
0:06:16.622,000 --> 0:06:19,000
in which seduction teachers

107
0:06:20.606,000 --> 0:06:23,000
treat heartache as a disease.

108
0:06:24.524,000 --> 0:06:27,000
These teachers call themselves "pick-up artists."

109
0:06:28.226,000 --> 0:06:31,000
"Artist" in French is easy, it means "artiste."

110
0:06:31.47,000 --> 0:06:33,000
"Pick-up" is to pick someone up,

111
0:06:34.182,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but not just any picking up -- it's picking up chicks.

112
0:06:36.298,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So they are artists of picking up chicks.

113
0:06:40.767,000 --> 0:06:41,000
(Laughter)

114
0:06:42.224,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And they call heartache "one-itis."

115
0:06:47.339,000 --> 0:06:5,000
In English, "itis" is a suffix that signifies infection.

116
0:06:50.889,000 --> 0:06:54,000
One-itis can be translated as "an infection from one."

117
0:06:55.353,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's a bit disgusting. Indeed, for the pick-up artists,

118
0:06:59.122,000 --> 0:07:02,000
falling in love with someone

119
0:07:02.571,000 --> 0:07:03,000
is a waste of time,

120
0:07:04.403,000 --> 0:07:05,000
it's squandering your seduction capital,

121
0:07:06.31,000 --> 0:07:07,000
so it must be eliminated

122
0:07:08.102,000 --> 0:07:11,000
like a disease, like an infection.

123
0:07:11.831,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We can also envision

124
0:07:15.532,000 --> 0:07:18,000
a romantic use of the genome.

125
0:07:18.549,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Everyone would carry it around

126
0:07:22.199,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and present it like a business card

127
0:07:25.399,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to verify if seduction can progress to reproduction.

128
0:07:30.393,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Laughter)

129
0:07:34.021,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Of course, this race for seduction,

130
0:07:39.184,000 --> 0:07:41,000
like every fierce competition,

131
0:07:41.287,000 --> 0:07:45,000
will create huge disparities in narcissistic satisfaction,

132
0:07:46.22,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and therefore a lot of loneliness and frustration too.

133
0:07:50.27,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So we can expect that modernity itself,

134
0:07:53.014,000 --> 0:07:57,000
which is the origin of seduction capital, would be called into question.

135
0:07:57.55,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I'm thinking particularly of the reaction

136
0:08:00.181,000 --> 0:08:04,000
of neo-fascist or religious communes.

137
0:08:05.11,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But such a future doesn't have to be.

138
0:08:10.746,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Another path to thinking about love may be possible.

139
0:08:16.168,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But how?

140
0:08:18.258,000 --> 0:08:22,000
How to renounce the hysterical need to be valued?

141
0:08:22.572,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Well, by becoming aware of my uselessness.

142
0:08:26.78,000 --> 0:08:28,000
(Laughter)

143
0:08:28.879,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Yes,

144
0:08:29.818,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I'm useless.

145
0:08:32.109,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But rest assured:

146
0:08:33.98,000 --> 0:08:34,000
so are you.

147
0:08:35.442,000 --> 0:08:37,000
(Laughter)

148
0:08:37.592,000 --> 0:08:41,000
(Applause)

149
0:08:41.629,000 --> 0:08:45,000
We are all useless.

150
0:08:45.999,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This uselessness is easily demonstrated,

151
0:08:48.414,000 --> 0:08:51,000
because in order to be valued

152
0:08:52.015,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I need another to desire me,

153
0:08:55.026,000 --> 0:08:57,000
which shows that I do not have any value of my own.

154
0:08:57.316,000 --> 0:09:,000
I don't have any inherent value.

155
0:09:02.764,000 --> 0:09:04,000
We all pretend to have an idol;

156
0:09:05.489,000 --> 0:09:07,000
we all pretend to be an idol for someone else, but actually

157
0:09:08.408,000 --> 0:09:11,000
we are all impostors, a bit like a man on the street

158
0:09:11.83,000 --> 0:09:13,000
who appears totally cool and indifferent,

159
0:09:14.689,000 --> 0:09:17,000
while he has actually anticipated and calculated

160
0:09:17.838,000 --> 0:09:2,000
so that all eyes are on him.

161
0:09:21.443,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I think that becoming aware

162
0:09:23.012,000 --> 0:09:25,000
of this general imposture

163
0:09:25.219,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that concerns all of us

164
0:09:26.627,000 --> 0:09:27,000
would ease our love relationships.

165
0:09:28.447,000 --> 0:09:3,000
It is because I want to be loved

166
0:09:30.837,000 --> 0:09:31,000
from head to toe,

167
0:09:32.334,000 --> 0:09:33,000
justified in my every choice,

168
0:09:34.309,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that the seduction hysteria exists.

169
0:09:37.081,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And therefore I want to seem perfect

170
0:09:39.374,000 --> 0:09:4,000
so that another can love me.

171
0:09:40.994,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I want them to be perfect

172
0:09:42.521,000 --> 0:09:44,000
so that I can be reassured of my value.

173
0:09:44.678,000 --> 0:09:46,000
It leads to couples

174
0:09:47.065,000 --> 0:09:49,000
obsessed with performance

175
0:09:49.357,000 --> 0:09:51,000
who will break up, just like that,

176
0:09:51.513,000 --> 0:09:53,000
at the slightest underachievement.

177
0:09:54.067,000 --> 0:09:58,000
In contrast to this attitude,

178
0:09:58.19,000 --> 0:10:,000
I call upon tenderness -- love as tenderness.

179
0:10:00.928,000 --> 0:10:01,000
What is tenderness?

180
0:10:02.296,000 --> 0:10:05,000
To be tender is to accept the loved one's weaknesses.

181
0:10:06.169,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It's not about becoming a sad couple of orderlies.

182
0:10:09.826,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Laughter)

183
0:10:11.021,000 --> 0:10:13,000
That's pretty bad.

184
0:10:13.091,000 --> 0:10:14,000
On the contrary,

185
0:10:14.423,000 --> 0:10:16,000
there's plenty of charm and happiness in tenderness.

186
0:10:17.189,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I refer specifically to a kind of humor that is unfortunately underused.

187
0:10:21.238,000 --> 0:10:23,000
It is a sort of poetry of deliberate awkwardness.

188
0:10:24.115,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I refer to self-mockery.

189
0:10:26.896,000 --> 0:10:28,000
For a couple who is no longer sustained, supported

190
0:10:29.717,000 --> 0:10:31,000
by the constraints of tradition,

191
0:10:31.794,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I believe that self-mockery

192
0:10:33.342,000 --> 0:10:37,000
is one of the best means for the relationship to endure.

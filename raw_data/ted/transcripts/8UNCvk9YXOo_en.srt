1
0:00:12.753,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The drive through the world's most secure prison is beautiful.

2
0:00:16.515,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The federal government's only supermax prison, known as ADX,

3
0:00:20.492,000 --> 0:00:22,000
is 90 miles south of Denver.

4
0:00:22.649,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Standing outside the building,

5
0:00:24.522,000 --> 0:00:27,000
ADX looks like a newish suburban middle school.

6
0:00:27.649,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:29.292,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The lobby is clean and bright;

8
0:00:31.927,000 --> 0:00:34,000
there's big windows and clear views of the mountains;

9
0:00:35.149,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and a polite front-desk attendant with a kiosk selling travel mugs.

10
0:00:39.347,000 --> 0:00:4,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:41.292,000 --> 0:00:43,000
On the wall is a large plaque that reads,

12
0:00:43.934,000 --> 0:00:46,000
"The best prize that life offers is the chance to work hard

13
0:00:47.038,000 --> 0:00:48,000
at work worth doing."

14
0:00:49.427,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Just past it is a huge framed photo of Alcatraz.

15
0:00:53.911,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And down the stairs, at the end of a long hallway,

16
0:00:57.061,000 --> 0:01:,000
are 400 men decaying in isolation cells.

17
0:01:01.792,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I work on cases involving the constitutional rights of prisoners.

18
0:01:05.71,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, people have differing views about prisoners' rights.

19
0:01:09.511,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But there's something more people can agree on:

20
0:01:11.964,000 --> 0:01:12,000
torture.

21
0:01:14.13,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The US government says it doesn't use torture,

22
0:01:16.361,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and we condemn other countries, like Iran and North Korea,

23
0:01:19.125,000 --> 0:01:2,000
for their use of torture.

24
0:01:21.496,000 --> 0:01:24,000
But some people think the so-called worst of the worst deserve it:

25
0:01:25.434,000 --> 0:01:28,000
terrorists, mass murderers, the really "bad" people.

26
0:01:30.071,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now I personally believe that no one deserves to be tortured

27
0:01:32.993,000 --> 0:01:33,000
by the US government.

28
0:01:34.341,000 --> 0:01:35,000
But that's me.

29
0:01:35.623,000 --> 0:01:42,000
(Applause)

30
0:01:42.647,000 --> 0:01:43,000
No matter where you fall,

31
0:01:43.877,000 --> 0:01:45,000
there's a few things I need you to understand

32
0:01:46.083,000 --> 0:01:47,000
before I continue.

33
0:01:47.869,000 --> 0:01:49,000
First, we do torture people here in America,

34
0:01:50.561,000 --> 0:01:52,000
tens of thousands of them every day.

35
0:01:52.927,000 --> 0:01:54,000
It's called solitary confinement.

36
0:01:55.513,000 --> 0:01:57,000
It's done in our names, using our tax dollars,

37
0:01:57.847,000 --> 0:01:58,000
behind closed doors.

38
0:01:59.902,000 --> 0:02:,000
And as a result,

39
0:02:01.284,000 --> 0:02:04,000
we're undermining the core values of our justice system.

40
0:02:05.477,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Built with state-of-the-art technology,

41
0:02:07.391,000 --> 0:02:09,000
ADX has nearly perfected solitary confinement.

42
0:02:10.97,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Each man spends 23 hours a day

43
0:02:13.062,000 --> 0:02:15,000
alone in a cell the size of a small bathroom.

44
0:02:16.537,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Virtually every aspect of his life occurs in that cell.

45
0:02:20.133,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But aside from sleeping and eating,

46
0:02:22.427,000 --> 0:02:24,000
which he does within an arm's reach of his toilet,

47
0:02:25.165,000 --> 0:02:26,000
there aren't many aspects of life.

48
0:02:27.68,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Correctional officers push food trays through slots in the doors

49
0:02:31.738,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and take the men to solitary exercise cages

50
0:02:34.199,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that are referred to by prisoners and staff alike,

51
0:02:36.818,000 --> 0:02:38,000
without irony, as dog runs.

52
0:02:39.992,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Other than that,

53
0:02:41.411,000 --> 0:02:43,000
these men are locked in cement closets,

54
0:02:43.442,000 --> 0:02:44,000
all day, every day.

55
0:02:45.577,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Two steps forward, two steps back.

56
0:02:47.927,000 --> 0:02:48,000
That's it.

57
0:02:49.673,000 --> 0:02:51,000
They can't see the nearby mountains or any trees --

58
0:02:52.689,000 --> 0:02:54,000
"nothing living, not so much as a blade of grass,"

59
0:02:55.419,000 --> 0:02:57,000
is how one man in ADX described it.

60
0:02:58.435,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Some people report that after years of not looking at anything

61
0:03:01.566,000 --> 0:03:02,000
further than 10 feet away,

62
0:03:03.312,000 --> 0:03:04,000
their eyesight has deteriorated so much

63
0:03:05.311,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that they can't focus on faraway objects anymore.

64
0:03:08.748,000 --> 0:03:1,000
The isolation is so deep and profound

65
0:03:10.919,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that one of our clients would lie on the floor of his cell for hours,

66
0:03:14.823,000 --> 0:03:16,000
just hoping to catch a glimpse of someone's feet

67
0:03:17.102,000 --> 0:03:19,000
as they walked past the door of his cell.

68
0:03:19.924,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Another befriended a wasp that flew into his cell,

69
0:03:22.972,000 --> 0:03:24,000
feeding it and talking to it like a friend.

70
0:03:26.551,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Some try to communicate with fellow prisoners

71
0:03:28.686,000 --> 0:03:3,000
by yelling through the shower drains.

72
0:03:31.045,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Still though, many of these men lost their voices

73
0:03:33.434,000 --> 0:03:35,000
after talking with us for just an hour.

74
0:03:36.593,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Their vocal cords were out of practice speaking for that long.

75
0:03:41.188,000 --> 0:03:44,000
We know the impact of long-term isolation is devastating.

76
0:03:45.18,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This borders on common sense.

77
0:03:47.895,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It's why harsh prison systems and torture regimes

78
0:03:50.516,000 --> 0:03:53,000
routinely use solitary as a form of severe punishment.

79
0:03:54.188,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And why none of us would tolerate having a loved one,

80
0:03:57.68,000 --> 0:03:59,000
like a parent or a child,

81
0:03:59.927,000 --> 0:04:03,000
locked alone in a small bathroom for days, let alone years.

82
0:04:05.069,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Or decades.

83
0:04:07.866,000 --> 0:04:09,000
In the course of representing that first client at ADX,

84
0:04:10.468,000 --> 0:04:12,000
we learned about another man, Tommy Silverstein,

85
0:04:13.175,000 --> 0:04:15,000
who the Federal Bureau of Prisons put in solitary confinement

86
0:04:16.073,000 --> 0:04:19,000
under a "no human contact" order in 1983,

87
0:04:19.712,000 --> 0:04:21,000
after he killed a corrections officer.

88
0:04:22.355,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Tommy was 31 years old.

89
0:04:25.355,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now he's 66.

90
0:04:27.363,000 --> 0:04:3,000
He's been in solitary confinement for 35 years.

91
0:04:32.488,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Struggling to find the words to capture his experience of ADX,

92
0:04:35.758,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Tommy, who has become an accomplished artist,

93
0:04:38.909,000 --> 0:04:39,000
drew it instead.

94
0:04:41.8,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Unless we start to change how we treat prisoners in this country,

95
0:04:45.38,000 --> 0:04:48,000
he'll probably be there for the rest of his life.

96
0:04:49.736,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Both John McCain and Nelson Mandela

97
0:04:51.552,000 --> 0:04:53,000
said that of all the horrors they suffered in prison,

98
0:04:54.49,000 --> 0:04:56,000
solitary confinement was the worst.

99
0:04:57.109,000 --> 0:04:59,000
That's because solitary puts people at risk

100
0:04:59.173,000 --> 0:05:01,000
of losing their grasp on who they are,

101
0:05:01.815,000 --> 0:05:04,000
of how and whether they're connected to a larger world.

102
0:05:05.523,000 --> 0:05:07,000
As psychologist Dr. Craig Haney explains,

103
0:05:07.999,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that's because human identity is socially created.

104
0:05:11.761,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We understand ourselves through our relationships with other people.

105
0:05:15.633,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Solitary confinement can make you change what you think about yourself.

106
0:05:19.942,000 --> 0:05:21,000
It can make you doubt whether you even have a self.

107
0:05:23.435,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Some people in solitary aren't even sure they exist,

108
0:05:27.118,000 --> 0:05:29,000
so they'll mouth off to a corrections officer

109
0:05:29.848,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and end up getting shackled or beaten.

110
0:05:32.323,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But at least then, they know they exist.

111
0:05:36.12,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Over time, some of the men in ADX break down in obvious ways,

112
0:05:41.128,000 --> 0:05:43,000
like banging their heads on the walls of their cells

113
0:05:43.731,000 --> 0:05:45,000
or smearing themselves with feces.

114
0:05:46.823,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Or attempting suicide, some of them successfully.

115
0:05:50.514,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Many people cut themselves

116
0:05:51.962,000 --> 0:05:54,000
just to feel the pain that keeps them tethered to the real world.

117
0:05:56.3,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Others adjust,

118
0:05:57.996,000 --> 0:05:59,000
showing no outward sign of mental illness.

119
0:06:00.911,000 --> 0:06:03,000
But there's grave harm in the adjustment itself.

120
0:06:04.606,000 --> 0:06:06,000
That's because the experience of long-term isolation

121
0:06:07.281,000 --> 0:06:1,000
can paradoxically lead to social withdrawal.

122
0:06:10.558,000 --> 0:06:12,000
At first, people are starved for human contact,

123
0:06:13.146,000 --> 0:06:14,000
but over time,

124
0:06:14.355,000 --> 0:06:16,000
it becomes disorienting, even frightening.

125
0:06:16.95,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They can't handle it anymore.

126
0:06:20.133,000 --> 0:06:22,000
All of this amounts to a prolonged social death.

127
0:06:23.245,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The men in ADX are stuck in suspended animation.

128
0:06:27.261,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Not really part of this world,

129
0:06:29.071,000 --> 0:06:32,000
they're not really part of any world that's fully and tangibly human.

130
0:06:33.395,000 --> 0:06:36,000
It's for all of these reasons that international human rights law

131
0:06:37.307,000 --> 0:06:39,000
prohibits the use of long-term solitary confinement.

132
0:06:41.046,000 --> 0:06:44,000
In fact, the UN has called on governments to ban the use of solitary

133
0:06:44.602,000 --> 0:06:45,000
for more than 15 days.

134
0:06:47.522,000 --> 0:06:48,000
As of today,

135
0:06:49.188,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Tommy Silverstein has been in solitary for 12,815 days.

136
0:06:55.887,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Now in judging other countries' human rights records,

137
0:06:58.674,000 --> 0:07:01,000
the US State Department has called the use of long-term solitary

138
0:07:01.919,000 --> 0:07:02,000
a human rights violation.

139
0:07:04.236,000 --> 0:07:05,000
In 2009, for example,

140
0:07:07.395,000 --> 0:07:13,000
State Department condemned Israel, Iran, Indonesia and Yemen

141
0:07:13.526,000 --> 0:07:14,000
for their use of solitary.

142
0:07:15.994,000 --> 0:07:17,000
But we allow it to happen on our own soil.

143
0:07:20.073,000 --> 0:07:24,000
When a prison is located in the US instead of China,

144
0:07:24.217,000 --> 0:07:28,000
when it's run by the federal government and not some rogue sheriff,

145
0:07:28.625,000 --> 0:07:31,000
when it has state-of-the-art technology and gleaming floors,

146
0:07:31.879,000 --> 0:07:34,000
not overcrowded cells and decrepit facilities,

147
0:07:34.978,000 --> 0:07:36,000
it's harder to believe that torture happens there.

148
0:07:38.319,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But it's important to entertain the idea that, sometimes, this too

149
0:07:43.089,000 --> 0:07:44,000
is what torture looks like.

150
0:07:45.931,000 --> 0:07:46,000
As a civil rights lawyer,

151
0:07:47.226,000 --> 0:07:5,000
I believe it's important to ensure that people,

152
0:07:50.345,000 --> 0:07:52,000
even those convicted of terrible crimes,

153
0:07:52.916,000 --> 0:07:54,000
aren't tortured by our government.

154
0:07:55.339,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And if this talk were a movie,

155
0:07:56.982,000 --> 0:08:,000
I'd tell you next about how we fought and fought and eventually won.

156
0:08:02.633,000 --> 0:08:03,000
But this isn't a movie.

157
0:08:04.236,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So I'll tell you, instead, about how deeply this injustice is hidden.

158
0:08:08.117,000 --> 0:08:1,000
How difficult it is to expose it,

159
0:08:10.411,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and why it's important that we do.

160
0:08:14.165,000 --> 0:08:17,000
You'd think that lawyers, people who work in the justice system,

161
0:08:17.984,000 --> 0:08:19,000
would know what happens in our prisons.

162
0:08:20.736,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But I'm a lawyer, and I live less than two hours away from ADX.

163
0:08:24.638,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And until we went to see that first client,

164
0:08:26.79,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I didn't know anything about it.

165
0:08:29.265,000 --> 0:08:3,000
I don't think that's an accident.

166
0:08:32.225,000 --> 0:08:34,000
ADX walls itself off from public scrutiny.

167
0:08:35.824,000 --> 0:08:37,000
In the 25 years since it opened,

168
0:08:38.308,000 --> 0:08:41,000
it's allowed only a single visit by human rights organizations.

169
0:08:42.269,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Journalists are routinely denied entry.

170
0:08:44.888,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Mail is censored.

171
0:08:47.214,000 --> 0:08:49,000
And even when rare family visits occur,

172
0:08:49.618,000 --> 0:08:51,000
they're monitored by an unseen government official

173
0:08:52.079,000 --> 0:08:54,000
who can cut the visit off without notice

174
0:08:54.237,000 --> 0:08:56,000
if he thinks that the prisoner is talking in too much detail

175
0:08:57.079,000 --> 0:08:58,000
about the conditions in ADX.

176
0:09:00.037,000 --> 0:09:03,000
In China, in Russia, they keep out the human rights observers,

177
0:09:03.815,000 --> 0:09:05,000
keep out the media, keep out the UN.

178
0:09:06.712,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And so do we.

179
0:09:08.776,000 --> 0:09:1,000
ADX is, in the words of one journalist,

180
0:09:11.561,000 --> 0:09:13,000
"a black site on American soil."

181
0:09:14.546,000 --> 0:09:18,000
We know that secrecy is a hallmark of places that torture.

182
0:09:19.998,000 --> 0:09:22,000
But after years of shining a light,

183
0:09:23.395,000 --> 0:09:26,000
we now know more about the conditions in Guantanamo

184
0:09:26.62,000 --> 0:09:27,000
than we do at ADX.

185
0:09:29.343,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Five years ago,

186
0:09:30.518,000 --> 0:09:32,000
when there was a hunger strike and force-feeding at Guantanamo,

187
0:09:33.533,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the same thing was happening at ADX.

188
0:09:35.846,000 --> 0:09:36,000
But you probably didn't hear about it

189
0:09:37.68,000 --> 0:09:39,000
because the government gagged family members and lawyers

190
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
from talking about it.

191
0:09:42.561,000 --> 0:09:43,000
But here's the thing:

192
0:09:44.212,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the American criminal justice system is supposed to be transparent.

193
0:09:48.68,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And before someone gets sent to prison,

194
0:09:50.577,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that's largely true.

195
0:09:53.347,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Legislators meet in public to debate and define the laws

196
0:09:56.188,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that prohibit criminal conduct.

197
0:09:58.883,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Citizens in our community serve as jurors on criminal trials.

198
0:10:02.845,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And if you want to watch a trial,

199
0:10:04.655,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the courtroom doors are wide open.

200
0:10:07.774,000 --> 0:10:1,000
After the trial, though, our commitment to transparency ends.

201
0:10:11.875,000 --> 0:10:13,000
With the prison door securely shut,

202
0:10:13.978,000 --> 0:10:14,000
what happens behind prison walls

203
0:10:15.828,000 --> 0:10:16,000
stays behind prison walls.

204
0:10:17.97,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And without the scrutiny of the public gaze,

205
0:10:20.363,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the darkness festers.

206
0:10:23.601,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Other than execution,

207
0:10:24.89,000 --> 0:10:27,000
incarceration is the most intrusive power of the state:

208
0:10:28.266,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the deprivation of citizens' liberty.

209
0:10:31.385,000 --> 0:10:32,000
But no government institution

210
0:10:33.052,000 --> 0:10:36,000
is more opaque and less accountable than prison.

211
0:10:36.425,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Even though prisons are supported by tax payers

212
0:10:38.835,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and return 95 percent of their residents to our communities.

213
0:10:43.038,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It's that secrecy that allows the ADX to disappear people.

214
0:10:49.038,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And so we have an obligation, said Justice Kennedy,

215
0:10:52.752,000 --> 0:10:53,000
as a democracy and as a people,

216
0:10:54.612,000 --> 0:10:57,000
"we should know what happens after the prisoner is taken away."

217
0:10:58.22,000 --> 0:11:02,000
The prison system is the concern and responsibility of every citizen.

218
0:11:02.415,000 --> 0:11:03,000
This is your justice system.

219
0:11:03.979,000 --> 0:11:04,000
These are your prisons.

220
0:11:06.36,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Torture happens in the dark.

221
0:11:08.384,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And so we need to embrace the admonition that sunlight is the best disinfectant.

222
0:11:13.442,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Not only because we need to know what happens inside ADX,

223
0:11:16.752,000 --> 0:11:18,000
but because the knowing itself can create change.

224
0:11:20.823,000 --> 0:11:23,000
There's an axiom in physics called the uncertainty principle.

225
0:11:25.101,000 --> 0:11:28,000
It teaches that the mere fact of observation

226
0:11:29.077,000 --> 0:11:3,000
can alter, will alter,

227
0:11:30.934,000 --> 0:11:32,000
the subatomic reaction being observed.

228
0:11:34.204,000 --> 0:11:35,000
In other words,

229
0:11:36.458,000 --> 0:11:38,000
watching something affects its course.

230
0:11:39.577,000 --> 0:11:41,000
In a democracy like the US,

231
0:11:41.807,000 --> 0:11:43,000
prisons are administered in our name and on our behalf.

232
0:11:45.5,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The conditions in ADX implicate our tax dollars,

233
0:11:48.555,000 --> 0:11:49,000
public safety

234
0:11:50.063,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and, most of all,

235
0:11:51.277,000 --> 0:11:54,000
our shared belief in the inherent dignity of every human being.

236
0:11:55.881,000 --> 0:11:57,000
We have an obligation to bear witness.

237
0:11:59.079,000 --> 0:12:,000
Thank you.

238
0:12:00.262,000 --> 0:12:06,000
(Applause)

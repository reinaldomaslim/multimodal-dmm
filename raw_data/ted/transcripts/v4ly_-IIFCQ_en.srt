1
0:00:12.802,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It's 4am, you've been awake for forty hours,

2
0:00:16.222,000 --> 0:00:19,000
when you unlock a puzzle containing this video

3
0:00:19.627,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of some kind of dance-off between a chicken and a roller-skating beaver.

4
0:00:24.627,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:26.175,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The confusion and delight you're experiencing

6
0:00:28.486,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is a typical moment at the MIT Mystery Hunt,

7
0:00:31.603,000 --> 0:00:33,000
which is basically the Olympics meets Burning Man

8
0:00:33.968,000 --> 0:00:34,000
for a specific type of nerd.

9
0:00:35.696,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:36.721,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Today, I'm going to take you inside this strange,

11
0:00:39.087,000 --> 0:00:42,000
intellectually masochistic and incredibly joyful world.

12
0:00:42.858,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But first, I have to explain what I mean when I say "puzzle."

13
0:00:46.715,000 --> 0:00:49,000
A puzzle-hunt-style puzzle is a data set.

14
0:00:49.977,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It can be a grid of letters, a sudoku, a video, an audio --

15
0:00:54.811,000 --> 0:00:57,000
it can be anything that contains hidden information

16
0:00:57.861,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that can eventually resolve into an answer that is a word or a phrase.

17
0:01:02.194,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So, to give you an example,

18
0:01:03.538,000 --> 0:01:05,000
this is a puzzle called "Master Pieces."

19
0:01:06.18,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It consists of 10 images of LEGO people looking at piles of LEGOs.

20
0:01:11.37,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And to save us some time, I'm going to explain what's going on here.

21
0:01:14.744,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Each of the piles of LEGOs is a deconstructed work of art

22
0:01:19.173,000 --> 0:01:2,000
in the style of a famous artist.

23
0:01:21.046,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So, does anybody recognize the artist on the left?

24
0:01:24.641,000 --> 0:01:25,000
They used a lot of red.

25
0:01:26.865,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I heard "Rothko," yeah.

26
0:01:28.873,000 --> 0:01:29,000
The second one?

27
0:01:30.048,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Audience) Mondrian.

28
0:01:31.223,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Alex Rosenthal: Yeah, well done.

29
0:01:32.809,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And the third one? This is the hardest one --

30
0:01:37.404,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Yeah, Klimt, I heard it.

31
0:01:38.95,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Well done, the color is the biggest clue there.

32
0:01:42.195,000 --> 0:01:44,000
So the puzzle has various clues

33
0:01:44.884,000 --> 0:01:46,000
that tell you what matters here are the artists,

34
0:01:47.157,000 --> 0:01:48,000
not the specific works of art.

35
0:01:48.8,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And what you need to do is then look at what you haven't used yet,

36
0:01:52.301,000 --> 0:01:54,000
which is the number of LEGO people in each painting.

37
0:01:55.228,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And you can count them

38
0:01:56.706,000 --> 0:02:,000
and then count into the artists' last names by the same number of letters.

39
0:02:00.76,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So there's three people in front of the Rothko on the left,

40
0:02:03.95,000 --> 0:02:05,000
so you take the third letter, which is a T.

41
0:02:06.633,000 --> 0:02:09,000
There's only one in front of the Mondrian, so you take the first letter, M.

42
0:02:10.228,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And there's three again in front of Klimt, so you take the third letter, I.

43
0:02:14.419,000 --> 0:02:16,000
You do that for all 10 of the original artists

44
0:02:16.935,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and put them in the order,

45
0:02:18.364,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and you get the answer, which is "illuminate."

46
0:02:21.195,000 --> 0:02:22,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:23.6,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Puzzles like this are about communicating an idea.

48
0:02:27.211,000 --> 0:02:29,000
But where I'm trying to be as clear as possible for you now,

49
0:02:30.092,000 --> 0:02:33,000
puzzles have to navigate the line between abstraction and clarity.

50
0:02:34.601,000 --> 0:02:37,000
They have to be obtuse enough to make you work for it,

51
0:02:38.489,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but elegant enough so you can get to the aha moment,

52
0:02:41.339,000 --> 0:02:42,000
where everything clicks into place.

53
0:02:43.546,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Puzzle solvers are junkies for this aha moment --

54
0:02:45.95,000 --> 0:02:49,000
it feels like a brief high and an instant of pristine clarity.

55
0:02:51.077,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And there's also a deeper fulfillment at play here,

56
0:02:54.709,000 --> 0:02:57,000
which is that humans are innate problem-solvers.

57
0:02:57.871,000 --> 0:02:59,000
That's why we love crosswords and escape rooms

58
0:03:00.712,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and figuring out how to explore the bottom of the ocean.

59
0:03:04.704,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Solving deviously difficult puzzles expands our minds in new directions,

60
0:03:09.292,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and it also helps us come at problems from diverse perspectives.

61
0:03:15.927,000 --> 0:03:17,000
These puzzles come in various puzzle hunts,

62
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
which come in various shapes and sizes.

63
0:03:20.173,000 --> 0:03:22,000
There's one-hour ones designed for novices,

64
0:03:22.855,000 --> 0:03:23,000
24-hour road rallies,

65
0:03:24.601,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and the puzzle hunt of puzzle hunts, the MIT Mystery Hunt.

66
0:03:28.753,000 --> 0:03:3,000
This is an event that takes place once a year

67
0:03:30.944,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and has around 2,000 people descending on MIT's campus

68
0:03:36.356,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and solving puzzles in teams that range from a single person to over 100.

69
0:03:41.19,000 --> 0:03:43,000
My team has 60 people on it --

70
0:03:43.571,000 --> 0:03:46,000
that includes a national crossword puzzle tournament champion,

71
0:03:47.515,000 --> 0:03:49,000
a particle physicist, a composer,

72
0:03:50.212,000 --> 0:03:52,000
an actual deep-sea explorer,

73
0:03:52.561,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and me, feeling like "Mr. Bean goes to Bletchley Park."

74
0:03:55.95,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:58.506,000 --> 0:04:01,000
That's actually an apt comparison, because one year involved a puzzle

76
0:04:02.106,000 --> 0:04:04,000
where you had to construct a working Enigma machine

77
0:04:04.919,000 --> 0:04:05,000
out of pieces of cardboard.

78
0:04:06.58,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:08.786,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Each Mystery Hunt has a theme.

80
0:04:10.627,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Past ones have included "The Matrix" and "Alice in Wonderland."

81
0:04:13.881,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It's often pop culture- and literary-based themes.

82
0:04:18.057,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And the goal is to find the coin

83
0:04:20.215,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that's been hidden somewhere on MIT's campus.

84
0:04:23.033,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And in order to get there, you have to solve around 150 puzzles

85
0:04:26.501,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and do various events and challenges.

86
0:04:29.353,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I had done this for about 10 years without ever dreaming of winning,

87
0:04:33.091,000 --> 0:04:35,000
until January of 2016,

88
0:04:35.44,000 --> 0:04:39,000
where 53 hours into a hunt whose theme is the movie "Inception,"

89
0:04:39.776,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we haven't slept in days, so everything is hilarious ...

90
0:04:43.023,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:44.231,000 --> 0:04:48,000
The tables are covered in piles of papers, of our notes and completed puzzles.

92
0:04:49.173,000 --> 0:04:53,000
The whiteboards are an unintelligible mess of three days' worth of insights.

93
0:04:53.729,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And we're stuck on two puzzles.

94
0:04:55.364,000 --> 0:04:58,000
If we could crack them, we would get into the endgame,

95
0:04:58.514,000 --> 0:05:,000
and after hours of work, in a magical moment,

96
0:05:01.077,000 --> 0:05:03,000
they both fall within 10 seconds of each other,

97
0:05:03.68,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and soon, we're on the final runaround,

98
0:05:05.783,000 --> 0:05:07,000
a series of clues that will lead us to the coin,

99
0:05:08.784,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and we're racing through the halls of MIT,

100
0:05:11.22,000 --> 0:05:14,000
trying not to knock over or terrify tour groups,

101
0:05:14.566,000 --> 0:05:15,000
when we realize we're not alone,

102
0:05:16.169,000 --> 0:05:18,000
there's another team on the runaround as well,

103
0:05:18.481,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and we don't know who's ahead.

104
0:05:20.542,000 --> 0:05:22,000
So, we're a mess of anxiety,

105
0:05:23.228,000 --> 0:05:26,000
anticipation, exhilaration and sleep deprivation,

106
0:05:26.331,000 --> 0:05:28,000
when we arrive at the Alchemist,

107
0:05:28.609,000 --> 0:05:3,000
a sculpture in which we find ...

108
0:05:31.91,000 --> 0:05:32,000
this coin.

109
0:05:33.202,000 --> 0:05:34,000
(Cheers)

110
0:05:34.381,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Yeah.

111
0:05:35.557,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Applause)

112
0:05:37.685,000 --> 0:05:39,000
And in claiming it, we win the MIT Mystery Hunt

113
0:05:40.131,000 --> 0:05:42,000
by a tiny margin of five minutes.

114
0:05:43.506,000 --> 0:05:44,000
What I didn't mention before

115
0:05:44.974,000 --> 0:05:45,000
is that the prize for winning

116
0:05:46.395,000 --> 0:05:49,000
is that you get to construct the whole hunt for the following year.

117
0:05:49.633,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Laughter)

118
0:05:51.395,000 --> 0:05:52,000
The punishment for winning

119
0:05:52.674,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is that you have to construct the whole hunt for the following year.

120
0:05:58.08,000 --> 0:06:01,000
At the beginning of 2016, I had never constructed a puzzle before --

121
0:06:01.479,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I had solved plenty of puzzles,

122
0:06:03.052,000 --> 0:06:06,000
but constructing and solving are entirely different beasts.

123
0:06:06.395,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But once again,

124
0:06:07.601,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I was lucky to be on a team full of brilliant mentors and collaborators.

125
0:06:11.125,000 --> 0:06:12,000
So, from a constructor's point of view,

126
0:06:13.077,000 --> 0:06:15,000
a puzzle is where I have an idea,

127
0:06:15.577,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and instead of telling you what it is,

128
0:06:17.451,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I'm going to leave a trail of breadcrumbs so you can figure it out for yourself,

129
0:06:21.297,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and have the joy and experience of the aha moment.

130
0:06:24.053,000 --> 0:06:26,000
This is another way of looking at the aha moment.

131
0:06:26.879,000 --> 0:06:28,000
And what's incredible to me is that this experience,

132
0:06:29.616,000 --> 0:06:31,000
which is very emotional and kind of almost physical,

133
0:06:32.543,000 --> 0:06:34,000
is something that can be carefully designed.

134
0:06:35.028,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So, to show you what I mean,

135
0:06:36.734,000 --> 0:06:39,000
this is a puzzle I co-constructed with my friend Matt Gruskin.

136
0:06:40.258,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It's a text adventure,

137
0:06:42.006,000 --> 0:06:44,000
which is the old-school adventure game format,

138
0:06:44.88,000 --> 0:06:47,000
where you're exploring, going north, east, south and west,

139
0:06:48.212,000 --> 0:06:5,000
picking up items and using them.

140
0:06:50.649,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And you could get to the end of the game part,

141
0:06:52.855,000 --> 0:06:53,000
but you won't have solved the puzzle.

142
0:06:54.681,000 --> 0:06:58,000
In order to do so, you have to recognize a hidden layer of information,

143
0:06:58.8,000 --> 0:07:,000
and the easiest way of seeing it is by mapping the game out.

144
0:07:01.736,000 --> 0:07:02,000
That looks something like this.

145
0:07:03.736,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Does anybody recognize what this is?

146
0:07:07.22,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Yeah, exactly.

147
0:07:08.783,000 --> 0:07:12,000
This text adventure takes place within "Settlers of Catan."

148
0:07:13.22,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Who here knows what "Settlers" is?

149
0:07:15.887,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Nerds.

150
0:07:17.069,000 --> 0:07:18,000
(Laughter)

151
0:07:18.95,000 --> 0:07:2,000
If you don't know, "Settlers" is a board game

152
0:07:21.085,000 --> 0:07:23,000
where you're competing against other people

153
0:07:23.149,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to collect resources and use them to build structures.

154
0:07:26.307,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And within the text adventure, we hid information in various ways,

155
0:07:31.173,000 --> 0:07:33,000
with which you could reconstruct an entire game.

156
0:07:33.831,000 --> 0:07:35,000
You could figure out the roads, the cities, the towns,

157
0:07:36.8,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the resources, the numbers on the tiles, even the dice rolls.

158
0:07:39.754,000 --> 0:07:42,000
You put all that information together and you could extract an answer

159
0:07:43.035,000 --> 0:07:45,000
in a way that's too complicated to explain right now.

160
0:07:45.754,000 --> 0:07:46,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:47.31,000 --> 0:07:49,000
But find me afterwards if you really want to know.

162
0:07:49.701,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

163
0:07:50.759,000 --> 0:07:51,000
But what this puzzle emphasized for me

164
0:07:52.72,000 --> 0:07:55,000
is the value of perspective shifts in inspiring an aha.

165
0:07:56.157,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So, in this puzzle,

166
0:07:57.347,000 --> 0:08:,000
you go from experiencing the world on the ground, as a character,

167
0:08:00.45,000 --> 0:08:03,000
to looking down on it from above as if you're playing a board game,

168
0:08:03.639,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and in that shift,

169
0:08:04.95,000 --> 0:08:07,000
you completely reframe all the information you've been given.

170
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The hardest part of construction for me is coming up with a great idea for an aha.

171
0:08:13.607,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Fortunately, the world is a torrent of ideas and information.

172
0:08:17.456,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I've seen fantastic puzzles constructed out of the waggle dances of bees,

173
0:08:21.99,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and the remarkable coincidence that the 88 keys of a piano

174
0:08:25.792,000 --> 0:08:28,000
can be perfectly mapped to the 88 constellations in the sky.

175
0:08:29.403,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Once you find that out, you can't not construct the puzzle,

176
0:08:32.792,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and it's going to be about having the solvers

177
0:08:35.006,000 --> 0:08:36,000
make that connection in their own minds.

178
0:08:36.99,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Whether you give them stars on a keyboard

179
0:08:38.991,000 --> 0:08:4,000
or play the celestial music of the cosmos,

180
0:08:41.077,000 --> 0:08:43,000
you're getting them there, one way or another.

181
0:08:43.268,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Before long, you find yourself staring at a turtle,

182
0:08:45.688,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and asking yourself, "Is this a puzzle?"

183
0:08:47.895,000 --> 0:08:48,000
(Laughter)

184
0:08:49.561,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And also, staring at a turtle and saying,

185
0:08:51.577,000 --> 0:08:54,000
"I never appreciated what multitudes this contains in its shell alone."

186
0:08:55.64,000 --> 0:08:57,000
This might be a familiar experience to you,

187
0:08:57.68,000 --> 0:09:,000
if you've ever been watching a TED Talk and asked yourself, "Is this a puzzle?"

188
0:09:01.458,000 --> 0:09:02,000
(Laughter)

189
0:09:02.934,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I'm not telling.

190
0:09:04.346,000 --> 0:09:05,000
But what I will say

191
0:09:05.594,000 --> 0:09:08,000
is that puzzles can be found in the most unexpected of places.

192
0:09:09.569,000 --> 0:09:11,000
That brings us back to one of my favorite puzzles of all time,

193
0:09:12.514,000 --> 0:09:13,000
which was constructed by Trip Payne.

194
0:09:14.273,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And this time, I'm going to play it for you with the sound on,

195
0:09:17.234,000 --> 0:09:18,000
so get ready to name that tune.

196
0:09:18.847,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Slowed-down mock clucking)

197
0:09:21.974,000 --> 0:09:23,000
(Slowed-down mock clucking)

198
0:09:25.117,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Slowed-down mock clucking)

199
0:09:31.476,000 --> 0:09:32,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:32.65,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Who knows what that is?

201
0:09:34.825,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Yeah, "You Make Me Feel Like a Natural Woman."

202
0:09:37.023,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:41.875,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So you can identify that and seven other songs and clips,

204
0:09:45.256,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and then look at the videos themselves for clues,

205
0:09:47.827,000 --> 0:09:5,000
where the way that they are filmed and edited together

206
0:09:51.133,000 --> 0:09:54,000
plus things like the cutaways to the panel of five people

207
0:09:54.22,000 --> 0:09:55,000
sitting at a table,

208
0:09:55.498,000 --> 0:09:57,000
which is reminiscent of a panel of judges,

209
0:09:57.974,000 --> 0:10:,000
all of this can suggest "reality competition show."

210
0:10:01.252,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And either through internet research,

211
0:10:03.173,000 --> 0:10:06,000
or from just recognizing this, you can get to the aha,

212
0:10:06.831,000 --> 0:10:09,000
which is that these clips are shot-for-shot recreations

213
0:10:09.895,000 --> 0:10:11,000
of lip-synch battles from "RuPaul's Drag Race."

214
0:10:12.403,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Laughter)

215
0:10:15.323,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So, why do we do this?

216
0:10:16.966,000 --> 0:10:18,000
(Laughter)

217
0:10:19.903,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Applause)

218
0:10:22.927,000 --> 0:10:23,000
You tell me, I don't know.

219
0:10:24.546,000 --> 0:10:26,000
So, first of all, it's really fun.

220
0:10:27.22,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But I think it also improves our lives in various ways.

221
0:10:30.696,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Being able to solve puzzles, when I'm confronted with a challenge,

222
0:10:34.181,000 --> 0:10:37,000
has allowed me to explore it from multiple perspectives

223
0:10:37.356,000 --> 0:10:39,000
before I lock in an approach.

224
0:10:39.442,000 --> 0:10:42,000
Also, the process of solving is great training for working with a team,

225
0:10:43.458,000 --> 0:10:45,000
knowing when to listen, when to share,

226
0:10:45.966,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and how to recognize and celebrate insight

227
0:10:48.395,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and being able to construct ahas is a very powerful tool.

228
0:10:52.673,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Think of how powerful and exciting and convincing an idea is

229
0:10:57.531,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that comes from your own mind,

230
0:10:59.721,000 --> 0:11:01,000
where you make all the connections yourself.

231
0:11:03.094,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So in January of 2017,

232
0:11:05.419,000 --> 0:11:09,000
after tens of thousands of hours of work,

233
0:11:09.49,000 --> 0:11:11,000
we finally run our Mystery Hunt.

234
0:11:11.99,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And it's a different sort of satisfaction than the quick high of an aha moment.

235
0:11:16.577,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Instead, it's the slow burn of saying something through perplexing abstraction,

236
0:11:21.292,000 --> 0:11:22,000
yet being understood.

237
0:11:23.085,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And when it was all over,

238
0:11:24.68,000 --> 0:11:27,000
in our exhaustion, we turned to each other and the world, and we said,

239
0:11:28.015,000 --> 0:11:3,000
"We're never doing this again. It's too much work.

240
0:11:30.821,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It's really fun, but no more winning."

241
0:11:34.109,000 --> 0:11:37,000
One year later, in January of 2018,

242
0:11:37.53,000 --> 0:11:38,000
we won the MIT Mystery Hunt again.

243
0:11:39.539,000 --> 0:11:4,000
(Laughter)

244
0:11:41.245,000 --> 0:11:44,000
So, we're currently I don't know how many tens of thousands of hours of work in,

245
0:11:45.031,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and we're two months out from the 2019 Hunt.

246
0:11:47.458,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So, thank you for listening, I have to go write a puzzle.

247
0:11:50.175,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Laughter)

248
0:11:51.444,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Applause)

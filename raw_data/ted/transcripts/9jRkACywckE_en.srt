1
0:00:12.656,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I was a young officer, they told me

2
0:00:14.626,000 --> 0:00:16,000
to follow my instincts,

3
0:00:16.894,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to go with my gut,

4
0:00:19.15,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and what I've learned

5
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
is that often our instincts are wrong.

6
0:00:25.544,000 --> 0:00:28,000
In the summer of 2010,

7
0:00:28.72,000 --> 0:00:31,000
there was a massive leak of classified documents

8
0:00:32.059,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that came out of the Pentagon.

9
0:00:35.032,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It shocked the world,

10
0:00:36.848,000 --> 0:00:37,000
it shook up the American government,

11
0:00:38.423,000 --> 0:00:4,000
and it made people ask a lot of questions,

12
0:00:40.576,000 --> 0:00:42,000
because the sheer amount of information

13
0:00:43.257,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that was let out, and the potential impacts,

14
0:00:46.832,000 --> 0:00:48,000
were significant.

15
0:00:49.408,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And one of the first questions we asked ourselves

16
0:00:53.43,000 --> 0:00:55,000
was why would a young soldier have access

17
0:00:56.148,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to that much information?

18
0:00:59.08,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Why would we let sensitive things

19
0:01:01.606,000 --> 0:01:05,000
be with a relatively young person?

20
0:01:05.764,000 --> 0:01:08,000
In the summer of 2003, I was assigned to command

21
0:01:08.886,000 --> 0:01:1,000
a special operations task force,

22
0:01:11.39,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and that task force was spread across the Mideast

23
0:01:13.53,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to fight al Qaeda.

24
0:01:15.118,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Our main effort was inside Iraq,

25
0:01:18.115,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and our specified mission

26
0:01:20.082,000 --> 0:01:21,000
was to defeat al Qaeda in Iraq.

27
0:01:21.936,000 --> 0:01:24,000
For almost five years I stayed there,

28
0:01:25.04,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and we focused on fighting a war

29
0:01:26.85,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that was unconventional and it was difficult

30
0:01:31.896,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and it was bloody

31
0:01:33.736,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and it often claimed its highest price

32
0:01:36.83,000 --> 0:01:39,000
among innocent people.

33
0:01:39.904,000 --> 0:01:41,000
We did everything we could

34
0:01:42.409,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to stop al Qaeda

35
0:01:44.318,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and the foreign fighters that came in as suicide bombers

36
0:01:47.603,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and as accelerants to the violence.

37
0:01:52.718,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We honed our combat skills,

38
0:01:54.74,000 --> 0:01:56,000
we developed new equipment,

39
0:01:57.576,000 --> 0:01:59,000
we parachuted, we helicoptered,

40
0:02:00.03,000 --> 0:02:02,000
we took small boats, we drove, and we walked

41
0:02:02.488,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to objectives night after night to stop

42
0:02:05.498,000 --> 0:02:1,000
the killing that this network was putting forward.

43
0:02:10.85,000 --> 0:02:12,000
We bled,

44
0:02:13.39,000 --> 0:02:14,000
we died,

45
0:02:14.879,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and we killed to stop that organization

46
0:02:19.73,000 --> 0:02:2,000
from the violence that they were putting

47
0:02:21.473,000 --> 0:02:25,000
largely against the Iraqi people.

48
0:02:25.702,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Now, we did what we knew,

49
0:02:28.28,000 --> 0:02:3,000
how we had grown up, and one of the things that we knew,

50
0:02:31.194,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that was in our DNA, was secrecy.

51
0:02:34.32,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It was security. It was protecting information.

52
0:02:36.237,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It was the idea that information was the lifeblood

53
0:02:39.05,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and it was what would protect and keep people safe.

54
0:02:42.69,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And we had a sense that,

55
0:02:44.585,000 --> 0:02:46,000
as we operated within our organizations,

56
0:02:46.596,000 --> 0:02:47,000
it was important to keep information

57
0:02:48.514,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in the silos within the organizations,

58
0:02:50.825,000 --> 0:02:52,000
particularly only give information

59
0:02:53.739,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to people had a demonstrated need to know.

60
0:02:57.931,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But the question often came, who needed to know?

61
0:03:02.57,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Who needed, who had to have the information

62
0:03:05.933,000 --> 0:03:08,000
so that they could do the important parts of the job that you needed?

63
0:03:09.004,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And in a tightly coupled world,

64
0:03:11.056,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that's very hard to predict.

65
0:03:13.854,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It's very hard to know who needs to have information

66
0:03:16.798,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and who doesn't.

67
0:03:18.305,000 --> 0:03:19,000
I used to deal with intelligence agencies,

68
0:03:20.284,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and I'd complain that they weren't sharing enough intelligence,

69
0:03:22.451,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and with a straight face, they'd look at me and they'd say,

70
0:03:24.841,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"What aren't you getting?" (Laughter)

71
0:03:26.988,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I said, "If I knew that, we wouldn't have a problem."

72
0:03:32.47,000 --> 0:03:33,000
But what we found is we had to change.

73
0:03:34.072,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We had to change our culture about information.

74
0:03:36.249,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We had to knock down walls. We had to share.

75
0:03:38.366,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We had to change from who needs to know

76
0:03:41.434,000 --> 0:03:43,000
to the fact that who doesn't know,

77
0:03:43.557,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and we need to tell, and tell them as quickly as we can.

78
0:03:46.791,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It was a significant culture shift for an organization

79
0:03:49.917,000 --> 0:03:54,000
that had secrecy in its DNA.

80
0:03:55.241,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We started by doing things, by building,

81
0:03:57.517,000 --> 0:03:58,000
not working in offices,

82
0:03:59.222,000 --> 0:04:,000
knocking down walls, working in things we called

83
0:04:00.887,000 --> 0:04:02,000
situation awareness rooms,

84
0:04:03.345,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and in the summer of 2007,

85
0:04:05.821,000 --> 0:04:06,000
something happened which demonstrated this.

86
0:04:07.444,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We captured the personnel records

87
0:04:09.636,000 --> 0:04:11,000
for the people who were bringing foreign fighters

88
0:04:11.836,000 --> 0:04:13,000
into Iraq.

89
0:04:13.991,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And when we got the personnel records, typically,

90
0:04:15.839,000 --> 0:04:16,000
we would have hidden these,

91
0:04:17.153,000 --> 0:04:19,000
shared them with a few intelligence agencies,

92
0:04:19.491,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and then try to operate with them.

93
0:04:21.287,000 --> 0:04:23,000
But as I was talking to my intelligence officer,

94
0:04:23.325,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I said, "What do we do?"

95
0:04:24.175,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And he said, "Well, you found them." Our command.

96
0:04:27.201,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"You can just declassify them."

97
0:04:29.565,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And I said, "Well, can we declassify them?

98
0:04:31.213,000 --> 0:04:32,000
What if the enemy finds out?"

99
0:04:32.223,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And he says, "They're their personnel records."

100
0:04:34.835,000 --> 0:04:35,000
(Laughter)

101
0:04:36.235,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So we did,

102
0:04:37.317,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and a lot of people got upset about that,

103
0:04:39.351,000 --> 0:04:41,000
but as we passed that information around,

104
0:04:41.835,000 --> 0:04:43,000
suddenly you find that information is only of value

105
0:04:44.725,000 --> 0:04:45,000
if you give it to people who have the ability

106
0:04:46.581,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to do something with it.

107
0:04:48.719,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The fact that I know something has zero value

108
0:04:50.845,000 --> 0:04:51,000
if I'm not the person who can actually

109
0:04:52.333,000 --> 0:04:53,000
make something better because of it.

110
0:04:54.207,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So as a consequence, what we did was

111
0:04:56.083,000 --> 0:04:59,000
we changed the idea of information,

112
0:04:59.193,000 --> 0:05:01,000
instead of knowledge is power,

113
0:05:01.477,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to one where sharing is power.

114
0:05:04.423,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It was the fundamental shift,

115
0:05:06.395,000 --> 0:05:08,000
not new tactics, not new weapons,

116
0:05:08.733,000 --> 0:05:09,000
not new anything else.

117
0:05:10.037,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It was the idea that we were now part of a team

118
0:05:12.815,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in which information became the essential link

119
0:05:15.163,000 --> 0:05:19,000
between us, not a block between us.

120
0:05:19.661,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And I want everybody to take a deep breath

121
0:05:22.243,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and let it out,

122
0:05:24.365,000 --> 0:05:25,000
because in your life, there's going to be information

123
0:05:26.299,000 --> 0:05:28,000
that leaks out you're not going to like.

124
0:05:28.631,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Somebody's going to get my college grades out,

125
0:05:30.877,000 --> 0:05:34,000
a that's going to be a disaster. (Laughter)

126
0:05:34.904,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But it's going to be okay, and I will tell you that

127
0:05:38.273,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I am more scared of the bureaucrat

128
0:05:41.493,000 --> 0:05:43,000
that holds information in a desk drawer

129
0:05:43.945,000 --> 0:05:45,000
or in a safe than I am of someone who leaks,

130
0:05:46.741,000 --> 0:05:48,000
because ultimately, we'll be better off if we share.

131
0:05:49.677,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Thank you.

132
0:05:51.437,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Applause)

133
0:05:57.761,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Helen Walters: So I don't know if you were here this morning,

134
0:05:59.337,000 --> 0:06:01,000
if you were able to catch Rick Ledgett,

135
0:06:01.637,000 --> 0:06:02,000
the deputy director of the NSA

136
0:06:03.469,000 --> 0:06:06,000
who was responding to Edward Snowden's talk earlier this week.

137
0:06:07.133,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I just wonder, do you think the American government

138
0:06:09.445,000 --> 0:06:11,000
should give Edward Snowden amnesty?

139
0:06:12.133,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Stanley McChrystal: I think that Rick said something very important.

140
0:06:14.581,000 --> 0:06:16,000
We, most people, don't know all the facts.

141
0:06:17.201,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I think there are two parts of this.

142
0:06:18.553,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Edward Snowden shined a light on an important need

143
0:06:22.293,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that people had to understand.

144
0:06:23.783,000 --> 0:06:25,000
He also took a lot of documents that he didn't have

145
0:06:26.765,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the knowledge to know the importance of,

146
0:06:29.357,000 --> 0:06:31,000
so I think we need to learn the facts about this case

147
0:06:31.79,000 --> 0:06:32,000
before we make snap judgments

148
0:06:33.337,000 --> 0:06:35,000
about Edward Snowden.

149
0:06:35.485,000 --> 0:06:37,000
HW: Thank you so much. Thank you.

150
0:06:37.669,000 --> 0:06:38,000
(Applause)

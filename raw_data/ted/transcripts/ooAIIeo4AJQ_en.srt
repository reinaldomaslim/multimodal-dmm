1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It can be a very complicated thing, the ocean.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And it can be a very complicated thing, what human health is.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And bringing those two together might seem a very daunting task,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but what I'm going to try to say is that

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
even in that complexity,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
there's some simple themes that I think,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
if we understand, we can really move forward.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And those simple themes aren't really

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
themes about the complex science of what's going on,

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but things that we all pretty well know.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And I'm going to start with this one:

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
If momma ain't happy, ain't nobody happy.

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
We know that, right? We've experienced that.

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And if we just take that

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and we build from there,

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
then we can go to the next step,

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
which is that if the ocean ain't happy,

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
ain't nobody happy.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
That's the theme of my talk.

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And we're making the ocean pretty unhappy in a lot of different ways.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
This is a shot of Cannery Row in 1932.

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Cannery Row, at the time,

23
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
had the biggest industrial

24
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
canning operation on the west coast.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
We piled enormous amounts of pollution

26
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
into the air and into the water.

27
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Rolf Bolin, who was a professor

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
at the Hopkin's Marine Station where I work,

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
wrote in the 1940s that

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
"The fumes from the scum floating on the inlets of the bay

31
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
were so bad they turned

32
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
lead-based paints black."

33
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
People working in these canneries

34
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
could barely stay there all day because of the smell,

35
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but you know what they came out saying?

36
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
They say, "You know what you smell?

37
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
You smell money."

38
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
That pollution was money to that community,

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and those people dealt with the pollution

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and absorbed it into their skin and into their bodies

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
because they needed the money.

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We made the ocean unhappy; we made people very unhappy,

43
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and we made them unhealthy.

44
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The connection between ocean health and human health

45
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is actually based upon another couple simple adages,

46
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and I want to call that

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
"pinch a minnow, hurt a whale."

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The pyramid of ocean life ...

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now, when an ecologist looks at the ocean -- I have to tell you --

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
we look at the ocean in a very different way,

51
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and we see different things than when a regular person looks at the ocean

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
because when an ecologist looks at the ocean,

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
we see all those interconnections.

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
We see the base of the food chain,

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the plankton, the small things,

56
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and we see how those animals

57
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
are food to animals in the middle of the pyramid,

58
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and on so up this diagram.

59
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And that flow, that flow of life,

60
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
from the very base up to the very top,

61
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
is the flow that ecologists see.

62
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And that's what we're trying to preserve

63
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
when we say, "Save the ocean. Heal the ocean."

64
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It's that pyramid.

65
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Now why does that matter for human health?

66
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Because when we jam things in the bottom

67
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
of that pyramid that shouldn't be there,

68
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
some very frightening things happen.

69
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Pollutants, some pollutants have been created by us:

70
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
molecules like PCBs

71
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that can't be broken down by our bodies.

72
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And they go in the base of that pyramid,

73
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and they drift up; they're passed up that way,

74
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
on to predators and on to the top predators,

75
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and in so doing,

76
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
they accumulate.

77
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Now, to bring that home, I thought I'd invent a little game.

78
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We don't really have to play it; we can just think about it here.

79
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's the Styrofoam and chocolate game.

80
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Imagine that when we got on this boat,

81
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
we were all given

82
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
two Styrofoam peanuts.

83
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Can't do much with them: Put them in your pocket.

84
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Suppose the rules are: every time you offer somebody a drink,

85
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
you give them the drink,

86
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and you give them your Styrofoam peanuts too.

87
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
What'll happen is that the Styrofoam peanuts

88
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
will start moving through our society here,

89
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and they will accumulate in

90
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
the drunkest, stingiest people.

91
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
(Laughter)

92
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
There's no mechanism in this game

93
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
for them to go anywhere but into

94
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
a bigger and bigger pile

95
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
of indigestible Styrofoam peanuts.

96
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And that's exactly what happens with PDBs

97
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in this food pyramid:

98
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
They accumulate into the top of it.

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Now suppose, instead of Styrofoam peanuts,

100
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
we take these lovely little chocolates that we get

101
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and we had those instead.

102
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Well, some of us would be eating those chocolates

103
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
instead of passing them around,

104
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and instead of accumulating,

105
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
they will just pass into our group here

106
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and not accumulate in any one group

107
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
because they're absorbed by us.

108
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And that's the difference between a PCB

109
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and, say, something natural like an omega-3,

110
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
something we want out of the marine food chain.

111
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
PCBs accumulate.

112
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
We have great examples of that, unfortunately.

113
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
PCBs accumulate in dolphins

114
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
in Sarasota Bay, in Texas, in North Carolina.

115
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
They get into the food chain.

116
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The dolphins eat the fish

117
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
that have PCBs from the plankton,

118
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and those PCBs, being fat-soluble,

119
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
accumulate in these dolphins.

120
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Now, a dolphin,

121
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
mother dolphin, any dolphin --

122
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
there's only one way

123
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that a PCB can get out of a dolphin.

124
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And what's that?

125
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
In mother's milk.

126
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Here's a diagram of the PCB load

127
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
of dolphins in Sarasota Bay.

128
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Adult males: a huge load.

129
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Juveniles: a huge load.

130
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Females after their first calf is already weaned:

131
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
a lower load.

132
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Those females, they're not trying to.

133
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Those females are passing the PCBs

134
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in the fat of their own mother's milk

135
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
into their offspring,

136
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
and their offspring don't survive.

137
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
The death rate in these dolphins,

138
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
for the first calf born of every female dolphin,

139
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is 60 to 80 percent.

140
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
These mothers pump their first offspring

141
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
full of this pollutant,

142
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and most of them die.

143
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Now, the mother then can go and reproduce,

144
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
but what a terrible price to pay

145
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
for the accumulation of this pollutant

146
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
in these animals --

147
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the death of the first-born calf.

148
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
There's another top predator in the ocean, it turns out.

149
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
That top predator, of course, is us.

150
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we also are eating meat

151
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
that comes from some of these same places.

152
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
This is whale meat

153
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that I photographed in a grocery store in Tokyo --

154
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
or is it?

155
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
In fact, what we did a few years ago

156
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
was learn how to smuggle

157
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
a molecular biology lab into Tokyo

158
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and use it to genetically test the DNA

159
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
out of whale meat samples

160
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and identify what they really were.

161
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And some of those whale meat samples were whale meat.

162
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Some of them were illegal whale meat, by the way.

163
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
That's another story.

164
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
But some of them were not whale meat at all.

165
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Even though they were labeled whale meat, they were dolphin meat.

166
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Some of them were dolphin liver. Some of them were dolphin blubber.

167
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
And those dolphin parts

168
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
had a huge load of PCBs,

169
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
dioxins and heavy metals.

170
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And that huge load was passing into the people

171
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that ate this meat.

172
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It turns out that a lot of dolphins

173
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
are being sold as meat

174
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
in the whale meat market around the world.

175
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
That's a tragedy for those populations,

176
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but it's also a tragedy

177
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
for the people eating them

178
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
because they don't know that that's toxic meat.

179
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
We had these data a few years ago.

180
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I remember sitting at my desk

181
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
being about the only person in the world

182
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
who knew that whale meat being sold in these markets

183
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
was really dolphin meat, and it was toxic.

184
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It had two-to-three-to-400 times the toxic loads

185
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
ever allowed by the EPA.

186
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And I remember there sitting at my desk thinking,

187
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
"Well, I know this. This is a great scientific discovery,"

188
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but it was so awful.

189
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And for the very first time in my scientific career,

190
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I broke scientific protocol,

191
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
which is that you take the data and publish them in scientific journals

192
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and then begin to talk about them.

193
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
We sent a very polite letter

194
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to the Minister of Health in Japan

195
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and simply pointed out that

196
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
this is an intolerable situation, not for us,

197
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but for the people of Japan

198
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
because mothers who may be breastfeeding,

199
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
who may have young children,

200
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
would be buying something that they thought was healthy,

201
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
but it was really toxic.

202
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
That led to a whole series of other campaigns in Japan,

203
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and I'm really proud to say that at this point,

204
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
it's very difficult to buy anything in Japan

205
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
that's labeled incorrectly,

206
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
even though they're still selling whale meat,

207
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
which I believe they shouldn't.

208
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
But at least it's labeled correctly,

209
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and you're no longer going to be buying

210
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
toxic dolphin meat instead.

211
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It isn't just there that this happens,

212
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
but in a natural diet of some communities

213
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
in the Canadian arctic and in the United States

214
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and in the European arctic,

215
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
a natural diet of seals and whales

216
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
leads to an accumulation of PCBs

217
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that have gathered up from all parts of the world

218
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and ended up in these women.

219
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
These women have toxic breast milk.

220
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
They cannot feed their offspring, their children,

221
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
their breast milk

222
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
because of the accumulation of these toxins

223
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
in their food chain,

224
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
in their part of the world's

225
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
ocean pyramid.

226
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
That means their immune systems are compromised.

227
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It means that their children's development

228
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
can be compromised.

229
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And the world's attention on this over the last decade

230
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
has reduced the problem

231
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
for these women,

232
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
not by changing the pyramid,

233
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
but by changing what they particularly eat out of it.

234
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
We've taken them out of their natural pyramid

235
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
in order to solve this problem.

236
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
That's a good thing for this particular acute problem,

237
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
but it does nothing to solve the pyramid problem.

238
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
There's other ways of breaking the pyramid.

239
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
The pyramid, if we jam things in the bottom,

240
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
can get backed up like a sewer line that's clogged.

241
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And if we jam nutrients, sewage, fertilizer

242
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in the base of that food pyramid,

243
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
it can back up all through it.

244
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We end up with things we've heard about before:

245
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
red tides, for example,

246
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
which are blooms of toxic algae

247
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
floating through the oceans

248
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
causing neurological damage.

249
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We can also see blooms of bacteria,

250
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
blooms of viruses in the ocean.

251
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
These are two shots of a red tide coming on shore here

252
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and a bacteria

253
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in the genus vibrio,

254
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
which includes the genus that has cholera in it.

255
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
How many people have seen a "beach closed" sign?

256
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Why does that happen?

257
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It happens because we have jammed so much

258
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
into the base of the natural ocean pyramid

259
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that these bacteria clog it up

260
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and overfill onto our beaches.

261
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Often what jams us up is sewage.

262
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Now how many of you have ever gone to a state park or a national park

263
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
where you had a big sign at the front saying,

264
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
"Closed because human sewage

265
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
is so far over this park

266
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
that you can't use it"?

267
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Not very often. We wouldn't tolerate that.

268
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
We wouldn't tolerate our parks

269
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
being swamped by human sewage,

270
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but beaches are closed a lot in our country.

271
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
They're closed more and more and more all around the world for the same reason,

272
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and I believe we shouldn't tolerate that either.

273
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
It's not just a question of cleanliness;

274
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
it's also a question of

275
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
how those organisms

276
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
then turn into human disease.

277
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
These vibrios, these bacteria, can actually infect people.

278
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
They can go into your skin and create skin infections.

279
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This is a graph from NOAA's ocean and human health initiative,

280
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
showing the rise of the infections

281
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
by vibrio in people

282
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
over the last few years.

283
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Surfers, for example, know this incredibly.

284
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And if you can see on some surfing sites,

285
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
in fact, not only do you see

286
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
what the waves are like or what the weather's like,

287
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but on some surf rider sites,

288
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
you see a little flashing poo alert.

289
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
That means that the beach might have great waves,

290
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but it's a dangerous place for surfers to be

291
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because they can carry with them,

292
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
even after a great day of surfing,

293
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
this legacy of an infection that might take a very long time to solve.

294
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Some of these infections are actually carrying

295
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
antibiotic resistance genes now,

296
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and that makes them even more difficult.

297
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
These same infections

298
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
create harmful algal blooms.

299
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Those blooms are generating other kinds of chemicals.

300
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
This is just a simple list of some of the types of poisons

301
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that come out of these harmful algal blooms:

302
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
shellfish poisoning,fish ciguatera,

303
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
diarrheic shellfish poisoning -- you don't want to know about that --

304
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
neurotoxic shellfish poisoning, paralytic shellfish poisoning.

305
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
These are things that are getting into our food chain

306
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because of these blooms.

307
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Rita Calwell very famously

308
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
traced a very interesting story

309
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
of cholera into human communities,

310
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
brought there, not by

311
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
a normal human vector,

312
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
but by a marine vector, this copepod.

313
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Copepods are small crustaceans.

314
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
They're a tiny fraction of an inch long,

315
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and they can carry on their little legs

316
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
some of the cholera bacteria

317
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that then leads to human disease.

318
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
That has sparked cholera epidemics

319
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
in ports along the world

320
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and has led to increased concentration

321
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
on trying to make sure shipping

322
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
doesn't move these

323
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
vectors of cholera around the world.

324
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
So what do you do?

325
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
We have major problems in disrupted ecosystem flow

326
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
that the pyramid may not be working so well,

327
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
that the flow from the base up into it

328
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
is being blocked and clogged.

329
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
What do you do when you have this sort of disrupted flow?

330
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Well, there's a bunch of things you could do.

331
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
You could call Joe the Plumber, for example.

332
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
And he could come in

333
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and fix the flow.

334
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
But in fact, if you look around the world,

335
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
not only are there hope spots

336
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
for where we may be able to fix problems,

337
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
there have been places where problems have been fixed,

338
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
where people have come to grips with these issues

339
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and begun to turn them around.

340
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Monterey is one of those.

341
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I started out showing how much

342
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
we had distressed the Monterey Bay ecosystem

343
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
with pollution and the canning industry

344
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and all of the attendant problems.

345
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
In 1932, that's the picture.

346
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
In 2009, the picture is dramatically different.

347
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
The canneries are gone. The pollution has abated.

348
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
But there's a greater sense here

349
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that what the individual communities need

350
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
is working ecosystems.

351
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
They need a functioning pyramid from the base all the way to the top.

352
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
And that pyramid

353
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
in Monterey, right now,

354
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
because of the efforts of a lot of different people,

355
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
is functioning better than it's ever functioned

356
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
for the last 150 years.

357
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
It didn't happen accidentally.

358
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
It happened because many people put their time and effort

359
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and their pioneering spirit into this.

360
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
On the left there, Julia Platt,

361
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
the mayor of my little hometown in Pacific Grove.

362
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
At 74 years old, became mayor

363
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
because something had to be done

364
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
to protect the ocean.

365
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
In 1931, she produced California's first

366
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
community-based marine protected area,

367
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
right next to the biggest polluting cannery,

368
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
because Julia knew

369
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that when the canneries eventually were gone,

370
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
the ocean needed a place to grow from,

371
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
that the ocean needed a place to spark a seed,

372
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and she wanted to provide that seed.

373
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Other people, like David Packard and Julie Packard,

374
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
who were instrumental in producing the Monterey Bay aquarium

375
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
to lock into people's notion

376
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
that the ocean

377
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and the health of the ocean ecosystem

378
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
were just as important to the economy of this area

379
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
as eating the ecosystem would be.

380
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
That change in thinking has led to a dramatic shift,

381
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
not only in the fortunes of Monterey Bay,

382
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
but other places around the world.

383
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
Well, I want to leave you with the thought that

384
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
what we're really trying to do here

385
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
is protect this ocean pyramid,

386
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and that ocean pyramid

387
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
connects to our own pyramid of life.

388
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
It's an ocean planet,

389
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
and we think of ourselves as a terrestrial species,

390
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
but the pyramid of life in the ocean

391
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
and our own lives on land

392
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
are intricately connected.

393
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And it's only through having the ocean being healthy

394
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
that we can remain healthy ourselves.

395
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Thank you very much.

396
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
(Applause)

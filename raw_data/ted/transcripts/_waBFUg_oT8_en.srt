1
0:00:12.797,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, a few years ago I was at JFK Airport

2
0:00:15.578,000 --> 0:00:16,000
about to get on a flight,

3
0:00:17.37,000 --> 0:00:18,000
when I was approached by two women

4
0:00:19.186,000 --> 0:00:2,000
who I do not think would be insulted

5
0:00:20.848,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to hear themselves described

6
0:00:22.242,000 --> 0:00:25,000
as tiny old tough-talking Italian-American broads.

7
0:00:26.184,000 --> 0:00:29,000
The taller one, who is like up here,

8
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
she comes marching up to me, and she goes,

9
0:00:31.381,000 --> 0:00:33,000
"Honey, I gotta ask you something.

10
0:00:33.7,000 --> 0:00:34,000
You got something to do with that whole

11
0:00:35.128,000 --> 0:00:38,000
'Eat, Pray, Love' thing that's been going on lately?"

12
0:00:38.15,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And I said, "Yes, I did."

13
0:00:40.264,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And she smacks her friend and she goes,

14
0:00:42.052,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"See, I told you, I said, that's that girl.

15
0:00:44.206,000 --> 0:00:45,000
That's that girl who wrote that book

16
0:00:46.156,000 --> 0:00:48,000
based on that movie."

17
0:00:48.19,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:50.344,000 --> 0:00:52,000
So that's who I am.

19
0:00:52.52,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And believe me, I'm extremely grateful to be that person,

20
0:00:56.225,000 --> 0:00:57,000
because that whole "Eat, Pray, Love" thing

21
0:00:58.223,000 --> 0:00:59,000
was a huge break for me.

22
0:00:59.967,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But it also left me in a really tricky position

23
0:01:02.475,000 --> 0:01:03,000
moving forward as an author

24
0:01:04.383,000 --> 0:01:05,000
trying to figure out how in the world

25
0:01:06.11,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I was ever going to write a book again

26
0:01:07.364,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that would ever please anybody,

27
0:01:09.209,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because I knew well in advance

28
0:01:11.199,000 --> 0:01:13,000
that all of those people who had adored "Eat, Pray, Love"

29
0:01:14.151,000 --> 0:01:15,000
were going to be incredibly disappointed

30
0:01:15.74,000 --> 0:01:16,000
in whatever I wrote next

31
0:01:17.123,000 --> 0:01:18,000
because it wasn't going to be "Eat, Pray, Love,"

32
0:01:18.951,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and all of those people who had hated "Eat, Pray, Love"

33
0:01:21.397,000 --> 0:01:22,000
were going to be incredibly disappointed

34
0:01:22.765,000 --> 0:01:23,000
in whatever I wrote next

35
0:01:24.208,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because it would provide evidence that I still lived.

36
0:01:26.661,000 --> 0:01:29,000
So I knew that I had no way to win,

37
0:01:29.823,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and knowing that I had no way to win

38
0:01:32.279,000 --> 0:01:33,000
made me seriously consider for a while

39
0:01:34.183,000 --> 0:01:35,000
just quitting the game

40
0:01:35.625,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and moving to the country to raise corgis.

41
0:01:39.267,000 --> 0:01:41,000
But if I had done that, if I had given up writing,

42
0:01:41.327,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I would have lost my beloved vocation,

43
0:01:43.391,000 --> 0:01:45,000
so I knew that the task was that I had to find

44
0:01:45.599,000 --> 0:01:47,000
some way to gin up the inspiration

45
0:01:47.998,000 --> 0:01:48,000
to write the next book

46
0:01:49.43,000 --> 0:01:51,000
regardless of its inevitable negative outcome.

47
0:01:51.926,000 --> 0:01:52,000
In other words, I had to find a way to make sure

48
0:01:53.534,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that my creativity survived its own success.

49
0:01:56.177,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And I did, in the end, find that inspiration,

50
0:01:58.6,000 --> 0:01:59,000
but I found it in the most unlikely

51
0:02:00.138,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and unexpected place.

52
0:02:01.552,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I found it in lessons that I had learned earlier in life

53
0:02:04.692,000 --> 0:02:07,000
about how creativity can survive its own failure.

54
0:02:07.8,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So just to back up and explain,

55
0:02:09.406,000 --> 0:02:11,000
the only thing I have ever wanted to be

56
0:02:11.719,000 --> 0:02:12,000
for my whole life was a writer.

57
0:02:13.316,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I wrote all through childhood, all through adolescence,

58
0:02:15.688,000 --> 0:02:16,000
by the time I was a teenager I was sending

59
0:02:17.504,000 --> 0:02:18,000
my very bad stories to The New Yorker,

60
0:02:19.34,000 --> 0:02:2,000
hoping to be discovered.

61
0:02:20.616,000 --> 0:02:22,000
After college, I got a job as a diner waitress,

62
0:02:23.06,000 --> 0:02:25,000
kept working, kept writing,

63
0:02:25.196,000 --> 0:02:27,000
kept trying really hard to get published,

64
0:02:27.444,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and failing at it.

65
0:02:29.156,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I failed at getting published

66
0:02:30.628,000 --> 0:02:31,000
for almost six years.

67
0:02:32.204,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So for almost six years, every single day,

68
0:02:33.812,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I had nothing but rejection letters

69
0:02:35.468,000 --> 0:02:36,000
waiting for me in my mailbox.

70
0:02:37.12,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And it was devastating every single time,

71
0:02:38.87,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and every single time, I had to ask myself

72
0:02:41.114,000 --> 0:02:43,000
if I should just quit while I was behind

73
0:02:43.5,000 --> 0:02:46,000
and give up and spare myself this pain.

74
0:02:47.19,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But then I would find my resolve,

75
0:02:48.484,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and always in the same way,

76
0:02:50.006,000 --> 0:02:52,000
by saying, "I'm not going to quit,

77
0:02:52.151,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I'm going home."

78
0:02:53.972,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And you have to understand that for me,

79
0:02:54.92,000 --> 0:02:57,000
going home did not mean returning to my family's farm.

80
0:02:58.492,000 --> 0:02:59,000
For me, going home

81
0:03:00.05,000 --> 0:03:01,000
meant returning to the work of writing

82
0:03:01.601,000 --> 0:03:02,000
because writing was my home,

83
0:03:03.486,000 --> 0:03:06,000
because I loved writing more than I hated failing at writing,

84
0:03:06.702,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which is to say that I loved writing

85
0:03:08.207,000 --> 0:03:09,000
more than I loved my own ego,

86
0:03:09.78,000 --> 0:03:1,000
which is ultimately to say

87
0:03:11.184,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that I loved writing more than I loved myself.

88
0:03:13.776,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And that's how I pushed through it.

89
0:03:15.742,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But the weird thing is that 20 years later,

90
0:03:17.606,000 --> 0:03:18,000
during the crazy ride of "Eat, Pray, Love,"

91
0:03:19.104,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I found myself identifying all over again

92
0:03:21.71,000 --> 0:03:23,000
with that unpublished young diner waitress

93
0:03:24.11,000 --> 0:03:26,000
who I used to be, thinking about her constantly,

94
0:03:26.278,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and feeling like I was her again,

95
0:03:28.136,000 --> 0:03:29,000
which made no rational sense whatsoever

96
0:03:29.901,000 --> 0:03:3,000
because our lives could not have been more different.

97
0:03:31.878,000 --> 0:03:32,000
She had failed constantly.

98
0:03:33.326,000 --> 0:03:35,000
I had succeeded beyond my wildest expectation.

99
0:03:35.97,000 --> 0:03:36,000
We had nothing in common.

100
0:03:37.32,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Why did I suddenly feel like I was her all over again?

101
0:03:40.486,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And it was only when I was trying to unthread that

102
0:03:42.856,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that I finally began to comprehend

103
0:03:44.458,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the strange and unlikely psychological connection

104
0:03:46.862,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in our lives between the way we experience great failure

105
0:03:49.396,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and the way we experience great success.

106
0:03:51.632,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So think of it like this:

107
0:03:53.102,000 --> 0:03:54,000
For most of your life, you live out your existence

108
0:03:54.852,000 --> 0:03:56,000
here in the middle of the chain of human experience

109
0:03:57.295,000 --> 0:04:,000
where everything is normal and reassuring and regular,

110
0:04:00.373,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but failure catapults you abruptly way out over here

111
0:04:03.833,000 --> 0:04:05,000
into the blinding darkness of disappointment.

112
0:04:06.767,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Success catapults you just as abruptly but just as far

113
0:04:10.321,000 --> 0:04:11,000
way out over here

114
0:04:11.689,000 --> 0:04:12,000
into the equally blinding glare

115
0:04:13.551,000 --> 0:04:15,000
of fame and recognition and praise.

116
0:04:16.403,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And one of these fates

117
0:04:17.605,000 --> 0:04:19,000
is objectively seen by the world as bad,

118
0:04:19.822,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and the other one is objectively seen by the world as good,

119
0:04:21.879,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but your subconscious is completely incapable

120
0:04:24.527,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of discerning the difference between bad and good.

121
0:04:27.255,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The only thing that it is capable of feeling

122
0:04:29.396,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is the absolute value of this emotional equation,

123
0:04:32.856,000 --> 0:04:34,000
the exact distance that you have been flung

124
0:04:35.471,000 --> 0:04:36,000
from yourself.

125
0:04:36.839,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And there's a real equal danger in both cases

126
0:04:38.895,000 --> 0:04:39,000
of getting lost out there

127
0:04:40.441,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in the hinterlands of the psyche.

128
0:04:42.465,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But in both cases, it turns out that there is

129
0:04:43.998,000 --> 0:04:45,000
also the same remedy for self-restoration,

130
0:04:46.822,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and that is that you have got to find your way back home again

131
0:04:50.42,000 --> 0:04:52,000
as swiftly and smoothly as you can,

132
0:04:52.687,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and if you're wondering what your home is,

133
0:04:54.159,000 --> 0:04:55,000
here's a hint:

134
0:04:55.245,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Your home is whatever in this world you love

135
0:04:57.471,000 --> 0:04:58,000
more than you love yourself.

136
0:04:59.385,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So that might be creativity, it might be family,

137
0:05:01.471,000 --> 0:05:02,000
it might be invention, adventure,

138
0:05:03.447,000 --> 0:05:05,000
faith, service, it might be raising corgis,

139
0:05:06.239,000 --> 0:05:07,000
I don't know, your home is that thing

140
0:05:08.139,000 --> 0:05:09,000
to which you can dedicate your energies

141
0:05:09.911,000 --> 0:05:11,000
with such singular devotion

142
0:05:11.957,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that the ultimate results become inconsequential.

143
0:05:15.359,000 --> 0:05:17,000
For me, that home has always been writing.

144
0:05:17.863,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So after the weird, disorienting success

145
0:05:20.435,000 --> 0:05:21,000
that I went through with "Eat, Pray, Love,"

146
0:05:22.133,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I realized that all I had to do was exactly

147
0:05:23.547,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the same thing that I used to have to do all the time

148
0:05:25.531,000 --> 0:05:27,000
when I was an equally disoriented failure.

149
0:05:27.761,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I had to get my ass back to work,

150
0:05:29.539,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and that's what I did, and that's how, in 2010,

151
0:05:32.047,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I was able to publish the dreaded follow-up

152
0:05:34.401,000 --> 0:05:34,000
to "Eat, Pray, Love."

153
0:05:35.289,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And you know what happened with that book?

154
0:05:36.865,000 --> 0:05:38,000
It bombed, and I was fine.

155
0:05:39.576,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Actually, I kind of felt bulletproof,

156
0:05:41.425,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because I knew that I had broken the spell

157
0:05:43.545,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and I had found my way back home

158
0:05:45.19,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to writing for the sheer devotion of it.

159
0:05:47.801,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And I stayed in my home of writing after that,

160
0:05:49.937,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and I wrote another book that just came out last year

161
0:05:51.769,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and that one was really beautifully received,

162
0:05:53.414,000 --> 0:05:54,000
which is very nice, but not my point.

163
0:05:54.91,000 --> 0:05:56,000
My point is that I'm writing another one now,

164
0:05:57.2,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and I'll write another book after that

165
0:05:58.387,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and another and another and another

166
0:06:00.217,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and many of them will fail,

167
0:06:01.415,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and some of them might succeed,

168
0:06:03.043,000 --> 0:06:04,000
but I will always be safe

169
0:06:04.639,000 --> 0:06:06,000
from the random hurricanes of outcome

170
0:06:07.011,000 --> 0:06:1,000
as long as I never forget where I rightfully live.

171
0:06:10.561,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Look, I don't know where you rightfully live,

172
0:06:12.963,000 --> 0:06:13,000
but I know that there's something in this world

173
0:06:14.633,000 --> 0:06:16,000
that you love more than you love yourself.

174
0:06:16.705,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Something worthy, by the way,

175
0:06:18.12,000 --> 0:06:19,000
so addiction and infatuation don't count,

176
0:06:20.111,000 --> 0:06:24,000
because we all know that those are not safe places to live. Right?

177
0:06:24.218,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The only trick is that you've got to identify

178
0:06:26.265,000 --> 0:06:28,000
the best, worthiest thing that you love most,

179
0:06:28.729,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and then build your house right on top of it

180
0:06:31.1,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and don't budge from it.

181
0:06:32.977,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And if you should someday, somehow

182
0:06:35.321,000 --> 0:06:36,000
get vaulted out of your home

183
0:06:37.265,000 --> 0:06:39,000
by either great failure or great success,

184
0:06:39.705,000 --> 0:06:41,000
then your job is to fight your way back to that home

185
0:06:41.87,000 --> 0:06:42,000
the only way that it has ever been done,

186
0:06:43.655,000 --> 0:06:45,000
by putting your head down and performing

187
0:06:45.844,000 --> 0:06:46,000
with diligence and devotion

188
0:06:47.666,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and respect and reverence

189
0:06:49.352,000 --> 0:06:51,000
whatever the task is that love

190
0:06:51.396,000 --> 0:06:53,000
is calling forth from you next.

191
0:06:53.476,000 --> 0:06:55,000
You just do that, and keep doing that

192
0:06:55.66,000 --> 0:06:56,000
again and again and again,

193
0:06:57.309,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and I can absolutely promise you, from long personal experience

194
0:06:59.965,000 --> 0:07:01,000
in every direction, I can assure you

195
0:07:02.22,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that it's all going to be okay.

196
0:07:04.29,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Thank you.

197
0:07:05.981,000 --> 0:07:09,000
(Applause)

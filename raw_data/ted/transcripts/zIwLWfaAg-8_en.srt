1
0:00:12.52,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Chris Anderson: Elon, hey, welcome back to TED.

2
0:00:15.56,000 --> 0:00:16,000
It's great to have you here.

3
0:00:16.96,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Elon Musk: Thanks for having me.

4
0:00:18.56,000 --> 0:00:2,000
CA: So, in the next half hour or so,

5
0:00:21.44,000 --> 0:00:22,000
we're going to spend some time

6
0:00:23.28,000 --> 0:00:26,000
exploring your vision for what an exciting future might look like,

7
0:00:27.2,000 --> 0:00:31,000
which I guess makes the first question a little ironic:

8
0:00:31.32,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Why are you boring?

9
0:00:33.08,000 --> 0:00:34,000
EM: Yeah.

10
0:00:34.32,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I ask myself that frequently.

11
0:00:39.24,000 --> 0:00:43,000
We're trying to dig a hole under LA,

12
0:00:43.4,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and this is to create the beginning

13
0:00:46.6,000 --> 0:00:5,000
of what will hopefully be a 3D network of tunnels

14
0:00:51.52,000 --> 0:00:53,000
to alleviate congestion.

15
0:00:53.76,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So right now, one of the most soul-destroying things is traffic.

16
0:00:59.32,000 --> 0:01:01,000
It affects people in every part of the world.

17
0:01:02.2,000 --> 0:01:05,000
It takes away so much of your life.

18
0:01:06.04,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's horrible.

19
0:01:08.04,000 --> 0:01:09,000
It's particularly horrible in LA.

20
0:01:09.68,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

21
0:01:12.36,000 --> 0:01:13,000
CA: I think you've brought with you

22
0:01:14.32,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the first visualization that's been shown of this.

23
0:01:16.8,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Can I show this?

24
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
EM: Yeah, absolutely. So this is the first time --

25
0:01:20.88,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Just to show what we're talking about.

26
0:01:22.76,000 --> 0:01:24,000
So a couple of key things that are important

27
0:01:24.92,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in having a 3D tunnel network.

28
0:01:28.84,000 --> 0:01:29,000
First of all, you have to be able

29
0:01:30.48,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to integrate the entrance and exit of the tunnel

30
0:01:32.76,000 --> 0:01:34,000
seamlessly into the fabric of the city.

31
0:01:34.84,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So by having an elevator,

32
0:01:38.52,000 --> 0:01:42,000
sort of a car skate, that's on an elevator,

33
0:01:43.32,000 --> 0:01:46,000
you can integrate the entrance and exits to the tunnel network

34
0:01:47.28,000 --> 0:01:49,000
just by using two parking spaces.

35
0:01:50.84,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And then the car gets on a skate.

36
0:01:52.96,000 --> 0:01:53,000
There's no speed limit here,

37
0:01:54.36,000 --> 0:01:59,000
so we're designing this to be able to operate at 200 kilometers an hour.

38
0:01:59.4,000 --> 0:02:,000
CA: How much?

39
0:02:00.64,000 --> 0:02:03,000
EM: 200 kilometers an hour, or about 130 miles per hour.

40
0:02:04.8,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So you should be able to get from, say, Westwood to LAX

41
0:02:11.04,000 --> 0:02:13,000
in six minutes -- five, six minutes.

42
0:02:13.32,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Applause)

43
0:02:17.68,000 --> 0:02:18,000
CA: So possibly, initially done,

44
0:02:19.28,000 --> 0:02:21,000
it's like on a sort of toll road-type basis.

45
0:02:21.6,000 --> 0:02:22,000
EM: Yeah.

46
0:02:22.84,000 --> 0:02:24,000
CA: Which, I guess, alleviates some traffic

47
0:02:24.92,000 --> 0:02:25,000
from the surface streets as well.

48
0:02:26.64,000 --> 0:02:28,000
EM: So, I don't know if people noticed it in the video,

49
0:02:29.28,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but there's no real limit to how many levels of tunnel you can have.

50
0:02:34.44,000 --> 0:02:36,000
You can go much further deep than you can go up.

51
0:02:37.28,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The deepest mines are much deeper than the tallest buildings are tall,

52
0:02:41.48,000 --> 0:02:46,000
so you can alleviate any arbitrary level of urban congestion

53
0:02:46.76,000 --> 0:02:47,000
with a 3D tunnel network.

54
0:02:48.08,000 --> 0:02:49,000
This is a very important point.

55
0:02:49.64,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So a key rebuttal to the tunnels is that if you add one layer of tunnels,

56
0:02:56.04,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that will simply alleviate congestion, it will get used up,

57
0:02:58.84,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and then you'll be back where you started, back with congestion.

58
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
But you can go to any arbitrary number of tunnels,

59
0:03:04.6,000 --> 0:03:05,000
any number of levels.

60
0:03:05.96,000 --> 0:03:08,000
CA: But people -- seen traditionally, it's incredibly expensive to dig,

61
0:03:09.52,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and that would block this idea.

62
0:03:11.32,000 --> 0:03:12,000
EM: Yeah.

63
0:03:13.04,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Well, they're right.

64
0:03:14.28,000 --> 0:03:17,000
To give you an example, the LA subway extension,

65
0:03:18.08,000 --> 0:03:21,000
which is -- I think it's a two-and-a-half mile extension

66
0:03:21.76,000 --> 0:03:23,000
that was just completed for two billion dollars.

67
0:03:24.023,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile to do the subway extension in LA.

68
0:03:29.44,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And this is not the highest utility subway in the world.

69
0:03:33.44,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So yeah, it's quite difficult to dig tunnels normally.

70
0:03:37.96,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I think we need to have at least a tenfold improvement

71
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in the cost per mile of tunneling.

72
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:45,000
CA: And how could you achieve that?

73
0:03:48.24,000 --> 0:03:5,000
EM: Actually, if you just do two things,

74
0:03:50.32,000 --> 0:03:53,000
you can get to approximately an order of magnitude improvement,

75
0:03:53.68,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and I think you can go beyond that.

76
0:03:55.88,000 --> 0:03:59,000
So the first thing to do is to cut the tunnel diameter

77
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:01,000
by a factor of two or more.

78
0:04:01.8,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So a single road lane tunnel according to regulations

79
0:04:05.8,000 --> 0:04:07,000
has to be 26 feet, maybe 28 feet in diameter

80
0:04:08.68,000 --> 0:04:11,000
to allow for crashes and emergency vehicles

81
0:04:11.88,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and sufficient ventilation for combustion engine cars.

82
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
But if you shrink that diameter to what we're attempting,

83
0:04:19.76,000 --> 0:04:22,000
which is 12 feet, which is plenty to get an electric skate through,

84
0:04:23.44,000 --> 0:04:26,000
you drop the diameter by a factor of two

85
0:04:26.68,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and the cross-sectional area by a factor of four,

86
0:04:30.6,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and the tunneling cost scales with the cross-sectional area.

87
0:04:33.48,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So that's roughly a half-order of magnitude improvement right there.

88
0:04:36.72,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Then tunneling machines currently tunnel for half the time, then they stop,

89
0:04:41.64,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and then the rest of the time is putting in reinforcements

90
0:04:44.84,000 --> 0:04:45,000
for the tunnel wall.

91
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So if you design the machine instead

92
0:04:48.4,000 --> 0:04:5,000
to do continuous tunneling and reinforcing,

93
0:04:50.76,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that will give you a factor of two improvement.

94
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Combine that and that's a factor of eight.

95
0:04:55.24,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Also these machines are far from being at their power or thermal limits,

96
0:04:59.92,000 --> 0:05:02,000
so you can jack up the power to the machine substantially.

97
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I think you can get at least a factor of two,

98
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
maybe a factor of four or five improvement on top of that.

99
0:05:09.36,000 --> 0:05:13,000
So I think there's a fairly straightforward series of steps

100
0:05:13.6,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to get somewhere in excess of an order of magnitude improvement

101
0:05:16.6,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in the cost per mile,

102
0:05:18.36,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and our target actually is --

103
0:05:21.32,000 --> 0:05:23,000
we've got a pet snail called Gary,

104
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
this is from Gary the snail from "South Park,"

105
0:05:26.72,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I mean, sorry, "SpongeBob SquarePants."

106
0:05:29.68,000 --> 0:05:3,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:31.28,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So Gary is capable of --

108
0:05:35.72,000 --> 0:05:39,000
currently he's capable of going 14 times faster

109
0:05:39.84,000 --> 0:05:4,000
than a tunnel-boring machine.

110
0:05:41.64,000 --> 0:05:43,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:44.44,000 --> 0:05:45,000
CA: You want to beat Gary.

112
0:05:46.24,000 --> 0:05:47,000
EM: We want to beat Gary.

113
0:05:47.56,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughter)

114
0:05:49.12,000 --> 0:05:51,000
He's not a patient little fellow,

115
0:05:51.36,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and that will be victory.

116
0:05:54.48,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Victory is beating the snail.

117
0:05:57.28,000 --> 0:06:,000
CA: But a lot of people imagining, dreaming about future cities,

118
0:06:00.36,000 --> 0:06:03,000
they imagine that actually the solution is flying cars, drones, etc.

119
0:06:04.28,000 --> 0:06:06,000
You go aboveground.

120
0:06:06.52,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Why isn't that a better solution?

121
0:06:08.36,000 --> 0:06:09,000
You save all that tunneling cost.

122
0:06:10.36,000 --> 0:06:12,000
EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things.

123
0:06:12.6,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Obviously, I do rockets, so I like things that fly.

124
0:06:16.48,000 --> 0:06:18,000
This is not some inherent bias against flying things,

125
0:06:19.44,000 --> 0:06:22,000
but there is a challenge with flying cars

126
0:06:22.52,000 --> 0:06:25,000
in that they'll be quite noisy,

127
0:06:25.84,000 --> 0:06:27,000
the wind force generated will be very high.

128
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Let's just say that if something's flying over your head,

129
0:06:34.72,000 --> 0:06:36,000
a whole bunch of flying cars going all over the place,

130
0:06:38.44,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that is not an anxiety-reducing situation.

131
0:06:43.08,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:45.2,000 --> 0:06:48,000
You don't think to yourself, "Well, I feel better about today."

133
0:06:50.52,000 --> 0:06:52,000
You're thinking, "Did they service their hubcap,

134
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
or is it going to come off and guillotine me?"

135
0:06:56.08,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Things like that.

136
0:07:00.32,000 --> 0:07:01,000
CA: So you've got this vision

137
0:07:01.92,000 --> 0:07:06,000
of future cities with these rich, 3D networks of tunnels underneath.

138
0:07:07.24,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop?

139
0:07:09.28,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Could you apply these tunnels to use for this Hyperloop idea

140
0:07:12.84,000 --> 0:07:13,000
you released a few years ago.

141
0:07:14.84,000 --> 0:07:17,000
EM: Yeah, so we've been sort of puttering around

142
0:07:18.08,000 --> 0:07:2,000
with the Hyperloop stuff for a while.

143
0:07:20.72,000 --> 0:07:23,000
We built a Hyperloop test track adjacent to SpaceX,

144
0:07:24.56,000 --> 0:07:26,000
just for a student competition,

145
0:07:26.72,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to encourage innovative ideas in transport.

146
0:07:29.76,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And it actually ends up being the biggest vacuum chamber in the world

147
0:07:34.8,000 --> 0:07:35,000
after the Large Hadron Collider,

148
0:07:37.8,000 --> 0:07:38,000
by volume.

149
0:07:41.32,000 --> 0:07:46,000
So it was quite fun to do that, but it was kind of a hobby thing,

150
0:07:46.8,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and then we think we might --

151
0:07:50.52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
so we've built a little pusher car to push the student pods,

152
0:07:56.44,000 --> 0:07:59,000
but we're going to try seeing how fast we can make the pusher go

153
0:08:00.4,000 --> 0:08:01,000
if it's not pushing something.

154
0:08:02.72,000 --> 0:08:04,000
So we're cautiously optimistic

155
0:08:05.08,000 --> 0:08:1,000
we'll be able to be faster than the world's fastest bullet train

156
0:08:10.12,000 --> 0:08:12,000
even in a .8-mile stretch.

157
0:08:12.4,000 --> 0:08:14,000
CA: Whoa. Good brakes.

158
0:08:14.96,000 --> 0:08:16,000
EM: Yeah, I mean, it's -- yeah.

159
0:08:17.24,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's either going to smash into tiny pieces or go quite fast.

160
0:08:21.88,000 --> 0:08:24,000
CA: But you can picture, then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel

161
0:08:25.48,000 --> 0:08:26,000
running quite long distances.

162
0:08:27.32,000 --> 0:08:28,000
EM: Exactly.

163
0:08:29.04,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And looking at tunneling technology,

164
0:08:30.84,000 --> 0:08:32,000
it turns out that in order to make a tunnel,

165
0:08:33.4,000 --> 0:08:34,000
you have to --

166
0:08:36.32,000 --> 0:08:38,000
In order to seal against the water table,

167
0:08:38.72,000 --> 0:08:42,000
you've got to typically design a tunnel wall to be good

168
0:08:43.4,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to about five or six atmospheres.

169
0:08:47.159,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere,

170
0:08:50.2,000 --> 0:08:51,000
or near-vacuum.

171
0:08:51.64,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So actually, it sort of turns out that automatically,

172
0:08:56.08,000 --> 0:08:59,000
if you build a tunnel that is good enough to resist the water table,

173
0:09:00.08,000 --> 0:09:02,000
it is automatically capable of holding vacuum.

174
0:09:02.52,000 --> 0:09:03,000
CA: Huh.

175
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:05,000
EM: So, yeah.

176
0:09:05.72,000 --> 0:09:06,000
CA: And so you could actually picture,

177
0:09:07.6,000 --> 0:09:12,000
what kind of length tunnel is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop?

178
0:09:13.32,000 --> 0:09:16,000
EM: I think there's no real length limit.

179
0:09:16.56,000 --> 0:09:19,000
You could dig as much as you want.

180
0:09:19.6,000 --> 0:09:21,000
I think if you were to do something

181
0:09:21.84,000 --> 0:09:26,000
like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop,

182
0:09:27.04,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I think you'd probably want to go underground the entire way

183
0:09:29.92,000 --> 0:09:3,000
because it's a high-density area.

184
0:09:31.56,000 --> 0:09:35,000
You're going under a lot of buildings and houses,

185
0:09:35.64,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and if you go deep enough,

186
0:09:37.2,000 --> 0:09:39,000
you cannot detect the tunnel.

187
0:09:39.6,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Sometimes people think, well, it's going to be pretty annoying

188
0:09:42.56,000 --> 0:09:43,000
to have a tunnel dug under my house.

189
0:09:44.44,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Like, if that tunnel is dug

190
0:09:45.8,000 --> 0:09:48,000
more than about three or four tunnel diameters beneath your house,

191
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
you will not be able to detect it being dug at all.

192
0:09:52.88,000 --> 0:09:58,000
In fact, if you're able to detect the tunnel being dug,

193
0:09:59.6,000 --> 0:10:,000
whatever device you are using,

194
0:10:01.24,000 --> 0:10:04,000
you can get a lot of money for that device from the Israeli military,

195
0:10:04.53,000 --> 0:10:06,000
who is trying to detect tunnels from Hamas,

196
0:10:07.636,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and from the US Customs and Border patrol that try and detect drug tunnels.

197
0:10:12.44,000 --> 0:10:15,000
So the reality is

198
0:10:15.68,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that earth is incredibly good at absorbing vibrations,

199
0:10:19.56,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and once the tunnel depth is below a certain level,

200
0:10:22.56,000 --> 0:10:23,000
it is undetectable.

201
0:10:24.56,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Maybe if you have a very sensitive seismic instrument,

202
0:10:27.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
you might be able to detect it.

203
0:10:29.28,000 --> 0:10:31,000
CA: So you've started a new company to do this

204
0:10:31.68,000 --> 0:10:32,000
called The Boring Company.

205
0:10:33.4,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Very nice. Very funny.

206
0:10:35.36,000 --> 0:10:36,000
(Laughter)

207
0:10:36.76,000 --> 0:10:37,000
EM: What's funny about that?

208
0:10:38.28,000 --> 0:10:4,000
(Laughter)

209
0:10:40.92,000 --> 0:10:41,000
CA: How much of your time is this?

210
0:10:43.6,000 --> 0:10:46,000
EM: It's maybe ...

211
0:10:47.68,000 --> 0:10:48,000
two or three percent.

212
0:10:49.44,000 --> 0:10:5,000
CA: You've called it a hobby.

213
0:10:50.88,000 --> 0:10:52,000
This is what an Elon Musk hobby looks like.

214
0:10:53.52,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Laughter)

215
0:10:54.56,000 --> 0:10:56,000
EM: I mean, it really is, like --

216
0:10:57.04,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This is basically interns and people doing it part time.

217
0:11:03.32,000 --> 0:11:07,000
We bought some second-hand machinery.

218
0:11:08.04,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It's kind of puttering along, but it's making good progress, so --

219
0:11:12,000 --> 0:11:13,000
CA: So an even bigger part of your time

220
0:11:13.92,000 --> 0:11:17,000
is being spent on electrifying cars and transport through Tesla.

221
0:11:19.44,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Is one of the motivations for the tunneling project

222
0:11:22.04,000 --> 0:11:24,000
the realization that actually,

223
0:11:24.6,000 --> 0:11:27,000
in a world where cars are electric and where they're self-driving,

224
0:11:28.04,000 --> 0:11:31,000
there may end up being more cars on the roads

225
0:11:31.6,000 --> 0:11:33,000
on any given hour than there are now?

226
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:35,000
EM: Yeah, exactly.

227
0:11:38.04,000 --> 0:11:42,000
A lot of people think that when you make cars autonomous,

228
0:11:42.36,000 --> 0:11:46,000
they'll be able to go faster and that will alleviate congestion.

229
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And to some degree that will be true,

230
0:11:48.92,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but once you have shared autonomy where it's much cheaper to go by car

231
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and you can go point to point,

232
0:11:56.96,000 --> 0:12:01,000
the affordability of going in a car will be better than that of a bus.

233
0:12:02.12,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket.

234
0:12:04.36,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So the amount of driving that will occur will be much greater with shared autonomy,

235
0:12:09.44,000 --> 0:12:11,000
and actually traffic will get far worse.

236
0:12:12.32,000 --> 0:12:16,000
CA: You started Tesla with the goal of persuading the world

237
0:12:16.6,000 --> 0:12:19,000
that electrification was the future of cars,

238
0:12:19.76,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and a few years ago, people were laughing at you.

239
0:12:22.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Now, not so much.

240
0:12:24.64,000 --> 0:12:25,000
EM: OK.

241
0:12:25.88,000 --> 0:12:26,000
(Laughter)

242
0:12:27.84,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I don't know. I don't know.

243
0:12:30.08,000 --> 0:12:33,000
CA: But isn't it true that pretty much every auto manufacturer

244
0:12:33.52,000 --> 0:12:36,000
has announced serious electrification plans

245
0:12:36.56,000 --> 0:12:38,000
for the short- to medium-term future?

246
0:12:4,000 --> 0:12:41,000
EM: Yeah. Yeah.

247
0:12:43.28,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I think almost every automaker has some electric vehicle program.

248
0:12:48.28,000 --> 0:12:49,000
They vary in seriousness.

249
0:12:49.56,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Some are very serious about transitioning entirely to electric,

250
0:12:53.88,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and some are just dabbling in it.

251
0:12:57.28,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And some, amazingly, are still pursuing fuel cells,

252
0:12:59.72,000 --> 0:13:01,000
but I think that won't last much longer.

253
0:13:01.88,000 --> 0:13:03,000
CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon,

254
0:13:03.96,000 --> 0:13:06,000
where you can now just declare victory and say, you know, "We did it."

255
0:13:07.68,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Let the world electrify, and you go on and focus on other stuff?

256
0:13:13.52,000 --> 0:13:14,000
EM: Yeah.

257
0:13:16.32,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I intend to stay with Tesla as far into the future as I can imagine,

258
0:13:20.92,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and there are a lot of exciting things that we have coming.

259
0:13:25.6,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon.

260
0:13:27.8,000 --> 0:13:3,000
We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck.

261
0:13:32.12,000 --> 0:13:33,000
CA: OK, we're going to come to this.

262
0:13:34.08,000 --> 0:13:38,000
So Model 3, it's supposed to be coming in July-ish.

263
0:13:39.08,000 --> 0:13:43,000
EM: Yeah, it's looking quite good for starting production in July.

264
0:13:43.64,000 --> 0:13:44,000
CA: Wow.

265
0:13:45.04,000 --> 0:13:47,000
One of the things that people are so excited about

266
0:13:47.44,000 --> 0:13:5,000
is the fact that it's got autopilot.

267
0:13:50.68,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And you put out this video a while back

268
0:13:53.04,000 --> 0:13:58,000
showing what that technology would look like.

269
0:13:58.4,000 --> 0:13:59,000
EM: Yeah.

270
0:13:59.64,000 --> 0:14:01,000
CA: There's obviously autopilot in Model S right now.

271
0:14:02.17,000 --> 0:14:03,000
What are we seeing here?

272
0:14:03.56,000 --> 0:14:09,000
EM: Yeah, so this is using only cameras and GPS.

273
0:14:09.6,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So there's no LIDAR or radar being used here.

274
0:14:12.12,000 --> 0:14:16,000
This is just using passive optical, which is essentially what a person uses.

275
0:14:17.2,000 --> 0:14:19,000
The whole road system is meant to be navigated

276
0:14:19.72,000 --> 0:14:23,000
with passive optical, or cameras,

277
0:14:23.8,000 --> 0:14:26,000
and so once you solve cameras

278
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
or vision,

279
0:14:29.72,000 --> 0:14:3,000
then autonomy is solved.

280
0:14:31.24,000 --> 0:14:33,000
If you don't solve vision, it's not solved.

281
0:14:34.12,000 --> 0:14:4,000
So that's why our focus is so heavily on having a vision neural net

282
0:14:40.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
that's very effective for road conditions.

283
0:14:43.4,000 --> 0:14:45,000
CA: Right. Many other people are going the LIDAR route.

284
0:14:46.04,000 --> 0:14:48,000
You want cameras plus radar is most of it.

285
0:14:48.92,000 --> 0:14:51,000
EM: You can absolutely be superhuman with just cameras.

286
0:14:52.32,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Like, you can probably do it ten times better than humans would,

287
0:14:55.36,000 --> 0:14:56,000
just cameras.

288
0:14:56.64,000 --> 0:15:,000
CA: So the new cars being sold right now have eight cameras in them.

289
0:15:01.12,000 --> 0:15:05,000
They can't yet do what that showed.

290
0:15:05.48,000 --> 0:15:06,000
When will they be able to?

291
0:15:08.44,000 --> 0:15:13,000
EM: I think we're still on track for being able to go cross-country

292
0:15:14.2,000 --> 0:15:18,000
from LA to New York by the end of the year, fully autonomous.

293
0:15:18.4,000 --> 0:15:21,000
CA: OK, so by the end of the year, you're saying,

294
0:15:22.2,000 --> 0:15:25,000
someone's going to sit in a Tesla without touching the steering wheel,

295
0:15:26.2,000 --> 0:15:28,000
tap in "New York," off it goes.

296
0:15:28.72,000 --> 0:15:29,000
EM: Yeah.

297
0:15:29.96,000 --> 0:15:32,000
CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel -- by the end of 2017.

298
0:15:34.28,000 --> 0:15:38,000
EM: Yeah. Essentially, November or December of this year,

299
0:15:38.92,000 --> 0:15:42,000
we should be able to go all the way from a parking lot in California

300
0:15:43.36,000 --> 0:15:44,000
to a parking lot in New York,

301
0:15:45.04,000 --> 0:15:47,000
no controls touched at any point during the entire journey.

302
0:15:48.8,000 --> 0:15:5,000
(Applause)

303
0:15:50.84,000 --> 0:15:51,000
CA: Amazing.

304
0:15:52.08,000 --> 0:15:53,000
But part of that is possible

305
0:15:53.52,000 --> 0:15:56,000
because you've already got a fleet of Teslas driving all these roads.

306
0:15:56.96,000 --> 0:16:,000
You're accumulating a huge amount of data of that national road system.

307
0:16:03.44,000 --> 0:16:05,000
EM: Yes, but the thing that will be interesting

308
0:16:06.12,000 --> 0:16:11,000
is that I'm actually fairly confident it will be able to do that route

309
0:16:12.96,000 --> 0:16:15,000
even if you change the route dynamically.

310
0:16:16.84,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So, it's fairly easy --

311
0:16:20.04,000 --> 0:16:23,000
If you say I'm going to be really good at one specific route, that's one thing,

312
0:16:23.8,000 --> 0:16:28,000
but it should be able to go, really be very good,

313
0:16:28.96,000 --> 0:16:29,000
certainly once you enter a highway,

314
0:16:30.72,000 --> 0:16:32,000
to go anywhere on the highway system

315
0:16:33.52,000 --> 0:16:34,000
in a given country.

316
0:16:36.04,000 --> 0:16:38,000
So it's not sort of limited to LA to New York.

317
0:16:38.36,000 --> 0:16:41,000
We could change it and make it Seattle-Florida,

318
0:16:41.84,000 --> 0:16:43,000
that day, in real time.

319
0:16:44.4,000 --> 0:16:46,000
So you were going from LA to New York.

320
0:16:46.56,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Now go from LA to Toronto.

321
0:16:50.32,000 --> 0:16:52,000
CA: So leaving aside regulation for a second,

322
0:16:53.08,000 --> 0:16:55,000
in terms of the technology alone,

323
0:16:55.88,000 --> 0:16:58,000
the time when someone will be able to buy one of your cars

324
0:16:59.72,000 --> 0:17:02,000
and literally just take the hands off the wheel and go to sleep

325
0:17:03.56,000 --> 0:17:05,000
and wake up and find that they've arrived,

326
0:17:05.64,000 --> 0:17:06,000
how far away is that, to do that safely?

327
0:17:07.6,000 --> 0:17:09,000
EM: I think that's about two years.

328
0:17:09.88,000 --> 0:17:12,000
So the real trick of it is not how do you make it work

329
0:17:13.28,000 --> 0:17:15,000
say 99.9 percent of the time,

330
0:17:16.24,000 --> 0:17:2,000
because, like, if a car crashes one in a thousand times,

331
0:17:20.359,000 --> 0:17:23,000
then you're probably still not going to be comfortable falling asleep.

332
0:17:27.52,000 --> 0:17:28,000
You shouldn't be, certainly.

333
0:17:29.08,000 --> 0:17:3,000
(Laughter)

334
0:17:32.04,000 --> 0:17:34,000
It's never going to be perfect.

335
0:17:34.96,000 --> 0:17:35,000
No system is going to be perfect,

336
0:17:36.72,000 --> 0:17:37,000
but if you say it's perhaps --

337
0:17:40.52,000 --> 0:17:42,000
the car is unlikely to crash

338
0:17:42.96,000 --> 0:17:45,000
in a hundred lifetimes, or a thousand lifetimes,

339
0:17:46.44,000 --> 0:17:49,000
then people are like, OK, wow, if I were to live a thousand lives,

340
0:17:50.36,000 --> 0:17:52,000
I would still most likely never experience a crash,

341
0:17:53,000 --> 0:17:54,000
then that's probably OK.

342
0:17:54.4,000 --> 0:17:55,000
CA: To sleep.

343
0:17:55.64,000 --> 0:17:57,000
I guess the big concern of yours is that people may actually

344
0:17:58.52,000 --> 0:18:,000
get seduced too early to think that this is safe,

345
0:18:00.83,000 --> 0:18:04,000
and that you'll have some horrible incident happen that puts things back.

346
0:18:05.4,000 --> 0:18:11,000
EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system is likely to at least mitigate the crash,

347
0:18:11.44,000 --> 0:18:12,000
except in rare circumstances.

348
0:18:14.28,000 --> 0:18:16,000
The thing to appreciate about vehicle safety

349
0:18:16.6,000 --> 0:18:19,000
is this is probabilistic.

350
0:18:20.92,000 --> 0:18:23,000
I mean, there's some chance that any time a human driver gets in a car,

351
0:18:24.4,000 --> 0:18:26,000
that they will have an accident that is their fault.

352
0:18:27.36,000 --> 0:18:28,000
It's never zero.

353
0:18:29.44,000 --> 0:18:33,000
So really the key threshold for autonomy

354
0:18:33.84,000 --> 0:18:37,000
is how much better does autonomy need to be than a person

355
0:18:38.28,000 --> 0:18:39,000
before you can rely on it?

356
0:18:39.68,000 --> 0:18:42,000
CA: But once you get literally safe hands-off driving,

357
0:18:43.12,000 --> 0:18:45,000
the power to disrupt the whole industry seems massive,

358
0:18:45.96,000 --> 0:18:49,000
because at that point you've spoken of people being able to buy a car,

359
0:18:50.36,000 --> 0:18:52,000
drops you off at work, and then you let it go

360
0:18:52.52,000 --> 0:18:55,000
and provide a sort of Uber-like service to other people,

361
0:18:56.52,000 --> 0:18:57,000
earn you money,

362
0:18:57.76,000 --> 0:18:59,000
maybe even cover the cost of your lease of that car,

363
0:19:00.24,000 --> 0:19:01,000
so you can kind of get a car for free.

364
0:19:02.12,000 --> 0:19:03,000
Is that really likely?

365
0:19:03.4,000 --> 0:19:05,000
EM: Yeah. Absolutely this is what will happen.

366
0:19:06.28,000 --> 0:19:07,000
So there will be a shared autonomy fleet

367
0:19:08.28,000 --> 0:19:09,000
where you buy your car

368
0:19:09.56,000 --> 0:19:12,000
and you can choose to use that car exclusively,

369
0:19:13,000 --> 0:19:16,000
you could choose to have it be used only by friends and family,

370
0:19:16.72,000 --> 0:19:21,000
only by other drivers who are rated five star,

371
0:19:21.8,000 --> 0:19:25,000
you can choose to share it sometimes but not other times.

372
0:19:28.12,000 --> 0:19:31,000
That's 100 percent what will occur.

373
0:19:31.44,000 --> 0:19:32,000
It's just a question of when.

374
0:19:33.96,000 --> 0:19:34,000
CA: Wow.

375
0:19:35.2,000 --> 0:19:37,000
So you mentioned the Semi

376
0:19:37.44,000 --> 0:19:39,000
and I think you're planning to announce this in September,

377
0:19:40.2,000 --> 0:19:43,000
but I'm curious whether there's anything you could show us today?

378
0:19:43.32,000 --> 0:19:46,000
EM: I will show you a teaser shot of the truck.

379
0:19:47.2,000 --> 0:19:49,000
(Laughter)

380
0:19:49.72,000 --> 0:19:5,000
It's alive.

381
0:19:51.68,000 --> 0:19:52,000
CA: OK.

382
0:19:52.92,000 --> 0:19:54,000
EM: That's definitely a case where we want to be cautious

383
0:19:55.64,000 --> 0:19:56,000
about the autonomy features.

384
0:19:58.36,000 --> 0:19:59,000
Yeah.

385
0:19:59.6,000 --> 0:20:,000
(Laughter)

386
0:20:01.24,000 --> 0:20:02,000
CA: We can't see that much of it,

387
0:20:02.88,000 --> 0:20:05,000
but it doesn't look like just a little friendly neighborhood truck.

388
0:20:06.12,000 --> 0:20:07,000
It looks kind of badass.

389
0:20:07.4,000 --> 0:20:1,000
What sort of semi is this?

390
0:20:11.16,000 --> 0:20:15,000
EM: So this is a heavy duty, long-range semitruck.

391
0:20:15.76,000 --> 0:20:19,000
So it's the highest weight capability

392
0:20:20.04,000 --> 0:20:23,000
and with long range.

393
0:20:23.12,000 --> 0:20:28,000
So essentially it's meant to alleviate the heavy-duty trucking loads.

394
0:20:29.28,000 --> 0:20:34,000
And this is something which people do not today think is possible.

395
0:20:34.6,000 --> 0:20:37,000
They think the truck doesn't have enough power or it doesn't have enough range,

396
0:20:38.36,000 --> 0:20:4,000
and then with the Tesla Semi

397
0:20:40.92,000 --> 0:20:42,000
we want to show that no, an electric truck

398
0:20:43.6,000 --> 0:20:49,000
actually can out-torque any diesel semi.

399
0:20:49.64,000 --> 0:20:53,000
And if you had a tug-of-war competition,

400
0:20:53.8,000 --> 0:20:58,000
the Tesla Semi will tug the diesel semi uphill.

401
0:20:58.88,000 --> 0:21:,000
(Laughter)

402
0:21:01.16,000 --> 0:21:02,000
(Applause)

403
0:21:03.04,000 --> 0:21:06,000
CA: That's pretty cool. And short term, these aren't driverless.

404
0:21:06.08,000 --> 0:21:09,000
These are going to be trucks that truck drivers want to drive.

405
0:21:10.48,000 --> 0:21:12,000
EM: Yes. So what will be really fun about this

406
0:21:13.12,000 --> 0:21:18,000
is you have a flat torque RPM curve with an electric motor,

407
0:21:18.52,000 --> 0:21:21,000
whereas with a diesel motor or any kind of internal combustion engine car,

408
0:21:22.04,000 --> 0:21:24,000
you've got a torque RPM curve that looks like a hill.

409
0:21:25.84,000 --> 0:21:27,000
So this will be a very spry truck.

410
0:21:28.8,000 --> 0:21:3,000
You can drive this around like a sports car.

411
0:21:31.68,000 --> 0:21:33,000
There's no gears. It's, like, single speed.

412
0:21:34.08,000 --> 0:21:36,000
CA: There's a great movie to be made here somewhere.

413
0:21:36.56,000 --> 0:21:38,000
I don't know what it is and I don't know that it ends well,

414
0:21:39.36,000 --> 0:21:4,000
but it's a great movie.

415
0:21:40.6,000 --> 0:21:41,000
(Laughter)

416
0:21:41.64,000 --> 0:21:43,000
EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving.

417
0:21:44.4,000 --> 0:21:48,000
When I was driving the test prototype for the first truck.

418
0:21:48.44,000 --> 0:21:5,000
It's really weird, because you're driving around

419
0:21:50.72,000 --> 0:21:53,000
and you're just so nimble, and you're in this giant truck.

420
0:21:53.84,000 --> 0:21:56,000
CA: Wait, you've already driven a prototype?

421
0:21:57.36,000 --> 0:21:59,000
EM: Yeah, I drove it around the parking lot,

422
0:21:59.48,000 --> 0:22:,000
and I was like, this is crazy.

423
0:22:00.96,000 --> 0:22:02,000
CA: Wow. This is no vaporware.

424
0:22:03.16,000 --> 0:22:05,000
EM: It's just like, driving this giant truck

425
0:22:05.28,000 --> 0:22:06,000
and making these mad maneuvers.

426
0:22:07.28,000 --> 0:22:09,000
CA: This is cool. OK, from a really badass picture

427
0:22:09.76,000 --> 0:22:11,000
to a kind of less badass picture.

428
0:22:12.4,000 --> 0:22:15,000
This is just a cute house from "Desperate Housewives" or something.

429
0:22:15.76,000 --> 0:22:18,000
What on earth is going on here?

430
0:22:18.84,000 --> 0:22:2,000
EM: Well, this illustrates the picture of the future

431
0:22:21.32,000 --> 0:22:23,000
that I think is how things will evolve.

432
0:22:24.32,000 --> 0:22:26,000
You've got an electric car in the driveway.

433
0:22:26.68,000 --> 0:22:29,000
If you look in between the electric car and the house,

434
0:22:30.44,000 --> 0:22:33,000
there are actually three Powerwalls stacked up against the side of the house,

435
0:22:34.32,000 --> 0:22:36,000
and then that house roof is a solar roof.

436
0:22:37.16,000 --> 0:22:39,000
So that's an actual solar glass roof.

437
0:22:39.28,000 --> 0:22:4,000
CA: OK.

438
0:22:40.52,000 --> 0:22:44,000
EM: That's a picture of a real -- well, admittedly, it's a real fake house.

439
0:22:44.8,000 --> 0:22:45,000
That's a real fake house.

440
0:22:46.48,000 --> 0:22:49,000
(Laughter)

441
0:22:49.6,000 --> 0:22:5,000
CA: So these roof tiles,

442
0:22:51.48,000 --> 0:22:57,000
some of them have in them basically solar power, the ability to --

443
0:22:57.64,000 --> 0:22:58,000
EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles

444
0:22:59.36,000 --> 0:23:04,000
where you can adjust the texture and the color

445
0:23:04.48,000 --> 0:23:05,000
to a very fine-grained level,

446
0:23:06.48,000 --> 0:23:11,000
and then there's sort of microlouvers in the glass,

447
0:23:12.08,000 --> 0:23:15,000
such that when you're looking at the roof from street level

448
0:23:15.56,000 --> 0:23:16,000
or close to street level,

449
0:23:17.28,000 --> 0:23:19,000
all the tiles look the same

450
0:23:19.68,000 --> 0:23:24,000
whether there is a solar cell behind it or not.

451
0:23:26,000 --> 0:23:29,000
So you have an even color

452
0:23:29.44,000 --> 0:23:32,000
from the ground level.

453
0:23:32.96,000 --> 0:23:34,000
If you were to look at it from a helicopter,

454
0:23:35.08,000 --> 0:23:37,000
you would be actually able to look through and see

455
0:23:37.48,000 --> 0:23:41,000
that some of the glass tiles have a solar cell behind them and some do not.

456
0:23:41.52,000 --> 0:23:42,000
You can't tell from street level.

457
0:23:43.16,000 --> 0:23:46,000
CA: You put them in the ones that are likely to see a lot of sun,

458
0:23:46.24,000 --> 0:23:48,000
and that makes these roofs super affordable, right?

459
0:23:48.64,000 --> 0:23:5,000
They're not that much more expensive than just tiling the roof.

460
0:23:51.64,000 --> 0:23:52,000
EM: Yeah.

461
0:23:53.84,000 --> 0:23:55,000
We're very confident that the cost of the roof

462
0:23:57.84,000 --> 0:23:58,000
plus the cost of electricity --

463
0:24:01.92,000 --> 0:24:03,000
A solar glass roof will be less than the cost of a normal roof

464
0:24:04.88,000 --> 0:24:05,000
plus the cost of electricity.

465
0:24:06.32,000 --> 0:24:07,000
So in other words,

466
0:24:07.6,000 --> 0:24:11,000
this will be economically a no-brainer,

467
0:24:11.96,000 --> 0:24:12,000
we think it will look great,

468
0:24:13.68,000 --> 0:24:15,000
and it will last --

469
0:24:15.84,000 --> 0:24:18,000
We thought about having the warranty be infinity,

470
0:24:18.92,000 --> 0:24:19,000
but then people thought,

471
0:24:20.16,000 --> 0:24:22,000
well, that might sound like were just talking rubbish,

472
0:24:22.76,000 --> 0:24:27,000
but actually this is toughened glass.

473
0:24:28.4,000 --> 0:24:3,000
Well after the house has collapsed

474
0:24:31.32,000 --> 0:24:32,000
and there's nothing there,

475
0:24:33.24,000 --> 0:24:36,000
the glass tiles will still be there.

476
0:24:36.8,000 --> 0:24:37,000
(Applause)

477
0:24:38.4,000 --> 0:24:39,000
CA: I mean, this is cool.

478
0:24:40.16,000 --> 0:24:42,000
So you're rolling this out in a couple week's time, I think,

479
0:24:43.04,000 --> 0:24:45,000
with four different roofing types.

480
0:24:45.6,000 --> 0:24:47,000
EM: Yeah, we're starting off with two, two initially,

481
0:24:48.16,000 --> 0:24:51,000
and the second two will be introduced early next year.

482
0:24:51.36,000 --> 0:24:53,000
CA: And what's the scale of ambition here?

483
0:24:53.44,000 --> 0:24:58,000
How many houses do you believe could end up having this type of roofing?

484
0:24:59.76,000 --> 0:25:,000
EM: I think eventually

485
0:25:02.56,000 --> 0:25:05,000
almost all houses will have a solar roof.

486
0:25:07.88,000 --> 0:25:1,000
The thing is to consider the time scale here

487
0:25:11.44,000 --> 0:25:13,000
to be probably on the order

488
0:25:13.92,000 --> 0:25:16,000
of 40 or 50 years.

489
0:25:17.12,000 --> 0:25:21,000
So on average, a roof is replaced every 20 to 25 years.

490
0:25:23.4,000 --> 0:25:26,000
But you don't start replacing all roofs immediately.

491
0:25:26.76,000 --> 0:25:29,000
But eventually, if you say were to fast-forward

492
0:25:30.12,000 --> 0:25:33,000
to say 15 years from now,

493
0:25:33.6,000 --> 0:25:36,000
it will be unusual to have a roof that does not have solar.

494
0:25:37.84,000 --> 0:25:39,000
CA: Is there a mental model thing that people don't get here

495
0:25:40.72,000 --> 0:25:44,000
that because of the shift in the cost, the economics of solar power,

496
0:25:45.16,000 --> 0:25:49,000
most houses actually have enough sunlight on their roof

497
0:25:49.28,000 --> 0:25:51,000
pretty much to power all of their needs.

498
0:25:51.36,000 --> 0:25:52,000
If you could capture the power,

499
0:25:53.28,000 --> 0:25:55,000
it could pretty much power all their needs.

500
0:25:55.36,000 --> 0:25:56,000
You could go off-grid, kind of.

501
0:25:56.92,000 --> 0:25:57,000
EM: It depends on where you are

502
0:25:58.48,000 --> 0:26:01,000
and what the house size is relative to the roof area,

503
0:26:01.76,000 --> 0:26:02,000
but it's a fair statement to say

504
0:26:03.64,000 --> 0:26:07,000
that most houses in the US have enough roof area

505
0:26:08.48,000 --> 0:26:09,000
to power all the needs of the house.

506
0:26:11.8,000 --> 0:26:14,000
CA: So the key to the economics

507
0:26:15,000 --> 0:26:19,000
of the cars, the Semi, of these houses

508
0:26:19.04,000 --> 0:26:22,000
is the falling price of lithium-ion batteries,

509
0:26:22.96,000 --> 0:26:24,000
which you've made a huge bet on as Tesla.

510
0:26:25.48,000 --> 0:26:27,000
In many ways, that's almost the core competency.

511
0:26:27.76,000 --> 0:26:29,000
And you've decided

512
0:26:30.04,000 --> 0:26:35,000
that to really, like, own that competency,

513
0:26:35.28,000 --> 0:26:38,000
you just have to build the world's largest manufacturing plant

514
0:26:38.76,000 --> 0:26:41,000
to double the world's supply of lithium-ion batteries,

515
0:26:41.92,000 --> 0:26:43,000
with this guy. What is this?

516
0:26:44.24,000 --> 0:26:47,000
EM: Yeah, so that's the Gigafactory,

517
0:26:47.72,000 --> 0:26:49,000
progress so far on the Gigafactory.

518
0:26:50.44,000 --> 0:26:51,000
Eventually, you can sort of roughly see

519
0:26:52.36,000 --> 0:26:54,000
that there's sort of a diamond shape overall,

520
0:26:55.32,000 --> 0:26:59,000
and when it's fully done, it'll look like a giant diamond,

521
0:26:59.96,000 --> 0:27:01,000
or that's the idea behind it,

522
0:27:02.2,000 --> 0:27:03,000
and it's aligned on true north.

523
0:27:03.72,000 --> 0:27:04,000
It's a small detail.

524
0:27:05.48,000 --> 0:27:08,000
CA: And capable of producing, eventually,

525
0:27:09.4,000 --> 0:27:12,000
like a hundred gigawatt hours of batteries a year.

526
0:27:12.6,000 --> 0:27:14,000
EM: A hundred gigawatt hours. We think probably more, but yeah.

527
0:27:15.6,000 --> 0:27:17,000
CA: And they're actually being produced right now.

528
0:27:18,000 --> 0:27:21,000
EM: They're in production already. CA: You guys put out this video.

529
0:27:21.2,000 --> 0:27:22,000
I mean, is that speeded up?

530
0:27:22.56,000 --> 0:27:23,000
EM: That's the slowed down version.

531
0:27:24.28,000 --> 0:27:25,000
(Laughter)

532
0:27:26.08,000 --> 0:27:28,000
CA: How fast does it actually go?

533
0:27:28.44,000 --> 0:27:3,000
EM: Well, when it's running at full speed,

534
0:27:31.28,000 --> 0:27:34,000
you can't actually see the cells without a strobe light.

535
0:27:35.24,000 --> 0:27:36,000
It's just blur.

536
0:27:36.54,000 --> 0:27:39,000
(Laughter)

537
0:27:4,000 --> 0:27:43,000
CA: One of your core ideas, Elon, about what makes an exciting future

538
0:27:43.6,000 --> 0:27:45,000
is a future where we no longer feel guilty about energy.

539
0:27:47.48,000 --> 0:27:48,000
Help us picture this.

540
0:27:48.92,000 --> 0:27:53,000
How many Gigafactories, if you like, does it take to get us there?

541
0:27:53.96,000 --> 0:27:54,000
EM: It's about a hundred, roughly.

542
0:27:55.72,000 --> 0:27:56,000
It's not 10, it's not a thousand.

543
0:27:57.48,000 --> 0:27:58,000
Most likely a hundred.

544
0:28:00.04,000 --> 0:28:01,000
CA: See, I find this amazing.

545
0:28:01.72,000 --> 0:28:04,000
You can picture what it would take

546
0:28:05.72,000 --> 0:28:08,000
to move the world off this vast fossil fuel thing.

547
0:28:09,000 --> 0:28:11,000
It's like you're building one,

548
0:28:11.6,000 --> 0:28:13,000
it costs five billion dollars,

549
0:28:14.48,000 --> 0:28:16,000
or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars.

550
0:28:16.64,000 --> 0:28:19,000
Like, it's kind of cool that you can picture that project.

551
0:28:20.28,000 --> 0:28:24,000
And you're planning to do, at Tesla -- announce another two this year.

552
0:28:25.48,000 --> 0:28:27,000
EM: I think we'll announce locations

553
0:28:28.36,000 --> 0:28:31,000
for somewhere between two and four Gigafactories later this year.

554
0:28:32.12,000 --> 0:28:33,000
Yeah, probably four.

555
0:28:34.04,000 --> 0:28:35,000
CA: Whoa.

556
0:28:35.68,000 --> 0:28:37,000
(Applause)

557
0:28:38.32,000 --> 0:28:42,000
No more teasing from you for here?

558
0:28:42.4,000 --> 0:28:44,000
Like -- where, continent?

559
0:28:47.48,000 --> 0:28:48,000
You can say no.

560
0:28:49.44,000 --> 0:28:52,000
EM: We need to address a global market.

561
0:28:53.24,000 --> 0:28:54,000
CA: OK.

562
0:28:54.48,000 --> 0:28:55,000
(Laughter)

563
0:28:55.84,000 --> 0:28:56,000
This is cool.

564
0:28:59.48,000 --> 0:29:03,000
I think we should talk for --

565
0:29:04.56,000 --> 0:29:05,000
Actually, global market.

566
0:29:06.2,000 --> 0:29:1,000
I'm going to ask you one question about politics, only one.

567
0:29:10.32,000 --> 0:29:13,000
I'm kind of sick of politics, but I do want to ask you this.

568
0:29:13.6,000 --> 0:29:19,000
You're on a body now giving advice to a guy --

569
0:29:19.96,000 --> 0:29:2,000
EM: Who?

570
0:29:21.2,000 --> 0:29:23,000
CA: Who has said he doesn't really believe in climate change,

571
0:29:24.12,000 --> 0:29:28,000
and there's a lot of people out there who think you shouldn't be doing that.

572
0:29:28.48,000 --> 0:29:29,000
They'd like you to walk away from that.

573
0:29:30.4,000 --> 0:29:31,000
What would you say to them?

574
0:29:32.72,000 --> 0:29:35,000
EM: Well, I think that first of all,

575
0:29:36.36,000 --> 0:29:38,000
I'm just on two advisory councils

576
0:29:38.92,000 --> 0:29:4,000
where the format consists of going around the room

577
0:29:41.76,000 --> 0:29:43,000
and asking people's opinion on things,

578
0:29:44.68,000 --> 0:29:47,000
and so there's like a meeting every month or two.

579
0:29:49.56,000 --> 0:29:52,000
That's the sum total of my contribution.

580
0:29:52.8,000 --> 0:29:54,000
But I think to the degree that there are people in the room

581
0:29:55.6,000 --> 0:29:59,000
who are arguing in favor of doing something about climate change,

582
0:30:00.36,000 --> 0:30:04,000
or social issues,

583
0:30:06.52,000 --> 0:30:09,000
I've used the meetings I've had thus far

584
0:30:09.76,000 --> 0:30:13,000
to argue in favor of immigration and in favor of climate change.

585
0:30:14.64,000 --> 0:30:15,000
(Applause)

586
0:30:16.6,000 --> 0:30:18,000
And if I hadn't done that,

587
0:30:18.72,000 --> 0:30:2,000
that wasn't on the agenda before.

588
0:30:21.56,000 --> 0:30:25,000
So maybe nothing will happen, but at least the words were said.

589
0:30:26.68,000 --> 0:30:27,000
CA: OK.

590
0:30:27.92,000 --> 0:30:29,000
(Applause)

591
0:30:31.8,000 --> 0:30:34,000
So let's talk SpaceX and Mars.

592
0:30:35.36,000 --> 0:30:36,000
Last time you were here,

593
0:30:36.84,000 --> 0:30:39,000
you spoke about what seemed like a kind of incredibly ambitious dream

594
0:30:40.56,000 --> 0:30:44,000
to develop rockets that were actually reusable.

595
0:30:44.88,000 --> 0:30:46,000
And you've only gone and done it.

596
0:30:47.04,000 --> 0:30:48,000
EM: Finally. It took a long time.

597
0:30:48.68,000 --> 0:30:5,000
CA: Talk us through this. What are we looking at here?

598
0:30:51.28,000 --> 0:30:53,000
EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters

599
0:30:53.44,000 --> 0:30:57,000
coming back from very high and fast in space.

600
0:30:58.04,000 --> 0:31:01,000
So just delivered the upper stage

601
0:31:01.32,000 --> 0:31:03,000
at high velocity.

602
0:31:03.44,000 --> 0:31:06,000
I think this might have been at sort of Mach 7 or so,

603
0:31:07.32,000 --> 0:31:08,000
delivery of the upper stage.

604
0:31:10.88,000 --> 0:31:12,000
(Applause)

605
0:31:13.84,000 --> 0:31:14,000
CA: So that was a sped-up --

606
0:31:15.36,000 --> 0:31:16,000
EM: That was the slowed down version.

607
0:31:17.2,000 --> 0:31:18,000
(Laughter)

608
0:31:18.56,000 --> 0:31:2,000
CA: I thought that was the sped-up version.

609
0:31:21.08,000 --> 0:31:22,000
But I mean, that's amazing,

610
0:31:22.44,000 --> 0:31:23,000
and several of these failed

611
0:31:23.8,000 --> 0:31:25,000
before you finally figured out how to do it,

612
0:31:26.76,000 --> 0:31:28,000
but now you've done this, what, five or six times?

613
0:31:29.68,000 --> 0:31:31,000
EM: We're at eight or nine.

614
0:31:32,000 --> 0:31:33,000
CA: And for the first time,

615
0:31:33.64,000 --> 0:31:36,000
you've actually reflown one of the rockets that landed.

616
0:31:36.8,000 --> 0:31:38,000
EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster

617
0:31:39.6,000 --> 0:31:41,000
and then prepped it for flight again and flew it again,

618
0:31:42.24,000 --> 0:31:47,000
so it's the first reflight of an orbital booster

619
0:31:47.44,000 --> 0:31:48,000
where that reflight is relevant.

620
0:31:49.44,000 --> 0:31:52,000
So it's important to appreciate that reusability is only relevant

621
0:31:52.64,000 --> 0:31:56,000
if it is rapid and complete.

622
0:31:57.4,000 --> 0:32:,000
So like an aircraft or a car,

623
0:32:00.68,000 --> 0:32:02,000
the reusability is rapid and complete.

624
0:32:03.08,000 --> 0:32:08,000
You do not send your aircraft to Boeing in-between flights.

625
0:32:08.16,000 --> 0:32:12,000
CA: Right. So this is allowing you to dream of this really ambitious idea

626
0:32:13,000 --> 0:32:16,000
of sending many, many, many people to Mars

627
0:32:16.2,000 --> 0:32:18,000
in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess.

628
0:32:18.64,000 --> 0:32:19,000
EM: Yeah.

629
0:32:20.04,000 --> 0:32:23,000
CA: And you've designed this outrageous rocket to do it.

630
0:32:23.48,000 --> 0:32:25,000
Help us understand the scale of this thing.

631
0:32:25.92,000 --> 0:32:29,000
EM: Well, visually you can see that's a person.

632
0:32:32.68,000 --> 0:32:33,000
Yeah, and that's the vehicle.

633
0:32:34.52,000 --> 0:32:35,000
(Laughter)

634
0:32:36.2,000 --> 0:32:37,000
CA: So if that was a skyscraper,

635
0:32:37.96,000 --> 0:32:4,000
that's like, did I read that, a 40-story skyscraper?

636
0:32:41.32,000 --> 0:32:42,000
EM: Probably a little more, yeah.

637
0:32:44.36,000 --> 0:32:48,000
The thrust level of this is really --

638
0:32:50.36,000 --> 0:32:54,000
This configuration is about four times the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket.

639
0:32:56.44,000 --> 0:33:,000
CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest rocket humanity ever created before.

640
0:33:01.32,000 --> 0:33:02,000
EM: Yeah. Yeah.

641
0:33:04.64,000 --> 0:33:05,000
CA: As one does. EM: Yeah.

642
0:33:06.12,000 --> 0:33:08,000
(Laughter)

643
0:33:09.12,000 --> 0:33:14,000
In units of 747, a 747 is only about a quarter of a million pounds of thrust,

644
0:33:15.12,000 --> 0:33:18,000
so for every 10 million pounds of thrust,

645
0:33:18.24,000 --> 0:33:19,000
there's 40 747s.

646
0:33:19.96,000 --> 0:33:25,000
So this would be the thrust equivalent of 120 747s, with all engines blazing.

647
0:33:26.24,000 --> 0:33:3,000
CA: And so even with a machine designed to escape Earth's gravity,

648
0:33:30.48,000 --> 0:33:31,000
I think you told me last time

649
0:33:31.92,000 --> 0:33:34,000
this thing could actually take a fully loaded 747,

650
0:33:35.2,000 --> 0:33:37,000
people, cargo, everything,

651
0:33:37.56,000 --> 0:33:38,000
into orbit.

652
0:33:38.84,000 --> 0:33:43,000
EM: Exactly. This can take a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel,

653
0:33:44,000 --> 0:33:48,000
maximum passengers, maximum cargo on the 747 --

654
0:33:48.52,000 --> 0:33:5,000
this can take it as cargo.

655
0:33:52.08,000 --> 0:33:53,000
CA: So based on this,

656
0:33:53.84,000 --> 0:33:57,000
you presented recently this Interplanetary Transport System

657
0:33:58.68,000 --> 0:34:01,000
which is visualized this way.

658
0:34:02.08,000 --> 0:34:06,000
This is a scene you picture in, what, 30 years time? 20 years time?

659
0:34:06.88,000 --> 0:34:08,000
People walking into this rocket.

660
0:34:09.48,000 --> 0:34:13,000
EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of an eight- to 10-year time frame.

661
0:34:14.08,000 --> 0:34:16,000
Aspirationally, that's our target.

662
0:34:16.48,000 --> 0:34:19,000
Our internal targets are more aggressive, but I think --

663
0:34:19.52,000 --> 0:34:21,000
(Laughter)

664
0:34:23.6,000 --> 0:34:24,000
CA: OK.

665
0:34:24.84,000 --> 0:34:26,000
EM: While vehicle seems quite large

666
0:34:27,000 --> 0:34:29,000
and is large by comparison with other rockets,

667
0:34:29.199,000 --> 0:34:32,000
I think the future spacecraft

668
0:34:33.199,000 --> 0:34:36,000
will make this look like a rowboat.

669
0:34:38.32,000 --> 0:34:42,000
The future spaceships will be truly enormous.

670
0:34:43.04,000 --> 0:34:45,000
CA: Why, Elon?

671
0:34:45.239,000 --> 0:34:49,000
Why do we need to build a city on Mars

672
0:34:49.4,000 --> 0:34:52,000
with a million people on it in your lifetime,

673
0:34:52.48,000 --> 0:34:55,000
which I think is kind of what you've said you'd love to do?

674
0:34:56.48,000 --> 0:34:58,000
EM: I think it's important to have

675
0:35:01.12,000 --> 0:35:03,000
a future that is inspiring and appealing.

676
0:35:03.88,000 --> 0:35:05,000
I just think there have to be reasons

677
0:35:06.679,000 --> 0:35:08,000
that you get up in the morning and you want to live.

678
0:35:09.64,000 --> 0:35:1,000
Like, why do you want to live?

679
0:35:11.12,000 --> 0:35:12,000
What's the point? What inspires you?

680
0:35:12.88,000 --> 0:35:13,000
What do you love about the future?

681
0:35:14.76,000 --> 0:35:15,000
And if we're not out there,

682
0:35:16.28,000 --> 0:35:2,000
if the future does not include being out there among the stars

683
0:35:20.32,000 --> 0:35:21,000
and being a multiplanet species,

684
0:35:22.04,000 --> 0:35:24,000
I find that it's incredibly depressing

685
0:35:24.56,000 --> 0:35:27,000
if that's not the future that we're going to have.

686
0:35:27.92,000 --> 0:35:31,000
(Applause)

687
0:35:32.12,000 --> 0:35:34,000
CA: People want to position this as an either or,

688
0:35:34.48,000 --> 0:35:37,000
that there are so many desperate things happening on the planet now

689
0:35:38.2,000 --> 0:35:41,000
from climate to poverty to, you know, you pick your issue.

690
0:35:42.48,000 --> 0:35:44,000
And this feels like a distraction.

691
0:35:45.04,000 --> 0:35:46,000
You shouldn't be thinking about this.

692
0:35:46.88,000 --> 0:35:48,000
You should be solving what's here and now.

693
0:35:49.08,000 --> 0:35:51,000
And to be fair, you've done a fair old bit to actually do that

694
0:35:52.04,000 --> 0:35:54,000
with your work on sustainable energy.

695
0:35:54.88,000 --> 0:35:56,000
But why not just do that?

696
0:35:59.36,000 --> 0:36:01,000
EM: I think there's --

697
0:36:04.84,000 --> 0:36:08,000
I look at the future from the standpoint of probabilities.

698
0:36:09.28,000 --> 0:36:13,000
It's like a branching stream of probabilities,

699
0:36:13.48,000 --> 0:36:18,000
and there are actions that we can take that affect those probabilities

700
0:36:19.92,000 --> 0:36:22,000
or that accelerate one thing or slow down another thing.

701
0:36:24,000 --> 0:36:28,000
I may introduce something new to the probability stream.

702
0:36:30.84,000 --> 0:36:32,000
Sustainable energy will happen no matter what.

703
0:36:33.04,000 --> 0:36:35,000
If there was no Tesla, if Tesla never existed,

704
0:36:35.56,000 --> 0:36:37,000
it would have to happen out of necessity.

705
0:36:38.44,000 --> 0:36:39,000
It's tautological.

706
0:36:40.04,000 --> 0:36:43,000
If you don't have sustainable energy, it means you have unsustainable energy.

707
0:36:43.72,000 --> 0:36:44,000
Eventually you will run out,

708
0:36:45.36,000 --> 0:36:5,000
and the laws of economics will drive civilization

709
0:36:51.2,000 --> 0:36:52,000
towards sustainable energy,

710
0:36:52.88,000 --> 0:36:53,000
inevitably.

711
0:36:54.12,000 --> 0:36:56,000
The fundamental value of a company like Tesla

712
0:36:57.12,000 --> 0:37:01,000
is the degree to which it accelerates the advent of sustainable energy,

713
0:37:01.56,000 --> 0:37:02,000
faster than it would otherwise occur.

714
0:37:05.12,000 --> 0:37:06,000
So when I think, like,

715
0:37:06.36,000 --> 0:37:08,000
what is the fundamental good of a company like Tesla,

716
0:37:09.12,000 --> 0:37:1,000
I would say, hopefully,

717
0:37:10.84,000 --> 0:37:15,000
if it accelerated that by a decade, potentially more than a decade,

718
0:37:16.48,000 --> 0:37:18,000
that would be quite a good thing to occur.

719
0:37:18.64,000 --> 0:37:19,000
That's what I consider to be

720
0:37:20.28,000 --> 0:37:24,000
the fundamental aspirational good of Tesla.

721
0:37:25.48,000 --> 0:37:31,000
Then there's becoming a multiplanet species and space-faring civilization.

722
0:37:31.84,000 --> 0:37:32,000
This is not inevitable.

723
0:37:33.8,000 --> 0:37:35,000
It's very important to appreciate this is not inevitable.

724
0:37:36.52,000 --> 0:37:39,000
The sustainable energy future I think is largely inevitable,

725
0:37:39.64,000 --> 0:37:43,000
but being a space-faring civilization is definitely not inevitable.

726
0:37:44.4,000 --> 0:37:48,000
If you look at the progress in space,

727
0:37:48.6,000 --> 0:37:5,000
in 1969 you were able to send somebody to the moon.

728
0:37:52.04,000 --> 0:37:53,000
1969.

729
0:37:54.84,000 --> 0:37:56,000
Then we had the Space Shuttle.

730
0:37:57.76,000 --> 0:38:,000
The Space Shuttle could only take people to low Earth orbit.

731
0:38:01.2,000 --> 0:38:02,000
Then the Space Shuttle retired,

732
0:38:02.76,000 --> 0:38:04,000
and the United States could take no one to orbit.

733
0:38:06.32,000 --> 0:38:07,000
So that's the trend.

734
0:38:07.6,000 --> 0:38:09,000
The trend is like down to nothing.

735
0:38:11.56,000 --> 0:38:13,000
People are mistaken when they think

736
0:38:13.96,000 --> 0:38:15,000
that technology just automatically improves.

737
0:38:16.08,000 --> 0:38:17,000
It does not automatically improve.

738
0:38:18,000 --> 0:38:22,000
It only improves if a lot of people work very hard to make it better,

739
0:38:22.68,000 --> 0:38:27,000
and actually it will, I think, by itself degrade, actually.

740
0:38:28.48,000 --> 0:38:3,000
You look at great civilizations like Ancient Egypt,

741
0:38:30.92,000 --> 0:38:31,000
and they were able to make the pyramids,

742
0:38:32.88,000 --> 0:38:33,000
and they forgot how to do that.

743
0:38:34.72,000 --> 0:38:36,000
And then the Romans, they built these incredible aqueducts.

744
0:38:37.56,000 --> 0:38:38,000
They forgot how to do it.

745
0:38:40.72,000 --> 0:38:42,000
CA: Elon, it almost seems, listening to you

746
0:38:42.8,000 --> 0:38:44,000
and looking at the different things you've done,

747
0:38:45.08,000 --> 0:38:47,000
that you've got this unique double motivation on everything

748
0:38:47.88,000 --> 0:38:48,000
that I find so interesting.

749
0:38:51.72,000 --> 0:38:55,000
One is this desire to work for humanity's long-term good.

750
0:38:56.32,000 --> 0:38:58,000
The other is the desire to do something exciting.

751
0:38:58.68,000 --> 0:39:02,000
And often it feels like you feel like you need the one to drive the other.

752
0:39:03.4,000 --> 0:39:06,000
With Tesla, you want to have sustainable energy,

753
0:39:06.52,000 --> 0:39:1,000
so you made these super sexy, exciting cars to do it.

754
0:39:11.08,000 --> 0:39:12,000
Solar energy, we need to get there,

755
0:39:12.8,000 --> 0:39:13,000
so we need to make these beautiful roofs.

756
0:39:14.777,000 --> 0:39:16,000
We haven't even spoken about your newest thing,

757
0:39:17,000 --> 0:39:18,000
which we don't have time to do,

758
0:39:18.56,000 --> 0:39:2,000
but you want to save humanity from bad AI,

759
0:39:20.92,000 --> 0:39:23,000
and so you're going to create this really cool brain-machine interface

760
0:39:24.24,000 --> 0:39:27,000
to give us all infinite memory and telepathy and so forth.

761
0:39:28.12,000 --> 0:39:3,000
And on Mars, it feels like what you're saying is,

762
0:39:30.84,000 --> 0:39:33,000
yeah, we need to save humanity

763
0:39:34.56,000 --> 0:39:35,000
and have a backup plan,

764
0:39:35.96,000 --> 0:39:38,000
but also we need to inspire humanity,

765
0:39:39.24,000 --> 0:39:43,000
and this is a way to inspire.

766
0:39:45.68,000 --> 0:39:48,000
EM: I think the value of beauty and inspiration

767
0:39:49.48,000 --> 0:39:5,000
is very much underrated,

768
0:39:51.48,000 --> 0:39:52,000
no question.

769
0:39:53.08,000 --> 0:39:54,000
But I want to be clear.

770
0:39:54.36,000 --> 0:39:55,000
I'm not trying to be anyone's savior.

771
0:39:56.2,000 --> 0:39:57,000
That is not the --

772
0:39:58.24,000 --> 0:40:01,000
I'm just trying to think about the future

773
0:40:02.04,000 --> 0:40:03,000
and not be sad.

774
0:40:04.4,000 --> 0:40:06,000
(Applause)

775
0:40:06.52,000 --> 0:40:07,000
CA: Beautiful statement.

776
0:40:10.2,000 --> 0:40:11,000
I think everyone here would agree

777
0:40:11.8,000 --> 0:40:12,000
that it is not --

778
0:40:13.8,000 --> 0:40:15,000
None of this is going to happen inevitably.

779
0:40:15.88,000 --> 0:40:18,000
The fact that in your mind, you dream this stuff,

780
0:40:19.56,000 --> 0:40:21,000
you dream stuff that no one else would dare dream,

781
0:40:22.16,000 --> 0:40:24,000
or no one else would be capable of dreaming

782
0:40:24.84,000 --> 0:40:27,000
at the level of complexity that you do.

783
0:40:28.52,000 --> 0:40:31,000
The fact that you do that, Elon Musk, is a really remarkable thing.

784
0:40:31.72,000 --> 0:40:33,000
Thank you for helping us all to dream a bit bigger.

785
0:40:34.44,000 --> 0:40:37,000
EM: But you'll tell me if it ever starts getting genuinely insane, right?

786
0:40:37.96,000 --> 0:40:39,000
(Laughter)

787
0:40:40.48,000 --> 0:40:43,000
CA: Thank you, Elon Musk. That was really, really fantastic.

788
0:40:43.6,000 --> 0:40:44,000
That was really fantastic.

789
0:40:45.04,000 --> 0:40:49,000
(Applause)

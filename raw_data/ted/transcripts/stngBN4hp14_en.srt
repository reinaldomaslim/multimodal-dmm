1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My subject today is learning.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And in that spirit, I want to spring on you all a pop quiz.

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Ready?

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
When does learning begin?

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Now as you ponder that question,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
maybe you're thinking about the first day of preschool

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or kindergarten,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher.

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Or maybe you've called to mind the toddler phase

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
when children are learning how to walk and talk

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and use a fork.

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Maybe you've encountered the Zero-to-Three movement,

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
which asserts that the most important years for learning

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
are the earliest ones.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And so your answer to my question would be:

16
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Learning begins at birth.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Well today I want to present to you

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
an idea that may be surprising

19
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and may even seem implausible,

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
but which is supported by the latest evidence

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
from psychology and biology.

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
happens before we're born,

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
while we're still in the womb.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Now I'm a science reporter.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
I write books and magazine articles.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And I'm also a mother.

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And those two roles came together for me

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
in a book that I wrote called "Origins."

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"Origins" is a report from the front lines

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
of an exciting new field

32
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
called fetal origins.

33
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Fetal origins is a scientific discipline

34
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that emerged just about two decades ago,

35
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and it's based on the theory

36
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that our health and well-being throughout our lives

37
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
is crucially affected

38
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
by the nine months we spend in the womb.

39
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me.

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
I was myself pregnant

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
while I was doing the research for the book.

42
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And one of the most fascinating insights

43
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I took from this work

44
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
is that we're all learning about the world

45
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
even before we enter it.

46
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
When we hold our babies for the first time,

47
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
we might imagine that they're clean slates,

48
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
unmarked by life,

49
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
when in fact, they've already been shaped by us

50
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and by the particular world we live in.

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things

52
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that scientists are discovering

53
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
about what fetuses learn

54
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
while they're still in their mothers' bellies.

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
First of all,

56
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
they learn the sound of their mothers' voices.

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Because sounds from the outside world

58
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
have to travel through the mother's abdominal tissue

59
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus,

60
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
the voices fetuses hear,

61
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
starting around the fourth month of gestation,

62
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
are muted and muffled.

63
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
One researcher says

64
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher

65
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in the old "Peanuts" cartoon.

66
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
But the pregnant woman's own voice

67
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
reverberates through her body,

68
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
reaching the fetus much more readily.

69
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And because the fetus is with her all the time,

70
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
it hears her voice a lot.

71
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Once the baby's born, it recognizes her voice

72
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and it prefers listening to her voice

73
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
over anyone else's.

74
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
How can we know this?

75
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Newborn babies can't do much,

76
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but one thing they're really good at is sucking.

77
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Researchers take advantage of this fact

78
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
by rigging up two rubber nipples,

79
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
so that if a baby sucks on one,

80
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
it hears a recording of its mother's voice

81
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
on a pair of headphones,

82
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and if it sucks on the other nipple,

83
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
it hears a recording of a female stranger's voice.

84
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Babies quickly show their preference

85
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
by choosing the first one.

86
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Scientists also take advantage of the fact

87
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that babies will slow down their sucking

88
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
when something interests them

89
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and resume their fast sucking

90
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
when they get bored.

91
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This is how researchers discovered

92
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that, after women repeatedly read aloud

93
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
a section of Dr. Seuss' "The Cat in the Hat" while they were pregnant,

94
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
their newborn babies recognized that passage

95
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
when they hear it outside the womb.

96
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
My favorite experiment of this kind

97
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
is the one that showed that the babies

98
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
of women who watched a certain soap opera

99
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
every day during pregnancy

100
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
recognized the theme song of that show

101
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
once they were born.

102
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So fetuses are even learning

103
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
about the particular language that's spoken

104
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in the world that they'll be born into.

105
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
A study published last year

106
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
found that from birth, from the moment of birth,

107
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
babies cry in the accent

108
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
of their mother's native language.

109
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
French babies cry on a rising note

110
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
while German babies end on a falling note,

111
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
imitating the melodic contours

112
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
of those languages.

113
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Now why would this kind of fetal learning

114
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
be useful?

115
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
It may have evolved to aid the baby's survival.

116
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
From the moment of birth,

117
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
the baby responds most to the voice

118
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
of the person who is most likely to care for it --

119
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
its mother.

120
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It even makes its cries

121
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
sound like the mother's language,

122
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
which may further endear the baby to the mother,

123
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and which may give the baby a head start

124
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
in the critical task

125
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
of learning how to understand and speak

126
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
its native language.

127
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But it's not just sounds

128
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that fetuses are learning about in utero.

129
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's also tastes and smells.

130
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
By seven months of gestation,

131
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the fetus' taste buds are fully developed,

132
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and its olfactory receptors, which allow it to smell,

133
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
are functioning.

134
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats

135
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
find their way into the amniotic fluid,

136
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
which is continuously swallowed

137
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
by the fetus.

138
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes

139
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
once they're out in the world.

140
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
In one experiment, a group of pregnant women

141
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice

142
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
during their third trimester of pregnancy,

143
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
while another group of pregnant women

144
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
drank only water.

145
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Six months later, the women's infants

146
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice,

147
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it.

148
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women

149
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
ate more carrot-flavored cereal,

150
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and from the looks of it,

151
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
they seemed to enjoy it more.

152
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
A sort of French version of this experiment

153
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
was carried out in Dijon, France

154
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
where researchers found

155
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
that mothers who consumed food and drink

156
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
flavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy

157
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
showed a preference for anise

158
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
on their first day of life,

159
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and again, when they were tested later,

160
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
on their fourth day of life.

161
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy

162
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
showed a reaction that translated roughly as "yuck."

163
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
What this means

164
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers

165
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
about what is safe and good to eat.

166
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Fetuses are also being taught

167
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
about the particular culture that they'll be joining

168
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
through one of culture's most powerful expressions,

169
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
which is food.

170
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
They're being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices

171
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
of their culture's cuisine

172
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
even before birth.

173
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons.

174
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But before I get to that,

175
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I want to address something that you may be wondering about.

176
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
The notion of fetal learning

177
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus --

178
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
like playing Mozart through headphones

179
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
placed on a pregnant belly.

180
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But actually, the nine-month-long process

181
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb

182
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is a lot more visceral and consequential than that.

183
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life --

184
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the air she breathes,

185
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
the food and drink she consumes,

186
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the chemicals she's exposed to,

187
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
even the emotions she feels --

188
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
are shared in some fashion with her fetus.

189
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
They make up a mix of influences

190
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
as individual and idiosyncratic

191
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
as the woman herself.

192
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The fetus incorporates these offerings

193
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
into its own body,

194
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
makes them part of its flesh and blood.

195
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
And often it does something more.

196
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It treats these maternal contributions

197
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
as information,

198
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
as what I like to call biological postcards

199
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
from the world outside.

200
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
So what a fetus is learning about in utero

201
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
is not Mozart's "Magic Flute"

202
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
but answers to questions much more critical to its survival.

203
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Will it be born into a world of abundance

204
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
or scarcity?

205
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Will it be safe and protected,

206
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
or will it face constant dangers and threats?

207
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Will it live a long, fruitful life

208
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
or a short, harried one?

209
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
The pregnant woman's diet and stress level in particular

210
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
provide important clues to prevailing conditions

211
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
like a finger lifted to the wind.

212
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The resulting tuning and tweaking

213
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
of a fetus' brain and other organs

214
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
are part of what give us humans

215
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
our enormous flexibility,

216
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
our ability to thrive

217
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
in a huge variety of environments,

218
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
from the country to the city,

219
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
from the tundra to the desert.

220
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
To conclude, I want to tell you two stories

221
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
about how mothers teach their children about the world

222
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
even before they're born.

223
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
In the autumn of 1944,

224
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
the darkest days of World War II,

225
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
German troops blockaded Western Holland,

226
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
turning away all shipments of food.

227
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The opening of the Nazi's siege

228
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades --

229
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
so cold the water in the canals froze solid.

230
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Soon food became scarce,

231
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
with many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day --

232
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
a quarter of what they consumed before the war.

233
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
As weeks of deprivation stretched into months,

234
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
some resorted to eating tulip bulbs.

235
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
By the beginning of May,

236
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
the nation's carefully rationed food reserve

237
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
was completely exhausted.

238
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The specter of mass starvation loomed.

239
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And then on May 5th, 1945,

240
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the siege came to a sudden end

241
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
when Holland was liberated

242
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
by the Allies.

243
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
The "Hunger Winter," as it came to be known,

244
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
killed some 10,000 people

245
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and weakened thousands more.

246
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But there was another population that was affected --

247
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
the 40,000 fetuses

248
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
in utero during the siege.

249
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy

250
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
were immediately apparent

251
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
in higher rates of stillbirths,

252
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
birth defects, low birth weights

253
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and infant mortality.

254
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But others wouldn't be discovered for many years.

255
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Decades after the "Hunger Winter,"

256
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
researchers documented

257
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege

258
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
have more obesity, more diabetes

259
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and more heart disease in later life

260
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions.

261
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
These individuals' prenatal experience of starvation

262
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
seems to have changed their bodies

263
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
in myriad ways.

264
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
They have higher blood pressure,

265
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
poorer cholesterol profiles

266
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and reduced glucose tolerance --

267
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
a precursor of diabetes.

268
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Why would undernutrition in the womb

269
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
result in disease later?

270
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
One explanation

271
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation.

272
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
When food is scarce,

273
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ, the brain,

274
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and away from other organs

275
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
like the heart and liver.

276
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term,

277
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
but the bill comes due later on in life

278
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
when those other organs, deprived early on,

279
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
become more susceptible to disease.

280
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
But that may not be all that's going on.

281
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
It seems that fetuses are taking cues

282
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
from the intrauterine environment

283
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
and tailoring their physiology accordingly.

284
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
They're preparing themselves

285
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
for the kind of world they will encounter

286
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
on the other side of the womb.

287
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
The fetus adjusts its metabolism

288
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and other physiological processes

289
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
in anticipation of the environment that awaits it.

290
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And the basis of the fetus' prediction

291
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is what its mother eats.

292
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
The meals a pregnant woman consumes

293
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
constitute a kind of story,

294
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
a fairy tale of abundance

295
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
or a grim chronicle of deprivation.

296
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
This story imparts information

297
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
that the fetus uses

298
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
to organize its body and its systems --

299
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
an adaptation to prevailing circumstances

300
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
that facilitates its future survival.

301
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Faced with severely limited resources,

302
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
a smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirements

303
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
will, in fact, have a better chance

304
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
of living to adulthood.

305
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
The real trouble comes

306
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
when pregnant women are, in a sense, unreliable narrators,

307
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
when fetuses are led

308
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to expect a world of scarcity

309
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and are born instead into a world of plenty.

310
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
This is what happened to the children of the Dutch "Hunger Winter."

311
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And their higher rates of obesity,

312
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
diabetes and heart disease

313
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
are the result.

314
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie

315
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories

316
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
of the post-war Western diet.

317
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
The world they had learned about while in utero

318
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
was not the same

319
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
as the world into which they were born.

320
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Here's another story.

321
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
At 8:46 a.m. on September 11th, 2001,

322
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
there were tens of thousands of people

323
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
in the vicinity of the World Trade Center

324
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
in New York --

325
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
commuters spilling off trains,

326
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
waitresses setting tables for the morning rush,

327
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
brokers already working the phones on Wall Street.

328
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
1,700 of these people were pregnant women.

329
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
When the planes struck and the towers collapsed,

330
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
many of these women experienced the same horrors

331
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
inflicted on other survivors of the disaster --

332
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
the overwhelming chaos and confusion,

333
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
the rolling clouds

334
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
of potentially toxic dust and debris,

335
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
the heart-pounding fear for their lives.

336
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
About a year after 9/11,

337
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
researchers examined a group of women

338
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
who were pregnant

339
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack.

340
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
In the babies of those women

341
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
who developed post-traumatic stress syndrome, or PTSD,

342
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
following their ordeal,

343
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
researchers discovered a biological marker

344
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
of susceptibility to PTSD --

345
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
an effect that was most pronounced

346
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe

347
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
in their third trimester.

348
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
In other words,

349
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome

350
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
had passed on a vulnerability to the condition

351
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
to their children while they were still in utero.

352
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
Now consider this:

353
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
post-traumatic stress syndrome

354
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong,

355
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering.

356
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
But there's another way of thinking about PTSD.

357
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
What looks like pathology to us

358
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
may actually be a useful adaptation

359
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
in some circumstances.

360
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
In a particularly dangerous environment,

361
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
the characteristic manifestations of PTSD --

362
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
a hyper-awareness of one's surroundings,

363
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
a quick-trigger response to danger --

364
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
could save someone's life.

365
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive

366
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
is still speculative,

367
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
but I find it rather poignant.

368
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
It would mean that, even before birth,

369
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
mothers are warning their children

370
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
that it's a wild world out there,

371
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
telling them, "Be careful."

372
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Let me be clear.

373
0:16:06.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Fetal origins research is not about blaming women

374
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
for what happens during pregnancy.

375
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
It's about discovering how best to promote

376
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
the health and well-being of the next generation.

377
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
That important effort must include a focus

378
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
on what fetuses learn

379
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
during the nine months they spend in the womb.

380
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Learning is one of life's most essential activities,

381
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and it begins much earlier

382
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
than we ever imagined.

383
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Thank you.

384
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000

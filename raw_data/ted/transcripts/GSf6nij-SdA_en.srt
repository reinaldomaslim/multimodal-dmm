[Viewer discretion is advised]

4
0:00:16.753,000 --> 0:00:19,000
"Ashley Judd, stupid fucking slut.

5
0:00:21.54,000 --> 0:00:23,000
"You can't sue someone for calling them a cunt."

6
0:00:24.74,000 --> 0:00:26,000
"If you can't handle the Internet, fuck off, whore."

7
0:00:28.94,000 --> 0:00:3,000
"I wish Ashley Judd would die a horrible death.

8
0:00:31.54,000 --> 0:00:33,000
She is the absolute worst."

9
0:00:33.94,000 --> 0:00:36,000
"Ashley Judd, you're the reason women shouldn't vote."

10
0:00:37.86,000 --> 0:00:39,000
"'Twisted' is such a bad movie,

11
0:00:40.42,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I don't even want to rape it."

12
0:00:44.34,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"Whatever you do,

13
0:00:45.58,000 --> 0:00:48,000
don't tell Ashley Judd. She'll die alone with a dried out vagina."

14
0:00:50.38,000 --> 0:00:52,000
"If I had to fuck an older woman,

15
0:00:52.78,000 --> 0:00:53,000
oh my God,

16
0:00:54.06,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I would fuck the shit out of Ashley Judd,

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that bitch is hot af.

18
0:00:59.54,000 --> 0:01:01,000
The unforgivable shit I would do to her."

19
0:01:04.3,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Online misogyny is a global gender rights tragedy,

20
0:01:10.98,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and it is imperative that it ends.

21
0:01:13.9,000 --> 0:01:16,000
(Applause)

22
0:01:22.5,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Girls' and women's voices,

23
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and our allies' voices are constrained in ways

24
0:01:28.1,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that are personally, economically,

25
0:01:30.14,000 --> 0:01:32,000
professionally and politically damaging.

26
0:01:32.78,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And when we curb abuse,

27
0:01:35.46,000 --> 0:01:37,000
we will expand freedom.

28
0:01:39.14,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I am a Kentucky basketball fan,

29
0:01:40.86,000 --> 0:01:42,000
so on a fine March day last year,

30
0:01:42.94,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I was doing one of the things I do best:

31
0:01:45.54,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I was cheering for my Wildcats.

32
0:01:47.5,000 --> 0:01:48,000
The daffodils were blooming,

33
0:01:48.9,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but the referees were not blowing the whistle when I was telling them to.

34
0:01:52.38,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Laughter)

35
0:01:53.66,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Funny, they're very friendly to me before the opening tip,

36
0:01:56.42,000 --> 0:01:58,000
but they really ignore me during the game.

37
0:01:58.5,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

38
0:01:59.54,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Three of my players were bleeding, so I did the next best thing ...

39
0:02:03.02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I tweeted.

40
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
[@ArkRazorback dirty play can kiss my team's free throw making a --

41
0:02:07.46,000 --> 0:02:09,000
@KySportsRadio @marchmadness @espn Bloodied 3 players so far.]

42
0:02:10.42,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It is routine for me to be treated in the ways I've already described to you.

43
0:02:14.1,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It happens to me every single day

44
0:02:15.74,000 --> 0:02:17,000
on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook.

45
0:02:18.38,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Since I joined Twitter in 2011,

46
0:02:20.78,000 --> 0:02:24,000
misogyny and misogynists have amply demonstrated

47
0:02:24.82,000 --> 0:02:25,000
they will dog my every step.

48
0:02:26.82,000 --> 0:02:28,000
My spirituality, my faith,

49
0:02:29.22,000 --> 0:02:31,000
being a hillbilly -- I can say that, you can't --

50
0:02:31.53,000 --> 0:02:33,000
all of it is fair game.

51
0:02:34.74,000 --> 0:02:37,000
And I have responded to this with various strategies.

52
0:02:37.9,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I've tried engaging people.

53
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
This one guy was sending me hypersexual, nasty stuff,

54
0:02:43.9,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and there was a girl in his avatar.

55
0:02:46.58,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I wrote him back and said ...

56
0:02:49.54,000 --> 0:02:5,000
"Is that your daughter?

57
0:02:51.82,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I feel a lot of fear that you may think about

58
0:02:54.06,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and talk to women this way."

59
0:02:55.74,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And he surprised me by saying,

60
0:02:57.22,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"You know what? You're right. I apologize."

61
0:02:59.66,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Sometimes people want to be held accountable.

62
0:03:03.18,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This one guy was musing to I don't know who

63
0:03:05.9,000 --> 0:03:07,000
that maybe I was the definition of a cunt.

64
0:03:08.78,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I was married to a Scot for 14 years,

65
0:03:10.62,000 --> 0:03:13,000
so I said, "Cunt means many different things in different countries --

66
0:03:14.22,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:15.46,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but I'm pretty sure you epitomize the global standard of a dick."

68
0:03:18.58,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:19.82,000 --> 0:03:21,000
(Applause)

70
0:03:24.34,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I've tried to rise above it, I've tried to get in the trenches,

71
0:03:27.34,000 --> 0:03:29,000
but mostly I would scroll through these social media platforms

72
0:03:30.3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
with one eye partially closed, trying not to see it,

73
0:03:32.94,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but you can't make a cucumber out of a pickle.

74
0:03:36.1,000 --> 0:03:37,000
What is seen goes in.

75
0:03:37.58,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's traumatic.

76
0:03:39.22,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I was always secretly hoping in some part of me

77
0:03:41.94,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that what was being said to me and about me wasn't ...

78
0:03:46.06,000 --> 0:03:47,000
true.

79
0:03:48.86,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Because even I,

80
0:03:50.98,000 --> 0:03:53,000
an avowed, self-declared feminist,

81
0:03:55.06,000 --> 0:03:57,000
who worships at the altar of Gloria --

82
0:03:57.82,000 --> 0:03:58,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
internalize the patriarchy.

84
0:04:02.82,000 --> 0:04:03,000
This is really critical.

85
0:04:04.38,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Patriarchy is not boys and men.

86
0:04:07.18,000 --> 0:04:09,000
It is a system in which we all participate,

87
0:04:09.94,000 --> 0:04:1,000
including me.

88
0:04:14.3,000 --> 0:04:15,000
On that particular day, for some reason,

89
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
that particular tweet after the basketball game

90
0:04:18.82,000 --> 0:04:2,000
triggered something called a "cyber mob."

91
0:04:21.42,000 --> 0:04:27,000
This vitriolic, global outpouring of the most heinous hate speech:

92
0:04:27.46,000 --> 0:04:28,000
death threats, rape threats.

93
0:04:29.42,000 --> 0:04:3,000
And don't you know,

94
0:04:30.659,000 --> 0:04:32,000
when I was sitting at home alone in my nightgown,

95
0:04:33.02,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I got a phone call, and it was my beloved former husband,

96
0:04:35.74,000 --> 0:04:36,000
and he said on a voice mail,

97
0:04:37.1,000 --> 0:04:38,000
"Loved one ...

98
0:04:39.62,000 --> 0:04:41,000
what is happening to you is not OK."

99
0:04:42.94,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And there was something about him taking a stand for me that night ...

100
0:04:50.46,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that allowed me to take a stand for myself.

101
0:04:52.54,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And I started to write.

102
0:04:54.46,000 --> 0:04:56,000
I started to write about sharing the fact

103
0:04:57.22,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that I'm a survivor of all forms of sexual abuse,

104
0:04:59.58,000 --> 0:05:,000
including three rapes.

105
0:05:01.02,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And the hate speech I get in response to that --

106
0:05:03.3,000 --> 0:05:06,000
these are just some of the comments posted to news outlets.

107
0:05:08.74,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Being told I'm a "snitch" is really fun.

108
0:05:12.82,000 --> 0:05:14,000
[Jay: She enjoyed every second of it!!!!!]

109
0:05:14.9,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Audience: Oh, Lord Jesus.

110
0:05:16.14,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Ashley Judd: Thank you, Jesus. May your grace and mercy shine.

111
0:05:19.98,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So, I wrote this feminist op-ed, it is entitled,

112
0:05:24.3,000 --> 0:05:25,000
"Forget Your Team:

113
0:05:26.1,000 --> 0:05:28,000
It Is Your Online Gender Violence Toward Girls And Women

114
0:05:28.94,000 --> 0:05:3,000
That Can Kiss My Righteous Ass."

115
0:05:31.46,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:33.02,000 --> 0:05:35,000
(Applause)

117
0:05:36.285,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And I did that alone, and I published it alone,

118
0:05:38.5,000 --> 0:05:39,000
because my chief advisor said,

119
0:05:39.98,000 --> 0:05:4,000
"Please don't,

120
0:05:41.22,000 --> 0:05:43,000
the rain of retaliatory garbage that is inevitable --

121
0:05:44.02,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I fear for you."

122
0:05:45.46,000 --> 0:05:47,000
But I trust girls and I trust women,

123
0:05:47.58,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and I trust our allies.

124
0:05:49.18,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It was published, it went viral,

125
0:05:50.86,000 --> 0:05:52,000
it proves that every single day

126
0:05:52.98,000 --> 0:05:55,000
online misogyny is a phenomenon endured by us all,

127
0:05:56.5,000 --> 0:05:57,000
all over the world,

128
0:05:57.74,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and when it is intersectional,

129
0:05:59.5,000 --> 0:06:,000
it is worse.

130
0:06:00.74,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Sexual orientation, gender identity,

131
0:06:02.7,000 --> 0:06:03,000
race, ethnicity, religion --

132
0:06:04.54,000 --> 0:06:05,000
you name it,

133
0:06:05.78,000 --> 0:06:07,000
it amplifies the violence endured by girls and women,

134
0:06:08.34,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and for our younger girls, it is worse.

135
0:06:12.9,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's clearly traumatizing.

136
0:06:14.66,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Our mental health, our emotional well-being

137
0:06:17.86,000 --> 0:06:18,000
are so gravely affected

138
0:06:19.34,000 --> 0:06:2,000
because the threat of violence

139
0:06:20.82,000 --> 0:06:24,000
is experienced neurobiologically as violence.

140
0:06:25.06,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The cortisol shoots up, the limbic system gets fired,

141
0:06:28.14,000 --> 0:06:3,000
we lose productivity at work.

142
0:06:31.74,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And let's talk about work.

143
0:06:33.5,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Our ability to work is constrained.

144
0:06:37.02,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Online searches of women applying for jobs reveal nude pictures of them,

145
0:06:41.74,000 --> 0:06:43,000
false allegations they have STDs,

146
0:06:44.58,000 --> 0:06:49,000
their addresses indicating that they are available for sex

147
0:06:49.82,000 --> 0:06:5,000
with real examples

148
0:06:51.38,000 --> 0:06:54,000
of people showing up at this house for said sex.

149
0:06:55.9,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Our ability to go to school is impaired.

150
0:07:00.94,000 --> 0:07:02,000
96 percent of all postings

151
0:07:03.38,000 --> 0:07:06,000
of sexual images of our young people ...

152
0:07:07.38,000 --> 0:07:08,000
girls.

153
0:07:08.86,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Our girls.

154
0:07:10.5,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Our boys are two to three times more likely --

155
0:07:14.38,000 --> 0:07:15,000
nonconsensually --

156
0:07:16.38,000 --> 0:07:17,000
to share images.

157
0:07:19.42,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And I want to say a word about revenge porn.

158
0:07:22.22,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Part of what came out of this tweet

159
0:07:24.5,000 --> 0:07:26,000
was my getting connected with allies and other activists

160
0:07:27.34,000 --> 0:07:29,000
who are fighting for a safe and free internet.

161
0:07:30.7,000 --> 0:07:32,000
We started something called the Speech Project;

162
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
curbing abuse, expanding freedom.

163
0:07:35.78,000 --> 0:07:37,000
And that website provides a critical forum,

164
0:07:39.1,000 --> 0:07:42,000
because there is no global, legal thing

165
0:07:43.66,000 --> 0:07:44,000
to help us figure this out.

166
0:07:45.18,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But we do provide on that website a standardized list of definitions,

167
0:07:48.82,000 --> 0:07:51,000
because it's hard to attack a behavior in the right way

168
0:07:51.94,000 --> 0:07:54,000
if we're not all sharing a definition of what that behavior is.

169
0:07:55.38,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And I learned that revenge porn is often dangerously misapplied.

170
0:08:00.18,000 --> 0:08:02,000
It is the nonconsensual sharing of an image

171
0:08:03.5,000 --> 0:08:07,000
used tactically to shame and humiliate a girl or woman

172
0:08:07.98,000 --> 0:08:09,000
that attempts to pornography us.

173
0:08:10.62,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Our natural sexuality is --

174
0:08:14.5,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I don't know about yours -- pretty gorgeous and wonderful.

175
0:08:18.9,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And my expressing it does not pornography make.

176
0:08:22.18,000 --> 0:08:23,000
(Applause)

177
0:08:28.06,000 --> 0:08:29,000
So, I have all these resources

178
0:08:29.54,000 --> 0:08:32,000
that I'm keenly aware so many people in the world do not.

179
0:08:33.5,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I was able to start the Speech Project with colleagues.

180
0:08:37.14,000 --> 0:08:39,000
I can often get a social media company's attention.

181
0:08:39.66,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I have a wonderful visit to Facebook HQ coming up.

182
0:08:45.54,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Hasn't helped the idiotic reporting standards yet ...

183
0:08:50.7,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I actually pay someone to scrub my social media feeds,

184
0:08:56.62,000 --> 0:08:58,000
attempting to spare my brain

185
0:08:58.78,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the daily iterations of the trauma of hate speech.

186
0:09:03.02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And guess what?

187
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I get hate speech for that.

188
0:09:05.66,000 --> 0:09:06,000
"Oh, you live in an echo chamber."

189
0:09:07.304,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Well, guess what?

190
0:09:08.58,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Having someone post a photograph of me with my mouth open

191
0:09:11.3,000 --> 0:09:13,000
saying they "can't wait to cum on my face,"

192
0:09:13.38,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I have a right to set that boundary.

193
0:09:15.66,000 --> 0:09:16,000
(Applause)

194
0:09:21.46,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And this distinction between virtual and real is specious

195
0:09:24.58,000 --> 0:09:25,000
because guess what --

196
0:09:25.82,000 --> 0:09:27,000
that actually happened to me once when I was a child,

197
0:09:28.34,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and so that tweet brought up that trauma,

198
0:09:30.94,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and I had to do work on that.

199
0:09:32.74,000 --> 0:09:35,000
But you know what we do? We take all of this hate speech,

200
0:09:35.94,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and we disaggregate it,

201
0:09:38.66,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and we code it,

202
0:09:40.06,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and we give that data

203
0:09:41.94,000 --> 0:09:43,000
so that we understand the intersectionality of it:

204
0:09:44.66,000 --> 0:09:45,000
when I get porn,

205
0:09:45.94,000 --> 0:09:46,000
when it's about political affiliation,

206
0:09:47.82,000 --> 0:09:49,000
when it's about age, when it's about all of it.

207
0:09:50.86,000 --> 0:09:51,000
We're going to win this fight.

208
0:09:54.58,000 --> 0:09:55,000
There are a lot of solutions --

209
0:09:57.54,000 --> 0:09:58,000
thank goodness.

210
0:09:59.18,000 --> 0:10:01,000
I'm going to offer just a few,

211
0:10:01.34,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and of course I challenge you to create and contribute your own.

212
0:10:07.18,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Number one: we have to start with digital media literacy,

213
0:10:10.46,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and clearly it must have a gendered lens.

214
0:10:14.02,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Kids, schools, caregivers, parents:

215
0:10:16.54,000 --> 0:10:17,000
it's essential.

216
0:10:18.22,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Two ...

217
0:10:20.46,000 --> 0:10:21,000
shall we talk about our friends in tech?

218
0:10:23.46,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Said with dignity and respect,

219
0:10:26.1,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the sexism in your workplaces must end.

220
0:10:31.1,000 --> 0:10:33,000
(Applause)

221
0:10:33.58,000 --> 0:10:34,000
(Cheers)

222
0:10:35.58,000 --> 0:10:36,000
EDGE,

223
0:10:36.82,000 --> 0:10:38,000
the global standard for gender equality,

224
0:10:39.7,000 --> 0:10:4,000
is the minimum standard.

225
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
And guess what, Silicon Valley?

226
0:10:43.5,000 --> 0:10:44,000
If L'Oréal in India,

227
0:10:45.5,000 --> 0:10:47,000
in the Philippines, in Brazil

228
0:10:47.7,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and in Russia can do it,

229
0:10:49.62,000 --> 0:10:51,000
you can, too.

230
0:10:52.34,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Enough excuses.

231
0:10:55.02,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Only when women have critical mass in every department at your companies,

232
0:10:58.82,000 --> 0:11:,000
including building platforms from the ground up,

233
0:11:01.66,000 --> 0:11:05,000
will the conversations about priorities and solutions change.

234
0:11:06.02,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And more love for my friends in tech:

235
0:11:08.1,000 --> 0:11:11,000
profiteering off misogyny in video games must end.

236
0:11:12.62,000 --> 0:11:15,000
I'm so tired of hearing you talk to me at cocktail parties --

237
0:11:16.1,000 --> 0:11:18,000
like you did a couple weeks ago in Aspen --

238
0:11:18.46,000 --> 0:11:2,000
about how deplorable #Gamergate was,

239
0:11:21.42,000 --> 0:11:23,000
when you're still making billions of dollars off games

240
0:11:24.06,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that maim and dump women for sport.

241
0:11:27.3,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Basta! -- as the Italians would say.

242
0:11:29.86,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Enough.

243
0:11:31.14,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Applause)

244
0:11:35.06,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Our friends in law enforcement have much to do,

245
0:11:38.58,000 --> 0:11:39,000
because we've seen

246
0:11:40.22,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that online violence is an extension of in-person violence.

247
0:11:46.06,000 --> 0:11:47,000
In our country,

248
0:11:47.82,000 --> 0:11:51,000
more girls and women have been murdered by their intimate partners

249
0:11:52.62,000 --> 0:11:53,000
than died on 9/11

250
0:11:54.42,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and have died since in Afghanistan and Iraq combined.

251
0:11:59.06,000 --> 0:12:01,000
And it's not cool to say that,

252
0:12:01.18,000 --> 0:12:02,000
but it is true.

253
0:12:03.18,000 --> 0:12:06,000
We care so much geopolitically about what men are doing over there

254
0:12:07.1,000 --> 0:12:08,000
to women over there ...

255
0:12:09.3,000 --> 0:12:1,000
In 2015,

256
0:12:11.66,000 --> 0:12:17,000
72,828 women used intimate partner violence services in this country.

257
0:12:17.94,000 --> 0:12:2,000
That is not counting the girls and women and boys who needed them.

258
0:12:22.98,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Law enforcement must be empowered

259
0:12:26.1,000 --> 0:12:28,000
with up-to-date internet technology,

260
0:12:28.34,000 --> 0:12:31,000
the devices and an understanding of these platforms --

261
0:12:31.58,000 --> 0:12:32,000
how they work.

262
0:12:33.3,000 --> 0:12:35,000
The police wanted to be helpful when Amanda Hess called

263
0:12:36.06,000 --> 0:12:38,000
about the death threat she was getting on Twitter,

264
0:12:38.62,000 --> 0:12:4,000
but they couldn't really when they said,

265
0:12:40.78,000 --> 0:12:41,000
"What's Twitter?"

266
0:12:44.46,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Our legislators must write and pass astute legislation

267
0:12:48.38,000 --> 0:12:49,000
that reflects today's technology

268
0:12:50.3,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and our notions of free and hate speech.

269
0:12:54.1,000 --> 0:12:58,000
In New York recently, the law could not be applied to a perpetrator

270
0:12:58.66,000 --> 0:13:,000
because the crimes must have been committed --

271
0:13:00.86,000 --> 0:13:01,000
even if it was anonymous --

272
0:13:02.22,000 --> 0:13:06,000
they must have been committed by telephone, in mail,

273
0:13:06.7,000 --> 0:13:07,000
by telegraph --

274
0:13:08.14,000 --> 0:13:09,000
(Laughter)

275
0:13:12.82,000 --> 0:13:14,000
The language must be technologically neutral.

276
0:13:17.18,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So apparently,

277
0:13:19.02,000 --> 0:13:2,000
I've got a pretty bold voice.

278
0:13:21.34,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So, let's talk about our friends ...

279
0:13:23.9,000 --> 0:13:24,000
white men.

280
0:13:26.98,000 --> 0:13:28,000
You have a role to play and a choice to make.

281
0:13:30.46,000 --> 0:13:32,000
You can do something,

282
0:13:32.62,000 --> 0:13:33,000
or you can do nothing.

283
0:13:36.1,000 --> 0:13:37,000
We're cool in this room,

284
0:13:37.38,000 --> 0:13:39,000
but when this goes out, everyone will say,

285
0:13:39.404,000 --> 0:13:4,000
"Oh my God, she's a reverse racist."

286
0:13:42.34,000 --> 0:13:45,000
That quote was said by a white man, Robert Moritz,

287
0:13:45.94,000 --> 0:13:47,000
chairperson, PricewaterhouseCoopers,

288
0:13:48.38,000 --> 0:13:5,000
he asked me to include it in my talk.

289
0:13:52.78,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We need to grow support lines and help groups,

290
0:13:56.3,000 --> 0:13:57,000
so victims can help each other

291
0:13:59.06,000 --> 0:14:01,000
when their lives and finances have been derailed.

292
0:14:01.9,000 --> 0:14:05,000
We must as individuals disrupt gender violence as it is happening.

293
0:14:06.3,000 --> 0:14:07,000
92 percent of young people

294
0:14:08.1,000 --> 0:14:09,000
29 and under witness it.

295
0:14:10.54,000 --> 0:14:12,000
72 percent of us have witnessed it.

296
0:14:13.9,000 --> 0:14:14,000
We must have the courage and urgency

297
0:14:15.66,000 --> 0:14:17,000
to practice stopping it as it is unfolding.

298
0:14:20.06,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And lastly,

299
0:14:22.54,000 --> 0:14:23,000
believe her.

300
0:14:25.42,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Believe her.

301
0:14:26.66,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Applause)

302
0:14:33.54,000 --> 0:14:36,000
This is fundamentally a problem of human interaction.

303
0:14:38.38,000 --> 0:14:42,000
And as I believe that human interaction is at the core of our healing,

304
0:14:42.54,000 --> 0:14:46,000
trauma not transformed will be trauma transferred.

305
0:14:47.42,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Edith Wharton said, "The end is latent in the beginning,"

306
0:14:50.54,000 --> 0:14:54,000
so we are going to end this talk replacing hate speech with love speech.

307
0:14:55.54,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Because I get lonely in this,

308
0:14:57.5,000 --> 0:14:58,000
but I know that we are allies.

309
0:15:00.46,000 --> 0:15:01,000
I recently learned

310
0:15:02.14,000 --> 0:15:06,000
about how gratitude and affirmations offset negative interactions.

311
0:15:06.78,000 --> 0:15:09,000
It takes five of those to offset one negative interaction,

312
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
and gratitude in particular --

313
0:15:11.74,000 --> 0:15:13,000
free, available globally any time, anywhere,

314
0:15:14.46,000 --> 0:15:16,000
to anyone in any dialect --

315
0:15:16.58,000 --> 0:15:19,000
it fires the pregenual anterior cingulate,

316
0:15:19.82,000 --> 0:15:2,000
a watershed part of the brain

317
0:15:21.66,000 --> 0:15:23,000
that floods it with great, good stuff.

318
0:15:24.3,000 --> 0:15:26,000
So I'm going to say awesome stuff about myself.

319
0:15:26.94,000 --> 0:15:28,000
I would like for you to reflect it back to me.

320
0:15:29.3,000 --> 0:15:31,000
It might sound something like this --

321
0:15:31.46,000 --> 0:15:32,000
(Laughter)

322
0:15:32.94,000 --> 0:15:36,000
I am a powerful and strong woman, and you would say, "Yes, you are."

323
0:15:36.98,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Audience: Yes, you are.

324
0:15:38.66,000 --> 0:15:39,000
Ashley Judd: My mama loves me.

325
0:15:40.42,000 --> 0:15:41,000
A: Yes, she does.

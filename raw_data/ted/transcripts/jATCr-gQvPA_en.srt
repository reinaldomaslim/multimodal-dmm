1
0:00:12.77,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I look in the mirror today,

2
0:00:14.675,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I see a justice and education scholar at Columbia University,

3
0:00:20.023,000 --> 0:00:23,000
a youth mentor, an activist

4
0:00:23.673,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and a future New York state senator.

5
0:00:25.696,000 --> 0:00:27,000
(Cheering)

6
0:00:28.3,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I see all of that

7
0:00:30.403,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and a man who spent a quarter of his life in state prison --

8
0:00:35.736,000 --> 0:00:36,000
six years, to be exact,

9
0:00:37.759,000 --> 0:00:39,000
starting as a teenager on Rikers Island

10
0:00:40.53,000 --> 0:00:42,000
for an act that nearly cost a man his life.

11
0:00:44.552,000 --> 0:00:46,000
But what got me from there to here

12
0:00:47.751,000 --> 0:00:5,000
wasn't the punishment I faced as a teenager in adult prison

13
0:00:51.473,000 --> 0:00:52,000
or the harshness of our legal system.

14
0:00:54.402,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Instead, it was a learning environment of a classroom

15
0:00:58.294,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that introduced me to something I didn't think was possible for me

16
0:01:02.403,000 --> 0:01:03,000
or our justice system as a whole.

17
0:01:05.506,000 --> 0:01:07,000
A few weeks before my release on parole,

18
0:01:07.946,000 --> 0:01:09,000
a counselor encouraged me to enroll in a new college course

19
0:01:10.804,000 --> 0:01:11,000
being offered in the prison.

20
0:01:12.881,000 --> 0:01:13,000
It was called Inside Criminal Justice.

21
0:01:14.78,000 --> 0:01:16,000
That seems pretty straightforward, though, right?

22
0:01:17.269,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Well, it turns out,

23
0:01:18.45,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the class would be made up of eight incarcerated men

24
0:01:21.387,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and eight assistant district attorneys.

25
0:01:25.013,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Columbia University psychology professor Geraldine Downey

26
0:01:28.276,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and Manhattan Assistant DA Lucy Lang

27
0:01:30.331,000 --> 0:01:31,000
co-taught the course,

28
0:01:31.577,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and it was the first of its kind.

29
0:01:34.067,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I can honestly say

30
0:01:36.186,000 --> 0:01:38,000
this wasn't how I imagined starting college.

31
0:01:39.345,000 --> 0:01:4,000
My mind was blown from day one.

32
0:01:41.282,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I assumed all the prosecutors in the room would be white.

33
0:01:44.831,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But I remember walking into the room on the first day of class

34
0:01:48.117,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and seeing three black prosecutors

35
0:01:50.006,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and thinking to myself,

36
0:01:51.331,000 --> 0:01:54,000
"Wow, being a black prosecutor --

37
0:01:54.5,000 --> 0:01:55,000
that's a thing!"

38
0:01:56.196,000 --> 0:01:58,000
(Laughter)

39
0:02:00.204,000 --> 0:02:01,000
By the end of the first session,

40
0:02:01.919,000 --> 0:02:02,000
I was all in.

41
0:02:03.123,000 --> 0:02:06,000
In fact, a few weeks after my release,

42
0:02:06.394,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I found myself doing something I prayed I wouldn't.

43
0:02:10.807,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I walked right back into prison.

44
0:02:13.126,000 --> 0:02:15,000
But thankfully, this time it was just as a student,

45
0:02:17.057,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to join my fellow classmates.

46
0:02:20.326,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And this time,

47
0:02:22.212,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I got to go home when class was over.

48
0:02:26.061,000 --> 0:02:29,000
In the next session, we talked about what had brought each of us

49
0:02:29.148,000 --> 0:02:3,000
to this point of our lives

50
0:02:30.447,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and into the classroom together.

51
0:02:32.046,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I eventually got comfortable enough

52
0:02:33.758,000 --> 0:02:35,000
to reveal my truth to everyone in the room

53
0:02:35.949,000 --> 0:02:36,000
about where I came from.

54
0:02:38.109,000 --> 0:02:43,000
I talked about how my sisters and I watched our mother suffer years of abuse

55
0:02:44.691,000 --> 0:02:45,000
at the hands of our stepfather,

56
0:02:47.212,000 --> 0:02:5,000
escaping, only to find ourselves living in a shelter.

57
0:02:52.134,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I talked about how I swore an oath to my family

58
0:02:55.292,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to keep them safe.

59
0:02:58.062,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I even explained how I didn't feel like a teenager at 13,

60
0:03:01.41,000 --> 0:03:03,000
but more like a soldier on a mission.

61
0:03:04.275,000 --> 0:03:05,000
And like any soldier,

62
0:03:05.632,000 --> 0:03:08,000
this meant carrying an emotional burden on my shoulders,

63
0:03:10.164,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and I hate to say it,

64
0:03:12.498,000 --> 0:03:13,000
but a gun on my waist.

65
0:03:15.41,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And just a few days after my 17th birthday,

66
0:03:17.864,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that mission completely failed.

67
0:03:19.924,000 --> 0:03:21,000
As my sister and I were walking to the laundromat,

68
0:03:22.298,000 --> 0:03:23,000
a crowd stopped in front of us.

69
0:03:24.639,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Two girls out of nowhere attacked my sister.

70
0:03:27.282,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Still confused about what was happening, I tried to pull one girl away,

71
0:03:30.979,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and just as I did, I felt something brush across my face.

72
0:03:34.911,000 --> 0:03:35,000
With my adrenaline rushing,

73
0:03:36.736,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I didn't realize a man had leaped out of the crowd and cut me.

74
0:03:40.697,000 --> 0:03:42,000
As I felt warm blood ooze down my face,

75
0:03:44.459,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and watching him raise his knife toward me again,

76
0:03:47.975,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I turned to defend myself and pulled that gun from my waistband

77
0:03:53.442,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and squeezed the trigger.

78
0:03:57.68,000 --> 0:04:,000
Thankfully, he didn't lose his life that day.

79
0:04:02.831,000 --> 0:04:05,000
My hands shaking and heart racing, I was paralyzed in fear.

80
0:04:06.975,000 --> 0:04:07,000
From that moment,

81
0:04:09.307,000 --> 0:04:11,000
I felt regret that would never leave me.

82
0:04:13.531,000 --> 0:04:17,000
I learned later on they attacked my sister in a case of mistaken identity,

83
0:04:18.149,000 --> 0:04:19,000
thinking she was someone else.

84
0:04:20.434,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It was terrifying,

85
0:04:21.776,000 --> 0:04:25,000
but clear that I wasn't trained, nor was I qualified,

86
0:04:25.99,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to be the soldier that I thought I needed to be.

87
0:04:29.776,000 --> 0:04:3,000
But in my neighborhood,

88
0:04:32.322,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I only felt safe carrying a weapon.

89
0:04:36.03,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now, back in the classroom, after hearing my story,

90
0:04:39.569,000 --> 0:04:41,000
the prosecutors could tell I never wanted to hurt anyone.

91
0:04:42.919,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I just wanted us to make it home.

92
0:04:46.145,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I could literally see the gradual change in each of their faces

93
0:04:50.549,000 --> 0:04:52,000
as they heard story after story

94
0:04:52.922,000 --> 0:04:54,000
from the other incarcerated men in the room.

95
0:04:55.752,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Stories that have trapped many of us

96
0:04:57.53,000 --> 0:04:59,000
within the vicious cycle of incarceration,

97
0:04:59.942,000 --> 0:05:02,000
that most haven't been able to break free of.

98
0:05:04.077,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And sure -- there are people who commit terrible crimes.

99
0:05:09.744,000 --> 0:05:12,000
But the stories of these individuals' lives

100
0:05:13.244,000 --> 0:05:14,000
before they commit those acts

101
0:05:15.006,000 --> 0:05:18,000
were the kinds of stories these prosecutors had never heard.

102
0:05:19.736,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And when it was their turn to speak -- the prosecutors --

103
0:05:22.459,000 --> 0:05:23,000
I was surprised, too.

104
0:05:24.275,000 --> 0:05:26,000
They weren't emotionless drones or robocops,

105
0:05:27.117,000 --> 0:05:29,000
preprogrammed to send people to prison.

106
0:05:29.78,000 --> 0:05:31,000
They were sons and daughters,

107
0:05:32.891,000 --> 0:05:33,000
brothers and sisters.

108
0:05:36.066,000 --> 0:05:38,000
But most of all, they were good students.

109
0:05:38.915,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They were ambitious and motivated.

110
0:05:42.22,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And they believed that they could use the power of law to protect people.

111
0:05:47.069,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They were on a mission that I could definitely understand.

112
0:05:52.053,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Midway through the course, Nick, a fellow incarcerated student,

113
0:05:56.585,000 --> 0:05:57,000
poured out his concern

114
0:05:57.784,000 --> 0:06:,000
that the prosecutors were tiptoeing around the racial bias and discrimination

115
0:06:01.471,000 --> 0:06:02,000
within our criminal justice system.

116
0:06:03.665,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Now, if you've ever been to prison,

117
0:06:05.387,000 --> 0:06:07,000
you would know it's impossible to talk about justice reform

118
0:06:08.188,000 --> 0:06:09,000
without talking about race.

119
0:06:10.514,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So we silently cheered for Nick

120
0:06:12.3,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and were eager to hear the prosecutors' response.

121
0:06:14.688,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And no, I don't remember who spoke first,

122
0:06:16.919,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but when Chauncey Parker, a senior prosecutor, agreed with Nick

123
0:06:21.31,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and said he was committed to ending the mass incarceration of people of color,

124
0:06:26.651,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I believed him.

125
0:06:28.626,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And I knew we were headed in the right direction.

126
0:06:32.174,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We now started to move as a team.

127
0:06:35.038,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We started exploring new possibilities

128
0:06:37.666,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and uncovering truths about our justice system

129
0:06:41.762,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and how real change

130
0:06:44.539,000 --> 0:06:45,000
happens for us.

131
0:06:46.657,000 --> 0:06:5,000
For me, it wasn't the mandatory programs inside of the prison.

132
0:06:52.67,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Instead, it was listening to the advice of elders --

133
0:06:56.647,000 --> 0:07:,000
men who have been sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in prison.

134
0:07:03.101,000 --> 0:07:05,000
These men helped me reframe my mindset around manhood.

135
0:07:07.497,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And they instilled in me all of their aspirations and goals,

136
0:07:11.702,000 --> 0:07:13,000
in the hopes that I would never return to prison,

137
0:07:14.823,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and that I would serve as their ambassador to the free world.

138
0:07:19.895,000 --> 0:07:23,000
As I talked, I could see the lights turning on for one prosecutor,

139
0:07:24.775,000 --> 0:07:25,000
who said something I thought was obvious:

140
0:07:27.49,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that I had transformed despite my incarceration

141
0:07:31.517,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and not because of it.

142
0:07:33.787,000 --> 0:07:35,000
It was clear these prosecutors hadn't thought much about

143
0:07:36.501,000 --> 0:07:38,000
what happens to us after they win a conviction.

144
0:07:39.358,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But through the simple process of sitting in a classroom,

145
0:07:42.057,000 --> 0:07:45,000
these lawyers started to see that keeping us locked up

146
0:07:45.128,000 --> 0:07:46,000
didn't benefit our community

147
0:07:48.138,000 --> 0:07:49,000
or us.

148
0:07:51.009,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Toward the end of the course, the prosecutors were excited,

149
0:07:54.488,000 --> 0:07:57,000
as we talked about our plans for life after being released.

150
0:07:58.734,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But they hadn't realized how rough it was actually going to be.

151
0:08:02.963,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I can literally still see the shock

152
0:08:04.71,000 --> 0:08:06,000
on one of the junior ADA's face when it hit her:

153
0:08:07.185,000 --> 0:08:1,000
the temporary ID given to us with our freedom

154
0:08:10.995,000 --> 0:08:12,000
displayed that we were just released from prison.

155
0:08:14.72,000 --> 0:08:16,000
She hadn't imagined how many barriers this would create for us

156
0:08:17.672,000 --> 0:08:18,000
as we reenter society.

157
0:08:20.666,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But I could also see her genuine empathy for the choice we had to make

158
0:08:25.49,000 --> 0:08:27,000
between coming home to a bed in a shelter

159
0:08:29.569,000 --> 0:08:32,000
or a couch in a relative's overcrowded apartment.

160
0:08:36.419,000 --> 0:08:37,000
What we learned in the class

161
0:08:38.109,000 --> 0:08:41,000
worked its way into concrete policy recommendations.

162
0:08:42.411,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We presented our proposals

163
0:08:43.982,000 --> 0:08:45,000
to the state Department of Corrections commissioner

164
0:08:46.799,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and to the Manhattan DA,

165
0:08:48.847,000 --> 0:08:51,000
at our graduation in a packed Columbia auditorium.

166
0:08:53.919,000 --> 0:08:54,000
As a team,

167
0:08:55.839,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I couldn't have imagined a more memorable way

168
0:08:57.998,000 --> 0:08:59,000
to conclude our eight weeks together.

169
0:09:00.617,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And just 10 months after coming home from prison,

170
0:09:03.133,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I again found myself in a strange room,

171
0:09:06.942,000 --> 0:09:1,000
invited by the commissioner of NYPD to share my perspective

172
0:09:11.496,000 --> 0:09:12,000
at a policing summit.

173
0:09:13.649,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And while speaking,

174
0:09:15.625,000 --> 0:09:17,000
I recognized a familiar face in the audience.

175
0:09:19.401,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It was the attorney who prosecuted my case.

176
0:09:25.06,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Seeing him,

177
0:09:27.625,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I thought about our days in the courtroom

178
0:09:32.323,000 --> 0:09:34,000
seven years earlier,

179
0:09:34.356,000 --> 0:09:37,000
as I listened to him recommend a long prison sentence,

180
0:09:38.735,000 --> 0:09:4,000
as if my young life was meaningless

181
0:09:41.932,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and had no potential.

182
0:09:44.592,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But this time,

183
0:09:46.776,000 --> 0:09:47,000
the circumstances were different.

184
0:09:48.91,000 --> 0:09:5,000
I shook off my thoughts

185
0:09:51.077,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and walked over to shake his hand.

186
0:09:54.228,000 --> 0:09:55,000
He looked happy to see me.

187
0:09:56.55,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Surprised, but happy.

188
0:10:01.658,000 --> 0:10:04,000
He acknowledged how proud he was about being in that room with me,

189
0:10:04.848,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and we began a conversation about working together

190
0:10:07.272,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to improve the conditions of our community.

191
0:10:10.005,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And so today,

192
0:10:11.823,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I carry all of these experiences with me,

193
0:10:14.426,000 --> 0:10:18,000
as I develop the Justice Ambassadors Youth Council at Columbia University,

194
0:10:18.783,000 --> 0:10:21,000
bringing young New Yorkers -- some who have already spent time locked up

195
0:10:22.272,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and others who are still enrolled in high school --

196
0:10:24.721,000 --> 0:10:25,000
together with city officials.

197
0:10:26.161,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And in this classroom,

198
0:10:28.251,000 --> 0:10:29,000
everyone will brainstorm ideas

199
0:10:30.101,000 --> 0:10:33,000
about improving the lives of our city's most vulnerable youth

200
0:10:33.259,000 --> 0:10:36,000
before they get tried within the criminal justice system.

201
0:10:38.165,000 --> 0:10:4,000
This is possible if we do the work.

202
0:10:42.188,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Our society and justice system has convinced us

203
0:10:46.792,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that we can lock up our problems

204
0:10:48.434,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and punish our way out of social challenges.

205
0:10:51.561,000 --> 0:10:52,000
But that's not real.

206
0:10:53.522,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Imagine with me for a second

207
0:10:56.187,000 --> 0:10:58,000
a future where no one can become

208
0:10:58.766,000 --> 0:10:59,000
a prosecutor,

209
0:11:00.342,000 --> 0:11:01,000
a judge,

210
0:11:02.193,000 --> 0:11:03,000
a cop

211
0:11:03.903,000 --> 0:11:05,000
or even a parole officer

212
0:11:05.974,000 --> 0:11:07,000
without first sitting in a classroom

213
0:11:08.132,000 --> 0:11:09,000
to learn from and connect with

214
0:11:09.99,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the very people whose lives will be in their hands.

215
0:11:14.038,000 --> 0:11:16,000
I'm doing my part to promote the power of conversations

216
0:11:16.673,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and the need for collaborations.

217
0:11:19.863,000 --> 0:11:2,000
It is through education

218
0:11:21.807,000 --> 0:11:25,000
that we will arrive at a truth that is inclusive and unites us all

219
0:11:25.982,000 --> 0:11:26,000
in the pursuit of justice.

220
0:11:28.95,000 --> 0:11:31,000
For me, it was a brand-new conversation

221
0:11:33.847,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and a new kind of classroom

222
0:11:36.3,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that showed me how both my mindset

223
0:11:39.394,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and our criminal justice system

224
0:11:41.31,000 --> 0:11:42,000
could be transformed.

225
0:11:44.307,000 --> 0:11:48,000
They say the truth shall set you free.

226
0:11:49.712,000 --> 0:11:5,000
But I believe

227
0:11:52.086,000 --> 0:11:53,000
it's education

228
0:11:54.73,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and communication.

229
0:11:56.897,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Thank you.

230
0:11:58.072,000 --> 0:12:02,000
(Applause)

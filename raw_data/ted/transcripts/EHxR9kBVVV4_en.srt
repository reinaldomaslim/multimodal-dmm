1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
For the last 20 years I've been designing puzzles.

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I'm here today to give you

3
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
a little tour, starting from the very first puzzle I designed,

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
through what I'm doing now.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I've designed puzzles for books, printed things.

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'm the puzzle columnist for Discover Magazine.

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I've been doing that for about 10 years.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
I have a monthly puzzle calendar.

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I do toys. The bulk of my work is in computer games.

10
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I did puzzles for "Bejeweled."

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Applause)

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I didn't invent "Bejeweled." I can't take credit for that.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
So, very first puzzle,

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
sixth grade, my teacher said,

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
"Oh, let's see, that guy, he likes to make stuff.

16
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I'll have him cut out letters out of construction paper

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for the board."

18
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
I thought this was a great assignment.

19
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And so here is what I came up with. I start fiddling with it.

20
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I came up with this letter. This is a letter of the alphabet

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
that's been folded just once.

22
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The question is, which letter is it if I unfold it?

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
One hint: It's not "L."

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
It could be an "L," of course.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
So, what else could it be?

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Yeah, a lot of you got it.

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Oh yeah. So, clever thing.

29
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Now, that was my first puzzle. I got hooked.

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I created something new, I was very excited

31
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
because, you know, I'd made crossword puzzles,

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but that's sort of like filling in somebody else's matrix.

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
This was something really original. I got hooked.

34
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I read Martin Gardner's columns in Scientific American.

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Went on, and eventually decided to devote myself, full time, to that.

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now, I should pause and say, what do I mean by puzzle?

37
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
A puzzle is a problem that is fun to solve

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and has a right answer.

39
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
"Fun to solve," as opposed to everyday problems,

40
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
which, frankly, are not very well-designed puzzles.

41
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
You know, they might have a solution.

42
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It might take a long time. Nobody wrote down the rules clearly.

43
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Who designed this?

44
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It's like, you know, life is not a very well-written story

45
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
so we have to hire writers to make movies.

46
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Well, I take everyday problems, and I make puzzles out of them.

47
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And "right answer," of course there might be more than one right answer;

48
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
many puzzles have more than one.

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
But as opposed to a couple other forms of play,

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
toys and games --

51
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
by toy I mean, something you play with that doesn't have a particular goal.

52
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
You can create one out of Legos.

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
You know, you can do anything you want.

54
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Or competitive games like chess where,

55
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
well, you're not trying to solve ... You can make a chess puzzle,

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but the goal really is to beat another player.

57
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I consider that puzzles are an art form.

58
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They're very ancient. It goes back as long as there is written history.

59
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It's a very small form, like a joke,

60
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
a poem, a magic trick or a song, very compact form.

61
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
At worst, they're throwaways, they're for amusement.

62
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But at best they can reach for something more

63
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and create a memorable impression.

64
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
The progression of my career that you'll see

65
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
is looking for creating puzzles that have a memorable impact.

66
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
So, one thing I found early on, when I started doing computer games,

67
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
is that I could create puzzles that will alter your perception.

68
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I'll show you how. Here is a famous one.

69
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
So, it's two profiles in black, or a white vase in the middle.

70
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
This is called a figure-ground illusion.

71
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The artist M.C. Escher exploited that

72
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in some of his wonderful prints.

73
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Here we have "Day and Night."

74
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Here is what I did with figure and ground.

75
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So, here we have "figure" in black.

76
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Here we have "figure" in white.

77
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And it's all part of the same design.

78
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The background to one is the other.

79
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Originally I tried to do the words "figure" and "ground."

80
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But I couldn't do that, I realized. I changed the problem.

81
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It's all "figure."

82
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Laughter)

83
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
A few other things. Here is my name.

84
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And that turns into the title of my first book, "Inversions."

85
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
These sorts of designs now go by the word "ambigram."

86
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I'll show you just a couple others. Here we have

87
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the numbers one through 10, the digits zero through nine, actually.

88
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Each letter here is one of these digits.

89
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Not strictly an ambigram in the conventional sense.

90
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
I like pushing on what an ambigram can mean.

91
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Here's the word "mirror." No, it's not the same upside-down.

92
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
It's the same this way.

93
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And a marvelous fellow from the Media Lab

94
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
who just got appointed head of RISD, is John Maeda.

95
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And so I did this for him. It's sort of a visual canon.

96
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And recently in Magic magazine

98
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I've done a number of ambigrams on magician's names.

99
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
So here we have Penn and Teller, same upside-down.

100
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This appears in my puzzle calendar.

101
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Okay, let's go back to the slides.

102
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Thank you very much.

103
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Now, those are fun to look at.

104
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Now how would you do it interactively?

105
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
For a while I was an interface designer.

106
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And so I think a lot about interaction.

107
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Well, let's first of all simplify the vases illusion,

108
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
make the thing on the right.

109
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, if you could pick up the black vase,

110
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
it would look like the figure on top.

111
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
If you could pick up the white area,

112
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
it would look like the figure on the bottom.

113
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Well, you can't do that physically,

114
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
but on a computer you can do it. Let's switch over to the P.C.

115
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And here it is, figure-ground.

116
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
The goal here is to take the pieces on the left

117
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and make them so they look like the shape on the right.

118
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And this follows the rules I just said:

119
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
any black area that is surrounded by white can be picked up.

120
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
But that is also true of any white area.

121
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So, here we got the white area in the middle,

122
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and you can pick it up.

123
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
I'll just go one step further.

124
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
So, here is --

125
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
here is a couple pieces. Move them together,

126
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and now this is an active piece.

127
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
You can really get inside somebody's perception

128
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and have them experience something.

129
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
It's like the old maxim of

130
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
"you can tell somebody something

131
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and show them, but if they do it they really learn it."

132
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Here is another thing you can do.

133
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
There is a game called Rush Hour.

134
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
This is one of the true masterpieces in puzzle design

135
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
besides Rubik's cube.

136
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So, here we have a crowded parking lot

137
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
with cars all over the place.

138
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The goal is to get the red car out. It's a sliding block puzzle.

139
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
It's made by the company Think Fun.

140
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
It's done very well. I love this puzzle.

141
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Well, let's play one. Here. So, here is a very simple puzzle.

142
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Well, that's too simple, let's add another piece.

143
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Okay, so how would you solve this one?

144
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Well, move the blue one out of the way.

145
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Here, let's make it a little harder. Still pretty easy.

146
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Now we'll make it harder, a little harder.

147
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Now, this one is a little bit trickier.

148
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
You know? What do you do here?

149
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The first move is going to be what?

150
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
You're going to move the blue one up in order to get the lavender one to the right.

151
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And you can make puzzles like this one that aren't solvable at all.

152
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Those four are locked in a pinwheel; you can't get them apart.

153
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I wanted to make a sequel.

154
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I didn't come up with the original idea. But this is another way

155
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I work as an inventor is to create a sequel.

156
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
I came up with this. This is Railroad Rush Hour.

157
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
It's the same basic game except I introduced a new piece,

158
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
a square piece that can move both horizontally and vertically.

159
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
In the other game the cars can only move forward and back.

160
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Created a whole bunch of levels for it.

161
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Now I'm making it available to schools.

162
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And it includes exercises that show you

163
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
not just how to solve these puzzles,

164
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
but how to extract the principles that will let you solve

165
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
mathematical puzzles or problems in science, other areas.

166
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So, I'm really interested in you learning how to make your own puzzles

167
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
as well as just me creating them.

168
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Garry Trudeau calls himself an investigative cartoonist.

169
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
You know, he does a lot of research before he writes a cartoon.

170
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
In Discover Magazine, I'm an investigative puzzle maker.

171
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
I got interested in gene sequencing.

172
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And I said, "Well, how on Earth can you come up with a sequence

173
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
of the base pairs in DNA?"

174
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Cut up the DNA, you sequence individual pieces,

175
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and then you look for overlaps,

176
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and you basically match them at the edges. And I said,

177
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
"This is kind of like a jigsaw puzzle, except the pieces overlap."

178
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
So, here is what I created for Discover Magazine.

179
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And it has to be solvable in a magazine.

180
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
You know, you can't cut out the pieces and move them around.

181
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So, here is the nine pieces. And you're supposed to put them into this grid.

182
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And you have to choose pieces that overlap on the edge.

183
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
There is only one solution. It's not that hard.

184
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
But it takes some persistence.

185
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
And when you're done, it makes this design,

186
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
which, if you squint, is the word "helix."

187
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
So, that's the form of the puzzle coming out of the content,

188
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
rather than the other way around.

189
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Here is a couple more. Here is a physics-based puzzle.

190
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Which way will these fall?

191
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
One of these weighs 50 pounds, 30 pounds and 10 pounds.

192
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And depending on which one weighs which amount,

193
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
they'll fall different directions.

194
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And here is a puzzle based on color mixing.

195
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
I separated this image into cyan, magenta, yellow, black,

196
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
the basic printing colors, and then mixed up the separations,

197
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and you get these peculiar pictures.

198
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Which separations were mixed up to make those pictures?

199
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Gets you thinking about color.

200
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Finally, what I'm doing now. So, ShuffleBrain.com,

201
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
website you can go visit, I joined up with my wife, Amy-Jo Kim.

202
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
She could easily be up here giving a talk about her work.

203
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So, we're making smart games for social media.

204
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
I'll explain what that means. We're looking at three trends.

205
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
This is what's going on in the games industry right now.

206
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
First of all, you know, for a long time

207
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
computer games meant things like "Doom,"

208
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
where you're going around shooting things, very violent games, very fast,

209
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
aimed at teenage boys. Right? That's who plays computer games.

210
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Well, guess what? That's changing.

211
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
"Bejeweled" is a big hit. It was the game that really broke open

212
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
what's called casual games.

213
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And the main players are over 35, and are female.

214
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Then recently "Rock Band" has been a big hit.

215
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And it's a game you play with other people.

216
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It's very physical. It looks nothing like a traditional game.

217
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
This is what's becoming the dominant form of electronic gaming.

218
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Now, within that there is some interesting things happening.

219
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
There is also a trend towards games that are good for you.

220
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Why? Well, we aging Boomers,

221
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Baby Boomers, we're eating our healthy food,

222
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
we're exercising. What about our minds?

223
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Oh no, our parents are getting Alzheimer's. We better do something.

224
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Turns out doing crossword puzzles can stave off some of the effects of Alzheimer's.

225
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
So, we got games like "Brain Age" coming out for the Nintendo DS, huge hit.

226
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
A lot of people do Sudoku. In fact some doctors prescribe it.

227
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
And then there is social media, and what's happening on the Internet.

228
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Everybody now considers themselves a creator,

229
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and not just a viewer.

230
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And what does this add up to?

231
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Here is what we see coming.

232
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It's games that fit into a healthy lifestyle.

233
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
They're part of your life. They're not necessarily a separate thing.

234
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And they are both, something that is good for you, and they're fun.

235
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I'm a puzzle guy. My wife is an expert in social media.

236
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And we decided to combine our skills.

237
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Our first game is called "Photo Grab." The game takes about a minute and 20 seconds.

238
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
This is your first time playing my game. Okay.

239
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Let's see how well we can do. There are three images.

240
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
And we have 24 seconds each.

241
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Where is that?

242
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I'll play as fast as I can.

243
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
But if you can see it, shout out the answer.

244
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
You get more -- Down, okay, yeah where is that?

245
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Oh, yeah. There, okay. J-O and --

246
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I guess that's that part. We got the bow. That bow helps.

247
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
That's his hair. You get a lot of figure-ground problems.

248
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Yeah, that one is easy. Okay. So, ahhh! Okay on to the next one.

249
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Okay, so that's the lens.

250
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Anybody?

251
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Looks like a black shape. So, where is that?

252
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
That's the corner of the whole thing.

253
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Yeah, I've played this image before,

254
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
but even when I make up my own puzzles --

255
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and you can put your own images in here.

256
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
And we have people all over the world doing that now.

257
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
There we are. Visit ShuffleBrain.com

258
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
if you want to try it yourself. Thank you.

259
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.764,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hi everyone.

2
0:00:14.9,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So, I'm going to take us back to 2007.

3
0:00:17.74,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'd just spent about six months working on album

4
0:00:20.02,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that I'd poured my heart and my soul into,

5
0:00:22.1,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and it was getting about three plays per day on Myspace at the time,

6
0:00:25.34,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and I was getting more and more depressed when I started noticing these other people

7
0:00:29.38,000 --> 0:00:3,000
who were playing guitar and singing

8
0:00:31.1,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and putting videos on this new site called YouTube,

9
0:00:33.54,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and they were getting 300,000 views.

10
0:00:35.3,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So I decided I'm going to start making some Youtube videos.

11
0:00:38.42,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And one day they featured a video of my band on the homepage,

12
0:00:41.66,000 --> 0:00:43,000
which was amazing -- we got a bunch of new fans.

13
0:00:43.939,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We also got a bunch of people

14
0:00:45.38,000 --> 0:00:47,000
who, I guess, just didn't really like the music or something --

15
0:00:48.38,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:49.42,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It's OK because people started coming to our shows,

17
0:00:51.86,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and we started touring,

18
0:00:53.14,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and we came out with a record.

19
0:00:54.62,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And when I checked our bank account balance

20
0:00:56.7,000 --> 0:00:57,000
after our first monthly iTunes payout,

21
0:00:58.58,000 --> 0:00:59,000
we had 22,000 bucks in it,

22
0:01:00.1,000 --> 0:01:03,000
which was amazing because at the time I was living at my dad's house,

23
0:01:03.38,000 --> 0:01:06,000
trying to make a living as a musician by uploading videos to the internet

24
0:01:06.86,000 --> 0:01:08,000
which literally zero people respected in 2009 --

25
0:01:09.7,000 --> 0:01:11,000
even the people who were uploading videos to the internet.

26
0:01:12.46,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And so for the next four years,

27
0:01:14.18,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I uploaded more and more videos to the Internet,

28
0:01:17.02,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and they got better and better,

29
0:01:19.58,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and we made enough money through brand deals

30
0:01:22.78,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and commercials and iTunes sales

31
0:01:25.34,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to buy a house.

32
0:01:27.18,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And we built a recording studio.

33
0:01:29.5,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But there was one big problem:

34
0:01:31.18,000 --> 0:01:36,000
making money as a creative person in 2013 was super weird.

35
0:01:36.3,000 --> 0:01:38,000
First of all, the business models were changing all the time.

36
0:01:39.22,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So our 58,000 dollars of annual iTunes download income

37
0:01:43.02,000 --> 0:01:46,000
was about to be replaced by about 6,000 dollars of streaming income.

38
0:01:46.7,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Steams paid less than downloads.

39
0:01:48.62,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And then as more and more creators started popping up online,

40
0:01:51.7,000 --> 0:01:54,000
there was just more competition for these five-figure brand deals

41
0:01:54.82,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that had kept the band afloat for years.

42
0:01:56.98,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And to top it all off, our videos themselves --

43
0:01:59.22,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the creative stuff that we made that our fans loved and appreciated --

44
0:02:03.06,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that were actually contributing value to the world,

45
0:02:05.54,000 --> 0:02:08,000
those videos were generating almost zero dollars of income for us.

46
0:02:08.7,000 --> 0:02:1,000
This is an actual snapshot of my YouTube dashboard

47
0:02:11.1,000 --> 0:02:12,000
from a 28-day period

48
0:02:12.38,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that shows one million views

49
0:02:14.1,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and 166 dollars of ad earnings for those views.

50
0:02:18.66,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The whole machine in 2013

51
0:02:21.019,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that took art online and outputted money

52
0:02:24.54,000 --> 0:02:26,000
was totally nonfunctional.

53
0:02:26.86,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It doesn't matter if you're a newspaper,

54
0:02:29.42,000 --> 0:02:3,000
or an institution,

55
0:02:31.06,000 --> 0:02:32,000
or an independent creator.

56
0:02:32.42,000 --> 0:02:36,000
A monthly web comic with 20,000 monthly readers --

57
0:02:36.74,000 --> 0:02:37,000
20,000 monthly readers --

58
0:02:38.06,000 --> 0:02:4,000
gets paid a couple hundred bucks in ad revenue.

59
0:02:40.42,000 --> 0:02:42,000
This is 20,000 people.

60
0:02:43.9,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Like, in what world is this not enough?

61
0:02:47.14,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I don't understand.

62
0:02:49.1,000 --> 0:02:52,000
What systems have we built where this is insufficient

63
0:02:52.74,000 --> 0:02:53,000
for a person to make a living?

64
0:02:54.78,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So, I actually have a theory about this.

65
0:02:56.74,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I think it's been a weird 100 years.

66
0:02:58.5,000 --> 0:02:59,000
(Laughter)

67
0:02:59.74,000 --> 0:03:01,000
(Applause)

68
0:03:01.82,000 --> 0:03:02,000
About 100 years ago,

69
0:03:03.74,000 --> 0:03:06,000
humans figured out how to record sound onto a wax cylinder.

70
0:03:07.34,000 --> 0:03:08,000
That was the beginning of the phonograph.

71
0:03:09.34,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Right around the same time,

72
0:03:10.7,000 --> 0:03:13,000
we figured out how to record light onto a piece of photographic paper,

73
0:03:14.02,000 --> 0:03:16,000
celluloid -- the beginning of film and television.

74
0:03:16.42,000 --> 0:03:18,000
For the first time, you could store art on a thing,

75
0:03:19.14,000 --> 0:03:2,000
which was amazing.

76
0:03:20.42,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Art used to be completely ephemeral,

77
0:03:22.18,000 --> 0:03:25,000
so if you missed the symphony, you just didn't get to hear the orchestra.

78
0:03:25.66,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But now, for the first time,

79
0:03:27.1,000 --> 0:03:31,000
you could store the orchestra's performance on a physical object,

80
0:03:31.7,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and like, listen to it later,

81
0:03:33.22,000 --> 0:03:34,000
which was amazing.

82
0:03:34.98,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It was so amazing in fact,

83
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
that for the next 100 years, between 1900 and 2000,

84
0:03:39.58,000 --> 0:03:43,000
humans built just billions and billions of dollars of infrastructure

85
0:03:44.1,000 --> 0:03:46,000
to essentially help artists do two things.

86
0:03:46.38,000 --> 0:03:48,000
First, put their art on a thing,

87
0:03:48.46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and second, get that thing around the world

88
0:03:50.7,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to the people who wanted the art.

89
0:03:52.34,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So, so much industry is devoted to these two problems.

90
0:03:55.18,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Oh my gosh, there are trucking companies,

91
0:03:57.157,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and brick-and-mortar and marketing firms, and CD jewel case manufacturers,

92
0:04:01.86,000 --> 0:04:03,000
all devoted to these two problems.

93
0:04:04.66,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And then we all know what happened.

94
0:04:07.02,000 --> 0:04:08,000
10 years ago, the internet matures

95
0:04:08.7,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and we get Spotify and Facebook and YouTube

96
0:04:10.78,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and iTunes and Google search,

97
0:04:12.62,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and a hundred years of infrastructure

98
0:04:15.7,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and supply chains and distribution systems

99
0:04:18.3,000 --> 0:04:19,000
and monetization schemes

100
0:04:20.14,000 --> 0:04:21,000
are completely bypassed --

101
0:04:22.06,000 --> 0:04:23,000
in a decade.

102
0:04:24.22,000 --> 0:04:26,000
After 100 years of designing these things,

103
0:04:27.22,000 --> 0:04:3,000
it's no wonder that it's just totally broken for creative people right now.

104
0:04:31.14,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It's no wonder that the monetization part of the chain doesn't work

105
0:04:34.78,000 --> 0:04:35,000
given this new context.

106
0:04:37.34,000 --> 0:04:41,000
But what gets me super excited to be a creator right now,

107
0:04:42.02,000 --> 0:04:44,000
to be alive today and be a creative person right now,

108
0:04:44.98,000 --> 0:04:5,000
is realizing that we're only 10 years into figuring out this new machine --

109
0:04:51.18,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to figuring out the next 100 years of infrastructure for our creators.

110
0:04:55.22,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And you can tell we're only 10 years in.

111
0:04:57.18,000 --> 0:05:,000
There's a lot of trial and error, some really good ideas forming,

112
0:05:00.3,000 --> 0:05:01,000
a lot of experimentation.

113
0:05:01.58,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We're figuring out what works and what doesn't.

114
0:05:03.82,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Like Twitch streamers. Who's heard of Twitch?

115
0:05:05.98,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Twitch streamers are making three to five thousand bucks a month

116
0:05:09.42,000 --> 0:05:1,000
streaming gaming content.

117
0:05:10.7,000 --> 0:05:13,000
The big ones are making over 100,000 dollars a year.

118
0:05:15.1,000 --> 0:05:16,000
There's a site called YouNow,

119
0:05:16.82,000 --> 0:05:17,000
it's an app.

120
0:05:18.06,000 --> 0:05:22,000
It allows musicians and vloggers to get paid in digital goods from fans.

121
0:05:22.86,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So, I'm also working on the problem.

122
0:05:24.62,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Four years ago I started a company called Patreon

123
0:05:26.98,000 --> 0:05:27,000
with a friend of mine.

124
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
We're 80 people now working on this problem.

125
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It's basically a membership platform

126
0:05:33.54,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that makes it really easy for creators to get paid --

127
0:05:36.78,000 --> 0:05:38,000
every month from their fans to earn a living.

128
0:05:39.02,000 --> 0:05:43,000
For a creator, it's like having a salary for being a creative person.

129
0:05:43.3,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And this is one of our creators.

130
0:05:44.9,000 --> 0:05:45,000
They're called "Kinda Funny."

131
0:05:46.34,000 --> 0:05:49,000
They have about 220,000 subscribers on YouTube.

132
0:05:49.62,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And when they upload a video,

133
0:05:51.06,000 --> 0:05:53,000
it gets somewhere around 15,000 views to 100,000 views.

134
0:05:53.86,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I want you to check yourselves right now.

135
0:05:55.86,000 --> 0:05:58,000
I think when we hear numbers like that, when we hear "15,000 views,"

136
0:05:59.1,000 --> 0:06:,000
and we see content like this,

137
0:06:00.54,000 --> 0:06:03,000
we just snap categorize it as being not as legitimate

138
0:06:03.74,000 --> 0:06:05,000
as a morning show that you'd hear on the radio

139
0:06:06.74,000 --> 0:06:08,000
or a talk show that you'd see on NBC or something

140
0:06:09.14,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But when "Kinda Funny" launched on Patreon,

141
0:06:11.3,000 --> 0:06:15,000
within a few weeks, they were making 31,000 dollars per month

142
0:06:15.58,000 --> 0:06:16,000
for this show.

143
0:06:17.1,000 --> 0:06:2,000
It took off so fast that they decided to expand their programming

144
0:06:20.22,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and add new shows,

145
0:06:21.5,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and now they launched a second Patreon page --

146
0:06:24.18,000 --> 0:06:27,000
they're making an additional 21,000 dollars per month.

147
0:06:28.62,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And they're scaling what's essentially becoming a media company,

148
0:06:33.62,000 --> 0:06:35,000
financing the whole thing through membership.

149
0:06:36.22,000 --> 0:06:37,000
OK, here's another example.

150
0:06:37.98,000 --> 0:06:38,000
This is Derek Bodner,

151
0:06:39.34,000 --> 0:06:41,000
a sports journalist who used to write for Philadelphia Magazine

152
0:06:42.34,000 --> 0:06:45,000
until a few months ago when the magazine cut out all sports coverage.

153
0:06:45.62,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Now he writes articles and publishes them on his own website --

154
0:06:48.62,000 --> 0:06:5,000
he's still covering sports, but for himself.

155
0:06:50.74,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And he's making 4,800 bucks a month from 1,700 patrons,

156
0:06:53.62,000 --> 0:06:54,000
financing it through membership.

157
0:06:55.62,000 --> 0:06:56,000
This is Crash Course --

158
0:06:56.9,000 --> 0:06:58,000
free educational content for the world.

159
0:06:59.46,000 --> 0:07:01,000
This show is actually on the PBS digital network --

160
0:07:01.86,000 --> 0:07:02,000
29,000 dollars per month.

161
0:07:03.22,000 --> 0:07:05,000
This is a duo sailing around the world,

162
0:07:05.46,000 --> 0:07:07,000
getting paid every month for documenting their travels

163
0:07:08.06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
from 1,400 patrons.

164
0:07:09.58,000 --> 0:07:11,000
This is a podcast, "Chapo Trap House", making --

165
0:07:12.14,000 --> 0:07:13,000
actually, since I screenshotted this,

166
0:07:14.02,000 --> 0:07:16,000
they're making an additional 2,000 dollars per month,

167
0:07:16.54,000 --> 0:07:19,000
so they're now making 56,000 dollars per month for their podcast.

168
0:07:21.02,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And Patreon's not the only one working on the problem.

169
0:07:23.62,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Even Google's starting to work on this.

170
0:07:25.54,000 --> 0:07:27,000
A couple years ago, they launched Fan Funding;

171
0:07:27.74,000 --> 0:07:28,000
more recently, they launched Super Chat

172
0:07:29.66,000 --> 0:07:31,000
as a way for creators to monetize live streaming.

173
0:07:32.06,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Newspapers are starting to experiment with membership.

174
0:07:34.66,000 --> 0:07:35,000
New York Times has a membership program;

175
0:07:36.62,000 --> 0:07:38,000
The Guardian has over 200,000 paying subscribers

176
0:07:38.9,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to its membership program.

177
0:07:40.54,000 --> 0:07:44,000
There's this bubbling soup of ideas and experiments

178
0:07:45.14,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and progress right now,

179
0:07:46.66,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and it's pointing in the direction of getting creators paid.

180
0:07:50.14,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And it's working.

181
0:07:51.62,000 --> 0:07:52,000
It's not, like, perfect yet,

182
0:07:53.22,000 --> 0:07:54,000
but it's really working.

183
0:07:54.7,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So, Patreon has over 50,000 creators on the platform making salaries --

184
0:07:59.58,000 --> 0:08:02,000
getting paid every month for putting art online,

185
0:08:02.66,000 --> 0:08:04,000
for being a creative person.

186
0:08:05.02,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The next hundred years of infrastructure is on the way

187
0:08:09.5,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and it's going to be different this time because of this --

188
0:08:12.3,000 --> 0:08:15,000
because of the direct connection between the person who makes the thing

189
0:08:15.7,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and the person who likes the thing.

190
0:08:19.14,000 --> 0:08:21,000
About seven or eight years ago,

191
0:08:21.42,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I went to a cocktail party.

192
0:08:24.66,000 --> 0:08:26,000
This is when the band had hit our first machine,

193
0:08:26.94,000 --> 0:08:27,000
so things were really cranking.

194
0:08:28.46,000 --> 0:08:3,000
We had just made about 400,000 dollars in one year

195
0:08:30.86,000 --> 0:08:32,000
through iTunes sales and brand deals and stuff like that.

196
0:08:33.58,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And this guy comes up to me and says,

197
0:08:36.38,000 --> 0:08:37,000
"Hey, Jack, what do you do?"

198
0:08:37.74,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I said, "I'm a musician."

199
0:08:39.86,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And he just sobered up immediately,

200
0:08:43.22,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and he stuck out his hand,

201
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
put a hand on my shoulder,

202
0:08:46.54,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and in a real earnest, very nice voice he was like,

203
0:08:50.3,000 --> 0:08:51,000
"I hope you make it someday."

204
0:08:51.705,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Laughter)

205
0:08:54.7,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And ...

206
0:08:57.06,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I have so many moments like that logged in my memory.

207
0:09:01.14,000 --> 0:09:03,000
I just cringe thinking of that.

208
0:09:04.02,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's so embarrassing to just not feel valued as a creative person.

209
0:09:10.98,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But as a species,

210
0:09:12.58,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we are leaving that cocktail party behind.

211
0:09:15.02,000 --> 0:09:17,000
We're leaving that culture,

212
0:09:17.18,000 --> 0:09:18,000
we're out of there.

213
0:09:19.02,000 --> 0:09:21,000
We're going to get so good at paying creators,

214
0:09:21.74,000 --> 0:09:22,000
within 10 years,

215
0:09:24.02,000 --> 0:09:27,000
kids graduating high school and college are going to think of being a creator

216
0:09:27.82,000 --> 0:09:28,000
as just being an option --

217
0:09:29.1,000 --> 0:09:3,000
I could be a doctor, I could be a lawyer,

218
0:09:31.077,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I could be a podcaster, I could have a web comic.

219
0:09:33.42,000 --> 0:09:35,000
It's just going to be something you can do.

220
0:09:35.5,000 --> 0:09:36,000
We're figuring it out.

221
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
It's going to be a viable and sustainable and respected profession.

222
0:09:41.58,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Creators are going to come out the other end of this weird 100 years,

223
0:09:44.86,000 --> 0:09:45,000
this century-long journey,

224
0:09:47.5,000 --> 0:09:48,000
with an awesome new machine.

225
0:09:49.66,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And they're going to be paid, and they're going to be valued.

226
0:09:53.58,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Thanks, everybody.

227
0:09:54.82,000 --> 0:09:57,000
(Applause)

228
0:10:00.18,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I think it went pretty well.

229
0:10:03.22,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I want artists who saw that to not give up --

230
0:10:06.98,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to know that we're getting there.

231
0:10:10.54,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It's not there yet,

232
0:10:13.18,000 --> 0:10:14,000
but in a couple years,

233
0:10:15.1,000 --> 0:10:17,000
there will be so many systems and tools for them

234
0:10:17.42,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to just make a living online,

235
0:10:19.42,000 --> 0:10:22,000
and if they've got a podcast that's starting to take off,

236
0:10:22.74,000 --> 0:10:24,000
but they're not able to make money on it yet,

237
0:10:24.9,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that's happening

238
0:10:26.14,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and they're going to be paid.

239
0:10:27.58,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It's happening.

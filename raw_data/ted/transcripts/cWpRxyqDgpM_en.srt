1
0:00:12.77,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is a lot of ones and zeros.

2
0:00:15.032,000 --> 0:00:18,000
It's what we call binary information.

3
0:00:18.131,000 --> 0:00:19,000
This is how computers talk.

4
0:00:19.573,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's how they store information.

5
0:00:21.502,000 --> 0:00:22,000
It's how computers think.

6
0:00:23.128,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's how computers do

7
0:00:24.747,000 --> 0:00:26,000
everything it is that computers do.

8
0:00:27.129,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'm a cybersecurity researcher,

9
0:00:29.176,000 --> 0:00:31,000
which means my job is to sit down with this information

10
0:00:31.246,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and try to make sense of it,

11
0:00:32.93,000 --> 0:00:34,000
to try to understand what all the ones and zeroes mean.

12
0:00:35.683,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Unfortunately for me, we're not just talking

13
0:00:37.526,000 --> 0:00:39,000
about the ones and zeros I have on the screen here.

14
0:00:39.76,000 --> 0:00:41,000
We're not just talking about a few pages of ones and zeros.

15
0:00:42.443,000 --> 0:00:44,000
We're talking about billions and billions

16
0:00:45.052,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of ones and zeros,

17
0:00:46.385,000 --> 0:00:48,000
more than anyone could possibly comprehend.

18
0:00:49.026,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Now, as exciting as that sounds,

19
0:00:50.885,000 --> 0:00:52,000
when I first started doing cyber —

20
0:00:53.377,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter) —

21
0:00:55.12,000 --> 0:00:57,000
when I first started doing cyber, I wasn't sure

22
0:00:57.123,000 --> 0:00:58,000
that sifting through ones and zeros

23
0:00:58.596,000 --> 0:01:,000
was what I wanted to do with the rest of my life,

24
0:01:00.89,000 --> 0:01:02,000
because in my mind, cyber

25
0:01:02.91,000 --> 0:01:05,000
was keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer,

26
0:01:06.591,000 --> 0:01:09,000
it was keeping people's Myspace pages from being hacked,

27
0:01:09.939,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and maybe, maybe on my most glorious day,

28
0:01:12.124,000 --> 0:01:15,000
it was keeping someone's credit card information from being stolen.

29
0:01:15.875,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Those are important things,

30
0:01:17.238,000 --> 0:01:19,000
but that's not how I wanted to spend my life.

31
0:01:19.996,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But after 30 minutes of work

32
0:01:21.93,000 --> 0:01:22,000
as a defense contractor,

33
0:01:23.283,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I soon found out that my idea of cyber

34
0:01:26.073,000 --> 0:01:27,000
was a little bit off.

35
0:01:27.942,000 --> 0:01:28,000
In fact, in terms of national security,

36
0:01:29.887,000 --> 0:01:31,000
keeping viruses off of my grandma's computer

37
0:01:31.958,000 --> 0:01:34,000
was surprisingly low on their priority list.

38
0:01:35.144,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And the reason for that is cyber

39
0:01:36.445,000 --> 0:01:39,000
is so much bigger than any one of those things.

40
0:01:40.238,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Cyber is an integral part of all of our lives,

41
0:01:43.063,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because computers are an integral part of all of our lives,

42
0:01:46.123,000 --> 0:01:47,000
even if you don't own a computer.

43
0:01:48.075,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Computers control everything in your car,

44
0:01:50.721,000 --> 0:01:51,000
from your GPS to your airbags.

45
0:01:52.601,000 --> 0:01:53,000
They control your phone.

46
0:01:53.917,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They're the reason you can call 911

47
0:01:55.088,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and get someone on the other line.

48
0:01:56.884,000 --> 0:01:58,000
They control our nation's entire infrastructure.

49
0:01:59.678,000 --> 0:02:,000
They're the reason you have electricity,

50
0:02:01.354,000 --> 0:02:03,000
heat, clean water, food.

51
0:02:03.692,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Computers control our military equipment,

52
0:02:05.593,000 --> 0:02:06,000
everything from missile silos to satellites

53
0:02:07.27,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to nuclear defense networks.

54
0:02:11.184,000 --> 0:02:12,000
All of these things are made possible

55
0:02:13.173,000 --> 0:02:14,000
because of computers,

56
0:02:14.589,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and therefore because of cyber,

57
0:02:16.572,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and when something goes wrong,

58
0:02:18.076,000 --> 0:02:21,000
cyber can make all of these things impossible.

59
0:02:21.194,000 --> 0:02:22,000
But that's where I step in.

60
0:02:22.779,000 --> 0:02:24,000
A big part of my job is defending all of these things,

61
0:02:25.719,000 --> 0:02:26,000
keeping them working,

62
0:02:27.381,000 --> 0:02:29,000
but once in a while, part of my job is to break one of these things,

63
0:02:29.709,000 --> 0:02:31,000
because cyber isn't just about defense,

64
0:02:32.105,000 --> 0:02:34,000
it's also about offense.

65
0:02:34.378,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We're entering an age where we talk about

66
0:02:35.954,000 --> 0:02:36,000
cyberweapons.

67
0:02:37.415,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In fact, so great is the potential for cyber offense

68
0:02:40.55,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that cyber is considered a new domain of warfare.

69
0:02:44.171,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Warfare.

70
0:02:45.971,000 --> 0:02:46,000
It's not necessarily a bad thing.

71
0:02:47.9,000 --> 0:02:49,000
On the one hand, it means we have whole new front

72
0:02:50.651,000 --> 0:02:51,000
on which we need to defend ourselves,

73
0:02:52.394,000 --> 0:02:53,000
but on the other hand,

74
0:02:53.879,000 --> 0:02:54,000
it means we have a whole new way to attack,

75
0:02:55.721,000 --> 0:02:56,000
a whole new way to stop evil people

76
0:02:57.58,000 --> 0:02:59,000
from doing evil things.

77
0:02:59.807,000 --> 0:03:,000
So let's consider an example of this

78
0:03:01.618,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that's completely theoretical.

79
0:03:03.307,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Suppose a terrorist wants to blow up a building,

80
0:03:05.565,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and he wants to do this again and again

81
0:03:07.633,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in the future.

82
0:03:09.084,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So he doesn't want to be in that building when it explodes.

83
0:03:11.924,000 --> 0:03:12,000
He's going to use a cell phone

84
0:03:13.442,000 --> 0:03:15,000
as a remote detonator.

85
0:03:15.777,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Now, it used to be the only way we had

86
0:03:17.648,000 --> 0:03:18,000
to stop this terrorist

87
0:03:19.284,000 --> 0:03:21,000
was with a hail of bullets and a car chase,

88
0:03:21.957,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but that's not necessarily true anymore.

89
0:03:24.289,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We're entering an age where we can stop him

90
0:03:25.852,000 --> 0:03:26,000
with the press of a button

91
0:03:26.962,000 --> 0:03:28,000
from 1,000 miles away,

92
0:03:28.969,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because whether he knew it or not,

93
0:03:30.558,000 --> 0:03:31,000
as soon as he decided to use his cell phone,

94
0:03:32.269,000 --> 0:03:35,000
he stepped into the realm of cyber.

95
0:03:35.403,000 --> 0:03:38,000
A well-crafted cyber attack could break into his phone,

96
0:03:38.52,000 --> 0:03:4,000
disable the overvoltage protections on his battery,

97
0:03:40.669,000 --> 0:03:41,000
drastically overload the circuit,

98
0:03:42.424,000 --> 0:03:44,000
cause the battery to overheat, and explode.

99
0:03:44.781,000 --> 0:03:46,000
No more phone, no more detonator,

100
0:03:47.227,000 --> 0:03:48,000
maybe no more terrorist,

101
0:03:49.15,000 --> 0:03:5,000
all with the press of a button

102
0:03:50.181,000 --> 0:03:52,000
from a thousand miles away.

103
0:03:52.861,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So how does this work?

104
0:03:54.612,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It all comes back to those ones and zeros.

105
0:03:56.88,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Binary information makes your phone work,

106
0:03:59.885,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and used correctly, it can make your phone explode.

107
0:04:03.469,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So when you start to look at cyber from this perspective,

108
0:04:05.941,000 --> 0:04:08,000
spending your life sifting through binary information

109
0:04:09.104,000 --> 0:04:11,000
starts to seem kind of exciting.

110
0:04:11.521,000 --> 0:04:13,000
But here's the catch: This is hard,

111
0:04:14.167,000 --> 0:04:15,000
really, really hard,

112
0:04:15.852,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and here's why.

113
0:04:17.686,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Think about everything you have on your cell phone.

114
0:04:20.452,000 --> 0:04:21,000
You've got the pictures you've taken.

115
0:04:22.415,000 --> 0:04:23,000
You've got the music you listen to.

116
0:04:24.201,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You've got your contacts list,

117
0:04:25.849,000 --> 0:04:26,000
your email, and probably 500 apps

118
0:04:27.474,000 --> 0:04:3,000
you've never used in your entire life,

119
0:04:30.475,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and behind all of this is the software, the code,

120
0:04:34.462,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that controls your phone,

121
0:04:35.842,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and somewhere, buried inside of that code,

122
0:04:38.498,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is a tiny piece that controls your battery,

123
0:04:41.046,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and that's what I'm really after,

124
0:04:42.917,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but all of this, just a bunch of ones and zeros,

125
0:04:46.603,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and it's all just mixed together.

126
0:04:48.134,000 --> 0:04:51,000
In cyber, we call this finding a needle in a stack of needles,

127
0:04:51.679,000 --> 0:04:53,000
because everything pretty much looks alike.

128
0:04:54.028,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I'm looking for one key piece,

129
0:04:55.76,000 --> 0:04:58,000
but it just blends in with everything else.

130
0:04:58.994,000 --> 0:05:,000
So let's step back from this theoretical situation

131
0:05:01.246,000 --> 0:05:03,000
of making a terrorist's phone explode,

132
0:05:03.59,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and look at something that actually happened to me.

133
0:05:06.406,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Pretty much no matter what I do,

134
0:05:07.749,000 --> 0:05:08,000
my job always starts with sitting down

135
0:05:09.191,000 --> 0:05:11,000
with a whole bunch of binary information,

136
0:05:11.563,000 --> 0:05:12,000
and I'm always looking for one key piece

137
0:05:13.29,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to do something specific.

138
0:05:15.277,000 --> 0:05:17,000
In this case, I was looking for a very advanced,

139
0:05:17.354,000 --> 0:05:18,000
very high-tech piece of code

140
0:05:18.872,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that I knew I could hack,

141
0:05:20.087,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but it was somewhere buried

142
0:05:21.801,000 --> 0:05:23,000
inside of a billion ones and zeroes.

143
0:05:23.827,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Unfortunately for me, I didn't know

144
0:05:25.405,000 --> 0:05:26,000
quite what I was looking for.

145
0:05:27.096,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I didn't know quite what it would look like,

146
0:05:28.292,000 --> 0:05:3,000
which makes finding it really, really hard.

147
0:05:31.21,000 --> 0:05:33,000
When I have to do that, what I have to do

148
0:05:33.249,000 --> 0:05:35,000
is basically look at various pieces

149
0:05:35.591,000 --> 0:05:36,000
of this binary information,

150
0:05:37.314,000 --> 0:05:39,000
try to decipher each piece, and see if it might be

151
0:05:39.516,000 --> 0:05:4,000
what I'm after.

152
0:05:40.74,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So after a while, I thought I had found the piece

153
0:05:42.365,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I was looking for.

154
0:05:43.702,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I thought maybe this was it.

155
0:05:45.806,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It seemed to be about right, but I couldn't quite tell.

156
0:05:47.838,000 --> 0:05:49,000
I couldn't tell what those ones and zeros represented.

157
0:05:50.756,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So I spent some time trying to put this together,

158
0:05:54.13,000 --> 0:05:55,000
but wasn't having a whole lot of luck,

159
0:05:55.8,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and finally I decided,

160
0:05:56.986,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I'm going to get through this,

161
0:05:58.595,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I'm going to come in on a weekend,

162
0:06:00.106,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I'm not going to leave

163
0:06:01.446,000 --> 0:06:02,000
until I figure out what this represents.

164
0:06:03.158,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So that's what I did. I came in on a Saturday morning,

165
0:06:05.324,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and about 10 hours in, I sort of had all the pieces to the puzzle.

166
0:06:08.969,000 --> 0:06:09,000
I just didn't know how they fit together.

167
0:06:10.361,000 --> 0:06:12,000
I didn't know what these ones and zeros meant.

168
0:06:13.151,000 --> 0:06:15,000
At the 15-hour mark,

169
0:06:15.218,000 --> 0:06:17,000
I started to get a better picture of what was there,

170
0:06:17.82,000 --> 0:06:18,000
but I had a creeping suspicion

171
0:06:19.592,000 --> 0:06:2,000
that what I was looking at

172
0:06:21.181,000 --> 0:06:23,000
was not at all related to what I was looking for.

173
0:06:24.104,000 --> 0:06:26,000
By 20 hours, the pieces started to come together

174
0:06:26.591,000 --> 0:06:29,000
very slowly — (Laughter) —

175
0:06:30.355,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and I was pretty sure I was going down

176
0:06:31.621,000 --> 0:06:32,000
the wrong path at this point,

177
0:06:33.56,000 --> 0:06:35,000
but I wasn't going to give up.

178
0:06:35.811,000 --> 0:06:37,000
After 30 hours in the lab,

179
0:06:38.645,000 --> 0:06:4,000
I figured out exactly what I was looking at,

180
0:06:40.906,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and I was right, it wasn't what I was looking for.

181
0:06:43.724,000 --> 0:06:44,000
I spent 30 hours piecing together

182
0:06:45.423,000 --> 0:06:47,000
the ones and zeros that formed a picture of a kitten.

183
0:06:48.145,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Laughter)

184
0:06:49.94,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I wasted 30 hours of my life searching for this kitten

185
0:06:53.746,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that had nothing at all to do

186
0:06:55.584,000 --> 0:06:56,000
with what I was trying to accomplish.

187
0:06:57.571,000 --> 0:07:,000
So I was frustrated, I was exhausted.

188
0:07:01.434,000 --> 0:07:04,000
After 30 hours in the lab, I probably smelled horrible.

189
0:07:04.66,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But instead of just going home

190
0:07:06.89,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and calling it quits, I took a step back

191
0:07:09.42,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and asked myself, what went wrong here?

192
0:07:11.961,000 --> 0:07:13,000
How could I make such a stupid mistake?

193
0:07:14.173,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I'm really pretty good at this.

194
0:07:15.571,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I do this for a living.

195
0:07:16.89,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So what happened?

196
0:07:19.038,000 --> 0:07:21,000
Well I thought, when you're looking at information at this level,

197
0:07:21.813,000 --> 0:07:23,000
it's so easy to lose track of what you're doing.

198
0:07:24.64,000 --> 0:07:25,000
It's easy to not see the forest through the trees.

199
0:07:26.384,000 --> 0:07:28,000
It's easy to go down the wrong rabbit hole

200
0:07:28.548,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and waste a tremendous amount of time

201
0:07:30.31,000 --> 0:07:31,000
doing the wrong thing.

202
0:07:32.13,000 --> 0:07:33,000
But I had this epiphany.

203
0:07:33.73,000 --> 0:07:35,000
We were looking at the data completely incorrectly

204
0:07:36.729,000 --> 0:07:37,000
since day one.

205
0:07:38.219,000 --> 0:07:4,000
This is how computers think, ones and zeros.

206
0:07:40.322,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's not how people think,

207
0:07:41.714,000 --> 0:07:43,000
but we've been trying to adapt our minds

208
0:07:44.028,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to think more like computers

209
0:07:45.373,000 --> 0:07:47,000
so that we can understand this information.

210
0:07:47.97,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Instead of trying to make our minds fit the problem,

211
0:07:49.92,000 --> 0:07:5,000
we should have been making the problem

212
0:07:51.568,000 --> 0:07:51,000
fit our minds,

213
0:07:52.537,000 --> 0:07:54,000
because our brains have a tremendous potential

214
0:07:54.646,000 --> 0:07:57,000
for analyzing huge amounts of information,

215
0:07:57.732,000 --> 0:07:58,000
just not like this.

216
0:07:59.029,000 --> 0:08:,000
So what if we could unlock that potential

217
0:08:00.496,000 --> 0:08:01,000
just by translating this

218
0:08:02.023,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to the right kind of information?

219
0:08:04.871,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So with these ideas in mind,

220
0:08:06.065,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I sprinted out of my basement lab at work

221
0:08:07.683,000 --> 0:08:08,000
to my basement lab at home,

222
0:08:08.99,000 --> 0:08:09,000
which looked pretty much the same.

223
0:08:10.986,000 --> 0:08:11,000
The main difference is, at work,

224
0:08:12.81,000 --> 0:08:13,000
I'm surrounded by cyber materials,

225
0:08:14.389,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and cyber seemed to be the problem in this situation.

226
0:08:16.994,000 --> 0:08:19,000
At home, I'm surrounded by everything else I've ever learned.

227
0:08:20.347,000 --> 0:08:21,000
So I poured through every book I could find,

228
0:08:22.219,000 --> 0:08:23,000
every idea I'd ever encountered,

229
0:08:23.551,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to see how could we translate a problem

230
0:08:25.697,000 --> 0:08:28,000
from one domain to something completely different?

231
0:08:28.829,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The biggest question was,

232
0:08:30.223,000 --> 0:08:31,000
what do we want to translate it to?

233
0:08:32.191,000 --> 0:08:34,000
What do our brains do perfectly naturally

234
0:08:34.303,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that we could exploit?

235
0:08:36.181,000 --> 0:08:38,000
My answer was vision.

236
0:08:38.47,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We have a tremendous capability to analyze visual information.

237
0:08:41.619,000 --> 0:08:43,000
We can combine color gradients, depth cues,

238
0:08:44.202,000 --> 0:08:45,000
all sorts of these different signals

239
0:08:45.99,000 --> 0:08:47,000
into one coherent picture of the world around us.

240
0:08:48.385,000 --> 0:08:49,000
That's incredible.

241
0:08:49.792,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So if we could find a way to translate

242
0:08:51.173,000 --> 0:08:53,000
these binary patterns to visual signals,

243
0:08:53.359,000 --> 0:08:54,000
we could really unlock the power of our brains

244
0:08:55.191,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to process this stuff.

245
0:08:57.901,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So I started looking at the binary information,

246
0:08:59.744,000 --> 0:09:,000
and I asked myself, what do I do

247
0:09:00.834,000 --> 0:09:01,000
when I first encounter something like this?

248
0:09:02.71,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And the very first thing I want to do,

249
0:09:04.333,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the very first question I want to answer,

250
0:09:05.692,000 --> 0:09:06,000
is what is this?

251
0:09:06.97,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I don't care what it does, how it works.

252
0:09:09.498,000 --> 0:09:11,000
All I want to know is, what is this?

253
0:09:11.977,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And the way I can figure that out

254
0:09:13.652,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is by looking at chunks,

255
0:09:15.335,000 --> 0:09:17,000
sequential chunks of binary information,

256
0:09:17.788,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and I look at the relationships between those chunks.

257
0:09:20.69,000 --> 0:09:21,000
When I gather up enough of these sequences,

258
0:09:22.462,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I begin to get an idea of exactly

259
0:09:24.466,000 --> 0:09:26,000
what this information must be.

260
0:09:27.1,000 --> 0:09:28,000
So let's go back to that

261
0:09:28.284,000 --> 0:09:3,000
blow up the terrorist's phone situation.

262
0:09:30.374,000 --> 0:09:32,000
This is what English text looks like

263
0:09:32.577,000 --> 0:09:33,000
at a binary level.

264
0:09:33.89,000 --> 0:09:35,000
This is what your contacts list would look like

265
0:09:36.216,000 --> 0:09:37,000
if I were examining it.

266
0:09:37.776,000 --> 0:09:39,000
It's really hard to analyze this at this level,

267
0:09:40.01,000 --> 0:09:42,000
but if we take those same binary chunks

268
0:09:42.114,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that I would be trying to find,

269
0:09:43.296,000 --> 0:09:44,000
and instead translate that

270
0:09:45.06,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to a visual representation,

271
0:09:46.98,000 --> 0:09:47,000
translate those relationships,

272
0:09:48.777,000 --> 0:09:49,000
this is what we get.

273
0:09:50.333,000 --> 0:09:51,000
This is what English text looks like

274
0:09:52.247,000 --> 0:09:54,000
from a visual abstraction perspective.

275
0:09:54.918,000 --> 0:09:55,000
All of a sudden,

276
0:09:56.058,000 --> 0:09:57,000
it shows us all the same information

277
0:09:57.493,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that was in the ones and zeros,

278
0:09:58.665,000 --> 0:10:,000
but show us it in an entirely different way,

279
0:10:00.986,000 --> 0:10:01,000
a way that we can immediately comprehend.

280
0:10:02.703,000 --> 0:10:04,000
We can instantly see all of the patterns here.

281
0:10:05.668,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It takes me seconds to pick out patterns here,

282
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
but hours, days, to pick them out

283
0:10:10.514,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in ones and zeros.

284
0:10:11.834,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It takes minutes for anybody to learn

285
0:10:13.57,000 --> 0:10:14,000
what these patterns represent here,

286
0:10:15.235,000 --> 0:10:17,000
but years of experience in cyber

287
0:10:17.482,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to learn what those same patterns represent

288
0:10:19.136,000 --> 0:10:2,000
in ones and zeros.

289
0:10:20.722,000 --> 0:10:21,000
So this piece is caused by

290
0:10:22.384,000 --> 0:10:24,000
lower case letters followed by lower case letters

291
0:10:24.408,000 --> 0:10:25,000
inside of that contact list.

292
0:10:26.175,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This is upper case by upper case,

293
0:10:27.516,000 --> 0:10:29,000
upper case by lower case, lower case by upper case.

294
0:10:30.201,000 --> 0:10:32,000
This is caused by spaces. This is caused by carriage returns.

295
0:10:32.887,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We can go through every little detail

296
0:10:34.395,000 --> 0:10:36,000
of the binary information in seconds,

297
0:10:37.361,000 --> 0:10:4,000
as opposed to weeks, months, at this level.

298
0:10:40.895,000 --> 0:10:41,000
This is what an image looks like

299
0:10:42.407,000 --> 0:10:43,000
from your cell phone.

300
0:10:44.283,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But this is what it looks like

301
0:10:45.296,000 --> 0:10:46,000
in a visual abstraction.

302
0:10:47.187,000 --> 0:10:48,000
This is what your music looks like,

303
0:10:49.172,000 --> 0:10:51,000
but here's its visual abstraction.

304
0:10:51.375,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Most importantly for me,

305
0:10:53.135,000 --> 0:10:56,000
this is what the code on your cell phone looks like.

306
0:10:56.41,000 --> 0:10:58,000
This is what I'm after in the end,

307
0:10:58.567,000 --> 0:11:,000
but this is its visual abstraction.

308
0:11:00.707,000 --> 0:11:02,000
If I can find this, I can't make the phone explode.

309
0:11:03.216,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I could spend weeks trying to find this

310
0:11:05.835,000 --> 0:11:06,000
in ones and zeros,

311
0:11:07.012,000 --> 0:11:08,000
but it takes me seconds to pick out

312
0:11:08.796,000 --> 0:11:11,000
a visual abstraction like this.

313
0:11:12.1,000 --> 0:11:14,000
One of those most remarkable parts about all of this

314
0:11:14.592,000 --> 0:11:16,000
is it gives us an entirely new way to understand

315
0:11:17.424,000 --> 0:11:2,000
new information, stuff that we haven't seen before.

316
0:11:20.663,000 --> 0:11:22,000
So I know what English looks like at a binary level,

317
0:11:23.167,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and I know what its visual abstraction looks like,

318
0:11:25.277,000 --> 0:11:28,000
but I've never seen Russian binary in my entire life.

319
0:11:28.592,000 --> 0:11:29,000
It would take me weeks just to figure out

320
0:11:30.392,000 --> 0:11:32,000
what I was looking at from raw ones and zeros,

321
0:11:33.389,000 --> 0:11:34,000
but because our brains can instantly pick up

322
0:11:35.14,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and recognize these subtle patterns inside

323
0:11:37.957,000 --> 0:11:38,000
of these visual abstractions,

324
0:11:39.445,000 --> 0:11:4,000
we can unconsciously apply those

325
0:11:41.277,000 --> 0:11:42,000
in new situations.

326
0:11:42.85,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So this is what Russian looks like

327
0:11:44.332,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in a visual abstraction.

328
0:11:45.912,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Because I know what one language looks like,

329
0:11:47.716,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I can recognize other languages

330
0:11:49.292,000 --> 0:11:5,000
even when I'm not familiar with them.

331
0:11:51.162,000 --> 0:11:52,000
This is what a photograph looks like,

332
0:11:52.948,000 --> 0:11:53,000
but this is what clip art looks like.

333
0:11:54.835,000 --> 0:11:56,000
This is what the code on your phone looks like,

334
0:11:57.39,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but this is what the code on your computer looks like.

335
0:12:00.097,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Our brains can pick up on these patterns

336
0:12:01.961,000 --> 0:12:02,000
in ways that we never could have

337
0:12:03.912,000 --> 0:12:05,000
from looking at raw ones and zeros.

338
0:12:06.408,000 --> 0:12:07,000
But we've really only scratched the surface

339
0:12:08.264,000 --> 0:12:1,000
of what we can do with this approach.

340
0:12:10.401,000 --> 0:12:11,000
We've only begun to unlock the capabilities

341
0:12:12.079,000 --> 0:12:15,000
of our minds to process visual information.

342
0:12:15.394,000 --> 0:12:16,000
If we take those same concepts and translate them

343
0:12:17.384,000 --> 0:12:18,000
into three dimensions instead,

344
0:12:19.035,000 --> 0:12:22,000
we find entirely new ways of making sense of information.

345
0:12:22.23,000 --> 0:12:24,000
In seconds, we can pick out every pattern here.

346
0:12:24.715,000 --> 0:12:25,000
we can see the cross associated with code.

347
0:12:26.535,000 --> 0:12:27,000
We can see cubes associated with text.

348
0:12:28.467,000 --> 0:12:3,000
We can even pick up the tiniest visual artifacts.

349
0:12:30.943,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Things that would take us weeks,

350
0:12:33.073,000 --> 0:12:35,000
months to find in ones and zeroes,

351
0:12:35.267,000 --> 0:12:36,000
are immediately apparent

352
0:12:37.07,000 --> 0:12:39,000
in some sort of visual abstraction,

353
0:12:39.34,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and as we continue to go through this

354
0:12:40.472,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and throw more and more information at it,

355
0:12:42.488,000 --> 0:12:44,000
what we find is that we're capable of processing

356
0:12:44.769,000 --> 0:12:46,000
billions of ones and zeros

357
0:12:47.185,000 --> 0:12:48,000
in a matter of seconds

358
0:12:48.353,000 --> 0:12:51,000
just by using our brain's built-in ability

359
0:12:51.587,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to analyze patterns.

360
0:12:53.541,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So this is really nice and helpful,

361
0:12:55.844,000 --> 0:12:57,000
but all this tells me is what I'm looking at.

362
0:12:58.203,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So at this point, based on visual patterns,

363
0:12:59.687,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I can find the code on the phone.

364
0:13:02.096,000 --> 0:13:04,000
But that's not enough to blow up a battery.

365
0:13:04.761,000 --> 0:13:05,000
The next thing I need to find is the code

366
0:13:06.329,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that controls the battery, but we're back

367
0:13:08.09,000 --> 0:13:09,000
to the needle in a stack of needles problem.

368
0:13:09.821,000 --> 0:13:11,000
That code looks pretty much like all the other code

369
0:13:12.21,000 --> 0:13:14,000
on that system.

370
0:13:14.448,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So I might not be able to find the code that controls the battery,

371
0:13:16.849,000 --> 0:13:18,000
but there's a lot of things that are very similar to that.

372
0:13:18.86,000 --> 0:13:19,000
You have code that controls your screen,

373
0:13:20.714,000 --> 0:13:22,000
that controls your buttons, that controls your microphones,

374
0:13:22.93,000 --> 0:13:23,000
so even if I can't find the code for the battery,

375
0:13:24.858,000 --> 0:13:26,000
I bet I can find one of those things.

376
0:13:27.103,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So the next step in my binary analysis process

377
0:13:29.808,000 --> 0:13:3,000
is to look at pieces of information

378
0:13:31.039,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that are similar to each other.

379
0:13:33.057,000 --> 0:13:36,000
It's really, really hard to do at a binary level,

380
0:13:37.04,000 --> 0:13:4,000
but if we translate those similarities to a visual abstraction instead,

381
0:13:40.683,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I don't even have to sift through the raw data.

382
0:13:43.121,000 --> 0:13:45,000
All I have to do is wait for the image to light up

383
0:13:45.276,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to see when I'm at similar pieces.

384
0:13:47.512,000 --> 0:13:5,000
I follow these strands of similarity like a trail of bread crumbs

385
0:13:50.54,000 --> 0:13:53,000
to find exactly what I'm looking for.

386
0:13:53.646,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So at this point in the process,

387
0:13:55.38,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I've located the code

388
0:13:56.698,000 --> 0:13:57,000
responsible for controlling your battery,

389
0:13:58.383,000 --> 0:14:,000
but that's still not enough to blow up a phone.

390
0:14:00.959,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The last piece of the puzzle

391
0:14:02.523,000 --> 0:14:04,000
is understanding how that code

392
0:14:05.202,000 --> 0:14:06,000
controls your battery.

393
0:14:06.404,000 --> 0:14:08,000
For this, I need to identify

394
0:14:08.792,000 --> 0:14:09,000
very subtle, very detailed relationships

395
0:14:10.508,000 --> 0:14:12,000
within that binary information,

396
0:14:12.597,000 --> 0:14:13,000
another very hard thing to do

397
0:14:14.352,000 --> 0:14:16,000
when looking at ones and zeros.

398
0:14:16.664,000 --> 0:14:17,000
But if we translate that information

399
0:14:18.06,000 --> 0:14:2,000
into a physical representation,

400
0:14:20.24,000 --> 0:14:23,000
we can sit back and let our visual cortex do all the hard work.

401
0:14:23.256,000 --> 0:14:24,000
It can find all the detailed patterns,

402
0:14:24.99,000 --> 0:14:26,000
all the important pieces, for us.

403
0:14:27.01,000 --> 0:14:29,000
It can find out exactly how the pieces of that code

404
0:14:29.603,000 --> 0:14:31,000
work together to control that battery.

405
0:14:32.537,000 --> 0:14:35,000
All of this can be done in a matter of hours,

406
0:14:35.541,000 --> 0:14:36,000
whereas the same process

407
0:14:36.897,000 --> 0:14:38,000
would have taken months in the past.

408
0:14:39.819,000 --> 0:14:4,000
This is all well and good

409
0:14:41.008,000 --> 0:14:43,000
in a theoretical blow up a terrorist's phone situation.

410
0:14:43.95,000 --> 0:14:45,000
I wanted to find out if this would really work

411
0:14:46.797,000 --> 0:14:48,000
in the work I do every day.

412
0:14:49.426,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So I was playing around with these same concepts

413
0:14:52.481,000 --> 0:14:55,000
with some of the data I've looked at in the past,

414
0:14:55.505,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and yet again, I was trying to find

415
0:14:57.997,000 --> 0:14:59,000
a very detailed, specific piece of code

416
0:15:00.205,000 --> 0:15:03,000
inside of a massive piece of binary information.

417
0:15:03.8,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So I looked at it at this level,

418
0:15:05.573,000 --> 0:15:06,000
thinking I was looking at the right thing,

419
0:15:07.523,000 --> 0:15:09,000
only to see this doesn't have

420
0:15:09.844,000 --> 0:15:1,000
the connectivity I would have expected

421
0:15:11.584,000 --> 0:15:12,000
for the code I was looking for.

422
0:15:13.489,000 --> 0:15:15,000
In fact, I'm not really sure what this is,

423
0:15:16.092,000 --> 0:15:17,000
but when I stepped back a level

424
0:15:17.104,000 --> 0:15:18,000
and looked at the similarities within the code

425
0:15:18.819,000 --> 0:15:2,000
I saw, this doesn't have similarities

426
0:15:21.113,000 --> 0:15:22,000
like any code that exists out there.

427
0:15:22.604,000 --> 0:15:24,000
I can't even be looking at code.

428
0:15:24.829,000 --> 0:15:26,000
In fact, from this perspective,

429
0:15:27.215,000 --> 0:15:29,000
I could tell, this isn't code.

430
0:15:29.263,000 --> 0:15:31,000
This is an image of some sort.

431
0:15:31.311,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And from here, I can see,

432
0:15:32.993,000 --> 0:15:34,000
it's not just an image, this is a photograph.

433
0:15:35.904,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Now that I know it's a photograph,

434
0:15:37.296,000 --> 0:15:39,000
I've got dozens of other binary translation techniques

435
0:15:40.226,000 --> 0:15:42,000
to visualize and understand that information,

436
0:15:42.647,000 --> 0:15:44,000
so in a matter of seconds, we can take this information,

437
0:15:45.19,000 --> 0:15:47,000
shove it through a dozen other visual translation techniques

438
0:15:47.587,000 --> 0:15:5,000
in order to find out exactly what we were looking at.

439
0:15:51.318,000 --> 0:15:52,000
I saw — (Laughter) —

440
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:56,000
it was that darn kitten again.

441
0:15:56.456,000 --> 0:15:57,000
All this is enabled

442
0:15:57.506,000 --> 0:15:58,000
because we were able to find a way

443
0:15:59.001,000 --> 0:16:01,000
to translate a very hard problem

444
0:16:01.03,000 --> 0:16:03,000
to something our brains do very naturally.

445
0:16:03.542,000 --> 0:16:05,000
So what does this mean?

446
0:16:05.78,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Well, for kittens, it means

447
0:16:07.325,000 --> 0:16:09,000
no more hiding in ones and zeros.

448
0:16:09.742,000 --> 0:16:12,000
For me, it means no more wasted weekends.

449
0:16:13.045,000 --> 0:16:15,000
For cyber, it means we have a radical new way

450
0:16:15.657,000 --> 0:16:17,000
to tackle the most impossible problems.

451
0:16:18.622,000 --> 0:16:19,000
It means we have a new weapon

452
0:16:20.434,000 --> 0:16:22,000
in the evolving theater of cyber warfare,

453
0:16:22.85,000 --> 0:16:23,000
but for all of us,

454
0:16:24.27,000 --> 0:16:25,000
it means that cyber engineers

455
0:16:25.745,000 --> 0:16:27,000
now have the ability to become first responders

456
0:16:27.891,000 --> 0:16:29,000
in emergency situations.

457
0:16:30.474,000 --> 0:16:31,000
When seconds count,

458
0:16:31.521,000 --> 0:16:34,000
we've unlocked the means to stop the bad guys.

459
0:16:34.93,000 --> 0:16:36,000
Thank you.

460
0:16:36.93,000 --> 0:16:38,000
(Applause)

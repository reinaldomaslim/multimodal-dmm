1
0:00:12.93,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Even nature's most disgusting creatures

2
0:00:15.834,000 --> 0:00:17,000
have important secrets,

3
0:00:18.401,000 --> 0:00:19,000
but who would want a swarm of cockroaches

4
0:00:19.89,000 --> 0:00:2,000
coming towards them?

5
0:00:21.484,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Yet one of the greatest differences between natural and human technologies

6
0:00:24.496,000 --> 0:00:26,000
relates to robustness.

7
0:00:26.711,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Robust systems are stable in complex

8
0:00:29.284,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and new environments.

9
0:00:31.005,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Remarkably, cockroaches can self-stabilize

10
0:00:32.8,000 --> 0:00:33,000
running over rough terrain.

11
0:00:34.479,000 --> 0:00:35,000
When we put a jet pack on them,

12
0:00:35.741,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or give them a perturbation like an earthquake,

13
0:00:37.752,000 --> 0:00:39,000
we discovered that their wonderfully tuned legs

14
0:00:40.643,000 --> 0:00:41,000
allow them to self-stabilize

15
0:00:42.268,000 --> 0:00:45,000
without using any of their brainpower.

16
0:00:45.93,000 --> 0:00:48,000
They can go over complex terrain like grass,

17
0:00:49.06,000 --> 0:00:5,000
no problem, and not get destabilized.

18
0:00:51.012,000 --> 0:00:52,000
We discovered a new behavior where,

19
0:00:52.526,000 --> 0:00:53,000
because of their shape,

20
0:00:53.69,000 --> 0:00:55,000
they actually roll automatically to their side

21
0:00:55.768,000 --> 0:00:58,000
to go through this artificial test bit of grass.

22
0:00:59.72,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Robust systems can perform multiple tasks

23
0:01:02.157,000 --> 0:01:04,000
with the same structure.

24
0:01:04.295,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Here's a new behavior we've discovered.

25
0:01:06.162,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The animals rapidly invert and disappear

26
0:01:08.008,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in less than 150 milliseconds — you never see them —

27
0:01:10.509,000 --> 0:01:12,000
using the same structures that they use to run, their legs.

28
0:01:12.872,000 --> 0:01:13,000
They can run upside down

29
0:01:14.476,000 --> 0:01:17,000
very rapidly on rods, branches and wires,

30
0:01:17.608,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and if you perturb one of those branches,

31
0:01:19.087,000 --> 0:01:2,000
they can do this.

32
0:01:20.88,000 --> 0:01:21,000
They can perform gymnastic maneuvers

33
0:01:22.41,000 --> 0:01:24,000
like no robot we have yet.

34
0:01:24.988,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And they have nearly unlimited

35
0:01:26.719,000 --> 0:01:28,000
maneuverability with that same structure

36
0:01:29.316,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and unprecedented access to a variety

37
0:01:33.136,000 --> 0:01:37,000
of different areas.

38
0:01:37.406,000 --> 0:01:39,000
They have wings for flying when they get warm,

39
0:01:40.029,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but they use those same wings to flip over

40
0:01:42.643,000 --> 0:01:45,000
if they get destabilized.

41
0:01:46.6,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Very effective.

42
0:01:47.897,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Robust systems are also fault tolerant and fail-safe.

43
0:01:51.102,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This is the foot of a cockroach.

44
0:01:52.242,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It has spines, gluey pads and claws,

45
0:01:55.531,000 --> 0:01:56,000
but if you take off those feet,

46
0:01:57.122,000 --> 0:01:58,000
they can still go over rough terrain,

47
0:01:58.83,000 --> 0:01:59,000
like the bottom video that you see,

48
0:02:00.727,000 --> 0:02:03,000
without hardly slowing down. Extraordinary.

49
0:02:04.098,000 --> 0:02:07,000
They can run up mesh without their feet.

50
0:02:07.271,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Here's an animal using a normal, alternating tripod:

51
0:02:09.554,000 --> 0:02:1,000
three legs, three legs, three legs,

52
0:02:11.097,000 --> 0:02:14,000
but in nature, the insects often have lost their legs.

53
0:02:14.789,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Here's one moving with two middle legs gone.

54
0:02:18.799,000 --> 0:02:2,000
It can even lose three legs, in a tripod,

55
0:02:21.715,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and adopt a new gait, a hopping gait.

56
0:02:25.642,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And I point out that all of these videos

57
0:02:27.6,000 --> 0:02:28,000
are slowed down 20 times,

58
0:02:29.304,000 --> 0:02:31,000
so they're actually really fast, when you see this.

59
0:02:31.319,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Robust systems are also damage resistant.

60
0:02:34.83,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Here's an animal climbing up a wall.

61
0:02:36.643,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It looks like a rapid, smooth, vertical climb,

62
0:02:39.139,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but when you slow it down,

63
0:02:40.378,000 --> 0:02:42,000
you see something very different.

64
0:02:42.872,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Here's what they do.

65
0:02:44.52,000 --> 0:02:47,000
They intentionally have a head-on collision with the wall

66
0:02:47.527,000 --> 0:02:49,000
so they don't slow down and can transition up it

67
0:02:49.641,000 --> 0:02:51,000
in 75 milliseconds.

68
0:02:52.039,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And they can do this in part because they have

69
0:02:53.9,000 --> 0:02:55,000
extraordinary exoskeletons.

70
0:02:55.957,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And they're really just made up of compliant joints

71
0:02:59.766,000 --> 0:03:,000
that are tubes and plates

72
0:03:01.499,000 --> 0:03:02,000
connected to one another.

73
0:03:03.042,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Here's a dissection of an abdomen of a cockroach.

74
0:03:05.989,000 --> 0:03:08,000
You see these plates, and you see the compliant membrane.

75
0:03:09.95,000 --> 0:03:11,000
My engineering colleague at Berkeley

76
0:03:12.766,000 --> 0:03:13,000
designed with his students

77
0:03:13.89,000 --> 0:03:14,000
a novel manufacturing technique

78
0:03:15.371,000 --> 0:03:18,000
where you essentially origami the exoskeleton,

79
0:03:18.982,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you laser cut it, laminate it,

80
0:03:20.342,000 --> 0:03:22,000
and you fold it up into a robot.

81
0:03:22.737,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And you can do that now in less than 15 minutes.

82
0:03:28.554,000 --> 0:03:29,000
These robots, called DASH,

83
0:03:30.493,000 --> 0:03:32,000
for Dynamic Autonomous Sprawled Hexapod,

84
0:03:33.103,000 --> 0:03:36,000
are highly compliant robots,

85
0:03:36.185,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and they're remarkably robust as a result

86
0:03:39.887,000 --> 0:03:4,000
of these features.

87
0:03:41.69,000 --> 0:03:47,000
They're certainly incredibly damage resistant.

88
0:03:47.748,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter)

89
0:03:51.101,000 --> 0:03:53,000
They even have some of the behaviors of the cockroaches.

90
0:03:53.57,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So they can use their smart, compliant body

91
0:03:55.843,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to transition up a wall

92
0:03:58.36,000 --> 0:04:,000
in a very simple way.

93
0:04:01.252,000 --> 0:04:02,000
They even have some of the beginnings

94
0:04:02.88,000 --> 0:04:03,000
of the rapid inversion behavior

95
0:04:04.199,000 --> 0:04:06,000
where they disappear.

96
0:04:07.043,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now we want to know why they can go anywhere.

97
0:04:08.52,000 --> 0:04:09,000
We discovered that they can go through

98
0:04:10.089,000 --> 0:04:11,000
three-millimeter gaps,

99
0:04:11.877,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the height of two pennies, two stacked pennies,

100
0:04:14.238,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and when they do this,

101
0:04:15.286,000 --> 0:04:17,000
they can actually run through those confined spaces

102
0:04:17.861,000 --> 0:04:18,000
at high speeds,

103
0:04:19.618,000 --> 0:04:22,000
although you never see it.

104
0:04:22.8,000 --> 0:04:23,000
To understand it better,

105
0:04:23.862,000 --> 0:04:25,000
we did a CT scan of the exoskeleton

106
0:04:25.94,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and showed that they can compress their body

107
0:04:27.414,000 --> 0:04:29,000
by over 40 percent.

108
0:04:30.06,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We put them in a materials testing machine

109
0:04:31.617,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to look at the stress strain analysis

110
0:04:33.973,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and showed that they can withstand forces

111
0:04:36.091,000 --> 0:04:37,000
800 times their body weight,

112
0:04:37.995,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and after this they can fly and run

113
0:04:39.885,000 --> 0:04:4,000
absolutely normally.

114
0:04:41.875,000 --> 0:04:42,000
So you never know where

115
0:04:43.598,000 --> 0:04:46,000
curiosity-based research will lead,

116
0:04:46.672,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and someday you may want a swarm

117
0:04:48.211,000 --> 0:04:5,000
of cockroach-inspired robots

118
0:04:50.405,000 --> 0:04:52,000
to come at you.

119
0:04:52.819,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

120
0:04:59.94,000 --> 0:05:,000
Thank you.

121
0:05:01.497,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Applause)

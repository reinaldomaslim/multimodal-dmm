1
0:00:12.74,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So it all came to life

2
0:00:14.448,000 --> 0:00:15,000
in a dark bar in Madrid.

3
0:00:16.843,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I encountered my colleague from McGill, Michael Meaney.

4
0:00:21.091,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And we were drinking a few beers,

5
0:00:23.42,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and like scientists do,

6
0:00:25.497,000 --> 0:00:26,000
he told me about his work.

7
0:00:28.124,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And he told me that he is interested in how mother rats lick their pups

8
0:00:35.102,000 --> 0:00:36,000
after they were born.

9
0:00:37.476,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And I was sitting there and saying,

10
0:00:39.919,000 --> 0:00:42,000
"This is where my tax dollars are wasted --

11
0:00:42.943,000 --> 0:00:43,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:44.001,000 --> 0:00:46,000
on this kind of soft science."

13
0:00:47.655,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And he started telling me

14
0:00:50.176,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that the rats, like humans,

15
0:00:53.6,000 --> 0:00:55,000
lick their pups in very different ways.

16
0:00:56.07,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Some mothers do a lot of that,

17
0:00:58.829,000 --> 0:01:,000
some mothers do very little,

18
0:01:01.058,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and most are in between.

19
0:01:03.687,000 --> 0:01:04,000
But what's interesting about it

20
0:01:05.612,000 --> 0:01:09,000
is when he follows these pups when they become adults --

21
0:01:10.554,000 --> 0:01:14,000
like, years in human life, long after their mother died.

22
0:01:14.757,000 --> 0:01:16,000
They are completely different animals.

23
0:01:16.849,000 --> 0:01:2,000
The animals that were licked and groomed heavily,

24
0:01:21.246,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the high-licking and grooming,

25
0:01:23.879,000 --> 0:01:24,000
are not stressed.

26
0:01:25.842,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They have different sexual behavior.

27
0:01:28.115,000 --> 0:01:3,000
They have a different way of living

28
0:01:31.094,000 --> 0:01:36,000
than those that were not treated as intensively by their mothers.

29
0:01:37.754,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So then I was thinking to myself:

30
0:01:40.942,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Is this magic?

31
0:01:42.822,000 --> 0:01:43,000
How does this work?

32
0:01:44.215,000 --> 0:01:46,000
As geneticists would like you to think,

33
0:01:47.21,000 --> 0:01:5,000
perhaps the mother had the "bad mother" gene

34
0:01:51.206,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that caused her pups to be stressful,

35
0:01:54.867,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and then it was passed from generation to generation;

36
0:01:57.438,000 --> 0:01:59,000
it's all determined by genetics.

37
0:02:00.162,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Or is it possible that something else is going on here?

38
0:02:03.68,000 --> 0:02:06,000
In rats, we can ask this question and answer it.

39
0:02:07.275,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So what we did is a cross-fostering experiment.

40
0:02:10.904,000 --> 0:02:14,000
You essentially separate the litter, the babies of this rat, at birth,

41
0:02:15.683,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to two kinds of fostering mothers --

42
0:02:17.574,000 --> 0:02:2,000
not the real mothers, but mothers that will take care of them:

43
0:02:20.926,000 --> 0:02:22,000
high-licking mothers and low-licking mothers.

44
0:02:23.204,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And you can do the opposite with the low-licking pups.

45
0:02:27.528,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And the remarkable answer was,

46
0:02:29.925,000 --> 0:02:33,000
it wasn't important what gene you got from your mother.

47
0:02:33.988,000 --> 0:02:38,000
It was not the biological mother that defined this property of these rats.

48
0:02:39.76,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It is the mother that took care of the pups.

49
0:02:44.591,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So how can this work?

50
0:02:48.741,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I am an a epigeneticist.

51
0:02:50.568,000 --> 0:02:53,000
I am interested in how genes are marked

52
0:02:54.264,000 --> 0:02:55,000
by a chemical mark

53
0:02:56.004,000 --> 0:03:,000
during embryogenesis, during the time we're in the womb of our mothers,

54
0:03:00.833,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and decide which gene will be expressed

55
0:03:03.336,000 --> 0:03:04,000
in what tissue.

56
0:03:04.542,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Different genes are expressed in the brain than in the liver and the eye.

57
0:03:09.538,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And we thought: Is it possible

58
0:03:12.401,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that the mother is somehow reprogramming the gene of her offspring

59
0:03:19.372,000 --> 0:03:2,000
through her behavior?

60
0:03:20.945,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And we spent 10 years,

61
0:03:22.58,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and we found that there is a cascade of biochemical events

62
0:03:26.645,000 --> 0:03:29,000
by which the licking and grooming of the mother, the care of the mother,

63
0:03:30.112,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is translated to biochemical signals

64
0:03:32.619,000 --> 0:03:35,000
that go into the nucleus and into the DNA

65
0:03:35.954,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and program it differently.

66
0:03:38.056,000 --> 0:03:42,000
So now the animal can prepare itself for life:

67
0:03:42.976,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Is life going to be harsh?

68
0:03:45.621,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Is there going to be a lot of food?

69
0:03:47.407,000 --> 0:03:49,000
Are there going to be a lot of cats and snakes around,

70
0:03:49.956,000 --> 0:03:51,000
or will I live in an upper-class neighborhood

71
0:03:52.303,000 --> 0:03:54,000
where all I have to do is behave well and proper,

72
0:03:55.034,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and that will gain me social acceptance?

73
0:03:58.798,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And now one can think about how important that process can be

74
0:04:04.413,000 --> 0:04:05,000
for our lives.

75
0:04:05.612,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We inherit our DNA from our ancestors.

76
0:04:09.231,000 --> 0:04:1,000
The DNA is old.

77
0:04:11.184,000 --> 0:04:13,000
It evolved during evolution.

78
0:04:13.758,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But it doesn't tell us if you are going to be born in Stockholm,

79
0:04:18.115,000 --> 0:04:21,000
where the days are long in the summer and short in the winter,

80
0:04:21.525,000 --> 0:04:22,000
or in Ecuador,

81
0:04:22.854,000 --> 0:04:25,000
where there's an equal number of hours for day and night all year round.

82
0:04:26.411,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And that has such an enormous [effect] on our physiology.

83
0:04:31.309,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So what we suggest is, perhaps what happens early in life,

84
0:04:35.569,000 --> 0:04:37,000
those signals that come through the mother,

85
0:04:37.76,000 --> 0:04:41,000
tell the child what kind of social world you're going to be living in.

86
0:04:42.299,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It will be harsh, and you'd better be anxious and be stressful,

87
0:04:45.723,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or it's going to be an easy world, and you have to be different.

88
0:04:48.87,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Is it going to be a world with a lot of light or little light?

89
0:04:52.084,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Is it going to be a world with a lot of food or little food?

90
0:04:56.093,000 --> 0:04:57,000
If there's no food around,

91
0:04:57.641,000 --> 0:05:01,000
you'd better develop your brain to binge whenever you see a meal,

92
0:05:02.281,000 --> 0:05:06,000
or store every piece of food that you have as fat.

93
0:05:08.639,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So this is good.

94
0:05:10.093,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Evolution has selected this

95
0:05:11.974,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to allow our fixed, old DNA to function in a dynamic way

96
0:05:16.894,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in new environments.

97
0:05:19.197,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But sometimes things can go wrong;

98
0:05:22.526,000 --> 0:05:25,000
for example, if you're born to a poor family

99
0:05:26.412,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and the signals are, "You better binge,

100
0:05:29.365,000 --> 0:05:32,000
you better eat every piece of food you're going to encounter."

101
0:05:32.604,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But now we humans and our brain have evolved,

102
0:05:34.88,000 --> 0:05:36,000
have changed evolution even faster.

103
0:05:37,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Now you can buy McDonald's for one dollar.

104
0:05:40.388,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And therefore, the preparation that we had by our mothers

105
0:05:46.822,000 --> 0:05:48,000
is turning out to be maladaptive.

106
0:05:50.171,000 --> 0:05:54,000
The same preparation that was supposed to protect us from hunger and famine

107
0:05:54.408,000 --> 0:05:56,000
is going to cause obesity,

108
0:05:56.889,000 --> 0:05:58,000
cardiovascular problems and metabolic disease.

109
0:06:00.486,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So this concept that genes could be marked by our experience,

110
0:06:03.982,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and especially the early life experience,

111
0:06:06.307,000 --> 0:06:08,000
can provide us a unifying explanation

112
0:06:09.145,000 --> 0:06:11,000
of both health and disease.

113
0:06:12.432,000 --> 0:06:14,000
But is true only for rats?

114
0:06:14.814,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The problem is, we cannot test this in humans,

115
0:06:17.79,000 --> 0:06:21,000
because ethically, we cannot administer child adversity in a random way.

116
0:06:21.926,000 --> 0:06:24,000
So if a poor child develops a certain property,

117
0:06:25.254,000 --> 0:06:28,000
we don't know whether this is caused by poverty

118
0:06:29.017,000 --> 0:06:31,000
or whether poor people have bad genes.

119
0:06:31.865,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So geneticists will try to tell you that poor people are poor

120
0:06:35.004,000 --> 0:06:37,000
because their genes make them poor.

121
0:06:37.084,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Epigeneticists will tell you

122
0:06:39.068,000 --> 0:06:43,000
poor people are in a bad environment or an impoverished environment

123
0:06:43.202,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that creates that phenotype, that property.

124
0:06:47.396,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So we moved to look into our cousins, the monkeys.

125
0:06:53.907,000 --> 0:06:56,000
My colleague, Stephen Suomi, has been rearing monkeys

126
0:06:57.625,000 --> 0:06:58,000
in two different ways:

127
0:06:58.81,000 --> 0:07:,000
randomly separated the monkey from the mother

128
0:07:01.735,000 --> 0:07:03,000
and reared her with a nurse

129
0:07:04.351,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and surrogate motherhood conditions.

130
0:07:07.334,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So these monkeys didn't have a mother; they had a nurse.

131
0:07:10.029,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And other monkeys were reared with their normal, natural mothers.

132
0:07:14.673,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And when they were old, they were completely different animals.

133
0:07:19.393,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The monkeys that had a mother did not care about alcohol,

134
0:07:22.51,000 --> 0:07:23,000
they were not sexually aggressive.

135
0:07:24.213,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The monkeys that didn't have a mother were aggressive, were stressed

136
0:07:28.004,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and were alcoholics.

137
0:07:30.302,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So we looked at their DNA early after birth, to see:

138
0:07:35.808,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Is it possible that the mother is marking?

139
0:07:38.599,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Is there a signature of the mother in the DNA of the offspring?

140
0:07:43.981,000 --> 0:07:45,000
These are Day-14 monkeys,

141
0:07:46.257,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and what you see here is the modern way by which we study epigenetics.

142
0:07:50.357,000 --> 0:07:54,000
We can now map those chemical marks, which we call methylation marks,

143
0:07:55.044,000 --> 0:07:58,000
on DNA at a single nucleotide resolution.

144
0:07:58.326,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We can map the entire genome.

145
0:08:00.227,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We can now compare the monkey that had a mother or not.

146
0:08:03.318,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And here's a visual presentation of this.

147
0:08:05.296,000 --> 0:08:09,000
What you see is the genes that got more methylated are red.

148
0:08:10.057,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The genes that got less methylated are green.

149
0:08:13.095,000 --> 0:08:15,000
You can see many genes are changing,

150
0:08:15.603,000 --> 0:08:17,000
because not having a mother is not just one thing --

151
0:08:18.341,000 --> 0:08:19,000
it affects the whole way;

152
0:08:19.896,000 --> 0:08:22,000
it sends signals about the whole way your world is going to look

153
0:08:23.428,000 --> 0:08:24,000
when you become an adult.

154
0:08:25.211,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And you can see the two groups of monkeys

155
0:08:27.656,000 --> 0:08:29,000
extremely well-separated from each other.

156
0:08:31.212,000 --> 0:08:33,000
How early does this develop?

157
0:08:33.898,000 --> 0:08:35,000
These monkeys already didn't see their mothers,

158
0:08:36.135,000 --> 0:08:37,000
so they had a social experience.

159
0:08:37.858,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Do we sense our social status, even at the moment of birth?

160
0:08:42.951,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So in this experiment, we took placentas of monkeys

161
0:08:47.024,000 --> 0:08:48,000
that had different social status.

162
0:08:49.518,000 --> 0:08:54,000
What's interesting about social rank is that across all living beings,

163
0:08:54.916,000 --> 0:08:56,000
they will structure themselves by hierarchy.

164
0:08:58.165,000 --> 0:09:,000
Monkey number one is the boss;

165
0:09:00.377,000 --> 0:09:02,000
monkey number four is the peon.

166
0:09:02.739,000 --> 0:09:04,000
You put four monkeys in a cage,

167
0:09:05.202,000 --> 0:09:08,000
there will always be a boss and always be a peon.

168
0:09:09.268,000 --> 0:09:12,000
And what's interesting is that the monkey number one

169
0:09:13.14,000 --> 0:09:16,000
is much healthier than monkey number four.

170
0:09:16.596,000 --> 0:09:17,000
And if you put them in a cage,

171
0:09:18.424,000 --> 0:09:22,000
monkey number one will not eat as much.

172
0:09:23.145,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Monkey number four will eat [a lot].

173
0:09:25.949,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And what you see here in this methylation mapping,

174
0:09:30.246,000 --> 0:09:32,000
a dramatic separation at birth

175
0:09:33.045,000 --> 0:09:35,000
of the animals that had a high social status

176
0:09:35.783,000 --> 0:09:37,000
versus the animals that did not have a high status.

177
0:09:39.169,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So we are born already knowing the social information,

178
0:09:43.424,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and that social information is not bad or good,

179
0:09:46.501,000 --> 0:09:47,000
it just prepares us for life,

180
0:09:47.944,000 --> 0:09:51,000
because we have to program our biology differently

181
0:09:52.209,000 --> 0:09:55,000
if we are in the high or the low social status.

182
0:09:56.146,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But how can you study this in humans?

183
0:09:58.53,000 --> 0:10:01,000
We can't do experiments, we can't administer adversity to humans.

184
0:10:02.002,000 --> 0:10:04,000
But God does experiments with humans,

185
0:10:04.619,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and it's called natural disasters.

186
0:10:06.931,000 --> 0:10:1,000
One of the hardest natural disasters in Canadian history

187
0:10:11.215,000 --> 0:10:13,000
happened in my province of Quebec.

188
0:10:13.649,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It's the ice storm of 1998.

189
0:10:16.076,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We lost our entire electrical grid because of an ice storm

190
0:10:19.9,000 --> 0:10:21,000
when the temperatures were, in the dead of winter in Quebec,

191
0:10:22.921,000 --> 0:10:23,000
minus 20 to minus 30.

192
0:10:24.894,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And there were pregnant mothers during that time.

193
0:10:27.902,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And my colleague Suzanne King followed the children of these mothers

194
0:10:33.958,000 --> 0:10:34,000
for 15 years.

195
0:10:36.385,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And what happened was, that as the stress increased --

196
0:10:40.655,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and here we had objective measures of stress:

197
0:10:43.287,000 --> 0:10:47,000
How long were you without power? Where did you spend your time?

198
0:10:47.749,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Was it in your mother-in-law's apartment or in some posh country home?

199
0:10:52.776,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So all of these added up to a social stress scale,

200
0:10:55.458,000 --> 0:10:56,000
and you can ask the question:

201
0:10:56.864,000 --> 0:10:59,000
How did the children look?

202
0:10:59.932,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And it appears that as stress increases,

203
0:11:02.59,000 --> 0:11:04,000
the children develop more autism,

204
0:11:04.672,000 --> 0:11:06,000
they develop more metabolic diseases

205
0:11:07.235,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and they develop more autoimmune diseases.

206
0:11:10.607,000 --> 0:11:12,000
We would map the methylation state,

207
0:11:13.055,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and again, you see the green genes becoming red as stress increases,

208
0:11:18.617,000 --> 0:11:21,000
the red genes becoming green as stress increases,

209
0:11:22.133,000 --> 0:11:26,000
an entire rearrangement of the genome in response to stress.

210
0:11:29.262,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So if we can program genes,

211
0:11:32.495,000 --> 0:11:35,000
if we are not just the slaves of the history of our genes,

212
0:11:36.492,000 --> 0:11:38,000
that they could be programmed, can we deprogram them?

213
0:11:39.913,000 --> 0:11:43,000
Because epigenetic causes can cause diseases like cancer,

214
0:11:45.479,000 --> 0:11:46,000
metabolic disease

215
0:11:47.306,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and mental health diseases.

216
0:11:49.94,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Let's talk about cocaine addiction.

217
0:11:53.395,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Cocaine addiction is a terrible situation

218
0:11:56.475,000 --> 0:11:59,000
that can lead to death and to loss of human life.

219
0:12:01.365,000 --> 0:12:02,000
We asked the question:

220
0:12:03.314,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Can we reprogram the addicted brain

221
0:12:06.577,000 --> 0:12:1,000
to make that animal not addicted anymore?

222
0:12:12.197,000 --> 0:12:16,000
We used a cocaine addiction model

223
0:12:16.501,000 --> 0:12:18,000
that recapitulates what happens in humans.

224
0:12:18.614,000 --> 0:12:2,000
In humans, you're in high school,

225
0:12:21.306,000 --> 0:12:23,000
some friends suggest you use some cocaine,

226
0:12:23.41,000 --> 0:12:24,000
you take cocaine, nothing happens.

227
0:12:25.24,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Months pass by, something reminds you of what happened the first time,

228
0:12:29.465,000 --> 0:12:3,000
a pusher pushes cocaine,

229
0:12:31.129,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and you become addicted and your life has changed.

230
0:12:33.985,000 --> 0:12:34,000
In rats, we do the same thing.

231
0:12:35.655,000 --> 0:12:36,000
My colleague, Gal Yadid,

232
0:12:37.254,000 --> 0:12:4,000
he trains the animals to get used to cocaine,

233
0:12:40.278,000 --> 0:12:43,000
then for one month, no cocaine.

234
0:12:43.43,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Then he reminds them of the party when they saw the cocaine the first time

235
0:12:47.13,000 --> 0:12:49,000
by cue, the colors of the cage when they saw cocaine.

236
0:12:49.97,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And they go crazy.

237
0:12:51.646,000 --> 0:12:53,000
They will press the lever to get cocaine

238
0:12:54.117,000 --> 0:12:55,000
until they die.

239
0:12:55.867,000 --> 0:12:59,000
We first determined that the difference between these animals

240
0:13:00.334,000 --> 0:13:02,000
is that during that time when nothing happens,

241
0:13:03.059,000 --> 0:13:04,000
there's no cocaine around,

242
0:13:04.855,000 --> 0:13:05,000
their epigenome is rearranged.

243
0:13:06.8,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Their genes are re-marked in a different way,

244
0:13:09.713,000 --> 0:13:12,000
and when the cue comes, their genome is ready

245
0:13:13.479,000 --> 0:13:15,000
to develop this addictive phenotype.

246
0:13:16.385,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So we treated these animals with drugs that either increase DNA methylation,

247
0:13:23.179,000 --> 0:13:25,000
which was the epigenetic marker to look at,

248
0:13:25.427,000 --> 0:13:28,000
or decrease epigenetic markings.

249
0:13:28.934,000 --> 0:13:31,000
And we found that if we increased methylation,

250
0:13:32.213,000 --> 0:13:33,000
these animals go even crazier.

251
0:13:34.12,000 --> 0:13:36,000
They become more craving for cocaine.

252
0:13:36.628,000 --> 0:13:39,000
But if we reduce the DNA methylation,

253
0:13:40.078,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the animals are not addicted anymore.

254
0:13:42.206,000 --> 0:13:43,000
We have reprogrammed them.

255
0:13:43.849,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And a fundamental difference between an epigenetic drug

256
0:13:47.179,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and any other drug

257
0:13:48.509,000 --> 0:13:5,000
is that with epigenetic drugs,

258
0:13:50.705,000 --> 0:13:54,000
we essentially remove the signs of experience,

259
0:13:54.861,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and once they're gone,

260
0:13:57.012,000 --> 0:14:,000
they will not come back unless you have the same experience.

261
0:14:00.057,000 --> 0:14:01,000
The animal now is reprogrammed.

262
0:14:01.735,000 --> 0:14:05,000
So when we visited the animals 30 days, 60 days later,

263
0:14:05.98,000 --> 0:14:07,000
which is in human terms many years of life,

264
0:14:08.923,000 --> 0:14:13,000
they were still not addicted -- by a single epigenetic treatment.

265
0:14:16.292,000 --> 0:14:19,000
So what did we learn about DNA?

266
0:14:19.587,000 --> 0:14:22,000
DNA is not just a sequence of letters;

267
0:14:22.736,000 --> 0:14:24,000
it's not just a script.

268
0:14:24.879,000 --> 0:14:26,000
DNA is a dynamic movie.

269
0:14:28.187,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Our experiences are being written into this movie, which is interactive.

270
0:14:33.122,000 --> 0:14:36,000
You're, like, watching a movie of your life, with the DNA,

271
0:14:36.699,000 --> 0:14:37,000
with your remote control.

272
0:14:38.505,000 --> 0:14:41,000
You can remove an actor and add an actor.

273
0:14:42.692,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And so you have, in spite of the deterministic nature of genetics,

274
0:14:48.611,000 --> 0:14:51,000
you have control of the way your genes look,

275
0:14:52.324,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and this has a tremendous optimistic message

276
0:14:55.618,000 --> 0:14:58,000
for the ability to now encounter some of the deadly diseases

277
0:14:59.15,000 --> 0:15:01,000
like cancer, mental health,

278
0:15:02.078,000 --> 0:15:04,000
with a new approach,

279
0:15:05.03,000 --> 0:15:07,000
looking at them as maladaptation.

280
0:15:07.588,000 --> 0:15:1,000
And if we can epigenetically intervene,

281
0:15:10.686,000 --> 0:15:13,000
[we can] reverse the movie by removing an actor

282
0:15:14.206,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and setting up a new narrative.

283
0:15:17.848,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So what I told you today is,

284
0:15:20.369,000 --> 0:15:25,000
our DNA is really combined of two components,

285
0:15:25.485,000 --> 0:15:26,000
two layers of information.

286
0:15:27.926,000 --> 0:15:3,000
One layer of information is old,

287
0:15:31.625,000 --> 0:15:34,000
evolved from millions of years of evolution.

288
0:15:35.154,000 --> 0:15:38,000
It is fixed and very hard to change.

289
0:15:39.231,000 --> 0:15:42,000
The other layer of information is the epigenetic layer,

290
0:15:43.105,000 --> 0:15:46,000
which is open and dynamic

291
0:15:47.024,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and sets up a narrative that is interactive,

292
0:15:51.64,000 --> 0:15:57,000
that allows us to control, to a large extent, our destiny,

293
0:15:59.515,000 --> 0:16:02,000
to help the destiny of our children

294
0:16:02.995,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and to hopefully conquer disease

295
0:16:07.174,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and serious health challenges

296
0:16:11.614,000 --> 0:16:14,000
that have plagued humankind for a long time.

297
0:16:15.249,000 --> 0:16:18,000
So even though we are determined

298
0:16:18.666,000 --> 0:16:19,000
by our genes,

299
0:16:20.445,000 --> 0:16:23,000
we have a degree of freedom

300
0:16:23.536,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that can set up our life to a life of responsibility.

301
0:16:27.693,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Thank you.

302
0:16:28.937,000 --> 0:16:32,000
(Applause)

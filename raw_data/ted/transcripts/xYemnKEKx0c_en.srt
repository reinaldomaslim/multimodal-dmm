2
0:00:16.207,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The story starts: I was at a friend's house,

3
0:00:19.602,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and she had on her shelf a copy of the DSM manual,

4
0:00:23.664,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which is the manual of mental disorders.

5
0:00:25.9,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It lists every known mental disorder.

6
0:00:29.194,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And it used to be, back in the '50s, a very slim pamphlet.

7
0:00:32.251,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And then it got bigger and bigger and bigger,

8
0:00:34.9,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and now it's 886 pages long.

9
0:00:38.006,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And it lists currently 374 mental disorders.

10
0:00:42.708,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So I was leafing through it,

11
0:00:44.116,000 --> 0:00:46,000
wondering if I had any mental disorders,

12
0:00:47.057,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and it turns out I've got 12.

13
0:00:48.742,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:49.917,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I've got generalized anxiety disorder,

15
0:00:52.639,000 --> 0:00:53,000
which is a given.

16
0:00:53.909,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I've got nightmare disorder,

17
0:00:55.949,000 --> 0:00:56,000
which is categorized

18
0:00:57.338,000 --> 0:01:01,000
if you have recurrent dreams of being pursued or declared a failure,

19
0:01:01.402,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and all my dreams involve people chasing me down the street

20
0:01:05.101,000 --> 0:01:06,000
going, "You're a failure!"

21
0:01:06.749,000 --> 0:01:07,000
(Laughter)

22
0:01:08.556,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I've got parent-child relational problems,

23
0:01:11.682,000 --> 0:01:12,000
which I blame my parents for.

24
0:01:13.651,000 --> 0:01:14,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:15.57,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I'm kidding. I'm not kidding.

26
0:01:17.952,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I'm kidding.

27
0:01:19.888,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And I've got malingering.

28
0:01:21.148,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And I think it's actually quite rare

29
0:01:22.908,000 --> 0:01:25,000
to have both malingering and generalized anxiety disorder,

30
0:01:25.948,000 --> 0:01:27,000
because malingering tends to make me feel very anxious.

31
0:01:28.683,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Anyway, I was looking through this book,

32
0:01:30.695,000 --> 0:01:32,000
wondering if I was much crazier than I thought I was,

33
0:01:33.32,000 --> 0:01:36,000
or maybe it's not a good idea to diagnose yourself with a mental disorder

34
0:01:36.877,000 --> 0:01:38,000
if you're not a trained professional,

35
0:01:39.027,000 --> 0:01:43,000
or maybe the psychiatry profession has a kind of strange desire

36
0:01:43.924,000 --> 0:01:47,000
to label what's essentially normal human behavior as a mental disorder.

37
0:01:48.314,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I didn't know which of these was true, but I thought it was kind of interesting,

38
0:01:52.116,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and I thought maybe I should meet a critic of psychiatry

39
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to get their view,

40
0:01:56.408,000 --> 0:01:59,000
which is how I ended up having lunch with the Scientologists.

41
0:01:59.77,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:01.03,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It was a man called Brian, who runs a crack team of Scientologists

43
0:02:05.552,000 --> 0:02:09,000
who are determined to destroy psychiatry wherever it lies.

44
0:02:09.844,000 --> 0:02:1,000
They're called the CCHR.

45
0:02:11.857,000 --> 0:02:13,000
And I said to him, "Can you prove to me

46
0:02:14.832,000 --> 0:02:17,000
that psychiatry is a pseudo-science that can't be trusted?"

47
0:02:18.912,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And he said, "Yes, we can prove it to you."

48
0:02:21.123,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And I said, "How?"

49
0:02:22.56,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And he said, "We're going to introduce you to Tony."

50
0:02:26.353,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And I said, "Who's Tony?"

51
0:02:28.234,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And he said, "Tony's in Broadmoor."

52
0:02:31.567,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Now, Broadmoor is Broadmoor Hospital.

53
0:02:33.901,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It used to be known as the Broadmoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane.

54
0:02:38.559,000 --> 0:02:4,000
It's where they send the serial killers,

55
0:02:41.019,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and the people who can't help themselves.

56
0:02:43.099,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And I said to Brian, "Well, what did Tony do?"

57
0:02:46.28,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And he said, "Hardly anything.

58
0:02:49.428,000 --> 0:02:51,000
He beat someone up or something,

59
0:02:52.39,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and he decided to fake madness to get out of a prison sentence.

60
0:02:57.509,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But he faked it too well, and now he's stuck in Broadmoor

61
0:03:02.046,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and nobody will believe he's sane.

62
0:03:04.531,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Do you want us to try and get you into Broadmoor to meet Tony?"

63
0:03:08.292,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So I said, "Yes, please."

64
0:03:10.646,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So I got the train to Broadmoor.

65
0:03:12.194,000 --> 0:03:16,000
I began to yawn uncontrollably around Kempton Park,

66
0:03:16.313,000 --> 0:03:18,000
which apparently is what dogs also do when anxious,

67
0:03:18.719,000 --> 0:03:2,000
they yawn uncontrollably.

68
0:03:20.996,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And we got to Broadmoor.

69
0:03:22.718,000 --> 0:03:26,000
And I got taken through gate after gate after gate after gate

70
0:03:27.195,000 --> 0:03:3,000
into the wellness center, which is where you get to meet the patients.

71
0:03:30.716,000 --> 0:03:33,000
It looks like a giant Hampton Inn.

72
0:03:34.178,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It's all peach and pine and calming colors.

73
0:03:38.113,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And the only bold colors are the reds of the panic buttons.

74
0:03:44.327,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And the patients started drifting in.

75
0:03:47.408,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And they were quite overweight and wearing sweatpants,

76
0:03:51.013,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and quite docile-looking.

77
0:03:52.696,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And Brian the Scientologist whispered to me,

78
0:03:55.459,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"They're medicated,"

79
0:03:57.393,000 --> 0:04:,000
which, to the Scientologists, is like the worst evil in the world,

80
0:04:00.636,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but I'm thinking it's probably a good idea.

81
0:04:03.241,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:05.356,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And then Brian said, "Here's Tony."

83
0:04:08.419,000 --> 0:04:09,000
And a man was walking in.

84
0:04:10.425,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And he wasn't overweight, he was in very good physical shape.

85
0:04:13.553,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And he wasn't wearing sweatpants,

86
0:04:15.88,000 --> 0:04:17,000
he was wearing a pinstripe suit.

87
0:04:18.294,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And he had his arm outstretched

88
0:04:20.314,000 --> 0:04:22,000
like someone out of The Apprentice.

89
0:04:22.398,000 --> 0:04:25,000
He looked like a man who wanted to wear an outfit

90
0:04:25.704,000 --> 0:04:28,000
that would convince me that he was very sane.

91
0:04:30.263,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And he sat down.

92
0:04:31.438,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And I said, "So is it true that you faked your way in here?"

93
0:04:34.763,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And he said, "Yep. Yep. Absolutely. I beat someone up when I was 17.

94
0:04:38.231,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And I was in prison awaiting trial,

95
0:04:40.337,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and my cellmate said to me,

96
0:04:41.676,000 --> 0:04:42,000
'You know what you have to do?

97
0:04:43.184,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Fake madness.

98
0:04:45.172,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Tell them you're mad, you'll get sent to some cushy hospital.

99
0:04:48.807,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Nurses will bring you pizzas, you'll have your own PlayStation.'"

100
0:04:52.662,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I said, "Well, how did you do it?"

101
0:04:54.378,000 --> 0:04:56,000
He said, "Well, I asked to see the prison psychiatrist.

102
0:04:57.145,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And I'd just seen a film called 'Crash,'

103
0:04:59.456,000 --> 0:05:03,000
in which people get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.

104
0:05:03.583,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So I said to the psychiatrist,

105
0:05:05.556,000 --> 0:05:08,000
'I get sexual pleasure from crashing cars into walls.'"

106
0:05:09.345,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And I said, "What else?"

107
0:05:10.794,000 --> 0:05:12,000
He said, "Oh, yeah. I told the psychiatrist

108
0:05:13.471,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that I wanted to watch women as they died,

109
0:05:16.779,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because it would make me feel more normal."

110
0:05:18.968,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I said, "Where'd you get that from?"

111
0:05:20.714,000 --> 0:05:22,000
He said, "Oh, from a biography of Ted Bundy that they had

112
0:05:23.522,000 --> 0:05:24,000
at the prison library."

113
0:05:25.749,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Anyway, he faked madness too well, he said.

114
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And they didn't send him to some cushy hospital.

115
0:05:31.494,000 --> 0:05:32,000
They sent him to Broadmoor.

116
0:05:33.799,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And the minute he got there,

117
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
said he took one look at the place, asked to see the psychiatrist,

118
0:05:38.29,000 --> 0:05:4,000
said, "There's been a terrible misunderstanding.

119
0:05:40.832,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I'm not mentally ill."

120
0:05:43.032,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I said, "How long have you been here for?"

121
0:05:45.322,000 --> 0:05:47,000
He said, "Well, if I'd just done my time in prison

122
0:05:47.692,000 --> 0:05:49,000
for the original crime, I'd have got five years.

123
0:05:50.832,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I've been in Broadmoor for 12 years."

124
0:05:56.171,000 --> 0:06:,000
Tony said that it's a lot harder to convince people you're sane

125
0:06:00.224,000 --> 0:06:02,000
than it is to convince them you're crazy.

126
0:06:02.732,000 --> 0:06:04,000
He said, "I thought the best way to seem normal

127
0:06:04.979,000 --> 0:06:06,000
would be to talk to people normally about normal things

128
0:06:07.623,000 --> 0:06:08,000
like football or what's on TV.

129
0:06:09.525,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I subscribe to New Scientist,

130
0:06:11.287,000 --> 0:06:12,000
and recently they had an article

131
0:06:12.978,000 --> 0:06:16,000
about how the U.S. Army was training bumblebees to sniff out explosives.

132
0:06:17.362,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So I said to a nurse,

133
0:06:18.805,000 --> 0:06:2,000
'Did you know that the U.S. Army is training bumblebees

134
0:06:21.428,000 --> 0:06:22,000
to sniff out explosives?'

135
0:06:23.847,000 --> 0:06:25,000
When I read my medical notes, I saw they'd written:

136
0:06:26.646,000 --> 0:06:29,000
'Believes bees can sniff out explosives.'"

137
0:06:29.682,000 --> 0:06:3,000
(Laughter)

138
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
He said, "You know, they're always looking out for nonverbal clues

139
0:06:34.391,000 --> 0:06:35,000
to my mental state.

140
0:06:36.155,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But how do you sit in a sane way?

141
0:06:38.816,000 --> 0:06:4,000
How do you cross your legs in a sane way?

142
0:06:41.112,000 --> 0:06:42,000
It's just impossible."

143
0:06:42.936,000 --> 0:06:43,000
When Tony said that to me,

144
0:06:44.217,000 --> 0:06:47,000
I thought to myself, "Am I sitting like a journalist?

145
0:06:48.107,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Am I crossing my legs like a journalist?"

146
0:06:51.332,000 --> 0:06:56,000
He said, "You know, I've got the Stockwell Strangler on one side of me,

147
0:06:56.428,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and I've got the 'Tiptoe Through the Tulips' rapist

148
0:06:58.841,000 --> 0:06:59,000
on the other side of me.

149
0:07:00.232,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So I tend to stay in my room a lot because I find them quite frightening.

150
0:07:03.705,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And they take that as a sign of madness.

151
0:07:05.99,000 --> 0:07:08,000
They say it proves that I'm aloof and grandiose."

152
0:07:09.953,000 --> 0:07:12,000
So, only in Broadmoor would not wanting to hang out with serial killers

153
0:07:13.773,000 --> 0:07:14,000
be a sign of madness.

154
0:07:15.384,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Anyway, he seemed completely normal to me, but what did I know?

155
0:07:19.174,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And when I got home I emailed his clinician, Anthony Maden.

156
0:07:22.018,000 --> 0:07:23,000
I said, "What's the story?"

157
0:07:23.616,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And he said, "Yep. We accept that Tony faked madness

158
0:07:27.151,000 --> 0:07:3,000
to get out of a prison sentence, because his hallucinations --

159
0:07:30.941,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that had seemed quite cliche to begin with --

160
0:07:33.116,000 --> 0:07:35,000
just vanished the minute he got to Broadmoor.

161
0:07:35.758,000 --> 0:07:37,000
However, we have assessed him,

162
0:07:37.987,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and we've determined that what he is

163
0:07:40.424,000 --> 0:07:41,000
is a psychopath."

164
0:07:42.243,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And in fact, faking madness

165
0:07:44.075,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is exactly the kind of cunning and manipulative act of a psychopath.

166
0:07:48.465,000 --> 0:07:5,000
It's on the checklist: cunning, manipulative.

167
0:07:51.41,000 --> 0:07:52,000
So, faking your brain going wrong

168
0:07:53.011,000 --> 0:07:56,000
is evidence that your brain has gone wrong.

169
0:07:56.267,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And I spoke to other experts,

170
0:07:57.863,000 --> 0:08:,000
and they said the pinstripe suit -- classic psychopath --

171
0:08:01.826,000 --> 0:08:03,000
speaks to items one and two on the checklist:

172
0:08:04.128,000 --> 0:08:07,000
glibness, superficial charm and grandiose sense of self-worth.

173
0:08:07.969,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And I said, "Well, but why didn't he hang out with the other patients?"

174
0:08:11.605,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Classic psychopath -- it speaks to grandiosity and also lack of empathy.

175
0:08:15.978,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So all the things that had seemed most normal about Tony

176
0:08:19.466,000 --> 0:08:22,000
was evidence, according to his clinician,

177
0:08:22.515,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that he was mad in this new way.

178
0:08:24.69,000 --> 0:08:25,000
He was a psychopath.

179
0:08:26.117,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And his clinician said to me, "If you want to know more about psychopaths,

180
0:08:29.666,000 --> 0:08:32,000
you can go on a psychopath-spotting course

181
0:08:32.895,000 --> 0:08:34,000
run by Robert Hare, who invented the psychopath checklist."

182
0:08:35.806,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So I did.

183
0:08:36.99,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I went on a psychopath-spotting course,

184
0:08:39.057,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and I am now a certified --

185
0:08:43.258,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and I have to say, extremely adept -- psychopath spotter.

186
0:08:48.194,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So, here's the statistics:

187
0:08:51.463,000 --> 0:08:55,000
One in a hundred regular people is a psychopath.

188
0:08:56.255,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So there's 1,500 people in his room.

189
0:09:00.112,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Fifteen of you are psychopaths.

190
0:09:05.091,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Although that figure rises to four percent of CEOs and business leaders,

191
0:09:10.097,000 --> 0:09:12,000
so I think there's a very good chance

192
0:09:12.856,000 --> 0:09:17,000
there's about 30 or 40 psychopaths in this room.

193
0:09:17.994,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It could be carnage by the end of the night.

194
0:09:20.452,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Laughter)

195
0:09:24.932,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Hare said the reason why is because capitalism at its most ruthless

196
0:09:29.852,000 --> 0:09:31,000
rewards psychopathic behavior --

197
0:09:32.52,000 --> 0:09:36,000
the lack of empathy, the glibness,

198
0:09:37.481,000 --> 0:09:39,000
cunning, manipulative.

199
0:09:39.863,000 --> 0:09:41,000
In fact, capitalism, perhaps at its most remorseless,

200
0:09:42.852,000 --> 0:09:45,000
is a physical manifestation of psychopathy.

201
0:09:47.377,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's like a form of psychopathy that's come down to affect us all.

202
0:09:52.567,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Hare said, "You know what? Forget about some guy at Broadmoor

203
0:09:55.462,000 --> 0:09:56,000
who may or may not have faked madness.

204
0:09:57.301,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Who cares? That's not a big story.

205
0:09:58.946,000 --> 0:10:,000
The big story," he said, "is corporate psychopathy.

206
0:10:01.863,000 --> 0:10:04,000
You want to go and interview yourself some corporate psychopaths."

207
0:10:06.216,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So I gave it a try. I wrote to the Enron people.

208
0:10:09.423,000 --> 0:10:11,000
I said, "Could I come and interview you in prison,

209
0:10:11.793,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to find out it you're psychopaths?"

210
0:10:13.587,000 --> 0:10:14,000
(Laughter)

211
0:10:14.841,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And they didn't reply.

212
0:10:16.141,000 --> 0:10:17,000
(Laughter)

213
0:10:17.715,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So I changed tack.

214
0:10:19.636,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I emailed "Chainsaw Al" Dunlap,

215
0:10:22.936,000 --> 0:10:25,000
the asset stripper from the 1990s.

216
0:10:26.499,000 --> 0:10:28,000
He would come into failing businesses

217
0:10:28.73,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and close down 30 percent of the workforce,

218
0:10:30.789,000 --> 0:10:33,000
just turn American towns into ghost towns.

219
0:10:33.957,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And I emailed him and I said,

220
0:10:35.434,000 --> 0:10:37,000
"I believe you may have a very special brain anomaly

221
0:10:38.252,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that makes you ... special,

222
0:10:40.287,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and interested in the predatory spirit, and fearless.

223
0:10:44.672,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Can I come and interview you about your special brain anomaly?"

224
0:10:48.148,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And he said, "Come on over!"

225
0:10:49.99,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Laughter)

226
0:10:51.375,000 --> 0:10:54,000
So I went to Al Dunlap's grand Florida mansion.

227
0:10:54.451,000 --> 0:10:58,000
It was filled with sculptures of predatory animals.

228
0:10:59.522,000 --> 0:11:02,000
There were lions and tigers -- he was taking me through the garden --

229
0:11:03.185,000 --> 0:11:05,000
there were falcons and eagles,

230
0:11:05.901,000 --> 0:11:07,000
he was saying, "Over there you've got sharks and --"

231
0:11:08.429,000 --> 0:11:1,000
he was saying this in a less effeminate way --

232
0:11:10.666,000 --> 0:11:14,000
"You've got more sharks and you've got tigers."

233
0:11:16.366,000 --> 0:11:17,000
It was like Narnia.

234
0:11:18.09,000 --> 0:11:21,000
(Laughter)

235
0:11:21.592,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And then we went into his kitchen.

236
0:11:24.032,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Now, Al Dunlap would be brought in to save failing companies,

237
0:11:28.208,000 --> 0:11:3,000
he'd close down 30 percent of the workforce.

238
0:11:30.655,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And he'd quite often fire people with a joke.

239
0:11:33.858,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Like, for instance, one famous story about him,

240
0:11:36.227,000 --> 0:11:39,000
somebody came up to him and said, "I've just bought myself a new car."

241
0:11:39.703,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And he said, "Well, you may have a new car,

242
0:11:41.735,000 --> 0:11:44,000
but I'll tell you what you don't have -- a job."

243
0:11:46.802,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So in his kitchen --

244
0:11:47.982,000 --> 0:11:49,000
he was in there with his wife, Judy, and his bodyguard, Sean --

245
0:11:50.964,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and I said, "You know how I said in my email

246
0:11:53.044,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that you might have a special brain anomaly that makes you special?"

247
0:11:56.704,000 --> 0:11:58,000
He said, "Yeah, it's an amazing theory, it's like Star Trek.

248
0:11:59.63,000 --> 0:12:01,000
You're going where no man has gone before."

249
0:12:01.866,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And I said, "Well --" (Clears throat)

250
0:12:04.994,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Laughter)

251
0:12:06.347,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Some psychologists might say

252
0:12:09.534,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that this makes you --" (Mumbles)

253
0:12:12.236,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Laughter)

254
0:12:13.887,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And he said, "What?"

255
0:12:16.101,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And I said, "A psychopath."

256
0:12:17.429,000 --> 0:12:21,000
And I said, "I've got a list of psychopathic traits in my pocket.

257
0:12:21.832,000 --> 0:12:23,000
Can I go through them with you?"

258
0:12:24.653,000 --> 0:12:26,000
And he looked intrigued despite himself,

259
0:12:26.77,000 --> 0:12:27,000
and he said, "Okay, go on."

260
0:12:28.169,000 --> 0:12:31,000
And I said, "Okay. Grandiose sense of self-worth."

261
0:12:31.576,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Which I have to say, would have been hard for him to deny,

262
0:12:34.376,000 --> 0:12:37,000
because he was standing under a giant oil painting of himself.

263
0:12:37.784,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Laughter)

264
0:12:41.959,000 --> 0:12:44,000
He said, "Well, you've got to believe in you!"

265
0:12:45.016,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And I said, "Manipulative."

266
0:12:47.928,000 --> 0:12:48,000
He said, "That's leadership."

267
0:12:49.645,000 --> 0:12:5,000
(Laughter)

268
0:12:50.67,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And I said, "Shallow affect,

269
0:12:53.1,000 --> 0:12:55,000
an inability to experience a range of emotions."

270
0:12:55.396,000 --> 0:12:58,000
He said, "Who wants to be weighed down by some nonsense emotions?"

271
0:12:59.026,000 --> 0:13:01,000
So he was going down the psychopath checklist,

272
0:13:01.221,000 --> 0:13:04,000
basically turning it into "Who Moved My Cheese?"

273
0:13:04.446,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Laughter)

274
0:13:07.562,000 --> 0:13:1,000
But I did notice something happening to me the day I was with Al Dunlap.

275
0:13:11.006,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Whenever he said anything to me that was kind of normal --

276
0:13:13.927,000 --> 0:13:15,000
like he said "no" to juvenile delinquency,

277
0:13:16.894,000 --> 0:13:17,000
he said he got accepted into West Point,

278
0:13:18.824,000 --> 0:13:2,000
and they don't let delinquents in West Point.

279
0:13:21.703,000 --> 0:13:23,000
He said "no" to many short-term marital relationships.

280
0:13:24.443,000 --> 0:13:25,000
He's only ever been married twice.

281
0:13:26.127,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Admittedly, his first wife cited in her divorce papers

282
0:13:29.098,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that he once threatened her with a knife

283
0:13:31.562,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and said he always wondered what human flesh tasted like,

284
0:13:34.303,000 --> 0:13:36,000
but people say stupid things to each other

285
0:13:36.369,000 --> 0:13:38,000
in bad marriages in the heat of an argument,

286
0:13:38.448,000 --> 0:13:41,000
and his second marriage has lasted 41 years.

287
0:13:41.493,000 --> 0:13:44,000
So whenever he said anything to me that just seemed kind of non-psychopathic,

288
0:13:45.215,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I thought to myself, well I'm not going to put that in my book.

289
0:13:48.868,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And then I realized that becoming a psychopath spotter

290
0:13:52.196,000 --> 0:13:55,000
had kind of turned me a little bit psychopathic.

291
0:13:55.696,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Because I was desperate to shove him in a box marked "Psychopath."

292
0:14:00.664,000 --> 0:14:04,000
I was desperate to define him by his maddest edges.

293
0:14:05.398,000 --> 0:14:06,000
And I realized, my God --

294
0:14:06.624,000 --> 0:14:08,000
this is what I've been doing for 20 years.

295
0:14:08.651,000 --> 0:14:09,000
It's what all journalists do.

296
0:14:10.297,000 --> 0:14:13,000
We travel across the world with our notepads in our hands,

297
0:14:13.781,000 --> 0:14:14,000
and we wait for the gems.

298
0:14:16.242,000 --> 0:14:2,000
And the gems are always the outermost aspects

299
0:14:20.599,000 --> 0:14:21,000
of our interviewee's personality.

300
0:14:22.252,000 --> 0:14:25,000
And we stitch them together like medieval monks,

301
0:14:25.75,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and we leave the normal stuff on the floor.

302
0:14:30.187,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And you know, this is a country that over-diagnoses

303
0:14:33.23,000 --> 0:14:36,000
certain mental disorders hugely.

304
0:14:36.531,000 --> 0:14:37,000
Childhood bipolar --

305
0:14:37.897,000 --> 0:14:4,000
children as young as four are being labeled bipolar

306
0:14:41.476,000 --> 0:14:43,000
because they have temper tantrums,

307
0:14:43.93,000 --> 0:14:46,000
which scores them high on the bipolar checklist.

308
0:14:48.533,000 --> 0:14:5,000
When I got back to London, Tony phoned me.

309
0:14:52.697,000 --> 0:14:54,000
He said, "Why haven't you been returning my calls?"

310
0:14:55.494,000 --> 0:14:58,000
I said, "Well, they say that you're a psychopath."

311
0:14:58.867,000 --> 0:14:59,000
And he said, "I'm not a psychopath."

312
0:15:00.845,000 --> 0:15:01,000
He said, "You know what?

313
0:15:02.028,000 --> 0:15:04,000
One of the items on the checklist is lack of remorse,

314
0:15:04.724,000 --> 0:15:06,000
but another item on the checklist is cunning, manipulative.

315
0:15:07.609,000 --> 0:15:09,000
So when you say you feel remorse for your crime,

316
0:15:09.999,000 --> 0:15:1,000
they say, 'Typical of the psychopath

317
0:15:11.763,000 --> 0:15:14,000
to cunningly say he feels remorse when he doesn't.'

318
0:15:15.164,000 --> 0:15:18,000
It's like witchcraft, they turn everything upside-down."

319
0:15:19.581,000 --> 0:15:21,000
He said, "I've got a tribunal coming up.

320
0:15:21.84,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Will you come to it?"

321
0:15:24,000 --> 0:15:25,000
So I said okay.

322
0:15:25.783,000 --> 0:15:26,000
So I went to his tribunal.

323
0:15:28.195,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And after 14 years in Broadmoor, they let him go.

324
0:15:33.101,000 --> 0:15:35,000
They decided that he shouldn't be held indefinitely

325
0:15:35.93,000 --> 0:15:38,000
because he scores high on a checklist that might mean

326
0:15:39.644,000 --> 0:15:43,000
that he would have a greater than average chance of recidivism.

327
0:15:44.9,000 --> 0:15:45,000
So they let him go.

328
0:15:46.414,000 --> 0:15:48,000
And outside in the corridor he said to me,

329
0:15:48.459,000 --> 0:15:49,000
"You know what, Jon?

330
0:15:50.101,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Everyone's a bit psychopathic."

331
0:15:52.88,000 --> 0:15:55,000
He said, "You are, I am. Well, obviously I am."

332
0:15:57.276,000 --> 0:15:59,000
I said, "What are you going to do now?"

333
0:15:59.312,000 --> 0:16:01,000
He said, "I'm going to go to Belgium.

334
0:16:01.519,000 --> 0:16:02,000
There's a woman there that I fancy.

335
0:16:03.221,000 --> 0:16:06,000
But she's married, so I'm going to have to get her split up from her husband."

336
0:16:07.2,000 --> 0:16:1,000
(Laughter)

337
0:16:11.335,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Anyway, that was two years ago,

338
0:16:14.392,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and that's where my book ended.

339
0:16:15.994,000 --> 0:16:19,000
And for the last 20 months, everything was fine.

340
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Nothing bad happened.

341
0:16:22.645,000 --> 0:16:24,000
He was living with a girl outside London.

342
0:16:24.808,000 --> 0:16:26,000
He was, according to Brian the Scientologist,

343
0:16:26.93,000 --> 0:16:29,000
making up for lost time, which I know sounds ominous,

344
0:16:29.98,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but isn't necessarily ominous.

345
0:16:32.222,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Unfortunately, after 20 months,

346
0:16:34.143,000 --> 0:16:36,000
he did go back to jail for a month.

347
0:16:36.877,000 --> 0:16:4,000
He got into a "fracas" in a bar, he called it.

348
0:16:41.364,000 --> 0:16:43,000
Ended up going to jail for a month, which I know is bad,

349
0:16:44.029,000 --> 0:16:47,000
but at least a month implies that whatever the fracas was,

350
0:16:47.941,000 --> 0:16:48,000
it wasn't too bad.

351
0:16:50.329,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And then he phoned me.

352
0:16:53.062,000 --> 0:16:57,000
And you know what, I think it's right that Tony is out.

353
0:16:58.158,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Because you shouldn't define people by their maddest edges.

354
0:17:01.337,000 --> 0:17:04,000
And what Tony is, is he's a semi-psychopath.

355
0:17:05.592,000 --> 0:17:09,000
He's a gray area in a world that doesn't like gray areas.

356
0:17:11.056,000 --> 0:17:14,000
But the gray areas are where you find the complexity.

357
0:17:16.052,000 --> 0:17:18,000
It's where you find the humanity,

358
0:17:18.497,000 --> 0:17:19,000
and it's where you find the truth.

359
0:17:21.381,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And Tony said to me,

360
0:17:23.513,000 --> 0:17:26,000
"Jon, could I buy you a drink in a bar?

361
0:17:27.409,000 --> 0:17:3,000
I just want to thank you for everything you've done for me."

362
0:17:30.733,000 --> 0:17:31,000
And I didn't go.

363
0:17:32.934,000 --> 0:17:33,000
What would you have done?

364
0:17:35.761,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Thank you.

365
0:17:37.137,000 --> 0:17:43,000
(Applause)

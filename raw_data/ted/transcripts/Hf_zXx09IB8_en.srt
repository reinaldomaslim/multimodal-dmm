1
0:00:13.098,000 --> 0:00:14,000
"Look at me!"

2
0:00:16.496,000 --> 0:00:2,000
That phrase turned me into an eye-contact coach.

3
0:00:22.615,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm the mother of Ivan; he's 15 years old.

4
0:00:26.339,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Ivan has autism,

5
0:00:28.307,000 --> 0:00:29,000
he doesn't speak,

6
0:00:29.876,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and he communicates through an iPad,

7
0:00:31.89,000 --> 0:00:34,000
where his whole universe of words exists in images.

8
0:00:37.767,000 --> 0:00:41,000
He was diagnosed when he was two and a half.

9
0:00:43.527,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I still remember that day painfully.

10
0:00:49.299,000 --> 0:00:51,000
My husband and I felt really lost;

11
0:00:53.309,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we didn't know where to begin.

12
0:00:56.76,000 --> 0:00:58,000
There was no internet,

13
0:00:59.209,000 --> 0:01:01,000
you couldn't Google information,

14
0:01:02.525,000 --> 0:01:03,000
so we made those first steps

15
0:01:05.439,000 --> 0:01:07,000
out of sheer intuition.

16
0:01:09.669,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Ivan would not maintain eye contact,

17
0:01:12.831,000 --> 0:01:14,000
he had lost the words that he did know,

18
0:01:16.104,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and he didn't respond to his name or to anything we asked him,

19
0:01:20.889,000 --> 0:01:22,000
as if words were noise.

20
0:01:25.287,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The only way I could know

21
0:01:29.837,000 --> 0:01:3,000
what was going on with him,

22
0:01:32.123,000 --> 0:01:33,000
what he felt,

23
0:01:34.157,000 --> 0:01:35,000
was looking him in the eye.

24
0:01:37.629,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But that bridge was broken.

25
0:01:42.441,000 --> 0:01:44,000
How could I teach him about life?

26
0:01:47.339,000 --> 0:01:5,000
When I did things he liked, he would look at me,

27
0:01:51.271,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and we were connected.

28
0:01:53.705,000 --> 0:01:56,000
So I dedicated myself to working with him on those things,

29
0:01:57.297,000 --> 0:02:01,000
so we would have more and more eye-contact moments.

30
0:02:03.11,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We would spend hours and hours playing tag with his older sister, Alexia,

31
0:02:10.322,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and when we said: "I caught you!"

32
0:02:14.006,000 --> 0:02:15,000
he would look around for us,

33
0:02:16.79,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and at that moment, I could feel he was alive.

34
0:02:24.908,000 --> 0:02:28,000
We also hold a record for hours spent in a swimming pool.

35
0:02:31.002,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Ivan always had a passion for water.

36
0:02:35.654,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I remember when he was two and a half,

37
0:02:39.581,000 --> 0:02:42,000
on a rainy winter day,

38
0:02:42.905,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I was taking him to an indoor pool,

39
0:02:45.405,000 --> 0:02:47,000
because even on rainy days we'd go swimming.

40
0:02:49.643,000 --> 0:02:52,000
We were on the highway, and I took the wrong exit.

41
0:02:54.115,000 --> 0:02:57,000
He burst into tears and cried inconsolably, nonstop,

42
0:02:58.081,000 --> 0:02:59,000
until I turned back.

43
0:03:00.356,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Only then did he calm down.

44
0:03:03.348,000 --> 0:03:06,000
How was it possible that a two and a half year old

45
0:03:07.068,000 --> 0:03:08,000
didn't respond to his own name,

46
0:03:09.671,000 --> 0:03:13,000
yet in the middle of the rain and fog, where I couldn't see anything,

47
0:03:13.819,000 --> 0:03:17,000
he knew the exact route?

48
0:03:20.886,000 --> 0:03:23,000
That's when I realized that Ivan had an exceptional visual memory,

49
0:03:25.362,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and that that would be my way in.

50
0:03:29.647,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So I started taking pictures of everything,

51
0:03:32.688,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and teaching him what life was like,

52
0:03:34.858,000 --> 0:03:37,000
showing it to him, picture by picture.

53
0:03:39.578,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Even now, it's the way Ivan communicates

54
0:03:44.3,000 --> 0:03:45,000
what he wants,

55
0:03:46.131,000 --> 0:03:47,000
what he needs

56
0:03:48.212,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and also what he feels.

57
0:03:53.843,000 --> 0:03:56,000
But it wasn't just Ivan's eye contact that mattered.

58
0:03:58.752,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Everyone else's did, too.

59
0:04:02.555,000 --> 0:04:05,000
How could I make people see not only his autism,

60
0:04:06.569,000 --> 0:04:07,000
but see him the person

61
0:04:09.132,000 --> 0:04:1,000
and everything he can give;

62
0:04:12.136,000 --> 0:04:13,000
everything he can do;

63
0:04:15.207,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the things he likes and doesn't like,

64
0:04:17.869,000 --> 0:04:18,000
just like any one of us?

65
0:04:21.131,000 --> 0:04:24,000
But for that, I also had to give of myself.

66
0:04:25.614,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I had to have the strength to let him go,

67
0:04:28.716,000 --> 0:04:3,000
which was extremely difficult.

68
0:04:33.117,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Ivan was 11 years old,

69
0:04:35.575,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and he went for treatment in a neighborhood near our house.

70
0:04:40.613,000 --> 0:04:43,000
One afternoon, while I was waiting for him,

71
0:04:44.683,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I went into a greengrocer,

72
0:04:46.043,000 --> 0:04:49,000
a typical neighborhood store with a little bit of everything.

73
0:04:50.248,000 --> 0:04:51,000
While doing the shopping,

74
0:04:51.824,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I started talking to Jose, the owner.

75
0:04:56.762,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I told him about Ivan,

76
0:04:58.877,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that he had autism,

77
0:05:01.257,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and that I wanted him to learn to walk down the street by himself,

78
0:05:05.549,000 --> 0:05:07,000
without anyone holding his hand.

79
0:05:08.695,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So I decided to ask Jose if Thursdays around 2pm,

80
0:05:13.329,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Ivan could come and help him arrange the water bottles on the shelves,

81
0:05:17.102,000 --> 0:05:19,000
because he loved to organize things.

82
0:05:19.441,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And as a reward, he could buy some chocolate cookies,

83
0:05:23.231,000 --> 0:05:24,000
which were his favorite.

84
0:05:27.663,000 --> 0:05:28,000
He said "yes" right away.

85
0:05:30.635,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So that's how it went for a year:

86
0:05:33.901,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Ivan would go to Jose's greengrocer,

87
0:05:37.132,000 --> 0:05:4,000
help him arrange the shelves of water bottles

88
0:05:40.6,000 --> 0:05:45,000
with the labels perfectly lined up on the same side,

89
0:05:45.887,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and he would leave happy with his chocolate cookies.

90
0:05:55.874,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Jose is not an expert in autism.

91
0:06:01.111,000 --> 0:06:03,000
There is no need to be an expert

92
0:06:05.032,000 --> 0:06:08,000
nor do anything heroic to include someone.

93
0:06:11.904,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We just need to be there --

94
0:06:14.335,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Applause)

95
0:06:22.762,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Applause ends)

96
0:06:25.557,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Really, no heroic deed --

97
0:06:28.797,000 --> 0:06:3,000
we simply need to be close.

98
0:06:33.768,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And if we are afraid of something

99
0:06:36.331,000 --> 0:06:38,000
or we don't understand something,

100
0:06:38.539,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we need to ask.

101
0:06:41.002,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Let's be curious

102
0:06:44.182,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but never indifferent.

103
0:06:50.037,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Let's have the courage to look each other in the eye,

104
0:06:56.206,000 --> 0:06:58,000
because by looking,

105
0:06:58.332,000 --> 0:07:01,000
we can open a whole world to someone else.

106
0:07:02.962,000 --> 0:07:04,000
(Applause)

107
0:07:05.384,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Cheers)

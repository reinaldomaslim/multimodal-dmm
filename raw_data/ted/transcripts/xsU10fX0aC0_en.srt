Translator: Leslie Gauthier Reviewer: Camille Martínez

2
0:00:12.55,000 --> 0:00:13,000
For the past few years,

3
0:00:14.04,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I've been spending my summers in the marine biological laboratory

4
0:00:18.393,000 --> 0:00:19,000
in Woods Hole, Massachusetts.

5
0:00:20.931,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And there, what I've been doing is essentially renting a boat.

6
0:00:25.117,000 --> 0:00:27,000
What I would like to do is ask you

7
0:00:27.741,000 --> 0:00:29,000
to come on a boat ride with me tonight.

8
0:00:31.836,000 --> 0:00:35,000
So, we ride off from Eel Pond into Vineyard Sound,

9
0:00:36.753,000 --> 0:00:38,000
right off the coast of Martha's Vineyard,

10
0:00:39.288,000 --> 0:00:42,000
equipped with a drone to identify potential spots

11
0:00:42.649,000 --> 0:00:44,000
from which to peer into the Atlantic.

12
0:00:45.15,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Earlier, I was going to say into the depths of the Atlantic,

13
0:00:48.453,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but we don't have to go too deep to reach the unknown.

14
0:00:52.311,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Here, barely two miles away

15
0:00:54.906,000 --> 0:00:58,000
from what is arguably the greatest marine biology lab in the world,

16
0:00:59.476,000 --> 0:01:02,000
we lower a simple plankton net into the water

17
0:01:02.721,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and bring up to the surface

18
0:01:04.566,000 --> 0:01:07,000
things that humanity rarely pays any attention to,

19
0:01:07.99,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and oftentimes has never seen before.

20
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Here's one of the organisms that we caught in our net.

21
0:01:14.228,000 --> 0:01:15,000
This is a jellyfish.

22
0:01:15.881,000 --> 0:01:16,000
But look closely,

23
0:01:17.217,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and living inside of this animal is another organism

24
0:01:20.232,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that is very likely entirely new to science.

25
0:01:22.961,000 --> 0:01:23,000
A complete new species.

26
0:01:25.117,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Or how about this other transparent beauty

27
0:01:27.844,000 --> 0:01:28,000
with a beating heart,

28
0:01:29.408,000 --> 0:01:32,000
asexually growing on top of its head,

29
0:01:32.86,000 --> 0:01:35,000
progeny that will move on to reproduce sexually.

30
0:01:36.547,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Let me say that again:

31
0:01:38.058,000 --> 0:01:41,000
this animal is growing asexually on top of its head,

32
0:01:41.768,000 --> 0:01:45,000
progeny that is going to reproduce sexually in the next generation.

33
0:01:46.96,000 --> 0:01:47,000
A weird jellyfish?

34
0:01:48.796,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Not quite.

35
0:01:50.13,000 --> 0:01:51,000
This is an ascidian.

36
0:01:51.772,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This is a group of animals

37
0:01:53.08,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that now we know we share extensive genomic ancestry with,

38
0:01:56.851,000 --> 0:02:,000
and it is perhaps the closest invertebrate species to our own.

39
0:02:02.376,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Meet your cousin,

40
0:02:03.769,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Thalia democratica.

41
0:02:05.223,000 --> 0:02:06,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:07.205,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I'm pretty sure you didn't save a spot at your last family reunion

43
0:02:11.219,000 --> 0:02:12,000
for Thalia,

44
0:02:12.675,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but let me tell you,

45
0:02:14.351,000 --> 0:02:17,000
these animals are profoundly related to us

46
0:02:17.703,000 --> 0:02:2,000
in ways that we're just beginning to understand.

47
0:02:22.164,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So, next time you hear anybody derisively telling you

48
0:02:26.313,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that this type of research is a simple fishing expedition,

49
0:02:30.234,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I hope that you'll remember the trip that we just took.

50
0:02:33.675,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Today, many of the biological sciences only see value

51
0:02:37.539,000 --> 0:02:39,000
in studying deeper what we already know --

52
0:02:40.112,000 --> 0:02:42,000
in mapping already-discovered continents.

53
0:02:43.099,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But some of us are much more interested in the unknown.

54
0:02:46.849,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We want to discover completely new continents,

55
0:02:50.817,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and gaze at magnificent vistas of ignorance.

56
0:02:54.674,000 --> 0:02:58,000
We crave the experience of being completely baffled

57
0:02:58.794,000 --> 0:03:,000
by something we've never seen before.

58
0:03:00.992,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And yes, I agree

59
0:03:02.286,000 --> 0:03:05,000
there's a lot of little ego satisfaction in being able to say,

60
0:03:06.11,000 --> 0:03:08,000
"Hey, I was the first one to discover that."

61
0:03:09.102,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But this is not a self-aggrandizing enterprise,

62
0:03:12.031,000 --> 0:03:14,000
because in this type of discovery research,

63
0:03:14.755,000 --> 0:03:17,000
if you don't feel like a complete idiot most of the time,

64
0:03:18.397,000 --> 0:03:2,000
you're just not sciencing hard enough.

65
0:03:20.702,000 --> 0:03:22,000
(Laughter)

66
0:03:24.014,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So every summer I bring onto the deck of this little boat of ours

67
0:03:30.021,000 --> 0:03:33,000
more and more things that we know very little about.

68
0:03:34.816,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I would like tonight to tell you a story about life

69
0:03:38.328,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that rarely gets told in an environment like this.

70
0:03:42.915,000 --> 0:03:47,000
From the vantage point of our 21st-century biological laboratories,

71
0:03:48.274,000 --> 0:03:51,000
we have begun to illuminate many mysteries of life with knowledge.

72
0:03:52.869,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We sense that after centuries of scientific research,

73
0:03:56.53,000 --> 0:03:58,000
we're beginning to make significant inroads

74
0:03:58.661,000 --> 0:04:01,000
into understanding some of the most fundamental principles of life.

75
0:04:03.223,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Our collective optimism is reflected by the growth of biotechnology

76
0:04:08.248,000 --> 0:04:09,000
across the globe,

77
0:04:10.326,000 --> 0:04:14,000
striving to utilize scientific knowledge to cure human diseases.

78
0:04:15.685,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Things like cancer, aging, degenerative diseases;

79
0:04:20.547,000 --> 0:04:24,000
these are but some of the undesirables we wish to tame.

80
0:04:25.817,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I often wonder:

81
0:04:27.285,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Why is it that we are having so much trouble

82
0:04:30.47,000 --> 0:04:32,000
trying to solve the problem of cancer?

83
0:04:33.096,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Is it that we're trying to solve the problem of cancer,

84
0:04:36.374,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and not trying to understand life?

85
0:04:39.657,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Life on this planet shares a common origin,

86
0:04:42.869,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and I can summarize 3.5 billion years of the history of life on this planet

87
0:04:47.946,000 --> 0:04:48,000
in a single slide.

88
0:04:49.45,000 --> 0:04:52,000
What you see here are representatives of all known species in our planet.

89
0:04:53.321,000 --> 0:04:56,000
In this immensity of life and biodiversity,

90
0:04:56.756,000 --> 0:04:59,000
we occupy a rather unremarkable position.

91
0:04:59.947,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

92
0:05:00.987,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Homo sapiens.

93
0:05:03.016,000 --> 0:05:04,000
The last of our kind.

94
0:05:05.57,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And though I don't really want to disparage at all

95
0:05:08.705,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the accomplishments of our species,

96
0:05:10.7,000 --> 0:05:14,000
as much as we wish it to be so and often pretend that it is,

97
0:05:15.71,000 --> 0:05:17,000
we are not the measure of all things.

98
0:05:19.311,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We are, however, the measurers of many things.

99
0:05:23.311,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We relentlessly quantify, analyze and compare,

100
0:05:27.081,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and some of this is absolutely invaluable and indeed necessary.

101
0:05:31.661,000 --> 0:05:37,000
But this emphasis today on forcing biological research to specialize

102
0:05:38.072,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and to produce practical outcomes

103
0:05:40.644,000 --> 0:05:43,000
is actually restricting our ability to interrogate life

104
0:05:44.222,000 --> 0:05:48,000
to unacceptably narrow confines and unsatisfying depths.

105
0:05:49.007,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We are measuring an astonishingly narrow sliver of life,

106
0:05:54.072,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and hoping that those numbers will save all of our lives.

107
0:05:58.425,000 --> 0:05:59,000
How narrow do you ask?

108
0:05:59.842,000 --> 0:06:,000
Well, let me give you a number.

109
0:06:01.47,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration recently estimated

110
0:06:06.013,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that about 95 percent of our oceans remain unexplored.

111
0:06:10.674,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Now let that sink in for a second.

112
0:06:13.03,000 --> 0:06:16,000
95 percent of our oceans remain unexplored.

113
0:06:17.712,000 --> 0:06:19,000
I think it's very safe to say

114
0:06:19.901,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that we don't even know how much about life we do not know.

115
0:06:25.81,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So, it's not surprising that every week in my field

116
0:06:28.759,000 --> 0:06:31,000
we begin to see the addition of more and more new species

117
0:06:31.994,000 --> 0:06:33,000
to this amazing tree of life.

118
0:06:34.277,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This one for example --

119
0:06:35.698,000 --> 0:06:36,000
discovered earlier this summer,

120
0:06:37.628,000 --> 0:06:38,000
new to science,

121
0:06:38.865,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and now occupying its lonely branch in our family tree.

122
0:06:42.973,000 --> 0:06:43,000
What is even more tragic

123
0:06:44.148,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is that we know about a bunch of other species of animals out there,

124
0:06:47.807,000 --> 0:06:5,000
but their biology remains sorely under-studied.

125
0:06:51.392,000 --> 0:06:53,000
I'm sure some of you have heard about the fact

126
0:06:53.75,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that a starfish can actually regenerate its arm after it's lost.

127
0:06:57.97,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But some of you might not know

128
0:06:59.436,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that the arm itself can actually regenerate a complete starfish.

129
0:07:04.759,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And there are animals out there that do truly astounding things.

130
0:07:09.461,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I'm almost willing to bet

131
0:07:11.195,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that many of you have never heard of the flatworm, Schmidtea mediterranea.

132
0:07:16.423,000 --> 0:07:18,000
This little guy right here

133
0:07:18.546,000 --> 0:07:21,000
does things that essentially just blow my mind.

134
0:07:22.131,000 --> 0:07:26,000
You can grab one of these animals and cut it into 18 different fragments,

135
0:07:26.159,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and each and every one of those fragments will go on to regenerate

136
0:07:29.945,000 --> 0:07:3,000
a complete animal

137
0:07:31.287,000 --> 0:07:32,000
in under two weeks.

138
0:07:33.694,000 --> 0:07:37,000
18 heads, 18 bodies, 18 mysteries.

139
0:07:38.348,000 --> 0:07:4,000
For the past decade and a half or so,

140
0:07:40.768,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I've been trying to figure out how these little dudes do what they do,

141
0:07:44.502,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and how they pull this magic trick off.

142
0:07:46.725,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But like all good magicians,

143
0:07:48.463,000 --> 0:07:5,000
they're not really releasing their secrets readily to me.

144
0:07:51.342,000 --> 0:07:52,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:52.572,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So here we are,

146
0:07:53.754,000 --> 0:07:57,000
after 20 years of essentially studying these animals,

147
0:07:58.233,000 --> 0:08:,000
genome mapping, chin scratching,

148
0:08:00.564,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and thousands of amputations and thousands of regenerations,

149
0:08:03.807,000 --> 0:08:06,000
we still don't fully understand how these animals do what they do.

150
0:08:08.028,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Each planarian an ocean unto itself,

151
0:08:11.648,000 --> 0:08:12,000
full of unknowns.

152
0:08:14.476,000 --> 0:08:15,000
One of the common characteristics

153
0:08:16.184,000 --> 0:08:18,000
of all of these animals I've been talking to you about

154
0:08:18.82,000 --> 0:08:2,000
is that they did not appear to have received the memo

155
0:08:21.607,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that they need to behave according to the rules

156
0:08:24.298,000 --> 0:08:28,000
that we have derived from a handful of randomly selected animals

157
0:08:28.491,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that currently populate the vast majority

158
0:08:31.237,000 --> 0:08:33,000
of biomedical laboratories across the world.

159
0:08:34.117,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Meet our Nobel Prize winners.

160
0:08:36.371,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Seven species, essentially,

161
0:08:38.397,000 --> 0:08:41,000
that have produced for us the brunt of our understanding

162
0:08:42.023,000 --> 0:08:44,000
of biological behavior today.

163
0:08:45.172,000 --> 0:08:46,000
This little guy right here --

164
0:08:46.988,000 --> 0:08:48,000
three Nobel Prizes in 12 years.

165
0:08:50.204,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And yet, after all the attention they have garnered,

166
0:08:52.984,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and all the knowledge they have generated,

167
0:08:55.068,000 --> 0:08:57,000
as well as the lion's share of the funding,

168
0:08:57.117,000 --> 0:09:,000
here we are standing [before] the same litany of intractable problems

169
0:09:01.014,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and many new challenges.

170
0:09:03.22,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And that's because, unfortunately,

171
0:09:05.059,000 --> 0:09:07,000
these seven animals essentially correspond

172
0:09:07.697,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to 0.0009 percent of all of the species that inhabit the planet.

173
0:09:15.962,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So I'm beginning to suspect

174
0:09:18.372,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that our specialization is beginning to impede our progress at best,

175
0:09:23.157,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and at worst, is leading us astray.

176
0:09:26.235,000 --> 0:09:29,000
That's because life on this planet and its history

177
0:09:29.333,000 --> 0:09:3,000
is the history of rule breakers.

178
0:09:31.433,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Life started on the face of this planet as single-cell organisms,

179
0:09:34.804,000 --> 0:09:36,000
swimming for millions of years in the ocean,

180
0:09:37.15,000 --> 0:09:39,000
until one of those creatures decided,

181
0:09:39.46,000 --> 0:09:41,000
"I'm going to do things differently today;

182
0:09:41.543,000 --> 0:09:44,000
today I would like to invent something called multicellularity,

183
0:09:44.575,000 --> 0:09:45,000
and I'm going to do this."

184
0:09:45.872,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And I'm sure it wasn't a popular decision at the time --

185
0:09:48.548,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:49.599,000 --> 0:09:5,000
but somehow, it managed to do it.

187
0:09:51.229,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And then, multicellular organisms began to populate

188
0:09:53.819,000 --> 0:09:54,000
all these ancestral oceans,

189
0:09:55.219,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and they thrived.

190
0:09:56.431,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And we have them here today.

191
0:09:58.789,000 --> 0:10:,000
Land masses began to emerge from the surface of the oceans,

192
0:10:01.81,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and another creature thought,

193
0:10:03.288,000 --> 0:10:05,000
"Hey, that looks like a really nice piece of real estate.

194
0:10:06.101,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I'd like to move there."

195
0:10:07.376,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"Are you crazy?

196
0:10:08.559,000 --> 0:10:11,000
You're going to desiccate out there. Nothing can live out of water."

197
0:10:11.867,000 --> 0:10:12,000
But life found a way,

198
0:10:13.048,000 --> 0:10:15,000
and there are organisms now that live on land.

199
0:10:15.395,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Once on land, they may have looked up into the sky

200
0:10:17.817,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and said, "It would be nice to go to the clouds,

201
0:10:20.1,000 --> 0:10:21,000
I'm going to fly."

202
0:10:21.275,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"You can't break the law of gravity, there's no way you can fly."

203
0:10:24.374,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And yet, nature has invented --

204
0:10:26.683,000 --> 0:10:28,000
multiple and independent times --

205
0:10:28.714,000 --> 0:10:29,000
ways to fly.

206
0:10:30.368,000 --> 0:10:32,000
I love to study these animals that break the rules,

207
0:10:32.909,000 --> 0:10:35,000
because every time they break a rule, they invent something new

208
0:10:36.562,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that made it possible for us to be able to be here today.

209
0:10:40.624,000 --> 0:10:42,000
These animals did not get the memo.

210
0:10:42.918,000 --> 0:10:43,000
They break the rules.

211
0:10:44.642,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So if we're going to study animals that break the rules,

212
0:10:47.461,000 --> 0:10:49,000
shouldn't how we study them also break the rules?

213
0:10:51.666,000 --> 0:10:54,000
I think we need to renew our spirit of exploration.

214
0:10:55.44,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Rather than bring nature into our laboratories

215
0:10:57.948,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and interrogate it there,

216
0:10:59.287,000 --> 0:11:,000
we need to bring our science

217
0:11:01.017,000 --> 0:11:03,000
into the majestic laboratory that is nature,

218
0:11:03.946,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and there, with our modern technological armamentarium,

219
0:11:07.881,000 --> 0:11:09,000
interrogate every new form of life we find,

220
0:11:10.731,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and any new biological attribute that we may find.

221
0:11:14.486,000 --> 0:11:18,000
We actually need to bring all of our intelligence

222
0:11:18.664,000 --> 0:11:2,000
to becoming stupid again --

223
0:11:20.78,000 --> 0:11:23,000
clueless [before] the immensity of the unknown.

224
0:11:25.116,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Because after all,

225
0:11:26.501,000 --> 0:11:28,000
science is not really about knowledge.

226
0:11:28.684,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Science is about ignorance.

227
0:11:31.449,000 --> 0:11:32,000
That's what we do.

228
0:11:32.838,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Once, Antoine de Saint-Exupéry wrote,

229
0:11:35.993,000 --> 0:11:36,000
"If you want to build a ship,

230
0:11:37.818,000 --> 0:11:38,000
don't drum up people to collect wood

231
0:11:39.786,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and don't assign them tasks and work,

232
0:11:42.112,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea ..."

233
0:11:46.646,000 --> 0:11:47,000
As a scientist and a teacher,

234
0:11:48.374,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I like to paraphrase this to read

235
0:11:50.359,000 --> 0:11:53,000
that we scientists need to teach our students

236
0:11:53.541,000 --> 0:11:55,000
to long for the endless immensity of the sea

237
0:11:56.016,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that is our ignorance.

238
0:11:58.768,000 --> 0:12:01,000
We Homo sapiens are the only species we know of

239
0:12:02.657,000 --> 0:12:04,000
that is driven to scientific inquiry.

240
0:12:05.645,000 --> 0:12:07,000
We, like all other species on this planet,

241
0:12:07.803,000 --> 0:12:11,000
are inextricably woven into the history of life on this planet.

242
0:12:12.989,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And I think I'm a little wrong when I say that life is a mystery,

243
0:12:16.18,000 --> 0:12:18,000
because I think that life is actually an open secret

244
0:12:18.915,000 --> 0:12:21,000
that has been beckoning our species for millennia to understand it.

245
0:12:23.344,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So I ask you:

246
0:12:24.969,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Aren't we the best chance that life has to know itself?

247
0:12:29.053,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And if so,

248
0:12:30.228,000 --> 0:12:31,000
what the heck are we waiting for?

249
0:12:32.368,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Thank you.

250
0:12:33.593,000 --> 0:12:36,000
(Applause)

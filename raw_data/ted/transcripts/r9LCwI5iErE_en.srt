1
0:00:12.652,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Probably a lot of you know the story of the two salesmen

2
0:00:15.711,000 --> 0:00:17,000
who went down to Africa in the 1900s.

3
0:00:18.653,000 --> 0:00:2,000
They were sent down to find if there was any opportunity

4
0:00:21.317,000 --> 0:00:22,000
for selling shoes,

5
0:00:22.549,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and they wrote telegrams back to Manchester.

6
0:00:25.473,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And one of them wrote,

7
0:00:26.735,000 --> 0:00:29,000
"Situation hopeless. Stop. They don't wear shoes."

8
0:00:30.452,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And the other one wrote,

9
0:00:32.088,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"Glorious opportunity. They don't have any shoes yet."

10
0:00:35.12,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:36.444,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now, there's a similar situation in the classical music world,

12
0:00:39.627,000 --> 0:00:42,000
because there are some people who think that classical music is dying.

13
0:00:44.39,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And there are some of us who think you ain't seen nothing yet.

14
0:00:48.69,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And rather than go into statistics and trends,

15
0:00:52.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and tell you about all the orchestras that are closing,

16
0:00:54.921,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and the record companies that are folding,

17
0:00:57.401,000 --> 0:01:,000
I thought we should do an experiment tonight.

18
0:01:01.12,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Actually, it's not really an experiment, because I know the outcome.

19
0:01:04.503,000 --> 0:01:05,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:05.786,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But it's like an experiment.

21
0:01:07.7,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, before we start --

22
0:01:09.055,000 --> 0:01:12,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Before we start, I need to do two things.

24
0:01:14.622,000 --> 0:01:18,000
One is I want to remind you of what a seven-year-old child

25
0:01:18.721,000 --> 0:01:2,000
sounds like when he plays the piano.

26
0:01:20.756,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Maybe you have this child at home.

27
0:01:22.889,000 --> 0:01:23,000
He sounds something like this.

28
0:01:24.37,000 --> 0:01:26,000
(Music)

29
0:01:42.555,000 --> 0:01:43,000
(Music ends)

30
0:01:44.473,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I see some of you recognize this child.

31
0:01:47.306,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Now, if he practices for a year and takes lessons, he's now eight

32
0:01:50.72,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and he sounds like this.

33
0:01:51.926,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Music)

34
0:01:58.054,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Music ends)

35
0:01:59.269,000 --> 0:02:01,000
He practices for another year and takes lessons -- he's nine.

36
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
(Music)

37
0:02:07.323,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Music ends)

38
0:02:08.825,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Then he practices for another year and takes lessons -- now he's 10.

39
0:02:12.133,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Music)

40
0:02:16.84,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Music ends)

41
0:02:18.065,000 --> 0:02:19,000
At that point, they usually give up.

42
0:02:19.842,000 --> 0:02:2,000
(Laughter)

43
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
(Applause)

44
0:02:23.453,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now, if you'd waited for one more year, you would have heard this.

45
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
(Music)

46
0:02:35.129,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Music ends)

47
0:02:36.589,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Now, what happened was not maybe what you thought,

48
0:02:39.793,000 --> 0:02:41,000
which is, he suddenly became passionate, engaged,

49
0:02:42.616,000 --> 0:02:45,000
involved, got a new teacher, he hit puberty, or whatever it is.

50
0:02:46.523,000 --> 0:02:49,000
What actually happened was the impulses were reduced.

51
0:02:50.045,000 --> 0:02:53,000
You see, the first time, he was playing with an impulse on every note.

52
0:02:53.666,000 --> 0:02:55,000
(Music)

53
0:02:56.57,000 --> 0:02:58,000
And the second, with an impulse every other note.

54
0:02:58.942,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Music)

55
0:03:01.08,000 --> 0:03:02,000
You can see it by looking at my head.

56
0:03:03,000 --> 0:03:04,000
(Laughter)

57
0:03:04.74,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The nine-year-old put an impulse on every four notes.

58
0:03:08.036,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Music)

59
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
The 10-year-old, on every eight notes.

60
0:03:12.053,000 --> 0:03:14,000
(Music)

61
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And the 11-year-old, one impulse on the whole phrase.

62
0:03:17.569,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Music)

63
0:03:20.312,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I don't know how we got into this position.

64
0:03:22.804,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:24.87,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I didn't say, "I'm going to move my shoulder over, move my body."

66
0:03:28.017,000 --> 0:03:29,000
No, the music pushed me over,

67
0:03:29.631,000 --> 0:03:31,000
which is why I call it one-buttock playing.

68
0:03:31.98,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Music)

69
0:03:33.707,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It can be the other buttock.

70
0:03:35.087,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Music)

71
0:03:38.548,000 --> 0:03:41,000
You know, a gentleman was once watching a presentation I was doing,

72
0:03:42.056,000 --> 0:03:43,000
when I was working with a young pianist.

73
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:46,000
He was the president of a corporation in Ohio.

74
0:03:46.359,000 --> 0:03:48,000
I was working with this young pianist, and said,

75
0:03:48.646,000 --> 0:03:5,000
"The trouble with you is you're a two-buttock player.

76
0:03:51.15,000 --> 0:03:52,000
You should be a one-buttock player."

77
0:03:52.934,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I moved his body while he was playing.

78
0:03:54.838,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And suddenly, the music took off. It took flight.

79
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The audience gasped when they heard the difference.

80
0:03:59.732,000 --> 0:04:,000
Then I got a letter from this gentleman.

81
0:04:01.732,000 --> 0:04:02,000
He said, "I was so moved.

82
0:04:03.017,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I went back and I transformed my entire company

83
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
into a one-buttock company."

84
0:04:06.688,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Laughter)

85
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now, the other thing I wanted to do is to tell you about you.

86
0:04:13.08,000 --> 0:04:15,000
There are 1,600 people, I believe.

87
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
My estimation is that probably 45 of you

88
0:04:18.874,000 --> 0:04:2,000
are absolutely passionate about classical music.

89
0:04:21.784,000 --> 0:04:25,000
You adore classical music. Your FM is always on that classical dial.

90
0:04:26.53,000 --> 0:04:28,000
You have CDs in your car, and you go to the symphony,

91
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
your children are playing instruments.

92
0:04:31.08,000 --> 0:04:33,000
You can't imagine your life without classical music.

93
0:04:33.779,000 --> 0:04:35,000
That's the first group, quite small.

94
0:04:35.827,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Then there's another bigger group.

95
0:04:37.675,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The people who don't mind classical music.

96
0:04:39.81,000 --> 0:04:4,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:40.844,000 --> 0:04:42,000
You know, you've come home from a long day,

98
0:04:42.913,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and you take a glass of wine, and you put your feet up.

99
0:04:45.62,000 --> 0:04:47,000
A little Vivaldi in the background doesn't do any harm.

100
0:04:48.264,000 --> 0:04:49,000
That's the second group.

101
0:04:49.629,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now comes the third group:

102
0:04:50.961,000 --> 0:04:52,000
people who never listen to classical music.

103
0:04:53.185,000 --> 0:04:54,000
It's just simply not part of your life.

104
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
You might hear it like second-hand smoke at the airport ...

105
0:04:58.029,000 --> 0:04:59,000
(Laughter)

106
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
-- and maybe a little bit of a march from "Aida"

107
0:05:01.47,000 --> 0:05:02,000
when you come into the hall.

108
0:05:02.874,000 --> 0:05:03,000
But otherwise, you never hear it.

109
0:05:04.485,000 --> 0:05:05,000
That's probably the largest group.

110
0:05:06.144,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And then there's a very small group.

111
0:05:07.913,000 --> 0:05:09,000
These are the people who think they're tone-deaf.

112
0:05:11.19,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Amazing number of people think they're tone-deaf.

113
0:05:13.509,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Actually, I hear a lot, "My husband is tone-deaf."

114
0:05:15.89,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

115
0:05:16.915,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Actually, you cannot be tone-deaf.

116
0:05:18.994,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Nobody is tone-deaf.

117
0:05:20.24,000 --> 0:05:22,000
If you were tone-deaf, you couldn't change the gears

118
0:05:22.744,000 --> 0:05:23,000
on your car, in a stick shift car.

119
0:05:24.647,000 --> 0:05:25,000
You couldn't tell the difference between

120
0:05:26.584,000 --> 0:05:28,000
somebody from Texas and somebody from Rome.

121
0:05:29.324,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And the telephone. The telephone.

122
0:05:31.142,000 --> 0:05:32,000
If your mother calls

123
0:05:32.5,000 --> 0:05:35,000
on the miserable telephone, she calls and says, "Hello,"

124
0:05:35.7,000 --> 0:05:37,000
you not only know who it is, you know what mood she's in.

125
0:05:39.001,000 --> 0:05:42,000
You have a fantastic ear. Everybody has a fantastic ear.

126
0:05:42.772,000 --> 0:05:43,000
So nobody is tone-deaf.

127
0:05:44.694,000 --> 0:05:45,000
But I tell you what.

128
0:05:45.869,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It doesn't work for me to go on with this thing,

129
0:05:48.847,000 --> 0:05:51,000
with such a wide gulf between those who understand,

130
0:05:52.617,000 --> 0:05:54,000
love and are passionate about classical music,

131
0:05:55.047,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and those who have no relationship to it at all.

132
0:05:57.793,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The tone-deaf people, they're no longer here.

133
0:06:00.3,000 --> 0:06:01,000
But even between those three categories,

134
0:06:02.294,000 --> 0:06:03,000
it's too wide a gulf.

135
0:06:03.622,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So I'm not going to go on until every single person in this room,

136
0:06:08.064,000 --> 0:06:12,000
downstairs and in Aspen, and everybody else looking,

137
0:06:12.779,000 --> 0:06:15,000
will come to love and understand classical music.

138
0:06:17.135,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So that's what we're going to do.

139
0:06:18.867,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Now, you notice that there is not the slightest doubt in my mind

140
0:06:24.465,000 --> 0:06:26,000
that this is going to work, if you look at my face, right?

141
0:06:27.209,000 --> 0:06:3,000
It's one of the characteristics of a leader that he not doubt

142
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
for one moment the capacity of the people he's leading

143
0:06:35.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
to realize whatever he's dreaming.

144
0:06:38.053,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Imagine if Martin Luther King had said, "I have a dream.

145
0:06:40.998,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Of course, I'm not sure they'll be up to it."

146
0:06:43.232,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Laughter)

147
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
All right. So I'm going to take a piece of Chopin.

148
0:06:48.525,000 --> 0:06:5,000
This is a beautiful prelude by Chopin.

149
0:06:51.358,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Some of you will know it.

150
0:06:53.93,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Music)

151
0:07:23.278,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Do you know what I think probably happened here?

152
0:07:25.618,000 --> 0:07:27,000
When I started, you thought, "How beautiful that sounds."

153
0:07:28.32,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Music)

154
0:07:41.128,000 --> 0:07:43,000
"I don't think we should go to the same place

155
0:07:43.255,000 --> 0:07:44,000
for our summer holidays next year."

156
0:07:45.084,000 --> 0:07:47,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:47.728,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's funny, isn't it?

158
0:07:49.117,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It's funny how those thoughts kind of waft into your head.

159
0:07:54.387,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And of course --

160
0:07:55.641,000 --> 0:07:56,000
(Applause)

161
0:07:57.525,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Of course, if the piece is long and you've had a long day,

162
0:08:00.36,000 --> 0:08:01,000
you might actually drift off.

163
0:08:01.803,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Then your companion will dig you in the ribs

164
0:08:03.996,000 --> 0:08:06,000
and say, "Wake up! It's culture!" And then you feel even worse.

165
0:08:07.051,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter)

166
0:08:08.137,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But has it ever occurred to you that the reason you feel sleepy

167
0:08:11.15,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in classical music is not because of you, but because of us?

168
0:08:13.986,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Did anybody think while I was playing,

169
0:08:15.847,000 --> 0:08:16,000
"Why is he using so many impulses?"

170
0:08:17.831,000 --> 0:08:2,000
If I'd done this with my head you certainly would have thought it.

171
0:08:20.962,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Music)

172
0:08:26.708,000 --> 0:08:27,000
(Music ends)

173
0:08:27.882,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And for the rest of your life, every time you hear classical music,

174
0:08:31.062,000 --> 0:08:34,000
you'll always be able to know if you hear those impulses.

175
0:08:35.253,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So let's see what's really going on here.

176
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
We have a B. This is a B.

177
0:08:40.197,000 --> 0:08:41,000
The next note is a C.

178
0:08:41.958,000 --> 0:08:43,000
And the job of the C is to make the B sad.

179
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And it does, doesn't it?

180
0:08:45.785,000 --> 0:08:46,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:47.557,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Composers know that.

182
0:08:48.792,000 --> 0:08:5,000
If they want sad music, they just play those two notes.

183
0:08:51.395,000 --> 0:08:54,000
(Music)

184
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
But basically, it's just a B, with four sads.

185
0:08:57.715,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Laughter)

186
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Now, it goes down to A.

187
0:09:03.055,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Now to G.

188
0:09:04.62,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And then to F.

189
0:09:05.87,000 --> 0:09:07,000
So we have B, A, G, F.

190
0:09:08.535,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And if we have B, A, G, F,

191
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
what do we expect next?

192
0:09:11.771,000 --> 0:09:14,000
(Music)

193
0:09:15.35,000 --> 0:09:16,000
That might have been a fluke.

194
0:09:16.772,000 --> 0:09:17,000
Let's try it again.

195
0:09:17.958,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Music)

196
0:09:21.604,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Oh, the TED choir.

197
0:09:22.906,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Laughter)

198
0:09:26.088,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And you notice nobody is tone-deaf, right?

199
0:09:28.978,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Nobody is.

200
0:09:30.204,000 --> 0:09:31,000
You know, every village in Bangladesh

201
0:09:32.073,000 --> 0:09:36,000
and every hamlet in China -- everybody knows:

202
0:09:36.955,000 --> 0:09:38,000
da, da, da, da -- da.

203
0:09:39.42,000 --> 0:09:4,000
Everybody knows, who's expecting that E.

204
0:09:41.396,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Chopin didn't want to reach the E there,

205
0:09:43.619,000 --> 0:09:44,000
because what will have happened?

206
0:09:45.974,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It will be over, like Hamlet. Do you remember?

207
0:09:48.365,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Act One, scene three,

208
0:09:49.597,000 --> 0:09:51,000
he finds out his uncle killed his father.

209
0:09:51.639,000 --> 0:09:53,000
He keeps on going up to his uncle and almost killing him.

210
0:09:54.401,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And then he backs away, he goes up to him again, almost kills him.

211
0:09:57.592,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The critics sitting in the back row there,

212
0:09:59.66,000 --> 0:10:02,000
they have to have an opinion, so they say, "Hamlet is a procrastinator."

213
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Or they say, "Hamlet has an Oedipus complex."

214
0:10:05.709,000 --> 0:10:07,000
No, otherwise the play would be over, stupid.

215
0:10:07.982,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Laughter)

216
0:10:09.091,000 --> 0:10:11,000
That's why Shakespeare puts all that stuff in Hamlet --

217
0:10:11.707,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Ophelia going mad, the play within the play,

218
0:10:13.796,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and Yorick's skull, and the gravediggers.

219
0:10:15.78,000 --> 0:10:16,000
That's in order to delay --

220
0:10:17.447,000 --> 0:10:18,000
until Act Five, he can kill him.

221
0:10:19.106,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It's the same with the Chopin.

222
0:10:21.041,000 --> 0:10:23,000
He's just about to reach the E,

223
0:10:23.477,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and he says, "Oops, better go back up and do it again."

224
0:10:26.731,000 --> 0:10:27,000
So he does it again.

225
0:10:28.7,000 --> 0:10:29,000
Now, he gets excited.

226
0:10:29.952,000 --> 0:10:31,000
(Music)

227
0:10:32.169,000 --> 0:10:33,000
That's excitement, don't worry about it.

228
0:10:34.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Now, he gets to F-sharp, and finally he goes down to E,

229
0:10:38.01,000 --> 0:10:39,000
but it's the wrong chord --

230
0:10:39.32,000 --> 0:10:41,000
because the chord he's looking for is this one,

231
0:10:42.979,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and instead he does ...

232
0:10:44.764,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Now, we call that a deceptive cadence,

233
0:10:47.336,000 --> 0:10:48,000
because it deceives us.

234
0:10:48.572,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I tell my students, "If you have a deceptive cadence,

235
0:10:51.087,000 --> 0:10:53,000
raise your eyebrows, and everybody will know."

236
0:10:53.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
(Laughter)

237
0:10:55.262,000 --> 0:10:58,000
(Applause)

238
0:10:58.967,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Right.

239
0:11:00.658,000 --> 0:11:01,000
He gets to E, but it's the wrong chord.

240
0:11:02.604,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Now, he tries E again.

241
0:11:03.823,000 --> 0:11:04,000
That chord doesn't work.

242
0:11:05.309,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Now, he tries the E again. That chord doesn't work.

243
0:11:07.729,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Now, he tries E again, and that doesn't work.

244
0:11:10.284,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And then finally ...

245
0:11:14.326,000 --> 0:11:16,000
There was a gentleman in the front row who went, "Mmm."

246
0:11:17.203,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

247
0:11:18.477,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It's the same gesture he makes when he comes home

248
0:11:21.857,000 --> 0:11:23,000
after a long day, turns off the key in his car and says,

249
0:11:24.567,000 --> 0:11:25,000
"Aah, I'm home."

250
0:11:25.843,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Because we all know where home is.

251
0:11:27.493,000 --> 0:11:3,000
So this is a piece which goes from away to home.

252
0:11:30.757,000 --> 0:11:33,000
I'm going to play it all the way through and you're going to follow.

253
0:11:33.98,000 --> 0:11:34,000
B, C, B, C, B, C, B --

254
0:11:35.628,000 --> 0:11:36,000
down to A, down to G, down to F.

255
0:11:37.344,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Almost goes to E, but otherwise the play would be over.

256
0:11:39.956,000 --> 0:11:41,000
He goes back up to B, he gets very excited.

257
0:11:41.995,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Goes to F-sharp. Goes to E.

258
0:11:43.483,000 --> 0:11:45,000
It's the wrong chord. It's the wrong chord.

259
0:11:45.561,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And finally goes to E, and it's home.

260
0:11:47.926,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And what you're going to see is one-buttock playing.

261
0:11:51.386,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Laughter)

262
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:56,000
Because for me, to join the B to the E,

263
0:11:56.36,000 --> 0:12:01,000
I have to stop thinking about every single note along the way,

264
0:12:02.303,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and start thinking about the long, long line from B to E.

265
0:12:07.668,000 --> 0:12:11,000
You know, we were just in South Africa, and you can't go to South Africa

266
0:12:12.196,000 --> 0:12:14,000
without thinking of Mandela in jail for 27 years.

267
0:12:15.483,000 --> 0:12:16,000
What was he thinking about? Lunch?

268
0:12:17.698,000 --> 0:12:2,000
No, he was thinking about the vision for South Africa

269
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and for human beings.

270
0:12:22.729,000 --> 0:12:24,000
This is about vision. This is about the long line.

271
0:12:25.706,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Like the bird who flies over the field

272
0:12:27.991,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and doesn't care about the fences underneath, all right?

273
0:12:31.757,000 --> 0:12:34,000
So now, you're going to follow the line all the way from B to E.

274
0:12:34.876,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And I've one last request before I play this piece all the way through.

275
0:12:38.788,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Would you think of somebody who you adore,

276
0:12:42.631,000 --> 0:12:43,000
who's no longer there?

277
0:12:44.676,000 --> 0:12:46,000
A beloved grandmother, a lover --

278
0:12:47.06,000 --> 0:12:51,000
somebody in your life who you love with all your heart,

279
0:12:51.207,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but that person is no longer with you.

280
0:12:54.422,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Bring that person into your mind,

281
0:12:56.408,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and at the same time,

282
0:12:58.409,000 --> 0:13:01,000
follow the line all the way from B to E,

283
0:13:01.891,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and you'll hear everything that Chopin had to say.

284
0:13:10.52,000 --> 0:13:13,000
(Music)

285
0:14:57.239,000 --> 0:14:58,000
(Music ends)

286
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:03,000
(Applause)

287
0:15:08.682,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Now, you may be wondering --

288
0:15:10.7,000 --> 0:15:13,000
(Applause)

289
0:15:15.83,000 --> 0:15:16,000
(Applause ends)

290
0:15:17.004,000 --> 0:15:18,000
You may be wondering why I'm clapping.

291
0:15:18.917,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Well, I did this at a school in Boston

292
0:15:20.855,000 --> 0:15:23,000
with about 70 seventh graders, 12-year-olds.

293
0:15:24.639,000 --> 0:15:25,000
I did exactly what I did with you,

294
0:15:26.437,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and I explained the whole thing.

295
0:15:28.318,000 --> 0:15:29,000
At the end, they went crazy, clapping.

296
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I was clapping. They were clapping.

297
0:15:31.97,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Finally, I said, "Why am I clapping?"

298
0:15:33.852,000 --> 0:15:35,000
And one of them said, "Because we were listening."

299
0:15:36.21,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Laughter)

300
0:15:40.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Think of it. 1,600 people, busy people,

301
0:15:43.378,000 --> 0:15:45,000
involved in all sorts of different things,

302
0:15:45.742,000 --> 0:15:48,000
listening, understanding and being moved

303
0:15:49.591,000 --> 0:15:5,000
by a piece by Chopin.

304
0:15:51.671,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Now, that is something.

305
0:15:52.941,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Am I sure that every single person followed that,

306
0:15:55.672,000 --> 0:15:56,000
understood it, was moved by it?

307
0:15:57.291,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Of course, I can't be sure.

308
0:15:58.616,000 --> 0:16:,000
But I'll tell you what happened to me in Ireland

309
0:16:00.901,000 --> 0:16:01,000
during the Troubles, 10 years ago,

310
0:16:02.576,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and I was working with some Catholic and Protestant kids

311
0:16:05.525,000 --> 0:16:07,000
on conflict resolution.

312
0:16:07.98,000 --> 0:16:08,000
And I did this with them --

313
0:16:09.686,000 --> 0:16:11,000
a risky thing to do, because they were street kids.

314
0:16:13.136,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And one of them came to me the next morning

315
0:16:15.649,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and he said,

316
0:16:16.874,000 --> 0:16:18,000
"You know, I've never listened to classical music in my life,

317
0:16:19.771,000 --> 0:16:21,000
but when you played that shopping piece ..."

318
0:16:21.904,000 --> 0:16:22,000
(Laughter)

319
0:16:23.698,000 --> 0:16:26,000
He said, "My brother was shot last year and I didn't cry for him.

320
0:16:27.919,000 --> 0:16:29,000
But last night, when you played that piece,

321
0:16:29.967,000 --> 0:16:3,000
he was the one I was thinking about.

322
0:16:32.672,000 --> 0:16:34,000
And I felt the tears streaming down my face.

323
0:16:34.764,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And it felt really good to cry for my brother."

324
0:16:37.886,000 --> 0:16:39,000
So I made up my mind at that moment

325
0:16:40.366,000 --> 0:16:43,000
that classical music is for everybody.

326
0:16:45.071,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Everybody.

327
0:16:47.16,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Now, how would you walk --

328
0:16:49.681,000 --> 0:16:52,000
my profession, the music profession doesn't see it that way.

329
0:16:53.934,000 --> 0:16:56,000
They say three percent of the population likes classical music.

330
0:16:57.173,000 --> 0:17:,000
If only we could move it to four percent, our problems would be over.

331
0:17:00.451,000 --> 0:17:01,000
(Laughter)

332
0:17:01.514,000 --> 0:17:04,000
How would you walk? How would you talk? How would you be?

333
0:17:05.164,000 --> 0:17:08,000
If you thought, "Three percent of the population likes classical music,

334
0:17:08.523,000 --> 0:17:1,000
if only we could move it to four percent."

335
0:17:10.547,000 --> 0:17:12,000
How would you walk or talk? How would you be?

336
0:17:12.688,000 --> 0:17:14,000
If you thought, "Everybody loves classical music --

337
0:17:15.147,000 --> 0:17:17,000
they just haven't found out about it yet."

338
0:17:17.563,000 --> 0:17:19,000
See, these are totally different worlds.

339
0:17:20.547,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Now, I had an amazing experience.

340
0:17:22.846,000 --> 0:17:23,000
I was 45 years old,

341
0:17:24.112,000 --> 0:17:25,000
I'd been conducting for 20 years,

342
0:17:25.919,000 --> 0:17:27,000
and I suddenly had a realization.

343
0:17:28.93,000 --> 0:17:3,000
The conductor of an orchestra doesn't make a sound.

344
0:17:32.638,000 --> 0:17:34,000
My picture appears on the front of the CD --

345
0:17:35.019,000 --> 0:17:37,000
(Laughter)

346
0:17:37.945,000 --> 0:17:39,000
But the conductor doesn't make a sound.

347
0:17:39.97,000 --> 0:17:4,000
He depends, for his power,

348
0:17:41.817,000 --> 0:17:43,000
on his ability to make other people powerful.

349
0:17:45.645,000 --> 0:17:46,000
And that changed everything for me.

350
0:17:47.573,000 --> 0:17:48,000
It was totally life-changing.

351
0:17:49.33,000 --> 0:17:5,000
People in my orchestra said,

352
0:17:50.867,000 --> 0:17:52,000
"Ben, what happened?" That's what happened.

353
0:17:53.123,000 --> 0:17:57,000
I realized my job was to awaken possibility in other people.

354
0:17:58.853,000 --> 0:18:,000
And of course, I wanted to know whether I was doing that.

355
0:18:01.586,000 --> 0:18:02,000
How do you find out?

356
0:18:02.799,000 --> 0:18:03,000
You look at their eyes.

357
0:18:04.134,000 --> 0:18:06,000
If their eyes are shining, you know you're doing it.

358
0:18:08.033,000 --> 0:18:1,000
You could light up a village with this guy's eyes.

359
0:18:10.42,000 --> 0:18:11,000
(Laughter)

360
0:18:11.46,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Right. So if the eyes are shining, you know you're doing it.

361
0:18:14.733,000 --> 0:18:16,000
If the eyes are not shining, you get to ask a question.

362
0:18:17.445,000 --> 0:18:18,000
And this is the question:

363
0:18:18.875,000 --> 0:18:2,000
who am I being

364
0:18:21.463,000 --> 0:18:23,000
that my players' eyes are not shining?

365
0:18:23.756,000 --> 0:18:24,000
We can do that with our children, too.

366
0:18:25.637,000 --> 0:18:27,000
Who am I being,

367
0:18:28.533,000 --> 0:18:3,000
that my children's eyes are not shining?

368
0:18:31.223,000 --> 0:18:33,000
That's a totally different world.

369
0:18:33.635,000 --> 0:18:38,000
Now, we're all about to end this magical, on-the-mountain week,

370
0:18:38.724,000 --> 0:18:39,000
we're going back into the world.

371
0:18:40.995,000 --> 0:18:43,000
And I say, it's appropriate for us to ask the question,

372
0:18:44.764,000 --> 0:18:48,000
who are we being as we go back out into the world?

373
0:18:49.731,000 --> 0:18:51,000
And you know, I have a definition of success.

374
0:18:52.105,000 --> 0:18:53,000
For me, it's very simple.

375
0:18:53.365,000 --> 0:18:55,000
It's not about wealth and fame and power.

376
0:18:55.395,000 --> 0:18:57,000
It's about how many shining eyes I have around me.

377
0:18:58.374,000 --> 0:19:,000
So now, I have one last thought,

378
0:19:00.758,000 --> 0:19:04,000
which is that it really makes a difference what we say --

379
0:19:05.114,000 --> 0:19:06,000
the words that come out of our mouth.

380
0:19:07.669,000 --> 0:19:09,000
I learned this from a woman who survived Auschwitz,

381
0:19:10.465,000 --> 0:19:11,000
one of the rare survivors.

382
0:19:11.957,000 --> 0:19:13,000
She went to Auschwitz when she was 15 years old.

383
0:19:16.163,000 --> 0:19:17,000
And ...

384
0:19:19.151,000 --> 0:19:21,000
And her brother was eight,

385
0:19:21.191,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and the parents were lost.

386
0:19:23.944,000 --> 0:19:27,000
And she told me this, she said,

387
0:19:28.336,000 --> 0:19:3,000
"We were in the train going to Auschwitz,

388
0:19:30.812,000 --> 0:19:32,000
and I looked down and saw my brother's shoes were missing.

389
0:19:34.255,000 --> 0:19:37,000
I said, 'Why are you so stupid, can't you keep your things together

390
0:19:37.589,000 --> 0:19:38,000
for goodness' sake?'"

391
0:19:38.831,000 --> 0:19:4,000
The way an elder sister might speak to a younger brother.

392
0:19:43.445,000 --> 0:19:45,000
Unfortunately, it was the last thing she ever said to him,

393
0:19:46.184,000 --> 0:19:47,000
because she never saw him again.

394
0:19:47.732,000 --> 0:19:48,000
He did not survive.

395
0:19:49.532,000 --> 0:19:51,000
And so when she came out of Auschwitz, she made a vow.

396
0:19:52.388,000 --> 0:19:53,000
She told me this.

397
0:19:53.642,000 --> 0:19:56,000
She said, "I walked out of Auschwitz into life

398
0:19:57.086,000 --> 0:19:58,000
and I made a vow.

399
0:19:58.865,000 --> 0:19:59,000
And the vow was,

400
0:20:00.117,000 --> 0:20:05,000
"I will never say anything that couldn't stand as the last thing I ever say."

401
0:20:06.733,000 --> 0:20:07,000
Now, can we do that? No.

402
0:20:08.354,000 --> 0:20:1,000
And we'll make ourselves wrong and others wrong.

403
0:20:12.337,000 --> 0:20:14,000
But it is a possibility to live into.

404
0:20:15.781,000 --> 0:20:16,000
Thank you.

405
0:20:17.095,000 --> 0:20:2,000
(Applause)

406
0:20:23.639,000 --> 0:20:24,000
Shining eyes.

407
0:20:25.079,000 --> 0:20:26,000
(Applause)

408
0:20:26.52,000 --> 0:20:27,000
Shining eyes.

409
0:20:27.92,000 --> 0:20:3,000
(Applause)

410
0:20:34.16,000 --> 0:20:36,000
Thank you, thank you.

1
0:00:12.815,000 --> 0:00:15,000
In the next six minutes that you will listen to me,

2
0:00:16.788,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the world will have lost three mothers

3
0:00:19.349,000 --> 0:00:2,000
while delivering their babies:

4
0:00:22.411,000 --> 0:00:25,000
one, because of a severe complication;

5
0:00:26.321,000 --> 0:00:28,000
second, because she will be a teenager

6
0:00:28.863,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and her body will not be prepared for birth;

7
0:00:32.672,000 --> 0:00:38,000
but the third, only because of lack of access to basic clean tools

8
0:00:38.702,000 --> 0:00:39,000
at the time of childbirth.

9
0:00:41.496,000 --> 0:00:43,000
She will not be alone.

10
0:00:43.803,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Over one million mothers and babies die every single year

11
0:00:47.502,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in the developing world,

12
0:00:49.055,000 --> 0:00:52,000
only because of lack of access to basic cleanliness

13
0:00:52.823,000 --> 0:00:54,000
while giving birth to their babies.

14
0:00:56.601,000 --> 0:00:58,000
My journey began on a hot summer afternoon

15
0:00:59.103,000 --> 0:01:01,000
in India in 2008,

16
0:01:01.295,000 --> 0:01:04,000
when after a day of meeting women and listening to their needs,

17
0:01:04.992,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I landed in a thatched hut with a midwife.

18
0:01:08.855,000 --> 0:01:12,000
As a mother, I was very curious on how she delivered babies in her house.

19
0:01:13.629,000 --> 0:01:15,000
After a deep and engaging conversation with her

20
0:01:16.356,000 --> 0:01:2,000
on how she considered it a profound calling to do what she was doing,

21
0:01:20.726,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I asked her a parting question:

22
0:01:23.401,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Do you have the tools that you need to deliver the babies?

23
0:01:27.761,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I got to see her tool.

24
0:01:30.419,000 --> 0:01:34,000
"This is what I use to separate the mother and the baby," she said.

25
0:01:35.62,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Unsure of how to react, I held this agricultural tool in my hand in shock.

26
0:01:41.464,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I took a picture of this, hugged her and walked away.

27
0:01:45.46,000 --> 0:01:47,000
My mind was flooded with reflections of my own infection

28
0:01:48.453,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that I had to struggle with for a year past childbirth

29
0:01:51.509,000 --> 0:01:54,000
despite having access to the best medical care,

30
0:01:55.083,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and memories of my conversation with my father,

31
0:01:57.489,000 --> 0:01:59,000
who had lost his mom to childbirth,

32
0:01:59.678,000 --> 0:02:01,000
on how he thought his life would be so different

33
0:02:02.144,000 --> 0:02:04,000
if she would have been just next to him growing up.

34
0:02:05.632,000 --> 0:02:08,000
As a product developer, I started my process of research.

35
0:02:09.413,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I was very excited to find that there was a product out there

36
0:02:12.612,000 --> 0:02:13,000
called the Clean Birth Kit.

37
0:02:14.65,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But I just couldn't buy one for months.

38
0:02:18.031,000 --> 0:02:21,000
They were only assembled based on availability of funding.

39
0:02:22.818,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Finally, when I got my hands on one, I was in shock again.

40
0:02:26.783,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I would never use these tools to deliver my baby, I thought.

41
0:02:30.473,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But to confirm my instincts, I went back to the women,

42
0:02:33.408,000 --> 0:02:36,000
some of whom had the experience of using this product.

43
0:02:37.316,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Lo and behold, they had the same reaction and more.

44
0:02:40.842,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The women said they would rather deliver on a floor

45
0:02:43.376,000 --> 0:02:45,000
than on a plastic sheet that smeared blood all over.

46
0:02:45.998,000 --> 0:02:48,000
They were absolutely right -- it would cause more infection.

47
0:02:49.437,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The thread provided was a highway to bacterial infection

48
0:02:52.47,000 --> 0:02:53,000
through the baby's umbilical cord,

49
0:02:54.193,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and the blade used was the kind that men used for shaving,

50
0:02:57.061,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and they did not want it anywhere close to them.

51
0:03:00.449,000 --> 0:03:02,000
There was no incentive for anybody to redesign this product,

52
0:03:03.427,000 --> 0:03:04,000
because it was based on charity.

53
0:03:05.362,000 --> 0:03:07,000
The women were never consulted in this process.

54
0:03:08.704,000 --> 0:03:1,000
And to my surprise, the need was not only in homes

55
0:03:11.227,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but also in institutional settings with high-volume births.

56
0:03:14.58,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Situations in remote areas were even more daunting.

57
0:03:18.449,000 --> 0:03:19,000
This had to change.

58
0:03:20.049,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I made this my area of focus.

59
0:03:22.335,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I started the design process by collecting feedback,

60
0:03:26.411,000 --> 0:03:27,000
developing prototypes

61
0:03:27.85,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and engaging with various stakeholders researching global protocols.

62
0:03:32.126,000 --> 0:03:34,000
With every single prototype, we went back to the women

63
0:03:34.792,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to ensure that we had a product for them.

64
0:03:37.869,000 --> 0:03:39,000
What I learned through this process was that these women,

65
0:03:40.619,000 --> 0:03:41,000
despite their extreme poverty,

66
0:03:42.082,000 --> 0:03:44,000
placed great value on their health and well-being.

67
0:03:44.483,000 --> 0:03:46,000
They were absolutely not poor in mind.

68
0:03:46.957,000 --> 0:03:49,000
As with all of us, they would appreciate a well-designed product

69
0:03:49.982,000 --> 0:03:5,000
developed for their needs.

70
0:03:52.07,000 --> 0:03:54,000
After many iterations working with experts,

71
0:03:54.591,000 --> 0:03:55,000
medical health professionals

72
0:03:56.096,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and the women themselves,

73
0:03:57.955,000 --> 0:04:,000
I should say it was not an easy process at all,

74
0:04:01.347,000 --> 0:04:03,000
but we had a simple and beautiful design.

75
0:04:05.507,000 --> 0:04:09,000
For a dollar more than what the existing product was offered for,

76
0:04:10.301,000 --> 0:04:12,000
at three dollars, we were able to deliver "janma,"

77
0:04:13.076,000 --> 0:04:14,000
a clean birth kit in a purse.

78
0:04:15.878,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Janma, meaning "birth," contained a blood-absorbing sheet

79
0:04:18.722,000 --> 0:04:19,000
for the woman to give birth on,

80
0:04:20.473,000 --> 0:04:24,000
a surgical scalpel, a cord clamp, a bar of soap, a pair of gloves

81
0:04:24.502,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and the first cloth to wipe the baby clean.

82
0:04:27.189,000 --> 0:04:29,000
All this came packaged in a beautiful purse

83
0:04:29.401,000 --> 0:04:32,000
that was given to the mother as a gift after all her hard work,

84
0:04:32.64,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that she carried home with pride as a symbol of prosperity.

85
0:04:37.685,000 --> 0:04:39,000
One woman reacted to this gift.

86
0:04:40.167,000 --> 0:04:42,000
She said, "Is this really mine? Can I keep it?"

87
0:04:43.915,000 --> 0:04:45,000
The other one said, "Will you give me a different color

88
0:04:46.548,000 --> 0:04:47,000
when I have my next baby?"

89
0:04:48.051,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:49.829,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Better yet, a woman expressed that this was the first purse

91
0:04:52.77,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that she had ever owned in her life.

92
0:04:54.871,000 --> 0:04:56,000
The kit, aside from its symbolism and its simplicity,

93
0:04:57.679,000 --> 0:05:,000
is designed to follow globally recommended medical protocol

94
0:05:01.015,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and serves as a behavior-change tool to follow steps one after the other.

95
0:05:05.918,000 --> 0:05:08,000
It can not only be used in homes, but also in institutional settings.

96
0:05:10.476,000 --> 0:05:13,000
To date, our kit has impacted over 600,000 mothers and babies

97
0:05:14.449,000 --> 0:05:15,000
around the world.

98
0:05:16.221,000 --> 0:05:19,000
It's a humbling experience to watch these numbers grow,

99
0:05:19.488,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and I cannot wait until we reach a hundred million.

100
0:05:24.699,000 --> 0:05:26,000
But women's health issues do not end here.

101
0:05:27.597,000 --> 0:05:31,000
There are thousands of simple issues that require low-cost interventions.

102
0:05:31.631,000 --> 0:05:33,000
We have facts to prove that if we invest in women and girls

103
0:05:34.571,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and provide them with better health and well-being,

104
0:05:37.004,000 --> 0:05:42,000
they will deliver healthier and wealthier and prosperous communities.

105
0:05:42.039,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We have to start by bringing simplicity and dignity to women's health issues:

106
0:05:46.047,000 --> 0:05:49,000
from reducing maternal mortality, to breaking taboos,

107
0:05:49.143,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to empowering women to take control of their own lives.

108
0:05:52.677,000 --> 0:05:53,000
This is my dream.

109
0:05:55.137,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But it is not possible to achieve it without engaging men and women alike

110
0:05:59.617,000 --> 0:06:,000
from around the world --

111
0:06:01.082,000 --> 0:06:02,000
yes, all of you.

112
0:06:04.593,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I recently heard this lyric by Leonard Cohen:

113
0:06:08.782,000 --> 0:06:11,000
"Ring the bells that still can ring.

114
0:06:12.029,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Forget your perfect offering.

115
0:06:15.193,000 --> 0:06:17,000
There is a crack in everything.

116
0:06:18.118,000 --> 0:06:2,000
That's how the light gets in."

117
0:06:20.89,000 --> 0:06:22,000
This is my bit of light.

118
0:06:23.361,000 --> 0:06:24,000
But we need more light.

119
0:06:25.029,000 --> 0:06:28,000
In fact, we need huge spotlights placed in the world of women's health

120
0:06:28.497,000 --> 0:06:3,000
if we need a better tomorrow.

121
0:06:30.819,000 --> 0:06:34,000
We should never forget that women are at the center of a sustainable world,

122
0:06:35.336,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and we do not exist without them.

123
0:06:37.887,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Thank you.

124
0:06:39.07,000 --> 0:06:43,000
(Applause)

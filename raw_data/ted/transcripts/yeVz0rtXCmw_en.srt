1
0:00:12.599,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I've learned some of my most important life lessons

2
0:00:17.38,000 --> 0:00:19,000
from drug dealers

3
0:00:19.879,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and gang members

4
0:00:22.25,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and prostitutes,

5
0:00:24.503,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and I've had some of my most profound theological conversations

6
0:00:30.13,000 --> 0:00:33,000
not in the hallowed halls of a seminary

7
0:00:33.704,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but on a street corner

8
0:00:36.12,000 --> 0:00:38,000
on a Friday night, at 1 a.m.

9
0:00:39.701,000 --> 0:00:45,000
That's a little unusual, since I am a Baptist minister, seminary-trained,

10
0:00:45.872,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and pastored a church for over 20 years,

11
0:00:50.226,000 --> 0:00:51,000
but it's true.

12
0:00:52.594,000 --> 0:00:54,000
It came as a part of my participation

13
0:00:55.264,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in a public safety crime reduction strategy

14
0:00:59.49,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that saw a 79 percent reduction in violent crime

15
0:01:03.247,000 --> 0:01:06,000
over an eight-year period in a major city.

16
0:01:07.385,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But I didn't start out wanting to be

17
0:01:09.242,000 --> 0:01:12,000
a part of somebody's crime reduction strategy.

18
0:01:13.335,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I was 25, had my first church.

19
0:01:16.22,000 --> 0:01:18,000
If you would have asked me what my ambition was,

20
0:01:18.6,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I would have told you I wanted to be a megachurch pastor.

21
0:01:22.918,000 --> 0:01:25,000
I wanted a 15-, 20,000-member church.

22
0:01:26.865,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I wanted my own television ministry.

23
0:01:29.675,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I wanted my own clothing line.

24
0:01:32.391,000 --> 0:01:33,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:33.747,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I wanted to be your long distance carrier.

26
0:01:35.888,000 --> 0:01:36,000
You know, the whole nine yards.

27
0:01:37.732,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:40.425,000 --> 0:01:43,000
After about a year of pastoring,

29
0:01:43.478,000 --> 0:01:46,000
my membership went up about 20 members.

30
0:01:47.1,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So megachurchdom was way down the road.

31
0:01:50.73,000 --> 0:01:52,000
But seriously, if you'd have said, "What is your ambition?"

32
0:01:53.554,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I would have said just to be a good pastor,

33
0:01:55.575,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to be able to be with people through all the passages of life,

34
0:01:59.94,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to preach messages that would have an everyday meaning for folks,

35
0:02:04.213,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and in the African-American tradition,

36
0:02:07.115,000 --> 0:02:11,000
to be able to represent the community that I serve.

37
0:02:11.265,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But there was something else that was happening in my city

38
0:02:16.333,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and in the entire metro area,

39
0:02:18.364,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and in most metro areas in the United States,

40
0:02:22.125,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and that was the homicide rate started to rise precipitously.

41
0:02:27.534,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And there were young people who were killing each other

42
0:02:30.101,000 --> 0:02:32,000
for reasons that I thought were very trivial,

43
0:02:32.748,000 --> 0:02:36,000
like bumping into someone in a high school hallway,

44
0:02:37.652,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and then after school, shooting the person.

45
0:02:40.921,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Someone with the wrong color shirt on,

46
0:02:44.427,000 --> 0:02:48,000
on the wrong street corner at the wrong time.

47
0:02:48.63,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And something needed to be done about that.

48
0:02:52.548,000 --> 0:02:56,000
It got to the point where it started to change the character of the city.

49
0:02:56.872,000 --> 0:02:58,000
You could go to any housing project,

50
0:02:59.1,000 --> 0:03:02,000
for example, like the one that was down the street from my church,

51
0:03:02.259,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and you would walk in, and it would be like a ghost town,

52
0:03:05.161,000 --> 0:03:08,000
because the parents wouldn't allow their kids to come out and play,

53
0:03:08.783,000 --> 0:03:11,000
even in the summertime, because of the violence.

54
0:03:11.847,000 --> 0:03:13,000
You would listen in the neighborhoods on any given night,

55
0:03:14.599,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and to the untrained ear, it sounded like fireworks,

56
0:03:17.827,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but it was gunfire.

57
0:03:19.207,000 --> 0:03:22,000
You'd hear it almost every night, when you were cooking dinner,

58
0:03:23.04,000 --> 0:03:27,000
telling your child a bedtime story, or just watching TV.

59
0:03:28.2,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And you can go to any emergency room at any hospital,

60
0:03:32.994,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and you would see lying on gurneys

61
0:03:36.123,000 --> 0:03:39,000
young black and Latino men shot and dying.

62
0:03:40.697,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And I was doing funerals,

63
0:03:42.532,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but not of the venerated matriarchs and patriarchs who'd lived a long life

64
0:03:46.99,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and there's a lot to say.

65
0:03:49.892,000 --> 0:03:51,000
I was doing funerals of 18-year-olds,

66
0:03:52.748,000 --> 0:03:53,000
17-year-olds,

67
0:03:54.71,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and 16-year-olds,

68
0:03:56.614,000 --> 0:04:,000
and I was standing in a church or at a funeral home

69
0:04:01.281,000 --> 0:04:03,000
struggling to say something

70
0:04:03.405,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that would make some meaningful impact.

71
0:04:07.3,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And so while my colleagues were building these cathedrals great and tall

72
0:04:13.29,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and buying property outside of the city

73
0:04:16.628,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and moving their congregations out

74
0:04:19.198,000 --> 0:04:24,000
so that they could create or recreate their cities of God,

75
0:04:24.337,000 --> 0:04:27,000
the social structures in the inner cities

76
0:04:27.494,000 --> 0:04:3,000
were sagging under the weight of all of this violence.

77
0:04:31.411,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And so I stayed, because somebody needed to do something,

78
0:04:34.298,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and so I had looked at what I had and moved on that.

79
0:04:37.85,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I started to preach decrying the violence in the community.

80
0:04:42.192,000 --> 0:04:44,000
And I started to look at the programming in my church,

81
0:04:44.746,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and I started to build programs that would catch the at-risk youth,

82
0:04:48.647,000 --> 0:04:5,000
those who were on the fence to the violence.

83
0:04:52.106,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I even tried to be innovative in my preaching.

84
0:04:54.266,000 --> 0:04:56,000
You all have heard of rap music, right?

85
0:04:56.495,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Rap music?

86
0:04:57.725,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I even tried to rap sermon one time.

87
0:05:00.303,000 --> 0:05:03,000
It didn't work, but at least I tried it.

88
0:05:04.038,000 --> 0:05:08,000
I'll never forget the young person who came to me after that sermon.

89
0:05:08.244,000 --> 0:05:09,000
He waited until everybody was gone,

90
0:05:10.124,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and he said, "Rev, rap sermon, huh?" And I was like, "Yeah, what do you think?"

91
0:05:13.956,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And he said, "Don't do that again, Rev."

92
0:05:16.997,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Laughter)

93
0:05:20.132,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But I preached and I built these programs,

94
0:05:22.465,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and I thought maybe if my colleagues did the same

95
0:05:24.903,000 --> 0:05:26,000
that it would make a difference.

96
0:05:27.109,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But the violence just careened out of control,

97
0:05:31.1,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and people who were not involved in the violence were getting shot and killed:

98
0:05:35.833,000 --> 0:05:4,000
somebody going to buy a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store,

99
0:05:41.662,000 --> 0:05:44,000
or someone who was sitting at a bus stop just waiting for a bus,

100
0:05:45.661,000 --> 0:05:47,000
or kids who were playing in the park,

101
0:05:47.82,000 --> 0:05:5,000
oblivious to the violence on the other side of the park,

102
0:05:51.117,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but it coming and visiting them.

103
0:05:53.811,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Things were out of control,

104
0:05:56.365,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and I didn't know what to do,

105
0:05:58.803,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and then something happened that changed everything for me.

106
0:06:03.795,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It was a kid by the name of Jesse McKie,

107
0:06:06.72,000 --> 0:06:08,000
walking home with his friend Rigoberto Carrion

108
0:06:09.646,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to the housing project down the street from my church.

109
0:06:13.35,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They met up with a group of youth who were from a gang in Dorchester,

110
0:06:17.749,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and they were killed.

111
0:06:20.12,000 --> 0:06:22,000
But as Jesse was running from the scene mortally wounded,

112
0:06:22.88,000 --> 0:06:24,000
he was running in the direction of my church,

113
0:06:25.249,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and he died some 100, 150 yards away.

114
0:06:28.657,000 --> 0:06:31,000
If he would have gotten to the church, it wouldn't have made a difference,

115
0:06:32.196,000 --> 0:06:34,000
because the lights were out; nobody was home.

116
0:06:35.077,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And I took that as a sign.

117
0:06:38.23,000 --> 0:06:41,000
When they caught some of the youth that had done this deed,

118
0:06:41.235,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to my surprise, they were around my age,

119
0:06:44.903,000 --> 0:06:47,000
but the gulf that was between us was vast.

120
0:06:48.525,000 --> 0:06:52,000
It was like we were in two completely different worlds.

121
0:06:52.728,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And so as I contemplated all of this

122
0:06:55.73,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and looked at what was happening,

123
0:06:58.138,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I suddenly realized that there was a paradox that was emerging inside of me,

124
0:07:04.42,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and the paradox was this: in all of those sermons

125
0:07:06.836,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that I preached decrying the violence,

126
0:07:08.819,000 --> 0:07:12,000
I was also talking about building community,

127
0:07:13.161,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but I suddenly realized

128
0:07:15.343,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that there was a certain segment of the population

129
0:07:18.432,000 --> 0:07:21,000
that I was not including in my definition of community.

130
0:07:22.621,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And so the paradox was this:

131
0:07:24.02,000 --> 0:07:27,000
If I really wanted the community that I was preaching for,

132
0:07:27.719,000 --> 0:07:29,000
I needed to reach out

133
0:07:29.739,000 --> 0:07:33,000
and embrace this group that I had cut out of my definition.

134
0:07:34.912,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Which meant not about building programs

135
0:07:37.529,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to catch those who were on the fences of violence,

136
0:07:41.128,000 --> 0:07:46,000
but to reach out and to embrace those who were committing the acts of violence,

137
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the gang bangers, the drug dealers.

138
0:07:48.906,000 --> 0:07:52,000
As soon as I came to that realization, a quick question came to my mind.

139
0:07:53.494,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Why me?

140
0:07:55.358,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I mean, isn't this a law enforcement issue?

141
0:07:57.403,000 --> 0:07:58,000
This is why we have the police, right?

142
0:08:00.233,000 --> 0:08:04,000
As soon as the question, "Why me?" came, the answer came just as quickly:

143
0:08:04.969,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Why me? Because I'm the one who can't sleep at night thinking about it.

144
0:08:10.666,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Because I'm the one looking around saying somebody needs to do something about this,

145
0:08:14.853,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and I'm starting to realize that that someone is me.

146
0:08:18.367,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I mean, isn't that how movements start anyway?

147
0:08:20.692,000 --> 0:08:24,000
They don't start with a grand convention and people coming together

148
0:08:24.926,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and then walking in lockstep with a statement.

149
0:08:28.749,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But it starts with just a few, or maybe just one.

150
0:08:33.924,000 --> 0:08:35,000
It started with me that way,

151
0:08:36.075,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and so I decided to figure out the culture of violence

152
0:08:40.43,000 --> 0:08:42,000
in which these young people who were committing them existed,

153
0:08:43.301,000 --> 0:08:45,000
and I started to volunteer at the high school.

154
0:08:45.475,000 --> 0:08:47,000
After about two weeks of volunteering at the high school,

155
0:08:48.17,000 --> 0:08:5,000
I realized that the youth that I was trying to reach,

156
0:08:50.655,000 --> 0:08:52,000
they weren't going to high school.

157
0:08:53.102,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I started to walk in the community,

158
0:08:55.801,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and it didn't take a rocket scientist to realize that they weren't out

159
0:08:59.189,000 --> 0:09:01,000
during the day.

160
0:09:01.836,000 --> 0:09:05,000
So I started to walk the streets at night, late at night,

161
0:09:06.471,000 --> 0:09:08,000
going into the parks where they were,

162
0:09:09.11,000 --> 0:09:12,000
building the relationship that was necessary.

163
0:09:12.238,000 --> 0:09:16,000
A tragedy happened in Boston that brought a number of clergy together,

164
0:09:17.21,000 --> 0:09:2,000
and there was a small cadre of us who came to the realization

165
0:09:21.204,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that we had to come out of the four walls of our sanctuary

166
0:09:24.189,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and meet the youth where they were,

167
0:09:25.868,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and not try to figure out how to bring them in.

168
0:09:29.735,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And so we decided to walk together,

169
0:09:32.439,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and we would get together

170
0:09:34.42,000 --> 0:09:36,000
in one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the city

171
0:09:37.152,000 --> 0:09:39,000
on a Friday night and on a Saturday night

172
0:09:39.567,000 --> 0:09:4,000
at 10 p.m.,

173
0:09:41.529,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and we would walk until 2 or 3 in the morning.

174
0:09:44.39,000 --> 0:09:47,000
I imagine we were quite the anomaly when we first started walking.

175
0:09:47.612,000 --> 0:09:49,000
I mean, we weren't drug dealers.

176
0:09:49.934,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We weren't drug customers.

177
0:09:51.809,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We weren't the police. Some of us would have collars on.

178
0:09:54.566,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It was probably a really odd thing.

179
0:09:57.143,000 --> 0:10:,000
But they started speaking to us after a while,

180
0:10:00.347,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and what we found out is that

181
0:10:02.274,000 --> 0:10:05,000
while we were walking, they were watching us,

182
0:10:05.963,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and they wanted to make sure of a couple of things:

183
0:10:08.5,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that number one, we were going to be consistent in our behavior,

184
0:10:13.671,000 --> 0:10:14,000
that we would keep coming out there;

185
0:10:15.384,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and then secondly, they had wanted to make sure

186
0:10:17.575,000 --> 0:10:19,000
that we weren't out there to exploit them.

187
0:10:20.13,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Because there was always somebody who would say,

188
0:10:22.41,000 --> 0:10:23,000
"We're going to take back the streets,"

189
0:10:24.274,000 --> 0:10:27,000
but they would always seem to have a television camera with them,

190
0:10:27.398,000 --> 0:10:28,000
or a reporter,

191
0:10:29.231,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and they would enhance their own reputation

192
0:10:31.739,000 --> 0:10:33,000
to the detriment of those on the streets.

193
0:10:34.246,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So when they saw that we had none of that,

194
0:10:36.801,000 --> 0:10:38,000
they decided to talk to us.

195
0:10:39.4,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And then we did an amazing thing for preachers.

196
0:10:43.255,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We decided to listen and not preach.

197
0:10:47.352,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Come on, give it up for me.

198
0:10:49.223,000 --> 0:10:52,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

199
0:10:52.682,000 --> 0:10:56,000
All right, come on, you're cutting into my time now, okay? (Laughter)

200
0:10:56.792,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But it was amazing.

201
0:10:58.612,000 --> 0:11:04,000
We said to them, "We don't know our own communities after 9 p.m. at night,

202
0:11:04.919,000 --> 0:11:06,000
between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m.,

203
0:11:07.759,000 --> 0:11:08,000
but you do.

204
0:11:09.389,000 --> 0:11:14,000
You are the subject matter experts, if you will, of that period of time.

205
0:11:14.551,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So talk to us. Teach us.

206
0:11:17.387,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Help us to see what we're not seeing.

207
0:11:19.477,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Help us to understand what we're not understanding."

208
0:11:23.262,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And they were all too happy to do that,

209
0:11:25.677,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and we got an idea of what life on the streets was all about,

210
0:11:30.436,000 --> 0:11:33,000
very different than what you see on the 11 o'clock news,

211
0:11:34.244,000 --> 0:11:4,000
very different than what is portrayed in popular media and even social media.

212
0:11:40.48,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And as we were talking with them,

213
0:11:42.696,000 --> 0:11:46,000
a number of myths were dispelled about them with us.

214
0:11:46.899,000 --> 0:11:52,000
And one of the biggest myths was that these kids were cold and heartless

215
0:11:53.576,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and uncharacteristically bold in their violence.

216
0:11:57.44,000 --> 0:12:,000
What we found out was the exact opposite.

217
0:12:00.737,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Most of the young people who were out there on the streets

218
0:12:03.477,000 --> 0:12:06,000
are just trying to make it on the streets.

219
0:12:06.542,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And we also found out

220
0:12:08.492,000 --> 0:12:11,000
that some of the most intelligent and creative

221
0:12:12.052,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and magnificent and wise

222
0:12:18.979,000 --> 0:12:2,000
people that we've ever met

223
0:12:21.472,000 --> 0:12:25,000
were on the street, engaged in a struggle.

224
0:12:26.247,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And I know some of them call it survival, but I call them overcomers,

225
0:12:30.39,000 --> 0:12:33,000
because when you're in the conditions that they're in,

226
0:12:33.43,000 --> 0:12:38,000
to be able to live every day is an accomplishment of overcoming.

227
0:12:39.669,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And as a result of that, we said to them,

228
0:12:41.823,000 --> 0:12:44,000
"How do you see this church, how do you see this institution

229
0:12:45.271,000 --> 0:12:48,000
helping this situation?"

230
0:12:48.312,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And we developed a plan in conversation with these youths.

231
0:12:52.61,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We stopped looking at them as the problem to be solved,

232
0:12:56.764,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and we started looking at them as partners, as assets,

233
0:13:01.942,000 --> 0:13:06,000
as co-laborers in the struggle to reduce violence in the community.

234
0:13:07.654,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Imagine developing a plan,

235
0:13:09.836,000 --> 0:13:14,000
you have one minister at one table and a heroin dealer at the other table,

236
0:13:14.945,000 --> 0:13:19,000
coming up with a way in which the church can help the entire community.

237
0:13:21.51,000 --> 0:13:25,000
The Boston Miracle was about bringing people together.

238
0:13:25.788,000 --> 0:13:26,000
We had other partners.

239
0:13:27.645,000 --> 0:13:28,000
We had law enforcement partners.

240
0:13:29.248,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We had police officers.

241
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
It wasn't the entire force,

242
0:13:34.31,000 --> 0:13:38,000
because there were still some who still had that lock-'em-up mentality,

243
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:41,000
but there were other cops

244
0:13:41.136,000 --> 0:13:46,000
who saw the honor in partnering with the community,

245
0:13:46.221,000 --> 0:13:49,000
who saw the responsibility from themselves

246
0:13:49.407,000 --> 0:13:55,000
to be able to work as partners with community leaders and faith leaders

247
0:13:55.96,000 --> 0:13:57,000
in order to reduce violence in the community.

248
0:13:58.49,000 --> 0:14:,000
Same with probation officers,

249
0:14:00.941,000 --> 0:14:01,000
same with judges,

250
0:14:02.822,000 --> 0:14:05,000
same with folks who were up that law enforcement chain,

251
0:14:06.56,000 --> 0:14:08,000
because they realized, like we did,

252
0:14:08.743,000 --> 0:14:11,000
that we'll never arrest ourselves out of this situation,

253
0:14:12.435,000 --> 0:14:17,000
that there will not be enough prosecutions made,

254
0:14:18.314,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and you cannot fill these jails up enough

255
0:14:23.762,000 --> 0:14:26,000
in order to alleviate the problem.

256
0:14:27.897,000 --> 0:14:3,000
I helped to start an organization

257
0:14:31.637,000 --> 0:14:35,000
20 years ago, a faith-based organization, to deal with this issue.

258
0:14:36.443,000 --> 0:14:39,000
I left it about four years ago

259
0:14:39.74,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and started working in cities across the United States,

260
0:14:42.84,000 --> 0:14:43,000
19 in total,

261
0:14:44.779,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and what I found out was that in those cities,

262
0:14:47.599,000 --> 0:14:51,000
there was always this component of community leaders

263
0:14:52.429,000 --> 0:14:56,000
who put their heads down and their nose to the grindstone,

264
0:14:56.724,000 --> 0:14:58,000
who checked their egos at the door

265
0:14:59.69,000 --> 0:15:02,000
and saw the whole as greater than the sum of its parts,

266
0:15:02.947,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and came together and found ways to work with youth out on the streets,

267
0:15:08.566,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that the solution is not more cops,

268
0:15:13.349,000 --> 0:15:18,000
but the solution is mining the assets that are there in the community,

269
0:15:18.643,000 --> 0:15:21,000
to have a strong community component

270
0:15:22.381,000 --> 0:15:26,000
in the collaboration around violence reduction.

271
0:15:27.373,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Now, there is a movement in the United States

272
0:15:31.705,000 --> 0:15:37,000
of young people who I am very proud of who are dealing with the structural issues

273
0:15:38.299,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that need to change if we're going to be a better society.

274
0:15:42.756,000 --> 0:15:46,000
But there is this political ploy to try to pit police brutality

275
0:15:47.655,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and police misconduct against black-on-black violence.

276
0:15:52.693,000 --> 0:15:53,000
But it's a fiction.

277
0:15:54.597,000 --> 0:15:56,000
It's all connected.

278
0:15:56.617,000 --> 0:16:,000
When you think about decades of failed housing policies

279
0:16:01.331,000 --> 0:16:04,000
and poor educational structures,

280
0:16:05.208,000 --> 0:16:08,000
when you think about persistent unemployment

281
0:16:08.482,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and underemployment in a community,

282
0:16:11.36,000 --> 0:16:13,000
when you think about poor healthcare,

283
0:16:14.124,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and then you throw drugs into the mix

284
0:16:17.3,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and duffel bags full of guns,

285
0:16:19.348,000 --> 0:16:24,000
little wonder that you would see this culture of violence emerge.

286
0:16:24.782,000 --> 0:16:28,000
And then the response that comes from the state is more cops

287
0:16:29.14,000 --> 0:16:32,000
and more suppression of hot spots.

288
0:16:32.296,000 --> 0:16:34,000
It's all connected,

289
0:16:34.562,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and one of the wonderful things that we've been able to do

290
0:16:38.34,000 --> 0:16:43,000
is to be able to show the value of partnering together --

291
0:16:43.473,000 --> 0:16:48,000
community, law enforcement, private sector, the city --

292
0:16:49.039,000 --> 0:16:5,000
in order to reduce violence.

293
0:16:50.427,000 --> 0:16:53,000
You have to value that community component.

294
0:16:54.534,000 --> 0:17:,000
I believe that we can end the era of violence in our cities.

295
0:17:01.154,000 --> 0:17:06,000
I believe that it is possible and that people are doing it even now.

296
0:17:07.144,000 --> 0:17:08,000
But I need your help.

297
0:17:09.537,000 --> 0:17:13,000
It can't just come from folks who are burning themselves out

298
0:17:14.186,000 --> 0:17:15,000
in the community.

299
0:17:15.744,000 --> 0:17:17,000
They need support. They need help.

300
0:17:18.742,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Go back to your city.

301
0:17:20.68,000 --> 0:17:21,000
Find those people.

302
0:17:22.259,000 --> 0:17:24,000
"You need some help? I'll help you out."

303
0:17:24.976,000 --> 0:17:27,000
Find those people. They're there.

304
0:17:28.18,000 --> 0:17:33,000
Bring them together with law enforcement, the private sector, and the city,

305
0:17:33.537,000 --> 0:17:35,000
with the one aim of reducing violence,

306
0:17:36.4,000 --> 0:17:39,000
but make sure that that community component is strong.

307
0:17:40.346,000 --> 0:17:43,000
Because the old adage that comes from Burundi is right:

308
0:17:43.667,000 --> 0:17:5,000
that you do for me, without me, you do to me.

309
0:17:51.41,000 --> 0:17:53,000
God bless you. Thank you.

0:00:13.142,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Ten years ago,

2
0:00:14.318,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I had my first exhibition here.

3
0:00:16.638,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I had no idea if it would work or was at all possible,

4
0:00:20.678,000 --> 0:00:23,000
but with a few small steps and a very steep learning curve,

5
0:00:24.115,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I made my first sculpture, called "The Lost Correspondent."

6
0:00:28.406,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Teaming up with a marine biologist and a local dive center,

7
0:00:31.847,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I submerged the work off the coast of Grenada,

8
0:00:34.54,000 --> 0:00:36,000
in an area decimated by Hurricane Ivan.

9
0:00:37.957,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And then this incredible thing happened.

10
0:00:40.554,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It transformed.

11
0:00:43.675,000 --> 0:00:44,000
One sculpture became two.

12
0:00:46.955,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Two quickly became 26.

13
0:00:50.756,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And before I knew it,

14
0:00:51.931,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we had the world's first underwater sculpture park.

15
0:00:56.73,000 --> 0:01:,000
In 2009, I moved to Mexico and started by casting local fisherman.

16
0:01:02.95,000 --> 0:01:03,000
This grew to a small community,

17
0:01:06.218,000 --> 0:01:09,000
to almost an entire movement of people in defense of the sea.

18
0:01:11.228,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And then finally, to an underwater museum,

19
0:01:13.945,000 --> 0:01:15,000
with over 500 living sculptures.

20
0:01:18.076,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Gardening, it seems, is not just for greenhouses.

21
0:01:23.375,000 --> 0:01:25,000
We've since scaled up the designs:

22
0:01:26.041,000 --> 0:01:3,000
"Ocean Atlas," in the Bahamas, rising 16 feet up to the surface

23
0:01:30.175,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and weighing over 40 tons,

24
0:01:33.825,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to now currently in Lanzarote,

25
0:01:35.637,000 --> 0:01:38,000
where I'm making an underwater botanical garden,

26
0:01:38.796,000 --> 0:01:4,000
the first of its kind in the Atlantic Ocean.

27
0:01:42.834,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Each project, we use materials and designs that help encourage life;

28
0:01:47.108,000 --> 0:01:52,000
a long-lasting pH-neutral cement provides a stable and permanent platform.

29
0:01:53.398,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It is textured to allow coral polyps to attach.

30
0:01:57.262,000 --> 0:01:59,000
We position them down current from natural reefs

31
0:02:00.003,000 --> 0:02:03,000
so that after spawning, there's areas for them to settle.

32
0:02:05.937,000 --> 0:02:07,000
The formations are all configured so that they aggregate fish

33
0:02:08.859,000 --> 0:02:09,000
on a really large scale.

34
0:02:12.918,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Even this VW Beetle has an internal living habitat

35
0:02:16.503,000 --> 0:02:19,000
to encourage crustaceans such as lobsters and sea urchins.

36
0:02:22.733,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So why exhibit my work in the ocean?

37
0:02:25.497,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Because honestly, it's really not easy.

38
0:02:28.059,000 --> 0:02:31,000
When you're in the middle of the sea under a hundred-foot crane,

39
0:02:31.288,000 --> 0:02:34,000
trying to lower eight tons down to the sea floor,

40
0:02:34.407,000 --> 0:02:37,000
you start to wonder whether I shouldn't have taken up watercolor painting instead.

41
0:02:38.36,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Laughter)

42
0:02:39.385,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But in the end, the results always blow my mind.

43
0:02:42.122,000 --> 0:02:45,000
(Music)

44
0:03:04.791,000 --> 0:03:06,000
The ocean is the most incredible exhibition space

45
0:03:07.735,000 --> 0:03:08,000
an artist could ever wish for.

46
0:03:09.43,000 --> 0:03:12,000
You have amazing lighting effects changing by the hour,

47
0:03:12.807,000 --> 0:03:16,000
explosions of sand covering the sculptures in a cloud of mystery,

48
0:03:17.148,000 --> 0:03:18,000
a unique timeless quality

49
0:03:19.076,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and the procession of inquisitive visitors,

50
0:03:21.14,000 --> 0:03:23,000
each lending their own special touch to the site.

51
0:03:23.897,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Music)

52
0:03:51.288,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But over the years,

53
0:03:52.463,000 --> 0:03:55,000
I've realized that the greatest thing about what we do,

54
0:03:55.846,000 --> 0:03:57,000
the really humbling thing about the work,

55
0:03:58.369,000 --> 0:04:,000
is that as soon as we submerge the sculptures,

56
0:04:00.606,000 --> 0:04:01,000
they're not ours anymore,

57
0:04:02.156,000 --> 0:04:03,000
because as soon as we sink them,

58
0:04:03.728,000 --> 0:04:05,000
the sculptures, they belong to the sea.

59
0:04:06.013,000 --> 0:04:1,000
As new reefs form, a new world literally starts to evolve,

60
0:04:10.056,000 --> 0:04:12,000
a world that continuously amazes me.

61
0:04:12.75,000 --> 0:04:14,000
It's a bit of a cliché, but nothing man-made

62
0:04:15.242,000 --> 0:04:17,000
can ever match the imagination of nature.

63
0:04:18.591,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Sponges look like veins across the faces.

64
0:04:22.478,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Staghorn coral morphs the form.

65
0:04:26.567,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Fireworms scrawl white lines as they feed.

66
0:04:31.557,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Tunicates explode from the faces.

67
0:04:36.597,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Sea urchins crawl across the bodies feeding at night.

68
0:04:42.752,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Coralline algae applies a kind of purple paint.

69
0:04:47.671,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The deepest red I've ever seen in my life lives underwater.

70
0:04:54.235,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Gorgonian fans oscillate with the waves.

71
0:04:59.002,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Purple sponges breathe water like air.

72
0:05:03.221,000 --> 0:05:06,000
And grey angelfish glide silently overhead.

73
0:05:08.832,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And the amazing response we've had to these works

74
0:05:11.217,000 --> 0:05:15,000
tells me that we've managed to plug into something really primal,

75
0:05:15.394,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because it seems that these images translate across the world,

76
0:05:19.243,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and that's made me focus on my responsibility as an artist

77
0:05:23.108,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and about what I'm trying to achieve.

78
0:05:25.917,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I'm standing here today on this boat in the middle of the ocean,

79
0:05:29.563,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and this couldn't be a better place

80
0:05:31.31,000 --> 0:05:35,000
to talk about the really, really important effect of my work.

81
0:05:35.461,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Because as we all know,

82
0:05:37.145,000 --> 0:05:4,000
our reefs are dying, and our oceans are in trouble.

83
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So here's the thing:

84
0:05:42.454,000 --> 0:05:44,000
the most used, searched and shared image

85
0:05:45.241,000 --> 0:05:47,000
of all my work thus far is this.

86
0:05:49.256,000 --> 0:05:51,000
And I think this is for a reason,

87
0:05:51.43,000 --> 0:05:52,000
or at least I hope it is.

88
0:05:53.56,000 --> 0:05:56,000
What I really hope is that people are beginning to understand

89
0:05:56.724,000 --> 0:05:59,000
that when we think of the environment and the destruction of nature,

90
0:06:00.416,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that we need to start thinking about our oceans, too.

91
0:06:03.684,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Since building these sites, we've seen some phenomenal

92
0:06:06.239,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and unexpected results.

93
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Besides creating over 800 square meters of new habitats and living reef,

94
0:06:13.433,000 --> 0:06:17,000
visitors to the marine park in Cancun now divide half their time

95
0:06:17.481,000 --> 0:06:19,000
between the museum and the natural reefs,

96
0:06:20.037,000 --> 0:06:23,000
providing significant rest for natural, overstressed areas.

97
0:06:24.859,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Visitors to "Ocean Atlas" in the Bahamas highlighted a leak

98
0:06:28.75,000 --> 0:06:29,000
from a nearby oil refinery.

99
0:06:31.251,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The subsequent international media forced the local government

100
0:06:34.6,000 --> 0:06:36,000
to pledge 10 million dollars in coastal cleanups.

101
0:06:38.154,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The sculpture park in Grenada was instrumental

102
0:06:40.552,000 --> 0:06:44,000
in the government designating a spot -- a marine-protected area.

103
0:06:44.843,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Entrance fees to the park now help fund park rangers

104
0:06:48.226,000 --> 0:06:5,000
to manage tourism and fishing quotas.

105
0:06:51.293,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The site was actually listed as a "Wonder of the World"

106
0:06:53.925,000 --> 0:06:54,000
by National Geographic.

107
0:06:56.297,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So why are we all here today in this room?

108
0:06:58.901,000 --> 0:07:,000
What do we all have in common?

109
0:07:01.56,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I think we all share a fear

110
0:07:03.219,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that we don't protect our oceans enough.

111
0:07:05.837,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And one way of thinking about this

112
0:07:07.508,000 --> 0:07:1,000
is that we don't regard our oceans as sacred,

113
0:07:10.877,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and we should.

114
0:07:12.572,000 --> 0:07:13,000
When we see incredible places --

115
0:07:14.159,000 --> 0:07:17,000
like the Himalayas or the La Sagrada Família,

116
0:07:18.121,000 --> 0:07:19,000
or the Mona Lisa, even --

117
0:07:19.806,000 --> 0:07:21,000
when we see these incredible places and things,

118
0:07:22.719,000 --> 0:07:24,000
we understand their importance.

119
0:07:24.788,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We call them sacred,

120
0:07:26.202,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and we do our best to cherish them, to protect them

121
0:07:29.883,000 --> 0:07:3,000
and to keep them safe.

122
0:07:31.97,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But in order to do that,

123
0:07:33.209,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we are the ones that have to assign that value;

124
0:07:36.563,000 --> 0:07:37,000
otherwise, it will be desecrated

125
0:07:38.12,000 --> 0:07:4,000
by someone who doesn't understand that value.

126
0:07:41.549,000 --> 0:07:44,000
So I want to finish up tonight by talking about sacred things.

127
0:07:45.408,000 --> 0:07:47,000
When we were naming the site in Cancun,

128
0:07:47.586,000 --> 0:07:51,000
we named it a museum for a very important and simple reason:

129
0:07:51.928,000 --> 0:07:53,000
museums are places of preservation,

130
0:07:54.379,000 --> 0:07:56,000
of conservation and of education.

131
0:07:57.524,000 --> 0:08:,000
They're places where we keep objects of great value to us,

132
0:08:00.984,000 --> 0:08:03,000
where we simply treasure them for them being themselves.

133
0:08:04.966,000 --> 0:08:06,000
If someone was to throw an egg at the Sistine Chapel,

134
0:08:07.777,000 --> 0:08:08,000
we'd all go crazy.

135
0:08:09.704,000 --> 0:08:11,000
If someone wanted to build a seven-star hotel

136
0:08:12.194,000 --> 0:08:13,000
at the bottom of the Grand Canyon,

137
0:08:14.033,000 --> 0:08:16,000
then we would laugh them out of Arizona.

138
0:08:16.494,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Yet every day we dredge, pollute and overfish our oceans.

139
0:08:20.927,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And I think it's easier for us to do that,

140
0:08:23.357,000 --> 0:08:25,000
because when we see the ocean,

141
0:08:25.477,000 --> 0:08:26,000
we don't see the havoc we're wreaking.

142
0:08:27.429,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Because for most people,

143
0:08:29.023,000 --> 0:08:3,000
the ocean is like this.

144
0:08:30.98,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And it's really hard

145
0:08:32.155,000 --> 0:08:37,000
to think of something that's just so plain and so enormous, as fragile.

146
0:08:37.597,000 --> 0:08:4,000
It's simply too massive, too vast, too endless.

147
0:08:41.387,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And what do you see here?

148
0:08:42.634,000 --> 0:08:44,000
I think most people actually look past to the horizon.

149
0:08:45.713,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So I think there's a real danger

150
0:08:47.426,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that we never really see the sea,

151
0:08:50.337,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and if we don't really see it,

152
0:08:51.87,000 --> 0:08:53,000
if it doesn't have its own iconography,

153
0:08:54.293,000 --> 0:08:56,000
if we miss its majesty,

154
0:08:56.329,000 --> 0:08:58,000
then there's a big danger that we take it for granted.

155
0:09:00.772,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Cancun is famous for spring break,

156
0:09:04.113,000 --> 0:09:06,000
tequila and foam parties.

157
0:09:06.396,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And its waters are where frat boys can ride around on Jet Skis

158
0:09:09.963,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and banana boats.

159
0:09:11.59,000 --> 0:09:15,000
But because of our work there, there's now a little corner of Cancun

160
0:09:15.627,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that is simply precious for being itself.

161
0:09:19.071,000 --> 0:09:21,000
And we don't want to stop in Grenada,

162
0:09:21.726,000 --> 0:09:23,000
in Cancun or the Bahamas.

163
0:09:24.496,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Just last month, I installed these Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse

164
0:09:28.411,000 --> 0:09:29,000
in the Thames River,

165
0:09:31.062,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in central London, right in front of the Houses of Parliament,

166
0:09:34.588,000 --> 0:09:36,000
putting a stark message about climate change

167
0:09:37.569,000 --> 0:09:4,000
in front of the people that have the power to help change things.

168
0:09:43.049,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Because for me, this is just the beginning of the mission.

169
0:09:46.111,000 --> 0:09:48,000
We want to team up with other inventors,

170
0:09:48.641,000 --> 0:09:51,000
creators, philanthropists, educators, biologists,

171
0:09:52.586,000 --> 0:09:54,000
to see better futures for our oceans.

172
0:09:54.984,000 --> 0:09:56,000
And we want to see beyond sculpture,

173
0:09:57.556,000 --> 0:09:58,000
beyond art, even.

174
0:09:59.995,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Say you're a 14-year-old kid from the city,

175
0:10:02.437,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and you've never seen the ocean.

176
0:10:04.476,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And instead of getting taken to the natural history museum

177
0:10:08.093,000 --> 0:10:09,000
or an aquarium,

178
0:10:09.705,000 --> 0:10:11,000
you get taken out to the ocean,

179
0:10:12.251,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to an underwater Noah's Ark,

180
0:10:15.036,000 --> 0:10:18,000
which you can access through a dry-glass viewing tunnel,

181
0:10:19.03,000 --> 0:10:21,000
where you can see all the wildlife of the land

182
0:10:21.456,000 --> 0:10:23,000
be colonized by the wildlife of the ocean.

183
0:10:24.29,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Clearly, it would blow your mind.

184
0:10:27.29,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So let's think big and let's think deep.

185
0:10:30.569,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Who knows where our imagination and willpower can lead us?

186
0:10:34.029,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I hope that by bringing our art into the ocean,

187
0:10:37.001,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that not only do we take advantage of amazing creativity

188
0:10:40.554,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and visual impact of the setting,

189
0:10:42.713,000 --> 0:10:44,000
but that we are also giving something back,

190
0:10:45.183,000 --> 0:10:48,000
and by encouraging new environments to thrive,

191
0:10:48.565,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and in some way opening up a new -- or maybe it's a really old way

192
0:10:53.658,000 --> 0:10:55,000
of seeing the seas:

193
0:10:55.749,000 --> 0:10:58,000
as delicate, precious places,

194
0:10:59.303,000 --> 0:11:,000
worthy of our protection.

195
0:11:01.896,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Our oceans are sacred.

196
0:11:03.675,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Thank you.

197
0:11:05.2,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Applause)

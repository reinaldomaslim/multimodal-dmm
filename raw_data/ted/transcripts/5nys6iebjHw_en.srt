1
0:00:12.853,000 --> 0:00:13,000
What do you think would happen

2
0:00:15.248,000 --> 0:00:17,000
if you invited an individual who had been living on the street

3
0:00:18.177,000 --> 0:00:19,000
for many years,

4
0:00:19.747,000 --> 0:00:2,000
had mental health issues

5
0:00:22.457,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and was an alcoholic

6
0:00:24.168,000 --> 0:00:26,000
to move directly from the street

7
0:00:26.277,000 --> 0:00:27,000
into housing?

8
0:00:28.233,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We had heard this was being done in New York City,

9
0:00:31.174,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and it was called the Housing First model.

10
0:00:33.199,000 --> 0:00:35,000
We wondered if it would work in Utah.

11
0:00:36.038,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So to make that determination, we decided to create a pilot,

12
0:00:39.727,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and Keta was one of the 17 chronically homeless individuals

13
0:00:45.002,000 --> 0:00:46,000
we included in this pilot.

14
0:00:46.906,000 --> 0:00:49,000
She had been on the street for 20-plus years,

15
0:00:50.368,000 --> 0:00:51,000
had mental health issues

16
0:00:52.357,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and was a severe alcoholic.

17
0:00:55.193,000 --> 0:00:57,000
The first night in her apartment,

18
0:00:57.303,000 --> 0:00:59,000
she put her belongings on the bed

19
0:00:59.82,000 --> 0:01:,000
and slept on the floor.

20
0:01:01.605,000 --> 0:01:03,000
The next three nights, she slept out by the dumpster

21
0:01:04.32,000 --> 0:01:05,000
near the apartment building.

22
0:01:06.815,000 --> 0:01:07,000
With the aid of her case manager,

23
0:01:08.73,000 --> 0:01:1,000
she moved back into her apartment

24
0:01:10.867,000 --> 0:01:13,000
but continued to sleep on the floor for several nights.

25
0:01:14.688,000 --> 0:01:18,000
It took over two weeks for her to develop enough trust and confidence

26
0:01:19.94,000 --> 0:01:21,000
that this apartment was hers

27
0:01:22.392,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and would not be taken away from her

28
0:01:24.482,000 --> 0:01:26,000
before she would start sleeping in the bed.

29
0:01:27.58,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Homelessness is a continuing challenge for many cities

30
0:01:30.362,000 --> 0:01:31,000
throughout our country.

31
0:01:32.174,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Our homeless population falls into three major categories:

32
0:01:35.804,000 --> 0:01:37,000
those that are temporarily homeless,

33
0:01:37.971,000 --> 0:01:38,000
about 75 percent;

34
0:01:39.722,000 --> 0:01:4,000
those that are episodically homeless,

35
0:01:41.627,000 --> 0:01:42,000
about 10 percent;

36
0:01:43.209,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and those that are chronically homeless,

37
0:01:45.279,000 --> 0:01:46,000
about 15 percent.

38
0:01:47.653,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Chronic homelessness is defined as an unaccompanied adult

39
0:01:51.458,000 --> 0:01:54,000
who has been continuously homeless for a year or more

40
0:01:54.684,000 --> 0:01:56,000
or more than four times homeless in three years

41
0:01:57.598,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that totals 365 days.

42
0:02:00.325,000 --> 0:02:03,000
This small 15 percent of the homeless population

43
0:02:03.92,000 --> 0:02:07,000
can consume 50 to 60 percent of the homeless resources

44
0:02:08.196,000 --> 0:02:09,000
available in a community.

45
0:02:10.14,000 --> 0:02:13,000
In addition, they can cost the community

46
0:02:13.735,000 --> 0:02:17,000
20,000 to 45,000 dollars a year per person

47
0:02:17.905,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in emergency services costs,

48
0:02:20.554,000 --> 0:02:21,000
such as EMT runs,

49
0:02:22.495,000 --> 0:02:25,000
emergency room visits, as many of you will be aware,

50
0:02:25.658,000 --> 0:02:28,000
addictions, interactions with the police,

51
0:02:28.695,000 --> 0:02:29,000
jail time.

52
0:02:30.551,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Simply put, this small population costs a lot.

53
0:02:36.147,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Based on this reality, the US government began an initiative in 2003

54
0:02:40.639,000 --> 0:02:43,000
inviting states and cities and counties

55
0:02:43.799,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to develop a plan to end chronic homelessness

56
0:02:46.846,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in a 10-year period.

57
0:02:48.798,000 --> 0:02:5,000
The state of Utah accepted this invitation,

58
0:02:50.988,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and I was asked to lead this effort.

59
0:02:54.485,000 --> 0:02:57,000
In 2005, we approved a 10-year plan,

60
0:02:57.658,000 --> 0:03:,000
and 10 years later, in 2015,

61
0:03:00.819,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we reported a reduction in our chronic homeless population

62
0:03:03.909,000 --> 0:03:05,000
of 91 percent statewide.

63
0:03:07.587,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Applause)

64
0:03:12.962,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That's amazing.

65
0:03:15.437,000 --> 0:03:18,000
When I began this process, and we began this process,

66
0:03:19.471,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I realized that I had a limited understanding of homelessness

67
0:03:24.136,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and the factors that impacted it,

68
0:03:26.4,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and that I needed a fairly major change in my belief, in my thinking,

69
0:03:30.837,000 --> 0:03:33,000
because I had been raised with the theory of rugged individualism

70
0:03:34.677,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and "pull yourself up by the bootstraps."

71
0:03:36.791,000 --> 0:03:39,000
That philosophy came from being raised on our family's cattle ranch

72
0:03:40.001,000 --> 0:03:42,000
in a small town in the western desert of Utah.

73
0:03:43.113,000 --> 0:03:46,000
On the ranch, you learned that nothing takes priority

74
0:03:46.684,000 --> 0:03:47,000
over caring for the cattle,

75
0:03:48.71,000 --> 0:03:5,000
something always needs fixing

76
0:03:50.904,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and most importantly,

77
0:03:52.752,000 --> 0:03:54,000
hard work makes the world right.

78
0:03:55.805,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It was through that lens that I would see homeless people.

79
0:03:58.642,000 --> 0:04:01,000
When I was a teenager, our family would go into Salt Lake City,

80
0:04:01.685,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and I would see these homeless people -- "hobos" we called them then --

81
0:04:05.169,000 --> 0:04:06,000
sitting around on the street,

82
0:04:06.599,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and I would think,

83
0:04:07.788,000 --> 0:04:11,000
"You lazy bums, get a job. Pull yourself up by the bootstraps."

84
0:04:13.926,000 --> 0:04:15,000
After high school, I left the ranch,

85
0:04:16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
graduated from college,

86
0:04:18.116,000 --> 0:04:21,000
went to work for Ford Motor Company for several years,

87
0:04:21.691,000 --> 0:04:24,000
then got a job at the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints

88
0:04:25.015,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and moved back to Salt Lake City.

89
0:04:27.62,000 --> 0:04:29,000
During that employment, I had the opportunity to be loaned out

90
0:04:30.633,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to the state's largest homeless shelter

91
0:04:32.576,000 --> 0:04:34,000
to assist them in developing and improving

92
0:04:34.666,000 --> 0:04:36,000
their financial and management capabilities.

93
0:04:37.61,000 --> 0:04:41,000
While there, I became aware of a new approach

94
0:04:41.879,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to dealing with homeless individuals

95
0:04:44.09,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and drug addicts.

96
0:04:46.486,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It was called the harm reduction model,

97
0:04:48.996,000 --> 0:04:51,000
and it consisted of passing out clean needles and condoms.

98
0:04:52.633,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And I thought, "Now that is one stupid idea."

99
0:04:55.365,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:56.612,000 --> 0:04:58,000
"That's just going to encourage them to continue that behavior.

101
0:04:59.631,000 --> 0:05:,000
Just tell them to stop."

102
0:05:03.323,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Several years later, I read some of the early 10-year plans

103
0:05:06.341,000 --> 0:05:07,000
to end chronic homelessness

104
0:05:07.74,000 --> 0:05:08,000
promoted by the federal government.

105
0:05:09.721,000 --> 0:05:11,000
As I read through those plans, and I thought,

106
0:05:13.041,000 --> 0:05:14,000
"Pfft! This is unrealistic.

107
0:05:14.72,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You can't end homelessness.

108
0:05:16.271,000 --> 0:05:19,000
There's too many personal choices and factors beyond our control."

109
0:05:21.724,000 --> 0:05:23,000
My perspective changed, however,

110
0:05:24.242,000 --> 0:05:26,000
when I attended a conference in 2003,

111
0:05:27.213,000 --> 0:05:31,000
where I learned the reason behind the 10-year plan.

112
0:05:31.626,000 --> 0:05:35,000
First was this small population of the homeless group

113
0:05:35.799,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that was 15 percent and were very expensive.

114
0:05:39.216,000 --> 0:05:4,000
That made sense

115
0:05:40.541,000 --> 0:05:41,000
for a conservative state like Utah.

116
0:05:43.663,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The second insight was learning about this Housing First,

117
0:05:47.064,000 --> 0:05:48,000
or low-barrier housing.

118
0:05:48.933,000 --> 0:05:5,000
There had been an agency in New York City

119
0:05:51.086,000 --> 0:05:54,000
that had been inviting mentally ill homeless individuals

120
0:05:54.296,000 --> 0:05:57,000
to move directly from the street into housing.

121
0:05:58.487,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And they were also allowed to continue to use drugs and to drink,

122
0:06:02.736,000 --> 0:06:03,000
just like we can in our homes.

123
0:06:04.401,000 --> 0:06:08,000
They were, in addition, offered services -- not required to use them --

124
0:06:09.149,000 --> 0:06:1,000
by on-site case managers

125
0:06:10.576,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to assist them to adjust to their new living arrangements

126
0:06:13.481,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and to stabilize their lives.

127
0:06:15.644,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They were using the harm reduction model.

128
0:06:19.322,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And despite my initial low expectations about hearing about this model,

129
0:06:24.355,000 --> 0:06:26,000
they were having an astonishing success rate:

130
0:06:26.749,000 --> 0:06:3,000
85 percent were still housed after 12 months.

131
0:06:31.38,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The third insight

132
0:06:33.434,000 --> 0:06:36,000
was the importance of developing a trusting relationship.

133
0:06:37.239,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Because of the abuse these individuals have had

134
0:06:40.447,000 --> 0:06:41,000
throughout most of their lives,

135
0:06:42.455,000 --> 0:06:44,000
they hardly trust anybody,

136
0:06:46.031,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and the clean needles and condoms and low-barrier housing

137
0:06:50.138,000 --> 0:06:53,000
was a means to begin to develop a relationship of trust.

138
0:06:55.27,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Vital.

139
0:06:59.472,000 --> 0:07:01,000
So as I flew home from this conference,

140
0:07:03.048,000 --> 0:07:05,000
sitting in the plane looking out the window,

141
0:07:06.121,000 --> 0:07:09,000
I realized that my understanding and perspective about homelessness

142
0:07:09.928,000 --> 0:07:1,000
was shifting.

143
0:07:12.07,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And as I stared out that window,

144
0:07:13.965,000 --> 0:07:15,000
this very strong feeling and thought came to me

145
0:07:16.828,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that if there's any state in the union

146
0:07:18.801,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that could end chronic homelessness,

147
0:07:20.81,000 --> 0:07:21,000
it was the state of Utah,

148
0:07:23.155,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because there's an underlying feeling

149
0:07:25.981,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and desire and willingness to collaborate to serve our neighbors,

150
0:07:30.811,000 --> 0:07:32,000
including those who are homeless.

151
0:07:35.376,000 --> 0:07:39,000
A new vision was becoming clear to me how this could be done.

152
0:07:41.214,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Now, those of us that attended the conference said,

153
0:07:43.688,000 --> 0:07:44,000
"Yeah, these models will work in Utah."

154
0:07:45.613,000 --> 0:07:47,000
But when we got back home, there were many who said,

155
0:07:48.1,000 --> 0:07:51,000
"Nah, those aren't going to work. They won't succeed here."

156
0:07:51.256,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But there was, however, an affordable housing organization

157
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
who was willing to build our first 100 units.

158
0:07:58.28,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But they had concerns about having 100 chronically homeless people

159
0:08:01.787,000 --> 0:08:02,000
in one location.

160
0:08:03.594,000 --> 0:08:06,000
To address that concern, we decided to create a pilot

161
0:08:08.097,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to test that idea while we built the first 100 units.

162
0:08:11.589,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We would use existing units scattered throughout Salt Lake City.

163
0:08:16.523,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Then we debated:

164
0:08:17.968,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Should we select fairly high-functioning homeless persons

165
0:08:21.784,000 --> 0:08:23,000
or the most challenging ones we could find?

166
0:08:24.693,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And this is where my background on the ranch came into play.

167
0:08:28.753,000 --> 0:08:3,000
Back then, my mother cooked our meals

168
0:08:31.25,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and heated the water for our weekly bath

169
0:08:34.342,000 --> 0:08:36,000
on a wood-burning and coal-burning stove.

170
0:08:37.663,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And after chopping wood for that stove all those years,

171
0:08:40.77,000 --> 0:08:42,000
I'd learned to chop the big end of the log first,

172
0:08:43.175,000 --> 0:08:44,000
when I had the most energy.

173
0:08:45.907,000 --> 0:08:48,000
We decided to use the "big end of the log first" approach

174
0:08:49.68,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and selected 17 of the most challenging,

175
0:08:53.051,000 --> 0:08:56,000
difficult, chronically homeless people we could find,

176
0:08:56.903,000 --> 0:08:59,000
because we knew we would learn the most from them.

177
0:09:01.438,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Twenty-two months later,

178
0:09:04.287,000 --> 0:09:06,000
all 17 were still housed,

179
0:09:09.148,000 --> 0:09:1,000
including Keta,

180
0:09:10.932,000 --> 0:09:12,000
who today, 11 years later,

181
0:09:13.615,000 --> 0:09:15,000
is sleeping in her own bed

182
0:09:15.848,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and is sober.

183
0:09:18.45,000 --> 0:09:21,000
At the end of this pilot, one of the young case managers said,

184
0:09:21.516,000 --> 0:09:23,000
"We used to debate up at our university classes

185
0:09:23.836,000 --> 0:09:25,000
which theory of case management was the most effective.

186
0:09:27.275,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Now our theory of case management is:

187
0:09:29.673,000 --> 0:09:32,000
anything necessary to keep them housed."

188
0:09:33.868,000 --> 0:09:34,000
We became believers,

189
0:09:35.713,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and built hundreds of units over those next 10 years,

190
0:09:39.221,000 --> 0:09:43,000
leading to the reduction of our statewide chronic homeless population

191
0:09:43.319,000 --> 0:09:44,000
of 91 percent.

192
0:09:45.445,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Now, who are homeless people?

193
0:09:48.116,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Many people just want them to go away, to disappear,

194
0:09:51.191,000 --> 0:09:52,000
not disrupt our lives.

195
0:09:53.427,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Through this 10-year, 11-year process, I gained many insights

196
0:09:56.692,000 --> 0:09:57,000
of why people become homeless.

197
0:09:59.247,000 --> 0:10:01,000
One of those insights came to me a few years ago

198
0:10:01.659,000 --> 0:10:03,000
when I was visiting with our medical outreach team.

199
0:10:04.294,000 --> 0:10:05,000
These are our frontline workers

200
0:10:05.842,000 --> 0:10:07,000
that go out and visit the street homeless and the prostitutes

201
0:10:08.724,000 --> 0:10:1,000
to check on their medical health.

202
0:10:12.588,000 --> 0:10:13,000
One of the team members mentioned

203
0:10:14.184,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that eight of the prostitutes had given birth to 31 children

204
0:10:18.132,000 --> 0:10:2,000
that had become wards of the state.

205
0:10:20.592,000 --> 0:10:22,000
They also shared that some of the pimps were their husbands,

206
0:10:23.548,000 --> 0:10:24,000
and worse yet,

207
0:10:24.766,000 --> 0:10:25,000
their parents.

208
0:10:28.151,000 --> 0:10:29,000
These prostitutes,

209
0:10:29.964,000 --> 0:10:32,000
in their late teens, 20s, early 30s,

210
0:10:33.114,000 --> 0:10:36,000
were expected to earn enough money a day to support

211
0:10:36.653,000 --> 0:10:38,000
a hundred-dollar-a-day heroin addiction,

212
0:10:38.858,000 --> 0:10:39,000
their living expenses

213
0:10:40.239,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and their pimp.

214
0:10:42.615,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And with unprotected sex, they were paid more,

215
0:10:45.498,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and predictably, this would lead to a pregnancy.

216
0:10:50.219,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Children born under these circumstances many times end up becoming homeless.

217
0:10:55.763,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And it's not helpful to look at those born under those circumstances,

218
0:11:00.452,000 --> 0:11:03,000
or a parent that makes their child a drug addict at age seven,

219
0:11:04.042,000 --> 0:11:06,000
or a generation of babies born through drug addiction,

220
0:11:07.99,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and not feel some despair.

221
0:11:10.184,000 --> 0:11:14,000
For me, I believe every person is of value,

222
0:11:15.379,000 --> 0:11:16,000
no matter who you are.

223
0:11:18.827,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And it's not helpful to look at somebody with this start in life

224
0:11:22.905,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and blame them for where they are.

225
0:11:27.843,000 --> 0:11:31,000
(Applause)

226
0:11:33.666,000 --> 0:11:37,000
No one grows up saying, "My goal in life is to become homeless."

227
0:11:39.798,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And that's the beauty of the harm reduction and Housing First model.

228
0:11:44.877,000 --> 0:11:47,000
It recognizes the complexities of the different factors

229
0:11:48.636,000 --> 0:11:49,000
that can shape a human life.

230
0:11:50.57,000 --> 0:11:53,000
These models meet people where they are,

231
0:11:54.74,000 --> 0:11:55,000
not where we are

232
0:11:56.807,000 --> 0:11:57,000
or where we think they should be.

233
0:12:00.891,000 --> 0:12:05,000
The pilot we did with our 17 taught us many lessons.

234
0:12:06.953,000 --> 0:12:08,000
When people have been living on the street for many years,

235
0:12:09.777,000 --> 0:12:1,000
moving back into housing

236
0:12:12.218,000 --> 0:12:14,000
requires lots of things to learn.

237
0:12:15.57,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And Donald

238
0:12:18.417,000 --> 0:12:2,000
taught us some of these transition lessons.

239
0:12:21.068,000 --> 0:12:23,000
His case manager asked him why he had not turned up the heat

240
0:12:24.027,000 --> 0:12:25,000
in his cold apartment.

241
0:12:25.986,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Donald said, "How do you do that?"

242
0:12:28.412,000 --> 0:12:3,000
He was shown how to use a thermostat.

243
0:12:31.694,000 --> 0:12:32,000
The case manager also observed

244
0:12:33.636,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that he was heating the beans in the can on the stove,

245
0:12:37.075,000 --> 0:12:39,000
like he had done over the campfires for many years.

246
0:12:40.902,000 --> 0:12:42,000
He was shown how to use pots and pans.

247
0:12:43.85,000 --> 0:12:46,000
We also learned that he had a sister that he had not seen in 25 years,

248
0:12:47.437,000 --> 0:12:48,000
who thought he was dead.

249
0:12:49.643,000 --> 0:12:5,000
She was happy to learn otherwise,

250
0:12:51.534,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and they were soon reconnected.

251
0:12:53.833,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Hundreds of people like Keta and Donald are now housed

252
0:12:58.095,000 --> 0:13:,000
and reconnecting with their families.

253
0:13:00.98,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Also, many of our communities are incurring

254
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
fewer emergency services costs.

255
0:13:06.919,000 --> 0:13:08,000
I have learned over and over again

256
0:13:10.395,000 --> 0:13:13,000
that when you listen to somebody's story with an open heart,

257
0:13:14.466,000 --> 0:13:16,000
walk in their shoes with them,

258
0:13:16.707,000 --> 0:13:18,000
you can't help but love and care for them

259
0:13:20.721,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and want to serve them.

260
0:13:24.595,000 --> 0:13:26,000
This is why I'm committed

261
0:13:27.253,000 --> 0:13:32,000
to continuing to bring hope and support to our homeless citizens,

262
0:13:32.751,000 --> 0:13:35,000
who I consider to be my brothers and sisters.

263
0:13:36.735,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Thank you.

264
0:13:37.915,000 --> 0:13:42,000
(Applause)

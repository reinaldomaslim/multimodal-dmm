1
0:00:12.737,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I would like to show you how

2
0:00:15.646,000 --> 0:00:17,000
architecture has helped

3
0:00:18.523,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to change the life of my community

4
0:00:21.618,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and has opened opportunities to hope.

5
0:00:26.433,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I am a native of Burkina Faso.

6
0:00:29.392,000 --> 0:00:32,000
According to the World Bank, Burkina Faso

7
0:00:32.61,000 --> 0:00:35,000
is one of the poorest countries in the world,

8
0:00:35.659,000 --> 0:00:37,000
but what does it look like

9
0:00:38.506,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to grow up in a place like that?

10
0:00:41.925,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I am an example of that.

11
0:00:44.485,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I was born in a little village called Gando.

12
0:00:48.393,000 --> 0:00:52,000
In Gando, there was no electricity,

13
0:00:52.885,000 --> 0:00:56,000
no access to clean drinking water, and no school.

14
0:00:57.099,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But my father wanted me

15
0:00:59.923,000 --> 0:01:01,000
to learn how to read and write.

16
0:01:01.972,000 --> 0:01:05,000
For this reason, I had to leave my family

17
0:01:06.02,000 --> 0:01:09,000
when I was seven and to stay in a city

18
0:01:09.914,000 --> 0:01:1,000
far away from my village

19
0:01:11.902,000 --> 0:01:14,000
with no contact with my family.

20
0:01:15.579,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In this place I sat

21
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in a class like that

22
0:01:21.226,000 --> 0:01:24,000
with more than 150 other kids,

23
0:01:24.978,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and for six years.

24
0:01:27.47,000 --> 0:01:31,000
In this time, it just happened to me to come to school

25
0:01:31.55,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to realize that my classmate died.

26
0:01:37.245,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Today, not so much has changed.

27
0:01:41.758,000 --> 0:01:45,000
There is still no electricity in my village.

28
0:01:46.211,000 --> 0:01:48,000
People still are dying in Burkina Faso,

29
0:01:48.673,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and access to clean drinking water

30
0:01:52.276,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is still a big problem.

31
0:01:56.499,000 --> 0:02:03,000
I had luck. I was lucky, because this is a fact of life

32
0:02:04.051,000 --> 0:02:06,000
when you grow up in a place like that.

33
0:02:06.803,000 --> 0:02:08,000
But I was lucky.

34
0:02:09.172,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I had a scholarship.

35
0:02:11.256,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I could go to Germany to study.

36
0:02:15.466,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So now, I suppose,

37
0:02:19.371,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I don't need to explain to you how great a privilege

38
0:02:24.045,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it is for me to be standing before you today.

39
0:02:28.502,000 --> 0:02:32,000
From Gando, my home village in Burkina Faso,

40
0:02:32.874,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to Berlin in Germany to become an architect

41
0:02:37.18,000 --> 0:02:42,000
is a big, big step.

42
0:02:42.345,000 --> 0:02:47,000
But what to do with this privilege?

43
0:02:47.997,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Since I was a student, I wanted to open up

44
0:02:51.952,000 --> 0:02:53,000
better opportunities to other kids in Gando.

45
0:02:54.595,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I just wanted to use my skills and build a school.

46
0:02:57.51,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But how do you do it when you're still a student

47
0:03:00.494,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and you don't have money?

48
0:03:02.576,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Oh yes, I started to make drawings

49
0:03:05.078,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and asked for money.

50
0:03:07.06,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Fundraising was not an easy task.

51
0:03:11.039,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I even asked my classmates

52
0:03:13.838,000 --> 0:03:16,000
to spend less money on coffee and cigarettes,

53
0:03:17.016,000 --> 0:03:2,000
but to sponsor my school project.

54
0:03:20.984,000 --> 0:03:23,000
In real wonder, two years later,

55
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I was able to collect 50,000 U.S. dollars.

56
0:03:30.534,000 --> 0:03:32,000
When I came home to Gando

57
0:03:33.497,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to bring the good news,

58
0:03:35.022,000 --> 0:03:39,000
my people were over the moon,

59
0:03:39.171,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but when they realized

60
0:03:41.792,000 --> 0:03:43,000
that I was planning to use clay,

61
0:03:44.636,000 --> 0:03:46,000
they were shocked.

62
0:03:46.719,000 --> 0:03:49,000
"A clay building is not able to stand a rainy season,

63
0:03:50.262,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and Francis wants us to use it and build a school.

64
0:03:55.371,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Is this the reason why he spent so much time

65
0:03:58.135,000 --> 0:04:,000
in Europe studying

66
0:04:00.148,000 --> 0:04:04,000
instead of working in the field with us?"

67
0:04:04.247,000 --> 0:04:08,000
My people build all the time with clay,

68
0:04:08.54,000 --> 0:04:12,000
but they don't see any innovation with mud.

69
0:04:13.461,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So I had to convince everybody.

70
0:04:15.65,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I started to speak with the community,

71
0:04:19.033,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and I could convince everybody,

72
0:04:21.496,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and we could start to work.

73
0:04:24.506,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And the women, the men,

74
0:04:26.27,000 --> 0:04:28,000
everybody from the village,

75
0:04:28.315,000 --> 0:04:3,000
was part of this building process.

76
0:04:30.332,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I was allowed to use even traditional techniques.

77
0:04:34.041,000 --> 0:04:36,000
So clay floor for example,

78
0:04:36.204,000 --> 0:04:4,000
the young men come and stand like that, beating,

79
0:04:40.6,000 --> 0:04:41,000
hours for hours,

80
0:04:42.196,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and then their mothers came,

81
0:04:43.908,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and they are beating in this position,

82
0:04:47.642,000 --> 0:04:51,000
for hours, giving water and beating.

83
0:04:52.258,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And then the polishers come.

84
0:04:53.886,000 --> 0:04:58,000
They start polishing it with a stone for hours.

85
0:04:58.944,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And then you have this result,

86
0:05:03.901,000 --> 0:05:06,000
very fine, like a baby bottom.

87
0:05:07.21,000 --> 0:05:08,000
(Laughter)

88
0:05:08.983,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's not photoshopped. (Laughter)

89
0:05:14.248,000 --> 0:05:16,000
This is the school, built with the community.

90
0:05:17.232,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The walls are totally made out

91
0:05:19.022,000 --> 0:05:23,000
of compressed clay blocks from Gando.

92
0:05:23.122,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The roof structure is made

93
0:05:26.276,000 --> 0:05:28,000
with cheap steel bars

94
0:05:29.098,000 --> 0:05:32,000
normally hiding inside concrete.

95
0:05:32.994,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And the classroom, the ceiling is made

96
0:05:36.062,000 --> 0:05:38,000
out of both of them used together.

97
0:05:38.817,000 --> 0:05:4,000
In this school, there was a simple idea:

98
0:05:41.727,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to create comfort in a classroom.

99
0:05:45.437,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Don't forget, it can be 45 degrees in Burkina Faso,

100
0:05:50.608,000 --> 0:05:51,000
so with simple ventilation,

101
0:05:52.542,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I wanted to make the classroom

102
0:05:54.592,000 --> 0:05:56,000
good for teaching and learning.

103
0:05:57.201,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And this is the project today,

104
0:06:00.046,000 --> 0:06:03,000
12 years old, still in best condition.

105
0:06:03.68,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And the kids, they love it.

106
0:06:09.936,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And for me and my community,

107
0:06:12.791,000 --> 0:06:15,000
this project was a huge success.

108
0:06:16.446,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It has opened up opportunities

109
0:06:19.348,000 --> 0:06:21,000
to do more projects in Gando.

110
0:06:21.939,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So I could do a lot of projects,

111
0:06:24.877,000 --> 0:06:26,000
and here I am going to share with you

112
0:06:27.201,000 --> 0:06:29,000
only three of them.

113
0:06:29.381,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The first one is the school extension, of course.

114
0:06:33.177,000 --> 0:06:36,000
How do you explain drawings and engineering

115
0:06:36.492,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to people who are neither able to read nor write?

116
0:06:40.144,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I started to build a prototype like that.

117
0:06:43.091,000 --> 0:06:45,000
The innovation was to build a clay vault.

118
0:06:46.077,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So then, I jumped on the top like that,

119
0:06:49.408,000 --> 0:06:51,000
with my team, and it works.

120
0:06:51.72,000 --> 0:06:53,000
The community is looking. It still works.

121
0:06:53.947,000 --> 0:06:55,000
So we can build. (Laughter)

122
0:06:56.805,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And we kept building, and that is the result.

123
0:07:00.688,000 --> 0:07:03,000
The kids are happy, and they love it.

124
0:07:04.322,000 --> 0:07:08,000
The community is very proud. We made it.

125
0:07:08.483,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And even animals, like these donkeys,

126
0:07:12.624,000 --> 0:07:13,000
love our buildings.

127
0:07:14.384,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Laughter)

128
0:07:18.031,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The next project is the library in Gando.

129
0:07:22.698,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And see now, we tried to introduce

130
0:07:26.361,000 --> 0:07:28,000
different ideas in our buildings,

131
0:07:28.876,000 --> 0:07:31,000
but we often don't have so much material.

132
0:07:32.707,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Something we have in Gando are clay pots.

133
0:07:36.11,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We wanted to use them to create openings.

134
0:07:39.431,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So we just bring them like you can see

135
0:07:41.541,000 --> 0:07:43,000
to the building site.

136
0:07:43.967,000 --> 0:07:45,000
we start cutting them,

137
0:07:46.133,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and then we place them on top of the roof

138
0:07:49.064,000 --> 0:07:51,000
before we pour the concrete,

139
0:07:51.643,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and you have this result.

140
0:07:53.654,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The openings are letting the hot air out

141
0:07:56.564,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and light in.

142
0:07:58.403,000 --> 0:08:,000
Very simple.

143
0:08:00.476,000 --> 0:08:02,000
My most recent project in Gando

144
0:08:03.314,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is a high school project.

145
0:08:05.332,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I would like to share with you this.

146
0:08:07.265,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The innovation in this project

147
0:08:09.51,000 --> 0:08:13,000
is to cast mud like you cast concrete.

148
0:08:14.253,000 --> 0:08:16,000
How do you cast mud?

149
0:08:16.378,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We start making a lot of mortars, like you can see,

150
0:08:19.644,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and when everything is ready,

151
0:08:21.767,000 --> 0:08:23,000
when you know what is the best recipe

152
0:08:23.904,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and the best form,

153
0:08:25.098,000 --> 0:08:27,000
you start working with the community.

154
0:08:27.749,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And sometimes I can leave.

155
0:08:29.895,000 --> 0:08:3,000
They will do it themselves.

156
0:08:31.654,000 --> 0:08:34,000
I came to speak to you like that.

157
0:08:35.206,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Another factor in Gando is rain.

158
0:08:37.897,000 --> 0:08:38,000
When the rains come,

159
0:08:39.721,000 --> 0:08:41,000
we hurry up to protect our fragile walls

160
0:08:42.009,000 --> 0:08:45,000
against the rain.

161
0:08:45.061,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Don't confound with Christo and Jeanne-Claude.

162
0:08:48.573,000 --> 0:08:5,000
It is simply how we protect our walls.

163
0:08:51.138,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Laughter)

164
0:08:52.607,000 --> 0:08:54,000
The rain in Burkina comes very fast,

165
0:08:55.485,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and after that, you have floods

166
0:08:58.05,000 --> 0:09:,000
everywhere in the country.

167
0:09:00.995,000 --> 0:09:03,000
But for us, the rain is good.

168
0:09:04.045,000 --> 0:09:07,000
It brings sand and gravel to the river

169
0:09:07.95,000 --> 0:09:09,000
we need to use to build.

170
0:09:10.221,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We just wait for the rain to go.

171
0:09:12.122,000 --> 0:09:15,000
We take the sand, we mix it with clay,

172
0:09:15.716,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and we keep building.

173
0:09:18.502,000 --> 0:09:19,000
That is it.

174
0:09:20.307,000 --> 0:09:23,000
The Gando project was always connected to training the people,

175
0:09:23.401,000 --> 0:09:26,000
because I just wanted, one day

176
0:09:26.893,000 --> 0:09:28,000
when I fall down and die,

177
0:09:29.796,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that at least one person from Gando

178
0:09:32.48,000 --> 0:09:35,000
keeps doing this work.

179
0:09:36.222,000 --> 0:09:38,000
But you will be surprised. I'm still alive.

180
0:09:39.065,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Laughter)

181
0:09:40.615,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And my people now can use their skills

182
0:09:43.792,000 --> 0:09:46,000
to earn money themselves.

183
0:09:48.83,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Usually, for a young man from Gando to earn money,

184
0:09:52.793,000 --> 0:09:54,000
you have to leave the country

185
0:09:54.889,000 --> 0:09:57,000
to the city, sometimes leave the country

186
0:09:58.132,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and some never come back,

187
0:10:00.124,000 --> 0:10:03,000
making the community weaker.

188
0:10:03.568,000 --> 0:10:06,000
But now they can stay in the country

189
0:10:07.245,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and work on different building sites

190
0:10:09.437,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and earn money to feed their family.

191
0:10:11.324,000 --> 0:10:14,000
There's a new quality in this work.

192
0:10:16.278,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Yes, you know it.

193
0:10:18.474,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I have won a lot of awards through this work.

194
0:10:23.128,000 --> 0:10:26,000
For sure, it has opened opportunities.

195
0:10:26.809,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I have become myself known.

196
0:10:29.201,000 --> 0:10:33,000
But the reason why I do what I do

197
0:10:34.091,000 --> 0:10:37,000
is my community.

198
0:10:37.566,000 --> 0:10:39,000
When I was a kid,

199
0:10:39.68,000 --> 0:10:4,000
I was going to school,

200
0:10:41.463,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I was coming back every holiday to Gando.

201
0:10:45.494,000 --> 0:10:47,000
By the end of every holidays,

202
0:10:47.637,000 --> 0:10:5,000
I had to say goodbye to the community,

203
0:10:50.681,000 --> 0:10:53,000
going from one compound to another one.

204
0:10:54.427,000 --> 0:10:59,000
All women in Gando will open their clothes like that

205
0:10:59.658,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and give me the last penny.

206
0:11:03.593,000 --> 0:11:08,000
In my culture, this is a symbol of deep affection.

207
0:11:08.714,000 --> 0:11:11,000
As a seven-year-old guy, I was impressed.

208
0:11:11.897,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I just asked my mother one day,

209
0:11:14.487,000 --> 0:11:16,000
"Why do all these women love me so much?"

210
0:11:17.23,000 --> 0:11:18,000
(Laughter)

211
0:11:18.979,000 --> 0:11:2,000
She just answered,

212
0:11:21.314,000 --> 0:11:24,000
"They are contributing to pay for your education

213
0:11:25.095,000 --> 0:11:28,000
hoping that you will be successful

214
0:11:28.44,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and one day come back and help

215
0:11:31.538,000 --> 0:11:35,000
improve the quality of life of the community."

216
0:11:35.57,000 --> 0:11:39,000
I hope now that I was able to make my community proud

217
0:11:40.448,000 --> 0:11:41,000
through this work,

218
0:11:42.321,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and I hope I was able to prove you the power

219
0:11:46.133,000 --> 0:11:47,000
of community,

220
0:11:47.772,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and to show you that architecture

221
0:11:51.499,000 --> 0:11:55,000
can be inspiring for communities

222
0:11:56.188,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to shape their own future.

223
0:11:58.441,000 --> 0:12:,000
Merci beaucoup. (Applause)

224
0:12:00.828,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

225
0:12:05.169,000 --> 0:12:06,000
Thank you. Thank you. (Applause)

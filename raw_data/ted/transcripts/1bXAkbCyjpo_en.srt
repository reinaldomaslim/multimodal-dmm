1
0:00:12.812,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So I started working

2
0:00:14.449,000 --> 0:00:15,000
with refugees because I wanted

3
0:00:16.333,000 --> 0:00:18,000
to make a difference,

4
0:00:18.673,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and making a difference starts

5
0:00:20.08,000 --> 0:00:22,000
with telling their stories.

6
0:00:22.436,000 --> 0:00:23,000
So when I meet refugees,

7
0:00:23.926,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I always ask them questions.

8
0:00:26.726,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Who bombed your house?

9
0:00:29.044,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Who killed your son?

10
0:00:31.697,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Did the rest of your family make it out alive?

11
0:00:35.741,000 --> 0:00:36,000
How are you coping

12
0:00:37.727,000 --> 0:00:39,000
in your life in exile?

13
0:00:40.258,000 --> 0:00:43,000
But there's one question that always seems to me

14
0:00:43.261,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to be most revealing, and that is:

15
0:00:45.725,000 --> 0:00:47,000
What did you take?

16
0:00:47.907,000 --> 0:00:49,000
What was that most important thing

17
0:00:50.157,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that you had to take with you

18
0:00:52.229,000 --> 0:00:55,000
when the bombs were exploding in your town,

19
0:00:55.635,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and the armed gangs were approaching your house?

20
0:01:00.06,000 --> 0:01:02,000
A Syrian refugee boy I know

21
0:01:02.665,000 --> 0:01:04,000
told me that he didn't hesitate

22
0:01:05.355,000 --> 0:01:08,000
when his life was in imminent danger.

23
0:01:09.145,000 --> 0:01:11,000
He took his high school diploma,

24
0:01:12.126,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and later he told me why.

25
0:01:14.055,000 --> 0:01:17,000
He said, "I took my high school diploma

26
0:01:17.263,000 --> 0:01:2,000
because my life depended on it."

27
0:01:20.469,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And he would risk his life to get that diploma.

28
0:01:23.698,000 --> 0:01:26,000
On his way to school, he would dodge snipers.

29
0:01:27.38,000 --> 0:01:29,000
His classroom sometimes shook

30
0:01:29.895,000 --> 0:01:32,000
with the sound of bombs and shelling,

31
0:01:33.129,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and his mother told me,

32
0:01:35.936,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"Every day, I would say to him every morning,

33
0:01:39.005,000 --> 0:01:41,000
'Honey, please don't go to school.'"

34
0:01:41.931,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And when he insisted, she said,

35
0:01:45.39,000 --> 0:01:48,000
"I would hug him as if it were for the last time."

36
0:01:49.362,000 --> 0:01:51,000
But he said to his mother,

37
0:01:51.392,000 --> 0:01:52,000
"We're all afraid,

38
0:01:53.237,000 --> 0:01:55,000
but our determination to graduate

39
0:01:56.128,000 --> 0:01:59,000
is stronger than our fear."

40
0:01:59.462,000 --> 0:02:02,000
But one day, the family got terrible news.

41
0:02:02.798,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Hany's aunt, his uncle and his cousin

42
0:02:05.532,000 --> 0:02:07,000
were murdered in their homes for refusing

43
0:02:08.221,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to leave their house.

44
0:02:09.215,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Their throats were slit.

45
0:02:12.08,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It was time to flee.

46
0:02:14.711,000 --> 0:02:17,000
They left that day, right away, in their car,

47
0:02:17.725,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Hany hidden in the back because they were facing

48
0:02:19.586,000 --> 0:02:22,000
checkpoints of menacing soldiers.

49
0:02:23.496,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And they would cross the border into Lebanon,

50
0:02:27.208,000 --> 0:02:29,000
where they would find peace.

51
0:02:29.904,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But they would begin a life of grueling hardship

52
0:02:33.586,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and monotony.

53
0:02:36.59,000 --> 0:02:38,000
They had no choice but to build a shack

54
0:02:39.289,000 --> 0:02:4,000
on the side of a muddy field,

55
0:02:40.622,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and this is Hany's brother Ashraf,

56
0:02:42.94,000 --> 0:02:43,000
who plays outside.

57
0:02:44.678,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And that day, they joined

58
0:02:47.1,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the biggest population of refugees in the world,

59
0:02:52.304,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in a country, Lebanon, that is tiny.

60
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It only has four million citizens,

61
0:02:57.981,000 --> 0:03:,000
and there are one million Syrian refugees living there.

62
0:03:01.551,000 --> 0:03:05,000
There's not a town, a city or a village

63
0:03:05.645,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that is not host to Syrian refugees.

64
0:03:10.392,000 --> 0:03:13,000
This is generosity and humanity

65
0:03:13.587,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that is remarkable.

66
0:03:17.961,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Think about it this way, proportionately.

67
0:03:20.955,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It would be as if

68
0:03:22.711,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the entire population of Germany,

69
0:03:25.702,000 --> 0:03:26,000
80 million people,

70
0:03:27.567,000 --> 0:03:32,000
would flee to the United States in just three years.

71
0:03:32.957,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Half of the entire population of Syria

72
0:03:36.118,000 --> 0:03:38,000
is now uprooted,

73
0:03:38.548,000 --> 0:03:39,000
most of them inside the country.

74
0:03:40.303,000 --> 0:03:42,000
Six and a half million people

75
0:03:42.598,000 --> 0:03:44,000
have fled for their lives.

76
0:03:45.32,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Over and well over three million people

77
0:03:48.21,000 --> 0:03:49,000
have crossed the borders

78
0:03:49.932,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and have found sanctuary in the neighboring countries,

79
0:03:53.475,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and only a small proportion, as you see,

80
0:03:56.4,000 --> 0:04:,000
have moved on to Europe.

81
0:04:00.534,000 --> 0:04:02,000
What I find most worrying

82
0:04:03.205,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is that half of all Syrian refugees are children.

83
0:04:07.131,000 --> 0:04:09,000
I took this picture of this little girl.

84
0:04:09.369,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It was just two hours after she had arrived

85
0:04:12.294,000 --> 0:04:16,000
after a long trek from Syria into Jordan.

86
0:04:16.636,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And most troubling of all

87
0:04:20.061,000 --> 0:04:23,000
is that only 20 percent of Syrian refugee children

88
0:04:23.802,000 --> 0:04:26,000
are in school in Lebanon.

89
0:04:27.277,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And yet, Syrian refugee children,

90
0:04:30.21,000 --> 0:04:32,000
all refugee children tell us

91
0:04:32.508,000 --> 0:04:37,000
education is the most important thing in their lives.

92
0:04:37.574,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Why? Because it allows them to think of their future

93
0:04:41.755,000 --> 0:04:44,000
rather than the nightmare of their past.

94
0:04:45.15,000 --> 0:04:5,000
It allows them to think of hope rather than hatred.

95
0:04:50.784,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I'm reminded of a recent visit I took

96
0:04:52.813,000 --> 0:04:55,000
to a Syrian refugee camp in northern Iraq,

97
0:04:56.39,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and I met this girl,

98
0:04:58.202,000 --> 0:04:59,000
and I thought, "She's beautiful,"

99
0:04:59.979,000 --> 0:05:,000
and I went up to her and asked her,

100
0:05:01.686,000 --> 0:05:02,000
"Can I take your picture?"

101
0:05:03.634,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And she said yes,

102
0:05:05.333,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but she refused to smile.

103
0:05:08.37,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I think she couldn't,

104
0:05:11.419,000 --> 0:05:14,000
because I think she must realize that she represents

105
0:05:14.925,000 --> 0:05:18,000
a lost generation of Syrian refugee children,

106
0:05:19.369,000 --> 0:05:23,000
a generation isolated and frustrated.

107
0:05:23.95,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And yet, look at what they fled:

108
0:05:27.496,000 --> 0:05:28,000
utter destruction,

109
0:05:29.335,000 --> 0:05:34,000
buildings, industries, schools, roads, homes.

110
0:05:34.914,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Hany's home was also destroyed.

111
0:05:37.593,000 --> 0:05:4,000
This will need to be rebuilt

112
0:05:40.806,000 --> 0:05:44,000
by architects, by engineers, by electricians.

113
0:05:45.637,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Communities will need teachers and lawyers

114
0:05:49.284,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and politicians interested in reconciliation

115
0:05:53.525,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and not revenge.

116
0:05:56.169,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Shouldn't this be rebuilt

117
0:05:57.924,000 --> 0:06:,000
by the people with the largest stake,

118
0:06:01.015,000 --> 0:06:06,000
the societies in exile, the refugees?

119
0:06:06.88,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Refugees have a lot of time

120
0:06:09.634,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to prepare for their return.

121
0:06:11.88,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You might imagine that being a refugee

122
0:06:14.595,000 --> 0:06:16,000
is just a temporary state.

123
0:06:17.103,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Well far from it.

124
0:06:20.044,000 --> 0:06:23,000
With wars going on and on,

125
0:06:23.56,000 --> 0:06:26,000
the average time a refugee will spend in exile

126
0:06:27.362,000 --> 0:06:3,000
is 17 years.

127
0:06:30.827,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Hany was into his second year in limbo

128
0:06:34.415,000 --> 0:06:36,000
when I went to visit him recently,

129
0:06:36.789,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and we conducted our entire conversation in English,

130
0:06:40.546,000 --> 0:06:41,000
which he confessed to me he learned

131
0:06:42.435,000 --> 0:06:45,000
from reading all of Dan Brown's novels

132
0:06:46.089,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and from listening to American rap.

133
0:06:50.444,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We also spent some nice moments of laughter

134
0:06:53.189,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and fun with his beloved brother Ashraf.

135
0:06:57.823,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But I'll never forget what he told me

136
0:06:59.444,000 --> 0:07:02,000
when we ended our conversation that day.

137
0:07:02.868,000 --> 0:07:04,000
He said to me,

138
0:07:05.281,000 --> 0:07:1,000
"If I am not a student, I am nothing."

139
0:07:10.81,000 --> 0:07:13,000
Hany is one of 50 million people

140
0:07:14.527,000 --> 0:07:17,000
uprooted in this world today.

141
0:07:18.105,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Never since World War II

142
0:07:20.884,000 --> 0:07:25,000
have so many people been forcibly displaced.

143
0:07:26.151,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So while we're making sweeping progress

144
0:07:28.78,000 --> 0:07:3,000
in human health,

145
0:07:30.881,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in technology, in education and design,

146
0:07:35.875,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we are doing dangerously little

147
0:07:39.238,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to help the victims

148
0:07:42.546,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and we are doing far too little

149
0:07:45.245,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to stop and prevent

150
0:07:47.281,000 --> 0:07:5,000
the wars that are driving them from their homes.

151
0:07:50.69,000 --> 0:07:54,000
And there are more and more victims.

152
0:07:55.133,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Every day, on average,

153
0:07:58.267,000 --> 0:08:,000
by the end of this day,

154
0:08:00.449,000 --> 0:08:03,000
32,000 people will be forcibly displaced

155
0:08:04.297,000 --> 0:08:06,000
from their homes —

156
0:08:06.332,000 --> 0:08:08,000
32,000 people.

157
0:08:11.271,000 --> 0:08:14,000
They flee across borders like this one.

158
0:08:15.02,000 --> 0:08:18,000
We captured this on the Syrian border to Jordan,

159
0:08:18.715,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and this is a typical day.

160
0:08:25.588,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Or they flee on unseaworthy and overcrowded boats,

161
0:08:30.492,000 --> 0:08:31,000
risking their lives in this case

162
0:08:32.292,000 --> 0:08:34,000
just to reach safety in Europe.

163
0:08:34.923,000 --> 0:08:35,000
This Syrian young man

164
0:08:36.638,000 --> 0:08:38,000
survived one of these boats that capsized —

165
0:08:39.424,000 --> 0:08:4,000
most of the people drowned —

166
0:08:41.047,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and he told us,

167
0:08:43.262,000 --> 0:08:47,000
"Syrians are just looking for a quiet place

168
0:08:47.421,000 --> 0:08:49,000
where nobody hurts you,

169
0:08:50.29,000 --> 0:08:52,000
where nobody humiliates you,

170
0:08:52.832,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and where nobody kills you."

171
0:08:55.543,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Well, I think that should be the minimum.

172
0:08:58.761,000 --> 0:09:01,000
How about a place of healing,

173
0:09:01.888,000 --> 0:09:02,000
of learning,

174
0:09:03.766,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and even opportunity?

175
0:09:08.832,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Americans and Europeans

176
0:09:10.856,000 --> 0:09:13,000
have the impression that proportionally

177
0:09:14.107,000 --> 0:09:16,000
huge numbers of refugees are coming

178
0:09:16.48,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to their country,

179
0:09:18.5,000 --> 0:09:2,000
but the reality is

180
0:09:20.642,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that 86 percent, the vast majority of refugees,

181
0:09:24.287,000 --> 0:09:26,000
are living in the developing world,

182
0:09:26.967,000 --> 0:09:3,000
in countries struggling with their own insecurity,

183
0:09:31.52,000 --> 0:09:35,000
with their own issues of helping their own populations

184
0:09:35.539,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and poverty.

185
0:09:37.662,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So wealthy countries in the world should recognize

186
0:09:40.935,000 --> 0:09:43,000
the humanity and the generosity of the countries

187
0:09:44.636,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that are hosting so many refugees.

188
0:09:48.754,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And all countries should make sure that no one

189
0:09:52.386,000 --> 0:09:54,000
fleeing war and persecution

190
0:09:54.939,000 --> 0:09:57,000
arrives at a closed border.

191
0:09:58.652,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Applause)

192
0:10:01.282,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Thank you.

193
0:10:06.2,000 --> 0:10:08,000
But there is something more that we can do

194
0:10:08.505,000 --> 0:10:12,000
than just simply helping refugees survive.

195
0:10:12.915,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We can help them thrive.

196
0:10:16.446,000 --> 0:10:19,000
We should think of refugee camps and communities

197
0:10:19.506,000 --> 0:10:23,000
as more than just temporary population centers

198
0:10:23.713,000 --> 0:10:25,000
where people languish

199
0:10:25.873,000 --> 0:10:27,000
waiting for the war to end.

200
0:10:28.782,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Rather, as centers of excellence,

201
0:10:32.511,000 --> 0:10:35,000
where refugees can triumph over their trauma

202
0:10:36.459,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and train for the day that they can go home

203
0:10:39.643,000 --> 0:10:42,000
as agents of positive change

204
0:10:42.724,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and social transformation.

205
0:10:47.122,000 --> 0:10:49,000
It makes so much sense,

206
0:10:49.508,000 --> 0:10:53,000
but I'm reminded of the terrible war in Somalia

207
0:10:53.817,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that has been raging on for 22 years.

208
0:10:57.741,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And imagine living in this camp.

209
0:11:00.25,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I visited this camp.

210
0:11:01.823,000 --> 0:11:02,000
It's in Djibouti, neighboring Somalia,

211
0:11:03.7,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and it was so remote

212
0:11:06.244,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that we had to take a helicopter to fly there.

213
0:11:08.685,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It was dusty and it was terribly hot.

214
0:11:12.131,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And we went to visit a school

215
0:11:14.425,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and started talking to the children,

216
0:11:16.342,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and then I saw this girl across the room

217
0:11:18.936,000 --> 0:11:19,000
who looked to me to be the same age

218
0:11:20.785,000 --> 0:11:23,000
as my own daughter, and I went up and talked to her.

219
0:11:24.066,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And I asked her the questions

220
0:11:25.61,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that grown-ups ask kids,

221
0:11:27.789,000 --> 0:11:28,000
like, "What is your favorite subject?"

222
0:11:29.712,000 --> 0:11:31,000
and, "What do you want to be when you grow up?"

223
0:11:32.367,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And this is when her face turned blank,

224
0:11:35.664,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and she said to me,

225
0:11:37.714,000 --> 0:11:39,000
"I have no future.

226
0:11:40.185,000 --> 0:11:42,000
My schooling days are over."

227
0:11:43.162,000 --> 0:11:44,000
And I thought, there must be some misunderstanding,

228
0:11:44.81,000 --> 0:11:46,000
so I turned to my colleague

229
0:11:47.119,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and she confirmed to me

230
0:11:49.217,000 --> 0:11:51,000
there is no funding for secondary education

231
0:11:51.91,000 --> 0:11:53,000
in this camp.

232
0:11:54.18,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And how I wished at that moment

233
0:11:55.649,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that I could say to her,

234
0:11:57.967,000 --> 0:11:59,000
"We will build you a school."

235
0:12:00.372,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And I also thought, what a waste.

236
0:12:04.546,000 --> 0:12:07,000
She should be and she is

237
0:12:07.594,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the future of Somalia.

238
0:12:11.925,000 --> 0:12:14,000
A boy named Jacob Atem

239
0:12:15.131,000 --> 0:12:18,000
had a different chance, but not before he experienced

240
0:12:18.326,000 --> 0:12:2,000
terribly tragedy.

241
0:12:20.418,000 --> 0:12:22,000
He watched — this is in Sudan —

242
0:12:22.882,000 --> 0:12:24,000
as his village — he was only seven years old —

243
0:12:25.176,000 --> 0:12:27,000
burned to the ground, and he learned

244
0:12:27.558,000 --> 0:12:28,000
that his mother and his father

245
0:12:29.397,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and his entire family

246
0:12:31.386,000 --> 0:12:32,000
were killed that day.

247
0:12:33.25,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Only his cousin survived, and the two of them

248
0:12:35.04,000 --> 0:12:37,000
walked for seven months —

249
0:12:37.32,000 --> 0:12:38,000
this is boys like him —

250
0:12:39.17,000 --> 0:12:42,000
chased and pursued by wild animals and armed gangs,

251
0:12:42.378,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and they finally made it to refugee camps

252
0:12:44.738,000 --> 0:12:45,000
where they found safety,

253
0:12:46.271,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and he would spend the next seven years

254
0:12:48.394,000 --> 0:12:51,000
in Kenya in a refugee camp.

255
0:12:51.581,000 --> 0:12:53,000
But his life changed

256
0:12:54.109,000 --> 0:12:56,000
when he got the chance to be resettled

257
0:12:56.212,000 --> 0:12:58,000
to the United States,

258
0:12:58.417,000 --> 0:13:,000
and he found love in a foster family

259
0:13:01.113,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and he was able to go to school,

260
0:13:03.701,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and he wanted me to share with you

261
0:13:05.995,000 --> 0:13:06,000
this proud moment

262
0:13:07.563,000 --> 0:13:09,000
when he graduated from university.

263
0:13:09.868,000 --> 0:13:12,000
(Applause)

264
0:13:15.829,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I spoke to him on Skype the other day,

265
0:13:18.243,000 --> 0:13:22,000
and he was in his new university in Florida

266
0:13:23.237,000 --> 0:13:25,000
pursuing his Ph.D. in public health,

267
0:13:26.236,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and he proudly told me how he was able to raise

268
0:13:29.306,000 --> 0:13:31,000
enough funds from the American public

269
0:13:31.99,000 --> 0:13:35,000
to establish a health clinic back in his village

270
0:13:36.575,000 --> 0:13:39,000
back home.

271
0:13:39.655,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So I want to take you back to Hany.

272
0:13:42.939,000 --> 0:13:44,000
When I told him I was going to have the chance

273
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
to speak to you here on the TED stage,

274
0:13:47.877,000 --> 0:13:49,000
he allowed me to read you a poem

275
0:13:50.172,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that he sent in an email to me.

276
0:13:53.532,000 --> 0:13:55,000
He wrote:

277
0:13:57.27,000 --> 0:13:59,000
"I miss myself,

278
0:13:59.83,000 --> 0:14:01,000
my friends,

279
0:14:02.335,000 --> 0:14:06,000
times of reading novels or writing poems,

280
0:14:06.59,000 --> 0:14:1,000
birds and tea in the morning.

281
0:14:11.515,000 --> 0:14:15,000
My room, my books, myself,

282
0:14:16.464,000 --> 0:14:21,000
and everything that was making me smile.

283
0:14:22.122,000 --> 0:14:26,000
Oh, oh, I had so many dreams

284
0:14:26.25,000 --> 0:14:29,000
that were about to be realized."

285
0:14:31.323,000 --> 0:14:33,000
So here is my point:

286
0:14:33.551,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Not investing in refugees

287
0:14:35.597,000 --> 0:14:4,000
is a huge missed opportunity.

288
0:14:41.241,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Leave them abandoned,

289
0:14:43.092,000 --> 0:14:48,000
and they risk exploitation and abuse,

290
0:14:48.439,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and leave them unskilled and uneducated,

291
0:14:51.712,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and delay by years the return

292
0:14:54.265,000 --> 0:14:59,000
to peace and prosperity in their countries.

293
0:15:00.115,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I believe how we treat the uprooted

294
0:15:03.399,000 --> 0:15:07,000
will shape the future of our world.

295
0:15:07.972,000 --> 0:15:09,000
The victims of war can hold the keys

296
0:15:10.926,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to lasting peace,

297
0:15:13.447,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and it's the refugees

298
0:15:15.256,000 --> 0:15:18,000
who can stop the cycle of violence.

299
0:15:18.923,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Hany is at a tipping point.

300
0:15:21.944,000 --> 0:15:23,000
We would love to help him go to university

301
0:15:24.209,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and to become an engineer,

302
0:15:27.269,000 --> 0:15:3,000
but our funds are prioritized for the basics in life:

303
0:15:31.116,000 --> 0:15:35,000
tents and blankets and mattresses and kitchen sets,

304
0:15:35.163,000 --> 0:15:39,000
food rations and a bit of medicine.

305
0:15:39.519,000 --> 0:15:42,000
University is a luxury.

306
0:15:42.916,000 --> 0:15:46,000
But leave him to languish in this muddy field,

307
0:15:47.253,000 --> 0:15:48,000
and he will become a member

308
0:15:49.214,000 --> 0:15:52,000
of a lost generation.

309
0:15:52.636,000 --> 0:15:56,000
Hany's story is a tragedy,

310
0:15:57.34,000 --> 0:16:,000
but it doesn't have to end that way.

311
0:16:01.073,000 --> 0:16:03,000
Thank you.

312
0:16:03.45,000 --> 0:16:06,000
(Applause)

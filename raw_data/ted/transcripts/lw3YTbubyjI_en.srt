0:00:15.76,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The global economic financial crisis has reignited public interest

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
in something that's actually one of the oldest questions in economics,

4
0:00:23.676,000 --> 0:00:25,000
dating back to at least before Adam Smith.

5
0:00:26.36,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And that is, why is it that countries with seemingly similar economies and institutions

6
0:00:31.844,000 --> 0:00:34,000
can display radically different savings behavior?

7
0:00:35.093,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now, many brilliant economists have spent their entire lives working on this question,

8
0:00:39.627,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and as a field we've made a tremendous amount of headway

9
0:00:43.044,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and we understand a lot about this.

10
0:00:45.477,000 --> 0:00:48,000
What I'm here to talk with you about today is an intriguing new hypothesis

11
0:00:49.111,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and some surprisingly powerful new findings that I've been working on

12
0:00:53.143,000 --> 0:00:57,000
about the link between the structure of the language you speak

13
0:00:57.864,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and how you find yourself with the propensity to save.

14
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Let me tell you a little bit about savings rates, a little bit about language,

15
0:01:05.327,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and then I'll draw that connection.

16
0:01:07.677,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Let's start by thinking about the member countries of the OECD,

17
0:01:12.244,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development.

18
0:01:15.545,000 --> 0:01:18,000
OECD countries, by and large, you should think about these

19
0:01:19.444,000 --> 0:01:21,000
as the richest, most industrialized countries in the world.

20
0:01:22.082,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And by joining the OECD, they were affirming a common commitment

21
0:01:26.132,000 --> 0:01:29,000
to democracy, open markets and free trade.

22
0:01:29.57,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Despite all of these similarities, we see huge differences in savings behavior.

23
0:01:34.255,000 --> 0:01:36,000
So all the way over on the left of this graph,

24
0:01:36.705,000 --> 0:01:4,000
what you see is many OECD countries saving over a quarter of their GDP every year,

25
0:01:41.439,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and some OECD countries saving over a third of their GDP per year.

26
0:01:46.12,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Holding down the right flank of the OECD, all the way on the other side, is Greece.

27
0:01:50.888,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And what you can see is that over the last 25 years,

28
0:01:54.304,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Greece has barely managed to save more than 10 percent of their GDP.

29
0:01:58.204,000 --> 0:02:04,000
It should be noted, of course, that the United States and the U.K. are the next in line.

30
0:02:05.078,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now that we see these huge differences in savings rates,

31
0:02:07.656,000 --> 0:02:1,000
how is it possible that language might have something to do with these differences?

32
0:02:11.322,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ.

33
0:02:14.371,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Linguists and cognitive scientists have been exploring this question for many years now.

34
0:02:19.938,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And then I'll draw the connection between these two behaviors.

35
0:02:24.548,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Many of you have probably already noticed that I'm Chinese.

36
0:02:27.156,000 --> 0:02:29,000
I grew up in the Midwest of the United States.

37
0:02:30.121,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And something I realized quite early on

38
0:02:32.572,000 --> 0:02:35,000
was that the Chinese language forced me to speak about and --

39
0:02:36.163,000 --> 0:02:38,000
in fact, more fundamentally than that --

40
0:02:39.054,000 --> 0:02:43,000
ever so slightly forced me to think about family in very different ways.

41
0:02:43.144,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Now, how might that be? Let me give you an example.

42
0:02:45.221,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Suppose I were talking with you and I was introducing you to my uncle.

43
0:02:49.623,000 --> 0:02:51,000
You understood exactly what I just said in English.

44
0:02:52.489,000 --> 0:02:54,000
If we were speaking Mandarin Chinese with each other, though,

45
0:02:55.439,000 --> 0:02:57,000
I wouldn't have that luxury.

46
0:02:57.505,000 --> 0:02:59,000
I wouldn't have been able to convey so little information.

47
0:03:00.338,000 --> 0:03:02,000
What my language would have forced me to do,

48
0:03:02.722,000 --> 0:03:04,000
instead of just telling you, "This is my uncle,"

49
0:03:04.722,000 --> 0:03:07,000
is to tell you a tremendous amount of additional information.

50
0:03:08.004,000 --> 0:03:09,000
My language would force me to tell you

51
0:03:09.823,000 --> 0:03:12,000
whether or not this was an uncle on my mother's side or my father's side,

52
0:03:13.239,000 --> 0:03:16,000
whether this was an uncle by marriage or by birth,

53
0:03:16.323,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and if this man was my father's brother,

54
0:03:18.555,000 --> 0:03:2,000
whether he was older than or younger than my father.

55
0:03:21.339,000 --> 0:03:25,000
All of this information is obligatory. Chinese doesn't let me ignore it.

56
0:03:25.472,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And in fact, if I want to speak correctly,

57
0:03:27.638,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Chinese forces me to constantly think about it.

58
0:03:30.755,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now, that fascinated me endlessly as a child,

59
0:03:34.704,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but what fascinates me even more today as an economist

60
0:03:37.939,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is that some of these same differences carry through to how languages speak about time.

61
0:03:43.24,000 --> 0:03:47,000
So for example, if I'm speaking in English, I have to speak grammatically differently

62
0:03:47.489,000 --> 0:03:49,000
if I'm talking about past rain, "It rained yesterday,"

63
0:03:50.222,000 --> 0:03:52,000
current rain, "It is raining now,"

64
0:03:52.454,000 --> 0:03:54,000
or future rain, "It will rain tomorrow."

65
0:03:54.888,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Notice that English requires a lot more information with respect to the timing of events.

66
0:03:59.715,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Why? Because I have to consider that

67
0:04:01.722,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and I have to modify what I'm saying to say, "It will rain," or "It's going to rain."

68
0:04:06.505,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It's simply not permissible in English to say, "It rain tomorrow."

69
0:04:10.621,000 --> 0:04:14,000
In contrast to that, that's almost exactly what you would say in Chinese.

70
0:04:14.805,000 --> 0:04:16,000
A Chinese speaker can basically say something

71
0:04:17.121,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that sounds very strange to an English speaker's ears.

72
0:04:19.705,000 --> 0:04:23,000
They can say, "Yesterday it rain," "Now it rain," "Tomorrow it rain."

73
0:04:24.272,000 --> 0:04:27,000
In some deep sense, Chinese doesn't divide up the time spectrum

74
0:04:28.135,000 --> 0:04:34,000
in the same way that English forces us to constantly do in order to speak correctly.

75
0:04:34.568,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Is this difference in languages

76
0:04:36.152,000 --> 0:04:4,000
only between very, very distantly related languages, like English and Chinese?

77
0:04:40.347,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Actually, no.

78
0:04:41.305,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So many of you know, in this room, that English is a Germanic language.

79
0:04:45.038,000 --> 0:04:48,000
What you may not have realized is that English is actually an outlier.

80
0:04:48.953,000 --> 0:04:51,000
It is the only Germanic language that requires this.

81
0:04:52.203,000 --> 0:04:54,000
For example, most other Germanic language speakers

82
0:04:55.087,000 --> 0:04:58,000
feel completely comfortable talking about rain tomorrow

83
0:04:58.104,000 --> 0:04:59,000
by saying, "Morgen regnet es,"

84
0:05:00.07,000 --> 0:05:03,000
quite literally to an English ear, "It rain tomorrow."

85
0:05:03.97,000 --> 0:05:08,000
This led me, as a behavioral economist, to an intriguing hypothesis.

86
0:05:09.037,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Could how you speak about time, could how your language forces you to think about time,

87
0:05:13.286,000 --> 0:05:16,000
affect your propensity to behave across time?

88
0:05:17.037,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You speak English, a futured language.

89
0:05:19.937,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And what that means is that every time you discuss the future,

90
0:05:23.104,000 --> 0:05:24,000
or any kind of a future event,

91
0:05:24.671,000 --> 0:05:27,000
grammatically you're forced to cleave that from the present

92
0:05:28.07,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and treat it as if it's something viscerally different.

93
0:05:30.703,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Now suppose that that visceral difference

94
0:05:33.203,000 --> 0:05:37,000
makes you subtly dissociate the future from the present every time you speak.

95
0:05:37.403,000 --> 0:05:38,000
If that's true and it makes the future feel

96
0:05:39.316,000 --> 0:05:41,000
like something more distant and more different from the present,

97
0:05:42.299,000 --> 0:05:44,000
that's going to make it harder to save.

98
0:05:44.953,000 --> 0:05:46,000
If, on the other hand, you speak a futureless language,

99
0:05:47.504,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the present and the future, you speak about them identically.

100
0:05:50.887,000 --> 0:05:52,000
If that subtly nudges you to feel about them identically,

101
0:05:53.87,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that's going to make it easier to save.

102
0:05:56.254,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Now this is a fanciful theory.

103
0:05:58.804,000 --> 0:06:,000
I'm a professor, I get paid to have fanciful theories.

104
0:06:01.704,000 --> 0:06:05,000
But how would you actually go about testing such a theory?

105
0:06:05.938,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Well, what I did with that was to access the linguistics literature.

106
0:06:10.004,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And interestingly enough, there are pockets of futureless language speakers

107
0:06:14.387,000 --> 0:06:15,000
situated all over the world.

108
0:06:16.32,000 --> 0:06:19,000
This is a pocket of futureless language speakers in Northern Europe.

109
0:06:19.686,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Interestingly enough, when you start to crank the data,

110
0:06:22.587,000 --> 0:06:25,000
these pockets of futureless language speakers all around the world

111
0:06:25.82,000 --> 0:06:28,000
turn out to be, by and large, some of the world's best savers.

112
0:06:29.754,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Just to give you a hint of that,

113
0:06:31.92,000 --> 0:06:33,000
let's look back at that OECD graph that we were talking about.

114
0:06:34.67,000 --> 0:06:37,000
What you see is that these bars are systematically taller

115
0:06:38.054,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and systematically shifted to the left

116
0:06:40.186,000 --> 0:06:44,000
compared to these bars which are the members of the OECD that speak futured languages.

117
0:06:44.704,000 --> 0:06:45,000
What is the average difference here?

118
0:06:46.167,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Five percentage points of your GDP saved per year.

119
0:06:49.453,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Over 25 years that has huge long-run effects on the wealth of your nation.

120
0:06:54.187,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now while these findings are suggestive,

121
0:06:56.887,000 --> 0:06:58,000
countries can be different in so many different ways

122
0:06:58.953,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that it's very, very difficult sometimes to account for all of these possible differences.

123
0:07:03.337,000 --> 0:07:07,000
What I'm going to show you, though, is something that I've been engaging in for a year,

124
0:07:07.369,000 --> 0:07:09,000
which is trying to gather all of the largest datasets

125
0:07:09.692,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that we have access to as economists,

126
0:07:11.984,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and I'm going to try and strip away all of those possible differences,

127
0:07:15.366,000 --> 0:07:17,000
hoping to get this relationship to break.

128
0:07:18.02,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And just in summary, no matter how far I push this, I can't get it to break.

129
0:07:23.051,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Let me show you how far you can do that.

130
0:07:24.816,000 --> 0:07:28,000
One way to imagine that is I gather large datasets from around the world.

131
0:07:29.449,000 --> 0:07:32,000
So for example, there is the Survey of Health, [Aging] and Retirement in Europe.

132
0:07:33.183,000 --> 0:07:36,000
From this dataset you actually learn that retired European families

133
0:07:37.017,000 --> 0:07:39,000
are extremely patient with survey takers.

134
0:07:39.65,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Laughter)

135
0:07:41.566,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So imagine that you're a retired household in Belgium and someone comes to your front door.

136
0:07:45.95,000 --> 0:07:49,000
"Excuse me, would you mind if I peruse your stock portfolio?

137
0:07:50.534,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Do you happen to know how much your house is worth? Do you mind telling me?

138
0:07:54.066,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Would you happen to have a hallway that's more than 10 meters long?

139
0:07:57.333,000 --> 0:08:01,000
If you do, would you mind if I timed how long it took you to walk down that hallway?

140
0:08:01.834,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Would you mind squeezing as hard as you can, in your dominant hand, this device

141
0:08:05.731,000 --> 0:08:06,000
so I can measure your grip strength?

142
0:08:07.243,000 --> 0:08:11,000
How about blowing into this tube so I can measure your lung capacity?"

143
0:08:11.266,000 --> 0:08:13,000
The survey takes over a day.

144
0:08:14.15,000 --> 0:08:15,000
(Laughter)

145
0:08:15.633,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Combine that with a Demographic and Health Survey

146
0:08:19.533,000 --> 0:08:23,000
collected by USAID in developing countries in Africa, for example,

147
0:08:23.983,000 --> 0:08:28,000
which that survey actually can go so far as to directly measure the HIV status

148
0:08:29.134,000 --> 0:08:32,000
of families living in, for example, rural Nigeria.

149
0:08:32.233,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Combine that with a world value survey,

150
0:08:34.134,000 --> 0:08:38,000
which measures the political opinions and, fortunately for me, the savings behaviors

151
0:08:38.567,000 --> 0:08:42,000
of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world.

152
0:08:43.266,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Take all of that data, combine it, and this map is what you get.

153
0:08:47.084,000 --> 0:08:49,000
What you find is nine countries around the world

154
0:08:49.334,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that have significant native populations

155
0:08:51.986,000 --> 0:08:55,000
which speak both futureless and futured languages.

156
0:08:56.033,000 --> 0:08:59,000
And what I'm going to do is form statistical matched pairs

157
0:08:59.567,000 --> 0:09:04,000
between families that are nearly identical on every dimension that I can measure,

158
0:09:05.16,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and then I'm going to explore whether or not the link between language and savings holds

159
0:09:08.697,000 --> 0:09:11,000
even after controlling for all of these levels.

160
0:09:12.18,000 --> 0:09:14,000
What are the characteristics we can control for?

161
0:09:14.397,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Well I'm going to match families on country of birth and residence,

162
0:09:17.161,000 --> 0:09:19,000
the demographics -- what sex, their age --

163
0:09:19.563,000 --> 0:09:21,000
their income level within their own country,

164
0:09:21.697,000 --> 0:09:24,000
their educational achievement, a lot about their family structure.

165
0:09:24.712,000 --> 0:09:27,000
It turns out there are six different ways to be married in Europe.

166
0:09:28.23,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And most granularly, I break them down by religion

167
0:09:32.43,000 --> 0:09:35,000
where there are 72 categories of religions in the world --

168
0:09:35.745,000 --> 0:09:36,000
so an extreme level of granularity.

169
0:09:37.462,000 --> 0:09:41,000
There are 1.4 billion different ways that a family can find itself.

170
0:09:41.995,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Now effectively everything I'm going to tell you from now on

171
0:09:46.044,000 --> 0:09:49,000
is only comparing these basically nearly identical families.

172
0:09:49.094,000 --> 0:09:51,000
It's getting as close as possible to the thought experiment

173
0:09:51.594,000 --> 0:09:53,000
of finding two families both of whom live in Brussels

174
0:09:54.527,000 --> 0:09:57,000
who are identical on every single one of these dimensions,

175
0:09:57.527,000 --> 0:10:,000
but one of whom speaks Flemish and one of whom speaks French;

176
0:10:00.643,000 --> 0:10:02,000
or two families that live in a rural district in Nigeria,

177
0:10:03.36,000 --> 0:10:06,000
one of whom speaks Hausa and one of whom speaks Igbo.

178
0:10:07.193,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Now even after all of this granular level of control,

179
0:10:11.077,000 --> 0:10:14,000
do futureless language speakers seem to save more?

180
0:10:14.243,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Yes, futureless language speakers, even after this level of control,

181
0:10:17.896,000 --> 0:10:2,000
are 30 percent more likely to report having saved in any given year.

182
0:10:21.594,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Does this have cumulative effects?

183
0:10:23.41,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Yes, by the time they retire, futureless language speakers, holding constant their income,

184
0:10:27.83,000 --> 0:10:3,000
are going to retire with 25 percent more in savings.

185
0:10:30.898,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Can we push this data even further?

186
0:10:33.379,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Yes, because I just told you, we actually collect a lot of health data as economists.

187
0:10:38.678,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Now how can we think about health behaviors to think about savings?

188
0:10:42.561,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Well, think about smoking, for example.

189
0:10:45.394,000 --> 0:10:48,000
Smoking is in some deep sense negative savings.

190
0:10:48.577,000 --> 0:10:51,000
If savings is current pain in exchange for future pleasure,

191
0:10:52.243,000 --> 0:10:53,000
smoking is just the opposite.

192
0:10:53.551,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It's current pleasure in exchange for future pain.

193
0:10:56.41,000 --> 0:10:58,000
What we should expect then is the opposite effect.

194
0:10:59.36,000 --> 0:11:,000
And that's exactly what we find.

195
0:11:01.128,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Futureless language speakers are 20 to 24 percent less likely

196
0:11:04.895,000 --> 0:11:07,000
to be smoking at any given point in time compared to identical families,

197
0:11:08.31,000 --> 0:11:1,000
and they're going to be 13 to 17 percent less likely

198
0:11:11.211,000 --> 0:11:13,000
to be obese by the time they retire,

199
0:11:13.428,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and they're going to report being 21 percent more likely

200
0:11:15.891,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to have used a condom in their last sexual encounter.

201
0:11:18.178,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I could go on and on with the list of differences that you can find.

202
0:11:21.661,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It's almost impossible not to find a savings behavior

203
0:11:25.461,000 --> 0:11:27,000
for which this strong effect isn't present.

204
0:11:28.06,000 --> 0:11:32,000
My linguistics and economics colleagues at Yale and I are just starting to do this work

205
0:11:32.81,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and really explore and understand the ways that these subtle nudges

206
0:11:37.977,000 --> 0:11:42,000
cause us to think more or less about the future every single time we speak.

207
0:11:43.372,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Ultimately, the goal,

208
0:11:45.673,000 --> 0:11:49,000
once we understand how these subtle effects can change our decision making,

209
0:11:49.872,000 --> 0:11:51,000
we want to be able to provide people tools

210
0:11:52.822,000 --> 0:11:54,000
so that they can consciously make themselves better savers

211
0:11:55.63,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and more conscious investors in their own future.

212
0:11:58.889,000 --> 0:12:,000
Thank you very much.

213
0:12:01.156,000 --> 0:12:07,000
(Applause)

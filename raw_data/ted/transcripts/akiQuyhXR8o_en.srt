1
0:00:12.38,000 --> 0:00:16,000
We all have milestones in life that we remember so vividly.

2
0:00:16.82,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The first one for me was when I was entering kindergarten.

3
0:00:20.46,000 --> 0:00:23,000
My big brother was in school, and by golly, it was my time.

4
0:00:24.82,000 --> 0:00:26,000
And I went trottin' down that hallway.

5
0:00:27.1,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I was so excited, I almost wet myself.

6
0:00:30.34,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And I go to the door,

7
0:00:31.94,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and there was the teacher with a warm welcome,

8
0:00:34.58,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and she took me into the classroom,

9
0:00:36.74,000 --> 0:00:37,000
showed me my little cubbyhole --

10
0:00:38.34,000 --> 0:00:4,000
we all remember those little cubbyholes, don't we --

11
0:00:40.98,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and we put our stuff in there.

12
0:00:43.06,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And then she said, "Go over to the circle

13
0:00:45.06,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and play with the kids until class starts."

14
0:00:47.98,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So I went over there and plopped down like I owned the place,

15
0:00:51.46,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I'm playing,

16
0:00:52.9,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and all of a sudden, the boy next to me,

17
0:00:54.829,000 --> 0:00:57,000
he was wearing a white shirt with blue shorts.

18
0:00:57.9,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I remember it like it was yesterday.

19
0:01:00.66,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Suddenly he stopped playing and he said,

20
0:01:03.34,000 --> 0:01:04,000
"Why are you so short?"

21
0:01:05.74,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And I just kept playing. I didn't think he was talking to me.

22
0:01:08.66,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

23
0:01:09.7,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And in a louder voice, he said,

24
0:01:11.54,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"Hey, why are you so short?"

25
0:01:14.42,000 --> 0:01:15,000
So I looked up and I said,

26
0:01:15.86,000 --> 0:01:18,000
"What are you talking about? Let's just play. We're happy.

27
0:01:19.58,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I've been waiting for this."

28
0:01:21.74,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And so we played, and about a minute later,

29
0:01:23.94,000 --> 0:01:26,000
the girl next to him, in a white shirt and a pink skirt,

30
0:01:27.62,000 --> 0:01:28,000
stood up, put her hands on her hips,

31
0:01:29.38,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and said, "Yeah, why do you look so different?"

32
0:01:33.38,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And I went, "What are you talking about?

33
0:01:36.3,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I don't look different. I'm not short. Again, let's just play."

34
0:01:40.34,000 --> 0:01:43,000
About this time, I looked all around the circle I was in,

35
0:01:43.86,000 --> 0:01:46,000
and all the kids had stopped playing and they were all looking at me.

36
0:01:47.94,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And I'm thinking --

37
0:01:49.54,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in today's language, it would be "OMG" or "WTF."

38
0:01:53.34,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

39
0:01:57.7,000 --> 0:01:58,000
What just happened?

40
0:02:00.06,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So all the confidence that I went in with that morning

41
0:02:03.7,000 --> 0:02:06,000
was withering away as the morning went on

42
0:02:07.06,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and the questions kept coming.

43
0:02:09.46,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And at the end of the morning, before I went home,

44
0:02:12.02,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the teacher had us in a circle,

45
0:02:13.98,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and I actually found myself outside of the circle.

46
0:02:16.7,000 --> 0:02:17,000
I couldn't look at anybody.

47
0:02:18.06,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I could not understand what just happened.

48
0:02:21.859,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And over the next few years,

49
0:02:23.78,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I hated to go out in public.

50
0:02:25.9,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I felt every stare, every giggle,

51
0:02:28.82,000 --> 0:02:29,000
every pointed finger,

52
0:02:30.5,000 --> 0:02:31,000
not the finger,

53
0:02:31.94,000 --> 0:02:32,000
but every pointed finger,

54
0:02:33.9,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and I hated it.

55
0:02:35.18,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I would hide behind my parents' legs like nobody could see me.

56
0:02:39.02,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And as a child,

57
0:02:40.42,000 --> 0:02:43,000
you can't understand another child's curiosity,

58
0:02:43.78,000 --> 0:02:44,000
nor an adult's ignorance.

59
0:02:46.5,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It became very apparent to me that the real world was not built

60
0:02:50.86,000 --> 0:02:54,000
for someone of my size, both literally or figuratively.

61
0:02:56.02,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And so I have no anonymity, as you can probably tell,

62
0:03:01.62,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and while you can see my size,

63
0:03:03.38,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we all go through many challenges through our lifetime.

64
0:03:06.9,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And some you can see, like mine.

65
0:03:09.9,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Most you can't.

66
0:03:11.5,000 --> 0:03:15,000
You can't tell if someone's dealing with a mental illness,

67
0:03:16.5,000 --> 0:03:18,000
or they're struggling with their gender identity,

68
0:03:19.1,000 --> 0:03:21,000
they're caring for an aging parent,

69
0:03:21.66,000 --> 0:03:22,000
they're having financial difficulty.

70
0:03:23.42,000 --> 0:03:24,000
You can't see that kind of stuff.

71
0:03:26.38,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So while you can see

72
0:03:28.22,000 --> 0:03:3,000
one of my challenges is my size,

73
0:03:31.06,000 --> 0:03:33,000
seeing does not mean you understand

74
0:03:33.42,000 --> 0:03:37,000
what it's truly to be me on a daily basis, or what I go through.

75
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And so I'm here to debunk a myth.

76
0:03:40.74,000 --> 0:03:44,000
I do not believe you can walk in someone else's shoes,

77
0:03:44.9,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and because of that, we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves.

78
0:03:49.54,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Simply stated, I will never know what it's like to be you

79
0:03:53.46,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and you will never know what it's like to be me.

80
0:03:56.3,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I cannot face your fears or chase your dreams,

81
0:03:59.1,000 --> 0:04:,000
and you can't do that for me,

82
0:04:00.98,000 --> 0:04:02,000
but we can be supportive of each other.

83
0:04:04.18,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Instead of trying to walk in each other's shoes,

84
0:04:06.82,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we must adopt a new way of giving of ourselves.

85
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I learned at an early age

86
0:04:13.14,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that I did have to do some things different than most people,

87
0:04:17.02,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but I also learned there were things I was on equal footing with,

88
0:04:20.5,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and one of those was the classroom.

89
0:04:22.66,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Heh, heh, heh. I was equal.

90
0:04:25.78,000 --> 0:04:27,000
As a matter of fact, I excelled in the classroom.

91
0:04:28.74,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This was vitally important, I discovered as I grew older

92
0:04:32.339,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and realized I wasn't going to be able to do a physical job.

93
0:04:35.66,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I needed an education.

94
0:04:38.06,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So I went on and got a university degree,

95
0:04:41.02,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but I felt to be one step ahead of everyone for employment,

96
0:04:44.82,000 --> 0:04:47,000
I needed to have an advanced university degree,

97
0:04:48.06,000 --> 0:04:49,000
so I went ahead and got that.

98
0:04:49.5,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Now I'm ready for my interview.

99
0:04:51.42,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Remember your first interview? What am I going to wear?

100
0:04:54.3,000 --> 0:04:55,000
What questions?

101
0:04:55.54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And don't forget that firm handshake.

102
0:04:57.86,000 --> 0:04:58,000
I was right there with you.

103
0:04:59.62,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So 24 hours before my interview,

104
0:05:01.66,000 --> 0:05:03,000
a friend of mine who I've known all my life

105
0:05:04.22,000 --> 0:05:08,000
called and said, "Michele, the building you're going in has steps."

106
0:05:08.54,000 --> 0:05:1,000
And she knew I couldn't climb steps.

107
0:05:10.74,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So suddenly, my focus changed.

108
0:05:12.62,000 --> 0:05:15,000
In my shoes, I was worried about how am I going to get there?

109
0:05:16.94,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So I went early and found a loading dock and got in and had a great interview.

110
0:05:22.42,000 --> 0:05:24,000
They had no idea what I went through for the day and that's OK.

111
0:05:26.3,000 --> 0:05:29,000
You're probably thinking my greatest challenge that day was the interview,

112
0:05:29.82,000 --> 0:05:3,000
or getting in the building.

113
0:05:31.74,000 --> 0:05:33,000
In reality, my biggest challenge that day

114
0:05:34.38,000 --> 0:05:36,000
was getting through the loading dock without getting run over.

115
0:05:38.02,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I am very vulnerable in certain situations:

116
0:05:41.82,000 --> 0:05:45,000
airports, hallways, parking lots,

117
0:05:46.14,000 --> 0:05:47,000
loading docks.

118
0:05:47.9,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And so I have to be very careful.

119
0:05:49.94,000 --> 0:05:51,000
I have to anticipate and be flexible

120
0:05:52.9,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and move as quickly as I can sometimes.

121
0:05:56.5,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So I got the job,

122
0:05:58.54,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and in my current role I travel quite a bit.

123
0:06:01.62,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And travel is a challenge for all of us these days.

124
0:06:05.1,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And so you probably get to the airport, run through security, get to the gate.

125
0:06:09.46,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Did I get my aisle seat or my window seat? Did I get my upgrade?

126
0:06:13.9,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Me, first of all, I don't run through anything.

127
0:06:16.22,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

128
0:06:17.42,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And I especially don't run through the TSA

129
0:06:19.5,000 --> 0:06:21,000
because I get to experience the personal patdown.

130
0:06:23.38,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I won't comment on that.

131
0:06:25.18,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And then I make my way to the gate,

132
0:06:27.18,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and with my gift of gab that my parents said I was born with,

133
0:06:30.98,000 --> 0:06:34,000
I talk to the gate agent, and then I say, "By the way, my scooter weighs this much,

134
0:06:35.62,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I have a dry cell battery,

135
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and I can drive it down to the door of the plane."

136
0:06:40.46,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Also, the day before, I had called the city where I'm traveling to

137
0:06:43.86,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to find out where I could rent a scooter in case mine gets broken on the way.

138
0:06:49.5,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So in my shoes, it's a little bit different.

139
0:06:52.3,000 --> 0:06:53,000
When I get onto the plane,

140
0:06:53.58,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I use my gift of gab to ask the lady to put my bag up, and they graciously do.

141
0:06:58.62,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I try not to eat or drink on a plane

142
0:07:00.38,000 --> 0:07:02,000
because I don't want to have to get up and walk on the plane,

143
0:07:03.3,000 --> 0:07:04,000
but nature has its own schedule,

144
0:07:04.9,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and not long ago, it knocked and I answered.

145
0:07:07.5,000 --> 0:07:09,000
So I walked up to the front of the plane

146
0:07:09.9,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and gabbed with the flight attendant,

147
0:07:11.94,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and said, "Can you watch the door? I can't reach the lock."

148
0:07:16.46,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So I'm in there doing my business, and the door flies open.

149
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And there's a gentleman there

150
0:07:22.7,000 --> 0:07:24,000
with a look of horror on his face.

151
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I'm sure I had the same look.

152
0:07:27.7,000 --> 0:07:31,000
As I came out, I noticed that he was sitting right across from me,

153
0:07:33.34,000 --> 0:07:35,000
and he's in total, complete embarrassment.

154
0:07:36.94,000 --> 0:07:38,000
So I walk up to him and I quietly go,

155
0:07:39.66,000 --> 0:07:41,000
"Are you going to remember this as much as I am?"

156
0:07:41.98,000 --> 0:07:43,000
(Laughter)

157
0:07:47.94,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And he goes, "I think so."

158
0:07:49.94,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:51.62,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Now, while he's probably not talking about it publicly, I am.

160
0:07:54.94,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Laughter)

161
0:07:56.78,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But we talked for the rest of the flight,

162
0:07:59.58,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and we got to know each other, our families, sports, work,

163
0:08:03.5,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and when we landed, he said,

164
0:08:05.22,000 --> 0:08:07,000
"Michele, I noticed someone put your bag up.

165
0:08:07.42,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Can I get that for you?"

166
0:08:08.66,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And I said, "Of course, thank you."

167
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And we wished each other well,

168
0:08:13.42,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and the most important thing that day

169
0:08:15.34,000 --> 0:08:18,000
was that he was not going to leave with that embarrassment,

170
0:08:19.14,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that experience of embarrassment.

171
0:08:21.58,000 --> 0:08:23,000
He won't forget it, and neither will I,

172
0:08:24.02,000 --> 0:08:26,000
but I think he will remember more

173
0:08:26.3,000 --> 0:08:28,000
our chat and our different perspectives.

174
0:08:30.06,000 --> 0:08:31,000
When you travel internationally,

175
0:08:32.06,000 --> 0:08:34,000
it can be even more challenging in certain ways.

176
0:08:34.66,000 --> 0:08:36,000
A few years ago, I was in Zanzibar,

177
0:08:37.42,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and I come wheeling in,

178
0:08:39.06,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and think about that.

179
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Short, white, blond woman in a chair.

180
0:08:45.739,000 --> 0:08:46,000
That doesn't probably happen every day.

181
0:08:49.18,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So I go up, and with my gift of gab, I start to talk to the agent.

182
0:08:52.78,000 --> 0:08:55,000
So friendly, and I ask about their culture and so forth,

183
0:08:56.22,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and I notice there wasn't a jet bridge.

184
0:08:59.06,000 --> 0:09:,000
So I had to kind of say,

185
0:09:01.02,000 --> 0:09:03,000
"Not only do you have to lift my chair,

186
0:09:03.1,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I could use some help getting up the steps."

187
0:09:05.74,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So we got to spend about an hour together while we waited for the flight,

188
0:09:09.62,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and it was the most magnificent hour.

189
0:09:11.5,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Our perspective changed for both of us that day.

190
0:09:14.98,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And once I got on the flight,

191
0:09:16.42,000 --> 0:09:18,000
he patted me on the back and wished me well,

192
0:09:19.38,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and I thanked him so much.

193
0:09:21.62,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And again, I think he's going to remember that experience more

194
0:09:26.1,000 --> 0:09:29,000
than when I first came in, and there was a bit of hesitation.

195
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
And as you notice, I get a lot of help.

196
0:09:33.7,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I would not be where I am today

197
0:09:35.66,000 --> 0:09:39,000
if it was not for my family, my friends, my colleagues

198
0:09:40.02,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and the many strangers

199
0:09:41.74,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that help me every single day of my life.

200
0:09:45.86,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And it's important that we all have a support system.

201
0:09:49.7,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Asking for help is a strength,

202
0:09:52.34,000 --> 0:09:53,000
not a weakness.

203
0:09:53.58,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Applause)

204
0:10:00.7,000 --> 0:10:02,000
We all need help throughout our lifetime,

205
0:10:03.62,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but it is just as important

206
0:10:06.06,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that we are part of other people's support systems.

207
0:10:09.5,000 --> 0:10:12,000
We must adopt that way of giving back.

208
0:10:12.7,000 --> 0:10:15,000
We all obviously have a role to play in our own successes,

209
0:10:17.42,000 --> 0:10:2,000
but think about the role we have to play in other people's successes,

210
0:10:21.02,000 --> 0:10:24,000
just like people do for me every single day.

211
0:10:25.82,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It's vitally important that we help each other,

212
0:10:29.38,000 --> 0:10:34,000
because society is increasingly placing people in silos

213
0:10:35.86,000 --> 0:10:37,000
based on biases and ideologies.

214
0:10:39.42,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And we must look past the surface

215
0:10:42.9,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and be confronted with the truth

216
0:10:45.06,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that none of us are what you can see.

217
0:10:47.94,000 --> 0:10:49,000
There's more to us than that,

218
0:10:50.06,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and we're all dealing with things that you cannot see.

219
0:10:55.06,000 --> 0:10:57,000
So living a life free of judgment

220
0:10:58.06,000 --> 0:11:02,000
allows all of us to share those experiences together

221
0:11:02.42,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and have a totally different perspective,

222
0:11:05.5,000 --> 0:11:08,000
just like the couple of people I mentioned earlier in my stories.

223
0:11:11.1,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So remember, the only shoes

224
0:11:13.42,000 --> 0:11:15,000
you truly can walk in are your own.

225
0:11:16.66,000 --> 0:11:17,000
I cannot walk in yours.

226
0:11:19.1,000 --> 0:11:21,000
I know you can't walk in my size 1s --

227
0:11:22.1,000 --> 0:11:23,000
(Laughter)

228
0:11:23.22,000 --> 0:11:24,000
but you can try.

229
0:11:25.9,000 --> 0:11:27,000
But we can do something better than that.

230
0:11:28.74,000 --> 0:11:31,000
With compassion, courage and understanding,

231
0:11:32.62,000 --> 0:11:34,000
we can walk side by side

232
0:11:35.34,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and support one another,

233
0:11:37.42,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and think about how society can change

234
0:11:40.1,000 --> 0:11:41,000
if we all do that

235
0:11:41.78,000 --> 0:11:44,000
instead of judging on only what you can see.

236
0:11:45.78,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Thank you.

237
0:11:47.02,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Applause)

238
0:11:52.74,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Thank you.

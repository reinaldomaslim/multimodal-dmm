1
0:00:07.63,000 --> 0:00:17,000
a few years ago I found myself looking

2
0:00:16.059,000 --> 0:00:18,000
for the most cost-effective way to be

3
0:00:17.83,000 --> 0:00:19,000
stylish

4
0:00:18.52,000 --> 0:00:22,000
so naturally I wound up at my local

5
0:00:20.439,000 --> 0:00:24,000
thrift store a wonderland of other

6
0:00:22.599,000 --> 0:00:26,000
people's trash that was ripe to be

7
0:00:24.55,000 --> 0:00:27,000
plucked to become my treasure now I

8
0:00:26.68,000 --> 0:00:29,000
wasn't just looking for your average off

9
0:00:28.27,000 --> 0:00:32,000
the second-hand rack vintage t-shirt to

10
0:00:30.22,000 --> 0:00:34,000
wear for me real style lives at the

11
0:00:32.77,000 --> 0:00:36,000
intersection of design and individuality

12
0:00:34.78,000 --> 0:00:37,000
so to make sure that I was getting the

13
0:00:36.85,000 --> 0:00:39,000
most out of the things that I was

14
0:00:37.93,000 --> 0:00:41,000
finding about a sewing machine so I

15
0:00:40.21,000 --> 0:00:43,000
could tailor the 90 style garments that

16
0:00:42.1,000 --> 0:00:44,000
I was finding to fit a more contemporary

17
0:00:43.93,000 --> 0:00:45,000
aesthetic

18
0:00:44.65,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I've been tailoring and making my own

19
0:00:46.63,000 --> 0:00:49,000
clothes from scratch ever since so

20
0:00:48.46,000 --> 0:00:51,000
everything in my closet is uniquely my

21
0:00:50.08,000 --> 0:00:53,000
own but as I was sorting through the

22
0:00:52.36,000 --> 0:00:55,000
endless racks of clothes at these thrift

23
0:00:53.92,000 --> 0:00:56,000
stores I start to ask myself what

24
0:00:56.29,000 --> 0:00:59,000
happens to all the clothes that I don't

25
0:00:57.46,000 --> 0:01:,000
buy the stuff that isn't really cool or

26
0:00:59.65,000 --> 0:01:02,000
trendy but kind of just sits there and

27
0:01:01.36,000 --> 0:01:04,000
rots away at the second-hand stores I

28
0:01:02.98,000 --> 0:01:06,000
work in the fashion industry on the

29
0:01:04.96,000 --> 0:01:08,000
wholesale side and I started to see some

30
0:01:07.03,000 --> 0:01:1,000
of the products that we sell end up on

31
0:01:09.009,000 --> 0:01:12,000
the racks of these thrift stores so the

32
0:01:10.81,000 --> 0:01:13,000
questions start to work its way into my

33
0:01:12.369,000 --> 0:01:16,000
work life as well I did some research

34
0:01:14.619,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I pretty quickly found a very scary

35
0:01:17.02,000 --> 0:01:21,000
supply chain that led me to some pretty

36
0:01:18.939,000 --> 0:01:21,000
troubling realities it turned out that

37
0:01:21.219,000 --> 0:01:23,000
the clothes that I was sorting

38
0:01:22.179,000 --> 0:01:25,000
throughout these surf stores represented

39
0:01:23.979,000 --> 0:01:25,000
only a small fraction of the total

40
0:01:25.569,000 --> 0:01:3,000
amount of garments that we dispose of

41
0:01:26.92,000 --> 0:01:31,000
each year in the US only 15% of the

42
0:01:30.999,000 --> 0:01:33,000
total textile and garment waste that's

43
0:01:32.77,000 --> 0:01:36,000
generated each year ends up being

44
0:01:34.99,000 --> 0:01:38,000
donated or recycled in some way which

45
0:01:37.149,000 --> 0:01:41,000
means that the other 85% of textile and

46
0:01:39.49,000 --> 0:01:42,000
garment waste end up in landfills every

47
0:01:41.409,000 --> 0:01:44,000
year now I want to put this into

48
0:01:43.479,000 --> 0:01:46,000
perspective because I don't quite think

49
0:01:44.859,000 --> 0:01:49,000
that that 85% does the problem justice

50
0:01:47.319,000 --> 0:01:52,000
this means that almost 13 million tons

51
0:01:50.439,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of clothing in textile waste end up in

52
0:01:52.959,000 --> 0:01:55,000
landfills every year in just the United

53
0:01:54.759,000 --> 0:01:59,000
States alone this averages out to be

54
0:01:56.859,000 --> 0:02:01,000
roughly 200 t-shirts per person ending

55
0:01:59.889,000 --> 0:02:03,000
up in the garbage in Canada we throw

56
0:02:02.499,000 --> 0:02:06,000
away enough clothing to fill the largest

57
0:02:04.45,000 --> 0:02:08,000
stadium in my hometown of Toronto one

58
0:02:06.729,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that seats 60,000 people with a mountain

59
0:02:09.34,000 --> 0:02:13,000
of clothes three times the size of that

60
0:02:11.38,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Stadium now even with this I still think

61
0:02:14.08,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that Canadians are the more polite North

62
0:02:15.97,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Americans so don't hold it against us

63
0:02:19.239,000 --> 0:02:23,000
what was even more surprising was seeing

64
0:02:21.68,000 --> 0:02:24,000
that the fashion industry is a second

65
0:02:23.45,000 --> 0:02:26,000
largest polluter in the world behind the

66
0:02:24.92,000 --> 0:02:27,000
oil and gas industry now this is an

67
0:02:26.87,000 --> 0:02:29,000
important comparison to make I don't

68
0:02:28.4,000 --> 0:02:31,000
want to defend the oil and gas industry

69
0:02:29.959,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but I'd be lying if I said that I was

70
0:02:31.73,000 --> 0:02:34,000
surprised to hear that they were the

71
0:02:32.84,000 --> 0:02:36,000
number one polluter is assumed fairly or

72
0:02:35.389,000 --> 0:02:37,000
not so that's an industry that doesn't

73
0:02:36.98,000 --> 0:02:39,000
really mind sticking to the status quo

74
0:02:38.299,000 --> 0:02:42,000
one where the technology doesn't really

75
0:02:40.459,000 --> 0:02:44,000
change and the focus is more so on

76
0:02:42.409,000 --> 0:02:46,000
driving profitability at the expense of

77
0:02:44.689,000 --> 0:02:47,000
a sustainable future but I was really

78
0:02:46.79,000 --> 0:02:48,000
surprised to see that the fashion

79
0:02:47.81,000 --> 0:02:5,000
industry was number two because

80
0:02:49.579,000 --> 0:02:52,000
maintaining the status quo is the

81
0:02:51.169,000 --> 0:02:55,000
opposite of what the fashion industry

82
0:02:52.639,000 --> 0:02:56,000
stands for the unfortunate reality is is

83
0:02:55.37,000 --> 0:02:58,000
not only do we waste a lot of the things

84
0:02:57.109,000 --> 0:03:,000
that we do consume but we also use a lot

85
0:02:59.269,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to produce the clothes that we buy each

86
0:03:00.859,000 --> 0:03:05,000
year on average a households purchase of

87
0:03:03.62,000 --> 0:03:07,000
clothing per year requires a thousand

88
0:03:05.989,000 --> 0:03:09,000
bath tubs of water to produce a thousand

89
0:03:08.54,000 --> 0:03:12,000
bath tubs of water per household per

90
0:03:10.34,000 --> 0:03:14,000
year that's a lot of water it seems that

91
0:03:13.34,000 --> 0:03:16,000
the industry that always has been and

92
0:03:14.84,000 --> 0:03:17,000
probably always will be on the forefront

93
0:03:16.43,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of design creates products that are

94
0:03:18.5,000 --> 0:03:21,000
designed to be comfortable designed to

95
0:03:20.54,000 --> 0:03:23,000
be trendy and designed to be expressive

96
0:03:22.459,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but aren't really designed to be

97
0:03:23.959,000 --> 0:03:26,000
sustainable or recyclable for that

98
0:03:25.669,000 --> 0:03:29,000
matter but I think that can change

99
0:03:27.769,000 --> 0:03:3,000
I think the fashion industry's aptitude

100
0:03:29.72,000 --> 0:03:32,000
for change is the exact thing that

101
0:03:31.579,000 --> 0:03:35,000
should make it patient zero for

102
0:03:33.59,000 --> 0:03:36,000
sustainable business practices and I

103
0:03:35.659,000 --> 0:03:38,000
think to get started all we have to do

104
0:03:37.099,000 --> 0:03:4,000
is start to design clothes to be

105
0:03:38.659,000 --> 0:03:41,000
recyclable at the end of their life now

106
0:03:41.03,000 --> 0:03:43,000
designing recyclable clothing is

107
0:03:42.65,000 --> 0:03:45,000
definitely something to leave to the

108
0:03:43.939,000 --> 0:03:47,000
professionals but as a 24 year old

109
0:03:46.549,000 --> 0:03:49,000
thrift store aficionado armed with the

110
0:03:48.079,000 --> 0:03:51,000
sewing machine if I were to very humbly

111
0:03:50.12,000 --> 0:03:53,000
pause at one perspective it would be to

112
0:03:52.009,000 --> 0:03:55,000
approach clothing design kind of like

113
0:03:53.599,000 --> 0:03:57,000
building with Lego when we put together

114
0:03:55.609,000 --> 0:03:59,000
a brick of Lego it's very strong but

115
0:03:57.889,000 --> 0:04:01,000
very easily manipulated it's modular and

116
0:04:00.049,000 --> 0:04:04,000
its nature clothing design of the stands

117
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:06,000
today is very rarely modular take this

118
0:04:04.759,000 --> 0:04:07,000
motorcycle jacket as an example it's a

119
0:04:06.65,000 --> 0:04:09,000
pretty standard jacket with its buttons

120
0:04:08.449,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and it zippers and it's trim but in

121
0:04:10.609,000 --> 0:04:13,000
order for us to efficiently recycle a

122
0:04:12.079,000 --> 0:04:15,000
jacket like this we need to be able to

123
0:04:13.79,000 --> 0:04:17,000
easily remove these items and quickly

124
0:04:15.799,000 --> 0:04:18,000
get down to just the fabric once we have

125
0:04:17.959,000 --> 0:04:2,000
just the fabric we're able to break it

126
0:04:19.4,000 --> 0:04:22,000
down by shredding it and getting back to

127
0:04:21.229,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the thread level make new thread then

128
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
gets made into new fabric and ultimately

129
0:04:25.25,000 --> 0:04:29,000
new clothing whether it be a new jacket

130
0:04:27.289,000 --> 0:04:3,000
or new t-shirts for example but the

131
0:04:29.57,000 --> 0:04:32,000
complexity lies with all of these extra

132
0:04:31.01,000 --> 0:04:35,000
items the buttons and the zippers

133
0:04:32.75,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the trim because in reality these items

134
0:04:35.12,000 --> 0:04:38,000
are actually quite difficult to remove

135
0:04:36.35,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so in many cases it requires more time

136
0:04:38.75,000 --> 0:04:42,000
or more money to disassemble a jacket

137
0:04:40.49,000 --> 0:04:44,000
like this in some cases it's just more

138
0:04:42.77,000 --> 0:04:45,000
cost-effective to throw it away rather

139
0:04:44.75,000 --> 0:04:47,000
than recycle it but I think this can

140
0:04:46.73,000 --> 0:04:5,000
change if we design clothes in a modular

141
0:04:48.5,000 --> 0:04:52,000
way to be easily disassembled at the end

142
0:04:51.02,000 --> 0:04:55,000
of the lives we could redesign this

143
0:04:52.88,000 --> 0:04:56,000
jacket to have a hidden wireframe kind

144
0:04:55.49,000 --> 0:04:59,000
of like the skeleton of a fish that

145
0:04:57.35,000 --> 0:05:01,000
holds all important items together this

146
0:04:59.66,000 --> 0:05:03,000
invisible fish bone structure can have

147
0:05:01.85,000 --> 0:05:04,000
all of these extra items the zippers and

148
0:05:03.74,000 --> 0:05:06,000
the buttons and the trim sewn into it

149
0:05:05.27,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and then attach to the fabric so at the

150
0:05:07.58,000 --> 0:05:09,000
end of the jackets life all you have to

151
0:05:08.9,000 --> 0:05:11,000
do is remove this fish bone and the

152
0:05:10.55,000 --> 0:05:14,000
fabric comes with it a lot quicker and a

153
0:05:12.32,000 --> 0:05:16,000
lot easier than before now recycling

154
0:05:15.05,000 --> 0:05:18,000
clothing is definitely one piece of the

155
0:05:16.46,000 --> 0:05:19,000
puzzle but if we want to take fixing the

156
0:05:18.56,000 --> 0:05:21,000
environmental impact of the fashion

157
0:05:19.97,000 --> 0:05:22,000
industry has more seriously then we need

158
0:05:22.43,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to take this to the next step and start

159
0:05:23.93,000 --> 0:05:27,000
to design clothes to also be compostable

160
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
at the end of their lives for most of

161
0:05:28.31,000 --> 0:05:3,000
the types of clothes that we have in our

162
0:05:29.42,000 --> 0:05:33,000
closet the average lifespan of these

163
0:05:31.13,000 --> 0:05:34,000
items is about three years now I'm sure

164
0:05:33.47,000 --> 0:05:35,000
there's many of us that have gems in our

165
0:05:35,000 --> 0:05:38,000
drawers that are much older than that

166
0:05:36.23,000 --> 0:05:39,000
which is great because being able to

167
0:05:38.18,000 --> 0:05:42,000
extend the life of a garment by even

168
0:05:39.8,000 --> 0:05:43,000
only nine months reduces the waste and

169
0:05:42.35,000 --> 0:05:46,000
water impact of that garment has by

170
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
twenty to thirty percent but fashion is

171
0:05:47.24,000 --> 0:05:5,000
fashion which means that styles are

172
0:05:49.13,000 --> 0:05:51,000
always gonna change and you're probably

173
0:05:50.69,000 --> 0:05:53,000
going to be wearing something different

174
0:05:51.56,000 --> 0:05:54,000
then you wear today eight seasons from

175
0:05:53.78,000 --> 0:05:56,000
now no matter how environmentally

176
0:05:55.28,000 --> 0:05:58,000
friendly you want to be but lucky for us

177
0:05:57.53,000 --> 0:06:,000
there's some items that never go out of

178
0:05:58.97,000 --> 0:06:01,000
style I'm talking about your basics

179
0:06:00.92,000 --> 0:06:04,000
stuff like your socks your underwear

180
0:06:02.75,000 --> 0:06:05,000
even your pajamas we're all guilty of

181
0:06:05.24,000 --> 0:06:08,000
wearing these items right down to the

182
0:06:06.74,000 --> 0:06:09,000
bone and in many cases throwing them in

183
0:06:08.54,000 --> 0:06:11,000
the garbage because it's really

184
0:06:10.01,000 --> 0:06:13,000
difficult to donate your old ratty socks

185
0:06:12.38,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that have holes in them to your local

186
0:06:13.94,000 --> 0:06:16,000
thrift store but what if we were able to

187
0:06:16.1,000 --> 0:06:2,000
compost these items rather than throw

188
0:06:17.84,000 --> 0:06:21,000
them in the trash bin the environmental

189
0:06:20.3,000 --> 0:06:23,000
savings could be huge and all we would

190
0:06:22.01,000 --> 0:06:25,000
have to do is start to shift more of our

191
0:06:23.48,000 --> 0:06:27,000
resources to start to produce more of

192
0:06:25.28,000 --> 0:06:29,000
these items using more natural fibers

193
0:06:27.71,000 --> 0:06:31,000
like 100% organic cotton

194
0:06:29.53,000 --> 0:06:33,000
now recycling and composting are two

195
0:06:32.42,000 --> 0:06:35,000
critical priorities but one other thing

196
0:06:34.37,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that we have to rethink is the way that

197
0:06:35.99,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we die our clothes currently 10 to 20%

198
0:06:38.72,000 --> 0:06:42,000
of the harsh chemical dye that we use

199
0:06:40.76,000 --> 0:06:43,000
end up in water bodies that neighbor

200
0:06:42.83,000 --> 0:06:45,000
production hubs in developing nations

201
0:06:44.66,000 --> 0:06:48,000
the tricky thing is is that

202
0:06:46.67,000 --> 0:06:5,000
harsh chemicals are really effective at

203
0:06:48.83,000 --> 0:06:51,000
keeping a garment a specific color for a

204
0:06:50.81,000 --> 0:06:53,000
long period of time if these harsh

205
0:06:52.79,000 --> 0:06:55,000
chemicals that keep that bright red

206
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
dress bright red for so many years

207
0:06:56.36,000 --> 0:06:59,000
but what if we were able to use

208
0:06:57.89,000 --> 0:07:,000
something different what if we were able

209
0:06:59.66,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to use something that we all have in our

210
0:07:01.46,000 --> 0:07:04,000
kitchen cabinets at home to dye our

211
0:07:02.96,000 --> 0:07:06,000
clothes what if we were able to use

212
0:07:05.06,000 --> 0:07:09,000
spices and herbs to dye our clothes

213
0:07:07.04,000 --> 0:07:1,000
there's countless food options that

214
0:07:09.38,000 --> 0:07:12,000
would allow for us sustained material

215
0:07:10.97,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but these stains change color over time

216
0:07:13.3,000 --> 0:07:16,000
this would be pretty different than the

217
0:07:15.29,000 --> 0:07:18,000
clothes that are dyed harshly with

218
0:07:16.88,000 --> 0:07:19,000
chemicals that were used to but dine

219
0:07:19.1,000 --> 0:07:21,000
clothes naturally this way it would

220
0:07:20.3,000 --> 0:07:23,000
allow for us to make sure that they're

221
0:07:21.98,000 --> 0:07:25,000
more unique and environmentally

222
0:07:23.51,000 --> 0:07:27,000
friendlier let's think about it fashion

223
0:07:26.06,000 --> 0:07:29,000
today is all about individuality fashion

224
0:07:28.07,000 --> 0:07:3,000
today is about managing your own

225
0:07:29.18,000 --> 0:07:33,000
personal appearance to be just unique

226
0:07:31.01,000 --> 0:07:35,000
enough to be cool these days everybody

227
0:07:33.47,000 --> 0:07:37,000
has the ability to showcase their brand

228
0:07:35.24,000 --> 0:07:39,000
their personal style across the world

229
0:07:37.49,000 --> 0:07:4,000
through social media the pocket sized

230
0:07:39.53,000 --> 0:07:42,000
billboards that we flicked through on

231
0:07:41.06,000 --> 0:07:44,000
our Instagram feeds are chock-full of

232
0:07:43.01,000 --> 0:07:47,000
models and taste makers that are

233
0:07:44.93,000 --> 0:07:48,000
showcasing their individuality through

234
0:07:47.12,000 --> 0:07:51,000
their personal micro brands but what

235
0:07:49.31,000 --> 0:07:52,000
could be more personalized more unique

236
0:07:51.14,000 --> 0:07:54,000
than clothes that change color over time

237
0:07:52.84,000 --> 0:07:55,000
clothes that with each wash and with

238
0:07:54.86,000 --> 0:07:57,000
each wear become more and more

239
0:07:56.15,000 --> 0:08:,000
one-of-a-kind people have been buying

240
0:07:58.46,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and wearing ripped jeans for years so

241
0:08:00.5,000 --> 0:08:03,000
this would just be another example of

242
0:08:01.88,000 --> 0:08:05,000
clothes that exists in our wardrobe that

243
0:08:03.98,000 --> 0:08:07,000
evolve with us over our lives their

244
0:08:06.38,000 --> 0:08:09,000
shirt for example is one that much to

245
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:11,000
the dismay of my mother and the state of

246
0:08:09.83,000 --> 0:08:12,000
her kitchen I died at home using tumeric

247
0:08:12.29,000 --> 0:08:15,000
before coming here today

248
0:08:13.4,000 --> 0:08:17,000
this shirt is something that no one else

249
0:08:15.89,000 --> 0:08:19,000
none of my friends are gonna have on

250
0:08:17.42,000 --> 0:08:22,000
their Instagram feed so it's unique but

251
0:08:20.3,000 --> 0:08:23,000
more importantly it's naturally dyed now

252
0:08:22.58,000 --> 0:08:24,000
I'm not suggesting that everybody dyed

253
0:08:23.84,000 --> 0:08:26,000
their clothes in their kitchen sink at

254
0:08:25.19,000 --> 0:08:3,000
home but if we were able to apply this

255
0:08:27.32,000 --> 0:08:32,000
or more similar process on a commercial

256
0:08:30.23,000 --> 0:08:33,000
scale then our need to rely on these

257
0:08:32.6,000 --> 0:08:35,000
harsh chemical dyes for our clothes

258
0:08:34.01,000 --> 0:08:38,000
could be easily reduced the two point

259
0:08:36.14,000 --> 0:08:4,000
four trillion dollar fashion industry is

260
0:08:38.06,000 --> 0:08:41,000
fiercely competitive so the business

261
0:08:40.25,000 --> 0:08:43,000
that can provide a product at scale

262
0:08:41.66,000 --> 0:08:44,000
while also promising its customers that

263
0:08:43.94,000 --> 0:08:46,000
each and every garment will become more

264
0:08:45.53,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and more unique over time will have a

265
0:08:47.3,000 --> 0:08:5,000
serious competitive advantage brands

266
0:08:49.67,000 --> 0:08:52,000
have been playing with customization for

267
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
years the rise of e-commerce services

268
0:08:53.54,000 --> 0:08:58,000
like Indo Chino a bespoke suiting

269
0:08:55.85,000 --> 0:08:59,000
platform and Tinker Tailor a bespoke

270
0:08:58.7,000 --> 0:09:01,000
dress making platform have

271
0:09:00.3,000 --> 0:09:04,000
customization possible from your couch

272
0:09:02.36,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Nike and Adidas have been mastering

273
0:09:04.71,000 --> 0:09:08,000
their online shoe customisation

274
0:09:06.51,000 --> 0:09:1,000
platforms for years providing

275
0:09:09.36,000 --> 0:09:12,000
individuality at scale is a challenge

276
0:09:11.49,000 --> 0:09:14,000
that most consumer facing businesses

277
0:09:12.99,000 --> 0:09:16,000
encounter so being able to tackle this

278
0:09:15.24,000 --> 0:09:18,000
while also providing an environmentally

279
0:09:17.31,000 --> 0:09:21,000
friendly product could lead to a pretty

280
0:09:19.02,000 --> 0:09:22,000
seismic industry shift and at that point

281
0:09:21.48,000 --> 0:09:24,000
it's not just about doing what's best

282
0:09:22.74,000 --> 0:09:27,000
for our environment but also what's best

283
0:09:24.99,000 --> 0:09:29,000
for the bottom line there's no fix all

284
0:09:27.75,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and there's no one-step solution but we

285
0:09:30.12,000 --> 0:09:34,000
can get started by designing clothes

286
0:09:32.07,000 --> 0:09:35,000
with their death in mind the fashion

287
0:09:34.35,000 --> 0:09:37,000
industry is the perfect industry to

288
0:09:36.06,000 --> 0:09:39,000
experiment with and embrace change that

289
0:09:38.31,000 --> 0:09:42,000
could one day get us to the sustainable

290
0:09:39.78,000 --> 0:09:47,000
future we so desperately need thank you

291
0:09:42.61,000 --> 0:09:47,000

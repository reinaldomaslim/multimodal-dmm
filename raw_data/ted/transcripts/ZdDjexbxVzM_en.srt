1
0:00:12.928,000 --> 0:00:15,000
If you look deep into the night sky,

2
0:00:16.42,000 --> 0:00:17,000
you see stars,

3
0:00:18.036,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and if you look further, you see more stars,

4
0:00:20.608,000 --> 0:00:22,000
and further, galaxies, and further, more galaxies.

5
0:00:22.767,000 --> 0:00:25,000
But if you keep looking further and further,

6
0:00:26.64,000 --> 0:00:29,000
eventually you see nothing for a long while,

7
0:00:29.756,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and then finally you see a faint, fading afterglow,

8
0:00:34.218,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and it's the afterglow of the Big Bang.

9
0:00:37.242,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now, the Big Bang was an era in the early universe

10
0:00:40.059,000 --> 0:00:42,000
when everything we see in the night sky

11
0:00:42.23,000 --> 0:00:44,000
was condensed into an incredibly small,

12
0:00:44.64,000 --> 0:00:48,000
incredibly hot, incredibly roiling mass,

13
0:00:48.966,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and from it sprung everything we see.

14
0:00:51.658,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Now, we've mapped that afterglow

15
0:00:54.517,000 --> 0:00:55,000
with great precision,

16
0:00:56.196,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and when I say we, I mean people who aren't me.

17
0:00:58.24,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We've mapped the afterglow

18
0:01:00.116,000 --> 0:01:01,000
with spectacular precision,

19
0:01:01.438,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and one of the shocks about it

20
0:01:02.986,000 --> 0:01:04,000
is that it's almost completely uniform.

21
0:01:05.932,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Fourteen billion light years that way

22
0:01:07.89,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and 14 billion light years that way,

23
0:01:09.75,000 --> 0:01:1,000
it's the same temperature.

24
0:01:11.158,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now it's been 14 billion years

25
0:01:14.472,000 --> 0:01:15,000
since that Big Bang,

26
0:01:16.29,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and so it's got faint and cold.

27
0:01:18.762,000 --> 0:01:2,000
It's now 2.7 degrees.

28
0:01:21.07,000 --> 0:01:23,000
But it's not exactly 2.7 degrees.

29
0:01:23.35,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's only 2.7 degrees to about

30
0:01:25.644,000 --> 0:01:26,000
10 parts in a million.

31
0:01:27.486,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Over here, it's a little hotter,

32
0:01:28.48,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and over there, it's a little cooler,

33
0:01:30.348,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and that's incredibly important to everyone in this room,

34
0:01:33.436,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because where it was a little hotter,

35
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
there was a little more stuff,

36
0:01:36.856,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and where there was a little more stuff,

37
0:01:38.423,000 --> 0:01:39,000
we have galaxies and clusters of galaxies

38
0:01:40.392,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and superclusters

39
0:01:41.644,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and all the structure you see in the cosmos.

40
0:01:44.352,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And those small, little, inhomogeneities,

41
0:01:47.464,000 --> 0:01:49,000
20 parts in a million,

42
0:01:49.746,000 --> 0:01:51,000
those were formed by quantum mechanical wiggles

43
0:01:52.5,000 --> 0:01:53,000
in that early universe that were stretched

44
0:01:54.308,000 --> 0:01:56,000
across the size of the entire cosmos.

45
0:01:56.587,000 --> 0:01:57,000
That is spectacular,

46
0:01:58.301,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and that's not what they found on Monday;

47
0:01:59.966,000 --> 0:02:01,000
what they found on Monday is cooler.

48
0:02:02.002,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So here's what they found on Monday:

49
0:02:04.268,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Imagine you take a bell,

50
0:02:07.771,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and you whack the bell with a hammer.

51
0:02:09.382,000 --> 0:02:1,000
What happens? It rings.

52
0:02:11.058,000 --> 0:02:13,000
But if you wait, that ringing fades

53
0:02:13.266,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and fades and fades

54
0:02:14.886,000 --> 0:02:15,000
until you don't notice it anymore.

55
0:02:16.828,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Now, that early universe was incredibly dense,

56
0:02:19.476,000 --> 0:02:21,000
like a metal, way denser,

57
0:02:21.555,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and if you hit it, it would ring,

58
0:02:23.96,000 --> 0:02:24,000
but the thing ringing would be

59
0:02:25.823,000 --> 0:02:27,000
the structure of space-time itself,

60
0:02:27.911,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and the hammer would be quantum mechanics.

61
0:02:30.727,000 --> 0:02:31,000
What they found on Monday

62
0:02:32.658,000 --> 0:02:34,000
was evidence of the ringing

63
0:02:35.02,000 --> 0:02:37,000
of the space-time of the early universe,

64
0:02:37.335,000 --> 0:02:39,000
what we call gravitational waves

65
0:02:39.44,000 --> 0:02:4,000
from the fundamental era,

66
0:02:40.96,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and here's how they found it.

67
0:02:42.935,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Those waves have long since faded.

68
0:02:45.007,000 --> 0:02:46,000
If you go for a walk,

69
0:02:46.495,000 --> 0:02:47,000
you don't wiggle.

70
0:02:48.083,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Those gravitational waves in the structure of space

71
0:02:50.831,000 --> 0:02:52,000
are totally invisible for all practical purposes.

72
0:02:53.605,000 --> 0:02:55,000
But early on, when the universe was making

73
0:02:56.509,000 --> 0:02:58,000
that last afterglow,

74
0:02:58.879,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the gravitational waves

75
0:03:00.437,000 --> 0:03:02,000
put little twists in the structure

76
0:03:03.3,000 --> 0:03:04,000
of the light that we see.

77
0:03:04.827,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So by looking at the night sky deeper and deeper --

78
0:03:07.793,000 --> 0:03:09,000
in fact, these guys spent three years on the South Pole

79
0:03:10.431,000 --> 0:03:12,000
looking straight up through the coldest, clearest,

80
0:03:13.02,000 --> 0:03:15,000
cleanest air they possibly could find

81
0:03:15.37,000 --> 0:03:17,000
looking deep into the night sky and studying

82
0:03:17.799,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that glow and looking for the faint twists

83
0:03:21.175,000 --> 0:03:23,000
which are the symbol, the signal,

84
0:03:23.523,000 --> 0:03:24,000
of gravitational waves,

85
0:03:25.343,000 --> 0:03:27,000
the ringing of the early universe.

86
0:03:27.684,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And on Monday, they announced

87
0:03:29.471,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that they had found it.

88
0:03:31.215,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And the thing that's so spectacular about that to me

89
0:03:33.642,000 --> 0:03:35,000
is not just the ringing, though that is awesome.

90
0:03:36.39,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The thing that's totally amazing,

91
0:03:37.748,000 --> 0:03:39,000
the reason I'm on this stage, is because

92
0:03:39.85,000 --> 0:03:42,000
what that tells us is something deep about the early universe.

93
0:03:43.318,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It tells us that we

94
0:03:44.982,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and everything we see around us

95
0:03:46.418,000 --> 0:03:48,000
are basically one large bubble --

96
0:03:49.372,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and this is the idea of inflation—

97
0:03:51.128,000 --> 0:03:54,000
one large bubble surrounded by something else.

98
0:03:55.02,000 --> 0:03:57,000
This isn't conclusive evidence for inflation,

99
0:03:57.15,000 --> 0:03:59,000
but anything that isn't inflation that explains this

100
0:03:59.324,000 --> 0:04:,000
will look the same.

101
0:04:00.641,000 --> 0:04:01,000
This is a theory, an idea,

102
0:04:02.286,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that has been around for a while,

103
0:04:03.51,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and we never thought we we'd really see it.

104
0:04:05.235,000 --> 0:04:06,000
For good reasons, we thought we'd never see

105
0:04:07.073,000 --> 0:04:09,000
killer evidence, and this is killer evidence.

106
0:04:09.321,000 --> 0:04:11,000
But the really crazy idea

107
0:04:11.331,000 --> 0:04:14,000
is that our bubble is just one bubble

108
0:04:14.363,000 --> 0:04:18,000
in a much larger, roiling pot of universal stuff.

109
0:04:18.989,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We're never going to see the stuff outside,

110
0:04:20.815,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but by going to the South Pole and spending three years

111
0:04:23.389,000 --> 0:04:25,000
looking at the detailed structure of the night sky,

112
0:04:25.949,000 --> 0:04:26,000
we can figure out

113
0:04:27.805,000 --> 0:04:3,000
that we're probably in a universe that looks kind of like that.

114
0:04:30.895,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And that amazes me.

115
0:04:33.317,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Thanks a lot.

116
0:04:34.653,000 --> 0:04:36,000
(Applause)

0:00:26.031,000 --> 0:00:28,000
(Music: "The Sound of Silence," Simon & Garfunkel)

2
0:00:28.539,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Hello voice mail, my old friend.

3
0:00:31,000 --> 0:00:32,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:32.687,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I've called for tech support again.

5
0:00:36.568,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I ignored my boss's warning.

6
0:00:40.197,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I called on a Monday morning.

7
0:00:43.537,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Now it's evening, and my dinner first grew cold, and then grew mold.

8
0:00:49.679,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I'm still on hold.

9
0:00:51.977,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I'm listening to the sounds of silence.

10
0:00:57.585,000 --> 0:01:,000
I don't think you understand.

11
0:01:00.666,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I think your phone lines are unmanned.

12
0:01:04.516,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I punched every touch tone I was told,

13
0:01:07.812,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but I've still spent 18 hours on hold.

14
0:01:10.999,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It's not enough your software crashed my Mac,

15
0:01:14,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and it constantly hangs and bombs --

16
0:01:17.561,000 --> 0:01:19,000
it erased my ROMs!

17
0:01:20.145,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Now the Mac makes the sounds of silence.

18
0:01:25.309,000 --> 0:01:28,000
In my dreams I fantasize

19
0:01:28.666,000 --> 0:01:31,000
of wreaking vengeance on you guys.

20
0:01:32.265,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Say your motorcycle crashes.

21
0:01:35.764,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Blood comes gushing from your gashes.

22
0:01:39.095,000 --> 0:01:45,000
With your fading strength, you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained MD.

23
0:01:45.702,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But you get me.

24
0:01:47.346,000 --> 0:01:48,000
(Laughter)

25
0:01:48.813,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And you listen to the sounds of silence.

26
0:01:53.035,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Music)

27
0:01:55.948,000 --> 0:01:57,000
(Applause)

28
0:01:58.17,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Thank you.

29
0:01:59.345,000 --> 0:02:,000
Good evening and welcome to:

30
0:02:00.717,000 --> 0:02:02,000
"Spot the TED Presenter Who Used to Be a Broadway Accompanist."

31
0:02:03.729,000 --> 0:02:04,000
(Laughter)

32
0:02:04.891,000 --> 0:02:07,000
When I was offered the Times column six years ago,

33
0:02:08.43,000 --> 0:02:09,000
the deal was like this:

34
0:02:09.662,000 --> 0:02:12,000
you'll be sent the coolest, hottest, slickest new gadgets.

35
0:02:13.065,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Every week, it'll arrive at your door.

36
0:02:15,000 --> 0:02:17,000
You get to try them out, play with them, evaluate them

37
0:02:17.677,000 --> 0:02:2,000
until the novelty wears out, before you have to send them back,

38
0:02:20.773,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and you'll get paid for it.

39
0:02:22.124,000 --> 0:02:24,000
You can think about it, if you want.

40
0:02:24.646,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So, I've always been a technology nut, and I absolutely love it.

41
0:02:29.295,000 --> 0:02:31,000
The job, though, came with one small downside, and that is,

42
0:02:32.256,000 --> 0:02:36,000
they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column.

43
0:02:37.84,000 --> 0:02:42,000
And what I've noticed is -- first of all, you get an incredible amount of email.

44
0:02:43.079,000 --> 0:02:44,000
If you ever are feeling lonely,

45
0:02:44.838,000 --> 0:02:45,000
get a New York Times column,

46
0:02:46.242,000 --> 0:02:49,000
because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails.

47
0:02:49.4,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And the email I'm getting a lot today is about frustration.

48
0:02:53,000 --> 0:02:56,000
People are feeling like things --

49
0:02:56.373,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Ok, I just had an alarm come up on my screen.

50
0:02:58.707,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Lucky you can't see it.

51
0:03:00.12,000 --> 0:03:01,000
People are feeling overwhelmed.

52
0:03:01.643,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They're feeling like it's too much technology, too fast.

53
0:03:04.287,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It may be good technology,

54
0:03:06,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but I feel like there's not enough of a support structure.

55
0:03:09.012,000 --> 0:03:1,000
There's not enough help.

56
0:03:10.618,000 --> 0:03:12,000
There's not enough thought put into the design of it

57
0:03:13.088,000 --> 0:03:14,000
to make it easy and enjoyable to use.

58
0:03:15.042,000 --> 0:03:18,000
One time I wrote a column about my efforts to reach Dell Technical Support,

59
0:03:19.054,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and within 12 hours, there were 700 messages

60
0:03:23.167,000 --> 0:03:26,000
from readers on the feedback boards on the Times website,

61
0:03:26.382,000 --> 0:03:27,000
from users saying,

62
0:03:28.298,000 --> 0:03:3,000
""Me too, and here's my tale of woe."

63
0:03:30.736,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I call it "software rage."

64
0:03:33.146,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And man, let me tell you,

65
0:03:34.369,000 --> 0:03:38,000
whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will --

66
0:03:38.816,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Oh, how did that get up there? Just kidding.

67
0:03:41.121,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:42.293,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Ok, so why is the problem accelerating?

69
0:03:45.196,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And part of the problem is, ironically,

70
0:03:47.185,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because the industry has put so much thought

71
0:03:49.304,000 --> 0:03:5,000
into making things easier to use.

72
0:03:51.281,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I'll show you what I mean.

73
0:03:52.906,000 --> 0:03:56,000
This is what the computer interface used to look like, DOS.

74
0:03:57.365,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Over the years, it's gotten easier to use.

75
0:04:00.223,000 --> 0:04:02,000
This is the original Mac operating system.

76
0:04:02.803,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Reagan was President. Madonna was still a brunette.

77
0:04:05.938,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And the entire operating system --

78
0:04:07.691,000 --> 0:04:12,000
this is the good part -- the entire operating system fit in 211 k.

79
0:04:12.875,000 --> 0:04:15,000
You couldn't put the Mac OS X logo in 211 k!

80
0:04:16.001,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:17.637,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So the irony is, that as these things became easier to use,

82
0:04:21.464,000 --> 0:04:24,000
a less technical, broader audience was coming into contact

83
0:04:25.344,000 --> 0:04:26,000
with this equipment for the first time.

84
0:04:27.313,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the Apple call center

85
0:04:33.002,000 --> 0:04:34,000
for a day.

86
0:04:34.186,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to.

87
0:04:37,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And the calls that -- you know how they say,

88
0:04:40.55,000 --> 0:04:42,000
"Your call may be recorded for quality assurance?"

89
0:04:43.304,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Uh-uh.

90
0:04:44.597,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Your call may be recorded

91
0:04:46,000 --> 0:04:48,000
so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories

92
0:04:48.692,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and pass them around on a CD.

93
0:04:50.207,000 --> 0:04:51,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:51.271,000 --> 0:04:52,000
Which they do.

95
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:54.616,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And I have a copy.

97
0:04:55.862,000 --> 0:04:56,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:56.909,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It's in your gift bag. No, no.

99
0:04:59.027,000 --> 0:05:01,000
With your voices on it!

100
0:05:01.222,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable.

101
0:05:06.405,000 --> 0:05:09,000
A woman called Apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking.

102
0:05:09.772,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Making a squeaking noise.

103
0:05:11.018,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And the technician said,

104
0:05:12.212,000 --> 0:05:14,000
"Well, ma'am, what do you mean your mouse is squeaking?"

105
0:05:14.887,000 --> 0:05:16,000
She says, "All I can tell you is that it squeaks louder,

106
0:05:17.554,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the faster I move it across the screen."

107
0:05:20.188,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:22.283,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And the technician's like,

109
0:05:23.569,000 --> 0:05:26,000
"Ma'am, you've got the mouse up against the screen?"

110
0:05:26.743,000 --> 0:05:29,000
She goes, "Well, the message said, 'Click here to continue.'"

111
0:05:29.86,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

112
0:05:32.949,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Well, if you like that one -- how much time have we got?

113
0:05:36.822,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Another one, a guy called -- this is absolutely true --

114
0:05:39.518,000 --> 0:05:41,000
his computer had crashed, and he told the technician

115
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:46,000
he couldn't restart it, no matter how many times he typed "11."

116
0:05:46.218,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And the technician said, "What? Why are you typing 11?"

117
0:05:49.392,000 --> 0:05:52,000
He said, "The message says, 'Error Type 11.'"

118
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

119
0:05:57.399,000 --> 0:05:59,000
So, we must admit

120
0:06:00.328,000 --> 0:06:03,000
that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users.

121
0:06:05.573,000 --> 0:06:07,000
But why is the technical overload crisis,

122
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the complexity crisis, accelerating now?

123
0:06:10.604,000 --> 0:06:12,000
In the hardware world, it's because we the consumers want

124
0:06:13.407,000 --> 0:06:15,000
everything to be smaller, smaller, smaller.

125
0:06:15.615,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier,

126
0:06:18.202,000 --> 0:06:2,000
but our fingers are essentially staying the same size.

127
0:06:20.829,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So it gets to be more and more of a challenge.

128
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Software is subject to another primal force:

129
0:06:25.12,000 --> 0:06:27,000
the mandate to release more and more versions.

130
0:06:27.733,000 --> 0:06:28,000
When you buy a piece of software,

131
0:06:29.353,000 --> 0:06:31,000
it's not like buying a vase or a candy bar, where you own it.

132
0:06:32.265,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's more like joining a club, where you pay dues every year,

133
0:06:35.657,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and every year, they say,

134
0:06:36.936,000 --> 0:06:4,000
"We've added more features, and we'll sell it to you for $99."

135
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:45,000
I know one guy who's spent $4,000 just on Photoshop over the years.

136
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And software companies make 35 percent of their revenue

137
0:06:48.863,000 --> 0:06:49,000
from just these software upgrades.

138
0:06:50.643,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I call it the Software Upgrade Paradox --

139
0:06:53.542,000 --> 0:06:56,000
which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times,

140
0:06:57.415,000 --> 0:06:58,000
you eventually ruin it.

141
0:06:58.934,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I mean, Microsoft Word was last just a word processor in, you know,

142
0:07:03.123,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the Eisenhower administration.

143
0:07:04.713,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

144
0:07:05.785,000 --> 0:07:06,000
But what's the alternative?

145
0:07:07.172,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Microsoft actually did this experiment.

146
0:07:09.208,000 --> 0:07:1,000
They said, "Well, wait a minute.

147
0:07:10.78,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Everyone complains that we're adding so many features.

148
0:07:13.352,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Let's create a word processor that's just a word processor:

149
0:07:16.175,000 --> 0:07:19,000
Simple, pure; does not do web pages, is not a database."

150
0:07:19.428,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And it came out, and it was called Microsoft Write.

151
0:07:22.858,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And none of you are nodding in acknowledgment, because it died.

152
0:07:26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
It tanked. No one ever bought it.

153
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I call this the Sport Utility Principle.

154
0:07:30.427,000 --> 0:07:34,000
People like to surround themselves with unnecessary power, right?

155
0:07:34.691,000 --> 0:07:37,000
They don't need the database and the website, but they're like,

156
0:07:38.024,000 --> 0:07:41,000
"Well, I'll upgrade, because, I might, you know, I might need that someday."

157
0:07:42,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So the problem is: as you add more features, where are they going to go?

158
0:07:45.582,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Where are you going to stick them? You only have so many design tools.

159
0:07:49.746,000 --> 0:07:52,000
You can do buttons, you can do sliders, pop-up menus, sub-menus.

160
0:07:53.762,000 --> 0:07:56,000
But if you're not careful about how you choose,

161
0:07:56.811,000 --> 0:07:57,000
you wind up with this.

162
0:07:58,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Laughter)

163
0:07:59.771,000 --> 0:08:01,000
This is an un-retouched -- this is not a joke --

164
0:08:02.627,000 --> 0:08:04,000
un-retouched photo of Microsoft Word,

165
0:08:04.913,000 --> 0:08:06,000
the copy that you have, with all the toolbars open.

166
0:08:07.771,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You've obviously never opened all the toolbars,

167
0:08:11.117,000 --> 0:08:15,000
but all you have to type in is this little, teeny window down here.

168
0:08:15.883,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Laughter)

169
0:08:18.466,000 --> 0:08:21,000
And we've arrived at the age of interface matrices,

170
0:08:21.935,000 --> 0:08:23,000
where there are so many features and options,

171
0:08:24.101,000 --> 0:08:25,000
you have to do two dimensions, you know:

172
0:08:26.045,000 --> 0:08:27,000
a vertical and a horizontal.

173
0:08:27.412,000 --> 0:08:28,000
You guys all complain

174
0:08:28.593,000 --> 0:08:3,000
about how Microsoft Word is always bulleting your lists

175
0:08:31.355,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and underlining your links automatically.

176
0:08:33.473,000 --> 0:08:36,000
The off switch is in there somewhere.

177
0:08:36.632,000 --> 0:08:37,000
I'm telling you -- it's there.

178
0:08:38.235,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Part of the art of designing a simple, good interface,

179
0:08:41.503,000 --> 0:08:44,000
is knowing when to use which one of these features.

180
0:08:45.011,000 --> 0:08:48,000
So, here is the log-off dialogue box for Windows 2000.

181
0:08:48.56,000 --> 0:08:5,000
There are only four choices,

182
0:08:51.084,000 --> 0:08:54,000
so why are they in a pop-up menu?

183
0:08:54.164,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components

184
0:08:57.504,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that you need to collapse the choices.

185
0:09:,000 --> 0:09:01,000
They could have put them all out in view.

186
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Here's Apple's take on the exact same dialogue box.

187
0:09:05,000 --> 0:09:06,000
(Applause)

188
0:09:06.427,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Thank you -- yes, I designed the dialogue box. No, no.

189
0:09:1,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Already, we can see that Apple and Microsoft

190
0:09:12.639,000 --> 0:09:15,000
have a severely divergent approach to software design.

191
0:09:16.799,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Microsoft's approach to simplicity tends to be:

192
0:09:20.156,000 --> 0:09:22,000
let's break it down; let's just make it more steps.

193
0:09:23,000 --> 0:09:24,000
There are these "wizards" everywhere.

194
0:09:25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And you know, there's a new version of Windows coming out this fall.

195
0:09:28.263,000 --> 0:09:31,000
If they continue at this pace, there's absolutely no telling

196
0:09:31.342,000 --> 0:09:33,000
where they might wind up.

197
0:09:33.512,000 --> 0:09:35,000
[Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard]

198
0:09:35.874,000 --> 0:09:36,000
(Laughter)

199
0:09:37.066,000 --> 0:09:4,000
(Applause)

200
0:09:40.38,000 --> 0:09:41,000
"Welcome to the Type a Word Wizard."

201
0:09:42.189,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Ok, I'll bite.

202
0:09:43.428,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Let's click "Next" to continue.

203
0:09:46,000 --> 0:09:48,000
(Laughter)

204
0:09:48.327,000 --> 0:09:49,000
(Applause)

205
0:09:50.198,000 --> 0:09:53,000
From the drop-down menu, choose the first letter you want to type. Ok.

206
0:09:53.572,000 --> 0:09:55,000
(Laughter)

207
0:09:55.929,000 --> 0:09:57,000
So there is a limit that we don't want to cross.

208
0:09:58.492,000 --> 0:09:59,000
So what is the answer?

209
0:09:59.667,000 --> 0:10:03,000
How do you pack in all these features in a simple, intelligent way?

210
0:10:03.767,000 --> 0:10:05,000
I believe in consistency, when possible,

211
0:10:06.496,000 --> 0:10:07,000
real-world equivalents,

212
0:10:07.822,000 --> 0:10:1,000
trash can folder, when possible, label things, mostly.

213
0:10:11.069,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But I beg of the designers here

214
0:10:13.269,000 --> 0:10:16,000
to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all,

215
0:10:16.864,000 --> 0:10:17,000
which is intelligence.

216
0:10:18.077,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Now what do I mean by that?

217
0:10:19.404,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I'm going to give you some examples

218
0:10:21.119,000 --> 0:10:24,000
where intelligence makes something not consistent, but it's better.

219
0:10:24.475,000 --> 0:10:26,000
If you are buying something on the web,

220
0:10:26.886,000 --> 0:10:27,000
you're supposed to put in your address,

221
0:10:28.791,000 --> 0:10:3,000
and you're supposed to choose what country you're from, ok?

222
0:10:31.649,000 --> 0:10:32,000
There are 200 countries in the world.

223
0:10:33.451,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We like to think of the Internet as a global village.

224
0:10:35.983,000 --> 0:10:36,000
I'm sorry; it's not one yet.

225
0:10:37.378,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's mainly like, the United States, Europe, and Japan.

226
0:10:40.006,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So why is "United States" in the "U"s?

227
0:10:42.381,000 --> 0:10:43,000
(Laughter)

228
0:10:43.771,000 --> 0:10:45,000
You have to scroll, like, seven screensful to get to it.

229
0:10:46.724,000 --> 0:10:49,000
Now, it would be inconsistent to put "United States" first,

230
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:51,000
but it would be intelligent.

231
0:10:51.495,000 --> 0:10:53,000
This one's been touched on before,

232
0:10:54.152,000 --> 0:10:57,000
but why in God's name do you shut down a Windows PC

233
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:,000
by clicking a button called "Start?"

234
0:11:00.423,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Laughter)

235
0:11:04.515,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Here's another pet one of mine: you have a printer.

236
0:11:08,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Most of the time, you want to print one copy of your document,

237
0:11:11.893,000 --> 0:11:13,000
in page order, on that printer.

238
0:11:14.169,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So why in God's name do you see this every time you print?

239
0:11:18.794,000 --> 0:11:2,000
It's like a 747 shuttle cockpit.

240
0:11:21.286,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Laughter)

241
0:11:22.873,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And one of the buttons at the bottom, you'll notice, is not "Print."

242
0:11:26.665,000 --> 0:11:3,000
(Laughter)

243
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:34,000
(Applause)

244
0:11:34.294,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Now, I'm not saying that Apple is the only company who has embraced

245
0:11:38.247,000 --> 0:11:4,000
the cult of simplicity.

246
0:11:40.827,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Palm is also, especially in the old days, wonderful about this.

247
0:11:43.831,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I actually got to speak to Palm when they were flying high in the '90s,

248
0:11:47.213,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and after the talk, I met one of the employees.

249
0:11:49.441,000 --> 0:11:52,000
He says, "Nice talk." And I said, "Thank you. What do you do here?"

250
0:11:52.646,000 --> 0:11:54,000
He said, "I'm a tap counter." I'm like, "You're a what?"

251
0:11:55.311,000 --> 0:11:57,000
He goes, "Well Jeff Hawkins, the CEO, says,

252
0:11:57.367,000 --> 0:12:01,000
'If any task on the Palm Pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus,

253
0:12:01.6,000 --> 0:12:03,000
it's too long, and it has to be redesigned.'

254
0:12:04.622,000 --> 0:12:05,000
So I'm the tap counter."

255
0:12:06.414,000 --> 0:12:07,000
So, I'm going to show you an example

256
0:12:08.2,000 --> 0:12:1,000
of a company that does not have a tap counter.

257
0:12:10.846,000 --> 0:12:11,000
(Laughter)

258
0:12:12.133,000 --> 0:12:13,000
This is Microsoft Word.

259
0:12:13.728,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Ok, when you want to create a new blank document in Word --

260
0:12:17.886,000 --> 0:12:18,000
it could happen.

261
0:12:19.062,000 --> 0:12:24,000
(Laughter)

262
0:12:24.434,000 --> 0:12:27,000
You go up to the "File" menu and you choose "New."

263
0:12:27.917,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Now, what happens when you choose "New?"

264
0:12:30.14,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Do you get a new blank document?

265
0:12:32.193,000 --> 0:12:33,000
You do not.

266
0:12:33.408,000 --> 0:12:37,000
On the opposite side of the monitor, a task bar appears,

267
0:12:38.123,000 --> 0:12:41,000
and somewhere in those links -- by the way, not at the top --

268
0:12:41.909,000 --> 0:12:45,000
somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document.

269
0:12:46.377,000 --> 0:12:48,000
Ok, so that is a company not counting taps.

270
0:12:49.394,000 --> 0:12:52,000
You know, I don't want to just stand here and make fun of Microsoft ...

271
0:12:53.222,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Yes, I do.

272
0:12:54.548,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Laughter)

273
0:12:56,000 --> 0:12:59,000
(Applause)

274
0:12:59.619,000 --> 0:13:,000
The Bill Gates song!

275
0:13:01.017,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Piano music)

276
0:13:02.469,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I've been a geek forever

277
0:13:05.928,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and I wrote the very first DOS.

278
0:13:10.168,000 --> 0:13:13,000
I put my software and IBM together;

279
0:13:13.727,000 --> 0:13:16,000
I got profit and they got the loss.

280
0:13:17,000 --> 0:13:19,000
(Laughter)

281
0:13:19.702,000 --> 0:13:23,000
I write the code that makes the whole world run.

282
0:13:24.344,000 --> 0:13:28,000
I'm getting royalties from everyone.

283
0:13:28.781,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Sometimes it's garbage, but the press is snowed.

284
0:13:33.431,000 --> 0:13:35,000
You buy the box; I'll sell the code.

285
0:13:39.113,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Every software company is doing Microsoft's R&D.

286
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:48,000
You can't keep a good idea down these days.

287
0:13:48.156,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Even Windows is a hack.

288
0:13:50.359,000 --> 0:13:52,000
We're kind of based loosely on the Mac.

289
0:13:52.709,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So it's big, so it's slow. You've got nowhere to go.

290
0:13:55.441,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I'm not doing this for praise.

291
0:13:58.642,000 --> 0:14:02,000
I write the code that fits the world today.

292
0:14:03.483,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Big mediocrity in every way.

293
0:14:07.704,000 --> 0:14:11,000
We've entered planet domination mode.

294
0:14:12,000 --> 0:14:15,000
You'll have no choice; you'll buy my code.

295
0:14:17.902,000 --> 0:14:22,000
I am Bill Gates and I write the code.

296
0:14:25.173,000 --> 0:14:31,000
(Applause)

297
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
But actually, I believe there are really two Microsofts.

298
0:14:35.726,000 --> 0:14:38,000
There's the old one, responsible for Windows and Office.

299
0:14:38.829,000 --> 0:14:42,000
They're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh, but they can't.

300
0:14:42.867,000 --> 0:14:45,000
They're locked in, because so many add-ons and other company stuff

301
0:14:46.591,000 --> 0:14:48,000
locks into the old 1982 chassis.

302
0:14:49.236,000 --> 0:14:5,000
But there's also a new Microsoft,

303
0:14:50.85,000 --> 0:14:53,000
that's really doing good, simple interface designs.

304
0:14:54.365,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I liked the Media Center PC.

305
0:14:55.945,000 --> 0:14:56,000
I liked the Microsoft SPOT Watch.

306
0:14:57.725,000 --> 0:14:59,000
The Wireless Watch flopped miserably in the market,

307
0:15:00.702,000 --> 0:15:03,000
but it wasn't because it wasn't simply and beautifully designed.

308
0:15:03.774,000 --> 0:15:04,000
But let's put it this way:

309
0:15:05.044,000 --> 0:15:07,000
would you pay $10 a month to have a watch

310
0:15:07.559,000 --> 0:15:1,000
that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone,

311
0:15:10.841,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and stops working when you leave your area code?

312
0:15:13.404,000 --> 0:15:15,000
(Laughter)

313
0:15:16.026,000 --> 0:15:18,000
So, the signs might indicate

314
0:15:18.551,000 --> 0:15:2,000
that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse.

315
0:15:21.412,000 --> 0:15:22,000
So is there any hope?

316
0:15:23.089,000 --> 0:15:25,000
The screens are getting smaller, people are illuminating,

317
0:15:25.812,000 --> 0:15:26,000
putting manuals in the boxes,

318
0:15:27.233,000 --> 0:15:29,000
things are coming out at a faster pace.

319
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:33,000
It's funny -- when Steve Jobs came back to Apple in 1997,

320
0:15:33.417,000 --> 0:15:35,000
after 12 years away, it was the MacWorld Expo --

321
0:15:36.266,000 --> 0:15:39,000
he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans,

322
0:15:39.432,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and he sort of did this.

323
0:15:40.608,000 --> 0:15:42,000
The crowd went wild, but I had just seen --

324
0:15:43,000 --> 0:15:44,000
I'm like, where have I seen this before?

325
0:15:44.95,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I had just seen the movie "Evita" --

326
0:15:46.783,000 --> 0:15:49,000
(Laughter)

327
0:15:49.892,000 --> 0:15:5,000
with Madonna,

328
0:15:51.074,000 --> 0:15:52,000
and I'm like, you know what?

329
0:15:52.846,000 --> 0:15:55,000
I've got to do one about Steve Jobs.

330
0:15:55.967,000 --> 0:15:56,000
(Music)

331
0:15:56.999,000 --> 0:15:59,000
It won't be easy. You'll think I'm strange.

332
0:16:00.039,000 --> 0:16:01,000
(Laughter)

333
0:16:01.207,000 --> 0:16:03,000
When I try to explain why I'm back,

334
0:16:03.54,000 --> 0:16:06,000
after telling the press Apple's future is black.

335
0:16:06.655,000 --> 0:16:08,000
You won't believe me.

336
0:16:09.274,000 --> 0:16:13,000
All that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage

337
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:16,000
with only a buddy named Woz.

338
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:18,000
(Laughter)

339
0:16:18.576,000 --> 0:16:19,000
You try rhyming with garage!

340
0:16:20.333,000 --> 0:16:22,000
(Laughter)

341
0:16:22.799,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Don't cry for me, Cupertino.

342
0:16:25.698,000 --> 0:16:26,000
(Laughter)

343
0:16:27.044,000 --> 0:16:29,000
The truth is, I never left you.

344
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:33,000
I know the ropes now, know what the tricks are.

345
0:16:33.559,000 --> 0:16:36,000
I made a fortune over at Pixar.

346
0:16:37,000 --> 0:16:38,000
(Laughter)

347
0:16:38.063,000 --> 0:16:4,000
Don't cry for me, Cupertino.

348
0:16:41.182,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I've still got the drive and vision.

349
0:16:44.519,000 --> 0:16:47,000
I still wear sandals in any weather.

350
0:16:47.995,000 --> 0:16:48,000
It's just that these days,

351
0:16:5,000 --> 0:16:51,000
they're Gucci leather.

352
0:16:52,000 --> 0:16:53,000
(Laughter)

353
0:16:54,000 --> 0:17:,000
(Applause)

354
0:17:01.258,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Thank you.

355
0:17:02.815,000 --> 0:17:06,000
So Steve Jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty.

356
0:17:07.547,000 --> 0:17:08,000
And the truth is,

357
0:17:09.468,000 --> 0:17:11,000
for years I was a little depressed,

358
0:17:11.62,000 --> 0:17:13,000
because Americans obviously did not value it,

359
0:17:13.917,000 --> 0:17:15,000
because the Mac had three percent market share,

360
0:17:16.218,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Windows had 95 percent market share --

361
0:17:18.099,000 --> 0:17:2,000
people did not think it was worth putting a price on it.

362
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:22,000
So I was a little depressed.

363
0:17:22.815,000 --> 0:17:23,000
And then I heard Al Gore's talk,

364
0:17:24.396,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and I realized I didn't know the meaning of depressed.

365
0:17:26.959,000 --> 0:17:27,000
(Laughter)

366
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:29,000
But it turns out I was wrong, right?

367
0:17:29.761,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Because the iPod came out,

368
0:17:31.518,000 --> 0:17:33,000
and it violated every bit of common wisdom.

369
0:17:34.16,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Other products cost less; other products had more features,

370
0:17:37.16,000 --> 0:17:39,000
they had voice recorders and FM transmitters.

371
0:17:39.921,000 --> 0:17:42,000
The other products were backed by Microsoft, with an open standard,

372
0:17:43.167,000 --> 0:17:44,000
not Apple's propriety standard.

373
0:17:44.905,000 --> 0:17:46,000
But the iPod won -- this is the one they wanted.

374
0:17:47.501,000 --> 0:17:49,000
The lesson was: simplicity sells.

375
0:17:49.788,000 --> 0:17:51,000
And there are signs that the industry is getting the message.

376
0:17:52.686,000 --> 0:17:55,000
This is a little company that's done very well with simplicity and elegance.

377
0:17:56.301,000 --> 0:17:57,000
The Sonos thing -- it's catching on.

378
0:17:58.064,000 --> 0:17:59,000
I've got just a couple examples.

379
0:17:59.786,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Physically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately.

380
0:18:03.486,000 --> 0:18:04,000
When you have a digital camera,

381
0:18:05.463,000 --> 0:18:08,000
how do you get the pictures back to your computer?

382
0:18:08.73,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Well, you either haul around a USB cable,

383
0:18:11.096,000 --> 0:18:13,000
or you buy a card reader and haul that around.

384
0:18:13.276,000 --> 0:18:14,000
Either one, you're going to lose.

385
0:18:14.887,000 --> 0:18:16,000
What I do is, I take out the memory card,

386
0:18:17.37,000 --> 0:18:22,000
and I fold it in half, revealing USB contacts.

387
0:18:22.739,000 --> 0:18:24,000
I just stick it in the computer, offload the pictures,

388
0:18:25.421,000 --> 0:18:26,000
put it right back in the camera.

389
0:18:26.984,000 --> 0:18:27,000
I never have to lose anything.

390
0:18:28.808,000 --> 0:18:29,000
Here's another example.

391
0:18:30.369,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Chris, you're the source of all power. Will you be my power plug?

392
0:18:33.463,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Chris Anderson: Oh yeah. DP: Hold that and don't let go.

393
0:18:36.227,000 --> 0:18:38,000
You might've seen this, this is Apple's new laptop.

394
0:18:38.672,000 --> 0:18:4,000
This the power cord. It hooks on like this.

395
0:18:40.72,000 --> 0:18:43,000
And I'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives,

396
0:18:44.141,000 --> 0:18:45,000
or one of your children.

397
0:18:45.34,000 --> 0:18:47,000
You walk along -- and I'm about to pull this onto the floor.

398
0:18:48.189,000 --> 0:18:49,000
I don't care. It's a loaner.

399
0:18:49.549,000 --> 0:18:5,000
Here we go. Whoa!

400
0:18:50.756,000 --> 0:18:53,000
It's magnetic -- it doesn't pull the laptop onto the floor.

401
0:18:53.849,000 --> 0:18:57,000
(Applause)

402
0:18:58,000 --> 0:18:59,000
In my very last example --

403
0:18:59.993,000 --> 0:19:02,000
I do a lot of my work using speech recognition software.

404
0:19:03.993,000 --> 0:19:05,000
And I'll just -- you have to be kind of quiet

405
0:19:06.247,000 --> 0:19:07,000
because the software is nervous.

406
0:19:08.524,000 --> 0:19:1,000
Speech recognition software is really great

407
0:19:10.628,000 --> 0:19:12,000
for doing emails very quickly; period.

408
0:19:13.182,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Like, I get hundreds of them a day; period.

409
0:19:15.845,000 --> 0:19:18,000
And it's not just what I dictate that it writes down; period.

410
0:19:19.16,000 --> 0:19:22,000
I also use this feature called voice macros; period.

411
0:19:23.92,000 --> 0:19:24,000
Correct "dissuade."

412
0:19:28.999,000 --> 0:19:29,000
Not "just."

413
0:19:32.248,000 --> 0:19:33,000
Ok, this is not an ideal situation,

414
0:19:33.954,000 --> 0:19:35,000
because it's getting the echo from the hall and stuff.

415
0:19:36.517,000 --> 0:19:4,000
The point is, I can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word,

416
0:19:40.777,000 --> 0:19:42,000
and having it write out a much longer thing.

417
0:19:42.873,000 --> 0:19:44,000
So if somebody sends me a fan letter, I'll say,

418
0:19:45.263,000 --> 0:19:46,000
"Thanks for that."

419
0:19:46.444,000 --> 0:19:48,000
[Thank you so much for taking the time to write ...]

420
0:19:48.975,000 --> 0:19:49,000
(Laughter)

421
0:19:5,000 --> 0:19:52,000
(Applause)

422
0:19:53,000 --> 0:19:57,000
And conversely, if somebody sends me hate mail --

423
0:19:57.462,000 --> 0:19:59,000
which happens daily --

424
0:19:59.788,000 --> 0:20:01,000
I say, "Piss off."

425
0:20:04.508,000 --> 0:20:05,000
(Laughter)

426
0:20:05.849,000 --> 0:20:07,000
[I admire your frankness ...]

427
0:20:08.345,000 --> 0:20:09,000
(Laughter)

428
0:20:1,000 --> 0:20:15,000
(Applause)

429
0:20:15.377,000 --> 0:20:17,000
So that's my dirty little secret. Don't tell anyone.

430
0:20:18,000 --> 0:20:19,000
(Laughter)

431
0:20:19.139,000 --> 0:20:21,000
So the point is -- this is a really interesting story.

432
0:20:22,000 --> 0:20:23,000
This is version eight of this software,

433
0:20:23.902,000 --> 0:20:25,000
and do you know what they put in version eight?

434
0:20:26.124,000 --> 0:20:29,000
No new features. It's never happened before in software!

435
0:20:29.21,000 --> 0:20:3,000
The company put no new features.

436
0:20:30.965,000 --> 0:20:33,000
They just said, "We'll make this software work right." Right?

437
0:20:34.604,000 --> 0:20:37,000
Because for years, people had bought this software, tried it out --

438
0:20:37.844,000 --> 0:20:38,000
95 percent accuracy was all they got,

439
0:20:39.669,000 --> 0:20:4,000
which means one in 20 words is wrong --

440
0:20:41.589,000 --> 0:20:42,000
and they'd put it in their drawer.

441
0:20:43.24,000 --> 0:20:44,000
And the company got sick of that,

442
0:20:44.844,000 --> 0:20:46,000
so they said, "This version, we're not going to do anything,

443
0:20:47.704,000 --> 0:20:48,000
but make sure it's darned accurate."

444
0:20:49.461,000 --> 0:20:5,000
And so that's what they did.

445
0:20:50.834,000 --> 0:20:52,000
This cult of doing things right is starting to spread.

446
0:20:53.446,000 --> 0:20:56,000
So, my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology:

447
0:20:56.966,000 --> 0:21:,000
remember, if it doesn't work, it's not necessarily you, ok?

448
0:21:01,000 --> 0:21:03,000
It could be the design of the thing you're using.

449
0:21:03.358,000 --> 0:21:05,000
Be aware in life of good design and bad design.

450
0:21:06.17,000 --> 0:21:08,000
And if you're among the people who create this stuff:

451
0:21:09.061,000 --> 0:21:1,000
Easy is hard.

452
0:21:10.404,000 --> 0:21:12,000
Pre-sweat the details for your audience.

453
0:21:12.762,000 --> 0:21:13,000
Count the taps.

454
0:21:14,000 --> 0:21:16,000
Remember, the hard part is not deciding what features to add,

455
0:21:16.967,000 --> 0:21:17,000
it's deciding what to leave out.

456
0:21:18.76,000 --> 0:21:21,000
And best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells.

457
0:21:22.611,000 --> 0:21:23,000
CA: Bravo. DP: Thank you very much.

458
0:21:24.302,000 --> 0:21:25,000
CA: Hear, hear!

459
0:21:25.477,000 --> 0:21:27,000
(Applause)

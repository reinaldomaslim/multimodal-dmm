1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I am a conductor,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I'm here today

3
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to talk to you about trust.

4
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
My job depends upon it.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
There has to be, between me and the orchestra,

6
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
an unshakable bond of trust,

7
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
born out of mutual respect,

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
through which we can spin a musical narrative

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
that we all believe in.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Now in the old days, conducting, music making,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
was less about trust and more, frankly, about coercion.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Up to and around about the Second World War,

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
conductors were invariably dictators --

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
these tyrannical figures

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
who would rehearse, not just the orchestra as a whole, but individuals within it,

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
within an inch of their lives.

17
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
But I'm happy to say now that the world has moved on,

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
music has moved on with it.

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
We now have a more democratic view and way of making music --

20
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
a two-way street.

21
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I, as the conductor, have to come to the rehearsal with a cast-iron sense

22
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
of the outer architecture of that music,

23
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
within which there is then immense personal freedom

24
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
for the members of the orchestra to shine.

25
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
For myself, of course,

26
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I have to completely trust my body language.

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
That's all I have at the point of sale.

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It's silent gesture.

29
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I can hardly bark out instructions while we're playing.

30
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Music)

31
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Ladies and gentlemen, the Scottish Ensemble.

32
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
(Applause)

33
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So in order for all this to work,

34
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
obviously I have got to be in a position of trust.

35
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I have to trust the orchestra,

36
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and, even more crucially, I have to trust myself.

37
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Think about it: when you're in a position of not trusting,

38
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
what do you do?

39
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
You overcompensate.

40
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And in my game, that means you overgesticulate.

41
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
You end up like some kind of rabid windmill.

42
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And the bigger your gesture gets,

43
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
the more ill-defined, blurry

44
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and, frankly, useless it is to the orchestra.

45
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
You become a figure of fun. There's no trust anymore, only ridicule.

46
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And I remember at the beginning of my career,

47
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
again and again, on these dismal outings with orchestras,

48
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I would be going completely insane on the podium,

49
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
trying to engender a small scale crescendo really,

50
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
just a little upsurge in volume.

51
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Bugger me, they wouldn't give it to me.

52
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
I spent a lot of time in those early years

53
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
weeping silently in dressing rooms.

54
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And how futile seemed the words of advice to me

55
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
from great British veteran conductor Sir Colin Davis

56
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
who said, "Conducting, Charles,

57
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
is like holding a small bird in your hand.

58
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
If you hold it too tightly, you crush it.

59
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
If you hold it too loosely, it flies away."

60
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I have to say, in those days, I couldn't really even find the bird.

61
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Now a fundamental

62
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and really viscerally important experience for me, in terms of music,

63
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
has been my adventures in South Africa,

64
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the most dizzyingly musical country on the planet in my view,

65
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but a country which, through its musical culture,

66
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
has taught me one fundamental lesson:

67
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that through music making

68
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
can come deep levels

69
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
of fundamental life-giving trust.

70
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Back in 2000, I had the opportunity to go to South Africa

71
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
to form a new opera company.

72
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So I went out there, and I auditioned,

73
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
mainly in rural township locations, right around the country.

74
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
I heard about 2,000 singers

75
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and pulled together a company

76
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
of 40 of the most jaw-droppingly amazing young performers,

77
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the majority of whom were black,

78
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
but there were a handful of white performers.

79
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Now it emerged early on in the first rehearsal period

80
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that one of those white performers

81
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
had, in his previous incarnation,

82
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
been a member of the South African police force.

83
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And in the last years of the old regime,

84
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
he would routinely be detailed to go into the township

85
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
to aggress the community.

86
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Now you can imagine what this knowledge did to the temperature in the room,

87
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
the general atmosphere.

88
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Let's be under no illusions.

89
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
In South Africa, the relationship most devoid of trust

90
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
is that between a white policeman

91
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and the black community.

92
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
So how do we recover from that, ladies and gentlemen?

93
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Simply through singing.

94
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
We sang, we sang,

95
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
we sang,

96
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and amazingly new trust grew,

97
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and indeed friendship blossomed.

98
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And that showed me such a fundamental truth,

99
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that music making and other forms of creativity

100
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
can so often go to places

101
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
where mere words cannot.

102
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So we got some shows off the ground. We started touring them internationally.

103
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
One of them was "Carmen."

104
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
We then thought we'd make a movie of "Carmen,"

105
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
which we recorded and shot outside on location

106
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in the township outside Cape Town called Khayelitsha.

107
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
The piece was sung entirely in Xhosa,

108
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
which is a beautifully musical language, if you don't know it.

109
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
It's called "U-Carmen e-Khayelitsha" --

110
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
literally "Carmen of Khayelitsha."

111
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I want to play you a tiny clip of it now

112
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
for no other reason than to give you proof positive

113
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
that there is nothing tiny about South African music making.

114
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Music)

115
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Applause)

116
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Something which I find utterly enchanting

117
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
about South African music making

118
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
is that it's so free.

119
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
South Africans just make music really freely.

120
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And I think, in no small way,

121
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that's due to one fundamental fact:

122
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
they're not bound to a system of notation.

123
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
They don't read music.

124
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They trust their ears.

125
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
You can teach a bunch of South Africans a tune in about five seconds flat.

126
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
And then, as if by magic,

127
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
they will spontaneously improvise a load of harmony around that tune

128
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
because they can.

129
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Now those of us that live in the West, if I can use that term,

130
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
I think have a much more hidebound attitude or sense of music --

131
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
that somehow it's all about skill and systems.

132
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Therefore it's the exclusive preserve

133
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
of an elite, talented body.

134
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
And yet, ladies and gentlemen, every single one of us on this planet

135
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
probably engages with music on a daily basis.

136
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And if I can broaden this out for a second,

137
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I'm willing to bet that every single one of you sitting in this room

138
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
would be happy to speak with acuity, with total confidence,

139
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
about movies, probably about literature.

140
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
But how many of you would be able to make a confident assertion

141
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
about a piece of classical music?

142
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Why is this?

143
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And what I'm going to say to you now

144
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
is I'm just urging you to get over

145
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
this supreme lack of self-confidence,

146
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to take the plunge, to believe that you can trust your ears,

147
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
you can hear some of the fundamental muscle tissue,

148
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
fiber, DNA,

149
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
what makes a great piece of music great.

150
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I've got a little experiment I want to try with you.

151
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Did you know

152
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that TED is a tune?

153
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
A very simple tune based on three notes -- T, E, D.

154
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Now hang on a minute.

155
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
I know you're going to say to me, "T doesn't exist in music."

156
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Well ladies and gentlemen, there's a time-honored system,

157
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
which composers have been using for hundreds of years,

158
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
which proves actually that it does.

159
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
If I sing you a musical scale: A, B, C, D, E, F, G --

160
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and I just carry on with the next set of letters in the alphabet, same scale:

161
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
H, I, J, K, L, M, N,

162
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
O, P, Q, R, S, T -- there you go.

163
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
T, see it's the same as F in music.

164
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
So T is F.

165
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
So T, E, D is the same as F, E, D.

166
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now that piece of music that we played at the start of this session

167
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
had enshrined in its heart

168
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
the theme, which is TED.

169
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Have a listen.

170
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
(Music)

171
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Do you hear it?

172
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Or do I smell some doubt in the room?

173
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Okay, we'll play it for you again now,

174
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and we're going to highlight, we're going to poke out the T, E, D.

175
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
If you'll pardon the expression.

176
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Music)

177
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Oh my goodness me, there it was loud and clear, surely.

178
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I think we should make this even more explicit.

179
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
Ladies and gentlemen, it's nearly time for tea.

180
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Would you reckon you need to sing for your tea, I think?

181
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I think we need to sing for our tea.

182
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We're going to sing those three wonderful notes: T, E, D.

183
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Will you have a go for me?

184
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Audience: T, E, D.

185
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Charles Hazlewood: Yeah, you sound a bit more like cows really than human beings.

186
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Shall we try that one again?

187
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
And look, if you're adventurous, you go up the octave.

188
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
T, E, D.

189
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Audience: T, E, D.

190
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
CH: Once more with vim. (Audience: T, E, D.)

191
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
There I am like a bloody windmill again, you see.

192
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Now we're going to put that in the context of the music.

193
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
The music will start, and then at a signal from me, you will sing that.

194
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Music)

195
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
One more time,

196
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
with feeling, ladies and gentlemen.

197
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
You won't make the key otherwise.

198
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Well done, ladies and gentlemen.

199
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It wasn't a bad debut for the TED choir,

200
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
not a bad debut at all.

201
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Now there's a project that I'm initiating at the moment

202
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that I'm very excited about and wanted to share with you,

203
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because it is all about changing perceptions,

204
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and, indeed, building a new level of trust.

205
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
The youngest of my children was born with cerebral palsy,

206
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
which as you can imagine,

207
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
if you don't have an experience of it yourself,

208
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
is quite a big thing to take on board.

209
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
But the gift that my gorgeous daughter has given me,

210
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
aside from her very existence,

211
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
is that it's opened my eyes to a whole stretch of the community

212
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
that was hitherto hidden,

213
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
the community of disabled people.

214
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And I found myself looking at the Paralympics and thinking how incredible

215
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
how technology's been harnessed to prove beyond doubt

216
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
that disability is no barrier

217
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
to the highest levels of sporting achievement.

218
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Of course there's a grimmer side to that truth,

219
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
which is that it's actually taken decades for the world at large

220
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
to come to a position of trust,

221
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to really believe that disability and sports can go together

222
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
in a convincing and interesting fashion.

223
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
So I find myself asking:

224
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
where is music in all of this?

225
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
You can't tell me that there aren't millions of disabled people,

226
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
in the U.K. alone,

227
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
with massive musical potential.

228
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
So I decided to create a platform for that potential.

229
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
It's going to be Britain's first ever

230
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
national disabled orchestra.

231
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It's called Paraorchestra.

232
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I'm going to show you a clip now

233
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
of the very first improvisation session that we had.

234
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
It was a really extraordinary moment.

235
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
Just me and four astonishingly gifted disabled musicians.

236
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Normally when you improvise --

237
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and I do it all the time around the world --

238
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
there's this initial period of horror,

239
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
like everyone's too frightened to throw the hat into the ring,

240
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
an awful pregnant silence.

241
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Then suddenly, as if by magic, bang! We're all in there

242
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and it's complete bedlam. You can't hear anything.

243
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
No one's listening. No one's trusting.

244
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
No one's responding to each other.

245
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Now in this room with these four disabled musicians,

246
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
within five minutes

247
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
a rapt listening, a rapt response

248
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
and some really insanely beautiful music.

249
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
(Video) (Music)

250
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Nicholas:: My name's Nicholas McCarthy.

251
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I'm 22, and I'm a left-handed pianist.

252
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And I was born without my left hand -- right hand.

253
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Can I do that one again?

254
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
(Music)

255
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Lyn: When I'm making music,

256
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I feel like a pilot in the cockpit flying an airplane.

257
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
I become alive.

258
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
(Music)

259
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Clarence: I would rather be able to play an instrument again

260
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
than walk.

261
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
There's so much joy and things

262
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
I could get from playing an instrument and performing.

263
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
It's removed some of my paralysis.

264
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
(Music)

265
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
(Applause)

266
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
CH: I only wish that some of those musicians were here with us today,

267
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
so you could see at firsthand how utterly extraordinary they are.

268
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Paraorchestra is the name of that project.

269
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
If any of you thinks you want to help me in any way

270
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
to achieve what is a fairly impossible and implausible dream still at this point,

271
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
please let me know.

272
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Now my parting shot

273
0:14:39.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
comes courtesy of the great Joseph Haydn,

274
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
wonderful Austrian composer in the second half of the 18th century --

275
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
spent the bulk of his life

276
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
in the employ of Prince Nikolaus Esterhazy, along with his orchestra.

277
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Now this prince loved his music,

278
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
but he also loved the country castle that he tended to reside in most of the time,

279
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
which is just on the Austro-Hungarian border,

280
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
a place called Esterhazy --

281
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
a long way from the big city of Vienna.

282
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Now one day in 1772,

283
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
the prince decreed that the musicians' families,

284
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
the orchestral musicians' families,

285
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
were no longer welcome in the castle.

286
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
They weren't allowed to stay there anymore; they had to be returned to Vienna --

287
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
as I say, an unfeasibly long way away in those days.

288
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
You can imagine, the musicians were disconsolate.

289
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Haydn remonstrated with the prince, but to no avail.

290
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
So given the prince loved his music,

291
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Haydn thought he'd write a symphony to make the point.

292
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And we're going to play just the very tail end of this symphony now.

293
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And you'll see the orchestra in a kind of sullen revolt.

294
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
I'm pleased to say, the prince did take the tip

295
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
from the orchestral performance,

296
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and the musicians were reunited with their families.

297
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
But I think it sums up my talk rather well, this,

298
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
that where there is trust,

299
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
there is music -- by extension life.

300
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
Where there is no trust,

301
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
the music quite simply withers away.

302
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:16:06,000
(Music)

303
0:19:06.26,000 --> 0:19:29,000
(Applause)

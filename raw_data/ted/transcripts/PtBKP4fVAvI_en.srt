1
0:00:12.564,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My students and I work on very tiny robots.

2
0:00:16.209,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Now, you can think of these as robotic versions

3
0:00:18.426,000 --> 0:00:21,000
of something that you're all very familiar with: an ant.

4
0:00:22.016,000 --> 0:00:24,000
We all know that ants and other insects at this size scale

5
0:00:24.776,000 --> 0:00:26,000
can do some pretty incredible things.

6
0:00:27.012,000 --> 0:00:3,000
We've all seen a group of ants, or some version of that,

7
0:00:30.197,000 --> 0:00:34,000
carting off your potato chip at a picnic, for example.

8
0:00:34.467,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But what are the real challenges of engineering these ants?

9
0:00:37.91,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Well, first of all, how do we get the capabilities of an ant

10
0:00:41.861,000 --> 0:00:43,000
in a robot at the same size scale?

11
0:00:43.909,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Well, first we need to figure out how to make them move

12
0:00:46.513,000 --> 0:00:47,000
when they're so small.

13
0:00:47.923,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We need mechanisms like legs and efficient motors

14
0:00:50.223,000 --> 0:00:51,000
in order to support that locomotion,

15
0:00:52.072,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and we need the sensors, power and control

16
0:00:54.563,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in order to pull everything together in a semi-intelligent ant robot.

17
0:00:58.525,000 --> 0:01:,000
And finally, to make these things really functional,

18
0:01:01.071,000 --> 0:01:04,000
we want a lot of them working together in order to do bigger things.

19
0:01:05.019,000 --> 0:01:07,000
So I'll start with mobility.

20
0:01:07.71,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Insects move around amazingly well.

21
0:01:10.871,000 --> 0:01:11,000
This video is from UC Berkeley.

22
0:01:12.559,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It shows a cockroach moving over incredibly rough terrain

23
0:01:15.342,000 --> 0:01:16,000
without tipping over,

24
0:01:17.195,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and it's able to do this because its legs are a combination of rigid materials,

25
0:01:21.192,000 --> 0:01:23,000
which is what we traditionally use to make robots,

26
0:01:23.545,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and soft materials.

27
0:01:26.374,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Jumping is another really interesting way to get around when you're very small.

28
0:01:30.201,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So these insects store energy in a spring and release that really quickly

29
0:01:34.27,000 --> 0:01:38,000
to get the high power they need to jump out of water, for example.

30
0:01:38.281,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So one of the big contributions from my lab

31
0:01:41.403,000 --> 0:01:43,000
has been to combine rigid and soft materials

32
0:01:44.153,000 --> 0:01:46,000
in very, very small mechanisms.

33
0:01:46.367,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So this jumping mechanism is about four millimeters on a side,

34
0:01:49.532,000 --> 0:01:5,000
so really tiny.

35
0:01:51.22,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The hard material here is silicon, and the soft material is silicone rubber.

36
0:01:55.058,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And the basic idea is that we're going to compress this,

37
0:01:57.953,000 --> 0:01:59,000
store energy in the springs, and then release it to jump.

38
0:02:00.654,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So there's no motors on board this right now, no power.

39
0:02:04.037,000 --> 0:02:06,000
This is actuated with a method that we call in my lab

40
0:02:06.8,000 --> 0:02:08,000
"graduate student with tweezers." (Laughter)

41
0:02:09.472,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So what you'll see in the next video

42
0:02:11.306,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is this guy doing amazingly well for its jumps.

43
0:02:14.333,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So this is Aaron, the graduate student in question, with the tweezers,

44
0:02:17.947,000 --> 0:02:19,000
and what you see is this four-millimeter-sized mechanism

45
0:02:20.63,000 --> 0:02:22,000
jumping almost 40 centimeters high.

46
0:02:22.841,000 --> 0:02:24,000
That's almost 100 times its own length.

47
0:02:25.265,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And it survives, bounces on the table,

48
0:02:27.221,000 --> 0:02:3,000
it's incredibly robust, and of course survives quite well until we lose it

49
0:02:30.735,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because it's very tiny.

50
0:02:33.361,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Ultimately, though, we want to add motors to this too,

51
0:02:35.97,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and we have students in the lab working on millimeter-sized motors

52
0:02:39.086,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to eventually integrate onto small, autonomous robots.

53
0:02:42.686,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But in order to look at mobility and locomotion at this size scale to start,

54
0:02:46.267,000 --> 0:02:47,000
we're cheating and using magnets.

55
0:02:48.241,000 --> 0:02:51,000
So this shows what would eventually be part of a micro-robot leg,

56
0:02:51.317,000 --> 0:02:53,000
and you can see the silicone rubber joints

57
0:02:53.334,000 --> 0:02:55,000
and there's an embedded magnet that's being moved around

58
0:02:55.963,000 --> 0:02:57,000
by an external magnetic field.

59
0:02:58.266,000 --> 0:03:,000
So this leads to the robot that I showed you earlier.

60
0:03:01.959,000 --> 0:03:04,000
The really interesting thing that this robot can help us figure out

61
0:03:05.11,000 --> 0:03:07,000
is how insects move at this scale.

62
0:03:07.117,000 --> 0:03:09,000
We have a really good model for how everything

63
0:03:09.342,000 --> 0:03:1,000
from a cockroach up to an elephant moves.

64
0:03:11.304,000 --> 0:03:13,000
We all move in this kind of bouncy way when we run.

65
0:03:14.228,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But when I'm really small, the forces between my feet and the ground

66
0:03:18.513,000 --> 0:03:2,000
are going to affect my locomotion a lot more than my mass,

67
0:03:21.288,000 --> 0:03:23,000
which is what causes that bouncy motion.

68
0:03:23.642,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So this guy doesn't work quite yet,

69
0:03:25.317,000 --> 0:03:28,000
but we do have slightly larger versions that do run around.

70
0:03:28.392,000 --> 0:03:31,000
So this is about a centimeter cubed, a centimeter on a side, so very tiny,

71
0:03:32.277,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and we've gotten this to run about 10 body lengths per second,

72
0:03:35.179,000 --> 0:03:36,000
so 10 centimeters per second.

73
0:03:36.565,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It's pretty quick for a little, small guy,

74
0:03:38.598,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and that's really only limited by our test setup.

75
0:03:40.96,000 --> 0:03:42,000
But this gives you some idea of how it works right now.

76
0:03:44.027,000 --> 0:03:47,000
We can also make 3D-printed versions of this that can climb over obstacles,

77
0:03:47.781,000 --> 0:03:5,000
a lot like the cockroach that you saw earlier.

78
0:03:51.28,000 --> 0:03:53,000
But ultimately we want to add everything onboard the robot.

79
0:03:54.166,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We want sensing, power, control, actuation all together,

80
0:03:57.859,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and not everything needs to be bio-inspired.

81
0:04:00.765,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So this robot's about the size of a Tic Tac.

82
0:04:03.9,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And in this case, instead of magnets or muscles to move this around,

83
0:04:07.849,000 --> 0:04:09,000
we use rockets.

84
0:04:10.274,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So this is a micro-fabricated energetic material,

85
0:04:12.94,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and we can create tiny pixels of this,

86
0:04:15.539,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and we can put one of these pixels on the belly of this robot,

87
0:04:19.326,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and this robot, then, is going to jump when it senses an increase in light.

88
0:04:24.645,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So the next video is one of my favorites.

89
0:04:26.618,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So you have this 300-milligram robot

90
0:04:29.658,000 --> 0:04:31,000
jumping about eight centimeters in the air.

91
0:04:32.064,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It's only four by four by seven millimeters in size.

92
0:04:34.974,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And you'll see a big flash at the beginning

93
0:04:37.13,000 --> 0:04:38,000
when the energetic is set off,

94
0:04:38.622,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and the robot tumbling through the air.

95
0:04:40.53,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So there was that big flash,

96
0:04:42.139,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and you can see the robot jumping up through the air.

97
0:04:45.336,000 --> 0:04:48,000
So there's no tethers on this, no wires connecting to this.

98
0:04:48.368,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Everything is onboard, and it jumped in response

99
0:04:50.862,000 --> 0:04:54,000
to the student just flicking on a desk lamp next to it.

100
0:04:55.243,000 --> 0:04:58,000
So I think you can imagine all the cool things that we could do

101
0:04:58.897,000 --> 0:05:02,000
with robots that can run and crawl and jump and roll at this size scale.

102
0:05:03.604,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Imagine the rubble that you get after a natural disaster like an earthquake.

103
0:05:07.394,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Imagine these small robots running through that rubble

104
0:05:09.953,000 --> 0:05:11,000
to look for survivors.

105
0:05:12.171,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Or imagine a lot of small robots running around a bridge

106
0:05:15.127,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in order to inspect it and make sure it's safe

107
0:05:17.286,000 --> 0:05:19,000
so you don't get collapses like this,

108
0:05:19.326,000 --> 0:05:22,000
which happened outside of Minneapolis in 2007.

109
0:05:23.233,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Or just imagine what you could do

110
0:05:24.995,000 --> 0:05:26,000
if you had robots that could swim through your blood.

111
0:05:27.518,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Right? "Fantastic Voyage," Isaac Asimov.

112
0:05:29.851,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Or they could operate without having to cut you open in the first place.

113
0:05:34.206,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Or we could radically change the way we build things

114
0:05:36.936,000 --> 0:05:39,000
if we have our tiny robots work the same way that termites do,

115
0:05:40.343,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and they build these incredible eight-meter-high mounds,

116
0:05:43.108,000 --> 0:05:47,000
effectively well ventilated apartment buildings for other termites

117
0:05:47.196,000 --> 0:05:49,000
in Africa and Australia.

118
0:05:49.287,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So I think I've given you some of the possibilities

119
0:05:51.717,000 --> 0:05:53,000
of what we can do with these small robots.

120
0:05:54.154,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And we've made some advances so far, but there's still a long way to go,

121
0:05:58.561,000 --> 0:06:,000
and hopefully some of you can contribute to that destination.

122
0:06:01.419,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Thanks very much.

123
0:06:03.187,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Applause)

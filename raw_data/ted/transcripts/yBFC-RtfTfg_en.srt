1
0:00:13.44,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Along the ancient path of the Monongahela River,

2
0:00:17.223,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Braddock, Pennsylvania sits in the eastern region of Allegheny County,

3
0:00:22.981,000 --> 0:00:26,000
approximately nine miles outside of Pittsburgh.

4
0:00:28.488,000 --> 0:00:3,000
An industrial suburb,

5
0:00:30.829,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Braddock is home to Andrew Carnegie's first steel mill,

6
0:00:34.57,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the Edgar Thomson Works.

7
0:00:37.008,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Operating since 1875,

8
0:00:39.56,000 --> 0:00:44,000
it is the last functioning steel mill in the region.

9
0:00:45.39,000 --> 0:00:49,000
For 12 years, I have produced collaborative portraits,

10
0:00:50.101,000 --> 0:00:54,000
still lifes, landscapes and aerial views

11
0:00:54.373,000 --> 0:00:59,000
in order to build a visual archive to address the intersection

12
0:00:59.724,000 --> 0:01:,000
of the steel industry,

13
0:01:01.571,000 --> 0:01:02,000
the environment,

14
0:01:03.429,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and the health care system's impact on the bodies of my family and community.

15
0:01:11.277,000 --> 0:01:14,000
The tradition and grand narrative of Braddock

16
0:01:14.644,000 --> 0:01:19,000
is mostly comprised of stories of industrialists and trade unions.

17
0:01:20.727,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Currently, the new narrative about Braddock,

18
0:01:25.027,000 --> 0:01:28,000
a poster child for Rust Belt revitalization,

19
0:01:28.564,000 --> 0:01:32,000
is a story of urban pioneers discovering a new frontier.

20
0:01:34.744,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Mass media has omitted the fact that Braddock is predominantly black.

21
0:01:41.066,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Our existence has been co-opted, silenced and erased.

22
0:01:47.731,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Fourth generation in a lineage of women,

23
0:01:51.967,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I was raised under the protection and care of Grandma Ruby,

24
0:01:56.657,000 --> 0:02:,000
off 8th Street at 805 Washington Avenue.

25
0:02:01.562,000 --> 0:02:05,000
She worked as a manager for Goodwill.

26
0:02:07.02,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Mom was a nurse's aid.

27
0:02:08.814,000 --> 0:02:14,000
She watched the steel mills close and white flight to suburban developments.

28
0:02:16.708,000 --> 0:02:18,000
By the time my generation walked the streets,

29
0:02:19.332,000 --> 0:02:24,000
disinvestment at the local, state and federal level,

30
0:02:24.586,000 --> 0:02:25,000
eroded infrastructure,

31
0:02:26.483,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and the War on Drugs dismantled my family and community.

32
0:02:33.89,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Grandma Ruby's stepfather Gramps

33
0:02:36.305,000 --> 0:02:4,000
was one of few black men to retire from Carnegie's mill with his pension.

34
0:02:40.994,000 --> 0:02:42,000
He worked in high temperatures,

35
0:02:43.201,000 --> 0:02:48,000
tearing down and rebuilding furnaces, cleaning up spilt metal and slag.

36
0:02:49.586,000 --> 0:02:55,000
The history of a place is written on the body and the landscape.

37
0:02:57.766,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Areas of heavy truck traffic,

38
0:03:00.244,000 --> 0:03:04,000
exposure to benzene and atomized metals,

39
0:03:04.609,000 --> 0:03:07,000
risk cancer and lupus.

40
0:03:10.39,000 --> 0:03:15,000
One hundred twenty-three licensed beds, 652 employees,

41
0:03:15.847,000 --> 0:03:19,000
rehabilitation programs decimated.

42
0:03:23.486,000 --> 0:03:26,000
A housing discrimination lawsuit against Allegheny County

43
0:03:27.363,000 --> 0:03:32,000
removed where the projects Talbot Towers once stood.

44
0:03:33.215,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Recent rezoning for more light industry has since appeared.

45
0:03:39.568,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Google Maps and Google Earth pixelations conceal the flammable waste

46
0:03:45.595,000 --> 0:03:5,000
being used to squeeze the Bunn family off their home and land.

47
0:03:53.529,000 --> 0:03:57,000
In 2013, I chartered a helicopter

48
0:03:57.545,000 --> 0:04:02,000
with my cameras to document this aggressive dispossession.

49
0:04:05.371,000 --> 0:04:09,000
In flight, my observation reveals thousands of plastic white bundles

50
0:04:10.252,000 --> 0:04:13,000
owned by a conservation industry

51
0:04:13.728,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that claims it's eco-friendly

52
0:04:15.981,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and recycles millions of tires

53
0:04:18.697,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to preserve people's lives

54
0:04:21.484,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and to improve people's lives.

55
0:04:25.5,000 --> 0:04:29,000
My work spirals from the micro to the macro level,

56
0:04:30.461,000 --> 0:04:33,000
excavating hidden histories.

57
0:04:33.688,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Recently, at the Seattle Art Museum,

58
0:04:36.196,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Isaac Bunn and I mounted this exhibition,

59
0:04:40.166,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and the exhibition was used as a platform to launch his voice.

60
0:04:46.133,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Through reclamation of our narrative,

61
0:04:49.82,000 --> 0:04:54,000
we will continue to fight historic erasure and socioeconomic inequality.

62
0:04:56.179,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Thank you.

63
0:04:58.37,000 --> 0:05:02,000
(Applause)

Translator: Joseph Geni Reviewer: Morton Bast

2
0:00:15.728,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'm here to talk to you about how globalized we are,

3
0:00:20.259,000 --> 0:00:22,000
how globalized we aren't,

4
0:00:22.767,000 --> 0:00:25,000
and why it's important to actually be accurate

5
0:00:26.311,000 --> 0:00:28,000
in making those kinds of assessments.

6
0:00:29.092,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And the leading point of view on this, whether measured

7
0:00:32.832,000 --> 0:00:36,000
by number of books sold, mentions in media,

8
0:00:37.023,000 --> 0:00:4,000
or surveys that I've run with groups ranging from

9
0:00:40.239,000 --> 0:00:44,000
my students to delegates to the World Trade Organization,

10
0:00:44.316,000 --> 0:00:47,000
is this view that national borders

11
0:00:47.43,000 --> 0:00:5,000
really don't matter very much anymore,

12
0:00:50.983,000 --> 0:00:54,000
cross-border integration is close to complete,

13
0:00:55.039,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and we live in one world.

14
0:00:57.334,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And what's interesting about this view

15
0:00:59.566,000 --> 0:01:02,000
is, again, it's a view that's held by pro-globalizers

16
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
like Tom Friedman, from whose book this quote is obviously excerpted,

17
0:01:07.934,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but it's also held by anti-globalizers, who see this giant

18
0:01:11.86,000 --> 0:01:15,000
globalization tsunami that's about to wreck all our lives

19
0:01:16.751,000 --> 0:01:18,000
if it hasn't already done so.

20
0:01:19.635,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The other thing I would add is that this is not a new view.

21
0:01:23.659,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I'm a little bit of an amateur historian, so I've spent

22
0:01:27.37,000 --> 0:01:3,000
some time going back, trying to see the first mention

23
0:01:31.351,000 --> 0:01:34,000
of this kind of thing. And the best, earliest quote

24
0:01:35.07,000 --> 0:01:38,000
that I could find was one from David Livingstone,

25
0:01:38.914,000 --> 0:01:44,000
writing in the 1850s about how the railroad, the steam ship,

26
0:01:44.959,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and the telegraph were integrating East Africa perfectly

27
0:01:49.426,000 --> 0:01:52,000
with the rest of the world.

28
0:01:52.797,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Now clearly, David Livingstone

29
0:01:54.977,000 --> 0:01:57,000
was a little bit ahead of his time,

30
0:01:57.997,000 --> 0:02:,000
but it does seem useful to ask ourselves,

31
0:02:01.54,000 --> 0:02:03,000
"Just how global are we?"

32
0:02:03.636,000 --> 0:02:05,000
before we think about where we go from here.

33
0:02:06.339,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So the best way I've found of trying to get people

34
0:02:10.877,000 --> 0:02:14,000
to take seriously the idea that the world may not be flat,

35
0:02:15.526,000 --> 0:02:19,000
may not even be close to flat, is with some data.

36
0:02:19.541,000 --> 0:02:22,000
So one of the things I've been doing over the last few years

37
0:02:22.92,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is really compiling data on things that could either happen

38
0:02:26.887,000 --> 0:02:3,000
within national borders or across national borders,

39
0:02:31.042,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and I've looked at the cross-border component

40
0:02:34.545,000 --> 0:02:36,000
as a percentage of the total.

41
0:02:36.958,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I'm not going to present all the data that I have here today,

42
0:02:40.923,000 --> 0:02:43,000
but let me just give you a few data points.

43
0:02:44.529,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I'm going to talk a little bit about one kind of information flow,

44
0:02:48.863,000 --> 0:02:52,000
one kind of flow of people, one kind of flow of capital,

45
0:02:53.731,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and, of course, trade in products and services.

46
0:02:57.212,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So let's start off with plain old telephone service.

47
0:03:01.791,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Of all the voice-calling minutes in the world last year,

48
0:03:06.884,000 --> 0:03:1,000
what percentage do you think were accounted for

49
0:03:11.532,000 --> 0:03:13,000
by cross-border phone calls?

50
0:03:13.857,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Pick a percentage in your own mind.

51
0:03:17.933,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The answer turns out to be two percent.

52
0:03:21.028,000 --> 0:03:25,000
If you include Internet telephony, you might be able

53
0:03:25.166,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to push this number up to six or seven percent,

54
0:03:28.593,000 --> 0:03:32,000
but it's nowhere near what people tend to estimate.

55
0:03:33.25,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Or let's turn to people moving across borders.

56
0:03:36.995,000 --> 0:03:39,000
One particular thing we might look at, in terms of

57
0:03:40.212,000 --> 0:03:43,000
long-term flows of people, is what percentage

58
0:03:43.939,000 --> 0:03:46,000
of the world's population is accounted for

59
0:03:47.451,000 --> 0:03:5,000
by first-generation immigrants?

60
0:03:50.459,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Again, please pick a percentage.

61
0:03:54.754,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Turns out to be a little bit higher.

62
0:03:57.179,000 --> 0:04:,000
It's actually about three percent.

63
0:04:00.246,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Or think of investment. Take all the real investment

64
0:04:05.117,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that went on in the world in 2010.

65
0:04:08.285,000 --> 0:04:1,000
What percentage of that was accounted for

66
0:04:11.141,000 --> 0:04:14,000
by foreign direct investment?

67
0:04:15.078,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Not quite ten percent.

68
0:04:18.445,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And then finally, the one statistic

69
0:04:21.084,000 --> 0:04:24,000
that I suspect many of the people in this room have seen:

70
0:04:24.261,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the export-to-GDP ratio.

71
0:04:26.989,000 --> 0:04:29,000
If you look at the official statistics, they typically indicate

72
0:04:30.758,000 --> 0:04:32,000
a little bit above 30 percent.

73
0:04:33.317,000 --> 0:04:38,000
However, there's a big problem with the official statistics,

74
0:04:38.406,000 --> 0:04:42,000
in that if, for instance, a Japanese component supplier

75
0:04:43.337,000 --> 0:04:46,000
ships something to China to be put into an iPod,

76
0:04:46.949,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and then the iPod gets shipped to the U.S.,

77
0:04:49.75,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that component ends up getting counted multiple times.

78
0:04:53.587,000 --> 0:04:55,000
So nobody knows how bad this bias

79
0:04:56.356,000 --> 0:04:59,000
with the official statistics actually is, so I thought I would

80
0:05:00.143,000 --> 0:05:02,000
ask the person who's spearheading the effort

81
0:05:02.727,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to generate data on this, Pascal Lamy,

82
0:05:05.992,000 --> 0:05:07,000
the Director of the World Trade Organization,

83
0:05:08.504,000 --> 0:05:1,000
what his best guess would be

84
0:05:10.831,000 --> 0:05:13,000
of exports as a percentage of GDP,

85
0:05:14.006,000 --> 0:05:16,000
without the double- and triple-counting,

86
0:05:16.429,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and it's actually probably a bit under 20 percent, rather than

87
0:05:20.963,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the 30 percent-plus numbers that we're talking about.

88
0:05:24.732,000 --> 0:05:28,000
So it's very clear that if you look at these numbers

89
0:05:28.915,000 --> 0:05:31,000
or all the other numbers that I talk about in my book,

90
0:05:32.483,000 --> 0:05:36,000
"World 3.0," that we're very, very far from

91
0:05:36.87,000 --> 0:05:4,000
the no-border effect benchmark, which would imply

92
0:05:40.924,000 --> 0:05:46,000
internationalization levels of the order of 85, 90, 95 percent.

93
0:05:47.827,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So clearly, apocalyptically-minded authors

94
0:05:51.435,000 --> 0:05:53,000
have overstated the case.

95
0:05:54.395,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But it's not just the apocalyptics, as I think of them,

96
0:05:58.587,000 --> 0:06:01,000
who are prone to this kind of overstatement.

97
0:06:01.812,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I've also spent some time surveying audiences

98
0:06:05.209,000 --> 0:06:06,000
in different parts of the world

99
0:06:07.207,000 --> 0:06:11,000
on what they actually guess these numbers to be.

100
0:06:11.267,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Let me share with you the results of a survey

101
0:06:14.336,000 --> 0:06:17,000
that Harvard Business Review was kind enough to run

102
0:06:17.675,000 --> 0:06:2,000
of its readership as to what people's guesses

103
0:06:21.195,000 --> 0:06:25,000
along these dimensions actually were.

104
0:06:25.61,000 --> 0:06:3,000
So a couple of observations stand out for me from this slide.

105
0:06:31.545,000 --> 0:06:35,000
First of all, there is a suggestion of some error.

106
0:06:36.46,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Okay. (Laughter)

107
0:06:39.263,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Second, these are pretty large errors. For four quantities

108
0:06:44.736,000 --> 0:06:46,000
whose average value is less than 10 percent,

109
0:06:47.715,000 --> 0:06:51,000
you have people guessing three, four times that level.

110
0:06:51.817,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Even though I'm an economist, I find that

111
0:06:54.905,000 --> 0:06:56,000
a pretty large error.

112
0:06:57.309,000 --> 0:07:,000
And third, this is not just confined to the readers

113
0:07:01.171,000 --> 0:07:02,000
of the Harvard Business Review.

114
0:07:03.131,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I've run several dozen such surveys in different parts

115
0:07:06.529,000 --> 0:07:09,000
of the world, and in all cases except one,

116
0:07:09.879,000 --> 0:07:11,000
where a group actually underestimated

117
0:07:12.751,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the trade-to-GDP ratio, people have this tendency

118
0:07:17.063,000 --> 0:07:2,000
towards overestimation, and so I thought it important

119
0:07:20.222,000 --> 0:07:23,000
to give a name to this, and that's what I refer to

120
0:07:23.527,000 --> 0:07:27,000
as globaloney, the difference between the dark blue bars

121
0:07:28.104,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and the light gray bars.

122
0:07:31.111,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Especially because, I suspect, some of you may still be

123
0:07:35.247,000 --> 0:07:39,000
a little bit skeptical of the claims, I think it's important

124
0:07:39.439,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to just spend a little bit of time thinking about

125
0:07:42.703,000 --> 0:07:45,000
why we might be prone to globaloney.

126
0:07:46.462,000 --> 0:07:48,000
A couple of different reasons come to mind.

127
0:07:49.305,000 --> 0:07:53,000
First of all, there's a real dearth of data in the debate.

128
0:07:53.607,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Let me give you an example. When I first published

129
0:07:56.788,000 --> 0:07:58,000
some of these data a few years ago

130
0:07:59.384,000 --> 0:08:01,000
in a magazine called Foreign Policy,

131
0:08:01.921,000 --> 0:08:04,000
one of the people who wrote in, not entirely in agreement,

132
0:08:05.491,000 --> 0:08:08,000
was Tom Friedman. And since my article was titled

133
0:08:09.446,000 --> 0:08:13,000
"Why the World Isn't Flat," that wasn't too surprising. (Laughter)

134
0:08:14.356,000 --> 0:08:18,000
What was very surprising to me was Tom's critique,

135
0:08:18.637,000 --> 0:08:22,000
which was, "Ghemawat's data are narrow."

136
0:08:23.575,000 --> 0:08:26,000
And this caused me to scratch my head, because

137
0:08:26.594,000 --> 0:08:29,000
as I went back through his several-hundred-page book,

138
0:08:29.731,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I couldn't find a single figure, chart, table,

139
0:08:34.364,000 --> 0:08:36,000
reference or footnote.

140
0:08:37.092,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So my point is, I haven't presented a lot of data here

141
0:08:41.699,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to convince you that I'm right, but I would urge you

142
0:08:45.091,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to go away and look for your own data

143
0:08:48.076,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to try and actually assess whether some of these

144
0:08:51.564,000 --> 0:08:55,000
hand-me-down insights that we've been bombarded with

145
0:08:55.925,000 --> 0:08:56,000
actually are correct.

146
0:08:57.837,000 --> 0:09:,000
So dearth of data in the debate is one reason.

147
0:09:01.369,000 --> 0:09:04,000
A second reason has to do with peer pressure.

148
0:09:05.284,000 --> 0:09:08,000
I remember, I decided to write my

149
0:09:08.465,000 --> 0:09:1,000
"Why the World Isn't Flat" article, because

150
0:09:11.09,000 --> 0:09:14,000
I was being interviewed on TV in Mumbai,

151
0:09:14.279,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and the interviewer's first question to me was,

152
0:09:17.954,000 --> 0:09:2,000
"Professor Ghemawat, why do you still believe

153
0:09:21.905,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that the world is round?" And I started laughing,

154
0:09:26.085,000 --> 0:09:29,000
because I hadn't come across that formulation before. (Laughter)

155
0:09:29.858,000 --> 0:09:31,000
And as I was laughing, I was thinking,

156
0:09:32.197,000 --> 0:09:34,000
I really need a more coherent response, especially

157
0:09:35.084,000 --> 0:09:39,000
on national TV. I'd better write something about this. (Laughter)

158
0:09:39.194,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But what I can't quite capture for you

159
0:09:42.163,000 --> 0:09:44,000
was the pity and disbelief

160
0:09:44.763,000 --> 0:09:47,000
with which the interviewer asked her question.

161
0:09:48.241,000 --> 0:09:52,000
The perspective was, here is this poor professor.

162
0:09:52.581,000 --> 0:09:56,000
He's clearly been in a cave for the last 20,000 years.

163
0:09:57.267,000 --> 0:09:59,000
He really has no idea

164
0:09:59.915,000 --> 0:10:01,000
as to what's actually going on in the world.

165
0:10:02.873,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So try this out with your friends and acquaintances,

166
0:10:06.346,000 --> 0:10:09,000
if you like. You'll find that it's very cool

167
0:10:09.787,000 --> 0:10:12,000
to talk about the world being one, etc.

168
0:10:13.075,000 --> 0:10:16,000
If you raise questions about that formulation,

169
0:10:16.378,000 --> 0:10:19,000
you really are considered a bit of an antique.

170
0:10:20.275,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And then the final reason, which I mention,

171
0:10:23.729,000 --> 0:10:26,000
especially to a TED audience, with some trepidation,

172
0:10:27.442,000 --> 0:10:3,000
has to do with what I call "techno-trances."

173
0:10:30.787,000 --> 0:10:33,000
If you listen to techno music for long periods of time,

174
0:10:34.314,000 --> 0:10:37,000
it does things to your brainwave activity. (Laughter)

175
0:10:37.666,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Something similar seems to happen

176
0:10:41.124,000 --> 0:10:46,000
with exaggerated conceptions of how technology

177
0:10:46.434,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is going to overpower in the very immediate run

178
0:10:50.603,000 --> 0:10:53,000
all cultural barriers, all political barriers,

179
0:10:53.936,000 --> 0:10:56,000
all geographic barriers, because at this point

180
0:10:57.529,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I know you aren't allowed to ask me questions,

181
0:11:00.113,000 --> 0:11:02,000
but when I get to this point in my lecture with my students,

182
0:11:03.086,000 --> 0:11:05,000
hands go up, and people ask me,

183
0:11:05.85,000 --> 0:11:08,000
"Yeah, but what about Facebook?"

184
0:11:09.329,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And I got this question often enough that I thought

185
0:11:11.942,000 --> 0:11:13,000
I'd better do some research on Facebook.

186
0:11:14.69,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Because, in some sense, it's the ideal kind of technology

187
0:11:18.41,000 --> 0:11:21,000
to think about. Theoretically, it makes it

188
0:11:22.079,000 --> 0:11:25,000
as easy to form friendships halfway around the world

189
0:11:25.457,000 --> 0:11:28,000
as opposed to right next door.

190
0:11:28.459,000 --> 0:11:34,000
What percentage of people's friends on Facebook

191
0:11:34.545,000 --> 0:11:37,000
are actually located in countries other than where

192
0:11:37.665,000 --> 0:11:4,000
people we're analyzing are based?

193
0:11:40.938,000 --> 0:11:43,000
The answer is probably somewhere between

194
0:11:44.288,000 --> 0:11:46,000
10 to 15 percent.

195
0:11:47.161,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Non-negligible, so we don't live in an entirely local

196
0:11:50.972,000 --> 0:11:55,000
or national world, but very, very far from the 95 percent level

197
0:11:55.979,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that you would expect, and the reason's very simple.

198
0:11:59.385,000 --> 0:12:02,000
We don't, or I hope we don't, form friendships at random

199
0:12:03.377,000 --> 0:12:07,000
on Facebook. The technology is overlaid

200
0:12:08.199,000 --> 0:12:12,000
on a pre-existing matrix of relationships that we have,

201
0:12:12.934,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and those relationships are what the technology

202
0:12:16.002,000 --> 0:12:19,000
doesn't quite displace. Those relationships are why

203
0:12:19.233,000 --> 0:12:23,000
we get far fewer than 95 percent of our friends

204
0:12:23.277,000 --> 0:12:26,000
being located in countries other than where we are.

205
0:12:27.085,000 --> 0:12:32,000
So does all this matter? Or is globaloney

206
0:12:32.566,000 --> 0:12:37,000
just a harmless way of getting people to pay more attention

207
0:12:37.978,000 --> 0:12:39,000
to globalization-related issues?

208
0:12:40.69,000 --> 0:12:42,000
I want to suggest that actually,

209
0:12:42.897,000 --> 0:12:46,000
globaloney can be very harmful to your health.

210
0:12:47.467,000 --> 0:12:5,000
First of all, recognizing that the glass

211
0:12:50.619,000 --> 0:12:54,000
is only 10 to 20 percent full is critical to seeing

212
0:12:55.075,000 --> 0:12:58,000
that there might be potential for additional gains

213
0:12:58.459,000 --> 0:13:,000
from additional integration,

214
0:13:00.49,000 --> 0:13:02,000
whereas if we thought we were already there,

215
0:13:03.334,000 --> 0:13:06,000
there would be no particular point to pushing harder.

216
0:13:06.758,000 --> 0:13:09,000
It's a little bit like, we wouldn't be having a conference

217
0:13:09.97,000 --> 0:13:13,000
on radical openness if we already thought we were totally open

218
0:13:14.151,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to all the kinds of influences that are being talked about

219
0:13:17.483,000 --> 0:13:18,000
at this conference.

220
0:13:18.898,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So being accurate about how limited globalization levels are

221
0:13:23.688,000 --> 0:13:26,000
is critical to even being able to notice

222
0:13:26.747,000 --> 0:13:29,000
that there might be room for something more,

223
0:13:30.426,000 --> 0:13:33,000
something that would contribute further to global welfare.

224
0:13:34.394,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Which brings me to my second point.

225
0:13:37.226,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Avoiding overstatement is also very helpful

226
0:13:41.449,000 --> 0:13:45,000
because it reduces and in some cases even reverses

227
0:13:46.244,000 --> 0:13:5,000
some of the fears that people have about globalization.

228
0:13:51.049,000 --> 0:13:54,000
So I actually spend most of my "World 3.0" book

229
0:13:54.434,000 --> 0:13:58,000
working through a litany of market failures and fears

230
0:13:58.978,000 --> 0:14:03,000
that people have that they worry globalization is going to exacerbate.

231
0:14:04.118,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I'm obviously not going to be able to do that for you today,

232
0:14:07.786,000 --> 0:14:1,000
so let me just present to you two headlines

233
0:14:11.054,000 --> 0:14:14,000
as an illustration of what I have in mind.

234
0:14:14.335,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Think of France and the current debate about immigration.

235
0:14:18.651,000 --> 0:14:21,000
When you ask people in France what percentage

236
0:14:21.883,000 --> 0:14:23,000
of the French population is immigrants,

237
0:14:24.096,000 --> 0:14:28,000
the answer is about 24 percent. That's their guess.

238
0:14:28.596,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Maybe realizing that the number is just eight percent

239
0:14:33.226,000 --> 0:14:37,000
might help cool some of the superheated rhetoric

240
0:14:37.64,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that we see around the immigration issue.

241
0:14:40.978,000 --> 0:14:44,000
Or to take an even more striking example,

242
0:14:45.122,000 --> 0:14:47,000
when the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations

243
0:14:47.299,000 --> 0:14:5,000
did a survey of Americans, asking them to guess

244
0:14:50.646,000 --> 0:14:54,000
what percentage of the federal budget went to foreign aid,

245
0:14:54.873,000 --> 0:14:57,000
the guess was 30 percent, which is

246
0:14:58.554,000 --> 0:15:03,000
slightly in excess of the actual level — ("actually about ... 1%") (Laughter) —

247
0:15:03.914,000 --> 0:15:06,000
of U.S. governmental commitments to federal aid.

248
0:15:07.288,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The reassuring thing about this particular survey was,

249
0:15:10.695,000 --> 0:15:12,000
when it was pointed out to people how far

250
0:15:13.376,000 --> 0:15:16,000
their estimates were from the actual data,

251
0:15:16.585,000 --> 0:15:19,000
some of them — not all of them — seemed to become

252
0:15:19.68,000 --> 0:15:22,000
more willing to consider increases in foreign aid.

253
0:15:23.667,000 --> 0:15:26,000
So foreign aid is actually a great way

254
0:15:26.791,000 --> 0:15:29,000
of sort of wrapping up here, because

255
0:15:29.985,000 --> 0:15:32,000
if you think about it, what I've been talking about today

256
0:15:33.073,000 --> 0:15:37,000
is this notion -- very uncontroversial amongst economists --

257
0:15:37.162,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that most things are very home-biased.

258
0:15:40.144,000 --> 0:15:43,000
"Foreign aid is the most aid to poor people,"

259
0:15:43.369,000 --> 0:15:46,000
is about the most home-biased thing you can find.

260
0:15:47.092,000 --> 0:15:5,000
If you look at the OECD countries and how much

261
0:15:50.13,000 --> 0:15:53,000
they spend per domestic poor person,

262
0:15:53.272,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and compare it with how much they spend

263
0:15:55.524,000 --> 0:15:59,000
per poor person in poor countries,

264
0:15:59.696,000 --> 0:16:03,000
the ratio — Branko Milanovic at the World Bank did the calculations —

265
0:16:03.968,000 --> 0:16:07,000
turns out to be about 30,000 to one.

266
0:16:08.644,000 --> 0:16:14,000
Now of course, some of us, if we truly are cosmopolitan,

267
0:16:14.84,000 --> 0:16:17,000
would like to see that ratio being brought down

268
0:16:18.009,000 --> 0:16:2,000
to one-is-to-one.

269
0:16:20.241,000 --> 0:16:23,000
I'd like to make the suggestion that we don't need to aim

270
0:16:23.632,000 --> 0:16:27,000
for that to make substantial progress from where we are.

271
0:16:27.793,000 --> 0:16:32,000
If we simply brought that ratio down to 15,000 to one,

272
0:16:32.86,000 --> 0:16:35,000
we would be meeting those aid targets that were agreed

273
0:16:36.23,000 --> 0:16:39,000
at the Rio Summit 20 years ago that the summit

274
0:16:39.747,000 --> 0:16:42,000
that ended last week made no further progress on.

275
0:16:43.609,000 --> 0:16:46,000
So in summary, while radical openness is great,

276
0:16:47.414,000 --> 0:16:49,000
given how closed we are,

277
0:16:49.427,000 --> 0:16:51,000
even incremental openness could make things

278
0:16:52.401,000 --> 0:16:55,000
dramatically better. Thank you very much. (Applause)

279
0:16:56.032,000 --> 0:16:58,000
(Applause)

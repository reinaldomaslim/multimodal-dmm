1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I want to talk about the transformed media landscape,

2
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out

3
0:00:24.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
to anywhere in the world.

4
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories

5
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:3,000
about that transformation.

6
0:00:30.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I'll start here. Last November there was a presidential election.

7
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:36,000
You probably read something about it in the papers.

8
0:00:36.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And there was some concern that in some parts of the country

9
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
there might be voter suppression.

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And so a plan came up to video the vote.

11
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And the idea was that individual citizens

12
0:00:46.16,000 --> 0:00:49,000
with phones capable of taking photos or making video

13
0:00:49.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
would document their polling places,

14
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques,

15
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and would upload this to a central place.

16
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation --

17
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes,

18
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall.

19
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So this is a pattern that assumes we're all in this together.

20
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
What matters here

21
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
isn't technical capital,

22
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
it's social capital.

23
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
These tools don't get socially interesting

24
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
until they get technologically boring.

25
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It isn't when the shiny new tools show up

26
0:01:28.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that their uses start permeating society.

27
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It's when everybody is able to take them for granted.

28
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Because now that media is increasingly social,

29
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
innovation can happen anywhere

30
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that people can take for granted the idea that we're all in this together.

31
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And so we're starting to see a media landscape

32
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
in which innovation is happening everywhere,

33
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and moving from one spot to another.

34
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
That is a huge transformation.

35
0:01:56.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Not to put too fine a point on it, the moment we're living through --

36
0:01:59.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
the moment our historical generation is living through --

37
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
is the largest increase in expressive capability

38
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
in human history.

39
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Now that's a big claim. I'm going to try to back it up.

40
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
There are only four periods in the last 500 years

41
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
where media has changed enough to qualify for the label "revolution."

42
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The first one is the famous one, the printing press:

43
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
movable type, oil-based inks, that whole complex of innovations

44
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
that made printing possible

45
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and turned Europe upside-down, starting in the middle of the 1400s.

46
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Then, a couple of hundred years ago,

47
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
there was innovation in two-way communication,

48
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
conversational media: first the telegraph, then the telephone.

49
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Slow, text-based conversations,

50
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
then real-time voice based conversations.

51
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Then, about 150 years ago,

52
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
there was a revolution in recorded media other than print:

53
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
first photos, then recorded sound,

54
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
then movies, all encoded onto physical objects.

55
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And finally, about 100 years ago, the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum

56
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television.

57
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
This is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century.

58
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
This is what those of us of a certain age

59
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
grew up with, and are used to.

60
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But there is a curious asymmetry here.

61
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
The media that is good at creating conversations

62
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
is no good at creating groups.

63
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And the media that's good at creating groups

64
0:03:17.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
is no good at creating conversations.

65
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:21,000
If you want to have a conversation

66
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
in this world, you have it with one other person.

67
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
If you want to address a group, you get the same message

68
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and you give it to everybody in the group,

69
0:03:28.16,000 --> 0:03:32,000
whether you're doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press.

70
0:03:32.16,000 --> 0:03:34,000
That was the media landscape

71
0:03:34.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
as we had it in the twentieth century.

72
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And this is what changed.

73
0:03:38.16,000 --> 0:03:4,000
This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen

74
0:03:40.16,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is Bill Cheswick's map of the Internet.

75
0:03:42.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
He traces the edges of the individual networks

76
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and then color codes them.

77
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
The Internet is the first medium in history

78
0:03:48.16,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that has native support for groups

79
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and conversation at the same time.

80
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern,

81
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and television, radio, magazines, books,

82
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
gave us the one-to-many pattern,

83
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
the Internet gives us the many-to-many pattern.

84
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:04,000
For the first time,

85
0:04:04.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations.

86
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:11,000
That's one of the big changes.

87
0:04:11.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The second big change

88
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
is that, as all media gets digitized,

89
0:04:15.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage

90
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
for all other media,

91
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet,

92
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:25,000
magazines migrate to the Internet, movies migrate to the Internet.

93
0:04:25.16,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And that means that every medium

94
0:04:27.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
is right next door to every other medium.

95
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Put another way,

96
0:04:35.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
media is increasingly less just a source of information,

97
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and it is increasingly more a site of coordination,

98
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something

99
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:48,000
can now gather around and talk to each other as well.

100
0:04:48.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And the third big change

101
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
is that members of the former audience, as Dan Gilmore calls them,

102
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:57,000
can now also be producers and not consumers.

103
0:04:57.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Every time a new consumer

104
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:01,000
joins this media landscape

105
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
a new producer joins as well,

106
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
because the same equipment --

107
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
phones, computers --

108
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:09,000
let you consume and produce.

109
0:05:09.16,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It's as if, when you bought a book, they threw in the printing press for free;

110
0:05:12.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
it's like you had a phone that could turn into a radio

111
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
if you pressed the right buttons.

112
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:19,000
That is a huge change

113
0:05:19.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
in the media landscape we're used to.

114
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And it's not just Internet or no Internet.

115
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:26,000
We've had the Internet in its public form

116
0:05:26.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
for almost 20 years now,

117
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and it's still changing

118
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
as the media becomes more social.

119
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It's still changing patterns

120
0:05:34.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well.

121
0:05:37.16,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Second story.

122
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Last May, China in the Sichuan province

123
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
had a terrible earthquake, 7.9 magnitude,

124
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
massive destruction in a wide area, as the Richter Scale has it.

125
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And the earthquake was reported as it was happening.

126
0:05:54.16,000 --> 0:05:57,000
People were texting from their phones. They were taking photos of buildings.

127
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
They were taking videos of buildings shaking.

128
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
They were uploading it to QQ, China's largest Internet service.

129
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:05,000
They were Twittering it.

130
0:06:05.16,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And so as the quake was happening

131
0:06:08.16,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the news was reported.

132
0:06:10.16,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And because of the social connections,

133
0:06:12.16,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Chinese students coming elsewhere, and going to school,

134
0:06:15.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China --

135
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:23,000
there were people listening all over the world, hearing this news.

136
0:06:23.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter.

137
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Twitter announced the existence of the quake

138
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
several minutes before the US Geological Survey

139
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:37,000
had anything up online for anybody to read.

140
0:06:37.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The last time China had a quake of that magnitude

141
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
it took them three months to admit that it had happened.

142
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Now they might have liked to have done that here,

144
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
rather than seeing these pictures go up online.

145
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But they weren't given that choice,

146
0:06:54.16,000 --> 0:06:57,000
because their own citizens beat them to the punch.

147
0:06:57.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens,

148
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
rather than from the Xinhua News Agency.

149
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
And this stuff rippled like wildfire.

150
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
For a while there

151
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the top 10 most clicked links on Twitter,

152
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
the global short messaging service --

153
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
nine of the top 10 links were about the quake.

154
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:17,000
People collating information,

155
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:19,000
pointing people to news sources,

156
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
pointing people to the US geological survey.

157
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The 10th one was kittens on a treadmill, but that's the Internet for you.

158
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:26,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:29,000
But nine of the 10 in those first hours.

160
0:07:29.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And within half a day donation sites were up,

161
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and donations were pouring in from all around the world.

162
0:07:37.16,000 --> 0:07:41,000
This was an incredible, coordinated global response.

163
0:07:41.16,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And the Chinese then, in one of their periods of media openness,

164
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:45,000
decided that they were going to let it go,

165
0:07:45.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly.

166
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And then this happened.

167
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
People began to figure out, in the Sichuan Provence,

168
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed --

169
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day --

170
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
the reason so many school buildings collapsed

171
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:05,000
is that corrupt officials had taken bribes

172
0:08:05.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
to allow those building to be built to less than code.

173
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And so they started, the citizen journalists started

174
0:08:12.16,000 --> 0:08:15,000
reporting that as well. And there was an incredible picture.

175
0:08:15.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
You may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times.

176
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:21,000
A local official literally prostrated himself in the street,

177
0:08:21.16,000 --> 0:08:23,000
in front of these protesters,

178
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:26,000
in order to get them to go away.

179
0:08:26.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Essentially to say, "We will do anything to placate you,

180
0:08:28.16,000 --> 0:08:31,000
just please stop protesting in public."

181
0:08:31.16,000 --> 0:08:33,000
But these are people who have been radicalized,

182
0:08:33.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
because, thanks to the one child policy,

183
0:08:35.16,000 --> 0:08:38,000
they have lost everyone in their next generation.

184
0:08:38.16,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Someone who has seen the death of a single child

185
0:08:40.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
now has nothing to lose.

186
0:08:42.16,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And so the protest kept going.

187
0:08:44.16,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And finally the Chinese cracked down.

188
0:08:47.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
That was enough of citizen media.

189
0:08:50.16,000 --> 0:08:52,000
And so they began to arrest the protesters.

190
0:08:52.16,000 --> 0:08:56,000
They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on.

191
0:08:56.16,000 --> 0:09:,000
China is probably the most successful

192
0:09:00.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
manager of Internet censorship in the world,

193
0:09:03.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
using something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China.

194
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And the Great Firewall of China

195
0:09:09.16,000 --> 0:09:11,000
is a set of observation points

196
0:09:11.16,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that assume that media is produced by professionals,

197
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:18,000
it mostly comes in from the outside world,

198
0:09:18.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
it comes in relatively sparse chunks,

199
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and it comes in relatively slowly.

200
0:09:24.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And because of those four characteristics

201
0:09:26.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
they are able to filter it as it comes into the country.

202
0:09:30.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
But like the Maginot Line,

203
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction

204
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
for this challenge,

205
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
because not one of those four things was true in this environment.

206
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:45,000
The media was produced locally. It was produced by amateurs.

207
0:09:45.16,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It was produced quickly. And it was produced at such an incredible abundance

208
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that there was no way to filter it as it appeared.

209
0:09:54.16,000 --> 0:09:57,000
And so now the Chinese government, who for a dozen years,

210
0:09:57.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
has quite successfully filtered the web,

211
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
is now in the position of having to decide

212
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
whether to allow or shut down entire services,

213
0:10:07.16,000 --> 0:10:1,000
because the transformation to amateur media

214
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
is so enormous that they can't deal with it any other way.

215
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And in fact that is happening this week.

216
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:18,000
On the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen

217
0:10:18.16,000 --> 0:10:21,000
they just, two days ago, announced

218
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:24,000
that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter,

219
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:28,000
because there was no way to filter it other than that.

220
0:10:28.16,000 --> 0:10:32,000
They had to turn the spigot entirely off.

221
0:10:32.16,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Now these changes don't just affect people who want to censor messages.

222
0:10:36.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
They also affect people who want to send messages,

223
0:10:39.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole,

224
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
not just a particular strategy.

225
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The classic media problem, from the 20th century

226
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
is, how does an organization have a message

227
0:10:50.16,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that they want to get out

228
0:10:52.16,000 --> 0:10:54,000
to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network.

229
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And here is the twentieth century answer.

230
0:10:57.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Bundle up the message. Send the same message to everybody.

231
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
National message. Targeted individuals.

232
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Relatively sparse number of producers.

233
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Very expensive to do,

234
0:11:07.16,000 --> 0:11:09,000
so there is not a lot of competition.

235
0:11:09.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
This is how you reach people.

236
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:14,000
All of that is over.

237
0:11:14.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global,

238
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
social, ubiquitous and cheap.

239
0:11:20.16,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Now most organizations that are trying to send messages

240
0:11:25.16,000 --> 0:11:29,000
to the outside world, to the distributed collection of the audience,

241
0:11:29.16,000 --> 0:11:31,000
are now used to this change.

242
0:11:31.16,000 --> 0:11:33,000
The audience can talk back.

243
0:11:33.16,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And that's a little freaky. But you can get used to it after a while, as people do.

244
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:42,000
But that's not the really crazy change that we're living in the middle of.

245
0:11:42.16,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The really crazy change is here:

246
0:11:45.16,000 --> 0:11:49,000
it's the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other,

247
0:11:49.16,000 --> 0:11:52,000
the fact that former consumers are now producers,

248
0:11:52.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another;

249
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals,

250
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and because the size of the network,

251
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:04,000
the complexity of the network is actually the square

252
0:12:04.16,000 --> 0:12:06,000
of the number of participants,

253
0:12:06.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
meaning that the network, when it grows large,

254
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
grows very, very large.

255
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
As recently at last decade,

256
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
most of the media that was available for public consumption

257
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:17,000
was produced by professionals.

258
0:12:17.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Those days are over, never to return.

259
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It is the green lines now, that are the source of the free content,

260
0:12:24.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
which brings me to my last story.

261
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:29,000
We saw some of the most imaginative use

262
0:12:29.16,000 --> 0:12:32,000
of social media during the Obama campaign.

263
0:12:32.16,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And I don't mean most imaginative use in politics --

264
0:12:34.16,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I mean most imaginative use ever.

265
0:12:37.16,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And one of the things Obama did, was they famously,

266
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
the Obama campaign did, was they famously put up

267
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
MyBarackObama.com, myBO.com

268
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And millions of citizens rushed in to participate,

269
0:12:47.16,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and to try and figure out how to help.

270
0:12:49.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
An incredible conversation sprung up there.

271
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And then, this time last year,

272
0:12:55.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA,

273
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.

274
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:02,000
He had said, in January, that he would not sign a bill

275
0:13:02.16,000 --> 0:13:06,000
that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying

276
0:13:06.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
on American persons.

277
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
By the summer, in the middle of the general campaign,

278
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
He said, "I've thought about the issue more. I've changed my mind.

279
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
I'm going to vote for this bill."

280
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
And many of his own supporters

281
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
on his own site went very publicly berserk.

282
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
It was Senator Obama when they created it. They changed the name later.

283
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
"Please get FISA right."

284
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Within days of this group being created

285
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:32,000
it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com;

286
0:13:32.16,000 --> 0:13:35,000
within weeks of its being created it was the largest group.

287
0:13:35.16,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Obama had to issue a press release.

288
0:13:38.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
He had to issue a reply.

289
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
And he said essentially, "I have considered the issue.

290
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
I understand where you are coming from.

291
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:49,000
But having considered it all, I'm still going to vote the way I'm going to vote.

292
0:13:49.16,000 --> 0:13:52,000
But I wanted to reach out to you and say, I understand that you disagree with me,

293
0:13:52.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and I'm going to take my lumps on this one."

294
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
This didn't please anybody. But then a funny thing happened in the conversation.

295
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:01,000
People in that group realized

296
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
that Obama had never shut them down.

297
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group

298
0:14:09.16,000 --> 0:14:11,000
or make it harder to join,

299
0:14:11.16,000 --> 0:14:13,000
to deny its existence, to delete it,

300
0:14:13.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
to take to off the site.

301
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:19,000
They had understood that their role

302
0:14:19.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
with myBO.com was to convene their supporters

303
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:25,000
but not to control their supporters.

304
0:14:25.16,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And that is the kind of discipline

305
0:14:27.16,000 --> 0:14:31,000
that it takes to make really mature use

306
0:14:31.16,000 --> 0:14:34,000
of this media.

307
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:38,000
Media, the media landscape that we knew,

308
0:14:38.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
as familiar as it was, as easy conceptually as it was

309
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:43,000
to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast

310
0:14:43.16,000 --> 0:14:45,000
messages to amateurs,

311
0:14:45.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
is increasingly slipping away.

312
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:52,000
In a world where media is global, social, ubiquitous and cheap,

313
0:14:52.16,000 --> 0:14:54,000
in a world of media where the former audience

314
0:14:54.16,000 --> 0:14:58,000
are now increasingly full participants,

315
0:14:58.16,000 --> 0:15:02,000
in that world, media is less and less often

316
0:15:02.16,000 --> 0:15:05,000
about crafting a single message

317
0:15:05.16,000 --> 0:15:08,000
to be consumed by individuals.

318
0:15:08.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
It is more and more often

319
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:13,000
a way of creating an environment for convening

320
0:15:13.16,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and supporting groups.

321
0:15:15.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
And the choice we face,

322
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard

323
0:15:19.16,000 --> 0:15:22,000
anywhere in the world,

324
0:15:22.16,000 --> 0:15:25,000
isn't whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in.

325
0:15:25.16,000 --> 0:15:27,000
That's the media environment we've got.

326
0:15:27.16,000 --> 0:15:29,000
The question we all face now is,

327
0:15:29.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
"How can we make best use of this media?

328
0:15:31.16,000 --> 0:15:35,000
Even though it means changing the way we've always done it."

329
0:15:35.16,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Thank you very much.

330
0:15:37.16,000 --> 0:15:43,000

1
0:00:12.494,000 --> 0:00:13,000
So, let me add to the complexity

2
0:00:14.5,000 --> 0:00:16,000
of the situation we find ourselves in.

3
0:00:17.09,000 --> 0:00:21,000
At the same time that we're solving for climate change,

4
0:00:21.44,000 --> 0:00:24,000
we're going to be building cities for three billion people.

5
0:00:26.397,000 --> 0:00:28,000
That's a doubling of the urban environment.

6
0:00:29.727,000 --> 0:00:3,000
If we don't get that right,

7
0:00:31.424,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I'm not sure all the climate solutions in the world will save mankind,

8
0:00:36.627,000 --> 0:00:39,000
because so much depends on how we shape our cities:

9
0:00:40.426,000 --> 0:00:42,000
not just environmental impacts,

10
0:00:42.68,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but our social well-being,

11
0:00:44.34,000 --> 0:00:46,000
our economic vitality,

12
0:00:46.646,000 --> 0:00:48,000
our sense of community and connectedness.

13
0:00:49.974,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Fundamentally, the way we shape cities is a manifestation

14
0:00:53.169,000 --> 0:00:55,000
of the kind of humanity we bring to bear.

15
0:00:55.852,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And so getting it right is, I think,

16
0:00:58.986,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the order of the day.

17
0:01:00.656,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And to a certain degree, getting it right can help us solve climate change,

18
0:01:04.308,000 --> 0:01:05,000
because in the end,

19
0:01:05.484,000 --> 0:01:08,000
it's our behavior that seems to be driving the problem.

20
0:01:08.936,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The problem isn't free-floating,

21
0:01:10.838,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and it isn't just ExxonMobil and oil companies.

22
0:01:14.768,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It's us; how we live.

23
0:01:18.161,000 --> 0:01:19,000
How we live.

24
0:01:19.864,000 --> 0:01:2,000
There's a villain in this story.

25
0:01:21.453,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It's called sprawl, and I'll be upfront about that.

26
0:01:24.99,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But it's not just the kind of sprawl you think of, or many people think of,

27
0:01:28.799,000 --> 0:01:29,000
as low-density development

28
0:01:30.453,000 --> 0:01:32,000
out at the periphery of the metropolitan area.

29
0:01:33.952,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Actually, I think sprawl can happen anywhere, at any density.

30
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The key attribute is that it isolates people.

31
0:01:42.874,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It segregates people into economic enclaves

32
0:01:46.788,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and land-use enclaves.

33
0:01:48.404,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It separates them from nature.

34
0:01:50.524,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It doesn't allow the cross-fertilization,

35
0:01:53.702,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the interaction,

36
0:01:54.99,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that make cities great places

37
0:01:57.437,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and that make society thrive.

38
0:02:00.209,000 --> 0:02:04,000
So the antidote to sprawl is really what we all need to be thinking about,

39
0:02:04.975,000 --> 0:02:08,000
especially when we're taking on this massive construction project.

40
0:02:09.925,000 --> 0:02:11,000
So let me take you through one exercise.

41
0:02:12.434,000 --> 0:02:15,000
We developed the model for the state of California

42
0:02:16.224,000 --> 0:02:19,000
so they could get on with reducing carbon emissions.

43
0:02:19.866,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We did a whole series of scenarios for how the state could grow,

44
0:02:25.386,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and this is just one overly simplified one.

45
0:02:28.533,000 --> 0:02:3,000
We mixed different development prototypes

46
0:02:31.353,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and said they're going to carry us through the year 2050,

47
0:02:35.188,000 --> 0:02:39,000
10 million new crew in our state of California.

48
0:02:40.511,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And one was sprawl.

49
0:02:41.787,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's just more of the same: shopping malls, subdivisions,

50
0:02:45.343,000 --> 0:02:46,000
office parks.

51
0:02:46.551,000 --> 0:02:49,000
The other one was dominated by, not everybody moving to the city,

52
0:02:50.365,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but just compact development,

53
0:02:52.072,000 --> 0:02:54,000
what we used to think of as streetcar suburbs,

54
0:02:54.654,000 --> 0:02:55,000
walkable neighborhoods,

55
0:02:55.917,000 --> 0:02:59,000
low-rise, but integrated, mixed-used environments.

56
0:03:00.789,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And the results are astounding.

57
0:03:03.249,000 --> 0:03:06,000
They're astounding not just for the scale of the difference

58
0:03:06.436,000 --> 0:03:1,000
of this one shift in our city-making habit

59
0:03:10.695,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but also because each one represents a special interest group,

60
0:03:16.053,000 --> 0:03:2,000
a special interest group that used to advocate for their concerns

61
0:03:20.466,000 --> 0:03:21,000
one at a time.

62
0:03:21.655,000 --> 0:03:26,000
They did not see the, what I call, "co-benefits" of urban form

63
0:03:26.778,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that allows them to join with others.

64
0:03:29.277,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So, land consumption:

65
0:03:30.889,000 --> 0:03:32,000
environmentalists are really concerned about this,

66
0:03:33.727,000 --> 0:03:34,000
so are farmers;

67
0:03:35.516,000 --> 0:03:37,000
there's a whole range of people,

68
0:03:37.762,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and, of course, neighborhood groups that want open space nearby.

69
0:03:41.681,000 --> 0:03:43,000
The sprawl version of California

70
0:03:43.791,000 --> 0:03:46,000
almost doubles the urban physical footprint.

71
0:03:48.249,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Greenhouse gas: tremendous savings,

72
0:03:50.948,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because in California, our biggest carbon emission comes from cars,

73
0:03:55.787,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and cities that don't depend on cars as much

74
0:03:59.511,000 --> 0:04:02,000
obviously create huge savings.

75
0:04:03.421,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Vehicle miles traveled: that's what I was just talking about.

76
0:04:06.521,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Just reducing the average 10,000 miles per household per year,

77
0:04:11.53,000 --> 0:04:16,000
from somewhere in the mid-26,000 per household,

78
0:04:16.884,000 --> 0:04:2,000
has a huge impact not just on air quality and carbon

79
0:04:21.788,000 --> 0:04:23,000
but also on the household pocketbook.

80
0:04:24.383,000 --> 0:04:26,000
It's very expensive to drive that much,

81
0:04:27.4,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and as we've seen,

82
0:04:28.816,000 --> 0:04:3,000
the middle class is struggling to hold on.

83
0:04:32.133,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Health care: we were talking about how do you fix it once we broke it --

84
0:04:36.142,000 --> 0:04:37,000
clean the air.

85
0:04:37.325,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Why not just stop polluting?

86
0:04:39.34,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Why not just use our feet and bikes more?

87
0:04:42.792,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And that's a function of the kinds of cities that we shape.

88
0:04:47.134,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Household costs:

89
0:04:49.063,000 --> 0:04:51,000
2008 was a mark in time,

90
0:04:51.385,000 --> 0:04:54,000
not of just the financial industry running amok.

91
0:04:55.463,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It was that we were trying to sell too many of the wrong kind of housing:

92
0:05:00.146,000 --> 0:05:02,000
large lot, single family, distant,

93
0:05:03.121,000 --> 0:05:07,000
too expensive for the average middle-class family to afford

94
0:05:07.346,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and, quite frankly, not a good fit to their lifestyle anymore.

95
0:05:10.972,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But in order to move inventory,

96
0:05:13.286,000 --> 0:05:16,000
you can discount the financing and get it sold.

97
0:05:16.516,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I think that's a lot of what happened.

98
0:05:18.388,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Reducing cost by 10,000 dollars --

99
0:05:21.078,000 --> 0:05:23,000
remember, in California the median is 50,000 --

100
0:05:23.939,000 --> 0:05:24,000
this is a big element.

101
0:05:25.844,000 --> 0:05:27,000
That's just cars and utility costs.

102
0:05:28.497,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So the affordable housing advocates, who often sit off in their silos

103
0:05:32.721,000 --> 0:05:36,000
separate from the environmentalists, separate from the politicians,

104
0:05:37.209,000 --> 0:05:38,000
everybody fighting with everyone,

105
0:05:39.211,000 --> 0:05:4,000
now begin to see common cause,

106
0:05:41.153,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and I think the common cause is what really brings about the change.

107
0:05:45.657,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Los Angeles, as a result of these efforts,

108
0:05:48.561,000 --> 0:05:51,000
has now decided to transform itself

109
0:05:51.609,000 --> 0:05:54,000
into a more transit-oriented environment.

110
0:05:55.005,000 --> 0:05:56,000
As a matter of fact, since '08,

111
0:05:56.763,000 --> 0:05:59,000
they've voted in 400 billion dollars of bonds for transit

112
0:06:00.736,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and zero dollars for new highways.

113
0:06:03.609,000 --> 0:06:04,000
What a transformation:

114
0:06:04.801,000 --> 0:06:07,000
LA becomes a city of walkers and transit,

115
0:06:08.156,000 --> 0:06:09,000
not a city of cars.

116
0:06:09.359,000 --> 0:06:1,000
(Applause)

117
0:06:10.39,000 --> 0:06:11,000
How does it happen?

118
0:06:11.614,000 --> 0:06:13,000
You take the least desirable land, the strip,

119
0:06:13.775,000 --> 0:06:15,000
you add where there's space, transit

120
0:06:15.846,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and then you infill mixed-use development,

121
0:06:20.133,000 --> 0:06:22,000
you satisfy new housing demands

122
0:06:22.34,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and you make the existing neighborhoods

123
0:06:24.355,000 --> 0:06:25,000
all around it more complex,

124
0:06:25.844,000 --> 0:06:26,000
more interesting, more walkable.

125
0:06:28.66,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Here's another kind of sprawl:

126
0:06:31.607,000 --> 0:06:34,000
China, high-density sprawl, what you think of as an oxymoron,

127
0:06:35.139,000 --> 0:06:38,000
but the same problems, everything isolated in superblocks,

128
0:06:38.597,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and of course this amazing smog that was just spoken to.

129
0:06:42.149,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Twelve percent of GDP in China now is spent

130
0:06:45.402,000 --> 0:06:47,000
on the health impacts of that.

131
0:06:47.623,000 --> 0:06:5,000
The history, of course, of Chinese cities is robust.

132
0:06:50.912,000 --> 0:06:51,000
It's like any other place.

133
0:06:52.188,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Community was all about small, local shops

134
0:06:55.224,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and local services and walking, interacting with your neighbors.

135
0:06:59.391,000 --> 0:07:01,000
It may sound utopian, but it's not.

136
0:07:01.539,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It's actually what people really want.

137
0:07:03.53,000 --> 0:07:04,000
The new superblocks --

138
0:07:05.101,000 --> 0:07:08,000
these are blocks that would have 5,000 units in them,

139
0:07:09.045,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and they're gated as well, because nobody knows anybody else.

140
0:07:12.881,000 --> 0:07:15,000
And of course, there isn't even a sidewalk, no ground floor shops --

141
0:07:16.405,000 --> 0:07:17,000
a very sterile environment.

142
0:07:18.838,000 --> 0:07:22,000
I found this one case here in one of the superblocks

143
0:07:23.478,000 --> 0:07:26,000
where people had illicitly set up shops in their garages

144
0:07:26.728,000 --> 0:07:29,000
so that they could have that kind of local service economy.

145
0:07:30.45,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The desire of people to get it right is there.

146
0:07:35.231,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We just have to get the planners on board and the politicians.

147
0:07:38.982,000 --> 0:07:41,000
All right. Some technical planning stuff.

148
0:07:42.813,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Chongqing is a city of 30 million people.

149
0:07:46.01,000 --> 0:07:48,000
It's almost as big as California.

150
0:07:48.397,000 --> 0:07:49,000
This is a small growth area.

151
0:07:50.111,000 --> 0:07:53,000
They wanted us to test the alternative to sprawl

152
0:07:53.747,000 --> 0:07:55,000
in several cities across China.

153
0:07:56.892,000 --> 0:07:59,000
This is for four-and-a-half million people.

154
0:08:00.198,000 --> 0:08:01,000
What the takeaway from this image is,

155
0:08:02.153,000 --> 0:08:04,000
every one of those circles is a walking radius

156
0:08:04.826,000 --> 0:08:05,000
around a transit station --

157
0:08:07.1,000 --> 0:08:09,000
massive investment in metro and BRT,

158
0:08:10.764,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and a distribution that allows everybody

159
0:08:13.12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
to work within walking distance of that.

160
0:08:15.755,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The red area, this is a blow-up.

161
0:08:18.076,000 --> 0:08:21,000
All of a sudden, our principles called for green space

162
0:08:21.257,000 --> 0:08:24,000
preserving the important ecological features.

163
0:08:24.971,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And then those other streets in there are auto-free streets.

164
0:08:29.322,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So instead of bulldozing, leveling the site

165
0:08:32.969,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and building right up to the river,

166
0:08:35.056,000 --> 0:08:39,000
this green edge was something that really wasn't normative in China

167
0:08:39.304,000 --> 0:08:41,000
until these set of practices

168
0:08:41.899,000 --> 0:08:43,000
began experimentation there.

169
0:08:44.883,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The urban fabric, small blocks,

170
0:08:46.862,000 --> 0:08:48,000
maybe 500 families per block.

171
0:08:49.502,000 --> 0:08:5,000
They know each other.

172
0:08:50.795,000 --> 0:08:52,000
The street perimeter has shops

173
0:08:53.182,000 --> 0:08:54,000
so there's local destinations.

174
0:08:55.128,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And the streets themselves become smaller,

175
0:08:57.507,000 --> 0:08:58,000
because there are more of them.

176
0:08:59.061,000 --> 0:09:,000
Very simple,

177
0:09:00.636,000 --> 0:09:02,000
straightforward urban design.

178
0:09:03.215,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Now, here you have something I dearly love.

179
0:09:06.449,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Think of the logic.

180
0:09:08.172,000 --> 0:09:1,000
If only a third of the people have cars,

181
0:09:10.343,000 --> 0:09:13,000
why do we give 100 percent of our streets to cars?

182
0:09:14.748,000 --> 0:09:17,000
What if we gave 70 percent of the streets

183
0:09:17.951,000 --> 0:09:19,000
to car-free, to everybody else,

184
0:09:20.15,000 --> 0:09:22,000
so that the transit could move well for them,

185
0:09:22.419,000 --> 0:09:24,000
so that they could walk, so they could bike?

186
0:09:24.768,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Why not have --

187
0:09:26.19,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Applause)

188
0:09:27.667,000 --> 0:09:29,000
geographic equity

189
0:09:29.844,000 --> 0:09:31,000
in our circulation system?

190
0:09:32.518,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And quite frankly, cities would function better.

191
0:09:36.3,000 --> 0:09:37,000
No matter what they do,

192
0:09:37.614,000 --> 0:09:39,000
no matter how many ring roads they build in Beijing,

193
0:09:40.068,000 --> 0:09:42,000
they just can't overcome complete gridlock.

194
0:09:43.02,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So this is an auto-free street, mixed use along the edge.

195
0:09:47.486,000 --> 0:09:48,000
It has transit running down the middle.

196
0:09:49.369,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I'm happy to make that transit autonomous vehicles,

197
0:09:52.497,000 --> 0:09:54,000
but maybe I'll have a chance to talk about that later.

198
0:09:55.431,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So there are seven principles that have now been adopted

199
0:09:59.178,000 --> 0:10:01,000
by the highest levels in the Chinese government,

200
0:10:01.902,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and they're moving to implement them.

201
0:10:03.721,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And they're simple,

202
0:10:04.907,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and they are globally, I think, universal principles.

203
0:10:07.544,000 --> 0:10:1,000
One is to preserve the natural environment, the history

204
0:10:11.221,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and the critical agriculture.

205
0:10:14.126,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Second is mix.

206
0:10:15.473,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Mixed use is popular, but when I say mixed,

207
0:10:18.014,000 --> 0:10:2,000
I mean mixed incomes, mixed age groups

208
0:10:20.477,000 --> 0:10:22,000
as well as mixed-land use.

209
0:10:24.01,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Walk.

210
0:10:25.188,000 --> 0:10:28,000
There's no great city that you don't enjoy walking in.

211
0:10:28.232,000 --> 0:10:29,000
You don't go there.

212
0:10:29.574,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The places you go on vacation are places you can walk.

213
0:10:32.15,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Why not make it everywhere?

214
0:10:34.381,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Bike is the most efficient means of transportation we know.

215
0:10:38.326,000 --> 0:10:41,000
China has now adopted policies that put six meters of bike lane

216
0:10:42.098,000 --> 0:10:43,000
on every street.

217
0:10:43.451,000 --> 0:10:46,000
They're serious about getting back to their biking history.

218
0:10:47.417,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Applause)

219
0:10:48.897,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Complicated planner-ese here:

220
0:10:51.224,000 --> 0:10:52,000
connect.

221
0:10:52.577,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It's a street network that allows many routes

222
0:10:56.113,000 --> 0:10:57,000
instead of singular routes

223
0:10:57.948,000 --> 0:11:,000
and provides many kinds of streets instead of just one.

224
0:11:02.572,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Ride.

225
0:11:03.94,000 --> 0:11:05,000
We have to invest more in transit.

226
0:11:06.274,000 --> 0:11:07,000
There's no silver bullet.

227
0:11:08.073,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Autonomous vehicles are not going to solve this for us.

228
0:11:11.161,000 --> 0:11:16,000
As a matter of fact, they're going to generate more traffic, more VMT,

229
0:11:16.351,000 --> 0:11:17,000
than the alternative.

230
0:11:17.737,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And focus.

231
0:11:18.975,000 --> 0:11:22,000
We have a hierarchy of the city based on transit

232
0:11:23.155,000 --> 0:11:26,000
rather than the old armature of freeways.

233
0:11:26.342,000 --> 0:11:28,000
It's a big paradigm shift,

234
0:11:29.065,000 --> 0:11:31,000
but those two things have to get reconnected

235
0:11:31.756,000 --> 0:11:35,000
in ways that really shape the structure of the city.

236
0:11:37.263,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So I'm very hopeful.

237
0:11:39.52,000 --> 0:11:43,000
In California, the United States, China -- these changes are well accepted.

238
0:11:44.317,000 --> 0:11:46,000
I'm hopeful for two reasons.

239
0:11:46.976,000 --> 0:11:48,000
One is, most people get it.

240
0:11:49.079,000 --> 0:11:5,000
They understand intrinsically

241
0:11:50.985,000 --> 0:11:52,000
what a great city can and should be.

242
0:11:53.651,000 --> 0:11:57,000
The second is that the kind of analysis we can bring to bear now

243
0:11:58.516,000 --> 0:12:,000
allows people to connect the dots,

244
0:12:01.756,000 --> 0:12:03,000
allows people to shape political coalitions

245
0:12:04.749,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that didn't exist in the past.

246
0:12:06.539,000 --> 0:12:09,000
That allows them to bring into being the kinds of communities we all need.

247
0:12:10.303,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Thank you.

248
0:12:11.516,000 --> 0:12:17,000
(Applause)

249
0:12:19.838,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Chris Anderson: So, OK: autonomous driving, self-driving cars.

250
0:12:23.299,000 --> 0:12:26,000
A lot of people here are very excited about them.

251
0:12:27.263,000 --> 0:12:29,000
What are your concerns or issues about them?

252
0:12:30.246,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Peter Calthorpe: Well, I think there's almost too much hype here.

253
0:12:33.412,000 --> 0:12:36,000
First is, everybody says we're going to get rid of a lot of cars.

254
0:12:37.01,000 --> 0:12:4,000
What they don't say is you're going to get a lot more vehicle miles.

255
0:12:40.328,000 --> 0:12:42,000
You're going to get a lot more cars moving on streets.

256
0:12:42.899,000 --> 0:12:43,000
There will be more congestion.

257
0:12:44.792,000 --> 0:12:46,000
CA: Because they're so appealing --

258
0:12:47.124,000 --> 0:12:49,000
you can drive while reading or sleeping.

259
0:12:49.202,000 --> 0:12:5,000
PC: Well, a couple of reasons.

260
0:12:50.723,000 --> 0:12:53,000
One is, if they're privately owned, people will travel greater distances.

261
0:12:54.718,000 --> 0:12:55,000
It'll be a new lease on life to sprawl.

262
0:12:56.683,000 --> 0:12:58,000
If you can work on your way to work,

263
0:12:58.722,000 --> 0:13:,000
you can live in more remote locations.

264
0:13:00.813,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It'll revitalize sprawl

265
0:13:03.379,000 --> 0:13:05,000
in a way that I'm deeply frightened.

266
0:13:05.736,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Taxis:

267
0:13:07.614,000 --> 0:13:1,000
about 50 percent of the surveys say that people won't share them.

268
0:13:11.386,000 --> 0:13:12,000
If they don't share them,

269
0:13:12.784,000 --> 0:13:17,000
you can end up with a 90 percent increase in vehicle miles traveled.

270
0:13:18.417,000 --> 0:13:19,000
If you share them,

271
0:13:19.762,000 --> 0:13:22,000
you're still at around a 30 percent increase in VMT.

272
0:13:23.316,000 --> 0:13:26,000
CA: Sharing them, meaning having multiple people riding at once

273
0:13:26.378,000 --> 0:13:27,000
in some sort of intelligent ride-sharing?

274
0:13:28.378,000 --> 0:13:3,000
PC: Yeah, so the Uber share without a steering wheel.

275
0:13:30.933,000 --> 0:13:33,000
The reality is, the efficiency of vehicles -- you can do it

276
0:13:34.806,000 --> 0:13:36,000
with or without a steering wheel, it doesn't matter.

277
0:13:37.321,000 --> 0:13:4,000
They claim they're the only ones that are going to be efficient electric,

278
0:13:40.838,000 --> 0:13:41,000
but that's not true.

279
0:13:42.016,000 --> 0:13:45,000
But the real bottom line is that walking, biking and transit

280
0:13:45.61,000 --> 0:13:48,000
are the way cities and communities thrive.

281
0:13:48.798,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And putting people in their private bubbles,

282
0:13:51.629,000 --> 0:13:53,000
whether they have a steering wheel or not,

283
0:13:53.95,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is the wrong direction.

284
0:13:55.545,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And quite frankly,

285
0:13:56.72,000 --> 0:14:01,000
the image of an AV on its way to McDonald's to pick up a pack

286
0:14:02.423,000 --> 0:14:03,000
without its owner,

287
0:14:04.131,000 --> 0:14:07,000
just being sent off on these kind of random errands

288
0:14:07.865,000 --> 0:14:08,000
is really frightening to me.

289
0:14:09.286,000 --> 0:14:12,000
CA: Well, thank you for that, and I have to say, the images you showed

290
0:14:12.668,000 --> 0:14:15,000
of those mixed-use streets were really inspiring, really beautiful.

291
0:14:15.868,000 --> 0:14:17,000
PC: Thank you. CA: Thank you for your work.

292
0:14:18.051,000 --> 0:14:19,000
(Applause)

0:00:00.141,000 --> 0:00:01,000
Applying for jobs online

2
0:00:01.581,000 --> 0:00:03,000
is one of the worst digital experiences of our time.

3
0:00:04.221,000 --> 0:00:06,000
And applying for jobs in person really isn't much better.

[The Way We Work]

5
0:00:11.181,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hiring as we know it is broken on many fronts.

6
0:00:13.661,000 --> 0:00:14,000
It's a terrible experience for people.

7
0:00:15.541,000 --> 0:00:16,000
About 75 percent of people

8
0:00:17.381,000 --> 0:00:19,000
who applied to jobs using various methods in the past year

9
0:00:20.261,000 --> 0:00:22,000
said they never heard anything back from the employer.

10
0:00:22.941,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And at the company level it's not much better.

11
0:00:25.141,000 --> 0:00:27,000
46 percent of people get fired or quit

12
0:00:27.941,000 --> 0:00:29,000
within the first year of starting their jobs.

13
0:00:30.141,000 --> 0:00:31,000
It's pretty mind-blowing.

14
0:00:31.381,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It's also bad for the economy.

15
0:00:32.861,000 --> 0:00:33,000
For the first time in history,

16
0:00:34.341,000 --> 0:00:36,000
we have more open jobs than we have unemployed people,

17
0:00:37.221,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and to me that screams that we have a problem.

18
0:00:39.421,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I believe that at the crux of all of this is a single piece of paper: the résumé.

19
0:00:43.421,000 --> 0:00:45,000
A résumé definitely has some useful pieces in it:

20
0:00:45.781,000 --> 0:00:47,000
what roles people have had, computer skills,

21
0:00:47.901,000 --> 0:00:48,000
what languages they speak,

22
0:00:49.181,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but what it misses is what they have the potential to do

23
0:00:52.261,000 --> 0:00:54,000
that they might not have had the opportunity to do in the past.

24
0:00:55.261,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And with such a quickly changing economy where jobs are coming online

25
0:00:58.541,000 --> 0:01:,000
that might require skills that nobody has,

26
0:01:00.621,000 --> 0:01:02,000
if we only look at what someone has done in the past,

27
0:01:03.421,000 --> 0:01:06,000
we're not going to be able to match people to the jobs of the future.

28
0:01:06.701,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So this is where I think technology can be really helpful.

29
0:01:09.461,000 --> 0:01:11,000
You've probably seen that algorithms have gotten pretty good

30
0:01:12.341,000 --> 0:01:13,000
at matching people to things,

31
0:01:13.901,000 --> 0:01:15,000
but what if we could use that same technology

32
0:01:16.181,000 --> 0:01:19,000
to actually help us find jobs that we're really well-suited for?

33
0:01:19.301,000 --> 0:01:2,000
But I know what you're thinking.

34
0:01:20.901,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Algorithms picking your next job sounds a little bit scary,

35
0:01:23.701,000 --> 0:01:25,000
but there is one thing that has been shown

36
0:01:25.781,000 --> 0:01:27,000
to be really predictive of someone's future success in a job,

37
0:01:28.701,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and that's what's called a multimeasure test.

38
0:01:30.861,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Multimeasure tests really aren't anything new,

39
0:01:33.061,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but they used to be really expensive

40
0:01:34.821,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and required a PhD sitting across from you

41
0:01:36.861,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and answering lots of questions and writing reports.

42
0:01:39.341,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Multimeasure tests are a way

43
0:01:41.061,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to understand someone's inherent traits --

44
0:01:43.541,000 --> 0:01:44,000
your memory, your attentiveness.

45
0:01:46.255,000 --> 0:01:47,000
What if we could take multimeasure tests

46
0:01:48.221,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and make them scalable and accessible,

47
0:01:50.781,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and provide data to employers about really what the traits are

48
0:01:54.181,000 --> 0:01:56,000
of someone who can make them a good fit for a job?

49
0:01:57.101,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This all sounds abstract.

50
0:01:58.421,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Let's try one of the games together.

51
0:02:00.18,000 --> 0:02:01,000
You're about to see a flashing circle,

52
0:02:02.061,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and your job is going to be to clap when the circle is red

53
0:02:05.878,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and do nothing when it's green.

54
0:02:07.399,000 --> 0:02:08,000
[Ready?]

55
0:02:08.8,000 --> 0:02:09,000
[Begin!]

56
0:02:11.301,000 --> 0:02:12,000
[Green circle]

57
0:02:13.301,000 --> 0:02:14,000
[Green circle]

58
0:02:15.301,000 --> 0:02:16,000
[Red circle]

59
0:02:17.301,000 --> 0:02:18,000
[Green circle]

60
0:02:19.301,000 --> 0:02:2,000
[Red circle]

61
0:02:21.521,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Maybe you're the type of person

62
0:02:23.141,000 --> 0:02:25,000
who claps the millisecond after a red circle appears.

63
0:02:25.661,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Or maybe you're the type of person

64
0:02:27.341,000 --> 0:02:29,000
who takes just a little bit longer to be 100 percent sure.

65
0:02:30.101,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Or maybe you clap on green even though you're not supposed to.

66
0:02:33.061,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The cool thing here is that this isn't like a standardized test

67
0:02:36.061,000 --> 0:02:38,000
where some people are employable and some people aren't.

68
0:02:38.741,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Instead it's about understanding the fit between your characteristics

69
0:02:42.021,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and what would make you good a certain job.

70
0:02:44.061,000 --> 0:02:47,000
We found that if you clap late on red and you never clap on the green,

71
0:02:47.821,000 --> 0:02:5,000
you might be high in attentiveness and high in restraint.

72
0:02:51.021,000 --> 0:02:54,000
People in that quadrant tend to be great students, great test-takers,

73
0:02:54.621,000 --> 0:02:56,000
great at project management or accounting.

74
0:02:56.781,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But if you clap immediately on red and sometimes clap on green,

75
0:03:00.141,000 --> 0:03:02,000
that might mean that you're more impulsive and creative,

76
0:03:02.821,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and we've found that top-performing salespeople often embody these traits.

77
0:03:06.721,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The way we actually use this in hiring

78
0:03:08.761,000 --> 0:03:11,000
is we have top performers in a role go through neuroscience exercises

79
0:03:12.481,000 --> 0:03:13,000
like this one.

80
0:03:13.721,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Then we develop an algorithm

81
0:03:15.121,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that understands what makes those top performers unique.

82
0:03:17.801,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And then when people apply to the job,

83
0:03:19.761,000 --> 0:03:23,000
we're able to surface the candidates who might be best suited for that job.

84
0:03:23.921,000 --> 0:03:25,000
So you might be thinking there's a danger in this.

85
0:03:26.321,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The work world today is not the most diverse

86
0:03:28.481,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and if we're building algorithms based on current top performers,

87
0:03:31.601,000 --> 0:03:32,000
how do we make sure

88
0:03:32.841,000 --> 0:03:34,000
that we're not just perpetuating the biases that already exist?

89
0:03:35.841,000 --> 0:03:39,000
For example, if we were building an algorithm based on top performing CEOs

90
0:03:39.921,000 --> 0:03:42,000
and use the S&P 500 as a training set,

91
0:03:43.161,000 --> 0:03:44,000
you would actually find

92
0:03:44.441,000 --> 0:03:47,000
that you're more likely to hire a white man named John than any woman.

93
0:03:48.281,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And that's the reality of who's in those roles right now.

94
0:03:51.001,000 --> 0:03:54,000
But technology actually poses a really interesting opportunity.

95
0:03:54.401,000 --> 0:03:56,000
We can create algorithms that are more equitable

96
0:03:56.681,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and more fair than human beings have ever been.

97
0:03:58.961,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Every algorithm that we put into production has been pretested

98
0:04:02.681,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to ensure that it doesn't favor any gender or ethnicity.

99
0:04:05.801,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And if there's any population that's being overfavored,

100
0:04:08.561,000 --> 0:04:11,000
we can actually alter the algorithm until that's no longer true.

101
0:04:12.041,000 --> 0:04:14,000
When we focus on the inherent characteristics

102
0:04:14.281,000 --> 0:04:16,000
that can make somebody a good fit for a job,

103
0:04:16.401,000 --> 0:04:19,000
we can transcend racism, classism, sexism, ageism --

104
0:04:20.001,000 --> 0:04:21,000
even good schoolism.

105
0:04:21.441,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Our best technology and algorithms shouldn't just be used

106
0:04:24.361,000 --> 0:04:27,000
for helping us find our next movie binge or new favorite Justin Bieber song.

107
0:04:28.121,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Imagine if we could harness the power of technology

108
0:04:30.801,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to get real guidance on what we should be doing

109
0:04:33.121,000 --> 0:04:34,000
based on who we are at a deeper level.

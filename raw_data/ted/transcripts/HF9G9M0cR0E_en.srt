1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I became an inventor by accident.

2
0:00:20.33,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I was out of the air force in 1956. No, no, that's not true:

3
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I went in in 1956, came out in 1959,

4
0:00:28.33,000 --> 0:00:3,000
was working at the University of Washington,

5
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and I came up with an idea, from reading a magazine article,

6
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm.

7
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Now, that was before cassette tapes, C.D.s, DVDs --

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
any of the cool stuff we've got now.

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And it was an arm that,

10
0:00:42.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record,

11
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:5,000
went straight: a radial, linear tracking tone arm.

12
0:00:50.33,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And it was the hardest invention I ever made, but it got me started,

13
0:00:54.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and I got really lucky after that.

14
0:00:56.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And without giving you too much of a tirade,

15
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
I want to talk to you about an invention I brought with me today:

16
0:01:01.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
my 44th invention. No, that's not true either.

17
0:01:05.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Golly, I'm just totally losing it.

18
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
My 44th patent; about the 15th invention.

19
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I call this hypersonic sound.

20
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes,

21
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
but I want to make an analogy before I do

22
0:01:17.33,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to this.

23
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say,

24
0:01:23.33,000 --> 0:01:25,000
That's really cool, but what's it good for?

25
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I say, What is the light bulb good for?

26
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Sound, light: I'm going to draw the analogy.

27
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
When Edison invented the light bulb, pretty much looked like this.

28
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Hasn't changed that much.

29
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Light came out of it in every direction.

30
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Before the light bulb was invented,

31
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it,

32
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
focus it a little bit;

33
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
put lenses in front of it,

34
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
focus it a little bit better.

35
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers

36
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that were totally focused.

37
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Now, think about where the world would be today

38
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:03,000
if we had the light bulb,

39
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but you couldn't focus light;

40
0:02:05.33,000 --> 0:02:1,000
if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to.

41
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
That's the way loudspeakers pretty much are.

42
0:02:13.33,000 --> 0:02:15,000
You turn on the loudspeaker,

43
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets,

44
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
the sound just kind of goes where it wants.

45
0:02:21.33,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Even when you're standing in front of a megaphone,

46
0:02:23.33,000 --> 0:02:25,000
it's pretty much every direction.

47
0:02:25.33,000 --> 0:02:28,000
A little bit of differential, but not much.

48
0:02:28.33,000 --> 0:02:31,000
If the light bulb was the way the speaker is,

49
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and you couldn't focus or sharpen the edges or define it,

50
0:02:34.33,000 --> 0:02:39,000
we wouldn't have that, or movies in general,

51
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
or computers, or T.V. sets,

52
0:02:42.33,000 --> 0:02:45,000
or C.D.s, or DVDs -- and just go down the list

53
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
of what the importance is

54
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:5,000
of being able to focus light.

55
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now, after almost 80 years of having sound,

56
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I thought it was about time that we figure out

57
0:02:56.33,000 --> 0:03:,000
a way to put sound where you want to.

58
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I have a couple of units.

59
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
That guy there was made for a demo I did yesterday early in the day

60
0:03:04.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
for a big car maker in Detroit who wants to put them in a car --

61
0:03:07.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
small version, over your head --

62
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car.

63
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:17,000
What if I could aim sound the way I aim light?

64
0:03:18.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
I got this waterfall I recorded in my back yard.

65
0:03:21.33,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Now, you're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you.

66
0:03:25.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Maybe if I hit the side wall it will bounce around the room.

67
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
(Applause)

68
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
The sound is being made right next to your ears. Is that cool?

69
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Applause)

70
0:03:43.33,000 --> 0:03:45,000
Because I have some limited time, I'll cut it off for a second,

71
0:03:45.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and tell you about how it works and what it's good for.

72
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Course, like light, it's great to be able to put sound

73
0:03:51.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to highlight a clothing rack, or the cornflakes, or the toothpaste,

74
0:03:54.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby.

75
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Sony's got an idea -- Sony's our biggest customers right now.

76
0:04:01.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
They tried this back in the '60s

77
0:04:03.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and were too smart, and so they gave up.

78
0:04:05.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But they want to use it -- seriously.

79
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:1,000
There's a mix an inventor has to have.

80
0:04:10.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
You have to be kind of smart,

81
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and though I did not graduate from college doesn't mean I'm stupid,

82
0:04:16.33,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because you cannot be stupid and do very much in the world today.

83
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Too many other smart people out there. So.

84
0:04:21.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I just happened to get my education in a little different way.

85
0:04:23.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
I'm not at all against education.

86
0:04:26.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I think it's wonderful; I think sometimes people,

87
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
when they get educated, lose it:

88
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:35,000
they get so smart they're unwilling to look at things that they know better than.

89
0:04:35.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And we're living in a great time right now,

90
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
because almost everything's being explored anew.

91
0:04:41.33,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I have this little slogan that I use a lot, which is:

92
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
virtually nothing --

93
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and I mean this honestly --

94
0:04:48.33,000 --> 0:04:5,000
has been invented yet.

95
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We're just starting.

96
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
We're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics.

97
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And this is, I hope, a little piece of it.

98
0:04:58.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Sony's got this vision back -- to get myself on track --

99
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket,

100
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
you're going to watch a new T.V. channel.

101
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
They know that when you watch T.V. at home,

102
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:11,000
because there are so many choices

103
0:05:11.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
you can change channels, miss their commercials.

104
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
A hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket.

105
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Now, they've tried this a couple years ago and it failed,

106
0:05:22.33,000 --> 0:05:24,000
because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message

107
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:28,000
every 20 minutes, and reaches out, turns off the sound.

108
0:05:28.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And, you know, if the sound isn't there, the sale typically isn't made.

109
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
For instance, like, when you're on an airplane, they show the movie,

110
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
you get to watch it for free;

111
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
when you want to hear the sound, you pay.

112
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And so ABC and Sony have devised this new thing

113
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
where when you step in the line in the supermarket --

114
0:05:45.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
initially it'll be Safeways. It is Safeways;

115
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
they're trying this in three parts of the country right now --

116
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:52,000
you'll be watching TV.

117
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And hopefully they'll be sensitive

118
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that they don't want to offend you with just one more outlet.

119
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:59,000
But what's great about it, from the tests that have been done, is,

120
0:05:59.33,000 --> 0:06:01,000
if you don't want to hear it,

121
0:06:01.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
you take about one step to the side and you don't hear it.

122
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So, we create silence as much as we create sound.

123
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
ATMs that talk to you; nobody else hears it.

124
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Sit in bed, two in the morning, watch TV;

125
0:06:13.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
your spouse, or someone, is next to you, asleep;

126
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
doesn't hear it, doesn't wake up.

127
0:06:19.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
We're also working on noise canceling things like snoring, noise from automobiles.

128
0:06:25.33,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I have been really lucky with this technology:

129
0:06:29.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
all of a sudden as it is ready, the world is ready to accept it.

130
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
They have literally beat a path to our door.

131
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:39,000
We've been selling it since about last September, October,

132
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and it's been immensely gratifying.

133
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
If you're interested in what it costs -- I'm not selling them today --

134
0:06:44.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
but this unit, with the electronics and everything,

135
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
if you buy one, is around a thousand bucks.

136
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
We expect by this time next year,

137
0:06:50.33,000 --> 0:06:52,000
it'll be hundreds, a few hundred bucks, to buy it.

138
0:06:52.33,000 --> 0:06:56,000
It's not any more pricey than regular electronics.

139
0:06:56.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
Now, when I played it for you, you didn't hear the thunderous bass.

140
0:07:00.33,000 --> 0:07:05,000
This unit that I played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing.

141
0:07:05.33,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound --

142
0:07:09.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
that's about 100,000 vibrations per second.

143
0:07:12.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And the sound that you're hearing,

144
0:07:14.33,000 --> 0:07:18,000
unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face,

145
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
is made out in front of it, in the air.

146
0:07:21.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The air is not linear, as we've always been taught.

147
0:07:25.33,000 --> 0:07:27,000
You turn up the volume just a little bit --

148
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:3,000
I'm talking about a little over 80 decibels --

149
0:07:30.33,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate.

150
0:07:34.33,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Here's why: the speed of sound is not a constant. It's fairly slow.

151
0:07:39.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
It changes with temperature and with barometric pressure.

152
0:07:43.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Now, imagine, if you will, without getting too technical,

153
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I'm making a little sine wave here in the air.

154
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Well, if I turn up the amplitude too much,

155
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I'm having an effect on the pressure,

156
0:07:55.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
which means during the making of that sine wave,

157
0:07:58.33,000 --> 0:08:01,000
the speed at which it is propagating is shifting.

158
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:04,000
All of audio as we know it

159
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear.

160
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Linearity means higher quality sound.

161
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite:

162
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
it's 100 percent based on non-linearity.

163
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
An effect happens in the air, it's a corrupting effect of the sound --

164
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the ultrasound in this case -- that's emitted,

165
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
but it's so predictable

166
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect.

167
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now, the question is, where's the sound made?

168
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Instead of being made on the face of the cone,

169
0:08:39.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
it's made at literally billions of little independent points

170
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
along this narrow column in the air,

171
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and so when I aim it towards you,

172
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:52,000
what you hear is made right next to your ears.

173
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
I said we can shorten the column,

174
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
we can spread it out to cover the couch.

175
0:08:57.33,000 --> 0:09:,000
I can put it so that one ear hears one speaker,

176
0:09:00.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
the other ear hears the other. That's true binaural sound.

177
0:09:04.33,000 --> 0:09:07,000
When you listen to stereo on your home system,

178
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
your both ears hear both speakers.

179
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Turn on the left speaker sometime

180
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and notice you're hearing it also in your right ear.

181
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So, the stage is more restricted --

182
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the sound stage that's supposed to spread out in front of you.

183
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Because the sound is made in the air along this column,

184
0:09:23.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
it does not follow the inverse square law,

185
0:09:25.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
which says it drops off about two thirds

186
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
every time you double the distance:

187
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:35,000
6dB every time you go from one meter, for instance, to two meters.

188
0:09:35.33,000 --> 0:09:38,000
That means you go to a rock concert or a symphony,

189
0:09:38.33,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and the guy in the front row gets the same level

190
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:42,000
as the guy in the back row, now, all of a sudden.

191
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Isn't that terrific?

192
0:09:45.33,000 --> 0:09:48,000
So, we've been, as I say, very successful, very lucky,

193
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in having companies catch the vision of this,

194
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
from cars -- car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids,

195
0:09:55.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and a separate system in the back --

196
0:09:57.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
oh, no, the kids aren't driving today.

197
0:09:59.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Laughter)

198
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:02,000
I was seeing if you were listening.

199
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Actually, I haven't had breakfast yet.

200
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
A stereo system in the front for mom and dad,

201
0:10:08.33,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and maybe there's a little DVD player in the back for the kids,

202
0:10:11.33,000 --> 0:10:13,000
and the parents don't want to be bothered with that,

203
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:15,000
or their rap music or whatever.

204
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So, again, this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to

205
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:2,000
is really starting to catch on.

206
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:24,000
It also works for transmitting and communicating data.

207
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:27,000
It also works five times better underwater.

208
0:10:27.33,000 --> 0:10:31,000
We've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into Iraq,

209
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
where you can put fake troop movements

210
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
quarter of a mile away on a hillside.

211
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Laughter)

212
0:10:39.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some Biblical verse.

213
0:10:43.33,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Laughter)

214
0:10:45.33,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I'm serious. And they have these infrared devices

215
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:54,000
that can look at their countenance,

216
0:10:54.33,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and see a fraction of a degree Kelvin in temperature shift

217
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
from 100 yards away when they play this thing.

218
0:11:01.33,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And so, another way of hopefully determining who's friendly and who isn't.

219
0:11:05.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels.

220
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Pain is 120.

221
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people,

222
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and there can be a public beach just off to the side,

223
0:11:18.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
and they don't even know it's turned on.

224
0:11:20.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
We sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars,

225
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and they're buying them as fast as we can make them.

226
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
We put it on a turret with a camera, so that when they shoot at you,

227
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
you're over there, and it's there.

228
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I have a bunch of other inventions.

229
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I invented a plasma antenna, to shift gears.

230
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Looked up at the ceiling of my office one day --

231
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I was working on a ground-penetrating radar project --

232
0:11:45.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and my physicist CEO came in and said, "We have a real problem.

233
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:52,000
We're using very short wavelengths.

234
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:54,000
We've got a problem with the antenna ringing.

235
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
When you run very short wavelengths,

236
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
like a tuning fork the antenna resonates,

237
0:11:58.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
and there's more energy coming out of the antenna

238
0:12:00.33,000 --> 0:12:02,000
than there is the backscatter from the ground

239
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that we're trying to analyze, taking too much processing."

240
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
I says, "Why don't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it?

241
0:12:10.33,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Turn it on; turn it off.

242
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:18,000
That's a fluorescent tube refined."

243
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I just sold that for a million and a half dollars, cash.

244
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:24,000
I took it back to the Pentagon after it got declassified,

245
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:28,000
when the patent issued, and told the people back there about it,

246
0:12:28.33,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and they laughed, and then I took them back a demo and they bought.

247
0:12:30.33,000 --> 0:12:32,000
(Laughter)

248
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Any of you ever wore a Jabber headphone -- the little cell headphones?

249
0:12:37.33,000 --> 0:12:39,000
That's my invention. I sold that for seven million dollars.

250
0:12:39.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Big mistake: it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago.

251
0:12:43.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
I actually drew that up on a little crummy Mac computer

252
0:12:46.33,000 --> 0:12:49,000
in my attic at my house,

253
0:12:49.33,000 --> 0:12:52,000
and one of the many designs which they have now

254
0:12:52.33,000 --> 0:12:54,000
is still the same design I drew way back when.

255
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So, I've been really lucky as an inventor.

256
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I'm the happiest guy you're ever going to meet.

257
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:06,000
And my dad died before he realized anybody in the family

258
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
would maybe, hopefully, make something out of themselves.

259
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:11,000
You've been a great audience. I know I've jumped all over the place.

260
0:13:11.33,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I usually figure out what my talk is when I get up in front of a group.

261
0:13:14.33,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Let me give you, in the last minute,

262
0:13:16.33,000 --> 0:13:19,000
one more quick demo of this guy,

263
0:13:19.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
for those of you that haven't heard it.

264
0:13:22.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Can never tell if it's on.

265
0:13:24.33,000 --> 0:13:27,000
If you haven't heard it, raise your hand.

266
0:13:29.33,000 --> 0:13:32,000
Getting it over there?

267
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Get the cameraman.

268
0:13:35.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
Yeah, there you go.

269
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I've got a Coke can opening that's right in your head; that's really cool.

270
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Thank you once again.

271
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:44,000
Appreciate it very much.

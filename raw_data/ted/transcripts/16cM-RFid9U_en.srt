1
0:00:12.781,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I want to tell you the story

2
0:00:14.362,000 --> 0:00:17,000
about the time I almost got kidnapped

3
0:00:18.214,000 --> 0:00:2,000
in the trunk of a red Mazda Miata.

4
0:00:22.157,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's the day after graduating from design school

5
0:00:25.129,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and I'm having a yard sale.

6
0:00:26.638,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And this guy pulls up in this red Mazda

7
0:00:29.356,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and he starts looking through my stuff.

8
0:00:31.491,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And he buys a piece of art that I made.

9
0:00:34.466,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And it turns out he's alone in town for the night,

10
0:00:38.109,000 --> 0:00:4,000
driving cross-country on a road trip

11
0:00:40.686,000 --> 0:00:41,000
before he goes into the Peace Corps.

12
0:00:42.822,000 --> 0:00:43,000
So I invite him out for a beer

13
0:00:45.202,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and he tells me all about his passion

14
0:00:47.647,000 --> 0:00:49,000
for making a difference in the world.

15
0:00:50.647,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now it's starting to get late,

16
0:00:52.11,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and I'm getting pretty tired.

17
0:00:54.757,000 --> 0:00:55,000
As I motion for the tab,

18
0:00:56.428,000 --> 0:00:58,000
I make the mistake of asking him,

19
0:00:59.493,000 --> 0:01:,000
"So where are you staying tonight?"

20
0:01:01.838,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And he makes it worse by saying,

21
0:01:04.138,000 --> 0:01:06,000
"Actually, I don't have a place."

22
0:01:07.575,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And I'm thinking, "Oh, man!"

23
0:01:10.662,000 --> 0:01:11,000
What do you do?

24
0:01:12.751,000 --> 0:01:13,000
We've all been there, right?

25
0:01:15.212,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Do I offer to host this guy?

26
0:01:17.37,000 --> 0:01:19,000
But, I just met him -- I mean,

27
0:01:19.507,000 --> 0:01:2,000
he says he's going to the Peace Corps,

28
0:01:21.357,000 --> 0:01:23,000
but I don't really know if he's going to the Peace Corps

29
0:01:24.016,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I don't want to end up kidnapped in the trunk of a Miata.

30
0:01:26.92,000 --> 0:01:27,000
That's a small trunk!

31
0:01:30.062,000 --> 0:01:32,000
So then I hear myself saying,

32
0:01:32.179,000 --> 0:01:35,000
"Hey, I have an airbed you can stay on in my living room."

33
0:01:36.06,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And the voice in my head goes,

34
0:01:37.571,000 --> 0:01:38,000
"Wait, what?"

35
0:01:40.634,000 --> 0:01:41,000
That night, I'm laying in bed,

36
0:01:42.539,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I'm staring at the ceiling and thinking,

37
0:01:45.211,000 --> 0:01:48,000
"Oh my god, what have I done?

38
0:01:48.501,000 --> 0:01:51,000
There's a complete stranger sleeping in my living room.

39
0:01:52.702,000 --> 0:01:53,000
What if he's psychotic?"

40
0:01:55.029,000 --> 0:01:56,000
My anxiety grows so much,

41
0:01:56.353,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I leap out of bed,

42
0:01:58.237,000 --> 0:02:,000
I sneak on my tiptoes to the door,

43
0:02:00.954,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and I lock the bedroom door.

44
0:02:04.274,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It turns out he was not psychotic.

45
0:02:06.898,000 --> 0:02:07,000
We've kept in touch ever since.

46
0:02:08.447,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And the piece of art he bought at the yard sale

47
0:02:10.761,000 --> 0:02:12,000
is hanging in his classroom; he's a teacher now.

48
0:02:15.025,000 --> 0:02:16,000
This was my first hosting experience,

49
0:02:16.836,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and it completely changed my perspective.

50
0:02:21.198,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Maybe the people that my childhood taught me to label as strangers

51
0:02:25.984,000 --> 0:02:27,000
were actually friends waiting to be discovered.

52
0:02:29.606,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The idea of hosting people on airbeds gradually became natural to me

53
0:02:33.511,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and when I moved to San Francisco,

54
0:02:35.194,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I brought the airbed with me.

55
0:02:37.185,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So now it's two years later.

56
0:02:39.172,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I'm unemployed, I'm almost broke,

57
0:02:42.075,000 --> 0:02:45,000
my roommate moves out, and then the rent goes up.

58
0:02:46.248,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And then I learn there's a design conference coming to town,

59
0:02:49.075,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and all the hotels are sold out.

60
0:02:50.89,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I've always believed that turning fear into fun

61
0:02:54.394,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is the gift of creativity.

62
0:02:56.749,000 --> 0:03:01,000
So here's what I pitch my best friend and my new roommate Brian Chesky:

63
0:03:02.084,000 --> 0:03:04,000
"Brian, thought of a way to make a few bucks --

64
0:03:04.408,000 --> 0:03:06,000
turning our place into 'designers bed and breakfast,'

65
0:03:06.915,000 --> 0:03:08,000
offering young designers who come to town a place to crash,

66
0:03:09.718,000 --> 0:03:11,000
complete with wireless Internet, a small desk space,

67
0:03:12.189,000 --> 0:03:14,000
sleeping mat, and breakfast each morning.

68
0:03:14.229,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Ha!"

69
0:03:16.566,000 --> 0:03:19,000
We built a basic website and Airbed and Breakfast was born.

70
0:03:20.78,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Three lucky guests got to stay

71
0:03:22.969,000 --> 0:03:24,000
on a 20-dollar airbed on the hardwood floor.

72
0:03:26.052,000 --> 0:03:28,000
But they loved it, and so did we.

73
0:03:29.024,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I swear, the ham and Swiss cheese omelets we made

74
0:03:31.43,000 --> 0:03:34,000
tasted totally different because we made them for our guests.

75
0:03:35.618,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We took them on adventures around the city,

76
0:03:37.824,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and when we said goodbye to the last guest,

77
0:03:40.46,000 --> 0:03:41,000
the door latch clicked,

78
0:03:42.927,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Brian and I just stared at each other.

79
0:03:45.811,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Did we just discover it was possible to make friends

80
0:03:49.294,000 --> 0:03:5,000
while also making rent?

81
0:03:52.08,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The wheels had started to turn.

82
0:03:54.023,000 --> 0:03:55,000
My old roommate, Nate Blecharczyk,

83
0:03:55.698,000 --> 0:03:57,000
joined as engineering co-founder.

84
0:03:58.93,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And we buckled down to see

85
0:04:00.643,000 --> 0:04:01,000
if we could turn this into a business.

86
0:04:03.956,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Here's what we pitched investors:

87
0:04:08.507,000 --> 0:04:09,000
"We want to build a website

88
0:04:09.838,000 --> 0:04:12,000
where people publicly post pictures of their most intimate spaces,

89
0:04:13.404,000 --> 0:04:14,000
their bedrooms, the bathrooms --

90
0:04:15.285,000 --> 0:04:18,000
the kinds of rooms you usually keep closed when people come over.

91
0:04:18.735,000 --> 0:04:19,000
And then, over the Internet,

92
0:04:20.43,000 --> 0:04:23,000
they're going to invite complete strangers to come sleep in their homes.

93
0:04:23.887,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's going to be huge!"

94
0:04:25.316,000 --> 0:04:27,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:27.506,000 --> 0:04:3,000
We sat back, and we waited for the rocket ship to blast off.

96
0:04:31.24,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It did not.

97
0:04:34.994,000 --> 0:04:36,000
No one in their right minds would invest in a service

98
0:04:37.53,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that allows strangers to sleep in people's homes.

99
0:04:40.126,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Why?

100
0:04:41.629,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Because we've all been taught as kids, strangers equal danger.

101
0:04:46.038,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Now, when you're faced with a problem, you fall back on what you know,

102
0:04:49.609,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and all we really knew was design.

103
0:04:52.751,000 --> 0:04:54,000
In art school, you learn that design is much more

104
0:04:55.236,000 --> 0:04:58,000
than the look and feel of something -- it's the whole experience.

105
0:04:58.881,000 --> 0:04:59,000
We learned to do that for objects,

106
0:05:00.556,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but here, we were aiming to build Olympic trust

107
0:05:04.864,000 --> 0:05:05,000
between people who had never met.

108
0:05:08.504,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Could design make that happen?

109
0:05:11.35,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Is it possible to design for trust?

110
0:05:15.801,000 --> 0:05:18,000
I want to give you a sense of the flavor of trust

111
0:05:18.826,000 --> 0:05:19,000
that we were aiming to achieve.

112
0:05:21.412,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I've got a 30-second experiment

113
0:05:23.146,000 --> 0:05:25,000
that will push you past your comfort zone.

114
0:05:25.618,000 --> 0:05:27,000
If you're up for it, give me a thumbs-up.

115
0:05:30.429,000 --> 0:05:33,000
OK, I need you to take out your phones.

116
0:05:38.773,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Now that you have your phone out,

117
0:05:40.39,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I'd like you to unlock your phone.

118
0:05:45.807,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Now hand your unlocked phone to the person on your left.

119
0:05:49.648,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:01.734,000 --> 0:06:03,000
That tiny sense of panic you're feeling right now --

121
0:06:04.571,000 --> 0:06:05,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:06.27,000 --> 0:06:09,000
is exactly how hosts feel the first time they open their home.

123
0:06:10.581,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Because the only thing more personal than your phone

124
0:06:13.362,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is your home.

125
0:06:15.171,000 --> 0:06:16,000
People don't just see your messages,

126
0:06:16.914,000 --> 0:06:17,000
they see your bedroom,

127
0:06:18.197,000 --> 0:06:19,000
your kitchen, your toilet.

128
0:06:21.401,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Now, how does it feel holding someone's unlocked phone?

129
0:06:26.185,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Most of us feel really responsible.

130
0:06:29.017,000 --> 0:06:32,000
That's how most guests feel when they stay in a home.

131
0:06:32.842,000 --> 0:06:34,000
And it's because of this that our company can even exist.

132
0:06:36.619,000 --> 0:06:38,000
By the way, who's holding Al Gore's phone?

133
0:06:39.118,000 --> 0:06:42,000
(Laughter)

134
0:06:42.6,000 --> 0:06:44,000
Would you tell Twitter he's running for President?

135
0:06:45.221,000 --> 0:06:47,000
(Laughter)

136
0:06:47.246,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Applause)

137
0:06:55.719,000 --> 0:06:57,000
OK, you can hand your phones back now.

138
0:07:03.589,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So now that you've experienced the kind of trust challenge

139
0:07:06.864,000 --> 0:07:07,000
we were facing,

140
0:07:08.128,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I'd love to share a few discoveries we've made along the way.

141
0:07:12.011,000 --> 0:07:14,000
What if we changed one small thing

142
0:07:14.294,000 --> 0:07:16,000
about the design of that experiment?

143
0:07:16.362,000 --> 0:07:19,000
What if your neighbor had introduced themselves first, with their name,

144
0:07:20.169,000 --> 0:07:22,000
where they're from, the name of their kids or their dog?

145
0:07:23.685,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Imagine that they had 150 reviews of people saying,

146
0:07:27.241,000 --> 0:07:29,000
"They're great at holding unlocked phones!"

147
0:07:29.67,000 --> 0:07:3,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:34.709,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Now how would you feel about handing your phone over?

149
0:07:39.784,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It turns out,

150
0:07:40.96,000 --> 0:07:43,000
a well-designed reputation system is key for building trust.

151
0:07:44.951,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And we didn't actually get it right the first time.

152
0:07:47.985,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It's hard for people to leave bad reviews.

153
0:07:51.447,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Eventually, we learned to wait until both guests and hosts

154
0:07:55.857,000 --> 0:07:57,000
left the review before we reveal them.

155
0:07:59.107,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Now, here's a discovery we made just last week.

156
0:08:02.984,000 --> 0:08:03,000
We did a joint study with Stanford,

157
0:08:04.912,000 --> 0:08:06,000
where we looked at people's willingness to trust someone

158
0:08:07.93,000 --> 0:08:11,000
based on how similar they are in age, location and geography.

159
0:08:13.467,000 --> 0:08:15,000
The research showed, not surprisingly,

160
0:08:16.451,000 --> 0:08:17,000
we prefer people who are like us.

161
0:08:20.094,000 --> 0:08:22,000
The more different somebody is,

162
0:08:22.953,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the less we trust them.

163
0:08:25.13,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Now, that's a natural social bias.

164
0:08:28.532,000 --> 0:08:3,000
But what's interesting is what happens

165
0:08:30.91,000 --> 0:08:31,000
when you add reputation into the mix,

166
0:08:32.892,000 --> 0:08:33,000
in this case, with reviews.

167
0:08:35.398,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Now, if you've got less than three reviews,

168
0:08:37.439,000 --> 0:08:38,000
nothing changes.

169
0:08:39.541,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But if you've got more than 10,

170
0:08:42.527,000 --> 0:08:43,000
everything changes.

171
0:08:44.467,000 --> 0:08:48,000
High reputation beats high similarity.

172
0:08:50.299,000 --> 0:08:52,000
The right design can actually help us overcome

173
0:08:53.053,000 --> 0:08:55,000
one of our most deeply rooted biases.

174
0:08:57.247,000 --> 0:09:,000
Now we also learned that building the right amount of trust

175
0:09:00.379,000 --> 0:09:02,000
takes the right amount of disclosure.

176
0:09:03.275,000 --> 0:09:06,000
This is what happens when a guest first messages a host.

177
0:09:07.862,000 --> 0:09:1,000
If you share too little, like, "Yo,"

178
0:09:12.886,000 --> 0:09:13,000
acceptance rates go down.

179
0:09:14.507,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And if you share too much, like,

180
0:09:16.648,000 --> 0:09:17,000
"I'm having issues with my mother,"

181
0:09:18.365,000 --> 0:09:19,000
(Laughter)

182
0:09:19.539,000 --> 0:09:2,000
acceptance rates also go down.

183
0:09:22.372,000 --> 0:09:23,000
But there's a zone that's just right,

184
0:09:24.341,000 --> 0:09:28,000
like, "Love the artwork in your place. Coming for vacation with my family."

185
0:09:28.663,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So how do we design for just the right amount of disclosure?

186
0:09:33.17,000 --> 0:09:35,000
We use the size of the box to suggest the right length,

187
0:09:36.639,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and we guide them with prompts to encourage sharing.

188
0:09:41.2,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We bet our whole company

189
0:09:44.145,000 --> 0:09:45,000
on the hope that,

190
0:09:45.813,000 --> 0:09:46,000
with the right design,

191
0:09:47.72,000 --> 0:09:5,000
people would be willing to overcome the stranger-danger bias.

192
0:09:51.918,000 --> 0:09:52,000
What we didn't realize

193
0:09:53.324,000 --> 0:09:55,000
is just how many people

194
0:09:55.782,000 --> 0:09:57,000
were ready and waiting to put the bias aside.

195
0:09:59.823,000 --> 0:10:01,000
This is a graph that shows our rate of adoption.

196
0:10:03.63,000 --> 0:10:04,000
There's three things happening here.

197
0:10:06.081,000 --> 0:10:09,000
The first, an unbelievable amount of luck.

198
0:10:10.841,000 --> 0:10:12,000
The second is the efforts of our team.

199
0:10:13.969,000 --> 0:10:16,000
And third is the existence of a previously unsatisfied need.

200
0:10:19.099,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Now, things have been going pretty well.

201
0:10:21.5,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Obviously, there are times when things don't work out.

202
0:10:25.647,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Guests have thrown unauthorized parties

203
0:10:27.635,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and trashed homes.

204
0:10:29.984,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Hosts have left guests stranded in the rain.

205
0:10:34.355,000 --> 0:10:37,000
In the early days, I was customer service,

206
0:10:38.213,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and those calls came right to my cell phone.

207
0:10:41.071,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I was at the front lines of trust breaking.

208
0:10:45.496,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And there's nothing worse than those calls,

209
0:10:48.068,000 --> 0:10:5,000
it hurts to even think about them.

210
0:10:51.113,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And the disappointment in the sound of someone's voice

211
0:10:53.83,000 --> 0:10:55,000
was and, I would say, still is

212
0:10:56.593,000 --> 0:10:58,000
our single greatest motivator to keep improving.

213
0:11:00.073,000 --> 0:11:05,000
Thankfully, out of the 123 million nights we've ever hosted,

214
0:11:05.932,000 --> 0:11:08,000
less than a fraction of a percent have been problematic.

215
0:11:10.447,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Turns out, people are justified in their trust.

216
0:11:13.705,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And when trust works out right,

217
0:11:15.951,000 --> 0:11:17,000
it can be absolutely magical.

218
0:11:19.417,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We had a guest stay with a host in Uruguay,

219
0:11:22.111,000 --> 0:11:23,000
and he suffered a heart attack.

220
0:11:24.274,000 --> 0:11:25,000
The host rushed him to the hospital.

221
0:11:27.354,000 --> 0:11:29,000
They donated their own blood for his operation.

222
0:11:31.342,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Let me read you his review.

223
0:11:33.916,000 --> 0:11:35,000
(Laughter)

224
0:11:41.053,000 --> 0:11:43,000
"Excellent house for sedentary travelers

225
0:11:43.356,000 --> 0:11:45,000
prone to myocardial infarctions.

226
0:11:45.623,000 --> 0:11:47,000
(Laughter)

227
0:11:48.557,000 --> 0:11:51,000
The area is beautiful and has direct access to the best hospitals.

228
0:11:52.528,000 --> 0:11:53,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:54.036,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Javier and Alejandra instantly become guardian angels

230
0:11:57.589,000 --> 0:11:59,000
who will save your life without even knowing you.

231
0:12:01.47,000 --> 0:12:04,000
They will rush you to the hospital in their own car while you're dying

232
0:12:05.106,000 --> 0:12:08,000
and stay in the waiting room while the doctors give you a bypass.

233
0:12:09.268,000 --> 0:12:12,000
They don't want you to feel lonely, they bring you books to read.

234
0:12:12.578,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And they let you stay at their house extra nights without charging you.

235
0:12:16.629,000 --> 0:12:17,000
Highly recommended!"

236
0:12:17.883,000 --> 0:12:19,000
(Applause)

237
0:12:26.342,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Of course, not every stay is like that.

238
0:12:29.089,000 --> 0:12:31,000
But this connection beyond the transaction

239
0:12:31.811,000 --> 0:12:33,000
is exactly what the sharing economy is aiming for.

240
0:12:35.74,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Now, when I heard that term,

241
0:12:37.833,000 --> 0:12:39,000
I have to admit, it tripped me up.

242
0:12:40.783,000 --> 0:12:42,000
How do sharing and transactions go together?

243
0:12:44.059,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So let's be clear; it is about commerce.

244
0:12:47.832,000 --> 0:12:49,000
But if you just called it the rental economy,

245
0:12:50.18,000 --> 0:12:51,000
it would be incomplete.

246
0:12:52.576,000 --> 0:12:56,000
The sharing economy is commerce with the promise of human connection.

247
0:12:57.612,000 --> 0:12:58,000
People share a part of themselves,

248
0:13:00.513,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and that changes everything.

249
0:13:03.428,000 --> 0:13:05,000
You know how most travel today is, like,

250
0:13:05.877,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I think of it like fast food --

251
0:13:07.632,000 --> 0:13:09,000
it's efficient and consistent,

252
0:13:10.833,000 --> 0:13:12,000
at the cost of local and authentic.

253
0:13:14.932,000 --> 0:13:16,000
What if travel were like a magnificent buffet

254
0:13:17.764,000 --> 0:13:18,000
of local experiences?

255
0:13:19.437,000 --> 0:13:21,000
What if anywhere you visited,

256
0:13:22.392,000 --> 0:13:24,000
there was a central marketplace of locals

257
0:13:24.661,000 --> 0:13:26,000
offering to get you thoroughly drunk

258
0:13:27.327,000 --> 0:13:3,000
on a pub crawl in neighborhoods you didn't even know existed.

259
0:13:32.416,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Or learning to cook from the chef of a five-star restaurant?

260
0:13:37.082,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Today, homes are designed around the idea of privacy and separation.

261
0:13:42.246,000 --> 0:13:45,000
What if homes were designed to be shared from the ground up?

262
0:13:46.433,000 --> 0:13:47,000
What would that look like?

263
0:13:49.673,000 --> 0:13:51,000
What if cities embraced a culture of sharing?

264
0:13:53.736,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I see a future of shared cities that bring us community and connection

265
0:13:58.534,000 --> 0:14:,000
instead of isolation and separation.

266
0:14:01.878,000 --> 0:14:02,000
In South Korea, in the city of Seoul,

267
0:14:03.883,000 --> 0:14:04,000
they've actually even started this.

268
0:14:05.59,000 --> 0:14:07,000
They've repurposed hundreds of government parking spots

269
0:14:08.49,000 --> 0:14:09,000
to be shared by residents.

270
0:14:10.866,000 --> 0:14:12,000
They're connecting students who need a place to live

271
0:14:13.487,000 --> 0:14:15,000
with empty-nesters who have extra rooms.

272
0:14:16.918,000 --> 0:14:19,000
And they've started an incubator to help fund the next generation

273
0:14:20.606,000 --> 0:14:21,000
of sharing economy start-ups.

274
0:14:24.96,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Tonight, just on our service,

275
0:14:29.46,000 --> 0:14:32,000
785,000 people

276
0:14:33.803,000 --> 0:14:35,000
in 191 countries

277
0:14:38.976,000 --> 0:14:4,000
will either stay in a stranger's home

278
0:14:42.154,000 --> 0:14:44,000
or welcome one into theirs.

279
0:14:46.014,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Clearly, it's not as crazy as we were taught.

280
0:14:51.169,000 --> 0:14:52,000
We didn't invent anything new.

281
0:14:53.568,000 --> 0:14:55,000
Hospitality has been around forever.

282
0:14:58.568,000 --> 0:15:01,000
There's been many other websites like ours.

283
0:15:02.18,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So, why did ours eventually take off?

284
0:15:08.513,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Luck and timing aside,

285
0:15:11.311,000 --> 0:15:13,000
I've learned that you can take the components of trust,

286
0:15:13.957,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and you can design for that.

287
0:15:19.39,000 --> 0:15:21,000
Design can overcome our most deeply rooted

288
0:15:22.395,000 --> 0:15:23,000
stranger-danger bias.

289
0:15:23.998,000 --> 0:15:24,000
And that's amazing to me.

290
0:15:26.304,000 --> 0:15:27,000
It blows my mind.

291
0:15:29.184,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I think about this every time I see a red Miata go by.

292
0:15:33.99,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Now, we know design won't solve all the world's problems.

293
0:15:40.511,000 --> 0:15:41,000
But if it can help out with this one,

294
0:15:42.318,000 --> 0:15:43,000
if it can make a dent in this,

295
0:15:44.709,000 --> 0:15:49,000
it makes me wonder, what else can we design for next?

296
0:15:52.341,000 --> 0:15:53,000
Thank you.

297
0:15:53.516,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.917,000 --> 0:00:19,000
Twelve years ago, I founded Zipcar.

3
0:00:20.679,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Zipcar buys cars and parks them

4
0:00:23.525,000 --> 0:00:25,000
throughout dense metropolitan areas

5
0:00:26.101,000 --> 0:00:29,000
for people to use, by the hour and by the day,

6
0:00:29.229,000 --> 0:00:31,000
instead of owning their own cars.

7
0:00:31.518,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Each Zipcar replaces 15 personal cars,

8
0:00:35.402,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and each driver drives about 80 percent less

9
0:00:38.506,000 --> 0:00:4,000
because they're now paying the full cost,

10
0:00:40.866,000 --> 0:00:42,000
all at once, in real time.

11
0:00:43.442,000 --> 0:00:47,000
But what Zipcar really did was make sharing the norm.

12
0:00:47.687,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Now, a decade later, it's really time to push the envelope a little bit,

13
0:00:51.938,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and so a couple years ago I moved to Paris

14
0:00:53.923,000 --> 0:00:55,000
with my husband and youngest child,

15
0:00:56.602,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and we launched Buzzcar a year ago.

16
0:00:59.822,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Buzzcar lets people rent out their own cars

17
0:01:03.079,000 --> 0:01:04,000
to their friends and neighbors.

18
0:01:04.746,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Instead of investing in a car, we invest in a community.

19
0:01:10.002,000 --> 0:01:12,000
We bring the power of a corporation

20
0:01:12.329,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to individuals who add their cars to the network.

21
0:01:15.442,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Some people call this peer-to-peer.

22
0:01:19.13,000 --> 0:01:22,000
This does express the humanity of what's going on,

23
0:01:22.418,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and the personal relationships,

24
0:01:24.855,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but that is also like saying that it's the same thing

25
0:01:27.551,000 --> 0:01:29,000
as a yard sale or a bake sale or babysitting.

26
0:01:30.404,000 --> 0:01:31,000
That's peer-to-peer.

27
0:01:31.629,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's like saying yard sales are the same thing as eBay,

28
0:01:36.516,000 --> 0:01:43,000
or craft fairs are the same thing as Etsy.

29
0:01:44.088,000 --> 0:01:46,000
But what's really happening is that we've got the power

30
0:01:46.45,000 --> 0:01:48,000
of a free and open Internet,

31
0:01:48.655,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and on top of that we're putting a platform for participation,

32
0:01:51.86,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and the peers are now in partnership with the company,

33
0:01:55.547,000 --> 0:01:58,000
creating shared value on shared values,

34
0:01:58.764,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and each strengthening the other, and doing what the other can't do.

35
0:02:03.733,000 --> 0:02:06,000
I call this Peers, Inc.

36
0:02:06.775,000 --> 0:02:08,000
The incorporated side, the company,

37
0:02:09.336,000 --> 0:02:11,000
is doing things that it does really well.

38
0:02:12.153,000 --> 0:02:15,000
What does it do really well? It creates economies of scale,

39
0:02:15.922,000 --> 0:02:18,000
significant and long-term resource investment,

40
0:02:19.665,000 --> 0:02:21,000
the expertise of many different kinds of people

41
0:02:22.47,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and different kinds of minds, and for individuals,

42
0:02:25.458,000 --> 0:02:28,000
consumers, it's bringing the standards, rules and recourse

43
0:02:28.722,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that we really want as consumers,

44
0:02:31.042,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and this is kind of bound up in a brand promise,

45
0:02:33.985,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and the companies are providing this on a platform for participation.

46
0:02:39.025,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Peers are giving and doing things

47
0:02:41.362,000 --> 0:02:44,000
that are incredibly expensive for companies to do.

48
0:02:44.369,000 --> 0:02:47,000
What do they bring? They bring this fabulous diversity,

49
0:02:48.193,000 --> 0:02:5,000
expensive for companies. And what does that deliver?

50
0:02:50.85,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It delivers localization and customization,

51
0:02:53.611,000 --> 0:02:56,000
specialization, and all of this aspect about social networks

52
0:02:57.018,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and how companies are yearning and eager to get inside there?

53
0:02:59.866,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It's natural for me. Me and my friends, I can connect to them easily.

54
0:03:03.962,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And it also delivers really fabulous innovation,

55
0:03:07.525,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and I'll talk about that later.

56
0:03:08.941,000 --> 0:03:11,000
So we have the peers that are providing the services and the product,

57
0:03:12.357,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and the company that's doing the stuff that companies do.

58
0:03:16.937,000 --> 0:03:2,000
The two of these are delivering the best of both worlds.

59
0:03:21.301,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Some of my favorite examples:

60
0:03:23.289,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in transportation, Carpooling.com. Ten years old,

61
0:03:27.242,000 --> 0:03:28,000
three and a half million people have joined up,

62
0:03:28.645,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and a million rides are shared every day.

63
0:03:31.203,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It's a phenomenal thing. It's the equivalent

64
0:03:34.435,000 --> 0:03:37,000
of 2,500 TGV trains,

65
0:03:37.522,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and just think, they didn't have to lay a track or buy a car.

66
0:03:41.498,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This is all happening with excess capacity.

67
0:03:44.242,000 --> 0:03:47,000
And it's not just with transportation, my love,

68
0:03:47.729,000 --> 0:03:5,000
but of course in other realms. Here's Fiverr.com.

69
0:03:50.882,000 --> 0:03:52,000
I met these founders just weeks after they had launched,

70
0:03:53.693,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and now, in two years, what would you do for five dollars?

71
0:03:58.149,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Seven hundred and fifty thousand gigs are now posted after two years,

72
0:04:02.417,000 --> 0:04:04,000
what people would do for five dollars.

73
0:04:05.242,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And not just easy things that anyone can do.

74
0:04:08.928,000 --> 0:04:12,000
This Peers, Inc. concept is in a very difficult and complex realm.

75
0:04:13.704,000 --> 0:04:17,000
TopCoder has 400,000 engineers who are delivering

76
0:04:17.9,000 --> 0:04:2,000
complex design and engineering services.

77
0:04:21.7,000 --> 0:04:23,000
When I talked to their CEO, he had this great line.

78
0:04:24.253,000 --> 0:04:28,000
He said, "We have a community that owns its own company."

79
0:04:29.043,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And then my all-time favorite, Etsy.

80
0:04:31.315,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Etsy is providing goods that people make themselves

81
0:04:34.586,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and they're selling it in a marketplace.

82
0:04:36.252,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It just celebrated its seventh anniversary,

83
0:04:39.667,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and after seven years, last year it delivered

84
0:04:42.235,000 --> 0:04:47,000
530 million dollars' worth of sales to all those individuals

85
0:04:47.727,000 --> 0:04:5,000
who have been making those objects.

86
0:04:50.883,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I know you guys out there who are businesspeople,

87
0:04:53.642,000 --> 0:04:55,000
are thinking, "Oh my God, I want to build one of those.

88
0:04:56.058,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I see this incredible speed and scale.

89
0:04:57.735,000 --> 0:04:59,000
You mean all I have to do is build a platform and all these people are going

90
0:05:00.244,000 --> 0:05:02,000
to put their stuff on top and I sit back and roll it in?"

91
0:05:03.012,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Building these platforms for participation are so nontrivial to do.

92
0:05:08.063,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I think of the difference of Google Video versus YouTube.

93
0:05:12.076,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Who would have thought that two young guys and a start-up

94
0:05:15.265,000 --> 0:05:17,000
would beat out Google Video? Why?

95
0:05:17.448,000 --> 0:05:19,000
I actually have no idea why. I didn't talk to them.

96
0:05:19.54,000 --> 0:05:21,000
But I'm thinking, you know, they probably had

97
0:05:22.172,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the "share" button a little bit brighter and to the right,

98
0:05:24.151,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and so it was easier and more convenient for the two sides

99
0:05:27.145,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that are always participating on these networks.

100
0:05:30.225,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So I actually know a lot about building a peer platform now,

101
0:05:34.424,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and a Peers, Inc. company, because I've spent

102
0:05:36.285,000 --> 0:05:39,000
the last two years doing that in Paris.

103
0:05:39.684,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So let me take you back how it's so incredibly different

104
0:05:43.105,000 --> 0:05:45,000
building Buzzcar than it was building Zipcar,

105
0:05:45.98,000 --> 0:05:47,000
because now every single thing we do has these two

106
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
different bodies that I have to be thinking about:

107
0:05:50.687,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the owners who are going to provide the cars

108
0:05:53.551,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and the drivers who are going to rent them.

109
0:05:55.998,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Every single decision, I have to think about what is right for both sides.

110
0:05:59.47,000 --> 0:06:01,000
There are many, many examples and I'll give you one

111
0:06:01.934,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that is not my favorite example: insurance.

112
0:06:05.256,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It took me a year and a half to get the insurance just right.

113
0:06:09.785,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Hours and hours of sitting with insurers and many companies

114
0:06:12.774,000 --> 0:06:15,000
and their thoughts about risk and how this is totally innovative,

115
0:06:16.52,000 --> 0:06:17,000
they'd never thought of it before.

116
0:06:18.351,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Way too much money, I just can't even go there, with lawyers,

117
0:06:21.718,000 --> 0:06:23,000
trying to figure out how this is different, who's responsible to whom,

118
0:06:24.502,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and the result was that we were able to provide owners

119
0:06:28.09,000 --> 0:06:32,000
protection for their own driving records and their own history.

120
0:06:32.382,000 --> 0:06:33,000
The cars are completely insured during the rental,

121
0:06:34.198,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and it gives drivers what they need, and what do they need?

122
0:06:37.862,000 --> 0:06:39,000
They need a low deductible,

123
0:06:40.367,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and 24-hour roadside assistance.

124
0:06:42.615,000 --> 0:06:44,000
So this was a trick to get these two sides.

125
0:06:45.499,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So now I want to take you to the moment of --

126
0:06:49.747,000 --> 0:06:52,000
When you're an entrepreneur, and you've started a new company,

127
0:06:53.715,000 --> 0:06:55,000
there's the, here's all the stuff we do beforehand,

128
0:06:56.109,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and then the service launches. What happens?

129
0:07:00.035,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So all those months of work, they come into play.

130
0:07:04.435,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Last June 1, we launched. It was an exciting moment.

131
0:07:08.633,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And all the owners are adding their cars. It's really exciting.

132
0:07:12.243,000 --> 0:07:14,000
All the drivers are becoming members. It's excellent.

133
0:07:14.669,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The reservations start coming in, and here,

134
0:07:19.115,000 --> 0:07:22,000
owners who were getting text messages and emails

135
0:07:22.182,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that said, "Hey, Joe wants to rent your car for the weekend.

136
0:07:25.275,000 --> 0:07:29,000
You can earn 60 euros. Isn't that great? Yes or no?"

137
0:07:29.679,000 --> 0:07:32,000
No reply. Like, a huge proportion of them

138
0:07:33.176,000 --> 0:07:37,000
couldn't be bothered after they had just started, they just signed up, to reply.

139
0:07:37.186,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So I thought, "Duh, Robin, this is the difference between

140
0:07:40.814,000 --> 0:07:43,000
industrial production and peer production."

141
0:07:43.957,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Industrial production, the whole point of industrial production

142
0:07:47.069,000 --> 0:07:5,000
is to provide a standardized, exact service model

143
0:07:50.543,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that is consistent every single time,

144
0:07:52.755,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and I'm really thankful that my smartphone is made

145
0:07:55.756,000 --> 0:07:56,000
using industrial production.

146
0:07:57.129,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And Zipcar provides a very nice, consistent service

147
0:07:59.867,000 --> 0:08:,000
that works fabulously.

148
0:08:01.451,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But what does peer production do? Peer production

149
0:08:04.593,000 --> 0:08:07,000
is this completely different way of doing things,

150
0:08:07.886,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and you have a big quality range, and so eBay, cleverly,

151
0:08:12.958,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the first peer production, Peer, Inc. company, I'd say,

152
0:08:16.279,000 --> 0:08:2,000
they figured out early on, we need to have ratings

153
0:08:20.877,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and commentaries and all that yucky side stuff.

154
0:08:24.261,000 --> 0:08:27,000
We can flag that and we can put it to the side, and people

155
0:08:27.509,000 --> 0:08:31,000
who are buyers and consumers don't have to deal with it.

156
0:08:31.824,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So going back, this is my look of excitement and joy,

157
0:08:36.882,000 --> 0:08:38,000
because all this stuff that I'd also been hoping for

158
0:08:39.316,000 --> 0:08:41,000
actually really did happen, and what's that?

159
0:08:41.343,000 --> 0:08:43,000
That is the diversity of what's going on.

160
0:08:44.156,000 --> 0:08:46,000
You have these different fabulous owners

161
0:08:46.788,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and their different cars, different prices,

162
0:08:50.218,000 --> 0:08:52,000
different locations. (Laughter)

163
0:08:52.356,000 --> 0:08:57,000
They dress differently, and they look different,

164
0:08:57.503,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and, really, I love these photos every time I look at them.

165
0:09:03.223,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Cool guys, excited guys,

166
0:09:06.333,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and here is Selma, who -- I love this driver.

167
0:09:11.112,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And after a year, we have 1,000 cars

168
0:09:13.732,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that are parked across France and 6,000 people

169
0:09:17.132,000 --> 0:09:19,000
who are members and eager to drive them.

170
0:09:19.5,000 --> 0:09:23,000
This would not be possible to do that in economic fashion

171
0:09:23.669,000 --> 0:09:25,000
for a traditional company.

172
0:09:26.03,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Back to this spectrum.

173
0:09:28.172,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So what's happening is, we had the yuck side,

174
0:09:30.888,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but we actually had this real wow side.

175
0:09:33.112,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And I can tell you two great stories.

176
0:09:35.852,000 --> 0:09:37,000
A driver was telling me that they went to rent a car

177
0:09:38.819,000 --> 0:09:41,000
to go up the coast of France and the owner gave it to them,

178
0:09:42.554,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and said, "You know what, here's where the cliffs are,

179
0:09:44.546,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and here's all the beaches, and this is my best beach,

180
0:09:47.066,000 --> 0:09:49,000
and this is where the best fish restaurant is."

181
0:09:49.866,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And the peers also become,

182
0:09:52.702,000 --> 0:09:54,000
peers and owners create relationships,

183
0:09:54.963,000 --> 0:09:56,000
and so at the last minute people can --

184
0:09:57.234,000 --> 0:09:59,000
a driver can say, "Hey, you know what, I really need the car,

185
0:09:59.891,000 --> 0:10:,000
is it available?" And that person will say,

186
0:10:01.381,000 --> 0:10:04,000
"Sure, my wife's at home. Go pick up the keys. Go do it."

187
0:10:04.492,000 --> 0:10:07,000
So you can have these really nice things that can't happen,

188
0:10:07.891,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and it's a kind of "Wow!" and I want to say "Wow!"

189
0:10:11.723,000 --> 0:10:13,000
type of thing that's happening here, because individuals,

190
0:10:14.203,000 --> 0:10:16,000
if you're a company, what happens is you might have

191
0:10:17.074,000 --> 0:10:18,000
10 people who are in charge of innovation,

192
0:10:18.824,000 --> 0:10:19,000
or 100 people who are in charge of innovation.

193
0:10:20.782,000 --> 0:10:23,000
What happens in Peer, Inc. companies is that you have

194
0:10:24.286,000 --> 0:10:27,000
tens and hundreds and thousands and even millions

195
0:10:27.358,000 --> 0:10:3,000
of people who are creating experiments on this model,

196
0:10:30.461,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and so out of all that influence and that effort,

197
0:10:33.046,000 --> 0:10:37,000
you are having this exceptional amount of innovation

198
0:10:37.437,000 --> 0:10:39,000
that is coming out.

199
0:10:39.856,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So one of the reasons, if we come back to why did I

200
0:10:43.224,000 --> 0:10:45,000
call it Buzzcar? I wanted to remind all of us

201
0:10:46.065,000 --> 0:10:48,000
about the power of the hive,

202
0:10:48.941,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and its incredible facility to create this platform

203
0:10:51.877,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that individuals want to participate and innovate on.

204
0:10:55.898,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And for me, when I think about our future,

205
0:10:59.318,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and all of those problems that seem incredibly large,

206
0:11:02.646,000 --> 0:11:05,000
the scale is impossible, the urgency is there,

207
0:11:05.732,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Peers, Inc. provides the speed and scale

208
0:11:08.766,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and the innovation and the creativity that is going to answer these problems.

209
0:11:13.352,000 --> 0:11:18,000
All we have to do is create a fabulous platform for participation -- nontrivial.

210
0:11:18.669,000 --> 0:11:2,000
So I continue to think that

211
0:11:21.446,000 --> 0:11:24,000
transportation is the center of the hard universe.

212
0:11:24.701,000 --> 0:11:26,000
All problems come back to transportation for me.

213
0:11:27.025,000 --> 0:11:3,000
But there are all these other areas that are these profound,

214
0:11:30.872,000 --> 0:11:33,000
big problems that I know that we can work on,

215
0:11:34.237,000 --> 0:11:36,000
and people are working on them in many different sectors,

216
0:11:37.013,000 --> 0:11:39,000
but there's this really fabulous group of things

217
0:11:39.558,000 --> 0:11:43,000
with the power of this Peers, Inc. model.

218
0:11:44.044,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So over the last decade, we've been reveling in

219
0:11:50.529,000 --> 0:11:53,000
the power of the Internet and how it's empowered individuals,

220
0:11:54.032,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and for me, what Peers, Inc. does

221
0:11:56.628,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is it takes it up a notch. We're now bringing the power

222
0:12:00.464,000 --> 0:12:02,000
of the company and the corporation

223
0:12:03.46,000 --> 0:12:05,000
and supercharging individuals.

224
0:12:06.325,000 --> 0:12:09,000
So for me, it's a collaboration.

225
0:12:09.87,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Together, we can. (Applause)

226
0:12:14.155,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Thank you. (Applause)

1
0:00:12.764,000 --> 0:00:14,000
G'day, my name's Kevin.

2
0:00:14.923,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm from Australia. I'm here to help.

3
0:00:17.616,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:20.147,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Tonight, I want to talk about a tale of two cities.

5
0:00:24.814,000 --> 0:00:29,000
One of those cities is called Washington, and the other is called Beijing.

6
0:00:30.248,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Because how these two capitals shape their future

7
0:00:36.284,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and the future of the United States and the future of China

8
0:00:39.489,000 --> 0:00:41,000
doesn't just affect those two countries,

9
0:00:41.578,000 --> 0:00:43,000
it affects all of us

10
0:00:43.9,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in ways, perhaps, we've never thought of:

11
0:00:46.78,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the air we breathe, the water we drink,

12
0:00:51.145,000 --> 0:00:54,000
the fish we eat, the quality of our oceans,

13
0:00:54.279,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the languages we speak in the future,

14
0:00:57.948,000 --> 0:00:59,000
the jobs we have, the political systems we choose,

15
0:01:00.873,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and, of course, the great questions of war and peace.

16
0:01:06.024,000 --> 0:01:09,000
You see that bloke? He's French.

17
0:01:09.279,000 --> 0:01:1,000
His name is Napoleon.

18
0:01:11.109,000 --> 0:01:12,000
A couple of hundred years ago,

19
0:01:12.645,000 --> 0:01:14,000
he made this extraordinary projection:

20
0:01:15.083,000 --> 0:01:17,000
"China is a sleeping lion, and when she awakes,

21
0:01:17.707,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the world will shake."

22
0:01:19.913,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Napoleon got a few things wrong;

23
0:01:22.096,000 --> 0:01:24,000
he got this one absolutely right.

24
0:01:24.789,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Because China is today not just woken up,

25
0:01:29.061,000 --> 0:01:32,000
China has stood up and China is on the march,

26
0:01:32.521,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and the question for us all

27
0:01:34.541,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is where will China go

28
0:01:36.515,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and how do we engage this giant of the 21st century?

29
0:01:43.003,000 --> 0:01:47,000
You start looking at the numbers, they start to confront you in a big way.

30
0:01:47.381,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It's projected that China will become,

31
0:01:50.492,000 --> 0:01:53,000
by whichever measure -- PPP, market exchange rates --

32
0:01:53.906,000 --> 0:01:54,000
the largest economy in the world

33
0:01:55.833,000 --> 0:01:57,000
over the course of the decade ahead.

34
0:01:58.039,000 --> 0:02:,000
They're already the largest trading nation,

35
0:02:00.19,000 --> 0:02:02,000
already the largest exporting nation,

36
0:02:02.341,000 --> 0:02:04,000
already the largest manufacturing nation,

37
0:02:04.494,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and they're also the biggest emitters of carbon in the world.

38
0:02:08.859,000 --> 0:02:1,000
America comes second.

39
0:02:11.343,000 --> 0:02:16,000
So if China does become the world's largest economy,

40
0:02:16.869,000 --> 0:02:17,000
think about this:

41
0:02:18.495,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It'll be the first time

42
0:02:21.513,000 --> 0:02:25,000
since this guy was on the throne of England --

43
0:02:26.18,000 --> 0:02:29,000
George III, not a good friend of Napoleon's --

44
0:02:29.663,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that in the world we will have as the largest economy

45
0:02:35.102,000 --> 0:02:37,000
a non-English speaking country,

46
0:02:37.488,000 --> 0:02:39,000
a non-Western country,

47
0:02:39.694,000 --> 0:02:41,000
a non-liberal democratic country.

48
0:02:42.021,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And if you don't think that's going to affect

49
0:02:44.314,000 --> 0:02:46,000
the way in which the world happens in the future,

50
0:02:47.077,000 --> 0:02:5,000
then personally, I think you've been smoking something,

51
0:02:50.305,000 --> 0:02:54,000
and it doesn't mean you're from Colorado.

52
0:02:54.925,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So in short, the question we have tonight is,

53
0:02:57.711,000 --> 0:02:59,000
how do we understand this mega-change,

54
0:03:00.707,000 --> 0:03:04,000
which I believe to be the biggest change for the first half of the 21st century?

55
0:03:05.49,000 --> 0:03:07,000
It'll affect so many things.

56
0:03:08.415,000 --> 0:03:09,000
It will go to the absolute core.

57
0:03:10.157,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It's happening quietly. It's happening persistently.

58
0:03:12.804,000 --> 0:03:14,000
It's happening in some senses under the radar,

59
0:03:15.358,000 --> 0:03:16,000
as we are all preoccupied with

60
0:03:17.103,000 --> 0:03:19,000
what's going in Ukraine, what's going on in the Middle East,

61
0:03:19.932,000 --> 0:03:21,000
what's going on with ISIS, what's going on with ISIL,

62
0:03:22.44,000 --> 0:03:24,000
what's happening with the future of our economies.

63
0:03:25.412,000 --> 0:03:29,000
This is a slow and quiet revolution.

64
0:03:29.684,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And with a mega-change comes also a mega-challenge,

65
0:03:35.373,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and the mega-challenge is this:

66
0:03:37.044,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Can these two great countries,

67
0:03:39.297,000 --> 0:03:41,000
China and the United States --

68
0:03:41.897,000 --> 0:03:45,000
China,

69
0:03:47.725,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the Middle Kingdom,

70
0:03:49.374,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and the United States,

71
0:03:54.343,000 --> 0:03:57,000

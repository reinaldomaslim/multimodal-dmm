Greg Gage: We've all heard the annoying sound of a mosquito,

4
0:00:17.518,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and we will stop at nothing to make it go away.

5
0:00:19.764,000 --> 0:00:2,000
While this sound may be maddening to us,

6
0:00:21.693,000 --> 0:00:22,000
perhaps it's music to a mosquito's ears.

7
0:00:23.636,000 --> 0:00:27,000
The mosquito's nervous system has almost as many sensory auditory cells as we do.

8
0:00:28.37,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But why would they have so many in such a small body,

9
0:00:30.934,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and why would they need to be so sensitive to sounds?

10
0:00:33.505,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The answer is love.

13
0:00:39.635,000 --> 0:00:41,000
As humans, we do a lot to attract each other.

14
0:00:41.755,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Some things are conscious --

15
0:00:43.174,000 --> 0:00:45,000
we put on makeup and make sure we smell nice.

16
0:00:45.298,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And some are unconscious.

17
0:00:46.548,000 --> 0:00:49,000
You may unconsciously point your body or even sit closer to someone you like.

18
0:00:50.192,000 --> 0:00:53,000
These are courtship behaviors, and a lot of animals have them.

19
0:00:53.603,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And mosquitoes are no different.

20
0:00:55.229,000 --> 0:00:58,000
So Haley's been spending her summer bravely listening to mosquitoes,

21
0:00:58.547,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and what she observed may surprise you.

22
0:01:00.492,000 --> 0:01:03,000
So we want to investigate how the mosquitoes make their song.

23
0:01:03.947,000 --> 0:01:05,000
So Haley, how do we record their wing beats?

24
0:01:06.51,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Haley Smith: We need to tether them.

25
0:01:08.319,000 --> 0:01:12,000
First, we anesthetize them in a fridge or a bed of ice.

26
0:01:13.122,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And then I transfer them to this petri dish of ice,

27
0:01:16.599,000 --> 0:01:17,000
just to get them even more anesthetized.

28
0:01:18.529,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Next, I take an insect pin,

29
0:01:22.077,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and what I do is put a tiny little dab of superglue on this pin.

30
0:01:26.578,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I want to make sure that I get it on his thorax above his wings

31
0:01:30.342,000 --> 0:01:33,000
so that when he is suspended, his wings are still free to move.

32
0:01:33.819,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So here's one down.

33
0:01:35.002,000 --> 0:01:37,000
It's really hard to catch male mosquitoes in the wild

34
0:01:37.551,000 --> 0:01:41,000
because females are the only mosquitoes that are attracted to humans.

35
0:01:41.828,000 --> 0:01:42,000
They feed on human blood.

36
0:01:43.448,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And now, we can try to get some recordings from them.

37
0:01:48.793,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So this is the stand that I use to hold them.

38
0:01:51.114,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I like to place it right over the microphone

39
0:01:53.293,000 --> 0:01:55,000
so that I can get a recording of the buzzing that you hear.

40
0:01:56.108,000 --> 0:01:59,000
That sound is generated by how fast they're beating their wings.

41
0:01:59.133,000 --> 0:02:,000
This is a male.

42
0:02:00.395,000 --> 0:02:03,000
The males have very bushy antennae, and they look kind of feathery.

43
0:02:04.095,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And they are also much smaller.

44
0:02:06.635,000 --> 0:02:09,000
GG: So he's flying at around 600 hertz.

45
0:02:09.923,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Can we try a female mosquito?

46
0:02:12.424,000 --> 0:02:14,000
HS: Sure, here we go.

47
0:02:14.478,000 --> 0:02:19,000
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch)

48
0:02:20.153,000 --> 0:02:21,000
GG: Wow.

49
0:02:21.423,000 --> 0:02:23,000
HS: This is a much lower frequency than the male.

50
0:02:23.983,000 --> 0:02:25,000
GG: Yeah, it sounds completely different.

51
0:02:26.142,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Mosquito buzzing)

52
0:02:28.023,000 --> 0:02:3,000
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch)

53
0:02:30.523,000 --> 0:02:32,000
So is it because they're two different mosquitoes,

54
0:02:32.911,000 --> 0:02:33,000
or because they're male and female?

55
0:02:34.616,000 --> 0:02:35,000
HS: It's because they're male and female.

56
0:02:36.557,000 --> 0:02:37,000
GG: Alright, let's verify that.

57
0:02:38.222,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Can you bring in another female and see if she sounds

58
0:02:40.833,000 --> 0:02:41,000
like mosquito A or mosquito B?

59
0:02:42.731,000 --> 0:02:43,000
HS: Yeah.

60
0:02:43.906,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch)

61
0:02:45.683,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And again, she is much lower than the male.

62
0:02:47.779,000 --> 0:02:48,000
GG: Yeah, she sounds different.

63
0:02:49.5,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Mosquito buzzing, lower pitch)

64
0:02:55.174,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Yeah, she's spot-on 400.

65
0:02:56.7,000 --> 0:02:58,000
HS: She really is. GG: That's really bizarre.

66
0:02:58.858,000 --> 0:03:01,000
HS: The females are at a much lower pitch. They were around 400 hertz.

67
0:03:02.621,000 --> 0:03:04,000
HS: And all of the females were around that, too.

68
0:03:04.938,000 --> 0:03:05,000
They were much larger than the males,

69
0:03:06.771,000 --> 0:03:09,000
so they didn't have to flap their wings as fast to stay in free flight.

70
0:03:10.242,000 --> 0:03:12,000
GG: So they have larger wings, so they're flapping slower.

71
0:03:13.259,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And you noticed that all the females have the same frequency, roughly?

72
0:03:16.608,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And the males do, too. That's kind of interesting.

73
0:03:19.045,000 --> 0:03:2,000
So that must mean something.

74
0:03:20.589,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Well, let's see what happens when we put the male and the female together.

75
0:03:24.155,000 --> 0:03:27,000
(Mosquitoes buzzing; pitch varies)

76
0:03:28.176,000 --> 0:03:3,000
HS: When I put them into the same hearing range,

77
0:03:30.535,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I noticed that they were kind of changing their tones.

78
0:03:33.343,000 --> 0:03:35,000
It was kind of more dull, almost.

79
0:03:35.629,000 --> 0:03:36,000
(Mosquitoes buzzing)

80
0:03:37.23,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And when I put it back in my spectrogram to see their interaction,

81
0:03:40.993,000 --> 0:03:42,000
they were meeting at the same tone.

82
0:03:43.342,000 --> 0:03:44,000
GG: OK, pause.

83
0:03:44.827,000 --> 0:03:46,000
The males and females are singing a duet,

84
0:03:47.144,000 --> 0:03:5,000
meaning that they adjust their wings to be able to produce a common tone.

85
0:03:50.598,000 --> 0:03:52,000
You have the male singing up here at G,

86
0:03:53.296,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and you have the female singing down here at D,

87
0:03:56.173,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and when they get together,

88
0:03:57.485,000 --> 0:04:,000
you're saying that they change the frequency of their wings

89
0:04:00.722,000 --> 0:04:01,000
such that they come together?

90
0:04:02.209,000 --> 0:04:04,000
HS: Yeah, exactly. GG: And they sort of sing a duet.

91
0:04:04.672,000 --> 0:04:09,000
(Mosquitoes gradually adjusting to identical pitch)

92
0:04:09.799,000 --> 0:04:11,000
HS: They're communicating to let each other know

93
0:04:12.14,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that they've basically found a potential mate.

94
0:04:14.322,000 --> 0:04:15,000
GG: So in other words,

95
0:04:15.496,000 --> 0:04:17,000
the female tends to choose a male that best sings her duet.

96
0:04:18.516,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And studies have found that if she's pregnant,

97
0:04:20.683,000 --> 0:04:21,000
she doesn't even bother.

98
0:04:22.661,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So if we can understand the mosquito mating behavior,

99
0:04:25.368,000 --> 0:04:29,000
we may be able to disrupt it in the wild and prevent diseases like malaria.

100
0:04:29.469,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But for now, the next time you hear a mosquito buzzing,

101
0:04:33.373,000 --> 0:04:36,000
just pause and remember she may be in love

102
0:04:36.668,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and she may be singing her song,

103
0:04:38.246,000 --> 0:04:39,000
looking for her perfect match.

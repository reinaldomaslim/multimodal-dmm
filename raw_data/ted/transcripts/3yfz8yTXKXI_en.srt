1
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Welcome to Africa! Or rather, I should say, welcome home.

2
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Because this is where it all really began, isn't it?

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Looking at fossils dating back several millions of years --

4
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:38,000
it all points to evidence that life

5
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:44,000
for the human species as we know it began right here.

6
0:00:44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
We are on an amazing journey the next four days.

7
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:52,000
You're going to hear stories of "Africa: The Next Chapter."

8
0:00:52,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Fantastic tales, anecdotes from speakers.

9
0:00:54,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But I want to turn that upside down for a moment,

10
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say.

11
0:01:03,000 --> 0:01:06,000
What's the worst thing you've ever heard about Africa?

12
0:01:06,000 --> 0:01:07,000
And this is not a rhetorical question.

13
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
I actually want answers from you.

14
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Go for it! The worst.

15
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Famine.

16
0:01:15,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Corruption.

17
0:01:17,000 --> 0:01:19,000
More.

18
0:01:19,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Genocide.

19
0:01:21,000 --> 0:01:24,000
AIDS.

20
0:01:24,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Slavery.

21
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:3,000
That's enough.

22
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:32,000
We've all heard these things.

23
0:01:32,000 --> 0:01:36,000
But this is about Africa, the story we have not heard.

24
0:01:36,000 --> 0:01:38,000
The stories that we want to know,

25
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:42,000
and the stories that do exist about positive tales.

26
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:46,000
A part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities

27
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that exist on this continent,

28
0:01:48,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to separate the rhetoric from the reality, the fact from the fiction.

29
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
To go to the actual data and statistics that exist

30
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:58,000
about the actual things that are happening on the ground

31
0:01:58,000 --> 0:02:05,000
that make Africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you.

32
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So let's get going because Africa,

33
0:02:06,000 --> 0:02:1,000
to some degree, is on a turnaround.

34
0:02:1,000 --> 0:02:14,000
A turnaround in terms of how it manages its image,

35
0:02:14,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and how it takes control of its own destiny.

36
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And turnarounds are part and parcel

37
0:02:19,000 --> 0:02:23,000
of what I have focused on for most of my professional career.

38
0:02:23,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And it all started almost a decade ago,

39
0:02:26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
as a young consultant at McKinsey & Company

40
0:02:28,000 --> 0:02:31,000
at their first African office in Johannesburg.

41
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And there we worked with leading CEOs

42
0:02:34,000 --> 0:02:37,000
on African issues, and African companies on turnarounds,

43
0:02:37,000 --> 0:02:4,000
making the companies not just the best in Africa

44
0:02:4,000 --> 0:02:42,000
but the best globally.

45
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But I really formalized this focus on turnarounds

46
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
when I was completing my MBA in the United States.

47
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It all began with a fantastic phone call.

48
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
It was from Rosabeth Moss Kanter,

49
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Harvard Business School guru and a professor of mine.

50
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And she said, "I want to write a case, Euvin --

51
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:01,000
a case on a public-sector leader

52
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that has lessons for the corporate world."

53
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:09,000
And the leader that came to mind was Nelson Mandela.

54
0:03:09,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Because Nelson Mandela, as he took over power

55
0:03:12,000 --> 0:03:15,000
as the first democratically-elected president of South Africa,

56
0:03:15,000 --> 0:03:17,000
faced a situation of a country

57
0:03:17,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that could have slid into the abyss of chaos.

58
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:24,000
But he started the country on a path of a positive cycle.

59
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:27,000
Now the case, "Nelson Mandela: Change Leader,"

60
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
became part of the research base for a chapter

61
0:03:3,000 --> 0:03:34,000
in Rosabeth's new book called "Confidence."

62
0:03:34,000 --> 0:03:38,000
And "Confidence" became a New York Times bestseller

63
0:03:38,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and topped Business Week's hardcover bestseller list.

64
0:03:41,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And why I tell you this story is because later, when I was interviewed

65
0:03:44,000 --> 0:03:47,000
on SABC Africa, on a pan-African broadcast, they asked,

66
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"What is your key lesson, or the key thing you enjoy the most?" --

67
0:03:51,000 --> 0:03:54,000
because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project.

68
0:03:54,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The lesson from that was that it was Africa -- an African story --

69
0:03:59,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that was used to share news with the rest of the world

70
0:04:03,000 --> 0:04:06,000
of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds.

71
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Africa was being used as a success story!

72
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So I want to share with you a personal story

73
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,000
about a turnaround or a transformation.

74
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And that has to do with me

75
0:04:17,000 --> 0:04:21,000
because in 1994, I packed a few things into a backpack

76
0:04:21,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and headed off for a year of travel

77
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in the middle of my university career.

78
0:04:26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
You should have seen my parents' reaction!

79
0:04:28,000 --> 0:04:29,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:33,000
But very soon, I found myself from the southern part of Africa,

81
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
in South Africa -- at the very north, in Egypt.

82
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I sought out the most remote places.

83
0:04:38,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I went to the Siwa Oasis. That was one of my stops.

84
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
And the Siwa Oasis is famous for several things,

85
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:45,000
but the key thing is that it was the place

86
0:04:45,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that Alexander the Great went to

87
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:51,000
when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him.

88
0:04:51,000 --> 0:04:54,000
And legend has it that Alexander trekked through this desert.

89
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm.

90
0:04:57,000 --> 0:05:,000
And myth says that he had an audience with the oracle,

91
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and it foretold his destiny of greatness.

92
0:05:03,000 --> 0:05:05,000
This was 300 BC.

93
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So Africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers.

94
0:05:11,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Now, the thing I remember about Siwa

95
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
was the magical view of the sky at night.

96
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:2,000
With no natural light source, Siva is one of these amazing places

97
0:05:2,000 --> 0:05:24,000
that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry.

98
0:05:24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Fast forward to 2002.

99
0:05:26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I'm sitting in Cambridge, Massachusetts

100
0:05:28,000 --> 0:05:3,000
at the Healthcare Development Conference.

101
0:05:3,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And I see the same picture, but from the opposite side.

102
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
A satellite picture looking down at the earth.

103
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me

104
0:05:41,000 --> 0:05:44,000
because I'll never forget it. I remember the very moment.

105
0:05:44,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And I wanted to share that image with you of what I saw at that point.

106
0:05:5,000 --> 0:05:55,000
The first thing that I saw was North America at night --

107
0:05:55,000 --> 0:06:05,000
glowing, in all its glory. A warm feeling. Light.

108
0:06:05,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And then I saw it -- Africa. Quite literally the "Dark Continent."

109
0:06:15,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And while Africa may be dark,

110
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the thing that brought the message home to me

111
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
was that this is the challenge we are facing,

112
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:26,000
but it's also the opportunity.

113
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Because whilst Africa may be dark -- other than the few specks

114
0:06:29,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that exist north and in the south and other areas --

115
0:06:33,000 --> 0:06:35,000
it's aglow with the light in the hearts

116
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
of the millions of people that are there.

117
0:06:37,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Entrepreneurs, dynamic people, people with hope.

118
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It was George Kimble, the geographer, who said

119
0:06:44,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that, "The only thing dark about Africa is our ignorance of it."

120
0:06:49,000 --> 0:06:53,000
So let's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent

121
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
that has so much to offer.

122
0:06:55,000 --> 0:07:,000
Let's start unpacking it.

123
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Africa is the second-largest continent, a landmass second from Asia.

124
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:09,000
It also is the second most populated continent,

125
0:07:09,000 --> 0:07:11,000
with 900 million people.

126
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
In fact -- coming back to the land mass -- Africa is so big

127
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that you could fit in the continental United States,

128
0:07:17,000 --> 0:07:22,000
China, and the entire Europe into Africa, and still have space.

129
0:07:22,000 --> 0:07:25,000
Africa is home to over 1,000 languages --

130
0:07:25,000 --> 0:07:28,000
2,000 is another estimate that's out there --

131
0:07:28,000 --> 0:07:31,000
with over 2,000 languages and dialects.

132
0:07:31,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But you could say, "Invest in Africa in over 1,000 languages,

133
0:07:35,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and it wouldn't make a difference."

134
0:07:38,000 --> 0:07:4,000
What does the data say?

135
0:07:4,000 --> 0:07:44,000
As an investment banker, I'm in the cross-flow of information

136
0:07:44,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and the changes that are taking place in capital markets.

137
0:07:47,000 --> 0:07:5,000
So I want to share with you some of these bellwether signals, or signs,

138
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and winds of change that are sweeping this continent.

139
0:07:52,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So let's start on that.

140
0:07:54,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And let's start at the high level, on the macro-factors.

141
0:07:56,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Inflation, in general, is coming down across Africa --

142
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that's the first sign --

143
0:08:01,000 --> 0:08:03,000
in many countries reaching double-digit figures.

144
0:08:03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
So let's start looking at some of those.

145
0:08:05,000 --> 0:08:07,000
I call it my Z.E.N. cluster.

146
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Zambia: from 2004 to 2006, moves from the 18 percent in inflation

147
0:08:12,000 --> 0:08:14,000
to the nine percent.

148
0:08:14,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Egypt: from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent.

149
0:08:19,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Nigeria: a similar situation,

150
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:27,000
from the 16 percent to the eight percent. Single digits.

151
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:31,000
More fascinating, you have other countries -- South Africa,

152
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Mauritius, Namibia -- all in single digits.

153
0:08:38,000 --> 0:08:41,000
But that's just part of the story. You have a similar trend with currencies --

154
0:08:41,000 --> 0:08:47,000
currencies going through an extreme time of stability.

155
0:08:47,000 --> 0:08:49,000
But that's looking at the big picture.

156
0:08:49,000 --> 0:08:55,000
And the first myth to dispel is that Africa is not a country.

157
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:57,000
It's made up --

158
0:08:57,000 --> 0:08:58,000
(Applause)

159
0:08:58,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's made up of 53 different countries.

160
0:09:02,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So the very definition -- to say "invest in Africa" is a no-go.

161
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
It's meaningless.

162
0:09:08,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Each country has a unique value proposition.

163
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:14,000
You can make money, you can lose money in Africa.

164
0:09:14,000 --> 0:09:17,000
But opportunities, boy oh boy, they exist.

165
0:09:17,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And this is what today is about --

166
0:09:2,000 --> 0:09:24,000
it's about discussing those very opportunities.

167
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:26,000
So let's start getting into the countries

168
0:09:26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and into the specific material and data.

169
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:33,000
I was recently elected, as Emeka mentioned,

170
0:09:33,000 --> 0:09:36,000
as the President of the South African Chamber of Commerce in America.

171
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And I'm very proud and happy to be in that role

172
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:41,000
because it is a fascinating position to be in.

173
0:09:41,000 --> 0:09:45,000
To hear this dialogue that's just increasing in tenor and velocity,

174
0:09:45,000 --> 0:09:49,000
of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come.

175
0:09:49,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So the first port of call: let's talk a little bit about South Africa.

176
0:09:51,000 --> 0:09:53,000
But not the South Africa we always talk about --

177
0:09:53,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the gold, the minerals, the First World infrastructure --

178
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
a bit about the other side of it.

179
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:02,000
For example, South Africa was recently voted as the top destination

180
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:06,000
for the top 1,000 UK companies for offshore call-centers.

181
0:10:06,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Same language, timeline, et cetera. Makes sense.

182
0:10:11,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Other headlines that have recently reached South Africa

183
0:10:13,000 --> 0:10:18,000
were Bain Capital and KKR, the big boys of private equity.

184
0:10:18,000 --> 0:10:21,000
Headline in South Africa: "They have landed." Quite ominous.

185
0:10:21,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But what were they there for? To acquire assets.

186
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Bing Capital's acquisition of Edcon, a large retailer, is testimony

187
0:10:32,000 --> 0:10:35,000
to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy.

188
0:10:35,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Because it is actually a long-term play.

189
0:10:37,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Being a retailer, it is a play on the belief

190
0:10:39,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that this middle-class that's growing will continue to grow,

191
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue.

192
0:10:49,000 --> 0:10:54,000
But the story of Africa, and my focus, is beyond South Africa

193
0:10:54,000 --> 0:10:56,000
because there's so much happening.

194
0:10:56,000 --> 0:11:,000
Undoubtedly, Nigeria is clearly a hot spot.

195
0:11:,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Challenges -- and we will hear a lot about Nigeria in these four days.

196
0:11:04,000 --> 0:11:09,000
But looking at Goldman Sachs' work -- we had the famous BRIC Report.

197
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:13,000
The new report, "The Next Eleven," highlights that by 2020

198
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world.

199
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:21,000
It's an investment opportunity. Think about that.

200
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Is anyone -- our banks, our investors --

201
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:25,000
seriously thinking about going to Nigeria?

202
0:11:25,000 --> 0:11:27,000
If you haven't, why not?

203
0:11:27,000 --> 0:11:31,000
What's going on in Nigeria? A couple of things.

204
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets.

205
0:11:35,000 --> 0:11:38,000
Bellwether signs again.

206
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Guarantee Trust Bank recently issued the first Euro Bond

207
0:11:42,000 --> 0:11:45,000
out of Africa, and this excludes South Africa.

208
0:11:45,000 --> 0:11:48,000
But the first Eurobond, the raising of international capital

209
0:11:48,000 --> 0:11:51,000
offshore, off its own balance sheet,

210
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:53,000
without any sovereign backing --

211
0:11:53,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy.

212
0:11:57,000 --> 0:11:59,000
Without any sovereign backing,

213
0:11:59,000 --> 0:12:01,000
a Nigerian company raising capital offshore.

214
0:12:01,000 --> 0:12:02,000
It's just a sign of things to come.

215
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:07,000
Looking at the oil industry, Africa provides 18 percent

216
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:11,000
of the U.S.'s oil supply, with the Middle East just 16 percent.

217
0:12:11,000 --> 0:12:13,000
It's an important strategic partner.

218
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Let's put Nigeria in perspective.

219
0:12:15,000 --> 0:12:18,000
2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day --

220
0:12:18,000 --> 0:12:23,000
the same league as Kuwait, the same league as Venezuela.

221
0:12:23,000 --> 0:12:26,000
But with Africa, let's start being careful about this.

222
0:12:26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And Emeka and I have had these discussions.

223
0:12:28,000 --> 0:12:32,000
We have to move away from what's called "the curse of the commodities."

224
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Because it's not about oil, it's not about commodities.

225
0:12:34,000 --> 0:12:36,000
For Africa to truly be sustainable,

226
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:39,000
we have to move beyond to other industries.

227
0:12:39,000 --> 0:12:41,000
So let's unpack those very quickly,

228
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and I'm going to move through these very, very, very fast

229
0:12:43,000 --> 0:12:47,000
because I can see that clock counting down.

230
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:5,000
What else is going on there? Egypt.

231
0:12:5,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Egypt is launching a first large industrial zone --

232
0:12:53,000 --> 0:12:55,000
2.8 billion investment.

233
0:12:55,000 --> 0:12:57,000
The announcement just came out the last few weeks.

234
0:12:57,000 --> 0:13:01,000
Close to the Mediterranean, near Alexandria --

235
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:03,000
textiles, petrochemicals.

236
0:13:03,000 --> 0:13:07,000
It's being managed by a Singaporean-based management company.

237
0:13:07,000 --> 0:13:1,000
So they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse

238
0:13:1,000 --> 0:13:12,000
across the industries -- away from oil.

239
0:13:12,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Let's look at agriculture. Let's look at forestry.

240
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:16,000
What's going on there?

241
0:13:16,000 --> 0:13:2,000
In Tanzania last week, we had the launch

242
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:24,000
of the East African Organic Produce Standard.

243
0:13:24,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Again, gathering together farmers, gathering together stakeholders

244
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:36,000
in East Africa to get standards for organic produce. Better prices.

245
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:39,000
It ties in with small-scale farmers

246
0:13:39,000 --> 0:13:44,000
in terms of no pesticides, no fertilizers.

247
0:13:44,000 --> 0:13:49,000
Again, opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price.

248
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
Uganda: the New Forest Company,

249
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:57,000
replanting and redeveloping their forests. Why is that important?

250
0:13:57,000 --> 0:14:,000
As the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [we will need]

251
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
poles for rolling out electricity.

252
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:04,000
But here is the sweetener in the deal.

253
0:14:04,000 --> 0:14:08,000
They're going to be tapping into carbon credits.

254
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Let's go back to Nigeria.

255
0:14:1,000 --> 0:14:13,000
The banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation,

256
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:18,000
from over 80 banks to 25 banks. Strengthening of the system.

257
0:14:18,000 --> 0:14:23,000
But what's going on there? Only 10 percent of the country is banked.

258
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:26,000
The largest population in Africa is in Nigeria.

259
0:14:26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
135 million-plus people. Think about that.

260
0:14:3,000 --> 0:14:35,000
There are only 700 ATMs in the country. Opportunity.

261
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:38,000
The same for telecoms across the country.

262
0:14:38,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Now let's look at the continent as a whole.

263
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:42,000
People look at the roads, for example, and they'd say,

264
0:14:42,000 --> 0:14:49,000
"Angola: 90 percent of roads are untarred. Ah, problem!"

265
0:14:49,000 --> 0:14:52,000
It's more expensive to transport goods. Prices of goods go up,

266
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:54,000
inflation is affected.

267
0:14:54,000 --> 0:14:57,000
Nigeria: 70 percent of roads are untarred. Zambia: 80 percent.

268
0:14:57,000 --> 0:15:,000
In general, more than 50 percent of roads are untarred.

269
0:15:,000 --> 0:15:05,000
This is an opportunity! Energy needs -- it's an opportunity.

270
0:15:05,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing?

271
0:15:08,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Let's look at the stock markets in Africa.

272
0:15:11,000 --> 0:15:15,000
If I had to ask you, "In 2005 what was the best performing stock market

273
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:2,000
or stock exchange in the world?" Would Egypt come to mind?

274
0:15:2,000 --> 0:15:28,000
In 2005, the Egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent.

275
0:15:28,000 --> 0:15:3,000
What's going on in some of the other countries?

276
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Let's look at some 2006 numbers. Kenya: over 60 percent. Nigeria: over 40 percent.

277
0:15:37,000 --> 0:15:4,000
South Africa: in the 20 percents. High ones.

278
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:46,000
These are the trends that are taking place.

279
0:15:46,000 --> 0:15:5,000
But in any investment decision, the key question is,

280
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:53,000
"What is my alternative investment?"

281
0:15:53,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Because in Africa today, we are competing globally for capital.

282
0:15:57,000 --> 0:16:02,000
And global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties.

283
0:16:02,000 --> 0:16:06,000
There's an overhang of capital in the U.S., and the key is yield pickup.

284
0:16:06,000 --> 0:16:09,000
What Africa is providing is a diversification play,

285
0:16:09,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor

286
0:16:11,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that's aware of what he or she is doing.

287
0:16:15,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Now, when looking at Africa vis-a-vis other things,

288
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and countries in Africa vis-a-vis other things,

289
0:16:19,000 --> 0:16:21,000
comparisons become important.

290
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:24,000
10 years ago there, were very few countries

291
0:16:24,000 --> 0:16:25,000
that received sovereign ratings from

292
0:16:25,000 --> 0:16:28,000
the Standard & Poors, Moody's and Fitch's.

293
0:16:28,000 --> 0:16:32,000
Today, 16 African countries and growing

294
0:16:32,000 --> 0:16:35,000
have sovereign country ratings. What does this mean?

295
0:16:35,000 --> 0:16:38,000
Take Nigeria again: double B-minus --

296
0:16:38,000 --> 0:16:43,000
in the league of Ukraine and Turkey. Immediately we have a comparison.

297
0:16:43,000 --> 0:16:46,000
The backbone of making investment decisions

298
0:16:46,000 --> 0:16:48,000
for global holders of capital.

299
0:16:48,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Some other figures. South Africa: triple B-plus. Botswana: A-plus.

300
0:16:55,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Bakino Faso: B-minus. And so on.

301
0:16:58,000 --> 0:17:03,000
In fact, one of the big agencies is setting up an office in Africa.

302
0:17:03,000 --> 0:17:09,000
Why are they doing that? Because they expect investment to follow.

303
0:17:09,000 --> 0:17:11,000
So one of the big bellwethers,

304
0:17:11,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and one of my final points I want to mention, is

305
0:17:14,000 --> 0:17:16,000
the interesting thing I read is that CNBC

306
0:17:16,000 --> 0:17:21,000
has launched their first African channel. Why is CNBC doing this?

307
0:17:21,000 --> 0:17:25,000
It's the 24-hour rolling African news channel.

308
0:17:25,000 --> 0:17:28,000
They're doing it because they are expecting things to happen.

309
0:17:28,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Me and you, the investments we are going to be making,

310
0:17:32,000 --> 0:17:33,000
the investments the world is going to be making --

311
0:17:33,000 --> 0:17:37,000
that's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to Africa.

312
0:17:37,000 --> 0:17:42,000
So that's the change that's coming down the pipeline.

313
0:17:42,000 --> 0:17:47,000
So in conclusion, I want to turn back to that very slide

314
0:17:47,000 --> 0:17:52,000
that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago.

315
0:17:52,000 --> 0:17:58,000
This time [I'll] give you the entire picture that I saw in 2002,

316
0:17:58,000 --> 0:18:03,000
and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in Africa,

317
0:18:03,000 --> 0:18:07,000
think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent.

318
0:18:07,000 --> 0:18:1,000
Because there are amazing opportunities available.

319
0:18:1,000 --> 0:18:12,000
And think about the concept of transformation

320
0:18:12,000 --> 0:18:14,000
in the back of your mind

321
0:18:14,000 --> 0:18:18,000
because things can be turned around rather quickly.

322
0:18:18,000 --> 0:18:25,000
In 1899, Joseph Conrad released "The Heart of Darkness,"

323
0:18:25,000 --> 0:18:32,000
a tale of grim horror along the Congo River.

324
0:18:32,000 --> 0:18:37,000
If one looks carefully, on the Congo River

325
0:18:37,000 --> 0:18:41,000
is one of those bright lights. And that's the very Congo river

326
0:18:41,000 --> 0:18:44,000
generating light -- the old heart of darkness

327
0:18:44,000 --> 0:18:47,000
now generating light with hydro-electric power.

328
0:18:47,000 --> 0:18:5,000
That is a transformation in power of ideas.

329
0:18:5,000 --> 0:18:52,000
So the next step, over the next four days,

330
0:18:52,000 --> 0:18:55,000
is us exploring more of these ideas.

331
0:18:55,000 --> 0:18:58,000
And perchance, if you can always keep this picture in your mind,

332
0:18:58,000 --> 0:19:03,000
that when we convene maybe in the distant future, in 2020,

333
0:19:03,000 --> 0:19:05,000
that picture will look very different.

334
0:19:05,000 --> 0:19:07,000
Thank you.

335
0:19:07,000 --> 0:19:09,000
(Applause)

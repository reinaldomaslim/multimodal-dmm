0:00:12.493,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When the Industrial Revolution started,

3
0:00:15.015,000 --> 0:00:19,000
the amount of carbon sitting underneath Britain in the form of coal

4
0:00:19.908,000 --> 0:00:22,000
was as big as the amount of carbon sitting under Saudi Arabia

5
0:00:23.107,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in the form of oil.

6
0:00:25.431,000 --> 0:00:27,000
This carbon powered the Industrial Revolution,

7
0:00:27.99,000 --> 0:00:28,000
it put the "Great" in Great Britain,

8
0:00:29.729,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and led to Britain's temporary world domination.

9
0:00:34.085,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And then, in 1918, coal production in Britain peaked,

10
0:00:38.53,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and has declined ever since.

11
0:00:41.003,000 --> 0:00:45,000
In due course, Britain started using oil and gas from the North Sea,

12
0:00:45.08,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and in the year 2000,

13
0:00:47.015,000 --> 0:00:5,000
oil and gas production from the North Sea also peaked,

14
0:00:50.538,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and they're now on the decline.

15
0:00:54.136,000 --> 0:00:56,000
These observations about the finiteness

16
0:00:56.823,000 --> 0:00:59,000
of easily accessible, local, secure fossil fuels,

17
0:01:01.427,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is a motivation for saying, "Well, what's next?

18
0:01:04.738,000 --> 0:01:06,000
What is life after fossil fuels going to be like?

19
0:01:07.348,000 --> 0:01:1,000
Shouldn't we be thinking hard about how to get off fossil fuels?"

20
0:01:10.838,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Another motivation, of course, is climate change.

21
0:01:14.314,000 --> 0:01:16,000
And when people talk about life after fossil fuels

22
0:01:16.839,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and climate change action,

23
0:01:18.85,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I think there's a lot of fluff,

24
0:01:21.304,000 --> 0:01:23,000
a lot of greenwash, a lot of misleading advertising,

25
0:01:24.192,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and I feel a duty as a physicist to try to guide people around the claptrap

26
0:01:28.705,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and help people understand the actions that really make a difference,

27
0:01:32.503,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and to focus on ideas that do add up.

28
0:01:37.01,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Let me illustrate this

29
0:01:38.613,000 --> 0:01:41,000
with what physicists call a back-of-envelope calculation.

30
0:01:42.228,000 --> 0:01:43,000
We love back-of-envelope calculations.

31
0:01:44.097,000 --> 0:01:46,000
You ask a question, write down some numbers,

32
0:01:46.192,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and get an answer.

33
0:01:47.379,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It may not be very accurate, but it may make you say, "Hmm."

34
0:01:50.603,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So here's a question:

35
0:01:52.049,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Imagine if we said, "Oh yes, we can get off fossil fuels.

36
0:01:55.276,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We'll use biofuels. Problem solved.

37
0:01:56.968,000 --> 0:01:58,000
Transport ... We don't need oil anymore."

38
0:01:59.272,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Well, what if we grew the biofuels for a road

39
0:02:05.73,000 --> 0:02:07,000
on the grass verge at the edge of the road?

40
0:02:09.274,000 --> 0:02:13,000
How wide would the verge have to be for that to work out?

41
0:02:13.511,000 --> 0:02:14,000
OK, so let's put in some numbers.

42
0:02:15.183,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Let's have our cars go at 60 miles per hour.

43
0:02:17.917,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Let's say they do 30 miles per gallon.

44
0:02:19.751,000 --> 0:02:21,000
That's the European average for new cars.

45
0:02:22.939,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Let's say the productivity of biofuel plantations

46
0:02:25.287,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is 1,200 liters of biofuel per hectare per year.

47
0:02:28.411,000 --> 0:02:3,000
That's true of European biofuels.

48
0:02:31.351,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And let's imagine the cars are spaced 80 meters apart from each other,

49
0:02:34.915,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and they're perpetually going along this road.

50
0:02:37.115,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The length of the road doesn't matter,

51
0:02:38.979,000 --> 0:02:4,000
because the longer the road, the more biofuel plantation.

52
0:02:41.734,000 --> 0:02:42,000
What do we do with these numbers?

53
0:02:43.346,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Take the first number, divide by the other three, and get eight kilometers.

54
0:02:47.399,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And that's the answer.

55
0:02:48.579,000 --> 0:02:5,000
That's how wide the plantation would have to be,

56
0:02:50.963,000 --> 0:02:51,000
given these assumptions.

57
0:02:53.296,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And maybe that makes you say, "Hmm.

58
0:02:56.053,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Maybe this isn't going to be quite so easy."

59
0:03:00.23,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And it might make you think,

60
0:03:02.862,000 --> 0:03:04,000
perhaps there's an issue to do with areas.

61
0:03:05.291,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And in this talk, I'd like to talk about land areas, and ask:

62
0:03:09.212,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Is there an issue about areas?

63
0:03:10.719,000 --> 0:03:14,000
The answer is going to be yes, but it depends which country you are in.

64
0:03:15.403,000 --> 0:03:17,000
So let's start in the United Kingdom,

65
0:03:17.465,000 --> 0:03:19,000
since that's where we are today.

66
0:03:19.781,000 --> 0:03:21,000
The energy consumption of the United Kingdom,

67
0:03:22.15,000 --> 0:03:25,000
the total energy consumption -- not just transport, but everything --

68
0:03:26.558,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I like to quantify it in lightbulbs.

69
0:03:28.388,000 --> 0:03:31,000
It's as if we've all got 125 lightbulbs on all the time,

70
0:03:31.894,000 --> 0:03:34,000
125 kilowatt-hours per day per person

71
0:03:35.594,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is the energy consumption of the UK.

72
0:03:38.688,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So there's 40 lightbulbs' worth for transport,

73
0:03:41.478,000 --> 0:03:42,000
40 lightbulbs' worth for heating,

74
0:03:43.154,000 --> 0:03:45,000
and 40 lightbulbs' worth for making electricity,

75
0:03:45.706,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and other things are relatively small,

76
0:03:47.644,000 --> 0:03:49,000
compared to those three big fish.

77
0:03:50.301,000 --> 0:03:52,000
It's actually a bigger footprint if we take into account

78
0:03:53.055,000 --> 0:03:56,000
the embodied energy in the stuff we import into our country as well.

79
0:03:56.701,000 --> 0:04:,000
And 90 percent of this energy, today, still comes from fossil fuels,

80
0:04:01.459,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and 10 percent, only, from other, greener -- possibly greener -- sources,

81
0:04:05.161,000 --> 0:04:06,000
like nuclear power and renewables.

82
0:04:08.233,000 --> 0:04:09,000
So.

83
0:04:09.542,000 --> 0:04:1,000
That's the UK.

84
0:04:10.823,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The population density of the UK is 250 people per square kilometer.

85
0:04:16.068,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I'm now going to show you other countries by these same two measures.

86
0:04:19.354,000 --> 0:04:22,000
On the vertical axis, I'm going to show you how many lightbulbs --

87
0:04:22.514,000 --> 0:04:24,000
what our energy consumption per person is.

88
0:04:24.978,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We're at 125 lightbulbs per person,

89
0:04:27.121,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and that little blue dot there is showing you the land area

90
0:04:30.759,000 --> 0:04:31,000
of the United Kingdom.

91
0:04:32.473,000 --> 0:04:34,000
The population density is on the horizontal axis,

92
0:04:35.286,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and we're 250 people per square kilometer.

93
0:04:38.033,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Let's add European countries in blue,

94
0:04:40.626,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and you can see there's quite a variety.

95
0:04:43.151,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I should emphasize, both of these axes are logarithmic;

96
0:04:46.252,000 --> 0:04:48,000
as you go from one gray bar to the next gray bar,

97
0:04:48.831,000 --> 0:04:49,000
you're going up a factor of 10.

98
0:04:51.547,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Next, let's add Asia in red,

99
0:04:53.912,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the Middle East and North Africa in green,

100
0:04:57.413,000 --> 0:04:59,000
sub-Saharan Africa in blue,

101
0:05:00.925,000 --> 0:05:01,000
black is South America,

102
0:05:04.394,000 --> 0:05:05,000
purple is Central America,

103
0:05:06.985,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and then in pukey-yellow, we have North America,

104
0:05:09.812,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Australia and New Zealand.

105
0:05:12.45,000 --> 0:05:14,000
You can see the great diversity of population densities

106
0:05:15.374,000 --> 0:05:17,000
and of per capita consumptions.

107
0:05:18.317,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Countries are different from each other.

108
0:05:20.58,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Top left, we have Canada and Australia, with enormous land areas,

109
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
very high per capita consumption -- 200 or 300 lightbulbs per person --

110
0:05:28.672,000 --> 0:05:3,000
and very low population densities.

111
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Top right: Bahrain has the same energy consumption

112
0:05:35.516,000 --> 0:05:36,000
per person, roughly, as Canada --

113
0:05:37.523,000 --> 0:05:39,000
over 300 lightbulbs per person,

114
0:05:39.789,000 --> 0:05:42,000
but their population density is a factor of 300 times greater,

115
0:05:42.835,000 --> 0:05:43,000
1,000 people per square kilometer.

116
0:05:44.688,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Bottom right: Bangladesh has the same population density as Bahrain,

117
0:05:49.589,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but consumes 100 times less per person.

118
0:05:53.179,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Bottom left: well, there's no one.

119
0:05:55.686,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But there used to be a whole load of people.

120
0:05:57.806,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Here's another message from this diagram.

121
0:05:59.783,000 --> 0:06:02,000
I've added on little blue tails behind Sudan, Libya,

122
0:06:03.173,000 --> 0:06:04,000
China, India, Bangladesh.

123
0:06:04.708,000 --> 0:06:06,000
That's 15 years of progress.

124
0:06:06.867,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Where were they 15 years ago, and where are they now?

125
0:06:09.412,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And the message is,

126
0:06:10.594,000 --> 0:06:12,000
most countries are going to the right, and they're going up.

127
0:06:13.491,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Up and to the right: bigger population density

128
0:06:15.662,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and higher per capita consumption.

129
0:06:17.626,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So, we may be off in the top right-hand corner, slightly unusual,

130
0:06:21.605,000 --> 0:06:23,000
the United Kingdom accompanied by Germany,

131
0:06:24.016,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Japan, South Korea, the Netherlands,

132
0:06:26.01,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and a bunch of other slightly odd countries,

133
0:06:28.399,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but many other countries are coming up and to the right to join us.

134
0:06:32.728,000 --> 0:06:34,000
So we're a picture, if you like,

135
0:06:34.795,000 --> 0:06:35,000
of what the future energy consumption

136
0:06:36.794,000 --> 0:06:38,000
might be looking like in other countries, too.

137
0:06:40.973,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I've also added in this diagram now some pink lines

138
0:06:43.916,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that go down and to the right.

139
0:06:45.829,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Those are lines of equal power consumption per unit area,

140
0:06:49.694,000 --> 0:06:51,000
which I measure in watts per square meter.

141
0:06:51.789,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So, for example, the middle line there, 0.1 watts per square meter,

142
0:06:55.66,000 --> 0:06:58,000
is the energy consumption per unit area of Saudi Arabia,

143
0:06:59.536,000 --> 0:07:03,000
Norway, Mexico in purple, and Bangladesh 15 years ago.

144
0:07:04.637,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Half of the world's population lives in countries

145
0:07:07.85,000 --> 0:07:09,000
that are already above that line.

146
0:07:11.71,000 --> 0:07:16,000
The United Kingdom is consuming 1.25 watts per square meter.

147
0:07:16.926,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So is Germany, and Japan is consuming a bit more.

148
0:07:21.258,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So, let's now say why this is relevant.

149
0:07:25.212,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Why is it relevant?

150
0:07:26.623,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Well, we can measure renewables in the same units

151
0:07:29.513,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and other forms of power production in the same units.

152
0:07:32.728,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Renewables is one of the leading ideas

153
0:07:35.495,000 --> 0:07:38,000
for how we could get off our 90 percent fossil-fuel habit.

154
0:07:39.802,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So here come some renewables.

155
0:07:41.238,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Energy crops deliver half a watt per square meter

156
0:07:43.922,000 --> 0:07:44,000
in European climates.

157
0:07:46.709,000 --> 0:07:47,000
What does that mean?

158
0:07:47.884,000 --> 0:07:48,000
You might have anticipated that result,

159
0:07:49.89,000 --> 0:07:52,000
given what I told you about the biofuel plantation a moment ago.

160
0:07:53.102,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Well, we consume 1.25 watts per square meter.

161
0:07:56.122,000 --> 0:07:57,000
What this means is,

162
0:07:57.303,000 --> 0:08:,000
even if you covered the whole of the United Kingdom with energy crops,

163
0:08:00.714,000 --> 0:08:02,000
you couldn't match today's energy consumption.

164
0:08:04.636,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Wind power produces a bit more -- 2.5 watts per square meter.

165
0:08:08.494,000 --> 0:08:12,000
But that's only twice as big as 1.25 watts per square meter.

166
0:08:13.043,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So that means if you wanted, literally, to produce total energy consumption

167
0:08:17.189,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in all forms, on average, from wind farms,

168
0:08:19.444,000 --> 0:08:21,000
you need wind farms half the area of the UK.

169
0:08:23.579,000 --> 0:08:26,000
I've got data to back up all these assertions, by the way.

170
0:08:27.643,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Next, let's look at solar power.

171
0:08:30.119,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Solar panels, when you put them on a roof,

172
0:08:32.161,000 --> 0:08:36,000
deliver about 20 watts per square meter in England.

173
0:08:37.9,000 --> 0:08:39,000
If you really want to get a lot from solar panels,

174
0:08:40.306,000 --> 0:08:42,000
you need to adopt the traditional Bavarian farming method,

175
0:08:43.134,000 --> 0:08:44,000
where you leap off the roof,

176
0:08:44.509,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and coat the countryside with solar panels, too.

177
0:08:47.037,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Solar parks, because of the gaps between the panels, deliver less.

178
0:08:50.257,000 --> 0:08:53,000
They deliver about 5 watts per square meter of land area.

179
0:08:53.688,000 --> 0:08:56,000
And here's a solar park in Vermont, with real data,

180
0:08:57.014,000 --> 0:08:59,000
delivering 4.2 watts per square meter.

181
0:09:00.061,000 --> 0:09:02,000
Remember where we are, 1.25 watts per square meter,

182
0:09:02.992,000 --> 0:09:05,000
wind farms 2.5, solar parks about five.

183
0:09:06.897,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So whichever of those renewables you pick,

184
0:09:10.351,000 --> 0:09:13,000
the message is, whatever mix of those renewables you're using,

185
0:09:13.924,000 --> 0:09:15,000
if you want to power the UK on them,

186
0:09:16.129,000 --> 0:09:18,000
you're going to need to cover something like

187
0:09:18.254,000 --> 0:09:2,000
20 percent or 25 percent of the country

188
0:09:21.136,000 --> 0:09:22,000
with those renewables.

189
0:09:23.15,000 --> 0:09:26,000
I'm not saying that's a bad idea; we just need to understand the numbers.

190
0:09:26.686,000 --> 0:09:28,000
I'm absolutely not anti-renewables. I love renewables.

191
0:09:29.282,000 --> 0:09:3,000
But I'm also pro-arithmetic.

192
0:09:30.942,000 --> 0:09:31,000
(Laughter)

193
0:09:32.671,000 --> 0:09:36,000
Concentrating solar power in deserts delivers larger powers per unit area,

194
0:09:36.827,000 --> 0:09:38,000
because you don't have the problem of clouds.

195
0:09:39.202,000 --> 0:09:42,000
So, this facility delivers 14 watts per square meter;

196
0:09:42.43,000 --> 0:09:43,000
this one 10 watts per square meter;

197
0:09:44.165,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and this one in Spain, 5 watts per square meter.

198
0:09:46.945,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Being generous to concentrating solar power,

199
0:09:49.143,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I think it's perfectly credible it could deliver 20 watts per square meter.

200
0:09:52.831,000 --> 0:09:53,000
So that's nice.

201
0:09:54.021,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Of course, Britain doesn't have any deserts.

202
0:09:56.955,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Yet.

203
0:09:58.135,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Laughter)

204
0:09:59.844,000 --> 0:10:01,000
So here's a summary so far:

205
0:10:03.035,000 --> 0:10:05,000
All renewables, much as I love them, are diffuse.

206
0:10:05.683,000 --> 0:10:07,000
They all have a small power per unit area,

207
0:10:07.746,000 --> 0:10:08,000
and we have to live with that fact.

208
0:10:10.271,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And that means, if you do want renewables to make a substantial difference

209
0:10:15.587,000 --> 0:10:16,000
for a country like the United Kingdom

210
0:10:17.399,000 --> 0:10:19,000
on the scale of today's consumption,

211
0:10:19.515,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you need to be imagining renewable facilities that are country-sized.

212
0:10:23.94,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Not the entire country,

213
0:10:25.277,000 --> 0:10:28,000
but a fraction of the country, a substantial fraction.

214
0:10:29.684,000 --> 0:10:31,000
There are other options for generating power as well,

215
0:10:32.255,000 --> 0:10:33,000
which don't involve fossil fuels.

216
0:10:33.963,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So there's nuclear power, and on this ordinance survey map,

217
0:10:37.142,000 --> 0:10:4,000
you can see there's a Sizewell B inside a blue square kilometer.

218
0:10:40.905,000 --> 0:10:42,000
That's one gigawatt in a square kilometer,

219
0:10:42.932,000 --> 0:10:44,000
which works out to 1,000 watts per square meter.

220
0:10:45.381,000 --> 0:10:47,000
So by this particular metric,

221
0:10:47.541,000 --> 0:10:52,000
nuclear power isn't as intrusive as renewables.

222
0:10:53.322,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Of course, other metrics matter, too,

223
0:10:55.341,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and nuclear power has all sorts of popularity problems.

224
0:10:58.964,000 --> 0:11:,000
But the same goes for renewables as well.

225
0:11:01.025,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Here's a photograph of a consultation exercise in full swing

226
0:11:03.877,000 --> 0:11:05,000
in the little town of Penicuik just outside Edinburgh,

227
0:11:06.589,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and you can see the children of Penicuik celebrating

228
0:11:09.107,000 --> 0:11:11,000
the burning of the effigy of the windmill.

229
0:11:11.501,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So --

230
0:11:12.684,000 --> 0:11:13,000
(Laughter)

231
0:11:13.758,000 --> 0:11:14,000
People are anti-everything,

232
0:11:15.111,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and we've got to keep all the options on the table.

233
0:11:18.328,000 --> 0:11:21,000
What can a country like the UK do on the supply side?

234
0:11:21.991,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Well, the options are, I'd say, these three:

235
0:11:24.934,000 --> 0:11:25,000
power renewables,

236
0:11:26.136,000 --> 0:11:29,000
and recognizing that they need to be close to country-sized;

237
0:11:29.871,000 --> 0:11:3,000
other people's renewables,

238
0:11:31.141,000 --> 0:11:33,000
so we could go back and talk very politely

239
0:11:33.292,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to the people in the top left-hand side of the diagram and say,

240
0:11:36.353,000 --> 0:11:38,000
"Uh, we don't want renewables in our backyard,

241
0:11:38.628,000 --> 0:11:4,000
but, um, please could we put them in yours instead?"

242
0:11:41.246,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And that's a serious option.

243
0:11:43.235,000 --> 0:11:46,000
It's a way for the world to handle this issue.

244
0:11:46.843,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So countries like Australia, Russia, Libya, Kazakhstan,

245
0:11:50.999,000 --> 0:11:53,000
could be our best friends for renewable production.

246
0:11:55.356,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And a third option is nuclear power.

247
0:11:57.416,000 --> 0:11:59,000
So that's some supply-side options.

248
0:11:59.656,000 --> 0:12:02,000
In addition to the supply levers that we can push --

249
0:12:02.972,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and remember, we need large amounts,

250
0:12:05.031,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because at the moment, we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels --

251
0:12:08.582,000 --> 0:12:09,000
in addition to those levers,

252
0:12:09.966,000 --> 0:12:12,000
we could talk about other ways of solving this issue.

253
0:12:13.041,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Namely, we could reduce demand, and that means reducing population --

254
0:12:16.461,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I'm not sure how to do that --

255
0:12:18.3,000 --> 0:12:2,000
or reducing per capita consumption.

256
0:12:21.136,000 --> 0:12:23,000
So let's talk about three more big levers

257
0:12:23.623,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that could really help on the consumption side.

258
0:12:25.973,000 --> 0:12:26,000
First, transport.

259
0:12:27.151,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Here are the physics principles

260
0:12:28.718,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that tell you how to reduce the energy consumption of transport.

261
0:12:31.792,000 --> 0:12:33,000
People often say, "Technology can answer everything.

262
0:12:34.262,000 --> 0:12:36,000
We can make vehicles that are 100 times more efficient."

263
0:12:37.062,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And that's almost true. Let me show you.

264
0:12:39.066,000 --> 0:12:41,000
The energy consumption of this typical tank here

265
0:12:41.558,000 --> 0:12:44,000
is 80 kilowatt hours per hundred person kilometers.

266
0:12:45.006,000 --> 0:12:48,000
That's the average European car.

267
0:12:49.347,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Eighty kilowatt hours.

268
0:12:50.522,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Can we make something 100 times better

269
0:12:52.634,000 --> 0:12:54,000
by applying the physics principles I just listed?

270
0:12:54.971,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Yes. Here it is. It's the bicycle.

271
0:12:56.638,000 --> 0:12:58,000
It's 80 times better in energy consumption,

272
0:12:59.308,000 --> 0:13:01,000
and it's powered by biofuel, by Weetabix.

273
0:13:01.556,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Laughter)

274
0:13:03.718,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And there are other options in between,

275
0:13:05.609,000 --> 0:13:07,000
because maybe the lady in the tank would say,

276
0:13:07.76,000 --> 0:13:1,000
"No, that's a lifestyle change. Don't change my lifestyle, please."

277
0:13:10.94,000 --> 0:13:13,000
We could persuade her to take a train, still a lot more efficient than a car,

278
0:13:14.611,000 --> 0:13:15,000
but that might be a lifestyle change.

279
0:13:16.41,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Or there's the EcoCAR, top-left.

280
0:13:18.018,000 --> 0:13:21,000
It comfortably accommodates one teenager and it's shorter than a traffic cone,

281
0:13:21.777,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and it's almost as efficient as a bicycle,

282
0:13:23.837,000 --> 0:13:26,000
as long as you drive it at 15 miles per hour.

283
0:13:27.299,000 --> 0:13:29,000
In between, perhaps some more realistic options

284
0:13:29.55,000 --> 0:13:31,000
on the transport lever are electric vehicles,

285
0:13:32.539,000 --> 0:13:34,000
so electric bikes and electric cars in the middle,

286
0:13:34.942,000 --> 0:13:39,000
perhaps four times as energy efficient as the standard petrol-powered tank.

287
0:13:40.778,000 --> 0:13:41,000
Next, there's the heating lever.

288
0:13:42.7,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Heating is a third of our energy consumption in Britain,

289
0:13:46.215,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and quite a lot of that is going into homes

290
0:13:48.312,000 --> 0:13:49,000
and other buildings,

291
0:13:49.719,000 --> 0:13:5,000
doing space heating and water heating.

292
0:13:51.72,000 --> 0:13:53,000
So here's a typical crappy British house.

293
0:13:54.028,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It's my house, with a Ferrari out front.

294
0:13:56.771,000 --> 0:13:57,000
(Laughter)

295
0:13:57.86,000 --> 0:13:58,000
What can we do to it?

296
0:13:59.037,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Well, the laws of physics are written up there,

297
0:14:02.722,000 --> 0:14:07,000
which describe how the power consumption for heating

298
0:14:07.994,000 --> 0:14:08,000
is driven by the things you can control.

299
0:14:09.926,000 --> 0:14:11,000
The things you can control are the temperature difference

300
0:14:12.844,000 --> 0:14:13,000
between the inside and the outside.

301
0:14:14.551,000 --> 0:14:16,000
There's this remarkable technology called a thermostat:

302
0:14:17.189,000 --> 0:14:18,000
you grasp it, rotate it to the left,

303
0:14:18.949,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and your energy consumption in the home will decrease.

304
0:14:21.502,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I've tried it. It works. Some people call it a lifestyle change.

305
0:14:24.629,000 --> 0:14:25,000
(Laughter)

306
0:14:25.737,000 --> 0:14:28,000
You can also get the fluff men in to reduce the leakiness

307
0:14:29.241,000 --> 0:14:31,000
of your building -- put fluff in the walls, fluff in the roof,

308
0:14:32.234,000 --> 0:14:33,000
a new front door, and so forth.

309
0:14:35.452,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The sad truth is, this will save you money.

310
0:14:38.061,000 --> 0:14:39,000
That's not sad, that's good.

311
0:14:39.425,000 --> 0:14:4,000
But the sad truth is,

312
0:14:40.627,000 --> 0:14:43,000
it'll only get about 25 percent of the leakiness of your building

313
0:14:43.85,000 --> 0:14:45,000
if you do these things, which are good ideas.

314
0:14:46.569,000 --> 0:14:49,000
If you really want to get a bit closer to Swedish building standards

315
0:14:49.852,000 --> 0:14:5,000
with a crappy house like this,

316
0:14:51.526,000 --> 0:14:54,000
you need to be putting external insulation on the building,

317
0:14:54.996,000 --> 0:14:56,000
as shown by this block of flats in London.

318
0:14:58.652,000 --> 0:15:01,000
You can also deliver heat more efficiently using heat pumps,

319
0:15:01.681,000 --> 0:15:04,000
which use a smaller bit of high-grade energy like electricity

320
0:15:05.175,000 --> 0:15:07,000
to move heat from your garden into your house.

321
0:15:08.676,000 --> 0:15:1,000
The third demand-side option I want to talk about,

322
0:15:11.07,000 --> 0:15:14,000
the third way to reduce energy consumption is: read your meters.

323
0:15:14.24,000 --> 0:15:15,000
People talk a lot about smart meters,

324
0:15:16.093,000 --> 0:15:17,000
but you can do it yourself.

325
0:15:17.464,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Use your own eyes and be smart.

326
0:15:19.413,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Read your meter, and if you're anything like me, it'll change your life.

327
0:15:23.1,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Here's a graph I made.

328
0:15:24.556,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I was writing a book about sustainable energy,

329
0:15:26.724,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and a friend asked me,

330
0:15:27.902,000 --> 0:15:28,000
"How much energy do you use at home?"

331
0:15:29.74,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I was embarrassed; I didn't actually know.

332
0:15:31.784,000 --> 0:15:33,000
And so I started reading the meter every week.

333
0:15:34.009,000 --> 0:15:37,000
The old meter readings are shown in the top half of the graph,

334
0:15:37.825,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and then 2007 is shown in green at the bottom.

335
0:15:40.074,000 --> 0:15:42,000
That was when I was reading the meter every week.

336
0:15:42.42,000 --> 0:15:43,000
And my life changed,

337
0:15:43.61,000 --> 0:15:46,000
because I started doing experiments and seeing what made a difference.

338
0:15:46.989,000 --> 0:15:47,000
My gas consumption plummeted,

339
0:15:48.418,000 --> 0:15:5,000
because I started tinkering with the thermostat

340
0:15:50.661,000 --> 0:15:51,000
and the timing on the heating system,

341
0:15:52.484,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and I knocked more than half off my gas bills.

342
0:15:54.721,000 --> 0:15:56,000
There's a similar story for my electricity consumption,

343
0:15:57.628,000 --> 0:16:,000
where switching off the DVD players, the stereos,

344
0:16:01.214,000 --> 0:16:03,000
the computer peripherals that were on all the time,

345
0:16:04.032,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and just switching them on when I needed them,

346
0:16:06.251,000 --> 0:16:08,000
knocked another third off my electricity bills, too.

347
0:16:10.142,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So we need a plan that adds up.

348
0:16:11.932,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I've described for you six big levers.

349
0:16:14.546,000 --> 0:16:15,000
We need big action,

350
0:16:15.736,000 --> 0:16:17,000
because we get 90 percent of our energy from fossil fuels,

351
0:16:18.522,000 --> 0:16:22,000
and so you need to push hard on most, if not all, of these levers.

352
0:16:23.288,000 --> 0:16:25,000
Most of these levers have popularity problems,

353
0:16:25.598,000 --> 0:16:28,000
and if there is a lever you don't like the use of,

354
0:16:29.288,000 --> 0:16:32,000
well, please do bear in mind that means you need even stronger effort

355
0:16:33.129,000 --> 0:16:34,000
on the other levers.

356
0:16:35.456,000 --> 0:16:38,000
So I'm a strong advocate of having grown-up conversations

357
0:16:38.631,000 --> 0:16:4,000
that are based on numbers and facts.

358
0:16:40.916,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And I want to close with this map that just visualizes for you

359
0:16:44.716,000 --> 0:16:47,000
the requirement of land and so forth

360
0:16:48.277,000 --> 0:16:51,000
in order to get just 16 lightbulbs per person

361
0:16:51.365,000 --> 0:16:53,000
from four of the big possible sources.

362
0:16:54.474,000 --> 0:16:57,000
So, if you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs --

363
0:16:57.658,000 --> 0:17:01,000
remember, today our total energy consumption is 125 lightbulbs' worth --

364
0:17:02.003,000 --> 0:17:04,000
if you wanted 16 from wind,

365
0:17:04.25,000 --> 0:17:06,000
this map visualizes a solution for the UK.

366
0:17:07.101,000 --> 0:17:11,000
It's got 160 wind farms, each 100 square kilometers in size,

367
0:17:11.282,000 --> 0:17:14,000
and that would be a twentyfold increase over today's amount of wind.

368
0:17:15.19,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Nuclear power: to get 16 lightbulbs per person,

369
0:17:18.122,000 --> 0:17:21,000
you'd need two gigawatts at each of the purple dots on the map.

370
0:17:21.235,000 --> 0:17:25,000
That's a fourfold increase over today's levels of nuclear power.

371
0:17:26.069,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Biomass: to get 16 lightbulbs per person,

372
0:17:28.791,000 --> 0:17:32,000
you'd need a land area something like three and a half Wales' worth,

373
0:17:33.823,000 --> 0:17:35,000
either in our country, or in someone else's country,

374
0:17:36.429,000 --> 0:17:38,000
possibly Ireland, possibly somewhere else.

375
0:17:38.496,000 --> 0:17:39,000
(Laughter)

376
0:17:39.599,000 --> 0:17:4,000
And a fourth supply-side option:

377
0:17:41.414,000 --> 0:17:43,000
concentrating solar power in other people's deserts.

378
0:17:44.554,000 --> 0:17:46,000
If you wanted to get 16 lightbulbs' worth,

379
0:17:47.017,000 --> 0:17:5,000
then we're talking about these eight hexagons

380
0:17:50.056,000 --> 0:17:51,000
down at the bottom right.

381
0:17:51.391,000 --> 0:17:55,000
The total area of those hexagons is two Greater London's worth

382
0:17:55.64,000 --> 0:17:57,000
of someone else's Sahara,

383
0:17:57.753,000 --> 0:18:,000
and you'll need power lines all the way across Spain and France

384
0:18:00.784,000 --> 0:18:03,000
to bring the power from the Sahara to Surrey.

385
0:18:04.595,000 --> 0:18:05,000
(Laughter)

386
0:18:05.769,000 --> 0:18:06,000
We need a plan that adds up.

387
0:18:08.295,000 --> 0:18:1,000
We need to stop shouting and start talking.

388
0:18:12.209,000 --> 0:18:16,000
And if we can have a grown-up conversation,

389
0:18:16.456,000 --> 0:18:18,000
make a plan that adds up and get building,

390
0:18:18.941,000 --> 0:18:21,000
maybe this low-carbon revolution will actually be fun.

391
0:18:21.969,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Thank you very much for listening.

392
0:18:23.731,000 --> 0:18:25,000
(Applause)

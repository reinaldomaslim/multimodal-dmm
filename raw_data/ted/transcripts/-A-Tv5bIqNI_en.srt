2
0:00:15.97,000 --> 0:00:21,000
hi there I'm going to be talking a

3
0:00:18.83,000 --> 0:00:24,000
little bit about music machines and life

4
0:00:22.36,000 --> 0:00:26,000
or more specifically what we learn from

5
0:00:25.67,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the creation of a very large and

6
0:00:27.169,000 --> 0:00:31,000
complicated machine for a music video

7
0:00:29.529,000 --> 0:00:33,000
some of you may recognize this image

8
0:00:32.09,000 --> 0:00:36,000
this is the opening frame of the video

9
0:00:34.43,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that we created will be showing the

10
0:00:36.2,000 --> 0:00:4,000
video at the end but before we do I want

11
0:00:38.989,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to talk a little bit about what it is

12
0:00:40.91,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that they wanted now when we first

13
0:00:43.01,000 --> 0:00:48,000
started talking to Ok Go the the name of

14
0:00:46.19,000 --> 0:00:5,000
the song is this too shall pass we were

15
0:00:48.95,000 --> 0:00:51,000
really excited because they expressed

16
0:00:50.6,000 --> 0:00:53,000
interest in building a machine that they

17
0:00:52.4,000 --> 0:00:56,000
could dance with and we were very

18
0:00:54.14,000 --> 0:00:58,000
excited about this because of course

19
0:00:56.93,000 --> 0:01:,000
they have a history of dancing with

20
0:00:58.91,000 --> 0:01:02,000
machines they're responsible for this

21
0:01:01.46,000 --> 0:01:05,000
video here it goes again

22
0:01:03.07,000 --> 0:01:08,000
50 million plus views on YouTube for

23
0:01:06.29,000 --> 0:01:09,000
guys dancing on treadmills you know no

24
0:01:08.57,000 --> 0:01:11,000
cuts just a static camera a

25
0:01:10.13,000 --> 0:01:13,000
fantastically viral and wonderful video

26
0:01:12.079,000 --> 0:01:16,000
so we're really excited about working

27
0:01:13.7,000 --> 0:01:17,000
with them and we sort of started talking

28
0:01:16.159,000 --> 0:01:19,000
about what it is that they wanted and

29
0:01:17.9,000 --> 0:01:22,000
they explained that they wanted a kind

30
0:01:19.97,000 --> 0:01:23,000
of a Rube Goldberg machine now for those

31
0:01:23.12,000 --> 0:01:28,000
of you who don't know a Rube Goldberg

32
0:01:24.89,000 --> 0:01:29,000
machine is a complicated contraption an

33
0:01:28.28,000 --> 0:01:33,000
incredibly over engineered piece of

34
0:01:30.71,000 --> 0:01:35,000
machinery that accomplishes a relatively

35
0:01:33.35,000 --> 0:01:37,000
simple task so we were excited by this

36
0:01:35.75,000 --> 0:01:39,000
idea and we started talking about

37
0:01:37.85,000 --> 0:01:42,000
exactly what it would look like and we

38
0:01:40.61,000 --> 0:01:43,000
came up with some parameters that you

39
0:01:43.1,000 --> 0:01:48,000
know because building a Rube Goldberg

40
0:01:44.51,000 --> 0:01:5,000
machine is you know has limitations but

41
0:01:48.2,000 --> 0:01:51,000
it also is pretty wide open and we

42
0:01:50.78,000 --> 0:01:52,000
wanted to make sure that we did

43
0:01:51.83,000 --> 0:01:53,000
something that would work for a music

44
0:01:53.51,000 --> 0:01:56,000
video

45
0:01:53.93,000 --> 0:01:59,000
so we came up with a list of

46
0:01:57.38,000 --> 0:02:01,000
requirements the ten commandments and

47
0:02:00.02,000 --> 0:02:05,000
they were in order of ascending

48
0:02:02.06,000 --> 0:02:06,000
difficulty the first is no magic

49
0:02:05.03,000 --> 0:02:08,000
everything that happened on-screen had

50
0:02:06.77,000 --> 0:02:09,000
to be very easily understood by a

51
0:02:08.269,000 --> 0:02:12,000
typical viewer the rule of thumb was

52
0:02:10.729,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that if my mother couldn't understand it

53
0:02:12.769,000 --> 0:02:15,000
then we couldn't use it in the video

54
0:02:14.269,000 --> 0:02:17,000
they wanted banned integration that is

55
0:02:16.519,000 --> 0:02:19,000
the machine

56
0:02:17.52,000 --> 0:02:21,000
thing upon the band members specifically

57
0:02:19.74,000 --> 0:02:23,000
not the other way around they wanted the

58
0:02:21.96,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Machine action to follow this song

59
0:02:24.18,000 --> 0:02:29,000
feeling so as the song picks up emotion

60
0:02:26.52,000 --> 0:02:31,000
so should the Machine get grander in its

61
0:02:29.91,000 --> 0:02:33,000
process they wanted us to make use of a

62
0:02:31.92,000 --> 0:02:34,000
space so we have this 10,000 square foot

63
0:02:34.32,000 --> 0:02:37,000
warehouse we were using divided between

64
0:02:35.82,000 --> 0:02:39,000
two floors it included an exterior

65
0:02:38.1,000 --> 0:02:42,000
loading dock we used all of that

66
0:02:40.05,000 --> 0:02:43,000
including a giant hole in the floor that

67
0:02:42.45,000 --> 0:02:45,000
we actually descended the camera and

68
0:02:43.89,000 --> 0:02:48,000
cameraman through they wanted it messy

69
0:02:45.93,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and we were happy to oblige the machine

70
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
itself would start the music so the

71
0:02:51.51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
machine would get started it would

72
0:02:53.04,000 --> 0:02:58,000
travel some distance reacting along the

73
0:02:55.35,000 --> 0:02:59,000
way hit play on an iPod or a tape deck

74
0:02:58.53,000 --> 0:03:01,000
or something that would start playback

75
0:03:,000 --> 0:03:04,000
and the Machine would maintain

76
0:03:01.88,000 --> 0:03:05,000
synchronization throughout and speaking

77
0:03:04.35,000 --> 0:03:07,000
of synchronization they wanted it to

78
0:03:05.97,000 --> 0:03:14,000
sync to the rhythm and to hit specific

79
0:03:07.68,000 --> 0:03:17,000
beats along the way okay they wanted it

80
0:03:15.03,000 --> 0:03:2,000
to end precisely on time okay so now the

81
0:03:18.51,000 --> 0:03:22,000
start to finish timing has to be perfect

82
0:03:20.58,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and they wanted the music to drop out at

83
0:03:23.31,000 --> 0:03:27,000
a certain point of the video and actual

84
0:03:25.35,000 --> 0:03:3,000
live audio from the machine to play part

85
0:03:27.48,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of the song and as if that wasn't enough

86
0:03:30.51,000 --> 0:03:37,000
all of these incredibly complicating

87
0:03:32.79,000 --> 0:03:37,000
things right they wanted it in one shot

88
0:03:43.06,000 --> 0:03:49,000
okay so just some statistics about sort

89
0:03:48.92,000 --> 0:03:51,000
of what we went through in the process

90
0:03:49.97,000 --> 0:03:53,000
the machine itself has eighty nine

91
0:03:52.09,000 --> 0:03:58,000
distinct interactions

92
0:03:54.5,000 --> 0:04:01,000
it took us eighty five takes to get it

93
0:03:59.03,000 --> 0:04:04,000
on film to our satisfaction of those

94
0:04:01.64,000 --> 0:04:06,000
eighty five takes only three actually

95
0:04:04.34,000 --> 0:04:09,000
successfully completed their run we

96
0:04:07.34,000 --> 0:04:12,000
destroyed two pianos and ten televisions

97
0:04:09.92,000 --> 0:04:17,000
in the process we went to Home Depot

98
0:04:13.22,000 --> 0:04:2,000
well over a hundred times and we lost

99
0:04:18.049,000 --> 0:04:23,000
one high-heeled shoe when one of our

100
0:04:20.989,000 --> 0:04:24,000
engineers Heather Knight left her her

101
0:04:23.24,000 --> 0:04:27,000
high-heeled shoe after a nice dinner and

102
0:04:25.07,000 --> 0:04:29,000
returned back to the build and left it

103
0:04:27.41,000 --> 0:04:29,000
in a pile of stuff and another engineer

104
0:04:29.24,000 --> 0:04:31,000
thought well that would be a really good

105
0:04:30.32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
thing to use and ended up using it as a

106
0:04:32.03,000 --> 0:04:35,000
really nice trigger and it's actually in

107
0:04:33.74,000 --> 0:04:36,000
the machine

108
0:04:35.51,000 --> 0:04:39,000
so what did we learn from all of this

109
0:04:37.64,000 --> 0:04:41,000
well having completed this we get the

110
0:04:39.92,000 --> 0:04:42,000
opportunity to step back and reflect on

111
0:04:41.81,000 --> 0:04:46,000
some of the things and we learned that

112
0:04:43.91,000 --> 0:04:48,000
small stuff stinks little balls in

113
0:04:47.24,000 --> 0:04:51,000
wooden tracks are really susceptible to

114
0:04:49.82,000 --> 0:04:52,000
humidity and temperature and a little

115
0:04:51.83,000 --> 0:04:54,000
bit of dust and they fall out of the

116
0:04:53.6,000 --> 0:04:57,000
tracks and the exact angles makes it

117
0:04:55.31,000 --> 0:04:59,000
hard to to get right and yet a bowling

118
0:04:58.31,000 --> 0:05:,000
ball will always follow the same path it

119
0:05:00.08,000 --> 0:05:03,000
doesn't matter what temperature it is

120
0:05:01.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
doesn't matter what's in its way it will

121
0:05:03.56,000 --> 0:05:06,000
pretty much get where it needs to go but

122
0:05:05.6,000 --> 0:05:07,000
as much as the small stuff stinks we

123
0:05:07.1,000 --> 0:05:1,000
needed somewhere to start so that we

124
0:05:08.54,000 --> 0:05:11,000
would have somewhere to go and so you

125
0:05:10.22,000 --> 0:05:12,000
have to start with it you have to focus

126
0:05:11.96,000 --> 0:05:14,000
on it

127
0:05:12.5,000 --> 0:05:17,000
small stuff stinks but of course it's

128
0:05:15.53,000 --> 0:05:23,000
essential right what else

129
0:05:17.63,000 --> 0:05:24,000
planning is incredibly important you

130
0:05:23.93,000 --> 0:05:26,000
know we spent a lot of time I da ting

131
0:05:25.4,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and even building some of these things

132
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
it's been said that no battle plan

133
0:05:29.87,000 --> 0:05:35,000
survives contact with the enemy

134
0:05:31.37,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I think our enemy was physics and she's

135
0:05:35.9,000 --> 0:05:4,000
a cruel mistress and often we had to

136
0:05:39.59,000 --> 0:05:42,000
pull things out as a result because of

137
0:05:41.27,000 --> 0:05:44,000
timing or aesthetics or whatever and so

138
0:05:43.55,000 --> 0:05:46,000
while planning is important so is

139
0:05:45.23,000 --> 0:05:49,000
flexibility these are all things that

140
0:05:47.12,000 --> 0:05:53,000
ended up not making it into the final

141
0:05:49.34,000 --> 0:05:55,000
machine so also put reliable stuff last

142
0:05:53.89,000 --> 0:05:57,000
the stuff that's going to run every time

143
0:05:56.12,000 --> 0:06:01,000
right again small to large is relevant

144
0:05:58.85,000 --> 0:06:02,000
here the little Lego car in the

145
0:06:01.49,000 --> 0:06:05,000
beginning of the video reference is the

146
0:06:03.56,000 --> 0:06:07,000
big real car near the end of the video

147
0:06:06.11,000 --> 0:06:09,000
the big real car works every time

148
0:06:07.82,000 --> 0:06:09,000
there's no problem about it the little

149
0:06:09.38,000 --> 0:06:12,000
one had a tendency to try to run off the

150
0:06:10.7,000 --> 0:06:13,000
track and that's a problem so but you

151
0:06:13.28,000 --> 0:06:15,000
don't want to have to reset the whole

152
0:06:14.27,000 --> 0:06:17,000
machine because the Lego car at the end

153
0:06:15.86,000 --> 0:06:18,000
doesn't work right so you put that up

154
0:06:17.81,000 --> 0:06:2,000
front so that if it fails at least you

155
0:06:19.76,000 --> 0:06:28,000
know you're gonna you don't have to

156
0:06:21.41,000 --> 0:06:3,000
reset the whole thing life can be messy

157
0:06:29.19,000 --> 0:06:32,000
there were incredibly difficult moments

158
0:06:31.36,000 --> 0:06:34,000
in the building of this thing months

159
0:06:32.8,000 --> 0:06:36,000
were spent in this tiny cold warehouse

160
0:06:34.66,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and with wonderful elation that we that

161
0:06:37.36,000 --> 0:06:4,000
we had when we finally completed it so

162
0:06:39.82,000 --> 0:06:42,000
it's important to remember that whether

163
0:06:40.96,000 --> 0:06:47,000
it's good or it's bad this too shall

164
0:06:43.27,000 --> 0:06:47,000
pass thank you very much

165
0:06:52.689,000 --> 0:06:59,000

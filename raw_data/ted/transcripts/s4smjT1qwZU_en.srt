1
0:00:15.619,000 --> 0:00:18,000
This is a thousand-year-old drawing of the brain.

2
0:00:19.615,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It's a diagram of the visual system.

3
0:00:21.527,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And some things look very familiar today.

4
0:00:24.277,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Two eyes at the bottom, optic nerve flowing out from the back.

5
0:00:28.644,000 --> 0:00:3,000
There's a very large nose

6
0:00:30.764,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that doesn't seem to be connected to anything in particular.

7
0:00:34.081,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And if we compare this

8
0:00:35.781,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to more recent representations of the visual system,

9
0:00:37.855,000 --> 0:00:39,000
you'll see that things have gotten substantially more complicated

10
0:00:40.812,000 --> 0:00:41,000
over the intervening thousand years.

11
0:00:42.385,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And that's because today we can see what's inside of the brain,

12
0:00:45.35,000 --> 0:00:47,000
rather than just looking at its overall shape.

13
0:00:47.831,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Imagine you wanted to understand how a computer works

14
0:00:51.81,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and all you could see was a keyboard, a mouse, a screen.

15
0:00:54.989,000 --> 0:00:56,000
You really would be kind of out of luck.

16
0:00:57.385,000 --> 0:00:59,000
You want to be able to open it up, crack it open,

17
0:00:59.427,000 --> 0:01:,000
look at the wiring inside.

18
0:01:01.271,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And up until a little more than a century ago,

19
0:01:03.135,000 --> 0:01:05,000
nobody was able to do that with the brain.

20
0:01:05.135,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Nobody had had a glimpse of the brain's wiring.

21
0:01:07.015,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And that's because if you take a brain out of the skull

22
0:01:09.967,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and you cut a thin slice of it,

23
0:01:11.656,000 --> 0:01:13,000
put it under even a very powerful microscope,

24
0:01:14.154,000 --> 0:01:15,000
there's nothing there.

25
0:01:15.335,000 --> 0:01:16,000
It's gray, formless.

26
0:01:16.948,000 --> 0:01:18,000
There's no structure. It won't tell you anything.

27
0:01:19.552,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And this all changed in the late 19th century.

28
0:01:22.406,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Suddenly, new chemical stains for brain tissue were developed

29
0:01:26.281,000 --> 0:01:28,000
and they gave us our first glimpses at brain wiring.

30
0:01:29.093,000 --> 0:01:31,000
The computer was cracked open.

31
0:01:31.106,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So what really launched modern neuroscience

32
0:01:33.962,000 --> 0:01:34,000
was a stain called the Golgi stain.

33
0:01:35.927,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And it works in a very particular way.

34
0:01:37.808,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Instead of staining all of the cells inside of a tissue,

35
0:01:40.918,000 --> 0:01:43,000
it somehow only stains about one percent of them.

36
0:01:43.95,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It clears the forest, reveals the trees inside.

37
0:01:47.292,000 --> 0:01:49,000
If everything had been labeled, nothing would have been visible.

38
0:01:49.964,000 --> 0:01:51,000
So somehow it shows what's there.

39
0:01:52.01,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramon y Cajal,

40
0:01:54.677,000 --> 0:01:56,000
who's widely considered the father of modern neuroscience,

41
0:01:57.522,000 --> 0:02:,000
applied this Golgi stain, which yields data which looks like this,

42
0:02:01.419,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and really gave us the modern notion of the nerve cell, the neuron.

43
0:02:05.177,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And if you're thinking of the brain as a computer,

44
0:02:07.791,000 --> 0:02:09,000
this is the transistor.

45
0:02:09.802,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And very quickly Cajal realized

46
0:02:11.877,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that neurons don't operate alone,

47
0:02:14.214,000 --> 0:02:15,000
but rather make connections with others

48
0:02:16.052,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that form circuits just like in a computer.

49
0:02:18.558,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Today, a century later, when researchers want to visualize neurons,

50
0:02:21.949,000 --> 0:02:23,000
they light them up from the inside rather than darkening them.

51
0:02:24.716,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And there's several ways of doing this.

52
0:02:25.866,000 --> 0:02:26,000
But one of the most popular ones

53
0:02:27.593,000 --> 0:02:29,000
involves green fluorescent protein.

54
0:02:29.685,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Now green fluorescent protein,

55
0:02:31.344,000 --> 0:02:34,000
which oddly enough comes from a bioluminescent jellyfish,

56
0:02:34.489,000 --> 0:02:35,000
is very useful.

57
0:02:35.727,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein

58
0:02:38.365,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and deliver it to a cell,

59
0:02:40.04,000 --> 0:02:41,000
that cell will glow green --

60
0:02:41.787,000 --> 0:02:44,000
or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein,

61
0:02:45.533,000 --> 0:02:46,000
you get a cell to glow many different colors.

62
0:02:47.197,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And so coming back to the brain,

63
0:02:48.718,000 --> 0:02:51,000
this is from a genetically engineered mouse called "Brainbow."

64
0:02:52.518,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And it's so called, of course,

65
0:02:54.068,000 --> 0:02:57,000
because all of these neurons are glowing different colors.

66
0:02:57.68,000 --> 0:03:,000
Now sometimes neuroscientists need to identify

67
0:03:01.131,000 --> 0:03:04,000
individual molecular components of neurons, molecules,

68
0:03:04.175,000 --> 0:03:05,000
rather than the entire cell.

69
0:03:05.973,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And there's several ways of doing this,

70
0:03:07.679,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but one of the most popular ones

71
0:03:09.148,000 --> 0:03:11,000
involves using antibodies.

72
0:03:11.343,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And you're familiar, of course,

73
0:03:12.68,000 --> 0:03:14,000
with antibodies as the henchmen of the immune system.

74
0:03:15.631,000 --> 0:03:17,000
But it turns out that they're so useful to the immune system

75
0:03:18.049,000 --> 0:03:2,000
because they can recognize specific molecules,

76
0:03:20.599,000 --> 0:03:22,000
like, for example, the coat protein

77
0:03:22.718,000 --> 0:03:24,000
of a virus that's invading the body.

78
0:03:25.106,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And researchers have used this fact

79
0:03:27.151,000 --> 0:03:31,000
in order to recognize specific molecules inside of the brain,

80
0:03:31.476,000 --> 0:03:33,000
recognize specific substructures of the cell

81
0:03:34.116,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and identify them individually.

82
0:03:36.36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And a lot of the images I've been showing you here are very beautiful,

83
0:03:39.385,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but they're also very powerful.

84
0:03:41.291,000 --> 0:03:42,000
They have great explanatory power.

85
0:03:42.927,000 --> 0:03:44,000
This, for example, is an antibody staining

86
0:03:45.017,000 --> 0:03:48,000
against serotonin transporters in a slice of mouse brain.

87
0:03:48.537,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And you've heard of serotonin, of course,

88
0:03:50.218,000 --> 0:03:52,000
in the context of diseases like depression and anxiety.

89
0:03:53.045,000 --> 0:03:54,000
You've heard of SSRIs,

90
0:03:54.453,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which are drugs that are used to treat these diseases.

91
0:03:57.35,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And in order to understand how serotonin works,

92
0:04:00.24,000 --> 0:04:03,000
it's critical to understand where the serontonin machinery is.

93
0:04:03.316,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And antibody stainings like this one

94
0:04:04.912,000 --> 0:04:07,000
can be used to understand that sort of question.

95
0:04:08.458,000 --> 0:04:1,000
I'd like to leave you with the following thought:

96
0:04:11.016,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Green fluorescent protein and antibodies

97
0:04:13.626,000 --> 0:04:16,000
are both totally natural products at the get-go.

98
0:04:16.633,000 --> 0:04:18,000
They were evolved by nature

99
0:04:19.412,000 --> 0:04:21,000
in order to get a jellyfish to glow green for whatever reason,

100
0:04:21.979,000 --> 0:04:25,000
or in order to detect the coat protein of an invading virus, for example.

101
0:04:26.362,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And only much later did scientists come onto the scene

102
0:04:29.379,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and say, "Hey, these are tools,

103
0:04:31.402,000 --> 0:04:33,000
these are functions that we could use

104
0:04:33.515,000 --> 0:04:35,000
in our own research tool palette."

105
0:04:35.523,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And instead of applying feeble human minds

106
0:04:39.151,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to designing these tools from scratch,

107
0:04:41.035,000 --> 0:04:43,000
there were these ready-made solutions right out there in nature

108
0:04:43.939,000 --> 0:04:46,000
developed and refined steadily for millions of years

109
0:04:47.175,000 --> 0:04:48,000
by the greatest engineer of all.

110
0:04:48.875,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Thank you.

111
0:04:50.137,000 --> 0:04:52,000
(Applause)

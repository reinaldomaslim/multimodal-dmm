1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I am passionate about the American landscape

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
and how the physical form of the land,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
from the great Central Valley of California

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
to the bedrock of Manhattan,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
has really shaped our history and our character.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
But one thing is clear.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
In the last 100 years alone,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
our country -- and this is a sprawl map of America --

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
our country has systematically

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
flattened and homogenized the landscape

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to the point where we've forgotten

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
our relationship with the plants and animals

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
that live alongside us

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and the dirt beneath our feet.

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And so, how I see my work contributing

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
is sort of trying to literally re-imagine these connections

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and physically rebuild them.

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This graph represents what we're dealing with now

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
in the built environment.

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And it's really a conflux

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
of urban population rising,

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
biodiversity plummeting

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and also, of course, sea levels rising

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and climate changing.

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
So when I also think about design,

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I think about

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
trying to rework and re-engage

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
the lines on this graph

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
in a more productive way.

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And you can see from the arrow here

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
indicating "you are here,"

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I'm trying to sort of blend and meld

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
these two very divergent fields

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
of urbanism and ecology,

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and sort of bring them together in an exciting new way.

36
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So the era of big infrastructure is over.

37
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I mean, these sort of top-down,

38
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
mono-functional, capital-intensive solutions

39
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
are really not going to cut it.

40
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
We need new tools and new approaches.

41
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Similarly, the idea of architecture

42
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
as this sort of object in the field,

43
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
devoid of context,

44
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
is really not the --

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
excuse me, it's fairly blatant --

46
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is really not the approach

47
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that we need to take.

48
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
So we need new stories,

49
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
new heroes and new tools.

50
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
So now I want to introduce you to my new hero

51
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
in the global climate change war,

52
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and that is the eastern oyster.

53
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So, albeit a very small creature

54
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and very modest,

55
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
this creature is incredible,

56
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
because it can agglomerate

57
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
into these mega-reef structures.

58
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
It can grow; you can grow it;

59
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and -- did I mention? -- it's quite tasty.

60
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So the oyster was the basis

61
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
for a manifesto-like urban design project

62
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that I did about the New York Harbor

63
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
called "oyster-tecture."

64
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And the core idea of oyster-tecture is to harness the biological power

65
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
of mussels, eelgrass and oysters --

66
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
species that live in the harbor --

67
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and, at the same time,

68
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
harness the power of people

69
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
who live in the community

70
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
towards making change now.

71
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Here's a map of my city, New York City,

72
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
showing inundation in red.

73
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And what's circled is the site that I'm going to talk about,

74
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
the Gowanus Canal and Governors Island.

75
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
If you look here at this map,

76
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
showing everything in blue

77
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
is out in the water,

78
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and everything in yellow is upland.

79
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But you can see, even just intuit, from this map,

80
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that the harbor has dredged and flattened,

81
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and went from a rich, three-dimensional mosaic to flat muck

82
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
in really a matter of years.

83
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Another set of views of actually the Gowanus Canal itself.

84
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Now the Gowanus is particularly smelly -- I will admit it.

85
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
There are problems of sewage overflow

86
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and contamination,

87
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
but I would also argue that almost every city

88
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
has this exact condition,

89
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and it's a condition that we're all facing.

90
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And here's a map of that condition,

91
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
showing the contaminants in yellow and green,

92
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
exacerbated by this new flow of

93
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
storm-surge and sea-level rise.

94
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So we really had a lot to deal with.

95
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
When we started this project,

96
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
one of the core ideas was to look back in history

97
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and try to understand what was there.

98
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And you can see from this map,

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
there's this incredible geographical signature

100
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
of a series of islands

101
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
that were out in the harbor

102
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and a matrix of salt marshes and beaches

103
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that served as natural wave attenuation

104
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
for the upland settlement.

105
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
We also learned at this time

106
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
that you could eat an oyster about the size of a dinner plate

107
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
in the Gowanus Canal itself.

108
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
So our concept is really this back-to-the-future concept,

109
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
harnessing the intelligence of that land settlement pattern.

110
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And the idea has two core stages.

111
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
One is to develop a new artificial ecology,

112
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
a reef out in the harbor,

113
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
that would then protect new settlement patterns

114
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
inland and the Gowanus.

115
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Because if you have cleaner water and slower water,

116
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
you can imagine a new way of living with that water.

117
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
So the project really addresses these three core issues

118
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in a new and exciting way, I think.

119
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Here we are, back to our hero, the oyster.

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And again, it's this incredibly exciting animal.

121
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
It accepts algae and detritus in one end,

122
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and through this beautiful, glamorous

123
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
set of stomach organs,

124
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
out the other end comes cleaner water.

125
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And one oyster can filter up to 50 gallons of water a day.

126
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Oyster reefs also covered

127
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
about a quarter of our harbor

128
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and were capable of filtering water in the harbor in a matter of days.

129
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They were key in our culture and our economy.

130
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Basically, New York was built

131
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
on the backs of oystermen,

132
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and our streets were literally built over oyster shells.

133
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This image

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is an image of an oyster cart,

135
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
which is now as ubiquitous as the hotdog cart is today.

136
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So again, we got the short end of the deal there.

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
(Laughter)

138
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Finally, oysters can attenuate

139
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and agglomerate onto each other

140
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and form these amazing natural reef structures.

141
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
They really become nature's wave attenuators.

142
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And they become the bedrock

143
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of any harbor ecosystem.

144
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Many, many species depend on them.

145
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So we were inspired by the oyster,

146
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
but I was also inspired by the life cycle of the oyster.

147
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It can move from a fertilized egg

148
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to a spat, which is when they're floating through the water,

149
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and when they're ready to attach onto another oyster,

150
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to an adult male oyster or female oyster,

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
in a number of weeks.

152
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
We reinterpreted this life cycle

153
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
on the scale of our sight

154
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and took the Gowanus

155
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
as a giant oyster nursery

156
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
where oysters would be grown up in the Gowanus,

157
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
then paraded down in their spat stage

158
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and seeded out on the Bayridge Reef.

159
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And so the core idea here

160
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
was to hit the reset button

161
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and regenerate an ecology over time

162
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
that was regenerative and cleaning

163
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and productive.

164
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
How does the reef work? Well, it's very, very simple.

165
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
A core concept here

166
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
is that climate change

167
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
isn't something that --

168
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the answers won't land down from the Moon.

169
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And with a $20 billion price tag,

170
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
we should simply start and get to work with what we have now

171
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and what's in front of us.

172
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
So this image is simply showing --

173
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
it's a field of marine piles

174
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
interconnected with this woven fuzzy rope.

175
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
What is fuzzy rope, you ask?

176
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
It's just that; it's this very inexpensive thing,

177
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
available practically at your hardware store, and it's very cheap.

178
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
So we imagine that we would actually

179
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
potentially even host a bake sale

180
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
to start our new project.

181
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
(Laughter)

182
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So in the studio, rather than drawing,

183
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
we began to learn how to knit.

184
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
The concept was to really knit this rope together

185
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and develop this new soft infrastructure

186
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
for the oysters to grow on.

187
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You can see in the diagram how it grows over time

188
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
from an infrastructural space

189
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
into a new public urban space.

190
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And that grows over time dynamically

191
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
with the threat of climate change.

192
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
It also creates this incredibly interesting, I think,

193
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
new amphibious public space,

194
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
where you can imagine working,

195
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
you can imagine recreating in a new way.

196
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
In the end, what we realized we were making

197
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
was a new blue-green watery park

198
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
for the next watery century --

199
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
an amphibious park, if you will.

200
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So get your Tevas on.

201
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
So you can imagine scuba diving here.

202
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
This is an image of high school students,

203
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
scuba divers that we worked with on our team.

204
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
So you can imagine a sort of new manner of living

205
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
with a new relationship with the water,

206
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and also a hybridizing of recreational and science programs

207
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
in terms of monitoring.

208
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Another new vocabulary word for the brave new world:

209
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
this is the word "flupsy" --

210
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
it's short for "floating upwelling system."

211
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And this glorious, readily available device

212
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
is basically a floating raft

213
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
with an oyster nursery below.

214
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So the water is churned through this raft.

215
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
You can see the eight chambers on the side

216
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
host little baby oysters and essentially force-feed them.

217
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
So rather than having 10 oysters,

218
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
you have 10,000 oysters.

219
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And then those spat are then seeded.

220
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Here's the Gowanus future

221
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
with the oyster rafts on the shorelines --

222
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
the flupsification of the Gowanus.

223
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
New word.

224
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
And also showing oyster gardening for the community

225
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
along its edges.

226
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
And finally, how much fun it would be

227
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
to watch the flupsy parade

228
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and cheer on the oyster spats

229
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
as they go down to the reef.

230
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I get asked two questions about this project.

231
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
One is: why isn't it happening now?

232
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And the second one is: when can we eat the oysters?

233
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
And the answer is: not yet, they're working.

234
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But we imagine, with our calculations,

235
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that by 2050,

236
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
you might be able to sink your teeth into a Gowanus oyster.

237
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
To conclude, this is just one cross-section

238
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
of one piece of city,

239
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but my dream is, my hope is,

240
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that when you all go back to your own cities

241
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
that we can start to work together and collaborate

242
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
on remaking and reforming

243
0:09:47.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
a new urban landscape

244
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
towards a more sustainable, a more livable

245
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and a more delicious future.

246
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Thank you.

247
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
(Applause)

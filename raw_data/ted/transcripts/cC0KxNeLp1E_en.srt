1
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Hi.

2
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
(Laughter)

3
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I did that for two reasons.

4
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
First of all, I wanted to give you

5
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a good visual first impression.

6
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
But the main reason I did it is that

7
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
that's what happens to me when I'm forced to wear

8
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
a Lady Gaga skanky mic.

9
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I'm used to a stationary mic.

11
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It's the sensible shoe of public address.

12
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But you clamp this thing on my head, and something happens.

14
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I just become skanky.

15
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter) So I'm sorry about that.

16
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And I'm already off-message.

17
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Ladies and gentlemen,

19
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I have devoted the past 25 years of my life

20
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to designing books.

21
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
("Yes, BOOKS. You know, the bound volumes with ink on paper.

22
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
You cannot turn them off with a switch.

23
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Tell your kids.")

24
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
It all sort of started as a benign mistake,

25
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
like penicillin. (Laughter)

26
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
What I really wanted

27
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
was to be a graphic designer

28
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
at one of the big design firms in New York City.

29
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But upon arrival there,

30
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
in the fall of 1986, and doing a lot of interviews,

31
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
I found that the only thing I was offered

32
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
was to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf,

33
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
a book publisher.

34
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Now I was stupid,

35
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
but not so stupid that I turned it down.

36
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
I had absolutely no idea

37
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
what I was about to become part of,

38
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and I was incredibly lucky.

39
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Soon, it had occurred to me what my job was.

40
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
My job was to ask this question:

41
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
"What do the stories look like?"

42
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Because that is what Knopf is.

43
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
It is the story factory, one of the very best in the world.

44
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We bring stories to the public.

45
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The stories can be anything,

46
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and some of them are actually true.

47
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
But they all have one thing in common:

48
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
They all need to look like something.

49
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
They all need a face.

50
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Why? To give you a first impression

51
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
of what you are about to get into.

52
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
A book designer gives form to content,

53
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
but also

54
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
manages a very careful balance between the two.

55
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Now, the first day

56
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
of my graphic design training at Penn State University,

57
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
the teacher, Lanny Sommese, came into the room

58
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard,

59
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and wrote the word "Apple" underneath,

60
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and he said, "OK. Lesson one. Listen up."

61
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And he covered up the picture and he said,

62
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
"You either say this," and then he covered up the word,

63
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"or you show this.

64
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But you don't do this."

65
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Because this is treating your audience like a moron.

66
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And they deserve better.

68
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
And lo and behold, soon enough,

69
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I was able to put this theory to the test

70
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
on two books that I was working on for Knopf.

71
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
The first was Katharine Hepburn's memoirs,

72
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich.

73
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
Now the Hepburn book

74
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
was written in a very conversational style,

75
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you.

76
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The Dietrich book was an observation

77
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
by her daughter; it was a biography.

78
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So the Hepburn story is words

79
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and the Dietrich story is pictures, and so we did this.

80
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So there you are.

81
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Pure content and pure form, side by side.

82
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
No fighting, ladies.

83
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
("What's a Jurassic Park?")

84
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, what is the story here?

85
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Someone

86
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
is re-engineering dinosaurs

87
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
by extracting their DNA

88
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
from prehistoric amber.

89
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Genius!

90
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Now, luckily for me,

92
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I live and work in New York City,

93
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
where there are plenty of dinosaurs.

94
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So,

96
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I went to the Museum of Natural History,

97
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and I checked out the bones, and I went to the gift shop,

98
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and I bought a book.

99
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And I was particularly taken with this page of the book,

100
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and more specifically the lower right-hand corner.

101
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Now I took this diagram,

102
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and I put it in a Photostat machine,

103
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
(Laughter)

104
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and I took a piece of tracing paper,

105
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
and I taped it over the Photostat

106
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
with a piece of Scotch tape -- stop me if I'm going too fast --

107
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
(Laughter) --

108
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and then I took a Rapidograph pen --

109
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
explain it to the youngsters --

110
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur.

112
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
I had no idea what I was doing,

113
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I had no idea where I was going,

114
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but at some point, I stopped --

115
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
when to keep going would seem like I was going too far.

116
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
And what I ended up with was a graphic representation

117
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
of us seeing this animal coming into being.

118
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
We're in the middle of the process.

119
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And then I just threw some typography on it.

120
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Very basic stuff,

121
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
slightly suggestive of public park signage.

122
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
(Laughter)

123
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Everybody in house loved it,

124
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
and so off it goes to the author.

125
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
And even back then,

126
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Michael was on the cutting edge.

127
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
("Michael Crichton responds by fax:")

128
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
("Wow! Fucking Fantastic Jacket")

129
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

130
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine.

131
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
(Laughter)

132
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
I miss Michael.

133
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
And sure enough, somebody from MCA Universal

134
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
calls our legal department to see if they can

135
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
maybe look into buying the rights to the image,

136
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
just in case they might want to use it.

137
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Well, they used it.

138
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

139
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And I was thrilled.

140
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
We all know it was an amazing movie,

141
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and it was so interesting to see it

142
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
go out into the culture and become this phenomenon

143
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and to see all the different permutations of it.

144
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
But not too long ago,

145
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
I came upon this on the Web.

146
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
No, that is not me.

147
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
But whoever it is,

148
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I can't help but thinking they woke up one day like,

149
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
"Oh my God, that wasn't there last night. Ooooohh!

150
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I was so wasted."

151
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
(Laughter)

152
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But if you think about it, from my head

153
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to my hands to his leg.

154
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Laughter)

155
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
That's a responsibility.

156
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
And it's a responsibility that I don't take lightly.

157
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
The book designer's responsibility is threefold:

158
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to the reader, to the publisher and, most of all, to the author.

159
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
I want you to look at the author's book

160
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and say, "Wow! I need to read that."

161
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
David Sedaris is one of my favorite writers,

162
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and the title essay

163
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony.

164
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And the reason he went is because

165
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
he had a fear of his body image,

166
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and he wanted to explore what was underlying that.

167
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
For me, it was simply an excuse to design a book

168
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that you could literally take the pants off of.

169
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
But when you do,

170
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
you don't get what you expect.

171
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
You get something that goes much deeper than that.

172
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
And David especially loved this design

173
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
because at book signings, which he does a lot of,

174
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
he could take a magic marker and do this.

175
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Laughter)

176
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Hello!

177
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
(Laughter)

178
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir

179
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
called ["Dry"], and it's about his time in rehab.

180
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
In his 20s, he was a hotshot ad executive,

181
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and as Mad Men has told us, a raging alcoholic.

182
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
He did not think so, however,

183
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
but his coworkers did an intervention and they said,

184
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
"You are going to rehab, or you will be fired and you will die."

185
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
Now to me, this was always going to be a typographic solution,

186
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
what I would call the opposite of Type 101.

187
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
What does that mean?

188
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography,

189
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
you get the assignment of, select a word

190
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and make it look like what it says it is. So that's Type 101, right?

191
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Very simple stuff.

192
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
This is going to be the opposite of that.

193
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I want this book to look like it's lying to you,

194
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
desperately and hopelessly, the way an alcoholic would.

195
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine.

196
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
I set up the type, I printed it out on an Epson printer

197
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
with water-soluble ink, taped it to the wall

198
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and threw a bucket of water at it. Presto!

199
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Then when we went to press,

200
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
the printer put a spot gloss on the ink

201
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and it really looked like it was running.

202
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
Not long after it came out, Augusten was waylaid in an airport

203
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and he was hiding out in the bookstore

204
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
spying on who was buying his books.

205
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
And this woman came up to it,

206
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and she squinted, and she took it to the register,

207
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and she said to the man behind the counter, "This one's ruined."

208
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
(Laughter)

209
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And the guy behind the counter said, "I know, lady. They all came in that way."

210
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
(Laughter)

211
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Now, that's a good printing job.

212
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
A book cover

213
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
is a distillation.

214
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It is a haiku,

215
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
if you will, of the story.

216
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
This particular story

217
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
by Osama Tezuka

218
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
is his epic life of the Buddha,

219
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
and it's eight volumes in all. But the best thing is

220
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
when it's on your shelf, you get a shelf life

221
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
of the Buddha, moving from one age to the next.

222
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
All of these solutions

223
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
derive their origins from the text of the book,

224
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
but once the book designer has read the text,

225
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
then he has to be an interpreter

226
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
and a translator.

227
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
This story was a real puzzle.

228
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
This is what it's about.

229
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
("Intrigue and murder among 16th century Ottoman court painters.")

230
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Laughter)

231
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
All right, so I got a collection of the paintings together

232
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and I looked at them and I deconstructed them

233
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and I put them back together.

234
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And so, here's the design, right?

235
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And so here's the front and the spine, and it's flat.

236
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
But the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf.

237
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Ahh! We come upon them,

238
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
the clandestine lovers. Let's draw them out.

239
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Huhh! They've been discovered by the sultan.

240
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
He will not be pleased.

241
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Huhh! And now the sultan is in danger.

242
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And now, we have to open it up

243
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
to find out what's going to happen next.

244
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Try experiencing that on a Kindle.

245
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Laughter)

246
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Don't get me started.

247
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Seriously.

248
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Much is to be gained by eBooks:

249
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
ease, convenience, portability.

250
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
But something is definitely lost: tradition,

251
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
a sensual experience, the comfort of thingy-ness --

252
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
a little bit of humanity.

253
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Do you know what John Updike used to do

254
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
the first thing when he would get a copy

255
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
of one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf?

256
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
He'd smell it.

257
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Then he'd run his hand over the rag paper,

258
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages.

259
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
All those years, all those books, he never got tired of it.

260
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Now, I am all for the iPad,

261
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
but trust me -- smelling it will get you nowhere.

262
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
(Laughter)

263
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
Now the Apple guys are texting,

264
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
"Develop odor emission plug-in."

265
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Laughter)

266
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And the last story I'm going to talk about is quite a story.

267
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
A woman

268
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
named Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself

269
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
negotiating down a spiral staircase

270
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
off an elevated highway. When she gets to the bottom,

271
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
she can't help but feel that, all of a sudden,

272
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
she's entered a new reality

273
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
that's just slightly different from the one that she left,

274
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
but very similar, but different.

275
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And so, we're talking about parallel planes of existence,

276
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers.

277
0:14:41.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So how do we show this?

278
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
We go back to Hepburn and Dietrich, but now we merge them.

279
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
So we're talking about different planes, different pieces of paper.

280
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum.

281
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
It's one part of the form and content.

282
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
When it's on top of the paper board,

283
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
which is the opposite, it forms this.

284
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So even if you don't know anything about this book,

285
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
you are forced to consider a single person

286
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
straddling two planes of existence.

287
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And the object itself invited exploration

288
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
interaction, consideration

289
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and touch.

290
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
This debuted at number two

291
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
on the New York Times Best Seller list.

292
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
This is unheard of,

293
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
both for us the publisher, and the author.

294
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We're talking a 900-page book

295
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
that is as weird as it is compelling,

296
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
and featuring a climactic scene

297
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
in which a horde of tiny people

298
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl

299
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and cause a German Shepherd to explode.

300
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
(Laughter)

301
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
Not exactly Jackie Collins.

302
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Fourteen weeks on the Best Seller list,

303
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
eight printings, and still going strong.

304
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
So even though we love publishing as an art,

305
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
we very much know it's a business too,

306
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky,

307
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
that great art can be great business.

308
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
So that's my story. To be continued.

309
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
What does it look like?

310
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
Yes. It can, it does and it will,

311
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
but for this book designer,

312
0:16:30.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
page-turner,

313
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
dog-eared place-holder,

314
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
notes in the margins-taker,

315
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
ink-sniffer,

316
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
the story looks like this.

317
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Thank you.

318
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:52,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Dan Holzman: Please throw out the beanbag chairs. Here we go.

2
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
Barry Friedman: There are all kinds of high-tech chairs here today,

3
0:00:24.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
but this is really, I think, when it reached its peak

4
0:00:26.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
as far as ergonomics, comfort, design, flexibility ...

5
0:00:32.33,000 --> 0:00:35,000
DH: Now obviously, this is not something we do on our regular show;

6
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:37,000
it's something we just kind of learned for this,

7
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:42,000
so we're going to try. But can we have some inspirational music for the beanbag chairs?

8
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:22,000
BF: Nice show, Daniel, nice show. You are the man!

9
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Nice show. Man, that was good!

10
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
DH: Thank you.

11
0:01:30.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
BF: You know, sometimes when people do those, they go all the way down.

12
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You actually just did that. (Laughter)

13
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
That's the kind of extra effort that's gotten us where we are today ...

14
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
DH: All right, let's show them something special.

15
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
BF: ... without a MacArthur grant.

16
0:01:45.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Yeah, look at this. You know, all kinds of different ...

17
0:01:50.33,000 --> 0:01:52,000
TED is about invention, let's be honest. Right? DH: Yeah, it is.

18
0:01:52.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
BF: Last night, Michael Moschen showed some juggling props

19
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
he has invented and working on.

20
0:01:56.33,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Right now, Dan's going to show something he actually invented.

21
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:01,000
DH: A type of juggling I actually invented,

22
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
right after I saw another juggler do it.

23
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
BF: Shut up. (Laughter)

24
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:08,000
DH: And this is a small excerpt from a longer piece.

25
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
(Laughter)

26
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:18,000
(Applause)

27
0:02:18.33,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Folks, this is shaker cup juggling. It's not a showstopper

28
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
but it certainly slows it down.

29
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:27,000
BF: Oh yeah, it does. (Drum roll)

30
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
BF: Oh, Daniel.

31
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
(Applause)

32
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:49,000
DH: One more? (Drum roll)

33
0:02:50.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Perfect. (Drum roll)

34
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Perfect. (Drum roll)

35
0:03:00.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
BF: OK. DH: Oh! All right.

36
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:05,000
(Applause)

37
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I'm now pushing my luck: I'm skipping right to six cups.

38
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:14,000
In order to do six cups, I must have perfect control

39
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
over three with my right hand. (Drum roll)

40
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
BF: Also three with his left.

41
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
DH: Perfect.

42
0:03:23.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
(Laughter)

43
0:03:29.33,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And now, all six cups. Should I do it on the first try

44
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
or should I miss once on purpose? (Laughter)

45
0:03:38.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
BF: First try? Once on purpose?

46
0:03:40.33,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Audience: Once on purpose!)

47
0:03:42.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
DH: How about if I try first and then decide?

48
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
BF: Good idea. (Laughter) Let's leave that. We'll leave that door open.

49
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:57,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

50
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
DH: He's looking at me.

51
0:04:08.33,000 --> 0:04:12,000
BF: That's all right, he does that. All right.

52
0:04:12.33,000 --> 0:04:15,000
DH: Oh! It's time for Richard's help. (Laughter)

53
0:04:15.33,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Oh, good. All right.

54
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:2,000
BF: You know, over the years, every year at the conference,

55
0:04:20.33,000 --> 0:04:24,000
it's kind of become a tradition for us to do something dangerous

56
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
with Richard. And we've always done something with the bullwhips

57
0:04:28.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
in our act. It's funny, for years I did it with Daniel holding balloons.

58
0:04:31.33,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And then we thought, "How stupid."

59
0:04:33.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
DH: Excuse me, could we work on the design of the microphone?

60
0:04:36.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
BF: I think that's the next session.

61
0:04:38.33,000 --> 0:04:39,000
DH: Next session?

62
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
BF: Yeah. And so we've actually found a way to incorporate Richard in this.

63
0:04:43.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
He actually assumes more of the danger in this.

64
0:04:46.33,000 --> 0:04:48,000
DH: Please stand up, Richard. (Whip cracks)

65
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Oh, sorry. (Laughter)

66
0:04:54.33,000 --> 0:04:56,000
DH: Now Richard, please ... (Whip cracks)

67
0:04:56.33,000 --> 0:04:58,000
BF: OK, sorry.

68
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:01,000
DH: Jesus Christ. Richard, please stand in front of me.

69
0:05:01.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Richard Wurman: Can I say something?

70
0:05:02.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
BF: Sure.

71
0:05:05.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
RW: In all past years I've rehearsed with them,

72
0:05:07.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the things that have happened to me --

73
0:05:09.33,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I have no idea what's going to happen and that's the truth.

74
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
DH: All right, please stand here in front ...

75
0:05:15.33,000 --> 0:05:2,000
God, I hate that. Put your hands out like this, please.

76
0:05:20.33,000 --> 0:05:25,000
(Laughter)

77
0:05:25.33,000 --> 0:05:27,000
BF: No, come stay up with him.

78
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Dan used to actually hold them but now he's got you for protection.

79
0:05:31.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It's kind of neat. OK.

80
0:05:33.33,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Laughter)

81
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
DH: Wow, you've been working out.

82
0:05:38.33,000 --> 0:05:4,000
BF: No, shut up!

83
0:05:40.33,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

84
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Having a little bit of Richard time. That's nice, that's good.

85
0:05:48.33,000 --> 0:05:5,000
OK, here we go.

86
0:05:50.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Have him hold your wrist so I can ...

87
0:05:51.33,000 --> 0:05:53,000
DH: Please hold my wrist, will you. BF: Yeah, hold this a minute.

88
0:05:53.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
There you go.

89
0:05:54.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Laughter)

90
0:05:56.33,000 --> 0:05:58,000
OK.

91
0:06:02.33,000 --> 0:06:04,000
OK, hold on.

92
0:06:06.33,000 --> 0:06:08,000
RW: Hmmm.

93
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
(Laughter)

94
0:06:09.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
DH: First one.

95
0:06:11.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
BF: All those mid-year phone calls are coming back to me now, Richard.

96
0:06:14.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

97
0:06:17.33,000 --> 0:06:21,000
DH: So Richard, what were we on the list? Like 1,020?

98
0:06:21.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
(Laughter)

99
0:06:22.33,000 --> 0:06:24,000
What happened there?

100
0:06:24.33,000 --> 0:06:26,000
BF: I think we were just outside.

101
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:28,000
DH: I don't get it. (Applause)

102
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

103
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
DH: Sorry. BF: Having some bad flashbacks.

104
0:06:34.33,000 --> 0:06:36,000
RW: Do you want me to hold you or not? DH: Don't hold me that hard.

105
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
BF: Here we go, I'm taking it. (Balloon pops) (Applause)

106
0:06:39.33,000 --> 0:06:4,000
DH: One more, one more.

107
0:06:40.33,000 --> 0:06:42,000
BF: We've got one more we're going to do.

108
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:43,000
RW: Do I get to hold them?

109
0:06:43.33,000 --> 0:06:46,000
BF: You don't want to hold these, trust me.

110
0:06:46.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
DH: Could you spread your legs a little bit?

111
0:06:48.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Laughter)

112
0:06:55.33,000 --> 0:06:57,000
BF: Gloria, you want to do it? It's very cool.

113
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Laughter)

114
0:06:58.33,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Applause)

115
0:07:02.33,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Laughter)

116
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
One more try. Man, I don't want to get too close.

117
0:07:17.33,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Laughter)

118
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Could you just push that?

119
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:25,000
(Applause)

120
0:07:41.33,000 --> 0:07:44,000
DH: Wow! Boy!

121
0:07:44.33,000 --> 0:07:46,000
BF: That's cool. I always wanted to try that.

122
0:07:46.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
(Laughter)

123
0:07:50.33,000 --> 0:07:52,000
DH: Let's jump this way, though.

124
0:07:52.33,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Now, we risked Richard's life, it's only fair we risk our own lives.

125
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
So to do that, I will juggle these three razor-sharp sickles.

126
0:08:03.33,000 --> 0:08:06,000
And if that wasn't enough, and judging by your response, it's not ...

127
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
(Laughter)

128
0:08:08.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
DH: Wow! BF: Hoping for a little more build.

129
0:08:10.33,000 --> 0:08:12,000
DH: True. Barry ...

130
0:08:12.33,000 --> 0:08:14,000
BF: I'm going to run up behind him.

131
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
DH: Leap over my shoulder.

132
0:08:15.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
BF: Up and over his shoulders.

133
0:08:17.33,000 --> 0:08:2,000
DH: Grab the blades in mid-air, land right there in a pool of blood ...

134
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

135
0:08:22.33,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Still juggling. (Laughter)

136
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Impossible, you say?

137
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:3,000
BF: Incredible, you say?

138
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:33,000
DH: Why bother, you say?

139
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
BF: Here we go.

140
0:08:34.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
DH: Just do it juggler boys, you say?

141
0:08:37.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
BF: This guy, this guy invented air.

142
0:08:40.33,000 --> 0:08:41,000
DH: I think so, that's right.

143
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Even the pencil.

144
0:08:43.33,000 --> 0:08:45,000
BF: He invented the pencil.

145
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:47,000
DH: All right, we'll do this trick, but please remember

146
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
it took us over 10 years to perfect.

147
0:08:49.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
BF: Ten years to perfect, which you're about to see.

148
0:08:51.33,000 --> 0:08:55,000
DH: It's not that difficult, we just don't like to practice that much.

149
0:08:55.33,000 --> 0:08:56,000
BF: No, it's a hassle. Traveling too much.

150
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Actually, we will take a second to prove --

151
0:08:58.33,000 --> 0:09:01,000
this could be fake -- that the blades are indeed razor-sharp.

152
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:03,000
DH: Will someone please throw a small farm animal

153
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
up onto the stage?

154
0:09:06.33,000 --> 0:09:1,000
(Laughter)

155
0:09:10.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Or a virgin for a sacrifice?

156
0:09:12.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
BF: Anything?

157
0:09:14.33,000 --> 0:09:15,000
DH: Where's Gloria? (Laughter)

158
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
BF: No, she's got ... farm animal.

159
0:09:18.33,000 --> 0:09:2,000
DH: Do you have a small farm animal?

160
0:09:20.33,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Just trying to play the odds. All right, here we go.

161
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:24,000
BF: Over the top, over the top.

162
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:26,000
DH: How you feeling, Barry? You feeling all right?

163
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
BF: Yeah, it's all right.

164
0:09:27.33,000 --> 0:09:28,000
DH: Do you feel everything's OK? The atmosphere, the ...

165
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:29,000
BF: Yeah, a little sketchy.

166
0:09:29.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
DH: Everything up here's OK?

167
0:09:30.33,000 --> 0:09:31,000
BF: Yeah.

168
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
DH: Then here we go.

169
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
BF: This one's a little ... Who's doing the lights? Could you

170
0:09:37.33,000 --> 0:09:39,000
point that a little more directly

171
0:09:39.33,000 --> 0:09:44,000
into my eyeballs? Is that possible? (Laughter) I can still see a little.

172
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:49,000
DH: And turn up the intensity; we're still pink in the middle.

173
0:09:49.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We went too far. (Laughter)

174
0:09:50.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
BF: Yeah, it's too far. It's too much of a visual.

175
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:58,000
The design of the body is a whole different thing.

176
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:10:,000
DH: Ready, Barry? BF: Over the top.

177
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
DH: May we have our jumping music please? (Silence)

178
0:10:03.33,000 --> 0:10:05,000
May we have it a bit louder?

179
0:10:05.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
(Laughter)

180
0:10:06.33,000 --> 0:10:08,000
BF: They're a good crew! Whoa!

181
0:10:18.33,000 --> 0:10:22,000
DH: Whoa, sorry. All right.

182
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:26,000
BF: We're going on.

183
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
DH: All right, we'll try again.

184
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:34,000
BF: All right? Oh my gosh. Oh.

185
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:36,000
DH: All right, here we go. Sorry about that.

186
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
BF: I thought I had the hard part. OK.

187
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
DH: Whenever you're ready.

188
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
BF: There we go!

189
0:10:46.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Applause)

190
0:10:48.33,000 --> 0:10:56,000
All right, get up! Come on and dance! DH: Dance, come on. BF: Come on and dance!

191
0:10:56.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Somebody dance! Come on!

192
0:10:59.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Applause)

193
0:11:04.33,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Wow, wow, OK, stop.

194
0:11:06.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Weird, no one dances. We're two guys doing this. (Laughter)

195
0:11:10.33,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I think that's uncomfortable for everyone.

196
0:11:12.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
DH: The French judge ...

197
0:11:13.33,000 --> 0:11:14,000
BF: One more quick thing.

198
0:11:14.33,000 --> 0:11:16,000
DH: The French judge gives it a 5.2.

199
0:11:16.33,000 --> 0:11:22,000
(Laughter)

200
0:11:22.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
BF: Well, you know ...

201
0:11:24.33,000 --> 0:11:26,000
DH: There you go ... BF: Oh, yeah. Another one coming in.

202
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:27,000
DH: Tell them about our bio and stuff.

203
0:11:27.33,000 --> 0:11:29,000
BF: Yeah. In our bio, some of you may have read

204
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:31,000
that we've won two world juggling championships.

205
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And believe it or not, you don't win juggling champions

206
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:36,000
for doing things with bullwhips or shaker cups.

207
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:38,000
We're going to show you right now

208
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
an excerpt from a routine that we used

209
0:11:41.33,000 --> 0:11:43,000
to wipe out the other juggling team competition.

210
0:11:43.33,000 --> 0:11:45,000
DH: That's right.

211
0:11:49.33,000 --> 0:11:51,000
BF: Good.

212
0:11:52.33,000 --> 0:11:56,000
DH: I know what you're thinking: other juggling teams must really suck.

213
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:12:,000
(Laughter)

214
0:12:01.33,000 --> 0:12:03,000
BF: Juggling's got a bad rap.

215
0:12:06.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
DH: But wait, Barry, there's still one more club lying there by my foot.

216
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:14,000
And look, it has a twin!

217
0:12:14.33,000 --> 0:12:19,000
BF: Shut up. (Laughter)

218
0:12:19.33,000 --> 0:12:22,000
DH: There's still one more by my foot.

219
0:12:22.33,000 --> 0:12:25,000
What do you want me to do with it?

220
0:12:27.33,000 --> 0:12:31,000
BF: Richard you tell him, it's your last year. (Laughter)

221
0:12:31.33,000 --> 0:12:33,000
DH: That's a pretty good setup, Richard.

222
0:12:33.33,000 --> 0:12:35,000
BF: Yeah, it's a good setup. That's a big setup.

223
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:42,000
DH: You can't get any better than that. All right. What I will do: I will use my panther-like reflexes.

224
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:44,000
BF: Nice.

225
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
DH: I got that --

226
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
to reach down and grab that club in my grip of steel.

227
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
BF: Nice.

228
0:12:56.33,000 --> 0:12:59,000
DH: I touched it, Barry. That should be enough.

229
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:01,000
BF: It's progress, that's the thing.

230
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:04,000
(Laughter)

231
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
DH: How about that? I'll do it again.

232
0:13:09.33,000 --> 0:13:13,000
Oh wait, it's on your side, Barry.

233
0:13:13.33,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And it's awfully windy over there.

234
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:17,000
BF: It is, it's weird. You wouldn't think

235
0:13:17.33,000 --> 0:13:2,000
it would affect half the stage, but it is. It's weird.

236
0:13:20.33,000 --> 0:13:23,000
Watch this: what I'm going to do is slide the seventh one onto my foot.

237
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
DH: Wow! What a great trick, Barry!

238
0:13:26.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Oh, look how it lies there.

239
0:13:31.33,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Oh, Barry, is there nothing you can't do?

240
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:37,000
(Laughter)

241
0:13:38.33,000 --> 0:13:42,000
You are my hero. You're my Jim Shea, Jr.

242
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Too much Olympics.

243
0:13:45.33,000 --> 0:13:48,000
BF: From my foot, I'll attempt to kick the seventh club. Here we go.

244
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:52,000
DH: Where, Barry? Where? Tell us, Barry.

245
0:13:52.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
[Unclear] eagerly awaits your next syllable. What will it be?

246
0:13:56.33,000 --> 0:13:58,000
What gem of knowledge?

247
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:14:01,000
What pearl of wisdom?

248
0:14:01.33,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Do you want to buy a vowel, Barry?

249
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Is that your final answer?

250
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:14,000
BF: All right! You have to turn off the TV from time to time.

251
0:14:14.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
DH: I do, I do.

252
0:14:15.33,000 --> 0:14:17,000
BF: From my foot, the kick up in the seven.

253
0:14:17.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
DH: We will juggle seven.

254
0:14:19.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
BF: From six to seven. DH: That's a world's record. BF: Really? DH: For us.

255
0:14:21.33,000 --> 0:14:22,000
BF: Yes.

256
0:14:26.33,000 --> 0:14:28,000
DH: Whenever you're ready there, big guy.

257
0:14:28.33,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Put your tongue away, Barry.

258
0:14:32.33,000 --> 0:14:35,000
BF: Oh, oh, whoa.

259
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:42,000
(Applause)

260
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
DH: Please, please stay seated. Stay seated. Thank you.

261
0:14:50.33,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Because now, to make this twice as difficult,

262
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:54,000
we'll juggle the seven clubs back ...

263
0:14:54.33,000 --> 0:14:56,000
BF: Seven-club juggling.

264
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:58,000
DH: ... to back.

265
0:15:03.33,000 --> 0:15:06,000
BF: Thank you, that's it.

266
0:15:24.33,000 --> 0:15:26,000
BF: Thank you guys!

267
0:15:26.33,000 --> 0:15:28,000
DH: Thank you very much!

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I will start by posing a little bit of a challenge:

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
the challenge of dealing with data,

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
data that we have to deal with

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in medical situations.

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
It's really a huge challenge for us.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
And this is our beast of burden --

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
this is a Computer Tomography machine,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a CT machine.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It's a fantastic device.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
It uses X-rays, X-ray beams,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that are rotating very fast around the human body.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
It takes about 30 seconds to go through the whole machine

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and is generating enormous amounts of information

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that comes out of the machine.

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So this is a fantastic machine

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
that we can use

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
for improving health care,

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but as I said, it's also a challenge for us.

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And the challenge is really found in this picture here.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
It's the medical data explosion

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
that we're having right now.

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We're facing this problem.

23
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And let me step back in time.

24
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Let's go back a few years in time and see what happened back then.

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
These machines that came out --

26
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
they started coming in the 1970s --

27
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
they would scan human bodies,

28
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and they would generate about 100 images

29
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
of the human body.

30
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And I've taken the liberty, just for clarity,

31
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to translate that to data slices.

32
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
That would correspond to about 50 megabytes of data,

33
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
which is small

34
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
when you think about the data we can handle today

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
just on normal mobile devices.

36
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
If you translate that to phone books,

37
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
it's about one meter of phone books in the pile.

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Looking at what we're doing today

39
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
with these machines that we have,

40
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
we can, just in a few seconds,

41
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
get 24,000 images out of a body,

42
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and that would correspond to about 20 gigabytes of data,

43
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
or 800 phone books,

44
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and the pile would then be 200 meters of phone books.

45
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
What's about to happen --

46
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and we're seeing this; it's beginning --

47
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
a technology trend that's happening right now

48
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is that we're starting to look at time-resolved situations as well.

49
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So we're getting the dynamics out of the body as well.

50
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And just assume

51
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
that we will be collecting data during five seconds,

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and that would correspond to one terabyte of data --

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that's 800,000 books

54
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and 16 kilometers of phone books.

55
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
That's one patient, one data set.

56
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And this is what we have to deal with.

57
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So this is really the enormous challenge that we have.

58
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And already today -- this is 25,000 images.

59
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Imagine the days

60
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
when we had radiologists doing this.

61
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
They would put up 25,000 images,

62
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
they would go like this, "25,0000, okay, okay.

63
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
There is the problem."

64
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
They can't do that anymore. That's impossible.

65
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So we have to do something that's a little bit more intelligent than doing this.

66
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
So what we do is that we put all these slices together.

67
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Imagine that you slice your body in all these directions,

68
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and then you try to put the slices back together again

69
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
into a pile of data, into a block of data.

70
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
So this is really what we're doing.

71
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
So this gigabyte or terabyte of data, we're putting it into this block.

72
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
But of course, the block of data

73
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
just contains the amount of X-ray

74
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
that's been absorbed in each point in the human body.

75
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So what we need to do is to figure out a way

76
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
of looking at the things we do want to look at

77
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and make things transparent that we don't want to look at.

78
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So transforming the data set

79
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
into something that looks like this.

80
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And this is a challenge.

81
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
This is a huge challenge for us to do that.

82
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Using computers, even though they're getting faster and better all the time,

83
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
it's a challenge to deal with gigabytes of data,

84
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
terabytes of data

85
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and extracting the relevant information.

86
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
I want to look at the heart.

87
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I want to look at the blood vessels. I want to look at the liver.

88
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Maybe even find a tumor,

89
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
in some cases.

90
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So this is where this little dear comes into play.

91
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This is my daughter.

92
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
This is as of 9 a.m. this morning.

93
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
She's playing a computer game.

94
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
She's only two years old,

95
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and she's having a blast.

96
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So she's really the driving force

97
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
behind the development of graphics-processing units.

98
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
As long as kids are playing computer games,

99
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
graphics is getting better and better and better.

100
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So please go back home, tell your kids to play more games,

101
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
because that's what I need.

102
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So what's inside of this machine

103
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
is what enables me to do the things that I'm doing

104
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
with the medical data.

105
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So really what I'm doing is using these fantastic little devices.

106
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And you know, going back

107
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
maybe 10 years in time

108
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
when I got the funding

109
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to buy my first graphics computer --

110
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
it was a huge machine.

111
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It was cabinets of processors and storage and everything.

112
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I paid about one million dollars for that machine.

113
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
That machine is, today, about as fast as my iPhone.

114
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
So every month there are new graphics cards coming out,

115
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and here is a few of the latest ones from the vendors --

116
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
NVIDIA, ATI, Intel is out there as well.

117
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And you know, for a few hundred bucks

118
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
you can get these things and put them into your computer,

119
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and you can do fantastic things with these graphics cards.

120
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
So this is really what's enabling us

121
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to deal with the explosion of data in medicine,

122
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
together with some really nifty work

123
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
in terms of algorithms --

124
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
compressing data,

125
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
extracting the relevant information that people are doing research on.

126
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
So I'm going to show you a few examples of what we can do.

127
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This is a data set that was captured using a CT scanner.

128
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
You can see that this is a full data [set].

129
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
It's a woman. You can see the hair.

130
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
You can see the individual structures of the woman.

131
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
You can see that there is [a] scattering of X-rays

132
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
on the teeth, the metal in the teeth.

133
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
That's where those artifacts are coming from.

134
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
But fully interactively

135
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
on standard graphics cards on a normal computer,

136
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
I can just put in a clip plane.

137
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
And of course all the data is inside,

138
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
so I can start rotating, I can look at it from different angles,

139
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and I can see that this woman had a problem.

140
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
She had a bleeding up in the brain,

141
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and that's been fixed with a little stent,

142
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
a metal clamp that's tightening up the vessel.

143
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And just by changing the functions,

144
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
then I can decide what's going to be transparent

145
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and what's going to be visible.

146
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
I can look at the skull structure,

147
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and I can see that, okay, this is where they opened up the skull on this woman,

148
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and that's where they went in.

149
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So these are fantastic images.

150
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
They're really high resolution,

151
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and they're really showing us what we can do

152
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
with standard graphics cards today.

153
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Now we have really made use of this,

154
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
and we have tried to squeeze a lot of data

155
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
into the system.

156
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And one of the applications that we've been working on --

157
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and this has gotten a little bit of traction worldwide --

158
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
is the application of virtual autopsies.

159
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So again, looking at very, very large data sets,

160
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and you saw those full-body scans that we can do.

161
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
We're just pushing the body through the whole CT scanner,

162
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and just in a few seconds we can get a full-body data set.

163
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So this is from a virtual autopsy.

164
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
And you can see how I'm gradually peeling off.

165
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
First you saw the body bag that the body came in,

166
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
then I'm peeling off the skin -- you can see the muscles --

167
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and eventually you can see the bone structure of this woman.

168
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now at this point, I would also like to emphasize

169
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that, with the greatest respect

170
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
for the people that I'm now going to show --

171
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
I'm going to show you a few cases of virtual autopsies --

172
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
so it's with great respect for the people

173
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
that have died under violent circumstances

174
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that I'm showing these pictures to you.

175
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
In the forensic case --

176
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
and this is something

177
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that ... there's been approximately 400 cases so far

178
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
just in the part of Sweden that I come from

179
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that has been undergoing virtual autopsies

180
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
in the past four years.

181
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
So this will be the typical workflow situation.

182
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
The police will decide --

183
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
in the evening, when there's a case coming in --

184
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
they will decide, okay, is this a case where we need to do an autopsy?

185
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
So in the morning, in between six and seven in the morning,

186
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
the body is then transported inside of the body bag

187
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
to our center

188
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and is being scanned through one of the CT scanners.

189
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And then the radiologist, together with the pathologist

190
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and sometimes the forensic scientist,

191
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
looks at the data that's coming out,

192
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and they have a joint session.

193
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And then they decide what to do in the real physical autopsy after that.

194
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
Now looking at a few cases,

195
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
here's one of the first cases that we had.

196
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
You can really see the details of the data set.

197
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It's very high-resolution,

198
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and it's our algorithms that allow us

199
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to zoom in on all the details.

200
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And again, it's fully interactive,

201
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
so you can rotate and you can look at things in real time

202
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
on these systems here.

203
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Without saying too much about this case,

204
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
this is a traffic accident,

205
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
a drunk driver hit a woman.

206
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And it's very, very easy to see the damages on the bone structure.

207
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And the cause of death is the broken neck.

208
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And this women also ended up under the car,

209
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
so she's quite badly beaten up

210
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
by this injury.

211
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Here's another case, a knifing.

212
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
And this is also again showing us what we can do.

213
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It's very easy to look at metal artifacts

214
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
that we can show inside of the body.

215
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
You can also see some of the artifacts from the teeth --

216
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that's actually the filling of the teeth --

217
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but because I've set the functions to show me metal

218
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and make everything else transparent.

219
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Here's another violent case. This really didn't kill the person.

220
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
The person was killed by stabs in the heart,

221
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but they just deposited the knife

222
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
by putting it through one of the eyeballs.

223
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
Here's another case.

224
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It's very interesting for us

225
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
to be able to look at things like knife stabbings.

226
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Here you can see that knife went through the heart.

227
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
It's very easy to see how air has been leaking

228
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
from one part to another part,

229
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
which is difficult to do in a normal, standard, physical autopsy.

230
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So it really, really helps

231
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
the criminal investigation

232
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
to establish the cause of death,

233
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and in some cases also directing the investigation in the right direction

234
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
to find out who the killer really was.

235
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Here's another case that I think is interesting.

236
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Here you can see a bullet

237
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
that has lodged just next to the spine on this person.

238
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And what we've done is that we've turned the bullet into a light source,

239
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
so that bullet is actually shining,

240
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and it makes it really easy to find these fragments.

241
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
During a physical autopsy,

242
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
if you actually have to dig through the body to find these fragments,

243
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that's actually quite hard to do.

244
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
One of the things that I'm really, really happy

245
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to be able to show you here today

246
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
is our virtual autopsy table.

247
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
It's a touch device that we have developed

248
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
based on these algorithms, using standard graphics GPUs.

249
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It actually looks like this,

250
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
just to give you a feeling for what it looks like.

251
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
It really just works like a huge iPhone.

252
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
So we've implemented

253
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
all the gestures you can do on the table,

254
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
and you can think of it as an enormous touch interface.

255
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
So if you were thinking of buying an iPad,

256
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
forget about it. This is what you want instead.

257
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Steve, I hope you're listening to this, all right.

258
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
So it's a very nice little device.

259
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So if you have the opportunity, please try it out.

260
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
It's really a hands-on experience.

261
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So it gained some traction, and we're trying to roll this out

262
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and trying to use it for educational purposes,

263
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
but also, perhaps in the future,

264
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
in a more clinical situation.

265
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
There's a YouTube video that you can download and look at this,

266
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
if you want to convey the information to other people

267
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
about virtual autopsies.

268
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Okay, now that we're talking about touch,

269
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
let me move on to really "touching" data.

270
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And this is a bit of science fiction now,

271
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
so we're moving into really the future.

272
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
This is not really what the medical doctors are using right now,

273
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but I hope they will in the future.

274
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So what you're seeing on the left is a touch device.

275
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
It's a little mechanical pen

276
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
that has very, very fast step motors inside of the pen.

277
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And so I can generate a force feedback.

278
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
So when I virtually touch data,

279
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
it will generate forces in the pen, so I get a feedback.

280
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So in this particular situation,

281
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
it's a scan of a living person.

282
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
I have this pen, and I look at the data,

283
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and I move the pen towards the head,

284
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and all of a sudden I feel resistance.

285
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
So I can feel the skin.

286
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
If I push a little bit harder, I'll go through the skin,

287
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and I can feel the bone structure inside.

288
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
If I push even harder, I'll go through the bone structure,

289
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
especially close to the ear where the bone is very soft.

290
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And then I can feel the brain inside, and this will be the slushy like this.

291
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
So this is really nice.

292
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And to take that even further, this is a heart.

293
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And this is also due to these fantastic new scanners,

294
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
that just in 0.3 seconds,

295
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I can scan the whole heart,

296
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and I can do that with time resolution.

297
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So just looking at this heart,

298
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I can play back a video here.

299
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And this is Karljohan, one of my graduate students

300
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
who's been working on this project.

301
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And he's sitting there in front of the Haptic device, the force feedback system,

302
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
and he's moving his pen towards the heart,

303
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
and the heart is now beating in front of him,

304
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
so he can see how the heart is beating.

305
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
He's taken the pen, and he's moving it towards the heart,

306
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and he's putting it on the heart,

307
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and then he feels the heartbeats from the real living patient.

308
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Then he can examine how the heart is moving.

309
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
He can go inside, push inside of the heart,

310
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and really feel how the valves are moving.

311
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And this, I think, is really the future for heart surgeons.

312
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
I mean it's probably the wet dream for a heart surgeon

313
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
to be able to go inside of the patient's heart

314
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
before you actually do surgery,

315
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
and do that with high-quality resolution data.

316
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So this is really neat.

317
0:12:47.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
Now we're going even further into science fiction.

318
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And we heard a little bit about functional MRI.

319
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Now this is really an interesting project.

320
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
MRI is using magnetic fields

321
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
and radio frequencies

322
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
to scan the brain, or any part of the body.

323
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So what we're really getting out of this

324
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
is information of the structure of the brain,

325
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
but we can also measure the difference

326
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
in magnetic properties of blood that's oxygenated

327
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and blood that's depleted of oxygen.

328
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
That means that it's possible

329
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
to map out the activity of the brain.

330
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So this is something that we've been working on.

331
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And you just saw Motts the research engineer, there,

332
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
going into the MRI system,

333
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
and he was wearing goggles.

334
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
So he could actually see things in the goggles.

335
0:13:30.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
So I could present things to him while he's in the scanner.

336
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And this is a little bit freaky,

337
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
because what Motts is seeing is actually this.

338
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
He's seeing his own brain.

339
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
So Motts is doing something here,

340
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and probably he is going like this with his right hand,

341
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
because the left side is activated

342
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
on the motor cortex.

343
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And then he can see that at the same time.

344
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
These visualizations are brand new.

345
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And this is something that we've been researching for a little while.

346
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
This is another sequence of Motts' brain.

347
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
And here we asked Motts to calculate backwards from 100.

348
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
So he's going "100, 97, 94."

349
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And then he's going backwards.

350
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And you can see how the little math processor is working up here in his brain

351
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and is lighting up the whole brain.

352
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Well this is fantastic. We can do this in real time.

353
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
We can investigate things. We can tell him to do things.

354
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
You can also see that his visual cortex

355
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
is activated in the back of the head,

356
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
because that's where he's seeing, he's seeing his own brain.

357
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And he's also hearing our instructions

358
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
when we tell him to do things.

359
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
The signal is really deep inside of the brain as well,

360
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and it's shining through,

361
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
because all of the data is inside this volume.

362
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And in just a second here you will see --

363
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
okay, here. Motts, now move your left foot.

364
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So he's going like this.

365
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
For 20 seconds he's going like that,

366
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
and all of a sudden it lights up up here.

367
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
So we've got motor cortex activation up there.

368
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So this is really, really nice,

369
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and I think this is a great tool.

370
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
And connecting also with the previous talk here,

371
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
this is something that we could use as a tool

372
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
to really understand

373
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
how the neurons are working, how the brain is working,

374
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
and we can do this with very, very high visual quality

375
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
and very fast resolution.

376
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Now we're also having a bit of fun at the center.

377
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
So this is a CAT scan -- Computer Aided Tomography.

378
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
So this is a lion from the local zoo

379
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
outside of Norrkoping in Kolmarden, Elsa.

380
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So she came to the center,

381
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
and they sedated her

382
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and then put her straight into the scanner.

383
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And then, of course, I get the whole data set from the lion.

384
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:22,000
And I can do very nice images like this.

385
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
I can peel off the layer of the lion.

386
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
I can look inside of it.

387
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
And we've been experimenting with this.

388
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And I think this is a great application

389
0:15:30.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
for the future of this technology,

390
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
because there's very little known about the animal anatomy.

391
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
What's known out there for veterinarians is kind of basic information.

392
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
We can scan all sorts of things,

393
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
all sorts of animals.

394
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
The only problem is to fit it into the machine.

395
0:15:45.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So here's a bear.

396
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
It was kind of hard to get it in.

397
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And the bear is a cuddly, friendly animal.

398
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
And here it is. Here is the nose of the bear.

399
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And you might want to cuddle this one,

400
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
until you change the functions and look at this.

401
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
So be aware of the bear.

402
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
So with that,

403
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
I'd like to thank all the people

404
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
who have helped me to generate these images.

405
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
It's a huge effort that goes into doing this,

406
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
gathering the data and developing the algorithms,

407
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
writing all the software.

408
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
So, some very talented people.

409
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
My motto is always, I only hire people that are smarter than I am

410
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
and most of these are smarter than I am.

411
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
So thank you very much.

412
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
(Applause)

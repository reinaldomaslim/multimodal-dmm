1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
My name is Kate Hartman.

2
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I like to make devices

3
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that play with the ways

4
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that we relate and communicate.

5
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So I'm specifically interested in how we, as humans,

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
relate to ourselves, each other

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and the world around us.

8
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter)

9
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
So just to give you a bit of context,

10
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
as June said, I'm an artist, a technologist and an educator.

11
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I teach courses in physical computing

12
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and wearable electronics.

13
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And much of what I do is either wearable

14
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
or somehow related to the human form.

15
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
And so anytime I talk about what I do,

16
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
I like to just quickly address

17
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
the reason why bodies matter.

18
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
And it's pretty simple.

19
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Everybody's got one -- all of you.

20
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I can guarantee, everyone in this room,

21
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
all of you over there, the people in the cushy seats,

22
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
the people up top with the laptops --

23
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
we all have bodies.

24
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Don't be ashamed.

25
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It's something that we have in common

26
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and they act as our primary interfaces for the world.

27
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And so when working as an interaction designer,

28
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
or as an artist who deals with participation --

29
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
creating things that live on, in or around the human form --

30
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
it's really a powerful space to work within.

31
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So within my own work,

32
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
I use a broad range of materials and tools.

33
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
So I communicate through everything from radio transceivers

34
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to funnels and plastic tubing.

35
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And to tell you a bit about the things that I make,

36
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the easiest place to start the story

37
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
is with a hat.

38
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And so it all started several years ago,

39
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
late one night when I was sitting on the subway, riding home,

40
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and I was thinking.

41
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And I tend to be a person who thinks too much and talks too little.

42
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And so I was thinking about how it might be great

43
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
if I could just take all these noises --

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
like all these sounds of my thoughts in my head --

45
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
if I could just physically extricate them

46
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and pull them out in such a form

47
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that I could share them with somebody else.

48
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And so I went home, and I made a prototype of this hat.

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And I called it the Muttering Hat,

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
because it emitted these muttering noises

51
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
that were kind of tethered to you,

52
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
but you could detach them

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and share them with somebody else.

54
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
(Laughter)

55
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So I make other hats as well.

56
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
This one is called the Talk to Yourself Hat.

57
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
(Laughter)

58
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It's fairly self-explanatory.

59
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
It physically carves out conversation space for one.

60
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And when you speak out loud,

61
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the sound of your voice is actually channeled back into your own ears.

62
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
And so when I make these things,

64
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
it's really not so much about the object itself,

65
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
but rather the negative space around the object.

66
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
So what happens when a person puts this thing on?

67
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
What kind of an experience do they have?

68
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And how are they transformed by wearing it?

69
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So many of these devices

70
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
really kind of focus on the ways in which we relate to ourselves.

71
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So this particular device is called the Gut Listener.

72
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
And it is a tool

73
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
that actually enables one

74
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
to listen to their own innards.

75
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Laughter)

76
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And so some of these things

77
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
are actually more geared toward expression and communication.

78
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And so the Inflatable Heart

79
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
is an external organ

80
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that can be used by the wearer to express themselves.

81
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So they can actually inflate it and deflate it

82
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
according to their emotions.

83
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So they can express everything from admiration and lust

84
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to anxiety and angst.

85
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
And some of these are actually meant

87
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
to mediate experiences.

88
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
So the Discommunicator is a tool for arguments.

89
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
And so actually it allows for an intense emotional exchange,

91
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but is serves to absorb

92
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
the specificity of the words that are delivered.

93
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
(Laughter)

94
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And in the end,

95
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
some of these things just act as invitations.

96
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So the Ear Bender literally puts something out there

97
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
so someone can grab your ear

98
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and say what they have to say.

99
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So even though I'm really interested in the relationship

100
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
between people,

101
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I also consider the ways

102
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
in which we relate to the world around us.

103
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And so when I was first living in New York City a few years back,

104
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
I was thinking a lot about

105
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
the familiar architectural forms that surrounded me

106
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
and how I would like to better relate to them.

107
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And I thought, "Well, hey!

108
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Maybe if I want to better relate to walls,

109
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
maybe I need to be more wall-like myself."

110
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So I made a wearable wall

111
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
that I could wear as a backpack.

112
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And so I would put it on

113
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and sort of physically transform myself

114
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
so that I could either contribute to or critique

115
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
the spaces that surrounded me.

116
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And so jumping off of that,

118
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
thinking beyond the built environment into the natural world,

119
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I have this ongoing project called Botanicalls --

120
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
which actually enables houseplants

121
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
to tap into human communication protocols.

122
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So when a plant is thirsty,

123
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
it can actually make a phone call

124
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
or post a message to a service like Twitter.

125
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And so this really shifts the human/plant dynamic,

126
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
because a single house plant

127
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
can actually express its needs

128
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to thousands of people at the same time.

129
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And so kind of thinking about scale,

130
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
my most recent obsession

131
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
is actually with glaciers -- of course.

132
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
And so glaciers are these magnificent beings,

133
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and there's lots of reasons to be obsessed with them,

134
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
but what I'm particularly interested in

135
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
is in human-glacier relations.

136
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
(Laughter)

137
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Because there seems to be an issue.

138
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
The glaciers are actually leaving us.

139
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
They're both shrinking and retreating --

140
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and some of them have disappeared altogether.

141
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And so I actually live in Canada now,

142
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
so I've been visiting one of my local glaciers.

143
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And this one's particularly interesting,

144
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
because, of all the glaciers in North America,

145
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
it receives the highest volume of human traffic in a year.

146
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
They actually have these buses that drive up and over the lateral moraine

147
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and drop people off on the surface of the glacier.

148
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
And this has really gotten me thinking

149
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
about this experience of the initial encounter.

150
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
When I meet a glacier for the very first time,

151
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
what do I do?

152
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
There's no kind of social protocol for this.

153
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I really just don't even know

154
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
how to say hello.

155
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Do I carve a message in the snow?

156
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Or perhaps I can assemble one

157
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
out of dot and dash ice cubes --

158
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
ice cube Morse code.

159
0:07:05.26,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Or perhaps I need to make myself a speaking tool,

160
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
like an icy megaphone

161
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
that I can use to amplify my voice

162
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
when I direct it at the ice.

163
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
But really the most satisfying experience I've had

164
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
is the act of listening,

165
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
which is what we need in any good relationship.

166
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And I was really struck by how much it affected me.

167
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
This very basic shift in my physical orientation

168
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
helped me shift my perspective

169
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
in relation to the glacier.

170
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And so since we use devices

171
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to figure out how to relate to the world these days,

172
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
I actually made a device called the Glacier Embracing Suit.

173
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
(Laughter)

174
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And so this is constructed out of a heat reflected material

175
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that serves to mediate the difference in temperature

176
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
between the human body and the glacial ice.

177
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And once again, it's this invitation

178
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that asks people to lay down on the glacier

179
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and give it a hug.

180
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
So, yea, this is actually just the beginning.

181
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
These are initial musings for this project.

182
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And just as with the wall, how I wanted to be more wall-like,

183
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
with this project, I'd actually like to take more a of glacial pace.

184
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
And so my intent

185
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
is to actually just take the next 10 years

186
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and go on a series of collaborative projects

187
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
where I work with people from different disciplines --

188
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
artists, technologists, scientists --

189
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to kind of work on this project

190
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
of how we can improve human-glacier relations.

191
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So beyond that, in closing,

192
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
I'd just like to say that we're in this era

193
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
of communications and device proliferation,

194
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and it's really tremendous and exciting and sexy,

195
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
but I think what's really important

196
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
is thinking about how we can simultaneously

197
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality

198
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world.

199
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Thanks.

200
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.56,000 --> 0:00:13,000
This is my nephew,

2
0:00:15.28,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Yuan Yuan.

3
0:00:16.6,000 --> 0:00:17,000
He's five years old,

4
0:00:18.12,000 --> 0:00:19,000
super adorable.

5
0:00:20.36,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I asked him the other day,

6
0:00:22.36,000 --> 0:00:24,000
"What would you like for your birthday this year?"

7
0:00:25.36,000 --> 0:00:29,000
He said, "I want to have a one-way mirror Spider-Man mask."

8
0:00:3,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I had absolutely no idea what he was talking about,

9
0:00:32.8,000 --> 0:00:33,000
so I said, "Wow, that's really cool,

10
0:00:34.8,000 --> 0:00:35,000
but how are you going to get it?"

11
0:00:37.12,000 --> 0:00:39,000
He told me, without a blink of his eyes,

12
0:00:40.04,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"I'm going to tell my mom and make a wish before I go to bed.

13
0:00:44.759,000 --> 0:00:45,000
My mom will go to shake her mobile phone.

14
0:00:47.4,000 --> 0:00:51,000
The next morning, the delivery uncle will give it to me when I wake up."

15
0:00:53.32,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I was about to tease him,

16
0:00:55.32,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but suddenly I realized

17
0:00:57.12,000 --> 0:00:59,000
he was simply telling me the truth,

18
0:00:59.48,000 --> 0:01:03,000
the truth of what shopping looks like for this generation.

19
0:01:03.64,000 --> 0:01:06,000
If you think of it, for a child like Yuan Yuan,

20
0:01:07.28,000 --> 0:01:09,000
shopping is a very different idea

21
0:01:09.6,000 --> 0:01:11,000
compared to what my generation had in mind.

22
0:01:12.52,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Shopping is always done on mobile,

23
0:01:14.8,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and payment is all virtual.

24
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:22,000
A huge shopping revolution is happening in China right now.

25
0:01:23.12,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Shopping behaviors, and also technology platforms,

26
0:01:27,000 --> 0:01:29,000
have evolved differently than elsewhere in the world.

27
0:01:29.88,000 --> 0:01:32,000
For instance, e-commerce in China is soaring.

28
0:01:33.8,000 --> 0:01:35,000
It's been growing at twice the speed of the United States

29
0:01:36.64,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and a lot of the growth is coming from mobile.

30
0:01:39.92,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Every month, 500 million consumers

31
0:01:44.72,000 --> 0:01:46,000
are buying on mobile phones,

32
0:01:46.84,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and to put that into context,

33
0:01:48.6,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that is a total population of the United States,

34
0:01:51.84,000 --> 0:01:53,000
UK and Germany combined.

35
0:01:55.04,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But it is not just about the scale of the e-commerce,

36
0:01:58.92,000 --> 0:02:02,000
it is the speed of adoption and the aggregation of the ecosystems.

37
0:02:03.52,000 --> 0:02:07,000
It took China less than five years to become a country of mobile commerce,

38
0:02:08.04,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and that is largely because of the two technology platforms,

39
0:02:13.2,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Alibaba and Tencent.

40
0:02:15.12,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They own 90 percent of the e-commerce --

41
0:02:18.72,000 --> 0:02:19,000
pretty much the whole market --

42
0:02:20.4,000 --> 0:02:22,000
85 percent of social media,

43
0:02:22.759,000 --> 0:02:25,000
85 percent of internet payment.

44
0:02:25.92,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And they also own large volumes of digital content, video, online movie,

45
0:02:32.48,000 --> 0:02:35,000
literature, travel information, gaming.

46
0:02:37.2,000 --> 0:02:4,000
When this huge base of mobile shoppers

47
0:02:40.48,000 --> 0:02:42,000
meets with aggregated ecosystems,

48
0:02:42.96,000 --> 0:02:43,000
chemical reactions happen.

49
0:02:44.84,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Today, China is like a huge laboratory

50
0:02:47.48,000 --> 0:02:49,000
generating all sorts of experiments.

51
0:02:50.32,000 --> 0:02:51,000
You should come to China,

52
0:02:51.8,000 --> 0:02:54,000
because here you will get a glimpse into the future.

53
0:02:56.52,000 --> 0:03:,000
One of the trends I have seen concerns the spontaneity of shopping.

54
0:03:01.44,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Five years ago, in a fashion study,

55
0:03:03.52,000 --> 0:03:04,000
we found that on average,

56
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:08,000
a Chinese consumer would be buying five to eight pairs of shoes.

57
0:03:08.96,000 --> 0:03:12,000
This number tripled to reach about 25 pairs of shoes a year.

58
0:03:13.36,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Who would need so many pairs of shoes?

59
0:03:16.52,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So I asked them, "What are the reasons you buy?"

60
0:03:19.68,000 --> 0:03:21,000
They told me a list of inspirations:

61
0:03:22.36,000 --> 0:03:26,000
blogs, celebrity news, fashion information.

62
0:03:27.04,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But really, for many of them, there was no particular reason to buy.

63
0:03:30.52,000 --> 0:03:32,000
They were just browsing on their mobile site

64
0:03:33.04,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and then buying whatever they saw.

65
0:03:36.56,000 --> 0:03:4,000
We have observed the same level of spontaneity in everything,

66
0:03:40.84,000 --> 0:03:43,000
from grocery shopping to buying insurance products.

67
0:03:46.24,000 --> 0:03:49,000
But it is not very difficult to understand if you think about it.

68
0:03:49.84,000 --> 0:03:51,000
A lot of the Chinese consumers are still very new

69
0:03:52.6,000 --> 0:03:55,000
in their middle-class or upper-middle-class lifestyles,

70
0:03:55.84,000 --> 0:03:57,000
with a strong desire to buy everything new,

71
0:03:58.84,000 --> 0:04:,000
new products, new services.

72
0:04:00.92,000 --> 0:04:02,000
And with this integrated ecosystem,

73
0:04:03.64,000 --> 0:04:07,000
it is so easy for them to buy, one click after another.

74
0:04:09.52,000 --> 0:04:13,000
However, this new shopping behavior is creating a lot of challenges

75
0:04:14.04,000 --> 0:04:16,000
for those once-dominant businesses.

76
0:04:16.8,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The owner of a fashion company told me that he's so frustrated

77
0:04:20.68,000 --> 0:04:24,000
because his customers keep complaining that his products are not new enough.

78
0:04:25.32,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Well, for a fashion company, really bad comment.

79
0:04:29.519,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And he already increased the number of products in each collection.

80
0:04:33,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It doesn't seem to work.

81
0:04:34.8,000 --> 0:04:37,000
So I told him there's something more important than that.

82
0:04:38.24,000 --> 0:04:41,000
You've got to give your consumer exactly what they want

83
0:04:41.72,000 --> 0:04:42,000
when they still want it.

84
0:04:43.72,000 --> 0:04:47,000
And he can learn something from the online apparel players in China.

85
0:04:48.28,000 --> 0:04:51,000
These companies, they collect real consumer feedback

86
0:04:51.56,000 --> 0:04:53,000
from mobile sites, from social media,

87
0:04:54.08,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and then their designers will translate this information

88
0:04:57.4,000 --> 0:04:58,000
into product ideas,

89
0:04:59.12,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and then send them to microstudios for production.

90
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:06,000
These microstudios are really key in this overall ecosystem,

91
0:05:07,000 --> 0:05:09,000
because they take small orders,

92
0:05:09.2,000 --> 0:05:11,000
30 garments at a time,

93
0:05:11.4,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and they can also make partially customized pieces.

94
0:05:15.8,000 --> 0:05:18,000
The fact that all these production designs

95
0:05:19,000 --> 0:05:2,000
are done locally,

96
0:05:20.48,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the whole process, from transporting to product on shelf or online

97
0:05:25.04,000 --> 0:05:27,000
sometimes takes only three to four days.

98
0:05:27.64,000 --> 0:05:28,000
That is super fast,

99
0:05:29.36,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and that is highly responsive to what is in and hot on the market.

100
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And that is giving enormous headaches to traditional retailers

101
0:05:37.32,000 --> 0:05:39,000
who are only thinking about a few collections a year.

102
0:05:42.28,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Then there's a consumer's need for ultraconvenience.

103
0:05:46.24,000 --> 0:05:49,000
A couple of months ago, I was shopping with a friend in Tokyo.

104
0:05:49.48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We were in the store,

105
0:05:50.76,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and there were three to four people standing in front of us

106
0:05:53.6,000 --> 0:05:54,000
at the checkout counter.

107
0:05:55.08,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Pretty normal, right?

108
0:05:56.64,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But both of us dropped our selection

109
0:05:59.44,000 --> 0:06:,000
and walked away.

110
0:06:01.44,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This is how impatient we have become.

111
0:06:04.56,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Delivering ultraconvenience is not just something nice to have.

112
0:06:08.44,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It is crucial to make sure your consumer actually buys.

113
0:06:12.36,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And in China, we have learned

114
0:06:14.56,000 --> 0:06:18,000
that convenience is really the glue that will make online shopping

115
0:06:18.72,000 --> 0:06:2,000
a behavior and a habit that sticks.

116
0:06:21.72,000 --> 0:06:24,000
It is sometimes more effective than a loyalty program alone.

117
0:06:25.32,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Take Hema.

118
0:06:27.04,000 --> 0:06:31,000
It's a retail grocery concept developed by Alibaba.

119
0:06:31.6,000 --> 0:06:32,000
They deliver a full basket of products

120
0:06:33.6,000 --> 0:06:36,000
from 4,000 SKUs to your doorstep

121
0:06:36.88,000 --> 0:06:37,000
within 30 minutes.

122
0:06:38.76,000 --> 0:06:42,000
What is amazing is that they deliver literally everything:

123
0:06:42.88,000 --> 0:06:44,000
fruits, vegetables, of course.

124
0:06:45.12,000 --> 0:06:47,000
They also deliver live fish

125
0:06:47.48,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and also live Alaska king crab.

126
0:06:50.96,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Like my friend once told me,

127
0:06:53.24,000 --> 0:06:54,000
"It's really my dream coming true.

128
0:06:54.96,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Finally, I can impress my mother-in-law

129
0:06:57.92,000 --> 0:06:59,000
when she comes to visit me for dinner unexpectedly."

130
0:07:00.92,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

131
0:07:04.24,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Well, companies like Amazon and FreshDirect

132
0:07:06.92,000 --> 0:07:08,000
are also experimenting in the same field.

133
0:07:09.84,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The fact that Hema is part of the Alibaba ecosystem

134
0:07:13.44,000 --> 0:07:16,000
makes it faster and also a bit easier to implement.

135
0:07:17.76,000 --> 0:07:18,000
For an online grocery player,

136
0:07:19.68,000 --> 0:07:21,000
it is very difficult, very costly,

137
0:07:22.52,000 --> 0:07:24,000
to deliver a full basket quickly,

138
0:07:25.32,000 --> 0:07:27,000
but for Hema, it's got a mobile app,

139
0:07:27.96,000 --> 0:07:28,000
it's got mobile payment,

140
0:07:29.64,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and also it's built 20 physical stores in high-density areas in Shanghai.

141
0:07:35.36,000 --> 0:07:38,000
These stores are built to ensure the freshness of the product --

142
0:07:39.28,000 --> 0:07:41,000
they actually have fish tanks in the store --

143
0:07:42.2,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and also to give locations that will enable high-speed delivery.

144
0:07:46.92,000 --> 0:07:48,000
I know the question you have on your mind.

145
0:07:48.96,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Are they making money?

146
0:07:50.24,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Yes, they are making money.

147
0:07:51.6,000 --> 0:07:52,000
They are breaking even,

148
0:07:52.88,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and what is also amazing is that the sales revenue per store

149
0:07:56.48,000 --> 0:08:,000
is three to four times higher than the traditional grocery store,

150
0:08:00.52,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and half of the revenue orders are coming from mobile.

151
0:08:05.04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
This is really proof that a consumer,

152
0:08:07.92,000 --> 0:08:1,000
if you give them ultraconvenience that really works in grocery shopping,

153
0:08:11.52,000 --> 0:08:13,000
they're going to switch their shopping behaviors online,

154
0:08:14.4,000 --> 0:08:15,000
like, in no time.

155
0:08:17.48,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So ultraconvenience and spontaneity,

156
0:08:20.6,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that's not the full story.

157
0:08:22.48,000 --> 0:08:24,000
The other trend I have seen in China

158
0:08:24.64,000 --> 0:08:25,000
is social shopping.

159
0:08:26.44,000 --> 0:08:28,000
If you think of social shopping elsewhere in the world,

160
0:08:29.08,000 --> 0:08:3,000
it is a linear process.

161
0:08:31.56,000 --> 0:08:33,000
You pick up something on Facebook,

162
0:08:33.72,000 --> 0:08:35,000
watch it, and you switch to Amazon

163
0:08:36.36,000 --> 0:08:38,000
or brand.com to complete the shopping journey.

164
0:08:39.08,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Clean and simple.

165
0:08:40.76,000 --> 0:08:43,000
But in China it is a very different thing.

166
0:08:43.88,000 --> 0:08:47,000
On average, a consumer would spend one hour on their mobile phone shopping.

167
0:08:48.64,000 --> 0:08:5,000
That's three times higher than the United States.

168
0:08:51.32,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Where does the stickiness come from?

169
0:08:53.28,000 --> 0:08:56,000
What are they actually doing on this tiny little screen?

170
0:08:57.12,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So let me take you on a mobile shopping journey

171
0:08:59.6,000 --> 0:09:,000
that I usually would be experiencing.

172
0:09:03,000 --> 0:09:05,000
11pm, yes, that's usually when I shop.

173
0:09:06.8,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I was having a chat in a WeChat chatroom with my friends.

174
0:09:10.44,000 --> 0:09:12,000
One of them took out a pack of snack

175
0:09:12.56,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and posted the product link in that chatroom.

176
0:09:16.32,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I hate it, because usually I would just click that link

177
0:09:20.04,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and then land on the product page.

178
0:09:22.68,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Lots of information, very colorful,

179
0:09:24.96,000 --> 0:09:25,000
mind-blowing.

180
0:09:26.4,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Watched it and then a shop assistant came online

181
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and asked me, "How can I help you tonight?"

182
0:09:32.24,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Of course I bought that pack of snack.

183
0:09:34.44,000 --> 0:09:38,000
What is more beautiful is I know that the next day, around noontime,

184
0:09:38.52,000 --> 0:09:4,000
that pack of snack will be delivered to my office.

185
0:09:41.4,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I can eat it and share it with my colleagues

186
0:09:44.04,000 --> 0:09:46,000
and the cost of delivery, maximum one dollar.

187
0:09:48.24,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Just when I was about to leave that shopping site,

188
0:09:51.2,000 --> 0:09:52,000
another screen popped up.

189
0:09:53.08,000 --> 0:09:57,000
This time it is the livestreaming of a grassroots celebrity

190
0:09:57.76,000 --> 0:10:,000
teaching me how to wear a new color of lipstick.

191
0:10:01.04,000 --> 0:10:04,000
I watched for 30 seconds -- very easy to understand --

192
0:10:04.16,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and also there is a shopping link right next to it,

193
0:10:07.24,000 --> 0:10:09,000
clicked it, bought it in a few seconds.

194
0:10:10.6,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Back to the chatroom.

195
0:10:12.12,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The gossiping is still going on.

196
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Another friend of mine posted the QR code

197
0:10:16.88,000 --> 0:10:17,000
of another pack of snack.

198
0:10:18.56,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Clicked it, bought it.

199
0:10:21.08,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So the whole experience

200
0:10:22.68,000 --> 0:10:25,000
is like you're exploring in an amusement park.

201
0:10:26.48,000 --> 0:10:28,000
It is chaotic, it is fun

202
0:10:29.12,000 --> 0:10:31,000
and it's even a little bit addictive.

203
0:10:32.52,000 --> 0:10:36,000
This is what's happening when you have this integrated ecosystem.

204
0:10:36.96,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Shopping is embedded in social,

205
0:10:39.68,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and social is evolving into a multidimensional experience.

206
0:10:44.4,000 --> 0:10:47,000
The integration of ecosystems reaches a whole new level.

207
0:10:48.12,000 --> 0:10:51,000
So does its dominance in all aspects of our life.

208
0:10:52.72,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And of course, there are huge commercial opportunities behind it.

209
0:10:56.36,000 --> 0:10:58,000
A Chinese snack company, Three Squirrels,

210
0:10:59.2,000 --> 0:11:02,000
built a half-a-billion-dollar business in just three years

211
0:11:03,000 --> 0:11:06,000
by investing in 300 to 500 shop assistants

212
0:11:06.84,000 --> 0:11:1,000
who are going to be online to provide services 24/7.

213
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:13,000
In the social media environment,

214
0:11:13.04,000 --> 0:11:14,000
they are like your neighborhood friends.

215
0:11:15,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Even when you are not buying stuff,

216
0:11:16.72,000 --> 0:11:19,000
they will be happy to just tell you a few jokes and make you happy.

217
0:11:21,000 --> 0:11:23,000
In this integrated ecosystem,

218
0:11:23.12,000 --> 0:11:27,000
social media can really redefine the relationship between brand,

219
0:11:27.6,000 --> 0:11:29,000
retailer and consumer.

220
0:11:31.44,000 --> 0:11:34,000
These are only fragments of the massive changes

221
0:11:34.92,000 --> 0:11:35,000
I have seen in China.

222
0:11:36.64,000 --> 0:11:37,000
In this huge laboratory,

223
0:11:38.64,000 --> 0:11:41,000
a lot of experiments are generated every single day.

224
0:11:43.04,000 --> 0:11:45,000
The ecosystems are reforming,

225
0:11:45.56,000 --> 0:11:49,000
supply chain distribution, marketing, product innovation,

226
0:11:49.76,000 --> 0:11:5,000
everything.

227
0:11:51,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Consumers are getting the power to decide what they want to buy,

228
0:11:55.28,000 --> 0:11:56,000
when they want to buy it,

229
0:11:56.6,000 --> 0:11:59,000
how they want to buy it, how they want to social.

230
0:11:59.64,000 --> 0:12:02,000
It is now back to business leaders of the world

231
0:12:03.08,000 --> 0:12:06,000
to really open their eyes, see what's happening in China,

232
0:12:06.44,000 --> 0:12:09,000
think about it and take actions.

233
0:12:10.32,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Thank you.

234
0:12:11.56,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Applause)

235
0:12:19.76,000 --> 0:12:21,000
Massimo Portincaso: Angela, what you shared with us

236
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
is truly impressive and almost incredible,

237
0:12:24.4,000 --> 0:12:29,000
but I think many in the audience had the same question that I had,

238
0:12:29.68,000 --> 0:12:3,000
which is:

239
0:12:30.92,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Is this kind of impulsive consumption

240
0:12:34.28,000 --> 0:12:38,000
both economically and environmentally sustainable over the longer term?

241
0:12:38.52,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And what is the total price to be paid

242
0:12:42.28,000 --> 0:12:46,000
for such an automized and ultraconvenient retail experience?

243
0:12:47,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Angela Wang: Yeah. One thing we have to keep in mind

244
0:12:49.92,000 --> 0:12:52,000
is really, we are at the very beginning of a huge transformation.

245
0:12:54.2,000 --> 0:12:57,000
So with this trading up needs of the consumer,

246
0:12:57.36,000 --> 0:13:,000
together with the evolution of the ecosystem,

247
0:13:00.52,000 --> 0:13:03,000
there are a lot of opportunities and also challenges.

248
0:13:04.32,000 --> 0:13:05,000
So I've seen some early signs

249
0:13:05.92,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that the ecosystems are shifting their focus

250
0:13:08.8,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to pay attention to solve these challenges.

251
0:13:11.4,000 --> 0:13:15,000
For example, paying more consideration to sustainability

252
0:13:15.68,000 --> 0:13:16,000
alongside just about speed,

253
0:13:17.64,000 --> 0:13:19,000
and also quality over quantity.

254
0:13:20.52,000 --> 0:13:22,000
But there are really no simple answers to these questions.

255
0:13:23.48,000 --> 0:13:25,000
That is exactly why I'm here to tell everyone

256
0:13:26.12,000 --> 0:13:3,000
that we need to watch it, study it, and play a part in this evolution.

257
0:13:31.68,000 --> 0:13:32,000
MP: Thank you very much.

258
0:13:33.24,000 --> 0:13:34,000
AW: Thank you.

259
0:13:34.48,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Applause)

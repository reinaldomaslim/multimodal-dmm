2
0:00:15.485,000 --> 0:00:17,000
America's public energy conversation

3
0:00:17.747,000 --> 0:00:19,000
boils down to this question:

4
0:00:19.97,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Would you rather die of A) oil wars,

5
0:00:23.35,000 --> 0:00:25,000
or B) climate change,

6
0:00:25.96,000 --> 0:00:26,000
or C) nuclear holocaust,

7
0:00:27.36,000 --> 0:00:3,000
or D) all of the above?

8
0:00:30.66,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Oh, I missed one: or E) none of the above?

9
0:00:33.46,000 --> 0:00:35,000
That's the one we're not normally offered.

10
0:00:35.575,000 --> 0:00:37,000
What if we could make energy do our work

11
0:00:37.714,000 --> 0:00:39,000
without working our undoing?

12
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Could we have fuel without fear?

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Could we reinvent fire?

14
0:00:44.668,000 --> 0:00:45,000
You see, fire made us human;

15
0:00:46.298,000 --> 0:00:48,000
fossil fuels made us modern.

16
0:00:48.352,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But now we need a new fire

17
0:00:49.652,000 --> 0:00:52,000
that makes us safe, secure, healthy and durable.

18
0:00:53.175,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Let's see how.

19
0:00:55.434,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Four-fifths of the world's energy

20
0:00:58.32,000 --> 0:00:59,000
still comes from burning each year

21
0:01:00.093,000 --> 0:01:03,000
four cubic miles of the rotted remains

22
0:01:03.593,000 --> 0:01:05,000
of primeval swamp goo.

23
0:01:06.193,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Those fossil fuels

24
0:01:08.327,000 --> 0:01:11,000
have built our civilization.

25
0:01:11.404,000 --> 0:01:13,000
They've created our wealth.

26
0:01:13.489,000 --> 0:01:14,000
They've enriched the lives of billions.

27
0:01:15.065,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But they also have rising costs

28
0:01:17.704,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to our security, economy, health and environment

29
0:01:22.093,000 --> 0:01:25,000
that are starting to erode, if not outweigh their benefits.

30
0:01:25.347,000 --> 0:01:27,000
So we need a new fire.

31
0:01:27.589,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And switching from the old fire to the new fire

32
0:01:30.491,000 --> 0:01:34,000
means changing two big stories about oil and electricity,

33
0:01:34.527,000 --> 0:01:38,000
each of which puts two-fifths of the fossil carbon in the air.

34
0:01:39.204,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But they're really quite distinct.

35
0:01:41.173,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Less than one percent of our electricity is made from oil --

36
0:01:44.585,000 --> 0:01:47,000
although almost half is made from coal.

37
0:01:48.289,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Their uses are quite concentrated.

38
0:01:50.568,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Three-fourths of our oil fuel is transportation.

39
0:01:53.308,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Three-fourths of our electricity powers buildings.

40
0:01:56.083,000 --> 0:01:58,000
And the rest of both runs factories.

41
0:01:58.124,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So very efficient vehicles, buildings and factories

42
0:02:01.96,000 --> 0:02:02,000
save oil and coal,

43
0:02:03.729,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and also natural gas that can displace both of them.

44
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But today's energy system is not just inefficient,

45
0:02:10.845,000 --> 0:02:12,000
it is also disconnected,

46
0:02:12.852,000 --> 0:02:14,000
aging, dirty and insecure.

47
0:02:15.56,000 --> 0:02:17,000
So it needs refurbishment.

48
0:02:18.037,000 --> 0:02:21,000
By 2050 though, it could become efficient,

49
0:02:21.465,000 --> 0:02:24,000
connected and distributed

50
0:02:24.727,000 --> 0:02:25,000
with elegantly frugal

51
0:02:26.127,000 --> 0:02:28,000
autos, factories and buildings

52
0:02:28.86,000 --> 0:02:3,000
all relying on a modern, secure

53
0:02:31.227,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and resilient electricity system.

54
0:02:33.889,000 --> 0:02:38,000
We can eliminate our addiction to oil and coal by 2050

55
0:02:39.327,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and use one-third less natural gas

56
0:02:42.496,000 --> 0:02:44,000
while switching to efficient use

57
0:02:45.381,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and renewable supply.

58
0:02:47.965,000 --> 0:02:5,000
This could cost, by 2050,

59
0:02:51.498,000 --> 0:02:54,000
five trillion dollars less in net present value,

60
0:02:54.75,000 --> 0:02:56,000
that is expressed as a lump sum today,

61
0:02:57.393,000 --> 0:02:58,000
than business as usual --

62
0:02:58.939,000 --> 0:02:59,000
assuming that carbon emissions

63
0:03:00.393,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and all other hidden or external costs are worth zero --

64
0:03:03.458,000 --> 0:03:06,000
a conservatively low estimate.

65
0:03:07.342,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Yet this cheaper energy system

66
0:03:09.293,000 --> 0:03:12,000
could support 158 percent bigger U.S. economy

67
0:03:13.127,000 --> 0:03:15,000
all without needing oil or coal,

68
0:03:15.496,000 --> 0:03:17,000
or for that matter nuclear energy.

69
0:03:17.96,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Moreover, this transition needs no new inventions

70
0:03:20.983,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and no acts of Congress

71
0:03:24.245,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and no new federal taxes, mandate subsidies or laws

72
0:03:28.727,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and running Washington gridlock.

73
0:03:31.678,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Let me say that again.

74
0:03:32.593,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I'm going to tell you how to get the United States

75
0:03:35.362,000 --> 0:03:38,000
completely off oil and coal, five trillion dollars cheaper

76
0:03:38.673,000 --> 0:03:39,000
with no act of Congress

77
0:03:40.019,000 --> 0:03:42,000
led by business for profit.

78
0:03:42.529,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In other words, we're going to use our most effective institutions --

79
0:03:46.168,000 --> 0:03:49,000
private enterprise co-evolving with civil society

80
0:03:49.981,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and sped by military innovation

81
0:03:52.493,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to go around our least effective institutions.

82
0:03:55.293,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And whether you care most

83
0:03:57.627,000 --> 0:04:,000
about profits and jobs and competitive advantage

84
0:04:01.058,000 --> 0:04:03,000
or national security, or environmental stewardship

85
0:04:03.468,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and climate protection and public health,

86
0:04:05.629,000 --> 0:04:09,000
reinventing fire makes sense and makes money.

87
0:04:09.912,000 --> 0:04:12,000
General Eisenhower reputedly said

88
0:04:13.358,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that enlarging the boundaries of a tough problem

89
0:04:15.978,000 --> 0:04:19,000
makes it soluble by encompassing more options and more synergies.

90
0:04:20.547,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So in reinventing fire,

91
0:04:22.216,000 --> 0:04:25,000
we integrated all four sectors that use energy --

92
0:04:25.383,000 --> 0:04:28,000
transportation, buildings, industry and electricity --

93
0:04:29.022,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and we integrated four kinds of innovation,

94
0:04:31.645,000 --> 0:04:33,000
not just technology and policy,

95
0:04:34.193,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but also design and business strategy.

96
0:04:37.293,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Those combinations yield

97
0:04:39.308,000 --> 0:04:41,000
very much more than the sum of the parts,

98
0:04:41.414,000 --> 0:04:46,000
especially in creating deeply disruptive business opportunities.

99
0:04:46.76,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Oil costs our economy two billion dollars a day,

100
0:04:50.808,000 --> 0:04:52,000
plus another four billion dollars a day

101
0:04:53.175,000 --> 0:04:55,000
in hidden economic and military costs,

102
0:04:55.822,000 --> 0:04:58,000
raising its total cost to over a sixth of GDP.

103
0:04:59.752,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Our mobility fuel goes three-fifths to automobiles.

104
0:05:02.296,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So let's start by making autos oil free.

105
0:05:04.942,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Two-thirds of the energy it takes to move a typical car

106
0:05:08.122,000 --> 0:05:1,000
is caused by its weight.

107
0:05:10.324,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And every unit of energy you save at the wheels,

108
0:05:13.831,000 --> 0:05:14,000
by taking out weight or drag,

109
0:05:15.078,000 --> 0:05:17,000
saves seven units in the tank,

110
0:05:17.108,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because you don't have to waste six units

111
0:05:18.793,000 --> 0:05:2,000
getting the energy to the wheels.

112
0:05:20.893,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Unfortunately, over the past quarter century,

113
0:05:24.478,000 --> 0:05:26,000
epidemic obesity has made our two-ton steel cars

114
0:05:27.193,000 --> 0:05:3,000
gain weight twice as fast as we have.

115
0:05:31.016,000 --> 0:05:34,000
But today, ultralight, ultrastrong materials,

116
0:05:34.67,000 --> 0:05:36,000
like carbon fiber composites,

117
0:05:37.255,000 --> 0:05:39,000
can make dramatic weight savings snowball

118
0:05:39.627,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and can make cars simpler and cheaper to build.

119
0:05:43.542,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Lighter and more slippery autos

120
0:05:45.908,000 --> 0:05:47,000
need less force to move them,

121
0:05:48.155,000 --> 0:05:5,000
so their engines get smaller.

122
0:05:50.429,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Indeed, that sort of vehicle fitness

123
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
then makes electric propulsion affordable

124
0:05:56.427,000 --> 0:05:59,000
because the batteries or fuel cells

125
0:05:59.56,000 --> 0:06:02,000
also get smaller and lighter and cheaper.

126
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
So sticker prices will ultimately fall to about the same as today,

127
0:06:07.06,000 --> 0:06:1,000
while the driving cost, even from the start,

128
0:06:10.581,000 --> 0:06:11,000
is very much lower.

129
0:06:12.329,000 --> 0:06:16,000
So these innovations together can transform automakers

130
0:06:16.475,000 --> 0:06:18,000
from wringing tiny savings

131
0:06:18.837,000 --> 0:06:21,000
out of Victorian engine and seal-stamping technologies

132
0:06:22.168,000 --> 0:06:24,000
to the steeply falling costs

133
0:06:24.906,000 --> 0:06:29,000
of three linked innovations that strongly reenforce each other --

134
0:06:30.006,000 --> 0:06:33,000
namely ultralight materials, making them into structures

135
0:06:33.929,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and electric propulsion.

136
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The sales can grow and the prices fall even faster

137
0:06:40.96,000 --> 0:06:41,000
with temporary feebates,

138
0:06:42.668,000 --> 0:06:44,000
that is rebates for efficient new autos

139
0:06:44.922,000 --> 0:06:47,000
paid for by fees on inefficient ones.

140
0:06:48.022,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And just in the first two years

141
0:06:50.868,000 --> 0:06:53,000
the biggest of Europe's five feebate programs

142
0:06:54.316,000 --> 0:06:58,000
has tripled the speed of improving automotive efficiency.

143
0:06:58.362,000 --> 0:07:01,000
The resulting shift to electric autos

144
0:07:01.791,000 --> 0:07:02,000
is going to be as game-changing

145
0:07:03.262,000 --> 0:07:07,000
as shifting from typewriters to the gains in computers.

146
0:07:07.46,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Of course, computers and electronics

147
0:07:09.56,000 --> 0:07:11,000
are now America's biggest industry,

148
0:07:11.86,000 --> 0:07:13,000
while typewriter makers have vanished.

149
0:07:14.014,000 --> 0:07:15,000
So vehicle fitness

150
0:07:15.935,000 --> 0:07:18,000
opens a new automotive competitive strategy

151
0:07:19.504,000 --> 0:07:22,000
that can double the oil savings over the next 40 years,

152
0:07:22.758,000 --> 0:07:24,000
but then also make electrification affordable,

153
0:07:25.635,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and that displaces the rest of the oil.

154
0:07:29.619,000 --> 0:07:32,000
America could lead this next automotive revolution.

155
0:07:33.175,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Currently the leader is Germany.

156
0:07:35.66,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Last year, Volkswagen announced

157
0:07:38.168,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that by next year they'll be producing

158
0:07:40.391,000 --> 0:07:42,000
this carbon fiber plugin hybrid

159
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
getting 230 miles a gallon.

160
0:07:45.668,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Also last year, BMW announced

161
0:07:48.183,000 --> 0:07:5,000
this carbon fiber electric car,

162
0:07:50.452,000 --> 0:07:51,000
they said that its carbon fiber is paid for

163
0:07:52.427,000 --> 0:07:54,000
by needing fewer batteries.

164
0:07:54.481,000 --> 0:07:56,000
And they said, "We do not intend to be a typewriter maker."

165
0:07:57.027,000 --> 0:08:,000
Audi claimed it's going to beat them both by a year.

166
0:08:00.535,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Seven years ago, an even faster and cheaper

167
0:08:03.76,000 --> 0:08:05,000
American manufacturing technology

168
0:08:06.352,000 --> 0:08:13,000
was used to make this little carbon fiber test part,

169
0:08:13.796,000 --> 0:08:15,000
which doubles as a carbon cap.

170
0:08:16.135,000 --> 0:08:17,000
(Laughter)

171
0:08:17.698,000 --> 0:08:2,000
In one minute -- and you can tell from the sound

172
0:08:20.76,000 --> 0:08:22,000
how immensely stiff and strong it is.

173
0:08:23.593,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Don't worry about dropping it, it's tougher than titanium.

174
0:08:27.085,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Tom Friedman actually whacked it as hard as he could with a sledgehammer

175
0:08:29.308,000 --> 0:08:3,000
without even scuffing it.

176
0:08:30.847,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But such manufacturing techniques

177
0:08:32.962,000 --> 0:08:35,000
can scale to automotive speed and cost

178
0:08:36.185,000 --> 0:08:37,000
with aerospace performance.

179
0:08:37.639,000 --> 0:08:4,000
They can save four-fifths of the capital needed to make autos.

180
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:42,000
They can save lives

181
0:08:42.322,000 --> 0:08:43,000
because this stuff can absorb

182
0:08:43.614,000 --> 0:08:46,000
up to 12 times as much crash energy per pound as steel.

183
0:08:46.878,000 --> 0:08:47,000
If we made all of our autos this way,

184
0:08:48.627,000 --> 0:08:5,000
it would save oil equivalent to finding

185
0:08:51.55,000 --> 0:08:53,000
one and a half Saudi Arabias, or half an OPEC,

186
0:08:54.382,000 --> 0:08:58,000
by drilling in the Detroit formation, a very prospective play.

187
0:08:58.814,000 --> 0:09:,000
And all those mega-barrels under Detroit

188
0:09:01.514,000 --> 0:09:03,000
cost an average of 18 bucks a barrel.

189
0:09:04.027,000 --> 0:09:05,000
They are all-American, carbon-free

190
0:09:05.873,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and inexhaustible.

191
0:09:08.193,000 --> 0:09:1,000
The same physics and the same business logic

192
0:09:10.947,000 --> 0:09:11,000
also apply to big vehicles.

193
0:09:12.493,000 --> 0:09:14,000
In the five years ending with 2010,

194
0:09:15.185,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Walmart saved 60 percent of the fuel per ton-mile

195
0:09:19.76,000 --> 0:09:2,000
in its giant fleet of heavy trucks

196
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:22,000
through better logistics and design.

197
0:09:22.56,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But just the technological savings in heavy trucks

198
0:09:25.575,000 --> 0:09:26,000
can get to two-thirds.

199
0:09:27.46,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And combined with triple to quintuple efficiency airplanes,

200
0:09:30.747,000 --> 0:09:31,000
now on the drawing board,

201
0:09:32.468,000 --> 0:09:34,000
can save close to a trillion dollars.

202
0:09:34.714,000 --> 0:09:38,000
Also today's military revolution in energy efficiency

203
0:09:39.083,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is going to speed up all of these civilian advances

204
0:09:42.06,000 --> 0:09:44,000
in much the same way that military R&D

205
0:09:44.589,000 --> 0:09:47,000
has given us the Internet, the Global Positioning System

206
0:09:47.783,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and the jet engine and microchip industries.

207
0:09:50.852,000 --> 0:09:53,000
As we design and build vehicles better,

208
0:09:54.375,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we can also use them smarter

209
0:09:56.475,000 --> 0:09:58,000
by harnessing four powerful techniques

210
0:09:58.722,000 --> 0:09:59,000
for eliminating needless driving.

211
0:10:00.714,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Instead of just seeing the travel grow,

212
0:10:03.506,000 --> 0:10:05,000
we can use innovative pricing,

213
0:10:06.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
charging for road infrastructure by the mile, not by the gallon.

214
0:10:10.114,000 --> 0:10:13,000
We can use some smart IT to enhance transit

215
0:10:13.36,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and enable car sharing and ride sharing.

216
0:10:16.901,000 --> 0:10:2,000
We can allow smart and lucrative growth models

217
0:10:21.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that help people already be near where they want to be,

218
0:10:25.337,000 --> 0:10:26,000
so they don't need to go somewhere else.

219
0:10:26.85,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And we can use smart IT

220
0:10:28.96,000 --> 0:10:3,000
to make traffic free-flowing.

221
0:10:31.512,000 --> 0:10:33,000
Together, those things can give us the same or better access

222
0:10:34.327,000 --> 0:10:38,000
with 46 to 84 percent less driving,

223
0:10:38.827,000 --> 0:10:4,000
saving another 0.4 trillion dollars,

224
0:10:41.465,000 --> 0:10:45,000
plus 0.3 trillion dollars from using trucks more productively.

225
0:10:46.46,000 --> 0:10:48,000
So 40 years hence, when you add it all up,

226
0:10:49.165,000 --> 0:10:52,000
a far more mobile U.S. economy

227
0:10:52.173,000 --> 0:10:54,000
can use no oil.

228
0:10:54.252,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Saving or displacing barrels for 25 bucks

229
0:10:57.76,000 --> 0:10:58,000
rather than buying them for over a hundred,

230
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:02,000
adds up to a $4 trillion net saving

231
0:11:02.935,000 --> 0:11:05,000
counting all the hidden costs at zero.

232
0:11:05.942,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So to get mobility without oil,

233
0:11:08.86,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to phase out the oil,

234
0:11:10.96,000 --> 0:11:13,000
we can get efficient and then switch fuels.

235
0:11:14.391,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Those 125 to 240 mile-per-gallon-equivalent autos

236
0:11:18.735,000 --> 0:11:21,000
can use any mixture of hydrogen fuel cells,

237
0:11:22.578,000 --> 0:11:25,000
electricity and advanced biofuels.

238
0:11:25.689,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The trucks and planes can realistically use

239
0:11:29.342,000 --> 0:11:31,000
hydrogen or advanced biofuels.

240
0:11:32.162,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The trucks could even use natural gas.

241
0:11:34.227,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But no vehicles will need oil.

242
0:11:36.227,000 --> 0:11:39,000
And the most biofuel we might need,

243
0:11:39.312,000 --> 0:11:4,000
just three million barrels a day,

244
0:11:41.055,000 --> 0:11:42,000
can be made two-thirds from waste

245
0:11:42.693,000 --> 0:11:43,000
without displacing any cropland

246
0:11:44.527,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and without harming soil or climate.

247
0:11:47.56,000 --> 0:11:49,000
Our team speeds up these kinds of oil savings

248
0:11:49.575,000 --> 0:11:51,000
by what we call "institutional acupuncture."

249
0:11:52.527,000 --> 0:11:53,000
We figure out where the business logic

250
0:11:53.927,000 --> 0:11:55,000
is congested and not flowing properly,

251
0:11:56.396,000 --> 0:11:57,000
we stick little needles in it to get it flowing,

252
0:11:58.208,000 --> 0:12:,000
working with partners like Ford and Walmart and the Pentagon.

253
0:12:00.701,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And the long transition is already well under way.

254
0:12:04.162,000 --> 0:12:08,000
In fact, three years ago mainstream analysts were starting to see peak oil,

255
0:12:08.465,000 --> 0:12:1,000
not in supply, but in demand.

256
0:12:11.412,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And Deutsche Bank even said world oil use could peak around 2016.

257
0:12:16.524,000 --> 0:12:2,000
In other words, oil is getting uncompetitive even at low prices

258
0:12:21.185,000 --> 0:12:25,000
before it becomes unavailable even at high prices.

259
0:12:25.278,000 --> 0:12:27,000
But the electrified vehicles

260
0:12:28.204,000 --> 0:12:3,000
don't need to burden the electricity grid.

261
0:12:30.981,000 --> 0:12:33,000
Rather, when smart autos exchange electricity and information

262
0:12:34.416,000 --> 0:12:36,000
through smart buildings with smart grids,

263
0:12:36.842,000 --> 0:12:39,000
they're adding to the grid valuable flexibility and storage

264
0:12:40.158,000 --> 0:12:41,000
that help the grid integrate

265
0:12:42.008,000 --> 0:12:44,000
varying solar and wind power.

266
0:12:44.855,000 --> 0:12:45,000
So the electrified autos

267
0:12:46.531,000 --> 0:12:48,000
make the auto and electricity problems

268
0:12:49.155,000 --> 0:12:51,000
easier to solve together than separately.

269
0:12:51.393,000 --> 0:12:52,000
And they also converge the oil story

270
0:12:53.224,000 --> 0:12:55,000
with our second big story,

271
0:12:55.808,000 --> 0:12:58,000
saving electricity and then making it differently.

272
0:12:59.568,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And those twin revolutions in electricity

273
0:13:02.55,000 --> 0:13:05,000
will bring to that sector

274
0:13:05.604,000 --> 0:13:07,000
more numerous and profound and diverse disruptions

275
0:13:08.389,000 --> 0:13:09,000
than any other sector,

276
0:13:09.75,000 --> 0:13:13,000
because we've got 21st century technology and speed colliding head-on

277
0:13:13.965,000 --> 0:13:17,000
with 20th and 19th century institutions, rules and cultures.

278
0:13:18.66,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Changing how we make electricity gets easier

279
0:13:21.735,000 --> 0:13:23,000
if we need less of it.

280
0:13:24.25,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Most of it now is wasted

281
0:13:25.912,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and the technologies for saving it

282
0:13:27.893,000 --> 0:13:29,000
keep improving faster than we're installing them.

283
0:13:30.847,000 --> 0:13:32,000
So the unbought efficiency resource

284
0:13:33.293,000 --> 0:13:35,000
keeps getting ever bigger and cheaper.

285
0:13:36.193,000 --> 0:13:39,000
But as efficiency in buildings and industry

286
0:13:39.255,000 --> 0:13:4,000
starts to grow faster than the economy,

287
0:13:41.227,000 --> 0:13:45,000
America's electricity use could actually shrink,

288
0:13:45.65,000 --> 0:13:48,000
even with the little extra use required

289
0:13:49.247,000 --> 0:13:5,000
for those efficient electrified autos.

290
0:13:51.227,000 --> 0:13:55,000
And we can do this just by reasonably accelerating existing trends.

291
0:13:56.055,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Over the next 40 years, buildings,

292
0:13:58.393,000 --> 0:14:,000
which use three-quarters of the electricity,

293
0:14:00.601,000 --> 0:14:03,000
can triple or quadruple their energy productivity,

294
0:14:04.435,000 --> 0:14:07,000
saving 1.4 trillion dollars, net present value,

295
0:14:08.36,000 --> 0:14:11,000
with a 33 percent internal rate of return

296
0:14:11.96,000 --> 0:14:12,000
or in English,

297
0:14:13.631,000 --> 0:14:16,000
the savings are worth four times what they cost.

298
0:14:16.827,000 --> 0:14:18,000
And industry can accelerate too,

299
0:14:19.065,000 --> 0:14:2,000
doubling its energy productivity

300
0:14:20.781,000 --> 0:14:22,000
with a 21 percent internal rate of return.

301
0:14:23.729,000 --> 0:14:25,000
The key is a disruptive innovation

302
0:14:25.768,000 --> 0:14:27,000
that we call integrative design

303
0:14:28.591,000 --> 0:14:3,000
that often makes very big energy savings

304
0:14:31.519,000 --> 0:14:33,000
cost less than small or no savings.

305
0:14:33.996,000 --> 0:14:35,000
That is, it can give you expanding returns,

306
0:14:36.624,000 --> 0:14:37,000
not diminishing returns.

307
0:14:38.478,000 --> 0:14:41,000
That is how our 2010 retrofit

308
0:14:42.224,000 --> 0:14:45,000
is saving over two-fifths of the energy in the Empire State Building --

309
0:14:45.427,000 --> 0:14:49,000
remanufacturing those six and a half thousand windows on site

310
0:14:49.581,000 --> 0:14:53,000
into super windows that pass light, but reflect heat.

311
0:14:53.893,000 --> 0:14:56,000
plus better lights and office equipment and such

312
0:14:57.078,000 --> 0:15:,000
cut the maximum cooling load by a third.

313
0:15:00.693,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And then renovating smaller chillers instead of adding bigger ones

314
0:15:05.76,000 --> 0:15:06,000
saved 17 million dollars of

315
0:15:07.283,000 --> 0:15:1,000
capital cost, which helped pay for the other improvements

316
0:15:10.66,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and reduce the payback to just three years.

317
0:15:14.704,000 --> 0:15:16,000
Integrative design can also increase

318
0:15:16.927,000 --> 0:15:18,000
energy savings in industry.

319
0:15:19.135,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Dow's billion-dollar efficiency investment

320
0:15:21.127,000 --> 0:15:24,000
has already returned nine billion dollars.

321
0:15:24.427,000 --> 0:15:26,000
But industry as a whole has another half-trillion dollars

322
0:15:27.373,000 --> 0:15:29,000
of energy still to save.

323
0:15:29.568,000 --> 0:15:33,000
For example, three-fifths of the world's electricity runs motors.

324
0:15:34.127,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Half of that runs pumps and fans.

325
0:15:36.196,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And those can all be made more efficient,

326
0:15:39.07,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and the motors that turn them

327
0:15:40.785,000 --> 0:15:43,000
can have their system efficiency roughly doubled

328
0:15:44.435,000 --> 0:15:47,000
by integrating 35 improvements, paying back in about a year.

329
0:15:48.35,000 --> 0:15:51,000
But first we ought to be capturing bigger, cheaper savings

330
0:15:51.578,000 --> 0:15:53,000
that are normally ignored and are not in the textbooks.

331
0:15:54.227,000 --> 0:15:57,000
For example, pumps, the biggest use of motors,

332
0:15:57.381,000 --> 0:15:58,000
move liquid through pipes.

333
0:15:59.198,000 --> 0:16:,000
But a standard industrial pumping loop

334
0:16:00.998,000 --> 0:16:04,000
was redesigned to use at least 86 percent less energy,

335
0:16:05.375,000 --> 0:16:06,000
not by getting better pumps,

336
0:16:07.314,000 --> 0:16:1,000
but just by replacing long, thin, crooked pipes

337
0:16:10.696,000 --> 0:16:12,000
with fat, short, straight pipes.

338
0:16:13.312,000 --> 0:16:16,000
This is not about new technology,

339
0:16:16.527,000 --> 0:16:17,000
it's just rearranging our metal furniture.

340
0:16:18.504,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Of course, it also shrinks the pumping equipment

341
0:16:20.858,000 --> 0:16:21,000
and its capital costs.

342
0:16:22.573,000 --> 0:16:24,000
So what do such savings mean

343
0:16:25.193,000 --> 0:16:28,000
for the electricity that is three-fifths used in motors?

344
0:16:28.875,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Well, from the coal burned at the power plant

345
0:16:31.975,000 --> 0:16:34,000
through all these compounding losses,

346
0:16:35.096,000 --> 0:16:37,000
only a tenth of the fuel energy

347
0:16:37.919,000 --> 0:16:4,000
actually ends up coming out the pipe as flow.

348
0:16:40.919,000 --> 0:16:43,000
But now let's turn those compounding losses around backwards,

349
0:16:44.593,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and every unit of flow or friction that we save in the pipe

350
0:16:50.224,000 --> 0:16:54,000
saves 10 units of fuel cost, pollution

351
0:16:54.368,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and what Hunter Lovins calls "global weirding"

352
0:16:56.991,000 --> 0:16:57,000
back at the power plant.

353
0:16:58.393,000 --> 0:16:59,000
And of course, as you go back upstream,

354
0:17:00.085,000 --> 0:17:03,000
the components get smaller and therefore cheaper.

355
0:17:03.385,000 --> 0:17:07,000
Our team has lately found such snowballing energy savings

356
0:17:07.965,000 --> 0:17:1,000
in more than 30 billion dollars worth of industrial redesigns --

357
0:17:11.198,000 --> 0:17:13,000
everything from data centers and chip fabs

358
0:17:13.927,000 --> 0:17:15,000
to mines and refineries.

359
0:17:16.119,000 --> 0:17:17,000
Typically our retrofit designs

360
0:17:17.56,000 --> 0:17:19,000
save about 30 to 60 percent of the energy

361
0:17:20.514,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and pay back in a few years,

362
0:17:22.46,000 --> 0:17:26,000
while the new facility designs save 40 to 90-odd percent

363
0:17:26.629,000 --> 0:17:28,000
with generally lower capital cost.

364
0:17:29.06,000 --> 0:17:32,000
Now needing less electricity

365
0:17:32.124,000 --> 0:17:34,000
would ease and speed

366
0:17:34.439,000 --> 0:17:37,000
the shift to new sources of electricity, chiefly renewables.

367
0:17:37.601,000 --> 0:17:41,000
China leads their explosive growth and their plummeting cost.

368
0:17:42.085,000 --> 0:17:45,000
In fact, these solar power module costs

369
0:17:45.506,000 --> 0:17:47,000
have just fallen off the bottom of the chart.

370
0:17:47.885,000 --> 0:17:5,000
And Germany now has more solar workers

371
0:17:50.955,000 --> 0:17:52,000
than America has steel workers.

372
0:17:53.593,000 --> 0:17:54,000
Already in about 20 states

373
0:17:55.439,000 --> 0:17:57,000
private installers will come

374
0:17:57.793,000 --> 0:18:,000
put those cheap solar cells on your roof with no money down

375
0:18:01.278,000 --> 0:18:02,000
and beat your utility bill.

376
0:18:03.147,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Such unregulated products

377
0:18:05.339,000 --> 0:18:07,000
could ultimately add up to a virtual utility

378
0:18:08.193,000 --> 0:18:1,000
that bypasses your electric company

379
0:18:11.147,000 --> 0:18:14,000
just as your cellphone bypassed your wireline phone company.

380
0:18:14.978,000 --> 0:18:17,000
And this sort of thing gives utility executives the heebee-jeebees

381
0:18:18.396,000 --> 0:18:2,000
and it gives venture capitalists sweet dreams.

382
0:18:20.619,000 --> 0:18:23,000
Renewables are no longer a fringe activity.

383
0:18:23.712,000 --> 0:18:25,000
For each of the past four years

384
0:18:26.189,000 --> 0:18:28,000
half of the world's new generating capacity

385
0:18:29.027,000 --> 0:18:3,000
has been renewable,

386
0:18:30.624,000 --> 0:18:31,000
mainly lately in developing countries.

387
0:18:32.316,000 --> 0:18:36,000
In 2010, renewables other than big hydro,

388
0:18:36.608,000 --> 0:18:38,000
particularly wind and solar cells,

389
0:18:38.939,000 --> 0:18:42,000
got 151 billion dollars of private investment,

390
0:18:43.931,000 --> 0:18:45,000
and they actually surpassed the total installed capacity

391
0:18:46.516,000 --> 0:18:47,000
of nuclear power in the world

392
0:18:48.201,000 --> 0:18:51,000
by adding 60 billion watts in that one year.

393
0:18:51.66,000 --> 0:18:54,000
That happens to be the same amount of solar cell capacity

394
0:18:55.36,000 --> 0:18:57,000
that the world can now make every year --

395
0:18:58.175,000 --> 0:19:01,000
a number that goes up 60 or 70 percent a year.

396
0:19:01.522,000 --> 0:19:06,000
In contrast, the net additions of nuclear capacity and coal capacity

397
0:19:07.055,000 --> 0:19:1,000
and the orders behind those keep fading

398
0:19:10.624,000 --> 0:19:12,000
because they cost too much and they have too much financial risk.

399
0:19:13.16,000 --> 0:19:14,000
In fact in this country,

400
0:19:14.56,000 --> 0:19:16,000
no new nuclear power plant

401
0:19:16.675,000 --> 0:19:18,000
has been able to raise any private construction capital,

402
0:19:19.193,000 --> 0:19:23,000
despite seven years of 100-plus percent subsidies.

403
0:19:23.608,000 --> 0:19:27,000
So how else could we replace the coal-fired power plants?

404
0:19:27.612,000 --> 0:19:3,000
Well efficiency and gas can displace them all

405
0:19:31.381,000 --> 0:19:33,000
at just below their operating cost

406
0:19:34.065,000 --> 0:19:37,000
and, combined with renewables, can displace them more than 23 times

407
0:19:37.819,000 --> 0:19:39,000
at less than their replacement cost.

408
0:19:39.893,000 --> 0:19:41,000
But we only need to replace them once.

409
0:19:41.901,000 --> 0:19:43,000
We're often told though

410
0:19:44.589,000 --> 0:19:46,000
that only coal and nuclear plants can keep the lights on,

411
0:19:46.97,000 --> 0:19:47,000
because they're 24/7,

412
0:19:48.255,000 --> 0:19:5,000
whereas wind and solar power are variable,

413
0:19:51.078,000 --> 0:19:54,000
and hence supposedly unreliable.

414
0:19:54.093,000 --> 0:19:57,000
Actually no generator is 24/7. They all break.

415
0:19:57.478,000 --> 0:19:59,000
And when a big plant goes down,

416
0:19:59.593,000 --> 0:20:01,000
you lose a thousand megawatts in milliseconds,

417
0:20:02.385,000 --> 0:20:05,000
often for weeks or months, often without warning.

418
0:20:05.878,000 --> 0:20:06,000
That is exactly why we've designed the grid

419
0:20:07.875,000 --> 0:20:11,000
to back up failed plants with working plants.

420
0:20:12.145,000 --> 0:20:13,000
And in exactly the same way,

421
0:20:13.875,000 --> 0:20:18,000
the grid can handle wind and solar power's

422
0:20:18.906,000 --> 0:20:2,000
forecastable variations.

423
0:20:21.455,000 --> 0:20:24,000
Hourly simulations

424
0:20:24.762,000 --> 0:20:27,000
show that largely or wholly renewable grids

425
0:20:28.529,000 --> 0:20:29,000
can deliver highly reliable power

426
0:20:30.306,000 --> 0:20:31,000
when they're forecasted,

427
0:20:31.935,000 --> 0:20:33,000
integrated and diversified

428
0:20:33.989,000 --> 0:20:35,000
by both type and location.

429
0:20:36.042,000 --> 0:20:4,000
And that's true both for continental areas like the U.S. or Europe

430
0:20:40.265,000 --> 0:20:44,000
and for smaller areas embedded within a larger grid.

431
0:20:44.75,000 --> 0:20:45,000
That is how, for example,

432
0:20:46.389,000 --> 0:20:48,000
four German states in 2010

433
0:20:48.773,000 --> 0:20:5,000
were 43 to 52 percent wind powered.

434
0:20:51.385,000 --> 0:20:54,000
Portugal was 45 percent renewable powered,

435
0:20:55.027,000 --> 0:20:57,000
Denmark 36.

436
0:20:57.352,000 --> 0:21:,000
And it's how all of Europe can shift

437
0:21:00.637,000 --> 0:21:01,000
to renewable electricity.

438
0:21:01.922,000 --> 0:21:05,000
In America, our aging, dirty and insecure power system

439
0:21:06.647,000 --> 0:21:08,000
has to be replaced anyway by 2050.

440
0:21:09.531,000 --> 0:21:1,000
And whatever we replace it with

441
0:21:11.158,000 --> 0:21:12,000
is going to cost about the same,

442
0:21:12.596,000 --> 0:21:14,000
about six trillion dollars at present value --

443
0:21:15.306,000 --> 0:21:17,000
whether we buy more of what we've got

444
0:21:17.514,000 --> 0:21:19,000
or new nuclear and so-called clean coal,

445
0:21:19.627,000 --> 0:21:22,000
or renewables that are more or less centralized.

446
0:21:23.258,000 --> 0:21:26,000
But those four futures at the same cost

447
0:21:26.527,000 --> 0:21:28,000
differ profoundly in their risks,

448
0:21:28.596,000 --> 0:21:3,000
around national security,

449
0:21:31.127,000 --> 0:21:34,000
fuel, water, finance, technology,

450
0:21:34.665,000 --> 0:21:35,000
climate and health.

451
0:21:36.196,000 --> 0:21:38,000
For example, our over-centralized grid

452
0:21:39.031,000 --> 0:21:42,000
is very vulnerable to cascading

453
0:21:42.962,000 --> 0:21:44,000
and potentially economy-shattering blackouts

454
0:21:45.689,000 --> 0:21:48,000
caused by bad space weather or other natural disasters

455
0:21:49.127,000 --> 0:21:5,000
or a terrorist attack.

456
0:21:51.073,000 --> 0:21:53,000
But that blackout risk disappears,

457
0:21:53.804,000 --> 0:21:54,000
and all of the other risks are best managed,

458
0:21:55.796,000 --> 0:21:57,000
with distributed renewables

459
0:21:58.05,000 --> 0:22:02,000
organized into local micro-grids that normally interconnect,

460
0:22:02.327,000 --> 0:22:03,000
but can stand alone at need.

461
0:22:04.135,000 --> 0:22:06,000
That is, they can disconnect fractally

462
0:22:06.173,000 --> 0:22:08,000
and then reconnect seamlessly.

463
0:22:09.027,000 --> 0:22:12,000
That approach is exactly what the Pentagon is adopting

464
0:22:12.304,000 --> 0:22:13,000
for its own power supply.

465
0:22:13.619,000 --> 0:22:16,000
They think they need that; how about the rest of us that they're defending?

466
0:22:16.885,000 --> 0:22:17,000
We want our stuff to work too.

467
0:22:18.585,000 --> 0:22:21,000
At about the same cost as business as usual,

468
0:22:22.155,000 --> 0:22:24,000
this would maximize national security,

469
0:22:24.16,000 --> 0:22:28,000
customer choice, entrepreneurial opportunity

470
0:22:28.162,000 --> 0:22:29,000
and innovation.

471
0:22:29.785,000 --> 0:22:34,000
Together, efficient use and diverse dispersed renewable supply

472
0:22:35.46,000 --> 0:22:37,000
are starting to transform the whole electricity sector.

473
0:22:38.383,000 --> 0:22:39,000
Traditionally utilities build

474
0:22:40.014,000 --> 0:22:42,000
a lot of giant coal and nuclear plants

475
0:22:42.183,000 --> 0:22:43,000
and a bunch of big gas plants

476
0:22:44.129,000 --> 0:22:45,000
and maybe a little bit of efficiency renewables.

477
0:22:45.198,000 --> 0:22:47,000
And those utilities were rewarded,

478
0:22:47.727,000 --> 0:22:49,000
as they still are in 34 states,

479
0:22:50.181,000 --> 0:22:53,000
for selling you more electricity.

480
0:22:53.647,000 --> 0:22:55,000
However, especially where regulators

481
0:22:56.445,000 --> 0:22:59,000
are now instead rewarding cutting your bills,

482
0:22:59.998,000 --> 0:23:02,000
the investments are shifting radically

483
0:23:03.781,000 --> 0:23:05,000
toward efficiency, demand response, cogeneration,

484
0:23:06.312,000 --> 0:23:09,000
renewables and ways to knit them all together reliably

485
0:23:09.681,000 --> 0:23:1,000
with less transmission

486
0:23:11.104,000 --> 0:23:13,000
and little or no bulk electricity storage.

487
0:23:13.958,000 --> 0:23:15,000
So our energy future is not fate, but choice,

488
0:23:16.785,000 --> 0:23:18,000
and that choice is very flexible.

489
0:23:19.531,000 --> 0:23:2,000
In 1976, for example,

490
0:23:21.131,000 --> 0:23:22,000
government and industry insisted

491
0:23:22.955,000 --> 0:23:24,000
that the amount of energy needed to make a dollar of GDP

492
0:23:25.539,000 --> 0:23:26,000
could never go down.

493
0:23:27.322,000 --> 0:23:3,000
And I heretically suggested it could go down several-fold.

494
0:23:30.952,000 --> 0:23:32,000
Well that's what's actually happened so far.

495
0:23:33.216,000 --> 0:23:34,000
It's fallen by half.

496
0:23:34.531,000 --> 0:23:36,000
But with today's much better technologies,

497
0:23:37.022,000 --> 0:23:39,000
more mature delivery channels and integrative design,

498
0:23:39.931,000 --> 0:23:42,000
we can do far more and even cheaper.

499
0:23:43.831,000 --> 0:23:45,000
So to solve the energy problem,

500
0:23:46.339,000 --> 0:23:47,000
we just needed to enlarge it.

501
0:23:48.26,000 --> 0:23:51,000
And the results may at first seem incredible,

502
0:23:51.46,000 --> 0:23:52,000
but as Marshall McLuhan said,

503
0:23:53.237,000 --> 0:23:55,000
"Only puny secrets need protection.

504
0:23:55.989,000 --> 0:24:01,000
Big discoveries are protected by public incredulity."

505
0:24:02.073,000 --> 0:24:05,000
Now combine the electricity and oil revolutions,

506
0:24:05.555,000 --> 0:24:06,000
both driven by modern efficiency,

507
0:24:07.239,000 --> 0:24:1,000
and you get the really big story: reinventing fire,

508
0:24:10.781,000 --> 0:24:15,000
where business enabled and sped by smart policies in mindful markets

509
0:24:15.912,000 --> 0:24:19,000
can lead the United States completely off oil and coal by 2050,

510
0:24:20.442,000 --> 0:24:22,000
saving 5 trillion dollars,

511
0:24:22.762,000 --> 0:24:24,000
growing the economy 2.6-fold,

512
0:24:25.355,000 --> 0:24:26,000
strengthening out national security,

513
0:24:26.998,000 --> 0:24:28,000
oh, and by the way, by getting rid of the oil and coal,

514
0:24:29.983,000 --> 0:24:33,000
reducing the fossil carbon emissions by 82 to 86 percent.

515
0:24:34.493,000 --> 0:24:37,000
Now if you like any of those outcomes,

516
0:24:37.827,000 --> 0:24:39,000
you can support reinventing fire

517
0:24:40.019,000 --> 0:24:41,000
without needing to like all of them

518
0:24:41.881,000 --> 0:24:44,000
and without needing to agree about which of them is most important.

519
0:24:45.304,000 --> 0:24:48,000
So focusing on outcomes, not motives,

520
0:24:48.381,000 --> 0:24:5,000
can turn gridlock and conflict

521
0:24:50.937,000 --> 0:24:54,000
into a unifying solution to America's energy challenge.

522
0:24:55.239,000 --> 0:24:58,000
This also turns out to be the best way

523
0:24:58.296,000 --> 0:25:,000
to cope with global challenges --

524
0:25:00.796,000 --> 0:25:02,000
climate change, nuclear proliferation,

525
0:25:03.375,000 --> 0:25:05,000
energy insecurity, energy poverty --

526
0:25:05.806,000 --> 0:25:08,000
all of which make us less safe.

527
0:25:09.452,000 --> 0:25:12,000
Now our team at RMI helps smart companies

528
0:25:13.139,000 --> 0:25:16,000
to get unstuck and speed this journey

529
0:25:16.208,000 --> 0:25:19,000
via six sectoral initiatives, with some more hatching.

530
0:25:19.27,000 --> 0:25:21,000
Of course there's still a lot of old thinking out there too.

531
0:25:22.227,000 --> 0:25:25,000
Former oil man Maurice Strong said,

532
0:25:25.404,000 --> 0:25:26,000
"Not all the fossils are in the fuel."

533
0:25:27.35,000 --> 0:25:31,000
But as Edgar Woolard, who used to chair Dupont, reminds us,

534
0:25:31.655,000 --> 0:25:35,000
"Companies hampered by old thinking won't be a problem

535
0:25:35.801,000 --> 0:25:4,000
because," he said," they simply won't be around long-term."

536
0:25:41.381,000 --> 0:25:43,000
I've described not just a once-in-a-civilization

537
0:25:44.245,000 --> 0:25:45,000
business opportunity,

538
0:25:45.852,000 --> 0:25:47,000
but one of the most profound transitions

539
0:25:48.275,000 --> 0:25:5,000
in the history of our species.

540
0:25:50.791,000 --> 0:25:53,000
We humans are inventing a new fire,

541
0:25:54.214,000 --> 0:25:55,000
not dug from below,

542
0:25:55.958,000 --> 0:25:57,000
but flowing from above;

543
0:25:58.865,000 --> 0:26:,000
not scarce, but bountiful;

544
0:26:01.796,000 --> 0:26:02,000
not local, but everywhere;

545
0:26:03.496,000 --> 0:26:05,000
not transient, but permanent;

546
0:26:06.127,000 --> 0:26:08,000
not costly, but free.

547
0:26:09.027,000 --> 0:26:12,000
And but for a little transitional tail of natural gas

548
0:26:12.427,000 --> 0:26:15,000
and a bit of biofuel grown in ways that sustain and endure,

549
0:26:15.989,000 --> 0:26:18,000
this new fire is flameless.

550
0:26:19.698,000 --> 0:26:23,000
Efficiently used, it really can do our work

551
0:26:23.762,000 --> 0:26:25,000
without working our undoing.

552
0:26:26.616,000 --> 0:26:3,000
Each of you owns a piece of that $5 trillion prize.

553
0:26:31.498,000 --> 0:26:33,000
And our new book "Reinventing Fire"

554
0:26:33.752,000 --> 0:26:35,000
describes how you can capture it.

555
0:26:36.137,000 --> 0:26:38,000
So with the conversation just begun

556
0:26:38.406,000 --> 0:26:39,000
at ReinventingFire.com,

557
0:26:40.291,000 --> 0:26:42,000
let me invite you each

558
0:26:42.422,000 --> 0:26:45,000
to engage with us and with each other, with everyone around you,

559
0:26:46.26,000 --> 0:26:48,000
to help make the world richer, fairer,

560
0:26:49.052,000 --> 0:26:51,000
cooler and safer

561
0:26:51.66,000 --> 0:26:53,000
by together reinventing fire.

562
0:26:54.468,000 --> 0:26:55,000
Thank you.

563
0:26:56.327,000 --> 0:26:57,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Because of what I'm about to say,

2
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I really should establish my green credentials.

3
0:00:21.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
When I was a small boy, I took my pledge

4
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
as an American, to save and faithfully defend from waste

5
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the natural resources of my country,

6
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:31,000
its air, soil and minerals, its forests, waters and wildlife.

7
0:00:31.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I've stuck to that.

8
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Stanford, I majored in ecology and evolution.

9
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
1968, I put out the Whole Earth Catalog. Was "mister natural" for a while.

10
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And then worked for the Jerry Brown administration.

11
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The Brown administration, and a bunch of my friends,

12
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:5,000
basically leveled the energy efficiency of California,

13
0:00:50.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
so it's the same now, 30 years later,

14
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
even though our economy has gone up 80 percent, per capita.

15
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
And we are putting out less greenhouse gasses than any other state.

16
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:03,000
California is basically the equivalent of Europe, in this.

17
0:01:03.16,000 --> 0:01:08,000
This year, Whole Earth Catalog has a supplement that I'll preview today,

18
0:01:08.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
called Whole Earth Discipline.

19
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
The dominant demographic event of our time

20
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:16,000
is this screamingly rapid urbanization

21
0:01:16.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
that we have going on.

22
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:22,000
By mid-century we'll be about 80 percent urban,

23
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and that's mostly in the developing world,

24
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
where that's happening.

25
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
It's interesting, because history is driven to a large degree

26
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
by the size of cities.

27
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:35,000
The developing world now has all of the biggest cities,

28
0:01:35.16,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and they are developing three times faster than the developed countries,

29
0:01:38.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and nine times bigger.

30
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It's qualitatively different.

31
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They are the drivers of history, as we see by looking at history.

32
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:49,000
1,000 years ago this is what the world looked like.

33
0:01:49.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Well we now have a distribution of urban power

34
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
similar to what we had 1,000 years ago.

35
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
In other words, the rise of the West,

36
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
dramatic as it was, is over.

37
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The aggregate numbers are absolutely overwhelming:

38
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
1.3 million people a week coming to town,

39
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:09,000
decade after decade.

40
0:02:09.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
What's really going on?

41
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Well, what's going on is the villages of the world are emptying out.

42
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Subsistence farming is drying up basically.

43
0:02:17.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
People are following opportunity into town.

44
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And this is why.

45
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
I used to have a very romantic idea about villages,

46
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and it's because I never lived in one.

47
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Because in town --

49
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:31,000
this is the bustling squatter city

50
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
of Kibera, near Nairobi --

51
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
they see action. They see opportunity.

52
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
They see a cash economy that they were not able to participate in

53
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
back in the subsistence farm.

54
0:02:43.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
As you go around these places there's plenty of aesthetics.

55
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:47,000
There is plenty going on.

56
0:02:47.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
They are poor, but they are intensely urban. And they are intensely creative.

57
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
The aggregate numbers now

58
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:56,000
are that basically squatters,

59
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
all one billion of them, are building the urban world,

60
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which means they're building the world --

61
0:03:02.16,000 --> 0:03:04,000
personally, one by one, family by family,

62
0:03:04.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
clan by clan, neighborhood by neighborhood.

63
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
They start flimsy and they get substantial as time goes by.

64
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
They even build their own infrastructure.

65
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Well, steal their own infrastructure, at first.

66
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Cable TV, water, the whole gamut, all gets stolen.

67
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And then gradually gentrifies.

68
0:03:23.16,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It is not the case that slums undermine prosperity,

69
0:03:26.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
not the working slums; they help create prosperity.

70
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So in a town like Mumbai, which is half slums,

71
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
it's 1/6th of the GDP of India.

72
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
Social capital in the slums is at its most urban and dense.

73
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
These people are valuable as a group.

74
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And that's how they work.

75
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
There is a lot of people who think about all these poor people,

76
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"Oh there's terrible things. We've got to fix their housing."

77
0:03:51.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
It used to be, "Oh we've got to get them phone service."

78
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Now they're showing us how they do their phone service.

79
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Famine mostly is a rural event now.

80
0:03:58.16,000 --> 0:04:,000
There are things they care about.

81
0:04:00.16,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And this is where we can help.

82
0:04:03.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
And the nations they're in can help.

83
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And they are helping each other solve these issues.

84
0:04:08.16,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And you go to a nice dense place like this slum in Mumbai.

85
0:04:12.16,000 --> 0:04:14,000
You look at that lane on the right.

86
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And you can ask, "Okay what's going on there?"

87
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The answer is, "Everything."

88
0:04:19.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
This is better than a mall. It's much denser.

89
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's much more interactive.

90
0:04:24.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And the scale is terrific.

91
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:3,000
The main event is, these are not people crushed by poverty.

92
0:04:30.16,000 --> 0:04:32,000
These are people busy getting out of poverty

93
0:04:32.16,000 --> 0:04:34,000
just as fast as they can.

94
0:04:34.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
They're helping each other do it.

95
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They're doing it through an outlaw thing,

96
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
the informal economy.

97
0:04:40.16,000 --> 0:04:44,000
The informal economy, it's sort of like dark energy in astrophysics:

98
0:04:44.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
it's not supposed to be there, but it's huge.

99
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
We don't understand how it works yet, but we have to.

100
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Furthermore, people in the informal economy,

101
0:04:51.16,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the gray economy --

102
0:04:53.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
as time goes by,

103
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:59,000
crime is happening around them. And they can join the criminal world,

104
0:04:59.16,000 --> 0:05:03,000
or they can join the legitimate world.

105
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We should be able to make that choice

106
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:07,000
easier for them to get toward the legitimate world,

107
0:05:07.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
because if we don't, they will go toward the criminal world.

108
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There's all kinds of activity.

109
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:16,000
In Dharavi the slum performs not only

110
0:05:16.16,000 --> 0:05:18,000
a lot of services for itself,

111
0:05:18.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but it performs services for the city at large.

112
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And one of the main events are these ad-hoc schools.

113
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Parents pool their money to hire some local teachers

114
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
to a private, tiny, unofficial school.

115
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Education is more possible in the cities, and that changes the world.

116
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So you see some interesting, typical, urban things.

117
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So one thing slammed up against another,

118
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:42,000
such as in Sao Paulo here.

119
0:05:42.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
That's what cities do. That's how they create value,

120
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:46,000
is by slamming things together.

121
0:05:46.16,000 --> 0:05:48,000
In this case, supply right next to demand.

122
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So the maids and the gardeners and the guards

123
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:53,000
that live in this lively part of town on the left

124
0:05:53.16,000 --> 0:05:58,000
walk to work, in the boring, rich neighborhood.

125
0:05:58.16,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Proximity is amazing.

126
0:06:01.16,000 --> 0:06:04,000
We are learning about how dense proximity can be.

127
0:06:16.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Connectivity between the city and the country

128
0:06:19.16,000 --> 0:06:22,000
is what's going to keep the country good,

129
0:06:22.16,000 --> 0:06:25,000
because the city has interesting ways of doing things.

130
0:06:34.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
This is what makes cities --

131
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:4,000
(Applause)

132
0:06:40.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
this is what makes cities so green in the developing world.

133
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Because people leave the poverty trap, an ecological disaster

134
0:06:46.16,000 --> 0:06:49,000
of subsistence farms, and head to town.

135
0:06:49.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
And when they're gone the natural environment

136
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:53,000
starts to come back very rapidly.

137
0:06:53.16,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And those who remain in the village can shift over to cash crops

138
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:07:,000
to send food to the new growing markets in town.

139
0:07:00.16,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So if you want to save a village, you do it with a good road,

140
0:07:03.16,000 --> 0:07:07,000
or with a good cell phone connection, and ideally some grid electrical power.

141
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So the event is: we're a city planet. That just happened.

142
0:07:10.16,000 --> 0:07:12,000
More than half.

143
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:15,000
The numbers are considerable. A billion live in the squatter cities now.

144
0:07:15.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Another billion is expected.

145
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
That's more than a sixth of humanity living a certain way.

146
0:07:21.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And that will determine a lot of how we function.

147
0:07:25.16,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Now, for us environmentalists,

148
0:07:27.16,000 --> 0:07:3,000
maybe the greenest thing about the cities is they diffuse the population bomb.

149
0:07:30.16,000 --> 0:07:33,000
People get into town.

150
0:07:33.16,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The immediately have fewer children.

151
0:07:35.16,000 --> 0:07:38,000
They don't even have to get rich yet. Just the opportunity of

152
0:07:38.16,000 --> 0:07:42,000
coming up in the world means they will have fewer, higher-quality kids,

153
0:07:42.16,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and the birthrate goes down radically.

154
0:07:44.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Very interesting side effect here,

155
0:07:46.16,000 --> 0:07:48,000
here's a slide from Phillip Longman.

156
0:07:48.16,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Shows what is happening.

157
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:52,000
As we have more and more old people, like me,

158
0:07:52.16,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and fewer and fewer babies.

159
0:07:54.16,000 --> 0:07:57,000
And they are regionally separated.

160
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
What you're getting is a world which is

161
0:07:59.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
old folks, and old cities, going around doing things the old way,

162
0:08:04.16,000 --> 0:08:06,000
in the north.

163
0:08:06.16,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And young people in brand new cities they're inventing,

164
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
doing new things, in the south.

165
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:14,000
Where do you think the action is going to be?

166
0:08:14.16,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Shift of subject. Quickly drop by climate.

167
0:08:17.16,000 --> 0:08:19,000
The climate news, I'm sorry to say, is going to keep getting worse

168
0:08:19.16,000 --> 0:08:22,000
than we think, faster than we think.

169
0:08:22.16,000 --> 0:08:24,000
Climate is a profoundly complex, nonlinear system,

170
0:08:24.16,000 --> 0:08:27,000
full of runaway positive feedbacks,

171
0:08:27.16,000 --> 0:08:29,000
hidden thresholds and irrevocable tipping points.

172
0:08:29.16,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Here's just a few samples.

173
0:08:32.16,000 --> 0:08:34,000
We're going to keep being surprised. And almost all

174
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the surprises are going to be bad ones.

175
0:08:36.16,000 --> 0:08:39,000
From your standpoint this means

176
0:08:39.16,000 --> 0:08:41,000
a great increase in climate refugees

177
0:08:41.16,000 --> 0:08:43,000
over the coming decades,

178
0:08:43.16,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and what goes along with that, which is resource wars

179
0:08:46.16,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and chaos wars,

180
0:08:48.16,000 --> 0:08:5,000
as we're seeing in Darfur.

181
0:08:55.16,000 --> 0:08:57,000
That's what drought does.

182
0:08:57.16,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It brings carrying capacity down,

183
0:08:59.16,000 --> 0:09:01,000
and there's not enough carrying capacity

184
0:09:01.16,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to support the people. And then you're in trouble.

185
0:09:04.16,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Shift to the power situation.

186
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Baseload electricity is what it takes to run a city,

187
0:09:10.16,000 --> 0:09:12,000
or a city planet.

188
0:09:12.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So far there is only three sources of baseload electricity:

189
0:09:16.16,000 --> 0:09:19,000
coal, some gas,

190
0:09:19.16,000 --> 0:09:21,000
nuclear and hydro.

191
0:09:21.16,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Of those, only nuclear and hydro are green.

192
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Coal is what is causing the climate problems.

193
0:09:27.16,000 --> 0:09:29,000
And everyone will keep burning it

194
0:09:29.16,000 --> 0:09:32,000
because it's so cheap, until governments make it expensive.

195
0:09:32.16,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Wind and solar can't help, because so far we don't have a way to store that energy.

196
0:09:37.16,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So with hydro maxed out,

197
0:09:40.16,000 --> 0:09:43,000
coal and lose the climate,

198
0:09:43.16,000 --> 0:09:46,000
or nuclear, which is the current operating low-carbon source,

199
0:09:46.16,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and maybe save the climate.

200
0:09:48.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And if we can eventually get good solar in space,

201
0:09:51.16,000 --> 0:09:53,000
that also could help.

202
0:09:53.16,000 --> 0:09:58,000
Because remember, this is what drives the prosperity in the developing world

203
0:09:58.16,000 --> 0:10:01,000
in the villages and in the cities.

204
0:10:01.16,000 --> 0:10:03,000
So, between coal and nuclear,

205
0:10:03.16,000 --> 0:10:05,000
compare their waste products.

206
0:10:05.16,000 --> 0:10:09,000
If all of the electricity you used in your lifetime was nuclear,

207
0:10:09.16,000 --> 0:10:11,000
the amount of waste that would be added up

208
0:10:11.16,000 --> 0:10:14,000
would fit in a Coke can.

209
0:10:14.16,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Whereas a coal-burning plant,

210
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
a normal one gigawatt coal plant, burns 80 rail cars of coal a day,

211
0:10:20.16,000 --> 0:10:23,000
each car having 100 tons.

212
0:10:23.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And it puts 18 thousand tons

213
0:10:25.16,000 --> 0:10:29,000
of carbon dioxide in the air.

214
0:10:29.16,000 --> 0:10:31,000
So and then when you compare the lifetime emissions

215
0:10:31.16,000 --> 0:10:33,000
of these various energy forms,

216
0:10:33.16,000 --> 0:10:35,000
nuclear is about even with solar and wind,

217
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and ahead of solar --

218
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:4,000
oh, I'm sorry -- with hydro and wind, and ahead of solar.

219
0:10:40.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
And does nuclear really compete with coal?

220
0:10:42.16,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Just ask the coal miners in Australia.

221
0:10:44.16,000 --> 0:10:46,000
That's where you see some of the source,

222
0:10:46.16,000 --> 0:10:48,000
not from my fellow environmentalists,

223
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:51,000
but from people who feel threatened by nuclear power.

224
0:10:51.16,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Well the good news is that

225
0:10:53.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
the developing world, but frankly, the whole world,

226
0:10:55.16,000 --> 0:10:59,000
is busy building, and starting to build, nuclear reactors.

227
0:10:59.16,000 --> 0:11:01,000
This is good for the atmosphere.

228
0:11:01.16,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It's good for their prosperity.

229
0:11:03.16,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I want to point out one interesting thing,

230
0:11:05.16,000 --> 0:11:08,000
which is that environmentalists like the thing we call micropower.

231
0:11:08.16,000 --> 0:11:11,000
It's supposed to be, I don't know, local solar and wind and cogeneration,

232
0:11:11.16,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and good things like that.

233
0:11:13.16,000 --> 0:11:15,000
But frankly micro-reactors which are just now coming on,

234
0:11:15.16,000 --> 0:11:17,000
might serve even better.

235
0:11:17.16,000 --> 0:11:19,000
The Russians, who started this, are building floating reactors,

236
0:11:19.16,000 --> 0:11:23,000
for their new passage, where the ice is melting, north of Russia.

237
0:11:23.16,000 --> 0:11:26,000
And they're selling these floating reactors,

238
0:11:26.16,000 --> 0:11:3,000
only 35 megawatts, to developing countries.

239
0:11:30.16,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Here's the design of an early one from Toshiba.

240
0:11:32.16,000 --> 0:11:35,000
It's interesting, say, to take a 25-megawatt,

241
0:11:35.16,000 --> 0:11:37,000
25 million watts,

242
0:11:37.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and you compare it to the standard big iron

243
0:11:39.16,000 --> 0:11:43,000
of an ordinary Westinghouse or Ariva,

244
0:11:43.16,000 --> 0:11:46,000
which is 1.2, 1.6 billion watts.

245
0:11:46.16,000 --> 0:11:5,000
These things are way smaller. They're much more adaptable.

246
0:11:50.16,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Here's an American design from Lawrence Livermore Lab.

247
0:11:53.16,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Here's another American design that came out

248
0:11:55.16,000 --> 0:11:58,000
of Los Alamos, and is now commercial.

249
0:11:58.16,000 --> 0:12:,000
Almost all of these are not only small, they are proliferation-proof.

250
0:12:00.16,000 --> 0:12:03,000
They're typically buried in the ground.

251
0:12:03.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And the innovation is moving very rapidly.

252
0:12:05.16,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So I think microreactors is going to be important for the future.

253
0:12:08.16,000 --> 0:12:1,000
In terms of proliferation,

254
0:12:10.16,000 --> 0:12:12,000
nuclear energy has done more

255
0:12:12.16,000 --> 0:12:15,000
to dismantle nuclear weapons than any other activity.

256
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And that's why 10 percent of the electricity in this room,

257
0:12:19.16,000 --> 0:12:21,000
20 percent of electricity

258
0:12:21.16,000 --> 0:12:23,000
in this room is probably nuclear.

259
0:12:23.16,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Half of that is coming from dismantled warheads from Russia,

260
0:12:27.16,000 --> 0:12:3,000
soon to be joined by our dismantled warheads.

261
0:12:30.16,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And so I would like to see the GNEP program,

262
0:12:33.16,000 --> 0:12:36,000
that was developed in the Bush administration, go forward aggressively.

263
0:12:36.16,000 --> 0:12:38,000
And I was glad to see that president Obama

264
0:12:38.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
supported the nuclear fuel bank strategy

265
0:12:41.16,000 --> 0:12:43,000
when he spoke in Prague the other week.

266
0:12:43.16,000 --> 0:12:46,000
One more subject. Genetically engineered food crops,

267
0:12:46.16,000 --> 0:12:48,000
in my view, as a biologist,

268
0:12:48.16,000 --> 0:12:5,000
have no reason to be controversial.

269
0:12:50.16,000 --> 0:12:52,000
My fellow environmentalists, on this subject,

270
0:12:52.16,000 --> 0:12:56,000
have been irrational, anti-scientific, and very harmful.

271
0:12:56.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
Despite their best efforts,

272
0:12:58.16,000 --> 0:13:,000
genetically engineered crops are the most

273
0:13:00.16,000 --> 0:13:04,000
rapidly successful agricultural innovation in history.

274
0:13:04.16,000 --> 0:13:07,000
They're good for the environment because they enable no-till farming,

275
0:13:07.16,000 --> 0:13:09,000
which leaves the soil in place,

276
0:13:09.16,000 --> 0:13:11,000
getting healthier from year to year --

277
0:13:11.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
slso keeps less carbon dioxide going from the soil

278
0:13:13.16,000 --> 0:13:15,000
into the atmosphere.

279
0:13:15.16,000 --> 0:13:17,000
They reduce pesticide use.

280
0:13:17.16,000 --> 0:13:19,000
And they increase yield, which allows you to have your

281
0:13:19.16,000 --> 0:13:22,000
agricultural area be smaller,

282
0:13:22.16,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and therefore more wild area is freed up.

283
0:13:25.16,000 --> 0:13:27,000
By the way, this map from 2006

284
0:13:27.16,000 --> 0:13:29,000
is out of date because it shows Africa

285
0:13:29.16,000 --> 0:13:31,000
still under the thumb of Greenpeace,

286
0:13:31.16,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and Friends of the Earth from Europe,

287
0:13:34.16,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and they're finally getting out from under that.

288
0:13:36.16,000 --> 0:13:39,000
And biotech is moving rapidly in Africa, at last.

289
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
This is a moral issue.

290
0:13:41.16,000 --> 0:13:43,000
The Nuffield Council on Bioethics

291
0:13:43.16,000 --> 0:13:45,000
met on this issue twice in great detail

292
0:13:45.16,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and said it is a moral imperative

293
0:13:47.16,000 --> 0:13:5,000
to make genetically engineered crops readily available.

294
0:13:50.16,000 --> 0:13:53,000
Speaking of imperatives, geoengineering is taboo now,

295
0:13:53.16,000 --> 0:13:55,000
especially in government circles,

296
0:13:55.16,000 --> 0:13:57,000
though I think there was a DARPA meeting on it a couple of weeks ago,

297
0:13:57.16,000 --> 0:13:59,000
but it will be on your plate --

298
0:13:59.16,000 --> 0:14:02,000
not this year but pretty soon,

299
0:14:02.16,000 --> 0:14:05,000
because some harsh realizations are coming along.

300
0:14:05.16,000 --> 0:14:07,000
This is a list of them.

301
0:14:07.16,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Basically the news is going to keep getting more scary.

302
0:14:10.16,000 --> 0:14:12,000
There will be events,

303
0:14:12.16,000 --> 0:14:15,000
like 35,000 people dying of a heat wave,

304
0:14:15.16,000 --> 0:14:17,000
which happened a while back.

305
0:14:17.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Like cyclones coming up toward Bangladesh.

306
0:14:20.16,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Like wars over water,

307
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
such as in the Indus.

308
0:14:24.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And as those events keep happening

309
0:14:26.16,000 --> 0:14:28,000
we're going to say, "Okay, what can we do about that really?"

310
0:14:28.16,000 --> 0:14:33,000
But there's this little problem with geoengineering:

311
0:14:33.16,000 --> 0:14:37,000
what body is going to decide

312
0:14:37.16,000 --> 0:14:39,000
who gets to engineer? How much they do? Where they do it?

313
0:14:39.16,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Because everybody is downstream,

314
0:14:41.16,000 --> 0:14:44,000
downwind of whatever is done.

315
0:14:44.16,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And if we just taboo it completely

316
0:14:46.16,000 --> 0:14:48,000
we could lose civilization.

317
0:14:48.16,000 --> 0:14:51,000
But if we just say "OK,

318
0:14:51.16,000 --> 0:14:53,000
China, you're worried, you go ahead.

319
0:14:53.16,000 --> 0:14:57,000
You geoengineer your way. We'll geoengineer our way."

320
0:14:57.16,000 --> 0:15:,000
That would be considered an act of war by both nations.

321
0:15:00.16,000 --> 0:15:04,000
So this is very interesting diplomacy coming along.

322
0:15:04.16,000 --> 0:15:07,000
I should say, it is more practical than people think.

323
0:15:07.16,000 --> 0:15:1,000
Here is an example that climatologists like a lot,

324
0:15:10.16,000 --> 0:15:12,000
one of the dozens of geoengineering ideas.

325
0:15:12.16,000 --> 0:15:14,000
This one came from the sulfur dioxide

326
0:15:14.16,000 --> 0:15:17,000
from Mount Pinatubo in 1991 --

327
0:15:17.16,000 --> 0:15:21,000
cooled the earth by half a degree.

328
0:15:21.16,000 --> 0:15:23,000
There was so much ice in 1992, the following year,

329
0:15:23.16,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that there was a bumper crop of polar bear cubs

330
0:15:26.16,000 --> 0:15:28,000
who were known as the Pinatubo cubs.

331
0:15:28.16,000 --> 0:15:3,000
To put sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere

332
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:33,000
would cost on the order of a billion dollars a year.

333
0:15:33.16,000 --> 0:15:36,000
That's nothing, compared to all of the other

334
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:38,000
things we may be trying to do about energy.

335
0:15:38.16,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Just to run by another one:

336
0:15:41.16,000 --> 0:15:44,000
this is a plan to brighten the reflectance of ocean clouds,

337
0:15:44.16,000 --> 0:15:46,000
by atomizing seawater;

338
0:15:46.16,000 --> 0:15:48,000
that would brighten the albedo of the whole planet.

339
0:15:48.16,000 --> 0:15:5,000
A nice one, because it can happen

340
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:52,000
lots of little ways in lots of little places,

341
0:15:52.16,000 --> 0:15:54,000
is by copying the ancient Amazon Indians

342
0:15:54.16,000 --> 0:15:56,000
who made good agricultural soil

343
0:15:56.16,000 --> 0:16:,000
by pyrolizing, smoldering, plant waste,

344
0:16:00.16,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and biochar fixes large quantities of carbon

345
0:16:03.16,000 --> 0:16:05,000
while it's improving the soil.

346
0:16:05.16,000 --> 0:16:08,000
So here is where we are.

347
0:16:08.16,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Nobel Prize-winning climatologist Paul Crutzen

348
0:16:11.16,000 --> 0:16:14,000
calls our geological era the Anthropocene,

349
0:16:14.16,000 --> 0:16:17,000
the human-dominated era. We are stuck

350
0:16:17.16,000 --> 0:16:2,000
with its obligations.

351
0:16:20.16,000 --> 0:16:22,000
In the Whole Earth Catalog, my first words were,

352
0:16:22.16,000 --> 0:16:24,000
"We are as Gods, and might as well get good at it."

353
0:16:24.16,000 --> 0:16:27,000
The first words of Whole Earth Discipline

354
0:16:27.16,000 --> 0:16:31,000
are, "We are as Gods, and have to get good at it."

355
0:16:31.16,000 --> 0:16:33,000
Thank you.

356
0:16:33.16,000 --> 0:16:37,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.985,000 --> 0:00:13,000
It's funny the things you forget.

2
0:00:15.809,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I went to see my mother the other day, and she told me this story

3
0:00:19.523,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that I'd completely forgotten about

4
0:00:21.715,000 --> 0:00:24,000
how, when we were driving together, she would pull the car over,

5
0:00:25.125,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and by the time she had gotten out of the car,

6
0:00:27.305,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and gone around the car to let me out of the car,

7
0:00:29.773,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I would have already gotten out of the car

8
0:00:31.875,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and pretended to have died.

9
0:00:34.138,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

10
0:00:37.108,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Applause)

11
0:00:47.386,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Because that's how you die.

12
0:00:48.927,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:50.884,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And I remember, that was a game I used to play with myself

14
0:00:54.011,000 --> 0:00:57,000
to entertain myself whenever I was bored or frustrated.

15
0:00:58.174,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

16
0:01:00.173,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Settle down.

17
0:01:01.54,000 --> 0:01:02,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:03.929,000 --> 0:01:05,000
People say we live in an age of information overload. Right?

19
0:01:06.841,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I don't know about that,

20
0:01:08.029,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but I just know that I get too many marketing emails.

21
0:01:10.616,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I got a marketing email from a supermarket firm,

22
0:01:13.089,000 --> 0:01:14,000
which will remain nameless

23
0:01:14.922,000 --> 0:01:15,000
for predominantly legal reasons,

24
0:01:16.892,000 --> 0:01:18,000
but which I'm going to call "SafeMart."

25
0:01:19.397,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:21.479,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I got an email from them, and it went like this, it said:

27
0:01:24.701,000 --> 0:01:28,000
"Just three weeks until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"

28
0:01:28.966,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And I resented this,

29
0:01:30.402,000 --> 0:01:34,000
because not only do I not remember signing up to that,

30
0:01:34.597,000 --> 0:01:36,000
but I resent the fact that they appear to think

31
0:01:37.333,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that I should be excited about a shop opening.

32
0:01:41.259,000 --> 0:01:43,000
So what I did was I scrolled down to the bottom of the email,

33
0:01:44.268,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and I pressed, "Unsubscribe."

34
0:01:46.238,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And I thought that'd be the end of it.

35
0:01:48.095,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But a week later, I got another one that said,

36
0:01:50.275,000 --> 0:01:51,000
"Just two weeks

37
0:01:52.664,000 --> 0:01:53,000
until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"

38
0:01:54.603,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And I thought, obviously, I haven't clicked hard enough.

39
0:01:57.254,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So I tried it again. Right?

40
0:02:00.254,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Lo and behold, a week passes, you guessed it,

41
0:02:02.763,000 --> 0:02:06,000
"Just one week until SafeMart at King's Cross opens!!!"

42
0:02:06.844,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And here's the problem:

43
0:02:08.71,000 --> 0:02:1,000
The internet gave us access to everything;

44
0:02:11.889,000 --> 0:02:13,000
but it also gave everything access to us.

45
0:02:15.177,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It's hard enough to discriminate

46
0:02:16.774,000 --> 0:02:18,000
between the things that genuinely matter in this world

47
0:02:19.353,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and the minutiae of life,

48
0:02:20.901,000 --> 0:02:22,000
without having emails about supermarket chains

49
0:02:23.6,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and Candy Crush Saga.

50
0:02:26.696,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And I was really annoyed with them,

51
0:02:28.427,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and I thought, OK, I was about to write a strongly worded email,

52
0:02:31.629,000 --> 0:02:32,000
which I can do quite well.

53
0:02:32.914,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

54
0:02:35.144,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And I thought, no --

55
0:02:37.252,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I'm going to find the game.

56
0:02:38.972,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So I replied to it, and I said,

57
0:02:41.105,000 --> 0:02:42,000
"I literally cannot wait!!!!"

58
0:02:43.535,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

59
0:02:47.173,000 --> 0:02:48,000
"What do you need from me?"

60
0:02:51.201,000 --> 0:02:53,000
They got back to me; a guy called Dan said,

61
0:02:53.235,000 --> 0:02:55,000
"Hi James. I've asked a colleague to help me with your query."

62
0:02:56.173,000 --> 0:02:57,000
(Laughter)

63
0:02:57.217,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Like it needs help.

64
0:03:00.364,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And I said, "What's the plan, Dan?

65
0:03:02.143,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I'm thinking fireworks, bouncy castle ..."

66
0:03:04.46,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:08.276,000 --> 0:03:09,000
"I'm not sure what you mean."

68
0:03:09.775,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:11.512,000 --> 0:03:13,000
I said, "I'm just tremendously excited about the opening!"

70
0:03:14.333,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:17.362,000 --> 0:03:2,000
"Do you want to book the bouncy castle or shall I?"

72
0:03:23.687,000 --> 0:03:25,000
He said, "I think you have misunderstood."

73
0:03:25.863,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

74
0:03:27.402,000 --> 0:03:29,000
"A new store is opening, but there is no celebration planned."

75
0:03:31.599,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I said, "But what was all the 'Three weeks until,' 'Two weeks until' emails?

76
0:03:35.603,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I was getting excited."

77
0:03:37.766,000 --> 0:03:38,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:40.296,000 --> 0:03:41,000
"I'm sorry you're disappointed."

79
0:03:41.874,000 --> 0:03:43,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:45.694,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I said, "Not to worry.

81
0:03:48.216,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Let's do something anyway!

82
0:03:51.381,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Besides, the deposit on the bouncy castle was non-refundable."

83
0:03:54.393,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Laughter)

84
0:03:58.812,000 --> 0:04:,000
"If we don't use it, we're out a few hundred quid, Dan."

85
0:04:01.656,000 --> 0:04:02,000
(Laughter)

86
0:04:04.718,000 --> 0:04:07,000
He said, "Mr. Veitch, I'm not responsible for anything you have ordered."

87
0:04:09.454,000 --> 0:04:12,000
I said, "Let's not get into who did what.

88
0:04:14.182,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Bottom line: you and I are in this together."

89
0:04:16.835,000 --> 0:04:18,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:19.103,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Applause)

91
0:04:23.452,000 --> 0:04:26,000
"Question: Will you be there to make sure people take their shoes off?"

92
0:04:26.854,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

93
0:04:31.429,000 --> 0:04:34,000
I'll be honest, then my relationship with Dan deteriorated somewhat,

94
0:04:34.899,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because the next email I got was this:

95
0:04:37.248,000 --> 0:04:39,000
"Thanks for your email - your Case Number is ..."

96
0:04:39.654,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:41.981,000 --> 0:04:42,000
That's outrageous.

98
0:04:43.156,000 --> 0:04:44,000
I said, "Dan?"

99
0:04:44.331,000 --> 0:04:45,000
(Laughter)

100
0:04:46.195,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And I got -- and I was just like, this is ... -- and I, I ....

101
0:04:49.141,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And I said, "Danny?"

102
0:04:51.407,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And I thought, this is terrible. All I'm doing is collecting case numbers.

103
0:04:56.047,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I said, "D-Dog?"

104
0:04:57.618,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Laughter)

105
0:05:00.03,000 --> 0:05:01,000
"The store is now open."

106
0:05:01.35,000 --> 0:05:03,000
(Laughter)

107
0:05:05.104,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I said, "But Dan, they must have wondered why there was no bouncy castle."

108
0:05:10.587,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And then we were back to this.

109
0:05:15.123,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And that might have been the end of the story,

110
0:05:17.754,000 --> 0:05:21,000
but I remembered that anything -- everything --

111
0:05:21.83,000 --> 0:05:24,000
even something as mundane as getting out of a car,

112
0:05:25.426,000 --> 0:05:26,000
can be fun if you find the right game.

113
0:05:29.474,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So,

114
0:05:31.944,000 --> 0:05:32,000
this is what I replied:

115
0:05:34.063,000 --> 0:05:36,000
[Thanks for your email - your Case Number is #0000001.]

116
0:05:36.694,000 --> 0:05:38,000
(Laughter)

117
0:05:39.004,000 --> 0:05:42,000
(Applause)

118
0:05:44.843,000 --> 0:05:45,000
And we just, uh ...

119
0:05:46.262,000 --> 0:05:48,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:48.287,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It was like we were dancing.

121
0:05:50.464,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It was just a beautiful relationship.

122
0:05:52.731,000 --> 0:05:54,000
We just kept going.

123
0:05:55.15,000 --> 0:05:56,000
It was lovely.

124
0:05:56.616,000 --> 0:05:58,000
But to be honest, guys, it was quite labor-intensive,

125
0:05:59.525,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and I had other stuff to do,

126
0:06:02.594,000 --> 0:06:03,000
believe it or not.

127
0:06:05.262,000 --> 0:06:1,000
So what I did is I have a little email auto-replier program.

128
0:06:12.358,000 --> 0:06:15,000
And I set it up so every time it receives an email from SafeMart,

129
0:06:15.517,000 --> 0:06:16,000
it just pings one back.

130
0:06:16.691,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So I set it up, and it says,

131
0:06:18.066,000 --> 0:06:2,000
"Thanks for your email - your Case Number is ..."

132
0:06:20.451,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Then it has a little formula that I wrote to up the case number every time.

133
0:06:24.329,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And I put it on the server

134
0:06:26.455,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and set it running.

135
0:06:29.681,000 --> 0:06:32,000
(Laughter)

136
0:06:34.889,000 --> 0:06:35,000
I'll be honest, guys --

137
0:06:36.099,000 --> 0:06:37,000
then I forgot about it.

138
0:06:37.519,000 --> 0:06:39,000
(Laughter)

139
0:06:40.453,000 --> 0:06:42,000
I checked back on it the other day,

140
0:06:42.616,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and it appears there have been a number of emails going back and forth.

141
0:06:49.661,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We're on 21,439.

142
0:06:52.67,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Applause)

143
0:06:59.252,000 --> 0:07:02,000
It gives me an immense sense of satisfaction to know

144
0:07:02.328,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that these computer programs are just going to be pinging one another

145
0:07:06.273,000 --> 0:07:07,000
for eternity.

146
0:07:08.926,000 --> 0:07:1,000
And as legacies go, I don't think that's bad.

147
0:07:13.573,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So guys, just remember:

148
0:07:15.407,000 --> 0:07:18,000
if ever you feel weighed down by the bureaucracy

149
0:07:18.884,000 --> 0:07:2,000
and often mundanity of modern life,

150
0:07:22.073,000 --> 0:07:23,000
don't fight the frustration.

151
0:07:26.263,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Let it be the catalyst

152
0:07:28.725,000 --> 0:07:29,000
for whimsy.

153
0:07:31.739,000 --> 0:07:33,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:34.278,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Thank you.

155
0:07:35.461,000 --> 0:07:38,000
(Applause)

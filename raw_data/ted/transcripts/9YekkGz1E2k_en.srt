0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
This story

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
is about taking imagination seriously.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Fourteen years ago,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I first encountered this ordinary material, fishnet,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
used the same way for centuries.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Today, I'm using it to create

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
permanent, billowing, voluptuous forms

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
the scale of hard-edged buildings

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
in cities around the world.

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I was an unlikely person to be doing this.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I never studied sculpture,

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
engineering or architecture.

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In fact, after college

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I applied to seven art schools

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and was rejected by all seven.

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I went off on my own to become an artist,

17
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and I painted for 10 years,

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
when I was offered a Fulbright to India.

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Promising to give exhibitions of paintings,

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I shipped my paints and arrived in Mahabalipuram.

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
The deadline for the show arrived --

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
my paints didn't.

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I had to do something.

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This fishing village was famous for sculpture.

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So I tried bronze casting.

26
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
But to make large forms was too heavy and expensive.

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I went for a walk on the beach,

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
watching the fishermen

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
bundle their nets into mounds on the sand.

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I'd seen it every day,

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but this time I saw it differently --

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
a new approach to sculpture,

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
a way to make volumetric form

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
without heavy solid materials.

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
My first satisfying sculpture

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
was made in collaboration with these fishermen.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It's a self-portrait

38
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
titled "Wide Hips."

39
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
We hoisted them on poles to photograph.

41
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I discovered

42
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
their soft surfaces

43
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
revealed every ripple of wind

44
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
in constantly changing patterns.

45
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I was mesmerized.

46
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I continued studying craft traditions

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and collaborating with artisans,

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
next in Lithuania with lace makers.

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I liked the fine detail

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
it gave my work,

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
but I wanted to make them larger --

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
to shift from being an object you look at

53
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to something you could get lost in.

54
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Returning to India to work with those fishermen,

55
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
we made a net

56
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
of a million and a half hand-tied knots --

57
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
installed briefly in Madrid.

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Thousands of people saw it,

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and one of them was the urbanist

60
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Manual Sola-Morales

61
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
who was redesigning the waterfront

62
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
in Porto, Portugal.

63
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
He asked if I could build this

64
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
as a permanent piece for the city.

65
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
I didn't know if I could do that

66
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and preserve my art.

67
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
Durable, engineered, permanent --

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
those are in opposition

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
to idiosyncratic, delicate and ephemeral.

70
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
For two years, I searched for a fiber

71
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that could survive ultraviolet rays,

72
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
salt, air, pollution,

73
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and at the same time remain soft enough

74
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to move fluidly in the wind.

75
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
We needed something to hold the net up

76
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
out there in the middle of the traffic circle.

77
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So we raised this 45,000-pound steel ring.

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
We had to engineer it

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to move gracefully in an average breeze

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and survive in hurricane winds.

81
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
But there was no engineering software

82
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
to model something porous and moving.

83
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I found a brilliant aeronautical engineer

84
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
who designs sails for America's Cup racing yachts

85
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
named Peter Heppel.

86
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
He helped me tackle the twin challenges

87
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
of precise shape

88
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and gentle movement.

89
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
I couldn't build this the way I knew

90
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
because hand-tied knots

91
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
weren't going to withstand a hurricane.

92
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
So I developed a relationship

93
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
with an industrial fishnet factory,

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
learned the variables of their machines,

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and figured out a way

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to make lace with them.

97
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
There was no language

98
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
to translate this ancient, idiosyncratic handcraft

99
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
into something machine operators could produce.

100
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
So we had to create one.

101
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Three years and two children later,

102
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we raised this 50,000-square-foot lace net.

103
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It was hard to believe

104
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
that what I had imagined

105
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
was now built, permanent

106
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and had lost nothing in translation.

107
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
(Applause)

108
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
This intersection had been bland and anonymous.

109
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Now it had a sense of place.

110
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I walked underneath it

111
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
for the first time.

112
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
As I watched the wind's choreography unfold,

113
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I felt sheltered

114
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and, at the same time,

115
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
connected to limitless sky.

116
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
My life was not going to be the same.

117
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:22,000
I want to create these oases of sculpture

118
0:05:22.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in spaces of cities around the world.

119
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
I'm going to share two directions

120
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
that are new in my work.

121
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Historic Philadelphia City Hall:

122
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
its plaza, I felt, needed a material for sculpture

123
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
that was lighter than netting.

124
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
So we experimented

125
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
with tiny atomized water particles

126
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to create a dry mist

127
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
that is shaped by the wind

128
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and in testing, discovered

129
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
that it can be shaped by people

130
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
who can interact and move through it without getting wet.

131
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
I'm using this sculpture material

132
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
to trace the paths of subway trains above ground

133
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
in real time --

134
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
like an X-ray of the city's circulatory system unfolding.

135
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Next challenge,

136
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
the Biennial of the Americas in Denver

137
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
asked, could I represent

138
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
the 35 nations of the Western hemisphere and their interconnectedness

139
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
in a sculpture?

140
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Laughter)

141
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I didn't know where to begin,

142
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
but I said yes.

143
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
I read about the recent earthquake in Chile

144
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and the tsunami that rippled across

145
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the entire Pacific Ocean.

146
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
It shifted the Earth's tectonic plates,

147
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
sped up the planet's rotation

148
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and literally shortened the length of the day.

149
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So I contacted NOAA,

150
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and I asked if they'd share their data on the tsunami,

151
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and translated it into this.

152
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Its title: "1.26"

153
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:,000
refers to the number of microseconds

154
0:07:00.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
that the Earth's day was shortened.

155
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I couldn't build this with a steel ring, the way I knew.

156
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Its shape was too complex now.

157
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
So I replaced the metal armature

158
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
with a soft, fine mesh

159
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
of a fiber 15 times stronger than steel.

160
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The sculpture could now be entirely soft,

161
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
which made it so light

162
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
it could tie in to existing buildings --

163
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
literally becoming part of the fabric of the city.

164
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
There was no software

165
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
that could extrude these complex net forms

166
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and model them with gravity.

167
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So we had to create it.

168
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Then I got a call from New York City

169
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
asking if I could adapt these concepts

170
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
to Times Square

171
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
or the High Line.

172
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
This new soft structural method

173
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
enables me to model these

174
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and build these sculptures

175
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
at the scale of skyscrapers.

176
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
They don't have funding yet,

177
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but I dream now

178
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
of bringing these to cities around the world

179
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
where they're most needed.

180
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Fourteen years ago,

181
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I searched for beauty

182
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
in the traditional things,

183
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
in craft forms.

184
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
Now I combine them with hi-tech materials and engineering

185
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
to create voluptuous, billowing forms

186
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
the scale of buildings.

187
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
My artistic horizons continue to grow.

188
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I'll leave you with this story.

189
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
I got a call from a friend in Phoenix.

190
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
An attorney in the office

191
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
who'd never been interested in art,

192
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
never visited the local art museum,

193
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
dragged everyone she could from the building

194
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
and got them outside to lie down underneath the sculpture.

195
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
There they were in their business suits,

196
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
laying in the grass,

197
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
noticing the changing patterns of wind

198
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
beside people they didn't know,

199
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
sharing the rediscovery of wonder.

200
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Thank you.

201
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
(Applause)

202
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Thank you. Thank you.

203
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Thank you.

204
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Thank you. Thank you.

205
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Applause)

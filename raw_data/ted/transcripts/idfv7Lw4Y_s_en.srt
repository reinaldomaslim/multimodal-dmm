1
0:00:13.123,000 --> 0:00:17,000
The Earth is 4.6 billion years old,

2
0:00:17.896,000 --> 0:00:21,000
but a human lifetime often lasts for less than 100 years.

3
0:00:23.191,000 --> 0:00:26,000
So why care about the history of our planet

4
0:00:26.532,000 --> 0:00:31,000
when the distant past seems so inconsequential to everyday life?

5
0:00:32.849,000 --> 0:00:34,000
You see, as far as we can tell,

6
0:00:34.991,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Earth is the only planet in our solar system

7
0:00:38.25,000 --> 0:00:4,000
known to have sparked life,

8
0:00:40.783,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and the only system able to provide life support for human beings.

9
0:00:46.763,000 --> 0:00:47,000
So why Earth?

10
0:00:48.731,000 --> 0:00:51,000
We know Earth is unique for having plate tectonics,

11
0:00:52.133,000 --> 0:00:53,000
liquid water on its surface

12
0:00:53.71,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and an oxygen-rich atmosphere.

13
0:00:56.457,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But this has not always been the case,

14
0:00:58.799,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and we know this because ancient rocks have recorded the pivotal moments

15
0:01:03.664,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in Earth's planetary evolution.

16
0:01:07.653,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And one of the best places to observe those ancient rocks

17
0:01:10.66,000 --> 0:01:13,000
is in the Pilbara of Western Australia.

18
0:01:15.494,000 --> 0:01:19,000
The rocks here are 3.5 billion years old,

19
0:01:20.018,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and they contain some of the oldest evidence for life on the planet.

20
0:01:25.298,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Now, often when we think of early life,

21
0:01:27.737,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we might imagine a stegosaurus

22
0:01:30.979,000 --> 0:01:33,000
or maybe a fish crawling onto land.

23
0:01:35.012,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But the early life that I'm talking about

24
0:01:37.264,000 --> 0:01:4,000
is simple microscopic life, like bacteria.

25
0:01:41.745,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And their fossils are often preserved as layered rock structures,

26
0:01:45.754,000 --> 0:01:47,000
called stromatolites.

27
0:01:48.515,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This simple form of life is almost all we see in the fossil record

28
0:01:53.506,000 --> 0:01:57,000
for the first three billion years of life on Earth.

29
0:01:58.256,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Our species can only be traced back in the fossil record

30
0:02:01.735,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to a few hundred thousand years ago.

31
0:02:04.267,000 --> 0:02:05,000
We know from the fossil record,

32
0:02:06.256,000 --> 0:02:1,000
bacteria life had grabbed a strong foothold

33
0:02:10.33,000 --> 0:02:13,000
by about 3.5 to four billion years ago.

34
0:02:14.316,000 --> 0:02:17,000
The rocks older than this have been either destroyed

35
0:02:17.979,000 --> 0:02:2,000
or highly deformed through plate tectonics.

36
0:02:21.55,000 --> 0:02:23,000
So what remains a missing piece of the puzzle

37
0:02:24.011,000 --> 0:02:28,000
is exactly when and how life on Earth began.

38
0:02:31.086,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Here again is that ancient volcanic landscape in the Pilbara.

39
0:02:35.075,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Little did I know that our research here would provide another clue

40
0:02:39.926,000 --> 0:02:41,000
to that origin-of-life puzzle.

41
0:02:42.871,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It was on my first field trip here,

42
0:02:45.005,000 --> 0:02:49,000
toward the end of a full, long week mapping project,

43
0:02:49.174,000 --> 0:02:51,000
that I came across something rather special.

44
0:02:53.026,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Now, what probably looks like a bunch of wrinkly old rocks

45
0:02:56.657,000 --> 0:02:58,000
are actually stromatolites.

46
0:02:58.694,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And at the center of this mound was a small, peculiar rock

47
0:03:02.845,000 --> 0:03:04,000
about the size of a child's hand.

48
0:03:06.144,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It took six months before we inspected this rock under a microscope,

49
0:03:11.066,000 --> 0:03:13,000
when one of my mentors at the time, Malcolm Walter,

50
0:03:13.706,000 --> 0:03:16,000
suggested the rock resembled geyserite.

51
0:03:18.034,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Geyserite is a rock type that only forms

52
0:03:21.566,000 --> 0:03:25,000
in and around the edges of hot spring pools.

53
0:03:26.165,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Now, in order for you to understand the significance of geyserite,

54
0:03:29.671,000 --> 0:03:33,000
I need to take you back a couple of centuries.

55
0:03:35.464,000 --> 0:03:39,000
In 1871, in a letter to his friend Joseph Hooker,

56
0:03:39.54,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Charles Darwin suggested:

57
0:03:42.183,000 --> 0:03:45,000
"What if life started in some warm little pond

58
0:03:45.928,000 --> 0:03:47,000
with all sort of chemicals

59
0:03:48.071,000 --> 0:03:52,000
still ready to undergo more complex changes?"

60
0:03:52.883,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Well, we know of warm little ponds. We call them "hot springs."

61
0:03:55.99,000 --> 0:03:57,000
In these environments, you have hot water

62
0:03:58.344,000 --> 0:04:01,000
dissolving minerals from the underlying rocks.

63
0:04:02.295,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This solution mixes with organic compounds

64
0:04:07.378,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and results in a kind of chemical factory,

65
0:04:10.033,000 --> 0:04:15,000
which researchers have shown can manufacture simple cellular structures

66
0:04:16.047,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that are the first steps toward life.

67
0:04:19.363,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But 100 years after Darwin's letter,

68
0:04:21.645,000 --> 0:04:25,000
deep-sea hydrothermal vents, or hot vents, were discovered in the ocean.

69
0:04:25.844,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And these are also chemical factories.

70
0:04:28.177,000 --> 0:04:31,000
This one is located along the Tonga volcanic arc,

71
0:04:31.751,000 --> 0:04:35,000
1,100 meters below sea level in the Pacific Ocean.

72
0:04:37.56,000 --> 0:04:4,000
The black smoke that you see billowing out of these chimneylike structures

73
0:04:41.282,000 --> 0:04:42,000
is also mineral-rich fluid,

74
0:04:43.123,000 --> 0:04:45,000
which is being fed off by bacteria.

75
0:04:46.967,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And since the discovery of these deep-sea vents,

76
0:04:49.259,000 --> 0:04:53,000
the favored scenario for an origin of life has been in the ocean.

77
0:04:54.091,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And this is for good reason:

78
0:04:57.118,000 --> 0:05:,000
deep-sea vents are well-known in the ancient rock record,

79
0:05:00.451,000 --> 0:05:03,000
and it's thought that the early Earth had a global ocean

80
0:05:03.54,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and very little land surface.

81
0:05:06.316,000 --> 0:05:1,000
So the probability that deep-sea vents were abundant on the very early Earth

82
0:05:11.045,000 --> 0:05:13,000
fits well with an origin of life

83
0:05:13.548,000 --> 0:05:14,000
in the ocean.

84
0:05:16.233,000 --> 0:05:17,000
However ...

85
0:05:18.503,000 --> 0:05:22,000
our research in the Pilbara provides and supports

86
0:05:22.681,000 --> 0:05:24,000
an alternative perspective.

87
0:05:25.59,000 --> 0:05:3,000
After three years, finally, we were able to show that, in fact,

88
0:05:31.513,000 --> 0:05:34,000
our little rock was geyserite.

89
0:05:34.915,000 --> 0:05:38,000
So this conclusion suggested not only did hot springs exist

90
0:05:39.008,000 --> 0:05:43,000
in our 3.5 billion-year-old volcano in the Pilbara,

91
0:05:43.088,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but it pushed back evidence for life living on land in hot springs

92
0:05:49.47,000 --> 0:05:51,000
in the geological record of Earth

93
0:05:51.733,000 --> 0:05:54,000
by three billion years.

94
0:05:56.818,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And so, from a geological perspective,

95
0:06:00.266,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Darwin's warm little pond is a reasonable origin-of-life candidate.

96
0:06:09.174,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Of course, it's still debatable how life began on Earth,

97
0:06:12.765,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and it probably always will be.

98
0:06:15.247,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But it is clear that it's flourished;

99
0:06:17.827,000 --> 0:06:18,000
it has diversified,

100
0:06:19.211,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and it has become ever more complex.

101
0:06:21.761,000 --> 0:06:24,000
Eventually, it reached the age of the human,

102
0:06:25.107,000 --> 0:06:28,000
a species that has begun to question its own existence

103
0:06:28.757,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and the existence of life elsewhere:

104
0:06:32.595,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Is there a cosmic community waiting to connect with us,

105
0:06:35.756,000 --> 0:06:37,000
or are we all there is?

106
0:06:38.876,000 --> 0:06:42,000
A clue to this puzzle again comes from the ancient rock record.

107
0:06:44.316,000 --> 0:06:46,000
At about 2.5 billion years ago,

108
0:06:46.6,000 --> 0:06:5,000
there is evidence that bacteria had begun to produce oxygen,

109
0:06:51.471,000 --> 0:06:53,000
kind of like plants do today.

110
0:06:53.764,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Geologists refer to the period that followed

111
0:06:56.259,000 --> 0:06:58,000
as the Great Oxidation Event.

112
0:06:59.436,000 --> 0:07:03,000
It is implied from rocks called banded iron formations,

113
0:07:04.118,000 --> 0:07:09,000
many of which can be observed as hundreds-of-meter-thick packages of rock

114
0:07:09.282,000 --> 0:07:11,000
which are exposed in gorges

115
0:07:11.467,000 --> 0:07:14,000
that carve their way through the Karijini National Park

116
0:07:14.861,000 --> 0:07:15,000
in Western Australia.

117
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The arrival of free oxygen allowed two major changes to occur on our planet.

118
0:07:21.551,000 --> 0:07:24,000
First, it allowed complex life to evolve.

119
0:07:25.065,000 --> 0:07:28,000
You see, life needs oxygen to get big and complex.

120
0:07:29.73,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And it produced the ozone layer, which protects modern life

121
0:07:32.768,000 --> 0:07:35,000
from the harmful effects of the sun's UVB radiation.

122
0:07:36.837,000 --> 0:07:4,000
So in an ironic twist, microbial life made way for complex life,

123
0:07:41.822,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and in essence, relinquished its three-billion-year reign

124
0:07:45.479,000 --> 0:07:46,000
over the planet.

125
0:07:47.161,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Today, we humans dig up fossilized complex life

126
0:07:50.779,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and burn it for fuel.

127
0:07:53.154,000 --> 0:07:57,000
This practice pumps vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere,

128
0:07:57.567,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and like our microbial predecessors,

129
0:08:00.042,000 --> 0:08:03,000
we have begun to make substantial changes to our planet.

130
0:08:04.889,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And the effects of those are encompassed by global warming.

131
0:08:10.793,000 --> 0:08:15,000
Unfortunately, the ironic twist here could see the demise of humanity.

132
0:08:16.42,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And so maybe the reason we aren't connecting with life elsewhere,

133
0:08:20.403,000 --> 0:08:22,000
intelligent life elsewhere,

134
0:08:22.46,000 --> 0:08:24,000
is that once it evolves,

135
0:08:24.567,000 --> 0:08:26,000
it extinguishes itself quickly.

136
0:08:28.153,000 --> 0:08:29,000
If the rocks could talk,

137
0:08:30.078,000 --> 0:08:33,000
I suspect they might say this:

138
0:08:34.345,000 --> 0:08:36,000
life on Earth is precious.

139
0:08:38.697,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It is the product of four or so billion years

140
0:08:43.108,000 --> 0:08:47,000
of a delicate and complex co-evolution

141
0:08:47.836,000 --> 0:08:49,000
between life and Earth,

142
0:08:50.373,000 --> 0:08:55,000
of which humans only represent the very last speck of time.

143
0:08:57.473,000 --> 0:09:01,000
You can use this information as a guide or a forecast --

144
0:09:01.765,000 --> 0:09:06,000
or an explanation as to why it seems so lonely in this part of the galaxy.

145
0:09:08.629,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But use it to gain some perspective

146
0:09:13.166,000 --> 0:09:17,000
about the legacy that you want to leave behind

147
0:09:17.942,000 --> 0:09:21,000
on the planet that you call home.

148
0:09:24.083,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Thank you.

149
0:09:25.356,000 --> 0:09:28,000
(Applause)

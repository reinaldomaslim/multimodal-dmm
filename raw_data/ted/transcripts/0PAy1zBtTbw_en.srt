1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris,

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and the phone rang and I heard,

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
"Hey, JR,

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
you won the TED Prize 2011.

5
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
You have to make a wish to save the world."

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I was lost.

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I mean, I can't save the world. Nobody can.

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
The world is fucked up.

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Come on, you have dictators ruling the world,

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
population is growing by millions,

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
there's no more fish in the sea,

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
the North Pole is melting

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and as the last TED Prize winner said,

14
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
we're all becoming fat.

15
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
(Laughter)

16
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Except maybe French people.

17
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Whatever.

18
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
So I called back

19
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and I told her,

20
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
"Look, Amy,

21
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
tell the TED guys I just won't show up.

22
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I can't do anything to save the world."

23
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
She said, "Hey, JR,

24
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
your wish is not to save the world, but to change the world."

25
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"Oh, all right."

26
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
"That's cool."

28
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
I mean, technology, politics, business

29
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
do change the world --

30
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
not always in a good way, but they do.

31
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
What about art?

32
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Could art change the world?

33
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I started when I was 15 years old.

34
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
And at that time, I was not thinking about changing the world.

35
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
I was doing graffiti --

36
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
writing my name everywhere,

37
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
using the city as a canvas.

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I was going in the tunnels of Paris,

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
on the rooftops with my friends.

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
Each trip was an excursion,

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
was an adventure.

42
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It was like leaving our mark on society,

43
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
to say, "I was here," on the top of a building.

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
So when I found a cheap camera on the subway,

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
I started documenting those adventures with my friends

46
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and gave them back as photocopies --

47
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
really small photos just that size.

48
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
That's how, at 17 years old,

49
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I started pasting them.

50
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And I did my first "expo de rue,"

51
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
which means sidewalk gallery.

52
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And I framed it with color

53
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
so you would not confuse it with advertising.

54
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I mean, the city's the best gallery I could imagine.

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery

56
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and let them decide

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
if my work was nice enough to show it to people.

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I would control it directly with the public

59
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
in the streets.

60
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So that's Paris.

61
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I would change --

62
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
depending on the places I would go --

63
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the title of the exhibition.

64
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
That's on the Champs-Elysees.

65
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I was quite proud of that one.

66
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Because I was just 18

67
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees.

68
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Then when the photo left,

69
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the frame was still there.

70
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
(Laughter)

71
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
November 2005:

72
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the streets are burning.

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
A large wave of riots

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
had broken into the first projects of Paris.

75
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Everyone was glued to the TV,

76
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
watching disturbing, frightening images

77
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
taken from the edge of the neighborhood.

78
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
I mean, these kids, without control,

79
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:31,000
throwing Molotov cocktails,

80
0:03:31.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
attacking the cops and the firemen,

81
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
looting everything they could in the shops.

82
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
These were criminals, thugs, dangerous,

83
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
destroying their own environment.

84
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And then I saw it -- could it be possible? --

85
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
my photo on a wall

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
revealed by a burning car --

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
a pasting I'd done a year earlier --

88
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
an illegal one -- still there.

89
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
I mean, these were the faces of my friends.

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I know those guys.

91
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
All of them are not angels,

92
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but they're not monsters either.

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So it was kind of weird to see

94
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television.

95
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So I went back there

96
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
with a 28 mm lens.

97
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It was the only one I had at that time.

98
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But with that lens,

99
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person.

100
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So you can do it only with their trust.

101
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet.

102
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
They were making scary faces

103
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to play the caricature of themselves.

104
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And then I pasted huge posters everywhere

105
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in the bourgeois area of Paris

106
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
with the name, age, even building number

107
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
of these guys.

108
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
A year later,

109
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris.

110
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And we go from thug images,

111
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
who've been stolen and distorted by the media,

112
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
who's now proudly taking over his own image.

113
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
That's where I realized

114
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
the power of paper and glue.

115
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
So could art change the world?

116
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
A year later,

117
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
I was listening to all the noise

118
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
about the Middle East conflict.

119
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I mean, at that time, trust me,

120
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict.

121
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So with my friend Marco,

122
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
we decided to go there

123
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis.

124
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Are they so different?

125
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
When we got there, we just went in the street,

126
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
started talking with people everywhere,

127
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and we realized that things were a bit different

128
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
from the rhetoric we heard in the media.

129
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So we decided to take portraits

130
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
of Palestinians and Israelis

131
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
doing the same jobs --

132
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
taxi-driver, lawyer, cooks.

133
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment.

134
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
Not a smile -- that really doesn't tell

135
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
about who you are and what you feel.

136
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
They all accepted

137
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
to be pasted next to the other.

138
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
I decided to paste

139
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities

140
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and on both sides of the wall.

141
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever.

142
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We called the project Face 2 Face.

143
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
The experts said, "No way.

144
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
The people will not accept.

145
0:06:46.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
The army will shoot you, and Hamas will kidnap you."

146
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
We said, "Okay, let's try and push as far as we can."

147
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I love the way that people will ask me,

148
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
"How big will my photo be?"

149
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
"It will be as big as your house."

150
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
When we did the wall, we did the Palestinian side.

151
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
So we arrived with just our ladders

152
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and we realized that they were not high enough.

153
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And so Palestinians guys say,

154
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
"Calm down. No wait. I'm going to find you a solution."

155
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
So he went to the Church of Nativity

156
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
and brought back an old ladder

157
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born.

158
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We did Face 2 Face with only six friends,

160
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:27,000
two ladders, two brushes,

161
0:07:27.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
a rented car, a camera

162
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and 20,000 square feet of paper.

163
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We had all sorts of help

164
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
from all walks of life.

165
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Okay, for example, that's Palestine.

166
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
We're in Ramallah right now.

167
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We're pasting portraits --

168
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market.

169
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
People come around us and start asking,

170
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
"What are you doing here?"

171
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
"Oh, we're actually doing an art project

172
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job.

173
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers."

174
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
And then there was always a silence.

175
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
"You mean you're pasting an Israeli face --

176
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
doing a face -- right here?"

177
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
"Well, yeah, yeah, that's part of the project."

178
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And I would always leave that moment,

179
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and we would ask them,

180
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
"So can you tell me who is who?"

181
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And most of them couldn't say.

182
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:26,000
(Applause)

183
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
We even pasted on Israeli military towers,

184
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and nothing happened.

185
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
When you paste an image, it's just paper and glue.

186
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
People can tear it, tag on it, or even pee on it --

187
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
some are a bit high for that, I agree --

188
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
but the people in the street,

189
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
they are the curator.

190
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway.

191
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
They are not meant to stay.

192
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
But exactly four years after,

193
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
the photos, most of them are still there.

194
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Face 2 Face demonstrated

195
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
that what we thought impossible was possible --

196
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
and, you know what, even easy.

197
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We didn't push the limit;

198
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
we just showed that they were further than anyone thought.

199
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
In the Middle East, I experienced my work

200
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
in places without [many] museums.

201
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So the reactions in the street

202
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
were kind of interesting.

203
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
So I decided to go further in this direction

204
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
and go in places where there were zero museums.

205
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
When you go in these developing societies,

206
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
women are the pillars of their community,

207
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but the men are still the ones holding the streets.

208
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
So we were inspired to create a project

209
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
where men will pay tribute to women

210
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
by posting their photos.

211
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I called that project Women Are Heroes.

212
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
When I listened to all the stories

213
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
everywhere I went on the continents,

214
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I couldn't always understand

215
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
the complicated circumstances of their conflict.

216
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
I just observed.

217
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
Sometimes there was no words,

218
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
no sentence, just tears.

219
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I just took their pictures

220
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and pasted them.

221
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Women Are Heroes took me around the world.

222
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Most of the places I went to,

223
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
I decided to go there

224
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
because I've heard about it through the media.

225
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
So for example, in June 2008,

226
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
I was watching TV in Paris,

227
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
and then I heard about this terrible thing

228
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
that happened in Rio de Janeiro --

229
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
the first favela of Brazil named Providencia.

230
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Three kids -- that was three students --

231
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
were [detained] by the army

232
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because they were not carrying their papers.

233
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And the army took them,

234
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
and instead of bringing them to the police station,

235
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
they brought them to an enemy favela

236
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
where they get chopped into pieces.

237
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
I was shocked.

238
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
All Brazil was shocked.

239
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
I heard it was one of the most violent favelas,

240
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
because the largest drug cartel controls it.

241
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
So I decided to go there.

242
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
When I arrived --

243
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I mean, I didn't have any contact with any NGO.

244
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
There was none in place -- no association, no NGOs, nothing --

245
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
no eyewitnesses.

246
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
So we just walked around,

247
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and we met a woman,

248
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and I showed her my book.

249
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And she said, "You know what?

250
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
We're hungry for culture.

251
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
We need culture out there."

252
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So I went out and I started with the kids.

253
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I just took a few photos of the kids,

254
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them.

255
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
The day after, I came back and they were already scratched.

256
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
But that's okay.

257
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them.

258
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Then the next day, I held a meeting on the main square

259
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and some women came.

260
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed.

261
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
There was the mother, the grandmother, the best friend --

262
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
they all wanted to shout the story.

263
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
After that day,

264
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
everyone in the favela gave me the green light.

265
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
I took more photos, and we started the project.

266
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The drug lords were kind of worried

267
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
about us filming in the place,

268
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
so I told them, "You know what?

269
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I'm not interested in filming the violence and the weapons.

270
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
You see that enough in the media.

271
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy.

272
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
I've been seeing it around me the last few days."

273
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
So that's a really symbolic pasting,

274
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
because that's the first one we did that you couldn't see from the city.

275
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
And that's where the three kids got arrested,

276
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and that's the grandmother of one of them.

277
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And on that stairs,

278
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that's where the traffickers always stand

279
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
and there's a lot of exchange of fire.

280
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Everyone there understood the project.

281
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill.

282
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
(Applause)

283
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
What was interesting is that the media couldn't get in.

284
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
I mean, you should see that.

285
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter

286
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and then have a really long lens,

287
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
and we would see ourselves, on TV, pasting.

288
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And they would put a number: "Please call this number

289
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
if you know what's going on in Providencia."

290
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
We just did a project and then left

291
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
so the media wouldn't know.

292
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
So how can we know about the project?

293
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
So they had to go and find the women

294
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
and get an explanation from them.

295
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So you create a bridge between the media

296
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and the anonymous women.

297
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
We kept traveling.

298
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We went to Africa, Sudan, Sierra Leone,

299
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
Liberia, Kenya.

300
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
In war-torn places like Monrovia,

301
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
people come straight to you.

302
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I mean, they want to know what you're up to.

303
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
They kept asking me, "What is the purpose of your project?

304
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Are you an NGO? Are you the media?"

305
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
Art. Just doing art.

306
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Some people question, "Why is it in black and white?

307
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Don't you have color in France?"

308
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
(Laughter)

309
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Or they tell you, "Are these people all dead?"

310
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Some who understood the project would explain it to others.

311
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And to a man who did not understand, I heard someone say,

312
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
"You know, you've been here for a few hours

313
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
trying to understand, discussing with your fellows.

314
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:12,000
During that time, you haven't thought about

315
0:14:12.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
what you're going to eat tomorrow.

316
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
This is art."

317
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
I think it's people's curiosity

318
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
that motivates them

319
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
to come into the projects.

320
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
And then it becomes more.

321
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
It becomes a desire, a need, an armor.

322
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
On this bridge that's in Monrovia,

323
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait

324
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
of a woman that might have been raped during the war.

325
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Women are always the first ones targeted

326
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
during conflict.

327
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
This is Kibera, Kenya,

328
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
one of the largest slums of Africa.

329
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
You might have seen images about the post-election violence

330
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
that happened there in 2008.

331
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
This time we covered the roofs of the houses,

332
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
but we didn't use paper,

333
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
because paper doesn't prevent the rain

334
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
from leaking inside the house --

335
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
vinyl does.

336
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
Then art becomes useful.

337
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
So the people kept it.

338
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
You know what I love is, for example, when you see the biggest eye there,

339
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
there are so [many] houses inside.

340
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And I went there a few months ago --

341
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye.

342
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
So I asked the people what happened.

343
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
"Oh, that guy just moved."

344
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
(Laughter)

345
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
When the roofs were covered, a woman said as a joke,

346
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
"Now God can see me."

347
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
When you look at Kibera now,

348
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
they look back.

349
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Okay, India.

350
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Before I start that, just so you know,

351
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
each time we go to a place, we don't have authorization,

352
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
so we set up like commandos --

353
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
we're a group of friends who arrive there,

354
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and we try to paste on the walls.

355
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
But there are places where you just can't paste on a wall.

356
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
In India it was just impossible to paste.

357
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
I heard culturally and because of the law,

358
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:08,000
they would just arrest us at the first pasting.

359
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
So we decided to paste white,

360
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
white on the walls.

361
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So imagine white guys pasting white papers.

362
0:16:14.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
So people would come to us and ask us,

363
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
"Hey, what are you up to?"

364
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
"Oh, you know, we're just doing art." "Art?"

365
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
Of course, they were confused.

366
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets,

367
0:16:27.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and the more dust you would have

368
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
going up in the air,

369
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
on the white paper you can almost see,

370
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
but there is this sticky part

371
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
like when you reverse a sticker.

372
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
So the more dust you have, the more it will reveal the photo.

373
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
So we could just walk in the street during the next days

374
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
and the photos would get revealed by themselves.

375
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
(Applause)

376
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Thank you.

377
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
So we didn't get caught this time.

378
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
Each project -- that's a film

379
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
from Women Are Heroes.

380
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
(Music)

381
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Okay.

382
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
For each project we do

383
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
a film.

384
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
And most of what you see -- that's a trailer from "Women Are Heroes" --

385
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
its images, photography,

386
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:24,000
taken one after the other.

387
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
And the photos kept traveling even without us.

388
0:18:21.26,000 --> 0:18:23,000
(Laughter)

389
0:18:23.26,000 --> 0:18:33,000
(Applause)

390
0:18:33.26,000 --> 0:18:35,000
Hopefully, you'll see the film,

391
0:18:35.26,000 --> 0:18:37,000
and you'll understand the scope of the project

392
0:18:37.26,000 --> 0:18:39,000
and what the people felt when they saw those photos.

393
0:18:39.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Because that's a big part of it. There's layers behind each photo.

394
0:18:42.26,000 --> 0:18:45,000
Behind each image is a story.

395
0:18:45.26,000 --> 0:18:47,000
Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic

396
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
in each of the communities,

397
0:18:49.26,000 --> 0:18:52,000
and the women kept that dynamic after we left.

398
0:18:52.26,000 --> 0:18:55,000
For example, we did books -- not for sale --

399
0:18:55.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
that all the community would get.

400
0:18:57.26,000 --> 0:19:01,000
But to get it, they would have to [get] it signed by one of the women.

401
0:19:01.26,000 --> 0:19:03,000
We did that in most of the places.

402
0:19:03.26,000 --> 0:19:05,000
We go back regularly.

403
0:19:05.26,000 --> 0:19:08,000
And so in Providencia, for example, in the favela,

404
0:19:08.26,000 --> 0:19:1,000
we have a cultural center running there.

405
0:19:10.26,000 --> 0:19:12,000
In Kibera, each year we cover more roofs.

406
0:19:12.26,000 --> 0:19:15,000
Because of course, when we left, the people who were just at the edge of the project

407
0:19:15.26,000 --> 0:19:18,000
said, "Hey, what about my roof?"

408
0:19:18.26,000 --> 0:19:2,000
So we decided to come the year after

409
0:19:20.26,000 --> 0:19:23,000
and keep doing the project.

410
0:19:23.26,000 --> 0:19:25,000
A really important point for me

411
0:19:25.26,000 --> 0:19:28,000
is that I don't use any brand or corporate sponsors.

412
0:19:28.26,000 --> 0:19:3,000
So I have no responsibility

413
0:19:30.26,000 --> 0:19:32,000
to anyone but myself

414
0:19:32.26,000 --> 0:19:34,000
and the subjects.

415
0:19:34.26,000 --> 0:19:38,000
(Applause)

416
0:19:38.26,000 --> 0:19:4,000
And that is for me

417
0:19:40.26,000 --> 0:19:42,000
one of the more important things in the work.

418
0:19:42.26,000 --> 0:19:44,000
I think, today,

419
0:19:44.26,000 --> 0:19:47,000
as important as the result is the way you do things.

420
0:19:47.26,000 --> 0:19:5,000
And that has always been a central part of the work.

421
0:19:51.26,000 --> 0:19:53,000
And what's interesting is that fine line that I have

422
0:19:53.26,000 --> 0:19:55,000
with images and advertising.

423
0:19:55.26,000 --> 0:19:57,000
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles

424
0:19:57.26,000 --> 0:20:,000
on another project in the last weeks.

425
0:20:00.26,000 --> 0:20:04,000
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum.

426
0:20:04.26,000 --> 0:20:06,000
But yesterday the city called them and said,

427
0:20:06.26,000 --> 0:20:08,000
"Look, you're going to have to tear it down.

428
0:20:08.26,000 --> 0:20:1,000
Because this can be taken for advertising,

429
0:20:10.26,000 --> 0:20:12,000
and because of the law,

430
0:20:12.26,000 --> 0:20:14,000
it has to be taken down."

431
0:20:14.26,000 --> 0:20:17,000
But tell me, advertising for what?

432
0:20:17.26,000 --> 0:20:19,000
The people I photograph

433
0:20:19.26,000 --> 0:20:21,000
were proud to participate in the project

434
0:20:21.26,000 --> 0:20:23,000
and to have their photo in the community.

435
0:20:23.26,000 --> 0:20:25,000
But they asked me for a promise basically.

436
0:20:25.26,000 --> 0:20:29,000
They asked me, "Please, make our story travel with you."

437
0:20:29.26,000 --> 0:20:32,000
So I did. That's Paris.

438
0:20:32.26,000 --> 0:20:34,000
That's Rio.

439
0:20:34.26,000 --> 0:20:38,000
In each place, we built exhibitions with a story, and the story traveled.

440
0:20:38.26,000 --> 0:20:4,000
You understand the full scope of the project.

441
0:20:40.26,000 --> 0:20:43,000
That's London.

442
0:20:43.26,000 --> 0:20:45,000
New York.

443
0:20:45.26,000 --> 0:20:48,000
And today, they are with you in Long Beach.

444
0:20:49.26,000 --> 0:20:52,000
All right, recently I started a public art project

445
0:20:52.26,000 --> 0:20:55,000
where I don't use my artwork anymore.

446
0:20:55.26,000 --> 0:20:58,000
I use Man Ray, Helen Levitt,

447
0:20:58.26,000 --> 0:21:,000
Giacomelli, other people's artwork.

448
0:21:00.26,000 --> 0:21:03,000
It doesn't matter today if it's your photo or not.

449
0:21:03.26,000 --> 0:21:05,000
The importance is what you do

450
0:21:05.26,000 --> 0:21:07,000
with the images,

451
0:21:07.26,000 --> 0:21:1,000
the statement it makes where it's pasted.

452
0:21:10.26,000 --> 0:21:13,000
So for example, I pasted the photo of the minaret

453
0:21:13.26,000 --> 0:21:15,000
in Switzerland

454
0:21:15.26,000 --> 0:21:19,000
a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country.

455
0:21:19.26,000 --> 0:21:25,000
(Applause)

456
0:21:25.26,000 --> 0:21:28,000
This image of three men wearing gas masks

457
0:21:28.26,000 --> 0:21:3,000
was taken in Chernobyl originally,

458
0:21:30.26,000 --> 0:21:33,000
and I pasted it in Southern Italy,

459
0:21:33.26,000 --> 0:21:37,000
where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground.

460
0:21:39.26,000 --> 0:21:41,000
In some ways, art can change the world.

461
0:21:41.26,000 --> 0:21:43,000
Art is not supposed to change the world,

462
0:21:43.26,000 --> 0:21:45,000
to change practical things,

463
0:21:45.26,000 --> 0:21:47,000
but to change perceptions.

464
0:21:47.26,000 --> 0:21:49,000
Art can change

465
0:21:49.26,000 --> 0:21:51,000
the way we see the world.

466
0:21:51.26,000 --> 0:21:54,000
Art can create an analogy.

467
0:21:54.26,000 --> 0:21:57,000
Actually the fact that art cannot change things

468
0:21:57.26,000 --> 0:21:59,000
makes it a neutral place

469
0:21:59.26,000 --> 0:22:02,000
for exchanges and discussions,

470
0:22:02.26,000 --> 0:22:05,000
and then enables you to change the world.

471
0:22:05.26,000 --> 0:22:07,000
When I do my work,

472
0:22:07.26,000 --> 0:22:09,000
I have two kinds of reactions.

473
0:22:09.26,000 --> 0:22:12,000
People say, "Oh, why don't you go in Iraq or Afghanistan.

474
0:22:12.26,000 --> 0:22:14,000
They would be really useful."

475
0:22:14.26,000 --> 0:22:17,000
Or, "How can we help?"

476
0:22:17.26,000 --> 0:22:2,000
I presume that you belong to the second category,

477
0:22:20.26,000 --> 0:22:22,000
and that's good,

478
0:22:22.26,000 --> 0:22:24,000
because for that project,

479
0:22:24.26,000 --> 0:22:26,000
I'm going to ask you to take the photos

480
0:22:26.26,000 --> 0:22:29,000
and paste them.

481
0:22:29.26,000 --> 0:22:31,000
So now my wish is:

482
0:22:31.26,000 --> 0:22:33,000
(mock drum roll)

483
0:22:33.26,000 --> 0:22:35,000
(Laughter)

484
0:22:36.26,000 --> 0:22:39,000
I wish for you to stand up

485
0:22:39.26,000 --> 0:22:42,000
for what you care about

486
0:22:42.26,000 --> 0:22:45,000
by participating in a global art project,

487
0:22:45.26,000 --> 0:22:5,000
and together we'll turn the world inside out.

488
0:22:51.26,000 --> 0:22:53,000
And this starts right now.

489
0:22:53.26,000 --> 0:22:55,000
Yes, everyone in the room.

490
0:22:55.26,000 --> 0:22:58,000
Everyone watching.

491
0:22:58.26,000 --> 0:23:,000
I wanted that wish

492
0:23:00.26,000 --> 0:23:02,000
to actually start now.

493
0:23:02.26,000 --> 0:23:05,000
So a subject you're passionate about, a person who you want to tell their story

494
0:23:05.26,000 --> 0:23:07,000
or even your own photos --

495
0:23:07.26,000 --> 0:23:09,000
tell me what you stand for.

496
0:23:09.26,000 --> 0:23:11,000
Take the photos, the portraits,

497
0:23:11.26,000 --> 0:23:14,000
upload it -- I'll give you all the details --

498
0:23:14.26,000 --> 0:23:17,000
and I'll send you back your poster. Join by groups

499
0:23:17.26,000 --> 0:23:2,000
and reveal things to the world.

500
0:23:20.26,000 --> 0:23:23,000
The full data is on the website --

501
0:23:23.26,000 --> 0:23:25,000
insideoutproject.net --

502
0:23:25.26,000 --> 0:23:28,000
that is launching today.

503
0:23:28.26,000 --> 0:23:3,000
What we see changes who we are.

504
0:23:30.26,000 --> 0:23:32,000
When we act together,

505
0:23:32.26,000 --> 0:23:35,000
the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts.

506
0:23:36.26,000 --> 0:23:38,000
So I hope that, together, we'll create something

507
0:23:38.26,000 --> 0:23:4,000
that the world will remember.

508
0:23:40.26,000 --> 0:23:43,000
And this starts right now and depends on you.

509
0:23:43.26,000 --> 0:23:45,000
Thank you.

510
0:23:45.26,000 --> 0:23:52,000
(Applause)

511
0:23:52.26,000 --> 0:23:54,000
Thank you.

512
0:23:54.26,000 --> 0:24:02,000
(Applause)

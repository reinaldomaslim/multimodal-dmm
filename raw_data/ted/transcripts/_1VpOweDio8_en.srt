1
0:00:12.766,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I would like to start

2
0:00:14.543,000 --> 0:00:15,000
with the story of Mary,

3
0:00:16.504,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a woman from an African village.

4
0:00:19.495,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Her first memories

5
0:00:21.088,000 --> 0:00:23,000
are of her family fleeing violent riots

6
0:00:23.94,000 --> 0:00:26,000
orchestrated by the ruling political party.

7
0:00:27.797,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Her brother was murdered by the state-sponsored militia,

8
0:00:31.794,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and she was raped more than once

9
0:00:33.371,000 --> 0:00:37,000
just because she belonged to the wrong party.

10
0:00:38.61,000 --> 0:00:41,000
One morning, a month before the election,

11
0:00:41.743,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Mary's village was called to another intimidation meeting.

12
0:00:45.464,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In this meeting, there is a man standing in front of them,

13
0:00:48.243,000 --> 0:00:5,000
telling them, "We know who you are,

14
0:00:50.701,000 --> 0:00:52,000
we know who you will vote for,

15
0:00:53.352,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and if you're not going to drop the right paper,

16
0:00:55.762,000 --> 0:00:58,000
we're going to take revenge."

17
0:00:59.1,000 --> 0:01:01,000
But for Mary, this meeting is different.

18
0:01:02.059,000 --> 0:01:03,000
She feels different.

19
0:01:03.793,000 --> 0:01:05,000
This time, she's waiting for this meeting,

20
0:01:06.43,000 --> 0:01:1,000
because this time, she's carrying a small hidden camera in her dress,

21
0:01:10.599,000 --> 0:01:13,000
a camera that nobody else can see.

22
0:01:13.655,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Nobody is allowed to film in these meetings.

23
0:01:15.722,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You risk your life if you do.

24
0:01:17.781,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Mary knows that, but she also knows that the only way to stop them

25
0:01:22.179,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and to protect herself and her community

26
0:01:25.751,000 --> 0:01:27,000
is to expose their intimidation,

27
0:01:28.066,000 --> 0:01:31,000
to make sure they understand somebody is following them,

28
0:01:32.048,000 --> 0:01:35,000
to break the impunity they feel.

29
0:01:35.738,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Mary and her friends were filming for months, undercover,

30
0:01:39.724,000 --> 0:01:42,000
the intimidation of the ruling political party.

Oren Yakobovich: These images were broadcast all over the world,

48
0:02:53.586,000 --> 0:02:54,000
but more importantly,

49
0:02:55.183,000 --> 0:02:58,000
they have been broadcast back to the community.

50
0:02:58.336,000 --> 0:03:,000

51
0:03:01.22,000 --> 0:03:03,000
They understood somebody is following them.

52

They got scared. Impunity was broken.

53
0:03:07.07,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Mary and her friends forced the ruling political party

not to use violence during the election,

and saved hundreds of lives.

56

Mary is just one of hundreds of people

57
0:03:18.402,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that my organization had helped to document human rights violations

58
0:03:21.962,000 --> 0:03:23,000
using cameras.

59
0:03:24.862,000 --> 0:03:27,000
My background should have led me to a different direction.

60
0:03:28.223,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I was born in Israel to a right-wing family,

61
0:03:31.472,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and as long as I remember myself,

62
0:03:33.378,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I wanted to join the Israeli army to serve my country

63
0:03:36.473,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and prove what I believed was our right for the whole land.

64
0:03:40.924,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I joined the Israeli army just after the first intifada,

65
0:03:46.204,000 --> 0:03:48,000
the first Palestinian uprising,

66
0:03:48.584,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and I served in one of the hard-minded,

67
0:03:50.492,000 --> 0:03:53,000
toughest, aggressive infantry units,

68
0:03:54.012,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and I got the biggest gun in my platoon.

69
0:03:58.971,000 --> 0:04:,000
Quite fast, I became an officer

70
0:04:01.431,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and got soldiers under my command,

71
0:04:04.422,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and as time passed, I started serving in the West Bank,

72
0:04:07.347,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and I saw these images.

73
0:04:17.811,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I didn't like what I saw.

74
0:04:20.077,000 --> 0:04:21,000
It took me a while,

75
0:04:21.496,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but eventually I refused to serve in the West Bank

76
0:04:24.738,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and had to spend time in jail.

77
0:04:27.594,000 --> 0:04:28,000
It was a bit —

78
0:04:28.754,000 --> 0:04:3,000
(Applause) —

79
0:04:31.73,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It was not that bad, I have to say.

80
0:04:33.422,000 --> 0:04:36,000
It was a bit like being in a hotel, but with very shitty food.

81
0:04:36.505,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

82
0:04:38.17,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In jail, I kept thinking that I need people to know.

83
0:04:42.042,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I need people to understand

84
0:04:43.708,000 --> 0:04:45,000
what the reality in the West Bank looks like.

85
0:04:46.564,000 --> 0:04:48,000
I need them to hear what I heard,

86
0:04:49.002,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I need them to see what I saw,

87
0:04:50.906,000 --> 0:04:53,000
but I also understood, we need the Palestinians themselves,

88
0:04:54.244,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the people that are suffering,

89
0:04:55.733,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to be able to tell their own stories,

90
0:04:57.965,000 --> 0:05:02,000
not journalists or filmmakers that are coming outside of the situation.

91
0:05:04.071,000 --> 0:05:06,000
I joined a human rights organization,

92
0:05:06.649,000 --> 0:05:09,000
an Israeli human rights organization called B'Tselem.

93
0:05:09.789,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Together, we analyzed the West Bank

94
0:05:11.864,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and picked 100 families that are living in the most risky places:

95
0:05:15.789,000 --> 0:05:18,000
close to checkpoints, near army bases,

96
0:05:19.604,000 --> 0:05:21,000
side by side with settlers.

97
0:05:22.059,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We gave them cameras and training.

98
0:05:25.901,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Quite fast, we started getting very disturbing images

99
0:05:30.231,000 --> 0:05:34,000
about how the settlers and the soldiers are abusing them.

100
0:05:35.213,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I would like to share with you two clips from this project.

101
0:05:38.333,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Both of them were broadcast in Israel, and it created a massive debate.

102
0:05:42.478,000 --> 0:05:43,000
And I have to warn you,

103
0:05:43.77,000 --> 0:05:46,000
some of you might find them quite explicit.

104
0:05:47.03,000 --> 0:05:49,000
The masked men you will see in the first clips

105
0:05:49.454,000 --> 0:05:5,000
are Jewish settlers.

106
0:05:51.184,000 --> 0:05:53,000
Minutes before the camera was turned on,

107
0:05:53.67,000 --> 0:05:54,000
they approached a Palestinian family

108
0:05:55.548,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that was working their land

109
0:05:57.36,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and told them that they have to leave the land,

110
0:05:59.567,000 --> 0:06:01,000
because this land belongs to the Jewish settlers.

111
0:06:02.119,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The Palestinians refused.

112
0:06:04.046,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Let's see what happened.

113
0:06:07.109,000 --> 0:06:1,000
The masked men that are approaching are Jewish settlers.

114
0:06:10.925,000 --> 0:06:15,000
They are approaching the Palestinian family.

115
0:06:33.087,000 --> 0:06:35,000
This is a demonstration in the West Bank.

116
0:06:35.461,000 --> 0:06:36,000
The guy in green is Palestinian.

117
0:06:37.063,000 --> 0:06:39,000
He will be arrested in a second.

118
0:06:39.873,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Here you see him blindfolded and handcuffed.

119
0:06:42.706,000 --> 0:06:45,000
In a few seconds, he regrets he came to this demonstration.

120
0:06:49.824,000 --> 0:06:53,000
He's been shot in the foot with a rubber bullet.

121
0:06:55.256,000 --> 0:06:57,000
He is okay.

122
0:07:00.242,000 --> 0:07:04,000
Not all the settlers and the soldiers are acting this way.

123
0:07:04.813,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We're talking about a tiny minority, but they have to be brought to justice.

124
0:07:09.058,000 --> 0:07:11,000
These clips, and others like them,

125
0:07:11.311,000 --> 0:07:14,000
forced the army and the police to start investigations.

126
0:07:14.709,000 --> 0:07:16,000
They've been shown in Israel, of course,

127
0:07:16.963,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and the Israeli public was exposed to them also.

128
0:07:20.039,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This project redefined the struggle for human rights

129
0:07:23.107,000 --> 0:07:24,000
in the occupied territories,

130
0:07:24.708,000 --> 0:07:28,000
and we managed to reduce the number of violent attacks in the West Bank.

131
0:07:32.517,000 --> 0:07:34,000
The success of this project got me thinking

132
0:07:34.716,000 --> 0:07:37,000
how I can take the same methodology to other places in the world.

133
0:07:38.306,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Now, we tend to believe that today,

134
0:07:40.016,000 --> 0:07:41,000
with all of the technology,

135
0:07:41.722,000 --> 0:07:42,000
the smartphones and the Internet,

136
0:07:43.352,000 --> 0:07:46,000
we are able to see and understand most of what's happening in the world,

137
0:07:46.748,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and people are able to tell their story —

138
0:07:48.897,000 --> 0:07:49,000
but it's only partly true.

139
0:07:50.796,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Still today, with all the technology we have,

140
0:07:53.794,000 --> 0:07:55,000
less than half of the world's population

141
0:07:56.202,000 --> 0:07:58,000
has access to the Internet,

142
0:07:58.478,000 --> 0:08:,000
and more than three billion people —

143
0:08:01.025,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I'm repeating the number —

144
0:08:02.589,000 --> 0:08:08,000
three billion people are consuming news that is censored by those in power.

145
0:08:10.59,000 --> 0:08:11,000
More or less around the same time,

146
0:08:12.419,000 --> 0:08:15,000
I'm approached by a great guy named Uri Fruchtmann.

147
0:08:15.537,000 --> 0:08:17,000
He's a filmmaker and an activist.

148
0:08:17.893,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We understood we were thinking along the same lines,

149
0:08:20.469,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and we decided to establish Videre, our organization, together.

150
0:08:26.658,000 --> 0:08:28,000
While building the organization in London,

151
0:08:29.522,000 --> 0:08:31,000
we've been traveling undercover to places

152
0:08:31.594,000 --> 0:08:33,000
where a community was suffering from abuses,

153
0:08:33.781,000 --> 0:08:35,000
where mass atrocities were happening,

154
0:08:36.449,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and there was a lack of reporting.

155
0:08:39.326,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We tried to understand how we can help.

156
0:08:43.121,000 --> 0:08:45,000
There were four things that I learned.

157
0:08:45.79,000 --> 0:08:47,000
The first thing is that we have to engage

158
0:08:48.25,000 --> 0:08:51,000
with communities that are living in rural areas,

159
0:08:51.409,000 --> 0:08:54,000
where violations are happening far from the public eye.

160
0:08:54.814,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We need to partner with them,

161
0:08:56.645,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and we need to understand which images are not making it out there

162
0:09:00.566,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and help them to document them.

163
0:09:03.824,000 --> 0:09:04,000
The second thing I learned

164
0:09:05.642,000 --> 0:09:08,000
is that we have to enable them to film in a safe way.

165
0:09:09.424,000 --> 0:09:13,000
Security has to be the priority.

166
0:09:13.803,000 --> 0:09:15,000
Where I used to work before, in the West Bank,

167
0:09:16.006,000 --> 0:09:17,000
one can take a camera out,

168
0:09:17.646,000 --> 0:09:19,000
most likely not going to get shot,

169
0:09:20.339,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but in places we wanted to work,

170
0:09:21.884,000 --> 0:09:26,000
just try to pull a phone out, and you're dead — literally dead.

171
0:09:27.094,000 --> 0:09:28,000
This is why we decided

172
0:09:28.624,000 --> 0:09:29,000
to take the operation undercover

173
0:09:30.568,000 --> 0:09:31,000
when necessary,

174
0:09:31.995,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and use mostly hidden cameras.

175
0:09:34.026,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Unfortunately, I can't show you the hidden cameras we're using today —

176
0:09:37.403,000 --> 0:09:38,000
for obvious reasons —

177
0:09:38.845,000 --> 0:09:4,000
but these are cameras we used before.

178
0:09:41.097,000 --> 0:09:43,000
You can buy them off the shelf.

179
0:09:43.187,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Today, we're building a custom-made hidden camera,

180
0:09:46.786,000 --> 0:09:47,000
like the one that Mary was wearing

181
0:09:48.648,000 --> 0:09:5,000
in her dress to film the intimidation meeting

182
0:09:50.942,000 --> 0:09:52,000
of the ruling political party.

183
0:09:52.954,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's a camera that nobody can see,

184
0:09:54.796,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that blends into the environment,

185
0:09:57.745,000 --> 0:09:59,000
into the surroundings.

186
0:09:59.824,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Now, filming securities go beyond using hidden cameras.

187
0:10:03.272,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Being secure starts way before the activist is turning the camera on.

188
0:10:08.162,000 --> 0:10:1,000
To keep our partners safe,

189
0:10:10.214,000 --> 0:10:12,000
we work to understand the risk of every location

190
0:10:12.966,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and of every shot before it's happened,

191
0:10:15.647,000 --> 0:10:17,000
building a backup plan if something goes wrong,

192
0:10:18.549,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and making sure we have everything in place

193
0:10:20.941,000 --> 0:10:22,000
before our operations start.

194
0:10:23.892,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The third thing I learned is the importance of verification.

195
0:10:27.707,000 --> 0:10:29,000
You can have an amazing shot of atrocity,

196
0:10:30.311,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but if you can't verify it, it's worth nothing.

197
0:10:34.079,000 --> 0:10:37,000
Recently, like in the ongoing war in Syria or the war in Gaza,

198
0:10:37.562,000 --> 0:10:42,000
we've seen images that are staged or brought from a different conflict.

199
0:10:42.875,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This misinformation destroyed the credibility of the source,

200
0:10:45.828,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and it's harmed the credibility of other reliable and trustworthy sources.

201
0:10:50.608,000 --> 0:10:54,000
We use a variety of ways to make sure we can verify the information

202
0:10:54.611,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and we can trust the material.

203
0:10:56.559,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It starts with vetting the partners,

204
0:10:58.432,000 --> 0:11:01,000
understanding who they are, and working with them very intensively.

205
0:11:01.645,000 --> 0:11:03,000
How do you film a location?

206
0:11:03.78,000 --> 0:11:04,000
You film road signs, you film watches,

207
0:11:05.614,000 --> 0:11:06,000
you film newspapers.

208
0:11:06.956,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We are checking maps, looking at maps,

209
0:11:11.442,000 --> 0:11:13,000
double-checking the information,

210
0:11:13.695,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and looking also at the metadata of the material.

211
0:11:18.078,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Now, the fourth and the most important thing I learned

212
0:11:21.197,000 --> 0:11:25,000
is how you use images to create a positive change.

213
0:11:26.45,000 --> 0:11:27,000
To have an effect,

214
0:11:28.299,000 --> 0:11:32,000
the key thing is how you use the material.

215
0:11:32.886,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Today, we're working with hundreds of activists

216
0:11:35.404,000 --> 0:11:36,000
filming undercover.

217
0:11:36.953,000 --> 0:11:39,000
We work with them both to understand the situation on the ground

218
0:11:40.055,000 --> 0:11:42,000
and which images are missing to describe it,

219
0:11:43.045,000 --> 0:11:47,000
who are the ones that are influencing the situation,

220
0:11:47.979,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and when to release the material to advance the struggle.

221
0:11:52.036,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Sometimes, it's about putting it in the media,

222
0:11:54.473,000 --> 0:11:55,000
mostly local ones, to create awareness.

223
0:11:56.399,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Sometimes it's working with decision makers,

224
0:11:58.835,000 --> 0:11:59,000
to change laws.

225
0:12:00.009,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Sometimes, it's working with lawyers to use as evidence in court.

226
0:12:04.535,000 --> 0:12:05,000
But more than often,

227
0:12:06.053,000 --> 0:12:09,000
the most effective way to create a social change

228
0:12:10.011,000 --> 0:12:12,000
is to work within the community.

229
0:12:12.342,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I want to give you one example.

230
0:12:14.575,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Fatuma is part of a network of women that are fighting abuses in Kenya.

231
0:12:20.351,000 --> 0:12:22,000
Women in her community have been harassed constantly

232
0:12:23.282,000 --> 0:12:25,000
on their way to school and on their way to work.

233
0:12:26.157,000 --> 0:12:29,000
They are trying to change the behavior of the community from inside.

234
0:12:29.854,000 --> 0:12:31,000
In the next clip,

235
0:12:32.384,000 --> 0:12:36,000
Fatuma is taking us with her on her journey to work.

236
0:12:36.649,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Her voice is superimposed on images that she filmed herself

237
0:12:40.557,000 --> 0:12:42,000
using hidden cameras.

238
0:12:43.095,000 --> 0:12:45,000
(Video) Fatuma Chiusiku: My name is Fatuma Chiusiku.

239
0:12:45.572,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I'm 32 years old, a mother,

240
0:12:47.824,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And Ziwa La Ng'Ombe is my home.

241
0:12:51.439,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Each morning, I ride the mini-bus

242
0:12:53.652,000 --> 0:12:55,000
Number 11.

243
0:12:56.009,000 --> 0:12:59,000
But instead of a peaceful journey to work,

244
0:12:59.062,000 --> 0:13:02,000
each day begins with fear.

245
0:13:02.491,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Come with me now

246
0:13:03.991,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and use my eyes

247
0:13:05.796,000 --> 0:13:1,000
to feel what I feel.

248
0:13:11.569,000 --> 0:13:13,000
As I walk, I think to myself:

249
0:13:13.714,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Will I be touched?

250
0:13:15.385,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Grabbed?

251
0:13:16.65,000 --> 0:13:19,000
Violated by this conductor again?

252
0:13:20.114,000 --> 0:13:22,000
Even the men inside

253
0:13:22.207,000 --> 0:13:24,000
the way they look at me

254
0:13:24.35,000 --> 0:13:26,000
touch my body, rub against me,

255
0:13:26.666,000 --> 0:13:27,000
grab me,

256
0:13:28.619,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and now, as I sit in my seat

257
0:13:30.892,000 --> 0:13:32,000
I only wish my mind was full of thoughts for my day,

258
0:13:33.734,000 --> 0:13:34,000
my dreams, my children at school,

259
0:13:35.35,000 --> 0:13:39,000
but instead I worry about the moment when we will arrive

260
0:13:39.617,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and I will be violated again.

261
0:13:44.785,000 --> 0:13:49,000
OY: Today, there is a new front in the fight for human rights.

262
0:13:50.15,000 --> 0:13:52,000
I used to carry a big gun.

263
0:13:52.695,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Now, I am carrying this.

264
0:13:55.868,000 --> 0:14:01,000
This is a much more powerful and much, much more effective weapon.

265
0:14:02.298,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But we have to use its power wisely.

266
0:14:06.429,000 --> 0:14:11,000
By putting the right images in the right hands at the right time,

267
0:14:11.793,000 --> 0:14:13,000
we can truly create an impact.

268
0:14:14.585,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Thank you.

269
0:14:16.819,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

270
0:14:25.244,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Thank you.

271
0:14:27.848,000 --> 0:14:29,000
(Applause)

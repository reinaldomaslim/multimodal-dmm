1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
The moment I say "school,"

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
so many memories come back to me.

3
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It's like after every exam, when I walk out,

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
the teacher would say, "Hey, come.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
How did you do?"

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
I would say with a great smile, "I will definitely pass."

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And I didn't understand why,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
in one hand they say, "Speak the truth,"

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
in the other hand, when you say the truth, they hated you.

10
0:00:38.046,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So it went on like that,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and I didn't know where else to find myself.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
So I remember those nights

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I used to go to sleep

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
with asking help from [the] Unknown

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
because, for some reason,

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
I couldn't believe what my father and mother

17
0:00:53.38,000 --> 0:00:55,000
hanged in the Puja room as a god,

18
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
because my friend's family

19
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
had something else as a god.

20
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
So I thought, "I guess I'll pray to [the] Unknown

21
0:01:02.618,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and ask help,"

22
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and started getting help from everywhere,

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
each and every corner of my life at that time.

24
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
My brothers started giving me a few tips about drawing and painting.

25
0:01:14.523,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Then, when I was in eighth standard

26
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
around 13 years old,

27
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I started working in a part-time job

28
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
in one of the signboard artists called Putu.

29
0:01:28.212,000 --> 0:01:3,000
And then school also started supporting me.

30
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
"Oh, he's bad at studies,

31
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
but let him send to the drawing competitions."

32
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
So it was good to survive with that little tool

33
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that I found to find my own place in school.

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And one of those competitions,

35
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I just won a small, little transistor Philips radio.

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And I didn't have the patience to wait

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
until I reached home.

38
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
So I just switched on in the train, loudly.

39
0:01:53.332,000 --> 0:01:54,000
If you travel in Indian trains,

40
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
you can see people listening to radio

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and, you know, even from their mobiles.

42
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
So at that time -- and I was 13 --

43
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and I was listening to just radio,

44
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and someone happened to sit next to me,

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
like these three people are sitting here.

46
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
You know, like just adjacent to me.

47
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
He just started asking, "Where did you buy the radio? How much is it?"

48
0:02:13.618,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I said, "It's a prize from [an] art competition."

49
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And he said, "Oh, I teach at a college of arts.

50
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I think

51
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
you should study in a school of art.

52
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
You just quit school and come there."

53
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
So, why I'm telling you this,

54
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
you know, maybe, you know,

55
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
whoever is sitting next to you can change your whole life -- it's possible.

56
0:02:32.856,000 --> 0:02:35,000
It is that we need we need to be open and fine-tuned.

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So that's what made me enter

58
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
[the] college of arts after three attempts

59
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and just continue to inquire

60
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
what I really want to do with art work, or art

61
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and finally I'm here in front of you.

62
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
When I look back, you know,

63
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
on what happened between that time

64
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and now here --

65
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
the last 10/15 years --

66
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I can see that most of the works

67
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
revolve around three subjects,

68
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
but it was not intentional.

69
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And I just start out with a trace because I was thinking,

70
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"What really makes us?" -- you know,

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
it's actually [the] past, what makes a person.

72
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So I was thinking,

73
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
but when you look at the past,

74
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the way to understand the past

75
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
is only by the traces available,

76
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because we cannot go back [to] the past.

77
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
It can be ruins, or it can be music,

78
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
or it can be painting or drawing or writing, whatever it is.

79
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But it is just a kind of trace of that time.

80
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And that fascinated me,

81
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to explore that territory.

82
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
So I was working on the line,

83
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
but instead of working about traces,

84
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I started capturing traces.

85
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So here are some of the works I would like to show you.

86
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So this is called "Self In Progress."

87
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
It's just a trace of being in this body.

88
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So here, what happened then,

89
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
you know -- what I really enjoyed the most

90
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
is that this sculpture

91
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
is nothing but a trace of myself.

92
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It's almost like a 3D photograph.

93
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So there is an element of performance,

94
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and there is an element of sculpture,

95
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and there is an element of feeling one's self, so close to one's self.

96
0:04:18.618,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So it's almost like fossils for the future.

97
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And then moved slowly

98
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to explore the other possibilities of capturing traces.

99
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So this is what I was talking about, while molding,

100
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
it's such a great experience,

101
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
because we have freedom of like walking,

102
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
or moving my hand or, moving around in the space,

103
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
but the moment this becomes solid,

104
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
when you cannot move even an inch,

105
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
because this is plaster of Paris, so the moment you pour it it's like liquid;

106
0:04:48.951,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but after 20 minutes, it's almost like a hard stone.

107
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
So this is capturing the trace of a thumbprint

108
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
because, knowingly or unknowingly,

109
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
whatever we do, you know, we leave our traces here.

110
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So I just thought, "I'm going to capture

111
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
thumbprint, footprint,

112
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
or whatever traces we leave as humans."

113
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
This is the trace of fire,

114
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
this is the trace of sun.

115
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Because when I was capturing traces, you know,

116
0:05:17.475,000 --> 0:05:19,000
this thought comes to me always:

117
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
is it, only when the object touches the thing and it leaves the trace,

118
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
or is there other ways to capture it?"

119
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So this work is nothing but like --

120
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because of the focal length of the lens,

121
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
it just shows what is on the other side.

122
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
So I just put the paper on the focal length,

123
0:05:35.38,000 --> 0:05:36,000
which was an etching print,

124
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
then I got the portrait of [the] sun from sunlight.

125
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
This is called "Dawn to Dawn."

126
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
What I did here, I just put like 10 feet [of] paper

127
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
then put a coconut rope,

128
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and just burnt it.

129
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So it took about 24 hours to get this line.

130
0:05:52.308,000 --> 0:05:54,000
So wherever the fire is eating the paper,

131
0:05:54.308,000 --> 0:05:55,000
that's what becomes the work --

132
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
detail.

133
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
Even though we have traces

134
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
when we try to understand them,

135
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
the perception and context

136
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
play a major role to understand it.

137
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So do we really understand what it is,

138
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
or are we trying to get

139
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
what we think it is?

140
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
Then move towards questioning the perception

141
0:06:21.38,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because, even though there are traces,

142
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
when you try to understand them, you know you play a major role.

143
0:06:26.332,000 --> 0:06:27,000
So like let's say even a simple act.

144
0:06:28.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
How many of you saw a cow crossing in India

145
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
while you were coming from Bangalore to Mysore?

146
0:06:33.523,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Can you just raise the hand?

147
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
If you just ask an opinion

148
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
of how, everyone can interpret it.

149
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Like, let's say, if a schoolteacher says,

150
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
she'll simply say, "To get to the other side."

151
0:06:45.475,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Why the cow was crossing the road, you know.

152
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The answer can be so different if Potter said it.

153
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
He would say, "For the greater good."

154
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Martin Luther King would say,

155
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
"I imagine a world where all cows will be free

156
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
to cross the road,

157
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
without having their motives called into question."

158
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
(Laughter)

159
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Imagine Moses comes now, and he sees

160
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
the same cow walking around the street.

161
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
He would definitely say,

162
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
"God came down from heaven,

163
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and he said unto the cow,

164
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
'Thou shalt cross the road.'

165
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And cow crossed the road,

166
0:07:23.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
and there was much rejoicing as a holy cow."

167
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Freud would say,

169
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
"The fact that you're at all concerned

170
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
reveals your underlying sexual insecurity."

171
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
(Laughter)

172
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
If we ask Einstein,

173
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
he would say, "Whether the cow crossed the road,

174
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
or the road moved underneath the cow,

175
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
depends on your frame of reference."

176
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
(Laughter)

177
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Or Buddha --

178
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
if he saw the same cow, he would say,

179
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
"Asking this question denies your own nature [as a] cow."

180
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Laughter)

181
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
So, what we see

182
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
is just what we think often,

183
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
and most of the time, we don't see what it is.

184
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It just all depends on one's perception.

185
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And context, what is really context?

186
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
You know, I could just show you this little piece of paper.

187
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Because I always think meaning doesn't really exist.

188
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
The meaning of what we create in this world doesn't exist.

189
0:08:24.046,000 --> 0:08:26,000
It's just created by the mind.

190
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
If you look at this piece of paper,

191
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
this is the breadth

192
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and this is called length.

193
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
This is how we've been taught in school.

194
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But if you tear it in the middle --

195
0:08:40.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
now, I didn't touch this breadth,

196
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
but still, the meaning of this changes.

197
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
So what we conceive as a meaning

198
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is always not there;

199
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:5,000
it's on the other side,

200
0:08:50.26,000 --> 0:08:52,000
even when we say dark, light,

201
0:08:52.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
good, bad, tall, short --

202
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
all meaning it doesn't exist in reality.

203
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It's just that being a human,

204
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
the way we train to perceive the reality

205
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
creates this meaning.

206
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So this work from this period

207
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
is mostly like --

208
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
you know, this is a work called "Light Makes Dark."

209
0:09:10.713,000 --> 0:09:12,000
It's just captured through from the lamp.

210
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So the lamp is not just giving a light, it's also giving a darkness.

211
0:09:16.523,000 --> 0:09:19,000
So this is a work of art, which is just trying to explore that.

212
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
This is called "Limit Out."

213
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
This shows how limited our eye or hearing sense or touch --

214
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
do we really see?

215
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
This is an exact negative.

216
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
It's about six inches deep in the wall,

217
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but it just appears like it's coming out of the wall.

218
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
You know the wall is almost like --

219
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
this is the first skin, and this is the second,

220
0:09:41.499,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and there's a third, and each creates a meaning.

221
0:09:43.809,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And we're just pulling the wall off the gallery.

222
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Again, "Inward Out."

223
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It's a full-figure cast from myself.

224
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
It's about eight inches deep.

225
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
When I was doing that, I always wondered since I've worked with creators --

226
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and now you know, I've moved to questioning the perception --

227
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
whenever I see the bird flying in the sky,

228
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
it just makes me feel like:

229
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is there anything behind, are there any traces up there,

230
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
which as a human, we don't see them?

231
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Is there any way to capture the thought

232
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
into visual art?

233
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
I couldn't find it.

234
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
But a solution arrived

235
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
after being quiet and not working for about six, seven months,

236
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
in the restroom,

237
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
when I was changing the air freshener

238
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
that goes from solid substance to vapor.

239
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It's called Odonil.

240
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
This is the work I made out of that material.

241
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
The process to get to make the sculpture was interesting,

242
0:10:44.951,000 --> 0:10:45,000
because I wrote to Balsara,

243
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
who produces that air freshener called Odonil,

244
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
saying, "Dear Sir, I am an artist. This is my catalogue.

245
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Will you help me to make this sculpture?"

246
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
They never wrote back to me.

247
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Then I thought, "I will go to the Small Scale Industries

248
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Facilitating Unit and ask help."

249
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So I told them, "I'd like to start an air freshener company."

250
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
They said, "Of course.

251
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
This is the fee for the project report,

252
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
and we will give you all the details," and they gave.

253
0:11:09.808,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Finally, I went back to them and said,

254
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
"It's not for starting the company, it's just to make my own work.

255
0:11:15.427,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Please come for the show."

256
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
And they did.

257
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
And this work is in the Devi Art Foundation in Delhi.

258
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
In India, nobody really talks about works of art;

259
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
they always talk about the appreciation of art.

260
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
You buy this for 3,000 rupees,

261
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
it'll become 30,000 in two months.

262
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This is the craft that was going on,

263
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
but there are a few collectors

264
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
who also collect art which can depreciate.

265
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
And this was collected by Anupam --

266
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
which is like, finally in the end, he will not have anything,

267
0:11:43.189,000 --> 0:11:45,000
because it will evaporate.

268
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
So this is after a few weeks,

269
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
this is after a few months.

270
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
It's just all about questioning the preconceptions.

271
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
So if someone says, "Oh, I see the portrait,"

272
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
it may not be the portrait after a few months.

273
0:11:59.475,000 --> 0:12:,000
And if they say it's solid,

274
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
it will not be solid, it will evaporate.

275
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And if they say they don't get it,

276
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that's also not true,

277
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000
because it's in the air.

278
0:12:10.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
It's in the same gallery or in the same museum.

279
0:12:12.523,000 --> 0:12:13,000
So they inhaled it,

280
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
but they are not aware of it.

281
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
While I was doing that work,

282
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
my mom and my dad,

283
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
they were looking at it and they said,

284
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
"Why do you deal with negative subjects all the time?"

285
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And I was like, "What do you mean?"

286
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
"Light makes dark and now evaporating self.

287
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Don't you think it remained something about death," they said.

288
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
"Of course not. For me," I'm thinking,

289
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
"this is tucked in some small solid,

290
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
but the moment it evaporates,

291
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
it's merged with the whole."

292
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
But she said, "No. Still, I don't like it.

293
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
Can you make something from nothing

294
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
as a sculptor?"

295
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I said, "No, mom. It can't be.

296
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Because we can create

297
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
a sculpture

298
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
by gathering dust together,

299
0:12:57.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
or we can break the sculpture and get the dust,

300
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
but there is nowhere that we can bring dust into the universe."

301
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
So, I did this work for her.

302
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
It's called "Emerging Angel."

303
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
This is the first day --

304
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
it just gives the appearance

305
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
that one is becoming the other.

306
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
So, the same sculpture

307
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
after a few days.

308
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
This is after 15/20 days.

309
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Through that small little slit

310
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
between the glass box and the wood,

311
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:3,000
the air goes underneath the sculpture and creates the other one.

312
0:13:30.332,000 --> 0:13:31,000
This gave me a greater faith.

313
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
That evaporating sculpture gave me a greater faith

314
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
that maybe there is many more possibilities

315
0:13:37.332,000 --> 0:13:38,000
to capture [the] invisible.

316
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
So what you see now

317
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
is called "Shadow Foreshadow."

318
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And what I'd like to tell you

319
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
is we don't see shadow, and we don't see light too;

320
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
we see the source of the light.

321
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
We see where it's bouncing, but we don't see [them] as they exist.

322
0:13:54.427,000 --> 0:13:56,000
You know, that's why the night sky, we see the sky as dark,

323
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
but it's filled with light all the time.

324
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
When it's bounced on the moon, we see it.

325
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
The same thing in the darkroom.

326
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
The little dust particle will again, reflect the light,

327
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and we realize the existence of light.

328
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
So we don't see dark, we don't see light,

329
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:14,000
we don't see gravity, we don't see electricity.

330
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
So, I just started doing this work

331
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
to inquire further

332
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
about how to sculpt

333
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:25,000
the space between this object and there.

334
0:14:25.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Because, as a visual artist, if I'm seeing this and I'm seeing that --

335
0:14:28.618,000 --> 0:14:3,000
but how to sculpt this, you know?

336
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
If we sculpt this, this has two reference points.

337
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The skin of this is also representing this.

338
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And skin at the other end also represents the floor.

339
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
I did this as an experiment

340
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
of casting the shadow.

341
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:48,000
So this is a corrugated box and its shadow.

342
0:14:48.26,000 --> 0:14:5,000
Then the second one --

343
0:14:50.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
the moment you bring any invisible into the visible world

344
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
it will have all the characteristics of the visible existence.

345
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
So that produced a shadow.

346
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
Then I thought, okay, let me sculpt that.

347
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Then, again, that becomes an object.

348
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Again, throwing light, then the third one.

349
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
So what you see is nothing but shadow

350
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
of a shadow of a shadow.

351
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
And then again, at that point, there is no shadow.

352
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
I thought, "Oh, good. Work is finished."

353
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
You can see the detail.

354
0:15:22.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
This is called "Gravity."

355
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
It's called "Breath." It's just two holes on the gallery wall.

356
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
It's a false wall, which contains

357
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
like 110 cubic feet.

358
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
So that hole actually

359
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
makes the air come out and go in.

360
0:15:41.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
So where it's happening, we can see,

361
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
but what is happening will remain invisible only.

362
0:15:45.594,000 --> 0:15:48,000
This is from the show called "Invisible," at Talwar Gallery.

363
0:15:48.594,000 --> 0:15:49,000
This is called "Kaayam."

364
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Detail.

365
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And what I'd like to tell you,

366
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
our senses are so limited --

367
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
we cannot hear everything, we cannot see everything.

368
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
We don't feel, "I am touching the air,"

369
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
but if the breeze is a little more faster, then I can feel it.

370
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
So all of our construction of reality

371
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
is through these limited senses.

372
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
So my request was like,

373
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
is there any way to use all this

374
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
as just a symbol or a sign?

375
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
And to really get to the point,

376
0:16:23.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
we should move beyond, you know,

377
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
go to the other side of the wall, like illogic,

378
0:16:27.523,000 --> 0:16:28,000
like are invisible.

379
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Because when we see someone walks, we see the footprint.

380
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:34,000
But if we're just cutting that footprint from the whole thing and trying to analyze it,

381
0:16:34.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
you will miss the point

382
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
because the actual journey happens between those footprints,

383
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
and the footprints are nothing but passing time.

384
0:16:41.57,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Thank you.

385
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
(Applause)

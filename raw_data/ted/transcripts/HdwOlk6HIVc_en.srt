1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
We live in difficult and challenging

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
economic times, of course.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
And one of the first victims

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
of difficult economic times,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I think, is public spending of any kind,

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but certainly in the firing line at the moment

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
is public spending for science,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and particularly curiosity-led science

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and exploration.

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that that's a ridiculous

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and ludicrous thing to do.

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
But I think to set the scene,

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED,

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
but it is a bit of a mess.

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But actually, it's not my fault; it's from the Guardian newspaper.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And it's actually a beautiful demonstration

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:01,000
of how much science costs.

21
0:01:01.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Because, if I'm going to make the case

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration,

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:08,000
I should tell you how much it costs.

24
0:01:08.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
So this is a game called "spot the science budgets."

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This is the U.K. government spend.

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
You see there, it's about 620 billion a year.

27
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
The science budget is actually --

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
if you look to your left, there's a purple set of blobs

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
and then yellow set of blobs.

30
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And it's one of the yellow set of blobs

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
around the big yellow blob.

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
It's about 3.3 billion pounds per year

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
out of 620 billion.

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
That funds everything in the U.K.

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
from medical research, space exploration,

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
where I work, at CERN in Geneva, particle physics,

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
engineering, even arts and humanities,

38
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
funded from the science budget,

39
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
which is that 3.3 billion, that little, tiny yellow blob

40
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
around the orange blob at the top left of the screen.

41
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So that's what we're arguing about.

42
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
That percentage, by the way, is about the same

43
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
in the U.S. and Germany and France.

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
R&D in total in the economy,

45
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
publicly funded, is about

46
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
0.6 percent of GDP.

47
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So that's what we're arguing about.

48
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
The first thing I want to say,

49
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and this is straight from "Wonders of the Solar System,"

50
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe

51
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful.

52
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This is a picture that actually was sent back

53
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
by the Cassini space probe around Saturn,

54
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
after we'd finished filming "Wonders of the Solar System."

55
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
So it isn't in the series.

56
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's of the moon Enceladus.

57
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
So that big sweeping, white

58
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
sphere in the corner is Saturn,

59
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
which is actually in the background of the picture.

60
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus,

61
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
which is about as big as the British Isles.

62
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
It's about 500 kilometers in diameter.

63
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So, tiny moon.

64
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
What's fascinating and beautiful ...

65
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
this an unprocessed picture, by the way, I should say,

66
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
it's black and white, straight from Saturnian orbit.

67
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
What's beautiful is, you can probably see on the limb there

68
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
some faint, sort of,

69
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
wisps of almost smoke

70
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
rising up from the limb.

71
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
This is how we visualize that in "Wonders of the Solar System."

72
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
It's a beautiful graphic.

73
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
What we found out were that those faint wisps

74
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
are actually fountains of ice

75
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
rising up from the surface of this tiny moon.

76
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
That's fascinating and beautiful in itself,

77
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
but we think that the mechanism

78
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
for powering those fountains

79
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
requires there to be lakes of liquid water

80
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
beneath the surface of this moon.

81
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And what's important about that

82
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
is that, on our planet, on Earth,

83
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
wherever we find liquid water,

84
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
we find life.

85
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So, to find strong evidence

86
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
of liquid, pools of liquid, beneath the surface of a moon

87
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
750 million miles away from the Earth

88
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
is really quite astounding.

89
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So what we're saying, essentially,

90
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
is maybe that's a habitat for life in the solar system.

91
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Well, let me just say, that was a graphic. I just want to show this picture.

92
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
That's one more picture of Enceladus.

93
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus.

94
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
So it made a very low pass,

95
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
just a few hundred kilometers above the surface.

96
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And so this, again, a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space,

97
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
absolutely beautiful.

98
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But that's not the prime candidate for life in the solar system.

99
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
That's probably this place,

100
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
which is a moon of Jupiter, Europa.

101
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And again, we had to fly to the Jovian system

102
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to get any sense that this moon, as most moons,

103
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
was anything other than a dead ball of rock.

104
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
It's actually an ice moon.

105
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So what you're looking at is the surface of the moon Europa,

106
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
which is a thick sheet of ice, probably a hundred kilometers thick.

107
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
But by measuring the way that

108
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Europa interacts

109
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
with the magnetic field of Jupiter,

110
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and looking at how those cracks in the ice

111
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
that you can see there on that graphic move around,

112
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
we've inferred very strongly

113
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
that there's an ocean of liquid surrounding

114
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the entire surface of Europa.

115
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
So below the ice, there's an ocean of liquid around the whole moon.

116
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep, we think.

117
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
We think it's saltwater, and that would mean that

118
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
there's more water on that moon of Jupiter

119
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined.

120
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
So that place, a little moon around Jupiter,

121
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
is probably the prime candidate

122
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
for finding life on a moon

123
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
or a body outside the Earth, that we know of.

124
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Tremendous and beautiful discovery.

125
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Our exploration of the solar system

126
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
has taught us that the solar system is beautiful.

127
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It may also have pointed the way to answering

128
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask,

129
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
which is: "Are we alone in the universe?"

130
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Is there any other use to exploration and science,

131
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
other than just a sense of wonder?

132
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Well, there is.

133
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
This is a very famous picture

134
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
taken, actually, on my first Christmas Eve,

135
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
December 24th, 1968,

136
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
when I was about eight months old.

137
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It was taken by Apollo 8

138
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
as it went around the back of the moon.

139
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Earthrise from Apollo 8.

140
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
A famous picture; many people have said that it's the picture

141
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that saved 1968,

142
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
which was a turbulent year --

143
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
the student riots in Paris,

144
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
the height of the Vietnam War.

145
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
The reason many people think that about this picture,

146
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
and Al Gore has said it many times, actually, on the stage at TED,

147
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
is that this picture, arguably, was

148
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
the beginning of the environmental movement.

149
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Because, for the first time,

150
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
we saw our world,

151
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
not as a solid, immovable,

152
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
kind of indestructible place,

153
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
but as a very small, fragile-looking world

154
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
just hanging against the blackness of space.

155
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
What's also not often said

156
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
about the space exploration, about the Apollo program,

157
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:26,000
is the economic contribution it made.

158
0:06:26.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful

159
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and a tremendous achievement

160
0:06:31.26,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and delivered pictures like this,

161
0:06:33.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
it cost a lot, didn't it?

162
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Well, actually, many studies have been done

163
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
about the economic effectiveness,

164
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
the economic impact of Apollo.

165
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics.

166
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And it showed that for every $1 spent on Apollo,

167
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
14 came back into the U.S. economy.

168
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So the Apollo program paid for itself

169
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in inspiration,

170
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
in engineering, achievement

171
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and, I think, in inspiring young scientists and engineers

172
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
14 times over.

173
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
So exploration can pay for itself.

174
0:07:03.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
What about scientific discovery?

175
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
What about driving innovation?

176
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Well, this looks like a picture of virtually nothing.

177
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
What it is, is a picture of the spectrum

178
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
of hydrogen.

179
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
See, back in the 1880s, 1890s,

180
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
many scientists, many observers,

181
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
looked at the light given off from atoms.

182
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And they saw strange pictures like this.

183
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
What you're seeing when you put it through a prism

184
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn't just glow

185
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
like a white light,

186
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
it just emits light at particular colors,

187
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
a red one, a light blue one, some dark blue ones.

188
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure

189
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because the way that's explained

190
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
is atoms are a single nucleus

191
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
with electrons going around them.

192
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And the electrons can only be in particular places.

193
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And when they jump up to the next place they can be,

194
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and fall back down again,

195
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
they emit light at particular colors.

196
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And so the fact that atoms, when you heat them up,

197
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
only emit light at very specific colors,

198
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
was one of the key drivers

199
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that led to the development of the quantum theory,

200
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
the theory of the structure of atoms.

201
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable.

202
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun.

203
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And now, this is a picture of atoms in the Sun's atmosphere

204
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
absorbing light.

205
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And again, they only absorb light at particular colors

206
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
when electrons jump up and fall down,

207
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
jump up and fall down.

208
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum.

209
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And the element helium

210
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun

211
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
because some of those black lines were found

212
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that corresponded to no known element.

213
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And that's why helium's called helium.

214
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
It's called "helios" -- helios from the Sun.

215
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
Now, that sounds esoteric,

216
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit,

217
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
but the quantum theory quickly led

218
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials

219
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
like silicon, for example.

220
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
The way that silicon behaves,

221
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
the fact that you can build transistors,

222
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
is a purely quantum phenomenon.

223
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
So without that curiosity-driven

224
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
understanding of the structure of atoms,

225
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
which led to this rather esoteric theory, quantum mechanics,

226
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
then we wouldn't have transistors, we wouldn't have silicon chips,

227
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
we wouldn't have pretty much the basis

228
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
of our modern economy.

229
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
There's one more, I think, wonderful twist to that tale.

230
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
In "Wonders of the Solar System,"

231
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal.

232
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
It's one of the most incredible things about the physics

233
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth,

234
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
is you can transport it, not only to the planets,

235
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but to the most distant stars and galaxies.

236
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And one of the astonishing predictions

237
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
of quantum mechanics,

238
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
just by looking at the structure of atoms --

239
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
the same theory that describes transistors --

240
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is that there can be no stars in the universe

241
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that have reached the end of their life

242
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that are bigger than, quite specifically, 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.

243
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
That's a limit imposed on the mass of stars.

244
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory,

245
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
get a telescope, swing it to the sky,

246
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
and you find that there are no dead stars

247
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun.

248
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
That's quite an incredible prediction.

249
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
What happens when you have a star that's right on the edge of that mass?

250
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Well, this is a picture of it.

251
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
This is the picture of a galaxy, a common "our garden" galaxy

252
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
with, what, 100 billion

253
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
stars like our Sun in it.

254
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
It's just one of billions of galaxies in the universe.

255
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
There are a billion stars in the galactic core,

256
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
which is why it's shining out so brightly.

257
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
This is about 50 million light years away,

258
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
so one of our neighboring galaxies.

259
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
But that bright star there

260
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
is actually one of the stars in the galaxy.

261
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
So that star is also

262
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
50 million light years away.

263
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
It's part of that galaxy, and it's shining as brightly

264
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
as the center of the galaxy

265
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
with a billion suns in it.

266
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
That's a Type Ia supernova explosion.

267
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Now that's an incredible phenomena,

268
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
because it's a star that sits there.

269
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
It's called a carbon-oxygen dwarf.

270
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
It sits there about, say, 1.3 times the mass of the Sun.

271
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
And it has a binary companion that goes around it,

272
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
so a big star, a big ball of gas.

273
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And what it does is it sucks gas

274
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
off its companion star,

275
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit,

276
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and then it explodes.

277
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And it explodes, and it shines as brightly

278
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
as a billion suns for about two weeks,

279
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and releases, not only energy,

280
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe.

281
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
In fact, that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf.

282
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
Now, there was no carbon and oxygen

283
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
in the universe at the Big Bang.

284
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe

285
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
throughout the first generation of stars.

286
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
It was made in stars like that,

287
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
locked away and then returned to the universe

288
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
in explosions like that

289
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
in order to recondense into planets,

290
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
stars, new solar systems

291
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and, indeed, people like us.

292
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
I think that's a remarkable demonstration of the power

293
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and beauty and universality of the laws of physics,

294
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
because we understand that process,

295
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
because we understand

296
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
the structure of atoms here on Earth.

297
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
This is a beautiful quote that I found --

298
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
we're talking about serendipity there -- from Alexander Fleming:

299
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:05,000
"When I woke up just after dawn

300
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
on September 28, 1928,

301
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
I certainly didn't plan to revolutionize all medicine

302
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:12,000
by discovering the world's first antibiotic."

303
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
Now, the explorers of the world of the atom

304
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
did not intend to invent the transistor.

305
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And they certainly didn't intend to

306
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
describe the mechanics of supernova explosions,

307
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:23,000
which eventually told us where

308
0:12:23.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
the building blocks of life

309
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
were synthesized in the universe.

310
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So, I think science can be --

311
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
serendipity is important.

312
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
It can be beautiful. It can reveal quite astonishing things.

313
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
It can also, I think, finally

314
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
reveal the most profound

315
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
ideas to us

316
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
about our place in the universe

317
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and really the value of our home planet.

318
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet.

319
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Now, it doesn't look like our home planet.

320
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:54,000
It looks like Saturn because, of course, it is.

321
0:12:54.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It was taken by the Cassini space probe.

322
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
But it's a famous picture, not because of

323
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
the beauty and majesty of Saturn's rings,

324
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
but actually because of a tiny, faint blob

325
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
just hanging underneath one of the rings.

326
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:08,000
And if I blow it up there, you see it.

327
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:1,000
It looks like a moon,

328
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
but in fact, it's a picture of Earth.

329
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:15,000
It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn.

330
0:13:15.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
That's our planet from 750 million miles away.

331
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
I think the Earth has got a strange property

332
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
that the farther away you get from it,

333
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the more beautiful it seems.

334
0:13:25.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
But that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet.

335
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
It was taken by this thing, which is called the Voyager spacecraft.

336
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
And that's a picture of me in front of it for scale.

337
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
The Voyager is a tiny machine.

338
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
It's currently 10 billion miles away from Earth,

339
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
transmitting with that dish, with the power of 20 watts,

340
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and we're still in contact with it.

341
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
But it visited Jupiter, Saturn,

342
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
Uranus and Neptune.

343
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And after it visited all four of those planets,

344
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Carl Sagan, who's one of my great heroes,

345
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:56,000
had the wonderful idea

346
0:13:56.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
of turning Voyager around

347
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
and taking a picture of every planet it had visited.

348
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And it took this picture of Earth.

349
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
Now it's very hard to see the Earth there, it's called the "Pale Blue Dot" picture,

350
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light.

351
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
That's Earth from four billion miles away.

352
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
And I'd like to read you what

353
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Sagan wrote about it, just to finish,

354
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
because I cannot say words as beautiful as this

355
0:14:18.26,000 --> 0:14:2,000
to describe what he saw

356
0:14:20.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
in that picture that he had taken.

357
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
He said, "Consider again that dot.

358
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
That's here. That's home. That's us.

359
0:14:27.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
On it, everyone you love,

360
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
everyone you know, everyone you've ever heard of,

361
0:14:32.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
every human being who ever was

362
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
lived out their lives.

363
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
The aggregates of joy and suffering

364
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
thousands of confident religions,

365
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
ideologies and economic doctrines,

366
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
every hunter and forager, every hero and coward,

367
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
every creator and destroyer of civilization,

368
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
every king and peasant, every young couple in love,

369
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
every mother and father, hopeful child,

370
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
inventor and explorer,

371
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician,

372
0:14:59.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
every superstar, every supreme leader,

373
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
every saint and sinner in the history of our species,

374
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
lived there, on a mote of dust,

375
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
suspended in a sunbeam.

376
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
It's been said that astronomy's a humbling

377
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and character-building experience.

378
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:15,000
There is perhaps no better demonstration

379
0:15:15.26,000 --> 0:15:17,000
of the folly of human conceits

380
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
than this distant image of our tiny world.

381
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
To me, it underscores our responsibility

382
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:24,000
to deal more kindly with one another

383
0:15:24.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot,

384
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
the only home we've ever known."

385
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
Beautiful words about

386
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:33,000
the power of science and exploration.

387
0:15:33.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
The argument has always been made, and it will always be made,

388
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
that we know enough about the universe.

389
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
You could have made it in the 1920s; you wouldn't have had penicillin.

390
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
You could have made it in the 1890s; you wouldn't have the transistor.

391
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And it's made today in these difficult economic times.

392
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Surely, we know enough.

393
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
We don't need to discover anything else about our universe.

394
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Let me leave the last words to someone

395
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
who's rapidly becoming a hero of mine,

396
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
Humphrey Davy, who did his science at the turn of the 19th century.

397
0:15:57.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
He was clearly under assault all the time.

398
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
"We know enough at the turn of the 19th century.

399
0:16:03.26,000 --> 0:16:05,000
Just exploit it; just build things."

400
0:16:05.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
He said this, he said, "Nothing is more fatal

401
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
to the progress of the human mind

402
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:11,000
than to presume that our views of science

403
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
are ultimate,

404
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
that our triumphs are complete,

405
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
that there are no mysteries in nature,

406
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and that there are no new worlds to conquer."

407
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
Thank you.

408
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.887,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I was born in Den Bosch,

2
0:00:17.523,000 --> 0:00:2,000
where the painter Hieronymus Bosch named himself after.

3
0:00:20.884,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And I've always been very fond of this painter

4
0:00:23.331,000 --> 0:00:25,000
who lived and worked in the 15th century.

5
0:00:25.84,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And what is interesting about him in relation to morality

6
0:00:28.56,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is that he lived at a time where religion's influence was waning,

7
0:00:31.639,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and he was sort of wondering, I think,

8
0:00:33.48,000 --> 0:00:35,000
what would happen with society if there was no religion

9
0:00:36.094,000 --> 0:00:37,000
or if there was less religion.

10
0:00:37.578,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And so he painted this famous painting, "The Garden of Earthly Delights,"

11
0:00:41.056,000 --> 0:00:44,000
which some have interpreted as being humanity before the Fall,

12
0:00:44.939,000 --> 0:00:47,000
or being humanity without any Fall at all.

13
0:00:48.201,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And so it makes you wonder,

14
0:00:49.513,000 --> 0:00:52,000
what would happen if we hadn't tasted the fruit of knowledge, so to speak,

15
0:00:53.036,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and what kind of morality would we have.

16
0:00:56.549,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Much later, as a student, I went to a very different garden,

17
0:00:59.583,000 --> 0:01:03,000
a zoological garden in Arnhem where we keep chimpanzees.

18
0:01:04.275,000 --> 0:01:07,000
This is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee.

19
0:01:07.425,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Laughter)

20
0:01:10.134,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And I discovered there

21
0:01:11.877,000 --> 0:01:14,000
that the chimpanzees are very power-hungry and wrote a book about it.

22
0:01:15.157,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And at that time the focus in a lot of animal research

23
0:01:17.708,000 --> 0:01:19,000
was on aggression and competition.

24
0:01:20.159,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I painted a whole picture of the animal kingdom

25
0:01:22.44,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and humanity included, was that deep down we are competitors, we are aggressive,

26
0:01:27.662,000 --> 0:01:3,000
we are all out for our own profit, basically.

27
0:01:30.739,000 --> 0:01:31,000
This is the launch of my book.

28
0:01:32.635,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I'm not sure how well the chimpanzees read it,

29
0:01:35.043,000 --> 0:01:37,000
but they surely seemed interested in the book.

30
0:01:37.738,000 --> 0:01:39,000
(Laughter)

31
0:01:39.967,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now in the process of doing all this work

32
0:01:42.902,000 --> 0:01:44,000
on power and dominance and aggression and so on,

33
0:01:45.826,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I discovered that chimpanzees reconcile after fights.

34
0:01:49.033,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And so what you see here is two males who have had a fight.

35
0:01:51.843,000 --> 0:01:54,000
They ended up in a tree, and one of them holds out a hand to the other.

36
0:01:55.211,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And about a second after I took the picture,

37
0:01:57.305,000 --> 0:01:59,000
they came together in the fork of the tree

38
0:01:59.39,000 --> 0:02:,000
and kissed and embraced each other.

39
0:02:01.13,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And this is very interesting

40
0:02:02.498,000 --> 0:02:05,000
because at the time, everything was about competition and aggression,

41
0:02:05.819,000 --> 0:02:06,000
so it wouldn't make any sense.

42
0:02:07.337,000 --> 0:02:09,000
The only thing that matters is that you win or you lose.

43
0:02:09.997,000 --> 0:02:11,000
But why reconcile after a fight? That doesn't make any sense.

44
0:02:12.958,000 --> 0:02:14,000
This is the way bonobos do it. Bonobos do everything with sex.

45
0:02:15.98,000 --> 0:02:16,000
And so they also reconcile with sex.

46
0:02:17.818,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But the principle is exactly the same.

47
0:02:19.768,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The principle is that you have a valuable relationship

48
0:02:23.767,000 --> 0:02:27,000
that is damaged by conflict, so you need to do something about it.

49
0:02:27.881,000 --> 0:02:31,000
So my whole picture of the animal kingdom, and including humans also,

50
0:02:32.272,000 --> 0:02:33,000
started to change at that time.

51
0:02:34.235,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So we have this image in political science, economics, the humanities,

52
0:02:38.238,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the philosophy for that matter, that man is a wolf to man.

53
0:02:42.12,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And so deep down, our nature is actually nasty.

54
0:02:45.233,000 --> 0:02:47,000
I think it's a very unfair image for the wolf.

55
0:02:48.175,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The wolf is, after all, a very cooperative animal.

56
0:02:51.645,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And that's why many of you have a dog at home,

57
0:02:53.923,000 --> 0:02:55,000
which has all these characteristics also.

58
0:02:56.166,000 --> 0:02:57,000
And it's really unfair to humanity,

59
0:02:57.985,000 --> 0:03:,000
because humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic

60
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
than given credit for.

61
0:03:03.471,000 --> 0:03:05,000
So I started getting interested in those issues

62
0:03:05.755,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and studying that in other animals.

63
0:03:08.09,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So these are the pillars of morality.

64
0:03:09.968,000 --> 0:03:12,000
If you ask anyone, "What is morality based on?"

65
0:03:13.544,000 --> 0:03:15,000
these are the two factors that always come out.

66
0:03:15.763,000 --> 0:03:16,000
One is reciprocity,

67
0:03:17.494,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness.

68
0:03:21.073,000 --> 0:03:23,000
And the other one is empathy and compassion.

69
0:03:23.29,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And human morality is more than this, but if you would remove these two pillars,

70
0:03:27.565,000 --> 0:03:29,000
there would be not much remaining, I think.

71
0:03:29.718,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So they're absolutely essential.

72
0:03:31.397,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So let me give you a few examples here.

73
0:03:33.289,000 --> 0:03:35,000
This is a very old video from the Yerkes Primate Center,

74
0:03:36.013,000 --> 0:03:38,000
where they trained chimpanzees to cooperate.

75
0:03:39.005,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So this is already about a hundred years ago

76
0:03:41.475,000 --> 0:03:44,000
that we were doing experiments on cooperation.

77
0:03:44.591,000 --> 0:03:47,000
What you have here is two young chimpanzees who have a box,

78
0:03:48.147,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and the box is too heavy for one chimp to pull in.

79
0:03:51.176,000 --> 0:03:52,000
And of course, there's food on the box.

80
0:03:53.059,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Otherwise they wouldn't be pulling so hard.

81
0:03:55.084,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And so they're bringing in the box.

82
0:03:57.221,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And you can see that they're synchronized.

83
0:03:59.514,000 --> 0:04:02,000
You can see that they work together, they pull at the same moment.

84
0:04:02.638,000 --> 0:04:04,000
It's already a big advance over many other animals

85
0:04:05.175,000 --> 0:04:06,000
who wouldn't be able to do that.

86
0:04:06.837,000 --> 0:04:08,000
Now you're going to get a more interesting picture,

87
0:04:09.247,000 --> 0:04:11,000
because now one of the two chimps has been fed.

88
0:04:11.897,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore.

89
0:04:17.168,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Laughter)

90
0:04:24.023,000 --> 0:04:28,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:35.054,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

92
0:04:38.64,000 --> 0:04:42,000
[- and sometimes appears to convey its wishes and meanings by gestures.]

93
0:04:51.02,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Now look at what happens at the very end of this.

94
0:04:56.64,000 --> 0:04:58,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:07.767,000 --> 0:05:08,000
He takes basically everything.

96
0:05:09.68,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Laughter)

97
0:05:12.68,000 --> 0:05:14,000
There are two interesting parts about this.

98
0:05:14.72,000 --> 0:05:15,000
One is that the chimp on the right

99
0:05:16.386,000 --> 0:05:18,000
has a full understanding he needs the partner --

100
0:05:18.702,000 --> 0:05:2,000
so a full understanding of the need for cooperation.

101
0:05:21.161,000 --> 0:05:23,000
The second one is that the partner is willing to work

102
0:05:23.674,000 --> 0:05:25,000
even though he's not interested in the food.

103
0:05:25.82,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Why would that be?

104
0:05:27.047,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Well, that probably has to do with reciprocity.

105
0:05:29.262,000 --> 0:05:32,000
There's actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals

106
0:05:32.29,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that they return favors.

107
0:05:33.836,000 --> 0:05:35,000
He will get a return favor at some point in the future.

108
0:05:36.548,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And so that's how this all operates.

109
0:05:39.506,000 --> 0:05:4,000
We do the same task with elephants.

110
0:05:41.219,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Now, it's very dangerous to work with elephants.

111
0:05:44.397,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Another problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus

112
0:05:47.578,000 --> 0:05:48,000
that is too heavy for a single elephant.

113
0:05:49.519,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Now you can probably make it,

114
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but it's going to be a pretty clumsy apparatus, I think.

115
0:05:54.045,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And so what we did in that case --

116
0:05:55.711,000 --> 0:05:57,000
we do these studies in Thailand for Josh Plotnik --

117
0:05:58.397,000 --> 0:06:01,000
is we have an apparatus around which there is a rope, a single rope.

118
0:06:02.354,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And if you pull on this side of the rope, the rope disappears on the other side.

119
0:06:06.141,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So two elephants need to pick it up at exactly the same time, and pull.

120
0:06:09.552,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears.

121
0:06:12.623,000 --> 0:06:14,000
The first tape you're going to see

122
0:06:14.855,000 --> 0:06:17,000
is two elephants who are released together arrive at the apparatus.

123
0:06:18.868,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The apparatus is on the left, with food on it.

124
0:06:22.096,000 --> 0:06:25,000
And so they come together, they arrive together,

125
0:06:25.142,000 --> 0:06:27,000
they pick it up together, and they pull together.

126
0:06:27.459,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So it's actually fairly simple for them.

127
0:06:31.545,000 --> 0:06:32,000
There they are.

128
0:06:40.466,000 --> 0:06:41,000
So that's how they bring it in.

129
0:06:42.048,000 --> 0:06:44,000
But now we're going to make it more difficult.

130
0:06:44.229,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Because the purpose of this experiment

131
0:06:46.073,000 --> 0:06:48,000
is to see how well they understand cooperation.

132
0:06:48.289,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Do they understand that as well as the chimps, for example?

133
0:06:51.151,000 --> 0:06:54,000
What we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other

134
0:06:54.653,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and that elephant needs to be smart enough

135
0:06:56.688,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope --

136
0:06:59.184,000 --> 0:07:02,000
because if he pulls at the rope, it disappears and the whole test is over.

137
0:07:02.689,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Now this elephant does something illegal that we did not teach it.

138
0:07:05.983,000 --> 0:07:07,000
But it shows the understanding he has,

139
0:07:08.173,000 --> 0:07:1,000
because he puts his big foot on the rope,

140
0:07:10.721,000 --> 0:07:12,000
stands on the rope and waits there for the other,

141
0:07:13.063,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and then the other is going to do all the work for him.

142
0:07:15.67,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So it's what we call freeloading.

143
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
(Laughter)

144
0:07:21.299,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But it shows the intelligence that the elephants have.

145
0:07:24.139,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They developed several of these alternative techniques

146
0:07:26.736,000 --> 0:07:27,000
that we did not approve of, necessarily.

147
0:07:28.718,000 --> 0:07:29,000
(Laughter)

148
0:07:29.965,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So the other elephant is now coming ...

149
0:07:35.006,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and is going to pull it in.

150
0:07:54.598,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Now look at the other; it doesn't forget to eat, of course.

151
0:07:57.74,000 --> 0:07:59,000
(Laughter)

152
0:08:00.937,000 --> 0:08:02,000
This was the cooperation and reciprocity part.

153
0:08:03.178,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Now something on empathy.

154
0:08:04.421,000 --> 0:08:06,000
Empathy is my main topic at the moment, of research.

155
0:08:06.949,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And empathy has two qualities:

156
0:08:08.421,000 --> 0:08:1,000
One is the understanding part of it.

157
0:08:10.464,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This is just a regular definition:

158
0:08:12.119,000 --> 0:08:14,000
the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.

159
0:08:14.955,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And the emotional part.

160
0:08:16.188,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Empathy has basically two channels: One is the body channel,

161
0:08:19.623,000 --> 0:08:2,000
If you talk with a sad person,

162
0:08:21.505,000 --> 0:08:24,000
you're going to adopt a sad expression and a sad posture,

163
0:08:24.782,000 --> 0:08:25,000
and before you know it, you feel sad.

164
0:08:26.568,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And that's sort of the body channel of emotional empathy,

165
0:08:30.81,000 --> 0:08:31,000
which many animals have.

166
0:08:32.113,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Your average dog has that also.

167
0:08:33.692,000 --> 0:08:35,000
That's why people keep mammals in the home

168
0:08:35.716,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and not turtles or snakes or something like that,

169
0:08:38.047,000 --> 0:08:39,000
who don't have that kind of empathy.

170
0:08:39.86,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And then there's a cognitive channel,

171
0:08:41.656,000 --> 0:08:44,000
which is more that you can take the perspective of somebody else.

172
0:08:44.744,000 --> 0:08:45,000
And that's more limited.

173
0:08:45.926,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Very few animals, I think elephants and apes, can do that kind of thing.

174
0:08:51.771,000 --> 0:08:52,000
So synchronization,

175
0:08:53.157,000 --> 0:08:55,000
which is part of that whole empathy mechanism,

176
0:08:55.324,000 --> 0:08:57,000
is a very old one in the animal kingdom.

177
0:08:57.603,000 --> 0:09:,000
In humans, of course, we can study that with yawn contagion.

178
0:09:00.868,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Humans yawn when others yawn.

179
0:09:02.71,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And it's related to empathy.

180
0:09:04.517,000 --> 0:09:06,000
It activates the same areas in the brain.

181
0:09:06.676,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Also, we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion

182
0:09:09.421,000 --> 0:09:1,000
are highly empathic.

183
0:09:10.598,000 --> 0:09:13,000
People who have problems with empathy, such as autistic children,

184
0:09:13.797,000 --> 0:09:14,000
they don't have yawn contagion.

185
0:09:15.313,000 --> 0:09:16,000
So it is connected.

186
0:09:16.492,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head.

187
0:09:20.239,000 --> 0:09:23,000
So that's what you see on the upper-left, an animated head that yawns.

188
0:09:24.254,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And there's a chimpanzee watching,

189
0:09:25.898,000 --> 0:09:27,000
an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen

190
0:09:28.364,000 --> 0:09:29,000
on which we play these animations.

191
0:09:36.591,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Laughter)

192
0:09:38.296,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So yawn contagion that you're probably all familiar with --

193
0:09:41.696,000 --> 0:09:43,000
and maybe you're going to start yawning soon now --

194
0:09:44.399,000 --> 0:09:47,000
is something that we share with other animals.

195
0:09:47.639,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And that's related to that whole body channel of synchronization

196
0:09:50.664,000 --> 0:09:51,000
that underlies empathy,

197
0:09:52.408,000 --> 0:09:55,000
and that is universal in the mammals, basically.

198
0:09:55.535,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We also study more complex expressions -- This is consolation.

199
0:09:58.67,000 --> 0:10:01,000
This is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he's screaming,

200
0:10:01.794,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him

201
0:10:04.529,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and calms him down.

202
0:10:05.718,000 --> 0:10:06,000
That's consolation.

203
0:10:06.916,000 --> 0:10:07,000
It's very similar to human consolation.

204
0:10:08.804,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And consolation behavior --

205
0:10:10.987,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:12.161,000 --> 0:10:13,000
it's empathy driven.

207
0:10:13.87,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Actually, the way to study empathy in human children

208
0:10:16.711,000 --> 0:10:18,000
is to instruct a family member to act distressed,

209
0:10:19.309,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and then to see what young children do.

210
0:10:21.296,000 --> 0:10:23,000
And so it is related to empathy,

211
0:10:23.334,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and that's the kind of expressions we look at.

212
0:10:25.591,000 --> 0:10:28,000
We also recently published an experiment you may have heard about.

213
0:10:28.713,000 --> 0:10:29,000
It's on altruism and chimpanzees,

214
0:10:30.72,000 --> 0:10:34,000
where the question is: Do chimpanzees care about the welfare of somebody else?

215
0:10:35.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And for decades it had been assumed that only humans can do that,

216
0:10:39.635,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that only humans worry about the welfare of somebody else.

217
0:10:42.918,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Now we did a very simple experiment.

218
0:10:45.379,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We do that on chimpanzees that live in Lawrenceville,

219
0:10:48.03,000 --> 0:10:49,000
in the field station of Yerkes.

220
0:10:49.796,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And so that's how they live.

221
0:10:51.157,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And we call them into a room and do experiments with them.

222
0:10:54.391,000 --> 0:10:56,000
In this case, we put two chimpanzees side-by-side,

223
0:10:56.752,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and one has a bucket full of tokens, and the tokens have different meanings.

224
0:11:00.353,000 --> 0:11:02,000
One kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses,

225
0:11:02.95,000 --> 0:11:03,000
the other one feeds both of them.

226
0:11:04.799,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So this is a study we did with Vicki Horner.

227
0:11:08.816,000 --> 0:11:1,000
And here, you have the two color tokens.

228
0:11:11.109,000 --> 0:11:12,000
So they have a whole bucket full of them.

229
0:11:13.092,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And they have to pick one of the two colors.

230
0:11:16.413,000 --> 0:11:17,000
You will see how that goes.

231
0:11:19.101,000 --> 0:11:21,000
So if this chimp makes the selfish choice,

232
0:11:22.433,000 --> 0:11:24,000
which is the red token in this case,

233
0:11:25.118,000 --> 0:11:26,000
he needs to give it to us,

234
0:11:26.772,000 --> 0:11:29,000
we pick it up, we put it on a table where there's two food rewards,

235
0:11:30.133,000 --> 0:11:32,000
but in this case, only the one on the right gets food.

236
0:11:32.692,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The one on the left walks away because she knows already

237
0:11:35.497,000 --> 0:11:37,000
that this is not a good test for her.

238
0:11:37.591,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Then the next one is the pro-social token.

239
0:11:40.3,000 --> 0:11:43,000
So the one who makes the choices -- that's the interesting part here --

240
0:11:43.668,000 --> 0:11:45,000
for the one who makes the choices, it doesn't really matter.

241
0:11:46.512,000 --> 0:11:48,000
So she gives us now a pro-social token and both chimps get fed.

242
0:11:49.509,000 --> 0:11:51,000
So the one who makes the choices always gets a reward.

243
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
So it doesn't matter whatsoever.

244
0:11:53.862,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And she should actually be choosing blindly.

245
0:11:57.182,000 --> 0:12:,000
But what we find is that they prefer the pro-social token.

246
0:12:00.565,000 --> 0:12:02,000
So this is the 50 percent line, that's the random expectation.

247
0:12:03.583,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And especially if the partner draws attention to itself, they choose more.

248
0:12:07.556,000 --> 0:12:09,000
And if the partner puts pressure on them --

249
0:12:09.588,000 --> 0:12:12,000
so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them --

250
0:12:12.751,000 --> 0:12:13,000
then the choices go down.

251
0:12:14.303,000 --> 0:12:15,000
(Laughter)

252
0:12:15.366,000 --> 0:12:16,000
It's as if they're saying,

253
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
"If you're not behaving, I'm not going to be pro-social today."

254
0:12:20.271,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And this is what happens without a partner,

255
0:12:22.299,000 --> 0:12:23,000
when there's no partner sitting there.

256
0:12:24.137,000 --> 0:12:27,000
So we found that the chimpanzees do care about the well-being of somebody else --

257
0:12:27.98,000 --> 0:12:29,000
especially, these are other members of their own group.

258
0:12:31.435,000 --> 0:12:33,000
So the final experiment that I want to mention to you

259
0:12:34.228,000 --> 0:12:35,000
is our fairness study.

260
0:12:35.899,000 --> 0:12:37,000
And so this became a very famous study.

261
0:12:38.813,000 --> 0:12:39,000
And there are now many more,

262
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:42,000
because after we did this about 10 years ago,

263
0:12:42.427,000 --> 0:12:43,000
it became very well-known.

264
0:12:44.784,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And we did that originally with Capuchin monkeys.

265
0:12:47.101,000 --> 0:12:49,000
And I'm going to show you the first experiment that we did.

266
0:12:49.915,000 --> 0:12:51,000
It has now been done with dogs and with birds

267
0:12:52.751,000 --> 0:12:53,000
and with chimpanzees.

268
0:12:54.805,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But with Sarah Brosnan, we started out with Capuchin monkeys.

269
0:12:59.578,000 --> 0:13:02,000
So what we did is we put two Capuchin monkeys side-by-side.

270
0:13:02.807,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Again, these animals, live in a group, they know each other.

271
0:13:05.66,000 --> 0:13:07,000
We take them out of the group, put them in a test chamber.

272
0:13:09.055,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And there's a very simple task that they need to do.

273
0:13:11.625,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And if you give both of them cucumber for the task,

274
0:13:15.029,000 --> 0:13:16,000
the two monkeys side-by-side,

275
0:13:16.483,000 --> 0:13:18,000
they're perfectly willing to do this 25 times in a row.

276
0:13:19.337,000 --> 0:13:22,000
So cucumber, even though it's only really water in my opinion,

277
0:13:22.808,000 --> 0:13:25,000
but cucumber is perfectly fine for them.

278
0:13:26.07,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Now if you give the partner grapes --

279
0:13:28.377,000 --> 0:13:3,000
the food preferences of my Capuchin monkeys

280
0:13:30.548,000 --> 0:13:33,000
correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket --

281
0:13:33.612,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and so if you give them grapes -- it's a far better food --

282
0:13:37.041,000 --> 0:13:39,000
then you create inequity between them.

283
0:13:39.962,000 --> 0:13:4,000
So that's the experiment we did.

284
0:13:41.832,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Recently, we videotaped it with new monkeys

285
0:13:43.937,000 --> 0:13:44,000
who'd never done the task,

286
0:13:45.298,000 --> 0:13:47,000
thinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction,

287
0:13:47.954,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and that turned out to be right.

288
0:13:49.517,000 --> 0:13:51,000
The one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber.

289
0:13:52.037,000 --> 0:13:54,000
The one on the right is the one who gets grapes.

290
0:13:54.32,000 --> 0:13:55,000
The one who gets cucumber --

291
0:13:55.691,000 --> 0:13:57,000
note that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine.

292
0:13:58.511,000 --> 0:13:59,000
The first piece she eats.

293
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Then she sees the other one getting grape, and you will see what happens.

294
0:14:04.554,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So she gives a rock to us. That's the task.

295
0:14:07.157,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it.

296
0:14:10.239,000 --> 0:14:11,000
The other one needs to give a rock to us.

297
0:14:13.448,000 --> 0:14:14,000
And that's what she does.

298
0:14:15.847,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And she gets a grape ...

299
0:14:18.839,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and eats it.

300
0:14:20.026,000 --> 0:14:21,000
The other one sees that.

301
0:14:21.245,000 --> 0:14:22,000
She gives a rock to us now,

302
0:14:22.585,000 --> 0:14:23,000
gets, again, cucumber.

303
0:14:27.62,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Laughter)

304
0:14:41.001,000 --> 0:14:43,000
(Laughter ends)

305
0:14:43.026,000 --> 0:14:45,000
She tests a rock now against the wall.

306
0:14:46.025,000 --> 0:14:47,000
She needs to give it to us.

307
0:14:48.244,000 --> 0:14:5,000
And she gets cucumber again.

308
0:14:52.603,000 --> 0:14:58,000
(Laughter)

309
0:14:59.711,000 --> 0:15:02,000
So this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here.

310
0:15:02.864,000 --> 0:15:04,000
(Laughter)

311
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
(Applause)

312
0:15:09.537,000 --> 0:15:1,000
I still have two minutes left --

313
0:15:11.347,000 --> 0:15:12,000
let me tell you a funny story about this.

314
0:15:13.521,000 --> 0:15:16,000
This study became very famous and we got a lot of comments,

315
0:15:17.155,000 --> 0:15:2,000
especially anthropologists, economists, philosophers.

316
0:15:20.785,000 --> 0:15:21,000
They didn't like this at all.

317
0:15:22.217,000 --> 0:15:24,000
Because they had decided in their minds, I believe,

318
0:15:24.803,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that fairness is a very complex issue, and that animals cannot have it.

319
0:15:29.472,000 --> 0:15:31,000
And so one philosopher even wrote us

320
0:15:31.959,000 --> 0:15:33,000
that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness

321
0:15:34.757,000 --> 0:15:36,000
because fairness was invented during the French Revolution.

322
0:15:37.562,000 --> 0:15:39,000
(Laughter)

323
0:15:40.003,000 --> 0:15:42,000
And another one wrote a whole chapter

324
0:15:42.709,000 --> 0:15:45,000
saying that he would believe it had something to do with fairness,

325
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
if the one who got grapes would refuse the grapes.

326
0:15:48.681,000 --> 0:15:51,000
Now the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan, who's been doing this with chimpanzees,

327
0:15:52.577,000 --> 0:15:54,000
had a couple of combinations of chimpanzees

328
0:15:54.747,000 --> 0:15:56,000
where, indeed, the one who would get the grape

329
0:15:57.127,000 --> 0:15:59,000
would refuse the grape until the other guy also got a grape.

330
0:16:00.057,000 --> 0:16:02,000
So we're getting very close to the human sense of fairness.

331
0:16:02.848,000 --> 0:16:05,000
And I think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for a while.

332
0:16:06.918,000 --> 0:16:07,000
So let me summarize.

333
0:16:08.852,000 --> 0:16:09,000
I believe there's an evolved morality.

334
0:16:10.688,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I think morality is much more than what I've been talking about,

335
0:16:13.931,000 --> 0:16:15,000
but it would be impossible without these ingredients

336
0:16:16.406,000 --> 0:16:17,000
that we find in other primates,

337
0:16:17.928,000 --> 0:16:18,000
which are empathy and consolation,

338
0:16:19.789,000 --> 0:16:22,000
pro-social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness.

339
0:16:23.519,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And so we work on these particular issues

340
0:16:25.6,000 --> 0:16:28,000
to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up, so to speak,

341
0:16:28.969,000 --> 0:16:3,000
without necessarily god and religion involved,

342
0:16:31.426,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and to see how we can get to an evolved morality.

343
0:16:34.326,000 --> 0:16:35,000
And I thank you for your attention.

344
0:16:36.09,000 --> 0:16:43,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Why do so many people reach success and then fail?

2
0:00:23.33,000 --> 0:00:27,000
One of the big reasons is, we think success is a one-way street.

3
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
So we do everything that leads up to success,

4
0:00:29.33,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but then we get there. We figure we've made it,

5
0:00:31.33,000 --> 0:00:33,000
we sit back in our comfort zone,

6
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and we actually stop doing everything that made us successful.

7
0:00:36.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And it doesn't take long to go downhill.

8
0:00:38.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
And I can tell you this happens,

9
0:00:40.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
because it happened to me.

10
0:00:43.33,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Reaching success, I worked hard, I pushed myself.

11
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:49,000
But then I stopped, because I figured, "Oh, you know, I made it.

12
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I can just sit back and relax."

13
0:00:51.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Reaching success, I always tried to improve and do good work.

14
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
But then I stopped because I figured, "Hey, I'm good enough.

15
0:00:58.33,000 --> 0:01:,000
I don't need to improve any more."

16
0:01:00.33,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Reaching success, I was pretty good at coming up with good ideas.

17
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Because I did all these simple things that led to ideas.

18
0:01:07.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But then I stopped, because I figured I was this hot-shot guy

19
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and I shouldn't have to work at ideas, they should just come like magic.

20
0:01:13.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And the only thing that came was creative block.

21
0:01:15.33,000 --> 0:01:18,000
I couldn't come up with any ideas.

22
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Reaching success, I always focused on clients and projects,

23
0:01:21.33,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and ignored the money. Then all this money started pouring in.

24
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And I got distracted by it.

25
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And suddenly I was on the phone to my stockbroker and my real estate agent,

26
0:01:29.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
when I should have been talking to my clients.

27
0:01:32.33,000 --> 0:01:35,000
And reaching success, I always did what I loved.

28
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:37,000
But then I got into stuff that I didn't love,

29
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:4,000
like management. I am the world's worst manager,

30
0:01:40.33,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but I figured I should be doing it, because I was, after all,

31
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:44,000
the president of the company.

32
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Well, soon a black cloud formed over my head

33
0:01:47.33,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and here I was, outwardly very successful,

34
0:01:49.33,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but inwardly very depressed.

35
0:01:51.33,000 --> 0:01:55,000
But I'm a guy; I knew how to fix it.

36
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I bought a fast car.

37
0:01:57.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
(Laughter)

38
0:02:00.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
It didn't help.

39
0:02:02.33,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I was faster but just as depressed.

40
0:02:04.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
So I went to my doctor. I said, "Doc,

41
0:02:07.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I can buy anything I want. But I'm not happy. I'm depressed.

42
0:02:11.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
It's true what they say, and I didn't believe it until it happened to me.

43
0:02:14.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
But money can't buy happiness."

44
0:02:17.33,000 --> 0:02:2,000
He said, "No. But it can buy Prozac."

45
0:02:20.33,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And he put me on anti-depressants.

46
0:02:22.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
And yeah, the black cloud faded a little bit, but so did all the work,

47
0:02:26.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
because I was just floating along. I couldn't care less if clients ever called.

48
0:02:30.33,000 --> 0:02:33,000
(Laughter)

49
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And clients didn't call.

50
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

51
0:02:36.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Because they could see I was no longer serving them,

52
0:02:38.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I was only serving myself.

53
0:02:40.33,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So they took their money and their projects to others who would serve them better.

54
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Well, it didn't take long for business to drop like a rock.

55
0:02:47.33,000 --> 0:02:51,000
My partner and I, Thom, we had to let all our employees go.

56
0:02:51.33,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It was down to just the two of us, and we were about to go under.

57
0:02:53.33,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And that was great.

58
0:02:55.33,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Because with no employees, there was nobody for me to manage.

59
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:02,000
So I went back to doing the projects I loved.

60
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:06,000
I had fun again, I worked harder and, to cut a long story short,

61
0:03:06.33,000 --> 0:03:09,000
did all the things that took me back up to success.

62
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But it wasn't a quick trip.

63
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
It took seven years.

64
0:03:13.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But in the end, business grew bigger than ever.

65
0:03:16.33,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And when I went back to following these eight principles,

66
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:22,000
the black cloud over my head disappeared altogether.

67
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And I woke up one day and I said,

68
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"I don't need Prozac anymore."

69
0:03:26.33,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And I threw it away and haven't needed it since.

70
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I learned that success isn't a one-way street.

71
0:03:31.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
It doesn't look like this; it really looks more like this.

72
0:03:34.33,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It's a continuous journey.

73
0:03:36.33,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And if we want to avoid "success-to-failure-syndrome,"

74
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:41,000
we just keep following these eight principles,

75
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:44,000
because that is not only how we achieve success,

76
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it's how we sustain it.

77
0:03:46.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So here is to your continued success.

78
0:03:48.33,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Thank you very much.

79
0:03:50.33,000 --> 0:03:52,000
(Applause)

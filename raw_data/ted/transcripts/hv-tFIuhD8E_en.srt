1
0:00:12.962,000 --> 0:00:15,000
It's Christmas Eve, 1968.

2
0:00:17.34,000 --> 0:00:2,000
The Apollo 8 spacecraft has successfully completed

3
0:00:20.78,000 --> 0:00:22,000
its first three orbits around the moon.

4
0:00:24.78,000 --> 0:00:26,000
Launched from Cape Canaveral three days before,

5
0:00:27.5,000 --> 0:00:28,000
this is the first time

6
0:00:29.22,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that humans have ever traveled beyond low Earth orbit.

7
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
On the vessel's fourth pass,

8
0:00:36.3,000 --> 0:00:38,000
the Earth slowly comes into view

9
0:00:39.02,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and reveals itself above the Moon's horizon.

10
0:00:43.5,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Astronaut Bill Anders frantically asks his crewmates where their camera is,

11
0:00:47.46,000 --> 0:00:49,000
grabs the Hasselblad, points it towards the window,

12
0:00:49.9,000 --> 0:00:5,000
presses the shutter,

13
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and takes one of the most important photographs of all time:

14
0:00:56.38,000 --> 0:00:57,000
"Earthrise."

15
0:00:58.54,000 --> 0:01:,000
When the crew was safely home a few days later,

16
0:01:01.22,000 --> 0:01:02,000
they were asked about the mission.

17
0:01:03.78,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Anders famously replied,

18
0:01:06.06,000 --> 0:01:08,000
"We went to the moon,

19
0:01:08.18,000 --> 0:01:11,000
but we actually discovered Earth."

20
0:01:13.3,000 --> 0:01:16,000
What did he and his fellow crewmates feel

21
0:01:17.62,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in this incredible moment?

22
0:01:19.66,000 --> 0:01:21,000
In a study released just this past year,

23
0:01:22.22,000 --> 0:01:25,000
a team of researchers at the University of Pennsylvania

24
0:01:25.3,000 --> 0:01:28,000
examined the testimonies of hundreds of astronauts

25
0:01:28.94,000 --> 0:01:31,000
who had the opportunity to view the Earth from space.

26
0:01:32.22,000 --> 0:01:35,000
Their analysis uncovered three common feelings:

27
0:01:36.02,000 --> 0:01:39,000
first, a greater appreciation for Earth's beauty;

28
0:01:39.82,000 --> 0:01:44,000
second, an increased sense of connection to all other living beings;

29
0:01:44.94,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and third, an unexpected, often overwhelming sense of emotion.

30
0:01:50.98,000 --> 0:01:53,000
The researchers believe that seeing the Earth from a great distance

31
0:01:54.46,000 --> 0:01:57,000
provokes someone to develop new cognitive frameworks

32
0:01:58.42,000 --> 0:01:59,000
to understand what they are seeing.

33
0:02:01.06,000 --> 0:02:03,000
They believe these astronauts were forever changed

34
0:02:04.06,000 --> 0:02:05,000
by this new view,

35
0:02:05.94,000 --> 0:02:06,000
this new perspective,

36
0:02:07.86,000 --> 0:02:09,000
this new visual truth.

37
0:02:11.18,000 --> 0:02:15,000
This feeling is commonly referred to as the "overview effect."

38
0:02:16.94,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Only 558 people have ever been to outer space.

39
0:02:22.019,000 --> 0:02:25,000
558 people had the opportunity

40
0:02:25.18,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to gaze down in awe,

41
0:02:28.34,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to wonder at our planet

42
0:02:30.02,000 --> 0:02:33,000
floating in an infinite sea of darkness.

43
0:02:33.66,000 --> 0:02:35,000
But what if that number were bigger?

44
0:02:36.46,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Three years ago, I set off on my own mission:

45
0:02:39.98,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to see if I could bring this feeling of overwhelming scale and beauty

46
0:02:44.74,000 --> 0:02:45,000
to many more people

47
0:02:46.42,000 --> 0:02:48,000
just by using one small computer

48
0:02:48.5,000 --> 0:02:5,000
in my small New York City apartment.

49
0:02:51.3,000 --> 0:02:55,000
It was then, in 2013, that I launched "Daily Overview."

50
0:02:55.34,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Every day, I have used satellite imagery

51
0:02:58.9,000 --> 0:03:02,000
to create one expansive overhead view of our planet.

52
0:03:03.3,000 --> 0:03:07,000
More than 1,000 of these images have been created thus far,

53
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and more than 600,000 people

54
0:03:10.78,000 --> 0:03:13,000
tune in for this daily dose of perspectives.

55
0:03:13.86,000 --> 0:03:18,000
I create the imagery by curating photos from the massive archive

56
0:03:18.98,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of a satellite company called Digital Globe.

57
0:03:21.9,000 --> 0:03:23,000
They operate a constellation of five satellites,

58
0:03:24.7,000 --> 0:03:26,000
each roughly the size of an ambulance,

59
0:03:27.34,000 --> 0:03:29,000
that is constantly taking pictures of the Earth

60
0:03:29.78,000 --> 0:03:33,000
as they orbit at 28,000 kilometers per hour.

61
0:03:35.1,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Now, what does this mean?

62
0:03:37.42,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Each of these satellites is equipped with a camera

63
0:03:39.82,000 --> 0:03:41,000
that has a focal length of 16 meters,

64
0:03:42.74,000 --> 0:03:45,000
so that's roughly 290 times greater

65
0:03:46.46,000 --> 0:03:5,000
than a DSLR camera equipped with a standard 55 millimeter lens.

66
0:03:51.62,000 --> 0:03:53,000
So if were able to attach one of their satellites

67
0:03:54.1,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to the roof of this theater in Oxford,

68
0:03:57.02,000 --> 0:03:59,000
we could take a picture of a football,

69
0:03:59.82,000 --> 0:04:03,000
clearly, on the pitch at the stadium in Amsterdam.

70
0:04:04.86,000 --> 0:04:06,000
That's 450 kilometers away.

71
0:04:08.38,000 --> 0:04:1,000
That's incredibly powerful technology.

72
0:04:11.34,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And I decided at the beginning of this project

73
0:04:13.86,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that I would use that incredible technology

74
0:04:16.34,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to focus on the places

75
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
where humans have impacted the planet.

76
0:04:21.94,000 --> 0:04:25,000
As a species, we dig and scrape the Earth for resources,

77
0:04:26.34,000 --> 0:04:27,000
we produce energy,

78
0:04:28.5,000 --> 0:04:31,000
we raise animals and cultivate crops for food,

79
0:04:32.7,000 --> 0:04:34,000
we build cities, we move around,

80
0:04:35.18,000 --> 0:04:36,000
we create waste.

81
0:04:36.54,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And in the process of doing all of these things,

82
0:04:39.86,000 --> 0:04:42,000
we shape landscapes and seascapes

83
0:04:42.98,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and cityscapes with increasing control and impunity.

84
0:04:48.46,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So with that in mind,

85
0:04:49.74,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I would like to share a few of my overviews with you now.

86
0:04:53.5,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Here we see cargo ships and oil tankers

87
0:04:57.02,000 --> 0:04:59,000
waiting outside the entry to the port of Singapore.

88
0:05:00.7,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This facility is the second-busiest in the world by terms of total tonnage,

89
0:05:05.66,000 --> 0:05:08,000
accounting for one-fifth of the world's shipping containers

90
0:05:09.06,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and one half of the annual supply

91
0:05:11.54,000 --> 0:05:12,000
of crude oil.

92
0:05:13.62,000 --> 0:05:16,000
If you look closely at this overview, you'll see a lot of little specks.

93
0:05:17.54,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Those are actually cows at a feedlot

94
0:05:20.42,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in Summerfield, Texas, in the United States.

95
0:05:23.9,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So once cows reach a particular weight,

96
0:05:26.14,000 --> 0:05:28,000
roughly 300 kilograms,

97
0:05:28.3,000 --> 0:05:3,000
they are moved here and placed on a specialized diet.

98
0:05:31.78,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Over the next three to four months, the cows gain an additional 180 kilograms

99
0:05:36.94,000 --> 0:05:38,000
before they are shipped off to slaughter.

100
0:05:39.1,000 --> 0:05:42,000
You're also probably wondering about this glowing pool at the top there.

101
0:05:42.54,000 --> 0:05:45,000
That gets its color from a unique combination of manure, chemicals

102
0:05:46.42,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and a particular type of algae that grows in the stagnant water.

103
0:05:50.98,000 --> 0:05:52,000
This is the Mount Whaleback iron ore mine

104
0:05:53.82,000 --> 0:05:56,000
in the Pilbara region of Western Australia,

105
0:05:57.14,000 --> 0:06:,000
a beautiful yet scary scar on the face of the Earth.

106
0:06:00.98,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Of the world's mined iron ore,

107
0:06:03.06,000 --> 0:06:05,000
98 percent is used to make steel

108
0:06:06.02,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and is therefore a major component in the construction of buildings,

109
0:06:09.34,000 --> 0:06:13,000
automobiles or appliances such as your dishwasher or refrigerator.

110
0:06:15.06,000 --> 0:06:17,000
This is a solar concentrator in Seville, Spain.

111
0:06:18.7,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So this facility contains 2,650 mirrors

112
0:06:23.42,000 --> 0:06:28,000
which are arrayed in concentric circles around an 140-meter-tall tower

113
0:06:28.5,000 --> 0:06:29,000
at its center.

114
0:06:30.3,000 --> 0:06:31,000
At the top of the tower,

115
0:06:31.78,000 --> 0:06:33,000
there is a capsule of molten salt

116
0:06:34.02,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that gets heated by the beams of light reflected upwards

117
0:06:37.66,000 --> 0:06:38,000
from the mirrors below.

118
0:06:39.62,000 --> 0:06:42,000
From there, the salt circulates to a storage tank underground,

119
0:06:43.1,000 --> 0:06:44,000
where it produces steam,

120
0:06:44.58,000 --> 0:06:45,000
which spins turbines

121
0:06:46.06,000 --> 0:06:49,000
and generates enough electricity to power 70,000 homes

122
0:06:49.58,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and offsets 30,000 tons of carbon dioxide emissions every year.

123
0:06:55.02,000 --> 0:06:59,000
This overview shows deforestation in Santa Cruz, Bolivia

124
0:06:59.06,000 --> 0:07:02,000
immediately adjacent to untouched tracts of rainforest.

125
0:07:04.032,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Deforestation in the country has primarily been driven

126
0:07:06.58,000 --> 0:07:08,000
by the expansion of mechanized agriculture

127
0:07:09.22,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and cattle ranching,

128
0:07:10.9,000 --> 0:07:13,000
so as the country tries to meet the demand of its growing population

129
0:07:14.14,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and feed them,

130
0:07:15.38,000 --> 0:07:17,000
the sacrificial destruction of its rainforest

131
0:07:17.7,000 --> 0:07:18,000
has taken place to do so.

132
0:07:19.98,000 --> 0:07:23,000
It is estimated that the country lost 4.5 million acres of rainforest

133
0:07:24.98,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in one decade alone

134
0:07:26.46,000 --> 0:07:28,000
from 2000 until 2010.

135
0:07:29.74,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This is the Eixample district in Barcelona, Spain.

136
0:07:33.46,000 --> 0:07:35,000
So the overview perspective can be incredibly helpful

137
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
to help us understand how cities function

138
0:07:38.3,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and how we can devise smarter solutions for urban planning,

139
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and this will become only more relevant

140
0:07:43.42,000 --> 0:07:48,000
as it is expected that 4.9 billion people will live in cities around the world

141
0:07:48.94,000 --> 0:07:49,000
by the year 2030.

142
0:07:51.06,000 --> 0:07:55,000
This area of Barcelona is characterized by its strict grid pattern,

143
0:07:55.3,000 --> 0:07:57,000
apartments with communal courtyards

144
0:07:57.34,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and these octagonal intersections

145
0:07:59.54,000 --> 0:08:02,000
which allow for more sunlight, better ventilation

146
0:08:02.58,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and additional parking at street level.

147
0:08:05.3,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And here we see that grid pattern but under much different circumstances.

148
0:08:10.3,000 --> 0:08:13,000
This is the Dadaab Refugee Camp in northern Kenya,

149
0:08:13.82,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the largest such facility of its kind in the world.

150
0:08:16.78,000 --> 0:08:19,000
To cope with the influx of refugees who are fleeing Somalia,

151
0:08:20.06,000 --> 0:08:21,000
where there is famine and conflict,

152
0:08:21.98,000 --> 0:08:23,000
the UN has built this area gridded out at left

153
0:08:24.5,000 --> 0:08:25,000
called the LFO extension

154
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
to house more and more refugees

155
0:08:27.82,000 --> 0:08:29,000
who are arriving and occupying these white dots,

156
0:08:30.82,000 --> 0:08:31,000
which are actually tents

157
0:08:32.18,000 --> 0:08:34,000
which will slowly fill up the area over time.

158
0:08:35.3,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So if you have one of these overviews,

159
0:08:38.42,000 --> 0:08:39,000
you have a moment in time.

160
0:08:41.1,000 --> 0:08:42,000
If we have two overviews, however,

161
0:08:42.98,000 --> 0:08:44,000
we are able to tell stories about changes in time.

162
0:08:46.58,000 --> 0:08:48,000
I call that feature of the project "Juxtapose,"

163
0:08:48.94,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and we'll share a few examples of it with you now.

164
0:08:52.06,000 --> 0:08:56,000
So the tulip fields in Netherlands bloom every year in April.

165
0:08:56.94,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So we take an image captured in March a few weeks before

166
0:09:00.1,000 --> 0:09:02,000
and contrast it to one taken a few weeks later.

167
0:09:03.38,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We're able to watch the flowers bloom in this magnificent cascade of color.

168
0:09:08.86,000 --> 0:09:13,000
It is estimated that the Dutch produce 4.3 billion tulip bulbs every year.

169
0:09:15.98,000 --> 0:09:18,000
In 2015, two dams collapsed

170
0:09:19.1,000 --> 0:09:21,000
at an iron ore mine in southeastern Brazil,

171
0:09:21.82,000 --> 0:09:23,000
causing one of the worst environmental disasters

172
0:09:24.46,000 --> 0:09:25,000
in the history of the country.

173
0:09:26.3,000 --> 0:09:29,000
It is estimated that 62 million cubic meters of waste

174
0:09:30.22,000 --> 0:09:31,000
were released when the dams broke,

175
0:09:31.94,000 --> 0:09:33,000
destroying numerous villages in the process,

176
0:09:34.38,000 --> 0:09:37,000
including Bento Rodrigues, seen here before ...

177
0:09:39.94,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and after the flood.

178
0:09:43.1,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Ultimately, 19 people were killed in this disaster.

179
0:09:46.66,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Half a million people did not have access to clean drinking water

180
0:09:49.78,000 --> 0:09:51,000
for an extended period of time,

181
0:09:51.82,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and the waste soon entered into the Doce River,

182
0:09:54.3,000 --> 0:09:56,000
extended for 650 kilometers

183
0:09:56.82,000 --> 0:09:57,000
all the way into the sea,

184
0:09:58.5,000 --> 0:10:01,000
killing unknowable amounts of plant and animal life along the way.

185
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And lastly, here is a story related to the crisis in Syria,

186
0:10:07.06,000 --> 0:10:1,000
a conflict which has claimed the lives of hundreds of thousands of people

187
0:10:10.94,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and displaced millions.

188
0:10:12.86,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So this patch of desert is seen in Mafraq, Jordan in 2011,

189
0:10:17.38,000 --> 0:10:18,000
the year the conflict started,

190
0:10:19.1,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and when we compare it to an image captured just this year in 2017,

191
0:10:24.54,000 --> 0:10:26,000
we see the construction of the Zaatari refugee camp.

192
0:10:27.86,000 --> 0:10:3,000
So just as the astronauts of Apollo 8

193
0:10:31.54,000 --> 0:10:34,000
watched the Earth rising above the lunar landscape for the first time,

194
0:10:35.5,000 --> 0:10:37,000
there is no way that you could have imagined

195
0:10:37.7,000 --> 0:10:41,000
what the places I just showed you look like from outer space.

196
0:10:42.54,000 --> 0:10:44,000
And while you may enjoy the aesthetics of an image,

197
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
once you learn exactly what it is you're seeing,

198
0:10:47.54,000 --> 0:10:49,000
you may struggle with the fact that you still like it.

199
0:10:51.3,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And that's the tension I want to create with my work,

200
0:10:54.14,000 --> 0:10:57,000
because I believe it is that contemplation,

201
0:10:57.3,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that internal dialogue

202
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
that will lead to greater interest in our planet

203
0:11:01.7,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and more awareness of what we're doing to it.

204
0:11:04.78,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I believe that viewing the Earth from the overview perspective

205
0:11:07.74,000 --> 0:11:09,000
is more important now than ever before.

206
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Through the incredible technology of these high-flying cameras,

207
0:11:14.62,000 --> 0:11:17,000
we can see, monitor and expose

208
0:11:17.82,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the unprecedented impact that we are having.

209
0:11:21.18,000 --> 0:11:23,000
And whether we are scientists

210
0:11:23.22,000 --> 0:11:26,000
or engineers or policymakers

211
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
or investors or artists,

212
0:11:29.22,000 --> 0:11:32,000
if we can adopt a more expansive perspective,

213
0:11:32.7,000 --> 0:11:35,000
embrace the truth of what is going on

214
0:11:36.02,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and contemplate the long-term health of our planet,

215
0:11:40.18,000 --> 0:11:41,000
we will create a better

216
0:11:42.18,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and safer and smarter future

217
0:11:44.98,000 --> 0:11:46,000
for our one and only home.

218
0:11:47.14,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Thank you.

219
0:11:48.38,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Applause)

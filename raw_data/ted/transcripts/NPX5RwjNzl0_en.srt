1
0:00:12.93,000 --> 0:00:13,000
These are simple objects:

2
0:00:14.385,000 --> 0:00:17,000
clocks, keys, combs, glasses.

3
0:00:18.18,000 --> 0:00:2,000
They are the things the victims of genocide in Bosnia

4
0:00:20.52,000 --> 0:00:22,000
carried with them on their final journey.

5
0:00:23.517,000 --> 0:00:25,000
We are all familiar with these mundane,

6
0:00:26.24,000 --> 0:00:27,000
everyday objects.

7
0:00:27.974,000 --> 0:00:28,000
The fact that some of the victims carried

8
0:00:29.559,000 --> 0:00:32,000
personal items such as toothpaste and a toothbrush

9
0:00:32.973,000 --> 0:00:34,000
is a clear sign they had no idea

10
0:00:35.492,000 --> 0:00:36,000
what was about to happen to them.

11
0:00:37.32,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Usually, they were told that they were going to be

12
0:00:39.711,000 --> 0:00:41,000
exchanged for prisoners of war.

13
0:00:42.199,000 --> 0:00:44,000
These items have been recovered

14
0:00:44.212,000 --> 0:00:46,000
from numerous mass graves across my homeland,

15
0:00:47.05,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and as we speak, forensics are exhuming bodies

16
0:00:49.58,000 --> 0:00:51,000
from newly discovered mass graves,

17
0:00:51.714,000 --> 0:00:52,000
20 years after the war.

18
0:00:53.25,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And it is quite possibly the largest ever discovered.

19
0:00:57.333,000 --> 0:00:59,000
During the four years of conflict

20
0:00:59.611,000 --> 0:01:01,000
that devastated the Bosnian nation in the early '90s,

21
0:01:02.457,000 --> 0:01:05,000
approximately 30,000 citizens, mainly civilians,

22
0:01:05.888,000 --> 0:01:06,000
went missing, presumed killed,

23
0:01:07.823,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and another 100,000 were killed

24
0:01:09.803,000 --> 0:01:1,000
during combat operations.

25
0:01:11.53,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Most of them were killed

26
0:01:13.159,000 --> 0:01:14,000
either in the early days of the war

27
0:01:14.932,000 --> 0:01:15,000
or towards the end of the hostilities,

28
0:01:16.298,000 --> 0:01:19,000
when U.N. safe zones like Srebrenica

29
0:01:19.477,000 --> 0:01:22,000
fell into the hands of the Serb army.

30
0:01:22.522,000 --> 0:01:24,000
The international criminal tribunal

31
0:01:24.64,000 --> 0:01:25,000
delivered a number of sentences

32
0:01:26.33,000 --> 0:01:28,000
for crimes against humanity and genocide.

33
0:01:29.109,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Genocide is a systematic and deliberate

34
0:01:32.618,000 --> 0:01:35,000
destruction of a racial, political, religious

35
0:01:36.288,000 --> 0:01:37,000
or ethnic group.

36
0:01:37.96,000 --> 0:01:39,000
As much as genocide is about killing.

37
0:01:40.54,000 --> 0:01:43,000
It is also about destroying their property,

38
0:01:43.561,000 --> 0:01:44,000
their cultural heritage,

39
0:01:45.451,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and ultimately the very notion that they ever existed.

40
0:01:48.713,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Genocide is not only about the killing;

41
0:01:51.21,000 --> 0:01:54,000
it is about the denied identity.

42
0:01:54.383,000 --> 0:01:55,000
There are always traces —

43
0:01:55.813,000 --> 0:01:56,000
no such thing as a perfect crime.

44
0:01:57.532,000 --> 0:01:59,000
There are always remnants of the perished ones

45
0:02:00.267,000 --> 0:02:02,000
that are more durable than their fragile bodies

46
0:02:02.785,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and our selective and fading memory of them.

47
0:02:06.523,000 --> 0:02:08,000
These items are recovered

48
0:02:09.18,000 --> 0:02:1,000
from numerous mass graves,

49
0:02:10.352,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and the main goal of this collection of the items

50
0:02:13.766,000 --> 0:02:14,000
is a unique process

51
0:02:15.234,000 --> 0:02:18,000
of identifying those who disappeared in the killings,

52
0:02:18.512,000 --> 0:02:2,000
the first act of genocide on European soil

53
0:02:21.482,000 --> 0:02:22,000
since the Holocaust.

54
0:02:22.905,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Not a single body should remain undiscovered

55
0:02:25.419,000 --> 0:02:26,000
or unidentified.

56
0:02:27.285,000 --> 0:02:28,000
Once recovered,

57
0:02:28.65,000 --> 0:02:3,000
these items that the victims carried with them

58
0:02:31.573,000 --> 0:02:32,000
on their way to execution

59
0:02:33.052,000 --> 0:02:35,000
are carefully cleaned, analyzed,

60
0:02:35.409,000 --> 0:02:37,000
catalogued and stored.

61
0:02:37.647,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Thousands of artifacts are packed in white plastic bags

62
0:02:40.797,000 --> 0:02:42,000
just like the ones you see on CSI.

63
0:02:43.2,000 --> 0:02:45,000
These objects are used as a forensic tool

64
0:02:45.938,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in visual identification of the victims,

65
0:02:48.393,000 --> 0:02:51,000
but they are also used as very valuable forensic evidence

66
0:02:51.64,000 --> 0:02:53,000
in the ongoing war crimes trials.

67
0:02:54.477,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Survivors are occasionally called

68
0:02:56.568,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to try to identify these items physically,

69
0:02:59.119,000 --> 0:03:02,000
but physical browsing is extremely difficult,

70
0:03:02.449,000 --> 0:03:05,000
an ineffective and painful process.

71
0:03:05.551,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Once the forensics and doctors and lawyers

72
0:03:09.344,000 --> 0:03:1,000
are done with these objects,

73
0:03:10.486,000 --> 0:03:12,000
they become orphans of the narrative.

74
0:03:13.417,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Many of them get destroyed, believe it or not,

75
0:03:16.319,000 --> 0:03:17,000
or they get simply shelved,

76
0:03:17.956,000 --> 0:03:19,000
out of sight and out of mind.

77
0:03:20.198,000 --> 0:03:22,000
I decided a few years ago

78
0:03:22.714,000 --> 0:03:24,000
to photograph every single exhumed item

79
0:03:25.38,000 --> 0:03:26,000
in order to create a visual archive

80
0:03:27.281,000 --> 0:03:3,000
that survivors could easily browse.

81
0:03:30.631,000 --> 0:03:34,000
As a storyteller, I like to give back to the community.

82
0:03:34.688,000 --> 0:03:36,000
I like to move beyond raising awareness.

83
0:03:37.431,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And in this case, someone may

84
0:03:39.615,000 --> 0:03:4,000
recognize these items

85
0:03:41.216,000 --> 0:03:43,000
or at least their photographs will remain

86
0:03:43.912,000 --> 0:03:46,000
as a permanent, unbiased and accurate reminder

87
0:03:47.714,000 --> 0:03:48,000
of what happened.

88
0:03:49.626,000 --> 0:03:51,000
Photography is about empathy,

89
0:03:51.764,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and the familiarity of these items guarantee empathy.

90
0:03:54.982,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In this case, I am merely a tool,

91
0:03:57.436,000 --> 0:03:58,000
a forensic, if you like,

92
0:03:59.09,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and the result is a photography that is as close

93
0:04:01.755,000 --> 0:04:03,000
as possible of being a document.

94
0:04:04.376,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Once all the missing persons are identified,

95
0:04:07.515,000 --> 0:04:08,000
only decaying bodies in their graves

96
0:04:09.288,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and these everyday items will remain.

97
0:04:11.63,000 --> 0:04:12,000
In all their simplicity,

98
0:04:13.555,000 --> 0:04:15,000
these items are the last testament

99
0:04:15.762,000 --> 0:04:16,000
to the identity of the victims,

100
0:04:17.319,000 --> 0:04:19,000
the last permanent reminder

101
0:04:19.347,000 --> 0:04:2,000
that these people ever existed.

102
0:04:21.319,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Thank you very much.

103
0:04:23.657,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Applause)

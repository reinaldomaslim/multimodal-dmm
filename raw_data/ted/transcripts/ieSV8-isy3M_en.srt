1
0:00:12.635,000 --> 0:00:14,000
My mom has always reminded me

2
0:00:15.631,000 --> 0:00:18,000
that I have the same proportions as a LEGO man.

3
0:00:18.952,000 --> 0:00:19,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:20.389,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And she does actually have a point.

5
0:00:23.333,000 --> 0:00:25,000
LEGO is a company that has succeeded

6
0:00:25.934,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in making everybody believe that LEGO is from their home country.

7
0:00:31.411,000 --> 0:00:33,000
But it's not, it's from my home country.

8
0:00:33.99,000 --> 0:00:36,000
So you can imagine my excitement when the LEGO family called me

9
0:00:37.293,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and asked us to work with them to design the Home of the Brick.

10
0:00:40.988,000 --> 0:00:43,000
This is the architectural model -- we built it out of LEGO, obviously.

11
0:00:44.494,000 --> 0:00:45,000
This is the final result.

12
0:00:46.003,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And what we tried to do was to design

13
0:00:48.235,000 --> 0:00:52,000
a building that would be as interactive and as engaging and as playful

14
0:00:52.846,000 --> 0:00:53,000
as LEGO is itself,

15
0:00:54.37,000 --> 0:00:57,000
with these kind of interconnected playgrounds on the roofscape.

16
0:00:57.43,000 --> 0:00:58,000
You can enter a square on the ground

17
0:00:59.299,000 --> 0:01:03,000
where the citizens of Billund can roam around freely without a ticket.

18
0:01:04.027,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And it's probably one of the only museums in the world

19
0:01:06.742,000 --> 0:01:09,000
where you're allowed to touch all the artifacts.

20
0:01:10.948,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But the Danish word for design is "formgivning," which literally means

21
0:01:16.873,000 --> 0:01:2,000
to give form to that which has not yet been given form.

22
0:01:21.057,000 --> 0:01:24,000
In other words, to give form to the future.

23
0:01:24.933,000 --> 0:01:27,000
And what I love about LEGO is that LEGO is not a toy.

24
0:01:28.748,000 --> 0:01:33,000
It's a tool that empowers the child to build his or her own world,

25
0:01:34.216,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and then to inhabit that world through play

26
0:01:36.351,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and to invite her friends to join her in cohabiting and cocreating that world.

27
0:01:41.151,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And that is exactly what formgivning is.

28
0:01:44.016,000 --> 0:01:49,000
As human beings, we have the power to give form to our future.

29
0:01:50.722,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Inspired by LEGO,

30
0:01:51.961,000 --> 0:01:54,000
we've built a social housing project in Copenhagen,

31
0:01:55.809,000 --> 0:01:58,000
where we stacked blocks of wood next to each other.

32
0:01:59.412,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Between them, they leave spaces with extra ceiling heights and balconies.

33
0:02:04.065,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And by gently wiggling the blocks,

34
0:02:06.66,000 --> 0:02:08,000
we can actually create curves or any organic form,

35
0:02:09.295,000 --> 0:02:12,000
adapting to any urban context.

36
0:02:12.918,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Because adaptability is probably one of the strongest drivers of architecture.

37
0:02:18.165,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Another example is here in Vancouver.

38
0:02:20.46,000 --> 0:02:24,000
We were asked to look at the site where Granville bridge triforks

39
0:02:24.601,000 --> 0:02:25,000
as it touches downtown.

40
0:02:26.561,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And we started, like, mapping the different constraints.

41
0:02:29.252,000 --> 0:02:31,000
There's like a 100-foot setback from the bridge

42
0:02:31.879,000 --> 0:02:32,000
because the city want to make sure

43
0:02:33.599,000 --> 0:02:36,000
that no one looks into the traffic on the bridge.

44
0:02:37.085,000 --> 0:02:4,000
There's a park where we can't cast any shadows.

45
0:02:40.22,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So finally, we're left with a tiny triangular footprint,

46
0:02:43.569,000 --> 0:02:44,000
almost too small to build.

47
0:02:45.743,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But then we thought, like,

48
0:02:47.006,000 --> 0:02:51,000
what if the 100-foot minimum distance is really about minimum distance --

49
0:02:51.265,000 --> 0:02:55,000
once we get 100 feet up in the air, we can grow the building back out.

50
0:02:55.82,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And so we did.

51
0:02:57.01,000 --> 0:02:58,000
When you drive over the bridge,

52
0:02:58.518,000 --> 0:03:,000
it's as if someone is pulling a curtain aback,

53
0:03:01.209,000 --> 0:03:03,000
welcoming you to Vancouver.

54
0:03:03.99,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Or a like a weed growing through the cracks in the pavement

55
0:03:06.967,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and blossoming as it gets light and air.

56
0:03:09.553,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Underneath the bridge, we've worked with Rodney Graham

57
0:03:12.879,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and a handful of Vancouver artists,

58
0:03:15.339,000 --> 0:03:19,000
to create what we called the Sistine Chapel of street art,

59
0:03:19.53,000 --> 0:03:2,000
an art gallery turned upside down,

60
0:03:21.498,000 --> 0:03:25,000
that tries to turn the negative impact of the bridge into a positive.

61
0:03:25.8,000 --> 0:03:27,000
So even if it looks like this kind of surreal architecture,

62
0:03:28.823,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it's highly adapted to its surroundings.

63
0:03:32.966,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So if a bridge can become a museum, a museum can also serve as a bridge.

64
0:03:37.346,000 --> 0:03:41,000
In Norway, we are building a museum that spans across a river

65
0:03:41.776,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and allows people to sort of journey through the exhibitions

66
0:03:45.069,000 --> 0:03:48,000
as they cross from one side of a sculpture park to the other.

67
0:03:48.981,000 --> 0:03:51,000
An architecture sort of adapted to its landscape.

68
0:03:53.29,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In China, we built a headquarters for an energy company

69
0:03:57.053,000 --> 0:04:,000
and we designed the facade like an Issey Miyake fabric.

70
0:04:00.641,000 --> 0:04:03,000
It's rippled, so that facing the predominant direction of the sun,

71
0:04:04.403,000 --> 0:04:05,000
it's all opaque;

72
0:04:05.887,000 --> 0:04:07,000
facing away from the sun, it's all glass.

73
0:04:08.601,000 --> 0:04:11,000
On average, it sort of transitions from solid to clear.

74
0:04:12.704,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And this very simple idea without any moving parts

75
0:04:15.467,000 --> 0:04:16,000
or any sort of technology,

76
0:04:17.038,000 --> 0:04:19,000
purely because of the geometry of the facade,

77
0:04:19.767,000 --> 0:04:22,000
reduces the energy consumption on cooling by 30 percent.

78
0:04:24.672,000 --> 0:04:26,000
So you can say what makes the building look elegant

79
0:04:27.457,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is also what makes it perform elegantly.

80
0:04:29.966,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's an architecture that is adapted to its climate.

81
0:04:33.014,000 --> 0:04:36,000
You can also adapt one culture to another,

82
0:04:36.506,000 --> 0:04:4,000
like in Manhattan, we took the Copenhagen courtyard building

83
0:04:40.701,000 --> 0:04:42,000
with a social space where people can hang out

84
0:04:42.974,000 --> 0:04:44,000
in this kind of oasis in the middle of a city,

85
0:04:45.141,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and we combined it with the density and the verticality

86
0:04:47.759,000 --> 0:04:48,000
of an American skyscraper,

87
0:04:49.196,000 --> 0:04:51,000
creating what we've called a "courtscraper."

88
0:04:52.752,000 --> 0:04:54,000
From New York to Copenhagen.

89
0:04:55.34,000 --> 0:04:56,000
On the waterfront of Copenhagen,

90
0:04:57.061,000 --> 0:05:01,000
we are right now finishing this waste-to-energy power plant.

91
0:05:02.093,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It's going to be the cleanest waste-to-energy power plant in the world,

92
0:05:05.452,000 --> 0:05:07,000
there are no toxins coming out of the chimney.

93
0:05:07.65,000 --> 0:05:1,000
An amazing marvel of engineering that is completely invisible.

94
0:05:10.709,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So we thought, how can we express this?

95
0:05:14.082,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And in Copenhagen we have snow, as you can see,

96
0:05:16.987,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but we have absolutely no mountains.

97
0:05:20.217,000 --> 0:05:22,000
We have to go six hours by bus to get to Sweden,

98
0:05:23.035,000 --> 0:05:24,000
to get alpine skiing.

99
0:05:24.4,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So we thought, let's put an alpine ski slope

100
0:05:27.154,000 --> 0:05:28,000
on the roof of the power plant.

101
0:05:29.131,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So this is the first test run we did a few months ago.

102
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And what I like about this

103
0:05:34.561,000 --> 0:05:39,000
is that it also show you the sort of world-changing power of formgivning.

104
0:05:40.149,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I have a five-month-old son,

105
0:05:42.061,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and he's going to grow up in a world

106
0:05:44.442,000 --> 0:05:45,000
not knowing that there was ever a time

107
0:05:46.444,000 --> 0:05:48,000
when you couldn't ski on the roof of the power plant.

108
0:05:49.395,000 --> 0:05:51,000
(Laughter)

109
0:05:51.498,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Applause)

110
0:05:55.387,000 --> 0:05:58,000
So imagine for him and his generation, that's their baseline.

111
0:05:59.006,000 --> 0:06:,000
Imagine how far they can leap,

112
0:06:00.934,000 --> 0:06:03,000
what kind of wild ideas they can put forward for their future.

113
0:06:05.453,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So right in front of it, we're building our smallest project.

114
0:06:09.598,000 --> 0:06:11,000
It's basically nine containers

115
0:06:12.58,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that we have stacked in a shipyard in Poland,

116
0:06:15.381,000 --> 0:06:17,000
then we've schlepped it across the Baltic sea

117
0:06:17.762,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and docked it in the port of Copenhagen,

118
0:06:19.968,000 --> 0:06:22,000
where it is now the home of 12 students.

119
0:06:23.095,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Each student has a view to the water,

120
0:06:25.418,000 --> 0:06:28,000
they can jump out the window into the clean port of Copenhagen,

121
0:06:28.855,000 --> 0:06:29,000
and they can get back in.

122
0:06:30.768,000 --> 0:06:33,000
All of the heat comes from the thermal mass of the sea,

123
0:06:33.95,000 --> 0:06:35,000
all the power comes from the sun.

124
0:06:35.99,000 --> 0:06:37,000
This is the first 12 units in Copenhagen,

125
0:06:38.014,000 --> 0:06:39,000
another 60 on their way,

126
0:06:39.952,000 --> 0:06:41,000
another 200 are going to Gothenburg,

127
0:06:42.371,000 --> 0:06:44,000
and we're speaking with the Paris Olympics

128
0:06:44.47,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to put a small floating village on the Seine.

129
0:06:47.633,000 --> 0:06:51,000
So very much this kind of, almost like nomadic, impermanent architecture.

130
0:06:52.061,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And the waterfronts of our cities are experiencing a lot of change.

131
0:06:56.289,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Economic change, industrial change and climate change.

132
0:06:59.752,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This is Manhattan before Hurricane Sandy,

133
0:07:03.419,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and this is Manhattan after Sandy.

134
0:07:06.101,000 --> 0:07:07,000
We got invited by the city of New York

135
0:07:08.078,000 --> 0:07:12,000
to look if we could make the necessary flood protection for Manhattan

136
0:07:12.363,000 --> 0:07:13,000
without building a seawall

137
0:07:14.236,000 --> 0:07:17,000
that would segregate the life of the city from the water around it.

138
0:07:17.527,000 --> 0:07:19,000
And we got inspired by the High Line.

139
0:07:19.559,000 --> 0:07:22,000
You probably know the High Line -- it's this amazing new park in New York.

140
0:07:23.495,000 --> 0:07:26,000
It's basically decommissioned train tracks

141
0:07:26.752,000 --> 0:07:29,000
that now have become one of the most popular promenades in the city.

142
0:07:30.323,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So we thought,

143
0:07:31.498,000 --> 0:07:34,000
could we design the necessary flood protection for Manhattan

144
0:07:34.903,000 --> 0:07:38,000
so we don't have to wait until we shut it down before it gets nice?

145
0:07:39.919,000 --> 0:07:45,000
So we sat down with the citizens living along the waterfront of New York,

146
0:07:46.416,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and we worked with them to try to design the necessary flood protection

147
0:07:50.384,000 --> 0:07:53,000
in such a way that it only makes their waterfront

148
0:07:53.486,000 --> 0:07:55,000
more accessible and more enjoyable.

149
0:07:55.738,000 --> 0:07:58,000
Underneath the FDR, we are putting, like, pavilions

150
0:07:58.807,000 --> 0:08:01,000
with pocket walls that can slide out and protect from the water.

151
0:08:01.833,000 --> 0:08:02,000
We are creating little stepped terraces

152
0:08:03.776,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that are going to make the underside more enjoyable,

153
0:08:06.23,000 --> 0:08:08,000
but also protect from flooding.

154
0:08:09.498,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Further north in the East River Park,

155
0:08:12.696,000 --> 0:08:14,000
we are creating rolling hills

156
0:08:15.577,000 --> 0:08:19,000
that protect the park from the noise of the highway,

157
0:08:19.649,000 --> 0:08:22,000
but in turn also become the necessary flood protection

158
0:08:23.088,000 --> 0:08:26,000
that can stop the waves during an incoming storm surge.

159
0:08:28.001,000 --> 0:08:32,000
So in a way, this project that we have called the Dryline,

160
0:08:32.522,000 --> 0:08:33,000
it's essentially the High Line --

161
0:08:34.121,000 --> 0:08:35,000
(Laughter)

162
0:08:35.696,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The High Line that's going to keep Manhattan dry.

163
0:08:38.085,000 --> 0:08:4,000
(Applause)

164
0:08:40.364,000 --> 0:08:43,000
It's scheduled to break ground on the first East River portion

165
0:08:44.017,000 --> 0:08:45,000
at the end of this year.

166
0:08:45.299,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But it has essentially been codesigned

167
0:08:47.847,000 --> 0:08:49,000
with the citizens of Lower Manhattan

168
0:08:50.461,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to take all of the necessary infrastructure for resilience

169
0:08:54.015,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and give it positive social and environmental side effects.

170
0:08:58.762,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So, New York is not alone in facing this situation.

171
0:09:04.309,000 --> 0:09:06,000
In fact, by 2050,

172
0:09:07.848,000 --> 0:09:09,000
90 percent of the major cities in the world

173
0:09:10.831,000 --> 0:09:12,000
are going to be dealing with rising seas.

174
0:09:13.45,000 --> 0:09:14,000
In Hamburg,

175
0:09:15.014,000 --> 0:09:16,000
they've created a whole neighborhood

176
0:09:16.776,000 --> 0:09:19,000
where the bottom floors are designed to withstand the inevitable flood.

177
0:09:20.756,000 --> 0:09:26,000
In Sweden, they've designed a city where all of the parks are wet gardens,

178
0:09:27.248,000 --> 0:09:3,000
designed to deal with storm water and waste water.

179
0:09:31.927,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So we thought, could we perhaps --

180
0:09:34.046,000 --> 0:09:35,000
Actually, today,

181
0:09:36.292,000 --> 0:09:41,000
three million people are already permanently living on the sea.

182
0:09:41.8,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So we thought, could we actually imagine a floating city

183
0:09:45.274,000 --> 0:09:48,000
designed to incorporate all of the Sustainable Development Goals

184
0:09:49.276,000 --> 0:09:5,000
of the United Nations

185
0:09:50.839,000 --> 0:09:54,000
into a whole new human-made ecosystem.

186
0:09:55.387,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And of course, we have to design it so it can produce its own power,

187
0:09:59.784,000 --> 0:10:01,000
harvesting the thermal mass of the oceans,

188
0:10:02.387,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the force of the tides, of the currents, of the waves,

189
0:10:05.585,000 --> 0:10:06,000
the power of the wind,

190
0:10:07.347,000 --> 0:10:09,000
the heat and the energy of the sun.

191
0:10:10.091,000 --> 0:10:13,000
Also, we are going to collect all of the rain water that drops

192
0:10:13.492,000 --> 0:10:15,000
on this man-made archipelago

193
0:10:15.631,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and deal with it organically and mechanically

194
0:10:18.703,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and store it and clean it.

195
0:10:20.911,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We have to grow all of our food locally,

196
0:10:23.958,000 --> 0:10:25,000
it has to be fish- and plant-based,

197
0:10:26.506,000 --> 0:10:3,000
because you won't have the space or the resources for a dairy diet.

198
0:10:31.661,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And finally,

199
0:10:34.288,000 --> 0:10:36,000
we are going to deal with all the waste locally,

200
0:10:37.129,000 --> 0:10:41,000
with compost, recycling, and turning the waste into energy.

201
0:10:41.695,000 --> 0:10:44,000
So imagine where a traditional urban master plan,

202
0:10:45.545,000 --> 0:10:48,000
you typically draw the street grid where the cars can drive

203
0:10:48.87,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and the building plots where you can put some buildings.

204
0:10:51.545,000 --> 0:10:54,000
This master plan, we sat down with a handful of scientists

205
0:10:55.283,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and basically started with all of the renewable,

206
0:10:57.668,000 --> 0:10:58,000
available natural resources,

207
0:10:59.624,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and then we started channeling the flow of resources

208
0:11:02.427,000 --> 0:11:07,000
through this kind of human-made ecosystem or this kind of urban metabolism.

209
0:11:08.466,000 --> 0:11:1,000
So it's going to be modular,

210
0:11:11.511,000 --> 0:11:12,000
it's going to be buoyant,

211
0:11:12.929,000 --> 0:11:15,000
it's going to be designed to resist a tropical storm.

212
0:11:16.442,000 --> 0:11:18,000
You can prefabricate it at scale,

213
0:11:18.736,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and tow it to dock with others, to form a small community.

214
0:11:23.419,000 --> 0:11:25,000
We're designing these kind of coastal additions,

215
0:11:26.087,000 --> 0:11:28,000
so that even if it's modular and rational,

216
0:11:28.514,000 --> 0:11:31,000
each island can be unique with its own coastal landscape.

217
0:11:32.376,000 --> 0:11:34,000
The architecture has to remain relatively low

218
0:11:35.249,000 --> 0:11:37,000
to keep the center of gravity buoyant.

219
0:11:38.171,000 --> 0:11:41,000
We're going to take all of the agriculture

220
0:11:41.726,000 --> 0:11:43,000
and use it to also create social space

221
0:11:43.816,000 --> 0:11:46,000
so you can actually enjoy the permaculture gardens.

222
0:11:46.873,000 --> 0:11:49,000
We're designing it for the tropics, so all of the roofs are maximized

223
0:11:50.347,000 --> 0:11:53,000
to harvest solar power and to shade from the sun.

224
0:11:54.212,000 --> 0:11:56,000
All the materials are going to be light and renewable,

225
0:11:56.8,000 --> 0:11:57,000
like bamboo and wood,

226
0:11:58.427,000 --> 0:12:01,000
which is also going to create this charming, warm environment.

227
0:12:02.411,000 --> 0:12:06,000
And any architecture is supposed to be able to fit on this platform.

228
0:12:07.99,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Underneath we have all the storage inside the pontoon,

229
0:12:11.705,000 --> 0:12:13,000
almost like a mega version of the student housings

230
0:12:14.712,000 --> 0:12:15,000
that we've already worked with.

231
0:12:16.45,000 --> 0:12:18,000
We have all the storage for the energy that's produced,

232
0:12:19.316,000 --> 0:12:21,000
all of the water storage and remediation.

233
0:12:22.392,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We are sort of dealing with all of the waste and the composting.

234
0:12:27.376,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And we also have some backup farming

235
0:12:29.765,000 --> 0:12:32,000
with aeroponics and hydroponics.

236
0:12:33.413,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So imagine almost like a vertical section through this landscape

237
0:12:37.318,000 --> 0:12:4,000
that goes from the air above, where we have vertical farms;

238
0:12:41.04,000 --> 0:12:44,000
below, we have the aeroponics and the aquaponics.

239
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:47,000
Even further below, we have the ocean farms

240
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
and where we tie the island to the ground,

241
0:12:50.927,000 --> 0:12:54,000
we're using biorock to create new reefs to regenerate habitat.

242
0:12:56.348,000 --> 0:12:59,000
So think of this small island for 300 people.

243
0:12:59.991,000 --> 0:13:02,000
It can then group together to form a cluster or a neighborhood

244
0:13:03.692,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that then can sort of group together to form an entire city for 10,000 people.

245
0:13:08.318,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And you can imagine if this floating city flourishes,

246
0:13:11.532,000 --> 0:13:14,000
it can sort of grow like a culture in a petri dish.

247
0:13:16.659,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So one of the first places we are looking at placing this,

248
0:13:20.143,000 --> 0:13:21,000
or anchoring this floating city,

249
0:13:21.784,000 --> 0:13:22,000
is in the Pearl River delta.

250
0:13:23.665,000 --> 0:13:26,000
So imagine this kind of canopy of photovoltaics

251
0:13:26.872,000 --> 0:13:28,000
on this archipelago floating in the sea.

252
0:13:29.625,000 --> 0:13:32,000
As you sail towards the island, you will see the maritime residents

253
0:13:33.466,000 --> 0:13:37,000
moving around on alternative forms of aquatic transportation.

254
0:13:37.807,000 --> 0:13:39,000
You come into this kind of community port.

255
0:13:40.789,000 --> 0:13:42,000
You can roam around in the permaculture gardens

256
0:13:43.728,000 --> 0:13:46,000
that are productive landscapes, but also social landscapes.

257
0:13:47.363,000 --> 0:13:51,000
The greenhouses also become orangeries for the cultural life of the city,

258
0:13:52.49,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and below, under the sea,

259
0:13:54.704,000 --> 0:13:58,000
it's teeming with life of farming and science

260
0:13:58.998,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and social spaces.

261
0:14:00.752,000 --> 0:14:03,000
So in a way, you can imagine this community port

262
0:14:03.847,000 --> 0:14:06,000
is where people gather, both by day and by night.

263
0:14:07.284,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And even if the first one is designed for the tropics,

264
0:14:10.315,000 --> 0:14:13,000
we also imagine that the architecture can adapt to any culture,

265
0:14:13.559,000 --> 0:14:15,000
so imagine, like, a Middle Eastern floating city

266
0:14:16.488,000 --> 0:14:18,000
or Southeast Asian floating city

267
0:14:19.331,000 --> 0:14:23,000
or maybe a Scandinavian floating city one day.

268
0:14:24.412,000 --> 0:14:26,000
So maybe just to conclude.

269
0:14:28.142,000 --> 0:14:31,000
The human body is 70 percent water.

270
0:14:32.134,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And the surface of our planet is 70 percent water.

271
0:14:36.623,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And it's rising.

272
0:14:38.148,000 --> 0:14:4,000
And even if the whole world woke up tomorrow

273
0:14:40.751,000 --> 0:14:42,000
and became carbon-neutral over night,

274
0:14:43.06,000 --> 0:14:47,000
there are still island nations that are destined to sink in the seas,

275
0:14:47.246,000 --> 0:14:51,000
unless we also develop alternate forms of floating human habitats.

276
0:14:53.977,000 --> 0:14:56,000
And the only constant in the universe is change.

277
0:14:57.133,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Our world is always changing, and right now, our climate is changing.

278
0:15:02.014,000 --> 0:15:05,000
No matter how critical the crisis is, and it is,

279
0:15:05.361,000 --> 0:15:09,000
this is also our collective human superpower.

280
0:15:10.345,000 --> 0:15:13,000
That we have the power to adapt to change

281
0:15:13.508,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and we have the power to give form to our future.

282
0:15:18.04,000 --> 0:15:23,000
(Applause)

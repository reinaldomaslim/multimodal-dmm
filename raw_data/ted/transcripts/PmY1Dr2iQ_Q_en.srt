0:00:13.125,000 --> 0:00:17,000
When I waltzed off to high school with my new Nokia phone,

3
0:00:17.292,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I thought I just had the new, coolest replacement

4
0:00:19.708,000 --> 0:00:21,000
for my old pink princess walkie-talkie.

5
0:00:22.708,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Except now, my friends and I could text or talk to each other

6
0:00:26.583,000 --> 0:00:27,000
wherever we were,

7
0:00:27.875,000 --> 0:00:28,000
instead of pretending,

8
0:00:29.167,000 --> 0:00:32,000
when we were running around each other's backyards.

9
0:00:32.417,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Now, I'll be honest.

10
0:00:34.167,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Back then, I didn't think a lot about how these devices were made.

11
0:00:38.458,000 --> 0:00:4,000
They tended to show up on Christmas morning,

12
0:00:40.833,000 --> 0:00:42,000
so maybe they were made by the elves in Santa's workshop.

13
0:00:44.875,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Let me ask you a question.

14
0:00:47.042,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Who do you think the real elves that make these devices are?

15
0:00:51.333,000 --> 0:00:53,000
If I ask a lot of the people I know,

16
0:00:53.5,000 --> 0:00:56,000
they would say it's the hoodie-wearing software engineers in Silicon Valley,

17
0:00:57.167,000 --> 0:00:58,000
hacking away at code.

18
0:00:59.833,000 --> 0:01:,000
But a lot has to happen to these devices

19
0:01:01.792,000 --> 0:01:03,000
before they're ready for any kind of code.

20
0:01:04.125,000 --> 0:01:07,000
These devices start at the atomic level.

21
0:01:07.667,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So if you ask me,

22
0:01:09.375,000 --> 0:01:11,000
the real elves are the chemists.

23
0:01:12.875,000 --> 0:01:14,000
That's right, I said the chemists.

24
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Chemistry is the hero of electronic communications.

25
0:01:20.208,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And my goal today is to convince you

26
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:24,000
to agree with me.

27
0:01:25.667,000 --> 0:01:26,000
OK, let's start simple,

28
0:01:27.583,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and take a look inside these insanely addictive devices.

29
0:01:32.042,000 --> 0:01:34,000
Because without chemistry,

30
0:01:34.083,000 --> 0:01:37,000
what is an information superhighway that we love,

31
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:41,000
would just be a really expensive, shiny paperweight.

32
0:01:42.708,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Chemistry enables all of these layers.

33
0:01:46.167,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Let's start at the display.

34
0:01:48.375,000 --> 0:01:5,000
How do you think we get those bright, vivid colors

35
0:01:50.958,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that we love so much?

36
0:01:53.167,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Well, I'll tell you.

37
0:01:54.458,000 --> 0:01:56,000
There's organic polymers embedded within the display,

38
0:01:57.292,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that can take electricity and turn it into the blue, red and green

39
0:02:01.5,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that we enjoy in our pictures.

40
0:02:04.75,000 --> 0:02:06,000
What if we move down to the battery?

41
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Now there's some intense research.

42
0:02:09.333,000 --> 0:02:12,000
How do we take the chemical principles of traditional batteries

43
0:02:13.208,000 --> 0:02:16,000
and pair it with new, high surface area electrodes,

44
0:02:16.625,000 --> 0:02:19,000
so we can pack more charge in a smaller footprint of space,

45
0:02:20.292,000 --> 0:02:22,000
so that we could power our devices all day long,

46
0:02:22.667,000 --> 0:02:23,000
while we're taking selfies,

47
0:02:24.375,000 --> 0:02:25,000
without having to recharge our batteries

48
0:02:26.333,000 --> 0:02:28,000
or sit tethered to an electrical outlet?

49
0:02:30.125,000 --> 0:02:33,000
What if we go to the adhesives that bind it all together,

50
0:02:33.667,000 --> 0:02:35,000
so that it could withstand our frequent usage?

51
0:02:36.542,000 --> 0:02:37,000
After all, as a millennial,

52
0:02:38.542,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I have to take my phone out at least 200 times a day to check it,

53
0:02:42.5,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and in the process, drop it two to three times.

54
0:02:48.042,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But what are the real brains of these devices?

55
0:02:50.25,000 --> 0:02:53,000
What makes them work the way that we love them so much?

56
0:02:54.083,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Well that all has to do with electrical components and circuitry

57
0:02:57.208,000 --> 0:03:,000
that are tethered to a printed circuit board.

58
0:03:00.667,000 --> 0:03:02,000
Or maybe you prefer a biological metaphor --

59
0:03:03.208,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the motherboard, you might have heard of that.

60
0:03:07,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Now, the printed circuit board doesn't really get talked about a lot.

61
0:03:10.333,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And I'll be honest, I don't know why that is.

62
0:03:12.583,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Maybe it's because it's the least sexy layer

63
0:03:14.833,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and it's hidden beneath all of those other sleek-looking layers.

64
0:03:18.542,000 --> 0:03:21,000
But it's time to finally give this Clark Kent layer

65
0:03:21.875,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the Superman-worthy praise it deserves.

66
0:03:25.667,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And so I ask you a question.

67
0:03:28.208,000 --> 0:03:3,000
What do you think a printed circuit board is?

68
0:03:31.5,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Well, consider a metaphor.

69
0:03:33.625,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Think about the city that you live in.

70
0:03:35.875,000 --> 0:03:38,000
You have all these points of interest that you want to get to:

71
0:03:39.208,000 --> 0:03:41,000
your home, your work, restaurants,

72
0:03:42.125,000 --> 0:03:44,000
a couple of Starbucks on every block.

73
0:03:45.208,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And so we build roads that connect them all together.

74
0:03:49.833,000 --> 0:03:51,000
That's what a printed circuit board is.

75
0:03:52.375,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Except, instead of having things like restaurants,

76
0:03:55.167,000 --> 0:03:58,000
we have transistors on chips,

77
0:03:58.958,000 --> 0:03:59,000
capacitors, resistors,

78
0:04:00.292,000 --> 0:04:02,000
all of these electrical components

79
0:04:02.792,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that need to find a way to talk to each other.

80
0:04:06,000 --> 0:04:07,000
And so what are our roads?

81
0:04:08.667,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Well, we build tiny copper wires.

82
0:04:12.667,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So the next question is,

83
0:04:13.958,000 --> 0:04:15,000
how do we make these tiny copper wires?

84
0:04:16.25,000 --> 0:04:17,000
They're really small.

85
0:04:17.917,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Could it be that we go to the hardware store,

86
0:04:20.417,000 --> 0:04:21,000
pick up a spool of copper wire,

87
0:04:22.417,000 --> 0:04:24,000
get some wire cutters, a little clip-clip,

88
0:04:25.417,000 --> 0:04:28,000
saw it all up and then, bam -- we have our printed circuit board?

89
0:04:3,000 --> 0:04:31,000
No way.

90
0:04:31.292,000 --> 0:04:33,000
These wires are way too small for that.

91
0:04:33.75,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And so we have to rely on our friend: chemistry.

92
0:04:38.708,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Now, the chemical process to make these tiny copper wires

93
0:04:41.833,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is seemingly simple.

94
0:04:43.875,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We start with a solution

95
0:04:45.667,000 --> 0:04:48,000
of positively charged copper spheres.

96
0:04:49.083,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We then add to it an insulating printed circuit board.

97
0:04:53.542,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And we feed those positively charged spheres

98
0:04:56.958,000 --> 0:04:57,000
negatively charged electrons

99
0:04:58.75,000 --> 0:05:,000
by adding formaldehyde to the mix.

100
0:05:01.167,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So you might remember formaldehyde.

101
0:05:02.958,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Really distinct odor,

102
0:05:04.75,000 --> 0:05:07,000
used to preserve frogs in biology class.

103
0:05:08.083,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Well it turns out it can do a lot more than just that.

104
0:05:10.875,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And it's a really key component

105
0:05:12.958,000 --> 0:05:14,000
to making these tiny copper wires.

106
0:05:16.208,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You see, the electrons on formaldehyde have a drive.

107
0:05:19.583,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They want to jump over to those positively charged copper spheres.

108
0:05:24.5,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And that's all because of a process known as redox chemistry.

109
0:05:28.792,000 --> 0:05:29,000
And when that happens,

110
0:05:30.083,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we can take these positively charged copper spheres

111
0:05:33.792,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and turn them into bright,

112
0:05:36.25,000 --> 0:05:4,000
shiny, metallic and conductive copper.

113
0:05:40.708,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And once we have conductive copper,

114
0:05:42.958,000 --> 0:05:43,000
now we're cooking with gas.

115
0:05:44.458,000 --> 0:05:46,000
And we can get all of those electrical components

116
0:05:46.792,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to talk to each other.

117
0:05:48.083,000 --> 0:05:5,000
So thank you once again to chemistry.

118
0:05:51.625,000 --> 0:05:52,000
And let's take a thought

119
0:05:53.25,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and think about how far we've come with chemistry.

120
0:05:57.583,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Clearly, in electronic communications,

121
0:06:00.292,000 --> 0:06:01,000
size matters.

122
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So let's think about how we can shrink down our devices,

123
0:06:05.458,000 --> 0:06:08,000
so that we can go from our 1990s Zack Morris cell phone

124
0:06:09.042,000 --> 0:06:1,000
to something a little bit more sleek,

125
0:06:10.917,000 --> 0:06:13,000
like the phones of today that can fit in our pockets.

126
0:06:13.958,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Although, let's be real here:

127
0:06:15.5,000 --> 0:06:18,000
absolutely nothing can fit into ladies' pants pockets,

128
0:06:19.375,000 --> 0:06:21,000
if you can find a pair of pants that has pockets.

129
0:06:22.375,000 --> 0:06:23,000
(Laughter)

130
0:06:23.417,000 --> 0:06:26,000
And I don't think chemistry can help us with that problem.

131
0:06:28.833,000 --> 0:06:31,000
But more important than shrinking the actual device,

132
0:06:32.083,000 --> 0:06:34,000
how do we shrink the circuitry inside of it,

133
0:06:34.5,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and shrink it by 100 times,

134
0:06:36.458,000 --> 0:06:39,000
so that we can take the circuitry from the micron scale

135
0:06:39.875,000 --> 0:06:4,000
all the way down to the nanometer scale?

136
0:06:42.833,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Because, let's face it,

137
0:06:44.125,000 --> 0:06:47,000
right now we all want more powerful and faster phones.

138
0:06:47.75,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Well, more power and faster requires more circuitry.

139
0:06:53.333,000 --> 0:06:54,000
So how do we do this?

140
0:06:55.042,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's not like we have some magic electromagnetic shrink ray,

141
0:06:58.792,000 --> 0:07:01,000
like professor Wayne Szalinski used in "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"

142
0:07:01.875,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to shrink his children.

143
0:07:03.25,000 --> 0:07:04,000
On accident, of course.

144
0:07:05.792,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Or do we?

145
0:07:07.958,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Well, actually, in the field,

146
0:07:09.75,000 --> 0:07:11,000
there's a process that's pretty similar to that.

147
0:07:12.5,000 --> 0:07:14,000
And it's name is photolithography.

148
0:07:15.417,000 --> 0:07:18,000
In photolithography, we take electromagnetic radiation,

149
0:07:18.792,000 --> 0:07:19,000
or what we tend to call light,

150
0:07:20.792,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and we use it to shrink down some of that circuitry,

151
0:07:23.458,000 --> 0:07:26,000
so that we could cram more of it into a really small space.

152
0:07:29.583,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Now, how does this work?

153
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Well, we start with a substrate

154
0:07:33.958,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that has a light-sensitive film on it.

155
0:07:36.917,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We then cover it with a mask that has a pattern on top of it

156
0:07:40.5,000 --> 0:07:41,000
of fine lines and features

157
0:07:42.083,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that are going to make the phone work the way that we want it to.

158
0:07:45.917,000 --> 0:07:48,000
We then expose a bright light and shine it through this mask,

159
0:07:49.667,000 --> 0:07:52,000
which creates a shadow of that pattern on the surface.

160
0:07:53.875,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Now, anywhere that the light can get through the mask,

161
0:07:56.833,000 --> 0:07:59,000
it's going to cause a chemical reaction to occur.

162
0:08:00.125,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And that's going to burn the image of that pattern into the substrate.

163
0:08:04.708,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So the question you're probably asking is,

164
0:08:06.833,000 --> 0:08:07,000
how do we go from a burned image

165
0:08:08.792,000 --> 0:08:11,000
to clean fine lines and features?

166
0:08:11.875,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And for that, we have to use a chemical solution

167
0:08:14.5,000 --> 0:08:15,000
called the developer.

168
0:08:16.125,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Now the developer is special.

169
0:08:18.167,000 --> 0:08:21,000
What it can do is take all of the nonexposed areas

170
0:08:21.75,000 --> 0:08:22,000
and remove them selectively,

171
0:08:23.708,000 --> 0:08:25,000
leaving behind clean fine lines and features,

172
0:08:26.667,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and making our miniaturized devices work.

173
0:08:30.417,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So, we've used chemistry now to build up our devices,

174
0:08:34.125,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and we've used it to shrink down our devices.

175
0:08:37.5,000 --> 0:08:4,000
So I've probably convinced you that chemistry is the true hero,

176
0:08:40.708,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and we could wrap it up there.

177
0:08:42.701,000 --> 0:08:43,000
(Applause)

178
0:08:43.875,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Hold on, we're not done.

179
0:08:45.417,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Not so fast.

180
0:08:47.042,000 --> 0:08:48,000
Because we're all human.

181
0:08:48.917,000 --> 0:08:5,000
And as a human, I always want more.

182
0:08:51.542,000 --> 0:08:53,000
And so now I want to think about how to use chemistry

183
0:08:54.25,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to extract more out of a device.

184
0:08:57.833,000 --> 0:09:,000
Right now, we're being told that we want something called 5G,

185
0:09:01.833,000 --> 0:09:03,000
or the promised fifth generation of wireless.

186
0:09:05.458,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Now, you might have heard of 5G

187
0:09:07.583,000 --> 0:09:09,000
in commercials that are starting to appear.

188
0:09:10.708,000 --> 0:09:11,000
Or maybe some of you even experienced it

189
0:09:12.708,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in the 2018 winter Olympics.

190
0:09:15.875,000 --> 0:09:17,000
What I'm most excited about for 5G

191
0:09:18.25,000 --> 0:09:21,000
is that, when I'm late, running out of the house to catch a plane,

192
0:09:21.958,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I can download movies onto my device in 40 seconds

193
0:09:25.125,000 --> 0:09:26,000
as opposed to 40 minutes.

194
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:29,000
But once true 5G is here,

195
0:09:29.833,000 --> 0:09:31,000
it's going to be a lot more than how many movies

196
0:09:32.125,000 --> 0:09:33,000
we can put on our device.

197
0:09:34.458,000 --> 0:09:37,000
So the question is, why is true 5G not here?

198
0:09:38.375,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And I'll let you in on a little secret.

199
0:09:40.375,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It's pretty easy to answer.

200
0:09:42.875,000 --> 0:09:43,000
It's just plain hard to do.

201
0:09:45.833,000 --> 0:09:47,000
You see, if you use those traditional materials and copper

202
0:09:48.708,000 --> 0:09:49,000
to build 5G devices,

203
0:09:50.625,000 --> 0:09:53,000
the signal can't make it to its final destination.

204
0:09:55.833,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Traditionally, we use really rough insulating layers

205
0:10:00.375,000 --> 0:10:02,000
to support copper wires.

206
0:10:02.917,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Think about Velcro fasteners.

207
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:09,000
It's the roughness of the two pieces that make them stick together.

208
0:10:10.208,000 --> 0:10:12,000
That's pretty important if you want to have a device

209
0:10:12.667,000 --> 0:10:13,000
that's going to last longer

210
0:10:14,000 --> 0:10:16,000
than it takes you to rip it out of the box

211
0:10:16.042,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and start installing all of your apps on it.

212
0:10:19.25,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But this roughness causes a problem.

213
0:10:21.958,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You see, at the high speeds for 5G

214
0:10:25.417,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the signal has to travel close to that roughness.

215
0:10:29.208,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And it makes it get lost before it reaches its final destination.

216
0:10:34.292,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Think about a mountain range.

217
0:10:36.042,000 --> 0:10:39,000
And you have a complex system of roads that goes up and over it,

218
0:10:39.542,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and you're trying to get to the other side.

219
0:10:42.292,000 --> 0:10:43,000
Don't you agree with me

220
0:10:43.583,000 --> 0:10:46,000
that it would probably take a really long time,

221
0:10:47,000 --> 0:10:49,000
and you would probably get lost,

222
0:10:49.083,000 --> 0:10:51,000
if you had to go up and down all of the mountains,

223
0:10:51.75,000 --> 0:10:53,000
as opposed to if you just drilled a flat tunnel

224
0:10:54.167,000 --> 0:10:56,000
that could go straight on through?

225
0:10:56.625,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Well it's the same thing in our 5G devices.

226
0:10:59.333,000 --> 0:11:01,000
If we could remove this roughness,

227
0:11:01.708,000 --> 0:11:02,000
then we can send the 5G signal

228
0:11:03.583,000 --> 0:11:05,000
straight on through uninterrupted.

229
0:11:05.625,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Sounds pretty good, right?

230
0:11:07.792,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But hold on.

231
0:11:09.083,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Didn't I just tell you that we needed that roughness

232
0:11:11.583,000 --> 0:11:12,000
to keep the device together?

233
0:11:13,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And if we remove it, we're in a situation where now the copper

234
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:18,000
isn't going to stick to that underlying substrate.

235
0:11:19.583,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Think about building a house of Lego blocks,

236
0:11:22.458,000 --> 0:11:26,000
with all of the nooks and crannies that latch together,

237
0:11:26.708,000 --> 0:11:28,000
as opposed to smooth building blocks.

238
0:11:29.375,000 --> 0:11:32,000
Which of the two is going to have more structural integrity

239
0:11:32.708,000 --> 0:11:34,000
when the two-year-old comes ripping through the living room,

240
0:11:35.583,000 --> 0:11:37,000
trying to play Godzilla and knock everything down?

241
0:11:39.375,000 --> 0:11:41,000
But what if we put glue on those smooth blocks?

242
0:11:43.125,000 --> 0:11:45,000
And that's what the industry is waiting for.

243
0:11:45.875,000 --> 0:11:48,000
They're waiting for the chemists to design new, smooth surfaces

244
0:11:49,000 --> 0:11:51,000
with increased inherent adhesion

245
0:11:51.542,000 --> 0:11:53,000
for some of those copper wires.

246
0:11:54.457,000 --> 0:11:55,000
And when we solve this problem,

247
0:11:55.958,000 --> 0:11:56,000
and we will solve the problem,

248
0:11:57.667,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and we'll work with physicists and engineers

249
0:11:59.917,000 --> 0:12:02,000
to solve all of the challenges of 5G,

250
0:12:03.125,000 --> 0:12:06,000
well then the number of applications is going to skyrocket.

251
0:12:06.625,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So yeah, we'll have things like self-driving cars,

252
0:12:09.542,000 --> 0:12:12,000
because now our data networks can handle the speeds

253
0:12:13.208,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and the amount of information required to make that work.

254
0:12:16.667,000 --> 0:12:18,000
But let's start to use imagination.

255
0:12:19.542,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I can imagine going into a restaurant with a friend that has a peanut allergy,

256
0:12:23.708,000 --> 0:12:24,000
taking out my phone,

257
0:12:25.5,000 --> 0:12:26,000
waving it over the food

258
0:12:26.875,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and having the food tell us

259
0:12:29.083,000 --> 0:12:32,000
a really important answer to a question --

260
0:12:32.333,000 --> 0:12:34,000
deadly or safe to consume?

261
0:12:35.875,000 --> 0:12:37,000
Or maybe our devices will get so good

262
0:12:38.875,000 --> 0:12:41,000
at processing information about us,

263
0:12:41.917,000 --> 0:12:43,000
that they'll become like our personal trainers.

264
0:12:44.917,000 --> 0:12:47,000
And they'll know the most efficient way for us to burn calories.

265
0:12:48.208,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I know come November,

266
0:12:49.542,000 --> 0:12:51,000
when I'm trying to burn off some of these pregnancy pounds,

267
0:12:52.333,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I would love a device that could tell me how to do that.

268
0:12:56.542,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I really don't know another way of saying it,

269
0:12:59,000 --> 0:13:01,000
except chemistry is just cool.

270
0:13:01.167,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And it enables all of these electronic devices.

271
0:13:05.042,000 --> 0:13:08,000
So the next time you send a text or take a selfie,

272
0:13:09.042,000 --> 0:13:11,000
think about all those atoms that are hard at work

273
0:13:11.583,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and the innovation that came before them.

274
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:16,000
Who knows,

275
0:13:16.292,000 --> 0:13:18,000
maybe even some of you listening to this talk,

276
0:13:18.625,000 --> 0:13:2,000
perhaps even on your mobile device,

277
0:13:20.708,000 --> 0:13:22,000
will decide that you too want to play sidekick

278
0:13:23.167,000 --> 0:13:24,000
to Captain Chemistry,

279
0:13:24.5,000 --> 0:13:27,000
the true hero of electronic devices.

280
0:13:28.333,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Thank you for your attention,

281
0:13:29.958,000 --> 0:13:3,000
and thank you chemistry.

282
0:13:31.583,000 --> 0:13:34,000
(Applause)

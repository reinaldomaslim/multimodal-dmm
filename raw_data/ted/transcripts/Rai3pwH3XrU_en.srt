0:00:40.201,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Constant weight, 123 meters,

8
0:00:43.865,000 --> 0:00:45,000
three minutes and 25 seconds.

9
0:00:46.147,000 --> 0:00:48,000
National record attempt.

10
0:01:19.834,000 --> 0:01:2,000
70 meters.

11
0:01:32.056,000 --> 0:01:34,000
[123 meters]

0:02:21.166,000 --> 0:02:23,000

(Video) Judge: White card. Guillaume Néry! National record!

14
0:02:29.745,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Guillaume Néry: Thank you.

15
0:02:31.015,000 --> 0:02:34,000
(Applause)

16
0:02:34.84,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Thank you very much, thanks for the warm welcome.

17
0:02:37.418,000 --> 0:02:4,000
That dive you just watched is a journey --

18
0:02:40.646,000 --> 0:02:42,000
a journey between two breaths.

19
0:02:43.367,000 --> 0:02:45,000
A journey that takes place between two breaths --

20
0:02:45.686,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the last one before diving into the water,

21
0:02:47.964,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and the first one, coming back to the surface.

22
0:02:51.394,000 --> 0:02:55,000
That dive is a journey to the very limits of human possibility,

23
0:02:55.792,000 --> 0:02:56,000
a journey into the unknown.

24
0:02:58.315,000 --> 0:03:01,000
But it's also, and above all, an inner journey,

25
0:03:01.87,000 --> 0:03:03,000
where a number of things happen,

26
0:03:04.288,000 --> 0:03:06,000
physiologically as well as mentally.

27
0:03:06.641,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And that's why I'm here today,

28
0:03:08.681,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to share my journey with you and to take you along with me.

29
0:03:12.038,000 --> 0:03:14,000
So, we start with the last breath.

30
0:03:15.987,000 --> 0:03:18,000
(Breathing in)

31
0:03:29.279,000 --> 0:03:3,000
(Breathing out)

32
0:03:31.143,000 --> 0:03:35,000
As you noticed, that last breath in is slow, deep and intense.

33
0:03:35.61,000 --> 0:03:37,000
It ends with a special technique called the carp,

34
0:03:38.19,000 --> 0:03:41,000
which allows me to store one to two extra liters of air in my lungs

35
0:03:41.855,000 --> 0:03:43,000
by compressing it.

36
0:03:43.992,000 --> 0:03:47,000
When I leave the surface, I have about 10 liters of air in my lungs.

37
0:03:49.539,000 --> 0:03:52,000
As soon as I leave the surface the first mechanism kicks in:

38
0:03:53.084,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the diving reflex.

39
0:03:54.544,000 --> 0:03:58,000
The first thing the diving reflex does is make your heart rate drop.

40
0:03:59.452,000 --> 0:04:01,000
My heart beat will drop from about 60-70 per minute

41
0:04:02.309,000 --> 0:04:03,000
to about 30-40 beats per minute

42
0:04:04.113,000 --> 0:04:06,000
in a matter of seconds; almost immediately.

43
0:04:07.058,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Next, the diving reflex causes peripheral vasoconstriction,

44
0:04:10.171,000 --> 0:04:14,000
which means that the blood flow will leave the body's extremities

45
0:04:14.365,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to feed the most important organs:

46
0:04:18.382,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the lungs, the heart and the brain.

47
0:04:22.602,000 --> 0:04:25,000
This mechanism is innate.

48
0:04:26.11,000 --> 0:04:27,000
I cannot control it.

49
0:04:27.55,000 --> 0:04:29,000
If you go underwater, even if you've never done it before,

50
0:04:30.366,000 --> 0:04:32,000
you'll experience the exact same effects.

51
0:04:32.735,000 --> 0:04:35,000
All human beings share this characteristic.

52
0:04:36.382,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And what's extraordinary

53
0:04:38.332,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is that we share this instinct with marine mammals --

54
0:04:41.873,000 --> 0:04:44,000
all marine mammals: dolphins, whales, sea lions, etc.

55
0:04:45.555,000 --> 0:04:49,000
When they dive deep into the ocean, these mechanisms become activated,

56
0:04:50.175,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but to a greater extent.

57
0:04:51.532,000 --> 0:04:53,000
And, of course, it works much better for them.

58
0:04:55.97,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It's absolutely fascinating.

59
0:04:57.388,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Right as I leave the surface,

60
0:04:58.838,000 --> 0:05:,000
nature gives me a push in the right direction,

61
0:05:01.171,000 --> 0:05:03,000
allowing me to descend with confidence.

62
0:05:03.587,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So as I dive deeper into the blue,

63
0:05:05.627,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the pressure slowly starts to squeeze my lungs.

64
0:05:10.338,000 --> 0:05:13,000
And since it's the amount of air in my lungs that makes me float,

65
0:05:13.613,000 --> 0:05:15,000
the farther down I go, the more pressure there is on my lungs,

66
0:05:16.565,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the less air they contain and the easier it is for my body to fall.

67
0:05:20.192,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And at one point, around 35 or 40 meters down,

68
0:05:23.019,000 --> 0:05:25,000
I don't even need to swim.

69
0:05:26.468,000 --> 0:05:3,000
My body is dense and heavy enough to fall into the depths by itself,

70
0:05:31.263,000 --> 0:05:33,000
and I enter what's called the free fall phase.

71
0:05:33.882,000 --> 0:05:35,000
The free fall phase is the best part of the dive.

72
0:05:36.628,000 --> 0:05:37,000
It's the reason I still dive.

73
0:05:38.53,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Because it feels like you're being pulled down

74
0:05:43.401,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and you don't need to do anything.

75
0:05:45.122,000 --> 0:05:48,000
I can go from 35 meters to 123 meters without making a single movement.

76
0:05:49.04,000 --> 0:05:5,000
I let myself be pulled by the depths,

77
0:05:51.006,000 --> 0:05:52,000
and it feels like I'm flying underwater.

78
0:05:52.968,000 --> 0:05:55,000
It's truly an amazing feeling -- an extraordinary feeling of freedom.

79
0:05:56.975,000 --> 0:05:58,000
And so I slowly continue sliding to the bottom.

80
0:05:59.982,000 --> 0:06:,000
40 meters down,

81
0:06:01.286,000 --> 0:06:02,000
50 meters down,

82
0:06:02.607,000 --> 0:06:06,000
and between 50 and 60 meters, a second physiological response kicks in.

83
0:06:07.702,000 --> 0:06:09,000
My lungs reach residual volume,

84
0:06:10.242,000 --> 0:06:14,000
below which they're not supposed to be compressed, in theory.

85
0:06:15.205,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And this second response is called blood shift,

86
0:06:18.755,000 --> 0:06:2,000
or "pulmonary erection" in French.

87
0:06:22.236,000 --> 0:06:23,000
I prefer "blood shift."

88
0:06:23.569,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Laughter)

89
0:06:24.75,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So blood shift -- how does it work?

90
0:06:27.519,000 --> 0:06:31,000
The capillaries in the lungs become engorged with blood --

91
0:06:32.117,000 --> 0:06:33,000
which is caused by the suction --

92
0:06:33.734,000 --> 0:06:34,000
so the lungs can harden

93
0:06:35.469,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and protect the whole chest cavity from being crushed.

94
0:06:38.165,000 --> 0:06:41,000
It prevents the two walls of the lungs from collapsing,

95
0:06:42.092,000 --> 0:06:43,000
from sticking together and caving in.

96
0:06:44.078,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Thanks to this phenomenon, which we also share with marine mammals,

97
0:06:47.991,000 --> 0:06:48,000
I'm able to continue with my dive.

98
0:06:49.718,000 --> 0:06:52,000
60, 70 meters down, I keep falling, faster and faster,

99
0:06:53.318,000 --> 0:06:55,000
because the pressure is crushing my body more and more.

100
0:06:56.254,000 --> 0:06:57,000
Below 80 meters,

101
0:06:58.355,000 --> 0:07:,000
the pressure becomes a lot stronger,

102
0:07:00.394,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and I start to feel it physically.

103
0:07:02.489,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I really start to feel the suffocation.

104
0:07:04.518,000 --> 0:07:06,000
You can see what it looks like -- not pretty at all.

105
0:07:07.002,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The diaphragm is completely collapsed, the rib cage is squeezed in,

106
0:07:11.824,000 --> 0:07:13,000
and mentally, there is something going on as well.

107
0:07:14.331,000 --> 0:07:16,000
You may be thinking, "This doesn't look enjoyable.

108
0:07:17.122,000 --> 0:07:18,000
How do you do it?"

109
0:07:18.445,000 --> 0:07:19,000
If I relied on my earthly reflexes --

110
0:07:20.27,000 --> 0:07:23,000
what do we do above water when there's a problem?

111
0:07:23.757,000 --> 0:07:25,000
We resist, we go against it.

112
0:07:25.99,000 --> 0:07:26,000
We fight.

113
0:07:27.357,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Underwater, that doesn't work.

114
0:07:28.913,000 --> 0:07:3,000
If you try that underwater, you might tear your lungs,

115
0:07:31.529,000 --> 0:07:32,000
spit up blood, develop an edema

116
0:07:33.119,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and you'll have to stop diving for a good amount of time.

117
0:07:36.278,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So what you need to do, mentally, is to tell yourself

118
0:07:39.476,000 --> 0:07:41,000
that nature and the elements are stronger than you.

119
0:07:42.27,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And so I let the water crush me.

120
0:07:44.92,000 --> 0:07:46,000
I accept the pressure and go with it.

121
0:07:48.481,000 --> 0:07:5,000
At this point, my body receives this information,

122
0:07:50.849,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and my lungs start relaxing.

123
0:07:52.731,000 --> 0:07:55,000
I relinquish all control, and relax completely.

124
0:07:55.898,000 --> 0:07:58,000
The pressure starts crushing me, and it doesn't feel bad at all.

125
0:07:59.772,000 --> 0:08:02,000
I even feel like I'm in a cocoon, protected.

126
0:08:03.106,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And the dive continues.

127
0:08:05.702,000 --> 0:08:06,000
80, 85 meters down,

128
0:08:07.424,000 --> 0:08:08,000
90,

129
0:08:08.667,000 --> 0:08:09,000
100.

130
0:08:09.874,000 --> 0:08:11,000
100 meters -- the magic number.

131
0:08:13.024,000 --> 0:08:14,000
In every sport, it's a magic number.

132
0:08:14.91,000 --> 0:08:16,000
For swimmers and athletes and also for us, free divers,

133
0:08:17.764,000 --> 0:08:18,000
it's a number everyone dreams of.

134
0:08:19.434,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Everyone wishes one day to be able to get to 100 meters.

135
0:08:22.856,000 --> 0:08:23,000
And it's a symbolic number for us,

136
0:08:24.665,000 --> 0:08:27,000
because in the 1970s, doctors and physiologists did their math,

137
0:08:28.556,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and predicted that the human body would not be able to go below 100 meters.

138
0:08:33.889,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Below that, they said, the human body would implode.

139
0:08:36.769,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And then the Frenchman, Jacques Mayol --

140
0:08:38.905,000 --> 0:08:4,000
you all know him as the hero in "The Big Blue" --

141
0:08:41.222,000 --> 0:08:44,000
came along and dived down to 100 meters.

142
0:08:44.499,000 --> 0:08:45,000
He even reached 105 meters.

143
0:08:46.088,000 --> 0:08:47,000
At that time, he was doing "no limits."

144
0:08:48.008,000 --> 0:08:51,000
He'd use weights to descend faster and come back up with a balloon,

145
0:08:51.381,000 --> 0:08:52,000
just like in the movie.

146
0:08:52.577,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Today, we go down 200 meters in no limit free diving.

147
0:08:55.179,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I can do 123 meters by simply using muscle strength.

148
0:08:58.059,000 --> 0:09:01,000
And in a way, it's all thanks to him, because he challenged known facts,

149
0:09:01.814,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and with a sweep of his hand, got rid of the theoretical beliefs

150
0:09:06.205,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and all the mental limits that we like to impose on ourselves.

151
0:09:09.63,000 --> 0:09:12,000
He showed us that the human body has an infinite ability to adapt.

152
0:09:13.27,000 --> 0:09:14,000
So I carry on with my dive.

153
0:09:15.013,000 --> 0:09:17,000
105, 110, 115.

154
0:09:17.171,000 --> 0:09:18,000
The bottom is getting closer.

155
0:09:18.965,000 --> 0:09:19,000
120,

156
0:09:20.465,000 --> 0:09:21,000
123 meters.

157
0:09:21.679,000 --> 0:09:22,000
I'm at the bottom.

158
0:09:22.982,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And now, I'd like to ask you to join me and put yourself in my place.

159
0:09:26.616,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Close your eyes.

160
0:09:28.752,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Imagine you get to 123 meters.

161
0:09:33.541,000 --> 0:09:35,000
The surface is far, far away.

162
0:09:36.72,000 --> 0:09:37,000
You're alone.

163
0:09:39.864,000 --> 0:09:4,000
There's hardly any light.

164
0:09:42.324,000 --> 0:09:43,000
It's cold --

165
0:09:43.603,000 --> 0:09:44,000
freezing cold.

166
0:09:44.984,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The pressure is crushing you completely --

167
0:09:47.061,000 --> 0:09:49,000
13 times stronger than on the surface.

168
0:09:50.214,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And I know what you're thinking:

169
0:09:52.147,000 --> 0:09:53,000
"This is horrible.

170
0:09:54.12,000 --> 0:09:55,000
What the hell am I doing here?

171
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:57,000
He's insane."

172
0:09:58.484,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But no.

173
0:10:00.031,000 --> 0:10:02,000
That's not what I think when I'm down there.

174
0:10:02.315,000 --> 0:10:03,000
When I'm at the bottom, I feel good.

175
0:10:04.064,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I get this extraordinary feeling of well-being.

176
0:10:06.345,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Maybe it's because I've completely released all tensions

177
0:10:09.258,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and let myself go.

178
0:10:11.003,000 --> 0:10:14,000
I feel great, without the need to breathe.

179
0:10:17.238,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Although, you'd agree, I should be worried.

180
0:10:21.999,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I feel like a tiny dot, a little drop of water,

181
0:10:24.346,000 --> 0:10:25,000
floating in the middle of the ocean.

182
0:10:26.22,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And each time, I picture the same image.

183
0:10:29.736,000 --> 0:10:31,000
[The Pale Blue Dot]

184
0:10:32.473,000 --> 0:10:34,000
It's that small dot the arrow is pointing to.

185
0:10:34.951,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Do you know what it is?

186
0:10:37.48,000 --> 0:10:38,000
It's planet Earth.

187
0:10:39.478,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Planet Earth, photographed by the Voyager probe,

188
0:10:42.163,000 --> 0:10:44,000
from 4 billion kilometers away.

189
0:10:44.339,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And it shows that our home is that small dot over there,

190
0:10:48.459,000 --> 0:10:49,000
floating in the middle of nothing.

191
0:10:50.126,000 --> 0:10:51,000
That's how I feel

192
0:10:52.071,000 --> 0:10:54,000
when I'm at the bottom, at 123 meters.

193
0:10:54.246,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I feel like a small dot,

194
0:10:55.985,000 --> 0:10:57,000
a speck of dust, stardust,

195
0:10:58.564,000 --> 0:11:,000
floating in the middle of the cosmos,

196
0:11:00.803,000 --> 0:11:02,000
in the middle of nothing, in the immensity of space.

197
0:11:03.271,000 --> 0:11:04,000
It's a fascinating sensation,

198
0:11:04.736,000 --> 0:11:08,000
because when I look up, down, left, right, in front, behind,

199
0:11:08.815,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I see the same thing: the infinite deep blue.

200
0:11:12.03,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Nowhere else on Earth you can experience this --

201
0:11:15.07,000 --> 0:11:18,000
looking all around you, and seeing the same thing.

202
0:11:18.657,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It's extraordinary.

203
0:11:20.562,000 --> 0:11:21,000
And at that moment,

204
0:11:22.026,000 --> 0:11:25,000
I still get that feeling each time, building up inside of me --

205
0:11:25.051,000 --> 0:11:27,000
the feeling of humility.

206
0:11:28.875,000 --> 0:11:3,000
Looking at this picture, I feel very humble --

207
0:11:31.805,000 --> 0:11:33,000
just like when I'm all the way down at the bottom --

208
0:11:34.36,000 --> 0:11:35,000
because I'm nothing,

209
0:11:35.661,000 --> 0:11:38,000
I'm a little speck of nothingness lost in all of time and space.

210
0:11:39.652,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And it still is absolutely fascinating.

211
0:11:42.66,000 --> 0:11:45,000
I decide to go back to the surface, because this is not where I belong.

212
0:11:46.487,000 --> 0:11:48,000
I belong up there, on the surface.

213
0:11:48.74,000 --> 0:11:5,000
So I start heading back up.

214
0:11:52.018,000 --> 0:11:56,000
I get something of a shock

215
0:11:56.293,000 --> 0:11:58,000
at the very moment when I decide to go up.

216
0:11:58.78,000 --> 0:12:01,000
First, because it takes a huge effort to tear yourself away from the bottom.

217
0:12:02.711,000 --> 0:12:04,000
It pulled you down on the way in,

218
0:12:05.215,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and will do the same on the way up.

219
0:12:07.122,000 --> 0:12:08,000
You have to swim twice as hard.

220
0:12:10.48,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Then, I'm hit with another phenomenon known as narcosis.

221
0:12:13.522,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I don't know if you've heard of that.

222
0:12:15.318,000 --> 0:12:17,000
It's called nitrogen narcosis.

223
0:12:17.469,000 --> 0:12:19,000
It's something that happens to scuba divers,

224
0:12:19.63,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but it can happen to free divers.

225
0:12:21.273,000 --> 0:12:24,000
It's caused by nitrogen dissolving in the blood,

226
0:12:24.826,000 --> 0:12:25,000
which causes confusion

227
0:12:26.744,000 --> 0:12:28,000
between the conscious and unconscious mind.

228
0:12:30.212,000 --> 0:12:34,000
A flurry of thoughts goes spinning through your head.

229
0:12:34.443,000 --> 0:12:36,000
You can't control them, and you shouldn't try to --

230
0:12:37.463,000 --> 0:12:38,000
you have to let it happen.

231
0:12:39.071,000 --> 0:12:42,000
The more you try to control it, the harder it is to manage.

232
0:12:43.223,000 --> 0:12:44,000
Then, a third thing happens:

233
0:12:44.715,000 --> 0:12:45,000
the desire to breathe.

234
0:12:46.008,000 --> 0:12:48,000
I'm not a fish, I'm a human being,

235
0:12:48.342,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and the desire to breathe reminds me of that fact.

236
0:12:51.887,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Around 60, 70 meters,

237
0:12:55.551,000 --> 0:12:57,000
you start to feel the need to breathe.

238
0:12:59.65,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And with everything else that's going on,

239
0:13:02.11,000 --> 0:13:04,000
you can very easily lose your ground

240
0:13:05.071,000 --> 0:13:06,000
and start to panic.

241
0:13:07.871,000 --> 0:13:09,000
When that happens, you think, "Where's the surface?

242
0:13:10.316,000 --> 0:13:11,000
I want to go up. I want to breathe now."

243
0:13:12.275,000 --> 0:13:13,000
You should not do that.

244
0:13:13.931,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Never look up to the surface --

245
0:13:15.789,000 --> 0:13:17,000
not with your eyes, or your mind.

246
0:13:19.161,000 --> 0:13:21,000
You should never picture yourself up there.

247
0:13:21.914,000 --> 0:13:22,000
You have to stay in the present.

248
0:13:23.576,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I look at the rope right in front of me, leading me back to the surface.

249
0:13:28.834,000 --> 0:13:3,000
And I focus on that, on the present moment.

250
0:13:31.829,000 --> 0:13:33,000
Because if I think about the surface, I panic.

251
0:13:34.029,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And if I panic, it's over.

252
0:13:36.925,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Time goes faster this way.

253
0:13:39.16,000 --> 0:13:41,000
And at 30 meters: deliverance.

254
0:13:41.279,000 --> 0:13:42,000
I'm not alone any more.

255
0:13:42.707,000 --> 0:13:45,000
The safety divers, my guardian angels, join me.

256
0:13:46.13,000 --> 0:13:48,000
They leave the surface, we meet at 30 meters,

257
0:13:48.477,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and they escort me for the final few meters,

258
0:13:50.655,000 --> 0:13:52,000
where potential problems could arise.

259
0:13:53.881,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Every time I see them, I think to myself,

260
0:13:57.253,000 --> 0:13:58,000
"It's thanks to you."

261
0:13:58.865,000 --> 0:14:,000
It's thanks to them, my team, that I'm here.

262
0:14:00.985,000 --> 0:14:02,000
It brings back the sense of humility.

263
0:14:03.611,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Without my team, without all the people around me,

264
0:14:07.08,000 --> 0:14:09,000
the adventure into the deep would be impossible.

265
0:14:09.459,000 --> 0:14:12,000
A journey into the deep is above all a group effort.

266
0:14:13.359,000 --> 0:14:15,000
So I'm happy to finish my journey with them,

267
0:14:15.641,000 --> 0:14:17,000
because I wouldn't be here if it weren't for them.

268
0:14:18.159,000 --> 0:14:19,000
20 meters, 10 meters,

269
0:14:19.774,000 --> 0:14:21,000
my lungs slowly return to their normal volume.

270
0:14:22.045,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Buoyancy pushes me up to the surface.

271
0:14:24.416,000 --> 0:14:27,000
Five meters below the surface, I start to breathe out,

272
0:14:27.988,000 --> 0:14:3,000
so that as soon as I get to the surface all I do is breathe in.

273
0:14:31.277,000 --> 0:14:32,000
And so I arrive at the surface.

274
0:14:33.544,000 --> 0:14:35,000
(Breathing in)

275
0:14:39.667,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Air floods into my lungs.

276
0:14:41.685,000 --> 0:14:43,000
It's like being born again, a relief.

277
0:14:44.896,000 --> 0:14:45,000
It feels good.

278
0:14:46.075,000 --> 0:14:47,000
Though the journey was extraordinary,

279
0:14:47.965,000 --> 0:14:5,000
I do need to feel those small oxygen molecules fueling my body.

280
0:14:52.385,000 --> 0:14:55,000
It's an extraordinary sensation, but at the same time it's traumatizing.

281
0:14:55.994,000 --> 0:14:57,000
It's a shock to the system, as you can you imagine.

282
0:14:58.415,000 --> 0:15:,000
I go from complete darkness to the light of day,

283
0:15:01.212,000 --> 0:15:05,000
from the near-silence of the depths to the commotion up top.

284
0:15:06.388,000 --> 0:15:1,000
In terms of touch, I go from the soft, velvety feeling of the water,

285
0:15:10.945,000 --> 0:15:12,000
to air rubbing across my face.

286
0:15:13.271,000 --> 0:15:15,000
In terms of smell,

287
0:15:16.272,000 --> 0:15:18,000
there is air rushing into my lungs.

288
0:15:18.932,000 --> 0:15:2,000
And in return, my lungs open up.

289
0:15:21.368,000 --> 0:15:23,000
They were completely squashed just 90 seconds ago,

290
0:15:23.935,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and now, they've opened up again.

291
0:15:25.647,000 --> 0:15:28,000
So all of this affects quite a lot of things.

292
0:15:29.507,000 --> 0:15:31,000
I need a few seconds to come back,

293
0:15:31.851,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and to feel "all there" again.

294
0:15:33.454,000 --> 0:15:34,000
But that needs to happen quickly,

295
0:15:35.06,000 --> 0:15:38,000
because the judges are there to verify my performance;

296
0:15:38.196,000 --> 0:15:4,000
I need to show them I'm in perfect physical condition.

297
0:15:40.805,000 --> 0:15:42,000
You saw in the video, I was doing a so-called exit protocol.

298
0:15:43.681,000 --> 0:15:47,000
Once at the surface, I have 15 seconds to take off my nose clip,

299
0:15:48.684,000 --> 0:15:5,000
give this signal and say (English) "I am OK."

300
0:15:51.989,000 --> 0:15:52,000
Plus, you need to be bilingual.

301
0:15:53.511,000 --> 0:15:54,000
(Laughter)

302
0:15:54.977,000 --> 0:15:55,000
On top of everything --

303
0:15:56.167,000 --> 0:15:57,000
that's not very nice.

304
0:15:58.897,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Once the protocol is completed, the judges show me a white card,

305
0:16:02.572,000 --> 0:16:03,000
and that's when the joy starts.

306
0:16:04.501,000 --> 0:16:06,000
I can finally celebrate what has just happened.

307
0:16:07.976,000 --> 0:16:09,000
So, the journey I've just described to you

308
0:16:10.278,000 --> 0:16:13,000
is a more extreme version of free diving.

309
0:16:13.921,000 --> 0:16:15,000
Luckily, it's far from just that.

310
0:16:16.136,000 --> 0:16:17,000
For the past few years,

311
0:16:17.367,000 --> 0:16:19,000
I've been trying to show another side of free diving,

312
0:16:20.078,000 --> 0:16:23,000
because the media mainly talks about competitions and records.

313
0:16:23.209,000 --> 0:16:24,000
But free diving is more than just that.

314
0:16:25.114,000 --> 0:16:26,000
It's about being at ease in the water.

315
0:16:27.066,000 --> 0:16:29,000
It's extremely beautiful, very poetic and artistic.

316
0:16:30.074,000 --> 0:16:32,000
So my wife and I decided to film it

317
0:16:32.162,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and try to show another side of it,

318
0:16:35.284,000 --> 0:16:37,000
mostly to make people want to go into the water.

319
0:16:38.089,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Let me show you some images to finish my story.

320
0:16:43.854,000 --> 0:16:45,000
It's a mix of beautiful underwater photos.

321
0:16:46.06,000 --> 0:16:47,000
(Music)

322
0:16:47.236,000 --> 0:16:52,000
I'd like you to know that if one day you try to stop breathing,

323
0:16:52.319,000 --> 0:16:54,000
you'll realize that when you stop breathing,

324
0:16:54.639,000 --> 0:16:56,000
you stop thinking, too.

325
0:16:57.355,000 --> 0:16:58,000
It calms your mind.

326
0:16:59.934,000 --> 0:17:02,000
Today, in the 21st century, we're under so much pressure.

327
0:17:03.244,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Our minds are overworked, we think at a million miles an hour,

328
0:17:06.295,000 --> 0:17:07,000
we're always stressed.

329
0:17:08.199,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Being able to free dive lets you, just for a moment,

330
0:17:11.227,000 --> 0:17:12,000
relax your mind.

331
0:17:13.362,000 --> 0:17:14,000
Holding your breath underwater

332
0:17:15.378,000 --> 0:17:18,000
means giving yourself the chance to experience weightlessness.

333
0:17:19.398,000 --> 0:17:21,000
It means being underwater, floating,

334
0:17:22.376,000 --> 0:17:25,000
with your body completely relaxed, letting go of all your tensions.

335
0:17:26.223,000 --> 0:17:27,000
This is our plight in the 21st century:

336
0:17:28.126,000 --> 0:17:3,000
our backs hurt, our necks hurt, everything hurts,

337
0:17:30.467,000 --> 0:17:32,000
because we're stressed and tense all the time.

338
0:17:32.7,000 --> 0:17:33,000
But when you're in the water,

339
0:17:34.153,000 --> 0:17:36,000
you let yourself float, as if you were in space.

340
0:17:37.151,000 --> 0:17:38,000
You let yourself go completely.

341
0:17:38.859,000 --> 0:17:39,000
It's an extraordinary feeling.

342
0:17:40.376,000 --> 0:17:45,000
You can finally get in touch with your body, mind and spirit.

343
0:17:46.476,000 --> 0:17:48,000
Everything feels better, all at once.

344
0:17:49.952,000 --> 0:17:53,000
Learning how to free dive is also about learning to breathe correctly.

345
0:17:54.718,000 --> 0:17:58,000
We breathe with our first breath at birth, up until our last one.

346
0:17:59.2,000 --> 0:18:02,000
Breathing gives rhythm to our lives.

347
0:18:02.778,000 --> 0:18:05,000
Learning how to breathe better is learning how to live better.

348
0:18:06.746,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Holding your breath in the sea, not necessarily at 100 meters,

349
0:18:09.905,000 --> 0:18:1,000
but maybe at two or three,

350
0:18:11.204,000 --> 0:18:13,000
putting on your goggles, a pair of flippers,

351
0:18:13.294,000 --> 0:18:14,000
means you can go see another world,

352
0:18:15.014,000 --> 0:18:17,000
another universe, completely magical.

353
0:18:17.096,000 --> 0:18:2,000
You can see little fish, seaweed, the flora and fauna,

354
0:18:20.525,000 --> 0:18:22,000
you can watch it all discreetly,

355
0:18:22.867,000 --> 0:18:25,000
sliding underwater, looking around, and coming back to the surface,

356
0:18:26.177,000 --> 0:18:27,000
leaving no trace.

357
0:18:28.096,000 --> 0:18:32,000
It's an amazing feeling to become one with nature like that.

358
0:18:33.219,000 --> 0:18:35,000
And if I may say one more thing,

359
0:18:36.509,000 --> 0:18:41,000
holding your breath, being in the water, finding this underwater world --

360
0:18:41.7,000 --> 0:18:42,000
it's all about connecting with yourself.

361
0:18:43.693,000 --> 0:18:47,000
You heard me talk a lot about the body's memory

362
0:18:48.621,000 --> 0:18:5,000
that dates back millions of years, to our marine origins.

363
0:18:51.546,000 --> 0:18:53,000
The day you get back into the water,

364
0:18:54.236,000 --> 0:18:56,000
when you hold your breath for a few seconds,

365
0:18:56.751,000 --> 0:18:58,000
you will reconnect with those origins.

366
0:19:00.243,000 --> 0:19:01,000
And I guarantee

367
0:19:01.786,000 --> 0:19:02,000
it's absolute magic.

368
0:19:03.151,000 --> 0:19:04,000
I encourage you to try it out.

369
0:19:04.628,000 --> 0:19:05,000
Thank you.

370
0:19:05.818,000 --> 0:19:08,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:16.33,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I'd like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort

2
0:00:19.68,000 --> 0:00:21,000
that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper.

3
0:00:22.384,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change;

4
0:00:25.757,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and like this when they have to do with air quality or smog.

5
0:00:28.627,000 --> 0:00:3,000
They're two branches of the same field of atmospheric science.

6
0:00:31.591,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Recently, the headlines looked like this

7
0:00:33.547,000 --> 0:00:35,000
when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC,

8
0:00:36.413,000 --> 0:00:37,000
put out their report

9
0:00:37.588,000 --> 0:00:39,000
on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system.

10
0:00:40.249,000 --> 0:00:42,000
That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries.

11
0:00:43.254,000 --> 0:00:45,000
They wrote almost 1,000 pages on the topic,

12
0:00:45.779,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and all of those pages were reviewed

13
0:00:47.547,000 --> 0:00:49,000
by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers

14
0:00:49.698,000 --> 0:00:5,000
from 113 countries.

15
0:00:51.416,000 --> 0:00:52,000
It's a big community;

16
0:00:52.706,000 --> 0:00:53,000
such a big community, in fact,

17
0:00:54.188,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world.

18
0:00:57.667,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that.

19
0:01:00.645,000 --> 0:01:02,000
Every one of those scientists is in a research group,

20
0:01:03.276,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and every research group studies a wide variety of topics.

21
0:01:06.029,000 --> 0:01:08,000
For us at Cambridge, it's as varied as the El Niño Oscillation,

22
0:01:09.027,000 --> 0:01:1,000
which affects weather and climate,

23
0:01:10.715,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to the assimilation of satellite data,

24
0:01:12.571,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to emissions from crops that produce biofuels, which is what I study.

25
0:01:15.854,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And in each one of these research areas, of which there are even more,

26
0:01:19.196,000 --> 0:01:22,000
there are PhD students, like me, and we study incredibly narrow topics,

27
0:01:22.58,000 --> 0:01:24,000
things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules.

28
0:01:25.201,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene, which is here.

29
0:01:28.439,000 --> 0:01:29,000
It's a small organic molecule.

30
0:01:30.11,000 --> 0:01:31,000
You've probably never heard of it.

31
0:01:31.778,000 --> 0:01:33,000
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal

32
0:01:34.204,000 --> 0:01:37,000
to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene.

33
0:01:37.859,000 --> 0:01:39,000
But despite its very small weight,

34
0:01:39.982,000 --> 0:01:41,000
enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year

35
0:01:42.562,000 --> 0:01:44,000
to equal the weight of all the people on the planet.

36
0:01:45.062,000 --> 0:01:48,000
It's a huge amount of stuff. It's equal to the weight of methane.

37
0:01:48.143,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And because it's so much stuff,

38
0:01:49.648,000 --> 0:01:51,000
it's really important for the atmospheric system.

39
0:01:51.986,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Because it's important to the atmospheric system,

40
0:01:54.306,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we go to all lengths to study this thing.

41
0:01:56.287,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We blow it up and look at the pieces.

42
0:01:58.082,000 --> 0:02:,000
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain.

43
0:02:00.114,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Atmospheric explosions, or full combustion,

44
0:02:02.162,000 --> 0:02:04,000
takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car.

45
0:02:05.096,000 --> 0:02:06,000
But still, we look at the pieces.

46
0:02:06.7,000 --> 0:02:09,000
We run enormous models on supercomputers; this is what I happen to do.

47
0:02:10.069,000 --> 0:02:12,000
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes

48
0:02:12.588,000 --> 0:02:15,000
calculating hundreds of variables each, on minute timescales.

49
0:02:15.619,000 --> 0:02:17,000
It takes weeks to perform our integrations,

50
0:02:17.699,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what's happening.

51
0:02:21.437,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing.

52
0:02:24.23,000 --> 0:02:27,000
I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia -- there are others.

53
0:02:27.435,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We found a global atmospheric watchtower there

54
0:02:29.658,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in the middle of the rainforest,

55
0:02:31.236,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of scientific equipment

56
0:02:34.663,000 --> 0:02:35,000
off this tower,

57
0:02:35.838,000 --> 0:02:37,000
to look for isoprene and other things while we were there.

58
0:02:38.628,000 --> 0:02:4,000
This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest from above,

59
0:02:41.527,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and the tower from below.

60
0:02:42.751,000 --> 0:02:45,000
On part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us.

61
0:02:45.966,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And this plane, the model BAe-146, which was run by FAAM,

62
0:02:48.657,000 --> 0:02:5,000
normally flies 120 to 130 people,

63
0:02:50.725,000 --> 0:02:52,000
so maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today.

64
0:02:53.334,000 --> 0:02:54,000
But we didn't just fly it.

65
0:02:54.61,000 --> 0:02:56,000
We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy

66
0:02:57.327,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff.

67
0:02:59.974,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We have to fly at a special incline to make the measurements;

68
0:03:02.891,000 --> 0:03:04,000
we hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering;

69
0:03:05.506,000 --> 0:03:06,000
we need special flight clearance.

70
0:03:07.134,000 --> 0:03:09,000
As you come around the banks in these valleys,

71
0:03:09.311,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the forces can get up to two Gs;

72
0:03:10.871,000 --> 0:03:12,000
the scientists must be completely harnessed in

73
0:03:13.055,000 --> 0:03:15,000
in order to make measurements while on board.

74
0:03:15.178,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So as you can imagine,

75
0:03:16.356,000 --> 0:03:19,000
the inside of the aircraft doesn't look like one you'd take on vacation.

76
0:03:19.787,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's a flying laboratory we took to make measurements of this molecule.

77
0:03:23.357,000 --> 0:03:26,000
We do all this to understand the chemistry of one molecule.

78
0:03:26.467,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And when one student like me has some sort of inclination

79
0:03:29.175,000 --> 0:03:3,000
or understanding about that molecule,

80
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:33,000
they write one scientific paper on the subject.

81
0:03:33.241,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And out of that field campaign we'll probably get a few dozen papers

82
0:03:36.485,000 --> 0:03:37,000
on a few dozen processes or molecules.

83
0:03:38.346,000 --> 0:03:4,000
As a body of knowledge builds up, it will form one subsection,

84
0:03:41.316,000 --> 0:03:42,000
or one sub-subsection,

85
0:03:42.491,000 --> 0:03:45,000
of an assessment like the IPCC, although we have others.

86
0:03:45.805,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections.

87
0:03:50.765,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So you can imagine the scale of the effort.

88
0:03:52.829,000 --> 0:03:55,000
In each one of the assessments we write, we always tag on a summary,

89
0:03:56.516,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience.

90
0:03:59.222,000 --> 0:04:01,000
And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers

91
0:04:01.986,000 --> 0:04:02,000
in order to make headlines like these.

92
0:04:04.723,000 --> 0:04:05,000
Thank you very much.

93
0:04:05.935,000 --> 0:04:06,000
(Applause)

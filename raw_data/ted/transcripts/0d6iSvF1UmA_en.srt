1
0:00:12.84,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Good evening.

2
0:00:14.6,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My journey to this stage

3
0:00:16.6,000 --> 0:00:17,000
began when I came to America

4
0:00:18.24,000 --> 0:00:19,000
at the age of 17.

5
0:00:21.24,000 --> 0:00:24,000
You see, I'm one of the 84 million Americans

6
0:00:24.68,000 --> 0:00:25,000
who are immigrants

7
0:00:26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
or children of immigrants.

8
0:00:28.44,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Each of us has a dream when we come here,

9
0:00:32.28,000 --> 0:00:35,000
a dream that usually has to be rewritten

10
0:00:35.32,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and always has to be repurposed.

11
0:00:38.56,000 --> 0:00:39,000
I was one of the lucky ones.

12
0:00:40.48,000 --> 0:00:43,000
My revised dream led me to the work I do today:

13
0:00:44.32,000 --> 0:00:46,000
training immigrants to run for public office

14
0:00:47.28,000 --> 0:00:5,000
and leading a movement for inclusive democracy.

15
0:00:51.08,000 --> 0:00:53,000
But I don't want you to think it was a cakewalk,

16
0:00:53.48,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that America opened its arms wide and welcomed me.

17
0:00:57.36,000 --> 0:00:58,000
It's still not doing that.

18
0:01:00.12,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And I've learned a few lessons along the way

19
0:01:02.28,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that I wanted to share with you,

20
0:01:03.92,000 --> 0:01:04,000
because I think that together

21
0:01:05.92,000 --> 0:01:07,000
we can make American democracy

22
0:01:08.64,000 --> 0:01:09,000
better and stronger.

23
0:01:11.4,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I was born in India,

24
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:15,000
the world's largest democracy,

25
0:01:16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and when I was four,

26
0:01:17.28,000 --> 0:01:18,000
my family moved to Belize,

27
0:01:19.12,000 --> 0:01:21,000
the world's smallest democracy perhaps.

28
0:01:23.4,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And at the age of 17,

29
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
I moved to the United States,

30
0:01:27.04,000 --> 0:01:29,000
the world's greatest democracy.

31
0:01:30.48,000 --> 0:01:32,000
I came because I wanted to study English literature.

32
0:01:34.04,000 --> 0:01:36,000
You see, as a child, I buried my nose in books,

33
0:01:36.96,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and I thought, why not make a living doing that as an adult?

34
0:01:40.64,000 --> 0:01:42,000
But after I graduated from college

35
0:01:43.12,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and got a graduate degree,

36
0:01:45.28,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I found myself moving from one less ideal job to another.

37
0:01:51.68,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Maybe it was the optimism that I had about America

38
0:01:55.04,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that made me take a while to understand

39
0:01:57.96,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that things were not going to change.

40
0:02:00.24,000 --> 0:02:02,000
The door that I thought was open

41
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
was actually just slightly ajar --

42
0:02:06.08,000 --> 0:02:07,000
this door of America

43
0:02:08.04,000 --> 0:02:11,000
that would open wide if you had the right name,

44
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
the right skin color,

45
0:02:12.8,000 --> 0:02:13,000
the right networks,

46
0:02:14.68,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but could just slam in your face

47
0:02:17.44,000 --> 0:02:19,000
if you had the wrong religion,

48
0:02:19.56,000 --> 0:02:2,000
the wrong immigration status,

49
0:02:22.199,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the wrong skin color.

50
0:02:25.84,000 --> 0:02:27,000
And I just couldn't accept that.

51
0:02:28.48,000 --> 0:02:3,000
So I started a career as a social entrepreneur,

52
0:02:32.24,000 --> 0:02:35,000
starting an organization for young people like myself --

53
0:02:35.52,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I was young at the time that I started it --

54
0:02:38.56,000 --> 0:02:41,000
who traced their heritage to the Indian subcontinent.

55
0:02:42.48,000 --> 0:02:46,000
In that work, I became and advocate for South Asians and other immigrants.

56
0:02:47.44,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I lobbied members of Congress on policy issues.

57
0:02:51.48,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I volunteered on election day to do exit polling.

58
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But I couldn't vote, and I couldn't run for office.

59
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So in 2000, when it was announced

60
0:03:03.84,000 --> 0:03:06,000
that the citizenship application fee was going to more than double

61
0:03:07.68,000 --> 0:03:1,000
from 95 dollars to 225 dollars,

62
0:03:11.4,000 --> 0:03:15,000
I decided it was time to apply before I could no longer afford it.

63
0:03:16.68,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I filled out a long application,

64
0:03:18.56,000 --> 0:03:22,000
answering questions about my current and my past affiliations.

65
0:03:23.88,000 --> 0:03:25,000
And once the application was submitted,

66
0:03:26.6,000 --> 0:03:28,000
there were fingerprints to be taken,

67
0:03:28.88,000 --> 0:03:3,000
a test to study for,

68
0:03:31.08,000 --> 0:03:33,000
endless hours of waiting in line.

69
0:03:34.6,000 --> 0:03:36,000
You might call it extreme vetting.

70
0:03:38.08,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And then in December of 2000,

71
0:03:41.04,000 --> 0:03:43,000
I joined hundreds of other immigrants

72
0:03:44.04,000 --> 0:03:46,000
in a hall in Brooklyn

73
0:03:46.2,000 --> 0:03:48,000
where we pledged our loyalty

74
0:03:48.56,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to a country that we had long considered home.

75
0:03:52.24,000 --> 0:03:56,000
My journey from international student to American citizen took 16 years,

76
0:03:56.88,000 --> 0:04:,000
a short timeline when you compare it to other immigrant stories.

77
0:04:01.88,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And soon after I had taken that formal step

78
0:04:05.2,000 --> 0:04:06,000
to becoming an American,

79
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the attacks of September 11, 2001,

80
0:04:10.04,000 --> 0:04:14,000
changed the immigration landscape for decades to come.

81
0:04:15.88,000 --> 0:04:16,000
My city, New York City,

82
0:04:17.84,000 --> 0:04:19,000
was reeling and healing,

83
0:04:20.24,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and in the midst of it,

84
0:04:21.64,000 --> 0:04:22,000
we were in an election cycle.

85
0:04:24.64,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Two things happened

86
0:04:25.92,000 --> 0:04:28,000
as we coped with loss and recovery in New York City.

87
0:04:30.56,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Voters elected Michael Bloomberg mayor of New York City.

88
0:04:35.52,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We also adopted by ballot referendum

89
0:04:39.8,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the Office of Immigrant Affairs for the City of New York.

90
0:04:43.52,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Five months after that election,

91
0:04:46.36,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the newly elected mayor

92
0:04:48.68,000 --> 0:04:52,000
appointed me the first Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs

93
0:04:52.92,000 --> 0:04:54,000
for this newly established office.

94
0:04:56.48,000 --> 0:04:57,000
I want you to come back to that time.

95
0:04:59.2,000 --> 0:05:01,000
I was a young immigrant woman from Belize.

96
0:05:02.48,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I had basically floundered in various jobs in America

97
0:05:06.32,000 --> 0:05:09,000
before I started a community-based organization

98
0:05:09.88,000 --> 0:05:11,000
in a church basement in Queens.

99
0:05:13.72,000 --> 0:05:16,000
The attacks of September 11 sent shock waves through my community.

100
0:05:18.32,000 --> 0:05:22,000
People who were members of my family, young people I had worked with,

101
0:05:23.32,000 --> 0:05:24,000
were experiencing harassment

102
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
at schools, at workplaces and in airports.

103
0:05:29.32,000 --> 0:05:31,000
And now I was going to represent their concerns

104
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:34,000
in government.

105
0:05:35.56,000 --> 0:05:37,000
No job felt more perfect for me.

106
0:05:39.64,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And here are two things I learned when I became Commissioner.

107
0:05:43.92,000 --> 0:05:46,000
First, well-meaning New Yorkers

108
0:05:47.08,000 --> 0:05:5,000
who were in city government holding government positions

109
0:05:50.24,000 --> 0:05:53,000
had no idea how scared immigrants were

110
0:05:54.72,000 --> 0:05:55,000
of law enforcement.

111
0:05:56.64,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Most of us don't really know the difference, do we,

112
0:05:59.08,000 --> 0:06:02,000
between a sheriff and local police and the FBI.

113
0:06:03.4,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And most of us, when we see someone in uniform

114
0:06:05.92,000 --> 0:06:06,000
going through our neighborhoods

115
0:06:07.84,000 --> 0:06:1,000
feel curiosity, if not concern.

116
0:06:12.12,000 --> 0:06:14,000
So if you're an undocumented parent,

117
0:06:15.04,000 --> 0:06:18,000
every day when you say goodbye to your child,

118
0:06:18.08,000 --> 0:06:2,000
send them off to school and go to work,

119
0:06:20.84,000 --> 0:06:21,000
you don't know what the chances are

120
0:06:22.84,000 --> 0:06:24,000
that you're going to see them at the end of the day.

121
0:06:25.44,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Because a raid at your workplace,

122
0:06:28.56,000 --> 0:06:3,000
a chance encounter with local police

123
0:06:31.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
could change the course of your life forever.

124
0:06:35.48,000 --> 0:06:37,000
The second thing I learned is that when people like me,

125
0:06:38.24,000 --> 0:06:39,000
who understood that fear,

126
0:06:41,000 --> 0:06:44,000
who had learned a new language, who had navigated new systems,

127
0:06:44.84,000 --> 0:06:47,000
when people like us were sitting at the table,

128
0:06:48.2,000 --> 0:06:53,000
we advocated for our communities' needs in a way that no one else could or would.

129
0:06:54.2,000 --> 0:06:57,000
I understood what that feeling of fear was like.

130
0:06:58.04,000 --> 0:07:,000
People in my family were experiencing it.

131
0:07:00.4,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Young people I had worked with were being harassed,

132
0:07:02.84,000 --> 0:07:03,000
not just by classmates,

133
0:07:04.84,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but also by their teachers.

134
0:07:07.52,000 --> 0:07:08,000
My husband, then boyfriend,

135
0:07:09.36,000 --> 0:07:13,000
thought twice before he put a backpack on or grew a beard

136
0:07:13.6,000 --> 0:07:14,000
because he traveled so much.

137
0:07:18.56,000 --> 0:07:21,000
What I learned in 2001 was that my vote mattered

138
0:07:22.28,000 --> 0:07:25,000
but that my voice and vantage point also mattered.

139
0:07:26.68,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And it's these three things --

140
0:07:28.36,000 --> 0:07:31,000
immigrants' votes, voices and vantage points --

141
0:07:31.52,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that I think can help make our democracy stronger.

142
0:07:36.04,000 --> 0:07:38,000
We actually have the power

143
0:07:38.08,000 --> 0:07:4,000
to change the outcome of elections,

144
0:07:41.08,000 --> 0:07:45,000
to introduce new issues into the policy debate

145
0:07:45.24,000 --> 0:07:49,000
and to change the face of the pale, male, stale leadership

146
0:07:50.16,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that we have in our country today.

147
0:07:53.88,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So how do we do that?

148
0:07:55.2,000 --> 0:07:57,000
Well, let's talk first about votes.

149
0:07:57.8,000 --> 0:07:58,000
It will come as no surprise to you

150
0:07:59.48,000 --> 0:08:01,000
that the majority of voters in America are white.

151
0:08:03.16,000 --> 0:08:04,000
But it might surprise you to know

152
0:08:04.96,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that one in three voters are black, Latino or Asian.

153
0:08:09.84,000 --> 0:08:1,000
But here's the thing:

154
0:08:11.4,000 --> 0:08:15,000
it doesn't just matter who can vote, it matters who does vote.

155
0:08:16.44,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So in 2012, half of the Latino and Asian-American voters

156
0:08:20.88,000 --> 0:08:21,000
did not vote.

157
0:08:24.4,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And these votes matter not just in presidential elections.

158
0:08:27.72,000 --> 0:08:29,000
They matter in local and state elections.

159
0:08:30.6,000 --> 0:08:32,000
In 2015, Lan Diep,

160
0:08:33.48,000 --> 0:08:36,000
the eldest son of political refugees from Vietnam,

161
0:08:37.76,000 --> 0:08:39,000
ran for a seat in the San Jose City Council.

162
0:08:41.48,000 --> 0:08:44,000
He lost that election by 13 votes.

163
0:08:45.88,000 --> 0:08:47,000
This year, he dusted off those campaign shoes

164
0:08:48.88,000 --> 0:08:5,000
and went back to run for that seat,

165
0:08:52.76,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and this time he won, by 12 votes.

166
0:08:58.12,000 --> 0:09:,000
Every one of our votes matters.

167
0:09:02.64,000 --> 0:09:05,000
And when people like Lan are sitting at the policy table,

168
0:09:05.84,000 --> 0:09:06,000
they can make a difference.

169
0:09:07.2,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We need those voices.

170
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:1,000
We need those voices

171
0:09:10.28,000 --> 0:09:14,000
in part because American leadership

172
0:09:14.4,000 --> 0:09:16,000
does not look like America's residents.

173
0:09:18.04,000 --> 0:09:21,000
There are over 500,000 local and state offices in America.

174
0:09:22.96,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Fewer than 2 percent of those offices are held by Asian-Americans or Latinos,

175
0:09:28.16,000 --> 0:09:3,000
the two largest immigrant groups in our country.

176
0:09:32.6,000 --> 0:09:34,000
In the city of Yakima, Washington,

177
0:09:34.96,000 --> 0:09:37,000
where 49 percent of the population is Latino,

178
0:09:38.6,000 --> 0:09:42,000
there has never been a Latino on the city council until this year.

179
0:09:43.88,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Three newly elected Latinas joined the Yakima City Council in 2016.

180
0:09:49.52,000 --> 0:09:51,000
One of them is Carmen Méndez.

181
0:09:52.24,000 --> 0:09:54,000
She is a first-generation college student.

182
0:09:55,000 --> 0:09:57,000
She grew up partly in Colima, Mexico,

183
0:09:57.84,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and partly in Yakima, Washington.

184
0:10:00.28,000 --> 0:10:02,000
She's a single mother, a community advocate.

185
0:10:03.36,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Her voice on the Yakima City Council

186
0:10:06.04,000 --> 0:10:08,000
is advocating on behalf of the Latino community

187
0:10:08.64,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and of all Yakima residents.

188
0:10:10.92,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And she's a role model for her daughter

189
0:10:13.52,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and other Latinas.

190
0:10:16.16,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But the third most untapped resource in American democracy

191
0:10:20.68,000 --> 0:10:22,000
is the vantage point that immigrants bring.

192
0:10:24.08,000 --> 0:10:26,000
We have fought to be here.

193
0:10:26.92,000 --> 0:10:29,000
We have come for economic and educational opportunity.

194
0:10:30.44,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We have come for political and religious freedom.

195
0:10:33.8,000 --> 0:10:35,000
We have come in the pursuit of love.

196
0:10:37.16,000 --> 0:10:38,000
That dedication,

197
0:10:39.04,000 --> 0:10:4,000
that commitment to America

198
0:10:41.88,000 --> 0:10:43,000
we also bring to public service.

199
0:10:45.52,000 --> 0:10:47,000
People like Athena Salman,

200
0:10:47.68,000 --> 0:10:51,000
who just last week won the primary

201
0:10:52.2,000 --> 0:10:55,000
for a seat in the Arizona State House.

202
0:10:55.6,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Athena's father grew up in the West Bank

203
0:10:57.72,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and moved to Chicago,

204
0:10:58.96,000 --> 0:10:59,000
where he met her mother.

205
0:11:00.44,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Her mother is part Italian,

206
0:11:02.52,000 --> 0:11:04,000
part Mexican and part German.

207
0:11:04.96,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Together they moved to Arizona and built a life.

208
0:11:08.08,000 --> 0:11:1,000
Athena, when she gets to the statehouse,

209
0:11:10.96,000 --> 0:11:12,000
is going to fight for things like education funding

210
0:11:13.52,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that will help give families like hers a leg up

211
0:11:17.08,000 --> 0:11:19,000
so they can achieve the financial stability

212
0:11:19.12,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that we all are looking for.

213
0:11:22.92,000 --> 0:11:25,000
Immigrants' votes, voices and vantage points

214
0:11:26.4,000 --> 0:11:29,000
are what we all need to work to include in American democracy.

215
0:11:30.32,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It's not just my work. It's also yours.

216
0:11:33.68,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And it's not going to be easy.

217
0:11:35.52,000 --> 0:11:36,000
We never know

218
0:11:37.2,000 --> 0:11:4,000
what putting a new factor into an equation will do.

219
0:11:41.44,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And it's a little scary.

220
0:11:43.96,000 --> 0:11:46,000
You're scared that I'm going to take away your place at the table,

221
0:11:47.72,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and I'm scared that I'm never going to get a place at the table.

222
0:11:52.4,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And we're all scared

223
0:11:53.64,000 --> 0:11:56,000
that we're going to lose this country that we know and love.

224
0:11:58.32,000 --> 0:12:,000
I'm scared you're going to take it away from me,

225
0:12:00.72,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and you're scared I'm going to take it away from you.

226
0:12:07,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Look, it's been a rough election year,

227
0:12:09.6,000 --> 0:12:13,000
a reminder that people with my immigration history

228
0:12:14,000 --> 0:12:16,000
could be removed at the whim of a leader.

229
0:12:17.32,000 --> 0:12:2,000
But I have fought to be in this country

230
0:12:20.76,000 --> 0:12:22,000
and I continue to do so every day.

231
0:12:23.72,000 --> 0:12:26,000
So my optimism never wavers,

232
0:12:26.84,000 --> 0:12:3,000
because I know that there are millions of immigrants just like me,

233
0:12:31.4,000 --> 0:12:33,000
in front of me, behind me and all around me.

234
0:12:35,000 --> 0:12:36,000
It's our country, too.

235
0:12:37.92,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Thank you.

236
0:12:39.16,000 --> 0:12:41,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.504,000 --> 0:00:17,000
OK, I want to take a moment to let each of you think to yourselves

2
0:00:18.084,000 --> 0:00:22,000
about the last time you sent or received a fax.

3
0:00:22.601,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:23.626,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Well, for me, it was this morning,

5
0:00:25.77,000 --> 0:00:27,000
because one piece of my work

6
0:00:27.909,000 --> 0:00:31,000
is making sure that everyone in the US has the information that they need

7
0:00:32.277,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to make decisions about the candidates on their ballot.

8
0:00:35.314,000 --> 0:00:36,000
And collecting that information

9
0:00:36.85,000 --> 0:00:39,000
from the local government offices responsible for maintaining it

10
0:00:40.212,000 --> 0:00:43,000
means sending and receiving a lot of faxes.

11
0:00:45.147,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Voting is one of our most fundamental rights.

12
0:00:48.431,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It's one of the most tangible ways

13
0:00:50.075,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that each and every one of us can shape our communities.

14
0:00:53.506,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And as we enter this fourth industrial revolution,

15
0:00:56.056,000 --> 0:00:58,000
where technology is changing everything around us,

16
0:00:58.966,000 --> 0:01:02,000
you would think, with something as important as the right to vote,

17
0:01:03.385,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that we would have the most modern, secure,

18
0:01:06.662,000 --> 0:01:09,000
inclusive system that could exist ...

19
0:01:09.705,000 --> 0:01:1,000
But we don't.

20
0:01:11.645,000 --> 0:01:13,000
When we look at comparable democracies,

21
0:01:13.793,000 --> 0:01:16,000
the US has one of the lowest voter turnout rates in the world.

22
0:01:17.831,000 --> 0:01:2,000
We have a system where even the most persistent voters

23
0:01:21.043,000 --> 0:01:23,000
come up against exhausting barriers.

24
0:01:23.513,000 --> 0:01:25,000
A system where 20th-century technology --

25
0:01:26.141,000 --> 0:01:27,000
like fax machines --

26
0:01:27.627,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and outdated practices stand in the way of full, vibrant participation.

27
0:01:33.579,000 --> 0:01:37,000
In US presidential elections, turnout hovers around 60 percent.

28
0:01:38.603,000 --> 0:01:4,000
The numbers are even lower for local elections.

29
0:01:41.364,000 --> 0:01:44,000
That means that nearly 40 percent of Americans aren't voters.

30
0:01:45.477,000 --> 0:01:48,000
That's nearly 100 million people.

31
0:01:50.763,000 --> 0:01:52,000
I believe in something very straightforward:

32
0:01:54.141,000 --> 0:01:57,000
that everyone should have the information that they need to become a voter,

33
0:01:57.986,000 --> 0:02:,000
that the voting process should be seamless and secure

34
0:02:01.717,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and that every voter should have information they trust

35
0:02:04.634,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to make decisions about the candidates on their ballot.

36
0:02:07.795,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Because when more people vote,

37
0:02:09.995,000 --> 0:02:11,000
together, we make better decisions for our communities.

38
0:02:13.786,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So I've spent the last eight years on a mission

39
0:02:16.62,000 --> 0:02:18,000
to push our democracy into the 21st century.

40
0:02:20.147,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Now, one of the most common approaches to election modernization

41
0:02:23.905,000 --> 0:02:25,000
is advocating for policy change,

42
0:02:26.3,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and that's an incredibly important piece of the strategy

43
0:02:29.493,000 --> 0:02:32,000
for building a system where millions of more people become voters.

44
0:02:33.778,000 --> 0:02:34,000
But I've taken a different approach.

45
0:02:36.009,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I focused on a critical yet largely untapped resource

46
0:02:39.659,000 --> 0:02:4,000
for election modernization:

47
0:02:42.248,000 --> 0:02:43,000
local election officials.

48
0:02:44.436,000 --> 0:02:48,000
I work with thousands of local election officials across the country

49
0:02:48.945,000 --> 0:02:51,000
to build tools and skills that they can use immediately

50
0:02:52.777,000 --> 0:02:54,000
to transform the way that they're engaging today's voters.

51
0:02:56.452,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Folks like Kat and Marie.

52
0:02:58.745,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Kat and Marie have worked together for years in a windowless office

53
0:03:02.44,000 --> 0:03:05,000
in the basement of the Mercer County Courthouse in West Virginia.

54
0:03:06.021,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Together, they have a tremendous responsibility.

55
0:03:09.193,000 --> 0:03:13,000
They're local election officials serving Mercer County's 40,000 registered voters.

56
0:03:15.3,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Local election officials are the public servants

57
0:03:17.591,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that do the day-to-day work that makes our election system function.

58
0:03:21.493,000 --> 0:03:23,000
When you fill out a voter-registration form,

59
0:03:23.605,000 --> 0:03:25,000
they're the folks that process them and add you to the rolls.

60
0:03:27.552,000 --> 0:03:31,000
They're the folks who buy the technology that we use to cast and count ballots.

61
0:03:31.997,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They recruit and train the volunteers at your local polling place.

62
0:03:35.418,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And they're the official nonpartisan source

63
0:03:38.053,000 --> 0:03:4,000
for informing people in their communities about how to vote.

64
0:03:41.73,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And unlike other countries

65
0:03:43.926,000 --> 0:03:45,000
where there's some form of centralized election authority,

66
0:03:46.895,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in the US,

67
0:03:48.27,000 --> 0:03:53,000
there are 7,897 different county and municipal offices,

68
0:03:54.25,000 --> 0:03:55,000
like Kat and Marie's,

69
0:03:55.684,000 --> 0:03:58,000
that each have an independent role in administering elections.

70
0:03:59.327,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Yes, that's nearly 8,000 slightly different ways

71
0:04:02.699,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that you might experience voting based on where you happen to live.

72
0:04:07.295,000 --> 0:04:09,000
When I was talking with Kat and Marie,

73
0:04:09.589,000 --> 0:04:12,000
like so many election officials that I talk with in rural towns

74
0:04:13.252,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and in major cities alike,

75
0:04:15.171,000 --> 0:04:18,000
they were deeply proud of getting to help people in their communities,

76
0:04:19.139,000 --> 0:04:2,000
but they were also worried.

77
0:04:21.45,000 --> 0:04:24,000
All of the new tools that people were using to get information --

78
0:04:24.522,000 --> 0:04:26,000
the internet, social media --

79
0:04:26.639,000 --> 0:04:28,000
they were difficult to figure out how to use effectively.

80
0:04:29.554,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And they felt like they weren't fully meeting the needs of Mercer County voters.

81
0:04:34.254,000 --> 0:04:37,000
One thing that they really wished that they had was a website

82
0:04:37.384,000 --> 0:04:38,000
so they could create a hub

83
0:04:38.648,000 --> 0:04:41,000
with information about how to register in upcoming elections,

84
0:04:41.743,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and a place to put election results.

85
0:04:44.129,000 --> 0:04:47,000
See, at the time, when voters had questions,

86
0:04:47.281,000 --> 0:04:5,000
they had to either call or visit their office,

87
0:04:50.381,000 --> 0:04:52,000
which meant that Kat and Marie were inevitably answering

88
0:04:53.026,000 --> 0:04:55,000
the same questions over and over again,

89
0:04:55.865,000 --> 0:04:58,000
which is both a superinefficient use of their time,

90
0:04:59.161,000 --> 0:05:01,000
but also created totally unnecessary barriers for voters

91
0:05:02.161,000 --> 0:05:04,000
when that information could just live online.

92
0:05:06.295,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And Mercer County wasn't alone.

93
0:05:08.753,000 --> 0:05:12,000
At the time, they were one of 966 counties in the US

94
0:05:13.13,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that had no voting information online.

95
0:05:16.366,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I'll let that sink in.

96
0:05:19.233,000 --> 0:05:22,000
They were one of the nearly one-third of counties in the US

97
0:05:22.559,000 --> 0:05:23,000
that had no place online

98
0:05:23.972,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to find official information about how to vote.

99
0:05:28.273,000 --> 0:05:31,000
To Kat and Marie, not having and election website was unacceptable,

100
0:05:32.039,000 --> 0:05:33,000
but they didn't have very many options.

101
0:05:34.41,000 --> 0:05:36,000
They didn't have the budget to hire a web developer,

102
0:05:37.038,000 --> 0:05:39,000
they didn't have the expertise to build a site themselves,

103
0:05:39.863,000 --> 0:05:4,000
so they went without.

104
0:05:41.939,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And 40,000 voters in Mercer County went without.

105
0:05:46.765,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We're in a moment where we have an unprecedented opportunity

106
0:05:50.115,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to transform civic engagement.

107
0:05:53.476,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Technology is revolutionizing science and industry.

108
0:05:56.255,000 --> 0:05:58,000
It's already transformed how we connect with one another

109
0:05:59.081,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and understand the world around us,

110
0:06:01.588,000 --> 0:06:03,000
but our democratic institutions --

111
0:06:04.262,000 --> 0:06:05,000
they're being left behind.

112
0:06:07.198,000 --> 0:06:09,000
The US is one of the few major democracies in the world

113
0:06:10.135,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that puts the onus of voter registration on the individual voter,

114
0:06:14.307,000 --> 0:06:15,000
rather than the government.

115
0:06:16.57,000 --> 0:06:19,000
The rules that govern how to vote vary from state to state,

116
0:06:19.693,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and sometimes even county to county.

117
0:06:22.151,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And we have ballots that are pages and pages long.

118
0:06:25.614,000 --> 0:06:27,000
This November, on my ballot,

119
0:06:28.13,000 --> 0:06:31,000
there are literally over 100 different people and referenda

120
0:06:31.706,000 --> 0:06:33,000
for me to make decisions about.

121
0:06:34.265,000 --> 0:06:36,000
We have to be using the best tools we can bring to bear

122
0:06:36.89,000 --> 0:06:38,000
to help voters navigate this complexity,

123
0:06:39.141,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and right now, we're not.

124
0:06:42.754,000 --> 0:06:45,000
One of the most common narratives I hear in my work

125
0:06:45.917,000 --> 0:06:48,000
is that people aren't civically engaged because they're apathetic --

126
0:06:49.514,000 --> 0:06:5,000
because they don't care.

127
0:06:52.322,000 --> 0:06:55,000
But as my brilliant friends at the Center for Civic Design say,

128
0:06:55.435,000 --> 0:06:56,000
if there is apathy,

129
0:06:57.116,000 --> 0:06:59,000
it comes from the system,

130
0:06:59.169,000 --> 0:07:,000
not the voter.

131
0:07:01.338,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We can change the system right now

132
0:07:04.984,000 --> 0:07:07,000
by connecting local election officials like Kat and Marie

133
0:07:08.53,000 --> 0:07:1,000
with 21st-century tools

134
0:07:10.724,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and the training that they need to use them to better serve voters.

135
0:07:16.359,000 --> 0:07:2,000
Tools and training to do things like use social media for voter engagement,

136
0:07:21.34,000 --> 0:07:23,000
or use data to staff and equip polling places

137
0:07:23.879,000 --> 0:07:26,000
so that we don't see hours-long lines at the polls,

138
0:07:27.325,000 --> 0:07:29,000
or training on cybersecurity best practices

139
0:07:29.963,000 --> 0:07:32,000
so that we can ensure that our voting systems are secure.

140
0:07:34.373,000 --> 0:07:35,000
When we invest in this approach,

141
0:07:35.921,000 --> 0:07:38,000
we see meaningful, lasting results.

142
0:07:40.403,000 --> 0:07:41,000
Kat and Marie are online now.

143
0:07:42.883,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Inspired by their experience, we built a website template

144
0:07:45.605,000 --> 0:07:48,000
using research-based best practices in civic design,

145
0:07:49.041,000 --> 0:07:5,000
and developed the training

146
0:07:50.647,000 --> 0:07:53,000
so that Kat and Marie are able to maintain their site themselves.

147
0:07:55.3,000 --> 0:07:56,000
In less than a week,

148
0:07:56.475,000 --> 0:07:59,000
they went from having never seen the back end of a website

149
0:08:00.029,000 --> 0:08:02,000
to building a resource for Mercer County voters

150
0:08:02.44,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that they have been independently keeping up to date since 2014.

151
0:08:07.359,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Today, the 40,000 voters in Mercer County

152
0:08:10.358,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and over 100,000 voters in counties across the country

153
0:08:14.11,000 --> 0:08:16,000
have everything that they need to become a voter

154
0:08:16.484,000 --> 0:08:18,000
directly from their local election official,

155
0:08:18.776,000 --> 0:08:22,000
on a mobile-friendly, easy-to-use, accessible website.

156
0:08:24.782,000 --> 0:08:27,000
And we can even further scale the impact

157
0:08:28.337,000 --> 0:08:3,000
when local election officials are not only reaching out

158
0:08:30.94,000 --> 0:08:31,000
through their own channels,

159
0:08:32.263,000 --> 0:08:35,000
but they're extending their reach by working in partnership with others.

160
0:08:36.773,000 --> 0:08:38,000
Efforts like the Ballot Information Project

161
0:08:38.878,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and the Voting Information Project work with election officials nationwide

162
0:08:43.233,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to create a centralized, standard database of key voting information,

163
0:08:47.366,000 --> 0:08:49,000
like what's on your ballot and where to vote.

164
0:08:51.164,000 --> 0:08:55,000
That information powers tools built by companies like Google and Facebook

165
0:08:55.261,000 --> 0:08:57,000
to get information in the places where people already are,

166
0:08:58.127,000 --> 0:09:,000
like their newsfeed and search.

167
0:09:02.023,000 --> 0:09:05,000
In 2016, the Ballot Information Project

168
0:09:05.757,000 --> 0:09:08,000
connected the public with information about candidates and referenda

169
0:09:09.552,000 --> 0:09:12,000
over 200 millions times,

170
0:09:13.242,000 --> 0:09:17,000
helping between a third and a half of every single person who cast a ballot.

171
0:09:19.666,000 --> 0:09:22,000
And that model has been replicated for elections around the world.

172
0:09:24.284,000 --> 0:09:27,000
When we look at efforts in other areas of government,

173
0:09:27.979,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we can see the opportunity when we listen to the public's needs

174
0:09:32.099,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and we meet them with modern tools.

175
0:09:34.504,000 --> 0:09:35,000
I think about my friends at mRelief,

176
0:09:36.425,000 --> 0:09:39,000
who have helped 260,000 families

177
0:09:39.989,000 --> 0:09:42,000
unlock 42 million dollars in food benefits

178
0:09:44.003,000 --> 0:09:46,000
by helping government agencies transition away

179
0:09:46.299,000 --> 0:09:5,000
from a 20-page, paper-based application for food stamps

180
0:09:50.935,000 --> 0:09:55,000
to a process that can happen in 10 questions over text message

181
0:09:56.032,000 --> 0:09:57,000
in fewer than three minutes.

182
0:09:58.538,000 --> 0:10:01,000
That kind of transformation is possible in voting.

183
0:10:02.537,000 --> 0:10:04,000
It's happening right now,

184
0:10:05.023,000 --> 0:10:06,000
but there's still so much work to do.

185
0:10:08.402,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Now, if you have any technical bone in your body,

186
0:10:12.925,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I know what you're thinking.

187
0:10:14.752,000 --> 0:10:15,000
This is all solvable.

188
0:10:16.82,000 --> 0:10:18,000
The technology that we need exists.

189
0:10:19.486,000 --> 0:10:21,000
We collectively have the expertise.

190
0:10:22.503,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You might even be thinking about volunteering

191
0:10:24.624,000 --> 0:10:25,000
at your local election office.

192
0:10:26.514,000 --> 0:10:28,000
I love how solutions-oriented you are,

193
0:10:29.254,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but to be clear,

194
0:10:31.152,000 --> 0:10:34,000
the work that is needed to modernize our election system

195
0:10:34.606,000 --> 0:10:37,000
isn't something that's going to happen using 20 percent time,

196
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
or through a hackathon,

197
0:10:39.683,000 --> 0:10:41,000
or by doing a one-off technology project.

198
0:10:42.796,000 --> 0:10:47,000
What we need is significant, sustained, long-term investment.

199
0:10:49.042,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Investment in technology

200
0:10:51.051,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and investment in the skills of local election officials

201
0:10:53.92,000 --> 0:10:56,000
to run 21st-century elections,

202
0:10:57.393,000 --> 0:10:59,000
because if we don't invest in the long game,

203
0:11:00.025,000 --> 0:11:02,000
we risk finding ourselves perpetually behind.

204
0:11:03.624,000 --> 0:11:06,000
So if you're ready to help millions,

205
0:11:07.096,000 --> 0:11:1,000
if you're ready to close the gap between the system that we have

206
0:11:10.359,000 --> 0:11:12,000
and the system that we deserve,

207
0:11:12.857,000 --> 0:11:13,000
we need you.

208
0:11:14.76,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Organizations that are doing this work year-round need you.

209
0:11:18.741,000 --> 0:11:2,000
Local election offices need you.

210
0:11:21.873,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Come join us.

211
0:11:23.873,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Thank you.

212
0:11:25.048,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Applause)

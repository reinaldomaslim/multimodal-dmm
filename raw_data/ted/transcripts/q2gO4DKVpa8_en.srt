1
0:00:13.391,000 --> 0:00:15,000
You probably don't know me,

2
0:00:15.67,000 --> 0:00:18,000
but I am one of those .01 percenters

3
0:00:19.014,000 --> 0:00:2,000
that you hear about and read about,

4
0:00:20.957,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I am by any reasonable definition a plutocrat.

5
0:00:25.022,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And tonight, what I would like to do is speak directly

6
0:00:28.112,000 --> 0:00:3,000
to other plutocrats, to my people,

7
0:00:30.418,000 --> 0:00:32,000
because it feels like it's time for us all

8
0:00:33.229,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to have a chat.

9
0:00:35.305,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Like most plutocrats, I too am a proud

10
0:00:37.883,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and unapologetic capitalist.

11
0:00:40.226,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I have founded, cofounded or funded

12
0:00:43.763,000 --> 0:00:46,000
over 30 companies across a range of industries.

13
0:00:47.293,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I was the first non-family investor in Amazon.com.

14
0:00:50.888,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I cofounded a company called aQuantive

15
0:00:53.609,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that we sold to Microsoft for 6.4 billion dollars.

16
0:00:57.479,000 --> 0:00:59,000
My friends and I, we own a bank.

17
0:01:00.027,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I tell you this — (Laughter) —

18
0:01:02.923,000 --> 0:01:03,000
unbelievable, right?

19
0:01:04.17,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I tell you this to show

20
0:01:07.38,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that my life is like most plutocrats.

21
0:01:10.143,000 --> 0:01:13,000
I have a broad perspective on capitalism

22
0:01:13.45,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and business,

23
0:01:15.25,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and I have been rewarded obscenely for that

24
0:01:19.04,000 --> 0:01:21,000
with a life that most of you all

25
0:01:21.197,000 --> 0:01:23,000
can't even imagine:

26
0:01:23.456,000 --> 0:01:25,000
multiple homes, a yacht, my own plane,

27
0:01:26.157,000 --> 0:01:3,000
etc., etc., etc.

28
0:01:30.284,000 --> 0:01:33,000
But let's be honest: I am not the smartest person you've ever met.

29
0:01:33.546,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I am certainly not the hardest working.

30
0:01:35.95,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I was a mediocre student.

31
0:01:37.923,000 --> 0:01:38,000
I'm not technical at all.

32
0:01:39.141,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I can't write a word of code.

33
0:01:41.639,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Truly, my success is the consequence

34
0:01:44.772,000 --> 0:01:46,000
of spectacular luck,

35
0:01:47.22,000 --> 0:01:51,000
of birth, of circumstance and of timing.

36
0:01:52.124,000 --> 0:01:56,000
But I am actually pretty good at a couple of things.

37
0:01:56.619,000 --> 0:02:,000
One, I have an unusually high tolerance for risk,

38
0:02:01.263,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and the other is I have a good sense,

39
0:02:03.678,000 --> 0:02:05,000
a good intuition about what will happen in the future,

40
0:02:06.303,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and I think that that intuition about the future

41
0:02:09.586,000 --> 0:02:12,000
is the essence of good entrepreneurship.

42
0:02:13.156,000 --> 0:02:15,000
So what do I see in our future today,

43
0:02:15.674,000 --> 0:02:17,000
you ask?

44
0:02:17.676,000 --> 0:02:18,000
I see pitchforks,

45
0:02:19.331,000 --> 0:02:23,000
as in angry mobs with pitchforks,

46
0:02:24.121,000 --> 0:02:29,000
because while people like us plutocrats

47
0:02:29.335,000 --> 0:02:32,000
are living beyond the dreams of avarice,

48
0:02:32.866,000 --> 0:02:34,000
the other 99 percent of our fellow citizens

49
0:02:35.779,000 --> 0:02:37,000
are falling farther and farther behind.

50
0:02:38.592,000 --> 0:02:4,000
In 1980, the top one percent of Americans

51
0:02:41.08,000 --> 0:02:43,000
shared about eight percent of national [income],

52
0:02:43.558,000 --> 0:02:45,000
while the bottom 50 percent of Americans

53
0:02:46.232,000 --> 0:02:48,000
shared 18 percent.

54
0:02:48.775,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Thirty years later, today, the top one percent

55
0:02:52.127,000 --> 0:02:55,000
shares over 20 percent of national [income],

56
0:02:55.749,000 --> 0:02:56,000
while the bottom 50 percent of Americans

57
0:02:57.65,000 --> 0:02:59,000
share 12 or 13.

58
0:03:00.564,000 --> 0:03:02,000
If the trend continues,

59
0:03:03.01,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the top one percent will share

60
0:03:04.49,000 --> 0:03:06,000
over 30 percent of national [income]

61
0:03:06.796,000 --> 0:03:07,000
in another 30 years,

62
0:03:08.588,000 --> 0:03:1,000
while the bottom 50 percent of Americans

63
0:03:10.868,000 --> 0:03:11,000
will share just six.

64
0:03:12.607,000 --> 0:03:13,000
You see, the problem isn't that we have

65
0:03:14.603,000 --> 0:03:16,000
some inequality.

66
0:03:16.684,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Some inequality is necessary

67
0:03:19.136,000 --> 0:03:22,000
for a high-functioning capitalist democracy.

68
0:03:22.43,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The problem is that inequality

69
0:03:24.14,000 --> 0:03:27,000
is at historic highs today

70
0:03:27.502,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and it's getting worse every day.

71
0:03:30.921,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And if wealth, power, and income

72
0:03:33.545,000 --> 0:03:34,000
continue to concentrate

73
0:03:35.38,000 --> 0:03:37,000
at the very tippy top,

74
0:03:37.681,000 --> 0:03:38,000
our society will change

75
0:03:39.529,000 --> 0:03:4,000
from a capitalist democracy

76
0:03:41.262,000 --> 0:03:44,000
to a neo-feudalist rentier society

77
0:03:45.034,000 --> 0:03:46,000
like 18th-century France.

78
0:03:47.019,000 --> 0:03:5,000
That was France

79
0:03:50.213,000 --> 0:03:51,000
before the revolution

80
0:03:51.96,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and the mobs with the pitchforks.

81
0:03:53.984,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So I have a message for my fellow plutocrats

82
0:03:56.538,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and zillionaires

83
0:03:58.36,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and for anyone who lives

84
0:03:59.834,000 --> 0:04:01,000
in a gated bubble world:

85
0:04:02.07,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Wake up.

86
0:04:03.421,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Wake up. It cannot last.

87
0:04:07.141,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Because if we do not do something

88
0:04:09.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to fix the glaring economic inequities in our society,

89
0:04:13.491,000 --> 0:04:15,000
the pitchforks will come for us,

90
0:04:16.236,000 --> 0:04:19,000
for no free and open society can long sustain

91
0:04:20.184,000 --> 0:04:23,000
this kind of rising economic inequality.

92
0:04:23.188,000 --> 0:04:25,000
It has never happened. There are no examples.

93
0:04:26.11,000 --> 0:04:27,000
You show me a highly unequal society,

94
0:04:27.969,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and I will show you a police state

95
0:04:29.448,000 --> 0:04:3,000
or an uprising.

96
0:04:31.215,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The pitchforks will come for us

97
0:04:33.358,000 --> 0:04:34,000
if we do not address this.

98
0:04:35.269,000 --> 0:04:38,000
It's not a matter of if, it's when.

99
0:04:39.117,000 --> 0:04:42,000
And it will be terrible when they come

100
0:04:42.75,000 --> 0:04:43,000
for everyone,

101
0:04:44.201,000 --> 0:04:48,000
but particularly for people like us plutocrats.

102
0:04:49.185,000 --> 0:04:52,000
I know I must sound like some liberal do-gooder.

103
0:04:52.605,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I'm not. I'm not making a moral argument

104
0:04:54.855,000 --> 0:04:57,000
that economic inequality is wrong.

105
0:04:58.117,000 --> 0:05:02,000
What I am arguing is that rising economic inequality

106
0:05:02.403,000 --> 0:05:05,000
is stupid and ultimately self-defeating.

107
0:05:05.924,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Rising inequality doesn't just increase our risks

108
0:05:09.152,000 --> 0:05:1,000
from pitchforks,

109
0:05:11.02,000 --> 0:05:15,000
but it's also terrible for business too.

110
0:05:15.587,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So the model for us rich guys should be Henry Ford.

111
0:05:19.457,000 --> 0:05:22,000
When Ford famously introduced the $5 day,

112
0:05:23.27,000 --> 0:05:25,000
which was twice the prevailing wage at the time,

113
0:05:26.217,000 --> 0:05:28,000
he didn't just increase the productivity

114
0:05:28.287,000 --> 0:05:29,000
of his factories,

115
0:05:30.256,000 --> 0:05:33,000
he converted exploited autoworkers who were poor

116
0:05:33.653,000 --> 0:05:35,000
into a thriving middle class who could now afford

117
0:05:36.353,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to buy the products that they made.

118
0:05:39.57,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Ford intuited what we now know is true,

119
0:05:43.86,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that an economy is best understood as an ecosystem

120
0:05:47.861,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and characterized by the same kinds

121
0:05:49.78,000 --> 0:05:51,000
of feedback loops you find

122
0:05:52.34,000 --> 0:05:53,000
in a natural ecosystem,

123
0:05:54.08,000 --> 0:05:57,000
a feedback loop between customers and businesses.

124
0:05:58.018,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Raising wages increases demand,

125
0:06:01.124,000 --> 0:06:03,000
which increases hiring,

126
0:06:03.205,000 --> 0:06:05,000
which in turn increases wages

127
0:06:05.286,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and demand and profits,

128
0:06:07.916,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and that virtuous cycle of increasing prosperity

129
0:06:12.76,000 --> 0:06:14,000
is precisely what is missing

130
0:06:14.909,000 --> 0:06:18,000
from today's economic recovery.

131
0:06:19.904,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And this is why we need to put behind us

132
0:06:24.522,000 --> 0:06:27,000
the trickle-down policies that so dominate

133
0:06:28.23,000 --> 0:06:29,000
both political parties

134
0:06:30.027,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and embrace something I call middle-out economics.

135
0:06:33.432,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Middle-out economics rejects

136
0:06:35.967,000 --> 0:06:37,000
the neoclassical economic idea

137
0:06:38.284,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that economies are efficient, linear, mechanistic,

138
0:06:42.481,000 --> 0:06:45,000
that they tend towards equilibrium and fairness,

139
0:06:45.608,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and instead embraces the 21st-century idea

140
0:06:49.046,000 --> 0:06:52,000
that economies are complex, adaptive,

141
0:06:52.82,000 --> 0:06:54,000
ecosystemic,

142
0:06:54.822,000 --> 0:06:57,000
that they tend away from equilibrium and toward inequality,

143
0:06:58.17,000 --> 0:06:59,000
that they're not efficient at all

144
0:06:59.92,000 --> 0:07:02,000
but are effective if well managed.

145
0:07:03.205,000 --> 0:07:06,000
This 21st-century perspective

146
0:07:06.476,000 --> 0:07:08,000
allows you to clearly see that capitalism

147
0:07:09.14,000 --> 0:07:12,000
does not work by [efficiently] allocating

148
0:07:12.427,000 --> 0:07:14,000
existing resources.

149
0:07:14.867,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It works by [efficiently] creating new solutions

150
0:07:20.865,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to human problems.

151
0:07:22.12,000 --> 0:07:24,000
The genius of capitalism

152
0:07:24.329,000 --> 0:07:28,000
is that it is an evolutionary solution-finding system.

153
0:07:29.211,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It rewards people for solving other people's problems.

154
0:07:35.162,000 --> 0:07:37,000
The difference between a poor society

155
0:07:38.109,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and a rich society, obviously,

156
0:07:40.426,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is the degree to which that society

157
0:07:43.364,000 --> 0:07:44,000
has generated solutions in the form

158
0:07:45.297,000 --> 0:07:47,000
of products for its citizens.

159
0:07:48.156,000 --> 0:07:49,000
The sum of the solutions

160
0:07:49.977,000 --> 0:07:5,000
that we have in our society

161
0:07:51.968,000 --> 0:07:53,000
really is our prosperity, and this explains

162
0:07:54.342,000 --> 0:07:56,000
why companies like Google and Amazon

163
0:07:56.625,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and Microsoft and Apple

164
0:07:58.988,000 --> 0:08:,000
and the entrepreneurs who created those companies

165
0:08:01.89,000 --> 0:08:04,000
have contributed so much

166
0:08:05.45,000 --> 0:08:07,000
to our nation's prosperity.

167
0:08:08.156,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This 21st-century perspective

168
0:08:10.956,000 --> 0:08:12,000
also makes clear

169
0:08:13.545,000 --> 0:08:15,000
that what we think of as economic growth

170
0:08:15.99,000 --> 0:08:16,000
is best understood as

171
0:08:17.937,000 --> 0:08:19,000
the rate at which we solve problems.

172
0:08:20.431,000 --> 0:08:23,000
But that rate is totally dependent upon

173
0:08:23.849,000 --> 0:08:26,000
how many problem solvers —

174
0:08:27.426,000 --> 0:08:29,000
diverse, able problem solvers — we have,

175
0:08:29.912,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and thus how many of our fellow citizens

176
0:08:32.645,000 --> 0:08:34,000
actively participate,

177
0:08:34.87,000 --> 0:08:37,000
both as entrepreneurs who can offer solutions,

178
0:08:38.52,000 --> 0:08:41,000
and as customers who consume them.

179
0:08:42.162,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But this maximizing participation thing

180
0:08:46.28,000 --> 0:08:47,000
doesn't happen by accident.

181
0:08:47.899,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It doesn't happen by itself.

182
0:08:49.868,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It requires effort and investment,

183
0:08:53.597,000 --> 0:08:55,000
which is why all

184
0:08:56.027,000 --> 0:08:59,000
highly prosperous capitalist democracies

185
0:08:59.258,000 --> 0:09:01,000
are characterized by massive investments

186
0:09:01.807,000 --> 0:09:03,000
in the middle class and the infrastructure

187
0:09:04.372,000 --> 0:09:06,000
that they depend on.

188
0:09:07.24,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We plutocrats need to get this

189
0:09:09.239,000 --> 0:09:12,000
trickle-down economics thing behind us,

190
0:09:12.378,000 --> 0:09:13,000
this idea that the better we do,

191
0:09:14.284,000 --> 0:09:16,000
the better everyone else will do.

192
0:09:16.951,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It's not true. How could it be?

193
0:09:20.871,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I earn 1,000 times the median wage,

194
0:09:24.999,000 --> 0:09:26,000
but I do not buy 1,000 times as much stuff,

195
0:09:27.924,000 --> 0:09:28,000
do I?

196
0:09:28.988,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I actually bought two pairs of these pants,

197
0:09:32.176,000 --> 0:09:33,000
what my partner Mike calls

198
0:09:34.11,000 --> 0:09:35,000
my manager pants.

199
0:09:35.625,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I could have bought 2,000 pairs,

200
0:09:38.561,000 --> 0:09:41,000
but what would I do with them? (Laughter)

201
0:09:41.627,000 --> 0:09:44,000
How many haircuts can I get?

202
0:09:44.656,000 --> 0:09:47,000
How often can I go out to dinner?

203
0:09:48.361,000 --> 0:09:52,000
No matter how wealthy a few plutocrats get,

204
0:09:52.434,000 --> 0:09:55,000
we can never drive a great national economy.

205
0:09:55.978,000 --> 0:10:,000
Only a thriving middle class can do that.

206
0:10:01.671,000 --> 0:10:02,000
There's nothing to be done,

207
0:10:03.368,000 --> 0:10:07,000
my plutocrat friends might say.

208
0:10:07.509,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Henry Ford was in a different time.

209
0:10:10.713,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Maybe we can't do some things.

210
0:10:12.987,000 --> 0:10:14,000
Maybe we can do some things.

211
0:10:15.923,000 --> 0:10:18,000
June 19, 2013,

212
0:10:19.784,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Bloomberg published an article I wrote called

213
0:10:23.217,000 --> 0:10:27,000
"The Capitalist’s Case for a $15 Minimum Wage."

214
0:10:28.15,000 --> 0:10:3,000
The good people at Forbes magazine,

215
0:10:31.072,000 --> 0:10:33,000
among my biggest admirers,

216
0:10:33.27,000 --> 0:10:37,000
called it "Nick Hanauer's near-insane proposal."

217
0:10:37.99,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And yet, just 350 days

218
0:10:41.219,000 --> 0:10:43,000
after that article was published,

219
0:10:43.795,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Seattle's Mayor Ed Murray signed into law

220
0:10:46.744,000 --> 0:10:49,000
an ordinance raising the minimum wage in Seattle

221
0:10:50.51,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to 15 dollars an hour,

222
0:10:52.198,000 --> 0:10:53,000
more than double

223
0:10:53.638,000 --> 0:10:57,000
what the prevailing federal $7.25 rate is.

224
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
How did this happen,

225
0:11:00.11,000 --> 0:11:02,000
reasonable people might ask.

226
0:11:02.195,000 --> 0:11:03,000
It happened because a group of us

227
0:11:03.863,000 --> 0:11:04,000
reminded the middle class

228
0:11:05.227,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that they are the source

229
0:11:06.878,000 --> 0:11:09,000
of growth and prosperity in capitalist economies.

230
0:11:10.544,000 --> 0:11:13,000
We reminded them that when workers have more money,

231
0:11:14.11,000 --> 0:11:15,000
businesses have more customers,

232
0:11:15.822,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and need more employees.

233
0:11:17.804,000 --> 0:11:19,000
We reminded them that when businesses

234
0:11:20.49,000 --> 0:11:22,000
pay workers a living wage,

235
0:11:23.21,000 --> 0:11:24,000
taxpayers are relieved of the burden

236
0:11:25.102,000 --> 0:11:26,000
of funding the poverty programs

237
0:11:26.812,000 --> 0:11:28,000
like food stamps and medical assistance

238
0:11:29.714,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and rent assistance

239
0:11:31.424,000 --> 0:11:33,000
that those workers need.

240
0:11:33.82,000 --> 0:11:35,000
We reminded them that low-wage workers

241
0:11:36.784,000 --> 0:11:38,000
make terrible taxpayers,

242
0:11:39.11,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and that when you raise the minimum wage

243
0:11:41.128,000 --> 0:11:43,000
for all businesses,

244
0:11:43.253,000 --> 0:11:44,000
all businesses benefit

245
0:11:44.92,000 --> 0:11:46,000
yet all can compete.

246
0:11:47.651,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Now the orthodox reaction, of course,

247
0:11:49.372,000 --> 0:11:52,000
is raising the minimum wage costs jobs. Right?

248
0:11:53.175,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Your politician's always echoing

249
0:11:55.763,000 --> 0:11:58,000
that trickle-down idea by saying things like,

250
0:11:58.855,000 --> 0:12:,000
"Well, if you raise the price of employment,

251
0:12:00.948,000 --> 0:12:02,000
guess what happens? You get less of it."

252
0:12:03.74,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Are you sure?

253
0:12:06.17,000 --> 0:12:09,000
Because there's some contravening evidence.

254
0:12:09.823,000 --> 0:12:13,000
Since 1980, the wages of CEOs in our country

255
0:12:14.582,000 --> 0:12:16,000
have gone from about 30 times the median wage

256
0:12:16.85,000 --> 0:12:18,000
to 500 times.

257
0:12:19.122,000 --> 0:12:22,000
That's raising the price of employment.

258
0:12:22.29,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And yet, to my knowledge,

259
0:12:25.262,000 --> 0:12:27,000
I have never seen a company

260
0:12:27.434,000 --> 0:12:3,000
outsource its CEO's job, automate their job,

261
0:12:31.18,000 --> 0:12:33,000
export the job to China.

262
0:12:33.267,000 --> 0:12:35,000
In fact, we appear to be employing

263
0:12:35.293,000 --> 0:12:38,000
more CEOs and senior managers than ever before.

264
0:12:38.515,000 --> 0:12:42,000
So too for technology workers

265
0:12:42.705,000 --> 0:12:43,000
and financial services workers,

266
0:12:44.531,000 --> 0:12:46,000
who earn multiples of the median wage

267
0:12:47.149,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and yet we employ more and more of them,

268
0:12:49.154,000 --> 0:12:53,000
so clearly you can raise the price of employment

269
0:12:54.05,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and get more of it.

270
0:12:56.091,000 --> 0:12:58,000
I know that most people

271
0:12:58.675,000 --> 0:12:59,000
think that the $15 minimum wage

272
0:13:00.397,000 --> 0:13:03,000
is this insane, risky economic experiment.

273
0:13:04.312,000 --> 0:13:05,000
We disagree.

274
0:13:06.21,000 --> 0:13:08,000
We believe that the $15 minimum wage

275
0:13:08.684,000 --> 0:13:09,000
in Seattle

276
0:13:09.95,000 --> 0:13:1,000
is actually the continuation

277
0:13:11.803,000 --> 0:13:13,000
of a logical economic policy.

278
0:13:14.511,000 --> 0:13:15,000
It is allowing our city

279
0:13:16.471,000 --> 0:13:18,000
to kick your city's ass.

280
0:13:19.206,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Because, you see,

281
0:13:20.965,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Washington state already has

282
0:13:22.677,000 --> 0:13:23,000
the highest minimum wage

283
0:13:24.17,000 --> 0:13:25,000
of any state in the nation.

284
0:13:25.869,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We pay all workers $9.32,

285
0:13:28.13,000 --> 0:13:29,000
which is almost 30 percent more

286
0:13:29.973,000 --> 0:13:31,000
than the federal minimum of 7.25,

287
0:13:32.531,000 --> 0:13:35,000
but crucially, 427 percent more

288
0:13:36.484,000 --> 0:13:39,000
than the federal tipped minimum of 2.13.

289
0:13:40.07,000 --> 0:13:42,000
If trickle-down thinkers were right,

290
0:13:42.686,000 --> 0:13:45,000
then Washington state should have massive unemployment.

291
0:13:45.798,000 --> 0:13:47,000
Seattle should be sliding into the ocean.

292
0:13:48.478,000 --> 0:13:51,000
And yet, Seattle

293
0:13:51.501,000 --> 0:13:54,000
is the fastest-growing big city in the country.

294
0:13:55.399,000 --> 0:13:59,000
Washington state is generating small business jobs

295
0:13:59.516,000 --> 0:14:01,000
at a higher rate than any other major state

296
0:14:02.137,000 --> 0:14:03,000
in the nation.

297
0:14:03.993,000 --> 0:14:06,000
The restaurant business in Seattle? Booming.

298
0:14:07.897,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Why? Because the fundamental law of capitalism is,

299
0:14:12.285,000 --> 0:14:13,000
when workers have more money,

300
0:14:13.9,000 --> 0:14:14,000
businesses have more customers

301
0:14:15.426,000 --> 0:14:17,000
and need more workers.

302
0:14:17.683,000 --> 0:14:2,000
When restaurants pay restaurant workers enough

303
0:14:20.834,000 --> 0:14:23,000
so that even they can afford to eat in restaurants,

304
0:14:24.456,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that's not bad for the restaurant business.

305
0:14:27.121,000 --> 0:14:28,000
That's good for it,

306
0:14:28.82,000 --> 0:14:32,000
despite what some restaurateurs may tell you.

307
0:14:33.399,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Is it more complicated than I'm making out?

308
0:14:35.457,000 --> 0:14:35,000
Of course it is.

309
0:14:36.454,000 --> 0:14:37,000
There are a lot of dynamics at play.

310
0:14:38.322,000 --> 0:14:4,000
But can we please stop insisting

311
0:14:40.564,000 --> 0:14:42,000
that if low-wage workers earn a little bit more,

312
0:14:43.365,000 --> 0:14:44,000
unemployment will skyrocket

313
0:14:44.873,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and the economy will collapse?

314
0:14:46.201,000 --> 0:14:48,000
There is no evidence for it.

315
0:14:48.81,000 --> 0:14:49,000
The most insidious thing

316
0:14:50.041,000 --> 0:14:51,000
about trickle-down economics

317
0:14:51.888,000 --> 0:14:53,000
is not the claim that if the rich get richer,

318
0:14:54.19,000 --> 0:14:55,000
everyone is better off.

319
0:14:55.727,000 --> 0:14:58,000
It is the claim made by those who oppose

320
0:14:58.788,000 --> 0:14:59,000
any increase in the minimum wage

321
0:15:00.69,000 --> 0:15:01,000
that if the poor get richer,

322
0:15:02.545,000 --> 0:15:04,000
that will be bad for the economy.

323
0:15:04.762,000 --> 0:15:05,000
This is nonsense.

324
0:15:06.742,000 --> 0:15:09,000
So can we please dispense with this rhetoric

325
0:15:10.607,000 --> 0:15:12,000
that says that rich guys like me

326
0:15:12.95,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and my plutocrat friends

327
0:15:15.804,000 --> 0:15:17,000
made our country?

328
0:15:18.377,000 --> 0:15:2,000
We plutocrats know,

329
0:15:20.452,000 --> 0:15:21,000
even if we don't like to admit it in public,

330
0:15:22.076,000 --> 0:15:24,000
that if we had been born somewhere else,

331
0:15:24.745,000 --> 0:15:25,000
not here in the United States,

332
0:15:26.642,000 --> 0:15:28,000
we might very well be just some dude standing barefoot

333
0:15:29.502,000 --> 0:15:32,000
by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.

334
0:15:32.652,000 --> 0:15:34,000
It's not that they don't have good entrepreneurs in other places,

335
0:15:35.183,000 --> 0:15:37,000
even very, very poor places.

336
0:15:37.208,000 --> 0:15:38,000
It's just that that's all

337
0:15:38.76,000 --> 0:15:42,000
that those entrepreneurs' customers can afford.

338
0:15:43.296,000 --> 0:15:47,000
So here's an idea for a new kind of economics,

339
0:15:47.895,000 --> 0:15:48,000
a new kind of politics

340
0:15:49.442,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that I call new capitalism.

341
0:15:52.329,000 --> 0:15:54,000
Let's acknowledge that capitalism

342
0:15:54.801,000 --> 0:15:55,000
beats the alternatives,

343
0:15:56.598,000 --> 0:15:59,000
but also that the more people we include,

344
0:16:00.595,000 --> 0:16:03,000
both as entrepreneurs and as customers,

345
0:16:04.119,000 --> 0:16:06,000
the better it works.

346
0:16:06.279,000 --> 0:16:09,000
Let's by all means shrink the size of government,

347
0:16:10.065,000 --> 0:16:12,000
but not by slashing the poverty programs,

348
0:16:12.784,000 --> 0:16:14,000
but by ensuring that workers are paid enough

349
0:16:14.801,000 --> 0:16:17,000
so that they actually don't need those programs.

350
0:16:18.123,000 --> 0:16:2,000
Let's invest enough in the middle class

351
0:16:21.04,000 --> 0:16:24,000
to make our economy fairer and more inclusive,

352
0:16:24.233,000 --> 0:16:27,000
and by fairer, more truly competitive,

353
0:16:28.167,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and by more truly competitive,

354
0:16:29.929,000 --> 0:16:31,000
more able to generate the solutions

355
0:16:32.745,000 --> 0:16:33,000
to human problems

356
0:16:34.217,000 --> 0:16:39,000
that are the true drivers of growth and prosperity.

357
0:16:39.847,000 --> 0:16:42,000
Capitalism is the greatest social technology

358
0:16:43.12,000 --> 0:16:44,000
ever invented

359
0:16:44.589,000 --> 0:16:46,000
for creating prosperity in human societies,

360
0:16:47.451,000 --> 0:16:48,000
if it is well managed,

361
0:16:49.185,000 --> 0:16:52,000
but capitalism, because of the fundamental

362
0:16:52.356,000 --> 0:16:54,000
multiplicative dynamics of complex systems,

363
0:16:55.121,000 --> 0:16:58,000
tends towards, inexorably, inequality,

364
0:16:58.649,000 --> 0:17:02,000
concentration and collapse.

365
0:17:03.07,000 --> 0:17:05,000
The work of democracies

366
0:17:05.518,000 --> 0:17:09,000
is to maximize the inclusion of the many

367
0:17:10.021,000 --> 0:17:12,000
in order to create prosperity,

368
0:17:12.998,000 --> 0:17:15,000
not to enable the few to accumulate money.

369
0:17:16.92,000 --> 0:17:19,000
Government does create prosperity and growth,

370
0:17:20.02,000 --> 0:17:23,000
by creating the conditions that allow

371
0:17:23.246,000 --> 0:17:25,000
both entrepreneurs and their customers

372
0:17:26.137,000 --> 0:17:27,000
to thrive.

373
0:17:27.982,000 --> 0:17:3,000
Balancing the power of capitalists like me

374
0:17:31.166,000 --> 0:17:34,000
and workers isn't bad for capitalism.

375
0:17:34.338,000 --> 0:17:35,000
It's essential to it.

376
0:17:36.138,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Programs like a reasonable minimum wage,

377
0:17:38.804,000 --> 0:17:4,000
affordable healthcare,

378
0:17:40.818,000 --> 0:17:41,000
paid sick leave,

379
0:17:42.121,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and the progressive taxation necessary

380
0:17:45.54,000 --> 0:17:47,000
to pay for the important infrastructure

381
0:17:47.736,000 --> 0:17:51,000
necessary for the middle class like education, R and D,

382
0:17:51.787,000 --> 0:17:53,000
these are indispensable tools

383
0:17:54.353,000 --> 0:17:56,000
shrewd capitalists should embrace

384
0:17:56.462,000 --> 0:17:59,000
to drive growth, because no one benefits from it

385
0:18:00.448,000 --> 0:18:01,000
like us.

386
0:18:02.094,000 --> 0:18:04,000
Many economists would have you believe

387
0:18:04.342,000 --> 0:18:07,000
that their field is an objective science.

388
0:18:07.422,000 --> 0:18:09,000
I disagree, and I think that it is equally

389
0:18:10.269,000 --> 0:18:12,000
a tool that humans use

390
0:18:12.338,000 --> 0:18:13,000
to enforce and encode

391
0:18:14.227,000 --> 0:18:17,000
our social and moral preferences and prejudices

392
0:18:17.803,000 --> 0:18:2,000
about status and power,

393
0:18:21.705,000 --> 0:18:23,000
which is why plutocrats like me

394
0:18:23.982,000 --> 0:18:27,000
have always needed to find persuasive stories

395
0:18:27.988,000 --> 0:18:28,000
to tell everyone else

396
0:18:29.662,000 --> 0:18:33,000
about why our relative positions

397
0:18:33.776,000 --> 0:18:37,000
are morally righteous and good for everyone:

398
0:18:37.908,000 --> 0:18:41,000
like, we are indispensable, the job creators,

399
0:18:42.183,000 --> 0:18:44,000
and you are not;

400
0:18:44.545,000 --> 0:18:47,000
like, tax cuts for us create growth,

401
0:18:47.931,000 --> 0:18:49,000
but investments in you

402
0:18:49.945,000 --> 0:18:5,000
will balloon our debt

403
0:18:51.621,000 --> 0:18:53,000
and bankrupt our great country;

404
0:18:54.129,000 --> 0:18:55,000
that we matter;

405
0:18:55.997,000 --> 0:18:57,000
that you don't.

406
0:18:58.348,000 --> 0:19:,000
For thousands of years, these stories were called

407
0:19:00.991,000 --> 0:19:01,000
divine right.

408
0:19:02.439,000 --> 0:19:06,000
Today, we have trickle-down economics.

409
0:19:06.693,000 --> 0:19:09,000
How obviously, transparently self-serving

410
0:19:10.576,000 --> 0:19:11,000
all of this is.

411
0:19:12.17,000 --> 0:19:14,000
We plutocrats need to see

412
0:19:14.952,000 --> 0:19:16,000
that the United States of America made us,

413
0:19:17.305,000 --> 0:19:18,000
not the other way around;

414
0:19:18.989,000 --> 0:19:2,000
that a thriving middle class is the source

415
0:19:21.827,000 --> 0:19:23,000
of prosperity in capitalist economies,

416
0:19:24.123,000 --> 0:19:26,000
not a consequence of it.

417
0:19:26.762,000 --> 0:19:28,000
And we should never forget

418
0:19:29.453,000 --> 0:19:32,000
that even the best of us in the worst of circumstances

419
0:19:33.148,000 --> 0:19:38,000
are barefoot by the side of a dirt road selling fruit.

420
0:19:38.882,000 --> 0:19:4,000
Fellow plutocrats, I think it may be time for us

421
0:19:41.496,000 --> 0:19:43,000
to recommit to our country,

422
0:19:43.699,000 --> 0:19:45,000
to commit to a new kind of capitalism

423
0:19:46.261,000 --> 0:19:5,000
which is both more inclusive and more effective,

424
0:19:50.615,000 --> 0:19:52,000
a capitalism that will ensure

425
0:19:52.673,000 --> 0:19:55,000
that America's economy remains

426
0:19:55.834,000 --> 0:19:58,000
the most dynamic and prosperous in the world.

427
0:19:59.22,000 --> 0:20:01,000
Let's secure the future for ourselves,

428
0:20:01.38,000 --> 0:20:03,000
our children and their children.

429
0:20:04.114,000 --> 0:20:07,000
Or alternatively, we could do nothing,

430
0:20:07.162,000 --> 0:20:09,000
hide in our gated communities

431
0:20:09.243,000 --> 0:20:11,000
and private schools,

432
0:20:12.1,000 --> 0:20:14,000
enjoy our planes and yachts

433
0:20:14.136,000 --> 0:20:16,000
— they're fun —

434
0:20:16.476,000 --> 0:20:17,000
and wait for the pitchforks.

435
0:20:18.287,000 --> 0:20:19,000
Thank you.

436
0:20:19.81,000 --> 0:20:2,000
(Applause)

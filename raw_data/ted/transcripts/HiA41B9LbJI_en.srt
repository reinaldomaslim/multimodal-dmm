2
0:00:13.992,000 --> 0:00:14,000
You don't know them.

3
0:00:16.15,000 --> 0:00:17,000
You don't see them.

4
0:00:18.405,000 --> 0:00:2,000
But they're always around,

5
0:00:21.404,000 --> 0:00:22,000
whispering,

6
0:00:23.108,000 --> 0:00:24,000
making secret plans,

7
0:00:25.7,000 --> 0:00:28,000
building armies with millions of soldiers.

8
0:00:30.826,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And when they decide to attack,

9
0:00:33.435,000 --> 0:00:35,000
they all attack at the same time.

10
0:00:39.13,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I'm talking about bacteria.

11
0:00:40.933,000 --> 0:00:41,000
(Laughter)

12
0:00:42.282,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Who did you think I was talking about?

13
0:00:46.401,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Bacteria live in communities just like humans.

14
0:00:49.619,000 --> 0:00:5,000
They have families,

15
0:00:50.916,000 --> 0:00:51,000
they talk,

16
0:00:52.091,000 --> 0:00:53,000
and they plan their activities.

17
0:00:53.957,000 --> 0:00:55,000
And just like humans, they trick, deceive,

18
0:00:56.638,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and some might even cheat on each other.

19
0:01:00.127,000 --> 0:01:03,000
What if I tell you that we can listen to bacterial conversations

20
0:01:03.998,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and translate their confidential information into human language?

21
0:01:08.255,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And what if I tell you that translating bacterial conversations can save lives?

22
0:01:14.519,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I hold a PhD in nanophysics,

23
0:01:16.314,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and I've used nanotechnology to develop a real-time translation tool

24
0:01:20.714,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that can spy on bacterial communities

25
0:01:23.057,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and give us recordings of what bacteria are up to.

26
0:01:28.123,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Bacteria live everywhere.

27
0:01:29.743,000 --> 0:01:31,000
They're in the soil, on our furniture

28
0:01:32.096,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and inside our bodies.

29
0:01:34.083,000 --> 0:01:38,000
In fact, 90 percent of all the live cells in this theater are bacterial.

30
0:01:39.915,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Some bacteria are good for us;

31
0:01:41.538,000 --> 0:01:44,000
they help us digest food or produce antibiotics.

32
0:01:44.774,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And some bacteria are bad for us;

33
0:01:46.89,000 --> 0:01:47,000
they cause diseases and death.

34
0:01:49.794,000 --> 0:01:51,000
To coordinate all the functions bacteria have,

35
0:01:52.234,000 --> 0:01:54,000
they have to be able to organize,

36
0:01:54.33,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and they do that just like us humans --

37
0:01:56.395,000 --> 0:01:57,000
by communicating.

38
0:01:58.751,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But instead of using words,

39
0:02:00.25,000 --> 0:02:02,000
they use signaling molecules to communicate with each other.

40
0:02:04.083,000 --> 0:02:05,000
When bacteria are few,

41
0:02:05.364,000 --> 0:02:07,000
the signaling molecules just flow away,

42
0:02:08.131,000 --> 0:02:1,000
like the screams of a man alone in the desert.

43
0:02:11.518,000 --> 0:02:14,000
But when there are many bacteria, the signaling molecules accumulate,

44
0:02:15.534,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and the bacteria start sensing that they're not alone.

45
0:02:19.309,000 --> 0:02:2,000
They listen to each other.

46
0:02:21.459,000 --> 0:02:23,000
In this way, they keep track of how many they are

47
0:02:24.299,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and when they're many enough to initiate a new action.

48
0:02:28.575,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And when the signaling molecules have reached a certain threshold,

49
0:02:32.456,000 --> 0:02:35,000
all the bacteria sense at once that they need to act

50
0:02:35.601,000 --> 0:02:36,000
with the same action.

51
0:02:37.967,000 --> 0:02:41,000
So bacterial conversation consists of an initiative and a reaction,

52
0:02:42.317,000 --> 0:02:45,000
a production of a molecule and the response to it.

53
0:02:47.094,000 --> 0:02:5,000
In my research, I focused on spying on bacterial communities

54
0:02:50.458,000 --> 0:02:51,000
inside the human body.

55
0:02:52.343,000 --> 0:02:53,000
How does it work?

56
0:02:54.385,000 --> 0:02:55,000
We have a sample from a patient.

57
0:02:56.324,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It could be a blood or spit sample.

58
0:02:59.304,000 --> 0:03:01,000
We shoot electrons into the sample,

59
0:03:01.865,000 --> 0:03:04,000
the electrons will interact with any communication molecules present,

60
0:03:05.809,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and this interaction will give us information

61
0:03:08.214,000 --> 0:03:09,000
on the identity of the bacteria,

62
0:03:10.129,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the type of communication

63
0:03:11.824,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and how much the bacteria are talking.

64
0:03:16.269,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But what is it like when bacteria communicate?

65
0:03:19.747,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Before I developed the translation tool,

66
0:03:23.531,000 --> 0:03:26,000
my first assumption was that bacteria would have a primitive language,

67
0:03:27.401,000 --> 0:03:3,000
like infants that haven't developed words and sentences yet.

68
0:03:31.208,000 --> 0:03:33,000
When they laugh, they're happy; when they cry, they're sad.

69
0:03:34.153,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Simple as that.

70
0:03:36.008,000 --> 0:03:4,000
But bacteria turned out to be nowhere as primitive as I thought they would be.

71
0:03:40.615,000 --> 0:03:42,000
A molecule is not just a molecule.

72
0:03:42.879,000 --> 0:03:44,000
It can mean different things depending on the context,

73
0:03:46.404,000 --> 0:03:48,000
just like the crying of babies can mean different things:

74
0:03:49.37,000 --> 0:03:5,000
sometimes the baby is hungry,

75
0:03:51.164,000 --> 0:03:52,000
sometimes it's wet,

76
0:03:52.382,000 --> 0:03:54,000
sometimes it's hurt or afraid.

77
0:03:54.425,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Parents know how to decode those cries.

78
0:03:57.624,000 --> 0:03:58,000
And to be a real translation tool,

79
0:03:59.53,000 --> 0:04:01,000
it had to be able to decode the signaling molecules

80
0:04:02.527,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and translate them depending on the context.

81
0:04:07.497,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And who knows?

82
0:04:08.672,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Maybe Google Translate will adopt this soon.

83
0:04:10.857,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Laughter)

84
0:04:14.386,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Let me give you an example.

85
0:04:16.128,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I've brought some bacterial data that can be a bit tricky to understand

86
0:04:19.741,000 --> 0:04:2,000
if you're not trained,

87
0:04:20.916,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but try to take a look.

88
0:04:23.548,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

89
0:04:26.959,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Here's a happy bacterial family that has infected a patient.

90
0:04:32.261,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Let's call them the Montague family.

91
0:04:35.92,000 --> 0:04:38,000
They share resources, they reproduce, and they grow.

92
0:04:40.294,000 --> 0:04:41,000
One day, they get a new neighbor,

93
0:04:44.746,000 --> 0:04:45,000
bacterial family Capulet.

94
0:04:46.537,000 --> 0:04:47,000
(Laughter)

95
0:04:48.157,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Everything is fine, as long as they're working together.

96
0:04:52.377,000 --> 0:04:55,000
But then something unplanned happens.

97
0:04:56.449,000 --> 0:05:,000
Romeo from Montague has a relationship with Juliet from Capulet.

98
0:05:00.691,000 --> 0:05:01,000
(Laughter)

99
0:05:02.978,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And yes, they share genetic material.

100
0:05:05.897,000 --> 0:05:07,000
(Laughter)

101
0:05:10.63,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Now, this gene transfer can be dangerous to the Montagues

102
0:05:13.405,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that have the ambition to be the only family in the patient they have infected,

103
0:05:17.495,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and sharing genes contributes

104
0:05:18.943,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to the Capulets developing resistance to antibiotics.

105
0:05:23.747,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So the Montagues start talking internally to get rid of this other family

106
0:05:28.416,000 --> 0:05:29,000
by releasing this molecule.

107
0:05:30.688,000 --> 0:05:31,000
(Laughter)

108
0:05:32.7,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And with subtitles:

109
0:05:34.372,000 --> 0:05:35,000
[Let us coordinate an attack.]

110
0:05:36.002,000 --> 0:05:37,000
(Laughter)

111
0:05:37.639,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Let's coordinate an attack.

112
0:05:41.148,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And then everybody at once responds

113
0:05:44.272,000 --> 0:05:48,000
by releasing a poison that will kill the other family.

114
0:05:48.619,000 --> 0:05:49,000
[Eliminate!]

115
0:05:52.129,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:55.338,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The Capulets respond by calling for a counterattack.

117
0:05:59.755,000 --> 0:06:,000
[Counterattack!]

118
0:06:00.935,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And they have a battle.

119
0:06:04.09,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This is a video of real bacteria dueling with swordlike organelles,

120
0:06:08.732,000 --> 0:06:09,000
where they try to kill each other

121
0:06:10.369,000 --> 0:06:12,000
by literally stabbing and rupturing each other.

122
0:06:14.784,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Whoever's family wins this battle becomes the dominant bacteria.

123
0:06:20.36,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So what I can do is to detect bacterial conversations

124
0:06:23.663,000 --> 0:06:25,000
that lead to different collective behaviors

125
0:06:25.719,000 --> 0:06:26,000
like the fight you just saw.

126
0:06:27.633,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And what I did was to spy on bacterial communities

127
0:06:30.574,000 --> 0:06:32,000
inside the human body

128
0:06:32.641,000 --> 0:06:33,000
in patients at a hospital.

129
0:06:34.737,000 --> 0:06:36,000
I followed 62 patients in an experiment,

130
0:06:37.231,000 --> 0:06:4,000
where I tested the patient samples for one particular infection,

131
0:06:41.003,000 --> 0:06:44,000
without knowing the results of the traditional diagnostic test.

132
0:06:44.356,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Now, in bacterial diagnostics,

133
0:06:48.6,000 --> 0:06:49,000
a sample is smeared out on a plate,

134
0:06:50.605,000 --> 0:06:53,000
and if the bacteria grow within five days,

135
0:06:53.753,000 --> 0:06:55,000
the patient is diagnosed as infected.

136
0:06:57.842,000 --> 0:06:59,000
When I finished the study and I compared the tool results

137
0:07:00.685,000 --> 0:07:03,000
to the traditional diagnostic test and the validation test,

138
0:07:03.947,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I was shocked.

139
0:07:05.371,000 --> 0:07:08,000
It was far more astonishing than I had ever anticipated.

140
0:07:10.011,000 --> 0:07:12,000
But before I tell you what the tool revealed,

141
0:07:12.174,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I would like to tell you about a specific patient I followed,

142
0:07:15.192,000 --> 0:07:16,000
a young girl.

143
0:07:16.803,000 --> 0:07:17,000
She had cystic fibrosis,

144
0:07:18.277,000 --> 0:07:21,000
a genetic disease that made her lungs susceptible to bacterial infections.

145
0:07:22.837,000 --> 0:07:24,000
This girl wasn't a part of the clinical trial.

146
0:07:25.257,000 --> 0:07:27,000
I followed her because I knew from her medical record

147
0:07:28.108,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that she had never had an infection before.

148
0:07:31.453,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Once a month, this girl went to the hospital

149
0:07:33.582,000 --> 0:07:35,000
to cough up a sputum sample that she spit in a cup.

150
0:07:36.916,000 --> 0:07:39,000
This sample was transferred for bacterial analysis

151
0:07:40.066,000 --> 0:07:41,000
at the central laboratory

152
0:07:42.02,000 --> 0:07:45,000
so the doctors could act quickly if they discovered an infection.

153
0:07:46.099,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And it allowed me to test my device on her samples as well.

154
0:07:49.355,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The first two months I measured on her samples, there was nothing.

155
0:07:53.794,000 --> 0:07:54,000
But the third month,

156
0:07:54.985,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I discovered some bacterial chatter in her sample.

157
0:07:58.473,000 --> 0:08:01,000
The bacteria were coordinating to damage her lung tissue.

158
0:08:02.534,000 --> 0:08:06,000
But the traditional diagnostics showed no bacteria at all.

159
0:08:07.711,000 --> 0:08:08,000
I measured again the next month,

160
0:08:09.654,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and I could see that the bacterial conversations became even more aggressive.

161
0:08:14.167,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Still, the traditional diagnostics showed nothing.

162
0:08:18.456,000 --> 0:08:21,000
My study ended, but a half a year later, I followed up on her status

163
0:08:22.124,000 --> 0:08:25,000
to see if the bacteria only I knew about had disappeared

164
0:08:25.389,000 --> 0:08:27,000
without medical intervention.

165
0:08:28.35,000 --> 0:08:29,000
They hadn't.

166
0:08:30.02,000 --> 0:08:32,000
But the girl was now diagnosed with a severe infection

167
0:08:32.877,000 --> 0:08:33,000
of deadly bacteria.

168
0:08:35.511,000 --> 0:08:39,000
It was the very same bacteria my tool discovered earlier.

169
0:08:40.537,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And despite aggressive antibiotic treatment,

170
0:08:43.057,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it was impossible to eradicate the infection.

171
0:08:46.816,000 --> 0:08:49,000
Doctors deemed that she would not survive her 20s.

172
0:08:52.404,000 --> 0:08:54,000
When I measured on this girl's samples,

173
0:08:54.533,000 --> 0:08:56,000
my tool was still in the initial stage.

174
0:08:56.756,000 --> 0:08:58,000
I didn't even know if my method worked at all,

175
0:08:59.479,000 --> 0:09:01,000
therefore I had an agreement with the doctors

176
0:09:01.65,000 --> 0:09:02,000
not to tell them what my tool revealed

177
0:09:03.535,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in order not to compromise their treatment.

178
0:09:06.111,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So when I saw these results that weren't even validated,

179
0:09:08.938,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I didn't dare to tell

180
0:09:10.314,000 --> 0:09:12,000
because treating a patient without an actual infection

181
0:09:13.145,000 --> 0:09:15,000
also has negative consequences for the patient.

182
0:09:17.092,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But now we know better,

183
0:09:18.738,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and there are many young boys and girls that still can be saved

184
0:09:23.172,000 --> 0:09:26,000
because, unfortunately, this scenario happens very often.

185
0:09:26.62,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Patients get infected,

186
0:09:28.187,000 --> 0:09:31,000
the bacteria somehow don't show on the traditional diagnostic test,

187
0:09:31.688,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and suddenly, the infection breaks out in the patient with severe symptoms.

188
0:09:35.564,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And at that point, it's already too late.

189
0:09:39.219,000 --> 0:09:42,000
The surprising result of the 62 patients I followed

190
0:09:42.797,000 --> 0:09:44,000
was that my device caught bacterial conversations

191
0:09:45.364,000 --> 0:09:47,000
in more than half of the patient samples

192
0:09:47.604,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that were diagnosed as negative by traditional methods.

193
0:09:51.501,000 --> 0:09:54,000
In other words, more than half of these patients went home thinking

194
0:09:55.079,000 --> 0:09:56,000
they were free from infection,

195
0:09:56.788,000 --> 0:09:58,000
although they actually carried dangerous bacteria.

196
0:10:01.257,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Inside these wrongly diagnosed patients,

197
0:10:03.578,000 --> 0:10:06,000
bacteria were coordinating a synchronized attack.

198
0:10:07.53,000 --> 0:10:08,000
They were whispering to each other.

199
0:10:09.892,000 --> 0:10:1,000
What I call "whispering bacteria"

200
0:10:11.547,000 --> 0:10:14,000
are bacteria that traditional methods cannot diagnose.

201
0:10:15.383,000 --> 0:10:18,000
So far, it's only the translation tool that can catch those whispers.

202
0:10:20.364,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I believe that the time frame in which bacteria are still whispering

203
0:10:23.791,000 --> 0:10:25,000
is a window of opportunity for targeted treatment.

204
0:10:27.608,000 --> 0:10:3,000
If the girl had been treated during this window of opportunity,

205
0:10:30.765,000 --> 0:10:32,000
it might have been possible to kill the bacteria

206
0:10:33.29,000 --> 0:10:34,000
in their initial stage,

207
0:10:34.779,000 --> 0:10:36,000
before the infection got out of hand.

208
0:10:39.131,000 --> 0:10:42,000
What I experienced with this young girl made me decide to do everything I can

209
0:10:43.126,000 --> 0:10:45,000
to push this technology into the hospital.

210
0:10:46.212,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Together with doctors,

211
0:10:47.387,000 --> 0:10:49,000
I'm already working on implementing this tool in clinics

212
0:10:50.38,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to diagnose early infections.

213
0:10:53.319,000 --> 0:10:56,000
Although it's still not known how doctors should treat patients

214
0:10:56.587,000 --> 0:10:57,000
during the whispering phase,

215
0:10:58.424,000 --> 0:11:01,000
this tool can help doctors keep a closer eye on patients in risk.

216
0:11:02.548,000 --> 0:11:05,000
It could help them confirm if a treatment had worked or not,

217
0:11:05.854,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and it could help answer simple questions:

218
0:11:08.642,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Is the patient infected?

219
0:11:10.396,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And what are the bacteria up to?

220
0:11:12.958,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Bacteria talk,

221
0:11:14.769,000 --> 0:11:16,000
they make secret plans,

222
0:11:16.819,000 --> 0:11:18,000
and they send confidential information to each other.

223
0:11:20.253,000 --> 0:11:22,000
But not only can we catch them whispering,

224
0:11:22.956,000 --> 0:11:24,000
we can all learn their secret language

225
0:11:25.447,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and become ourselves bacterial whisperers.

226
0:11:28.973,000 --> 0:11:29,000
And, as bacteria would say,

227
0:11:31.656,000 --> 0:11:34,000
"3-oxo-C12-aniline."

228
0:11:35.763,000 --> 0:11:36,000
(Laughter)

229
0:11:36.955,000 --> 0:11:37,000
(Applause)

230
0:11:38.064,000 --> 0:11:39,000
Thank you.

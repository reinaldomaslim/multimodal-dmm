1
0:00:12.88,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So when I was a kid ...

2
0:00:15.08,000 --> 0:00:16,000
this was my team.

3
0:00:16.4,000 --> 0:00:17,000
(Laughter)

4
0:00:17.6,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I stunk at sports.

5
0:00:19.64,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I didn't like to play them, I didn't like to watch them.

6
0:00:22.88,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So this is what I did. I went fishing.

7
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And for all of my growing up I fished on the shores of Connecticut,

8
0:00:28.68,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and these are the creatures that I saw on a regular basis.

9
0:00:32.6,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But after I grew up and went to college,

10
0:00:35.24,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and I came home in the early 90's,

11
0:00:37.92,000 --> 0:00:38,000
this is what I found.

12
0:00:39.64,000 --> 0:00:4,000
My team had shrunk.

13
0:00:41.28,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It was like literally having your roster devastated.

14
0:00:44.4,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And as I sort of looked into that,

15
0:00:46.44,000 --> 0:00:48,000
from a very personal point of view as a fisherman,

16
0:00:48.84,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I started to kind of figure out,

17
0:00:50.44,000 --> 0:00:52,000
well, what was the rest of the world thinking about it?

18
0:00:53.04,000 --> 0:00:55,000
First place I started to look was fish markets.

19
0:00:55.28,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And when I went to fish markets,

20
0:00:57.08,000 --> 0:00:58,000
in spite of where I was --

21
0:00:58.36,000 --> 0:01:02,000
whether I was in North Carolina, or Paris, or London, or wherever --

22
0:01:02.44,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I kept seeing this weirdly repeating trope of four creatures,

23
0:01:07.64,000 --> 0:01:08,000
again and again --

24
0:01:08.88,000 --> 0:01:09,000
on the menus, on ice --

25
0:01:10.48,000 --> 0:01:12,000
shrimp, tuna, salmon and cod.

26
0:01:13.36,000 --> 0:01:15,000
And I thought this was pretty strange,

27
0:01:15.76,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and as I looked at it, I was wondering,

28
0:01:17.8,000 --> 0:01:2,000
did anyone else notice this sort of shrinking of the market?

29
0:01:21.44,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Well, when I looked into it,

30
0:01:22.84,000 --> 0:01:24,000
I realized that people didn't look at it as their team.

31
0:01:25.76,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Ordinary people, the way they looked at seafood was like this.

32
0:01:29.44,000 --> 0:01:31,000
It's not an unusual human characteristic

33
0:01:31.92,000 --> 0:01:34,000
to reduce the natural world down to very few elements.

34
0:01:35.64,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We did it before, 10,000 years ago, when we came out of our caves.

35
0:01:38.96,000 --> 0:01:4,000
If you look at fire pits from 10,000 years ago,

36
0:01:41.52,000 --> 0:01:43,000
you'll see raccoons, you'll see, you know, wolves,

37
0:01:44.12,000 --> 0:01:46,000
you'll see all kinds of different creatures.

38
0:01:46.2,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But if you telescope to the age of -- you know, 2,000 years ago,

39
0:01:49.88,000 --> 0:01:5,000
you'll see these four mammals:

40
0:01:51.8,000 --> 0:01:53,000
pigs, cows, sheep and goats.

41
0:01:54.24,000 --> 0:01:55,000
It's true of birds, too.

42
0:01:55.48,000 --> 0:01:57,000
You look at the menus in New York City restaurants

43
0:01:58.32,000 --> 0:01:59,000
150 years ago, 200 years ago,

44
0:02:00.24,000 --> 0:02:04,000
you'll see snipe, woodcock, grouse, dozens of ducks, dozens of geese.

45
0:02:05,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But telescope ahead to the age of modern animal husbandry,

46
0:02:07.96,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and you'll see four:

47
0:02:09.36,000 --> 0:02:11,000
turkeys, ducks, chicken and geese.

48
0:02:12.48,000 --> 0:02:14,000
So it makes sense that we've headed in this direction.

49
0:02:15.08,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But how have we headed in this direction?

50
0:02:17.057,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Well ...

51
0:02:18.28,000 --> 0:02:19,000
first it's a very, very new problem.

52
0:02:20.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
This is the way we've been fishing the oceans over the last 50 years.

53
0:02:23.92,000 --> 0:02:28,000
World War II was a tremendous incentive to arm ourselves in a war against fish.

54
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
All of the technology that we perfected during World War II --

55
0:02:32.44,000 --> 0:02:33,000
sonar, lightweight polymers --

56
0:02:34.12,000 --> 0:02:36,000
all these things were redirected towards fish.

57
0:02:36.44,000 --> 0:02:39,000
And so you see this tremendous buildup in fishing capacity,

58
0:02:39.88,000 --> 0:02:4,000
quadrupling in the course of time,

59
0:02:41.56,000 --> 0:02:43,000
from the end of World War II to the present time.

60
0:02:44.48,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And right now that means

61
0:02:45.88,000 --> 0:02:48,000
we're taking between 80 and 90 million metric tons out of the sea every year.

62
0:02:49.56,000 --> 0:02:52,000
That's the equivalent of the human weight of China

63
0:02:52.8,000 --> 0:02:53,000
taken out of the sea every year.

64
0:02:54.36,000 --> 0:02:56,000
And it's no coincidence that I use China as the example

65
0:02:57,000 --> 0:03:,000
because China is now the largest fishing nation in the world.

66
0:03:00.04,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Well, that's only half the story.

67
0:03:01.68,000 --> 0:03:02,000
The other half of the story

68
0:03:03.08,000 --> 0:03:07,000
is this incredible boom in fish farming and aquaculture,

69
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
which is now, only in the last year or two,

70
0:03:09.4,000 --> 0:03:12,000
starting to exceed the amount of wild fish that we produce.

71
0:03:12.8,000 --> 0:03:16,000
So that if you add wild fish and farmed fish together,

72
0:03:16.84,000 --> 0:03:19,000
you get the equivalent of two Chinas created from the ocean

73
0:03:20.32,000 --> 0:03:21,000
each and every year.

74
0:03:21.6,000 --> 0:03:24,000
And again, it's not a coincidence that I use China as the example,

75
0:03:24.76,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because China, in addition to being the biggest catcher of fish,

76
0:03:27.84,000 --> 0:03:29,000
is also the biggest farmer of fish.

77
0:03:30.84,000 --> 0:03:34,000
So let's look though at the four choices we are making right now.

78
0:03:35.4,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The first one --

79
0:03:36.64,000 --> 0:03:39,000
by far the most consumed seafood in America and in much of the West,

80
0:03:40.36,000 --> 0:03:41,000
is shrimp.

81
0:03:41.6,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Shrimp in the wild -- as a wild product --

82
0:03:44.08,000 --> 0:03:45,000
is a terrible product.

83
0:03:45.44,000 --> 0:03:49,000
5, 10, 15 pounds of wild fish are regularly killed

84
0:03:49.92,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to bring one pound of shrimp to the market.

85
0:03:52.36,000 --> 0:03:55,000
They're also incredibly fuel inefficient to bring to the market.

86
0:03:55.48,000 --> 0:03:58,000
In a recent study that was produced out of Dalhousie University,

87
0:03:58.6,000 --> 0:03:59,000
it was found that dragging for shrimp

88
0:04:00.44,000 --> 0:04:03,000
is one of the most carbon-intensive ways of fishing that you can find.

89
0:04:04.64,000 --> 0:04:05,000
So you can farm them,

90
0:04:06.32,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and people do farm them,

91
0:04:07.6,000 --> 0:04:09,000
and they farm them a lot in this very area.

92
0:04:09.64,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Problem is ...

93
0:04:10.88,000 --> 0:04:13,000
the place where you farm shrimp is in these wild habitats --

94
0:04:14.12,000 --> 0:04:15,000
in mangrove forests.

95
0:04:15.36,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Now look at those lovely roots coming down.

96
0:04:17.44,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Those are the things that hold soil together,

97
0:04:19.56,000 --> 0:04:22,000
protect coasts, create habitats for all sorts of young fish, young shrimp,

98
0:04:23.36,000 --> 0:04:25,000
all sorts of things that are important to this environment.

99
0:04:26.161,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Well, this is what happens to a lot of coastal mangrove forests.

100
0:04:29.185,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We've lost millions of acres of coastal mangroves

101
0:04:31.519,000 --> 0:04:32,000
over the last 30 or 40 years.

102
0:04:32.959,000 --> 0:04:34,000
That rate of destruction has slowed,

103
0:04:35.44,000 --> 0:04:37,000
but we're still in a major mangrove deficit.

104
0:04:38.76,000 --> 0:04:39,000
The other thing that's going on here

105
0:04:40.52,000 --> 0:04:43,000
is a phenomenon that the filmmaker Mark Benjamin called "Grinding Nemo."

106
0:04:44.68,000 --> 0:04:46,000
This phenomenon is very, very relevant

107
0:04:47.2,000 --> 0:04:49,000
to anything that you've ever seen on a tropical reef.

108
0:04:49.72,000 --> 0:04:5,000
Because what's going on right now,

109
0:04:51.4,000 --> 0:04:53,000
we have shrimp draggers dragging for shrimp,

110
0:04:53.6,000 --> 0:04:54,000
catching a huge amount of bycatch,

111
0:04:55.48,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that bycatch in turn gets ground up and turned into shrimp food.

112
0:04:59.6,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And sometimes, many of these vessels --

113
0:05:01.76,000 --> 0:05:02,000
manned by slaves --

114
0:05:03.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
are catching these so-called "trash fish,"

115
0:05:05.88,000 --> 0:05:06,000
fish that we would love to see on a reef,

116
0:05:07.857,000 --> 0:05:08,000
grinding them up

117
0:05:09.08,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and turning them into shrimp feed --

118
0:05:10.864,000 --> 0:05:13,000
an ecosystem literally eating itself and spitting out shrimp.

119
0:05:15.12,000 --> 0:05:17,000
The next most consumed seafood in America,

120
0:05:17.32,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and also throughout the West,

121
0:05:19.04,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is tuna.

122
0:05:20.28,000 --> 0:05:23,000
So tuna is this ultimate global fish.

123
0:05:23.36,000 --> 0:05:26,000
These huge management areas have to be observed

124
0:05:26.4,000 --> 0:05:27,000
in order for tuna to be well managed.

125
0:05:28.36,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Our own management area,

126
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
called a Regional Fisheries Management Organization,

127
0:05:32.64,000 --> 0:05:33,000
is called ICCAT,

128
0:05:33.88,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.

129
0:05:37.12,000 --> 0:05:39,000
The great naturalist Carl Safina once called it,

130
0:05:39.84,000 --> 0:05:42,000
"The International Conspiracy to Catch all the Tunas."

131
0:05:43.12,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Of course we've seen incredible improvement

132
0:05:45.2,000 --> 0:05:46,000
in ICCAT in the last few years,

133
0:05:46.72,000 --> 0:05:47,000
there is total room for improvement,

134
0:05:48.48,000 --> 0:05:5,000
but it remains to be said that tuna is a global fish,

135
0:05:51.4,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and to manage it, we have to manage the globe.

136
0:05:54.24,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Well, we could also try to grow tuna

137
0:05:56.2,000 --> 0:05:59,000
but tuna is a spectacularly bad animal for aquaculture.

138
0:05:59.84,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Many people don't know this but tuna are warm-blooded.

139
0:06:02.96,000 --> 0:06:05,000
They can heat their bodies 20 degrees above ambient temperature,

140
0:06:06.4,000 --> 0:06:08,000
they can swim at over 40 miles an hour.

141
0:06:08.52,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So that pretty much eliminates

142
0:06:10.28,000 --> 0:06:12,000
all the advantages of farming a fish, right?

143
0:06:12.4,000 --> 0:06:13,000
A farmed fish is --

144
0:06:13.64,000 --> 0:06:15,000
or a fish is cold-blooded, it doesn't move too much.

145
0:06:16.093,000 --> 0:06:18,000
That's a great thing for growing protein.

146
0:06:18.12,000 --> 0:06:2,000
But if you've got this crazy, wild creature

147
0:06:20.48,000 --> 0:06:22,000
that swims at 40 miles an hour and heats its blood --

148
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:25,000
not a great candidate for aquaculture.

149
0:06:25.76,000 --> 0:06:26,000
The next creature --

150
0:06:27,000 --> 0:06:29,000
most consumed seafood in America and throughout the West --

151
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:31,000
is salmon.

152
0:06:31.24,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Now salmon got its plundering, too,

153
0:06:33.44,000 --> 0:06:36,000
but it didn't really necessarily happen through fishing.

154
0:06:36.6,000 --> 0:06:37,000
This is my home state of Connecticut.

155
0:06:38.4,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Connecticut used to be home to a lot of wild salmon.

156
0:06:41.48,000 --> 0:06:43,000
But if you look at this map of Connecticut,

157
0:06:43.56,000 --> 0:06:46,000
every dot on that map is a dam.

158
0:06:47.4,000 --> 0:06:5,000
There are over 3,000 dams in the state of Connecticut.

159
0:06:51.28,000 --> 0:06:54,000
I often say this is why people in Connecticut are so uptight --

160
0:06:54.84,000 --> 0:06:55,000
(Laughter)

161
0:06:56.44,000 --> 0:06:59,000
If somebody could just unblock Connecticut's chi,

162
0:07:,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I feel that we could have an infinitely better world.

163
0:07:02.52,000 --> 0:07:03,000
But I made this particular comment

164
0:07:04.28,000 --> 0:07:06,000
at a convention once of national parks officers,

165
0:07:06.96,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and this guy from North Carolina sidled up to me, he says,

166
0:07:09.72,000 --> 0:07:12,000
"You know, you oughtn't be so hard on your Connecticut,

167
0:07:13.04,000 --> 0:07:17,000
cause we here in North Carolina, we got 35,000 dams."

168
0:07:17.88,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So it's a national epidemic, it's an international epidemic.

169
0:07:20.76,000 --> 0:07:21,000
And there are dams everywhere,

170
0:07:22.24,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and these are precisely the things

171
0:07:23.92,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that stop wild salmon from reaching their spawning grounds.

172
0:07:26.72,000 --> 0:07:28,000
So as a result, we've turned to aquaculture,

173
0:07:28.84,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and salmon is one the most successful, at least from a numbers point of view.

174
0:07:32.52,000 --> 0:07:34,000
When they first started farming salmon,

175
0:07:34.76,000 --> 0:07:36,000
it could take as many as six pounds of wild fish

176
0:07:37.72,000 --> 0:07:39,000
to make a single pound of salmon.

177
0:07:39.92,000 --> 0:07:41,000
The industry has, to its credit, greatly improved.

178
0:07:42.6,000 --> 0:07:43,000
They've gotten it below two to one,

179
0:07:44.291,000 --> 0:07:46,000
although it's a little bit of a cheat

180
0:07:46.6,000 --> 0:07:48,000
because if you look at the way aquaculture feed is produced,

181
0:07:49.44,000 --> 0:07:5,000
they're measuring pellets --

182
0:07:50.92,000 --> 0:07:52,000
pounds of pellets per pound of salmon.

183
0:07:53.2,000 --> 0:07:55,000
Those pellets are in turn reduced fish.

184
0:07:55.88,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So the actual -- what's called the FIFO, the fish in and the fish out --

185
0:07:59.4,000 --> 0:08:,000
kind of hard to say.

186
0:08:00.76,000 --> 0:08:01,000
But in any case,

187
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:03,000
credit to the industry,

188
0:08:03.24,000 --> 0:08:05,000
it has lowered the amount of fish per pound of salmon.

189
0:08:05.84,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Problem is we've also gone crazy

190
0:08:08.04,000 --> 0:08:1,000
with the amount of salmon that we're producing.

191
0:08:10.28,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Aquaculture is the fastest growing food system on the planet.

192
0:08:13.92,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's growing at something like seven percent per year.

193
0:08:16.92,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And so even though we're doing less per fish

194
0:08:20.96,000 --> 0:08:21,000
to bring it to the market,

195
0:08:22.28,000 --> 0:08:24,000
we're still killing a lot of these little fish.

196
0:08:25.04,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And it's not just fish that we're feeding fish to,

197
0:08:28.24,000 --> 0:08:3,000
we're also feeding fish to chickens and pigs.

198
0:08:31.6,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So we've got chickens and they're eating fish,

199
0:08:34.56,000 --> 0:08:38,000
but weirdly, we also have fish that are eating chickens.

200
0:08:38.84,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Because the byproducts of chickens -- feathers, blood, bone --

201
0:08:41.96,000 --> 0:08:43,000
get ground up and fed to fish.

202
0:08:44.28,000 --> 0:08:45,000
So I often wonder,

203
0:08:45.52,000 --> 0:08:48,000
is there a fish that ate a chicken that ate a fish?

204
0:08:49.36,000 --> 0:08:52,000
It's sort of a reworking of the chicken and egg thing. Anyway --

205
0:08:52.4,000 --> 0:08:53,000
(Laughter)

206
0:08:53.52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
All together, though, it results in a terrible mess.

207
0:08:56.32,000 --> 0:08:57,000
What you're talking about

208
0:08:57.72,000 --> 0:09:02,000
is something between 20 and 30 million metric tons of wild creatures

209
0:09:03.4,000 --> 0:09:05,000
that are taken from the ocean and used and ground up.

210
0:09:06.4,000 --> 0:09:08,000
That's the equivalent of a third of a China,

211
0:09:08.48,000 --> 0:09:1,000
or of an entire United States of humans

212
0:09:10.56,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that's taken out of the sea each and every year.

213
0:09:14.16,000 --> 0:09:16,000
The last of the four is a kind of amorphous thing.

214
0:09:16.72,000 --> 0:09:19,000
It's what the industry calls "whitefish."

215
0:09:20.24,000 --> 0:09:22,000
There are many fish that get cycled into this whitefish thing

216
0:09:23.24,000 --> 0:09:25,000
but the way to kind of tell the story, I think,

217
0:09:25.48,000 --> 0:09:27,000
is through that classic piece of American culinary innovation,

218
0:09:28.44,000 --> 0:09:29,000
the Filet-O-Fish sandwich.

219
0:09:29.84,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So the Filet-O-Fish sandwich actually started as halibut.

220
0:09:32.84,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And it started because a local franchise owner

221
0:09:35.2,000 --> 0:09:4,000
found that when he served his McDonald's on Friday, nobody came.

222
0:09:40.76,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Because it was a Catholic community, they needed fish.

223
0:09:43.32,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So he went to Ray Kroc and he said,

224
0:09:45.2,000 --> 0:09:48,000
"I'm going to bring you a fish sandwich, going to be made out of halibut."

225
0:09:48.72,000 --> 0:09:5,000
Ray Kroc said, "I don't think it's going to work.

226
0:09:51.04,000 --> 0:09:52,000
I want to do a Hula Burger,

227
0:09:52.36,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and there's going to be a slice of pineapple on a bun.

228
0:09:54.908,000 --> 0:09:55,000
But let's do this, let's have a bet.

229
0:09:56.668,000 --> 0:09:59,000
Whosever sandwich sells more, that will be the winning sandwich."

230
0:10:00.2,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Well, it's kind of sad for the ocean that the Hula Burger didn't win.

231
0:10:04.56,000 --> 0:10:06,000
So he made his halibut sandwich.

232
0:10:06.72,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Unfortunately though, the sandwich came in at 30 cents.

233
0:10:10.08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Ray wanted the sandwich to come in at 25 cents,

234
0:10:12.64,000 --> 0:10:13,000
so he turned to Atlantic cod.

235
0:10:14.6,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We all know what happened to Atlantic cod in New England.

236
0:10:17.4,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So now the Filet-O-Fish sandwich is made out of Alaska pollock,

237
0:10:20.92,000 --> 0:10:22,000
it's the largest fin fish fishery in the United States,

238
0:10:23.68,000 --> 0:10:27,000
2 to 3 billion pounds of fish taken out of the sea every single year.

239
0:10:28.08,000 --> 0:10:29,000
If we go through the pollock,

240
0:10:29.64,000 --> 0:10:31,000
the next choice is probably going to be tilapia.

241
0:10:32.12,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Tilapia is one of those fish nobody ever heard of 20 years ago.

242
0:10:35.12,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's actually a very efficient converter of plant protein into animal protein,

243
0:10:39.4,000 --> 0:10:41,000
and it's been a godsend to the third world.

244
0:10:41.48,000 --> 0:10:43,000
It's actually a tremendously sustainable solution,

245
0:10:43.88,000 --> 0:10:45,000
it goes from an egg to an adult in nine months.

246
0:10:46.12,000 --> 0:10:48,000
The problem is that when you look about the West,

247
0:10:48.48,000 --> 0:10:5,000
it doesn't do what the West wants it to do.

248
0:10:50.52,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It really doesn't have what's called an oily fish profile.

249
0:10:53.28,000 --> 0:10:55,000
It doesn't have the EPA and DHA omega-3s

250
0:10:55.68,000 --> 0:10:58,000
that we all think are going to make us live forever.

251
0:10:59,000 --> 0:11:,000
So what do we do?

252
0:11:00.52,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I mean, first of all, what about this poor fish, the clupeids?

253
0:11:03.72,000 --> 0:11:07,000
The fish that represent a huge part of that 20 to 30 million metric tons.

254
0:11:08.76,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Well, one possibility that a lot of conservationists have raised

255
0:11:11.84,000 --> 0:11:12,000
is could we eat them?

256
0:11:13.48,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Could we eat them directly instead of feeding them to salmon?

257
0:11:16.4,000 --> 0:11:17,000
There are arguments for it.

258
0:11:17.76,000 --> 0:11:19,000
They are tremendously fuel efficient to bring to market,

259
0:11:20.404,000 --> 0:11:22,000
a fraction of the fuel cost of say, shrimp,

260
0:11:22.52,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and at the very top of the carbon efficiency scale.

261
0:11:25.88,000 --> 0:11:29,000
They also are omega-3 rich, a great source for EPA and DHA.

262
0:11:30.04,000 --> 0:11:31,000
So that is a potential.

263
0:11:31.52,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And if we were to go down that route what I would say is,

264
0:11:35.24,000 --> 0:11:38,000
instead of paying a few bucks a pound -- or a few bucks a ton, really --

265
0:11:39.08,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and making it into aquafeed,

266
0:11:41.08,000 --> 0:11:44,000
could we halve the catch and double the price for the fishermen

267
0:11:44.4,000 --> 0:11:48,000
and make that our way of treating these particular fish?

268
0:11:49.2,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Other possibility though, which is much more interesting,

269
0:11:51.92,000 --> 0:11:53,000
is looking at bivalves, particularly mussels.

270
0:11:54.32,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Now, mussels are very high in EPA and DHA, they're similar to canned tuna.

271
0:11:59.28,000 --> 0:12:,000
They're also extremely fuel efficient.

272
0:12:01.24,000 --> 0:12:02,000
To bring a pound of mussels to market

273
0:12:03.08,000 --> 0:12:06,000
is about a thirtieth of the carbon as required to bring beef to market.

274
0:12:06.72,000 --> 0:12:07,000
They require no forage fish,

275
0:12:08.32,000 --> 0:12:12,000
they actually get their omega-3s by filtering the water of microalgae.

276
0:12:12.6,000 --> 0:12:15,000
In fact, that's where omega-3s come from, they don't come from fish.

277
0:12:15.84,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Microalgae make the omega-3s, they're only bioconcentrated in fish.

278
0:12:19.92,000 --> 0:12:2,000
Mussels and other bivalves

279
0:12:21.2,000 --> 0:12:23,000
do tremendous amounts of water filtration.

280
0:12:23.224,000 --> 0:12:26,000
A single mussel can filter dozens of gallons every single day.

281
0:12:26.8,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And this is incredibly important when we look at the world.

282
0:12:29.6,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Right now, nitrification, overuse of phosphates in our waterways

283
0:12:33.2,000 --> 0:12:35,000
are causing tremendous algal blooms.

284
0:12:35.56,000 --> 0:12:39,000
Over 400 new dead zones have been created in the last 20 years,

285
0:12:39.84,000 --> 0:12:42,000
tremendous sources of marine life death.

286
0:12:44.32,000 --> 0:12:46,000
We also could look at not a fish at all.

287
0:12:46.52,000 --> 0:12:47,000
We could look at a vegetable.

288
0:12:47.96,000 --> 0:12:48,000
We could look at seaweed, the kelps,

289
0:12:49.72,000 --> 0:12:52,000
all these different varieties of things that can be high in omega-3s,

290
0:12:53.08,000 --> 0:12:54,000
can be high in proteins,

291
0:12:54.4,000 --> 0:12:55,000
tremendously good things.

292
0:12:56.04,000 --> 0:12:58,000
They filter the water just like mussels do.

293
0:12:58.72,000 --> 0:12:59,000
And weirdly enough,

294
0:13:,000 --> 0:13:02,000
it turns out that you can actually feed this to cows.

295
0:13:02.64,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Now, I'm not a big fan of cattle.

296
0:13:04.88,000 --> 0:13:05,000
But if you wanted to keep growing cattle

297
0:13:06.84,000 --> 0:13:08,000
in a time and place where water resources are limited,

298
0:13:09.68,000 --> 0:13:12,000
you're growing seaweed in the water, you don't have to water it --

299
0:13:12.8,000 --> 0:13:13,000
major consideration.

300
0:13:14.48,000 --> 0:13:16,000
And the last fish is a question mark.

301
0:13:17.24,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We have the ability to create aquacultured fish

302
0:13:21.12,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that creates a net gain of marine protein for us.

303
0:13:24.56,000 --> 0:13:26,000
This creature would have to be vegetarian,

304
0:13:26.72,000 --> 0:13:27,000
it would have to be fast growing,

305
0:13:28.52,000 --> 0:13:3,000
it would have to be adaptable to a changing climate

306
0:13:31.2,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and it would have to have that oily fish profile,

307
0:13:33.56,000 --> 0:13:36,000
that EPA, DHA, omega-3 fatty acid profile that we're looking for.

308
0:13:37.48,000 --> 0:13:39,000
This exists kind of on paper.

309
0:13:40.44,000 --> 0:13:43,000
I have been reporting on these subjects for 15 years.

310
0:13:44.08,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Every time I do a new story, somebody tells me,

311
0:13:47,000 --> 0:13:49,000
"We can do all that. We can do it. We've figured it all out.

312
0:13:49.88,000 --> 0:13:5,000
We can produce a fish

313
0:13:51.12,000 --> 0:13:53,000
that's a net gain of marine protein and has omega-3s."

314
0:13:53.72,000 --> 0:13:54,000
Great.

315
0:13:54.96,000 --> 0:13:56,000
It doesn't seem to be getting scaled up.

316
0:13:57.12,000 --> 0:13:58,000
It is time to scale this up.

317
0:13:58.88,000 --> 0:13:59,000
If we do,

318
0:14:00.12,000 --> 0:14:03,000
30 million metric tons of seafood, a third of the world catch,

319
0:14:03.64,000 --> 0:14:04,000
stays in the water.

320
0:14:05.88,000 --> 0:14:08,000
So I guess what I'm saying is this is what we've been going with.

321
0:14:09.2,000 --> 0:14:12,000
We tend to go with our appetites rather than our minds.

322
0:14:12.4,000 --> 0:14:15,000
But if we went with this, or some configuration of it,

323
0:14:15.92,000 --> 0:14:16,000
we might have a little more of this.

324
0:14:19.12,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Thank you.

325
0:14:20.36,000 --> 0:14:22,000

1
0:00:12.944,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I want to talk to you tonight

2
0:00:14.991,000 --> 0:00:17,000
about the work that makes all other work possible,

3
0:00:19.279,000 --> 0:00:23,000
about the millions of women who go to work in our homes

4
0:00:23.662,000 --> 0:00:25,000
every single day,

5
0:00:25.867,000 --> 0:00:28,000
caring for children as nannies,

6
0:00:29.672,000 --> 0:00:32,000
caring for our loved ones with disabilities and our elders,

7
0:00:33.166,000 --> 0:00:34,000
as home care workers,

8
0:00:35.596,000 --> 0:00:38,000
maintaining sanity in our homes as cleaners.

9
0:00:39.498,000 --> 0:00:41,000
It's the work that makes all other work possible.

10
0:00:43.472,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And it's mostly done by women, more than 90 percent women,

11
0:00:47.064,000 --> 0:00:49,000
disproportionately women of color.

12
0:00:49.719,000 --> 0:00:54,000
And the work itself is associated with work that women have historically done,

13
0:00:55.4,000 --> 0:00:58,000
work that's been made incredibly invisible

14
0:00:58.626,000 --> 0:01:,000
and taken for granted in our culture.

15
0:01:02.228,000 --> 0:01:06,000
But it's so fundamental to everything else in our world.

16
0:01:06.876,000 --> 0:01:1,000
It makes it possible for all of us to go out and do what we do in the world

17
0:01:11.618,000 --> 0:01:12,000
every single day,

18
0:01:12.96,000 --> 0:01:17,000
knowing that the most precious aspects of our lives are in good hands.

19
0:01:19.239,000 --> 0:01:21,000
But we don't think about it that way.

20
0:01:22.026,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It's almost defined by its invisibility.

21
0:01:26.483,000 --> 0:01:27,000
You could go into any neighborhood

22
0:01:28.19,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and not know which homes are also workplaces.

23
0:01:31.386,000 --> 0:01:32,000
There's no sign.

24
0:01:32.982,000 --> 0:01:34,000
There's no list or registry.

25
0:01:35.926,000 --> 0:01:36,000
It's just invisible.

26
0:01:39.791,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And it's this work that is not even referred to as real work.

27
0:01:45.798,000 --> 0:01:47,000
It's referred to as "help."

28
0:01:48.681,000 --> 0:01:51,000
It's often seen as unskilled,

29
0:01:51.909,000 --> 0:01:53,000
not seen as professional.

30
0:01:55.631,000 --> 0:02:,000
And race has played a profound role in how we value this work in our culture.

31
0:02:01.381,000 --> 0:02:04,000
Some of the first domestic workers in the United States were black women

32
0:02:04.833,000 --> 0:02:05,000
who were enslaved,

33
0:02:06.277,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and racial exclusion has shaped their conditions for generations.

34
0:02:11.066,000 --> 0:02:14,000
In the 1930s, when Congress was discussing the labor laws

35
0:02:14.579,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that would be a part of the New Deal,

36
0:02:16.754,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that would protect all workers,

37
0:02:19.114,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Southern members of Congress refused to support those labor laws

38
0:02:23.904,000 --> 0:02:27,000
if they included protections for domestic workers and farmworkers.

39
0:02:29.503,000 --> 0:02:32,000
That history of racial exclusion

40
0:02:32.788,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and our cultural devaluing of work that's associated with women

41
0:02:37.799,000 --> 0:02:41,000
now means that millions of women go to work every single day,

42
0:02:42.098,000 --> 0:02:43,000
work incredibly hard

43
0:02:43.805,000 --> 0:02:45,000
and still can't make ends meet.

44
0:02:46.639,000 --> 0:02:5,000
They earn poverty wages without a safety net,

45
0:02:51.543,000 --> 0:02:56,000
so that the women that we're counting on to take care of us and our families

46
0:02:57.41,000 --> 0:02:59,000
can't take care of their own, doing this work.

47
0:03:01.983,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But my work over the last 20 years has been about changing precisely that.

48
0:03:07.257,000 --> 0:03:11,000
It's about making these jobs good jobs that you can take pride in

49
0:03:11.487,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and support your family on.

50
0:03:13.835,000 --> 0:03:16,000
At the National Domestic Workers Alliance, we've been working hard in states

51
0:03:17.495,000 --> 0:03:22,000
to pass new laws that will protect domestic workers from discrimination

52
0:03:22.583,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and sexual harassment,

53
0:03:24.733,000 --> 0:03:28,000
that will create days of rest, paid time off, even.

54
0:03:29.766,000 --> 0:03:33,000
So far, eight states have passed domestic workers bills of rights.

55
0:03:35.412,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Yes.

56
0:03:36.614,000 --> 0:03:39,000
(Applause)

57
0:03:40.341,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And during the Obama administration,

58
0:03:42.159,000 --> 0:03:45,000
we were successful in bringing two million home care workers

59
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:48,000
under minimum wage and overtime protections

60
0:03:48.724,000 --> 0:03:51,000
for the first time since 1937.

61
0:03:52.587,000 --> 0:03:55,000
(Applause)

62
0:03:58.317,000 --> 0:04:03,000
Most recently, we've been really excited to launch a new portable benefits platform

63
0:04:03.847,000 --> 0:04:05,000
for domestic workers, called "Alia,"

64
0:04:06.531,000 --> 0:04:09,000
which allows for domestic workers with multiple clients

65
0:04:10.178,000 --> 0:04:14,000
to give them access to benefits for the very first time.

66
0:04:15.554,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So really important progress is being made.

67
0:04:19.794,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But I would argue tonight

68
0:04:22.257,000 --> 0:04:27,000
that one of the most important things that domestic workers can provide

69
0:04:27.508,000 --> 0:04:29,000
is actually what they can teach us

70
0:04:30.057,000 --> 0:04:32,000
about humanity itself

71
0:04:32.83,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and about what it will take to create a more humane world for our children.

72
0:04:39.774,000 --> 0:04:41,000
In the face of extreme immorality,

73
0:04:42.557,000 --> 0:04:45,000
domestic workers can be our moral compass.

74
0:04:47.309,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And it makes sense,

75
0:04:49.251,000 --> 0:04:51,000
because what they do is so fundamental

76
0:04:52.181,000 --> 0:04:56,000
to the very basics of human need and humanity.

77
0:04:57.184,000 --> 0:05:,000
They are there when we are born into this world;

78
0:05:01.011,000 --> 0:05:04,000
they shape who we become in this world;

79
0:05:05.611,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and they are with us as we prepare to leave this world.

80
0:05:11.215,000 --> 0:05:14,000
And their experiences with families are so varied.

81
0:05:14.744,000 --> 0:05:17,000
They have some relationships with the families that they work for

82
0:05:17.842,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that are incredibly positive and mutually supportive

83
0:05:20.974,000 --> 0:05:21,000
and last for years and years.

84
0:05:22.956,000 --> 0:05:24,000
And then the opposite also happens.

85
0:05:26.209,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And we've seen cases of sexual violence and assault,

86
0:05:30.929,000 --> 0:05:33,000
of extreme forms of abuse and exploitation.

87
0:05:35.753,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We've seen cases of human trafficking.

88
0:05:39.696,000 --> 0:05:42,000
Domestic workers live in poor neighborhoods,

89
0:05:42.958,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and then they go to work in very wealthy ones.

90
0:05:48.112,000 --> 0:05:53,000
They cross cultures and generations and borders and boundaries,

91
0:05:54.126,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and their job, no matter what,

92
0:05:57.275,000 --> 0:05:59,000
is to show up and care --

93
0:06:01.872,000 --> 0:06:06,000
to nurture, to feed, to clothe, to bathe,

94
0:06:08.406,000 --> 0:06:11,000
to listen, to encourage,

95
0:06:12.908,000 --> 0:06:13,000
to ensure safety,

96
0:06:15.415,000 --> 0:06:16,000
to support dignity ...

97
0:06:18.07,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to care no matter what.

98
0:06:22.245,000 --> 0:06:25,000
I want to tell you a story of a woman I met early on in this work.

99
0:06:25.803,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Her name is Lily.

100
0:06:28.309,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Lily and her family lived in Jamaica,

101
0:06:32.035,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and when she was 15 years old, she was approached by an American couple

102
0:06:35.815,000 --> 0:06:37,000
who were looking for a live-in nanny to come live with them

103
0:06:38.673,000 --> 0:06:39,000
in the United States

104
0:06:39.848,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and help them care for their children.

105
0:06:42.295,000 --> 0:06:47,000
They offered Lily's family that if she came to work as their nanny,

106
0:06:47.446,000 --> 0:06:5,000
she would be able to have access to a US education,

107
0:06:51.44,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and she would have a weekly salary sent home to help her family financially.

108
0:06:57.819,000 --> 0:06:58,000
They decided it was a good idea

109
0:06:59.78,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and decided to take the opportunity.

110
0:07:04.184,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Lily held up her end of the bargain

111
0:07:08.125,000 --> 0:07:1,000
and helped to raise three children.

112
0:07:11.957,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But all communication with her family was severed:

113
0:07:15.604,000 --> 0:07:18,000
no letters, no phone calls.

114
0:07:18.665,000 --> 0:07:2,000
She was never allowed to go to school,

115
0:07:22.16,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and she was never paid --

116
0:07:24.229,000 --> 0:07:26,000
for 15 years.

117
0:07:27.804,000 --> 0:07:3,000
One day, she saw an article in a newspaper about another domestic worker

118
0:07:31.512,000 --> 0:07:33,000
with a really similar story to hers,

119
0:07:33.985,000 --> 0:07:35,000
another case that I was working on at the time,

120
0:07:36.755,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and she found a way to reach me.

121
0:07:39.777,000 --> 0:07:41,000
She also found a way to reach her brother,

122
0:07:42.423,000 --> 0:07:44,000
who was living in the United States at the time as well.

123
0:07:45.198,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Between the two of us, we were able to help her escape.

124
0:07:49.525,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And she had the help of one of the children.

125
0:07:53.071,000 --> 0:07:56,000
One of the children was old enough to realize

126
0:07:56.919,000 --> 0:08:,000
that the way his nanny was being treated was wrong,

127
0:08:01.098,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and he gave her the money that he had been saving through his childhood

128
0:08:04.5,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to help her escape.

129
0:08:07.304,000 --> 0:08:09,000
But here's the thing about this story.

130
0:08:12.21,000 --> 0:08:16,000
She was essentially enslaved for 15 years.

131
0:08:18.248,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Human trafficking and slavery is a criminal offense.

132
0:08:22.23,000 --> 0:08:24,000
And so her lawyers and I asked Lily,

133
0:08:25.204,000 --> 0:08:28,000
did she want to press criminal charges for what had happened to her.

134
0:08:29.731,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And after thinking about what it would mean,

135
0:08:32.72,000 --> 0:08:33,000
she said no,

136
0:08:35.222,000 --> 0:08:39,000
because she didn't want the children to be separated from their parents.

137
0:08:42.113,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Instead, we filed a civil lawsuit, and we eventually won the case,

138
0:08:46.586,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and her case became a rallying cry for domestic workers everywhere.

139
0:08:50.311,000 --> 0:08:54,000
She was reunited with her family and went on to have a family of her own.

140
0:08:55.909,000 --> 0:08:58,000
But the thing that's so profound to me about this story

141
0:08:59.279,000 --> 0:09:03,000
is, despite having 15 years stolen from her life,

142
0:09:04.214,000 --> 0:09:09,000
it did not affect the care and compassion that she felt for the children.

143
0:09:11.03,000 --> 0:09:14,000
And I see this from domestic workers all the time.

144
0:09:14.283,000 --> 0:09:15,000
In the face of indignities

145
0:09:16.194,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and our failure to respect and value this work in our culture,

146
0:09:20.009,000 --> 0:09:22,000
they still show up,

147
0:09:22.323,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and they care.

148
0:09:24.78,000 --> 0:09:27,000
They're simply too proximate to our shared humanity.

149
0:09:28.393,000 --> 0:09:31,000
They know how your toddler likes to be held

150
0:09:31.576,000 --> 0:09:33,000
as they take their bottle before a nap.

151
0:09:35.011,000 --> 0:09:37,000
They know how your mother likes her tea,

152
0:09:37.805,000 --> 0:09:41,000
how to make her smile and tell stories despite her dementia.

153
0:09:42.924,000 --> 0:09:45,000
They are so proximate to our humanity.

154
0:09:47.688,000 --> 0:09:49,000
They know that at the end of the day,

155
0:09:49.863,000 --> 0:09:52,000
these are people who are part of families --

156
0:09:52.991,000 --> 0:09:53,000
someone's mother,

157
0:09:54.876,000 --> 0:09:56,000
someone's grandmother,

158
0:09:57.151,000 --> 0:09:59,000
someone's best friend

159
0:09:59.625,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and someone's baby;

160
0:10:03.773,000 --> 0:10:05,000
undeniably human,

161
0:10:06.656,000 --> 0:10:09,000
and therefore, not disposable.

162
0:10:11.715,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Domestic workers know that any time a single person becomes disposable,

163
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
it's a slippery slope.

164
0:10:21.284,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You see, the cultural devaluing of domestic work

165
0:10:25.262,000 --> 0:10:28,000
is a reflection of a hierarchy of human value

166
0:10:29.262,000 --> 0:10:31,000
that defines everything in our world,

167
0:10:32.549,000 --> 0:10:35,000
a hierarchy that values the lives and contributions

168
0:10:36.489,000 --> 0:10:39,000
of some groups of people over others,

169
0:10:40.714,000 --> 0:10:43,000
based on race, gender,

170
0:10:44.316,000 --> 0:10:47,000
class, immigration status --

171
0:10:47.973,000 --> 0:10:49,000
any number of categories.

172
0:10:51.514,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And that hierarchy of human value requires stories about those groups of people

173
0:10:58.222,000 --> 0:11:,000
in order to sustain itself.

174
0:11:00.939,000 --> 0:11:03,000
So these stories have seeped deep into our culture

175
0:11:04.074,000 --> 0:11:08,000
about how some people are less intelligent,

176
0:11:08.479,000 --> 0:11:11,000
some people are less intuitive,

177
0:11:13.081,000 --> 0:11:14,000
weaker,

178
0:11:14.925,000 --> 0:11:17,000
by extension, less trustworthy,

179
0:11:19.371,000 --> 0:11:2,000
less valuable

180
0:11:21.652,000 --> 0:11:22,000
and ultimately,

181
0:11:23.465,000 --> 0:11:24,000
less human.

182
0:11:26.448,000 --> 0:11:3,000
And domestic workers know it's a slippery slope

183
0:11:30.689,000 --> 0:11:36,000
when we start to see a worker as less than a real worker,

184
0:11:38.318,000 --> 0:11:41,000
to a woman as less than a woman,

185
0:11:42.367,000 --> 0:11:45,000
to a mother as less than a mother,

186
0:11:47.365,000 --> 0:11:5,000
to a child as less than a child.

187
0:11:52.519,000 --> 0:11:53,000
In the spring of 2018,

188
0:11:54.143,000 --> 0:11:58,000
the Trump administration announced a new policy at the US-Mexico border,

189
0:11:58.861,000 --> 0:12:,000
a zero-tolerance policy,

190
0:12:01.321,000 --> 0:12:05,000
to forcibly separate all children from their parents,

191
0:12:06.186,000 --> 0:12:09,000
who were arriving at the border seeking asylum;

192
0:12:09.463,000 --> 0:12:13,000
children as young as 18 months, separated from their parents

193
0:12:13.52,000 --> 0:12:18,000
after a long and arduous journey to reach the US-Mexico border

194
0:12:18.632,000 --> 0:12:2,000
in search of safety and a new beginning.

195
0:12:22.542,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Thousands of children separated.

196
0:12:26.765,000 --> 0:12:28,000
And because they were migrants,

197
0:12:29.569,000 --> 0:12:32,000
they were treated as less than children.

198
0:12:35.446,000 --> 0:12:39,000
In response, I helped to organize the Families Belong Together Vigil

199
0:12:39.967,000 --> 0:12:43,000
at the Ursula Border Patrol Processing Center in McAllen, Texas,

200
0:12:44.24,000 --> 0:12:45,000
on Father's Day.

201
0:12:46.065,000 --> 0:12:49,000
Inside that processing center, there were hundreds of children

202
0:12:49.383,000 --> 0:12:51,000
who were being held, processed

203
0:12:52.135,000 --> 0:12:55,000
and then prepared to be shipped all over country

204
0:12:55.359,000 --> 0:13:,000
to be jailed in facilities hundreds of miles away from their parents.

205
0:13:01.522,000 --> 0:13:03,000
I saw with my own eyes

206
0:13:03.707,000 --> 0:13:05,000
children not [old] enough for kindergarten

207
0:13:06.599,000 --> 0:13:07,000
in unmarked buses,

208
0:13:08.108,000 --> 0:13:12,000
being shipped off to jails hundreds of miles away.

209
0:13:13.904,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And as they passed us by,

210
0:13:16.611,000 --> 0:13:18,000
they reached for us through the windows,

211
0:13:21.485,000 --> 0:13:24,000
as we stood vigil to let them know that they are not alone,

212
0:13:25.357,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and we are fighting for them.

213
0:13:27.906,000 --> 0:13:31,000
Domestic workers came from all over Texas to be a part of the vigil.

214
0:13:32.261,000 --> 0:13:36,000
They saw in those families their own family stories.

215
0:13:36.851,000 --> 0:13:41,000
They had also come here in search of safety and a new beginning,

216
0:13:42.67,000 --> 0:13:43,000
a better life for their families,

217
0:13:44.27,000 --> 0:13:47,000
and they saw in the eyes of those children

218
0:13:47.963,000 --> 0:13:48,000
their own children.

219
0:13:51.052,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And through our tears,

220
0:13:53.65,000 --> 0:13:55,000
we looked at each other and we asked each other,

221
0:13:56.551,000 --> 0:13:58,000
"How did we get here,

222
0:13:59.732,000 --> 0:14:01,000
to putting children in cages

223
0:14:02.55,000 --> 0:14:05,000
and separating them from the people who love them the most in the world?"

224
0:14:07.159,000 --> 0:14:08,000
How?

225
0:14:10.171,000 --> 0:14:15,000
And what I thought to myself was: if domestic workers were in charge,

226
0:14:16.128,000 --> 0:14:17,000
this never would have happened.

227
0:14:18.916,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Our humanity would never have been so disposable

228
0:14:23.87,000 --> 0:14:25,000
that we would be treating children in this way.

229
0:14:29.304,000 --> 0:14:34,000
The Dalai Lama once said that love and compassion are necessities,

230
0:14:35.877,000 --> 0:14:36,000
not luxuries.

231
0:14:38.597,000 --> 0:14:41,000
Without them, humanity cannot survive.

232
0:14:44.341,000 --> 0:14:47,000
In other words, they are fundamental to human existence.

233
0:14:49.644,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Domestic workers are in charge of the fundamentals.

234
0:14:55.98,000 --> 0:14:57,000
They love and they care,

235
0:14:58.016,000 --> 0:15:,000
and they show compassion no matter what.

236
0:15:04.016,000 --> 0:15:08,000
We live in a time of moral choices

237
0:15:09.417,000 --> 0:15:1,000
everywhere we turn:

238
0:15:11.101,000 --> 0:15:12,000
at the border,

239
0:15:12.779,000 --> 0:15:14,000
at the ballot box,

240
0:15:15.023,000 --> 0:15:16,000
in our workplaces,

241
0:15:17.93,000 --> 0:15:2,000
right in our homes, full of moral choices.

242
0:15:23.267,000 --> 0:15:29,000
As you go about your day and you encounter these moral choices,

243
0:15:29.297,000 --> 0:15:3,000
think of Lily.

244
0:15:32.323,000 --> 0:15:33,000
Think like Lily.

245
0:15:35.083,000 --> 0:15:41,000
Think like a domestic worker who shows up and cares no matter what.

246
0:15:42.228,000 --> 0:15:44,000
Love and compassion, no matter what.

247
0:15:46.461,000 --> 0:15:48,000
Show up like a domestic worker,

248
0:15:51.164,000 --> 0:15:53,000
because our children are counting on us.

249
0:15:54.537,000 --> 0:15:55,000
Thank you.

250
0:15:55.732,000 --> 0:15:58,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:12.772,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I am a chef

3
0:00:14.336,000 --> 0:00:15,000
and a food policy guy,

4
0:00:16.779,000 --> 0:00:19,000
but I come from a whole family of teachers.

5
0:00:20.096,000 --> 0:00:23,000
My sister is a special ed teacher in Chicago.

6
0:00:23.415,000 --> 0:00:27,000
My father just retired after 25 years teaching fifth grade.

7
0:00:28.177,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My aunt and uncle were professors.

8
0:00:30.346,000 --> 0:00:31,000
My cousins all teach.

9
0:00:32.022,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Everybody in my family, basically, teaches except for me.

10
0:00:36.778,000 --> 0:00:4,000
They taught me that the only way to get the right answers

11
0:00:41.646,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is to ask the right questions.

12
0:00:45.051,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So what are the right questions

13
0:00:46.658,000 --> 0:00:5,000
when it comes to improving the educational outcomes for our children?

14
0:00:52.806,000 --> 0:00:54,000
There's obviously many important questions,

15
0:00:55.652,000 --> 0:00:57,000
but I think the following is a good place to start:

16
0:00:59.046,000 --> 0:01:01,000
What do we think the connection is

17
0:01:01.114,000 --> 0:01:04,000
between a child's growing mind

18
0:01:04.557,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and their growing body?

19
0:01:06.87,000 --> 0:01:08,000
What can we expect our kids to learn

20
0:01:09.632,000 --> 0:01:13,000
if their diets are full of sugar and empty of nutrients?

21
0:01:14.617,000 --> 0:01:16,000
What can they possibly learn

22
0:01:16.822,000 --> 0:01:2,000
if their bodies are literally going hungry?

23
0:01:22.157,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And with all the resources that we are pouring into schools,

24
0:01:25.988,000 --> 0:01:27,000
we should stop and ask ourselves:

25
0:01:28.164,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Are we really setting our kids up for success?

26
0:01:32.119,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Now, a few years ago,

27
0:01:33.848,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I was a judge on a cooking competition called "Chopped."

28
0:01:38.598,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Four chefs compete with mystery ingredients

29
0:01:41.602,000 --> 0:01:43,000
to see who can cook the best dishes.

30
0:01:45.008,000 --> 0:01:48,000
Except for this episode -- it was a very special one.

31
0:01:49.402,000 --> 0:01:52,000
Instead of four overzealous chefs trying to break into the limelight --

32
0:01:52.858,000 --> 0:01:54,000
something that I would know nothing about --

33
0:01:54.949,000 --> 0:01:55,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:56.014,000 --> 0:01:58,000
these chefs were school chefs;

35
0:01:58.697,000 --> 0:02:01,000
you know, the women that you used to call "lunch ladies,"

36
0:02:01.87,000 --> 0:02:03,000
but the ones I insist we call "school chefs."

37
0:02:05.303,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now, these women -- God bless these women --

38
0:02:08.307,000 --> 0:02:11,000
spend their day cooking for thousands of kids,

39
0:02:12.264,000 --> 0:02:15,000
breakfast and lunch, with only $2.68 per lunch,

40
0:02:16.056,000 --> 0:02:19,000
with only about a dollar of that actually going to the food.

41
0:02:20.226,000 --> 0:02:21,000
In this episode,

42
0:02:22.13,000 --> 0:02:24,000
the main-course mystery ingredient was quinoa.

43
0:02:25.4,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Now, I know it's been a long time

44
0:02:27.085,000 --> 0:02:29,000
since most of you have had a school lunch,

45
0:02:29.305,000 --> 0:02:31,000
and we've made a lot of progress on nutrition,

46
0:02:31.941,000 --> 0:02:34,000
but quinoa still is not a staple in most school cafeterias.

47
0:02:35.099,000 --> 0:02:36,000
(Laughter)

48
0:02:36.966,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So this was a challenge.

49
0:02:38.957,000 --> 0:02:41,000
But the dish that I will never forget was cooked by a woman

50
0:02:42.198,000 --> 0:02:43,000
named Cheryl Barbara.

51
0:02:43.879,000 --> 0:02:44,000
Cheryl was the nutrition director

52
0:02:45.637,000 --> 0:02:47,000
at High School in the Community in Connecticut.

53
0:02:48.025,000 --> 0:02:5,000
She cooked this delicious pasta.

54
0:02:50.206,000 --> 0:02:51,000
It was amazing.

55
0:02:51.456,000 --> 0:02:53,000
It was a pappardelle with Italian sausage,

56
0:02:54.123,000 --> 0:02:55,000
kale, Parmesan cheese.

57
0:02:55.919,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It was delicious, like, restaurant-quality good, except --

58
0:02:59.202,000 --> 0:03:02,000
she basically just threw the quinoa, pretty much uncooked,

59
0:03:02.986,000 --> 0:03:03,000
into the dish.

60
0:03:04.553,000 --> 0:03:05,000
It was a strange choice,

61
0:03:06.297,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and it was super crunchy.

62
0:03:08.794,000 --> 0:03:1,000
(Laughter)

63
0:03:11.46,000 --> 0:03:15,000
So I took on the TV accusatory judge thing that you're supposed to do,

64
0:03:16.402,000 --> 0:03:17,000
and I asked her why she did that.

65
0:03:18.794,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Cheryl responded, "Well, first, I don't know what quinoa is."

66
0:03:22.137,000 --> 0:03:23,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:23.221,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"But I do know that it's a Monday,

68
0:03:27.261,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and that in my school, at High School in the Community,

69
0:03:30.642,000 --> 0:03:31,000
I always cook pasta."

70
0:03:33.116,000 --> 0:03:35,000
See, Cheryl explained that for many of her kids,

71
0:03:36.574,000 --> 0:03:38,000
there were no meals on the weekends.

72
0:03:40.728,000 --> 0:03:41,000
No meals on Saturday.

73
0:03:44.343,000 --> 0:03:45,000
No meals on Sunday, either.

74
0:03:47.047,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So she cooked pasta because she wanted to make sure

75
0:03:50.537,000 --> 0:03:54,000
she cooked something she knew her children would eat.

76
0:03:56.76,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Something that would stick to their ribs, she said.

77
0:04:00.882,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Something that would fill them up.

78
0:04:04.972,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Cheryl talked about how, by the time Monday came,

79
0:04:09.967,000 --> 0:04:11,000
her kids' hunger pangs were so intense

80
0:04:12.592,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that they couldn't even begin to think about learning.

81
0:04:16.356,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Food was the only thing on their mind.

82
0:04:22.714,000 --> 0:04:23,000
The only thing.

83
0:04:24.296,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And unfortunately, the stats -- they tell the same story.

84
0:04:28.071,000 --> 0:04:3,000
So, let's put this into the context of a child.

85
0:04:32.633,000 --> 0:04:33,000
And we're going to focus on

86
0:04:33.963,000 --> 0:04:35,000
the most important meal of the day, breakfast.

87
0:04:36.231,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Meet Allison.

88
0:04:37.566,000 --> 0:04:38,000
She's 12 years old,

89
0:04:39.094,000 --> 0:04:4,000
she's smart as a whip

90
0:04:40.774,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and she wants to be a physicist when she grows up.

91
0:04:43.561,000 --> 0:04:47,000
If Allison goes to a school that serves a nutritious breakfast

92
0:04:47.594,000 --> 0:04:48,000
to all of their kids,

93
0:04:48.864,000 --> 0:04:49,000
here's what's going to follow.

94
0:04:50.946,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Her chances of getting a nutritious meal,

95
0:04:54.235,000 --> 0:04:57,000
one with fruit and milk, one lower in sugar and salt,

96
0:04:57.425,000 --> 0:04:58,000
dramatically increase.

97
0:04:59.637,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Allison will have a lower rate of obesity than the average kid.

98
0:05:03.344,000 --> 0:05:04,000
She'll have to visit the nurse less.

99
0:05:05.153,000 --> 0:05:08,000
She'll have lower levels of anxiety and depression.

100
0:05:08.196,000 --> 0:05:09,000
She'll have better behavior.

101
0:05:09.736,000 --> 0:05:12,000
She'll have better attendance, and she'll show up on time more often.

102
0:05:13.015,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Why?

103
0:05:14.411,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Well, because there's a good meal waiting for her at school.

104
0:05:18.007,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Overall, Allison is in much better health

105
0:05:21.461,000 --> 0:05:22,000
than the average school kid.

106
0:05:23.887,000 --> 0:05:24,000
So what about that kid

107
0:05:25.544,000 --> 0:05:27,000
who doesn't have a nutritious breakfast waiting for him?

108
0:05:28.555,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Well, meet Tommy.

109
0:05:30.546,000 --> 0:05:32,000
He's also 12. He's a wonderful kid.

110
0:05:32.998,000 --> 0:05:33,000
He wants to be a doctor.

111
0:05:34.785,000 --> 0:05:35,000
By the time Tommy is in kindergarten,

112
0:05:36.573,000 --> 0:05:38,000
he's already underperforming in math.

113
0:05:40.174,000 --> 0:05:42,000
By the time he's in third grade,

114
0:05:42.378,000 --> 0:05:44,000
he's got lower math and reading scores.

115
0:05:46.158,000 --> 0:05:47,000
By the time he's 11,

116
0:05:47.975,000 --> 0:05:5,000
it's more likely that Tommy will have to have repeated a grade.

117
0:05:53.092,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Research shows that kids who do not have consistent nourishment,

118
0:05:56.213,000 --> 0:05:57,000
particularly at breakfast,

119
0:05:57.492,000 --> 0:06:,000
have poor cognitive function overall.

120
0:06:02.75,000 --> 0:06:04,000
So how widespread is this problem?

121
0:06:05.676,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Well, unfortunately, it's pervasive.

122
0:06:09.228,000 --> 0:06:1,000
Let me give you two stats

123
0:06:10.477,000 --> 0:06:12,000
that seem like they're on opposite ends of the issue,

124
0:06:13.465,000 --> 0:06:15,000
but are actually two sides of the same coin.

125
0:06:16.14,000 --> 0:06:18,000
On the one hand,

126
0:06:18.178,000 --> 0:06:21,000
one in six Americans are food insecure,

127
0:06:21.41,000 --> 0:06:24,000
including 16 million children -- almost 20 percent --

128
0:06:25.394,000 --> 0:06:26,000
are food insecure.

129
0:06:26.808,000 --> 0:06:28,000
In this city alone, in New York City,

130
0:06:30.173,000 --> 0:06:35,000
474,000 kids under the age of 18 face hunger every year.

131
0:06:36.884,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It's crazy.

132
0:06:38.48,000 --> 0:06:39,000
On the other hand,

133
0:06:40.503,000 --> 0:06:44,000
diet and nutrition is the number one cause of preventable death and disease

134
0:06:44.636,000 --> 0:06:45,000
in this country, by far.

135
0:06:47.271,000 --> 0:06:5,000
And fully a third of the kids that we've been talking about tonight

136
0:06:50.516,000 --> 0:06:52,000
are on track to have diabetes in their lifetime.

137
0:06:54.807,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now, what's hard to put together but is true

138
0:06:57.213,000 --> 0:06:59,000
is that, many times, these are the same children.

139
0:07:00.855,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So they fill up on the unhealthy and cheap calories

140
0:07:03.778,000 --> 0:07:07,000
that surround them in their communities and that their families can afford.

141
0:07:08.752,000 --> 0:07:09,000
But then by the end of the month,

142
0:07:11.757,000 --> 0:07:14,000
food stamps run out or hours get cut at work,

143
0:07:15.346,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and they don't have the money to cover the basic cost of food.

144
0:07:20.089,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But we should be able to solve this problem, right?

145
0:07:23.439,000 --> 0:07:24,000
We know what the answers are.

146
0:07:25.917,000 --> 0:07:29,000
As part of my work at the White House, we instituted a program

147
0:07:30.072,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that for all schools that had 40 percent more low-income kids,

148
0:07:33.59,000 --> 0:07:36,000
we could serve breakfast and lunch to every kid in that school.

149
0:07:38.272,000 --> 0:07:39,000
For free.

150
0:07:40.305,000 --> 0:07:42,000
This program has been incredibly successful,

151
0:07:42.38,000 --> 0:07:46,000
because it helped us overcome a very difficult barrier

152
0:07:46.456,000 --> 0:07:49,000
when it came to getting kids a nutritious breakfast.

153
0:07:49.625,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And that was the barrier of stigma.

154
0:07:53.769,000 --> 0:07:57,000
See, schools serve breakfast before school,

155
0:07:59.778,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and it was only available for the poor kids.

156
0:08:05.371,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So everybody knew who was poor and who needed government help.

157
0:08:09.597,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Now, all kids, no matter how much or how little their parents make,

158
0:08:14.421,000 --> 0:08:15,000
have a lot of pride.

159
0:08:17.107,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So what happened?

160
0:08:18.977,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Well, the schools that have implemented this program

161
0:08:21.469,000 --> 0:08:25,000
saw an increase in math and reading scores by 17.5 percent.

162
0:08:26.657,000 --> 0:08:27,000
17.5 percent.

163
0:08:29.49,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And research shows that when kids have a consistent, nutritious breakfast,

164
0:08:35.882,000 --> 0:08:38,000
their chances of graduating increase by 20 percent.

165
0:08:40.313,000 --> 0:08:41,000
20 percent.

166
0:08:43.012,000 --> 0:08:46,000
When we give our kids the nourishment they need,

167
0:08:46.795,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we give them the chance to thrive,

168
0:08:49.955,000 --> 0:08:51,000
both in the classroom and beyond.

169
0:08:52.9,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Now, you don't have to trust me on this,

170
0:08:56.644,000 --> 0:08:57,000
but you should talk to Donna Martin.

171
0:08:59.249,000 --> 0:09:,000
I love Donna Martin.

172
0:09:01.02,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Donna Martin is the school nutrition director at Burke County

173
0:09:04.721,000 --> 0:09:05,000
in Waynesboro, Georgia.

174
0:09:07.053,000 --> 0:09:09,000
Burke County is one of the poorest districts

175
0:09:09.79,000 --> 0:09:11,000
in the fifth-poorest state in the country,

176
0:09:12.517,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and about 100 percent of Donna's students live at or below the poverty line.

177
0:09:19.672,000 --> 0:09:2,000
A few years ago,

178
0:09:20.907,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Donna decided to get out ahead of the new standards that were coming,

179
0:09:24.885,000 --> 0:09:26,000
and overhaul her nutrition standards.

180
0:09:28.2,000 --> 0:09:32,000
She improved and added fruit and vegetables and whole grains.

181
0:09:32.875,000 --> 0:09:34,000
She served breakfast in the classroom to all of her kids.

182
0:09:36.374,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And she implemented a dinner program.

183
0:09:38.222,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Why?

184
0:09:40.336,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Well, many of her kids didn't have dinner when they went home.

185
0:09:43.975,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So how did they respond?

186
0:09:46.208,000 --> 0:09:48,000
Well, the kids loved the food.

187
0:09:49.577,000 --> 0:09:5,000
They loved the better nutrition,

188
0:09:51.289,000 --> 0:09:52,000
and they loved not being hungry.

189
0:09:54.759,000 --> 0:09:57,000
But Donna's biggest supporter came from an unexpected place.

190
0:09:59.055,000 --> 0:10:01,000
His name from Eric Parker,

191
0:10:01.163,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and he was the head football coach for the Burke County Bears.

192
0:10:05.668,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Now, Coach Parker had coached mediocre teams for years.

193
0:10:08.757,000 --> 0:10:1,000
The Bears often ended in the middle of the pack --

194
0:10:11.704,000 --> 0:10:14,000
a big disappointment in one of the most passionate football states

195
0:10:14.89,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in the Union.

196
0:10:16.542,000 --> 0:10:2,000
But the year Donna changed the menus,

197
0:10:21.174,000 --> 0:10:24,000
the Bears not only won their division,

198
0:10:24.705,000 --> 0:10:26,000
they went on to win the state championship,

199
0:10:27.168,000 --> 0:10:29,000
beating the Peach County Trojans

200
0:10:29.558,000 --> 0:10:3,000
28-14.

201
0:10:30.904,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Laughter)

202
0:10:33.283,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And Coach Parker,

203
0:10:35.507,000 --> 0:10:38,000
he credited that championship to Donna Martin.

204
0:10:41.274,000 --> 0:10:43,000
When we give our kids the basic nourishment,

205
0:10:44.059,000 --> 0:10:45,000
they're going to thrive.

206
0:10:46.31,000 --> 0:10:49,000
And it's not just up to the Cheryl Barbaras

207
0:10:49.374,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and the Donna Martins of the world.

208
0:10:52.039,000 --> 0:10:53,000
It's on all of us.

209
0:10:54.218,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And feeding our kids the basic nutrition is just the starting point.

210
0:10:59.517,000 --> 0:11:,000
What I've laid out is really a model

211
0:11:01.506,000 --> 0:11:04,000
for so many of the most pressing issues that we face.

212
0:11:06.183,000 --> 0:11:11,000
If we focus on the simple goal of properly nourishing ourselves,

213
0:11:12.514,000 --> 0:11:15,000
we could see a world that is more stable and secure;

214
0:11:16.929,000 --> 0:11:19,000
we could dramatically improve our economic productivity;

215
0:11:21.023,000 --> 0:11:23,000
we could transform our health care

216
0:11:24.736,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and we could go a long way

217
0:11:26.436,000 --> 0:11:29,000
in ensuring that the Earth can provide for generations to come.

218
0:11:29.506,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Food is that place where our collective efforts

219
0:11:34.198,000 --> 0:11:35,000
can have the greatest impact.

220
0:11:37.825,000 --> 0:11:4,000
So we have to ask ourselves: What is the right question?

221
0:11:40.934,000 --> 0:11:41,000
What would happen

222
0:11:42.486,000 --> 0:11:47,000
if we fed ourselves more nutritious, more sustainably grown food?

223
0:11:48.702,000 --> 0:11:49,000
What would be the impact?

224
0:11:51.184,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Cheryl Barbara,

225
0:11:53.909,000 --> 0:11:54,000
Donna Martin,

226
0:11:55.555,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Coach Parker and the Burke County Bears --

227
0:11:58.539,000 --> 0:11:59,000
I think they know the answer.

228
0:12:00.207,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Thank you guys so very much.

229
0:12:01.842,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Applause)

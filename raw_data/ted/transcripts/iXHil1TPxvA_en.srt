1
0:00:13.354,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Virtual reality started for me in sort of an unusual place.

2
0:00:18.976,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It was the 1970s.

3
0:00:21.173,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I got into the field very young: I was seven years old.

4
0:00:24.383,000 --> 0:00:28,000
And the tool that I used to access virtual reality

5
0:00:29.245,000 --> 0:00:32,000
was the Evel Knievel stunt cycle.

6
0:00:32.81,000 --> 0:00:34,000
This is a commercial for that particular item:

7
0:00:35.201,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Video) Voice-over: What a jump!

8
0:00:36.776,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Evel's riding the amazing stunt cycle.

9
0:00:38.767,000 --> 0:00:4,000
That gyro-power sends him over 100 feet at top speed.

10
0:00:41.536,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Chris Milk: So this was my joy back then.

11
0:00:43.628,000 --> 0:00:45,000
I rode this motorcycle everywhere.

12
0:00:46.587,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I was there with Evel Knievel; we jumped the Snake River Canyon together.

13
0:00:50.847,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I wanted the rocket.

14
0:00:52.216,000 --> 0:00:54,000
I never got the rocket, I only got the motorcycle.

15
0:00:57.626,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I felt so connected to this world.

16
0:01:00.203,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I didn't want to be a storyteller when I grew up, I wanted to be stuntman.

17
0:01:04.44,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I was there. Evel Knievel was my friend.

18
0:01:07.644,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I had so much empathy for him.

19
0:01:10.747,000 --> 0:01:12,000
But it didn't work out. (Laughter)

20
0:01:13.358,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I went to art school.

21
0:01:15.382,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I started making music videos.

22
0:01:17.792,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And this is one of the early music videos that I made:

23
0:01:20.866,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Music: "Touch the Sky" by Kanye West)

24
0:01:26.756,000 --> 0:01:29,000
CM: You may notice some slight similarities here.

25
0:01:30.032,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

26
0:01:31.818,000 --> 0:01:33,000
And I got that rocket.

27
0:01:34.461,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:37.104,000 --> 0:01:41,000
So, now I'm a filmmaker, or, the beginning of a filmmaker,

29
0:01:41.509,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and I started using the tools that are available to me as a filmmaker

30
0:01:45.243,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to try to tell the most compelling stories that I can to an audience.

31
0:01:49.831,000 --> 0:01:52,000
And film is this incredible medium that allows us to feel empathy

32
0:01:52.98,000 --> 0:01:54,000
for people that are very different than us

33
0:01:55.006,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and worlds completely foreign from our own.

34
0:01:57.838,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Unfortunately,

35
0:01:58.668,000 --> 0:02:02,000
Evel Knievel did not feel the same empathy for us that we felt for him,

36
0:02:03.527,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and he sued us for this video --

37
0:02:06.33,000 --> 0:02:07,000
(Laughter) --

38
0:02:08.061,000 --> 0:02:1,000
shortly thereafter.

39
0:02:10.11,000 --> 0:02:14,000
On the upside, the man that I worshipped as a child,

40
0:02:14.95,000 --> 0:02:17,000
the man that I wanted to become as an adult,

41
0:02:18.066,000 --> 0:02:21,000
I was finally able to get his autograph.

42
0:02:22.556,000 --> 0:02:25,000
(Applause)

43
0:02:29.832,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Let's talk about film now.

44
0:02:34.849,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Film, it's an incredible medium,

45
0:02:37.745,000 --> 0:02:4,000
but essentially, it's the same now as it was then.

46
0:02:41.06,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's a group of rectangles that are played in a sequence.

47
0:02:44.529,000 --> 0:02:47,000
And we've done incredible things with those rectangles.

48
0:02:48.362,000 --> 0:02:5,000
But I started thinking about,

49
0:02:51.247,000 --> 0:02:55,000
is there a way that I can use modern and developing technologies

50
0:02:55.616,000 --> 0:02:57,000
to tell stories in different ways

51
0:02:57.741,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and tell different kinds of stories

52
0:02:59.482,000 --> 0:03:03,000
that maybe I couldn't tell using the traditional tools of filmmaking

53
0:03:03.793,000 --> 0:03:05,000
that we've been using for 100 years?

54
0:03:05.964,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So I started experimenting,

55
0:03:08.785,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and what I was trying to do was to build the ultimate empathy machine.

56
0:03:15.054,000 --> 0:03:17,000
And here's one of the early experiments:

57
0:03:17.588,000 --> 0:03:19,000
(Music)

58
0:03:20.412,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So this is called "The Wilderness Downtown."

59
0:03:22.656,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It was a collaboration with Arcade Fire.

60
0:03:24.712,000 --> 0:03:27,000
It asked you to put in the address where you grew up at the beginning of it.

61
0:03:28.362,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It's a website.

62
0:03:29.359,000 --> 0:03:33,000
And out of it starts growing these little boxes with different browser windows.

63
0:03:34.275,000 --> 0:03:36,000
And you see this teenager running down a street,

64
0:03:36.657,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and then you see Google Street View and Google Maps imagery

65
0:03:39.415,000 --> 0:03:41,000
and you realize the street he's running down is yours.

66
0:03:41.939,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And when he stops in front of a house, he stops in front of your house.

67
0:03:47.735,000 --> 0:03:5,000
And this was great, and I saw people having an even deeper emotional reaction

68
0:03:51.417,000 --> 0:03:54,000
to this than the things that I had made in rectangles.

69
0:03:54.631,000 --> 0:03:57,000
And I'm essentially taking a piece of your history

70
0:03:58.562,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and putting it inside the framing of the story.

71
0:04:01.981,000 --> 0:04:02,000
But then I started thinking,

72
0:04:03.578,000 --> 0:04:04,000
okay, well that's a part of you,

73
0:04:05.43,000 --> 0:04:1,000
but how do I put all of you inside of the frame?

74
0:04:10.731,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So to do that, I started making art installations.

75
0:04:13.834,000 --> 0:04:15,000
And this is one called "The Treachery of Sanctuary."

76
0:04:16.374,000 --> 0:04:19,000
It's a triptych. I'm going to show you the third panel.

77
0:04:19.392,000 --> 0:04:22,000
(Music)

78
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So now I've got you inside of the frame,

79
0:04:46.848,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and I saw people having even more visceral emotional reactions

80
0:04:51.403,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to this work than the previous one.

81
0:04:54.08,000 --> 0:04:58,000
But then I started thinking about frames, and what do they represent?

82
0:04:58.23,000 --> 0:05:,000
And a frame is just a window.

83
0:05:00.487,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I mean, all the media that we watch -- television, cinema --

84
0:05:03.566,000 --> 0:05:05,000
they're these windows into these other worlds.

85
0:05:05.819,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And I thought, well, great. I got you in a frame.

86
0:05:08.507,000 --> 0:05:11,000
But I don't want you in the frame, I don't want you in the window,

87
0:05:11.634,000 --> 0:05:13,000
I want you through the window, I want you on the other side,

88
0:05:14.523,000 --> 0:05:17,000
in the world, inhabiting the world.

89
0:05:18.218,000 --> 0:05:2,000
So that leads me back to virtual reality.

90
0:05:21.123,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Let's talk about virtual reality.

91
0:05:24.634,000 --> 0:05:25,000
Unfortunately,

92
0:05:25.934,000 --> 0:05:29,000
talking about virtual reality is like dancing about architecture.

93
0:05:30.423,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And this is actually someone dancing about architecture in virtual reality.

94
0:05:37.34,000 --> 0:05:39,000
(Laughter)

95
0:05:39.823,000 --> 0:05:42,000
So, it's difficult to explain. Why is it difficult to explain?

96
0:05:43.084,000 --> 0:05:46,000
It's difficult because it's a very experiential medium.

97
0:05:46.782,000 --> 0:05:47,000
You feel your way inside of it.

98
0:05:48.698,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's a machine, but inside of it,

99
0:05:50.496,000 --> 0:05:53,000
it feels like real life, it feels like truth.

100
0:05:53.945,000 --> 0:05:55,000
And you feel present in the world that you're inside

101
0:05:56.466,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and you feel present with the people that you're inside of it with.

102
0:05:59.689,000 --> 0:06:03,000
So, I'm going to show you a demo of a virtual reality film:

103
0:06:03.785,000 --> 0:06:05,000
a full-screen version of all the information

104
0:06:06.006,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that we capture when we shoot virtual reality.

105
0:06:08.209,000 --> 0:06:09,000
So we're shooting in every direction.

106
0:06:10.034,000 --> 0:06:12,000
This is a camera system that we built

107
0:06:12.21,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that has 3D cameras that look in every direction

108
0:06:15.235,000 --> 0:06:17,000
and binaural microphones that face in every direction.

109
0:06:17.987,000 --> 0:06:22,000
We take this and we build, basically, a sphere of a world that you inhabit.

110
0:06:23.333,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So what I'm going to show you is not a view into the world,

111
0:06:26.736,000 --> 0:06:29,000
it's basically the whole world stretched into a rectangle.

112
0:06:30.107,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So this film is called "Clouds Over Sidra,"

113
0:06:33.495,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and it was made in conjunction with our virtual reality company called VRSE

114
0:06:37.989,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and the United Nations,

115
0:06:39.755,000 --> 0:06:42,000
and a co-collaborator named Gabo Arora.

116
0:06:42.788,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And we went to a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan in December

117
0:06:46.625,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and shot the story of a 12-year-old girl there named Sidra.

118
0:06:50.982,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And she and her family fled Syria through the desert into Jordan

119
0:06:54.473,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and she's been living in this camp for the last year and a half.

120
0:07:00.207,000 --> 0:07:02,000
(Video) Sidra: My name is Sidra.

121
0:07:02.72,000 --> 0:07:03,000
I am 12 years old.

122
0:07:04.616,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I am in the fifth grade.

123
0:07:06.418,000 --> 0:07:11,000
I am from Syria, in the Daraa Province, Inkhil City.

124
0:07:11.605,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I have lived here in the Zaatari camp in Jordan for the last year and a half.

125
0:07:18.923,000 --> 0:07:2,000
I have a big family:

126
0:07:20.931,000 --> 0:07:22,000
three brothers, one is a baby.

127
0:07:23.697,000 --> 0:07:26,000
He cries a lot.

128
0:07:27.142,000 --> 0:07:32,000
I asked my father if I cried when I was a baby and he says I did not.

129
0:07:32.197,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I think I was a stronger baby than my brother.

130
0:07:35.821,000 --> 0:07:37,000
CM: So, when you're inside of the headset.

131
0:07:38.731,000 --> 0:07:39,000
you're not seeing it like this.

132
0:07:40.351,000 --> 0:07:42,000
You're looking around through this world.

133
0:07:42.423,000 --> 0:07:47,000
You'll notice you see full 360 degrees, in all directions.

134
0:07:47.711,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And when you're sitting there in her room, watching her,

135
0:07:50.702,000 --> 0:07:52,000
you're not watching it through a television screen,

136
0:07:53.115,000 --> 0:07:56,000
you're not watching it through a window, you're sitting there with her.

137
0:07:56.523,000 --> 0:08:,000
When you look down, you're sitting on the same ground that she's sitting on.

138
0:08:00.915,000 --> 0:08:01,000
And because of that,

139
0:08:02.666,000 --> 0:08:06,000
you feel her humanity in a deeper way.

140
0:08:07.054,000 --> 0:08:11,000
You empathize with her in a deeper way.

141
0:08:11.59,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And I think that we can change minds with this machine.

142
0:08:17.917,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And we've already started to try to change a few.

143
0:08:21.69,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So we took this film to the World Economic Forum in Davos in January.

144
0:08:26.536,000 --> 0:08:28,000
And we showed it to a group of people

145
0:08:29.022,000 --> 0:08:33,000
whose decisions affect the lives of millions of people.

146
0:08:33.102,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And these are people who might not otherwise

147
0:08:35.22,000 --> 0:08:41,000
be sitting in a tent in a refugee camp in Jordan.

148
0:08:41.484,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But in January, one afternoon in Switzerland,

149
0:08:47.813,000 --> 0:08:5,000
they suddenly all found themselves there.

150
0:08:52.309,000 --> 0:08:56,000
(Applause)

151
0:08:58.699,000 --> 0:09:,000
And they were affected by it.

152
0:09:01.058,000 --> 0:09:04,000
So we're going to make more of them.

153
0:09:04.374,000 --> 0:09:07,000
We're working with the United Nations right now

154
0:09:07.46,000 --> 0:09:09,000
to shoot a whole series of these films.

155
0:09:09.515,000 --> 0:09:11,000
We just finished shooting a story in Liberia.

156
0:09:12.187,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And now, we're going to shoot a story in India.

157
0:09:15.633,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And we're taking these films,

158
0:09:17.511,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and we're showing them at the United Nations

159
0:09:20.036,000 --> 0:09:22,000
to people that work there and people that are visiting there.

160
0:09:23.023,000 --> 0:09:24,000
And we're showing them to the people

161
0:09:24.81,000 --> 0:09:28,000
that can actually change the lives of the people inside of the films.

162
0:09:29.274,000 --> 0:09:32,000
And that's where I think we just start to scratch the surface

163
0:09:32.955,000 --> 0:09:35,000
of the true power of virtual reality.

164
0:09:36.614,000 --> 0:09:38,000
It's not a video game peripheral.

165
0:09:38.835,000 --> 0:09:42,000
It connects humans to other humans in a profound way

166
0:09:43.408,000 --> 0:09:46,000
that I've never seen before in any other form of media.

167
0:09:46.873,000 --> 0:09:49,000
And it can change people's perception of each other.

168
0:09:50.612,000 --> 0:09:51,000
And that's how I think

169
0:09:52.298,000 --> 0:09:55,000
virtual reality has the potential to actually change the world.

170
0:09:58.604,000 --> 0:10:,000
So, it's a machine,

171
0:10:01.151,000 --> 0:10:05,000
but through this machine we become more compassionate,

172
0:10:06.074,000 --> 0:10:11,000
we become more empathetic, and we become more connected.

173
0:10:11.667,000 --> 0:10:14,000
And ultimately, we become more human.

174
0:10:16.491,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Thank you.

175
0:10:17.651,000 --> 0:10:2,000

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:14,000
I have one more reason for optimism:

2
0:00:15.44,000 --> 0:00:16,000
climate change.

3
0:00:16.92,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Maybe you don't believe it, but here is the fact.

4
0:00:20.4,000 --> 0:00:23,000
On December 12, 2015,

5
0:00:24.6,000 --> 0:00:26,000
in Paris, under the United Nations,

6
0:00:27.24,000 --> 0:00:31,000
195 governments got together

7
0:00:31.72,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and unanimously --

8
0:00:34.6,000 --> 0:00:37,000
if you've worked with governments, you know how difficult that is --

9
0:00:37.84,000 --> 0:00:39,000
unanimously decided

10
0:00:40.08,000 --> 0:00:44,000
to intentionally change the course of the global economy

11
0:00:44.92,000 --> 0:00:46,000
in order to protect the most vulnerable

12
0:00:47.76,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and improve the life of all of us.

13
0:00:50.44,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now, that is a remarkable achievement.

14
0:00:52.88,000 --> 0:00:54,000
(Applause)

15
0:00:55.12,000 --> 0:00:57,000
But it is even more remarkable

16
0:00:57.28,000 --> 0:01:,000
if you consider where we had been just a few years ago.

17
0:01:01.28,000 --> 0:01:03,000
2009, Copenhagen.

18
0:01:03.96,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Who remembers Copenhagen?

19
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Well, after years of working toward a climate agreement,

20
0:01:11.76,000 --> 0:01:14,000
the same governments convened in Copenhagen

21
0:01:16.08,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and failed miserably.

22
0:01:18.64,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Why did it fail miserably?

23
0:01:21.04,000 --> 0:01:22,000
For many different reasons,

24
0:01:22.64,000 --> 0:01:25,000
but primarily because of the deeply entrenched divide

25
0:01:26.2,000 --> 0:01:28,000
between the global North and the global South.

26
0:01:30.72,000 --> 0:01:33,000
So now, six months after this failure,

27
0:01:34.64,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I was called in to assume the responsibility

28
0:01:38,000 --> 0:01:4,000
of the global climate change negotiations.

29
0:01:40.08,000 --> 0:01:44,000
You can imagine, the perfect moment to start this new job.

30
0:01:44.48,000 --> 0:01:47,000
The global mood on climate change was in the trash can.

31
0:01:48.2,000 --> 0:01:5,000
No one believed

32
0:01:50.68,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that a global agreement could ever be possible.

33
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:56,000
In fact, neither did I.

34
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
If you promise not to tell anyone outside of this wonderful TED audience,

35
0:02:02,000 --> 0:02:04,000
I'm going to divulge a secret

36
0:02:04.12,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that has been gratefully buried by history.

37
0:02:09.6,000 --> 0:02:11,000
On my first press conference,

38
0:02:12.32,000 --> 0:02:15,000
a journalist asked, "Um, Ms. Figueres,

39
0:02:15.72,000 --> 0:02:19,000
do you think that a global agreement is ever going to be possible?"

40
0:02:20.12,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And without engaging brain, I heard me utter,

41
0:02:24.48,000 --> 0:02:25,000
"Not in my lifetime."

42
0:02:27.24,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Well, you can imagine the faces of my press team

43
0:02:30.8,000 --> 0:02:33,000
who were horrified at this crazy Costa Rican woman

44
0:02:34.52,000 --> 0:02:35,000
who was their new boss.

45
0:02:36.72,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And I was horrified, too.

46
0:02:39.36,000 --> 0:02:42,000
Now, I wasn't horrified at me, because I'm kind of used to myself.

47
0:02:42.64,000 --> 0:02:44,000
I was actually horrified

48
0:02:44.84,000 --> 0:02:47,000
at the consequences of what I had just said,

49
0:02:48.56,000 --> 0:02:5,000
at the consequences for the world

50
0:02:50.76,000 --> 0:02:54,000
in which all our children are going to have to live.

51
0:02:56.24,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It was frankly a horrible moment for me,

52
0:02:59.08,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and I thought, well, no, hang on,

53
0:03:01.2,000 --> 0:03:02,000
hang on.

54
0:03:02.84,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Impossible is not a fact,

55
0:03:06.68,000 --> 0:03:07,000
it's an attitude.

56
0:03:08.8,000 --> 0:03:1,000
It's only an attitude.

57
0:03:11.2,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And I decided right then and there that I was going to change my attitude

58
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and I was going to help the world change its attitude on climate change.

59
0:03:21.76,000 --> 0:03:23,000
So I don't know --

60
0:03:24.76,000 --> 0:03:25,000
No, just this? Thanks.

61
0:03:26.76,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I don't know --

62
0:03:30.12,000 --> 0:03:31,000
what you would do

63
0:03:31.68,000 --> 0:03:36,000
if you were told your job is to save the planet.

64
0:03:37.96,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Put that on the job description.

65
0:03:41.04,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And you have full responsibility,

66
0:03:43.72,000 --> 0:03:46,000
but you have absolutely no authority,

67
0:03:46.88,000 --> 0:03:49,000
because governments are sovereign in every decision that they take.

68
0:03:52.56,000 --> 0:03:55,000
Well, I would really love to know

69
0:03:56.04,000 --> 0:03:58,000
what you would do on the first Monday morning,

70
0:03:58.32,000 --> 0:04:,000
but here's what I did: I panicked.

71
0:04:00.76,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

72
0:04:02.44,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And then I panicked again,

73
0:04:04.96,000 --> 0:04:08,000
because I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem.

74
0:04:09.8,000 --> 0:04:13,000
And then I realized I have no idea how we're going to solve this problem,

75
0:04:13.88,000 --> 0:04:15,000
but I do know one thing:

76
0:04:16.84,000 --> 0:04:2,000
we have got to change the tone of this conversation.

77
0:04:21.84,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Because there is no way you can deliver victory

78
0:04:24.96,000 --> 0:04:25,000
without optimism.

79
0:04:27.04,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And here,

80
0:04:28.64,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I use optimism as a very simple word,

81
0:04:33.2,000 --> 0:04:35,000
but let's understand it in its broader sense.

82
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Let's understand it as courage,

83
0:04:38.92,000 --> 0:04:41,000
hope, trust, solidarity,

84
0:04:42.92,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the fundamental belief that we humans can come together

85
0:04:47.84,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and can help each other to better the fate of mankind.

86
0:04:51.8,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Well, you can imagine that I thought that without that,

87
0:04:54.44,000 --> 0:04:57,000
there was no way we were going to get out of the paralysis of Copenhagen.

88
0:04:57.92,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And for six years,

89
0:04:59.76,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I have stubbornly, relentlessly injected optimism into the system,

90
0:05:05.64,000 --> 0:05:07,000
no matter what the questions from the press --

91
0:05:08.52,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and I have gotten better at those --

92
0:05:10.72,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and no matter what the evidence to the contrary.

93
0:05:13.92,000 --> 0:05:18,000
And believe you me, there has been a lot of contrary evidence.

94
0:05:21.36,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But relentless optimism into the system.

95
0:05:26.88,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And pretty soon,

96
0:05:28.88,000 --> 0:05:33,000
we began to see changes happening in many areas,

97
0:05:34.24,000 --> 0:05:37,000
precipitated by thousands of people,

98
0:05:37.52,000 --> 0:05:39,000
including many of you here today,

99
0:05:40.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and I thank you.

100
0:05:42.04,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And this TED community will not be surprised

101
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:49,000
if I tell you the first area

102
0:05:49.8,000 --> 0:05:52,000
in which we saw remarkable change

103
0:05:52.96,000 --> 0:05:53,000
was ...

104
0:05:55.32,000 --> 0:05:56,000
technology.

105
0:05:57.6,000 --> 0:05:59,000
We began to see that clean technologies,

106
0:06:00.24,000 --> 0:06:02,000
in particular renewable energy technologies,

107
0:06:02.72,000 --> 0:06:04,000
began to drop price and increase in capacity,

108
0:06:05.36,000 --> 0:06:08,000
to the point where today we are already building

109
0:06:08.44,000 --> 0:06:09,000
concentrated solar power plants

110
0:06:10.2,000 --> 0:06:14,000
that have the capacity to power entire cities,

111
0:06:14.68,000 --> 0:06:18,000
to say nothing of the fact of what we are doing on mobility

112
0:06:18.84,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and intelligent buildings.

113
0:06:21.4,000 --> 0:06:23,000
And with this shift in technologies,

114
0:06:24.24,000 --> 0:06:27,000
we were able to begin to understand

115
0:06:27.44,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that there was a shift in the economic equation,

116
0:06:31.72,000 --> 0:06:33,000
because we were able to recognize

117
0:06:33.84,000 --> 0:06:36,000
that yes, there are huge costs to climate change,

118
0:06:36.96,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and yes, there are compounded risks.

119
0:06:39.52,000 --> 0:06:41,000
But there also are economic advantages

120
0:06:42.2,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and intrinsic benefits,

121
0:06:43.92,000 --> 0:06:45,000
because the dissemination of the clean technologies

122
0:06:46.88,000 --> 0:06:48,000
is going to bring us cleaner air,

123
0:06:50.64,000 --> 0:06:51,000
better health,

124
0:06:52.04,000 --> 0:06:54,000
better transportation, more livable cities,

125
0:06:54.6,000 --> 0:06:55,000
more energy security,

126
0:06:56.16,000 --> 0:06:59,000
more energy access to the developing world.

127
0:06:59.64,000 --> 0:07:02,000
In sum, a better world than what we have now.

128
0:07:03.84,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And with that understanding,

129
0:07:06.84,000 --> 0:07:09,000
you should have witnessed, in fact, part of you were,

130
0:07:10.36,000 --> 0:07:14,000
the spread of ingenuity and excitement

131
0:07:14.72,000 --> 0:07:18,000
that went through, first through nonnational governments,

132
0:07:18.76,000 --> 0:07:22,000
the private sector, captains of industry, insurance companies,

133
0:07:22.92,000 --> 0:07:26,000
investors, city leaders, faith communities,

134
0:07:27.24,000 --> 0:07:32,000
because they all began to understand, this actually can be in their interest.

135
0:07:32.6,000 --> 0:07:35,000
This can actually improve their bottom line.

136
0:07:37.84,000 --> 0:07:42,000
And it wasn't just the usual suspects.

137
0:07:44.76,000 --> 0:07:49,000
I have to tell you I had the CEO of a major, major oil and gas company

138
0:07:50.08,000 --> 0:07:52,000
come to me at the beginning of last year

139
0:07:52.44,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and say --

140
0:07:54.52,000 --> 0:07:55,000
privately, of course --

141
0:07:57.28,000 --> 0:08:,000
he did not know how he was going to change his company,

142
0:08:01.16,000 --> 0:08:03,000
but he is going to change it,

143
0:08:03.36,000 --> 0:08:05,000
because he's interested in long-term viability.

144
0:08:06.84,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Well, now we have a shift in the economic equation,

145
0:08:12.04,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and with that, with broader support from everyone,

146
0:08:16.4,000 --> 0:08:22,000
it did not take very long before we saw that national governments

147
0:08:22.8,000 --> 0:08:26,000
woke up to the fact that this is in their national interest.

148
0:08:27.68,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And when we asked countries to begin to identify

149
0:08:31.84,000 --> 0:08:34,000
how they could contribute to global efforts

150
0:08:35.76,000 --> 0:08:37,000
but based on their national interest,

151
0:08:38.12,000 --> 0:08:42,000
189 countries out of 195,

152
0:08:42.4,000 --> 0:08:47,000
189 countries sent their comprehensive climate change plans,

153
0:08:47.76,000 --> 0:08:49,000
based on their national interest,

154
0:08:49.919,000 --> 0:08:5,000
concurrent with their priorities,

155
0:08:51.84,000 --> 0:08:54,000
consistent with their national sustainable development plans.

156
0:08:56.68,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Well,

157
0:08:58.8,000 --> 0:09:03,000
once you protect the core interests of nations,

158
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:07,000
then you can understand that nations were ready

159
0:09:07.68,000 --> 0:09:1,000
to begin to converge onto a common path,

160
0:09:11.32,000 --> 0:09:14,000
onto a common direction of travel

161
0:09:14.6,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that is going to take us probably several decades,

162
0:09:17.76,000 --> 0:09:19,000
but over those several decades is going to take us

163
0:09:20.28,000 --> 0:09:21,000
into the new economy,

164
0:09:21.76,000 --> 0:09:24,000
into a decarbonized, highly resilient economy,

165
0:09:25.36,000 --> 0:09:28,000
And the national contributions that are currently on the table

166
0:09:28.76,000 --> 0:09:3,000
on behalf of national governments

167
0:09:31.08,000 --> 0:09:35,000
are insufficient to get us to a stabilized climate,

168
0:09:35.24,000 --> 0:09:37,000
but they are only the first step,

169
0:09:37.32,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and they will improve over time.

170
0:09:39.36,000 --> 0:09:43,000
And the measurement, reporting and verification of all of those efforts

171
0:09:43.8,000 --> 0:09:44,000
is legally binding.

172
0:09:45.48,000 --> 0:09:48,000
And the checkpoints that we're going to have every five years

173
0:09:49.24,000 --> 0:09:53,000
to assess collective progress towards our goal are legally binding,

174
0:09:53.76,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and the path itself toward a decarbonized and more resilient economy

175
0:09:58.68,000 --> 0:09:59,000
is legally binding.

176
0:10:00.48,000 --> 0:10:02,000
And here's the more important part:

177
0:10:02.52,000 --> 0:10:03,000
What did we have before?

178
0:10:03.96,000 --> 0:10:06,000
A very small handful of countries

179
0:10:07.04,000 --> 0:10:1,000
who had undertaken very reduced,

180
0:10:11.32,000 --> 0:10:14,000
short-term emission reduction commitments

181
0:10:14.4,000 --> 0:10:17,000
that were completely insufficient

182
0:10:17.6,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and furthermore, largely perceived as a burden.

183
0:10:21.04,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Now what do we have?

184
0:10:22.48,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Now we have all countries of the world contributing with different intensities

185
0:10:28.08,000 --> 0:10:3,000
from different approaches in different sectors,

186
0:10:30.4,000 --> 0:10:33,000
but all of them contributing to a common goal

187
0:10:35.04,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and along a path

188
0:10:37.52,000 --> 0:10:39,000
with environmental integrity.

189
0:10:40.4,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Well, once you have all of this in place

190
0:10:44.48,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and you have shifted this understanding,

191
0:10:46.72,000 --> 0:10:5,000
then you see that governments were able to go to Paris

192
0:10:51.12,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and adopt the Paris agreement.

193
0:10:53.68,000 --> 0:10:55,000
(Applause)

194
0:11:01.36,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So,

195
0:11:03.28,000 --> 0:11:04,000
as I look back

196
0:11:08.44,000 --> 0:11:1,000
over the past six years,

197
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:15,000
first I remember

198
0:11:16.48,000 --> 0:11:19,000
the day the Paris agreement was adopted.

199
0:11:20.8,000 --> 0:11:22,000
I cannot tell you the euphoria in the room.

200
0:11:23.4,000 --> 0:11:26,000
5,000 people jumping out of their seats,

201
0:11:26.8,000 --> 0:11:29,000
crying, clapping, screaming, yelling,

202
0:11:30.48,000 --> 0:11:35,000
torn between euphoria and still disbelief at what they had just seen,

203
0:11:35.8,000 --> 0:11:36,000
because so many people

204
0:11:38.44,000 --> 0:11:42,000
had worked for years towards this, and this was finally their reality.

205
0:11:44.48,000 --> 0:11:48,000
And it wasn't just those who had participated directly.

206
0:11:49.6,000 --> 0:11:51,000
A few weeks ago, I was with a colleague

207
0:11:52.4,000 --> 0:11:53,000
who was trying to decide

208
0:11:54.24,000 --> 0:11:59,000
on a Tahitian pearl that he wanted to give to his wonderful wife Natasha.

209
0:12:01.16,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And once he had finally decided what he was going to buy,

210
0:12:06.76,000 --> 0:12:07,000
the jeweler said to him,

211
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:1,000
"You know, you're very lucky that you're buying this now,

212
0:12:10.84,000 --> 0:12:14,000
because these pearls could go extinct very soon because of climate change."

213
0:12:16.24,000 --> 0:12:19,000
"But," the jeweler said, "have you heard,

214
0:12:19.8,000 --> 0:12:21,000
the governments have just come to a decision,

215
0:12:22.6,000 --> 0:12:25,000
and Tahiti could have a chance."

216
0:12:26.8,000 --> 0:12:29,000
Well, what a fantastic confirmation

217
0:12:30.04,000 --> 0:12:34,000
that perhaps, perhaps here is hope,

218
0:12:34.08,000 --> 0:12:36,000
here is a possible chance.

219
0:12:37.64,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I'm the first one to recognize that we have a lot of work still to do.

220
0:12:42.32,000 --> 0:12:45,000
We've only just started our work on climate change.

221
0:12:45.68,000 --> 0:12:48,000
And in fact, we need to make sure that we redouble our efforts

222
0:12:49.4,000 --> 0:12:52,000
over the next five years that are the urgent five years.

223
0:12:54.64,000 --> 0:12:56,000
But I do believe

224
0:12:57.52,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that we have come over the past six years

225
0:13:00.48,000 --> 0:13:01,000
from the impossible

226
0:13:02.44,000 --> 0:13:04,000
to the now unstoppable.

227
0:13:04.56,000 --> 0:13:09,000
And how did we do that? By injecting transformational optimism

228
0:13:09.64,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that allowed us to go from confrontation to collaboration,

229
0:13:13.12,000 --> 0:13:16,000
that allowed us to understand that national and local interests

230
0:13:16.44,000 --> 0:13:19,000
are not necessarily at odds with global needs,

231
0:13:19.84,000 --> 0:13:21,000
and that if we understand that, we can bring them together

232
0:13:22.579,000 --> 0:13:24,000
and we can merge them harmoniously.

233
0:13:24.84,000 --> 0:13:27,000
And as I look forward to other global issues

234
0:13:28.6,000 --> 0:13:31,000
that will require our attention this century --

235
0:13:32.48,000 --> 0:13:36,000
food security, water security, home security, forced migration --

236
0:13:39.08,000 --> 0:13:41,000
I see that we certainly do not know

237
0:13:41.52,000 --> 0:13:44,000
how we are going to solve those problems yet.

238
0:13:45.08,000 --> 0:13:49,000
But we can take a page out of what we have done on climate change

239
0:13:49.8,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and we can understand

240
0:13:51.08,000 --> 0:13:57,000
that we have got to reinterpret the zero-sum mentality.

241
0:13:57.4,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Because we were trained to believe that there always are winners and losers,

242
0:14:02.4,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and that your loss is my gain.

243
0:14:04.64,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Well, now that we're in a world

244
0:14:06.76,000 --> 0:14:08,000
in which we have reached planetary boundaries

245
0:14:09.72,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and that we are not just so interconnected,

246
0:14:12.4,000 --> 0:14:15,000
but increasingly interdependent on each other,

247
0:14:15.84,000 --> 0:14:17,000
your loss is no longer my gain.

248
0:14:18.76,000 --> 0:14:2,000
We're either all losers

249
0:14:22.16,000 --> 0:14:24,000
or we all can be winners.

250
0:14:24.92,000 --> 0:14:26,000
But we are going to have to decide

251
0:14:27.24,000 --> 0:14:3,000
between zero and sum.

252
0:14:31.04,000 --> 0:14:35,000
We're going to have to decide between zero benefit for all

253
0:14:35.92,000 --> 0:14:38,000
or living life as the sum of all of us.

254
0:14:39.92,000 --> 0:14:41,000
We've done it once. We can do it again.

255
0:14:42.28,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Thanks.

256
0:14:43.52,000 --> 0:14:48,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:13,000
"Robam kbach boran,"

2
0:00:14.38,000 --> 0:00:15,000
or the art of Khmer classical dance,

3
0:00:16.18,000 --> 0:00:17,000
is more than 1,000 years old.

4
0:00:18.82,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It was developed as a prayer in movement

5
0:00:21.42,000 --> 0:00:23,000
for rain and fertility,

6
0:00:23.62,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and a prosperity that this meant for an agricultural society.

7
0:00:28.82,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Dancers who were both men and women

8
0:00:31.58,000 --> 0:00:32,000
were offered to temples

9
0:00:32.86,000 --> 0:00:35,000
where they served as living bridges between heaven and earth.

10
0:00:36.62,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Their dancing bodies carried the prayers of the people up to the gods,

11
0:00:41.58,000 --> 0:00:44,000
and the will of the deities was delivered back through them

12
0:00:44.98,000 --> 0:00:45,000
to the people and the land.

13
0:00:49.54,000 --> 0:00:51,000
There are a lot of curves in Khmer dance.

14
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Our backs are arched,

15
0:00:55.58,000 --> 0:00:56,000
our knees are bent,

16
0:00:57.5,000 --> 0:00:59,000
our toes are curled,

17
0:00:59.54,000 --> 0:01:01,000
our elbows are hyperflexed

18
0:01:01.9,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and our fingers are curved backwards.

19
0:01:05.42,000 --> 0:01:08,000
All of these curves create a serpentine impression,

20
0:01:09.1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and this is important because before the introduction of major religions,

21
0:01:13.9,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Khmers, and people all over the world practiced animism.

22
0:01:20.94,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Serpents were especially important in this belief system

23
0:01:23.86,000 --> 0:01:27,000
because in their fluid, curvilinear movement,

24
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
they mimicked the flow of water.

25
0:01:31.34,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So to invoke the serpent in your dancing body then

26
0:01:34.9,000 --> 0:01:37,000
was to conjure the image of rivers cutting across the earth:

27
0:01:39.5,000 --> 0:01:41,000
inspire the flow of life-giving waters.

28
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
As you can see then,

29
0:01:46.58,000 --> 0:01:49,000
Khmer classical dance is a transformation of nature,

30
0:01:50.02,000 --> 0:01:54,000
of both the physical world around us and of our own internal universe.

31
0:01:55.1,000 --> 0:01:57,000
We have four primary hand gestures that we use.

32
0:01:58.1,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Can we do them together?

33
0:02:00.46,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Yeah? OK.

34
0:02:03.9,000 --> 0:02:04,000
This is a tree.

35
0:02:07.5,000 --> 0:02:08,000
That tree will grow,

36
0:02:10.3,000 --> 0:02:13,000
and then it will have leaves.

37
0:02:14.42,000 --> 0:02:15,000
After it has leaves,

38
0:02:15.98,000 --> 0:02:17,000
it'll have flowers,

39
0:02:19.78,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and after it has flowers,

40
0:02:22.1,000 --> 0:02:23,000
it'll have fruit.

41
0:02:24.7,000 --> 0:02:26,000
That fruit will drop

42
0:02:27.06,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and a new tree will grow.

43
0:02:29.1,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And in those four gestures

44
0:02:31.18,000 --> 0:02:32,000
is the cycle of life.

45
0:02:40.74,000 --> 0:02:42,000
These four gestures are then used

46
0:02:43.38,000 --> 0:02:47,000
to create a whole entire language with which dancers express themselves.

47
0:02:48.06,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So for example,

48
0:02:49.38,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I can say,

49
0:02:50.74,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"I."

50
0:02:52.82,000 --> 0:02:53,000
"I."

51
0:02:54.5,000 --> 0:02:55,000
In dance that would be ...

52
0:02:58.54,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"I."

53
0:03:00.14,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Or I can say ...

54
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
"Hey you, come here, come here."

55
0:03:06.22,000 --> 0:03:07,000
In dance ...

56
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"Come here,"

57
0:03:12.54,000 --> 0:03:13,000
or, "Go, go."

58
0:03:14.46,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

59
0:03:18.7,000 --> 0:03:19,000
"Go."

60
0:03:20.14,000 --> 0:03:21,000
And everything from ...

61
0:03:24.1,000 --> 0:03:25,000
love ...

62
0:03:31.1,000 --> 0:03:32,000
to sadness,

63
0:03:33.3,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to --

64
0:03:34.54,000 --> 0:03:35,000
(Stomping)

65
0:03:35.58,000 --> 0:03:36,000
anger

66
0:03:36.94,000 --> 0:03:38,000
can be expressed through the dance as well.

67
0:03:41.98,000 --> 0:03:42,000
There's a certain magic

68
0:03:43.66,000 --> 0:03:47,000
in the way that things are filtered, transformed and put together

69
0:03:47.82,000 --> 0:03:49,000
to create limitless possibilities in art.

70
0:03:51.42,000 --> 0:03:52,000
The Khmer word for art,

71
0:03:53.18,000 --> 0:03:54,000
silapak,

72
0:03:54.42,000 --> 0:03:56,000
in fact, at its root, means "magic."

73
0:03:58.14,000 --> 0:03:59,000
The artist --

74
0:03:59.38,000 --> 0:04:,000
the silapakar,

75
0:04:00.9,000 --> 0:04:01,000
or the silapakarani, then,

76
0:04:02.34,000 --> 0:04:04,000
is nothing short of a magician.

77
0:04:06.18,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I am very proud to say

78
0:04:08.14,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that I belong to a long line of magicians,

79
0:04:11.18,000 --> 0:04:13,000
from my teacher, Sophiline Cheam Shapiro,

80
0:04:14.3,000 --> 0:04:17,000
to her teachers who were stars in the royal palace,

81
0:04:18.18,000 --> 0:04:2,000
to the ancient dancers of Angkor

82
0:04:20.98,000 --> 0:04:21,000
and to the primal villagers

83
0:04:22.54,000 --> 0:04:24,000
from which the art form originally took life.

84
0:04:27.3,000 --> 0:04:28,000
That said,

85
0:04:28.54,000 --> 0:04:31,000
our cherished heritage was once almost completely destroyed.

86
0:04:36.58,000 --> 0:04:37,000
If you are wearing glasses,

87
0:04:38.38,000 --> 0:04:39,000
please stand up.

88
0:04:44.58,000 --> 0:04:46,000
If you speak more than one language,

89
0:04:46.98,000 --> 0:04:47,000
please stand up.

90
0:04:53.14,000 --> 0:04:54,000
If you have light skin,

91
0:04:54.74,000 --> 0:04:55,000
please stand up.

92
0:05:03.62,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Your glasses meant that you could afford health care.

93
0:05:08.78,000 --> 0:05:12,000
That second or third language you spoke indicated your elite education.

94
0:05:15.14,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Your light skin meant you didn't have to work beneath the sun.

95
0:05:19.86,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Under the Khmer Rouge,

96
0:05:21.42,000 --> 0:05:25,000
who took over Cambodia from 1975 to 1979,

97
0:05:25.78,000 --> 0:05:27,000
we would all be dead now,

98
0:05:27.98,000 --> 0:05:29,000
targeted because of our assumed privilege.

99
0:05:36.98,000 --> 0:05:37,000
You see,

100
0:05:38.22,000 --> 0:05:4,000
the Khmer Rouge looked to Cambodia,

101
0:05:40.38,000 --> 0:05:43,000
and they saw centuries of rigid inequality.

102
0:05:44.02,000 --> 0:05:46,000
The king and the few elites around him

103
0:05:46.22,000 --> 0:05:48,000
had all the pleasures and comforts of the world

104
0:05:49.1,000 --> 0:05:52,000
while the mass majority suffered from backbreaking labor

105
0:05:52.34,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and harsh poverty.

106
0:05:54.54,000 --> 0:05:56,000
You don't need a history book to see that this is true.

107
0:05:57.94,000 --> 0:05:59,000
The Khmer word for "I,"

108
0:06:00.18,000 --> 0:06:01,000
for "me,"

109
0:06:02.3,000 --> 0:06:03,000
is khnhom.

110
0:06:05.06,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This very same word can also mean "slave"

111
0:06:08.78,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and dancers were in fact known as knhom preah robam,

112
0:06:12.54,000 --> 0:06:14,000
or "slaves of the sacred dance."

113
0:06:17.02,000 --> 0:06:2,000
The Khmer Rouge sought to end slavery in Cambodia,

114
0:06:20.1,000 --> 0:06:23,000
yet somehow they turned everyone into slaves to do it.

115
0:06:24.22,000 --> 0:06:27,000
They became the oppression that they sought to end.

116
0:06:28.18,000 --> 0:06:29,000
They evacuated the capital

117
0:06:29.9,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and forced people into labor camps.

118
0:06:32.42,000 --> 0:06:33,000
They tore families apart

119
0:06:34.34,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and brainwashed children against their own parents.

120
0:06:37.9,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Everywhere, people were dying and being killed,

121
0:06:41.18,000 --> 0:06:43,000
losing their lives from disease,

122
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
overwork,

123
0:06:44.5,000 --> 0:06:46,000
execution and starvation.

124
0:06:48.46,000 --> 0:06:52,000
The result of this is that an entire third of Cambodia's population was lost

125
0:06:53.18,000 --> 0:06:54,000
in less than four years,

126
0:06:55.02,000 --> 0:06:58,000
and in that number were 90 percent of Khmer dance artists.

127
0:07:00.1,000 --> 0:07:01,000
In other words,

128
0:07:01.34,000 --> 0:07:05,000
nine out of 10 visions for the tradition and future were lost.

129
0:07:07.58,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Thankfully, however,

130
0:07:09.3,000 --> 0:07:11,000
it was my teacher's teachers,

131
0:07:11.38,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Chea Samy, Soth Sam On and Chheng Phon,

132
0:07:15.14,000 --> 0:07:17,000
who would lead the revival of the art form

133
0:07:17.22,000 --> 0:07:19,000
from the ashes of war and genocide:

134
0:07:20.58,000 --> 0:07:21,000
one student,

135
0:07:22.14,000 --> 0:07:23,000
one gesture,

136
0:07:23.74,000 --> 0:07:24,000
one dance at a time.

137
0:07:25.74,000 --> 0:07:26,000
They wrote the love,

138
0:07:27.66,000 --> 0:07:28,000
magic,

139
0:07:29.14,000 --> 0:07:3,000
beauty,

140
0:07:30.38,000 --> 0:07:32,000
history and philosophy of our lineage

141
0:07:32.74,000 --> 0:07:34,000
into the bodies of the next generation.

142
0:07:37.46,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Nearly 40 years later,

143
0:07:39.38,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Khmer classical dance has been revived to new heights.

144
0:07:43.9,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Yet somehow it still exists in a vulnerable environment.

145
0:07:48.46,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The disastrous effects of war still haunt Khmer people today.

146
0:07:52.66,000 --> 0:07:54,000
It is written in our bodies,

147
0:07:54.78,000 --> 0:07:57,000
manifested in a genetic passage of PTSD

148
0:07:58.34,000 --> 0:08:,000
and in families facing cyclical poverty

149
0:08:01.14,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and immense cultural rifts and language barriers.

150
0:08:06.58,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Yet beauty is a most resilient thing.

151
0:08:10.9,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Beauty has this ability to grow anywhere and everywhere

152
0:08:14.78,000 --> 0:08:15,000
at any time.

153
0:08:17.38,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Beauty is what connects people through time and place.

154
0:08:22.46,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Beauty is a liberation from suffering.

155
0:08:28.22,000 --> 0:08:31,000
As Khmer artists work to revive our culture and country,

156
0:08:31.82,000 --> 0:08:35,000
we find that there are many paths in which to move forward into the future.

157
0:08:37.82,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And in a tradition where we often don't know the dancer's names,

158
0:08:42.18,000 --> 0:08:43,000
who they were,

159
0:08:43.42,000 --> 0:08:44,000
what their lives were like,

160
0:08:44.94,000 --> 0:08:45,000
what they felt,

161
0:08:46.82,000 --> 0:08:51,000
let me propose that we move forward honestly and openly from "khnhom."

162
0:08:53.34,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Khnhom not as in slave,

163
0:08:55.42,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but as in conscious service.

164
0:08:58.54,000 --> 0:08:59,000
Khnhom:

165
0:09:00.06,000 --> 0:09:01,000
"I,"

166
0:09:01.7,000 --> 0:09:02,000
"me,"

167
0:09:03.22,000 --> 0:09:04,000
"flowering."

168
0:09:06.34,000 --> 0:09:08,000
My name is Prumsodun Ok.

169
0:09:08.62,000 --> 0:09:09,000
I am Khmer,

170
0:09:09.86,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and I am American.

171
0:09:11.86,000 --> 0:09:13,000
I am the child of refugees,

172
0:09:14.22,000 --> 0:09:15,000
a creator, a healer,

173
0:09:16.18,000 --> 0:09:17,000
and a builder of bridges.

174
0:09:18.7,000 --> 0:09:2,000
I am my teacher's first male student

175
0:09:21.1,000 --> 0:09:24,000
in a tradition understood by many as female,

176
0:09:24.42,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and I founded Cambodia's first gay dance company.

177
0:09:28.62,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I am the incarnation of the beauty, dreams and power

178
0:09:32.82,000 --> 0:09:33,000
of those who came before me.

179
0:09:34.78,000 --> 0:09:37,000
The convergence of past, present and future,

180
0:09:38.3,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and of individual and collective.

181
0:09:42.9,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Let me then play that ancient and ageless role

182
0:09:46.14,000 --> 0:09:48,000
of the artist as messenger,

183
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
by sharing the words of Chheng Phon

184
0:09:52.06,000 --> 0:09:55,000
"A garden with only one type of flower,

185
0:09:55.66,000 --> 0:09:57,000
or flowers of only one color,

186
0:09:57.7,000 --> 0:09:58,000
is no good."

187
0:10:00.46,000 --> 0:10:02,000
This is a reminder that our strength,

188
0:10:04.02,000 --> 0:10:05,000
growth,

189
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
survival

190
0:10:06.5,000 --> 0:10:07,000
and very existence,

191
0:10:07.74,000 --> 0:10:08,000
lies in diversity.

192
0:10:10.5,000 --> 0:10:11,000
It is, however,

193
0:10:11.78,000 --> 0:10:12,000
a message of courage as well.

194
0:10:15.02,000 --> 0:10:18,000
For a flower does not ask for anyone's permission to bloom.

195
0:10:19.82,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It was born to offer itself to the world.

196
0:10:23.3,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Fearless love is its nature.

197
0:10:26.7,000 --> 0:10:27,000
Thank you.

198
0:10:27.94,000 --> 0:10:32,000
(Applause)

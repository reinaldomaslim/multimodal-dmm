1
0:00:16.273,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I want to talk about my investigations

2
0:00:18.835,000 --> 0:00:22,000
into what technology means in our lives --

3
0:00:23.403,000 --> 0:00:26,000
not just our immediate life, but in the cosmic sense,

4
0:00:26.635,000 --> 0:00:29,000
in the kind of long history of the world

5
0:00:29.801,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and our place in the world.

6
0:00:32.404,000 --> 0:00:33,000
What is this stuff?

7
0:00:34.302,000 --> 0:00:35,000
What is the significance?

8
0:00:35.786,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And so, I want to kind of go through my little story

9
0:00:39.718,000 --> 0:00:4,000
of what I found out.

10
0:00:40.988,000 --> 0:00:42,000
One of the first things I started to investigate

11
0:00:43.299,000 --> 0:00:45,000
was the history of the name of technology.

12
0:00:46.134,000 --> 0:00:48,000
In the United States, there is a State of the Union address

13
0:00:49.112,000 --> 0:00:51,000
given by every president since 1790.

14
0:00:52.031,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And each one of those is kind of summing up the most important things

15
0:00:57.093,000 --> 0:00:58,000
for the United States at that time.

16
0:00:58.823,000 --> 0:01:03,000
If you search for the word "technology," it was not used until 1952.

17
0:01:04.133,000 --> 0:01:08,000
So, technology was sort of absent from everybody's thinking until 1952,

18
0:01:08.255,000 --> 0:01:1,000
which happened to be the year of my birth.

19
0:01:10.33,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And obviously, technology had existed before then,

20
0:01:13.347,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but we weren't aware of it.

21
0:01:14.776,000 --> 0:01:18,000
And so it was sort of an awakening of this force in our life.

22
0:01:19.398,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I actually did research to find out the first use of the word "technology."

23
0:01:23.635,000 --> 0:01:24,000
It was in 1829,

24
0:01:25.635,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and it was invented by a guy who was starting a curriculum --

25
0:01:28.635,000 --> 0:01:32,000
a course, bringing together all the kinds of arts and crafts, and industry --

26
0:01:33.285,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and he called it "Technology."

27
0:01:35.27,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And that's the very first use of the word.

28
0:01:37.777,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So what is this stuff

29
0:01:39.967,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that we're all consumed by and bothered by?

30
0:01:45.278,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Alan Kay calls it, "Technology is anything that was invented

31
0:01:48.224,000 --> 0:01:49,000
after you were born."

32
0:01:49.477,000 --> 0:01:5,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:50.509,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Which is sort of the idea we normally have about what technology is:

34
0:01:54.968,000 --> 0:01:55,000
it's all that new stuff.

35
0:01:56.635,000 --> 0:01:58,000
It's not roads, or penicillin,

36
0:01:58.862,000 --> 0:02:01,000
or factory tires; it's the new stuff.

37
0:02:02.649,000 --> 0:02:04,000
My friend Danny Hillis says kind of a similar one,

38
0:02:05.196,000 --> 0:02:07,000
he says, "Technology is anything that doesn't work yet."

39
0:02:07.899,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Laughter)

40
0:02:08.938,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Which is, again, a sense that it's all new.

41
0:02:11.002,000 --> 0:02:12,000
But we know that it's just not new.

42
0:02:12.734,000 --> 0:02:13,000
It actually goes way back,

43
0:02:14.044,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and what I want to suggest is, it goes a long way back.

44
0:02:18.169,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So, another way to think about technology, what it means,

45
0:02:20.961,000 --> 0:02:22,000
is to imagine a world without technology.

46
0:02:23.009,000 --> 0:02:26,000
If we were to eliminate every single bit of technology in the world today --

47
0:02:26.694,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and I mean everything, from blades to scrapers to cloth --

48
0:02:31.635,000 --> 0:02:33,000
we, as a species, would not live very long.

49
0:02:34.394,000 --> 0:02:36,000
We would die by the billions, and very quickly:

50
0:02:37.395,000 --> 0:02:4,000
the wolves would get us, we would be defenseless,

51
0:02:40.724,000 --> 0:02:43,000
we would be unable to grow enough food or find enough food.

52
0:02:43.941,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Even the hunter-gatherers used some elementary tools.

53
0:02:47.401,000 --> 0:02:49,000
So, they had minimal technology,

54
0:02:49.757,000 --> 0:02:5,000
but they had some technology.

55
0:02:51.463,000 --> 0:02:54,000
And if we study those hunter-gatherer tribes

56
0:02:54.62,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and the Neanderthal, which are very similar to early man,

57
0:02:58.296,000 --> 0:03:01,000
we find out a very curious thing about this world without technology,

58
0:03:01.607,000 --> 0:03:03,000
and this is a kind of a curve of their average age.

59
0:03:04.46,000 --> 0:03:08,000
There are no Neanderthal fossils that are older than 40 years old

60
0:03:08.939,000 --> 0:03:09,000
that we've ever found,

61
0:03:10.574,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and the average age of most of these hunter-gatherer tribes is 20 to 30.

62
0:03:14.828,000 --> 0:03:18,000
There are very few young infants, because they die -- high mortality rate --

63
0:03:19.753,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and there's very few old people.

64
0:03:21.325,000 --> 0:03:24,000
So the profile is sort of for your average San Francisco neighborhood:

65
0:03:24.929,000 --> 0:03:25,000
a lot of young people.

66
0:03:26.358,000 --> 0:03:29,000
And if you go there, you say, "Hey, everybody's really healthy."

67
0:03:29.446,000 --> 0:03:3,000
Well, that's because they're all young.

68
0:03:31.374,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Same thing with the hunter-gatherer tribes and early man:

69
0:03:34.129,000 --> 0:03:35,000
you didn't live beyond the age of 30.

70
0:03:35.948,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So it was a world without grandparents.

71
0:03:37.949,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And grandparents are very important,

72
0:03:40.006,000 --> 0:03:43,000
because they are the transmitter of cultural evolution and information.

73
0:03:43.669,000 --> 0:03:46,000
Imagine a world where basically everybody was 20 to 30 years old.

74
0:03:46.829,000 --> 0:03:47,000
How much learning can you do?

75
0:03:48.497,000 --> 0:03:5,000
You can't do very much learning in your own life,

76
0:03:50.856,000 --> 0:03:51,000
it's so short,

77
0:03:52.178,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and there's nobody to pass on what you do learn.

78
0:03:54.556,000 --> 0:03:56,000
So that's one aspect.

79
0:03:57.527,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It was a very short life.

80
0:03:58.867,000 --> 0:04:,000
But at the same time, anthropologists know

81
0:04:01.683,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that most hunter-gatherer tribes of the world,

82
0:04:04.287,000 --> 0:04:05,000
with that very little technology,

83
0:04:05.973,000 --> 0:04:08,000
actually did not spend a very long time gathering the food they needed:

84
0:04:09.483,000 --> 0:04:1,000
three to six hours a day.

85
0:04:11.09,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Some anthropologists call that the original affluent society,

86
0:04:15.135,000 --> 0:04:17,000
because they had bankers' hours, basically.

87
0:04:17.525,000 --> 0:04:19,000
So it was possible to get enough food.

88
0:04:20.183,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But when the scarcity came,

89
0:04:22.708,000 --> 0:04:24,000
when the highs and lows and the droughts came,

90
0:04:25.015,000 --> 0:04:27,000
then people went into starvation.

91
0:04:27.572,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And that's why they didn't live very long.

92
0:04:29.644,000 --> 0:04:31,000
So what technology brought,

93
0:04:32.083,000 --> 0:04:35,000
through the very simple tools like these stone tools here --

94
0:04:36.683,000 --> 0:04:37,000
even something as small as this --

95
0:04:38.52,000 --> 0:04:43,000
the early bands of humans were actually able to eliminate to extinction

96
0:04:43.949,000 --> 0:04:48,000
about 250 megafauna animals in North America

97
0:04:49.065,000 --> 0:04:51,000
when they first arrived 10,000 years ago.

98
0:04:51.278,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So, long before the industrial age,

99
0:04:53.943,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we've been affecting the planet on a global scale

100
0:04:56.635,000 --> 0:04:58,000
with just a small amount of technology.

101
0:04:58.79,000 --> 0:05:01,000
The other thing that the early man invented was fire.

102
0:05:02.11,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And fire was used to clear out, and again,

103
0:05:04.259,000 --> 0:05:07,000
affected the ecology of grass and whole continents,

104
0:05:07.931,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and was used in cooking.

105
0:05:10.353,000 --> 0:05:12,000
It enabled us to actually eat all kinds of things.

106
0:05:12.832,000 --> 0:05:14,000
It was, in a certain sense, in a McLuhan sense,

107
0:05:15.11,000 --> 0:05:17,000
an external stomach,

108
0:05:17.242,000 --> 0:05:2,000
in the sense that it was cooking food that we could not eat otherwise.

109
0:05:20.761,000 --> 0:05:22,000
And if we didn't have fire, we actually could not live.

110
0:05:23.529,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Our bodies have adapted to these new diets.

111
0:05:26.695,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Our bodies have changed in the last 10,000 years.

112
0:05:29.514,000 --> 0:05:32,000
So, with that little bit of technology,

113
0:05:32.594,000 --> 0:05:34,000
humans went from a small band of 10,000 or so --

114
0:05:34.894,000 --> 0:05:36,000
the same number as Neanderthals everywhere --

115
0:05:37.067,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and we suddenly exploded.

116
0:05:38.329,000 --> 0:05:4,000
With the invention of language around 50,000 years ago,

117
0:05:40.954,000 --> 0:05:41,000
the number of humans exploded,

118
0:05:42.471,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and very quickly became the dominant species on the planet.

119
0:05:45.619,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And they migrated into the rest of the world

120
0:05:48.085,000 --> 0:05:49,000
at two kilometers per year

121
0:05:49.549,000 --> 0:05:51,000
until, within several tens of thousands of years,

122
0:05:52.55,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we occupied every single watershed on the planet

123
0:05:54.849,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and became the most dominant species,

124
0:05:56.691,000 --> 0:05:58,000
with a very small amount of technology.

125
0:05:59.078,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And even at that time, with the introduction of agriculture,

126
0:06:02.182,000 --> 0:06:03,000
8,000, 10,000 years ago,

127
0:06:03.916,000 --> 0:06:04,000
we started to see climate change.

128
0:06:05.635,000 --> 0:06:08,000
So climate change is not a new thing; what's new is just the degree of it.

129
0:06:09.243,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Even during the agricultural age, there was climate change.

130
0:06:12.342,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So already, small amounts of technology were transforming the world.

131
0:06:16.102,000 --> 0:06:18,000
And what this means, and where I'm going,

132
0:06:18.787,000 --> 0:06:21,000
is that technology has become the most powerful force in the world.

133
0:06:22.635,000 --> 0:06:24,000
All the things we see today that are changing our lives,

134
0:06:25.586,000 --> 0:06:26,000
we can always trace back

135
0:06:26.797,000 --> 0:06:28,000
to the introduction of some new technology.

136
0:06:28.886,000 --> 0:06:29,000
So it's a force,

137
0:06:30.215,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that is the most powerful force that has been unleashed on this planet,

138
0:06:34.31,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and in such a degree,

139
0:06:36.143,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that I think it's become who we are.

140
0:06:42.388,000 --> 0:06:45,000
In fact, our humanity and everything that we think about ourselves,

141
0:06:45.667,000 --> 0:06:46,000
is something we've invented.

142
0:06:47.159,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So we've invented ourselves.

143
0:06:48.59,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Of all the animals that we've domesticated,

144
0:06:50.732,000 --> 0:06:52,000
the most important animal has been us.

145
0:06:54.093,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So humanity is our greatest invention,

146
0:06:57.635,000 --> 0:06:58,000
but of course, we're not done yet.

147
0:06:59.635,000 --> 0:07:,000
We're still inventing,

148
0:07:00.821,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and this is what technology is allowing us to do;

149
0:07:03.183,000 --> 0:07:05,000
it's continually to reinvent ourselves.

150
0:07:05.243,000 --> 0:07:07,000
It's a very, very strong force.

151
0:07:07.69,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I call this entire thing -- us humans as our technology,

152
0:07:10.849,000 --> 0:07:12,000
everything that we've made, gadgets in our lives --

153
0:07:13.635,000 --> 0:07:14,000
we call that the technium.

154
0:07:14.922,000 --> 0:07:15,000
That's this world.

155
0:07:16.106,000 --> 0:07:17,000
My working definition of technology is:

156
0:07:18.035,000 --> 0:07:2,000
anything useful that a human mind makes.

157
0:07:20.432,000 --> 0:07:22,000
It's not just hammers and gadgets, like laptops.

158
0:07:23.114,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But it's also law.

159
0:07:24.559,000 --> 0:07:29,000
And, of course, cities are ways to make things more useful to us.

160
0:07:29.726,000 --> 0:07:31,000
While this is something that comes from our mind,

161
0:07:32.215,000 --> 0:07:36,000
it also has its roots deeply into the cosmos.

162
0:07:36.532,000 --> 0:07:37,000
It goes back.

163
0:07:37.719,000 --> 0:07:39,000
The origins and roots of technology go back to the Big Bang,

164
0:07:40.606,000 --> 0:07:44,000
in this way, in that they are part of this self-organizing thread

165
0:07:45.118,000 --> 0:07:49,000
that starts at the Big Bang and goes through galaxies and stars,

166
0:07:49.697,000 --> 0:07:5,000
into life, into us.

167
0:07:51.279,000 --> 0:07:53,000
And the three major phases of the early universe

168
0:07:53.931,000 --> 0:07:55,000
was energy, when the dominant force was energy;

169
0:07:56.177,000 --> 0:07:59,000
then the dominant force, as it cooled, became matter;

170
0:07:59.241,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and then, with the invention of life four billion years ago,

171
0:08:02.635,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the dominant force in our neighborhood became information.

172
0:08:05.445,000 --> 0:08:06,000
That's what life is:

173
0:08:06.653,000 --> 0:08:08,000
an information process that was restructuring

174
0:08:08.837,000 --> 0:08:09,000
and making new order.

175
0:08:10.083,000 --> 0:08:13,000
So, energy and matter, Einstein showed were equivalent,

176
0:08:13.724,000 --> 0:08:18,000
and now new sciences of quantum computing show that entropy and information

177
0:08:19.368,000 --> 0:08:2,000
and matter and energy

178
0:08:20.842,000 --> 0:08:21,000
are all interrelated.

179
0:08:22.03,000 --> 0:08:23,000
So it's one long continuum.

180
0:08:24.464,000 --> 0:08:27,000
You put energy into the right kind of system,

181
0:08:27.683,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and out comes wasted heat, entropy,

182
0:08:30.781,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and extropy, which is order.

183
0:08:33.635,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It's the increased order.

184
0:08:34.989,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Where does this order come from?

185
0:08:36.566,000 --> 0:08:37,000
Its roots go way back.

186
0:08:37.861,000 --> 0:08:38,000
We actually don't know.

187
0:08:39.218,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But we do know

188
0:08:40.454,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that the self-organization trend throughout the universe is long,

189
0:08:44.773,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and it began with things like galaxies;

190
0:08:47.02,000 --> 0:08:49,000
they maintained their order for billions of years.

191
0:08:49.538,000 --> 0:08:52,000
Stars are basically nuclear fission machines

192
0:08:53.412,000 --> 0:08:56,000
that self-organize and self-sustain themselves for billions of years:

193
0:08:56.735,000 --> 0:08:58,000
order against the extropy of the world.

194
0:08:58.89,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And flowers and plants are the same thing, extended,

195
0:09:03.824,000 --> 0:09:07,000
and technology is basically an extension of life.

196
0:09:09.483,000 --> 0:09:11,000
One trend that we notice in all those things

197
0:09:12.485,000 --> 0:09:14,000
is that the amount of energy per gram per second

198
0:09:15.081,000 --> 0:09:16,000
that flows through this

199
0:09:16.388,000 --> 0:09:17,000
is actually increasing.

200
0:09:17.703,000 --> 0:09:21,000
The amount of energy is increasing through this little sequence.

201
0:09:22.306,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And the amount of energy per gram per second that flows through life

202
0:09:26.307,000 --> 0:09:27,000
is actually greater than a star --

203
0:09:28.308,000 --> 0:09:31,000
because of the star's long lifespan,

204
0:09:31.635,000 --> 0:09:34,000
the energy density in life is actually higher than a star.

205
0:09:34.848,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And the energy density that we see in the greatest amount

206
0:09:37.731,000 --> 0:09:38,000
anywhere in the universe

207
0:09:38.961,000 --> 0:09:39,000
is actually in a PC chip.

208
0:09:40.318,000 --> 0:09:43,000
There is more energy flowing through, per gram per second,

209
0:09:43.492,000 --> 0:09:46,000
than anything that we have any other experience with.

210
0:09:46.634,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And so, what I would suggest

211
0:09:48.287,000 --> 0:09:5,000
is that if you want to see where technology is going,

212
0:09:51.252,000 --> 0:09:52,000
we continue that trajectory,

213
0:09:52.908,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and we say, "Well, it's going to become more energy-dense,

214
0:09:55.785,000 --> 0:09:56,000
that's where it's going."

215
0:09:57.026,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And so what I've done is, I've taken the same kinds of things

216
0:10:00.018,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and looked at other aspects of evolutionary life and say,

217
0:10:03.308,000 --> 0:10:05,000
"What are the general trends in evolutionary life?"

218
0:10:05.938,000 --> 0:10:07,000
And there are things moving towards greater complexity,

219
0:10:08.684,000 --> 0:10:11,000
moving towards greater diversity, moving towards greater specialization,

220
0:10:12.635,000 --> 0:10:16,000
sentience, ubiquity, and most important, evolvability.

221
0:10:16.901,000 --> 0:10:19,000
Those very same things are also present in technology.

222
0:10:20.448,000 --> 0:10:21,000
That's where technology is going.

223
0:10:22.321,000 --> 0:10:26,000
In fact, technology is accelerating all the aspects of life.

224
0:10:27.635,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And we can see that happening;

225
0:10:29.157,000 --> 0:10:33,000
just as there's diversity in life, there's more diversity in things we make.

226
0:10:33.332,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Things in life start off being general cells,

227
0:10:35.506,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and they become specialized:

228
0:10:36.911,000 --> 0:10:38,000
you have tissue cells, muscle, brain cells.

229
0:10:39.072,000 --> 0:10:41,000
The same thing happens with, say, a hammer,

230
0:10:41.126,000 --> 0:10:43,000
which is general at first and becomes more specific.

231
0:10:43.635,000 --> 0:10:46,000
So I would like to say that while there are six kingdoms of life,

232
0:10:46.755,000 --> 0:10:49,000
we can think of technology basically as a seventh kingdom of life.

233
0:10:50.36,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It's a branching off from the human form.

234
0:10:52.715,000 --> 0:10:55,000
But technology has its own agenda, like anything, like life itself.

235
0:10:56.635,000 --> 0:10:59,000
For instance, right now, three-quarters of the energy that we use

236
0:10:59.801,000 --> 0:11:01,000
is actually used to feed the technium itself.

237
0:11:01.957,000 --> 0:11:02,000
In transportation, it's not to move us;

238
0:11:03.873,000 --> 0:11:04,000
it's to move the stuff we make or buy.

239
0:11:05.766,000 --> 0:11:06,000
I use the word "want." Technology wants.

240
0:11:07.767,000 --> 0:11:1,000
This is a robot that wants to plug itself in to get more power.

241
0:11:10.793,000 --> 0:11:12,000
Your cat wants more food.

242
0:11:13.396,000 --> 0:11:15,000
A bacterium, which has no consciousness at all,

243
0:11:15.983,000 --> 0:11:16,000
wants to move towards light.

244
0:11:17.635,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It has an urge, and technology has an urge.

245
0:11:20.347,000 --> 0:11:22,000
At the same time, it wants to give us things,

246
0:11:22.515,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and what it gives us is basically progress.

247
0:11:25.093,000 --> 0:11:28,000
You can take all kinds of curves, and they're all pointing up.

248
0:11:28.189,000 --> 0:11:3,000
There's really no dispute about progress,

249
0:11:30.635,000 --> 0:11:32,000
if we discount the cost of that.

250
0:11:33.635,000 --> 0:11:35,000
And that's the thing that bothers most people,

251
0:11:35.85,000 --> 0:11:38,000
is that progress is really real, but we wonder and question:

252
0:11:39.738,000 --> 0:11:4,000
What are the environmental costs of it?

253
0:11:41.635,000 --> 0:11:44,000
I did a survey of the number of species of artifacts in my house,

254
0:11:45.486,000 --> 0:11:46,000
and there's 6,000.

255
0:11:46.668,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Other people have come up with 10,000.

256
0:11:48.761,000 --> 0:11:5,000
When King Henry of England died,

257
0:11:51.225,000 --> 0:11:53,000
he had 18,000 things in his house,

258
0:11:53.303,000 --> 0:11:56,000
but that was the entire wealth of England, so ...

259
0:11:56.804,000 --> 0:11:57,000
(Laughter)

260
0:11:58.038,000 --> 0:12:,000
And with that entire wealth of England,

261
0:12:00.568,000 --> 0:12:02,000
King Henry could not buy any antibiotics,

262
0:12:03.518,000 --> 0:12:04,000
he could not buy refrigeration,

263
0:12:05.092,000 --> 0:12:07,000
he could not buy a trip of a thousand miles,

264
0:12:07.249,000 --> 0:12:11,000
whereas this rickshaw wallah in India could save up and buy antibiotics

265
0:12:11.737,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and he could buy refrigeration.

266
0:12:13.504,000 --> 0:12:16,000
He could buy things that King Henry, in all his wealth, could never buy.

267
0:12:16.999,000 --> 0:12:17,000
That's what progress is about.

268
0:12:18.69,000 --> 0:12:2,000
So, technology is selfish; technology is generous.

269
0:12:21.635,000 --> 0:12:24,000
That conflict, that tension, will be with us forever:

270
0:12:24.855,000 --> 0:12:26,000
sometimes it wants to do what it wants to do,

271
0:12:27.077,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and sometimes it's going to do things for us.

272
0:12:29.221,000 --> 0:12:31,000
We have confusion about what we should think

273
0:12:31.312,000 --> 0:12:32,000
about a new technology.

274
0:12:32.635,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Right now the default position when a new technology comes along,

275
0:12:36.489,000 --> 0:12:38,000
is people talk about the precautionary principle,

276
0:12:38.838,000 --> 0:12:39,000
which is very common in Europe,

277
0:12:40.748,000 --> 0:12:42,000
which says, basically, "Don't do anything.

278
0:12:42.819,000 --> 0:12:44,000
When you meet a new technology, stop,

279
0:12:45.457,000 --> 0:12:47,000
until it can be proven that it does no harm."

280
0:12:48.01,000 --> 0:12:5,000
I think that really leads nowhere.

281
0:12:50.279,000 --> 0:12:53,000
But a better way is what I call the proactionary principle,

282
0:12:53.304,000 --> 0:12:55,000
which is, you engage with technology.

283
0:12:55.734,000 --> 0:12:56,000
You try it out.

284
0:12:57.136,000 --> 0:13:01,000
You obviously do what the precautionary principle suggests,

285
0:13:01.376,000 --> 0:13:02,000
you try to anticipate it,

286
0:13:02.645,000 --> 0:13:03,000
but after anticipating it,

287
0:13:04.096,000 --> 0:13:05,000
you constantly asses it,

288
0:13:05.635,000 --> 0:13:06,000
not just once, but eternally.

289
0:13:07.222,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And when it diverts from what you want,

290
0:13:10.423,000 --> 0:13:13,000
we prioritize risk, we evaluate not just the new stuff,

291
0:13:13.608,000 --> 0:13:14,000
but the old stuff.

292
0:13:14.791,000 --> 0:13:15,000
We fix it; but most importantly,

293
0:13:16.685,000 --> 0:13:17,000
we relocate it.

294
0:13:17.866,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And what I mean by that is,

295
0:13:19.714,000 --> 0:13:2,000
we find a new job for it.

296
0:13:21.446,000 --> 0:13:25,000
Nuclear energy, fission, is a really bad idea for bombs.

297
0:13:25.48,000 --> 0:13:3,000
But it may be a pretty good idea relocated into sustainable nuclear energy

298
0:13:30.899,000 --> 0:13:32,000
for electricity, instead of burning coal.

299
0:13:33.241,000 --> 0:13:34,000
When we have a bad idea,

300
0:13:34.98,000 --> 0:13:35,000
the response to a bad idea

301
0:13:36.568,000 --> 0:13:39,000
is not no ideas, it's not to stop thinking.

302
0:13:39.912,000 --> 0:13:41,000
The response to a bad idea --

303
0:13:42.089,000 --> 0:13:44,000
like, say, a tungsten lightbulb --

304
0:13:44.241,000 --> 0:13:46,000
is a better idea.

305
0:13:46.973,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So, better ideas is really always the response

306
0:13:50.477,000 --> 0:13:51,000
to technology we don't like;

307
0:13:51.866,000 --> 0:13:53,000
it's basically better technology.

308
0:13:54.459,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And actually, in a certain sense, technology is a kind of a method

309
0:13:58.303,000 --> 0:13:59,000
for generating better ideas,

310
0:13:59.882,000 --> 0:14:,000
if you can think about it that way.

311
0:14:01.635,000 --> 0:14:04,000
So, maybe spraying DDT on crops is a really bad idea.

312
0:14:04.754,000 --> 0:14:06,000
But DDT sprayed on local homes --

313
0:14:07.635,000 --> 0:14:09,000
there's nothing better to eliminate malaria,

314
0:14:10.635,000 --> 0:14:13,000
besides insect DDT-impregnated mosquito nets.

315
0:14:14.397,000 --> 0:14:17,000
But that's a really good idea; that's a good job for technology.

316
0:14:17.752,000 --> 0:14:2,000
So our job as humans is to parent our mind children,

317
0:14:21.635,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to find them good friends,

318
0:14:23.103,000 --> 0:14:24,000
to find them a good job.

319
0:14:24.519,000 --> 0:14:26,000
And so, every technology is sort of a creative force

320
0:14:27.351,000 --> 0:14:29,000
looking for the right job.

321
0:14:29.395,000 --> 0:14:31,000
That's actually my son, right here.

322
0:14:31.51,000 --> 0:14:32,000
(Laughter)

323
0:14:32.857,000 --> 0:14:34,000
There are no bad technologies,

324
0:14:35.373,000 --> 0:14:36,000
just as there are no bad children.

325
0:14:37.093,000 --> 0:14:39,000
We don't say children are neutral; children are positive.

326
0:14:39.999,000 --> 0:14:41,000
We just have to find them the right place.

327
0:14:42.35,000 --> 0:14:45,000
And so, what technology gives us over the long term --

328
0:14:46.328,000 --> 0:14:49,000
over this sort of extended evolution from the beginning of time,

329
0:14:49.993,000 --> 0:14:52,000
through the invention of the plants and animals,

330
0:14:53.635,000 --> 0:14:55,000
and the evolution of life, the evolution of brains --

331
0:14:56.635,000 --> 0:14:59,000
what that is constantly giving us is increasing differences:

332
0:15:00.57,000 --> 0:15:02,000
It's increasing diversity, it's increasing options,

333
0:15:03.049,000 --> 0:15:06,000
it's increasing choices, opportunities, possibilities and freedoms.

334
0:15:07.051,000 --> 0:15:09,000
That's what we get from technology all the time.

335
0:15:09.999,000 --> 0:15:11,000
That's why people leave villages and go into cities --

336
0:15:12.839,000 --> 0:15:15,000
because they are always gravitating towards increased choices

337
0:15:16.512,000 --> 0:15:17,000
and possibilities.

338
0:15:17.773,000 --> 0:15:19,000
And we are aware of the price;

339
0:15:20.426,000 --> 0:15:22,000
we pay a price for that, but we're aware of it,

340
0:15:22.689,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and generally, we will pay the price for increased freedoms,

341
0:15:25.668,000 --> 0:15:26,000
choices and opportunities.

342
0:15:27.565,000 --> 0:15:29,000
Even technology wants clean water.

343
0:15:30.297,000 --> 0:15:34,000
Is technology diametrically opposed to nature?

344
0:15:34.502,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Because technology is an extension of life,

345
0:15:37.384,000 --> 0:15:39,000
it's in parallel and aligned with the same things

346
0:15:40.251,000 --> 0:15:41,000
that life wants.

347
0:15:42.134,000 --> 0:15:44,000
So that I think technology loves biology,

348
0:15:44.333,000 --> 0:15:45,000
if we allow it to.

349
0:15:46.491,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Great movement starting billions of years ago

350
0:15:50.635,000 --> 0:15:52,000
is moving through us and it continues to go,

351
0:15:52.963,000 --> 0:15:55,000
and our choice, so to speak, in technology,

352
0:15:56.4,000 --> 0:15:58,000
is really to align ourselves with this force

353
0:15:58.495,000 --> 0:15:59,000
much greater than ourselves.

354
0:15:59.903,000 --> 0:16:01,000
So, technology is more than just the stuff in your pocket;

355
0:16:02.735,000 --> 0:16:03,000
it's more than just gadgets,

356
0:16:04.15,000 --> 0:16:06,000
it's more than just things that people invent.

357
0:16:06.639,000 --> 0:16:09,000
It's actually part of a very long story -- a great story --

358
0:16:10.05,000 --> 0:16:11,000
that began billions of years ago.

359
0:16:11.707,000 --> 0:16:13,000
It's moving through us, this self-organization,

360
0:16:14.038,000 --> 0:16:15,000
and we're extending and accelerating it,

361
0:16:16.039,000 --> 0:16:19,000
and we can be part of it by aligning the technology that we make with it.

362
0:16:19.827,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And I really appreciate your attention today.

363
0:16:22.689,000 --> 0:16:23,000
Thank you.

364
0:16:23.872,000 --> 0:16:26,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.632,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'd like to introduce you to an organism:

2
0:00:15.737,000 --> 0:00:18,000
a slime mold, Physarum polycephalum.

3
0:00:19.193,000 --> 0:00:21,000
It's a mold with an identity crisis, because it's not a mold,

4
0:00:22.015,000 --> 0:00:23,000
so let's get that straight to start with.

5
0:00:23.945,000 --> 0:00:25,000
It is one of 700 known slime molds

6
0:00:26.481,000 --> 0:00:28,000
belonging to the kingdom of the amoeba.

7
0:00:28.618,000 --> 0:00:3,000
It is a single-celled organism, a cell,

8
0:00:31.241,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that joins together with other cells

9
0:00:33.481,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to form a mass super-cell

10
0:00:35.713,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to maximize its resources.

11
0:00:37.953,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So within a slime mold you might find thousands

12
0:00:40.113,000 --> 0:00:42,000
or millions of nuclei,

13
0:00:42.36,000 --> 0:00:43,000
all sharing a cell wall,

14
0:00:44.121,000 --> 0:00:47,000
all operating as one entity.

15
0:00:47.229,000 --> 0:00:48,000
In its natural habitat,

16
0:00:48.833,000 --> 0:00:5,000
you might find the slime mold foraging in woodlands,

17
0:00:51.629,000 --> 0:00:54,000
eating rotting vegetation,

18
0:00:55.33,000 --> 0:00:56,000
but you might equally find it

19
0:00:56.87,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in research laboratories,

20
0:00:58.412,000 --> 0:01:02,000
classrooms, and even artists' studios.

21
0:01:02.614,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I first came across the slime mold about five years ago.

22
0:01:05.549,000 --> 0:01:06,000
A microbiologist friend of mine

23
0:01:07.106,000 --> 0:01:1,000
gave me a petri dish with a little yellow blob in it

24
0:01:10.23,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and told me to go home and play with it.

25
0:01:13.238,000 --> 0:01:15,000
The only instructions I was given,

26
0:01:15.245,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that it likes it dark and damp

27
0:01:17.029,000 --> 0:01:21,000
and its favorite food is porridge oats.

28
0:01:21.36,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I'm an artist who's worked for many years

29
0:01:23.378,000 --> 0:01:25,000
with biology, with scientific processes,

30
0:01:26.225,000 --> 0:01:29,000
so living material is not uncommon for me.

31
0:01:29.236,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I've worked with plants, bacteria,

32
0:01:31.341,000 --> 0:01:32,000
cuttlefish, fruit flies.

33
0:01:32.86,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So I was keen to get my new collaborator home

34
0:01:35.462,000 --> 0:01:36,000
to see what it could do.

35
0:01:36.838,000 --> 0:01:39,000
So I took it home and I watched.

36
0:01:40.04,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I fed it a varied diet.

37
0:01:42.81,000 --> 0:01:43,000
I observed as it networked.

38
0:01:44.734,000 --> 0:01:46,000
It formed a connection between food sources.

39
0:01:47.01,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I watched it leave a trail behind it,

40
0:01:49.848,000 --> 0:01:5,000
indicating where it had been.

41
0:01:51.607,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And I noticed that when it was fed up with one petri dish,

42
0:01:54.555,000 --> 0:01:56,000
it would escape and find a better home.

43
0:01:57.534,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I captured my observations

44
0:01:59.262,000 --> 0:02:,000
through time-lapse photography.

45
0:02:01.022,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Slime mold grows at about one centimeter an hour,

46
0:02:03.86,000 --> 0:02:05,000
so it's not really ideal for live viewing

47
0:02:06.441,000 --> 0:02:08,000
unless there's some form of really extreme meditation,

48
0:02:09.294,000 --> 0:02:11,000
but through the time lapse,

49
0:02:11.822,000 --> 0:02:14,000
I could observe some really interesting behaviors.

50
0:02:14.918,000 --> 0:02:17,000
For instance, having fed on a nice pile of oats,

51
0:02:18.418,000 --> 0:02:22,000
the slime mold goes off to explore new territories

52
0:02:22.862,000 --> 0:02:24,000
in different directions simultaneously.

53
0:02:25.594,000 --> 0:02:27,000
When it meets itself,

54
0:02:27.833,000 --> 0:02:28,000
it knows it's already there,

55
0:02:29.7,000 --> 0:02:3,000
it recognizes it's there,

56
0:02:31.654,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and instead retreats back

57
0:02:33.201,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and grows in other directions.

58
0:02:36.881,000 --> 0:02:38,000
I was quite impressed by this feat,

59
0:02:39.205,000 --> 0:02:42,000
at how what was essentially just a bag of cellular slime

60
0:02:42.755,000 --> 0:02:45,000
could somehow map its territory,

61
0:02:45.985,000 --> 0:02:48,000
know itself, and move with seeming intention.

62
0:02:49.457,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I found countless scientific studies,

63
0:02:53.11,000 --> 0:02:55,000
research papers, journal articles,

64
0:02:55.155,000 --> 0:02:59,000
all citing incredible work with this one organism,

65
0:02:59.379,000 --> 0:03:,000
and I'm going to share a few of those with you.

66
0:03:01.343,000 --> 0:03:03,000
For example, a team in Hokkaido University in Japan

67
0:03:04.303,000 --> 0:03:06,000
filled a maze with slime mold.

68
0:03:06.335,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It joined together and formed a mass cell.

69
0:03:08.431,000 --> 0:03:1,000
They introduced food at two points,

70
0:03:10.783,000 --> 0:03:11,000
oats of course,

71
0:03:11.981,000 --> 0:03:12,000
and it formed a connection

72
0:03:13.627,000 --> 0:03:14,000
between the food.

73
0:03:15.041,000 --> 0:03:17,000
It retracted from empty areas and dead ends.

74
0:03:17.525,000 --> 0:03:19,000
There are four possible routes through this maze,

75
0:03:20.335,000 --> 0:03:22,000
yet time and time again,

76
0:03:22.44,000 --> 0:03:24,000
the slime mold established the shortest

77
0:03:24.607,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and the most efficient route.

78
0:03:27.06,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Quite clever.

79
0:03:28.311,000 --> 0:03:29,000
The conclusion from their experiment

80
0:03:30.05,000 --> 0:03:32,000
was that the slime mold had a primitive form of intelligence.

81
0:03:33.047,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Another study exposed cold air at regular intervals to the slime mold.

82
0:03:36.91,000 --> 0:03:38,000
It didn't like it. It doesn't like it cold.

83
0:03:39.255,000 --> 0:03:4,000
It doesn't like it dry.

84
0:03:40.448,000 --> 0:03:42,000
They did this at repeat intervals,

85
0:03:42.563,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and each time, the slime mold

86
0:03:44.221,000 --> 0:03:47,000
slowed down its growth in response.

87
0:03:47.351,000 --> 0:03:48,000
However, at the next interval,

88
0:03:49.195,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the researchers didn't put the cold air on,

89
0:03:52.019,000 --> 0:03:55,000
yet the slime mold slowed down in anticipation

90
0:03:55.313,000 --> 0:03:56,000
of it happening.

91
0:03:56.649,000 --> 0:03:58,000
It somehow knew that it was about the time

92
0:03:59.175,000 --> 0:04:,000
for the cold air that it didn't like.

93
0:04:01.131,000 --> 0:04:02,000
The conclusion from their experiment

94
0:04:02.82,000 --> 0:04:05,000
was that the slime mold was able to learn.

95
0:04:06.09,000 --> 0:04:07,000
A third experiment:

96
0:04:07.321,000 --> 0:04:08,000
the slime mold was invited

97
0:04:09.088,000 --> 0:04:13,000
to explore a territory covered in oats.

98
0:04:13.28,000 --> 0:04:16,000
It fans out in a branching pattern.

99
0:04:16.327,000 --> 0:04:18,000
As it goes, each food node it finds,

100
0:04:18.975,000 --> 0:04:2,000
it forms a network, a connection to,

101
0:04:21.675,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and keeps foraging.

102
0:04:23.423,000 --> 0:04:25,000
After 26 hours, it established

103
0:04:25.864,000 --> 0:04:26,000
quite a firm network

104
0:04:27.481,000 --> 0:04:28,000
between the different oats.

105
0:04:29.271,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now there's nothing remarkable in this

106
0:04:31.091,000 --> 0:04:33,000
until you learn that the center oat that it started from

107
0:04:33.503,000 --> 0:04:35,000
represents the city of Tokyo,

108
0:04:35.517,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and the surrounding oats are suburban railway stations.

109
0:04:39.583,000 --> 0:04:41,000
The slime mold had replicated

110
0:04:42.064,000 --> 0:04:44,000
the Tokyo transport network

111
0:04:44.48,000 --> 0:04:45,000
— (Laughter) —

112
0:04:46.135,000 --> 0:04:48,000
a complex system developed over time

113
0:04:49.13,000 --> 0:04:52,000
by community dwellings, civil engineering, urban planning.

114
0:04:53.03,000 --> 0:04:55,000
What had taken us well over 100 years

115
0:04:55.303,000 --> 0:04:58,000
took the slime mold just over a day.

116
0:04:58.469,000 --> 0:04:59,000
The conclusion from their experiment

117
0:05:00.122,000 --> 0:05:02,000
was that the slime mold can form efficient networks

118
0:05:02.632,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and solve the traveling salesman problem.

119
0:05:05.255,000 --> 0:05:07,000
It is a biological computer.

120
0:05:07.519,000 --> 0:05:09,000
As such, it has been mathematically modeled,

121
0:05:10.143,000 --> 0:05:11,000
algorithmically analyzed.

122
0:05:11.804,000 --> 0:05:13,000
It's been sonified, replicated, simulated.

123
0:05:14.509,000 --> 0:05:16,000
World over, teams of researchers

124
0:05:17.479,000 --> 0:05:19,000
are decoding its biological principles

125
0:05:20.449,000 --> 0:05:22,000
to understand its computational rules

126
0:05:22.59,000 --> 0:05:24,000
and applying that learning to the fields of electronics,

127
0:05:24.844,000 --> 0:05:26,000
programming and robotics.

128
0:05:27.08,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So the question is,

129
0:05:29.234,000 --> 0:05:31,000
how does this thing work?

130
0:05:31.254,000 --> 0:05:33,000
It doesn't have a central nervous system.

131
0:05:33.414,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It doesn't have a brain,

132
0:05:35.112,000 --> 0:05:36,000
yet it can perform behaviors

133
0:05:36.94,000 --> 0:05:37,000
that we associate with brain function.

134
0:05:38.928,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It can learn, it can remember,

135
0:05:40.836,000 --> 0:05:42,000
it can solve problems, it can make decisions.

136
0:05:43.593,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So where does that intelligence lie?

137
0:05:46.308,000 --> 0:05:48,000
So this is a microscopy, a video I shot,

138
0:05:48.8,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and it's about 100 times magnification,

139
0:05:51.453,000 --> 0:05:53,000
sped up about 20 times,

140
0:05:54.32,000 --> 0:05:55,000
and inside the slime mold,

141
0:05:56.106,000 --> 0:05:59,000
there is a rhythmic pulsing flow,

142
0:05:59.548,000 --> 0:06:01,000
a vein-like structure carrying

143
0:06:01.716,000 --> 0:06:04,000
cellular material, nutrients and chemical information

144
0:06:05.488,000 --> 0:06:06,000
through the cell,

145
0:06:07.346,000 --> 0:06:1,000
streaming first in one direction and then back in another.

146
0:06:10.964,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And it is this continuous, synchronous oscillation

147
0:06:14.781,000 --> 0:06:16,000
within the cell that allows it to form

148
0:06:17.037,000 --> 0:06:19,000
quite a complex understanding of its environment,

149
0:06:20.019,000 --> 0:06:23,000
but without any large-scale control center.

150
0:06:23.388,000 --> 0:06:25,000
This is where its intelligence lies.

151
0:06:25.969,000 --> 0:06:28,000
So it's not just academic researchers

152
0:06:29.213,000 --> 0:06:31,000
in universities that are interested in this organism.

153
0:06:31.857,000 --> 0:06:33,000
A few years ago, I set up SliMoCo,

154
0:06:34.73,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the Slime Mould Collective.

155
0:06:37.07,000 --> 0:06:4,000
It's an online, open, democratic network

156
0:06:40.293,000 --> 0:06:42,000
for slime mold researchers and enthusiasts

157
0:06:42.389,000 --> 0:06:44,000
to share knowledge and experimentation

158
0:06:45.118,000 --> 0:06:47,000
across disciplinary divides

159
0:06:48.086,000 --> 0:06:51,000
and across academic divides.

160
0:06:51.781,000 --> 0:06:54,000
The Slime Mould Collective membership is self-selecting.

161
0:06:55.221,000 --> 0:06:57,000
People have found the collective

162
0:06:58.017,000 --> 0:07:01,000
as the slime mold finds the oats.

163
0:07:01.715,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And it comprises of scientists

164
0:07:03.408,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and computer scientists and researchers

165
0:07:04.967,000 --> 0:07:06,000
but also artists like me,

166
0:07:07.254,000 --> 0:07:12,000
architects, designers, writers, activists, you name it.

167
0:07:12.346,000 --> 0:07:16,000
It's a very interesting, eclectic membership.

168
0:07:16.529,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Just a few examples:

169
0:07:17.866,000 --> 0:07:2,000
an artist who paints with fluorescent Physarum;

170
0:07:20.991,000 --> 0:07:21,000
a collaborative team

171
0:07:22.563,000 --> 0:07:25,000
who are combining biological and electronic design

172
0:07:26.341,000 --> 0:07:29,000
with 3D printing technologies in a workshop;

173
0:07:29.486,000 --> 0:07:31,000
another artist who is using the slime mold

174
0:07:31.62,000 --> 0:07:33,000
as a way of engaging a community

175
0:07:33.72,000 --> 0:07:36,000
to map their area.

176
0:07:36.724,000 --> 0:07:38,000
Here, the slime mold is being used directly

177
0:07:38.886,000 --> 0:07:4,000
as a biological tool, but metaphorically

178
0:07:41.764,000 --> 0:07:42,000
as a symbol for ways of talking

179
0:07:43.748,000 --> 0:07:46,000
about social cohesion, communication

180
0:07:47.602,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and cooperation.

181
0:07:49.466,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Other public engagement activities,

182
0:07:51.976,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I run lots of slime mold workshops,

183
0:07:53.994,000 --> 0:07:55,000
a creative way of engaging with the organism.

184
0:07:56.456,000 --> 0:07:57,000
So people are invited to come and learn

185
0:07:58.14,000 --> 0:07:59,000
about what amazing things it can do,

186
0:08:00.036,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and they design their own petri dish experiment,

187
0:08:02.682,000 --> 0:08:04,000
an environment for the slime mold to navigate

188
0:08:04.998,000 --> 0:08:05,000
so they can test its properties.

189
0:08:06.636,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Everybody takes home a new pet

190
0:08:09.08,000 --> 0:08:11,000
and is invited to post their results

191
0:08:12.02,000 --> 0:08:14,000
on the Slime Mould Collective.

192
0:08:14.438,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And the collective has enabled me

193
0:08:15.886,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to form collaborations

194
0:08:18.248,000 --> 0:08:2,000
with a whole array of interesting people.

195
0:08:20.841,000 --> 0:08:21,000
I've been working with filmmakers

196
0:08:22.434,000 --> 0:08:25,000
on a feature-length slime mold documentary,

197
0:08:25.9,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and I stress feature-length,

198
0:08:28.558,000 --> 0:08:29,000
which is in the final stages of edit

199
0:08:30.267,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and will be hitting your cinema screens very soon.

200
0:08:33.293,000 --> 0:08:34,000
(Laughter)

201
0:08:34.773,000 --> 0:08:37,000
It's also enabled me to conduct what I think is

202
0:08:38.108,000 --> 0:08:4,000
the world's first human slime mold experiment.

203
0:08:40.981,000 --> 0:08:42,000
This is part of an exhibition in Rotterdam last year.

204
0:08:43.953,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We invited people to become slime mold for half an hour.

205
0:08:48.644,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So we essentially tied people together

206
0:08:51.985,000 --> 0:08:53,000
so they were a giant cell,

207
0:08:54.309,000 --> 0:08:56,000
and invited them to follow slime mold rules.

208
0:08:57.153,000 --> 0:09:,000
You have to communicate through oscillations,

209
0:09:00.584,000 --> 0:09:01,000
no speaking.

210
0:09:01.88,000 --> 0:09:05,000
You have to operate as one entity, one mass cell,

211
0:09:06.813,000 --> 0:09:07,000
no egos,

212
0:09:08.397,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and the motivation for moving

213
0:09:10.982,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and then exploring the environment

214
0:09:12.89,000 --> 0:09:13,000
is in search of food.

215
0:09:14.789,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So a chaotic shuffle ensued as this bunch of strangers

216
0:09:18.42,000 --> 0:09:21,000
tied together with yellow ropes wearing "Being Slime Mold" t-shirts

217
0:09:22.328,000 --> 0:09:24,000
wandered through the museum park.

218
0:09:25.284,000 --> 0:09:28,000
When they met trees, they had to reshape

219
0:09:28.61,000 --> 0:09:31,000
their connections and reform as a mass cell

220
0:09:31.742,000 --> 0:09:34,000
through not speaking.

221
0:09:35.729,000 --> 0:09:38,000
This is a ludicrous experiment in many, many ways.

222
0:09:39.087,000 --> 0:09:4,000
This isn't hypothesis-driven.

223
0:09:41.036,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We're not trying to prove, demonstrate anything.

224
0:09:43.479,000 --> 0:09:45,000
But what it did provide us was a way

225
0:09:45.613,000 --> 0:09:47,000
of engaging a broad section of the public

226
0:09:47.961,000 --> 0:09:51,000
with ideas of intelligence, agency, autonomy,

227
0:09:52.392,000 --> 0:09:54,000
and provide a playful platform

228
0:09:54.721,000 --> 0:09:57,000
for discussions about

229
0:09:58.453,000 --> 0:10:,000
the things that ensued.

230
0:10:00.837,000 --> 0:10:02,000
One of the most exciting things

231
0:10:03.17,000 --> 0:10:05,000
about this experiment

232
0:10:06.03,000 --> 0:10:08,000
was the conversation that happened afterwards.

233
0:10:08.217,000 --> 0:10:11,000
An entirely spontaneous symposium happened in the park.

234
0:10:12.04,000 --> 0:10:14,000
People talked about the human psychology,

235
0:10:14.069,000 --> 0:10:15,000
of how difficult it was to let go

236
0:10:15.726,000 --> 0:10:18,000
of their individual personalities and egos.

237
0:10:19.035,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Other people talked about bacterial communication.

238
0:10:22.218,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Each person brought in their own

239
0:10:24.197,000 --> 0:10:26,000
individual interpretation,

240
0:10:27.054,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and our conclusion from this experiment was that

241
0:10:28.959,000 --> 0:10:31,000
the people of Rotterdam were highly cooperative,

242
0:10:32.865,000 --> 0:10:34,000
especially when given beer.

243
0:10:35.661,000 --> 0:10:36,000
We didn't just give them oats.

244
0:10:37.627,000 --> 0:10:38,000
We gave them beer as well.

245
0:10:39.189,000 --> 0:10:41,000
But they weren't as efficient as the slime mold,

246
0:10:41.383,000 --> 0:10:42,000
and the slime mold, for me,

247
0:10:43.367,000 --> 0:10:45,000
is a fascinating subject matter.

248
0:10:45.736,000 --> 0:10:46,000
It's biologically fascinating,

249
0:10:47.593,000 --> 0:10:48,000
it's computationally interesting,

250
0:10:49.177,000 --> 0:10:51,000
but it's also a symbol,

251
0:10:51.251,000 --> 0:10:54,000
a way of engaging with ideas of community,

252
0:10:54.909,000 --> 0:10:57,000
collective behavior, cooperation.

253
0:10:58.563,000 --> 0:11:,000
A lot of my work draws on the scientific research,

254
0:11:00.689,000 --> 0:11:03,000
so this pays homage to the maze experiment

255
0:11:03.873,000 --> 0:11:04,000
but in a different way.

256
0:11:05.455,000 --> 0:11:07,000
And the slime mold is also my working material.

257
0:11:07.813,000 --> 0:11:12,000
It's a coproducer of photographs, prints, animations,

258
0:11:13.03,000 --> 0:11:14,000
participatory events.

259
0:11:14.629,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Whilst the slime mold doesn't choose

260
0:11:16.977,000 --> 0:11:17,000
to work with me, exactly,

261
0:11:18.883,000 --> 0:11:2,000
it is a collaboration of sorts.

262
0:11:21.485,000 --> 0:11:23,000
I can predict certain behaviors

263
0:11:23.577,000 --> 0:11:25,000
by understanding how it operates,

264
0:11:25.633,000 --> 0:11:26,000
but I can't control it.

265
0:11:27.363,000 --> 0:11:28,000
The slime mold has the final say

266
0:11:28.947,000 --> 0:11:3,000
in the creative process.

267
0:11:31.078,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And after all, it has its own internal aesthetics.

268
0:11:34.567,000 --> 0:11:35,000
These branching patterns that we see

269
0:11:36.371,000 --> 0:11:38,000
we see across all forms, scales of nature,

270
0:11:38.921,000 --> 0:11:4,000
from river deltas to lightning strikes,

271
0:11:41.721,000 --> 0:11:45,000
from our own blood vessels to neural networks.

272
0:11:45.757,000 --> 0:11:47,000
There's clearly significant rules at play

273
0:11:48.22,000 --> 0:11:5,000
in this simple yet complex organism,

274
0:11:50.485,000 --> 0:11:53,000
and no matter what our disciplinary perspective or our mode of inquiry,

275
0:11:54.277,000 --> 0:11:55,000
there's a great deal that we can learn

276
0:11:56.06,000 --> 0:11:57,000
from observing and engaging

277
0:11:57.829,000 --> 0:12:,000
with this beautiful, brainless blob.

278
0:12:00.95,000 --> 0:12:03,000
I give you Physarum polycephalum.

279
0:12:04.165,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Thank you.

280
0:12:05.918,000 --> 0:12:05,000
(Applause)

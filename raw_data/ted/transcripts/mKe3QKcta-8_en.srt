1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Thank you so much. I'm going to try to take you

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
on a journey of the underwater acoustic world

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
of whales and dolphins.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Since we are such a visual species,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
it's hard for us to really understand this,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
so I'll use a mixture of figures and sounds

7
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and hope this can communicate it.

8
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
But let's also think, as a visual species,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
what it's like when we go snorkeling or diving

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and try to look underwater.

11
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
We really can't see very far.

12
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Our vision, which works so well in air,

13
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
all of a sudden is very restricted and claustrophobic.

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
And what marine mammals have evolved

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
over the last tens of millions of years

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
is ways to depend on sound

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
to both explore their world

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and also to stay in touch with one another.

19
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Dolphins and toothed whales use echolocation.

20
0:00:58.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
They can produce loud clicks

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and listen for echoes from the sea floor in order to orient.

22
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
They can listen for echoes from prey

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
in order to decide where food is

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and to decide which one they want to eat.

25
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
All marine mammals use sound for communication to stay in touch.

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So the large baleen whales

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
will produce long, beautiful songs,

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
which are used in reproductive advertisement

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
for male and females, both to find one another

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and to select a mate.

31
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
And mother and young and closely bonded animals

32
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
use calls to stay in touch with one another,

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
so sound is really critical for their lives.

34
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
The first thing that got me interested in the sounds

35
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
of these underwater animals,

36
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
whose world was so foreign to me,

37
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:38,000
was evidence from captive dolphins

38
0:01:38.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
that captive dolphins could imitate human sounds.

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
And I mentioned I'll use

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
some visual representations of sounds.

41
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Here's the first example.

42
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
This is a plot of frequency against time --

43
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
sort of like musical notation,

44
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
where the higher notes are up higher and the lower notes are lower,

45
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and time goes this way.

46
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
This is a picture of a trainer's whistle,

47
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
a whistle a trainer will blow to tell a dolphin

48
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
it's done the right thing and can come get a fish.

49
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
It sounds sort of like "tweeeeeet." Like that.

50
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
This is a calf in captivity

51
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
making an imitation

52
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
of that trainer's whistle.

53
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
If you hummed this tune to your dog or cat

54
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and it hummed it back to you,

55
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
you ought to be pretty surprised.

56
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Very few nonhuman mammals

57
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
can imitate sounds.

58
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
It's really important for our music and our language.

59
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
So it's a puzzle: The few other mammal groups that do this,

60
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
why do they do it?

61
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
A lot of my career has been devoted

62
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to trying to understand

63
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
how these animals use their learning,

64
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
use the ability to change what you say

65
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
based on what you hear

66
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
in their own communication systems.

67
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
So let's start with calls of a nonhuman primate.

68
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
Many mammals have to produce contact calls

69
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
when, say, a mother and calf are apart.

70
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
This is an example of a call produced by squirrel monkeys

71
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
when they're isolated from another one.

72
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And you can see, there's not much

73
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
variability in these calls.

74
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
By contrast, the signature whistle

75
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
which dolphins use to stay in touch,

76
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
each individual here has a radically different call.

77
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
They can use this ability to learn calls

78
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in order to develop more complicated and more distinctive calls

79
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
to identify individuals.

80
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
How about the setting in which animals need to use this call?

81
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Well let's look at mothers and calves.

82
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
In normal life for mother and calf dolphin,

83
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:23,000
they'll often drift apart or swim apart if Mom is chasing a fish,

84
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and when they separate

85
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
they have to get back together again.

86
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
What this figure shows is the percentage of the separations

87
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
in which dolphins whistle,

88
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
against the maximum distance.

89
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So when dolphins are separating by less than 20 meters,

90
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
less than half the time they need to use whistles.

91
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Most of the time they can just find each other

92
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
just by swimming around.

93
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
But all of the time when they separate by more than 100 meters,

94
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
they need to use these individually distinctive whistles

95
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
to come back together again.

96
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Most of these distinctive signature whistles

97
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
are quite stereotyped and stable

98
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
through the life of a dolphin.

99
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
But there are some exceptions.

100
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
When a male dolphin leaves Mom,

101
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
it will often join up with another male

102
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and form an alliance, which may last for decades.

103
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
As these two animals form a social bond,

104
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
their distinctive whistles actually converge

105
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
and become very similar.

106
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
This plot shows two members of a pair.

107
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
As you can see at the top here,

108
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
they share an up-sweep, like "woop, woop, woop."

109
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
They both have that kind of up-sweep.

110
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Whereas these members of a pair go "wo-ot, wo-ot, wo-ot."

111
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And what's happened is

112
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
they've used this learning process

113
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to develop a new sign that identifies this new social group.

114
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
It's a very interesting way that they can

115
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
form a new identifier

116
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
for the new social group that they've had.

117
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
Let's now take a step back

118
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
and see what this message can tell us

119
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
about protecting dolphins

120
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
from human disturbance.

121
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Anybody looking at this picture

122
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
will know this dolphin is surrounded,

123
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and clearly his behavior is being disrupted.

124
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
This is a bad situation.

125
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
But it turns out that when just a single boat

126
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
is approaching a group of dolphins

127
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
at a couple hundred meters away,

128
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
the dolphins will start whistling,

129
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
they'll change what they're doing, they'll have a more cohesive group,

130
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
wait for the boat to go by,

131
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and then they'll get back to normal business.

132
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Well, in a place like Sarasota, Florida,

133
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
the average interval between times

134
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that a boat is passing within a hundred meters of a dolphin group

135
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
is six minutes.

136
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So even in the situation that doesn't look as bad as this,

137
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
it's still affecting the amount of time these animals have

138
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
to do their normal work.

139
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And if we look at a very pristine environment like western Australia,

140
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Lars Bider has done work

141
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
comparing dolphin behavior and distribution

142
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
before there were dolphin-watching boats.

143
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
When there was one boat, not much of an impact.

144
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And two boats: When the second boat was added,

145
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
what happened was that some of the dolphins

146
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
left the area completely.

147
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Of the ones that stayed, their reproductive rate declined.

148
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So it could have a negative impact on the whole population.

149
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
When we think of marine-protected areas for animals like dolphins,

150
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
this means that we have to be

151
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
quite conscious about activities that we thought were benign.

152
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
We may need to regulate the intensity

153
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
of recreational boating and actual whale watching

154
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
in order to prevent these kinds of problems.

155
0:06:08.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I'd also like to point out that sound

156
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
doesn't obey boundaries.

157
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So you can draw a line to try to protect an area,

158
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but chemical pollution and noise pollution

159
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
will continue to move through the area.

160
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
And I'd like to switch now from this local,

161
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:24,000
familiar, coastal environment

162
0:06:24.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
to a much broader world of the baleen whales and the open ocean.

163
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
This is a kind of map we've all been looking at.

164
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
The world is mostly blue.

165
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
But I'd also like to point out that the oceans

166
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
are much more connected than we think.

167
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Notice how few barriers there are to movement

168
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
across all of the oceans compared to land.

169
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
To me, the most mind-bending example

170
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
of the interconnectedness of the ocean

171
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
comes from an acoustic experiment

172
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
where oceanographers

173
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
took a ship to the southern Indian Ocean,

174
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
deployed an underwater loudspeaker

175
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
and played back a sound.

176
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
That same sound

177
0:06:58.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
traveled to the west, and could be heard in Bermuda,

178
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and traveled to the east, and could be heard in Monterey --

179
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
the same sound.

180
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
So we live in a world of satellite communication,

181
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
are used to global communication,

182
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
but it's still amazing to me.

183
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
The ocean has properties

184
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
that allow low-frequency sound

185
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
to basically move globally.

186
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
The acoustic transit time for each of these paths is about three hours.

187
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
It's nearly halfway around the globe.

188
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
In the early '70s,

189
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Roger Payne and an ocean acoustician

190
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
published a theoretical paper

191
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
pointing out that it was possible

192
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
that sound could transmit over these large areas,

193
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but very few biologists believed it.

194
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It actually turns out, though,

195
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
even though we've only known of long-range propagation for a few decades,

196
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
the whales clearly have evolved,

197
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
over tens of millions of years,

198
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
a way to exploit this amazing property of the ocean.

199
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:53,000
So blue whales and fin whales

200
0:07:53.26,000 --> 0:07:55,000
produce very low-frequency sounds

201
0:07:55.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
that can travel over very long ranges.

202
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
The top plot here shows

203
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
a complicated series of calls

204
0:08:01.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
that are repeated by males.

205
0:08:03.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
They form songs, and they appear to play a role in reproduction,

206
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:08,000
sort of like that of song birds.

207
0:08:08.26,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Down below here, we see calls made by both males and females

208
0:08:11.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
that also carry over very long ranges.

209
0:08:15.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
The biologists continued to be skeptical

210
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
of the long-range communication issue

211
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
well past the '70s,

212
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
until the end of the Cold War.

213
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
What happened was, during the Cold War,

214
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
the U.S. Navy had a system that was secret at the time,

215
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
that they used to track Russian submarines.

216
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
It had deep underwater microphones, or hydrophones,

217
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
cabled to shore,

218
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
all wired back to a central place that could listen

219
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
to sounds over the whole North Atlantic.

220
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
And after the Berlin Wall fell, the Navy made these systems available

221
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
to whale bio-acousticians

222
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
to see what they could hear.

223
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
This is a plot from Christopher Clark

224
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
who tracked one individual blue whale

225
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
as it passed by Bermuda,

226
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
went down to the latitude of Miami and came back again.

227
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
It was tracked for 43 days,

228
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
swimming 1,700 kilometers,

229
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
or more than 1,000 miles.

230
0:09:02.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
This shows us both that the calls

231
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
are detectable over hundreds of miles

232
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and that whales routinely swim hundreds of miles.

233
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
They're ocean-based and scale animals

234
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
who are communicating over much longer ranges

235
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
than we had anticipated.

236
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Unlike fins and blues, which

237
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
disperse into the temperate and tropical oceans,

238
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
the humpbacked whales congregate

239
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:23,000
in local traditional breeding grounds,

240
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
so they can make a sound that's a little higher in frequency,

241
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
broader-band and more complicated.

242
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
So you're listening to the complicated song

243
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
produced by humpbacks here.

244
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Humpbacks, when they develop

245
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
the ability to sing this song,

246
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
they're listening to other whales

247
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and modifying what they sing based on what they're hearing,

248
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
just like song birds or the dolphin whistles I described.

249
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
This means that humpback song

250
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
is a form of animal culture,

251
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
just like music for humans would be.

252
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I think one of the most interesting examples of this

253
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
comes from Australia.

254
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
Biologists on the east coast of Australia

255
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
were recording the songs of humpbacks in that area.

256
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
And this orange line here marks the typical songs

257
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
of east coast humpbacks.

258
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
In '95 they all sang the normal song.

259
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
But in '96 they heard a few weird songs,

260
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
and it turned out that these strange songs

261
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
were typical of west coast whales.

262
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
The west coast calls became more and more popular,

263
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
until by 1998,

264
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
none of the whales sang the east coast song; it was completely gone.

265
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
They just sang the cool new west coast song.

266
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
It's as if some new hit style

267
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
had completely wiped out

268
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
the old-fashioned style before,

269
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and with no golden oldies stations.

270
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Nobody sang the old ones.

271
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I'd like to briefly just show what the ocean does to these calls.

272
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Now you are listening to a recording made by Chris Clark,

273
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
0.2 miles away from a humpback.

274
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
You can hear the full frequency range. It's quite loud.

275
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
You sound very nearby.

276
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
The next recording you're going to hear

277
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
was made of the same humpback song

278
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
50 miles away.

279
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
That's shown down here.

280
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
You only hear the low frequencies.

281
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
You hear the reverberation

282
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
as the sound travels over long-range in the ocean

283
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and is not quite as loud.

284
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
Now after I play back these humpback calls,

285
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
I'll play blue whale calls, but they have to be sped up

286
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
because they're so low in frequency

287
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that you wouldn't be able to hear it otherwise.

288
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Here's a blue whale call at 50 miles,

289
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
which was distant for the humpback.

290
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
It's loud, clear -- you can hear it very clearly.

291
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Here's the same call recorded from a hydrophone

292
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
500 miles away.

293
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
There's a lot of noise, which is mostly other whales.

294
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
But you can still hear that faint call.

295
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Let's now switch and think about

296
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
a potential for human impacts.

297
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
The most dominant sound that humans put into the ocean

298
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
comes from shipping.

299
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
This is the sound of a ship,

300
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and I'm having to talk a little louder to talk over it.

301
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
Imagine that whale listening from 500 miles.

302
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
There's a potential problem that maybe

303
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
this kind of shipping noise would prevent whales

304
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
from being able to hear each other.

305
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Now this is something that's been known for quite a while.

306
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
This is a figure from a textbook on underwater sound.

307
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:03,000
And on the y-axis

308
0:12:03.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
is the loudness of average ambient noise in the deep ocean

309
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
by frequency.

310
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
In the low frequencies, this line indicates

311
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:14,000
sound that comes from seismic activity of the earth.

312
0:12:14.26,000 --> 0:12:16,000
Up high, these variable lines

313
0:12:16.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
indicate increasing noise in this frequency range

314
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:21,000
from higher wind and wave.

315
0:12:21.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But right in the middle here where there's a sweet spot,

316
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
the noise is dominated by human ships.

317
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Now think about it. This is an amazing thing:

318
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
That in this frequency range where whales communicate,

319
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:34,000
the main source globally, on our planet, for the noise

320
0:12:34.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
comes from human ships,

321
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:39,000
thousands of human ships, distant, far away,

322
0:12:39.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
just all aggregating.

323
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
The next slide will show what the impact this may have

324
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
on the range at which whales can communicate.

325
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:49,000
So here we have the loudness of a call at the whale.

326
0:12:49.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
And as we get farther away,

327
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
the sound gets fainter and fainter.

328
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:56,000
Now in the pre-industrial ocean, as we were mentioning,

329
0:12:56.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
this whale call could be easily detected.

330
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
It's louder than noise

331
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
at a range of a thousand kilometers.

332
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Let's now take that additional increase in noise

333
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
that we saw comes from shipping.

334
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
All of a sudden, the effective range of communication

335
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
goes from a thousand kilometers to 10 kilometers.

336
0:13:12.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Now if this signal is used for males and females

337
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
to find each other for mating and they're dispersed,

338
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
imagine the impact this could have

339
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
on the recovery of endangered populations.

340
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Whales also have contact calls

341
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
like I described for the dolphins.

342
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I'll play the sound of a contact call used

343
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
by right whales to stay in touch.

344
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
And this is the kind of call that is used by,

345
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
say, right whale mothers and calves

346
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
as they separate to come back again.

347
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
Now imagine -- let's put the ship noise in the picture.

348
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:41,000
What's a mother to do

349
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
if the ship comes by and her calf isn't there?

350
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
I'll describe a couple strategies.

351
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
One strategy is if your call's down here,

352
0:13:48.26,000 --> 0:13:5,000
and the noise is in this band,

353
0:13:50.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
you could shift the frequency of your call out of the noise band

354
0:13:53.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
and communicate better.

355
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:58,000
Susan Parks of Penn State has actually studied this.

356
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
She's looked in the Atlantic. Here's data from the South Atlantic.

357
0:14:01.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
Here's a typical South Atlantic contact call from the '70s.

358
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
Look what happened by 2000 to the average call.

359
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Same thing in the North Atlantic,

360
0:14:09.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
in the '50s versus 2000.

361
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
Over the last 50 years,

362
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:15,000
as we've put more noise into the oceans,

363
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
these whales have had to shift.

364
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
It's as if the whole population had to shift

365
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:22,000
from being basses to singing as a tenor.

366
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:24,000
It's an amazing shift, induced by humans

367
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
over this large scale,

368
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
in both time and space.

369
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:3,000
And we now know that whales can compensate for noise

370
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
by calling louder, like I did when that ship was playing,

371
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
by waiting for silence

372
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
and by shifting their call out of the noise band.

373
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
Now there's probably costs to calling louder

374
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
or shifting the frequency away from where you want to be,

375
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and there's probably lost opportunities.

376
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:46,000
If we also have to wait for silence,

377
0:14:46.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
they may miss a critical opportunity to communicate.

378
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
So we have to be very concerned

379
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
about when the noise in habitats

380
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
degrades the habitat enough

381
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
that the animals either have to pay too much to be able to communicate,

382
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
or are not able to perform critical functions.

383
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:03,000
It's a really important problem.

384
0:15:03.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And I'm happy to say that there are several

385
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
very promising developments in this area,

386
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
looking at the impact of shipping on whales.

387
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
In terms of the shipping noise,

388
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
the International Maritime Organization of the United Nations

389
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
has formed a group whose job is to establish

390
0:15:19.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
guidelines for quieting ships,

391
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
to tell the industry how you could quiet ships.

392
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:25,000
And they've already found

393
0:15:25.26,000 --> 0:15:28,000
that by being more intelligent about better propeller design,

394
0:15:28.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
you can reduce that noise by 90 percent.

395
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
If you actually insulate and isolate

396
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
the machinery of the ship from the hull,

397
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:39,000
you can reduce that noise by 99 percent.

398
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
So at this point, it's primarily an issue of cost and standards.

399
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
If this group can establish standards,

400
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
and if the shipbuilding industry adopts them for building new ships,

401
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:49,000
we can now see a gradual decline

402
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
in this potential problem.

403
0:15:51.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
But there's also another problem from ships that I'm illustrating here,

404
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and that's the problem of collision.

405
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:59,000
This is a whale that just squeaked by

406
0:15:59.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
a rapidly moving container ship and avoided collision.

407
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
But collision is a serious problem.

408
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
Endangered whales are killed every year by ship collision,

409
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
and it's very important to try to reduce this.

410
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:13,000
I'll discuss two very promising approaches.

411
0:16:13.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
The first case comes from the Bay of Fundy.

412
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
These black lines mark shipping lanes

413
0:16:17.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
in and out of the Bay of Fundy.

414
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
The colorized area

415
0:16:21.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
shows the risk of collision for endangered right whales

416
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
because of the ships moving in this lane.

417
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:29,000
It turns out that this lane here

418
0:16:29.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
goes right through a major feeding area of right whales in the summer time,

419
0:16:32.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and it makes an area of a significant risk of collision.

420
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:37,000
Well, biologists

421
0:16:37.26,000 --> 0:16:39,000
who couldn't take no for an answer

422
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:41,000
went to the International Maritime Organization

423
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:43,000
and petitioned them to say,

424
0:16:43.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
"Can't you move that lane? Those are just lines on the ground.

425
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:47,000
Can't you move them over to a place

426
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
where there's less of a risk?"

427
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
And the International Maritime Organization responded very strongly,

428
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
"These are the new lanes."

429
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
The shipping lanes have been moved.

430
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
And as you can see, the risk of collision is much lower.

431
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
So it's very promising, actually.

432
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:02,000
We can be very creative about thinking

433
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
of different ways to reduce these risks.

434
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
Another action which was just taken independently

435
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
by a shipping company itself

436
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:12,000
was initiated because of concerns the shipping company had

437
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:15,000
about greenhouse gas emissions with global warming.

438
0:17:15.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
The Maersk Line looked at their competition

439
0:17:18.26,000 --> 0:17:21,000
and saw that everybody who is in shipping thinks time is money.

440
0:17:21.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
They rush as fast as they can to get to their port.

441
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
But then they often wait there.

442
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
What Maersk did is they worked ways to slow down.

443
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
They could slow down by about 50 percent.

444
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:33,000
This reduced their fuel consumption by about 30 percent,

445
0:17:33.26,000 --> 0:17:35,000
which saved them money,

446
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
and at the same time, it had a significant benefit for whales.

447
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
It you slow down, you reduce the amount of noise you make

448
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and you reduce the risk of collision.

449
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
So to conclude, I'd just like to point out,

450
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
you know, the whales live in

451
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
an amazing acoustic environment.

452
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:51,000
They've evolved over tens of millions of years

453
0:17:51.26,000 --> 0:17:53,000
to take advantage of this.

454
0:17:53.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
And we need to be very attentive and vigilant

455
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
to thinking about where things that we do

456
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
may unintentionally prevent them

457
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:03,000
from being able to achieve their important activities.

458
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
At the same time, we need to be really creative

459
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:08,000
in thinking of solutions to be able to help reduce these problems.

460
0:18:08.26,000 --> 0:18:1,000
I hope these examples have shown

461
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:12,000
some of the different directions we can take

462
0:18:12.26,000 --> 0:18:14,000
in addition to protected areas

463
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:17,000
to be able to keep the ocean safe for whales to be able to continue to communicate.

464
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
Thank you very much.

465
0:18:19.26,000 --> 0:18:21,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:13,000
When I was first learning to meditate,

2
0:00:14.64,000 --> 0:00:17,000
the instruction was to simply pay attention to my breath,

3
0:00:17.72,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and when my mind wandered, to bring it back.

4
0:00:20.64,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Sounded simple enough.

5
0:00:22.68,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats,

6
0:00:25.92,000 --> 0:00:28,000
sweating through T-shirts in the middle of winter.

7
0:00:29.28,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'd take naps every chance I got because it was really hard work.

8
0:00:32.64,000 --> 0:00:34,000
Actually, it was exhausting.

9
0:00:35.4,000 --> 0:00:36,000
The instruction was simple enough

10
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but I was missing something really important.

11
0:00:40.32,000 --> 0:00:42,000
So why is it so hard to pay attention?

12
0:00:43.08,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Well, studies show

13
0:00:44.56,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that even when we're really trying to pay attention to something --

14
0:00:47.76,000 --> 0:00:48,000
like maybe this talk --

15
0:00:49.36,000 --> 0:00:5,000
at some point,

16
0:00:50.6,000 --> 0:00:52,000
about half of us will drift off into a daydream,

17
0:00:52.96,000 --> 0:00:54,000
or have this urge to check our Twitter feed.

18
0:00:56.36,000 --> 0:00:57,000
So what's going on here?

19
0:00:59,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It turns out that we're fighting one of the most evolutionarily-conserved

20
0:01:02.48,000 --> 0:01:04,000
learning processes currently known in science,

21
0:01:05.36,000 --> 0:01:06,000
one that's conserved

22
0:01:06.6,000 --> 0:01:08,000
back to the most basic nervous systems known to man.

23
0:01:09.84,000 --> 0:01:1,000
This reward-based learning process

24
0:01:11.52,000 --> 0:01:13,000
is called positive and negative reinforcement,

25
0:01:13.72,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and basically goes like this.

26
0:01:16.2,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We see some food that looks good,

27
0:01:17.92,000 --> 0:01:19,000
our brain says, "Calories! ... Survival!"

28
0:01:20.64,000 --> 0:01:21,000
We eat the food, we taste it --

29
0:01:22.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
it tastes good.

30
0:01:23.4,000 --> 0:01:24,000
And especially with sugar,

31
0:01:24.96,000 --> 0:01:26,000
our bodies send a signal to our brain that says,

32
0:01:27.24,000 --> 0:01:29,000
"Remember what you're eating and where you found it."

33
0:01:31.28,000 --> 0:01:33,000
We lay down this context-dependent memory

34
0:01:34.04,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and learn to repeat the process next time.

35
0:01:36.52,000 --> 0:01:37,000
See food,

36
0:01:37.76,000 --> 0:01:38,000
eat food, feel good,

37
0:01:39.48,000 --> 0:01:4,000
repeat.

38
0:01:40.96,000 --> 0:01:42,000
Trigger, behavior, reward.

39
0:01:43.6,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Simple, right?

40
0:01:45.92,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Well, after a while, our creative brains say,

41
0:01:48.08,000 --> 0:01:49,000
"You know what?

42
0:01:49.32,000 --> 0:01:52,000
You can use this for more than just remembering where food is.

43
0:01:52.96,000 --> 0:01:54,000
You know, next time you feel bad,

44
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
why don't you try eating something good so you'll feel better?"

45
0:01:59.72,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We thank our brains for the great idea,

46
0:02:01.76,000 --> 0:02:02,000
try this and quickly learn

47
0:02:03.36,000 --> 0:02:06,000
that if we eat chocolate or ice cream when we're mad or sad,

48
0:02:06.68,000 --> 0:02:07,000
we feel better.

49
0:02:08.64,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Same process,

50
0:02:10.04,000 --> 0:02:11,000
just a different trigger.

51
0:02:11.8,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Instead of this hunger signal coming from our stomach,

52
0:02:14.92,000 --> 0:02:15,000
this emotional signal -- feeling sad --

53
0:02:16.92,000 --> 0:02:17,000
triggers that urge to eat.

54
0:02:19.04,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Maybe in our teenage years,

55
0:02:21.199,000 --> 0:02:22,000
we were a nerd at school,

56
0:02:23.6,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and we see those rebel kids outside smoking and we think,

57
0:02:26.32,000 --> 0:02:27,000
"Hey, I want to be cool."

58
0:02:27.6,000 --> 0:02:28,000
So we start smoking.

59
0:02:29.8,000 --> 0:02:32,000
The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork, and that was no accident.

60
0:02:33.56,000 --> 0:02:34,000
See cool,

61
0:02:34.8,000 --> 0:02:35,000
smoke to be cool,

62
0:02:36.12,000 --> 0:02:37,000
feel good. Repeat.

63
0:02:37.96,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Trigger, behavior, reward.

64
0:02:40.64,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And each time we do this,

65
0:02:41.92,000 --> 0:02:43,000
we learn to repeat the process

66
0:02:43.96,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and it becomes a habit.

67
0:02:45.92,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So later,

68
0:02:47.24,000 --> 0:02:5,000
feeling stressed out triggers that urge to smoke a cigarette

69
0:02:50.88,000 --> 0:02:51,000
or to eat something sweet.

70
0:02:53.2,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Now, with these same brain processes,

71
0:02:56.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
we've gone from learning to survive

72
0:02:58.08,000 --> 0:03:,000
to literally killing ourselves with these habits.

73
0:03:00.96,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Obesity and smoking

74
0:03:02.24,000 --> 0:03:06,000
are among the leading preventable causes of morbidity and mortality in the world.

75
0:03:07.48,000 --> 0:03:08,000
So back to my breath.

76
0:03:09.72,000 --> 0:03:11,000
What if instead of fighting our brains,

77
0:03:12.12,000 --> 0:03:14,000
or trying to force ourselves to pay attention,

78
0:03:14.68,000 --> 0:03:18,000
we instead tapped into this natural, reward-based learning process ...

79
0:03:18.72,000 --> 0:03:19,000
but added a twist?

80
0:03:20.52,000 --> 0:03:22,000
What if instead we just got really curious

81
0:03:22.6,000 --> 0:03:24,000
about what was happening in our momentary experience?

82
0:03:25.12,000 --> 0:03:26,000
I'll give you an example.

83
0:03:26.68,000 --> 0:03:27,000
In my lab,

84
0:03:27.92,000 --> 0:03:3,000
we studied whether mindfulness training could help people quit smoking.

85
0:03:31.28,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now, just like trying to force myself to pay attention to my breath,

86
0:03:34.96,000 --> 0:03:37,000
they could try to force themselves to quit smoking.

87
0:03:38.24,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And the majority of them had tried this before and failed --

88
0:03:41.2,000 --> 0:03:42,000
on average, six times.

89
0:03:43.96,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now, with mindfulness training,

90
0:03:45.48,000 --> 0:03:48,000
we dropped the bit about forcing and instead focused on being curious.

91
0:03:49.6,000 --> 0:03:52,000
In fact, we even told them to smoke.

92
0:03:52.84,000 --> 0:03:53,000
What? Yeah, we said, "Go ahead and smoke,

93
0:03:54.84,000 --> 0:03:57,000
just be really curious about what it's like when you do."

94
0:03:58.4,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And what did they notice?

95
0:04:00.12,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Well here's an example from one of our smokers.

96
0:04:02.84,000 --> 0:04:03,000
She said, "Mindful smoking:

97
0:04:04.6,000 --> 0:04:05,000
smells like stinky cheese

98
0:04:06.24,000 --> 0:04:07,000
and tastes like chemicals,

99
0:04:07.88,000 --> 0:04:08,000
YUCK!"

100
0:04:09.68,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Now, she knew, cognitively that smoking was bad for her,

101
0:04:13.08,000 --> 0:04:14,000
that's why she joined our program.

102
0:04:15.68,000 --> 0:04:19,000
What she discovered just by being curiously aware when she smoked

103
0:04:20.24,000 --> 0:04:23,000
was that smoking tastes like shit.

104
0:04:23.4,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter)

105
0:04:26.36,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom.

106
0:04:30.399,000 --> 0:04:33,000
She moved from knowing in her head that smoking was bad for her

107
0:04:33.519,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to knowing it in her bones,

108
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and the spell of smoking was broken.

109
0:04:38.32,000 --> 0:04:41,000
She started to become disenchanted with her behavior.

110
0:04:42.96,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Now, the prefrontal cortex,

111
0:04:45.08,000 --> 0:04:48,000
that youngest part of our brain from an evolutionary perspective,

112
0:04:48.64,000 --> 0:04:52,000
it understands on an intellectual level that we shouldn't smoke.

113
0:04:52.72,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And it tries its hardest to help us change our behavior,

114
0:04:56.56,000 --> 0:04:57,000
to help us stop smoking,

115
0:04:57.92,000 --> 0:05:01,000
to help us stop eating that second, that third, that fourth cookie.

116
0:05:02.96,000 --> 0:05:03,000
We call this cognitive control.

117
0:05:04.48,000 --> 0:05:06,000
We're using cognition to control our behavior.

118
0:05:07.96,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Unfortunately,

119
0:05:09.2,000 --> 0:05:1,000
this is also the first part of our brain

120
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that goes offline when we get stressed out,

121
0:05:13.2,000 --> 0:05:14,000
which isn't that helpful.

122
0:05:14.48,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Now, we can all relate to this in our own experience.

123
0:05:16.981,000 --> 0:05:19,000
We're much more likely to do things like yell at our spouse or kids

124
0:05:20.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
when we're stressed out or tired,

125
0:05:21.8,000 --> 0:05:23,000
even though we know it's not going to be helpful.

126
0:05:24.16,000 --> 0:05:25,000
We just can't help ourselves.

127
0:05:27.12,000 --> 0:05:29,000
When the prefrontal cortex goes offline,

128
0:05:29.32,000 --> 0:05:31,000
we fall back into our old habits,

129
0:05:31.56,000 --> 0:05:33,000
which is why this disenchantment is so important.

130
0:05:34.44,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Seeing what we get from our habits

131
0:05:36.12,000 --> 0:05:38,000
helps us understand them at a deeper level --

132
0:05:38.32,000 --> 0:05:39,000
to know it in our bones

133
0:05:39.6,000 --> 0:05:41,000
so we don't have to force ourselves to hold back

134
0:05:41.88,000 --> 0:05:42,000
or restrain ourselves from behavior.

135
0:05:43.64,000 --> 0:05:45,000
We're just less interested in doing it in the first place.

136
0:05:46.44,000 --> 0:05:48,000
And this is what mindfulness is all about:

137
0:05:49,000 --> 0:05:52,000
Seeing really clearly what we get when we get caught up in our behaviors,

138
0:05:53.56,000 --> 0:05:56,000
becoming disenchanted on a visceral level

139
0:05:57.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
and from this disenchanted stance, naturally letting go.

140
0:06:00.92,000 --> 0:06:03,000
This isn't to say that, poof, magically we quit smoking.

141
0:06:04.44,000 --> 0:06:06,000
But over time, as we learn to see more and more clearly

142
0:06:07.08,000 --> 0:06:08,000
the results of our actions,

143
0:06:08.44,000 --> 0:06:1,000
we let go of old habits and form new ones.

144
0:06:12.12,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The paradox here

145
0:06:13.48,000 --> 0:06:15,000
is that mindfulness is just about being really interested

146
0:06:16.32,000 --> 0:06:17,000
in getting close and personal

147
0:06:17.76,000 --> 0:06:19,000
with what's actually happening in our bodies and minds

148
0:06:20.36,000 --> 0:06:21,000
from moment to moment.

149
0:06:22,000 --> 0:06:24,000
This willingness to turn toward our experience

150
0:06:24.32,000 --> 0:06:27,000
rather than trying to make unpleasant cravings go away as quickly as possible.

151
0:06:28.76,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And this willingness to turn toward our experience

152
0:06:31.36,000 --> 0:06:32,000
is supported by curiosity,

153
0:06:33.24,000 --> 0:06:34,000
which is naturally rewarding.

154
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:36,000
What does curiosity feel like?

155
0:06:36.76,000 --> 0:06:37,000
It feels good.

156
0:06:39.04,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And what happens when we get curious?

157
0:06:41.37,000 --> 0:06:44,000
We start to notice that cravings are simply made up of body sensations --

158
0:06:44.84,000 --> 0:06:46,000
oh, there's tightness, there's tension,

159
0:06:47.12,000 --> 0:06:48,000
there's restlessness --

160
0:06:48.8,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and that these body sensations come and go.

161
0:06:51.88,000 --> 0:06:53,000
These are bite-size pieces of experiences

162
0:06:54.88,000 --> 0:06:56,000
that we can manage from moment to moment

163
0:06:56.92,000 --> 0:07:,000
rather than getting clobbered by this huge, scary craving

164
0:07:01.08,000 --> 0:07:02,000
that we choke on.

165
0:07:02.48,000 --> 0:07:04,000
In other words, when we get curious,

166
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:09,000
we step out of our old, fear-based, reactive habit patterns,

167
0:07:09.76,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and we step into being.

168
0:07:12,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We become this inner scientist

169
0:07:14.92,000 --> 0:07:17,000
where we're eagerly awaiting that next data point.

170
0:07:18.16,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Now, this might sound too simplistic to affect behavior.

171
0:07:22.72,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But in one study, we found that mindfulness training

172
0:07:25.2,000 --> 0:07:28,000
was twice as good as gold standard therapy at helping people quit smoking.

173
0:07:29.12,000 --> 0:07:3,000
So it actually works.

174
0:07:31.8,000 --> 0:07:33,000
And when we studied the brains of experienced meditators,

175
0:07:34.64,000 --> 0:07:37,000
we found that parts of a neural network of self-referential processing

176
0:07:38.48,000 --> 0:07:39,000
called the default mode network

177
0:07:40.08,000 --> 0:07:41,000
were at play.

178
0:07:41.32,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Now, one current hypothesis is that a region of this network,

179
0:07:44.28,000 --> 0:07:46,000
called the posterior cingulate cortex,

180
0:07:46.52,000 --> 0:07:48,000
is activated not necessarily by craving itself

181
0:07:49.28,000 --> 0:07:51,000
but when we get caught up in it, when we get sucked in,

182
0:07:51.92,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and it takes us for a ride.

183
0:07:53.64,000 --> 0:07:55,000
In contrast, when we let go --

184
0:07:55.76,000 --> 0:07:56,000
step out of the process

185
0:07:57.16,000 --> 0:07:59,000
just by being curiously aware of what's happening --

186
0:07:59.68,000 --> 0:08:01,000
this same brain region quiets down.

187
0:08:03.32,000 --> 0:08:07,000
Now we're testing app and online-based mindfulness training programs

188
0:08:07.44,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that target these core mechanisms

189
0:08:10.6,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and, ironically, use the same technology that's driving us to distraction

190
0:08:15.12,000 --> 0:08:17,000
to help us step out of our unhealthy habit patterns

191
0:08:17.68,000 --> 0:08:21,000
of smoking, of stress eating and other addictive behaviors.

192
0:08:21.72,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Now, remember that bit about context-dependent memory?

193
0:08:24.32,000 --> 0:08:26,000
We can deliver these tools to peoples' fingertips

194
0:08:27.24,000 --> 0:08:29,000
in the contexts that matter most.

195
0:08:29.52,000 --> 0:08:3,000
So we can help them

196
0:08:30.76,000 --> 0:08:32,000
tap into their inherent capacity to be curiously aware

197
0:08:33.76,000 --> 0:08:36,000
right when that urge to smoke or stress eat or whatever arises.

198
0:08:38.64,000 --> 0:08:39,000
So if you don't smoke or stress eat,

199
0:08:40.48,000 --> 0:08:43,000
maybe the next time you feel this urge to check your email when you're bored,

200
0:08:44.159,000 --> 0:08:46,000
or you're trying to distract yourself from work,

201
0:08:46.423,000 --> 0:08:49,000
or maybe to compulsively respond to that text message when you're driving,

202
0:08:51.08,000 --> 0:08:54,000
see if you can tap into this natural capacity,

203
0:08:54.96,000 --> 0:08:55,000
just be curiously aware

204
0:08:56.24,000 --> 0:08:58,000
of what's happening in your body and mind in that moment.

205
0:08:59.2,000 --> 0:09:,000
It will just be another chance

206
0:09:00.68,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to perpetuate one of our endless and exhaustive habit loops ...

207
0:09:04.36,000 --> 0:09:05,000
or step out of it.

208
0:09:06.08,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Instead of see text message, compulsively text back,

209
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:1,000
feel a little bit better --

210
0:09:10.76,000 --> 0:09:11,000
notice the urge,

211
0:09:12.24,000 --> 0:09:13,000
get curious,

212
0:09:13.72,000 --> 0:09:14,000
feel the joy of letting go

213
0:09:15.68,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and repeat.

214
0:09:17.44,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Thank you.

215
0:09:18.68,000 --> 0:09:2,000
(Applause)

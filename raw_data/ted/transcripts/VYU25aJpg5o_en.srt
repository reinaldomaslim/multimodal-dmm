1
0:00:13.617,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In December of 2010,

2
0:00:17.293,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the city of Apatzingán

3
0:00:19.11,000 --> 0:00:22,000
in the coastal state of Michoacán, in Mexico,

4
0:00:22.262,000 --> 0:00:24,000
awoke to gunfire.

5
0:00:24.632,000 --> 0:00:25,000
For two straight days,

6
0:00:26.208,000 --> 0:00:28,000
the city became an open battlefield

7
0:00:28.626,000 --> 0:00:29,000
between the federal forces

8
0:00:30.41,000 --> 0:00:31,000
and a well-organized group,

9
0:00:32.079,000 --> 0:00:34,000
presumably from the local criminal organization,

10
0:00:34.862,000 --> 0:00:37,000
La Familia Michoacana, or the Michoacán family.

11
0:00:38.234,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The citizens didn't only experience incessant gunfire

12
0:00:41.384,000 --> 0:00:43,000
but also explosions

13
0:00:43.804,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and burning trucks used as barricades across the city,

14
0:00:47.075,000 --> 0:00:49,000
so truly like a battlefield.

15
0:00:49.092,000 --> 0:00:5,000
After these two days,

16
0:00:50.622,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and during a particularly intense encounter,

17
0:00:53.427,000 --> 0:00:55,000
it was presumed that the leader of La Familia Michoacana,

18
0:00:55.994,000 --> 0:00:57,000
Nazario Moreno, was killed.

19
0:00:58.499,000 --> 0:01:,000
In response to this terrifying violence,

20
0:01:00.51,000 --> 0:01:01,000
the mayor of Apatzingán

21
0:01:02.509,000 --> 0:01:04,000
decided to call the citizens to a march for peace.

22
0:01:04.809,000 --> 0:01:07,000
The idea was to ask for a softer approach

23
0:01:08.156,000 --> 0:01:1,000
to criminal activity in the state.

24
0:01:10.574,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And so, the day of the scheduled procession,

25
0:01:13.768,000 --> 0:01:14,000
thousands of people showed up.

26
0:01:15.622,000 --> 0:01:16,000
As the mayor was preparing to deliver

27
0:01:17.316,000 --> 0:01:19,000
the speech starting the march,

28
0:01:19.427,000 --> 0:01:2,000
his team noticed

29
0:01:20.929,000 --> 0:01:23,000
that, while half of the participants

30
0:01:24.087,000 --> 0:01:25,000
were appropriately dressed in white,

31
0:01:25.762,000 --> 0:01:27,000
and bearing banners asking for peace,

32
0:01:28.602,000 --> 0:01:3,000
the other half was actually marching

33
0:01:30.771,000 --> 0:01:33,000
in support of the criminal organization

34
0:01:33.862,000 --> 0:01:36,000
and its now-presumed-defunct leader.

35
0:01:37.046,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Shocked, the mayor decided to step aside

36
0:01:40.115,000 --> 0:01:42,000
rather than participate or lead a procession

37
0:01:42.126,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that was ostensibly in support of organized crime.

38
0:01:45.511,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And so his team stepped aside.

39
0:01:47.753,000 --> 0:01:49,000
The two marches joined together,

40
0:01:49.829,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and they continued their path

41
0:01:52.834,000 --> 0:01:54,000
towards the state capital.

42
0:01:55.444,000 --> 0:01:59,000
This story of horrific violence

43
0:02:00.255,000 --> 0:02:02,000
followed by a fumbled approach

44
0:02:02.452,000 --> 0:02:04,000
by federal and local authorities as they tried

45
0:02:04.647,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to engage civil society,

46
0:02:06.07,000 --> 0:02:09,000
who has been very well engaged by a criminal organization,

47
0:02:09.426,000 --> 0:02:12,000
is a perfect metaphor for what's happening in Mexico today,

48
0:02:12.89,000 --> 0:02:15,000
where we see that our current understanding

49
0:02:16.239,000 --> 0:02:18,000
of drug violence and what leads to it

50
0:02:18.607,000 --> 0:02:2,000
is probably at the very least incomplete.

51
0:02:21.209,000 --> 0:02:23,000
If you decided to spend 30 minutes trying

52
0:02:23.212,000 --> 0:02:25,000
to figure out what's going on with drug violence in Mexico

53
0:02:25.242,000 --> 0:02:27,000
by, say, just researching online,

54
0:02:27.881,000 --> 0:02:28,000
the first thing you would find out is that

55
0:02:29.722,000 --> 0:02:32,000
while the laws state that all Mexican citizens are equal,

56
0:02:33.689,000 --> 0:02:34,000
there are some that are more

57
0:02:34.808,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and there are some that are much less equal than others,

58
0:02:38.167,000 --> 0:02:39,000
because you will quickly find out

59
0:02:39.418,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that in the past six years

60
0:02:41.122,000 --> 0:02:43,000
anywhere between 60 and 100,000 people

61
0:02:43.27,000 --> 0:02:46,000
have lost their lives in drug-related violence.

62
0:02:46.828,000 --> 0:02:47,000
To put these numbers in perspective,

63
0:02:48.575,000 --> 0:02:5,000
this is eight times larger than the number of casualties

64
0:02:51.391,000 --> 0:02:55,000
in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars combined.

65
0:02:55.912,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It's also shockingly close to the number of people

66
0:02:58.416,000 --> 0:03:,000
who have died in the Syrian civil war,

67
0:03:00.942,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which is an active civil war.

68
0:03:03.155,000 --> 0:03:06,000
This is happening just south of the border.

69
0:03:06.351,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Now as you're reading, however,

70
0:03:07.955,000 --> 0:03:08,000
you will be maybe surprised that you will quickly

71
0:03:09.638,000 --> 0:03:11,000
become numb to the numbers of deaths,

72
0:03:11.674,000 --> 0:03:14,000
because you will see that these are sort of abstract numbers

73
0:03:15.36,000 --> 0:03:18,000
of faceless, nameless dead people.

74
0:03:18.953,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Implicitly or explicitly, there is a narrative

75
0:03:21.677,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that all the people who are dying

76
0:03:23.512,000 --> 0:03:25,000
were somehow involved in the drug trade,

77
0:03:26.368,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and we infer this because they were either tortured

78
0:03:29.964,000 --> 0:03:31,000
or executed in a professional manner,

79
0:03:32.125,000 --> 0:03:33,000
or, most likely, both.

80
0:03:33.777,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And so clearly they were criminals

81
0:03:35.758,000 --> 0:03:37,000
because of the way they died.

82
0:03:38.373,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And so the narrative is that somehow these people

83
0:03:40.936,000 --> 0:03:41,000
got what they were deserved.

84
0:03:42.179,000 --> 0:03:44,000
They were part of the bad guys.

85
0:03:44.63,000 --> 0:03:46,000
And that creates some form of comfort

86
0:03:47.178,000 --> 0:03:48,000
for a lot of people.

87
0:03:48.81,000 --> 0:03:5,000
However, while it's easier to think

88
0:03:51.774,000 --> 0:03:54,000
of us, the citizens, the police, the army,

89
0:03:55.759,000 --> 0:03:58,000
as the good guys, and them, the narcos,

90
0:03:59.331,000 --> 0:04:02,000
the carteles, as the bad guys,

91
0:04:02.625,000 --> 0:04:03,000
if you think about it,

92
0:04:03.791,000 --> 0:04:06,000
the latter are only providing a service to the former.

93
0:04:07.599,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Whether we like it or not,

94
0:04:09.714,000 --> 0:04:11,000
the U.S. is the largest market

95
0:04:12.375,000 --> 0:04:13,000
for illegal substances in the world,

96
0:04:13.993,000 --> 0:04:16,000
accounting for more than half of global demand.

97
0:04:17.047,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It shares thousands of miles of border with Mexico

98
0:04:20.307,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that is its only route of access from the South,

99
0:04:23.425,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and so, as the former dictator of Mexico, Porfirio Diaz,

100
0:04:26.48,000 --> 0:04:28,000
used to say, "Poor Mexico,

101
0:04:29.209,000 --> 0:04:35,000
so far from God and so close to the United States."

102
0:04:35.401,000 --> 0:04:37,000
The U.N. estimates that there are 55 million users

103
0:04:38.25,000 --> 0:04:4,000
of illegal drugs in the United States.

104
0:04:40.717,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Using very, very conservative assumptions,

105
0:04:43.143,000 --> 0:04:46,000
this yields a yearly drug market on the retail side

106
0:04:46.24,000 --> 0:04:48,000
of anywhere between 30 and 150 billion dollars.

107
0:04:49.023,000 --> 0:04:51,000
If we assume that the narcos only have access

108
0:04:51.692,000 --> 0:04:53,000
to the wholesale part, which we know is false,

109
0:04:54.416,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that still leaves you with yearly revenues

110
0:04:56.757,000 --> 0:05:,000
of anywhere between 15 billion and 60 billion dollars.

111
0:05:01.275,000 --> 0:05:02,000
To put these numbers in perspective,

112
0:05:03.191,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Microsoft has yearly revenues of 60 billion dollars.

113
0:05:07.984,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And it so happens that this is a product that,

114
0:05:10.49,000 --> 0:05:12,000
because of its nature, a business model

115
0:05:13.465,000 --> 0:05:15,000
to address this market requires you

116
0:05:16.219,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to guarantee to your producers

117
0:05:18.348,000 --> 0:05:2,000
that their product will be reliably placed

118
0:05:20.966,000 --> 0:05:22,000
in the markets where it is consumed.

119
0:05:23.083,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And the only way to do this, because it's illegal,

120
0:05:26.64,000 --> 0:05:29,000
is to have absolute control of the geographic corridors

121
0:05:29.65,000 --> 0:05:31,000
that are used to transport drugs.

122
0:05:31.949,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Hence the violence.

123
0:05:34.466,000 --> 0:05:37,000
If you look at a map of cartel influence and violence,

124
0:05:37.498,000 --> 0:05:39,000
you will see that it almost perfectly aligns

125
0:05:39.618,000 --> 0:05:4,000
with the most efficient routes of transportation

126
0:05:41.402,000 --> 0:05:42,000
from the south to the north.

127
0:05:43.297,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The only thing that the cartels are doing

128
0:05:44.453,000 --> 0:05:46,000
is that they're trying to protect their business.

129
0:05:47.204,000 --> 0:05:49,000
It's not only a multi-billion dollar market,

130
0:05:49.629,000 --> 0:05:51,000
but it's also a complex one.

131
0:05:51.724,000 --> 0:05:53,000
For example, the coca plant is a fragile plant

132
0:05:54.448,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that can only grow in certain latitudes,

133
0:05:56.764,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and so it means that a business model

134
0:05:58.5,000 --> 0:05:59,000
to address this market requires you to have

135
0:06:00.235,000 --> 0:06:02,000
decentralized, international production,

136
0:06:02.756,000 --> 0:06:04,000
that by the way needs to have good quality control,

137
0:06:05.3,000 --> 0:06:07,000
because people need a good high

138
0:06:07.801,000 --> 0:06:08,000
that is not going to kill them

139
0:06:09.386,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and that is going to be delivered to them when they need it.

140
0:06:12.248,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And so that means they need to secure

141
0:06:14.241,000 --> 0:06:16,000
production and quality control in the south,

142
0:06:17.143,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and you need to ensure that you have

143
0:06:19.15,000 --> 0:06:21,000
efficient and effective distribution channels

144
0:06:21.642,000 --> 0:06:24,000
in the markets where these drugs are consumed.

145
0:06:25.081,000 --> 0:06:26,000
I urge you, but only a little bit,

146
0:06:26.672,000 --> 0:06:28,000
because I don't want to get you in trouble,

147
0:06:28.883,000 --> 0:06:31,000
to just ask around and see how difficult it would be

148
0:06:32.169,000 --> 0:06:34,000
to get whatever drug you want, wherever you want it,

149
0:06:35.026,000 --> 0:06:37,000
whenever you want it, anywhere in the U.S.,

150
0:06:37.971,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and some of you may be surprised to know

151
0:06:40.784,000 --> 0:06:42,000
that there are many dealers that offer a service

152
0:06:42.798,000 --> 0:06:43,000
where if you send them a text message,

153
0:06:44.622,000 --> 0:06:45,000
they guarantee delivery of the drug

154
0:06:46.327,000 --> 0:06:48,000
in 30 minutes or less.

155
0:06:49.209,000 --> 0:06:51,000
Think about this for a second.

156
0:06:51.63,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Think about the complexity

157
0:06:53.361,000 --> 0:06:56,000
of the distribution network that I just described.

158
0:06:56.761,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It's very difficult to reconcile this

159
0:06:59.259,000 --> 0:07:03,000
with the image of faceless, ignorant goons

160
0:07:03.381,000 --> 0:07:05,000
that are just shooting each other,

161
0:07:05.986,000 --> 0:07:06,000
very difficult to reconcile.

162
0:07:07.674,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Now, as a business professor, and as any business professor would tell you,

163
0:07:11.003,000 --> 0:07:13,000
an effective organization requires

164
0:07:13.678,000 --> 0:07:14,000
an integrated strategy that includes

165
0:07:15.587,000 --> 0:07:17,000
a good organizational structure, good incentives,

166
0:07:18.46,000 --> 0:07:2,000
a solid identity and good brand management.

167
0:07:21.452,000 --> 0:07:23,000
This leads me to the second thing that you would learn

168
0:07:23.587,000 --> 0:07:25,000
in your 30-minute exploration of drug violence in Mexico.

169
0:07:26.487,000 --> 0:07:27,000
Because you would quickly realize,

170
0:07:28.049,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and maybe be confused by the fact,

171
0:07:29.712,000 --> 0:07:3,000
that there are three organizations

172
0:07:30.949,000 --> 0:07:33,000
that are constantly named in the articles.

173
0:07:34.484,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You will hear about Los Zetas,

174
0:07:36.558,000 --> 0:07:37,000
the Knights Templar, which is the new brand

175
0:07:38.529,000 --> 0:07:4,000
for the Familia Michoacana that I spoke about at the beginning,

176
0:07:41.387,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and the Sinaloa Federation.

177
0:07:43.761,000 --> 0:07:45,000
You will read that Los Zetas is this assortment

178
0:07:46.552,000 --> 0:07:5,000
of sociopaths that terrify the cities that they enter

179
0:07:50.907,000 --> 0:07:52,000
and they silence the press,

180
0:07:53.033,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and this is somewhat true, or mostly true.

181
0:07:56.407,000 --> 0:08:,000
But this is the result of a very careful branding

182
0:08:00.486,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and business strategy.

183
0:08:02.287,000 --> 0:08:04,000
You see, Los Zetas is not just

184
0:08:04.456,000 --> 0:08:05,000
this random assortment of individuals,

185
0:08:06.256,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but was actually created by another criminal organization, the Gulf Cartel,

186
0:08:09.911,000 --> 0:08:12,000
that used to control the eastern corridor of Mexico.

187
0:08:12.923,000 --> 0:08:14,000
When that corridor became contested, they decided

188
0:08:15.337,000 --> 0:08:16,000
that they wanted to recruit

189
0:08:17.127,000 --> 0:08:19,000
a professional enforcement arm.

190
0:08:19.958,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So they recruited Los Zetas:

191
0:08:23.567,000 --> 0:08:25,000
an entire unit of elite paratroopers

192
0:08:26.325,000 --> 0:08:29,000
from the Mexican Army.

193
0:08:29.342,000 --> 0:08:32,000
They were incredibly effective as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel,

194
0:08:33.048,000 --> 0:08:34,000
so much so that at some point, they decided

195
0:08:34.936,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to just take over the operations,

196
0:08:37.429,000 --> 0:08:4,000
which is why I ask you to never keep tigers as pets,

197
0:08:41.223,000 --> 0:08:43,000
because they grow up.

198
0:08:43.864,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Because the Zetas organization was founded in treason,

199
0:08:47.56,000 --> 0:08:49,000
they lost some of the linkages to the production and distribution

200
0:08:50.496,000 --> 0:08:52,000
in the most profitable markets like cocaine,

201
0:08:52.703,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but what they did have,

202
0:08:53.993,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and this is again based on their military origin,

203
0:08:56.453,000 --> 0:08:58,000
was a perfectly structured chain of command

204
0:08:59.3,000 --> 0:09:01,000
with a very clear hierarchy

205
0:09:01.925,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and a very clear promotion path that allowed them

206
0:09:05.989,000 --> 0:09:08,000
to supervise and operate across many, many markets

207
0:09:09.811,000 --> 0:09:1,000
very effectively,

208
0:09:11.453,000 --> 0:09:14,000
which is the essence of what a chain of command seeks to do.

209
0:09:15.252,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And so because they didn't have access

210
0:09:16.541,000 --> 0:09:18,000
to the more profitable drug markets,

211
0:09:18.876,000 --> 0:09:19,000
this pushed them and gave them the opportunity

212
0:09:20.549,000 --> 0:09:23,000
to diversify into other forms of crime.

213
0:09:24.047,000 --> 0:09:28,000
That includes kidnapping, prostitution,

214
0:09:28.102,000 --> 0:09:3,000
local drug dealing and human trafficking,

215
0:09:30.283,000 --> 0:09:33,000
including of migrants that go from the south to the U.S.

216
0:09:34.239,000 --> 0:09:38,000
So what they currently run is truly

217
0:09:38.487,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and quite literally a franchise business.

218
0:09:42.059,000 --> 0:09:45,000
They focus most of their recruiting on the army,

219
0:09:45.89,000 --> 0:09:48,000
and they very openly advertise for better salaries,

220
0:09:48.967,000 --> 0:09:5,000
better benefits, better promotion paths,

221
0:09:51.665,000 --> 0:09:52,000
not to mention much better food,

222
0:09:53.313,000 --> 0:09:55,000
than what the army can deliver.

223
0:09:56.02,000 --> 0:09:57,000
The way they operate is that

224
0:09:57.889,000 --> 0:09:58,000
when they arrive in a locality,

225
0:09:59.794,000 --> 0:10:,000
they let people know that they are there,

226
0:10:01.545,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and they go to the most powerful local gang

227
0:10:04.615,000 --> 0:10:06,000
and they say, "I offer you

228
0:10:06.855,000 --> 0:10:09,000
to be the local representative of the Zeta brand."

229
0:10:10.044,000 --> 0:10:11,000
If they agree -- and you don't want to know

230
0:10:11.917,000 --> 0:10:12,000
what happens if they don't --

231
0:10:13.66,000 --> 0:10:14,000
they train them and they supervise them

232
0:10:15.347,000 --> 0:10:18,000
on how to run the most efficient criminal operation

233
0:10:18.674,000 --> 0:10:21,000
for that town, in exchange for royalties.

234
0:10:22.175,000 --> 0:10:23,000
This kind of business model obviously depends

235
0:10:24.081,000 --> 0:10:26,000
entirely on having a very effective brand of fear,

236
0:10:26.478,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and so Los Zetas

237
0:10:28.851,000 --> 0:10:3,000
carefully stage acts of violence

238
0:10:31.144,000 --> 0:10:32,000
that are spectacular in nature,

239
0:10:33.077,000 --> 0:10:35,000
especially when they arrive first in a city,

240
0:10:35.877,000 --> 0:10:38,000
but again, that's just a brand strategy.

241
0:10:39.111,000 --> 0:10:4,000
I'm not saying they're not violent,

242
0:10:41.01,000 --> 0:10:42,000
but what I am saying is that even though you will read

243
0:10:42.953,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that they are the most violent of all,

244
0:10:44.816,000 --> 0:10:46,000
when you count, when you do the body count,

245
0:10:47.779,000 --> 0:10:5,000
they're actually all the same.

246
0:10:51.551,000 --> 0:10:54,000
In contrast to them, the Knights Templar

247
0:10:54.639,000 --> 0:10:55,000
that arose in Michoacán

248
0:10:56.479,000 --> 0:10:58,000
emerged in reaction to the incursion

249
0:10:59.086,000 --> 0:11:01,000
of the Zetas into the state of Michoacán.

250
0:11:01.621,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Michoacán is a geographically strategic state

251
0:11:04.538,000 --> 0:11:06,000
because it has one of the largest ports in Mexico,

252
0:11:06.541,000 --> 0:11:08,000
and it has very direct routes to the center of Mexico,

253
0:11:09.132,000 --> 0:11:12,000
which then gives you direct access to the U.S.

254
0:11:12.198,000 --> 0:11:13,000
The Knights Templar realized very quickly

255
0:11:13.737,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that they couldn't face the Zetas on violence alone,

256
0:11:17.245,000 --> 0:11:19,000
and so they developed a strategy

257
0:11:19.602,000 --> 0:11:21,000
as a social enterprise.

258
0:11:22.381,000 --> 0:11:25,000
They brand themselves as representative of

259
0:11:25.381,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and protecting of the citizens of Michoacán

260
0:11:28.037,000 --> 0:11:3,000
against organized crime.

261
0:11:30.335,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Their brand of social enterprise means

262
0:11:32.066,000 --> 0:11:34,000
that they require a lot of civic engagement,

263
0:11:34.117,000 --> 0:11:38,000
so they invest heavily in providing local services,

264
0:11:38.283,000 --> 0:11:41,000
like dealing with home violence,

265
0:11:41.781,000 --> 0:11:44,000
going after petty criminals, treating addicts,

266
0:11:45.557,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and keeping drugs out of the local markets

267
0:11:48.335,000 --> 0:11:5,000
where they are,

268
0:11:50.815,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and, of course, protecting people

269
0:11:52.434,000 --> 0:11:54,000
from other criminal organizations.

270
0:11:54.925,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Now, they kill a lot of people too,

271
0:11:57.956,000 --> 0:11:59,000
but when they kill them,

272
0:12:00.068,000 --> 0:12:02,000
they provide very careful narratives and descriptions

273
0:12:02.968,000 --> 0:12:03,000
for why they did them,

274
0:12:04.22,000 --> 0:12:07,000
through newspaper insertions, YouTube videos,

275
0:12:08.183,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and billboards that explain that the people who were killed

276
0:12:10.649,000 --> 0:12:12,000
were killed because they represented a threat

277
0:12:12.977,000 --> 0:12:13,000
not to us, as an organization, of course,

278
0:12:14.833,000 --> 0:12:15,000
but to you, as citizens.

279
0:12:16.769,000 --> 0:12:18,000
And so we're actually here to protect you.

280
0:12:19.225,000 --> 0:12:21,000
They, as social enterprises do,

281
0:12:21.789,000 --> 0:12:22,000
have created a moral and ethical code

282
0:12:23.289,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that they advertise around,

283
0:12:25.658,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and they have very strict recruiting practices.

284
0:12:28.796,000 --> 0:12:29,000
And here you have the types of explanations

285
0:12:30.619,000 --> 0:12:33,000
that they provide for some of their actions.

286
0:12:34.56,000 --> 0:12:35,000
They have actually retained access

287
0:12:36.456,000 --> 0:12:38,000
to the profitable drug trade,

288
0:12:38.756,000 --> 0:12:4,000
but the way they do it is, because they control all of Michoacán,

289
0:12:40.966,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and they control the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas,

290
0:12:43.109,000 --> 0:12:44,000
they leverage that to, for example,

291
0:12:44.911,000 --> 0:12:47,000
trade copper from Michoacán that is legally created

292
0:12:48.468,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and legally extracted

293
0:12:49.868,000 --> 0:12:51,000
with illegal ephedrine from China

294
0:12:51.87,000 --> 0:12:54,000
which is a critical precursor for methamphetamines

295
0:12:55.294,000 --> 0:12:57,000
that they produce, and then they have partnerships

296
0:12:57.694,000 --> 0:12:59,000
with larger organizations like the Sinaloa Federation

297
0:13:00.232,000 --> 0:13:02,000
that place their products in the U.S.

298
0:13:02.922,000 --> 0:13:04,000
Finally, the Sinaloa Federation.

299
0:13:05.593,000 --> 0:13:07,000
When you read about them, you will often read about them

300
0:13:07.791,000 --> 0:13:1,000
with an undertone of reverence and admiration,

301
0:13:11.491,000 --> 0:13:12,000
because they are the most integrated

302
0:13:13.407,000 --> 0:13:15,000
and the largest of all the Mexican organizations,

303
0:13:15.695,000 --> 0:13:18,000
and, many people argue, the world.

304
0:13:19.149,000 --> 0:13:21,000
They started as just sort of a transport organization

305
0:13:22.133,000 --> 0:13:24,000
that specialized in smuggling between the U.S.

306
0:13:24.207,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and the Mexican borders,

307
0:13:26.332,000 --> 0:13:27,000
but now they have grown

308
0:13:27.75,000 --> 0:13:3,000
into a truly integrated multinational

309
0:13:31.176,000 --> 0:13:33,000
that has partnerships in production in the south

310
0:13:33.482,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and partnerships in global distribution

311
0:13:36.495,000 --> 0:13:38,000
across the planet.

312
0:13:38.989,000 --> 0:13:41,000
They have cultivated a brand of professionalism,

313
0:13:42.319,000 --> 0:13:45,000
business acumen and innovation.

314
0:13:45.637,000 --> 0:13:47,000
They have designed new drug products

315
0:13:47.736,000 --> 0:13:48,000
and new drug processes.

316
0:13:49.459,000 --> 0:13:51,000
They have designed narco-tunnels

317
0:13:51.677,000 --> 0:13:52,000
that go across the border,

318
0:13:53.218,000 --> 0:13:54,000
and you can see that these are not

319
0:13:55.033,000 --> 0:13:58,000
"The Shawshank Redemption" types.

320
0:13:58.981,000 --> 0:14:01,000
They have invented narco-submarines and boats

321
0:14:02.677,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that are not detected by radar.

322
0:14:05.36,000 --> 0:14:07,000
They have invented drones to transport drugs,

323
0:14:07.923,000 --> 0:14:1,000
catapults, you name it.

324
0:14:11.209,000 --> 0:14:13,000
One of the leaders of the Sinaloa Federation

325
0:14:13.55,000 --> 0:14:15,000
actually made it to the Forbes list.

326
0:14:15.988,000 --> 0:14:16,000
[#701 Joaquin Guzman Loera]

327
0:14:17.961,000 --> 0:14:19,000
Like any multinational would, they have specialized

328
0:14:20.866,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and focused only in the most profitable part of the business,

329
0:14:23.155,000 --> 0:14:25,000
which is high-margin drugs like cocaine,

330
0:14:25.833,000 --> 0:14:27,000
heroine, methamphetamines.

331
0:14:28.118,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Like any traditional Latin American multinational would,

332
0:14:30.691,000 --> 0:14:31,000
the way they control their operations

333
0:14:32.432,000 --> 0:14:33,000
is through family ties.

334
0:14:34.214,000 --> 0:14:35,000
When they're entering a new market, they send

335
0:14:36.159,000 --> 0:14:37,000
a family member to supervise it,

336
0:14:37.88,000 --> 0:14:39,000
or, if they're partnering with a new organization,

337
0:14:40.697,000 --> 0:14:41,000
they create a family tie,

338
0:14:42.117,000 --> 0:14:46,000
either through marriages or other types of ties.

339
0:14:46.583,000 --> 0:14:48,000
Like any other multinational would,

340
0:14:48.746,000 --> 0:14:51,000
they protect their brand by outsourcing

341
0:14:51.913,000 --> 0:14:53,000
the more questionable parts of the business model,

342
0:14:54.081,000 --> 0:14:56,000
like for example, when they have to engage

343
0:14:56.124,000 --> 0:14:58,000
in violence against other criminal organizations,

344
0:14:58.889,000 --> 0:15:01,000
they recruit gangs and other smaller players

345
0:15:02.334,000 --> 0:15:03,000
to do the dirty work for them,

346
0:15:04.133,000 --> 0:15:05,000
and they try to separate their operations

347
0:15:05.918,000 --> 0:15:08,000
and their violence and be very discrete about this.

348
0:15:09.553,000 --> 0:15:11,000
To further strengthen their brand,

349
0:15:12.049,000 --> 0:15:14,000
they actually have professional P.R. firms

350
0:15:14.942,000 --> 0:15:16,000
that shape how the press talks about them.

351
0:15:17.421,000 --> 0:15:2,000
They have professional videographers on staff.

352
0:15:20.972,000 --> 0:15:22,000
They have incredibly productive ties

353
0:15:23.085,000 --> 0:15:24,000
with the security organizations

354
0:15:24.918,000 --> 0:15:27,000
on both sides of the border.

355
0:15:28.33,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And so, differences aside,

356
0:15:30.931,000 --> 0:15:33,000
what these three organizations share

357
0:15:34.486,000 --> 0:15:37,000
is on the one hand, a very clear understanding

358
0:15:38.126,000 --> 0:15:41,000
that institutions cannot be imposed from the top,

359
0:15:41.21,000 --> 0:15:43,000
but rather they are built from the bottom up

360
0:15:44.15,000 --> 0:15:47,000
one interaction at a time.

361
0:15:47.433,000 --> 0:15:49,000
They have created extremely coherent structures

362
0:15:49.854,000 --> 0:15:51,000
that they use to show the inconsistencies

363
0:15:52.688,000 --> 0:15:56,000
in government policies.

364
0:15:56.715,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And so what I want you to remember from this talk

365
0:15:59.202,000 --> 0:16:,000
are three things.

366
0:16:00.735,000 --> 0:16:03,000
The first one is that drug violence

367
0:16:03.791,000 --> 0:16:04,000
is actually the result

368
0:16:05.668,000 --> 0:16:08,000
of a huge market demand

369
0:16:08.919,000 --> 0:16:11,000
and an institutional setup that forces

370
0:16:12.569,000 --> 0:16:15,000
the servicing of this market to necessitate violence

371
0:16:15.695,000 --> 0:16:19,000
to guarantee delivery routes.

372
0:16:19.74,000 --> 0:16:2,000
The second thing I want you to remember

373
0:16:21.666,000 --> 0:16:22,000
is that these are sophisticated,

374
0:16:23.612,000 --> 0:16:25,000
coherent organizations

375
0:16:26.535,000 --> 0:16:27,000
that are business organizations,

376
0:16:28.493,000 --> 0:16:29,000
and analyzing them and treating them as such

377
0:16:30.412,000 --> 0:16:33,000
is probably a much more useful approach.

378
0:16:33.801,000 --> 0:16:35,000
The third thing I want you to remember

379
0:16:35.937,000 --> 0:16:36,000
is that even though we're more comfortable

380
0:16:37.365,000 --> 0:16:39,000
with this idea of "them,"

381
0:16:39.888,000 --> 0:16:41,000
a set of bad guys separated from us,

382
0:16:42.629,000 --> 0:16:44,000
we are actually accomplices to them,

383
0:16:45.606,000 --> 0:16:47,000
either through our direct consumption

384
0:16:47.995,000 --> 0:16:51,000
or through our acceptance of the inconsistency

385
0:16:52.067,000 --> 0:16:54,000
between our policies of prohibition

386
0:16:54.335,000 --> 0:16:56,000
and our actual behavior of tolerance

387
0:16:57.283,000 --> 0:17:01,000
or even encouragement of consumption.

388
0:17:01.507,000 --> 0:17:05,000
These organizations service, recruit from,

389
0:17:05.527,000 --> 0:17:07,000
and operate within our communities,

390
0:17:07.855,000 --> 0:17:09,000
so necessarily, they are much more integrated

391
0:17:10.273,000 --> 0:17:14,000
within them than we are comfortable acknowledging.

392
0:17:14.743,000 --> 0:17:16,000
And so to me the question is not whether

393
0:17:17.608,000 --> 0:17:2,000
these dynamics will continue the way they have.

394
0:17:20.889,000 --> 0:17:22,000
We see that the nature of this phenomenon

395
0:17:23.654,000 --> 0:17:25,000
guarantees that they will.

396
0:17:26.122,000 --> 0:17:28,000
The question is whether we are willing to continue

397
0:17:29.002,000 --> 0:17:33,000
our support of a failed strategy

398
0:17:33.608,000 --> 0:17:38,000
based on our stubborn, blissful, voluntary ignorance

399
0:17:39.115,000 --> 0:17:43,000
at the cost of the deaths of thousands of our young.

400
0:17:44.076,000 --> 0:17:45,000
Thank you.

401
0:17:45.807,000 --> 0:17:5,000
(Applause)

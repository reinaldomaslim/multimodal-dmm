1
0:00:12.476,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Hi.

2
0:00:14.848,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I've received hate online.

3
0:00:18.373,000 --> 0:00:19,000
A lot of it.

4
0:00:19.563,000 --> 0:00:21,000
And it comes with the territory of my work.

5
0:00:22.227,000 --> 0:00:23,000
I'm a digital creator,

6
0:00:23.806,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I make things specifically for the internet.

7
0:00:27.292,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Like, a few years ago, I made a video series called "Every Single Word"

8
0:00:31.111,000 --> 0:00:33,000
where I edited down popular films

9
0:00:33.253,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to only the words spoken by people of color,

10
0:00:36.125,000 --> 0:00:4,000
as a way to empirically and accessibly talk about the issue of representation

11
0:00:40.493,000 --> 0:00:41,000
in Hollywood.

12
0:00:42.076,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Then, later, as transphobic bathroom bill

13
0:00:45.506,000 --> 0:00:48,000
started gaining media attention around the United States,

14
0:00:49.069,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I hosted and produced an interview series

15
0:00:51.713,000 --> 0:00:53,000
called "Sitting in Bathrooms with Trans People"

16
0:00:54.506,000 --> 0:00:55,000
where I did exactly that.

17
0:00:56.196,000 --> 0:00:57,000
(Laughter)

18
0:00:57.387,000 --> 0:00:58,000
And then --

19
0:00:58.602,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Sure, I'll take applause.

20
0:01:00.093,000 --> 0:01:01,000
(Applause)

21
0:01:02.022,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Thank you.

22
0:01:03.924,000 --> 0:01:06,000
And then, are you familiar with those unboxing videos on YouTube

23
0:01:07.829,000 --> 0:01:1,000
where YouTubers open up the latest electronic gadgets?

24
0:01:11.797,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Great, so I satirized those in a weekly series,

25
0:01:14.815,000 --> 0:01:17,000
where instead I unboxed intangible ideologies

26
0:01:18.292,000 --> 0:01:23,000
like police brutality, masculinity and the mistreatment of Native Americans.

27
0:01:23.742,000 --> 0:01:24,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:25.016,000 --> 0:01:26,000
My work --

29
0:01:26.222,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Thanks.

30
0:01:27.397,000 --> 0:01:28,000
One person applauding, God bless.

31
0:01:29.174,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:31.618,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Mom, hi.

33
0:01:33.332,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:35.364,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So, my work became popular.

35
0:01:38.18,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Very popular.

36
0:01:39.356,000 --> 0:01:42,000
I got millions of views, a ton of great press

37
0:01:42.561,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and a slew of new followers.

38
0:01:44.744,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But the flip side of success on the internet

39
0:01:47.807,000 --> 0:01:48,000
is internet hate.

40
0:01:49.966,000 --> 0:01:5,000
I was called everything.

41
0:01:51.562,000 --> 0:01:56,000
From "beta" to "snowflake" and, of course, the ever-popular "cuck."

42
0:01:57.379,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Don't worry, I will break these terms down for you.

43
0:02:00.058,000 --> 0:02:01,000
(Laughter)

44
0:02:01.252,000 --> 0:02:03,000
So, "beta," for those of you unfamiliar,

45
0:02:03.76,000 --> 0:02:06,000
is shorthand online lingo for "beta male."

46
0:02:07.434,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But let's be real, I wear pearl earrings

47
0:02:09.8,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and my fashion aesthetic is rich-white-woman-running-errands,

48
0:02:13.109,000 --> 0:02:15,000
so I'm not angling to be an alpha.

49
0:02:15.22,000 --> 0:02:17,000
(Applause)

50
0:02:17.807,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Doesn't totally work.

51
0:02:20.128,000 --> 0:02:21,000
(Laughter)

52
0:02:21.281,000 --> 0:02:24,000
Now, "snowflake" is a put-down for people who are sensitive

53
0:02:24.633,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and believe themselves to be unique,

54
0:02:26.688,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and I'm a millennial and an only child, so, duh!

55
0:02:30.474,000 --> 0:02:32,000
(Laughter)

56
0:02:33.006,000 --> 0:02:36,000
But my favorite, favorite, favorite is "cuck."

57
0:02:37.196,000 --> 0:02:39,000
It's a slur, short for "cuckold,"

58
0:02:39.585,000 --> 0:02:41,000
for men who have been cheated on by their wives.

59
0:02:42.339,000 --> 0:02:44,000
But friends, I am so gay,

60
0:02:44.594,000 --> 0:02:47,000
that if I had a wife, I would encourage her to cheat on me.

61
0:02:48.482,000 --> 0:02:5,000
(Laughter)

62
0:02:50.712,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Thank you.

63
0:02:52.514,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Let's take a look at some of this negativity in action.

64
0:02:57.093,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Sometimes it's direct.

65
0:02:58.649,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Like Marcos, who wrote,

66
0:03:00.094,000 --> 0:03:02,000
"You're everything I hate in a human being."

67
0:03:02.823,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Thank you, Marcos.

68
0:03:04.395,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Others are more concise.

69
0:03:06.3,000 --> 0:03:09,000
Like Donovan, who wrote, "gaywad fagggggg."

70
0:03:09.819,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Now, I do need to point out, Donovan is not wrong, OK?

71
0:03:14.506,000 --> 0:03:18,000
In fact, he's right on both counts, so credit where credit is due.

72
0:03:18.585,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Thank you, Donovan.

73
0:03:19.761,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Others write to me with questions, like Brian, who asked,

74
0:03:23.016,000 --> 0:03:27,000
"Were you born a bitch or did you just learn to be one over time?"

75
0:03:27.157,000 --> 0:03:29,000
But my favorite thing about this

76
0:03:29.522,000 --> 0:03:32,000
is that once Brian was done typing, his finger must have slipped

77
0:03:33.252,000 --> 0:03:36,000
because then he sent me the thumbs-up emoji.

78
0:03:36.763,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

79
0:03:38.057,000 --> 0:03:4,000
So, babe, thumbs up to you, too.

80
0:03:41.176,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:43.477,000 --> 0:03:45,000
It's fun to talk about these messages now.

82
0:03:46.474,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Right?

83
0:03:47.649,000 --> 0:03:49,000
And it's cathartic to laugh at them.

84
0:03:50.147,000 --> 0:03:55,000
But I can tell you that it really does not feel good to receive them.

85
0:03:56.683,000 --> 0:03:58,000
At first, I would screenshot their comments

86
0:03:59.254,000 --> 0:04:,000
and make fun of their typos,

87
0:04:00.958,000 --> 0:04:04,000
but this soon felt elitist and ultimately unhelpful.

88
0:04:05.427,000 --> 0:04:08,000
So over time, I developed an unexpected coping mechanism.

89
0:04:09.807,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Because most of these messages I received were through social media,

90
0:04:13.046,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I could often click on the profile picture of the person who sent them

91
0:04:16.59,000 --> 0:04:18,000
and learn everything about them.

92
0:04:19.003,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I could see pictures they were tagged in,

93
0:04:20.995,000 --> 0:04:22,000
posts they'd written, memes they'd shared,

94
0:04:23.154,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and somehow, seeing that it was a human on the other side of the screen

95
0:04:26.998,000 --> 0:04:27,000
made me feel a little better.

96
0:04:28.665,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Not to justify what they wrote, right?

97
0:04:31.498,000 --> 0:04:32,000
But just to provide context.

98
0:04:34.538,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Still, that didn't feel like enough.

99
0:04:37.379,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So, I called some of them --

100
0:04:40.403,000 --> 0:04:42,000
only the ones I felt safe talking to --

101
0:04:42.95,000 --> 0:04:44,000
with a simple opening question:

102
0:04:45.577,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"Why did you write that?"

103
0:04:47.958,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The first person I spoke to was Josh.

104
0:04:50.498,000 --> 0:04:52,000
He had written to tell me that I was a moron,

105
0:04:52.867,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I was a reason this country was dividing itself,

106
0:04:55.355,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and he added at the end that being gay was a sin.

107
0:05:00.079,000 --> 0:05:03,000
I was so nervous for our first conversation.

108
0:05:03.381,000 --> 0:05:04,000
This wasn't a comments section.

109
0:05:05.056,000 --> 0:05:08,000
So I couldn't use tools like muting or blocking.

110
0:05:08.252,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Of course, I guess, I could have hung up on him.

111
0:05:12.157,000 --> 0:05:13,000
But I didn't want to.

112
0:05:13.728,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Because I liked talking to him.

113
0:05:15.964,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Because I liked him.

114
0:05:18.022,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Here's a clip of one of our conversations.

115
0:05:21.458,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Audio) Dylan Marron: Josh, you said

116
0:05:23.244,000 --> 0:05:25,000
you're about to graduate high school, right?

117
0:05:25.633,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Josh: Mmm-hmm.

118
0:05:26.808,000 --> 0:05:27,000
DM: How is high school for you?

119
0:05:28.339,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Josh: Am I allowed to use the H-E-double-hockey-stick word?

120
0:05:31.141,000 --> 0:05:32,000
DM: Oh, yeah. You're allowed to.

121
0:05:32.855,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Josh: It was hell.

122
0:05:34.22,000 --> 0:05:35,000
DM: Really?

123
0:05:35.394,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Josh: And it's still hell right now, even though it's only two weeks left.

124
0:05:38.91,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I'm a little bit bigger -- I don't like to use the word "fat,"

125
0:05:41.913,000 --> 0:05:43,000
but I am a little bit bigger than a lot of my classmates

126
0:05:44.576,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and they seem to judge me before they even got to know me.

127
0:05:48.538,000 --> 0:05:49,000
DM: That's awful.

128
0:05:50.173,000 --> 0:05:52,000
I mean, I also just want to let you know, Josh,

129
0:05:52.593,000 --> 0:05:54,000
I was bullied in high school, too.

130
0:05:57.14,000 --> 0:06:,000
So did our common ground of being bullied in high school

131
0:06:00.49,000 --> 0:06:01,000
erase what he wrote me?

132
0:06:02.585,000 --> 0:06:03,000
No.

133
0:06:03.776,000 --> 0:06:06,000
And did our single phone conversation

134
0:06:06.927,000 --> 0:06:08,000
radically heal a politically divided country

135
0:06:09.832,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and cure systemic injustice?

136
0:06:12.157,000 --> 0:06:14,000
No, absolutely not, right?

137
0:06:15.466,000 --> 0:06:17,000
But did our conversation humanize us to each other

138
0:06:18.355,000 --> 0:06:21,000
more than profile pictures and posts ever could?

139
0:06:21.927,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Absolutely.

140
0:06:23.411,000 --> 0:06:24,000
I didn't stop there.

141
0:06:24.981,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Because some of the hate I received was from "my side."

142
0:06:29.123,000 --> 0:06:32,000
So when Matthew, a queer liberal artist like me

143
0:06:33.07,000 --> 0:06:37,000
publicly wrote that I represented some of the worst aspects of liberalism,

144
0:06:37.85,000 --> 0:06:38,000
I wanted to ask him this.

145
0:06:40.483,000 --> 0:06:41,000
DM: You tagged me in this post.

146
0:06:42.289,000 --> 0:06:43,000
Did you want me to see it?

147
0:06:44.119,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Matthew (Laughing): I honestly didn't think that you would.

148
0:06:46.932,000 --> 0:06:48,000
DM: Have you ever been publicly dragged?

149
0:06:49.87,000 --> 0:06:5,000
Matthew: I have been.

150
0:06:51.056,000 --> 0:06:53,000
And I just said, "No, I don't care."

151
0:06:53.761,000 --> 0:06:54,000
DM: And did you not care?

152
0:06:55.031,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Matthew: But it was hard.

153
0:06:56.277,000 --> 0:06:57,000
DM: Did you not care?

154
0:06:57.507,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Matthew: Oh, I cared, yes.

155
0:07:00.652,000 --> 0:07:01,000
DM: At the end of these conversations,

156
0:07:02.486,000 --> 0:07:04,000
there's often a moment of reflection.

157
0:07:04.986,000 --> 0:07:05,000
A reconsideration.

158
0:07:06.28,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And that's exactly what happened

159
0:07:08.272,000 --> 0:07:1,000
at the end of my call with a guy named Doug

160
0:07:10.442,000 --> 0:07:13,000
who had written that I was a talentless propaganda hack.

161
0:07:14.831,000 --> 0:07:16,000
(Audio) Did the conversation we just had --

162
0:07:16.895,000 --> 0:07:19,000
does it, like, make you feel differently about how you write online?

163
0:07:20.268,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Doug: Yeah! You know, when I said this to you,

164
0:07:22.519,000 --> 0:07:23,000
when I said you were a "talentless hack,"

165
0:07:24.496,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I had never conversed with you in my life, really.

166
0:07:26.857,000 --> 0:07:28,000
I didn't really know anything really about you.

167
0:07:29.095,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And I think that a lot of times,

168
0:07:30.862,000 --> 0:07:32,000
that's what the comment sections really are,

169
0:07:32.947,000 --> 0:07:36,000
it's really a way to get your anger at the world out

170
0:07:37.09,000 --> 0:07:4,000
on random profiles of strangers, pretty much.

171
0:07:40.542,000 --> 0:07:41,000
DM (Laughing): Yeah, right.

172
0:07:42.966,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Doug: But it definitely has made me rethink

173
0:07:45.624,000 --> 0:07:48,000
the way that I interact with people online.

174
0:07:50.934,000 --> 0:07:52,000
DM: So I've collected these conversations and many others

175
0:07:53.815,000 --> 0:07:56,000
for my podcast "Conversations with People Who Hate Me."

176
0:07:57.387,000 --> 0:07:58,000
(Laughter)

177
0:07:59.776,000 --> 0:08:,000
Before I started this project,

178
0:08:01.649,000 --> 0:08:04,000
I thought that the real way to bring about change

179
0:08:04.863,000 --> 0:08:06,000
was to shut down opposing viewpoints

180
0:08:07.784,000 --> 0:08:11,000
through epically worded video essays and comments and posts,

181
0:08:11.927,000 --> 0:08:13,000
but I soon learned those were only cheered on

182
0:08:14.458,000 --> 0:08:16,000
by the people who already agreed with me.

183
0:08:17.355,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Sometimes -- bless you.

184
0:08:18.815,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Sometimes, the most subversive thing you could do --

185
0:08:21.887,000 --> 0:08:22,000
yeah, clap for him.

186
0:08:23.252,000 --> 0:08:25,000
(Laughter)

187
0:08:27.069,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Sometimes, the most subversive thing you could do

188
0:08:29.823,000 --> 0:08:32,000
was to actually speak with the people you disagreed with,

189
0:08:33.363,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and not simply at them.

190
0:08:35.777,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Now in every one of my calls,

191
0:08:37.276,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I always ask my guests to tell me about themselves.

192
0:08:40.96,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And it's their answer to this question that allows me to empathize with them.

193
0:08:45.95,000 --> 0:08:46,000
And empathy, it turns out,

194
0:08:47.528,000 --> 0:08:5,000
is a key ingredient in getting these conversations off the ground,

195
0:08:51.092,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but it can feel very vulnerable

196
0:08:53.457,000 --> 0:08:56,000
to be empathizing with someone you profoundly disagree with.

197
0:08:57.839,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So I established a helpful mantra for myself.

198
0:09:01.3,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Empathy is not endorsement.

199
0:09:04.735,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Empathizing with someone you profoundly disagree with

200
0:09:07.514,000 --> 0:09:1,000
does not suddenly compromise your own deeply held beliefs

201
0:09:11.165,000 --> 0:09:12,000
and endorse theirs.

202
0:09:12.347,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Empathizing with someone who, for example, believes that being gay is a sin

203
0:09:16.696,000 --> 0:09:18,000
doesn't mean that I'm suddenly going to drop everything,

204
0:09:19.387,000 --> 0:09:22,000
pack my bags and grab my one-way ticket to hell, right?

205
0:09:22.775,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It just means that I'm acknowledging

206
0:09:24.792,000 --> 0:09:27,000
the humanity of someone who was raised to think very differently from me.

207
0:09:29.617,000 --> 0:09:31,000
I also want to be super clear about something.

208
0:09:32.109,000 --> 0:09:34,000
This is not a prescription for activism.

209
0:09:35.498,000 --> 0:09:37,000
I understand that some people don't feel safe

210
0:09:37.912,000 --> 0:09:38,000
talking to their detractors

211
0:09:39.284,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and others feel so marginalized

212
0:09:41.307,000 --> 0:09:44,000
that they justifiably don't feel that they have any empathy to give.

213
0:09:45.153,000 --> 0:09:46,000
I totally get that.

214
0:09:46.557,000 --> 0:09:48,000
This is just what I feel well-suited to do.

215
0:09:49.787,000 --> 0:09:51,000
You know, I've reached out to a lot of people for this podcast.

216
0:09:52.794,000 --> 0:09:53,000
And some have politely declined,

217
0:09:54.704,000 --> 0:09:56,000
others have read my message and ignored it,

218
0:09:56.736,000 --> 0:09:59,000
some have blocked me automatically when I sent the invitation

219
0:10:00.156,000 --> 0:10:01,000
and one guy actually agreed to do it

220
0:10:01.966,000 --> 0:10:02,000
and then, five minutes into the call,

221
0:10:03.752,000 --> 0:10:04,000
hung up on me.

222
0:10:05.522,000 --> 0:10:08,000
I'm also aware that this talk will appear on the internet.

223
0:10:09.556,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And with the internet comes comment sections,

224
0:10:11.689,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and with comment sections inevitably comes hate.

225
0:10:15.358,000 --> 0:10:16,000
So as you are watching this talk,

226
0:10:17.365,000 --> 0:10:19,000
you can feel free to call me whatever you'd like.

227
0:10:19.839,000 --> 0:10:24,000
You can call me a "gaywad," a "snowflake," a "cuck," a "beta,"

228
0:10:24.927,000 --> 0:10:26,000
or "everything wrong with liberalism."

229
0:10:27.59,000 --> 0:10:3,000
But just know that if you do, I may ask you to talk.

230
0:10:31.717,000 --> 0:10:34,000
And if you refuse or block me automatically

231
0:10:35.169,000 --> 0:10:37,000
or agree and hang up on me,

232
0:10:37.458,000 --> 0:10:4,000
then maybe, babe, the snowflake is you.

233
0:10:40.778,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Thank you so much.

234
0:10:42,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Applause)

235
0:10:44.08,000 --> 0:10:45,000
(Cheering)

236
0:10:45.46,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Applause)

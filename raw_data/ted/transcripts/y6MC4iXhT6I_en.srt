1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:17,000
In my industry,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
we believe that images can change the world.

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Okay, we're naive, we're bright-eyed and bushy-tailed.

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
The truth is that we know that the

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
images themselves don't change the world,

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
but we're also aware that, since the beginning of photography,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
images have provoked reactions in people,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
and those reactions have caused change to happen.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So let's begin with a group of images.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
I'd be extremely surprised

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
if you didn't recognize many or most of them.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
They're best described as iconic:

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
so iconic, perhaps, they're cliches.

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
In fact, they're so well-known

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that you might even recognize them

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
in a slightly or somewhat different form.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
(Laughter)

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But I think we're looking for something more.

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
We're looking for something more.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
We're looking for images that shine

21
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
an uncompromising light on crucial issues,

22
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
images that transcend borders, that transcend religions,

23
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
images that provoke us

24
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to step up and do something --

25
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in other words, to act.

26
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Well, this image you've all seen.

27
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
It changed our view of the physical world.

28
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before.

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Many people credit

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a lot of the birth of the environmental movement

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
to our seeing the planet like this

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
for the first time --

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
its smallness, its fragility.

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Forty years later, this group, more than most,

35
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
are well aware of the destructive power

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
that our species can wield over our environment.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And at last, we appear to be doing something about it.

38
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
This destructive power takes many different forms.

39
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
For example, these images taken by Brent Stirton

40
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
in the Congo.

41
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
These gorillas were murdered, some would even say crucified,

42
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and unsurprisingly,

43
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
they sparked international outrage.

44
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Most recently,

45
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
we've been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself

46
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
with the recent earthquake in Haiti.

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Well, I think what is far worse

48
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
is man's destructive power over man.

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Samuel Pisar, an Auschwitz survivor, said,

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and I'll quote him,

51
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
"The Holocaust teaches us that nature,

52
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
even in its cruelest moments,

53
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
is benign in comparison with man,

54
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
when he loses his moral compass and his reason."

55
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
There's another kind of crucifixion.

56
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib

57
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
as well as the images from Guantanamo

58
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
had a profound impact.

59
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
The publication of those images,

60
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
as opposed to the images themselves,

61
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
caused a government to change its policies.

62
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Some would argue that it is those images

63
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq

64
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
than virtually any other single act.

65
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Furthermore, those images forever removed

66
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
the so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces.

67
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
Let's go back a little.

68
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
In the 1960s and 1970s,

69
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
the Vietnam War was basically shown

70
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in America's living rooms day in, day out.

71
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
News photos brought people face to face

72
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
with the victims of the war: a little girl burned by napalm,

73
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
a student killed by the National Guard

74
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest.

75
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
In fact, these images became

76
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
the voices of protest themselves.

77
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Now, images have power

78
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
to shed light of understanding

79
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
on suspicion, ignorance,

80
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and in particular -- I've given a lot of talks on this

81
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but I'll just show one image --

82
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
the issue of HIV/AIDS.

83
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
In the 1980s, the stigmatization of people with the disease

84
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
was an enormous barrier

85
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
to even discussing or addressing it.

86
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
A simple act, in 1987, of the most famous woman in the world,

87
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
the Princess of Wales, touching

88
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
an HIV/AIDS infected baby

89
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
did a great deal, especially in Europe, to stop that.

90
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
She, better than most, knew the power of an image.

91
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
So when we are confronted by a powerful image,

92
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
we all have a choice:

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
We can look away, or we can address the image.

94
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Thankfully, when these photos appeared in

95
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The Guardian in 1998,

96
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
they put a lot of focus and attention and, in the end, a lot of money

97
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
towards the Sudan famine relief efforts.

98
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
Did the images change the world?

99
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
No, but they had a major impact.

100
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
Images often push us to question our core beliefs

101
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and our responsibilities to each other.

102
0:04:27.26,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We all saw those images after Katrina,

103
0:04:29.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
and I think for millions of people

104
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
they had a very strong impact.

105
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
And I think it's very unlikely

106
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
that they were far from the minds of Americans

107
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
when they went to vote in November 2008.

108
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
Unfortunately, some very important images

109
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them.

110
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
I'll show you one photo here,

111
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
and it's a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran

112
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
from an extraordinary piece of work,

113
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
which has never been published, called War Is Personal.

114
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
But images don't need to be graphic

115
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
in order to remind us of the tragedy of war.

116
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery.

117
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
After all the tense moments of conflict

118
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
in all the conflict zones of the world,

119
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
there's one photograph from a much quieter place

120
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
that haunts me still, much more than the others.

121
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:2,000
Ansel Adams said, and I'm going to disagree with him,

122
0:05:20.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
"You don't take a photograph, you make it."

123
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
In my view, it's not the photographer who makes the photo,

124
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
it's you.

125
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
We bring to each image

126
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
our own values, our own belief systems,

127
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and as a result of that, the image resonates with us.

128
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
My company has 70 million images.

129
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I have one image in my office.

130
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Here it is.

131
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:43,000
I hope that the next time you see

132
0:05:43.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
an image that sparks something in you,

133
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
you'll better understand why,

134
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and I know that speaking to this audience,

135
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
you'll definitely do something about it.

136
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And thank you to all the photographers.

137
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
(Applause)

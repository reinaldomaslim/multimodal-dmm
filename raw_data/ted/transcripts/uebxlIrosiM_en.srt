2
0:00:16.22,000 --> 0:00:19,000
There are a lot of ways the people around us

3
0:00:19.568,000 --> 0:00:21,000
can help improve our lives.

4
0:00:21.695,000 --> 0:00:22,000
We don't bump into every neighbor,

5
0:00:23.339,000 --> 0:00:26,000
so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on,

6
0:00:26.41,000 --> 0:00:28,000
though we do share the same public spaces.

7
0:00:29.362,000 --> 0:00:31,000
So over the past few years, I've tried ways to share more

8
0:00:32.147,000 --> 0:00:34,000
with my neighbors in public space,

9
0:00:34.487,000 --> 0:00:36,000
using simple tools like stickers, stencils and chalk.

10
0:00:38.058,000 --> 0:00:41,000
And these projects came from questions I had, like:

11
0:00:41.454,000 --> 0:00:43,000
How much are my neighbors paying for their apartments?

12
0:00:44.169,000 --> 0:00:45,000
(Laughter)

13
0:00:45.383,000 --> 0:00:47,000
How can we lend and borrow more things,

14
0:00:47.661,000 --> 0:00:49,000
without knocking on each other's doors at a bad time?

15
0:00:51.978,000 --> 0:00:55,000
How can we share more memories of our abandoned buildings,

16
0:00:56.055,000 --> 0:00:58,000
and gain a better understanding of our landscape?

17
0:00:59.811,000 --> 0:01:03,000
How can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts,

18
0:01:04.153,000 --> 0:01:07,000
so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today?

19
0:01:10.034,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Now, I live in New Orleans,

20
0:01:11.989,000 --> 0:01:13,000
and I am in love with New Orleans.

21
0:01:14.66,000 --> 0:01:18,000
My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees,

22
0:01:19.192,000 --> 0:01:23,000
shading lovers, drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years,

23
0:01:23.588,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and I trust a city that always makes way for music.

24
0:01:26.874,000 --> 0:01:28,000
I feel like every time someone sneezes,

25
0:01:29.316,000 --> 0:01:3,000
New Orleans has a parade.

26
0:01:30.579,000 --> 0:01:31,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:31.888,000 --> 0:01:34,000
The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world,

28
0:01:35.428,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America.

29
0:01:40.062,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I live near this house,

30
0:01:41.514,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood,

31
0:01:45.379,000 --> 0:01:48,000
and I also thought about something that changed my life forever.

32
0:01:51.566,000 --> 0:01:54,000
In 2009, I lost someone I loved very much.

33
0:01:55.93,000 --> 0:01:57,000
Her name was Joan, and she was a mother to me.

34
0:01:59.834,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And her death was sudden and unexpected.

35
0:02:06.424,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And I thought about death a lot.

36
0:02:12.821,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And ... this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I've had.

37
0:02:19.502,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And ... brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now.

38
0:02:29.923,000 --> 0:02:33,000
But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life.

39
0:02:34.724,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I feel like it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day,

40
0:02:37.557,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and forget what really matters to you.

41
0:02:40.24,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So with help from old and new friends,

42
0:02:42.394,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard,

43
0:02:46.272,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and stenciled it with a fill-in-the-blank sentence:

44
0:02:49.203,000 --> 0:02:51,000
"Before I die, I want to ..."

45
0:02:53.723,000 --> 0:02:56,000
So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk,

46
0:02:56.826,000 --> 0:02:57,000
reflect on their life,

47
0:02:58.248,000 --> 0:03:,000
and share their personal aspirations in public space.

48
0:03:02.746,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I didn't know what to expect from this experiment,

49
0:03:05.864,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but by the next day, the wall was entirely filled out,

50
0:03:09.209,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and it kept growing.

51
0:03:11.201,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And I'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall.

52
0:03:17.204,000 --> 0:03:2,000
"Before I die, I want to be tried for piracy."

53
0:03:20.661,000 --> 0:03:26,000
(Laughter)

54
0:03:27.461,000 --> 0:03:31,000
"Before I die, I want to straddle the International Dateline."

55
0:03:33.468,000 --> 0:03:36,000
"Before I die, I want to sing for millions."

56
0:03:38.239,000 --> 0:03:4,000
"Before I die, I want to plant a tree."

57
0:03:43.987,000 --> 0:03:45,000
"Before I die, I want to live off the grid."

58
0:03:48.61,000 --> 0:03:51,000
"Before I die, I want to hold her one more time."

59
0:03:55.039,000 --> 0:03:58,000
"Before I die, I want to be someone's cavalry."

60
0:04:00.825,000 --> 0:04:04,000
"Before I die, I want to be completely myself."

61
0:04:09.231,000 --> 0:04:12,000
So this neglected space became a constructive one,

62
0:04:13.23,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and people's hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud, tear up,

63
0:04:18.126,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and they consoled me during my own tough times.

64
0:04:21.366,000 --> 0:04:23,000
It's about knowing you're not alone;

65
0:04:23.804,000 --> 0:04:26,000
it's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways;

66
0:04:27.51,000 --> 0:04:3,000
it's about making space for reflection and contemplation,

67
0:04:30.883,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change.

68
0:04:37.419,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I made this last year,

69
0:04:38.68,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people

70
0:04:42.099,000 --> 0:04:44,000
who wanted to make a wall with their community.

71
0:04:44.54,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So, my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit,

72
0:04:47.74,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and now walls have been made in countries around the world,

73
0:04:50.582,000 --> 0:04:53,000
including Kazakhstan,

74
0:04:54.019,000 --> 0:04:56,000
South Africa,

75
0:04:56.754,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Australia,

76
0:04:59.23,000 --> 0:05:,000
Argentina, and beyond.

77
0:05:01.689,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Together, we've shown how powerful our public spaces can be

78
0:05:04.595,000 --> 0:05:06,000
if we're given the opportunity to have a voice,

79
0:05:07.32,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and share more with one another.

80
0:05:12.927,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Two of the most valuable things we have

81
0:05:15.063,000 --> 0:05:18,000
are time, and our relationships with other people.

82
0:05:19.522,000 --> 0:05:21,000
In our age of increasing distractions,

83
0:05:22.07,000 --> 0:05:25,000
it's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective,

84
0:05:25.57,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and remember that life is brief and tender.

85
0:05:29.528,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Death is something that we're often discouraged to talk about,

86
0:05:32.592,000 --> 0:05:33,000
or even think about,

87
0:05:33.886,000 --> 0:05:35,000
but I've realized that preparing for death

88
0:05:36.234,000 --> 0:05:38,000
is one of the most empowering things you can do.

89
0:05:39.464,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Thinking about death clarifies your life.

90
0:05:44.971,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us,

91
0:05:47.884,000 --> 0:05:5,000
as individuals and as a community,

92
0:05:51.197,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and with more ways to share our hopes, fears and stories,

93
0:05:55.157,000 --> 0:05:58,000
the people around us can not only help us make better places,

94
0:05:59.101,000 --> 0:06:01,000
they can help us lead better lives.

95
0:06:01.545,000 --> 0:06:02,000
Thank you.

96
0:06:02.721,000 --> 0:06:06,000
(Applause)

97
0:06:07.318,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Thank you.

98
0:06:08.498,000 --> 0:06:13,000
(Applause)

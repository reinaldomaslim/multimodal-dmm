1
0:00:25,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'd like to start tonight by something completely different,

2
0:00:29,000 --> 0:00:33,000
asking you to join me by stepping off the land

3
0:00:33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and jumping into the open ocean for a moment.

4
0:00:38,000 --> 0:00:43,000
90 percent of the living space on the planet is in the open ocean,

5
0:00:43,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and it's where life -- the title of our seminar tonight -- it's where life began.

6
0:00:48,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And it's a lively and a lovely place,

7
0:00:51,000 --> 0:00:55,000
but we're rapidly changing the oceans with our --

8
0:00:55,000 --> 0:01:,000
not only with our overfishing, our irresponsible fishing,

9
0:01:,000 --> 0:01:05,000
our adding of pollutants like fertilizer from our cropland,

10
0:01:05,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but also, most recently, with climate change,

11
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and Steve Schneider, I'm sure, will be going into greater detail on this.

12
0:01:1,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now, as we continue to tinker with the oceans,

13
0:01:13,000 --> 0:01:18,000
more and more reports are predicting that the kinds of seas that we're creating

14
0:01:18,000 --> 0:01:23,000
will be conducive to low-energy type of animals, like jellyfish and bacteria.

15
0:01:23,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And this might be the kind of seas we're headed for.

16
0:01:26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
Now jellyfish are strangely hypnotic and beautiful,

17
0:01:3,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and you'll see lots of gorgeous ones at the aquarium on Friday,

18
0:01:35,000 --> 0:01:4,000
but they sting like hell, and jellyfish sushi and sashimi

19
0:01:4,000 --> 0:01:42,000
is just not going to fill you up.

20
0:01:42,000 --> 0:01:47,000
About 100 grams of jellyfish equals four calories.

21
0:01:47,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So it may be good for the waistline,

22
0:01:49,000 --> 0:01:52,000
but it probably won't keep you satiated for very long.

23
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And a sea that's just filled and teeming with jellyfish

24
0:01:57,000 --> 0:02:,000
isn't very good for all the other creatures that live in the oceans,

25
0:02:,000 --> 0:02:03,000
that is, unless you eat jellyfish.

26
0:02:03,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And this is this voracious predator launching a sneak attack

27
0:02:07,000 --> 0:02:11,000
on this poor little unsuspecting jellyfish there, a by-the-wind sailor.

28
0:02:11,000 --> 0:02:15,000
And that predator is the giant ocean sunfish, the Mola mola,

29
0:02:17,000 --> 0:02:2,000
whose primary prey are jellyfish.

30
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This animal is in "The Guinness World Book of Records"

31
0:02:22,000 --> 0:02:24,000
for being the world's heaviest bony fish.

32
0:02:24,000 --> 0:02:31,000
It reaches up to almost 5,000 pounds -- on a diet of jellyfish, primarily.

33
0:02:31,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And I think it's kind of a nice little cosmological convergence here

34
0:02:35,000 --> 0:02:38,000
that the Mola mola -- its common name is sunfish --

35
0:02:38,000 --> 0:02:42,000
that its favorite food is the moon jelly.

36
0:02:42,000 --> 0:02:46,000
So it's kind of nice, the sun and the moon getting together this way,

37
0:02:46,000 --> 0:02:49,000
even if one is eating the other.

38
0:02:51,000 --> 0:02:54,000
Now this is typically how you see sunfish,

39
0:02:54,000 --> 0:02:56,000
this is where they get their common name.

40
0:02:56,000 --> 0:02:58,000
They like to sunbathe, can't blame them.

41
0:02:58,000 --> 0:03:01,000
They just lay out on the surface of the sea

42
0:03:01,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and most people think they're sick or lazy, but that's a typical behavior,

43
0:03:05,000 --> 0:03:08,000
they lie out and bask on the surface.

44
0:03:08,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Their other name, Mola mola, is -- it sounds Hawaiian,

45
0:03:11,000 --> 0:03:14,000
but it's actually Latin for millstone,

46
0:03:14,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and that's attributable to their roundish, very bizarre, cut-off shape.

47
0:03:2,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's as if, as they were growing, they just forgot the tail part.

48
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:28,000
And that's actually what drew me to the Mola in the first place,

49
0:03:28,000 --> 0:03:3,000
was this terribly bizarre shape.

50
0:03:31,000 --> 0:03:36,000
You know, you look at sharks, and they're streamlined, and they're sleek,

51
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:39,000
and you look at tuna, and they're like torpedoes --

52
0:03:39,000 --> 0:03:43,000
they just give away their agenda. They're about migration and strength,

53
0:03:43,000 --> 0:03:46,000
and then you look at the sunfish.

54
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
(Laughter)

55
0:03:48,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And this is just so elegantly mysterious, it's just --

56
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:59,000
it really kind of holds its cards a lot tighter than say, a tuna.

57
0:04:02,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So I was just intrigued with what -- you know, what is this animal's story?

58
0:04:08,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Well, as with anything in biology, nothing really makes sense

59
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:13,000
except in the light of evolution.

60
0:04:13,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The Mola's no exception.

61
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:18,000
They appeared shortly after the dinosaurs disappeared,

62
0:04:19,000 --> 0:04:23,000
65 million years ago, at a time when whales still had legs,

63
0:04:23,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and they come from a rebellious little puffer fish faction --

64
0:04:29,000 --> 0:04:32,000
oblige me a little Kipling-esque storytelling here.

65
0:04:32,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Of course evolution is somewhat random, and you know,

66
0:04:35,000 --> 0:04:39,000
about 55 million years ago there was this rebellious little puffer fish faction

67
0:04:39,000 --> 0:04:41,000
that said, oh, the heck with the coral reefs --

68
0:04:41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
we're going to head to the high seas.

69
0:04:43,000 --> 0:04:48,000
And lots of generations, lots of tweaking and torquing,

70
0:04:48,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and we turn our puffer into the Mola.

71
0:04:5,000 --> 0:04:56,000
You know, if you give Mother Nature enough time, that is what she will produce.

72
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
They look -- maybe they look

73
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:04,000
kind of prehistoric and unfinished, abridged perhaps,

74
0:05:04,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but in fact, in fact they are the --

75
0:05:08,000 --> 0:05:14,000
they vie for the top position of the most evolutionarily-derived fish in the sea,

76
0:05:14,000 --> 0:05:17,000
right up there with flat fish.

77
0:05:17,000 --> 0:05:21,000
They're -- every single thing about that fish has been changed.

78
0:05:21,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And in terms of fishes --

79
0:05:23,000 --> 0:05:29,000
fishes appeared 500 million years ago, and they're pretty modern,

80
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:31,000
just 50 million years ago, so --

81
0:05:33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
so interestingly, they give away their ancestry as they develop.

82
0:05:38,000 --> 0:05:4,000
They start as little eggs,

83
0:05:4,000 --> 0:05:42,000
and they're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again

84
0:05:42,000 --> 0:05:46,000
for having the most number of eggs of any vertebrate on the planet.

85
0:05:46,000 --> 0:05:52,000
A single four-foot female had 300 million eggs,

86
0:05:52,000 --> 0:05:55,000
can carry 300 million eggs in her ovaries -- imagine --

87
0:05:55,000 --> 0:06:,000
and they get to be over 10 feet long. Imagine what a 10 foot one has.

88
0:06:,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And from that little egg,

89
0:06:02,000 --> 0:06:07,000
they pass through this spiky little porcupine fish stage, reminiscent of their ancestry,

90
0:06:07,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and develop -- this is their little adolescent stage.

91
0:06:1,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They school as adolescents, and become behemoth loners as adults.

92
0:06:17,000 --> 0:06:19,000
That's a little diver up there in the corner.

93
0:06:2,000 --> 0:06:23,000
They're in "The Guinness World Book of Records" again

94
0:06:23,000 --> 0:06:26,000
for being the vertebrate growth champion of the world.

95
0:06:26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
From their little hatching size of their egg, into their little larval stage

96
0:06:3,000 --> 0:06:36,000
till they reach adulthood, they put on 600 million times an increase in weight.

97
0:06:36,000 --> 0:06:42,000
600 million. Now imagine if you gave birth to a little baby,

98
0:06:42,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and you had to feed this thing.

99
0:06:46,000 --> 0:06:51,000
That would mean that your child, you would expect it to gain the weight of six Titanics.

100
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Now I don't know how you'd feed a child like that but --

101
0:06:56,000 --> 0:07:02,000
we don't know how fast the Molas grow in the wild,

102
0:07:02,000 --> 0:07:05,000
but captive growth studies at the Monterey Bay Aquarium --

103
0:07:05,000 --> 0:07:07,000
one of the first places to have them in captivity --

104
0:07:07,000 --> 0:07:11,000
they had one that gained 800 lbs in 14 months.

105
0:07:11,000 --> 0:07:14,000
I said, now, that's a true American.

106
0:07:14,000 --> 0:07:18,000
(Laughter)

107
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Applause)

108
0:07:2,000 --> 0:07:24,000
So being a loner is a great thing, especially in today's seas,

109
0:07:24,000 --> 0:07:27,000
because schooling used to be salvation for fishes,

110
0:07:27,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but it's suicide for fishes now.

111
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:32,000
But unfortunately Molas, even though they don't school,

112
0:07:32,000 --> 0:07:34,000
they still get caught in nets as by-catch.

113
0:07:34,000 --> 0:07:39,000
If we're going to save the world from total jellyfish domination,

114
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:41,000
then we've got to figure out what the jellyfish predators --

115
0:07:41,000 --> 0:07:43,000
how they live their lives, like the Mola.

116
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And unfortunately, they make up a large portion of the California by-catch --

117
0:07:48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
up to 26 percent of the drift net.

118
0:07:5,000 --> 0:07:55,000
And in the Mediterranean, in the swordfish net fisheries,

119
0:07:55,000 --> 0:07:58,000
they make up up to 90 percent.

120
0:07:59,000 --> 0:08:02,000
So we've got to figure out how they're living their lives.

121
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And how do you do that?

122
0:08:04,000 --> 0:08:07,000
How do you do that with an animal -- very few places in the world.

123
0:08:07,000 --> 0:08:11,000
This is an open ocean creature. It knows no boundaries -- it doesn't go to land.

124
0:08:11,000 --> 0:08:13,000
How do you get insight?

125
0:08:13,000 --> 0:08:18,000
How do you seduce an open ocean creature like that to spill its secrets?

126
0:08:18,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Well, there's some great new technology

127
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:23,000
that has just recently become available,

128
0:08:23,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and it's just a boon for getting insight into open ocean animals.

129
0:08:27,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And it's pictured right here, that little tag up there.

130
0:08:31,000 --> 0:08:36,000
That little tag can record temperature, depth and light intensity,

131
0:08:36,000 --> 0:08:4,000
which is correlated with time, and from that we can get locations.

132
0:08:4,000 --> 0:08:44,000
And it can record this data for up to two years,

133
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and keep it in that tag, release at a pre-programmed time,

134
0:08:48,000 --> 0:08:52,000
float to the surface, upload all that data, that whole travelogue,

135
0:08:52,000 --> 0:08:55,000
to satellite, which relays it directly to our computers,

136
0:08:55,000 --> 0:08:59,000
and we've got that whole dataset. And we didn't even have --

137
0:08:59,000 --> 0:09:03,000
we just had to tag the animal and then we went home and you know, sat at our desks.

138
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:06,000
So the great thing about the Mola

139
0:09:06,000 --> 0:09:09,000
is that when we put the tag on them -- if you look up here --

140
0:09:09,000 --> 0:09:11,000
that's streaming off, that's right where we put the tag.

141
0:09:11,000 --> 0:09:15,000
And it just so happens that's a parasite hanging off the Mola.

142
0:09:15,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Molas are infamous for carrying tons of parasites.

143
0:09:18,000 --> 0:09:22,000
They're just parasite hotels; even their parasites have parasites.

144
0:09:22,000 --> 0:09:24,000
I think Donne wrote a poem about that.

145
0:09:24,000 --> 0:09:27,000
But they have 40 genera of parasites,

146
0:09:27,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and so we figured just one more parasite won't be too much of a problem.

147
0:09:31,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And they happen to be a very good vehicle for carrying oceanographic equipment.

148
0:09:36,000 --> 0:09:38,000
They don't seem to mind, so far.

149
0:09:39,000 --> 0:09:43,000
So what are we trying to find out? We're focusing on the Pacific.

150
0:09:43,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We're tagging on the California coast, and we're tagging over in Taiwan and Japan.

151
0:09:47,000 --> 0:09:5,000
And we're interested in how these animals are using the currents,

152
0:09:5,000 --> 0:09:56,000
using temperature, using the open ocean, to live their lives.

153
0:09:56,000 --> 0:09:58,000
We'd love to tag in Monterey.

154
0:09:58,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Monterey is one of the few places in the world where Molas come in large numbers.

155
0:10:02,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Not this time of year -- it's more around October.

156
0:10:05,000 --> 0:10:08,000
And we'd love to tag here -- this is an aerial shot of Monterey --

157
0:10:08,000 --> 0:10:12,000
but unfortunately, the Molas here end up looking like this

158
0:10:12,000 --> 0:10:16,000
because another one of our locals really likes Molas but in the wrong way.

159
0:10:16,000 --> 0:10:2,000
The California sea lion takes the Molas as soon as they come into the bay,

160
0:10:2,000 --> 0:10:25,000
rips off their fins, fashions them into the ultimate Frisbee, Mola style,

161
0:10:25,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and then tosses them back and forth.

162
0:10:27,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And I'm not exaggerating, it is just --

163
0:10:3,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and sometimes they don't eat them, it's just spiteful.

164
0:10:33,000 --> 0:10:38,000
And you know, the locals think it's terrible behavior,

165
0:10:38,000 --> 0:10:43,000
it's just horrible watching this happen, day after day.

166
0:10:43,000 --> 0:10:46,000
The poor little Molas coming in, getting ripped to shreds,

167
0:10:46,000 --> 0:10:5,000
so we head down south, to San Diego.

168
0:10:5,000 --> 0:10:52,000
Not so many California sea lions down there.

169
0:10:52,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And the Molas there, you can find them with a spotter plane very easily,

170
0:10:55,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and they like to hang out under floating rafts of kelp.

171
0:10:58,000 --> 0:11:01,000
And under those kelps -- this is why the Molas come there

172
0:11:01,000 --> 0:11:05,000
because it's spa time for the Molas there.

173
0:11:05,000 --> 0:11:09,000
As soon as they get under those rafts of kelp, the exfoliating cleaner fish come.

174
0:11:09,000 --> 0:11:11,000
And they come and give the Molas --

175
0:11:11,000 --> 0:11:14,000
you can see they strike this funny little position that says,

176
0:11:14,000 --> 0:11:16,000
"I'm not threatening, but I need a massage."

177
0:11:16,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Laughter)

178
0:11:2,000 --> 0:11:24,000
And they'll put their fins out and their eyes go in the back of their head,

179
0:11:24,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and the fish come up and they just clean, clean, clean --

180
0:11:28,000 --> 0:11:32,000
because the Molas, you know, there's just a smorgasbord of parasites.

181
0:11:32,000 --> 0:11:34,000
And it's also a great place to go down south

182
0:11:34,000 --> 0:11:38,000
because the water's warmer, and the Molas are kind of friendly down there.

183
0:11:38,000 --> 0:11:41,000
I mean what other kind of fish, if you approach it right,

184
0:11:41,000 --> 0:11:43,000
will say, "Okay, scratch me right there."

185
0:11:43,000 --> 0:11:46,000
You truly can swim up to a Mola -- they're very gentle --

186
0:11:46,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and if you approach them right, you can give them a scratch and they enjoy it.

187
0:11:52,000 --> 0:11:54,000
So we've also tagged one part of the Pacific;

188
0:11:54,000 --> 0:11:56,000
we've gone over to another part of the Pacific,

189
0:11:56,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and we've tagged in Taiwan, and we tagged in Japan.

190
0:12:,000 --> 0:12:05,000
And over in these places, the Molas are caught in set nets that line these countries.

191
0:12:05,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And they're not thrown back as by-catch, they're eaten.

192
0:12:08,000 --> 0:12:12,000
We were served a nine-course meal of Mola after we tagged.

193
0:12:13,000 --> 0:12:15,000
Well, not the one we tagged!

194
0:12:16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
And everything from the kidney, to the testes, to the back bone,

195
0:12:19,000 --> 0:12:26,000
to the fin muscle to -- I think that ís pretty much the whole fish -- is eaten.

196
0:12:32,000 --> 0:12:36,000
So the hardest part of tagging, now, is

197
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:41,000
after you put that tag on, you have to wait, months.

198
0:12:41,000 --> 0:12:45,000
And you're just wondering, oh, I hope the fish is safe,

199
0:12:45,000 --> 0:12:49,000
I hope, I hope it's going to be able to actually live its life out

200
0:12:49,000 --> 0:12:52,000
during the course that the tag is recording.

201
0:12:52,000 --> 0:12:58,000
The tags cost 3500 dollars each, and then satellite time is another 500 dollars,

202
0:12:58,000 --> 0:13:01,000
so you're like, oh, I hope the tag is okay.

203
0:13:01,000 --> 0:13:04,000
And so the waiting is really the hardest part.

204
0:13:04,000 --> 0:13:06,000
I'm going to show you our latest dataset.

205
0:13:06,000 --> 0:13:11,000
And it hasn't been published, so it's totally privy information just for TED.

206
0:13:11,000 --> 0:13:15,000
And in showing you this, you know, when we're looking at this data,

207
0:13:15,000 --> 0:13:18,000
we're thinking, oh do these animals, do they cross the equator?

208
0:13:18,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Do they go from one side of the Pacific to the other?

209
0:13:2,000 --> 0:13:24,000
And we found that they kind of are homebodies.

210
0:13:25,000 --> 0:13:27,000
They're not big migrators. This is their track:

211
0:13:27,000 --> 0:13:31,000
we deployed the tag off of Tokyo, and the Mola in one month

212
0:13:31,000 --> 0:13:36,000
kind of got into the Kuroshio Current off of Japan and foraged there.

213
0:13:36,000 --> 0:13:4,000
And after four months, went up, you know, off of the north part of Japan.

214
0:13:4,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And that's kind of their home range.

215
0:13:42,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Now that's important, though, because if there's a lot of fishing pressure,

216
0:13:46,000 --> 0:13:49,000
that population doesn't get replenished.

217
0:13:49,000 --> 0:13:51,000
So that's a very important piece of data.

218
0:13:51,000 --> 0:13:57,000
But also what's important is that they're not slacker, lazy fish.

219
0:13:57,000 --> 0:13:59,000
They're super industrious.

220
0:13:59,000 --> 0:14:02,000
And this is a day in the life of a Mola, and if we --

221
0:14:02,000 --> 0:14:06,000
they're up and down, and up and down, and up and down, and up

222
0:14:06,000 --> 0:14:08,000
and up and down, up to 40 times a day.

223
0:14:08,000 --> 0:14:13,000
As the sun comes up, you see in the blue, they start their dive.

224
0:14:13,000 --> 0:14:17,000
Down -- and as the sun gets brighter they go a little deeper, little deeper.

225
0:14:17,000 --> 0:14:23,000
They plumb the depths down to 600 meters, in temperatures to one degree centigrade,

226
0:14:23,000 --> 0:14:27,000
and this is why you see them on the surface -- it's so cold down there.

227
0:14:27,000 --> 0:14:29,000
They've got to come up, warm, get that solar power,

228
0:14:29,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and then plunge back into the depths, and go up and down and up and down.

229
0:14:32,000 --> 0:14:35,000
And they're hitting a layer down there; it's called the deep scattering layer --

230
0:14:35,000 --> 0:14:4,000
which a whole variety of food's in that layer.

231
0:14:4,000 --> 0:14:44,000
So rather than just being some sunbathing slacker,

232
0:14:44,000 --> 0:14:47,000
they're really very industrious fish that dance this wild dance

233
0:14:47,000 --> 0:14:52,000
between the surface and the bottom and through temperature.

234
0:14:52,000 --> 0:14:55,000
We see the same pattern -- now with these tags

235
0:14:55,000 --> 0:14:59,000
we're seeing a similar pattern for swordfishes, manta rays, tunas,

236
0:14:59,000 --> 0:15:02,000
a real three-dimensional play.

237
0:15:04,000 --> 0:15:07,000
This is part of a much larger program called the Census of Marine Life,

238
0:15:07,000 --> 0:15:1,000
where they're going to be tagging all over the world

239
0:15:1,000 --> 0:15:12,000
and the Mola's going to enter into that.

240
0:15:12,000 --> 0:15:15,000
And what's exciting -- you all travel, and you know

241
0:15:15,000 --> 0:15:18,000
the best thing about traveling is to be able to find the locals,

242
0:15:18,000 --> 0:15:21,000
and to find the great places by getting the local knowledge.

243
0:15:21,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Well now with the Census of Marine Life, we'll be able to sidle up to all the locals

244
0:15:25,000 --> 0:15:3,000
and explore 90 percent of our living space, with local knowledge.

245
0:15:3,000 --> 0:15:36,000
It's never -- it's really never been a more exciting, or a vital time, to be a biologist.

246
0:15:36,000 --> 0:15:4,000
Which brings me to my last point, and what I think is kind of the most fun.

247
0:15:4,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I set up a website because I was getting so many questions about Molas and sunfish.

248
0:15:48,000 --> 0:15:52,000
And so I just figured I'd have the questions answered,

249
0:15:52,000 --> 0:15:56,000
and I'd be able to thank my funders, like National Geographic and Lindbergh.

250
0:15:56,000 --> 0:16:,000
But people would write into the site with all sorts of,

251
0:16:,000 --> 0:16:03,000
all sorts of stories about these animals

252
0:16:03,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and wanting to help me get samples for genetic analysis.

253
0:16:07,000 --> 0:16:14,000
And what I found most exciting is that everyone had a shared --

254
0:16:14,000 --> 0:16:17,000
a shared love and an interest in the oceans.

255
0:16:17,000 --> 0:16:21,000
I was getting reports from Catholic nuns,

256
0:16:21,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Jewish Rabbis, Muslims, Christians -- everybody writing in,

257
0:16:26,000 --> 0:16:3,000
united by their love of life.

258
0:16:3,000 --> 0:16:36,000
And to me that -- I don't think I could say it any better than the immortal Bard himself:

259
0:16:36,000 --> 0:16:4,000
"One touch of nature makes the whole world kin."

260
0:16:4,000 --> 0:16:44,000
And sure, it may be just one big old silly fish, but it's helping.

261
0:16:44,000 --> 0:16:48,000
If it's helping to unite the world, I think it's definitely the fish of the future.

1
0:00:14.04,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Vanessa Garrison: I am Vanessa,

2
0:00:15.8,000 --> 0:00:16,000
daughter of Annette,

3
0:00:17.44,000 --> 0:00:18,000
daughter of Olympia,

4
0:00:19.24,000 --> 0:00:2,000
daughter of Melvina,

5
0:00:20.8,000 --> 0:00:23,000
daughter of Katie, born 1878,

6
0:00:24.12,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Parish County, Louisiana.

7
0:00:26.6,000 --> 0:00:27,000
T. Morgan Dixon: And my name is Morgan,

8
0:00:28.52,000 --> 0:00:3,000
daughter of Carol, daughter of Letha, daughter of Willie,

9
0:00:31.28,000 --> 0:00:35,000
daughter of Sarah, born 1849 in Bardstown, Kentucky.

10
0:00:35.68,000 --> 0:00:37,000
VG: And in the tradition of our families,

11
0:00:37.72,000 --> 0:00:4,000
the great oral tradition of almost every Black church we know

12
0:00:41.04,000 --> 0:00:44,000
honoring the culture from which we draw so much power,

13
0:00:44.96,000 --> 0:00:47,000
we're gonna start the way our mommas and grandmas would want us to start.

14
0:00:48.44,000 --> 0:00:5,000
TMD: In prayer. Let the words of my mouth,

15
0:00:51.12,000 --> 0:00:54,000
the meditation of our hearts, be acceptable in thy sight,

16
0:00:54.28,000 --> 0:00:56,000
oh Lord, my strength and my redeemer.

17
0:00:58,000 --> 0:01:02,000
VG: We call the names and rituals of our ancestors into this room today

18
0:01:02.52,000 --> 0:01:06,000
because from them we received a powerful blueprint for survival,

19
0:01:07,000 --> 0:01:11,000
strategies and tactics for healing carried across oceans by African women,

20
0:01:11.6,000 --> 0:01:14,000
passed down to generations of Black women in America

21
0:01:14.96,000 --> 0:01:18,000
who used those skills to navigate institutions of slavery

22
0:01:19.32,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and state-sponsored discrimination

23
0:01:21.24,000 --> 0:01:24,000
in order that we might stand on this stage.

24
0:01:24.56,000 --> 0:01:26,000
We walk in the footsteps of those women,

25
0:01:27.32,000 --> 0:01:29,000
our foremothers, legends

26
0:01:29.64,000 --> 0:01:32,000
like Ella Baker, Septima Clark, Fannie Lou Hamer,

27
0:01:33.6,000 --> 0:01:35,000
from whom we learned the power of organizing

28
0:01:36.52,000 --> 0:01:38,000
after she would had single-handedly registered

29
0:01:39.48,000 --> 0:01:42,000
60,000 voters in Jim Crow Mississippi.

30
0:01:43.68,000 --> 0:01:46,000
TMD: 60,000 is a lot of people, so if you can imagine

31
0:01:47.36,000 --> 0:01:51,000
me and Vanessa inspiring 60,000 women to walk with us last year,

32
0:01:51.84,000 --> 0:01:52,000
we were fired up.

33
0:01:53.84,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But today, 100,000 Black women and girls stand on this stage with us.

34
0:01:59.8,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We are committed to healing ourselves,

35
0:02:02.48,000 --> 0:02:04,000
to lacing up our sneakers, to walking out of our front door

36
0:02:05.28,000 --> 0:02:08,000
every single day for total healing and transformation in our communities,

37
0:02:08.84,000 --> 0:02:09,000
because we understand

38
0:02:10.48,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that we are in the footsteps of a civil rights legacy

39
0:02:13,000 --> 0:02:15,000
like no other time before,

40
0:02:15.12,000 --> 0:02:17,000
and that we are facing a health crisis like never ever before.

41
0:02:18.08,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And so we've had a lot of moments, great moments,

42
0:02:21.12,000 --> 0:02:24,000
including the time we had on our pajamas, we were working on our computer

43
0:02:24.6,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and Michelle Obama emailed us and invited us to the White House,

44
0:02:27.68,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and we thought it was spam.

45
0:02:29.08,000 --> 0:02:32,000
But this moment here is an opportunity.

46
0:02:32.52,000 --> 0:02:34,000
It is an opportunity that we don't take for granted,

47
0:02:35.28,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and so we thought long and hard about how we would use it.

48
0:02:38.04,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Would we talk to the women we hope to inspire,

49
0:02:40.76,000 --> 0:02:41,000
a million in the next year,

50
0:02:42.52,000 --> 0:02:43,000
or would we talk to you?

51
0:02:44.96,000 --> 0:02:45,000
We decided to talk to you,

52
0:02:47.24,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and to talk to you about a question that we get all the time,

53
0:02:51.84,000 --> 0:02:53,000
so that the millions of women who hopefully will watch this

54
0:02:54.68,000 --> 0:02:55,000
will never have to answer it again.

55
0:02:57.08,000 --> 0:03:,000
It is: Why are Black women dying

56
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
faster and at higher rates

57
0:03:02.12,000 --> 0:03:04,000
than any other group of people in America

58
0:03:04.6,000 --> 0:03:07,000
from preventable, obesity-related diseases?

59
0:03:08.76,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The question hurts me.

60
0:03:10.2,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I'm shaking a little bit.

61
0:03:11.64,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It feels value-laden.

62
0:03:13.32,000 --> 0:03:15,000
It hurts my body because the weight represents so much.

63
0:03:17.28,000 --> 0:03:18,000
But we're going to talk about it

64
0:03:18.88,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and invite you into an inside conversation today

65
0:03:21.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
because it is necessary, and because we need you.

66
0:03:26.12,000 --> 0:03:28,000
VG: Each night, before the first day of school,

67
0:03:28.36,000 --> 0:03:3,000
my grandmother would sit me next to the stove

68
0:03:31.04,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and with expert precision use a hot comb to press my hair.

69
0:03:34.88,000 --> 0:03:37,000
My grandmother was legendary, big, loud.

70
0:03:38.4,000 --> 0:03:4,000
She filled up a room with laughter and oftentimes curse words.

71
0:03:41.36,000 --> 0:03:42,000
She cooked a mean peach cobbler,

72
0:03:43.36,000 --> 0:03:45,000
had 11 children, a house full of grandchildren,

73
0:03:45.92,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and like every Black woman I know,

74
0:03:48.4,000 --> 0:03:49,000
like most all women I know,

75
0:03:50.16,000 --> 0:03:54,000
she had prioritized the care of others over caring for herself.

76
0:03:54.52,000 --> 0:03:57,000
We measured her strength by her capacity to endure pain and suffering.

77
0:03:58.28,000 --> 0:04:01,000
We celebrated her for it, and our choice would prove to be deadly.

78
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
One night after pressing my hair before the first day of eighth grade,

79
0:04:05.52,000 --> 0:04:07,000
my grandmother went to bed and never woke up,

80
0:04:08.36,000 --> 0:04:11,000
dead at 66 years old from a heart attack.

81
0:04:11.72,000 --> 0:04:12,000
By the time I would graduate college,

82
0:04:13.6,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I would lose two more beloved family members to chronic disease:

83
0:04:17.12,000 --> 0:04:21,000
my aunt Diane, dead at 55, my aunt Tricia, dead at 63.

84
0:04:21.48,000 --> 0:04:23,000
After living with these losses, the hole that they left,

85
0:04:24.32,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I decided to calculate the life expectancy of the women in my family.

86
0:04:28.839,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Staring back at me, the number 65.

87
0:04:32.32,000 --> 0:04:33,000
I knew I could not sit by

88
0:04:33.92,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and watch another woman I loved die an early death.

89
0:04:38.16,000 --> 0:04:4,000
TMD: So we don't usually put our business in the streets.

90
0:04:40.88,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Let's just put that out there.

91
0:04:42.36,000 --> 0:04:43,000
But I have to tell you the statistics.

92
0:04:44.32,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Black women are dying at alarming rates,

93
0:04:47.12,000 --> 0:04:48,000
and I used to be a classroom teacher,

94
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and I was at South Atlanta High School,

95
0:04:50.92,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and I remember standing in front of my classroom,

96
0:04:53.28,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and I remember a statistic that half of Black girls will get diabetes

97
0:04:58,000 --> 0:05:,000
unless diet and levels of activity change.

98
0:05:00.8,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Half of the girls in my classroom. So I couldn't teach anymore.

99
0:05:04.36,000 --> 0:05:07,000
So I started taking girls hiking, which is why we're called GirlTrek,

100
0:05:07.64,000 --> 0:05:08,000
but Vanessa was like,

101
0:05:08.88,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that is not going to move the dial on the health crisis; it's cute.

102
0:05:12.08,000 --> 0:05:13,000
She was like, it's a cute hiking club.

103
0:05:13.96,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So what we thought

104
0:05:15.64,000 --> 0:05:18,000
is if we could rally a million of their mothers ...

105
0:05:20.96,000 --> 0:05:22,000
82 percent of Black women are over a healthy weight right now.

106
0:05:24.32,000 --> 0:05:27,000
53 percent of us are obese.

107
0:05:29,000 --> 0:05:3,000
But the number that I cannot,

108
0:05:31.84,000 --> 0:05:32,000
that I cannot get out of my head

109
0:05:33.44,000 --> 0:05:36,000
is that every single day in America,

110
0:05:36.84,000 --> 0:05:38,000
137 Black women

111
0:05:39.4,000 --> 0:05:41,000
die from a preventable disease,

112
0:05:41.52,000 --> 0:05:42,000
heart disease.

113
0:05:42.76,000 --> 0:05:43,000
That's every 11 minutes.

114
0:05:44.92,000 --> 0:05:47,000
137 is more than gun violence,

115
0:05:48.16,000 --> 0:05:51,000
cigarette smoking and HIV combined,

116
0:05:51.68,000 --> 0:05:52,000
every day.

117
0:05:53.04,000 --> 0:05:54,000
It is roughly the amount of people

118
0:05:54.72,000 --> 0:05:56,000
that were on my plane from New Jersey to Vancouver.

119
0:05:57.64,000 --> 0:05:58,000
Can you imagine that?

120
0:05:58.88,000 --> 0:06:02,000
A plane filled with Black women crashing to the ground every day,

121
0:06:03.36,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and no one is talking about it.

122
0:06:06.6,000 --> 0:06:09,000
VG: So the question that you're all asking yourselves right now is why?

123
0:06:09.96,000 --> 0:06:12,000
Why are Black women dying? We asked ourselves that same question.

124
0:06:13.08,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Why is what's out there not working for them?

125
0:06:15.52,000 --> 0:06:17,000
Private weight loss companies, government interventions,

126
0:06:18.2,000 --> 0:06:19,000
public health campaigns.

127
0:06:19.56,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I'm going to tell you why:

128
0:06:21.04,000 --> 0:06:22,000
because they focus on weight loss

129
0:06:22.68,000 --> 0:06:23,000
or looking good in skinny jeans

130
0:06:24.2,000 --> 0:06:26,000
without acknowledging the trauma

131
0:06:26.24,000 --> 0:06:28,000
that Black women hold in our bellies and bones,

132
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:31,000
that has been embedded in our very DNA.

133
0:06:32,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The best advice from hospitals and doctors,

134
0:06:34.36,000 --> 0:06:36,000
the best medications from pharmaceutical companies

135
0:06:36.88,000 --> 0:06:39,000
to treat the congestive heart failure of my grandmother didn't work

136
0:06:40.28,000 --> 0:06:42,000
because they didn't acknowledge the systemic racism

137
0:06:42.92,000 --> 0:06:43,000
that she had dealt with since birth.

138
0:06:44.68,000 --> 0:06:45,000
(Applause)

139
0:06:45.72,000 --> 0:06:48,000
A divestment in schools, discriminatory housing practices,

140
0:06:49.08,000 --> 0:06:52,000
predatory lending, a crack cocaine epidemic,

141
0:06:52.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
mass incarceration putting more Black bodies behind bars

142
0:06:55.56,000 --> 0:06:57,000
than were owned at the height of slavery.

143
0:06:57.8,000 --> 0:06:58,000
But GirlTrek does.

144
0:06:59.6,000 --> 0:07:01,000
For Black women whose bodies are buckling under the weight

145
0:07:02.36,000 --> 0:07:04,000
of systems never designed to support them,

146
0:07:05.08,000 --> 0:07:07,000
GirlTrek is a lifeline.

147
0:07:07.16,000 --> 0:07:11,000
August 16, 2015, Danita Kimball, a member of GirlTrek in Detroit,

148
0:07:11.76,000 --> 0:07:14,000
received the news that too many Black mothers have received.

149
0:07:15.04,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Her son Norman, 23 years old, a father of two,

150
0:07:18.44,000 --> 0:07:2,000
was gunned down while on an afternoon drive.

151
0:07:21.44,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Imagine the grief

152
0:07:23.16,000 --> 0:07:25,000
that overcomes your body in that moment,

153
0:07:25.6,000 --> 0:07:26,000
the immobilizing fear.

154
0:07:27.92,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Now, know this, that just days after laying her son to rest,

155
0:07:31.44,000 --> 0:07:32,000
Danita Kimball posted online,

156
0:07:33.2,000 --> 0:07:35,000
"I don't know what to do or how to move forward,

157
0:07:35.96,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but my sisters keep telling me I need to walk, so I will."

158
0:07:39,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And then just days after that,

159
0:07:41.56,000 --> 0:07:43,000
"I got my steps in today for my baby Norm.

160
0:07:43.84,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It felt good to be out there, to walk."

161
0:07:48.48,000 --> 0:07:5,000
TMD: Walking through pain is what we have always done.

162
0:07:51.04,000 --> 0:07:53,000
My mom, she's in the middle right there,

163
0:07:54.24,000 --> 0:07:57,000
my mom desegregated her high school in 1955.

164
0:07:57.6,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Her mom walked down the steps of an abandoned school bus

165
0:08:00.36,000 --> 0:08:02,000
where she raised 11 kids as a sharecropper.

166
0:08:03.28,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And her mom stepped onto Indian territory

167
0:08:05.48,000 --> 0:08:07,000
fleeing the terrors of the Jim Crow South.

168
0:08:08.16,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And her mom walked her man to the door

169
0:08:11.16,000 --> 0:08:13,000
as he went off to fight in the Kentucky Colored Regiment,

170
0:08:14.64,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the Civil War.

171
0:08:16.36,000 --> 0:08:18,000
They were born slaves but they wouldn't die slaves.

172
0:08:18.8,000 --> 0:08:19,000
Change-making, it's in my blood.

173
0:08:20.72,000 --> 0:08:21,000
It's what I do,

174
0:08:22,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and this health crisis ain't nothing compared to the road we have traveled.

175
0:08:27.96,000 --> 0:08:29,000
(Applause)

176
0:08:32.92,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So it's like James Cleveland.

177
0:08:34.36,000 --> 0:08:36,000
I don't feel no ways tired, so we got to work.

178
0:08:36.92,000 --> 0:08:38,000
We started looking at models of change.

179
0:08:39,000 --> 0:08:4,000
We looked all over the world.

180
0:08:40.44,000 --> 0:08:41,000
We needed something

181
0:08:41.68,000 --> 0:08:44,000
not only that was a part of our cultural inheritance like walking,

182
0:08:44.84,000 --> 0:08:47,000
but something that was scalable, something that was high-impact,

183
0:08:47.919,000 --> 0:08:49,000
something that we could replicate across this country.

184
0:08:50.52,000 --> 0:08:53,000
So we studied models like Wangari Maathai, who won the Nobel Peace Prize

185
0:08:53.96,000 --> 0:08:55,000
for inspiring women to plant 50 million trees in Kenya.

186
0:08:56.6,000 --> 0:08:59,000
She brought Kenya back from the brink of environmental devastation.

187
0:08:59.8,000 --> 0:09:03,000
We studied these systems of change, and we looked at walking scientifically.

188
0:09:04.2,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And what we learned is that walking just 30 minutes a day

189
0:09:07.28,000 --> 0:09:12,000
can single-handedly decrease 50 percent of your risk of diabetes,

190
0:09:12.56,000 --> 0:09:15,000
heart disease, stroke, even Alzheimer's and dementia.

191
0:09:16.6,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We know that walking is the single most powerful thing

192
0:09:20.64,000 --> 0:09:22,000
that a woman can do for her health,

193
0:09:22.8,000 --> 0:09:23,000
so we knew we were on to something,

194
0:09:24.6,000 --> 0:09:26,000
because from Harriet Tubman to the women in Montgomery,

195
0:09:27.24,000 --> 0:09:28,000
when Black women walk, things change.

196
0:09:29.08,000 --> 0:09:3,000
(Applause)

197
0:09:30.12,000 --> 0:09:32,000
VG: So how did we take this simple idea of walking

198
0:09:32.68,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and start a revolution that would catch a fire

199
0:09:34.88,000 --> 0:09:35,000
in neighborhoods across America?

200
0:09:36.84,000 --> 0:09:38,000
We used the best practices of the Civil Rights Movement.

201
0:09:39.76,000 --> 0:09:4,000
We huddled up in church basements.

202
0:09:41.44,000 --> 0:09:43,000
We did grapevine information sharing through beauty salons.

203
0:09:44.36,000 --> 0:09:46,000
We empowered and trained mothers to stand on the front lines.

204
0:09:47.28,000 --> 0:09:49,000
We took our message directly to the streets,

205
0:09:49.8,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and women responded.

206
0:09:51.24,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Women like LaKeisha in Chattanooga,

207
0:09:53.6,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Chrysantha in Detroit,

208
0:09:55.84,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Onika in New Orleans,

209
0:09:57.4,000 --> 0:09:59,000
women with difficult names and difficult stories

210
0:10:00.36,000 --> 0:10:04,000
join GirlTrek every day and commit to walking as a practice of self-care.

211
0:10:05.28,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Once walking, those women get to organizing,

212
0:10:07.76,000 --> 0:10:09,000
first their families, then their communities,

213
0:10:09.92,000 --> 0:10:11,000
to walk and talk and solve problems together.

214
0:10:12.76,000 --> 0:10:14,000
They walk and notice the abandoned building.

215
0:10:14.88,000 --> 0:10:16,000
They walk and notice the lack of sidewalks,

216
0:10:16.92,000 --> 0:10:17,000
the lack of green space,

217
0:10:18.2,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and they say, "No more."

218
0:10:19.48,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Women like Susie Paige in Philadelphia,

219
0:10:21.4,000 --> 0:10:24,000
who after walking daily past an abandoned building in her neighborhood,

220
0:10:24.92,000 --> 0:10:25,000
decided, "I'm not waiting.

221
0:10:26.4,000 --> 0:10:28,000
Let me rally my team. Let me grab some supplies.

222
0:10:28.76,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Let me do what no one else has done for me and my community."

223
0:10:33.72,000 --> 0:10:35,000
TMD: We know one woman can make a difference,

224
0:10:35.88,000 --> 0:10:37,000
because one woman has already changed the world,

225
0:10:38.16,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and her name is Harriet Tubman.

226
0:10:39.72,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And trust me, I love Harriet Tubman.

227
0:10:42.12,000 --> 0:10:44,000
I'm obsessed with her, and I used to be a history teacher.

228
0:10:44.88,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I will not tell you the whole history.

229
0:10:46.76,000 --> 0:10:47,000
I will tell you four things.

230
0:10:48.16,000 --> 0:10:5,000
So I used to have an old Saab --

231
0:10:50.2,000 --> 0:10:52,000
the kind of canvas top that drips on your head when it rains --

232
0:10:53.2,000 --> 0:10:55,000
and I drove all the way down to the eastern shore of Maryland,

233
0:10:56.129,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and when I stepped on the dirt

234
0:10:57.6,000 --> 0:10:59,000
that Harriet Tubman made her first escape,

235
0:11:00.56,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I knew she was a woman just like we are

236
0:11:02.68,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and that we could do what she had done,

237
0:11:04.6,000 --> 0:11:06,000
and we learned four things from Harriet Tubman.

238
0:11:06.92,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The first one: do not wait.

239
0:11:09.72,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Walk right now in the direction of your healthiest, most fulfilled life,

240
0:11:14.24,000 --> 0:11:16,000
because self-care is a revolutionary act.

241
0:11:17,000 --> 0:11:18,000
Number two:

242
0:11:18.36,000 --> 0:11:21,000
when you learn the way forward, come back and get a sister.

243
0:11:21.6,000 --> 0:11:23,000
So in our case, start a team with your friends --

244
0:11:23.96,000 --> 0:11:24,000
your friends, your family, your church.

245
0:11:25.88,000 --> 0:11:26,000
Number three:

246
0:11:27.52,000 --> 0:11:29,000
rally your allies.

247
0:11:31,000 --> 0:11:33,000
Every single person in this room

248
0:11:33.88,000 --> 0:11:36,000
is complicit in a Tubman-inspired takeover.

249
0:11:37,000 --> 0:11:38,000
And number four:

250
0:11:38.88,000 --> 0:11:39,000
find joy.

251
0:11:40.92,000 --> 0:11:42,000
The most underreported fact of Harriet Tubman

252
0:11:43.2,000 --> 0:11:45,000
is that she lived to be 93 years old,

253
0:11:45.76,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and she didn't live just an ordinary life; uh-uh.

254
0:11:48.12,000 --> 0:11:51,000
She was standing up for the good guys. She married a younger man.

255
0:11:51.24,000 --> 0:11:54,000
She adopted a child. I'm not kidding. She lived.

256
0:11:54.48,000 --> 0:11:56,000
And I drove up to her house of freedom in upstate New York,

257
0:11:57.32,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and she had planted apple trees,

258
0:11:59.24,000 --> 0:12:01,000
and when I was there on a Sunday, they were blooming.

259
0:12:01.92,000 --> 0:12:02,000
Do you call it -- do they bloom?

260
0:12:03.52,000 --> 0:12:04,000
The apples were in season,

261
0:12:05.24,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and I was thinking, she left fruit for us,

262
0:12:08.76,000 --> 0:12:11,000
the legacy of Harriet Tubman, every single year.

263
0:12:12.44,000 --> 0:12:13,000
And we know that we are Harriet,

264
0:12:14.4,000 --> 0:12:17,000
and we know that there is a Harriet in every community in America.

265
0:12:18.56,000 --> 0:12:21,000
VG: We also know that there's a Harriet in every community across the globe,

266
0:12:22.24,000 --> 0:12:24,000
and that they could learn from our Tubman Doctrine,

267
0:12:25.04,000 --> 0:12:27,000
as we call it, the four steps.

268
0:12:27.52,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Imagine the possibilities

269
0:12:29.24,000 --> 0:12:31,000
beyond the neighborhoods of Oakland and Newark,

270
0:12:31.96,000 --> 0:12:33,000
to the women working rice fields in Vietnam,

271
0:12:34.12,000 --> 0:12:35,000
tea fields in Sri Lanka,

272
0:12:35.72,000 --> 0:12:37,000
the women on the mountainsides in Guatemala,

273
0:12:38.08,000 --> 0:12:41,000
the indigenous reservations throughout the vast plains of the Dakotas.

274
0:12:41.92,000 --> 0:12:42,000
We believe that women walking

275
0:12:43.48,000 --> 0:12:45,000
and talking together to solve their problems

276
0:12:45.92,000 --> 0:12:46,000
is a global solution.

277
0:12:48.56,000 --> 0:12:49,000
TMD: And I'll leave you with this,

278
0:12:50.24,000 --> 0:12:53,000
because we also believe it can become the center of social justice again.

279
0:12:53.92,000 --> 0:12:54,000
Vanessa and I were in Fort Lauderdale.

280
0:12:55.8,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We had an organizer training,

281
0:12:57.24,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and I was leaving and I got on the airplane,

282
0:12:59.88,000 --> 0:13:,000
and I saw someone I knew, so I waved,

283
0:13:01.72,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and as I'm waiting in that long line that you guys know,

284
0:13:04.4,000 --> 0:13:06,000
waiting for people to put their stuff away,

285
0:13:06.44,000 --> 0:13:09,000
I looked back and I realized I didn't know the woman but I recognized her.

286
0:13:10.16,000 --> 0:13:13,000
And so I blew her a kiss because it was Sybrina Fulton,

287
0:13:13.96,000 --> 0:13:14,000
Trayvon Martin's mom,

288
0:13:15.2,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and she whispered "thank you" back to me.

289
0:13:19,000 --> 0:13:21,000
And I can't help but wonder what would happen

290
0:13:21.52,000 --> 0:13:24,000
if there were groups of women walking on Trayvon's block that day,

291
0:13:25.4,000 --> 0:13:28,000
or what would happen in the South Side of Chicago every day

292
0:13:28.56,000 --> 0:13:31,000
if there were groups of women and mothers and aunts and cousins

293
0:13:32.24,000 --> 0:13:33,000
walking,

294
0:13:33.48,000 --> 0:13:35,000
or along the polluted rivers of Flint, Michigan.

295
0:13:37,000 --> 0:13:4,000
I believe that walking can transform our communities,

296
0:13:40.04,000 --> 0:13:41,000
because it's already starting to.

297
0:13:42.12,000 --> 0:13:44,000
VG: We believe that the personal is political.

298
0:13:44.76,000 --> 0:13:46,000
Our walking is for healing, for joy, for fresh air,

299
0:13:47.56,000 --> 0:13:5,000
quiet time, to connect and disconnect, to worship.

300
0:13:51.44,000 --> 0:13:54,000
But it's also walking so we can be healthy enough

301
0:13:54.48,000 --> 0:13:58,000
to stand on the front lines for change in our communities,

302
0:13:58.64,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and it is our call to action to every Black woman listening,

303
0:14:02.32,000 --> 0:14:04,000
every Black woman in earshot of our voice,

304
0:14:04.64,000 --> 0:14:05,000
every Black woman who you know.

305
0:14:06.2,000 --> 0:14:09,000
Think about it: the woman working front desk reception at your job,

306
0:14:09.4,000 --> 0:14:11,000
the woman who delivers your mail, your neighbor --

307
0:14:11.8,000 --> 0:14:14,000
our call to action to them, to join us on the front lines

308
0:14:15.28,000 --> 0:14:16,000
for change in your community.

309
0:14:17.92,000 --> 0:14:19,000
TMD: And I'll bring us back to this moment

310
0:14:2,000 --> 0:14:23,000
and why it's so important for my dear, dear friend Vanessa and I.

311
0:14:23.2,000 --> 0:14:24,000
It's because it's not always easy for us,

312
0:14:25.2,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and in fact, we have both seen really, really dark days,

313
0:14:29.32,000 --> 0:14:32,000
from the hate speech to the summer of police brutality and violence

314
0:14:33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
that we saw last year,

315
0:14:35.2,000 --> 0:14:36,000
to even losing one of our walkers,

316
0:14:37,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Sandy Bland, who died in police custody.

317
0:14:41.88,000 --> 0:14:44,000
But the most courageous thing we do every day is we practice faith

318
0:14:45.44,000 --> 0:14:46,000
that goes beyond the facts,

319
0:14:46.8,000 --> 0:14:49,000
and we put feet to our prayers every single day,

320
0:14:50.64,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and when we get overwhelmed,

321
0:14:52.32,000 --> 0:14:55,000
we think of the words of people like Sonia Sanchez, a poet laureate,

322
0:14:55.72,000 --> 0:14:57,000
who says, "Morgan, where is your fire?

323
0:14:58.12,000 --> 0:15:,000
Where is the fire that burned holes through slave ships

324
0:15:00.76,000 --> 0:15:01,000
to make us breathe?

325
0:15:02,000 --> 0:15:04,000
Where is the fire that turned guts into chitlins,

326
0:15:04.36,000 --> 0:15:05,000
that took rhythms and make jazz,

327
0:15:06.16,000 --> 0:15:09,000
that took sit-ins and marches and made us jump boundaries and barriers?

328
0:15:09.84,000 --> 0:15:11,000
You've got to find it and pass it on."

329
0:15:12.52,000 --> 0:15:15,000
So this is us finding our fire and passing it on to you.

330
0:15:15.92,000 --> 0:15:17,000
So please, stand with us,

331
0:15:18.28,000 --> 0:15:2,000
walk with us as we rally a million women

332
0:15:20.92,000 --> 0:15:22,000
to reclaim the streets of the 50 highest need communities

333
0:15:23.84,000 --> 0:15:24,000
in this country.

334
0:15:25.24,000 --> 0:15:27,000
We thank you so much for this opportunity.

335
0:15:27.64,000 --> 0:15:28,000
(Applause)

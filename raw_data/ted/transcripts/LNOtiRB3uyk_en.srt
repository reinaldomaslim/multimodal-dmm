1
0:00:18.33,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I'll just start talking about the 17th century.

2
0:00:20.593,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I hope nobody finds that offensive.

3
0:00:22.33,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I -- you know, when I -- after I had invented PCR,

4
0:00:25.33,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I kind of needed a change.

5
0:00:27.33,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And I moved down to La Jolla and learned how to surf.

6
0:00:30.33,000 --> 0:00:32,000
And I started living down there on the beach for a long time.

7
0:00:33.33,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And when surfers are out waiting

8
0:00:35.33,000 --> 0:00:36,000
for waves,

9
0:00:37.33,000 --> 0:00:38,000
you probably wonder, if you've never been out there, what are they doing?

10
0:00:39.33,000 --> 0:00:4,000
You know, sometimes there's a 10-, 15-minute break out there

11
0:00:41.33,000 --> 0:00:43,000
when you're waiting for a wave to come in.

12
0:00:43.354,000 --> 0:00:45,000
They usually talk about the 17th century.

13
0:00:46.33,000 --> 0:00:48,000
You know, they get a real bad rap in the world.

14
0:00:49.33,000 --> 0:00:52,000
People think they're sort of lowbrows.

15
0:00:53.33,000 --> 0:00:55,000
One day, somebody suggested I read this book.

16
0:00:55.497,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It was called --

17
0:00:57.33,000 --> 0:00:58,000
it was called "The Air Pump,"

18
0:00:59.33,000 --> 0:01:01,000
or something like "The Leviathan and The Air Pump."

19
0:01:01.783,000 --> 0:01:03,000
It was a real weird book about the 17th century.

20
0:01:04.33,000 --> 0:01:05,000
And I realized, the roots

21
0:01:06.33,000 --> 0:01:07,000
of the way I sort of thought

22
0:01:08.33,000 --> 0:01:1,000
was just the only natural way to think about things.

23
0:01:11.33,000 --> 0:01:13,000
That -- you know, I was born thinking about things that way,

24
0:01:14.33,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and I had always been like a little scientist guy.

25
0:01:16.33,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And when I went to find out something,

26
0:01:18.33,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I used scientific methods. I wasn't real surprised,

27
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:21,000
you know, when they first told me how --

28
0:01:22.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
how you were supposed to do science,

29
0:01:24.33,000 --> 0:01:27,000
because I'd already been doing it for fun and whatever.

30
0:01:28.33,000 --> 0:01:3,000
But it didn't -- it never occurred to me

31
0:01:31.33,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that it had to be invented

32
0:01:33.33,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and that it had been invented

33
0:01:35.33,000 --> 0:01:36,000
only 350 years ago.

34
0:01:37.33,000 --> 0:01:38,000
You know, it was --

35
0:01:39.33,000 --> 0:01:41,000
like it happened in England, and Germany, and Italy

36
0:01:42.33,000 --> 0:01:43,000
sort of all at the same time.

37
0:01:44.33,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And the story of that,

38
0:01:46.33,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I thought, was really fascinating.

39
0:01:48.33,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So I'm going to talk a little bit about that,

40
0:01:50.497,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and what exactly is it that scientists are supposed to do.

41
0:01:53.33,000 --> 0:01:54,000
And it's, it's a kind of --

42
0:01:55.33,000 --> 0:01:58,000
You know, Charles I got beheaded

43
0:01:59.33,000 --> 0:02:,000
somewhere early in the 17th century.

44
0:02:01.33,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And the English set up Cromwell

45
0:02:03.33,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and a whole bunch of Republicans or whatever,

46
0:02:05.497,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and not the kind of Republicans we had.

47
0:02:08.33,000 --> 0:02:11,000
They changed the government, and it didn't work.

48
0:02:12.33,000 --> 0:02:14,000
And

49
0:02:15.33,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Charles II, the son,

50
0:02:19.33,000 --> 0:02:21,000
was finally put back on the throne of England.

51
0:02:21.545,000 --> 0:02:23,000
He was really nervous, because his dad had been,

52
0:02:24.33,000 --> 0:02:26,000
you know, beheaded for being the King of England

53
0:02:26.64,000 --> 0:02:28,000
And he was nervous about the fact

54
0:02:29.33,000 --> 0:02:3,000
that conversations that got going

55
0:02:31.33,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in, like, bars and stuff

56
0:02:33.33,000 --> 0:02:34,000
would turn to --

57
0:02:35.33,000 --> 0:02:36,000
this is kind of -- it's hard to believe,

58
0:02:37.33,000 --> 0:02:38,000
but people in the 17th century in England

59
0:02:39.33,000 --> 0:02:4,000
were starting to talk about, you know,

60
0:02:41.33,000 --> 0:02:42,000
philosophy and stuff in bars.

61
0:02:43.33,000 --> 0:02:44,000
They didn't have TV screens,

62
0:02:45.33,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and they didn't have any football games to watch.

63
0:02:47.688,000 --> 0:02:48,000
And they would get really pissy,

64
0:02:49.33,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and all of a sudden people would spill out into the street and fight

65
0:02:52.593,000 --> 0:02:53,000
about issues like whether or not

66
0:02:54.33,000 --> 0:02:56,000
it was okay if Robert Boyle

67
0:02:57.33,000 --> 0:02:58,000
made a device called the vacuum pump.

68
0:02:59.33,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Now, Boyle was a friend of Charles II.

69
0:03:02.33,000 --> 0:03:04,000
He was a Christian guy during the weekends,

70
0:03:05.33,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but during the week he was a scientist.

71
0:03:08.33,000 --> 0:03:08,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:09.33,000 --> 0:03:1,000
Which was -- back then it was

73
0:03:11.33,000 --> 0:03:13,000
sort of, you know, well, you know --

74
0:03:14.33,000 --> 0:03:16,000
if you made this thing -- he made this little device,

75
0:03:16.878,000 --> 0:03:18,000
like kind of like a bicycle pump

76
0:03:19.33,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in reverse that could suck all the air out of --

77
0:03:22.33,000 --> 0:03:23,000
you know what a bell jar is? One of these things,

78
0:03:24.33,000 --> 0:03:26,000
you pick it up, put it down, and it's got a seal,

79
0:03:26.688,000 --> 0:03:27,000
and you can see inside of it,

80
0:03:28.33,000 --> 0:03:29,000
so you can see what's going on inside this thing.

81
0:03:30.33,000 --> 0:03:32,000
But what he was trying to do was to pump all the air out of there,

82
0:03:33.33,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and see what would happen inside there.

83
0:03:35.33,000 --> 0:03:38,000
I mean, the first -- I think one of the first experiments he did

84
0:03:39.33,000 --> 0:03:4,000
was he put a bird in there.

85
0:03:41.33,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And people in the 17th century,

86
0:03:44.33,000 --> 0:03:46,000
they didn't really understand the same way we do

87
0:03:47.33,000 --> 0:03:48,000
about you know, this stuff is

88
0:03:49.33,000 --> 0:03:51,000
a bunch of different kinds of molecules,

89
0:03:52.33,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and we breathe it in for a purpose and all that.

90
0:03:55.33,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I mean, fish don't know much about water,

91
0:03:57.33,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and people didn't know much about air.

92
0:04:00.33,000 --> 0:04:01,000
But both started exploring it.

93
0:04:02.33,000 --> 0:04:03,000
One thing, he put a bird in there, and he pumped all the air out,

94
0:04:04.33,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and the bird died. So he said, hmm...

95
0:04:06.33,000 --> 0:04:08,000
He said -- he called what he'd done as making --

96
0:04:09.33,000 --> 0:04:11,000
they didn't call it a vacuum pump at the time.

97
0:04:11.545,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Now you call it a vacuum pump; he called it a vacuum.

98
0:04:14.33,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Right? And immediately,

99
0:04:17.33,000 --> 0:04:18,000
he got into trouble with the local clergy

100
0:04:19.33,000 --> 0:04:21,000
who said, you can't make a vacuum.

101
0:04:22.33,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Ah, uh --

102
0:04:24.33,000 --> 0:04:26,000
(Laughter)

103
0:04:27.33,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Aristotle said that nature abhors one.

104
0:04:29.33,000 --> 0:04:31,000
I think it was a poor translation, probably,

105
0:04:31.45,000 --> 0:04:33,000
but people relied on authorities like that.

106
0:04:34.33,000 --> 0:04:36,000
And you know, Boyle says, well, shit.

107
0:04:37.33,000 --> 0:04:38,000
I make them all the time.

108
0:04:39.33,000 --> 0:04:41,000
I mean, whatever that is that kills the bird --

109
0:04:42.33,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and I'm calling it a vacuum.

110
0:04:44.33,000 --> 0:04:46,000
And the religious people said that

111
0:04:47.33,000 --> 0:04:49,000
if God wanted you to make --

112
0:04:50.33,000 --> 0:04:51,000
I mean, God is everywhere,

113
0:04:52.33,000 --> 0:04:54,000
that was one of their rules, is God is everywhere.

114
0:04:54.735,000 --> 0:04:56,000
And a vacuum -- there's nothing in a vacuum,

115
0:04:56.855,000 --> 0:04:58,000
so you've -- God couldn't be in there.

116
0:04:59.33,000 --> 0:05:02,000
So therefore the church said that you can't make a vacuum, you know.

117
0:05:02.593,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And Boyle said, bullshit.

118
0:05:04.33,000 --> 0:05:05,000
I mean, you want to call it Godless,

119
0:05:06.33,000 --> 0:05:07,000
you know, you call it Godless.

120
0:05:08.33,000 --> 0:05:09,000
But that's not my job. I'm not into that.

121
0:05:10.33,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I do that on the weekend. And like --

122
0:05:13.33,000 --> 0:05:15,000
what I'm trying to do is figure out what happens

123
0:05:16.33,000 --> 0:05:18,000
when you suck everything out of a compartment.

124
0:05:19.33,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And he did all these cute little experiments.

125
0:05:21.497,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Like he did one with -- he had a little wheel,

126
0:05:24.33,000 --> 0:05:26,000
like a fan, that was

127
0:05:27.33,000 --> 0:05:29,000
sort of loosely attached, so it could spin by itself.

128
0:05:30.33,000 --> 0:05:31,000
He had another fan opposed to it

129
0:05:32.33,000 --> 0:05:33,000
that he had like a --

130
0:05:34.33,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I mean, the way I would have done this would be, like, a rubber band,

131
0:05:36.33,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and, you know, around a tinker toy kind of fan.

132
0:05:38.593,000 --> 0:05:41,000
I know exactly how he did it; I've seen the drawings.

133
0:05:42.33,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It's two fans, one which he could turn from outside

134
0:05:44.33,000 --> 0:05:45,000
after he got the vacuum established,

135
0:05:46.33,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and he discovered that if he pulled all the air out of it,

136
0:05:49.33,000 --> 0:05:51,000
the one fan would no longer turn the other one, right?

137
0:05:52.33,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Something was missing, you know. I mean, these are --

138
0:05:55.33,000 --> 0:05:56,000
it's kind of weird to think that someone had to do an experiment to show that,

139
0:05:57.33,000 --> 0:06:,000
but that was what was going on at the time.

140
0:06:02.306,000 --> 0:06:04,000
And like, there was big arguments about it

141
0:06:04.33,000 --> 0:06:07,000
in the -- you know, the gin houses and in the coffee shops and stuff.

142
0:06:08.33,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And Charles

143
0:06:10.33,000 --> 0:06:11,000
started not liking that.

144
0:06:12.33,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Charles II was kind of saying, you know, you should keep that --

145
0:06:15.33,000 --> 0:06:17,000
let's make a place where you can do this stuff

146
0:06:18.33,000 --> 0:06:19,000
where people don't get so -- you know,

147
0:06:20.33,000 --> 0:06:22,000
we don't want the -- we don't want to get the people mad at me again. And so --

148
0:06:23.33,000 --> 0:06:25,000
because when they started talking about religion

149
0:06:26.33,000 --> 0:06:27,000
and science and stuff like that,

150
0:06:28.33,000 --> 0:06:3,000
that's when it had sort of gotten his father in trouble.

151
0:06:31.021,000 --> 0:06:32,000
And so,

152
0:06:32.33,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Charles said, I'm going to put up the money

153
0:06:34.402,000 --> 0:06:35,000
give you guys a building,

154
0:06:36.33,000 --> 0:06:38,000
come here and you can meet in the building,

155
0:06:38.402,000 --> 0:06:4,000
but just don't talk about religion in there.

156
0:06:40.522,000 --> 0:06:41,000
And that was fine with Boyle.

157
0:06:42.33,000 --> 0:06:44,000
He said, OK, we're going to start having these meetings.

158
0:06:45.021,000 --> 0:06:47,000
And anybody who wants to do science is --

159
0:06:47.33,000 --> 0:06:48,000
this is about the time that Isaac Newton was starting to whip out

160
0:06:49.33,000 --> 0:06:5,000
a lot of really interesting things.

161
0:06:51.33,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And there was all kind of people that would come to the Royal Society,

162
0:06:54.688,000 --> 0:06:56,000
they called it. You had to be dressed up pretty well.

163
0:06:57.33,000 --> 0:06:58,000
It wasn't like a TED conference.

164
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:,000
That was the only criteria, was that you be --

165
0:07:01.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
you looked like a gentleman, and they'd let anybody could come.

166
0:07:04.354,000 --> 0:07:05,000
You didn't have to be a member then.

167
0:07:06.33,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And so, they would come in and you would do --

168
0:07:08.545,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Anybody that was going to show an experiment,

169
0:07:11.33,000 --> 0:07:12,000
which was kind of a new word at the time,

170
0:07:13.33,000 --> 0:07:14,000
demonstrate some principle,

171
0:07:15.33,000 --> 0:07:17,000
they had to do it on stage, where everybody could see it.

172
0:07:18.33,000 --> 0:07:19,000
So they were --

173
0:07:20.33,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the really important part of this was,

174
0:07:22.33,000 --> 0:07:23,000
you were not supposed to talk

175
0:07:24.33,000 --> 0:07:26,000
about final causes, for instance.

176
0:07:27.33,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And God was out of the picture.

177
0:07:29.33,000 --> 0:07:32,000
The actual nature of reality was not at issue.

178
0:07:33.33,000 --> 0:07:36,000
You're not supposed to talk about the absolute nature of anything.

179
0:07:36.497,000 --> 0:07:38,000
You were not supposed to talk about anything

180
0:07:38.617,000 --> 0:07:39,000
that you couldn't demonstrate.

181
0:07:40.33,000 --> 0:07:43,000
So if somebody could see it, you could say, here's how the machine works,

182
0:07:43.831,000 --> 0:07:46,000
here's what we do, and then here's what happens.

183
0:07:47.33,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And seeing what happens, it was OK

184
0:07:49.33,000 --> 0:07:5,000
to generalize,

185
0:07:51.33,000 --> 0:07:53,000
and say, I'm sure that this will happen anytime

186
0:07:54.33,000 --> 0:07:55,000
we make one of these things.

187
0:07:56.33,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And so you can start making up some rules.

188
0:07:58.354,000 --> 0:08:,000
You say, anytime you have a vacuum state,

189
0:08:01.33,000 --> 0:08:03,000
you will discover that one wheel will not turn another one,

190
0:08:04.33,000 --> 0:08:05,000
if the only connection between them

191
0:08:06.33,000 --> 0:08:08,000
is whatever was there before the vacuum. That kind of thing.

192
0:08:09.33,000 --> 0:08:1,000
Candles can't burn in a vacuum,

193
0:08:11.33,000 --> 0:08:13,000
therefore, probably sparklers wouldn't either.

194
0:08:14.33,000 --> 0:08:15,000
It's not clear; actually sparklers will,

195
0:08:16.33,000 --> 0:08:17,000
but they didn't know that.

196
0:08:18.33,000 --> 0:08:19,000
They didn't have sparklers. But, they --

197
0:08:20.33,000 --> 0:08:24,000
(Laughter)

198
0:08:25.33,000 --> 0:08:27,000
-- you can make up rules, but they have to relate

199
0:08:28.33,000 --> 0:08:29,000
only to the things that you've been able to demonstrate.

200
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:32,000
And most the demonstrations had to do with visuals.

201
0:08:33.33,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Like if you do an experiment on stage,

202
0:08:35.33,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and nobody can see it, they can just hear it, they would probably think you were freaky.

203
0:08:38.33,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I mean, reality is what you can see.

204
0:08:41.33,000 --> 0:08:44,000
That wasn't an explicit rule in the meeting,

205
0:08:45.33,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but I'm sure that was part of it, you know. If people hear voices,

206
0:08:47.33,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and they can't see and associate it with somebody,

207
0:08:50.33,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that person's probably not there.

208
0:08:52.33,000 --> 0:08:54,000
But the general idea that you could only --

209
0:08:56.33,000 --> 0:08:58,000
you could only really talk about things in that place

210
0:08:58.878,000 --> 0:09:,000
that had some kind of experimental basis.

211
0:09:01.33,000 --> 0:09:02,000
It didn't matter what Thomas Hobbes,

212
0:09:03.33,000 --> 0:09:04,000
who was a local philosopher,

213
0:09:05.33,000 --> 0:09:06,000
said about it, you know,

214
0:09:07.33,000 --> 0:09:09,000
because you weren't going to be talking final causes.

215
0:09:09.878,000 --> 0:09:1,000
What's happening here,

216
0:09:11.33,000 --> 0:09:12,000
in the middle of the 17th century,

217
0:09:13.33,000 --> 0:09:14,000
was that what became my field --

218
0:09:15.33,000 --> 0:09:16,000
science, experimental science --

219
0:09:17.33,000 --> 0:09:18,000
was pulling itself away,

220
0:09:19.33,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and it was in a physical way, because we're going to do it in this room over here,

221
0:09:22.33,000 --> 0:09:23,000
but it was also what -- it was an amazing thing that happened.

222
0:09:24.33,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Science had been all interlocked

223
0:09:26.33,000 --> 0:09:27,000
with theology, and philosophy,

224
0:09:28.33,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and -- and -- and mathematics,

225
0:09:31.33,000 --> 0:09:33,000
which is really not science.

226
0:09:34.33,000 --> 0:09:37,000
But experimental science had been tied up with all those things.

227
0:09:37.402,000 --> 0:09:39,000
And the mathematics part

228
0:09:40.33,000 --> 0:09:41,000
and the experimental science part

229
0:09:42.33,000 --> 0:09:43,000
was pulling away from philosophy.

230
0:09:44.33,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And -- things --

231
0:09:46.33,000 --> 0:09:47,000
we never looked back.

232
0:09:48.33,000 --> 0:09:5,000
It's been so cool since then.

233
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I mean, it just -- it just -- untangled a thing that was really impeding

234
0:09:56.33,000 --> 0:09:57,000
technology from being developed.

235
0:09:58.33,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And, I mean, everybody in this room --

236
0:10:00.33,000 --> 0:10:01,000
now, this is 350 short years ago.

237
0:10:02.33,000 --> 0:10:03,000
Remember, that's a short time.

238
0:10:04.33,000 --> 0:10:06,000
It was 300,000, probably, years ago

239
0:10:07.33,000 --> 0:10:09,000
that most of us, the ancestors of most of us in this room

240
0:10:10.33,000 --> 0:10:12,000
came up out of Africa and turned to the left.

241
0:10:13.33,000 --> 0:10:14,000
You know, the ones that turned to the right, there are some of those

242
0:10:15.33,000 --> 0:10:16,000
in the Japanese translation.

243
0:10:17.33,000 --> 0:10:19,000
But that happened very -- a long time ago

244
0:10:20.33,000 --> 0:10:21,000
compared to

245
0:10:22.33,000 --> 0:10:23,000
350 short years ago.

246
0:10:24.33,000 --> 0:10:25,000
But in that 350 years,

247
0:10:26.33,000 --> 0:10:28,000
the place has just undergone a lot of changes.

248
0:10:29.33,000 --> 0:10:3,000
In fact, everybody in this room probably,

249
0:10:31.33,000 --> 0:10:33,000
especially if you picked up your bag --

250
0:10:34.33,000 --> 0:10:35,000
some of you, I know, didn't pick up your bags --

251
0:10:36.33,000 --> 0:10:37,000
but if you picked up your bag, everybody in this room

252
0:10:38.33,000 --> 0:10:4,000
has got in their pocket, or back in their room,

253
0:10:40.593,000 --> 0:10:41,000
something

254
0:10:42.33,000 --> 0:10:43,000
that 350 years ago,

255
0:10:44.33,000 --> 0:10:46,000
kings would have gone to war to have.

256
0:10:47.33,000 --> 0:10:48,000
I mean, if you can think how important --

257
0:10:49.33,000 --> 0:10:5,000
If you have a GPS system and there are no satellites,

258
0:10:51.33,000 --> 0:10:53,000
it's not going to be much use. But, like --

259
0:10:53.402,000 --> 0:10:55,000
but, you know, if somebody had a GPS system

260
0:10:55.474,000 --> 0:10:57,000
in the 17th century

261
0:10:58.33,000 --> 0:10:59,000
some king would have gotten together an army

262
0:11:00.33,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and gone to get it, you know. If that person --

263
0:11:02.33,000 --> 0:11:04,000
Audience: For the teddy bear? The teddy bear?

264
0:11:04.497,000 --> 0:11:06,000
Kary Mullis: They might have done it for the teddy bear, yeah.

265
0:11:07.474,000 --> 0:11:08,000
But -- all of us own stuff.

266
0:11:09.33,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I mean, individuals own things

267
0:11:11.33,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that kings would have definitely gone to war to get.

268
0:11:13.831,000 --> 0:11:14,000
And this is just 350 years.

269
0:11:15.33,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Not a whole lot of people doing this stuff.

270
0:11:17.402,000 --> 0:11:18,000
You know, the important people --

271
0:11:19.33,000 --> 0:11:2,000
you can almost read about their lives,

272
0:11:21.33,000 --> 0:11:24,000
about all the really important people that made advances, you know.

273
0:11:24.545,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And, I mean --

274
0:11:26.33,000 --> 0:11:28,000
this kind of stuff, you know, all this stuff

275
0:11:29.33,000 --> 0:11:3,000
came from that separation

276
0:11:31.33,000 --> 0:11:33,000
of this little sort of thing that we do --

277
0:11:34.33,000 --> 0:11:35,000
now I, when I was a boy

278
0:11:36.33,000 --> 0:11:37,000
was born sort of with this idea

279
0:11:38.33,000 --> 0:11:39,000
that if you want to know something --

280
0:11:40.33,000 --> 0:11:41,000
you know, maybe it's because my old man was gone a lot,

281
0:11:42.33,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and my mother didn't really know much science,

282
0:11:44.545,000 --> 0:11:46,000
but I thought if you want to know something about stuff,

283
0:11:47.33,000 --> 0:11:49,000
you do it -- you make an experiment, you know.

284
0:11:49.545,000 --> 0:11:5,000
You get -- you get, like --

285
0:11:51.33,000 --> 0:11:53,000
I just had a natural feeling for science

286
0:11:54.33,000 --> 0:11:55,000
and setting up experiments. I thought that was the way everybody had always thought.

287
0:11:56.33,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I thought that anybody with any brains will do it that way.

288
0:11:59.33,000 --> 0:12:01,000
It isn't true. I mean, there's a lot of people --

289
0:12:02.33,000 --> 0:12:04,000
You know, I was one of those scientists that was --

290
0:12:05.33,000 --> 0:12:07,000
got into trouble the other night at dinner

291
0:12:07.354,000 --> 0:12:08,000
because of the post-modernism thing.

292
0:12:09.33,000 --> 0:12:1,000
And I didn't mean, you know -- where is that lady?

293
0:12:11.33,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Audience: Here.

294
0:12:12.33,000 --> 0:12:12,000
(Laughter)

295
0:12:13.33,000 --> 0:12:15,000
KM: I mean, I didn't really think of that as an argument

296
0:12:16.021,000 --> 0:12:18,000
so much as just a lively discussion.

297
0:12:18.33,000 --> 0:12:2,000
I didn't take it personally, but --

298
0:12:21.33,000 --> 0:12:23,000
I just -- I had -- I naively had thought,

299
0:12:24.33,000 --> 0:12:27,000
until this surfing experience started me into the 17th century,

300
0:12:27.354,000 --> 0:12:29,000
I'd thought that's just the way people thought,

301
0:12:29.617,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and everybody did, and they recognized reality

302
0:12:32.33,000 --> 0:12:34,000
by what they could see or touch or feel or hear.

303
0:12:35.33,000 --> 0:12:38,000
At any rate, when I was a boy,

304
0:12:40.33,000 --> 0:12:41,000
I, like, for instance, I had this --

305
0:12:42.33,000 --> 0:12:43,000
I got this little book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma --

306
0:12:44.33,000 --> 0:12:46,000
This is about the time that George Dyson's dad

307
0:12:46.545,000 --> 0:12:47,000
was starting to blow nuclear --

308
0:12:48.33,000 --> 0:12:5,000
thinking about blowing up nuclear rockets and stuff.

309
0:12:51.33,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I was thinking about making my own little rockets.

310
0:12:54.33,000 --> 0:12:56,000
And I knew that frogs -- little frogs --

311
0:12:57.33,000 --> 0:12:58,000
had aspirations of space travel,

312
0:12:59.33,000 --> 0:13:,000
just like people. And I --

313
0:13:01.33,000 --> 0:13:03,000
(Laughter)

314
0:13:04.33,000 --> 0:13:05,000
I was looking for a --

315
0:13:06.33,000 --> 0:13:07,000
a propulsion system

316
0:13:08.33,000 --> 0:13:09,000
that would like, make a rocket, like,

317
0:13:10.33,000 --> 0:13:12,000
maybe about four feet high go up a couple of miles.

318
0:13:12.783,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And, I mean, that was my sort of goal.

319
0:13:15.33,000 --> 0:13:18,000
I wanted it to go out of sight and then I wanted this little parachute

320
0:13:18.688,000 --> 0:13:2,000
to come back with the frog in it.

321
0:13:21.33,000 --> 0:13:22,000
And -- I -- I --

322
0:13:23.33,000 --> 0:13:24,000
I got this book from Fort Sill, Oklahoma,

323
0:13:25.33,000 --> 0:13:26,000
where there's a missile base.

324
0:13:27.33,000 --> 0:13:29,000
They send it out for amateur rocketeers,

325
0:13:30.33,000 --> 0:13:31,000
and

326
0:13:32.33,000 --> 0:13:33,000
it said in there

327
0:13:34.33,000 --> 0:13:36,000
do not ever heat a mixture of potassium perchlorate and sugar.

328
0:13:37.33,000 --> 0:13:39,000
(Laughter)

329
0:13:40.33,000 --> 0:13:41,000
You know,

330
0:13:42.33,000 --> 0:13:43,000
that's what you call a lead.

331
0:13:44.33,000 --> 0:13:45,000
(Laughter)

332
0:13:46.33,000 --> 0:13:47,000
You sort of -- now you say, well, let's see if I can

333
0:13:48.33,000 --> 0:13:5,000
get hold of some potassium chlorate and sugar, perchlorate and sugar,

334
0:13:51.33,000 --> 0:13:53,000
and heat it; it would be interesting to see what it is they don't want me to do,

335
0:13:54.33,000 --> 0:13:56,000
and what it is going to -- and how is it going to work.

336
0:13:56.926,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And we didn't have --

337
0:13:58.33,000 --> 0:13:59,000
like, my mother

338
0:14:00.33,000 --> 0:14:02,000
presided over the back yard

339
0:14:03.33,000 --> 0:14:04,000
from an upstairs window,

340
0:14:05.33,000 --> 0:14:06,000
where she would be ironing or something like that.

341
0:14:07.33,000 --> 0:14:08,000
And she was usually just sort of keeping an eye on,

342
0:14:09.33,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and if there was any puffs of smoke out there,

343
0:14:11.545,000 --> 0:14:12,000
she'd lean out and admonish us all

344
0:14:13.33,000 --> 0:14:15,000
not to blow our eyes out. That was her --

345
0:14:18.33,000 --> 0:14:19,000
You know, that was kind of the worst thing that could happen to us.

346
0:14:20.33,000 --> 0:14:21,000
That's why I thought, as long as I don't blow my eyes out...

347
0:14:22.33,000 --> 0:14:24,000
I may not care about the fact

348
0:14:25.33,000 --> 0:14:26,000
that it's prohibited from heating this solution.

349
0:14:27.33,000 --> 0:14:29,000
I'm going to do it carefully, but I'll do it.

350
0:14:29.497,000 --> 0:14:31,000
It's like anything else that's prohibited:

351
0:14:31.521,000 --> 0:14:32,000
you do it behind the garage.

352
0:14:33.33,000 --> 0:14:34,000
(Laughter)

353
0:14:35.33,000 --> 0:14:36,000
So, I went to the drug store

354
0:14:37.33,000 --> 0:14:39,000
and I tried to buy some potassium perchlorate

355
0:14:40.33,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and it wasn't unreasonable then for a kid

356
0:14:42.33,000 --> 0:14:44,000
to walk into a drug store and buy chemicals.

357
0:14:45.33,000 --> 0:14:46,000
Nowadays, it's no ma'am,

358
0:14:47.33,000 --> 0:14:48,000
check your shoes. And like --

359
0:14:49.33,000 --> 0:14:5,000
(Laughter)

360
0:14:51.33,000 --> 0:14:52,000
But then it wasn't -- they didn't have any, but the guy had --

361
0:14:53.33,000 --> 0:14:55,000
I said, what kind of salts of potassium do you have? You know.

362
0:14:56.33,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And he had potassium nitrate.

363
0:14:58.33,000 --> 0:15:,000
And I said, that might do the same thing, whatever it is.

364
0:15:01.33,000 --> 0:15:03,000
I'm sure it's got to do with rockets or it wouldn't be in that manual.

365
0:15:04.33,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And so I -- I did some experiments.

366
0:15:06.33,000 --> 0:15:08,000
You know, I started off with little tiny amounts

367
0:15:08.64,000 --> 0:15:09,000
of potassium nitrate and sugar,

368
0:15:10.33,000 --> 0:15:11,000
which was readily available,

369
0:15:12.33,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and I mixed it in different proportions,

370
0:15:14.33,000 --> 0:15:16,000
and I tried to light it on fire.

371
0:15:17.33,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Just to see what would happen, if you mixed it together.

372
0:15:20.021,000 --> 0:15:21,000
And it -- they burned.

373
0:15:21.33,000 --> 0:15:22,000
It burned kind of slow, but it made a nice smell,

374
0:15:23.33,000 --> 0:15:25,000
compared to other rocket fuels I had tried,

375
0:15:25.402,000 --> 0:15:26,000
that all had sulfur in them.

376
0:15:27.33,000 --> 0:15:29,000
And, it smelt like burnt candy.

377
0:15:30.33,000 --> 0:15:32,000
And then I tried the melting business, and I melted it.

378
0:15:33.33,000 --> 0:15:36,000
And then it melted into a little sort of syrupy liquid, brown.

379
0:15:37.33,000 --> 0:15:39,000
And then it cooled down to a brick-hard substance,

380
0:15:40.33,000 --> 0:15:41,000
that when you lit that,

381
0:15:42.33,000 --> 0:15:43,000
it went off like a bat.

382
0:15:44.33,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I mean, the little bowl of that stuff that had cooled down --

383
0:15:46.33,000 --> 0:15:47,000
you'd light it, and it would just start dancing around the yard.

384
0:15:48.33,000 --> 0:15:49,000
And I said, there

385
0:15:50.33,000 --> 0:15:52,000
is a way to get a frog up to where he wants to go.

386
0:15:53.33,000 --> 0:15:53,000
(Laughter)

387
0:15:54.33,000 --> 0:15:56,000
So I started developing --

388
0:15:57.33,000 --> 0:15:59,000
you know, George's dad had a lot of help. I just had my brother.

389
0:16:00.33,000 --> 0:16:02,000
But I -- it took me about -- it took me about,

390
0:16:03.33,000 --> 0:16:04,000
I'd say, six months

391
0:16:05.33,000 --> 0:16:07,000
to finally figure out all the little things.

392
0:16:07.402,000 --> 0:16:08,000
There's a lot of little things involved

393
0:16:09.33,000 --> 0:16:11,000
in making a rocket that it will actually work,

394
0:16:11.545,000 --> 0:16:12,000
even after you have the fuel.

395
0:16:13.33,000 --> 0:16:14,000
But you do it, by -- what I just--

396
0:16:15.33,000 --> 0:16:16,000
you know, you do experiments,

397
0:16:17.33,000 --> 0:16:17,000
and you write down things sometimes,

398
0:16:18.33,000 --> 0:16:19,000
you make observations, you know.

399
0:16:20.33,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And then you slowly build up a theory

400
0:16:22.33,000 --> 0:16:23,000
of how this stuff works.

401
0:16:24.33,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And it was -- I was following all the rules.

402
0:16:26.45,000 --> 0:16:27,000
I didn't know what the rules were,

403
0:16:28.33,000 --> 0:16:29,000
I'm a natural born scientist, I guess,

404
0:16:30.33,000 --> 0:16:32,000
or some kind of a throwback to the 17th century, whatever.

405
0:16:33.33,000 --> 0:16:36,000
But at any rate, we finally did

406
0:16:37.33,000 --> 0:16:38,000
have a device that would reproduceably

407
0:16:39.33,000 --> 0:16:4,000
put a frog out of sight

408
0:16:41.33,000 --> 0:16:42,000
and get him back alive.

409
0:16:43.33,000 --> 0:16:44,000
And we had not --

410
0:16:45.33,000 --> 0:16:47,000
I mean, we weren't frightened by it.

411
0:16:48.33,000 --> 0:16:5,000
We should have been, because it made a lot of smoke

412
0:16:50.783,000 --> 0:16:51,000
and it made a lot of noise,

413
0:16:52.33,000 --> 0:16:53,000
and it was powerful, you know.

414
0:16:54.33,000 --> 0:16:55,000
And once in a while, they would blow up.

415
0:16:56.33,000 --> 0:16:57,000
But I wasn't worried, by the way,

416
0:16:58.33,000 --> 0:16:59,000
about, you know,

417
0:17:00.33,000 --> 0:17:01,000
the explosion causing the destruction of the planet.

418
0:17:02.33,000 --> 0:17:03,000
I hadn't heard about the 10 ways

419
0:17:04.33,000 --> 0:17:05,000
that we should be afraid of the --

420
0:17:06.33,000 --> 0:17:07,000
By the way,

421
0:17:08.33,000 --> 0:17:09,000
I could have thought,

422
0:17:10.33,000 --> 0:17:11,000
I'd better not do this because

423
0:17:12.33,000 --> 0:17:13,000
they say not to, you know.

424
0:17:14.33,000 --> 0:17:15,000
And I'd better get permission from the government.

425
0:17:16.33,000 --> 0:17:17,000
If I'd have waited around for that,

426
0:17:18.33,000 --> 0:17:21,000
I would have never -- the frog would have died, you know.

427
0:17:22.33,000 --> 0:17:24,000
At any rate, I bring it up because it's a good story,

428
0:17:25.33,000 --> 0:17:26,000
and he said, tell personal things, you know, and that's a personal --

429
0:17:27.33,000 --> 0:17:29,000
I was going to tell you about the first night that I met my wife,

430
0:17:30.33,000 --> 0:17:32,000
but that would be too personal, wouldn't it.

431
0:17:33.33,000 --> 0:17:35,000
So, so I've got something else that's not personal.

432
0:17:35.783,000 --> 0:17:37,000
But that... process is what I think of as science,

433
0:17:38.33,000 --> 0:17:4,000
see, where you start with some idea,

434
0:17:41.33,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and then instead of, like, looking up,

435
0:17:44.33,000 --> 0:17:45,000
every authority that you've ever heard of

436
0:17:46.33,000 --> 0:17:47,000
I -- sometimes you do that,

437
0:17:48.33,000 --> 0:17:49,000
if you're going to write a paper later,

438
0:17:50.33,000 --> 0:17:51,000
you want to figure out who else has worked on it.

439
0:17:52.33,000 --> 0:17:54,000
But in the actual process, you get an idea --

440
0:17:54.497,000 --> 0:17:55,000
like, when I got the idea one night

441
0:17:56.33,000 --> 0:17:58,000
that I could amplify DNA with two oligonucleotides,

442
0:17:59.33,000 --> 0:18:01,000
and I could make lots of copies of some little piece of DNA,

443
0:18:02.33,000 --> 0:18:03,000
you know, the thinking for that

444
0:18:04.33,000 --> 0:18:07,000
was about 20 minutes while I was driving my car,

445
0:18:08.33,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and then instead of going -- I went back and I did talk to people about it,

446
0:18:11.926,000 --> 0:18:15,000
but if I'd listened to what I heard from all my friends who were molecular biologists --

447
0:18:16.33,000 --> 0:18:17,000
I would have abandoned it.

448
0:18:18.33,000 --> 0:18:19,000
You know, if I had gone back looking for an authority figure

449
0:18:20.33,000 --> 0:18:22,000
who could tell me if it would work or not,

450
0:18:22.354,000 --> 0:18:24,000
he would have said, no, it probably won't.

451
0:18:24.378,000 --> 0:18:26,000
Because the results of it were so spectacular

452
0:18:28.33,000 --> 0:18:3,000
that if it worked it was going to change everybody's goddamn way of doing molecular biology.

453
0:18:31.33,000 --> 0:18:32,000
Nobody wants a chemist to come in

454
0:18:33.33,000 --> 0:18:35,000
and poke around in their stuff like that and change things.

455
0:18:36.33,000 --> 0:18:37,000
But if you go to authority, and you always don't --

456
0:18:38.33,000 --> 0:18:4,000
you don't always get the right answer, see.

457
0:18:40.402,000 --> 0:18:41,000
But I knew, you'd go into the lab

458
0:18:42.33,000 --> 0:18:43,000
and you'd try to make it work yourself. And then you're the authority,

459
0:18:44.33,000 --> 0:18:45,000
and you can say, I know it works,

460
0:18:46.33,000 --> 0:18:47,000
because right there in that tube

461
0:18:48.33,000 --> 0:18:49,000
is where it happened,

462
0:18:50.33,000 --> 0:18:51,000
and here, on this gel, there's a little band there

463
0:18:52.33,000 --> 0:18:55,000
that I know that's DNA, and that's the DNA I wanted to amplify,

464
0:18:55.354,000 --> 0:18:56,000
so there! So it does work.

465
0:18:57.33,000 --> 0:18:58,000
You know, that's how you do science.

466
0:18:59.33,000 --> 0:19:,000
And then you say, well, what can make it work better?

467
0:19:01.33,000 --> 0:19:02,000
And then you figure out better and better ways to do it.

468
0:19:03.33,000 --> 0:19:05,000
But you always work from, from like, facts

469
0:19:05.354,000 --> 0:19:07,000
that you have made available to you

470
0:19:08.33,000 --> 0:19:09,000
by doing experiments: things that you could do on a stage.

471
0:19:10.33,000 --> 0:19:12,000
And no tricky shit behind the thing. I mean, it's all --

472
0:19:13.33,000 --> 0:19:14,000
you've got to be very honest

473
0:19:15.33,000 --> 0:19:16,000
with what you're doing if it really is going to work.

474
0:19:17.33,000 --> 0:19:18,000
I mean, you can't make up results,

475
0:19:19.33,000 --> 0:19:21,000
and then do another experiment based on that one.

476
0:19:21.688,000 --> 0:19:22,000
So you have to be honest.

477
0:19:23.33,000 --> 0:19:24,000
And I'm basically honest.

478
0:19:25.33,000 --> 0:19:27,000
I have a fairly bad memory, and dishonesty would always get me in trouble,

479
0:19:28.33,000 --> 0:19:3,000
if I, like -- so I've just sort of been naturally honest

480
0:19:31.021,000 --> 0:19:33,000
and naturally inquisitive,

481
0:19:33.33,000 --> 0:19:35,000
and that sort of leads to that kind of science.

482
0:19:35.593,000 --> 0:19:36,000
Now, let's see...

483
0:19:37.33,000 --> 0:19:39,000
I've got another five minutes, right?

484
0:19:40.33,000 --> 0:19:43,000
OK. All scientists aren't like that.

485
0:19:44.33,000 --> 0:19:45,000
You know -- and there is a lot --

486
0:19:46.33,000 --> 0:19:47,000
(Laughter)

487
0:19:48.33,000 --> 0:19:5,000
There is a lot -- a lot has been going on since

488
0:19:50.593,000 --> 0:19:52,000
Isaac Newton and all that stuff happened.

489
0:19:53.33,000 --> 0:19:54,000
One of the things that happened right around World War II

490
0:19:55.33,000 --> 0:19:56,000
in that same time period before,

491
0:19:57.33,000 --> 0:19:58,000
and as sure as hell afterwards,

492
0:19:59.33,000 --> 0:20:02,000
government got -- realized that scientists aren't strange dudes

493
0:20:02.354,000 --> 0:20:04,000
that, you know, hide in ivory towers

494
0:20:05.33,000 --> 0:20:07,000
and do ridiculous things with test tube.

495
0:20:08.33,000 --> 0:20:09,000
Scientists, you know, made World War II

496
0:20:10.33,000 --> 0:20:11,000
as we know it quite possible.

497
0:20:12.33,000 --> 0:20:14,000
They made faster things.

498
0:20:15.33,000 --> 0:20:17,000
They made bigger guns to shoot them down with.

499
0:20:18.33,000 --> 0:20:2,000
You know, they made drugs to give the pilots

500
0:20:21.33,000 --> 0:20:23,000
if they were broken up in the process.

501
0:20:24.33,000 --> 0:20:26,000
They made all kinds of -- and then finally one giant bomb

502
0:20:27.33,000 --> 0:20:28,000
to end the whole thing, right?

503
0:20:29.33,000 --> 0:20:3,000
And everybody stepped back a little and said, you know,

504
0:20:31.33,000 --> 0:20:32,000
we ought to invest in this shit,

505
0:20:33.33,000 --> 0:20:35,000
because whoever has got the most of these people

506
0:20:36.33,000 --> 0:20:38,000
working in the places is going to have a dominant position,

507
0:20:39.33,000 --> 0:20:41,000
at least in the military, and probably in all kind of economic ways.

508
0:20:42.33,000 --> 0:20:43,000
And they got involved in it, and the scientific

509
0:20:44.33,000 --> 0:20:45,000
and industrial establishment was born,

510
0:20:46.33,000 --> 0:20:47,000
and out of that came a lot of scientists

511
0:20:48.33,000 --> 0:20:5,000
who were in there for the money, you know,

512
0:20:51.33,000 --> 0:20:52,000
because it was suddenly available.

513
0:20:53.33,000 --> 0:20:54,000
And they weren't the curious little boys

514
0:20:55.33,000 --> 0:20:56,000
that liked to put frogs up in the air.

515
0:20:57.33,000 --> 0:20:59,000
They were the same people that later went in to medical school, you know,

516
0:21:00.33,000 --> 0:21:02,000
because there was money in it, you know. I mean, later, then they all got into business --

517
0:21:03.33,000 --> 0:21:05,000
I mean, there are waves of -- going into your high school,

518
0:21:06.33,000 --> 0:21:08,000
person saying, you want to be rich, you know, be a scientist. You know, not anymore.

519
0:21:09.33,000 --> 0:21:11,000
You want to be rich, you be a businessman.

520
0:21:11.354,000 --> 0:21:14,000
But a lot of people got in it for the money and the power and the travel.

521
0:21:14.855,000 --> 0:21:16,000
That's back when travel was easy.

522
0:21:18.33,000 --> 0:21:19,000
And those people don't think --

523
0:21:20.33,000 --> 0:21:21,000
they don't --

524
0:21:22.33,000 --> 0:21:23,000
they don't always tell you the truth, you know.

525
0:21:24.33,000 --> 0:21:26,000
There is nothing in their contract, in fact,

526
0:21:26.45,000 --> 0:21:27,000
that makes it to their advantage always,

527
0:21:28.45,000 --> 0:21:29,000
to tell you the truth.

528
0:21:30.33,000 --> 0:21:32,000
And the people I'm talking about are people that like --

529
0:21:33.33,000 --> 0:21:35,000
they say that they're a member of the committee

530
0:21:36.33,000 --> 0:21:39,000
called, say, the Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change.

531
0:21:40.33,000 --> 0:21:43,000
And they -- and they have these big meetings where they try to figure out

532
0:21:44.33,000 --> 0:21:46,000
how we're going to -- how we're going to continually prove

533
0:21:47.116,000 --> 0:21:49,000
that the planet is getting warmer,

534
0:21:49.33,000 --> 0:21:51,000
when that's actually contrary to most people's sensations.

535
0:21:52.33,000 --> 0:21:53,000
I mean, if you actually measure

536
0:21:54.33,000 --> 0:21:55,000
the temperature over a period --

537
0:21:56.33,000 --> 0:21:58,000
I mean, the temperature has been measured now

538
0:21:58.497,000 --> 0:22:,000
pretty carefully for about 50, 60 years --

539
0:22:01.33,000 --> 0:22:02,000
longer than that it's been measured,

540
0:22:03.33,000 --> 0:22:04,000
but in really nice, precise ways,

541
0:22:05.33,000 --> 0:22:07,000
and records have been kept for 50 or 60 years,

542
0:22:08.33,000 --> 0:22:09,000
and in fact, the temperature hadn't really gone up.

543
0:22:10.33,000 --> 0:22:11,000
It's like, the average temperature

544
0:22:12.33,000 --> 0:22:13,000
has gone up a tiny little bit,

545
0:22:14.33,000 --> 0:22:16,000
because the nighttime temperatures

546
0:22:17.33,000 --> 0:22:18,000
at the weather stations have come up just a little bit.

547
0:22:19.33,000 --> 0:22:2,000
But there's a good explanation for that.

548
0:22:21.33,000 --> 0:22:24,000
And it's that the weather stations are all built outside of town,

549
0:22:24.45,000 --> 0:22:25,000
where the airport was, and now

550
0:22:26.33,000 --> 0:22:27,000
the town's moved out there, there's concrete all around

551
0:22:28.33,000 --> 0:22:29,000
and they call it the skyline effect.

552
0:22:30.33,000 --> 0:22:31,000
And most responsible people

553
0:22:32.33,000 --> 0:22:33,000
that measure temperatures realize

554
0:22:34.33,000 --> 0:22:36,000
you have to shield your measuring device from that.

555
0:22:36.783,000 --> 0:22:38,000
And even then, you know,

556
0:22:39.33,000 --> 0:22:39,000
because the buildings get warm in the daytime,

557
0:22:40.33,000 --> 0:22:42,000
and they keep it a little warmer at night.

558
0:22:42.354,000 --> 0:22:43,000
So the temperature has been, sort of, inching up.

559
0:22:44.354,000 --> 0:22:46,000
It should have been. But not a lot. Not like, you know --

560
0:22:47.33,000 --> 0:22:48,000
the first guy -- the first guy that got the idea

561
0:22:49.33,000 --> 0:22:5,000
that we're going to fry ourselves here,

562
0:22:51.33,000 --> 0:22:52,000
actually, he didn't think of it that way.

563
0:22:53.33,000 --> 0:22:55,000
His name was Sven Arrhenius. He was Swedish, and he said,

564
0:22:56.33,000 --> 0:22:58,000
if you double the CO2 level in the atmosphere,

565
0:22:59.33,000 --> 0:23:01,000
which he thought might -- this is in 1900 --

566
0:23:02.33,000 --> 0:23:05,000
the temperature ought to go up about 5.5 degrees, he calculated.

567
0:23:05.402,000 --> 0:23:07,000
He was thinking of the earth as, kind of like,

568
0:23:07.617,000 --> 0:23:09,000
you know, like a completely insulated thing

569
0:23:10.33,000 --> 0:23:11,000
with no stuff in it, really,

570
0:23:12.33,000 --> 0:23:13,000
just energy coming down, energy leaving.

571
0:23:14.33,000 --> 0:23:15,000
And so he came up with this theory,

572
0:23:16.33,000 --> 0:23:17,000
and he said, this will be cool,

573
0:23:18.33,000 --> 0:23:2,000
because it'll be a longer growing season in Sweden,

574
0:23:21.33,000 --> 0:23:22,000
you know, and the surfers liked it,

575
0:23:23.33,000 --> 0:23:24,000
the surfers thought, that's a cool idea,

576
0:23:25.33,000 --> 0:23:27,000
because it's pretty cold in the ocean sometimes, and --

577
0:23:28.33,000 --> 0:23:29,000
but a lot of other people later on

578
0:23:30.33,000 --> 0:23:32,000
started thinking it would be bad, you know.

579
0:23:33.33,000 --> 0:23:35,000
But nobody actually demonstrated it, right?

580
0:23:35.402,000 --> 0:23:36,000
I mean, the temperature as measured --

581
0:23:37.33,000 --> 0:23:39,000
and you can find this on our wonderful Internet,

582
0:23:39.64,000 --> 0:23:41,000
you just go and look for all NASAs records,

583
0:23:42.33,000 --> 0:23:43,000
and all the Weather Bureau's records,

584
0:23:44.33,000 --> 0:23:46,000
and you'll look at it yourself, and you'll see, the temperature has just --

585
0:23:47.33,000 --> 0:23:5,000
the nighttime temperature measured on the surface of the planet

586
0:23:50.354,000 --> 0:23:51,000
has gone up a tiny little bit.

587
0:23:52.33,000 --> 0:23:53,000
So if you just average that and the daytime temperature, it looks like it went up

588
0:23:54.33,000 --> 0:23:56,000
about .7 degrees in this century.

589
0:23:57.33,000 --> 0:23:58,000
But in fact, it was just coming up --

590
0:23:59.33,000 --> 0:24:01,000
it was the nighttime; the daytime temperatures didn't go up.

591
0:24:02.212,000 --> 0:24:04,000
So -- and Arrhenius' theory --

592
0:24:04.33,000 --> 0:24:05,000
and all the global warmers think --

593
0:24:06.33,000 --> 0:24:07,000
they would say, yeah, it should go up in the daytime, too,

594
0:24:08.33,000 --> 0:24:09,000
if it's the greenhouse effect.

595
0:24:10.33,000 --> 0:24:12,000
Now, people like things that have, like, names like that,

596
0:24:13.33,000 --> 0:24:15,000
that they can envision it, right? I mean --

597
0:24:16.33,000 --> 0:24:18,000
but people don't like things like this, so -- most -- I mean,

598
0:24:19.259,000 --> 0:24:21,000
you don't get all excited about things

599
0:24:21.33,000 --> 0:24:22,000
like the actual evidence, you know,

600
0:24:23.33,000 --> 0:24:24,000
which would be evidence for strengthening

601
0:24:25.33,000 --> 0:24:27,000
of the tropical circulation in the 1990s.

602
0:24:28.33,000 --> 0:24:29,000
It's a paper that came out in February,

603
0:24:30.33,000 --> 0:24:32,000
and most of you probably hadn't heard about it.

604
0:24:33.33,000 --> 0:24:34,000
"Evidence for Large Decadal Variability

605
0:24:35.33,000 --> 0:24:38,000
in the Tropical Mean Radiative Energy Budget."

606
0:24:39.33,000 --> 0:24:41,000
Excuse me. Those papers were published by NASA,

607
0:24:42.33,000 --> 0:24:44,000
and some scientists at Columbia, and Viliki

608
0:24:44.402,000 --> 0:24:46,000
and a whole bunch of people, Princeton.

609
0:24:47.33,000 --> 0:24:49,000
And those two papers came out in Science Magazine,

610
0:24:50.33,000 --> 0:24:51,000
February the first,

611
0:24:52.33,000 --> 0:24:54,000
and these -- the conclusion in both of these papers,

612
0:24:55.33,000 --> 0:24:57,000
and in also the Science editor's, like,

613
0:24:58.33,000 --> 0:25:,000
descriptions of these papers, for, you know,

614
0:25:00.45,000 --> 0:25:01,000
for the quickie,

615
0:25:02.33,000 --> 0:25:03,000
is that our theories about global warming

616
0:25:04.33,000 --> 0:25:05,000
are completely wrong. I mean,

617
0:25:06.33,000 --> 0:25:07,000
what these guys were doing,

618
0:25:08.33,000 --> 0:25:1,000
and this is what -- the NASA people have been saying this for a long time.

619
0:25:11.33,000 --> 0:25:13,000
They say, if you measure the temperature of the atmosphere, it isn't going up --

620
0:25:14.33,000 --> 0:25:17,000
it's not going up at all. We've doing it very carefully now for 20 years,

621
0:25:17.831,000 --> 0:25:19,000
from satellites, and it isn't going up.

622
0:25:20.33,000 --> 0:25:22,000
And in this paper, they show something much more striking,

623
0:25:23.33,000 --> 0:25:25,000
and that was that they did what they call a radiation --

624
0:25:26.33,000 --> 0:25:28,000
and I'm not going to go into the details of it, actually it's quite complicated,

625
0:25:29.33,000 --> 0:25:31,000
but it isn't as complicated as they might make you think it is

626
0:25:32.33,000 --> 0:25:34,000
by the words they use in those papers. If you really get down to it, they say,

627
0:25:35.33,000 --> 0:25:37,000
the sun puts out a certain amount of energy --

628
0:25:37.545,000 --> 0:25:38,000
we know how much that is --

629
0:25:39.33,000 --> 0:25:41,000
it falls on the earth, the earth gives back a certain amount.

630
0:25:42.259,000 --> 0:25:44,000
When it gets warm it generates --

631
0:25:44.33,000 --> 0:25:46,000
it makes redder energy -- I mean, like infra-red,

632
0:25:47.33,000 --> 0:25:49,000
like something that's warm gives off infra-red.

633
0:25:50.33,000 --> 0:25:52,000
The whole business of the global warming --

634
0:25:52.402,000 --> 0:25:53,000
trash, really,

635
0:25:54.33,000 --> 0:25:57,000
is that -- if the -- if there's too much CO2 in the atmosphere,

636
0:25:57.354,000 --> 0:25:58,000
the heat that's trying to escape

637
0:25:59.33,000 --> 0:26:01,000
won't be able to get out. But the heat coming from the sun,

638
0:26:02.33,000 --> 0:26:04,000
which is mostly down in the -- it's like 350 nanometers,

639
0:26:05.33,000 --> 0:26:07,000
which is where it's centered -- that goes right through CO2.

640
0:26:08.33,000 --> 0:26:09,000
So you still get heated, but you don't dissipate any.

641
0:26:10.33,000 --> 0:26:11,000
Well, these guys measured all of those things.

642
0:26:12.33,000 --> 0:26:13,000
I mean, you can talk about that stuff,

643
0:26:14.33,000 --> 0:26:17,000
and you can write these large reports, and you can get government money to do it,

644
0:26:18.212,000 --> 0:26:2,000
but these -- they actually measured it,

645
0:26:20.33,000 --> 0:26:22,000
and it turns out that in the last 10 years --

646
0:26:22.497,000 --> 0:26:23,000
that's why they say "decadal" there --

647
0:26:24.497,000 --> 0:26:26,000
that the energy -- that the level

648
0:26:27.33,000 --> 0:26:28,000
of what they call "imbalance"

649
0:26:29.33,000 --> 0:26:31,000
has been way the hell over what was expected.

650
0:26:32.33,000 --> 0:26:34,000
Like, the amount of imbalance --

651
0:26:35.33,000 --> 0:26:37,000
meaning, heat's coming in and it's not going out

652
0:26:38.33,000 --> 0:26:4,000
that you would get from having double the CO2,

653
0:26:40.545,000 --> 0:26:42,000
which we're not anywhere near that, by the way.

654
0:26:43.33,000 --> 0:26:44,000
But if we did, in 2025 or something,

655
0:26:45.33,000 --> 0:26:47,000
have double the CO2 as we had in 1900,

656
0:26:48.33,000 --> 0:26:5,000
they say it would be increase the energy budget

657
0:26:50.593,000 --> 0:26:52,000
by about -- in other words,

658
0:26:53.33,000 --> 0:26:54,000
one watt per square centimeter more

659
0:26:55.33,000 --> 0:26:56,000
would be coming in than going out.

660
0:26:57.33,000 --> 0:26:59,000
So the planet should get warmer.

661
0:27:00.33,000 --> 0:27:02,000
Well, they found out in this study -- these two studies

662
0:27:02.974,000 --> 0:27:03,000
by two different teams --

663
0:27:04.33,000 --> 0:27:05,000
that five and a half watts

664
0:27:06.33,000 --> 0:27:07,000
per square meter

665
0:27:08.33,000 --> 0:27:1,000
had been coming in from 1998, 1999,

666
0:27:11.33,000 --> 0:27:12,000
and the place didn't get warmer.

667
0:27:13.33,000 --> 0:27:14,000
So the theory's kaput -- it's nothing.

668
0:27:15.33,000 --> 0:27:16,000
These papers should have been called,

669
0:27:17.33,000 --> 0:27:19,000
"The End to the Global Warming Fiasco," you know.

670
0:27:20.33,000 --> 0:27:21,000
They're concerned,

671
0:27:22.33,000 --> 0:27:24,000
and you can tell they have very guarded conclusions in these papers,

672
0:27:25.33,000 --> 0:27:27,000
because they're talking about big laboratories

673
0:27:27.545,000 --> 0:27:28,000
that are funded by lots of money

674
0:27:29.33,000 --> 0:27:3,000
and by scared people.

675
0:27:31.33,000 --> 0:27:32,000
You know, if they said, you know what?

676
0:27:33.33,000 --> 0:27:34,000
There isn't a problem with global warming any longer,

677
0:27:35.33,000 --> 0:27:36,000
so we can -- you know, they're funding.

678
0:27:37.33,000 --> 0:27:39,000
And if you start a grant request with something like that,

679
0:27:40.33,000 --> 0:27:42,000
and say, global warming obviously hadn't happened...

680
0:27:42.783,000 --> 0:27:43,000
if they -- if they -- if they actually -- if they actually said that,

681
0:27:44.783,000 --> 0:27:45,000
I'm getting out.

682
0:27:46.33,000 --> 0:27:48,000
(Laughter)

683
0:27:49.33,000 --> 0:27:5,000
I'll stand up too, and --

684
0:27:51.33,000 --> 0:27:52,000
(Laughter)

685
0:27:53.33,000 --> 0:27:55,000
(Applause)

686
0:27:56.33,000 --> 0:27:57,000
They have to say that.

687
0:27:58.33,000 --> 0:27:59,000
They had to be very cautious.

688
0:28:00.33,000 --> 0:28:02,000
But what I'm saying is, you can be delighted,

689
0:28:02.497,000 --> 0:28:04,000
because the editor of Science, who is no dummy,

690
0:28:05.33,000 --> 0:28:07,000
and both of these fairly professional --

691
0:28:08.33,000 --> 0:28:1,000
really professional teams, have really come to the same conclusion

692
0:28:11.33,000 --> 0:28:12,000
and in the bottom lines in their papers

693
0:28:13.33,000 --> 0:28:15,000
they have to say, what this means is, that what we've been thinking,

694
0:28:16.33,000 --> 0:28:18,000
was the global circulation model that we predict

695
0:28:18.593,000 --> 0:28:19,000
that the earth is going to get overheated

696
0:28:20.593,000 --> 0:28:22,000
that it's all wrong. It's wrong by a large factor.

697
0:28:23.33,000 --> 0:28:25,000
It's not by a small one. They just --

698
0:28:26.33,000 --> 0:28:28,000
they just misinterpreted the fact that the earth --

699
0:28:29.33,000 --> 0:28:31,000
there's obviously some mechanisms going on

700
0:28:31.354,000 --> 0:28:32,000
that nobody knew about,

701
0:28:33.33,000 --> 0:28:34,000
because the heat's coming in and it isn't getting warmer.

702
0:28:35.33,000 --> 0:28:37,000
So the planet is a pretty amazing thing, you know,

703
0:28:38.33,000 --> 0:28:39,000
it's big and horrible -- and big and wonderful,

704
0:28:40.33,000 --> 0:28:42,000
and it does all kinds of things we don't know anything about.

705
0:28:43.33,000 --> 0:28:44,000
So I mean, the reason I put those things all together,

706
0:28:45.33,000 --> 0:28:46,000
OK, here's the way you're supposed to do science --

707
0:28:47.33,000 --> 0:28:49,000
some science is done for other reasons, and just curiosity.

708
0:28:50.33,000 --> 0:28:52,000
And there's a lot of things like global warming,

709
0:28:52.64,000 --> 0:28:53,000
and ozone hole and you know,

710
0:28:54.33,000 --> 0:28:56,000
a whole bunch of scientific public issues,

711
0:28:56.354,000 --> 0:28:57,000
that if you're interested in them,

712
0:28:58.33,000 --> 0:29:01,000
then you have to get down the details, and read the papers called,

713
0:29:01.45,000 --> 0:29:02,000
"Large Decadal Variability in the..."

714
0:29:03.33,000 --> 0:29:05,000
You have to figure out what all those words mean.

715
0:29:05.64,000 --> 0:29:06,000
And if you just listen to the guys

716
0:29:07.33,000 --> 0:29:09,000
who are hyping those issues, and making a lot of money out of it,

717
0:29:10.33,000 --> 0:29:13,000
you'll be misinformed, and you'll be worrying about the wrong things.

718
0:29:13.64,000 --> 0:29:16,000
Remember the 10 things that are going to get you. The -- one of them --

719
0:29:17.045,000 --> 0:29:18,000
(Laughter)

720
0:29:18.33,000 --> 0:29:2,000
And the asteroids is the one I really agree with there.

721
0:29:21.33,000 --> 0:29:24,000
I mean, you've got to watch out for asteroids. OK, thank you for having me here.

722
0:29:25.164,000 --> 0:29:28,000
(Applause)

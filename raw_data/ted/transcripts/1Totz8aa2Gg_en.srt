1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
If you go on the TED website,

2
0:00:19.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
you can currently find there

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
over a full week of TEDTalk videos,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
over 1.3 million

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
words of transcripts

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and millions of user ratings.

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And that's a huge amount of data.

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And it got me wondering:

9
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
If you took all this data

10
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
and put it through statistical analysis,

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk?

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Could you create

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
the ultimate TEDTalk?

14
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

15
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
And also, could you create

16
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
the worst possible TEDTalk

17
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
that they would still let you get away with?

18
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
To find this out, I looked at three things:

19
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I looked at the topic that you should choose,

20
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
I looked at how you should deliver it

21
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and the visuals onstage.

22
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Now, with the topic: There's a whole range of topics you can choose,

23
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
but you should choose wisely,

24
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
because your topic strongly correlates

25
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
with how users will react to your talk.

26
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Now, to make this more concrete,

27
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
let's look at the list of top 10 words

28
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that statistically stick out

29
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
in the most favorite TEDTalks

30
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and in the least favorite TEDTalks.

31
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So if you came here

32
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
to talk about how French coffee

33
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
will spread happiness in our brains,

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
that's a go.

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Whereas, if you wanted to talk about

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
your project involving

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
oxygen, girls, aircraft --

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
actually, I would like to hear that talk, (Laughter)

40
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
but statistics say it's not so good.

41
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
Oh, well.

42
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
If you generalize this,

43
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
the most favorite TEDTalks are those

44
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
that feature topics we can connect with,

45
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
both easily and deeply,

46
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
such as happiness, our own body,

47
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
food, emotions.

48
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:02,000
And the more technical topics,

49
0:02:02.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
such as architecture, materials and, strangely enough, men,

50
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
those are not good topics to talk about.

51
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
How should you deliver your talk?

52
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
TED is famous for keeping

53
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
a very sharp eye on the clock,

54
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
so they're going to hate me

55
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
for revealing this, because, actually,

56
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
you should talk as long as they will let you. (Laughter)

57
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Because the most favorite TEDTalks

58
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
are, on average, over 50 percent longer

59
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
than the least favorite ones.

60
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com

61
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
except if you want to have a talk

62
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
that's beautiful, inspiring or funny.

63
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Then, you should be brief. (Laughter) But other than that,

64
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
talk until they drag you off the stage.

65
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
(Laughter)

66
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Now, while ...

67
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
(Applause)

68
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
While you're pushing the clock, there's a few rules to obey.

69
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I found these rules out by comparing the statistics

70
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
of four-word phrases

71
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks

72
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks.

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I'll give you three examples.

74
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
First of all, I must, as a speaker,

75
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you,

76
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
instead of saying what I can't have.

77
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Secondly, it's imperative

78
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
that you do not cite The New York Times.

79
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

80
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And finally, it's okay for the speaker -- that's the good news --

81
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to fake intellectual capacity.

82
0:03:21.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
If I don't understand something, I can just say, "etc., etc."

83
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
You'll all stay with me.

84
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It's perfectly fine.

85
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
(Applause)

86
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now, let's go to the visuals.

87
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker.

88
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And analysis shows if you want to be

89
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
among the most favorite TED speakers,

90
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average,

91
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up

92
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
than the average TED speaker.

93
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Slides are okay, though you might consider going for props.

94
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And now the most important thing,

95
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that is the mood onstage.

96
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Color plays a very important role.

97
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
Color closely correlates

98
0:04:00.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
with the ratings that talks get on the website.

99
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
(Applause)

100
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
For example, fascinating talks

101
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
contain a statistically high amount

102
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
of exactly this blue color, (Laughter)

103
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:13,000
much more than the average TEDTalk.

104
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Ingenious TEDTalks, much more this green color,

105
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:17,000
etc., et.

106
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
(Laughter) (Applause)

107
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Now, personally, I think

108
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I'm not the first one who has done this analysis,

109
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
but I'll leave this

110
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
to your good judgment.

111
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
So, now it's time to put it all together

112
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and design the ultimate TEDTalk.

113
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Now, since this is TEDActive,

114
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and I learned from my analysis

115
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
that I should actually give you something,

116
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
I will not impose the ultimate

117
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
or worst TEDTalk on you,

118
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but rather give you a tool to create your own.

119
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And I call this tool the TEDPad.

120
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

121
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And the TEDPad is a matrix

122
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
of 100 specifically selected,

123
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
highly curated sentences

124
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk.

125
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
You only have to make one decision,

126
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and that is: Are you going to use the white version

127
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
for very good TEDTalks,

128
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
about creativity, human genius?

129
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Or are you going to go with a black version,

130
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks,

131
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
mostly about blogs,

132
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
politics and stuff?

133
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So, download it and have fun with it.

134
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Now I hope you enjoy the session.

135
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
I hope you enjoy designing your own

136
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks.

137
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year

138
0:05:35.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
to create this, which I really want to see.

139
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Thank you very much.

140
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
(Applause) Thanks.

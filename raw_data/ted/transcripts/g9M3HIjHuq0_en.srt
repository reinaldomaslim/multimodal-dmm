1
0:00:12.64,000 --> 0:00:15,000
So when I decided to create an art piece in Manshiyat Naser,

2
0:00:16.4,000 --> 0:00:18,000
the neighborhood of the Cairo garbage collectors in Egypt,

3
0:00:19.4,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I never thought this project would be

4
0:00:21.24,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the most amazing human experience that I would ever live.

5
0:00:24.64,000 --> 0:00:26,000
As an artist, I had this humanist intention

6
0:00:27.36,000 --> 0:00:29,000
of beautifying a poor and neglected neighborhood

7
0:00:29.76,000 --> 0:00:34,000
by bringing art to it and hopefully shining light on this isolated community.

8
0:00:36,000 --> 0:00:39,000
The first time I heard about this Christian Coptic community

9
0:00:39.64,000 --> 0:00:44,000
was in 2009 when the Egyptian authorities under the regime of Hosni Mubarak

10
0:00:45.08,000 --> 0:00:5,000
decided to slaughter 300,000 pigs using the pretext of H1N1 virus.

11
0:00:51.56,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Originally, they are pig breeders.

12
0:00:53.52,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Their pigs and other animals are fed with the organic waste

13
0:00:56.72,000 --> 0:00:57,000
that they collect on a daily basis.

14
0:00:58.72,000 --> 0:00:59,000
This event killed their livelihood.

15
0:01:01.08,000 --> 0:01:04,000
The first time I entered Manshiyat Naser, it felt like a maze.

16
0:01:04.56,000 --> 0:01:07,000
I was looking for the St. Simon Monastery on the top of the Muqattam Mountain.

17
0:01:08.28,000 --> 0:01:11,000
So you go right, then straight, then right again, then left

18
0:01:11.48,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to reach all the way to the top.

19
0:01:13.2,000 --> 0:01:17,000
But to reach there, you must dodge between the trucks overpacked with garbage

20
0:01:17.64,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and slalom between the tuk-tuks,

21
0:01:19.24,000 --> 0:01:22,000
the fastest vehicle to move around in the neighborhood.

22
0:01:23.04,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The smell of the garbage unloaded from those trucks was intense,

23
0:01:26.2,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and the noise of the traffic was loud and overbearing.

24
0:01:29.6,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Add to it the din created by the crushers in those warehouses along the way.

25
0:01:34.92,000 --> 0:01:38,000
From outside it looks chaotic, but everything is perfectly organized.

26
0:01:40.6,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The Zaraeeb, that’s how they call themselves,

27
0:01:43.08,000 --> 0:01:44,000
which means the pig breeders,

28
0:01:44.64,000 --> 0:01:46,000
have been collecting the garbage of Cairo

29
0:01:47.04,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and sorting it in their own neighborhood for decades.

30
0:01:49.84,000 --> 0:01:51,000
They have developed one of the most efficient

31
0:01:52,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and highly profitable systems on a global level.

32
0:01:55.32,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Still, the place is perceived as dirty, marginalized and segregated

33
0:01:59.96,000 --> 0:02:01,000
because of their association with the trash.

34
0:02:03.08,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So my initial idea was to create an anamorphic piece,

35
0:02:05.96,000 --> 0:02:07,000
a piece that you can only see from one vantage point.

36
0:02:08.84,000 --> 0:02:12,000
I wanted to challenge myself artistically by painting over several buildings

37
0:02:13.2,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and having it only fully visible from one point on the Muqattam Mountain.

38
0:02:18.36,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The Muqattam Mountain is the pride of the community.

39
0:02:20.96,000 --> 0:02:22,000
This is where they built the St. Simon Monastery,

40
0:02:23.44,000 --> 0:02:28,000
a 10,000-seat cave church that they carved into the mountain itself.

41
0:02:29.2,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So, the first time I stood on top of the mountain

42
0:02:33.28,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and I looked at the neighborhood,

43
0:02:34.92,000 --> 0:02:36,000
I asked myself, how on earth will I convince all those owners

44
0:02:37.84,000 --> 0:02:39,000
to let me paint on their buildings?

45
0:02:40.04,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And then Magd came.

46
0:02:41.44,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Magd is a guide from the Church.

47
0:02:43.84,000 --> 0:02:47,000
He told me the only person I needed to convince was Father Samaan,

48
0:02:47.96,000 --> 0:02:49,000
who is the leader of the community.

49
0:02:50.44,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But to convince Father Samaan, I needed to convince Mario,

50
0:02:53.68,000 --> 0:02:56,000
who is a Polish artist who moved to Cairo 20 years ago

51
0:02:56.76,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and who created all the artwork of the Cave Church.

52
0:03:00.6,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I am really grateful to Mario. He was the key of the project.

53
0:03:04.28,000 --> 0:03:06,000
He managed to get me a meeting with Father Samaan,

54
0:03:06.68,000 --> 0:03:07,000
and surprisingly, he loved the idea.

55
0:03:08.44,000 --> 0:03:1,000
He asked me about where I painted before

56
0:03:10.72,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and how I will make it happen.

57
0:03:12.2,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And he was mainly concerned by what I was going to write.

58
0:03:16.76,000 --> 0:03:18,000
In every work that I create, I write messages

59
0:03:18.92,000 --> 0:03:19,000
with my style of Arabic calligraphy.

60
0:03:20.72,000 --> 0:03:23,000
I make sure those messages are relevant to the place where I am painting

61
0:03:24.48,000 --> 0:03:25,000
but have this universal dimension,

62
0:03:26.124,000 --> 0:03:28,000
so anybody around the world can relate to it.

63
0:03:29.56,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So for Manshiyat Naser,

64
0:03:30.84,000 --> 0:03:34,000
I decided to write in Arabic the words of St. Athanasius of Alexandria,

65
0:03:35.64,000 --> 0:03:36,000
a Coptic bishop from the third century,

66
0:03:37.6,000 --> 0:03:41,000
who said: (Arabic),

67
0:03:42.2,000 --> 0:03:43,000
which means in English,

68
0:03:43.48,000 --> 0:03:45,000
"Anyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly

69
0:03:45.64,000 --> 0:03:46,000
needs to wipe his eyes first."

70
0:03:47.8,000 --> 0:03:48,000
It was really important for me

71
0:03:49.6,000 --> 0:03:51,000
that the community felt connected to the words.

72
0:03:52.52,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And for me this quote was perfectly reflecting the spirit of the project.

73
0:03:56.48,000 --> 0:03:58,000
So Father Samaan blessed the project,

74
0:03:58.92,000 --> 0:04:,000
and his approval brought all the residents on board.

75
0:04:02.64,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Hundreds of liters of paint, a dozen blue manual lifts,

76
0:04:06.96,000 --> 0:04:08,000
several trips back and forth to Cairo,

77
0:04:09.12,000 --> 0:04:13,000
a strong and solid team from France, North Africa, Middle East and the US,

78
0:04:13.28,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and after a year of planning and logistics, there we are,

79
0:04:16.76,000 --> 0:04:18,000
my team and some members from the local community

80
0:04:19.4,000 --> 0:04:22,000
creating a piece that will spread over 50 buildings,

81
0:04:22.92,000 --> 0:04:24,000
some filling up the space of the calligraphy

82
0:04:25.84,000 --> 0:04:26,000
that I trace with colors.

83
0:04:27.28,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Here some blue, there some yellow, there some orange.

84
0:04:30.36,000 --> 0:04:32,000
Some others carrying some sand bags

85
0:04:32.519,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and putting them on the top of the buildings

86
0:04:34.64,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to hold those manual lifts,

87
0:04:36,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and some others assembling and disassembling those same lifts

88
0:04:38.92,000 --> 0:04:4,000
and moving them around the different buildings.

89
0:04:42.2,000 --> 0:04:43,000
At the beginning of the project,

90
0:04:43.92,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I numbered all those buildings on my sketch,

91
0:04:47.6,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and there was no real interaction with the community.

92
0:04:50.12,000 --> 0:04:52,000
People didn’t get the point of all this.

93
0:04:52.28,000 --> 0:04:56,000
But fast enough, those building numbers became family names.

94
0:04:56.8,000 --> 0:04:58,000
The first building was the house of Uncle Ibrahim.

95
0:05:00.04,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Uncle Ibrahim is such an enthusiastic person.

96
0:05:02.2,000 --> 0:05:04,000
He was always singing and making jokes,

97
0:05:04.28,000 --> 0:05:08,000
and his daughters and sons saved me from his bull

98
0:05:08.64,000 --> 0:05:1,000
who wanted to attack me on the fourth floor.

99
0:05:11.12,000 --> 0:05:12,000
(Laughter)

100
0:05:12.44,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Actually, the bull saw me from the window and came out on the balcony.

101
0:05:15.76,000 --> 0:05:16,000
(Laughter)

102
0:05:17.12,000 --> 0:05:18,000
Yeah.

103
0:05:21.68,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Uncle Ibrahim was always hanging out on the balcony

104
0:05:24.36,000 --> 0:05:25,000
and talking to me while I was painting.

105
0:05:26.36,000 --> 0:05:29,000
I remember him saying that he didn’t go to the mountain for 10 years,

106
0:05:30.36,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and that he never takes a day off.

107
0:05:32.2,000 --> 0:05:35,000
He said that if he stopped working, who will stop the garbage?

108
0:05:36,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But surprisingly, at the end of the project,

109
0:05:39.44,000 --> 0:05:41,000
he came all the way to the mountain to look at the piece.

110
0:05:42.28,000 --> 0:05:44,000
He was really proud to see his house painted,

111
0:05:45.08,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and he said that this project was a project of peace and --

112
0:05:50.4,000 --> 0:05:51,000
sorry --

113
0:05:53,000 --> 0:05:55,000
(Applause)

114
0:06:06.4,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Thank you.

115
0:06:08.32,000 --> 0:06:12,000
He said that it was a project of peace and unity

116
0:06:13.32,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and that it brought people together.

117
0:06:15.68,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So his perception towards the project changed,

118
0:06:18.92,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and my perception towards the community changed also,

119
0:06:22.84,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and towards what they do.

120
0:06:24.8,000 --> 0:06:28,000
All the garbage that everybody is disgusted by is not theirs.

121
0:06:29.44,000 --> 0:06:3,000
They just work out of it.

122
0:06:30.96,000 --> 0:06:33,000
Actually, they don’t live in the garbage. They live from the garbage.

123
0:06:34.24,000 --> 0:06:36,000
So I started doubting myself and wondering

124
0:06:36.48,000 --> 0:06:39,000
what was the real purpose of this whole project?

125
0:06:40.28,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It was not about beautifying a place by bringing art to it.

126
0:06:44.4,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It was about switching perception and opening a dialogue

127
0:06:47.48,000 --> 0:06:5,000
on the connection that we have with communities that we don’t know.

128
0:06:51.52,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So day after day,

129
0:06:52.8,000 --> 0:06:54,000
the calligraphy circle was taking shape,

130
0:06:55.2,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and we were always excited to go back on the mountain to look at the piece.

131
0:06:59.28,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And standing exactly at this point every day made my realize

132
0:07:02.44,000 --> 0:07:04,000
the symbolism behind this anamorphic piece.

133
0:07:05.28,000 --> 0:07:07,000
If you want to see the real image of somebody,

134
0:07:07.48,000 --> 0:07:08,000
maybe you should change your angle.

135
0:07:10.44,000 --> 0:07:11,000
There was doubts and difficulties,

136
0:07:12.28,000 --> 0:07:13,000
like fears and stress.

137
0:07:13.56,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It wasn't simple to work in such environments,

138
0:07:15.76,000 --> 0:07:17,000
sometimes having pigs under you while you paint

139
0:07:18,000 --> 0:07:2,000
or climbing a stack of garbage to reach a lift.

140
0:07:20.84,000 --> 0:07:23,000
But we all got over the fear of the heights, the swinging lifts,

141
0:07:24.2,000 --> 0:07:25,000
the strength of the smell

142
0:07:25.48,000 --> 0:07:27,000
and also the stress of not finishing on time.

143
0:07:27.64,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But the kindness of all those people made us forget everything.

144
0:07:31.6,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The building number 3 was the house of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda.

145
0:07:35.8,000 --> 0:07:38,000
In Egyptian, they have this expression that says, "Ahsen Nas,"

146
0:07:39.08,000 --> 0:07:4,000
which means "the best people."

147
0:07:40.64,000 --> 0:07:41,000
They were the best people.

148
0:07:41.92,000 --> 0:07:44,000
We used to take our break in front of their houses,

149
0:07:45.08,000 --> 0:07:47,000
and all the kids of the neighborhood

150
0:07:47.48,000 --> 0:07:48,000
used to join us.

151
0:07:48.84,000 --> 0:07:52,000
I was impressed and amazed by the kids of Manshiyat Naser.

152
0:07:53.2,000 --> 0:07:57,000
For the first few days, they were always refusing anything we were offering them,

153
0:07:57.36,000 --> 0:07:59,000
even a snack or a drink.

154
0:07:59.44,000 --> 0:08:,000
So I asked Aunty Fareeda, "Why is that?"

155
0:08:01.4,000 --> 0:08:04,000
And she told me they teach their kids to refuse anything

156
0:08:05.28,000 --> 0:08:06,000
from somebody that they don't know

157
0:08:06.96,000 --> 0:08:08,000
because maybe this person needs it more than they do.

158
0:08:10.88,000 --> 0:08:14,000
So at this exact point I realized actually

159
0:08:14.92,000 --> 0:08:16,000
the Zaraeeb community was the ideal context

160
0:08:17.08,000 --> 0:08:18,000
to raise the topic of perception.

161
0:08:19.24,000 --> 0:08:22,000
We need to question our level of misconception

162
0:08:22.56,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and judgment we can have as a society

163
0:08:25.24,000 --> 0:08:27,000
upon communities based on their differences.

164
0:08:28.96,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I remember how we got delayed on Uncle Ibrahim's house

165
0:08:32.44,000 --> 0:08:34,000
when his pigs that are bred on the rooftop

166
0:08:34.6,000 --> 0:08:36,000
were eating the sand bags that hold the lifts.

167
0:08:37.2,000 --> 0:08:38,000
(Laughter)

168
0:08:39.64,000 --> 0:08:41,000
The house of Uncle Bakheet and Aunty Fareeda

169
0:08:42.6,000 --> 0:08:43,000
was this kind of meeting point.

170
0:08:44.28,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Everybody used to gather there.

171
0:08:46.159,000 --> 0:08:47,000
I think this is what Uncle Ibrahim meant

172
0:08:48.12,000 --> 0:08:5,000
when he said that was a project of peace and unity,

173
0:08:50.76,000 --> 0:08:52,000
because I really felt that people were coming together.

174
0:08:54.32,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Everyone was greeting us with a smile, offering us a drink

175
0:08:57.52,000 --> 0:09:01,000
or inviting us into their own house for lunch.

176
0:09:01.56,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Sometime, you are at the first level of a building,

177
0:09:04.6,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and somebody opens his window and offers you some tea.

178
0:09:07.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And then the same thing happens on the second floor.

179
0:09:09.64,000 --> 0:09:11,000
And you keep going all the way to the top.

180
0:09:11.68,000 --> 0:09:12,000
(Laughter)

181
0:09:12.92,000 --> 0:09:13,000
(Applause)

182
0:09:14.4,000 --> 0:09:16,000
I think I never drink as much tea as I did in Egypt.

183
0:09:16.88,000 --> 0:09:17,000
(Laughter)

184
0:09:18.72,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And to be honest with you, we could have finished earlier,

185
0:09:21.48,000 --> 0:09:24,000
but I think it took us three weeks because of all those tea breaks.

186
0:09:24.68,000 --> 0:09:25,000
(Laughter)

187
0:09:28.52,000 --> 0:09:31,000
In Egypt, they have another expression, which is "Nawartouna,"

188
0:09:32.08,000 --> 0:09:34,000
which means, "You brought light to us."

189
0:09:35.2,000 --> 0:09:37,000
In Manshiyat Naser they were always telling us this.

190
0:09:38.12,000 --> 0:09:4,000
The calligraphy, actually --

191
0:09:40.28,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I used a white glow-in-the-dark paint for the calligraphy

192
0:09:44.36,000 --> 0:09:48,000
so at the end of the project, we rented some black light projectors

193
0:09:48.56,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and lit up the whole neighborhood,

194
0:09:50.96,000 --> 0:09:51,000
surprising everybody around.

195
0:09:52.36,000 --> 0:09:53,000
We wanted to tell them

196
0:09:53.64,000 --> 0:09:55,000
that they are the ones who brought light to us.

197
0:09:58.28,000 --> 0:10:,000
(Applause)

198
0:10:09,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The Zaraeeb community are strong, honest, hard workers,

199
0:10:13.08,000 --> 0:10:14,000
and they know their value.

200
0:10:14.84,000 --> 0:10:16,000
The people of Cairo call them "the Zabaleen,"

201
0:10:17,000 --> 0:10:18,000
which means "the people of the garbage,"

202
0:10:19,000 --> 0:10:21,000
but ironically, the people of Manshiyat Naser

203
0:10:21.76,000 --> 0:10:22,000
call the people of Cairo the Zabaleen.

204
0:10:23.64,000 --> 0:10:25,000
They say, they are the ones who produce the garbage, not them.

205
0:10:26.6,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

206
0:10:27.84,000 --> 0:10:28,000
(Applause)

207
0:10:29.24,000 --> 0:10:31,000
The goal was to leave something to this community,

208
0:10:31.64,000 --> 0:10:34,000
but I feel that they are the ones who left something in our lives.

209
0:10:34.8,000 --> 0:10:36,000
You know, the art project was just a pretext

210
0:10:36.92,000 --> 0:10:37,000
for this amazing human experience.

211
0:10:38.6,000 --> 0:10:4,000
The art piece at some point will disappear, vanish,

212
0:10:41.04,000 --> 0:10:43,000
and actually there is somebody who is building a second floor

213
0:10:43.96,000 --> 0:10:44,000
in front of Uncle Ibrahim's house,

214
0:10:45.64,000 --> 0:10:46,000
so it's covering part of the painting,

215
0:10:47.52,000 --> 0:10:49,000
so I might need to go back and paint over it.

216
0:10:49.68,000 --> 0:10:5,000
(Laughter)

217
0:10:51.32,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It was about the experience,

218
0:10:52.72,000 --> 0:10:53,000
about the story,

219
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:55,000
about the moment.

220
0:10:56.56,000 --> 0:10:57,000
From the streets of the neighborhood,

221
0:10:58.48,000 --> 0:10:59,000
the painting appears in fragments,

222
0:11:00.124,000 --> 0:11:01,000
isolated from one another,

223
0:11:02.04,000 --> 0:11:03,000
standing alone.

224
0:11:03.32,000 --> 0:11:05,000
But connected with the sign of calligraphy

225
0:11:05.52,000 --> 0:11:08,000
that today reveals the powerful message that we should all think about

226
0:11:09.4,000 --> 0:11:1,000
before we want to judge somebody.

227
0:11:11.64,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Anyone who wants to see the sunlight clearly

228
0:11:13.8,000 --> 0:11:14,000
needs to wipe his eyes first.

229
0:11:15.76,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Thank you.

230
0:11:17.2,000 --> 0:11:24,000
(Applause)

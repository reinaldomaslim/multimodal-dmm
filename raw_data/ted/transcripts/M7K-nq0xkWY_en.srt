1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Let's talk trash.

2
0:00:14.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
You know, we had to be taught

3
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
to renounce the powerful conservation ethic

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:23,000
we developed during the Great Depression and World War II.

5
0:00:23.16,000 --> 0:00:26,000
After the war, we needed to direct our enormous production capacity

6
0:00:26.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
toward creation of products for peacetime.

7
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Life Magazine helped in this effort

8
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
by announcing the introduction of throwaways

9
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:38,000
that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes.

10
0:00:38.16,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Mental note to the liberators:

11
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:43,000
throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don't biodegrade.

12
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Only we humans make waste that nature can't digest.

13
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Plastics are also hard to recycle.

14
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:54,000
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent

15
0:00:54.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
of plastics recovered in our waste stream.

16
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
It's diddly-point-squat.

17
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
That's the percentage we recycle.

18
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Now, melting point has a lot to do with this.

19
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal.

20
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
It begins to melt below the boiling point of water

21
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and does not drive off the oily contaminants

22
0:01:18.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
for which it is a sponge.

23
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Half of each year's 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets

24
0:01:24.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
will be made into fast-track trash.

25
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
A large, unruly fraction of our trash

26
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:33,000
will flow downriver to the sea.

27
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport.

28
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach

29
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and the diesel plant we visited yesterday.

30
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
In spite of deposit fees,

31
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:48,000
much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles.

32
0:01:48.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes,

33
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:55,000
here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan,

34
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail.

35
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Here is a remote island repository for bottles

36
0:02:05.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
off the coast of Baja California.

37
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery

38
0:02:10.16,000 --> 0:02:12,000
off Baja's sparsely populated central coast.

39
0:02:12.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them.

40
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate, PET,

41
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization.

42
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Also, the caps are produced in separate factories

43
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:28,000
from a different plastic, polypropylene.

44
0:02:28.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
They will float in seawater,

45
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills.

46
0:02:34.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Let's trace the journey of the millions of caps

47
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:39,000
that make it to sea solo.

48
0:02:39.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific,

49
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:45,000
while ours get caught in the California current

50
0:02:45.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas.

51
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:51,000
After ten years, a lot of the Japanese caps

52
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:53,000
are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch,

53
0:02:53.16,000 --> 0:02:55,000
while ours litter the Philippines.

54
0:02:55.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
After 20 years, we see emerging the debris accumulation zone

55
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
of the North Pacific Gyre.

56
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
It so happens that millions of albatross

57
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
nesting on Kure and Midway atolls

58
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument

59
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
forage here and scavenge whatever they can find

60
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
for regurgitation to their chicks.

61
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
A four-month old Laysan Albatross chick

62
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:19,000
died with this in its stomach.

63
0:03:19.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying

64
0:03:24.16,000 --> 0:03:27,000
with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish,

65
0:03:27.16,000 --> 0:03:3,000
like cigarette lighters ...

66
0:03:30.16,000 --> 0:03:33,000
but, mostly bottle caps.

67
0:03:33.16,000 --> 0:03:36,000
Sadly, their parents mistake bottle caps for food

68
0:03:36.16,000 --> 0:03:39,000
tossing about in the ocean surface.

69
0:03:39.16,000 --> 0:03:41,000
The retainer rings for the caps

70
0:03:41.16,000 --> 0:03:44,000
also have consequences for aquatic animals.

71
0:03:44.16,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This is Mae West,

72
0:03:46.16,000 --> 0:03:49,000
still alive at a zookeeper's home in New Orleans.

73
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem,

74
0:03:53.16,000 --> 0:03:56,000
so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005

75
0:03:56.16,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I went to the Long Beach Peninsula, at the east end of our long beach.

76
0:03:59.16,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown.

77
0:04:02.16,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I offered five cents each for bottle caps.

78
0:04:05.16,000 --> 0:04:07,000
I got plenty of takers.

79
0:04:07.16,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected.

80
0:04:10.16,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I thought I would spend 20 bucks.

81
0:04:13.16,000 --> 0:04:16,000
That day I ended up spending nearly 60.

82
0:04:16.16,000 --> 0:04:18,000
I separated them by color

83
0:04:18.16,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and put them on display the next Earth Day

84
0:04:20.16,000 --> 0:04:22,000
at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro.

85
0:04:22.16,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display.

86
0:04:26.16,000 --> 0:04:29,000
In spite of my "girly man" hat, crocheted from plastic shopping bags,

87
0:04:29.16,000 --> 0:04:31,000
they shook my hand. (Laughter)

88
0:04:33.16,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl

89
0:04:36.16,000 --> 0:04:39,000
from the gyre north of Hawaii

90
0:04:39.16,000 --> 0:04:41,000
with more plastic than plankton.

91
0:04:41.16,000 --> 0:04:46,000
Here's what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like.

92
0:04:46.16,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile

93
0:04:49.16,000 --> 0:04:52,000
produces samples like this.

94
0:04:52.16,000 --> 0:04:55,000
And this.

95
0:04:55.16,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Now, when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii

96
0:04:58.16,000 --> 0:05:,000
it looks like this.

97
0:05:00.16,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach,

98
0:05:02.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington.

99
0:05:05.16,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Now, how do we analyze samples like this one

100
0:05:08.16,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that contain more plastic than plankton?

101
0:05:11.16,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes,

102
0:05:14.16,000 --> 0:05:17,000
from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter.

103
0:05:17.16,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants

104
0:05:21.16,000 --> 0:05:24,000
up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater.

105
0:05:25.16,000 --> 0:05:28,000
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean,

106
0:05:28.16,000 --> 0:05:3,000
at the base of the food chain,

107
0:05:30.16,000 --> 0:05:32,000
was ingesting these poison pills.

108
0:05:32.16,000 --> 0:05:35,000
We did hundreds of necropsies,

109
0:05:35.16,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs.

110
0:05:38.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
The record-holder, only two-and-a-half inches long,

111
0:05:41.16,000 --> 0:05:44,000
had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach.

112
0:05:44.16,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Now, you can buy certified organic produce.

113
0:05:47.16,000 --> 0:05:5,000
But no fishmonger on Earth

114
0:05:50.16,000 --> 0:05:55,000
can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish.

115
0:05:55.16,000 --> 0:06:,000
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations.

116
0:06:00.16,000 --> 0:06:03,000
The throwaway society cannot be contained --

117
0:06:03.16,000 --> 0:06:06,000
it has gone global.

118
0:06:06.16,000 --> 0:06:09,000
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff.

119
0:06:09.16,000 --> 0:06:11,000
We have to throw it away.

120
0:06:11.16,000 --> 0:06:14,000
Now, the market can do a lot for us,

121
0:06:14.16,000 --> 0:06:17,000
but it can't fix the natural system in the ocean we've broken.

122
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:2,000
All the king's horses and all the king's men ...

123
0:06:20.16,000 --> 0:06:24,000
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again.

124
0:06:26.16,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Narrator (Video): The levels are increasing,

125
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
the amount of packaging is increasing,

126
0:06:30.16,000 --> 0:06:33,000
the "throwaway" concept of living is proliferating,

127
0:06:33.16,000 --> 0:06:36,000
and it's showing up in the ocean.

128
0:06:36.16,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Anchor: He offers no hope of cleaning it up.

129
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:42,000
Straining the ocean for plastic

130
0:06:42.16,000 --> 0:06:45,000
would be beyond the budget of any country

131
0:06:45.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process.

132
0:06:48.16,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The solution, Moore says, is to stop the plastic at its source:

133
0:06:51.16,000 --> 0:06:55,000
stop it on land before it falls in the ocean.

134
0:06:58.16,000 --> 0:07:01,000
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world,

135
0:07:01.16,000 --> 0:07:04,000
he doesn't hold out much hope for that, either.

136
0:07:04.16,000 --> 0:07:06,000
This is Brian Rooney for Nightline,

137
0:07:06.16,000 --> 0:07:08,000
in Long Beach, California.

138
0:07:12.16,000 --> 0:07:14,000
Charles Moore: Thank you.

0:00:16.748,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The most massive

3
0:00:20.317,000 --> 0:00:24,000
tsunami perfect storm

4
0:00:25.252,000 --> 0:00:28,000
is bearing down upon us.

5
0:00:29.131,000 --> 0:00:32,000
This perfect storm

6
0:00:32.377,000 --> 0:00:37,000
is mounting a grim reality, increasingly grim reality,

7
0:00:37.545,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and we are facing that reality

8
0:00:42.495,000 --> 0:00:43,000
with the full belief

9
0:00:43.876,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that we can solve our problems with technology,

10
0:00:46.432,000 --> 0:00:48,000
and that's very understandable.

11
0:00:48.728,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Now, this perfect storm that we are facing

12
0:00:52.935,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is the result of our rising population,

13
0:00:56.445,000 --> 0:00:58,000
rising towards 10 billion people,

14
0:00:59.249,000 --> 0:01:01,000
land that is turning to desert,

15
0:01:01.893,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and, of course, climate change.

16
0:01:05.001,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Now there's no question about it at all:

17
0:01:07.662,000 --> 0:01:08,000
we will only solve the problem

18
0:01:09.473,000 --> 0:01:12,000
of replacing fossil fuels with technology.

19
0:01:12.985,000 --> 0:01:15,000
But fossil fuels, carbon -- coal and gas --

20
0:01:16.113,000 --> 0:01:18,000
are by no means the only thing

21
0:01:18.234,000 --> 0:01:22,000
that is causing climate change.

22
0:01:22.352,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Desertification

23
0:01:24.235,000 --> 0:01:29,000
is a fancy word for land that is turning to desert,

24
0:01:29.561,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and this happens only when

25
0:01:31.862,000 --> 0:01:33,000
we create too much bare ground.

26
0:01:33.871,000 --> 0:01:35,000
There's no other cause.

27
0:01:35.877,000 --> 0:01:37,000
And I intend to focus

28
0:01:37.895,000 --> 0:01:41,000
on most of the world's land that is turning to desert.

29
0:01:42.801,000 --> 0:01:47,000
But I have for you a very simple message

30
0:01:48.094,000 --> 0:01:52,000
that offers more hope than you can imagine.

31
0:01:52.29,000 --> 0:01:54,000
We have environments

32
0:01:54.358,000 --> 0:01:57,000
where humidity is guaranteed throughout the year.

33
0:01:57.602,000 --> 0:01:59,000
On those, it is almost impossible

34
0:02:00.106,000 --> 0:02:02,000
to create vast areas of bare ground.

35
0:02:02.895,000 --> 0:02:05,000
No matter what you do, nature covers it up so quickly.

36
0:02:06.517,000 --> 0:02:07,000
And we have environments

37
0:02:08.264,000 --> 0:02:1,000
where we have months of humidity

38
0:02:10.957,000 --> 0:02:11,000
followed by months of dryness,

39
0:02:12.735,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and that is where desertification is occurring.

40
0:02:16.213,000 --> 0:02:18,000
Fortunately, with space technology now,

41
0:02:18.269,000 --> 0:02:19,000
we can look at it from space,

42
0:02:19.946,000 --> 0:02:23,000
and when we do, you can see the proportions fairly well.

43
0:02:24.21,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Generally, what you see in green

44
0:02:25.833,000 --> 0:02:26,000
is not desertifying,

45
0:02:27.688,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and what you see in brown is,

46
0:02:29.994,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and these are by far the greatest areas of the Earth.

47
0:02:34.366,000 --> 0:02:38,000
About two thirds, I would guess, of the world is desertifying.

48
0:02:39.151,000 --> 0:02:41,000
I took this picture in the Tihamah Desert

49
0:02:42.075,000 --> 0:02:45,000
while 25 millimeters -- that's an inch of rain -- was falling.

50
0:02:45.779,000 --> 0:02:47,000
Think of it in terms of drums of water,

51
0:02:48.491,000 --> 0:02:5,000
each containing 200 liters.

52
0:02:51.163,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Over 1,000 drums of water fell on every hectare

53
0:02:55.763,000 --> 0:02:57,000
of that land that day.

54
0:02:58.637,000 --> 0:03:,000
The next day, the land looked like this.

55
0:03:01.021,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Where had that water gone?

56
0:03:03.844,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Some of it ran off as flooding,

57
0:03:06.241,000 --> 0:03:08,000
but most of the water that soaked into the soil

58
0:03:09.188,000 --> 0:03:11,000
simply evaporated out again,

59
0:03:11.469,000 --> 0:03:13,000
exactly as it does in your garden

60
0:03:13.838,000 --> 0:03:16,000
if you leave the soil uncovered.

61
0:03:16.853,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Now, because the fate of water and carbon

62
0:03:20.319,000 --> 0:03:23,000
are tied to soil organic matter,

63
0:03:23.877,000 --> 0:03:26,000
when we damage soils, you give off carbon.

64
0:03:27.804,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Carbon goes back to the atmosphere.

65
0:03:30.63,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Now you're told over and over, repeatedly,

66
0:03:34.735,000 --> 0:03:37,000
that desertification is only occurring

67
0:03:37.735,000 --> 0:03:4,000
in arid and semi-arid areas of the world,

68
0:03:41.384,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and that tall grasslands like this one

69
0:03:45.359,000 --> 0:03:48,000
in high rainfall are of no consequence.

70
0:03:48.991,000 --> 0:03:52,000
But if you do not look at grasslands but look down into them,

71
0:03:53.568,000 --> 0:03:55,000
you find that most of the soil in that grassland

72
0:03:56.279,000 --> 0:04:,000
that you've just seen is bare and covered with a crust of algae,

73
0:04:00.57,000 --> 0:04:03,000
leading to increased runoff and evaporation.

74
0:04:03.688,000 --> 0:04:06,000
That is the cancer of desertification

75
0:04:07.674,000 --> 0:04:11,000
that we do not recognize till its terminal form.

76
0:04:12.21,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Now we know that desertification is caused by livestock,

77
0:04:17.522,000 --> 0:04:19,000
mostly cattle, sheep and goats,

78
0:04:20.306,000 --> 0:04:22,000
overgrazing the plants,

79
0:04:23.123,000 --> 0:04:27,000
leaving the soil bare and giving off methane.

80
0:04:27.242,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Almost everybody knows this,

81
0:04:29.482,000 --> 0:04:31,000
from nobel laureates to golf caddies,

82
0:04:32.317,000 --> 0:04:34,000
or was taught it, as I was.

83
0:04:34.948,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Now, the environments like you see here,

84
0:04:38.418,000 --> 0:04:4,000
dusty environments in Africa where I grew up,

85
0:04:41.282,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and I loved wildlife,

86
0:04:44.202,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and so I grew up hating livestock

87
0:04:47.594,000 --> 0:04:49,000
because of the damage they were doing.

88
0:04:49.622,000 --> 0:04:52,000
And then my university education as an ecologist

89
0:04:52.906,000 --> 0:04:55,000
reinforced my beliefs.

90
0:04:55.994,000 --> 0:05:,000
Well, I have news for you.

91
0:05:01.27,000 --> 0:05:04,000
We were once just as certain

92
0:05:04.554,000 --> 0:05:06,000
that the world was flat.

93
0:05:06.834,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We were wrong then, and we are wrong again.

94
0:05:10.779,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And I want to invite you now

95
0:05:12.954,000 --> 0:05:18,000
to come along on my journey of reeducation and discovery.

96
0:05:19.208,000 --> 0:05:21,000
When I was a young man,

97
0:05:21.779,000 --> 0:05:23,000
a young biologist in Africa,

98
0:05:24.674,000 --> 0:05:28,000
I was involved in setting aside marvelous areas

99
0:05:29.091,000 --> 0:05:31,000
as future national parks.

100
0:05:31.61,000 --> 0:05:34,000
Now no sooner — this was in the 1950s —

101
0:05:35.037,000 --> 0:05:38,000
and no sooner did we remove the hunting,

102
0:05:38.205,000 --> 0:05:41,000
drum-beating people to protect the animals,

103
0:05:41.686,000 --> 0:05:42,000
than the land began to deteriorate,

104
0:05:43.579,000 --> 0:05:47,000
as you see in this park that we formed.

105
0:05:47.825,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Now, no livestock were involved,

106
0:05:50.148,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but suspecting that we had too many elephants now,

107
0:05:53.78,000 --> 0:05:57,000
I did the research and I proved we had too many,

108
0:05:58.045,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and I recommended that we would have to reduce their numbers

109
0:06:01.629,000 --> 0:06:05,000
and bring them down to a level that the land could sustain.

110
0:06:05.681,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now, that was a terrible decision for me to have to make,

111
0:06:09.465,000 --> 0:06:11,000
and it was political dynamite, frankly.

112
0:06:12.324,000 --> 0:06:15,000
So our government formed a team of experts

113
0:06:15.449,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to evaluate my research.

114
0:06:18.09,000 --> 0:06:2,000
They did. They agreed with me,

115
0:06:20.497,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and over the following years,

116
0:06:22.408,000 --> 0:06:27,000
we shot 40,000 elephants to try to stop the damage.

117
0:06:28.299,000 --> 0:06:31,000
And it got worse, not better.

118
0:06:32.039,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Loving elephants as I do,

119
0:06:34.538,000 --> 0:06:37,000
that was the saddest and greatest blunder of my life,

120
0:06:38.144,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and I will carry that to my grave.

121
0:06:40.872,000 --> 0:06:42,000
One good thing did come out of it.

122
0:06:43.344,000 --> 0:06:46,000
It made me absolutely determined

123
0:06:46.72,000 --> 0:06:51,000
to devote my life to finding solutions.

124
0:06:52.2,000 --> 0:06:56,000
When I came to the United States, I got a shock,

125
0:06:56.285,000 --> 0:06:58,000
to find national parks like this one

126
0:06:58.753,000 --> 0:07:02,000
desertifying as badly as anything in Africa.

127
0:07:02.984,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And there'd been no livestock on this land

128
0:07:04.988,000 --> 0:07:06,000
for over 70 years.

129
0:07:07.712,000 --> 0:07:08,000
And I found that American scientists

130
0:07:09.638,000 --> 0:07:11,000
had no explanation for this

131
0:07:12.552,000 --> 0:07:14,000
except that it is arid and natural.

132
0:07:15.512,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So I then began looking

133
0:07:18.872,000 --> 0:07:21,000
at all the research plots I could

134
0:07:22.123,000 --> 0:07:24,000
over the whole of the Western United States

135
0:07:24.826,000 --> 0:07:26,000
where cattle had been removed

136
0:07:27.027,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to prove that it would stop desertification,

137
0:07:29.899,000 --> 0:07:3,000
but I found the opposite,

138
0:07:31.732,000 --> 0:07:33,000
as we see on this research station,

139
0:07:34.554,000 --> 0:07:37,000
where this grassland that was green in 1961,

140
0:07:38.278,000 --> 0:07:43,000
by 2002 had changed to that situation.

141
0:07:43.291,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And the authors of the position paper on climate change

142
0:07:48.01,000 --> 0:07:5,000
from which I obtained these pictures

143
0:07:50.563,000 --> 0:07:55,000
attribute this change to "unknown processes."

144
0:07:56.382,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Clearly, we have never understood

145
0:08:00.376,000 --> 0:08:02,000
what is causing desertification,

146
0:08:03.06,000 --> 0:08:06,000
which has destroyed many civilizations

147
0:08:06.108,000 --> 0:08:08,000
and now threatens us globally.

148
0:08:08.8,000 --> 0:08:1,000
We have never understood it.

149
0:08:11.253,000 --> 0:08:13,000
Take one square meter of soil

150
0:08:13.372,000 --> 0:08:15,000
and make it bare like this is down here,

151
0:08:16.075,000 --> 0:08:19,000
and I promise you, you will find it much colder at dawn

152
0:08:19.254,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and much hotter at midday

153
0:08:22.058,000 --> 0:08:25,000
than that same piece of ground if it's just covered with litter,

154
0:08:25.728,000 --> 0:08:26,000
plant litter.

155
0:08:27.342,000 --> 0:08:3,000
You have changed the microclimate.

156
0:08:30.379,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Now, by the time you are doing that

157
0:08:32.478,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and increasing greatly the percentage of bare ground

158
0:08:38.066,000 --> 0:08:42,000
on more than half the world's land,

159
0:08:42.091,000 --> 0:08:45,000
you are changing macroclimate.

160
0:08:45.321,000 --> 0:08:47,000
But we have just simply not understood

161
0:08:47.91,000 --> 0:08:5,000
why was it beginning to happen 10,000 years ago?

162
0:08:51.896,000 --> 0:08:53,000
Why has it accelerated lately?

163
0:08:54.546,000 --> 0:08:55,000
We had no understanding of that.

164
0:08:56.513,000 --> 0:08:59,000
What we had failed to understand

165
0:08:59.938,000 --> 0:09:02,000
was that these seasonal humidity environments of the world,

166
0:09:03.761,000 --> 0:09:05,000
the soil and the vegetation

167
0:09:06.657,000 --> 0:09:11,000
developed with very large numbers of grazing animals,

168
0:09:12.449,000 --> 0:09:14,000
and that these grazing animals

169
0:09:15.073,000 --> 0:09:2,000
developed with ferocious pack-hunting predators.

170
0:09:20.465,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Now, the main defense against pack-hunting predators

171
0:09:24.357,000 --> 0:09:26,000
is to get into herds,

172
0:09:26.698,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and the larger the herd, the safer the individuals.

173
0:09:30.69,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Now, large herds dung and urinate all over their own food,

174
0:09:35.521,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and they have to keep moving,

175
0:09:38.521,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and it was that movement

176
0:09:40.438,000 --> 0:09:42,000
that prevented the overgrazing of plants,

177
0:09:43.242,000 --> 0:09:45,000
while the periodic trampling

178
0:09:45.641,000 --> 0:09:47,000
ensured good cover of the soil,

179
0:09:48.161,000 --> 0:09:51,000
as we see where a herd has passed.

180
0:09:51.273,000 --> 0:09:57,000
This picture is a typical seasonal grassland.

181
0:09:57.501,000 --> 0:09:59,000
It has just come through four months of rain,

182
0:10:00.293,000 --> 0:10:03,000
and it's now going into eight months of dry season.

183
0:10:03.975,000 --> 0:10:06,000
And watch the change as it goes into this long dry season.

184
0:10:07.443,000 --> 0:10:1,000
Now, all of that grass you see aboveground

185
0:10:10.519,000 --> 0:10:13,000
has to decay biologically

186
0:10:14.267,000 --> 0:10:17,000
before the next growing season, and if it doesn't,

187
0:10:17.791,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the grassland and the soil begin to die.

188
0:10:21.984,000 --> 0:10:24,000
Now, if it does not decay biologically,

189
0:10:25.179,000 --> 0:10:3,000
it shifts to oxidation, which is a very slow process,

190
0:10:30.318,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and this smothers and kills grasses,

191
0:10:33.273,000 --> 0:10:36,000
leading to a shift to woody vegetation

192
0:10:36.382,000 --> 0:10:39,000
and bare soil, releasing carbon.

193
0:10:39.802,000 --> 0:10:44,000
To prevent that, we have traditionally used fire.

194
0:10:44.906,000 --> 0:10:49,000
But fire also leaves the soil bare, releasing carbon,

195
0:10:50.755,000 --> 0:10:52,000
and worse than that,

196
0:10:53.146,000 --> 0:10:55,000
burning one hectare of grassland

197
0:10:55.826,000 --> 0:10:58,000
gives off more, and more damaging, pollutants

198
0:10:58.986,000 --> 0:11:,000
than 6,000 cars.

199
0:11:01.9,000 --> 0:11:05,000
And we are burning in Africa, every single year,

200
0:11:06.293,000 --> 0:11:1,000
more than one billion hectares of grasslands,

201
0:11:10.932,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and almost nobody is talking about it.

202
0:11:14.558,000 --> 0:11:18,000
We justify the burning, as scientists,

203
0:11:18.897,000 --> 0:11:2,000
because it does remove the dead material

204
0:11:21.81,000 --> 0:11:24,000
and it allows the plants to grow.

205
0:11:25.113,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Now, looking at this grassland of ours that has gone dry,

206
0:11:28.209,000 --> 0:11:3,000
what could we do to keep that healthy?

207
0:11:30.905,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And bear in mind, I'm talking of most of the world's land now.

208
0:11:33.929,000 --> 0:11:37,000
Okay? We cannot reduce animal numbers to rest it more

209
0:11:38.617,000 --> 0:11:41,000
without causing desertification and climate change.

210
0:11:42.233,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We cannot burn it without causing

211
0:11:45.37,000 --> 0:11:47,000
desertification and climate change.

212
0:11:47.635,000 --> 0:11:5,000
What are we going to do?

213
0:11:53.68,000 --> 0:11:55,000
There is only one option,

214
0:11:56.07,000 --> 0:11:58,000
I'll repeat to you, only one option

215
0:11:58.931,000 --> 0:12:,000
left to climatologists and scientists,

216
0:12:01.65,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and that is to do the unthinkable,

217
0:12:04.578,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and to use livestock,

218
0:12:07.314,000 --> 0:12:09,000
bunched and moving,

219
0:12:10.269,000 --> 0:12:13,000
as a proxy for former herds and predators,

220
0:12:13.658,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and mimic nature.

221
0:12:15.402,000 --> 0:12:19,000
There is no other alternative left to mankind.

222
0:12:19.906,000 --> 0:12:21,000
So let's do that.

223
0:12:22.354,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So on this bit of grassland, we'll do it, but just in the foreground.

224
0:12:25.724,000 --> 0:12:28,000
We'll impact it very heavily with cattle to mimic nature,

225
0:12:28.962,000 --> 0:12:3,000
and we've done so, and look at that.

226
0:12:31.786,000 --> 0:12:34,000
All of that grass is now covering the soil

227
0:12:35.146,000 --> 0:12:38,000
as dung, urine and litter or mulch,

228
0:12:39.116,000 --> 0:12:42,000
as every one of the gardeners amongst you would understand,

229
0:12:42.396,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and that soil is ready to absorb and hold the rain,

230
0:12:46.757,000 --> 0:12:51,000
to store carbon, and to break down methane.

231
0:12:51.764,000 --> 0:12:53,000
And we did that,

232
0:12:53.994,000 --> 0:12:55,000
without using fire to damage the soil,

233
0:12:56.764,000 --> 0:12:59,000
and the plants are free to grow.

234
0:12:59.9,000 --> 0:13:01,000
When I first realized

235
0:13:02.164,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that we had no option as scientists

236
0:13:04.646,000 --> 0:13:06,000
but to use much-vilified livestock

237
0:13:07.406,000 --> 0:13:12,000
to address climate change and desertification,

238
0:13:12.653,000 --> 0:13:14,000
I was faced with a real dilemma.

239
0:13:14.888,000 --> 0:13:15,000
How were we to do it?

240
0:13:16.613,000 --> 0:13:2,000
We'd had 10,000 years of extremely knowledgeable pastoralists

241
0:13:21.177,000 --> 0:13:22,000
bunching and moving their animals,

242
0:13:23.125,000 --> 0:13:26,000
but they had created the great manmade deserts of the world.

243
0:13:26.792,000 --> 0:13:29,000
Then we'd had 100 years of modern rain science,

244
0:13:30.671,000 --> 0:13:33,000
and that had accelerated desertification,

245
0:13:33.93,000 --> 0:13:35,000
as we first discovered in Africa

246
0:13:36.103,000 --> 0:13:38,000
and then confirmed in the United States,

247
0:13:38.767,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and as you see in this picture

248
0:13:40.886,000 --> 0:13:43,000
of land managed by the federal government.

249
0:13:44.247,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Clearly more was needed

250
0:13:46.148,000 --> 0:13:48,000
than bunching and moving the animals,

251
0:13:48.237,000 --> 0:13:51,000
and humans, over thousands of years,

252
0:13:51.807,000 --> 0:13:55,000
had never been able to deal with nature's complexity.

253
0:13:56.193,000 --> 0:13:58,000
But we biologists and ecologists

254
0:13:58.577,000 --> 0:14:,000
had never tackled anything as complex as this.

255
0:14:01.546,000 --> 0:14:03,000
So rather than reinvent the wheel,

256
0:14:04.185,000 --> 0:14:08,000
I began studying other professions to see if anybody had.

257
0:14:08.321,000 --> 0:14:1,000
And I found there were planning techniques

258
0:14:10.793,000 --> 0:14:13,000
that I could take and adapt to our biological need,

259
0:14:14.565,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and from those I developed what we call

260
0:14:17.262,000 --> 0:14:2,000
holistic management and planned grazing,

261
0:14:20.572,000 --> 0:14:21,000
a planning process,

262
0:14:22.371,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and that does address all of nature's complexity

263
0:14:26.066,000 --> 0:14:31,000
and our social, environmental, economic complexity.

264
0:14:31.315,000 --> 0:14:33,000
Today, we have young women like this one

265
0:14:33.979,000 --> 0:14:35,000
teaching villages in Africa

266
0:14:36.347,000 --> 0:14:38,000
how to put their animals together into larger herds,

267
0:14:39.283,000 --> 0:14:41,000
plan their grazing to mimic nature,

268
0:14:41.987,000 --> 0:14:45,000
and where we have them hold their animals overnight --

269
0:14:46.028,000 --> 0:14:48,000
we run them in a predator-friendly manner,

270
0:14:48.287,000 --> 0:14:5,000
because we have a lot of lands, and so on --

271
0:14:50.609,000 --> 0:14:52,000
and where they do this and hold them overnight

272
0:14:52.803,000 --> 0:14:53,000
to prepare the crop fields,

273
0:14:54.608,000 --> 0:14:57,000
we are getting very great increases in crop yield as well.

274
0:14:58.592,000 --> 0:14:59,000
Let's look at some results.

275
0:15:00.209,000 --> 0:15:04,000
This is land close to land that we manage in Zimbabwe.

276
0:15:04.433,000 --> 0:15:07,000
It has just come through four months of very good rains

277
0:15:07.977,000 --> 0:15:1,000
it got that year, and it's going into the long dry season.

278
0:15:11.487,000 --> 0:15:14,000
But as you can see, all of that rain, almost of all it,

279
0:15:14.522,000 --> 0:15:17,000
has evaporated from the soil surface.

280
0:15:17.629,000 --> 0:15:2,000
Their river is dry despite the rain just having ended,

281
0:15:21.431,000 --> 0:15:24,000
and we have 150,000 people

282
0:15:24.951,000 --> 0:15:27,000
on almost permanent food aid.

283
0:15:28.701,000 --> 0:15:32,000
Now let's go to our land nearby on the same day,

284
0:15:33.197,000 --> 0:15:35,000
with the same rainfall, and look at that.

285
0:15:36.037,000 --> 0:15:38,000
Our river is flowing and healthy and clean.

286
0:15:38.742,000 --> 0:15:4,000
It's fine.

287
0:15:41.229,000 --> 0:15:46,000
The production of grass, shrubs, trees, wildlife,

288
0:15:46.547,000 --> 0:15:48,000
everything is now more productive,

289
0:15:49.403,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and we have virtually no fear of dry years.

290
0:15:53.508,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And we did that by increasing the cattle and goats

291
0:15:59.003,000 --> 0:16:,000
400 percent,

292
0:16:00.928,000 --> 0:16:03,000
planning the grazing to mimic nature

293
0:16:04.058,000 --> 0:16:06,000
and integrate them with all the elephants, buffalo,

294
0:16:06.479,000 --> 0:16:09,000
giraffe and other animals that we have.

295
0:16:10.066,000 --> 0:16:15,000
But before we began, our land looked like that.

296
0:16:15.788,000 --> 0:16:2,000
This site was bare and eroding for over 30 years

297
0:16:21.205,000 --> 0:16:23,000
regardless of what rain we got.

298
0:16:23.974,000 --> 0:16:26,000
Okay? Watch the marked tree and see the change

299
0:16:27.592,000 --> 0:16:3,000
as we use livestock to mimic nature.

300
0:16:31.245,000 --> 0:16:32,000
This was another site

301
0:16:32.707,000 --> 0:16:34,000
where it had been bare and eroding,

302
0:16:35.085,000 --> 0:16:37,000
and at the base of the marked small tree,

303
0:16:37.789,000 --> 0:16:41,000
we had lost over 30 centimeters of soil. Okay?

304
0:16:42.077,000 --> 0:16:43,000
And again, watch the change

305
0:16:43.686,000 --> 0:16:45,000
just using livestock to mimic nature.

306
0:16:46.536,000 --> 0:16:48,000
And there are fallen trees in there now,

307
0:16:48.667,000 --> 0:16:52,000
because the better land is now attracting elephants, etc.

308
0:16:53.624,000 --> 0:16:56,000
This land in Mexico was in terrible condition,

309
0:16:57.28,000 --> 0:16:58,000
and I've had to mark the hill

310
0:16:59.234,000 --> 0:17:03,000
because the change is so profound.

311
0:17:03.421,000 --> 0:17:08,000
(Applause)

312
0:17:10.981,000 --> 0:17:14,000
I began helping a family in the Karoo Desert in the 1970s

313
0:17:15.918,000 --> 0:17:17,000
turn the desert that you see on the right there

314
0:17:18.886,000 --> 0:17:19,000
back to grassland,

315
0:17:20.82,000 --> 0:17:23,000
and thankfully, now their grandchildren are on the land

316
0:17:24.342,000 --> 0:17:25,000
with hope for the future.

317
0:17:26.185,000 --> 0:17:28,000
And look at the amazing change in this one,

318
0:17:28.982,000 --> 0:17:3,000
where that gully has completely healed

319
0:17:31.694,000 --> 0:17:35,000
using nothing but livestock mimicking nature,

320
0:17:36.273,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and once more, we have the third generation of that family

321
0:17:40.498,000 --> 0:17:43,000
on that land with their flag still flying.

322
0:17:43.778,000 --> 0:17:45,000
The vast grasslands of Patagonia

323
0:17:46.346,000 --> 0:17:48,000
are turning to desert as you see here.

324
0:17:48.422,000 --> 0:17:51,000
The man in the middle is an Argentinian researcher,

325
0:17:51.482,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and he has documented the steady decline of that land

326
0:17:55.126,000 --> 0:17:58,000
over the years as they kept reducing sheep numbers.

327
0:17:58.602,000 --> 0:18:02,000
They put 25,000 sheep in one flock,

328
0:18:03.45,000 --> 0:18:06,000
really mimicking nature now with planned grazing,

329
0:18:07.399,000 --> 0:18:11,000
and they have documented a 50-percent increase

330
0:18:11.742,000 --> 0:18:14,000
in the production of the land in the first year.

331
0:18:15.21,000 --> 0:18:18,000
We now have in the violent Horn of Africa

332
0:18:18.25,000 --> 0:18:21,000
pastoralists planning their grazing to mimic nature

333
0:18:21.706,000 --> 0:18:24,000
and openly saying it is the only hope they have

334
0:18:25.202,000 --> 0:18:28,000
of saving their families and saving their culture.

335
0:18:28.37,000 --> 0:18:3,000
Ninety-five percent of that land

336
0:18:30.446,000 --> 0:18:33,000
can only feed people from animals.

337
0:18:34.106,000 --> 0:18:36,000
I remind you that I am talking about

338
0:18:36.217,000 --> 0:18:4,000
most of the world's land here that controls our fate,

339
0:18:40.658,000 --> 0:18:43,000
including the most violent region of the world,

340
0:18:43.714,000 --> 0:18:45,000
where only animals can feed people

341
0:18:46.666,000 --> 0:18:49,000
from about 95 percent of the land.

342
0:18:49.97,000 --> 0:18:54,000
What we are doing globally is causing climate change

343
0:18:55.104,000 --> 0:18:58,000
as much as, I believe, fossil fuels,

344
0:18:58.4,000 --> 0:19:01,000
and maybe more than fossil fuels.

345
0:19:01.936,000 --> 0:19:04,000
But worse than that, it is causing hunger, poverty,

346
0:19:05.611,000 --> 0:19:07,000
violence, social breakdown and war,

347
0:19:08.608,000 --> 0:19:1,000
and as I am talking to you,

348
0:19:11.016,000 --> 0:19:14,000
millions of men, women and children

349
0:19:14.166,000 --> 0:19:16,000
are suffering and dying.

350
0:19:16.568,000 --> 0:19:18,000
And if this continues,

351
0:19:19.28,000 --> 0:19:22,000
we are unlikely to be able to stop the climate changing,

352
0:19:23.074,000 --> 0:19:28,000
even after we have eliminated the use of fossil fuels.

353
0:19:28.121,000 --> 0:19:32,000
I believe I've shown you how we can work with nature

354
0:19:32.357,000 --> 0:19:34,000
at very low cost

355
0:19:34.813,000 --> 0:19:36,000
to reverse all this.

356
0:19:37.309,000 --> 0:19:39,000
We are already doing so

357
0:19:39.741,000 --> 0:19:42,000
on about 15 million hectares

358
0:19:43.737,000 --> 0:19:45,000
on five continents,

359
0:19:46.369,000 --> 0:19:47,000
and people who understand

360
0:19:47.996,000 --> 0:19:49,000
far more about carbon than I do

361
0:19:50.286,000 --> 0:19:53,000
calculate that, for illustrative purposes,

362
0:19:53.344,000 --> 0:19:55,000
if we do what I am showing you here,

363
0:19:56.138,000 --> 0:20:,000
we can take enough carbon out of the atmosphere

364
0:20:00.163,000 --> 0:20:03,000
and safely store it in the grassland soils

365
0:20:03.497,000 --> 0:20:04,000
for thousands of years,

366
0:20:05.123,000 --> 0:20:09,000
and if we just do that on about half the world's grasslands

367
0:20:10.119,000 --> 0:20:11,000
that I've shown you,

368
0:20:11.473,000 --> 0:20:14,000
we can take us back to pre-industrial levels,

369
0:20:15.173,000 --> 0:20:16,000
while feeding people.

370
0:20:16.814,000 --> 0:20:18,000
I can think of almost nothing

371
0:20:19.586,000 --> 0:20:22,000
that offers more hope for our planet,

372
0:20:23.111,000 --> 0:20:25,000
for your children,

373
0:20:25.359,000 --> 0:20:27,000
and their children, and all of humanity.

374
0:20:28.015,000 --> 0:20:31,000
Thank you.

375
0:20:31.32,000 --> 0:20:39,000
(Applause)

376
0:20:39.432,000 --> 0:20:43,000
Thank you. (Applause)

377
0:20:52.781,000 --> 0:20:53,000
Thank you, Chris.

378
0:20:54.501,000 --> 0:20:57,000
Chris Anderson: Thank you. I have,

379
0:20:57.847,000 --> 0:20:59,000
and I'm sure everyone here has,

380
0:20:59.944,000 --> 0:21:02,000
A) a hundred questions, B) wants to hug you.

381
0:21:03.672,000 --> 0:21:04,000
I'm just going to ask you one quick question.

382
0:21:05.431,000 --> 0:21:08,000
When you first start this and you bring in a flock of animals,

383
0:21:09.115,000 --> 0:21:12,000
it's desert. What do they eat? How does that part work?

384
0:21:12.491,000 --> 0:21:12,000
How do you start?

385
0:21:13.482,000 --> 0:21:14,000
Allan Savory: Well, we have done this for a long time,

386
0:21:15.121,000 --> 0:21:18,000
and the only time we have ever had to provide any feed

387
0:21:18.739,000 --> 0:21:19,000
is during mine reclamation,

388
0:21:20.508,000 --> 0:21:22,000
where it's 100 percent bare.

389
0:21:22.822,000 --> 0:21:26,000
But many years ago, we took the worst land in Zimbabwe,

390
0:21:27.178,000 --> 0:21:3,000
where I offered a £5 note

391
0:21:30.272,000 --> 0:21:32,000
in a hundred-mile drive

392
0:21:32.291,000 --> 0:21:34,000
if somebody could find one grass

393
0:21:34.411,000 --> 0:21:35,000
in a hundred-mile drive,

394
0:21:36.401,000 --> 0:21:38,000
and on that, we trebled the stocking rate,

395
0:21:39.187,000 --> 0:21:42,000
the number of animals, in the first year with no feeding,

396
0:21:42.963,000 --> 0:21:44,000
just by the movement, mimicking nature,

397
0:21:45.619,000 --> 0:21:49,000
and using a sigmoid curve, that principle.

398
0:21:50.394,000 --> 0:21:52,000
It's a little bit technical to explain here, but just that.

399
0:21:52.865,000 --> 0:21:55,000
CA: Well, I would love to -- I mean, this such an interesting and important idea.

400
0:21:56.577,000 --> 0:21:57,000
The best people on our blog are going to come and talk to you

401
0:21:58.569,000 --> 0:22:,000
and try and -- I want to get more on this

402
0:22:01.201,000 --> 0:22:03,000
that we could share along with the talk.AS: Wonderful.

403
0:22:04.153,000 --> 0:22:07,000
CA: That is an astonishing talk, truly an astonishing talk,

404
0:22:07.689,000 --> 0:22:09,000
and I think you heard that we all are cheering you on your way.

405
0:22:10.465,000 --> 0:22:12,000
Thank you so much.AS: Well, thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Chris.

406
0:22:13.457,000 --> 0:22:14,000

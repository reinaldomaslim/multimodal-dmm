2
0:00:16.74,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I thought I would start with a very brief history of cities.

3
0:00:21.3,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Settlements typically began with people clustered around a well,

4
0:00:25.9,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and the size of that settlement was roughly the distance you could walk

5
0:00:29.258,000 --> 0:00:3,000
with a pot of water on your head.

6
0:00:31.22,000 --> 0:00:34,000
In fact, if you fly over Germany, for example,

7
0:00:34.74,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and you look down and you see these hundreds of little villages,

8
0:00:37.764,000 --> 0:00:38,000
they're all about a mile apart.

9
0:00:39.524,000 --> 0:00:41,000
You needed easy access to the fields.

10
0:00:42.34,000 --> 0:00:45,000
And for hundreds, even thousands of years,

11
0:00:45.74,000 --> 0:00:47,000
the home was really the center of life.

12
0:00:48.34,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Life was very small for most people.

13
0:00:50.94,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It was a center of entertainment, of energy production, of work,

14
0:00:57.06,000 --> 0:00:58,000
a center of health care.

15
0:00:58.3,000 --> 0:01:01,000
That's where babies were born and people died.

16
0:01:01.62,000 --> 0:01:05,000
Then, with industrialization, everything started to become centralized.

17
0:01:06.5,000 --> 0:01:1,000
You had dirty factories that were moved to the outskirts of cities.

18
0:01:10.54,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Production was centralized in assembly plants.

19
0:01:14.9,000 --> 0:01:17,000
You had centralized energy production.

20
0:01:18.5,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Learning took place in schools.

21
0:01:20.219,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Health care took place in hospitals.

22
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And then you had networks that developed.

23
0:01:26.3,000 --> 0:01:28,000
You had water, sewer networks

24
0:01:28.94,000 --> 0:01:31,000
that allowed for this kind of unchecked expansion.

25
0:01:32.82,000 --> 0:01:35,000
You had separated functions, increasingly.

26
0:01:36.46,000 --> 0:01:37,000
You had rail networks

27
0:01:38.22,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that connected residential, industrial, commercial areas.

28
0:01:41.06,000 --> 0:01:42,000
You had auto networks.

29
0:01:42.7,000 --> 0:01:45,000
In fact, the model was really, give everybody a car,

30
0:01:45.98,000 --> 0:01:46,000
build roads to everything,

31
0:01:47.34,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and give people a place to park when they get there.

32
0:01:49.82,000 --> 0:01:5,000
It was not a very functional model.

33
0:01:51.54,000 --> 0:01:53,000
And we still live in that world,

34
0:01:53.94,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and this is what we end up with.

35
0:01:56.1,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So you have the sprawl of LA,

36
0:01:58.18,000 --> 0:02:,000
the sprawl of Mexico City.

37
0:02:00.38,000 --> 0:02:03,000
You have these unbelievable new cities in China,

38
0:02:03.5,000 --> 0:02:05,000
which you might call tower sprawl.

39
0:02:05.86,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They're all building cities

40
0:02:07.22,000 --> 0:02:09,000
on the model that we invented in the '50s and '60s,

41
0:02:10.18,000 --> 0:02:12,000
which is really obsolete, I would argue,

42
0:02:12.22,000 --> 0:02:14,000
and there are hundreds and hundreds of new cities

43
0:02:14.53,000 --> 0:02:16,000
that are being planned all over the world.

44
0:02:16.61,000 --> 0:02:2,000
In China alone, 300 million people, some say 400 million people,

45
0:02:20.66,000 --> 0:02:22,000
will move to the city over the next 15 years.

46
0:02:23.02,000 --> 0:02:25,000
That means building the equivalent

47
0:02:25.54,000 --> 0:02:27,000
of the entire built infrastructure of the US in 15 years.

48
0:02:28.38,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Imagine that.

49
0:02:29.62,000 --> 0:02:33,000
And we should all care about this whether you live in cities or not.

50
0:02:34.3,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Cities will account for 90 percent of the population growth,

51
0:02:37.9,000 --> 0:02:41,000
80 percent of the global CO2, 75 percent of energy use,

52
0:02:42.7,000 --> 0:02:44,000
but at the same time it's where people want to be,

53
0:02:45.22,000 --> 0:02:46,000
increasingly.

54
0:02:46.82,000 --> 0:02:48,000
More than half the people now in the world live in cities,

55
0:02:49.66,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and that will just continue to escalate.

56
0:02:52.38,000 --> 0:02:55,000
Cities are places of celebration, personal expression.

57
0:02:56.02,000 --> 0:02:59,000
You have the flash mobs of pillow fights that --

58
0:02:59.34,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I've been to a couple. They're quite fun.

59
0:03:01.46,000 --> 0:03:02,000
You have --

60
0:03:02.7,000 --> 0:03:03,000
(Laughter)

61
0:03:03.98,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Cities are where most of the wealth is created,

62
0:03:06.82,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and particularly in the developing world, it's where women find opportunities.

63
0:03:10.54,000 --> 0:03:13,000
That's a lot of the reason why cities are growing very quickly.

64
0:03:13.98,000 --> 0:03:15,000
Now there's some trends that will impact cities.

65
0:03:16.62,000 --> 0:03:18,000
First of all, work is becoming distributed and mobile.

66
0:03:19.54,000 --> 0:03:22,000
The office building is basically obsolete for doing private work.

67
0:03:23.18,000 --> 0:03:27,000
The home, once again, because of distributed computation --

68
0:03:27.58,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Communication is becoming a center of life,

69
0:03:29.62,000 --> 0:03:33,000
so it's a center of production and learning and shopping and health care

70
0:03:33.82,000 --> 0:03:35,000
and all of these things that we used to think of

71
0:03:36.62,000 --> 0:03:38,000
as taking place outside of the home.

72
0:03:39.46,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And increasingly, everything that people buy,

73
0:03:42.46,000 --> 0:03:43,000
every consumer product,

74
0:03:43.82,000 --> 0:03:45,000
in one way or another, can be personalized.

75
0:03:46.78,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And that's a very important trend to think about.

76
0:03:49.22,000 --> 0:03:51,000
So this is my image of the city of the future.

77
0:03:52.319,000 --> 0:03:54,000
(Laughter)

78
0:03:54.7,000 --> 0:03:56,000
In that it's a place for people, you know.

79
0:03:56.98,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Maybe not the way people dress, but --

80
0:03:59.7,000 --> 0:04:,000
You know, the question now is,

81
0:04:01.153,000 --> 0:04:04,000
how can we have all the good things that we identify with cities

82
0:04:04.62,000 --> 0:04:05,000
without all the bad things?

83
0:04:06.46,000 --> 0:04:07,000
This is Bangalore.

84
0:04:07.7,000 --> 0:04:11,000
It took me a couple of hours to get a few miles in Bangalore last year.

85
0:04:11.78,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So with cities, you also have congestion and pollution

86
0:04:14.34,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and disease and all these negative things.

87
0:04:17.02,000 --> 0:04:19,000
How can we have the good stuff without the bad?

88
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
So we went back and started looking at the great cities

89
0:04:21.856,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that evolved before the cars.

90
0:04:23.98,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Paris was a series of these little villages that came together,

91
0:04:28.34,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and you still see that structure today.

92
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The 20 arrondissements of Paris are these little neighborhoods.

93
0:04:33.237,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Most of what people need in life can be within a five- or 10-minute walk.

94
0:04:37.98,000 --> 0:04:4,000
And if you look at the data, when you have that kind of a structure,

95
0:04:41.22,000 --> 0:04:42,000
you get a very even distribution

96
0:04:42.94,000 --> 0:04:45,000
of the shops and the physicians and the pharmacies

97
0:04:46.34,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and the cafes in Paris.

98
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And then you look at cities that evolved after the automobile,

99
0:04:51.22,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and it's not that kind of a pattern.

100
0:04:52.98,000 --> 0:04:55,000
There's very little that's within a five-minute walk

101
0:04:56.02,000 --> 0:04:58,000
of most areas of places like Pittsburgh.

102
0:04:58.34,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Not to pick on Pittsburgh,

103
0:04:59.62,000 --> 0:05:03,000
but most American cities really have evolved this way.

104
0:05:04.18,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So we said, well, let's look at new cities,

105
0:05:06.38,000 --> 0:05:1,000
and we're involved in a couple of new city projects in China.

106
0:05:10.62,000 --> 0:05:12,000
So we said, let's start with that neighborhood cell.

107
0:05:13.1,000 --> 0:05:14,000
We think of it as a compact urban cell.

108
0:05:15.02,000 --> 0:05:18,000
So provide most of what most people want within that 20-minute walk.

109
0:05:18.62,000 --> 0:05:21,000
This can also be a resilient electrical microgrid,

110
0:05:22.18,000 --> 0:05:25,000
community heating, power, communication networks, etc.

111
0:05:25.78,000 --> 0:05:26,000
can be concentrated there.

112
0:05:27.58,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Stewart Brand would put a micronuclear reactor

113
0:05:30.46,000 --> 0:05:31,000
right in the center, probably.

114
0:05:32.46,000 --> 0:05:33,000
And he might be right.

115
0:05:33.94,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And then we can form, in effect, a mesh network.

116
0:05:37.5,000 --> 0:05:4,000
It's something of an Internet typology pattern,

117
0:05:41.14,000 --> 0:05:43,000
so you can have a series of these neighborhoods.

118
0:05:43.66,000 --> 0:05:44,000
You can dial up the density --

119
0:05:45.14,000 --> 0:05:47,000
about 20,000 people per cell, if it's Cambridge.

120
0:05:47.66,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Go up to 50,000 if it's Manhattan density.

121
0:05:50.22,000 --> 0:05:52,000
You connect everything with mass transit

122
0:05:52.34,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and you provide most of what most people need within that neighborhood.

123
0:05:56.62,000 --> 0:05:59,000
You can begin to develop a whole typology of streetscapes

124
0:05:59.86,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and the vehicles that can go on them.

125
0:06:02.94,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I won't go through all of them. I'll just show one.

126
0:06:05.38,000 --> 0:06:08,000
This is Boulder. It's a great example of kind of a mobility parkway,

127
0:06:09.3,000 --> 0:06:11,000
a superhighway for joggers and bicyclists,

128
0:06:12.06,000 --> 0:06:14,000
where you can go from one end of the city to the other

129
0:06:14.608,000 --> 0:06:15,000
without crossing the street,

130
0:06:16.38,000 --> 0:06:19,000
and they also have bike-sharing, which I'll get into in a minute.

131
0:06:20.18,000 --> 0:06:22,000
This is even a more interesting solution

132
0:06:22.38,000 --> 0:06:23,000
in Seoul, Korea.

133
0:06:23.62,000 --> 0:06:25,000
They took the elevated highway, they got rid of it,

134
0:06:26.06,000 --> 0:06:29,000
they reclaimed the street, the river down below,

135
0:06:29.7,000 --> 0:06:3,000
below the street,

136
0:06:31.1,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and you can go from one end of Seoul to the other

137
0:06:33.46,000 --> 0:06:36,000
without crossing a pathway for cars.

138
0:06:37.14,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The High Line in Manhattan is very similar.

139
0:06:41.62,000 --> 0:06:45,000
You have these rapidly emerging bike lanes all over the world.

140
0:06:45.82,000 --> 0:06:46,000
I lived in Manhattan for 15 years.

141
0:06:47.5,000 --> 0:06:49,000
I went back a couple of weekends ago,

142
0:06:49.78,000 --> 0:06:54,000
took this photograph of these fabulous new bike lanes that they have installed.

143
0:06:55.38,000 --> 0:06:57,000
They're still not to where Copenhagen is,

144
0:06:58.22,000 --> 0:07:01,000
where something like 42 percent of the trips within the city

145
0:07:01.66,000 --> 0:07:02,000
are by bicycle.

146
0:07:02.9,000 --> 0:07:05,000
It's mostly just because they have fantastic infrastructure there.

147
0:07:06.7,000 --> 0:07:08,000
We actually did exactly the wrong thing in Boston.

148
0:07:09.42,000 --> 0:07:11,000
The Big Dig --

149
0:07:11.5,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Laughter)

150
0:07:14.02,000 --> 0:07:18,000
So we got rid of the highway but we created a traffic island,

151
0:07:18.06,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and it's certainly not a mobility pathway for anything other than cars.

152
0:07:22.78,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Mobility on demand is something we've been thinking about,

153
0:07:25.54,000 --> 0:07:28,000
so we think we need an ecosystem of these shared-use vehicles

154
0:07:28.86,000 --> 0:07:3,000
connected to mass transit.

155
0:07:30.98,000 --> 0:07:33,000
These are some of the vehicles that we've been working on.

156
0:07:34.06,000 --> 0:07:35,000
But shared use is really key.

157
0:07:35.74,000 --> 0:07:38,000
If you share a vehicle, you can have at least four people use one vehicle,

158
0:07:39.66,000 --> 0:07:4,000
as opposed to one.

159
0:07:41.54,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We have Hubway here in Boston, the Vélib' system in Paris.

160
0:07:48.02,000 --> 0:07:52,000
We've been developing, at the Media Lab, this little city car

161
0:07:52.3,000 --> 0:07:55,000
that is optimized for shared use in cities.

162
0:07:55.5,000 --> 0:07:58,000
We got rid of all the useless things like engines and transmissions.

163
0:07:58.9,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We moved everything to the wheels,

164
0:08:00.9,000 --> 0:08:01,000
so you have the drive motor,

165
0:08:02.3,000 --> 0:08:04,000
the steering motor, the breaking -- all in the wheel.

166
0:08:04.82,000 --> 0:08:07,000
That left the chassis unencumbered, so you can do things like fold,

167
0:08:08.02,000 --> 0:08:13,000
so you can fold this little vehicle up to occupy a tiny little footprint.

168
0:08:13.7,000 --> 0:08:16,000
This was a video that was on European television last week

169
0:08:17.18,000 --> 0:08:22,000
showing the Spanish Minister of Industry driving this little vehicle,

170
0:08:22.82,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and when it's folded, it can spin.

171
0:08:24.66,000 --> 0:08:27,000
You don't need reverse. You don't need parallel parking.

172
0:08:27.94,000 --> 0:08:28,000
You just spin and go directly in.

173
0:08:29.58,000 --> 0:08:3,000
(Laughter)

174
0:08:31.18,000 --> 0:08:33,000
So we've been working with a company to commercialize this.

175
0:08:33.98,000 --> 0:08:36,000
My PhD student Ryan Chin presented these early ideas

176
0:08:37.1,000 --> 0:08:39,000
two years ago at a TEDx conference.

177
0:08:39.78,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So what's interesting is,

178
0:08:42.3,000 --> 0:08:44,000
then if you begin to add new things to it, like autonomy,

179
0:08:45.14,000 --> 0:08:47,000
you get out of the car, you park at your destination,

180
0:08:47.939,000 --> 0:08:5,000
you pat it on the butt, it goes and it parks itself, it charges itself,

181
0:08:51.78,000 --> 0:08:55,000
and you can get something like seven times as many vehicles

182
0:08:56.38,000 --> 0:08:59,000
in a given area as conventional cars,

183
0:08:59.74,000 --> 0:09:,000
and we think this is the future.

184
0:09:01.34,000 --> 0:09:04,000
Actually, we could do this today. It's not really a problem.

185
0:09:05.06,000 --> 0:09:08,000
We can combine shared use and folding and autonomy

186
0:09:08.62,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and we get something like 28 times the land utilization

187
0:09:11.94,000 --> 0:09:12,000
with that kind of strategy.

188
0:09:13.62,000 --> 0:09:14,000
One of our graduate students then says,

189
0:09:15.502,000 --> 0:09:19,000
well, how does a driverless car communicate with pedestrians?

190
0:09:19.66,000 --> 0:09:21,000
You have nobody to make eye contact with.

191
0:09:21.86,000 --> 0:09:23,000
You don't know if it's going to run you over.

192
0:09:24.02,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So he's developing strategies

193
0:09:25.62,000 --> 0:09:27,000
so the vehicle can communicate with pedestrians, so --

194
0:09:28.22,000 --> 0:09:29,000
(Laughter)

195
0:09:29.66,000 --> 0:09:31,000
So the headlights are eyeballs, the pupils can dilate,

196
0:09:32.62,000 --> 0:09:36,000
we have directional audio, we can throw sound directly at people.

197
0:09:36.82,000 --> 0:09:37,000
What I love about this project

198
0:09:38.3,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is he solved a problem that doesn't exist yet, so --

199
0:09:41.94,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Laughter)

200
0:09:44.9,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We also think that we can democratize access to bike lanes.

201
0:09:48.78,000 --> 0:09:51,000
You know, bike lanes are mostly used by young guys in stretchy pants. So --

202
0:09:52.7,000 --> 0:09:53,000
(Laughter)

203
0:09:54.1,000 --> 0:09:57,000
We think we can develop a vehicle that operates on bike lanes,

204
0:09:57.94,000 --> 0:10:01,000
accessible to elderly and disabled, women in skirts, businesspeople,

205
0:10:02.94,000 --> 0:10:04,000
and address the issues of energy congestion, mobility,

206
0:10:05.54,000 --> 0:10:07,000
aging and obesity simultaneously.

207
0:10:07.82,000 --> 0:10:08,000
That's our challenge.

208
0:10:09.06,000 --> 0:10:11,000
This is an early design for this little three-wheel.

209
0:10:11.94,000 --> 0:10:12,000
It's an electronic bike.

210
0:10:13.46,000 --> 0:10:16,000
You have to pedal to operate it in a bike lane,

211
0:10:17.22,000 --> 0:10:19,000
but if you're an older person, that's a switch.

212
0:10:19.86,000 --> 0:10:22,000
If you're a healthy person, you might have to work really hard to go fast.

213
0:10:23.66,000 --> 0:10:25,000
You can dial in 40 calories going into work

214
0:10:25.98,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and 500 going home, when you can take a shower.

215
0:10:28.66,000 --> 0:10:32,000
We hope to have that built this fall.

216
0:10:32.94,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Housing is another area where we can really improve.

217
0:10:36.34,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Mayor Menino in Boston says

218
0:10:38.54,000 --> 0:10:4,000
lack of affordable housing for young people

219
0:10:41.5,000 --> 0:10:43,000
is one of the biggest problems the city faces.

220
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
Developers say, OK, we'll build little teeny apartments.

221
0:10:47.02,000 --> 0:10:51,000
People say, we don't really want to live in a little teeny conventional apartment.

222
0:10:51.3,000 --> 0:10:55,000
So we're saying, let's build a standardized chassis,

223
0:10:55.38,000 --> 0:10:56,000
much like our car.

224
0:10:56.74,000 --> 0:11:01,000
Let's bring advanced technology into the apartment,

225
0:11:01.86,000 --> 0:11:03,000
technology-enabled infill,

226
0:11:04.42,000 --> 0:11:08,000
give people the tools within this open-loft chassis

227
0:11:09.42,000 --> 0:11:1,000
to go through a process of defining

228
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
what their needs and values and activities are,

229
0:11:14.22,000 --> 0:11:17,000
and then a matching algorithm will match a unique assembly

230
0:11:17.82,000 --> 0:11:18,000
of integrated infill components,

231
0:11:19.82,000 --> 0:11:24,000
furniture, and cabinetry, that are personalized to that individual,

232
0:11:24.94,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and they give them the tools

233
0:11:26.34,000 --> 0:11:28,000
to go through the process and to refine it,

234
0:11:28.38,000 --> 0:11:3,000
and it's something like working with an architect,

235
0:11:30.78,000 --> 0:11:31,000
where the dialogue starts

236
0:11:32.06,000 --> 0:11:36,000
when you give an alternative to a person to react to.

237
0:11:38.06,000 --> 0:11:42,000
Now, the most interesting implementation of that for us

238
0:11:42.78,000 --> 0:11:44,000
is when you can begin to have robotic walls,

239
0:11:44.86,000 --> 0:11:47,000
so your space can convert from exercise to a workplace,

240
0:11:48.7,000 --> 0:11:49,000
if you run a virtual company.

241
0:11:50.46,000 --> 0:11:51,000
You have guests over,

242
0:11:51.634,000 --> 0:11:54,000
you have two guest rooms that are developed.

243
0:11:55.34,000 --> 0:11:58,000
You have a conventional one-bedroom arrangement

244
0:11:59.22,000 --> 0:12:,000
when you need it.

245
0:12:00.448,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Maybe that's most of the time.

246
0:12:02,000 --> 0:12:03,000
You have a dinner party.

247
0:12:03.18,000 --> 0:12:07,000
The table folds out to fit 16 people in otherwise a conventional one-bedroom,

248
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
or maybe you want a dance studio.

249
0:12:08.9,000 --> 0:12:11,000
I mean, architects have been thinking about these ideas for a long time.

250
0:12:12.34,000 --> 0:12:14,000
What we need to do now,

251
0:12:14.58,000 --> 0:12:19,000
develop things that can scale to those 300 million Chinese people

252
0:12:20.1,000 --> 0:12:24,000
that would like to live in the city, and very comfortably.

253
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
We think we can make a very small apartment

254
0:12:26.58,000 --> 0:12:31,000
that functions as if it's twice as big by utilizing these strategies.

255
0:12:31.94,000 --> 0:12:34,000
I don't believe in smart homes. That's sort of a bogus concept.

256
0:12:35.5,000 --> 0:12:38,000
I think you have to build dumb homes and put smart stuff in it.

257
0:12:38.74,000 --> 0:12:4,000
(Laughter)

258
0:12:41.02,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And so we've been working on a chassis of the wall itself.

259
0:12:46.46,000 --> 0:12:47,000
You know, standardized platform

260
0:12:48.02,000 --> 0:12:5,000
with the motors and the battery when it operates,

261
0:12:50.82,000 --> 0:12:54,000
little solenoids that will lock it in place and get low-voltage power.

262
0:12:55.38,000 --> 0:12:56,000
We think this can all be standardized,

263
0:12:57.22,000 --> 0:13:,000
and then people can personalize the stuff that goes into that wall,

264
0:13:01.18,000 --> 0:13:03,000
and like the car, we can integrate all kinds of sensing

265
0:13:03.9,000 --> 0:13:05,000
to be aware of human activity,

266
0:13:06.3,000 --> 0:13:09,000
so if there's a baby or a puppy in the way,

267
0:13:09.62,000 --> 0:13:1,000
you won't have a problem.

268
0:13:10.86,000 --> 0:13:11,000
(Laughter)

269
0:13:11.9,000 --> 0:13:13,000
So the developers say, well, this is great.

270
0:13:14.66,000 --> 0:13:18,000
OK, so if we have a conventional building, we have a fixed envelope,

271
0:13:18.74,000 --> 0:13:2,000
maybe we can put in 14 units.

272
0:13:20.82,000 --> 0:13:22,000
If they function as if they're twice as big,

273
0:13:22.94,000 --> 0:13:23,000
we can get 28 units in.

274
0:13:24.5,000 --> 0:13:26,000
That means twice as much parking, though.

275
0:13:26.549,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Parking's really expensive.

276
0:13:27.88,000 --> 0:13:29,000
It's about 70,000 dollars per space

277
0:13:30.54,000 --> 0:13:33,000
to build a conventional parking spot inside a building.

278
0:13:34.34,000 --> 0:13:37,000
So if you can have folding and autonomy,

279
0:13:37.94,000 --> 0:13:39,000
you can do that in one-seventh of the space.

280
0:13:40.38,000 --> 0:13:42,000
That goes down to 10,000 dollars per car,

281
0:13:42.58,000 --> 0:13:43,000
just for the cost of the parking.

282
0:13:44.18,000 --> 0:13:47,000
You add shared use, and you can even go further.

283
0:13:48.14,000 --> 0:13:51,000
We can also integrate all kinds of advanced technology

284
0:13:51.22,000 --> 0:13:52,000
through this process.

285
0:13:52.46,000 --> 0:13:55,000
There's a path to market for innovative companies

286
0:13:55.62,000 --> 0:13:56,000
to bring technology into the home.

287
0:13:57.3,000 --> 0:13:59,000
In this case, a project we're doing with Siemens.

288
0:13:59.9,000 --> 0:14:01,000
We have sensors on all the furniture, all the infill,

289
0:14:02.5,000 --> 0:14:04,000
that understands where people are and what they're doing.

290
0:14:05.22,000 --> 0:14:06,000
Blue light is very efficient,

291
0:14:06.94,000 --> 0:14:1,000
so we have these tunable 24-bit LED lighting fixtures.

292
0:14:11.1,000 --> 0:14:15,000
It recognizes where the person is, what they're doing,

293
0:14:15.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
fills out the light when necessary to full spectrum white light,

294
0:14:19.5,000 --> 0:14:25,000
and saves maybe 30, 40 percent in energy consumption, we think,

295
0:14:25.74,000 --> 0:14:3,000
over even conventional state-of-the-art lighting systems.

296
0:14:31.22,000 --> 0:14:34,000
This just shows you the data that comes from the sensors

297
0:14:34.66,000 --> 0:14:35,000
that are embedded in the furniture.

298
0:14:36.38,000 --> 0:14:38,000
We don't really believe in cameras to do things in homes.

299
0:14:39.22,000 --> 0:14:42,000
We think these little wireless sensors are more effective.

300
0:14:43.22,000 --> 0:14:45,000
We think we can also personalize sunlight.

301
0:14:45.5,000 --> 0:14:47,000
That's sort of the ultimate personalization in some ways.

302
0:14:48.191,000 --> 0:14:5,000
So we've looked at articulating mirrors of the facade

303
0:14:51.18,000 --> 0:14:54,000
that can throw shafts of sunlight anywhere into the space,

304
0:14:55.1,000 --> 0:14:57,000
therefore allowing you to shade most of the glass

305
0:14:57.5,000 --> 0:14:59,000
on a hot day like today.

306
0:14:59.74,000 --> 0:15:,000
In this case, she picks up her phone,

307
0:15:01.62,000 --> 0:15:05,000
she can map food preparation at the kitchen island

308
0:15:06.22,000 --> 0:15:08,000
to a particular location of sunlight.

309
0:15:08.66,000 --> 0:15:13,000
An algorithm will keep it in that location as long as she's engaged in that activity.

310
0:15:13.86,000 --> 0:15:15,000
This can be combined with LED lighting as well.

311
0:15:18.02,000 --> 0:15:2,000
We think workplaces should be shared.

312
0:15:20.14,000 --> 0:15:22,000
I mean, this is really the workplace of the future, I think.

313
0:15:22.974,000 --> 0:15:23,000
This is Starbucks, you know.

314
0:15:24.494,000 --> 0:15:25,000
Maybe a third --

315
0:15:25.7,000 --> 0:15:27,000
And you see everybody has their back to the wall

316
0:15:27.98,000 --> 0:15:29,000
and they have food and coffee down the way

317
0:15:30.004,000 --> 0:15:32,000
and they're in their own little personal bubble.

318
0:15:32.46,000 --> 0:15:34,000
We need shared spaces for interaction and collaboration.

319
0:15:35.18,000 --> 0:15:37,000
We're not doing a very good job with that.

320
0:15:37.42,000 --> 0:15:41,000
At the Cambridge Innovation Center, you can have shared desks.

321
0:15:41.5,000 --> 0:15:45,000
I've spent a lot of time in Finland at the design factory of Aalto University,

322
0:15:46.22,000 --> 0:15:5,000
where the they have a shared shop and shared fab lab, shared quiet spaces,

323
0:15:50.94,000 --> 0:15:54,000
electronics spaces, recreation places.

324
0:15:55.1,000 --> 0:15:58,000
We think ultimately, all of this stuff can come together,

325
0:15:58.58,000 --> 0:16:01,000
a new model for mobility, a new model for housing,

326
0:16:02.3,000 --> 0:16:04,000
a new model for how we live and work,

327
0:16:04.62,000 --> 0:16:06,000
a path to market for advanced technologies.

328
0:16:07.46,000 --> 0:16:09,000
But in the end, the main thing we need to focus on are people.

329
0:16:10.389,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Cities are all about people.

330
0:16:11.98,000 --> 0:16:13,000
They're places for people.

331
0:16:14.02,000 --> 0:16:16,000
There's no reason why we can't dramatically improve

332
0:16:16.5,000 --> 0:16:18,000
the livability and creativity of cities

333
0:16:18.82,000 --> 0:16:21,000
like they've done in Melbourne with the laneways

334
0:16:22.74,000 --> 0:16:26,000
while at the same time dramatically reducing CO2 and energy.

335
0:16:27.34,000 --> 0:16:3,000
It's a global imperative. We have to get this right.

336
0:16:30.7,000 --> 0:16:31,000
Thank you.

337
0:16:31.94,000 --> 0:16:35,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.992,000 --> 0:00:13,000
This year, Germany is celebrating

2
0:00:14.47,000 --> 0:00:17,000
the 25th anniversary of the peaceful revolution

3
0:00:17.556,000 --> 0:00:18,000
in East Germany.

4
0:00:19.092,000 --> 0:00:23,000
In 1989, the Communist regime was moved away,

5
0:00:23.858,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the Berlin Wall came down, and one year later,

6
0:00:27.32,000 --> 0:00:31,000
the German Democratic Republic, the GDR,

7
0:00:31.485,000 --> 0:00:32,000
in the East was unified

8
0:00:33.154,000 --> 0:00:35,000
with the Federal Republic of Germany in the West

9
0:00:35.844,000 --> 0:00:38,000
to found today's Germany.

10
0:00:39.117,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Among many other things, Germany inherited

11
0:00:42.511,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the archives of the East German secret police,

12
0:00:47.104,000 --> 0:00:5,000
known as the Stasi.

13
0:00:50.42,000 --> 0:00:52,000
Only two years after its dissolution,

14
0:00:52.96,000 --> 0:00:55,000
its documents were opened to the public,

15
0:00:56.602,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and historians such as me started

16
0:00:59.677,000 --> 0:01:,000
to study these documents

17
0:01:01.105,000 --> 0:01:05,000
to learn more about how the GDR surveillance state

18
0:01:05.797,000 --> 0:01:06,000
functioned.

19
0:01:07.507,000 --> 0:01:09,000
Perhaps you have watched the movie

20
0:01:10.303,000 --> 0:01:12,000
"The Lives of Others."

21
0:01:12.341,000 --> 0:01:16,000
This movie made the Stasi known worldwide,

22
0:01:17.092,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and as we live in an age where words

23
0:01:19.942,000 --> 0:01:22,000
such as "surveillance" or "wiretapping"

24
0:01:23.229,000 --> 0:01:25,000
are on the front pages of newspapers,

25
0:01:25.979,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I would like to speak about how the Stasi

26
0:01:28.802,000 --> 0:01:3,000
really worked.

27
0:01:31.201,000 --> 0:01:33,000
At the beginning, let's have a short look

28
0:01:33.97,000 --> 0:01:34,000
at the history of the Stasi,

29
0:01:35.928,000 --> 0:01:37,000
because it's really important for understanding

30
0:01:38.219,000 --> 0:01:41,000
its self-conception.

31
0:01:41.706,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Its origins are located in Russia.

32
0:01:44.418,000 --> 0:01:46,000
In 1917, the Russian Communists founded

33
0:01:46.736,000 --> 0:01:48,000
the Emergency Commission for Combating

34
0:01:48.93,000 --> 0:01:5,000
Counter-Revolution and Sabotage,

35
0:01:51.731,000 --> 0:01:53,000
shortly Cheka.

36
0:01:53.95,000 --> 0:01:56,000
It was led by Felix Dzerzhinsky.

37
0:01:56.96,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The Cheka was an instrument of the Communists

38
0:02:00.203,000 --> 0:02:03,000
to establish their regime by terrorizing the population

39
0:02:03.96,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and executing their enemies.

40
0:02:06.435,000 --> 0:02:11,000
It evolved later into the well-known KGB.

41
0:02:12.244,000 --> 0:02:15,000
The Cheka was the idol of the Stasi officers.

42
0:02:15.75,000 --> 0:02:18,000
They called themselves Chekists,

43
0:02:18.822,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and even the emblem was very similar,

44
0:02:21.68,000 --> 0:02:23,000
as you can see here.

45
0:02:24.661,000 --> 0:02:27,000
In fact, the secret police of Russia

46
0:02:28.227,000 --> 0:02:31,000
was the creator and instructor of the Stasi.

47
0:02:31.518,000 --> 0:02:34,000
When the Red Army occupied East Germany in 1945,

48
0:02:35.109,000 --> 0:02:37,000
it immediately expanded there,

49
0:02:37.497,000 --> 0:02:4,000
and soon it started to train the German Communists

50
0:02:41.118,000 --> 0:02:44,000
to build up their own secret police.

51
0:02:44.366,000 --> 0:02:47,000
By the way, in this hall where we are now,

52
0:02:47.886,000 --> 0:02:52,000
the ruling party of the GDR was founded in 1946.

53
0:02:53.566,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Five years later, the Stasi was established,

54
0:02:56.95,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and step by step, the dirty job of oppression

55
0:02:59.569,000 --> 0:03:01,000
was handed over to it.

56
0:03:02.111,000 --> 0:03:04,000
For instance, the central jail

57
0:03:04.542,000 --> 0:03:05,000
for political prisoners,

58
0:03:05.856,000 --> 0:03:07,000
which was established by the Russians,

59
0:03:08.604,000 --> 0:03:1,000
was taken over by the Stasi

60
0:03:10.864,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and used until the end of Communism.

61
0:03:14.048,000 --> 0:03:15,000
You see it here.

62
0:03:15.85,000 --> 0:03:18,000
At the beginning, every important step

63
0:03:19.485,000 --> 0:03:22,000
took place under the attendance of the Russians.

64
0:03:23.04,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But the Germans are known to be very effective,

65
0:03:26.141,000 --> 0:03:29,000
so the Stasi grew very quickly,

66
0:03:29.519,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and already in 1953, it had more employees

67
0:03:33.207,000 --> 0:03:34,000
than the Gestapo had,

68
0:03:34.905,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the secret police of Nazi Germany.

69
0:03:37.695,000 --> 0:03:39,000
The number doubled in each decade.

70
0:03:40.133,000 --> 0:03:43,000
In 1989, more than 90,000 employees

71
0:03:43.558,000 --> 0:03:44,000
worked for the Stasi.

72
0:03:45.223,000 --> 0:03:47,000
This meant that one employee

73
0:03:47.597,000 --> 0:03:5,000
was responsible for 180 inhabitants,

74
0:03:50.81,000 --> 0:03:53,000
which was really unique in the world.

75
0:03:54.809,000 --> 0:03:56,000
At the top of this tremendous apparatus,

76
0:03:57.405,000 --> 0:04:,000
there was one man, Erich Mielke.

77
0:04:01.189,000 --> 0:04:03,000
He ruled the Ministry of State Security

78
0:04:03.45,000 --> 0:04:05,000
for more than 30 years.

79
0:04:05.769,000 --> 0:04:07,000
He was a scrupulous functionary —

80
0:04:08.4,000 --> 0:04:1,000
in his past, he killed two policemen

81
0:04:11.122,000 --> 0:04:13,000
not far away from here —

82
0:04:13.13,000 --> 0:04:17,000
who in fact personalized the Stasi.

83
0:04:17.197,000 --> 0:04:21,000
But what was so exceptional about the Stasi?

84
0:04:21.69,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Foremost, it was its enormous power,

85
0:04:24.6,000 --> 0:04:27,000
because it united different functions

86
0:04:28.09,000 --> 0:04:3,000
in one organization.

87
0:04:30.365,000 --> 0:04:32,000
First of all, the Stasi

88
0:04:32.476,000 --> 0:04:35,000
was an intelligence service.

89
0:04:35.571,000 --> 0:04:37,000
It used all the imaginable instruments

90
0:04:38.05,000 --> 0:04:4,000
for getting information secretly,

91
0:04:40.333,000 --> 0:04:43,000
such as informers, or tapping phones,

92
0:04:43.934,000 --> 0:04:45,000
as you can see it on the picture here.

93
0:04:46.802,000 --> 0:04:49,000
And it was not only active in East Germany,

94
0:04:49.806,000 --> 0:04:51,000
but all over the world.

95
0:04:52.543,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Secondly, the Stasi was a secret police.

96
0:04:56.506,000 --> 0:04:58,000
It could stop people on the street

97
0:04:58.65,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and arrest them in its own prisons.

98
0:05:03.078,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Thirdly, the Stasi worked

99
0:05:04.58,000 --> 0:05:06,000
as a kind of public prosecutor.

100
0:05:07.435,000 --> 0:05:1,000
It had the right to open preliminary investigations

101
0:05:10.565,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and to interrogate people officially.

102
0:05:14.262,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Last but not least,

103
0:05:16.353,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the Stasi had its own armed forces.

104
0:05:20.218,000 --> 0:05:22,000
More than 11,000 soldiers were serving

105
0:05:22.222,000 --> 0:05:25,000
in its so-called Guards Regiment.

106
0:05:25.732,000 --> 0:05:29,000
It was founded to crash down protests and uprisings.

107
0:05:30.148,000 --> 0:05:32,000
Due to this concentration of power,

108
0:05:32.875,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the Stasi was called a state in the state.

109
0:05:37.94,000 --> 0:05:39,000
But let's look in more and more detail

110
0:05:40.199,000 --> 0:05:42,000
at the tools of the Stasi.

111
0:05:42.816,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Please keep in mind that at that time

112
0:05:44.459,000 --> 0:05:47,000
the web and smartphones were not yet invented.

113
0:05:48.284,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Of course, the Stasi used all kinds

114
0:05:51.525,000 --> 0:05:54,000
of technical instruments to survey people.

115
0:05:54.598,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Telephones were wiretapped,

116
0:05:56.711,000 --> 0:06:,000
including the phone of the German chancellor in the West,

117
0:06:00.85,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and often also the apartments.

118
0:06:03.802,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Every day, 90,000 letters were being opened

119
0:06:07.195,000 --> 0:06:1,000
by these machines.

120
0:06:10.541,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The Stasi also shadowed tens of thousands of people

121
0:06:14.239,000 --> 0:06:17,000
using specially trained agents and secret cameras

122
0:06:17.471,000 --> 0:06:2,000
to document every step one took.

123
0:06:21.006,000 --> 0:06:23,000
In this picture, you can see me

124
0:06:23.674,000 --> 0:06:26,000
as a young man just in front of this building

125
0:06:27.154,000 --> 0:06:3,000
where we are now, photographed by a Stasi agent.

126
0:06:30.908,000 --> 0:06:34,000
The Stasi even collected the smell of people.

127
0:06:35.304,000 --> 0:06:38,000
It stored samples of it in closed jars

128
0:06:38.563,000 --> 0:06:42,000
which were found after the peaceful revolution.

129
0:06:43.022,000 --> 0:06:47,000
For all these tasks, highly specialized departments

130
0:06:47.258,000 --> 0:06:49,000
were responsible.

131
0:06:49.626,000 --> 0:06:51,000
The one which was tapping phone calls

132
0:06:51.806,000 --> 0:06:52,000
was completely separated

133
0:06:53.696,000 --> 0:06:55,000
from the one which controlled the letters,

134
0:06:56.242,000 --> 0:06:57,000
for good reasons,

135
0:06:57.54,000 --> 0:07:01,000
because if one agent quit the Stasi,

136
0:07:02.217,000 --> 0:07:03,000
his knowledge was very small.

137
0:07:04.131,000 --> 0:07:07,000
Contrast that with Snowden, for example.

138
0:07:08.119,000 --> 0:07:11,000
But the vertical specialization was also important

139
0:07:11.196,000 --> 0:07:13,000
to prevent all kinds of empathy

140
0:07:13.501,000 --> 0:07:15,000
with the object of observation.

141
0:07:16.496,000 --> 0:07:18,000
The agent who shadowed me

142
0:07:18.8,000 --> 0:07:19,000
didn't know who I was

143
0:07:20.657,000 --> 0:07:21,000
or why I was surveyed.

144
0:07:22.522,000 --> 0:07:23,000
In fact, I smuggled forbidden books

145
0:07:24.136,000 --> 0:07:26,000
from West to East Germany.

146
0:07:27.028,000 --> 0:07:3,000
But what was even more typical for the Stasi

147
0:07:30.22,000 --> 0:07:33,000
was the use of human intelligence,

148
0:07:33.384,000 --> 0:07:37,000
people who reported secretly to the Stasi.

149
0:07:37.577,000 --> 0:07:38,000
For the Minister of State Security,

150
0:07:39.379,000 --> 0:07:41,000
these so-called unofficial employees

151
0:07:42.291,000 --> 0:07:44,000
were the most important tools.

152
0:07:45.186,000 --> 0:07:5,000
From 1975 on, nearly 200,000 people

153
0:07:50.509,000 --> 0:07:52,000
collaborated constantly with the Stasi,

154
0:07:53.346,000 --> 0:07:57,000
more than one percent of the population.

155
0:07:58.222,000 --> 0:08:,000
And in a way, the minister was right,

156
0:08:00.95,000 --> 0:08:01,000
because technical instruments

157
0:08:02.891,000 --> 0:08:05,000
can only register what people are doing,

158
0:08:06.463,000 --> 0:08:09,000
but agents and spies can also report

159
0:08:09.771,000 --> 0:08:1,000
what people are planning to do

160
0:08:11.474,000 --> 0:08:13,000
and what they are thinking.

161
0:08:13.834,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Therefore, the Stasi recruited so many informants.

162
0:08:18.615,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The system of how to get them

163
0:08:21.459,000 --> 0:08:24,000
and how to educate them, as it was called,

164
0:08:24.491,000 --> 0:08:26,000
was very sophisticated.

165
0:08:27.181,000 --> 0:08:29,000
The Stasi had its own university,

166
0:08:30.088,000 --> 0:08:31,000
not far away from here,

167
0:08:31.608,000 --> 0:08:32,000
where the methods were explored

168
0:08:33.535,000 --> 0:08:35,000
and taught to the officers.

169
0:08:36.204,000 --> 0:08:39,000
This guideline gave a detailed description

170
0:08:39.955,000 --> 0:08:41,000
of every step you have to take

171
0:08:42.578,000 --> 0:08:44,000
if you want to convince human beings

172
0:08:44.94,000 --> 0:08:47,000
to betray their fellow citizens.

173
0:08:48.92,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Sometimes it's said that informants were pressured

174
0:08:52.264,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to becoming one,

175
0:08:53.72,000 --> 0:08:55,000
but that's mostly not true,

176
0:08:56.314,000 --> 0:08:59,000
because a forced informant is a bad informant.

177
0:09:00.225,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Only someone who wants to give you the information you need

178
0:09:03.312,000 --> 0:09:05,000
is an effective whistleblower.

179
0:09:05.973,000 --> 0:09:09,000
The main reasons why people cooperated with the Stasi

180
0:09:10.83,000 --> 0:09:15,000
were political conviction and material benefits.

181
0:09:16.33,000 --> 0:09:19,000
The officers also tried to create a personal bond

182
0:09:19.44,000 --> 0:09:22,000
between themselves and the informant,

183
0:09:22.848,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and to be honest, the example of the Stasi shows

184
0:09:28,000 --> 0:09:31,000
that it's not so difficult to win someone

185
0:09:31.392,000 --> 0:09:34,000
in order to betray others.

186
0:09:34.835,000 --> 0:09:37,000
Even some of the top dissidents in East Germany

187
0:09:38.586,000 --> 0:09:39,000
collaborated with the Stasi,

188
0:09:40.421,000 --> 0:09:43,000
as for instance Ibrahim Böhme.

189
0:09:44.166,000 --> 0:09:46,000
In 1989, he was the leader of the peaceful revolution

190
0:09:46.956,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and he nearly became the first freely elected Prime Minister of the GDR

191
0:09:51.33,000 --> 0:09:56,000
until it came out that he was an informant.

192
0:09:56.475,000 --> 0:09:59,000
The net of spies was really broad.

193
0:10:00.404,000 --> 0:10:01,000
In nearly every institution,

194
0:10:02.11,000 --> 0:10:05,000
even in the churches or in West Germany,

195
0:10:05.355,000 --> 0:10:07,000
there were many of them.

196
0:10:07.543,000 --> 0:10:1,000
I remember telling a leading Stasi officer,

197
0:10:11.032,000 --> 0:10:14,000
"If you had sent an informant to me,

198
0:10:14.461,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I would surely have recognized him."

199
0:10:17.091,000 --> 0:10:18,000
His answer was,

200
0:10:18.95,000 --> 0:10:19,000
"We didn't send anyone.

201
0:10:20.393,000 --> 0:10:23,000
We took those who were around you."

202
0:10:23.415,000 --> 0:10:25,000
And in fact, two of my best friends

203
0:10:26.07,000 --> 0:10:3,000
reported about me to the Stasi.

204
0:10:30.401,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Not only in my case, informers were very close.

205
0:10:32.99,000 --> 0:10:35,000
For example, Vera Lengsfeld, another leading dissident,

206
0:10:36.693,000 --> 0:10:4,000
in her case it was her husband who spied on her.

207
0:10:40.906,000 --> 0:10:43,000
A famous writer was betrayed by his brother.

208
0:10:44.259,000 --> 0:10:47,000
This reminds me of the novel "1984" by George Orwell,

209
0:10:48.151,000 --> 0:10:51,000
where the only apparently trustable person

210
0:10:51.23,000 --> 0:10:53,000
was an informer.

211
0:10:54.043,000 --> 0:10:57,000
But why did the Stasi collect all this information

212
0:10:57.74,000 --> 0:10:58,000
in its archives?

213
0:10:59.661,000 --> 0:11:03,000
The main purpose was to control the society.

214
0:11:03.72,000 --> 0:11:05,000
In nearly every speech, the Stasi minister

215
0:11:06.303,000 --> 0:11:08,000
gave the order to find out who is who,

216
0:11:09.025,000 --> 0:11:12,000
which meant who thinks what.

217
0:11:12.119,000 --> 0:11:13,000
He didn't want to wait until somebody

218
0:11:13.87,000 --> 0:11:15,000
tried to act against the regime.

219
0:11:16.39,000 --> 0:11:17,000
He wanted to know in advance

220
0:11:18.28,000 --> 0:11:2,000
what people were thinking and planning.

221
0:11:21.175,000 --> 0:11:23,000
The East Germans knew, of course,

222
0:11:23.997,000 --> 0:11:26,000
that they were surrounded by informers,

223
0:11:27.167,000 --> 0:11:3,000
in a totalitarian regime that created mistrust

224
0:11:31.14,000 --> 0:11:34,000
and a state of widespread fear,

225
0:11:34.234,000 --> 0:11:37,000
the most important tools to oppress people

226
0:11:37.75,000 --> 0:11:39,000
in any dictatorship.

227
0:11:39.909,000 --> 0:11:41,000
That's why not many East Germans tried

228
0:11:42.512,000 --> 0:11:46,000
to fight against the Communist regime.

229
0:11:46.796,000 --> 0:11:5,000
If yes, the Stasi often used a method

230
0:11:51.378,000 --> 0:11:53,000
which was really diabolic.

231
0:11:54.05,000 --> 0:11:56,000
It was called Zersetzung,

232
0:11:56.236,000 --> 0:11:59,000
and it's described in another guideline.

233
0:11:59.907,000 --> 0:12:01,000
The word is difficult to translate because it means

234
0:12:02.707,000 --> 0:12:05,000
originally "biodegradation."

235
0:12:06.605,000 --> 0:12:09,000
But actually, it's a quite accurate description.

236
0:12:09.959,000 --> 0:12:12,000
The goal was to destroy secretly

237
0:12:13.518,000 --> 0:12:15,000
the self-confidence of people,

238
0:12:16.408,000 --> 0:12:19,000
for example by damaging their reputation,

239
0:12:19.521,000 --> 0:12:22,000
by organizing failures in their work,

240
0:12:22.99,000 --> 0:12:26,000
and by destroying their personal relationships.

241
0:12:27.62,000 --> 0:12:32,000
Considering this, East Germany was a very modern dictatorship.

242
0:12:32.995,000 --> 0:12:36,000
The Stasi didn't try to arrest every dissident.

243
0:12:37.366,000 --> 0:12:4,000
It preferred to paralyze them,

244
0:12:40.457,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and it could do so because

245
0:12:42.96,000 --> 0:12:45,000
it had access to so much personal information

246
0:12:46.31,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and to so many institutions.

247
0:12:50.24,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Detaining someone was used only

248
0:12:52.512,000 --> 0:12:54,000
as a last resort.

249
0:12:55.042,000 --> 0:12:58,000
For this, the Stasi owned 17 remand prisons,

250
0:12:58.347,000 --> 0:13:,000
one in every district.

251
0:13:00.864,000 --> 0:13:02,000
Here, the Stasi also developed

252
0:13:03.538,000 --> 0:13:07,000
quite modern methods of detention.

253
0:13:07.98,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Normally, the interrogation officer

254
0:13:09.763,000 --> 0:13:12,000
didn't torture the prisoner.

255
0:13:13.226,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Instead, he used a sophisticated system

256
0:13:15.802,000 --> 0:13:17,000
of psychological pressure

257
0:13:17.94,000 --> 0:13:21,000
in which strict isolation was central.

258
0:13:22.034,000 --> 0:13:24,000
Nearly no prisoner resisted

259
0:13:24.318,000 --> 0:13:27,000
without giving a testimony.

260
0:13:27.547,000 --> 0:13:29,000
If you have the occasion,

261
0:13:29.609,000 --> 0:13:32,000
do visit the former Stasi prison in Berlin

262
0:13:33.06,000 --> 0:13:36,000
and attend a guided tour with a former political prisoner

263
0:13:36.649,000 --> 0:13:38,000
who will explain to you how this worked.

264
0:13:39.505,000 --> 0:13:42,000
One more question needs to be answered:

265
0:13:42.664,000 --> 0:13:44,000
If the Stasi were so well organized,

266
0:13:45.106,000 --> 0:13:49,000
why did the Communist regime collapse?

267
0:13:49.439,000 --> 0:13:53,000
First, in 1989, the leadership in East Germany

268
0:13:53.57,000 --> 0:13:55,000
was uncertain what to do against

269
0:13:55.831,000 --> 0:13:57,000
the growing protest of people.

270
0:13:58.768,000 --> 0:14:,000
It was especially confused

271
0:14:01.119,000 --> 0:14:03,000
because in the mother country of socialism,

272
0:14:03.89,000 --> 0:14:04,000
the Soviet Union,

273
0:14:05.41,000 --> 0:14:08,000
a more liberal policy took place.

274
0:14:08.793,000 --> 0:14:1,000
In addition, the regime was dependent

275
0:14:11.21,000 --> 0:14:14,000
on the loans from the West.

276
0:14:14.602,000 --> 0:14:16,000
Therefore, no order to crash down the uprising

277
0:14:17.15,000 --> 0:14:2,000
was given to the Stasi.

278
0:14:20.227,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Secondly, in the Communist ideology,

279
0:14:23.86,000 --> 0:14:25,000
there's no place for criticism.

280
0:14:26.513,000 --> 0:14:28,000
Instead, the leadership stuck to the belief

281
0:14:28.82,000 --> 0:14:3,000
that socialism is a perfect system,

282
0:14:31.614,000 --> 0:14:35,000
and the Stasi had to confirm that, of course.

283
0:14:35.865,000 --> 0:14:37,000
The consequence was

284
0:14:38.226,000 --> 0:14:4,000
that despite all the information,

285
0:14:40.722,000 --> 0:14:44,000
the regime couldn't analyze its real problems,

286
0:14:44.886,000 --> 0:14:46,000
and therefore it couldn't solve them.

287
0:14:47.571,000 --> 0:14:49,000
In the end, the Stasi died

288
0:14:50.275,000 --> 0:14:51,000
because of the structures

289
0:14:52.068,000 --> 0:14:55,000
that it was charged with protecting.

290
0:14:55.788,000 --> 0:14:57,000
The ending of the Stasi

291
0:14:57.858,000 --> 0:14:59,000
was something tragic,

292
0:14:59.905,000 --> 0:15:01,000
because these officers

293
0:15:01.964,000 --> 0:15:04,000
were kept busy during the peaceful revolution

294
0:15:05.032,000 --> 0:15:06,000
with only one thing:

295
0:15:07.007,000 --> 0:15:09,000
to destroy the documents

296
0:15:09.66,000 --> 0:15:12,000
they had produced during decades.

297
0:15:13.351,000 --> 0:15:14,000
Fortunately,

298
0:15:15.269,000 --> 0:15:18,000
they had been stopped by human rights activists.

299
0:15:18.806,000 --> 0:15:2,000
That's why today we can use the files

300
0:15:21.732,000 --> 0:15:22,000
to get a better understanding

301
0:15:23.356,000 --> 0:15:25,000
of how a surveillance state functions.

302
0:15:26.136,000 --> 0:15:27,000
Thank you.

303
0:15:28.133,000 --> 0:15:32,000
(Applause)

304
0:15:36.518,000 --> 0:15:42,000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you. Thank you very much.

305
0:15:42.578,000 --> 0:15:44,000
So Hubertus, I want to ask you a couple of questions

306
0:15:45.302,000 --> 0:15:47,000
because I have here Der Spiegel from last week.

307
0:15:48.09,000 --> 0:15:52,000
"Mein Nachbar NSA." My neighbor, the NSA.

308
0:15:52.964,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And you just told us about my neighbor,

309
0:15:55.595,000 --> 0:15:57,000
the spies and the informant from East Germany.

310
0:15:58.583,000 --> 0:16:,000
So there is a direct link between these two stories

311
0:16:01.283,000 --> 0:16:02,000
or there isn't?

312
0:16:03.161,000 --> 0:16:05,000
What's your reaction as a historian when you see this?

313
0:16:05.183,000 --> 0:16:06,000
Hubertus Knabe: I think there are

314
0:16:06.908,000 --> 0:16:07,000
several aspects to mention.

315
0:16:08.811,000 --> 0:16:11,000
At first, I think there's a difference

316
0:16:11.877,000 --> 0:16:15,000
of why you are collecting this data.

317
0:16:15.965,000 --> 0:16:17,000
Are you doing that for protecting your people

318
0:16:18.283,000 --> 0:16:19,000
against terrorist attacks,

319
0:16:19.83,000 --> 0:16:21,000
or are you doing that for oppressing your people?

320
0:16:22.6,000 --> 0:16:23,000
So that makes a fundamental difference.

321
0:16:24.542,000 --> 0:16:26,000
But on the other hand,

322
0:16:26.891,000 --> 0:16:3,000
also in a democracy, these instruments can be abused,

323
0:16:31.21,000 --> 0:16:33,000
and that is something where we really have

324
0:16:33.376,000 --> 0:16:34,000
to be aware to stop that,

325
0:16:34.761,000 --> 0:16:36,000
and that also the intelligence services

326
0:16:37.634,000 --> 0:16:4,000
are respecting the rules we have.

327
0:16:40.755,000 --> 0:16:41,000
The third point, probably,

328
0:16:42.255,000 --> 0:16:45,000
we really can be happy that we live in a democracy,

329
0:16:45.543,000 --> 0:16:48,000
because you can be sure that Russia and China

330
0:16:49.223,000 --> 0:16:5,000
are doing the same,

331
0:16:50.755,000 --> 0:16:51,000
but nobody speaks about that

332
0:16:52.321,000 --> 0:16:54,000
because nobody could do that.

333
0:16:54.612,000 --> 0:16:58,000
(Applause)

334
0:17:01.398,000 --> 0:17:03,000
BG: When the story came out first,

335
0:17:03.451,000 --> 0:17:05,000
last July, last year,

336
0:17:05.646,000 --> 0:17:07,000
you filed a criminal complaint

337
0:17:08.474,000 --> 0:17:1,000
with a German tribunal. Why?

338
0:17:11.454,000 --> 0:17:14,000
HK: Yeah, I did so because of the second point I mentioned,

339
0:17:14.667,000 --> 0:17:16,000
that I think especially in a democracy,

340
0:17:17.564,000 --> 0:17:2,000
the rules are for everybody.

341
0:17:21.022,000 --> 0:17:23,000
They are made for everybody, so it's not allowed

342
0:17:23.386,000 --> 0:17:26,000
that any institution doesn't respect the rules.

343
0:17:27.177,000 --> 0:17:28,000
In the criminal code of Germany, it's written

344
0:17:29.155,000 --> 0:17:3,000
that it's not allowed to tap somebody

345
0:17:31.01,000 --> 0:17:33,000
without the permission of the judge.

346
0:17:33.398,000 --> 0:17:36,000
Fortunately, it's written in the criminal code of Germany,

347
0:17:37.219,000 --> 0:17:4,000
so if it's not respected, then I think

348
0:17:41.15,000 --> 0:17:42,000
an investigation is necessary,

349
0:17:43.046,000 --> 0:17:44,000
and it took a very long time that

350
0:17:45.025,000 --> 0:17:47,000
the public prosecutor of Germany started this,

351
0:17:47.131,000 --> 0:17:5,000
and he started it only in the case of Angela Merkel,

352
0:17:50.702,000 --> 0:17:52,000
and not in the case of all the other people living in Germany.

353
0:17:53.658,000 --> 0:17:55,000
BG: That doesn't surprise me because —

354
0:17:56.131,000 --> 0:17:58,000
(Applause) —

355
0:17:58.254,000 --> 0:18:01,000
because of the story you told.

356
0:18:01.697,000 --> 0:18:03,000
Seen from the outside, I live outside of Germany,

357
0:18:04.18,000 --> 0:18:05,000
and I expected the Germans to react

358
0:18:05.957,000 --> 0:18:08,000
much more strongly, immediately.

359
0:18:09.177,000 --> 0:18:11,000
And instead, the reaction really came only

360
0:18:11.789,000 --> 0:18:12,000
when Chancellor Merkel was revealed

361
0:18:13.646,000 --> 0:18:16,000
as being wiretapped. Why so?

362
0:18:17.201,000 --> 0:18:18,000
HK: I take it as a good sign,

363
0:18:19.064,000 --> 0:18:23,000
because people feel secure in this democracy.

364
0:18:23.394,000 --> 0:18:25,000
They aren't afraid that they will be arrested,

365
0:18:25.608,000 --> 0:18:28,000
and if you leave this hall after the conference,

366
0:18:28.771,000 --> 0:18:3,000
nobody has to be afraid that the secret police

367
0:18:31.335,000 --> 0:18:33,000
is standing out and is arresting you.

368
0:18:33.773,000 --> 0:18:34,000
So that's a good sign, I think.

369
0:18:35.367,000 --> 0:18:37,000
People are not really scared, as they could be.

370
0:18:38.242,000 --> 0:18:42,000
But of course, I think, the institutions

371
0:18:42.596,000 --> 0:18:44,000
are responsible to stop illegal actions

372
0:18:45.163,000 --> 0:18:48,000
in Germany or wherever they happen.

373
0:18:48.281,000 --> 0:18:51,000
BG: A personal question, and this is the last one.

374
0:18:51.474,000 --> 0:18:53,000
There has been a debate in Germany about

375
0:18:53.74,000 --> 0:18:54,000
granting asylum to Edward Snowden.

376
0:18:55.281,000 --> 0:18:57,000
Would you be in favor or against?

377
0:18:58.046,000 --> 0:18:59,000
HK: Oh, that's a difficult question,

378
0:18:59.734,000 --> 0:19:,000
but if you ask me,

379
0:19:01.42,000 --> 0:19:02,000
and if I answer honestly,

380
0:19:03.075,000 --> 0:19:04,000
I would give him the asylum,

381
0:19:04.841,000 --> 0:19:06,000
because I think it was really brave what he did,

382
0:19:06.89,000 --> 0:19:08,000
and he destroyed his whole life

383
0:19:09.502,000 --> 0:19:1,000
and his family and everything.

384
0:19:11.171,000 --> 0:19:14,000
So I think, for these people, we should do something,

385
0:19:14.38,000 --> 0:19:18,000
and especially if you see the German history,

386
0:19:18.534,000 --> 0:19:2,000
where so many people had to escape

387
0:19:21.031,000 --> 0:19:23,000
and they asked for asylum in other countries

388
0:19:23.347,000 --> 0:19:24,000
and they didn't get it,

389
0:19:24.73,000 --> 0:19:26,000
so it would be a good sign to give him asylum.

390
0:19:27.567,000 --> 0:19:28,000
(Applause)

391
0:19:29.378,000 --> 0:19:35,000
BG: Hubertus, thank you very much.

1
0:00:12.833,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Once every 12 months,

2
0:00:14.238,000 --> 0:00:17,000
the world's largest human migration happens in China.

3
0:00:18.31,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Over the 40-day travel period of Chinese New Year,

4
0:00:21.063,000 --> 0:00:23,000
three billion trips are taken,

5
0:00:24.015,000 --> 0:00:25,000
as families reunite and celebrate.

6
0:00:26.596,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Now, the most strenuous of these trips are taken

7
0:00:28.895,000 --> 0:00:31,000
by the country's 290 million migrant workers,

8
0:00:32.176,000 --> 0:00:34,000
for many of whom this is the one chance a year

9
0:00:34.726,000 --> 0:00:37,000
to go home and see parents and their left-behind children.

10
0:00:39.358,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But the travel options are very limited;

11
0:00:42.012,000 --> 0:00:45,000
plane tickets cost nearly half of their monthly salary.

12
0:00:45.506,000 --> 0:00:46,000
So most of them, they choose the train.

13
0:00:48.085,000 --> 0:00:5,000
Their average journey is 700 kilometers.

14
0:00:50.569,000 --> 0:00:52,000
The average travel time is 15 and a half hours.

15
0:00:53.458,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And the country's tracks now have to handle 390 million travelers

16
0:00:58.331,000 --> 0:00:59,000
every Spring Festival.

17
0:01:00.688,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Until recently,

18
0:01:02.21,000 --> 0:01:05,000
migrant workers would have to queue for long hours -- sometimes days --

19
0:01:05.667,000 --> 0:01:06,000
just to buy tickets,

20
0:01:07.029,000 --> 0:01:09,000
often only to be fleeced by scalpers.

21
0:01:10.63,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And they still had to deal with near-stampede conditions

22
0:01:14.02,000 --> 0:01:15,000
when travel day finally arrived.

23
0:01:16.837,000 --> 0:01:18,000
But technology has started to ease this experience.

24
0:01:19.617,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Mobile and digital tickets now account for 70 percent of sales,

25
0:01:22.864,000 --> 0:01:24,000
greatly reducing the lines at train stations.

26
0:01:25.141,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Digital ID scanners have replaced manual checks,

27
0:01:27.427,000 --> 0:01:29,000
expediting the boarding process,

28
0:01:29.72,000 --> 0:01:31,000
and artificial intelligence is deployed across the network

29
0:01:32.514,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to optimize travel routes.

30
0:01:34.927,000 --> 0:01:35,000
New solutions have been invented.

31
0:01:37.649,000 --> 0:01:4,000
China's largest taxi-hailing platform, called Didi Chuxing,

32
0:01:41.538,000 --> 0:01:42,000
launched a new service called Hitch,

33
0:01:43.427,000 --> 0:01:45,000
which matches car owners who are driving home

34
0:01:46.268,000 --> 0:01:48,000
with passengers looking for long-distance routes.

35
0:01:49.632,000 --> 0:01:5,000
In just its third year,

36
0:01:50.822,000 --> 0:01:53,000
Hitch served 30 million trips in this past holiday season,

37
0:01:54.251,000 --> 0:01:57,000
the longest of which was further than 1,500 miles.

38
0:01:57.489,000 --> 0:01:59,000
That's about the distance from Miami to Boston.

39
0:02:01.368,000 --> 0:02:05,000
This enormous need of migrant workers has powered fast upgrade and innovation

40
0:02:06.323,000 --> 0:02:08,000
across the country's transport systems.

41
0:02:09.673,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Now, the Chinese internet has developed in both familiar and unfamiliar ways.

42
0:02:14.593,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Just like in Silicon Valley,

43
0:02:16.03,000 --> 0:02:19,000
some of the seismic shifts in technology and consumer behavior

44
0:02:19.355,000 --> 0:02:21,000
have been driven by academic research,

45
0:02:22.006,000 --> 0:02:23,000
have been driven by enterprise desires,

46
0:02:23.936,000 --> 0:02:26,000
with the whims of privilege and youth sprinkled in every once in a while.

47
0:02:28.038,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I am a product of the American tech industry,

48
0:02:30.871,000 --> 0:02:32,000
both as a consumer and a corporate leader.

49
0:02:33.085,000 --> 0:02:35,000
So I am well acquainted with this type of fuel.

50
0:02:36.75,000 --> 0:02:37,000
But about a year and a half ago,

51
0:02:38.345,000 --> 0:02:4,000
I moved from my home in New York City to Hong Kong

52
0:02:40.758,000 --> 0:02:42,000
to become the CEO of the South China Morning Post.

53
0:02:43.678,000 --> 0:02:45,000
And from this new vantage point,

54
0:02:46.633,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I've observed something that is far less familiar to me,

55
0:02:49.728,000 --> 0:02:53,000
propelling so much of China's innovation and many of its entrepreneurs.

56
0:02:55.355,000 --> 0:02:57,000
It is an overwhelming need economy

57
0:02:57.984,000 --> 0:02:59,000
that is serving an underprivileged populous,

58
0:03:00.744,000 --> 0:03:03,000
which has been separated for 30 years from China's economic boom.

59
0:03:05.425,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The stark gaps that exist between the rich and the poor,

60
0:03:09.514,000 --> 0:03:1,000
between urban and rural

61
0:03:10.873,000 --> 0:03:12,000
or the academic and the unschooled --

62
0:03:13.644,000 --> 0:03:15,000
these gaps, they form a soil

63
0:03:16.176,000 --> 0:03:19,000
that's ready for some incredible empowerment.

64
0:03:19.815,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So when capital and investment become focused on the needs of people

65
0:03:23.538,000 --> 0:03:26,000
who are hanging to the bottom rungs of an economic ladder,

66
0:03:27.3,000 --> 0:03:32,000
that's when we start to see the internet truly become a job creator,

67
0:03:32.663,000 --> 0:03:33,000
an education enabler

68
0:03:34.146,000 --> 0:03:36,000
and in many other ways, a path forward.

69
0:03:37.806,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Of course, China is not the only place where this alternative fuel exists,

70
0:03:41.386,000 --> 0:03:43,000
nor the only place where it is possible.

71
0:03:44.32,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But because of the country's sheer scale and status as a rising superpower,

72
0:03:48.678,000 --> 0:03:51,000
the needs of its population have created an opportunity

73
0:03:51.725,000 --> 0:03:53,000
for truly compelling impact.

74
0:03:55.509,000 --> 0:03:58,000
When explaining the rapid growth of the Chinese tech industry,

75
0:03:58.668,000 --> 0:04:,000
many observers will cite two reasons.

76
0:04:01.286,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The first is the 1.4 billion people that call China home.

77
0:04:05.442,000 --> 0:04:08,000
The second is the government's active participation --

78
0:04:08.982,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or pervasive intervention, depending on how you view it.

79
0:04:12.732,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Now, the central authorities have spent heavily on network infrastructure

80
0:04:16.237,000 --> 0:04:17,000
over the years,

81
0:04:17.435,000 --> 0:04:19,000
creating an attractive environment for investment.

82
0:04:19.863,000 --> 0:04:22,000
At the same time, they've insisted on standards and regulation,

83
0:04:23.149,000 --> 0:04:26,000
which has led to fast consensus and therefore, fast adoption.

84
0:04:27.284,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The world's largest pool of tech talent exists

85
0:04:30.276,000 --> 0:04:32,000
because of the abundance of educational incentives.

86
0:04:33.415,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And local, domestic companies, in the past, have been protected

87
0:04:37.799,000 --> 0:04:38,000
from international competition

88
0:04:39.296,000 --> 0:04:4,000
by market controls.

89
0:04:41.641,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Of course, you cannot observe the Chinese internet

90
0:04:44.053,000 --> 0:04:46,000
without finding widespread censorship

91
0:04:46.22,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and very serious concerns about dystopian monitoring.

92
0:04:49.998,000 --> 0:04:5,000
As an example:

93
0:04:51.387,000 --> 0:04:54,000
China is in the process of rolling out a social credit rating

94
0:04:54.411,000 --> 0:04:56,000
that will cover its entire population,

95
0:04:56.895,000 --> 0:04:58,000
rewarding and restricting citizens,

96
0:04:59.498,000 --> 0:05:01,000
based on highly qualitative characteristics

97
0:05:01.665,000 --> 0:05:02,000
like honesty and integrity.

98
0:05:04.442,000 --> 0:05:05,000
At the same time,

99
0:05:06.434,000 --> 0:05:07,000
China is deploying facial recognition

100
0:05:08.308,000 --> 0:05:12,000
across many of its 170 million closed-circuit cameras.

101
0:05:13.458,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Artificial intelligence is being used to predict crime and terrorism

102
0:05:17.935,000 --> 0:05:18,000
in Xinjiang province,

103
0:05:19.149,000 --> 0:05:23,000
where the Muslim minority is already under constant surveillance.

104
0:05:24.353,000 --> 0:05:28,000
Yet, the internet has continued to grow, and it is so big --

105
0:05:28.52,000 --> 0:05:3,000
much bigger than I think most of us realize.

106
0:05:31.445,000 --> 0:05:32,000
By the end of 2017,

107
0:05:33.17,000 --> 0:05:37,000
the Chinese internet population had reached 772 million users.

108
0:05:37.641,000 --> 0:05:4,000
That's larger than the populations of the United States, Russia,

109
0:05:40.68,000 --> 0:05:43,000
of Germany, of the United Kingdom, of France and Canada combined.

110
0:05:44.704,000 --> 0:05:46,000
Ninety-eight percent of them are active on mobile.

111
0:05:47.093,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Ninety-two percent of them use messaging apps.

112
0:05:49.823,000 --> 0:05:52,000
There are now 650 million digital news consumers,

113
0:05:53.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
580 million digital video consumers,

114
0:05:56.561,000 --> 0:05:59,000
and the country's largest e-commerce platform, Taobao,

115
0:05:59.657,000 --> 0:06:02,000
now boasts 580 million monthly active users.

116
0:06:03.473,000 --> 0:06:05,000
It's about 80 percent larger than Amazon.

117
0:06:06.492,000 --> 0:06:09,000
On-demand travel, between bikes and cars,

118
0:06:09.96,000 --> 0:06:12,000
now accounts for 10 billion trips a year in China.

119
0:06:13.357,000 --> 0:06:16,000
That's two-thirds of all trips taken around the world.

120
0:06:17.875,000 --> 0:06:18,000
So it's a very mixed bag.

121
0:06:20.233,000 --> 0:06:25,000
The internet exists in a restricted, arguably manipulated form within China,

122
0:06:25.538,000 --> 0:06:29,000
yet it is massive and has vastly improved the lives of its citizens.

123
0:06:30.45,000 --> 0:06:31,000
So even in its imperfection,

124
0:06:32.403,000 --> 0:06:35,000
the growth of the Chinese internet should not be dismissed,

125
0:06:35.45,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and it's worthy of our closer examination.

126
0:06:39.005,000 --> 0:06:4,000
Let me tell you two other stories today.

127
0:06:41.776,000 --> 0:06:45,000
Luo Zhaoliu is a 34-year-old engineer from Jiangxi province.

128
0:06:45.815,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Now, his home region used to be extremely important to the Communist party

129
0:06:49.348,000 --> 0:06:51,000
because this was the birthplace of the Red Army.

130
0:06:52.046,000 --> 0:06:54,000
But over the decades, because of its separation

131
0:06:54.32,000 --> 0:06:56,000
from the economic and manufacturing centers of the country,

132
0:06:57.221,000 --> 0:06:59,000
it has slid into irrelevance.

133
0:06:59.934,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Luo, like so many in his generation, left home at a young age

134
0:07:03.117,000 --> 0:07:05,000
to look for work in a major city.

135
0:07:05.141,000 --> 0:07:07,000
He ended up in Shenzhen, which is one of China's tech hubs.

136
0:07:08.768,000 --> 0:07:09,000
As the young migrate,

137
0:07:10.072,000 --> 0:07:13,000
these rural villages are left with only elderly,

138
0:07:13.228,000 --> 0:07:16,000
who are really struggling to elevate themselves above abject poverty.

139
0:07:17.854,000 --> 0:07:21,000
After nine years, Luo decided to return to Jiangxi in 2017,

140
0:07:22.419,000 --> 0:07:25,000
because he believed that the booming e-commerce marketplace in China

141
0:07:25.792,000 --> 0:07:27,000
could help him revive his village.

142
0:07:28.999,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Like many rural communities,

143
0:07:30.634,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Luo's home specialized in a very specific provincial craft --

144
0:07:34.847,000 --> 0:07:36,000
making fermented bean curd, in this case.

145
0:07:37.736,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So he started a small factory

146
0:07:40.315,000 --> 0:07:42,000
and started selling his locally made goods online.

147
0:07:43.601,000 --> 0:07:45,000
There have been many years of consumption growth

148
0:07:45.904,000 --> 0:07:46,000
across China's major cities.

149
0:07:47.271,000 --> 0:07:5,000
But recently, technology has been driving an explosion in craft goods sales

150
0:07:51.257,000 --> 0:07:53,000
among China's middle and upper classes.

151
0:07:53.907,000 --> 0:07:56,000
WeChat and other e-commerce platforms allow rural producers

152
0:07:57.048,000 --> 0:07:58,000
to market and sell their goods

153
0:07:58.919,000 --> 0:08:,000
far beyond their original distribution areas.

154
0:08:02.886,000 --> 0:08:04,000
Research companies actually track this impact

155
0:08:05.038,000 --> 0:08:07,000
by counting what is called "Taobao villages."

156
0:08:07.649,000 --> 0:08:1,000
This is any rural village where at least 10 percent of its households

157
0:08:11.379,000 --> 0:08:14,000
are selling goods online and making a certain amount of revenue.

158
0:08:14.725,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And the growth has been significant in the last few years.

159
0:08:18.091,000 --> 0:08:2,000
There were just 20 Taobao villages in 2013,

160
0:08:21.448,000 --> 0:08:22,000
212 in 2014,

161
0:08:23.21,000 --> 0:08:25,000
780 in 2015,

162
0:08:25.814,000 --> 0:08:26,000
1,300 in 2016

163
0:08:27.258,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and over 2,100 at the end of 2017.

164
0:08:30.419,000 --> 0:08:33,000
They now account for nearly half a million active online stores,

165
0:08:34.063,000 --> 0:08:37,000
19 billion dollars in annual sales

166
0:08:37.222,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and 1.3 million new jobs created.

167
0:08:41.047,000 --> 0:08:44,000
In Luo's first year back home, he was able to employ 15 villagers.

168
0:08:45.62,000 --> 0:08:48,000
And he sold about 60,000 units of fermented bean curd.

169
0:08:49.296,000 --> 0:08:51,000
He expects to hire 30 more people in the next year,

170
0:08:52.121,000 --> 0:08:53,000
as his demand rapidly rises.

171
0:08:55.927,000 --> 0:08:59,000
There are 60 million left-behind children scattered across China's rural landscape.

172
0:09:01.402,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And they grow up with at least one parent far away from home,

173
0:09:04.323,000 --> 0:09:05,000
as a migrant worker.

174
0:09:06.307,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Alongside all the general hardships of rural life,

175
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
they often have to travel vast and dangerous distances

176
0:09:12.303,000 --> 0:09:13,000
just to get to school.

177
0:09:13.855,000 --> 0:09:14,000
They account for 30 percent

178
0:09:15.291,000 --> 0:09:17,000
of the country's primary and high school students.

179
0:09:18.839,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Ten-year-old Chang Wenxuan is one of these students.

180
0:09:22.522,000 --> 0:09:25,000
He walks an hour each way every single day to school,

181
0:09:26.125,000 --> 0:09:29,000
across these deep ravines, in an isolated landscape.

182
0:09:30.847,000 --> 0:09:33,000
But when he arrives at the small farming village in Gansu province,

183
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
he will find just two other students in this entire school.

184
0:09:38.585,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Now, Chang's school is one of 1,000 in Gansu alone

185
0:09:41.786,000 --> 0:09:43,000
that has less than five registered students.

186
0:09:44.823,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So with limited student interaction,

187
0:09:47.212,000 --> 0:09:48,000
with underqualified teachers

188
0:09:48.905,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and schoolhouses that are barely furnished and not insulated,

189
0:09:52.151,000 --> 0:09:54,000
rural students have long been disadvantaged,

190
0:09:54.874,000 --> 0:09:56,000
with almost no path to higher education.

191
0:09:58.331,000 --> 0:10:01,000
But Chang's future has been dramatically shifted

192
0:10:01.498,000 --> 0:10:03,000
with the installation of a “Sunshine Classroom.”

193
0:10:04.927,000 --> 0:10:06,000
He's now part of a digital classroom of 100 students

194
0:10:07.64,000 --> 0:10:09,000
across 28 different schools,

195
0:10:09.911,000 --> 0:10:11,000
taught by qualified and certified teachers

196
0:10:11.958,000 --> 0:10:13,000
live-streaming from hundreds of miles away.

197
0:10:14.998,000 --> 0:10:16,000
He has access to new subjects like music and art,

198
0:10:17.488,000 --> 0:10:18,000
to new friends

199
0:10:18.663,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and to experiences that extend far beyond his home.

200
0:10:22.252,000 --> 0:10:25,000
Recently, Chang even got to visit the Frederiksborg Castle museum

201
0:10:25.406,000 --> 0:10:26,000
in Denmark --

202
0:10:26.602,000 --> 0:10:27,000
virtually, of course.

203
0:10:28.831,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Now, online education has existed for many years outside of China.

204
0:10:32.919,000 --> 0:10:35,000
But it has never reached truly transformative scale,

205
0:10:36.212,000 --> 0:10:38,000
likely because traditional education systems

206
0:10:38.55,000 --> 0:10:39,000
in other tech centers of the world

207
0:10:40.23,000 --> 0:10:42,000
are far more advanced and far more stable.

208
0:10:44.053,000 --> 0:10:46,000
But China's extreme terrain and size

209
0:10:46.609,000 --> 0:10:49,000
have created an enormous and immediate need for innovation.

210
0:10:50.863,000 --> 0:10:53,000
There's a tech start-up in Shenzhen that grew to 300,000 students

211
0:10:54.056,000 --> 0:10:55,000
in just one year.

212
0:10:55.307,000 --> 0:10:57,000
And by our best estimation at the Post,

213
0:10:57.45,000 --> 0:11:,000
there are now 55 million rural students across China

214
0:11:01.125,000 --> 0:11:04,000
that are addressable and accessible by live-streaming classes.

215
0:11:04.697,000 --> 0:11:07,000
This market of need is larger than the entire US student population

216
0:11:08.57,000 --> 0:11:1,000
between kindergarten and grade 12.

217
0:11:12.831,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So I'm extremely encouraged to find out

218
0:11:15.204,000 --> 0:11:17,000
that private investment in ed-tech in China

219
0:11:18.133,000 --> 0:11:19,000
now exceeds one billion dollars a year,

220
0:11:20.053,000 --> 0:11:22,000
with another 30 billion dollars in public funding

221
0:11:22.927,000 --> 0:11:24,000
that is committed between now and 2020.

222
0:11:27.585,000 --> 0:11:29,000
As the Chinese internet continues to grow,

223
0:11:29.974,000 --> 0:11:32,000
even in its imperfection and restrictions and controls,

224
0:11:33.546,000 --> 0:11:35,000
the lives of its once-forgotten populations

225
0:11:35.823,000 --> 0:11:36,000
have been irrevocably elevated.

226
0:11:38.997,000 --> 0:11:41,000
There is a focus on populations of need, not of want,

227
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
that has driven a lot of the curiosity, the creativity

228
0:11:44.823,000 --> 0:11:45,000
and the development that we see.

229
0:11:47.157,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And there's still more to come.

230
0:11:49.823,000 --> 0:11:51,000
In America, internet population, or penetration,

231
0:11:52.308,000 --> 0:11:53,000
has now reached 88 percent.

232
0:11:54.395,000 --> 0:11:58,000
In China, the internet has still only reached 56 percent of the populous.

233
0:11:58.649,000 --> 0:12:,000
That means there are over 600 million people

234
0:12:01.228,000 --> 0:12:03,000
who are still offline and disconnected.

235
0:12:04.038,000 --> 0:12:06,000
That's nearly twice the US population.

236
0:12:06.776,000 --> 0:12:07,000
An enormous opportunity.

237
0:12:10.09,000 --> 0:12:12,000
Wherever this alternative fuel exists,

238
0:12:12.765,000 --> 0:12:16,000
be it in China or Africa, Southeast Asia or the American heartland,

239
0:12:17.003,000 --> 0:12:2,000
we should endeavor to follow it with capital and with effort,

240
0:12:20.863,000 --> 0:12:23,000
driving both economic and societal impact all over the world.

241
0:12:25.176,000 --> 0:12:28,000
Just imagine for a minute what more could be possible

242
0:12:28.68,000 --> 0:12:31,000
if the global needs of the underserved become the primary focus

243
0:12:32.59,000 --> 0:12:33,000
of our inventions.

244
0:12:34.481,000 --> 0:12:35,000
Thank you.

245
0:12:35.664,000 --> 0:12:39,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:25.095,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I'm really excited to be here today.

2
0:00:26.898,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I'll show you some stuff that's just ready to come out of the lab,

3
0:00:30.024,000 --> 0:00:32,000
literally, and I'm really glad that you guys

4
0:00:32.824,000 --> 0:00:34,000
are going to be among the first to see it in person,

5
0:00:35.32,000 --> 0:00:37,000
because I really think this is going to really change

6
0:00:37.833,000 --> 0:00:39,000
the way we interact with machines from this point on.

7
0:00:40.339,000 --> 0:00:42,000
Now, this is a rear-projected drafting table.

8
0:00:43.038,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It's about 36 inches wide

9
0:00:44.284,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and it's equipped with a multi-touch sensor.

10
0:00:46.391,000 --> 0:00:47,000
Normal touch sensors that you see,

11
0:00:48.059,000 --> 0:00:5,000
like on a kiosk or interactive whiteboards,

12
0:00:50.22,000 --> 0:00:52,000
can only register one point of contact at a time.

13
0:00:53.137,000 --> 0:00:56,000
This thing allows you to have multiple points at the same time.

14
0:00:56.876,000 --> 0:00:59,000
They can use both my hands; I can use chording actions;

15
0:01:00.214,000 --> 0:01:02,000
I can just go right up and use all 10 fingers if I wanted to.

16
0:01:03.597,000 --> 0:01:04,000
You know, like that.

17
0:01:04.778,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Now, multi-touch sensing isn't completely new.

18
0:01:09.345,000 --> 0:01:12,000
People like Bill Buxton have been playing around with it in the '80s.

19
0:01:12.622,000 --> 0:01:16,000
However, the approach I built here is actually high-resolution,

20
0:01:16.674,000 --> 0:01:18,000
low-cost, and probably most importantly, very scalable.

21
0:01:2,000 --> 0:01:22,000
So, the technology, you know,

22
0:01:22.361,000 --> 0:01:24,000
isn't the most exciting thing here right now,

23
0:01:24.831,000 --> 0:01:26,000
other than probably its newfound accessibility.

24
0:01:27.173,000 --> 0:01:3,000
What's really interesting here is what you can do with it

25
0:01:30.722,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and the kind of interfaces you can build on top of it.

26
0:01:34.141,000 --> 0:01:35,000
So let's see.

27
0:01:36.111,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So, for instance, we have a lava lamp application here.

28
0:01:40.448,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now, you can see,

29
0:01:42.174,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I can use both of my hands to kind of squeeze and put the blobs together.

30
0:01:45.627,000 --> 0:01:47,000
I can inject heat into the system here,

31
0:01:48.194,000 --> 0:01:5,000
or I can pull it apart with two of my fingers.

32
0:01:50.4,000 --> 0:01:52,000
It's completely intuitive; there's no instruction manual.

33
0:01:53.154,000 --> 0:01:54,000
The interface just kind of disappears.

34
0:01:55,000 --> 0:01:56,000
This started out as a screensaver app

35
0:01:56.944,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that one of the Ph.D. students in our lab, Ilya Rosenberg, made.

36
0:02:00.015,000 --> 0:02:04,000
But I think its true identity comes out here.

37
0:02:05.153,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Now what's great about a multi-touch sensor is that, you know,

38
0:02:08.1,000 --> 0:02:1,000
I could be doing this with as many fingers here,

39
0:02:10.861,000 --> 0:02:12,000
but of course multi-touch also inherently means multi-user.

40
0:02:13.863,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Chris could be interacting with another part of Lava,

41
0:02:16.386,000 --> 0:02:17,000
while I play around with it here.

42
0:02:18.044,000 --> 0:02:2,000
You can imagine a new kind of sculpting tool,

43
0:02:20.164,000 --> 0:02:22,000
where I'm kind of warming something up, making it malleable,

44
0:02:23.167,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and then letting it cool down and solidifying in a certain state.

45
0:02:30.712,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Google should have something like this in their lobby.

46
0:02:33.683,000 --> 0:02:38,000
(Laughter)

47
0:02:39,000 --> 0:02:42,000
I'll show you a little more of a concrete example here,

48
0:02:42.296,000 --> 0:02:43,000
as this thing loads.

49
0:02:44.181,000 --> 0:02:46,000
This is a photographer's light-box application.

50
0:02:46.922,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Again, I can use both of my hands to interact and move photos around.

51
0:02:50.923,000 --> 0:02:53,000
But what's even cooler is that if I have two fingers,

52
0:02:54.502,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I can actually grab a photo and then stretch it out like that really easily.

53
0:02:58.656,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I can pan, zoom and rotate it effortlessly.

54
0:03:02.146,000 --> 0:03:04,000
I can do that grossly with both of my hands,

55
0:03:04.501,000 --> 0:03:07,000
or I can do it just with two fingers on each of my hands together.

56
0:03:07.729,000 --> 0:03:1,000
If I grab the canvas, I can do the same thing -- stretch it out.

57
0:03:10.78,000 --> 0:03:12,000
I can do it simultaneously, holding this down,

58
0:03:12.963,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and gripping on another one, stretching this out.

59
0:03:15.286,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Again, the interface just disappears here.

60
0:03:17.538,000 --> 0:03:18,000
There's no manual.

61
0:03:18.595,000 --> 0:03:2,000
This is exactly what you expect,

62
0:03:20.921,000 --> 0:03:23,000
especially if you haven't interacted with a computer before.

63
0:03:24,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Now, when you have initiatives like the $100 laptop,

64
0:03:26.728,000 --> 0:03:27,000
I kind of cringe at the idea

65
0:03:28.285,000 --> 0:03:3,000
of introducing a whole new generation to computing

66
0:03:30.886,000 --> 0:03:32,000
with this standard mouse-and-windows-pointer interface.

67
0:03:33.648,000 --> 0:03:36,000
This is something that I think is really the way

68
0:03:36.808,000 --> 0:03:38,000
we should be interacting with machines from now on.

69
0:03:39.473,000 --> 0:03:45,000
(Applause)

70
0:03:46,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Now, of course, I can bring up a keyboard.

71
0:03:48.024,000 --> 0:03:5,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:53,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And I can bring that around, put that up there.

73
0:03:56.213,000 --> 0:03:57,000
Obviously, this is a standard keyboard,

74
0:03:58.095,000 --> 0:04:01,000
but of course I can rescale it to make it work well for my hands.

75
0:04:01.201,000 --> 0:04:04,000
That's really important, because there's no reason in this day and age

76
0:04:04.558,000 --> 0:04:06,000
that we should be conforming to a physical device.

77
0:04:06.922,000 --> 0:04:07,000
That leads to bad things, like RSI.

78
0:04:08.693,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We have so much technology nowadays

79
0:04:11.494,000 --> 0:04:15,000
that these interfaces should start conforming to us.

80
0:04:15.547,000 --> 0:04:18,000
There's so little applied now to actually improving

81
0:04:19.548,000 --> 0:04:21,000
the way we interact with interfaces from this point on.

82
0:04:22.151,000 --> 0:04:25,000
This keyboard is probably actually the really wrong direction to go.

83
0:04:25.366,000 --> 0:04:28,000
You can imagine, in the future, as we develop this kind of technology,

84
0:04:28.692,000 --> 0:04:31,000
a keyboard that kind of automatically drifts as your hand moves away,

85
0:04:32.119,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and really intelligently anticipates which key you're trying to stroke.

86
0:04:36.477,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So -- again, isn't this great?

87
0:04:40.051,000 --> 0:04:41,000
(Laughter)

88
0:04:42.047,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Audience: Where's your lab?

89
0:04:43.834,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Jeff Han: I'm a research scientist at NYU in New York.

90
0:04:50.341,000 --> 0:04:53,000
Here's an example of another kind of app. I can make these little fuzz balls.

91
0:04:54,000 --> 0:04:56,000
It'll remember the strokes I'm making.

92
0:04:56.358,000 --> 0:04:57,000
Of course I can do it with all my hands.

93
0:04:58.301,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It's pressure-sensitive.

94
0:05:00.905,000 --> 0:05:01,000
What's neat about that is,

95
0:05:02.485,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I showed that two-finger gesture that zooms in really quickly.

96
0:05:05.474,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Because you don't have to switch to a hand tool

97
0:05:07.705,000 --> 0:05:08,000
or the magnifying glass tool,

98
0:05:09.135,000 --> 0:05:11,000
you can just continuously make things

99
0:05:11.698,000 --> 0:05:13,000
in real multiple scales, all at the same time.

100
0:05:14.076,000 --> 0:05:16,000
I can create big things out here,

101
0:05:16.113,000 --> 0:05:18,000
but I can go back and really quickly go back

102
0:05:18.235,000 --> 0:05:2,000
to where I started, and make even smaller things here.

103
0:05:22.271,000 --> 0:05:23,000
This is going to be really important

104
0:05:24.182,000 --> 0:05:27,000
as we start getting to things like data visualization.

105
0:05:27.239,000 --> 0:05:29,000
For instance, I think we all enjoyed Hans Rosling's talk,

106
0:05:29.93,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and he really emphasized the fact I've been thinking about for a long time:

107
0:05:33.48,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We have all this great data,

108
0:05:34.855,000 --> 0:05:36,000
but for some reason, it's just sitting there.

109
0:05:36.976,000 --> 0:05:37,000
We're not accessing it.

110
0:05:38.119,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And one of the reasons why I think that is

111
0:05:41.666,000 --> 0:05:45,000
will be helped by things like graphics and visualization and inference tools,

112
0:05:46.406,000 --> 0:05:47,000
but I also think a big part of it

113
0:05:48.291,000 --> 0:05:5,000
is going to be having better interfaces,

114
0:05:50.371,000 --> 0:05:52,000
to be able to drill down into this kind of data,

115
0:05:52.635,000 --> 0:05:54,000
while still thinking about the big picture here.

116
0:05:55.46,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Let me show you another app here. This is called WorldWind.

117
0:05:58.463,000 --> 0:05:59,000
It's done by NASA.

118
0:05:59.626,000 --> 0:06:01,000
We've all seen Google Earth;

119
0:06:02.48,000 --> 0:06:03,000
this is an open-source version of that.

120
0:06:04.462,000 --> 0:06:07,000
There are plug-ins to be able to load in different data sets

121
0:06:08.01,000 --> 0:06:09,000
that NASA's collected over the years.

122
0:06:09.833,000 --> 0:06:11,000
As you can see, I can use the same two-fingered gestures

123
0:06:12.477,000 --> 0:06:14,000
to go down and go in really seamlessly.

124
0:06:14.983,000 --> 0:06:15,000
There's no interface, again.

125
0:06:16.387,000 --> 0:06:19,000
It really allows anybody to kind of go in --

126
0:06:19.682,000 --> 0:06:21,000
and it just does what you'd expect, you know?

127
0:06:22.669,000 --> 0:06:25,000
Again, there's just no interface here. The interface just disappears.

128
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:29,000
I can switch to different data views.

129
0:06:29.9,000 --> 0:06:31,000
That's what's neat about this app here.

130
0:06:32.118,000 --> 0:06:33,000
NASA's really cool.

131
0:06:33.299,000 --> 0:06:35,000
These hyper-spectral images are false-colored so you can --

132
0:06:36.085,000 --> 0:06:39,000
it's really good for determining vegetative use.

133
0:06:40.887,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Well, let's go back to this.

134
0:06:45.312,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The great thing about mapping applications --

135
0:06:47.51,000 --> 0:06:48,000
it's not really 2D, it's 3D.

136
0:06:49.024,000 --> 0:06:52,000
So, again, with a multi-point interface, you can do a gesture like this --

137
0:06:52.54,000 --> 0:06:55,000
so you can be able to tilt around like that --

138
0:06:56.001,000 --> 0:06:57,000
(Surprised laughter)

139
0:06:57.899,000 --> 0:07:,000
It's not just simply relegated to a kind of 2D panning and motion.

140
0:07:01.105,000 --> 0:07:03,000
This gesture is just putting two fingers down --

141
0:07:03.764,000 --> 0:07:06,000
it's defining an axis of tilt -- and I can tilt up and down that way.

142
0:07:07.441,000 --> 0:07:09,000
We just came up with that on the spot,

143
0:07:09.543,000 --> 0:07:1,000
it's probably not the right thing to do,

144
0:07:11.504,000 --> 0:07:14,000
but there's such interesting things you can do with this interface.

145
0:07:16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It's just so much fun playing around with it, too.

146
0:07:18.958,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:20.335,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And so the last thing I want to show you is --

148
0:07:23,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I'm sure we can all think of a lot of entertainment apps

149
0:07:25.701,000 --> 0:07:26,000
that you can do with this thing.

150
0:07:27.249,000 --> 0:07:31,000
I'm more interested in the creative applications we can do with this.

151
0:07:31.323,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Now, here's a simple application here -- I can draw out a curve.

152
0:07:36.201,000 --> 0:07:39,000
And when I close it, it becomes a character.

153
0:07:39.785,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But the neat thing about it is I can add control points.

154
0:07:42.786,000 --> 0:07:45,000
And then what I can do is manipulate them with both of my fingers at the same time.

155
0:07:46.787,000 --> 0:07:47,000
And you notice what it does.

156
0:07:49.253,000 --> 0:07:51,000
It's kind of a puppeteering thing,

157
0:07:51.832,000 --> 0:07:56,000
where I can use as many fingers as I have to draw and make --

158
0:08:03.274,000 --> 0:08:05,000
Now, there's a lot of actual math going on under here

159
0:08:06,000 --> 0:08:1,000
for this to control this mesh and do the right thing.

160
0:08:11.183,000 --> 0:08:16,000
This technique of being able to manipulate a mesh here, with multiple control points,

161
0:08:16.899,000 --> 0:08:17,000
is actually state of the art.

162
0:08:18.399,000 --> 0:08:19,000
It was released at SIGGRAPH last year.

163
0:08:20.247,000 --> 0:08:22,000
It's a great example of the kind of research I really love:

164
0:08:23.041,000 --> 0:08:25,000
all this compute power to make things do the right things,

165
0:08:25.864,000 --> 0:08:27,000
intuitive things, to do exactly what you expect.

166
0:08:32,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So, multi-touch interaction research is a very active field right now in HCI.

167
0:08:37,000 --> 0:08:4,000
I'm not the only one doing it, a lot of other people are getting into it.

168
0:08:40.5,000 --> 0:08:43,000
This kind of technology is going to let even more people get into it,

169
0:08:43.769,000 --> 0:08:46,000
I'm looking forward to interacting with all of you over the next few days

170
0:08:47.285,000 --> 0:08:49,000
and seeing how it can apply to your respective fields.

171
0:08:49.846,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Thank you.

172
0:08:51.028,000 --> 0:08:53,000

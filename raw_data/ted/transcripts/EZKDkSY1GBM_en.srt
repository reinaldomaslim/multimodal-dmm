2
0:00:13.507,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Hi.

3
0:00:14.944,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My name's Sarah,

4
0:00:17.087,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and I've been priced out of the housing market.

5
0:00:21.809,000 --> 0:00:22,000
In fact,

6
0:00:24.395,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I'm one of the majority of my generation

7
0:00:27.991,000 --> 0:00:29,000
who can't afford a home.

8
0:00:31.228,000 --> 0:00:35,000
And in 2017, home ownership amongst young Australians

9
0:00:36.251,000 --> 0:00:4,000
has fallen to the lowest level in recorded history.

10
0:00:42.601,000 --> 0:00:45,000
So, foolishly or otherwise,

11
0:00:46.165,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I decided to build my own home.

12
0:00:49.585,000 --> 0:00:51,000
But the prognosis wasn't good there, either.

13
0:00:53.069,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Architects cater for the one percent,

14
0:00:56.227,000 --> 0:00:57,000
builders are scarce,

15
0:00:57.831,000 --> 0:01:,000
so service is inconsistent and prices are high.

16
0:01:02.325,000 --> 0:01:05,000
The single biggest investment in my life,

17
0:01:06.077,000 --> 0:01:09,000
and I was amazed how little self-determination,

18
0:01:10.704,000 --> 0:01:11,000
choice

19
0:01:12.442,000 --> 0:01:14,000
and, ultimately, control I had.

20
0:01:16.053,000 --> 0:01:21,000
What's more, I was doubly surprised at how vulnerable this made me feel.

21
0:01:22.56,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Frankly, I felt trapped.

22
0:01:27.923,000 --> 0:01:31,000
So, I reflected on this for quite some time.

23
0:01:33.031,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And I realized

24
0:01:34.618,000 --> 0:01:39,000
what I wanted was democratized design and construction.

25
0:01:41.975,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And that led to me asking one very simple question:

26
0:01:47.452,000 --> 0:01:49,000
What is building a house?

27
0:01:51.332,000 --> 0:01:52,000
What is it?

28
0:01:52.934,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Well, it turns out that building a house

29
0:01:57.133,000 --> 0:02:02,000
is making a series of decisions, some with physical consequences,

30
0:02:02.641,000 --> 0:02:05,000
within a defined set of parameters.

31
0:02:06.95,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Now, having worked in software applications for some time now,

32
0:02:10.752,000 --> 0:02:12,000
this all sounded very familiar to me.

33
0:02:13.696,000 --> 0:02:16,000
I also couldn't understand why we build on-site.

34
0:02:18.442,000 --> 0:02:22,000
No other major assembly in our lives is constructed like this.

35
0:02:23.944,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Your car doesn't come to you in pieces

36
0:02:26.714,000 --> 0:02:28,000
with an extra 10 percent just in case,

37
0:02:29.189,000 --> 0:02:32,000
to be assembled at the mercy of the elements.

38
0:02:32.849,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So why should your house?

39
0:02:36.46,000 --> 0:02:38,000
So I built a computer game.

40
0:02:40.532,000 --> 0:02:43,000
A game that allows you to design your home

41
0:02:43.984,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and have it delivered to you.

42
0:02:45.807,000 --> 0:02:48,000
A game that puts the home builder

43
0:02:49.474,000 --> 0:02:54,000
back at the center of the largest purchase in their life,

44
0:02:55.266,000 --> 0:02:59,000
elevating them from spectator to player.

45
0:03:00.927,000 --> 0:03:04,000
A game with full visibility of the costs and environmental impact

46
0:03:05.4,000 --> 0:03:07,000
of each new attribute you add.

47
0:03:08.466,000 --> 0:03:12,000
Using modular components, players select items from their library

48
0:03:13.061,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and drag them into their world.

49
0:03:16.053,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Each item, be it a wall, a solar battery or even an armchair,

50
0:03:22.246,000 --> 0:03:26,000
contains all of the information for the system to calculate costs,

51
0:03:26.743,000 --> 0:03:27,000
environmental impact

52
0:03:28.665,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and even a happiness tally for the player.

53
0:03:33.371,000 --> 0:03:37,000
Eighty-three percent of home builders said that next to cost,

54
0:03:37.502,000 --> 0:03:41,000
environmentally friendly features were the most important things to them.

55
0:03:42.553,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So out of the gate, homes are integrated with solar systems.

56
0:03:47.276,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Born green.

57
0:03:50.321,000 --> 0:03:54,000
Sustainable housing is often associated with wealth and affluence,

58
0:03:54.736,000 --> 0:03:55,000
but that shouldn't be the case.

59
0:03:56.72,000 --> 0:04:,000
In fact, truly sustainable housing should be available to everyone

60
0:04:01.253,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and affordable for all.

61
0:04:04.563,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So, I had found a way to get the control back that I was craving

62
0:04:12.029,000 --> 0:04:14,000
and give it to others.

63
0:04:15.173,000 --> 0:04:16,000
But something was still bugging me,

64
0:04:16.887,000 --> 0:04:18,000
something was still keeping me up at night.

65
0:04:21.038,000 --> 0:04:22,000
What about those people

66
0:04:23.783,000 --> 0:04:27,000
who have genuinely no control over where they live?

67
0:04:29.704,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Every hour -- in the space of your intermission --

68
0:04:33.872,000 --> 0:04:37,000
4,000 new homes are needed in the world.

69
0:04:38.506,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Wrap your head around that number.

70
0:04:41.585,000 --> 0:04:47,000
That's an astonishing 35 million homes globally, every year.

71
0:04:49.641,000 --> 0:04:5,000
And in Australia alone,

72
0:04:51.411,000 --> 0:04:55,000
we have a shortfall of 250,000 dwellings.

73
0:04:56.768,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And in addition to that,

74
0:04:59.958,000 --> 0:05:04,000
we have 190,000 families on the assisted-housing wait list;

75
0:05:06.481,000 --> 0:05:09,000
families in need of a home.

76
0:05:11.615,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Between now and 2050,

77
0:05:14.711,000 --> 0:05:2,000
when the global population is set to move from today's 7.6 billion

78
0:05:21.624,000 --> 0:05:26,000
to tomorrow's 9.8 billion people,

79
0:05:26.734,000 --> 0:05:29,000
hundreds of millions of people

80
0:05:30.02,000 --> 0:05:34,000
will experience security, health and safety issues.

81
0:05:37.127,000 --> 0:05:41,000
Imagine if you can not feeling secure in your home --

82
0:05:42.626,000 --> 0:05:44,000
not from crime, not from theft,

83
0:05:46.149,000 --> 0:05:48,000
but from the fact that the building you're in --

84
0:05:49.141,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the building you're in --

85
0:05:50.371,000 --> 0:05:51,000
might not be structurally sound

86
0:05:53.268,000 --> 0:05:55,000
or built from nontoxic components

87
0:05:55.895,000 --> 0:05:57,000
or meet local natural disaster standards.

88
0:06:00.926,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's the 21st century.

89
0:06:03.76,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And this just isn't good enough.

90
0:06:09.395,000 --> 0:06:11,000
What if -- what if --

91
0:06:13.167,000 --> 0:06:18,000
we could restore control and dignity to those individuals

92
0:06:18.72,000 --> 0:06:21,000
by giving them a home, but not just any home:

93
0:06:23.165,000 --> 0:06:24,000
their home,

94
0:06:24.823,000 --> 0:06:25,000
and a home of their design.

95
0:06:27.756,000 --> 0:06:31,000
We're currently adapting our game so that when a player builds a home,

96
0:06:31.879,000 --> 0:06:33,000
they're contributing to a home for someone in need.

97
0:06:35.791,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And I know this sounds like a lofty goal,

98
0:06:38.093,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and it is ridiculously ambitious,

99
0:06:40.839,000 --> 0:06:42,000
but today, our current operating model

100
0:06:43.641,000 --> 0:06:45,000
operates at a ten-to-one ratio.

101
0:06:46.691,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So for every 10 homes we build,

102
0:06:49.032,000 --> 0:06:52,000
we can build a home for someone in need.

103
0:06:52.701,000 --> 0:06:56,000
(Applause)

104
0:06:58.022,000 --> 0:07:01,000
This is made possible because today,

105
0:07:01.784,000 --> 0:07:03,000
with design for manufacture and assembly,

106
0:07:05.538,000 --> 0:07:09,000
which uses light gauge steel frame construction,

107
0:07:10.053,000 --> 0:07:12,000
shipped and assembled on-site,

108
0:07:12.474,000 --> 0:07:14,000
we can decrease construction costs by 20 percent

109
0:07:15.418,000 --> 0:07:18,000
and environmental waste by 15 percent,

110
0:07:18.496,000 --> 0:07:2,000
saving time, money

111
0:07:20.781,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and keeping tons of waste out of landfills.

112
0:07:24.586,000 --> 0:07:27,000
The power in modular construction

113
0:07:27.991,000 --> 0:07:31,000
is that you can build year-round with confidence in your costs,

114
0:07:33.902,000 --> 0:07:34,000
in your quality,

115
0:07:35.633,000 --> 0:07:37,000
and in your delivery date, in your build date.

116
0:07:38.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
Now, wouldn't that be crazy? Wouldn't that be great?

117
0:07:41.807,000 --> 0:07:42,000
But --

118
0:07:45.189,000 --> 0:07:47,000
that doesn't get me to my goal.

119
0:07:47.458,000 --> 0:07:5,000
My goal is one-for-one.

120
0:07:52.863,000 --> 0:07:54,000
So I've been traveling the world,

121
0:07:55.324,000 --> 0:07:58,000
looking at different alternatives of construction 3-D printing,

122
0:07:58.673,000 --> 0:08:01,000
trying to find technology that will help me deliver on my ambition.

123
0:08:02.919,000 --> 0:08:06,000
3-D printing is so exciting and so promising,

124
0:08:07.283,000 --> 0:08:11,000
offering a 40 percent reduction in cost and near zero waste.

125
0:08:12.546,000 --> 0:08:13,000
And this is just to name a few,

126
0:08:14.276,000 --> 0:08:17,000
but some of the really exciting innovations happening all over the world

127
0:08:17.772,000 --> 0:08:2,000
are happening in Italy, France, Dubai and Australia.

128
0:08:21.101,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And they use robotic arms to print everything from solid stone

129
0:08:25.477,000 --> 0:08:26,000
to concrete, to wax.

130
0:08:26.932,000 --> 0:08:29,000
In Italy, they have developed a technique using sorel cement.

131
0:08:31.182,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Sorel cement was originally invented in 1867,

132
0:08:36.085,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and it's the beautiful chemical marriage of magnesium oxide and local sand,

133
0:08:42.395,000 --> 0:08:45,000
which they can now use to print solid stone walls.

134
0:08:46.601,000 --> 0:08:47,000
And in France,

135
0:08:47.807,000 --> 0:08:5,000
they have a regulator-approved although still experimental process

136
0:08:51.386,000 --> 0:08:54,000
where they print two parallel tracks of foam insulation

137
0:08:54.974,000 --> 0:08:57,000
and pour concrete in the middle to create solid stone.

138
0:08:59.061,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And in Dubai, sitting at the foot of those two glorious Emirates Towers,

139
0:09:04.966,000 --> 0:09:06,000
is a vision of the future in the middle of the desert.

140
0:09:07.934,000 --> 0:09:1,000
They've got their experimental office of the future,

141
0:09:11.537,000 --> 0:09:14,000
which is constructed using 3-D printed concrete

142
0:09:14.942,000 --> 0:09:15,000
which was printed in China

143
0:09:16.316,000 --> 0:09:18,000
and shipped and assembled on location in Dubai.

144
0:09:19.53,000 --> 0:09:2,000
And not to be outdone,

145
0:09:20.83,000 --> 0:09:23,000
in Australia, we've pioneered an amazing technology

146
0:09:24.457,000 --> 0:09:26,000
that allows you to print wax molds

147
0:09:26.998,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and pour concrete over the top of them,

148
0:09:29.522,000 --> 0:09:34,000
allowing you to create really intricately beautiful and cost-effective facades

149
0:09:35.212,000 --> 0:09:36,000
that you can see in person

150
0:09:36.551,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the next time you travel the London Underground.

151
0:09:38.99,000 --> 0:09:41,000
But all of these things are tools --

152
0:09:42.488,000 --> 0:09:44,000
hammer of tomorrow, if you like.

153
0:09:44.813,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And the one common thread that connects all these things

154
0:09:47.869,000 --> 0:09:49,000
is computer-aided design.

155
0:09:50.305,000 --> 0:09:54,000
We will need models to build using these techniques,

156
0:09:55.434,000 --> 0:09:59,000
models like the ones being developed by players in our game.

157
0:10:02.545,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I want to put every person that wants one

158
0:10:06.595,000 --> 0:10:08,000
in a home of their own design.

159
0:10:09.761,000 --> 0:10:11,000
And there are many more applications still.

160
0:10:12.476,000 --> 0:10:16,000
We could usher in an entirely new empowered experience

161
0:10:17.237,000 --> 0:10:2,000
of special needs or aged-care accommodation.

162
0:10:20.737,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And we could provide rapid, on-site assistance

163
0:10:23.331,000 --> 0:10:25,000
in emergency housing situations.

164
0:10:26.371,000 --> 0:10:28,000
In the words of one of my players,

165
0:10:28.879,000 --> 0:10:3,000
"I want to take matters into my own hands

166
0:10:31.838,000 --> 0:10:33,000
and live by example."

167
0:10:35.371,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Thank you.

168
0:10:36.546,000 --> 0:10:39,000
(Applause)

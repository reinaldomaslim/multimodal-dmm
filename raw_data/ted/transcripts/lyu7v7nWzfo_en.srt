1
0:00:12.92,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Just over a year ago,

2
0:00:14.84,000 --> 0:00:16,000
for the third time in my life, I ceased to exist.

3
0:00:17.24,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I was having a small operation, and my brain was filling with anesthetic.

4
0:00:22.52,000 --> 0:00:25,000
I remember a sense of detachment and falling apart

5
0:00:25.88,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and a coldness.

6
0:00:27.88,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And then I was back, drowsy and disoriented,

7
0:00:30.32,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but definitely there.

8
0:00:32.28,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Now, when you wake from a deep sleep,

9
0:00:34.12,000 --> 0:00:37,000
you might feel confused about the time or anxious about oversleeping,

10
0:00:37.4,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but there's always a basic sense of time having passed,

11
0:00:40.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
of a continuity between then and now.

12
0:00:42.4,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Coming round from anesthesia is very different.

13
0:00:44.64,000 --> 0:00:46,000
I could have been under for five minutes, five hours,

14
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
five years or even 50 years.

15
0:00:48.6,000 --> 0:00:49,000
I simply wasn't there.

16
0:00:50.08,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It was total oblivion.

17
0:00:52.24,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Anesthesia -- it's a modern kind of magic.

18
0:00:54.32,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It turns people into objects,

19
0:00:57.52,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and then, we hope, back again into people.

20
0:00:59.544,000 --> 0:01:,000
And in this process

21
0:01:00.8,000 --> 0:01:03,000
is one of the greatest remaining mysteries in science and philosophy.

22
0:01:04.4,000 --> 0:01:05,000
How does consciousness happen?

23
0:01:06.04,000 --> 0:01:08,000
Somehow, within each of our brains,

24
0:01:08.28,000 --> 0:01:1,000
the combined activity of many billions of neurons,

25
0:01:11.2,000 --> 0:01:14,000
each one a tiny biological machine,

26
0:01:14.24,000 --> 0:01:15,000
is generating a conscious experience.

27
0:01:16.08,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And not just any conscious experience --

28
0:01:18.04,000 --> 0:01:2,000
your conscious experience right here and right now.

29
0:01:20.445,000 --> 0:01:21,000
How does this happen?

30
0:01:22.56,000 --> 0:01:24,000
Answering this question is so important

31
0:01:24.64,000 --> 0:01:26,000
because consciousness for each of us is all there is.

32
0:01:27.52,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Without it there's no world,

33
0:01:30.4,000 --> 0:01:31,000
there's no self,

34
0:01:31.8,000 --> 0:01:32,000
there's nothing at all.

35
0:01:33.36,000 --> 0:01:34,000
And when we suffer, we suffer consciously

36
0:01:35.337,000 --> 0:01:37,000
whether it's through mental illness or pain.

37
0:01:38.4,000 --> 0:01:4,000
And if we can experience joy and suffering,

38
0:01:41.36,000 --> 0:01:42,000
what about other animals?

39
0:01:43.32,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Might they be conscious, too?

40
0:01:44.76,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Do they also have a sense of self?

41
0:01:46.44,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And as computers get faster and smarter,

42
0:01:49.6,000 --> 0:01:51,000
maybe there will come a point, maybe not too far away,

43
0:01:52.2,000 --> 0:01:54,000
when my iPhone develops a sense of its own existence.

44
0:01:54.96,000 --> 0:01:58,000
I actually think the prospects for a conscious AI are pretty remote.

45
0:01:59.96,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I think this because my research is telling me

46
0:02:02.36,000 --> 0:02:04,000
that consciousness has less to do with pure intelligence

47
0:02:05.04,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and more to do with our nature as living and breathing organisms.

48
0:02:09.64,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Consciousness and intelligence are very different things.

49
0:02:12.36,000 --> 0:02:15,000
You don't have to be smart to suffer, but you probably do have to be alive.

50
0:02:17.2,000 --> 0:02:18,000
In the story I'm going to tell you,

51
0:02:18.92,000 --> 0:02:2,000
our conscious experiences of the world around us,

52
0:02:21.28,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and of ourselves within it,

53
0:02:22.639,000 --> 0:02:24,000
are kinds of controlled hallucinations

54
0:02:25.2,000 --> 0:02:28,000
that happen with, through and because of our living bodies.

55
0:02:29.84,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Now, you might have heard that we know nothing

56
0:02:33.2,000 --> 0:02:35,000
about how the brain and body give rise to consciousness.

57
0:02:35.96,000 --> 0:02:38,000
Some people even say it's beyond the reach of science altogether.

58
0:02:39.12,000 --> 0:02:4,000
But in fact,

59
0:02:40.36,000 --> 0:02:44,000
the last 25 years have seen an explosion of scientific work in this area.

60
0:02:44.52,000 --> 0:02:46,000
If you come to my lab at the University of Sussex,

61
0:02:47.32,000 --> 0:02:5,000
you'll find scientists from all different disciplines

62
0:02:51.2,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and sometimes even philosophers.

63
0:02:53.8,000 --> 0:02:56,000
All of us together trying to understand how consciousness happens

64
0:02:57.8,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and what happens when it goes wrong.

65
0:02:59.88,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And the strategy is very simple.

66
0:03:02.04,000 --> 0:03:03,000
I'd like you to think about consciousness

67
0:03:04.04,000 --> 0:03:06,000
in the way that we've come to think about life.

68
0:03:06.28,000 --> 0:03:08,000
At one time, people thought the property of being alive

69
0:03:08.92,000 --> 0:03:1,000
could not be explained by physics and chemistry --

70
0:03:11.56,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that life had to be more than just mechanism.

71
0:03:14.48,000 --> 0:03:15,000
But people no longer think that.

72
0:03:16.4,000 --> 0:03:17,000
As biologists got on with the job

73
0:03:18.04,000 --> 0:03:2,000
of explaining the properties of living systems

74
0:03:20.64,000 --> 0:03:21,000
in terms of physics and chemistry --

75
0:03:22.48,000 --> 0:03:25,000
things like metabolism, reproduction, homeostasis --

76
0:03:25.56,000 --> 0:03:28,000
the basic mystery of what life is started to fade away,

77
0:03:29.4,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and people didn't propose any more magical solutions,

78
0:03:32.48,000 --> 0:03:34,000
like a force of life or an élan vital.

79
0:03:35.08,000 --> 0:03:37,000
So as with life, so with consciousness.

80
0:03:37.76,000 --> 0:03:39,000
Once we start explaining its properties

81
0:03:40.08,000 --> 0:03:43,000
in terms of things happening inside brains and bodies,

82
0:03:43.8,000 --> 0:03:46,000
the apparently insoluble mystery of what consciousness is

83
0:03:47.24,000 --> 0:03:48,000
should start to fade away.

84
0:03:49,000 --> 0:03:5,000
At least that's the plan.

85
0:03:51.28,000 --> 0:03:52,000
So let's get started.

86
0:03:52.56,000 --> 0:03:53,000
What are the properties of consciousness?

87
0:03:54.56,000 --> 0:03:56,000
What should a science of consciousness try to explain?

88
0:03:57.96,000 --> 0:04:,000
Well, for today I'd just like to think of consciousness in two different ways.

89
0:04:01.68,000 --> 0:04:03,000
There are experiences of the world around us,

90
0:04:04.08,000 --> 0:04:06,000
full of sights, sounds and smells,

91
0:04:06.32,000 --> 0:04:09,000
there's multisensory, panoramic, 3D, fully immersive inner movie.

92
0:04:11,000 --> 0:04:12,000
And then there's conscious self.

93
0:04:13.08,000 --> 0:04:15,000
The specific experience of being you or being me.

94
0:04:15.56,000 --> 0:04:17,000
The lead character in this inner movie,

95
0:04:17.6,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and probably the aspect of consciousness we all cling to most tightly.

96
0:04:21.84,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Let's start with experiences of the world around us,

97
0:04:24.32,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and with the important idea of the brain as a prediction engine.

98
0:04:28.079,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Imagine being a brain.

99
0:04:30.6,000 --> 0:04:31,000
You're locked inside a bony skull,

100
0:04:32.279,000 --> 0:04:34,000
trying to figure what's out there in the world.

101
0:04:34.52,000 --> 0:04:37,000
There's no lights inside the skull. There's no sound either.

102
0:04:37.56,000 --> 0:04:39,000
All you've got to go on is streams of electrical impulses

103
0:04:40.36,000 --> 0:04:43,000
which are only indirectly related to things in the world,

104
0:04:43.56,000 --> 0:04:44,000
whatever they may be.

105
0:04:45.52,000 --> 0:04:47,000
So perception -- figuring out what's there --

106
0:04:47.68,000 --> 0:04:49,000
has to be a process of informed guesswork

107
0:04:50.56,000 --> 0:04:53,000
in which the brain combines these sensory signals

108
0:04:53.72,000 --> 0:04:57,000
with its prior expectations or beliefs about the way the world is

109
0:04:57.8,000 --> 0:05:,000
to form its best guess of what caused those signals.

110
0:05:00.96,000 --> 0:05:02,000
The brain doesn't hear sound or see light.

111
0:05:03.68,000 --> 0:05:07,000
What we perceive is its best guess of what's out there in the world.

112
0:05:09.04,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Let me give you a couple of examples of all this.

113
0:05:12.4,000 --> 0:05:13,000
You might have seen this illusion before,

114
0:05:14.4,000 --> 0:05:16,000
but I'd like you to think about it in a new way.

115
0:05:16.68,000 --> 0:05:18,000
If you look at those two patches, A and B,

116
0:05:18.76,000 --> 0:05:21,000
they should look to you to be very different shades of gray, right?

117
0:05:23.04,000 --> 0:05:25,000
But they are in fact exactly the same shade.

118
0:05:26.04,000 --> 0:05:27,000
And I can illustrate this.

119
0:05:27.4,000 --> 0:05:29,000
If I put up a second version of the image here

120
0:05:29.64,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and join the two patches with a gray-colored bar,

121
0:05:32.68,000 --> 0:05:33,000
you can see there's no difference.

122
0:05:34.36,000 --> 0:05:35,000
It's exactly the same shade of gray.

123
0:05:36.16,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And if you still don't believe me,

124
0:05:37.84,000 --> 0:05:39,000
I'll bring the bar across and join them up.

125
0:05:40.68,000 --> 0:05:43,000
It's a single colored block of gray, there's no difference at all.

126
0:05:44.76,000 --> 0:05:45,000
This isn't any kind of magic trick.

127
0:05:46.48,000 --> 0:05:47,000
It's the same shade of gray,

128
0:05:47.92,000 --> 0:05:49,000
but take it away again, and it looks different.

129
0:05:51.24,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So what's happening here

130
0:05:52.52,000 --> 0:05:54,000
is that the brain is using its prior expectations

131
0:05:55.36,000 --> 0:05:58,000
built deeply into the circuits of the visual cortex

132
0:05:58.48,000 --> 0:06:,000
that a cast shadow dims the appearance of a surface,

133
0:06:01.2,000 --> 0:06:04,000
so that we see B as lighter than it really is.

134
0:06:05.92,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Here's one more example,

135
0:06:07.2,000 --> 0:06:1,000
which shows just how quickly the brain can use new predictions

136
0:06:10.4,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to change what we consciously experience.

137
0:06:12.72,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Have a listen to this.

138
0:06:15.44,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Distorted voice)

139
0:06:19.32,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Sounded strange, right?

140
0:06:20.92,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Have a listen again and see if you can get anything.

141
0:06:23.76,000 --> 0:06:25,000
(Distorted voice)

142
0:06:27.88,000 --> 0:06:28,000
Still strange.

143
0:06:29.16,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Now listen to this.

144
0:06:30.92,000 --> 0:06:33,000
(Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit is a really terrible idea.

145
0:06:34,000 --> 0:06:35,000
(Laughter)

146
0:06:35.36,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Which I do.

147
0:06:36.6,000 --> 0:06:37,000
So you heard some words there, right?

148
0:06:38.44,000 --> 0:06:41,000
Now listen to the first sound again. I'm just going to replay it.

149
0:06:41.56,000 --> 0:06:44,000
(Distorted voice)

150
0:06:44.64,000 --> 0:06:46,000
Yeah? So you can now hear words there.

151
0:06:47.16,000 --> 0:06:48,000
Once more for luck.

152
0:06:49.04,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Distorted voice)

153
0:06:53,000 --> 0:06:55,000
OK, so what's going on here?

154
0:06:55.28,000 --> 0:06:58,000
The remarkable thing is the sensory information coming into the brain

155
0:06:58.88,000 --> 0:06:59,000
hasn't changed at all.

156
0:07:00.68,000 --> 0:07:02,000
All that's changed is your brain's best guess

157
0:07:03.24,000 --> 0:07:05,000
of the causes of that sensory information.

158
0:07:05.32,000 --> 0:07:07,000
And that changes what you consciously hear.

159
0:07:08.56,000 --> 0:07:11,000
All this puts the brain basis of perception

160
0:07:11.72,000 --> 0:07:12,000
in a bit of a different light.

161
0:07:13.2,000 --> 0:07:17,000
Instead of perception depending largely on signals coming into the brain

162
0:07:17.24,000 --> 0:07:18,000
from the outside world,

163
0:07:18.8,000 --> 0:07:2,000
it depends as much, if not more,

164
0:07:21.32,000 --> 0:07:24,000
on perceptual predictions flowing in the opposite direction.

165
0:07:26.16,000 --> 0:07:28,000
We don't just passively perceive the world,

166
0:07:28.24,000 --> 0:07:29,000
we actively generate it.

167
0:07:29.96,000 --> 0:07:31,000
The world we experience comes as much, if not more,

168
0:07:32.6,000 --> 0:07:33,000
from the inside out

169
0:07:33.96,000 --> 0:07:34,000
as from the outside in.

170
0:07:35.64,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Let me give you one more example of perception

171
0:07:37.84,000 --> 0:07:39,000
as this active, constructive process.

172
0:07:41.4,000 --> 0:07:46,000
Here we've combined immersive virtual reality with image processing

173
0:07:46.56,000 --> 0:07:48,000
to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions

174
0:07:49.56,000 --> 0:07:5,000
on experience.

175
0:07:50.92,000 --> 0:07:52,000
In this panoramic video, we've transformed the world --

176
0:07:53.84,000 --> 0:07:54,000
which is in this case Sussex campus --

177
0:07:55.76,000 --> 0:07:56,000
into a psychedelic playground.

178
0:07:57.76,000 --> 0:08:,000
We've processed the footage using an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream

179
0:08:01.64,000 --> 0:08:05,000
to simulate the effects of overly strong perceptual predictions.

180
0:08:05.76,000 --> 0:08:06,000
In this case, to see dogs.

181
0:08:07.4,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And you can see this is a very strange thing.

182
0:08:09.56,000 --> 0:08:11,000
When perceptual predictions are too strong,

183
0:08:11.68,000 --> 0:08:12,000
as they are here,

184
0:08:13.08,000 --> 0:08:15,000
the result looks very much like the kinds of hallucinations

185
0:08:16,000 --> 0:08:18,000
people might report in altered states,

186
0:08:18.04,000 --> 0:08:2,000
or perhaps even in psychosis.

187
0:08:21.12,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Now, think about this for a minute.

188
0:08:23.16,000 --> 0:08:28,000
If hallucination is a kind of uncontrolled perception,

189
0:08:28.28,000 --> 0:08:32,000
then perception right here and right now is also a kind of hallucination,

190
0:08:32.76,000 --> 0:08:34,000
but a controlled hallucination

191
0:08:34.8,000 --> 0:08:36,000
in which the brain's predictions are being reined in

192
0:08:37.72,000 --> 0:08:38,000
by sensory information from the world.

193
0:08:40.2,000 --> 0:08:42,000
In fact, we're all hallucinating all the time,

194
0:08:43.2,000 --> 0:08:44,000
including right now.

195
0:08:44.6,000 --> 0:08:46,000
It's just that when we agree about our hallucinations,

196
0:08:47.44,000 --> 0:08:48,000
we call that reality.

197
0:08:49.28,000 --> 0:08:52,000
(Laughter)

198
0:08:53.24,000 --> 0:08:56,000
Now I'm going to tell you that your experience of being a self,

199
0:08:56.6,000 --> 0:08:57,000
the specific experience of being you,

200
0:08:58.44,000 --> 0:09:01,000
is also a controlled hallucination generated by the brain.

201
0:09:01.96,000 --> 0:09:03,000
This seems a very strange idea, right?

202
0:09:04,000 --> 0:09:06,000
Yes, visual illusions might deceive my eyes,

203
0:09:06.16,000 --> 0:09:09,000
but how could I be deceived about what it means to be me?

204
0:09:10.2,000 --> 0:09:11,000
For most of us,

205
0:09:11.44,000 --> 0:09:12,000
the experience of being a person

206
0:09:13.04,000 --> 0:09:15,000
is so familiar, so unified and so continuous

207
0:09:15.16,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that it's difficult not to take it for granted.

208
0:09:17.4,000 --> 0:09:18,000
But we shouldn't take it for granted.

209
0:09:19.24,000 --> 0:09:22,000
There are in fact many different ways we experience being a self.

210
0:09:22.48,000 --> 0:09:24,000
There's the experience of having a body

211
0:09:24.6,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and of being a body.

212
0:09:26.08,000 --> 0:09:28,000
There are experiences of perceiving the world

213
0:09:28.24,000 --> 0:09:29,000
from a first person point of view.

214
0:09:30.24,000 --> 0:09:32,000
There are experiences of intending to do things

215
0:09:32.48,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and of being the cause of things that happen in the world.

216
0:09:35.64,000 --> 0:09:36,000
And there are experiences

217
0:09:36.92,000 --> 0:09:39,000
of being a continuous and distinctive person over time,

218
0:09:40.84,000 --> 0:09:42,000
built from a rich set of memories and social interactions.

219
0:09:44.2,000 --> 0:09:45,000
Many experiments show,

220
0:09:45.52,000 --> 0:09:47,000
and psychiatrists and neurologists know very well,

221
0:09:47.88,000 --> 0:09:49,000
that these different ways in which we experience being a self

222
0:09:50.8,000 --> 0:09:51,000
can all come apart.

223
0:09:52.52,000 --> 0:09:54,000
What this means is the basic background experience

224
0:09:55.44,000 --> 0:09:59,000
of being a unified self is a rather fragile construction of the brain.

225
0:10:00.04,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Another experience, which just like all others,

226
0:10:02.72,000 --> 0:10:03,000
requires explanation.

227
0:10:04.72,000 --> 0:10:05,000
So let's return to the bodily self.

228
0:10:06.52,000 --> 0:10:08,000
How does the brain generate the experience of being a body

229
0:10:09.28,000 --> 0:10:1,000
and of having a body?

230
0:10:10.56,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Well, just the same principles apply.

231
0:10:12.44,000 --> 0:10:13,000
The brain makes its best guess

232
0:10:13.92,000 --> 0:10:15,000
about what is and what is not part of its body.

233
0:10:16.88,000 --> 0:10:19,000
And there's a beautiful experiment in neuroscience to illustrate this.

234
0:10:20.64,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And unlike most neuroscience experiments,

235
0:10:22.64,000 --> 0:10:23,000
this is one you can do at home.

236
0:10:24.16,000 --> 0:10:25,000
All you need is one of these.

237
0:10:26.08,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

238
0:10:27.36,000 --> 0:10:28,000
And a couple of paintbrushes.

239
0:10:30.88,000 --> 0:10:31,000
In the rubber hand illusion,

240
0:10:32.28,000 --> 0:10:33,000
a person's real hand is hidden from view,

241
0:10:34.28,000 --> 0:10:36,000
and that fake rubber hand is placed in front of them.

242
0:10:36.92,000 --> 0:10:39,000
Then both hands are simultaneously stroked with a paintbrush

243
0:10:40.2,000 --> 0:10:42,000
while the person stares at the fake hand.

244
0:10:43.32,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Now, for most people, after a while,

245
0:10:45.32,000 --> 0:10:47,000
this leads to the very uncanny sensation

246
0:10:47.44,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that the fake hand is in fact part of their body.

247
0:10:51.64,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And the idea is that the congruence between seeing touch and feeling touch

248
0:10:55.84,000 --> 0:10:59,000
on an object that looks like hand and is roughly where a hand should be,

249
0:11:00.24,000 --> 0:11:02,000
is enough evidence for the brain to make its best guess

250
0:11:03.04,000 --> 0:11:06,000
that the fake hand is in fact part of the body.

251
0:11:06.28,000 --> 0:11:08,000
(Laughter)

252
0:11:15.24,000 --> 0:11:17,000
So you can measure all kinds of clever things.

253
0:11:17.52,000 --> 0:11:2,000
You can measure skin conductance and startle responses,

254
0:11:20.84,000 --> 0:11:21,000
but there's no need.

255
0:11:22.12,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It's clear the guy in blue has assimilated the fake hand.

256
0:11:25.08,000 --> 0:11:28,000
This means that even experiences of what our body is

257
0:11:28.52,000 --> 0:11:29,000
is a kind of best guessing --

258
0:11:30.08,000 --> 0:11:32,000
a kind of controlled hallucination by the brain.

259
0:11:33.48,000 --> 0:11:34,000
There's one more thing.

260
0:11:36.12,000 --> 0:11:39,000
We don't just experience our bodies as objects in the world from the outside,

261
0:11:39.8,000 --> 0:11:4,000
we also experience them from within.

262
0:11:41.56,000 --> 0:11:45,000
We all experience the sense of being a body from the inside.

263
0:11:47,000 --> 0:11:49,000
And sensory signals coming from the inside of the body

264
0:11:49.6,000 --> 0:11:53,000
are continually telling the brain about the state of the internal organs,

265
0:11:53.68,000 --> 0:11:55,000
how the heart is doing, what the blood pressure is like,

266
0:11:56.36,000 --> 0:11:57,000
lots of things.

267
0:11:57.6,000 --> 0:11:59,000
This kind of perception, which we call interoception,

268
0:12:00.84,000 --> 0:12:01,000
is rather overlooked.

269
0:12:02.12,000 --> 0:12:03,000
But it's critically important

270
0:12:03.56,000 --> 0:12:06,000
because perception and regulation of the internal state of the body --

271
0:12:06.92,000 --> 0:12:07,000
well, that's what keeps us alive.

272
0:12:09.4,000 --> 0:12:11,000
Here's another version of the rubber hand illusion.

273
0:12:11.84,000 --> 0:12:12,000
This is from our lab at Sussex.

274
0:12:13.36,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And here, people see a virtual reality version of their hand,

275
0:12:16.8,000 --> 0:12:17,000
which flashes red and back

276
0:12:18.2,000 --> 0:12:21,000
either in time or out of time with their heartbeat.

277
0:12:21.48,000 --> 0:12:23,000
And when it's flashing in time with their heartbeat,

278
0:12:23.96,000 --> 0:12:26,000
people have a stronger sense that it's in fact part of their body.

279
0:12:27.72,000 --> 0:12:3,000
So experiences of having a body are deeply grounded

280
0:12:31.24,000 --> 0:12:33,000
in perceiving our bodies from within.

281
0:12:35.68,000 --> 0:12:37,000
There's one last thing I want to draw your attention to,

282
0:12:38.36,000 --> 0:12:41,000
which is that experiences of the body from the inside are very different

283
0:12:42.04,000 --> 0:12:44,000
from experiences of the world around us.

284
0:12:44.12,000 --> 0:12:46,000
When I look around me, the world seems full of objects --

285
0:12:46.84,000 --> 0:12:48,000
tables, chairs, rubber hands,

286
0:12:49.04,000 --> 0:12:5,000
people, you lot --

287
0:12:50.8,000 --> 0:12:51,000
even my own body in the world,

288
0:12:52.8,000 --> 0:12:54,000
I can perceive it as an object from the outside.

289
0:12:55.08,000 --> 0:12:57,000
But my experiences of the body from within,

290
0:12:57.16,000 --> 0:12:58,000
they're not like that at all.

291
0:12:58.6,000 --> 0:13:,000
I don't perceive my kidneys here,

292
0:13:00.68,000 --> 0:13:01,000
my liver here,

293
0:13:02.28,000 --> 0:13:03,000
my spleen ...

294
0:13:03.56,000 --> 0:13:04,000
I don't know where my spleen is,

295
0:13:05.48,000 --> 0:13:06,000
but it's somewhere.

296
0:13:06.88,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I don't perceive my insides as objects.

297
0:13:08.8,000 --> 0:13:11,000
In fact, I don't experience them much at all unless they go wrong.

298
0:13:13.4,000 --> 0:13:14,000
And this is important, I think.

299
0:13:15.6,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Perception of the internal state of the body

300
0:13:17.72,000 --> 0:13:18,000
isn't about figuring out what's there,

301
0:13:19.6,000 --> 0:13:21,000
it's about control and regulation --

302
0:13:21.76,000 --> 0:13:24,000
keeping the physiological variables within the tight bounds

303
0:13:25.68,000 --> 0:13:26,000
that are compatible with survival.

304
0:13:28.64,000 --> 0:13:3,000
When the brain uses predictions to figure out what's there,

305
0:13:31.52,000 --> 0:13:34,000
we perceive objects as the causes of sensations.

306
0:13:34.64,000 --> 0:13:37,000
When the brain uses predictions to control and regulate things,

307
0:13:38.28,000 --> 0:13:41,000
we experience how well or how badly that control is going.

308
0:13:41.88,000 --> 0:13:43,000
So our most basic experiences of being a self,

309
0:13:44.72,000 --> 0:13:46,000
of being an embodied organism,

310
0:13:46.8,000 --> 0:13:49,000
are deeply grounded in the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.

311
0:13:52.76,000 --> 0:13:54,000
And when we follow this idea all the way through,

312
0:13:55.12,000 --> 0:13:58,000
we can start to see that all of our conscious experiences,

313
0:13:58.84,000 --> 0:14:02,000
since they all depend on the same mechanisms of predictive perception,

314
0:14:03.6,000 --> 0:14:06,000
all stem from this basic drive to stay alive.

315
0:14:07.04,000 --> 0:14:09,000
We experience the world and ourselves

316
0:14:09.68,000 --> 0:14:12,000
with, through and because of our living bodies.

317
0:14:13.56,000 --> 0:14:15,000
Let me bring things together step-by-step.

318
0:14:16.56,000 --> 0:14:17,000
What we consciously see depends

319
0:14:18.16,000 --> 0:14:2,000
on the brain's best guess of what's out there.

320
0:14:20.48,000 --> 0:14:22,000
Our experienced world comes from the inside out,

321
0:14:22.88,000 --> 0:14:23,000
not just the outside in.

322
0:14:24.6,000 --> 0:14:27,000
The rubber hand illusion shows that this applies to our experiences

323
0:14:27.88,000 --> 0:14:28,000
of what is and what is not our body.

324
0:14:30.56,000 --> 0:14:33,000
And these self-related predictions depend critically on sensory signals

325
0:14:34.16,000 --> 0:14:35,000
coming from deep inside the body.

326
0:14:36.4,000 --> 0:14:37,000
And finally,

327
0:14:37.64,000 --> 0:14:41,000
experiences of being an embodied self are more about control and regulation

328
0:14:42.04,000 --> 0:14:43,000
than figuring out what's there.

329
0:14:44.84,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So our experiences of the world around us and ourselves within it --

330
0:14:48.08,000 --> 0:14:5,000
well, they're kinds of controlled hallucinations

331
0:14:50.36,000 --> 0:14:52,000
that have been shaped over millions of years of evolution

332
0:14:53.28,000 --> 0:14:55,000
to keep us alive in worlds full of danger and opportunity.

333
0:14:56.48,000 --> 0:14:58,000
We predict ourselves into existence.

334
0:15:00.52,000 --> 0:15:02,000
Now, I leave you with three implications of all this.

335
0:15:03.64,000 --> 0:15:05,000
First, just as we can misperceive the world,

336
0:15:05.88,000 --> 0:15:06,000
we can misperceive ourselves

337
0:15:07.68,000 --> 0:15:09,000
when the mechanisms of prediction go wrong.

338
0:15:09.84,000 --> 0:15:13,000
Understanding this opens many new opportunities in psychiatry and neurology,

339
0:15:14.08,000 --> 0:15:16,000
because we can finally get at the mechanisms

340
0:15:16.72,000 --> 0:15:17,000
rather than just treating the symptoms

341
0:15:18.64,000 --> 0:15:2,000
in conditions like depression and schizophrenia.

342
0:15:21.72,000 --> 0:15:22,000
Second:

343
0:15:22.96,000 --> 0:15:25,000
what it means to be me cannot be reduced to or uploaded to

344
0:15:26.8,000 --> 0:15:28,000
a software program running on a robot,

345
0:15:29.2,000 --> 0:15:31,000
however smart or sophisticated.

346
0:15:31.44,000 --> 0:15:33,000
We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals

347
0:15:34.08,000 --> 0:15:37,000
whose conscious experiences are shaped at all levels

348
0:15:37.36,000 --> 0:15:39,000
by the biological mechanisms that keep us alive.

349
0:15:40.36,000 --> 0:15:43,000
Just making computers smarter is not going to make them sentient.

350
0:15:45,000 --> 0:15:46,000
Finally,

351
0:15:46.32,000 --> 0:15:47,000
our own individual inner universe,

352
0:15:48.32,000 --> 0:15:49,000
our way of being conscious,

353
0:15:5,000 --> 0:15:52,000
is just one possible way of being conscious.

354
0:15:53.84,000 --> 0:15:54,000
And even human consciousness generally --

355
0:15:55.84,000 --> 0:15:58,000
it's just a tiny region in a vast space of possible consciousnesses.

356
0:15:59.84,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Our individual self and worlds are unique to each of us,

357
0:16:03.52,000 --> 0:16:06,000
but they're all grounded in biological mechanisms

358
0:16:06.76,000 --> 0:16:08,000
shared with many other living creatures.

359
0:16:09.92,000 --> 0:16:11,000
Now, these are fundamental changes

360
0:16:13.76,000 --> 0:16:15,000
in how we understand ourselves,

361
0:16:16.04,000 --> 0:16:17,000
but I think they should be celebrated,

362
0:16:17.92,000 --> 0:16:19,000
because as so often in science, from Copernicus --

363
0:16:20.32,000 --> 0:16:22,000
we're not at the center of the universe --

364
0:16:22.344,000 --> 0:16:23,000
to Darwin --

365
0:16:23.6,000 --> 0:16:25,000
we're related to all other creatures --

366
0:16:25.84,000 --> 0:16:26,000
to the present day.

367
0:16:28.32,000 --> 0:16:3,000
With a greater sense of understanding

368
0:16:31.08,000 --> 0:16:33,000
comes a greater sense of wonder,

369
0:16:33.52,000 --> 0:16:34,000
and a greater realization

370
0:16:35.4,000 --> 0:16:39,000
that we are part of and not apart from the rest of nature.

371
0:16:40.92,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And ...

372
0:16:42.72,000 --> 0:16:44,000
when the end of consciousness comes,

373
0:16:45.12,000 --> 0:16:47,000
there's nothing to be afraid of.

374
0:16:48.56,000 --> 0:16:49,000
Nothing at all.

375
0:16:50.48,000 --> 0:16:51,000
Thank you.

376
0:16:51.72,000 --> 0:16:59,000

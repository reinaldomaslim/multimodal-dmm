1
0:00:17.144,000 --> 0:00:19,000
The "Dirty Jobs" crew and I were called

2
0:00:19.248,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to a little town in Colorado, called Craig.

3
0:00:22.042,000 --> 0:00:23,000
It's only a couple dozen square miles.

4
0:00:23.883,000 --> 0:00:24,000
It's in the Rockies.

5
0:00:25.145,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And the job in question was sheep rancher.

6
0:00:27.713,000 --> 0:00:3,000
My role on the show, for those of you who haven't seen it -- it's pretty simple.

7
0:00:31.52,000 --> 0:00:32,000
I'm an apprentice,

8
0:00:32.73,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and I work with the people who do the jobs in question.

9
0:00:35.478,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And my responsibilities are to simply try and keep up,

10
0:00:38.478,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and give an honest account of what it's like to be these people

11
0:00:41.7,000 --> 0:00:42,000
for one day in their life.

12
0:00:43.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
The job in question: herding sheep.

13
0:00:45.758,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Great.

14
0:00:46.935,000 --> 0:00:49,000
We go to Craig and we check into a hotel,

15
0:00:50.27,000 --> 0:00:52,000
and I realize the next day

16
0:00:52.41,000 --> 0:00:56,000
that castration is going to be an absolute part of this work.

17
0:00:56.524,000 --> 0:00:58,000
Normally, I never do any research at all.

18
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But this is a touchy subject, and I work for the Discovery Channel,

19
0:01:02.671,000 --> 0:01:06,000
and we want to portray accurately whatever it is we do.

20
0:01:07.302,000 --> 0:01:11,000
And we certainly want to do it with a lot of respect for the animals.

21
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
So I call the Humane Society and I say,

22
0:01:14.248,000 --> 0:01:17,000
"Look, I'm going to be castrating some lambs. Can you tell me the deal?"

23
0:01:17.686,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And they're like, "Yeah, it's pretty straightforward."

24
0:01:20.247,000 --> 0:01:26,000
They use a band, basically, a rubber band, like this, only a little smaller.

25
0:01:26.312,000 --> 0:01:28,000
This one was actually around the playing cards

26
0:01:28.533,000 --> 0:01:29,000
I got yesterday --

27
0:01:29.74,000 --> 0:01:3,000
(Laughter)

28
0:01:31.286,000 --> 0:01:32,000
But it had a certain familiarity to it.

29
0:01:33.201,000 --> 0:01:36,000
And I said, "Well, what exactly is the process?"

30
0:01:36.407,000 --> 0:01:38,000
And they said, "The band is applied to the tail, tightly.

31
0:01:39.276,000 --> 0:01:42,000
And then another band is applied to the scrotum, tightly.

32
0:01:43.66,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Blood flow is slowly retarded;

33
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
a week later the parts in question fall off.

34
0:01:47.28,000 --> 0:01:48,000
"Great -- got it."

35
0:01:48.456,000 --> 0:01:5,000
OK, I call the SPCA to confirm this.

36
0:01:51.063,000 --> 0:01:52,000
They confirm it.

37
0:01:52.254,000 --> 0:01:53,000
I also call PETA just for fun,

38
0:01:53.744,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and they don't like it, but they confirm it.

39
0:01:55.914,000 --> 0:01:56,000
OK, that's basically how you do it.

40
0:01:57.625,000 --> 0:01:58,000
So the next day I go out.

41
0:01:59.037,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I'm given a horse and we go get the lambs

42
0:02:01.406,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and we take them to a pen that we built,

43
0:02:03.466,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and we go about the business of animal husbandry.

44
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Melanie is the wife of Albert.

45
0:02:08.629,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Albert is the shepherd in question.

46
0:02:10.35,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Melanie picks up the lamb, one hand on both legs on the right,

47
0:02:14.457,000 --> 0:02:15,000
likewise on the left.

48
0:02:15.894,000 --> 0:02:17,000
Lamb goes on the post, she opens it up.

49
0:02:18.097,000 --> 0:02:19,000
Alright. Great.

50
0:02:19.295,000 --> 0:02:21,000
Albert goes in, I follow Albert, the crew is around.

51
0:02:21.966,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I always watch the process done the first time before I try it.

52
0:02:25.465,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Being an apprentice, you know, you do that.

53
0:02:27.776,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Albert reaches in his pocket to pull out, you know, this black rubber band,

54
0:02:31.378,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but what comes out instead is a knife.

55
0:02:34.572,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And I'm like, "Hmm, that's not rubber at all," you know?

56
0:02:37.237,000 --> 0:02:38,000
(Laughter)

57
0:02:38.45,000 --> 0:02:4,000
And he kind of flicked it open in a way that caught the sun

58
0:02:41.268,000 --> 0:02:43,000
that was just coming over the Rockies, it was very --

59
0:02:43.83,000 --> 0:02:44,000
(Laughter)

60
0:02:45.37,000 --> 0:02:47,000
It was ... it was impressive.

61
0:02:48.149,000 --> 0:02:49,000
In the space of about two seconds,

62
0:02:49.99,000 --> 0:02:52,000
Albert had the knife between the cartilage of the tail,

63
0:02:53.795,000 --> 0:02:55,000
right next to the butt of the lamb,

64
0:02:56.466,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and very quickly, the tail was gone and in the bucket that I was holding.

65
0:03:00.026,000 --> 0:03:03,000
A second later, with a big thumb and a well-calloused forefinger,

66
0:03:03.619,000 --> 0:03:05,000
he had the scrotum firmly in his grasp.

67
0:03:06.546,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And he pulled it toward him, like so,

68
0:03:08.395,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and he took the knife and he put it on the tip.

69
0:03:10.633,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"Now, you think you know what's coming, Michael,

70
0:03:13.267,000 --> 0:03:14,000
You don't, OK?"

71
0:03:14.553,000 --> 0:03:15,000
(Laughter)

72
0:03:15.597,000 --> 0:03:17,000
He snips it, throws the tip over his shoulder,

73
0:03:18.506,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and then grabs the scrotum and pushes it upward,

74
0:03:20.846,000 --> 0:03:23,000
and then his head dips down, obscuring my view.

75
0:03:24.769,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But what I hear is a slurping sound,

76
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and a noise that sounds like Velcro being yanked off a sticky wall,

77
0:03:30.937,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and I am not even kidding.

78
0:03:33.884,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Can we roll the video?

79
0:03:35.061,000 --> 0:03:36,000
No, I'm kidding, we don't --

80
0:03:36.427,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

81
0:03:38.447,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I thought it best to talk in pictures.

82
0:03:41.426,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I do something now I've never, ever done on a "Dirty Jobs" shoot, ever.

83
0:03:45.455,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I say, "Time out. Stop."

84
0:03:47.777,000 --> 0:03:49,000
You guys know the show, we use take one; we don't do take two.

85
0:03:50.729,000 --> 0:03:52,000
There's no writing, there's no scripting, there's no nonsense.

86
0:03:53.671,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We don't fool around, we don't rehearse --

87
0:03:55.848,000 --> 0:03:56,000
we shoot what we get!

88
0:03:57.27,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I said, "Stop. This is nuts."

89
0:03:59.415,000 --> 0:04:,000
I mean --

90
0:04:00.593,000 --> 0:04:01,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:01.902,000 --> 0:04:02,000
"This is crazy.

92
0:04:03.75,000 --> 0:04:04,000
We can't do this."

93
0:04:05.403,000 --> 0:04:06,000
And Albert's like, "What?"

94
0:04:06.675,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And I'm like, "I don't know what just happened,

95
0:04:08.896,000 --> 0:04:09,000
but there are testicles in this bucket,

96
0:04:10.852,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and that's not how we do it."

97
0:04:12.292,000 --> 0:04:13,000
He said "Well, that's how we do it."

98
0:04:14.074,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I said, "Why would you do it this way?"

99
0:04:16.041,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And before I even let him explain,

100
0:04:17.732,000 --> 0:04:19,000
I said, "I want to do it the right way, with the rubber bands."

101
0:04:20.737,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And he says, "Like the Humane Society?"

102
0:04:22.655,000 --> 0:04:23,000
I said, "Yes, like the Humane Society.

103
0:04:24.517,000 --> 0:04:27,000
Let's do something that doesn't make the lamb squeal and bleed.

104
0:04:28.126,000 --> 0:04:29,000
We're on in five continents, dude!

105
0:04:29.776,000 --> 0:04:31,000
We're on twice a day on the Discovery -- we can't do this."

106
0:04:32.584,000 --> 0:04:33,000
He says, "OK."

107
0:04:33.787,000 --> 0:04:36,000
He goes to his box and pulls out a bag of these little rubber bands.

108
0:04:37.064,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Melanie picks up another lamb, puts it on the post,

109
0:04:39.596,000 --> 0:04:41,000
band goes on the tail, band goes on the scrotum.

110
0:04:42.338,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Lamb goes on the ground, lamb takes two steps, falls down,

111
0:04:46.134,000 --> 0:04:48,000
gets up, shakes a little,

112
0:04:48.633,000 --> 0:04:49,000
takes another couple steps, falls down.

113
0:04:51.024,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I'm like, this is not a good sign for this lamb, at all.

114
0:04:55.007,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Gets up, walks to the corner.

115
0:04:56.704,000 --> 0:04:59,000
It's quivering, and it lies down and it's in obvious distress.

116
0:05:00.317,000 --> 0:05:03,000
And I'm looking at the lamb and I say, "Albert, how long?

117
0:05:04.16,000 --> 0:05:05,000
When does he get up?"

118
0:05:05.909,000 --> 0:05:06,000
He's like, "A day?"

119
0:05:07.747,000 --> 0:05:09,000
I said, "A day! How long does it take them to fall off?"

120
0:05:10.409,000 --> 0:05:11,000
"A week."

121
0:05:11.608,000 --> 0:05:16,000
Meanwhile, the lamb that he had just done his little procedure on

122
0:05:16.99,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is, you know, he's just prancing around, bleeding stopped.

123
0:05:21.084,000 --> 0:05:23,000
He's, you know, nibbling on some grass, frolicking.

124
0:05:24.372,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And I was just so blown away at how completely wrong I was,

125
0:05:29.386,000 --> 0:05:3,000
in that second.

126
0:05:31.025,000 --> 0:05:35,000
And I was reminded how utterly wrong I am, so much of the time.

127
0:05:35.144,000 --> 0:05:36,000
(Laughter)

128
0:05:36.264,000 --> 0:05:37,000
And I was especially reminded

129
0:05:38.08,000 --> 0:05:41,000
of what a ridiculously short straw I had that day,

130
0:05:41.376,000 --> 0:05:43,000
because now I had to do what Albert had just done,

131
0:05:43.867,000 --> 0:05:45,000
and there are like 100 of these lambs in the pen.

132
0:05:47.263,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And suddenly, this whole thing's starting to feel like a German porno,

133
0:05:50.737,000 --> 0:05:51,000
and I'm like --

134
0:05:52.076,000 --> 0:05:54,000
(Laughter)

135
0:05:54.653,000 --> 0:05:57,000
Melanie picks up the lamb, puts it on the post, opens it up.

136
0:05:58.234,000 --> 0:05:59,000
Albert hands me the knife.

137
0:05:59.525,000 --> 0:06:,000
I go in, tail comes off.

138
0:06:01.248,000 --> 0:06:04,000
I go in, I grab the scrotum, tip comes off.

139
0:06:04.378,000 --> 0:06:06,000
Albert instructs, "Push it way up there."

140
0:06:06.748,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I do.

141
0:06:07.923,000 --> 0:06:08,000
"Push it further."

142
0:06:09.098,000 --> 0:06:1,000
I do.

143
0:06:10.273,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The testicles emerge. They look like thumbs, coming right at you.

144
0:06:13.572,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And he says, "Bite 'em.

145
0:06:15.215,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Just bite 'em off."

146
0:06:17.219,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Laughter)

147
0:06:18.369,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And I heard him, I heard all the words --

148
0:06:20.482,000 --> 0:06:24,000
(Laughter)

149
0:06:25.094,000 --> 0:06:26,000
Like, how did I get here?

150
0:06:26.737,000 --> 0:06:27,000
How did -- I mean --

151
0:06:28.643,000 --> 0:06:29,000
how did I get here?

152
0:06:30.643,000 --> 0:06:35,000
It's just -- it's one of those moments where the brain goes off on its own,

153
0:06:36.012,000 --> 0:06:39,000
and suddenly, I'm standing there in the Rockies,

154
0:06:39.16,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and all I can think of is the Aristotelian definition of a tragedy.

155
0:06:43.57,000 --> 0:06:47,000
You know, Aristotle says a tragedy is that moment

156
0:06:47.695,000 --> 0:06:5,000
when the hero comes face to face with his true identity.

157
0:06:51.275,000 --> 0:06:52,000
(Laughter)

158
0:06:52.644,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And I'm like, "What is this jacked-up metaphor?

159
0:06:54.95,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I don't like what I'm thinking right now."

160
0:06:57.022,000 --> 0:06:59,000
And I can't get this thought out of my head,

161
0:06:59.139,000 --> 0:07:01,000
and I can't get that vision out of my sight,

162
0:07:01.271,000 --> 0:07:03,000
so I did what I had to do.

163
0:07:03.624,000 --> 0:07:05,000
I went in and I took them.

164
0:07:05.649,000 --> 0:07:06,000
I took them like this,

165
0:07:07.034,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and I yanked my head back.

166
0:07:09.852,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And I'm standing there with two testicles on my chin.

167
0:07:13.673,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:15.618,000 --> 0:07:18,000
And now I can't get -- I can't shake the metaphor.

169
0:07:18.794,000 --> 0:07:21,000
I'm still in "Poetics," in Aristotle, and I'm thinking --

170
0:07:22.46,000 --> 0:07:25,000
out of nowhere, two terms come crashing into my head, that I hadn't heard

171
0:07:25.959,000 --> 0:07:28,000
since my classics professor in college drilled them there.

172
0:07:29.099,000 --> 0:07:31,000
And they are "anagnorisis" and "peripeteia."

173
0:07:31.792,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Anagnorisis and peripeteia.

174
0:07:34.143,000 --> 0:07:37,000
Anagnorisis is the Greek word for discovery.

175
0:07:38.48,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Literally, the transition from ignorance to knowledge is anagnorisis.

176
0:07:44.53,000 --> 0:07:47,000
It's what our network does; it's what "Dirty Jobs" is.

177
0:07:47.896,000 --> 0:07:51,000
And I'm up to my neck in anagnorises every single day.

178
0:07:51.958,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Great.

179
0:07:53.137,000 --> 0:07:55,000
The other word, peripeteia,

180
0:07:55.299,000 --> 0:08:,000
that's the moment in the great tragedies --

181
0:08:00.637,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Euripides and Sophocles.

182
0:08:02.899,000 --> 0:08:07,000
That's the moment where Oedipus has his moment, where he suddenly realizes

183
0:08:08.428,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that hot chick he's been sleeping with and having babies with

184
0:08:11.347,000 --> 0:08:12,000
is his mother.

185
0:08:12.77,000 --> 0:08:14,000
That's peripety, or peripeteia.

186
0:08:15.789,000 --> 0:08:17,000
And this metaphor in my head --

187
0:08:17.972,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I've got anagnorisis and peripeteia on my chin --

188
0:08:20.737,000 --> 0:08:22,000
(Laughter)

189
0:08:23.026,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I've got to tell you, it's such a great device, though.

190
0:08:25.654,000 --> 0:08:27,000
When you start to look for peripeteia,

191
0:08:28.251,000 --> 0:08:29,000
you find it everywhere.

192
0:08:29.812,000 --> 0:08:31,000
I mean, Bruce Willis in "The Sixth Sense," right?

193
0:08:32.749,000 --> 0:08:35,000
Spends the whole movie trying to help the little kid who sees dead people,

194
0:08:36.329,000 --> 0:08:37,000
and then -- boom! -- "Oh, I'm dead."

195
0:08:38.078,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Peripeteia. You know?

196
0:08:39.262,000 --> 0:08:42,000
It's crushing when the audience sees it the right way.

197
0:08:42.756,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Neo in "The Matrix," you know?

198
0:08:45.281,000 --> 0:08:46,000
"Oh, I'm living in a computer program.

199
0:08:47.28,000 --> 0:08:48,000
That's weird."

200
0:08:48.867,000 --> 0:08:5,000
These discoveries that lead to sudden realizations.

201
0:08:52.443,000 --> 0:08:54,000
And I've been having them, over 200 dirty jobs,

202
0:08:55.144,000 --> 0:08:57,000
I have them all the time, but that one --

203
0:08:57.3,000 --> 0:09:01,000
that one drilled something home in a way that I just wasn't prepared for.

204
0:09:02.145,000 --> 0:09:03,000
And, as I stood there,

205
0:09:04.236,000 --> 0:09:09,000
looking at the happy lamb that I had just defiled --

206
0:09:09.867,000 --> 0:09:1,000
but it looked OK;

207
0:09:11.68,000 --> 0:09:15,000
looking at that poor other little thing that I'd done it the right way on,

208
0:09:15.981,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and I just was struck by --

209
0:09:17.659,000 --> 0:09:21,000
if I'm wrong about that,

210
0:09:21.913,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and if I'm wrong so often, in a literal way,

211
0:09:24.304,000 --> 0:09:29,000
what other peripatetic misconceptions might I be able to comment upon?

212
0:09:29.615,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Because, look -- I'm not a social anthropologist,

213
0:09:32.116,000 --> 0:09:33,000
but I have a friend who is.

214
0:09:33.456,000 --> 0:09:34,000
And I talk to him.

215
0:09:35.16,000 --> 0:09:36,000
(Laughter)

216
0:09:36.711,000 --> 0:09:37,000
And he says, "Hey Mike, look.

217
0:09:38.237,000 --> 0:09:41,000
I don't know if your brain is interested in this sort of thing or not,

218
0:09:42.245,000 --> 0:09:44,000
but do you realize you've shot in every state?

219
0:09:44.539,000 --> 0:09:47,000
You've worked in mining, you've worked in fishing,

220
0:09:47.835,000 --> 0:09:5,000
you've worked in steel, you've worked in every major industry.

221
0:09:51.527,000 --> 0:09:54,000
You've had your back shoulder to shoulder with these guys

222
0:09:54.606,000 --> 0:09:57,000
that our politicians are desperate to relate to every four years, right?"

223
0:09:58.236,000 --> 0:10:,000
I can still see Hillary doing the shots of rye,

224
0:10:00.876,000 --> 0:10:02,000
dribbling down her chin, with the steel workers.

225
0:10:03.2,000 --> 0:10:06,000
I mean, these are the people that I work with every single day.

226
0:10:06.799,000 --> 0:10:1,000
"And if you have something to say about their thoughts, collectively,

227
0:10:10.831,000 --> 0:10:11,000
it might be time to think about it.

228
0:10:12.769,000 --> 0:10:15,000
Because, dude, you know, four years."

229
0:10:16.36,000 --> 0:10:2,000
So, that's in my head, testicles are on my chin,

230
0:10:20.611,000 --> 0:10:21,000
thoughts are bouncing around.

231
0:10:22.52,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And, after that shoot, "Dirty Jobs" really didn't change,

232
0:10:27.913,000 --> 0:10:3,000
in terms of what the show is, but it changed for me, personally.

233
0:10:31.391,000 --> 0:10:32,000
And now, when I talk about the show,

234
0:10:33.294,000 --> 0:10:38,000
I no longer just tell the story you heard and 190 like it.

235
0:10:39.666,000 --> 0:10:42,000
I do, but I also start to talk about some of the other things

236
0:10:42.899,000 --> 0:10:43,000
I got wrong;

237
0:10:44.098,000 --> 0:10:46,000
some of the other notions of work

238
0:10:46.148,000 --> 0:10:49,000
that I've just been assuming are sacrosanct,

239
0:10:50.054,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and they're not.

240
0:10:51.229,000 --> 0:10:53,000
People with dirty jobs are happier than you think.

241
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
As a group, they're the happiest people I know.

242
0:10:57.195,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And I don't want to start whistling "Look for the Union Label,"

243
0:11:00.201,000 --> 0:11:01,000
and all that happy-worker crap.

244
0:11:01.709,000 --> 0:11:03,000
I'm just telling you that these are balanced people

245
0:11:04.13,000 --> 0:11:05,000
who do unthinkable work.

246
0:11:05.309,000 --> 0:11:08,000
Roadkill picker-uppers whistle while they work, I swear to God --

247
0:11:08.434,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I did it with them.

248
0:11:09.612,000 --> 0:11:13,000
They've got this amazing sort of symmetry to their life.

249
0:11:13.841,000 --> 0:11:15,000
And I see it over and over and over again.

250
0:11:16.494,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So I started to wonder what would happen

251
0:11:18.608,000 --> 0:11:2,000
if we challenged some of these sacred cows?

252
0:11:21.675,000 --> 0:11:22,000
Follow your passion --

253
0:11:23.387,000 --> 0:11:26,000
we've been talking about it here for the last 36 hours.

254
0:11:27.035,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Follow your passion -- what could possibly be wrong with that?

255
0:11:30.001,000 --> 0:11:32,000
It's probably the worst advice I ever got.

256
0:11:32.028,000 --> 0:11:33,000
(Laughter)

257
0:11:33.126,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Follow your dreams and go broke, right?

258
0:11:35.028,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I mean, that's all I heard growing up.

259
0:11:36.874,000 --> 0:11:37,000
I didn't know what to do with my life,

260
0:11:38.724,000 --> 0:11:41,000
but I was told if you follow your passion, it's going to work out.

261
0:11:41.889,000 --> 0:11:42,000
I can give you 30 examples right now.

262
0:11:43.714,000 --> 0:11:45,000
Bob Combs, the pig farmer in Las Vegas

263
0:11:45.811,000 --> 0:11:47,000
who collects the uneaten scraps of food from the casinos

264
0:11:48.493,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and feeds them to his swine.

265
0:11:50.204,000 --> 0:11:51,000
Why?

266
0:11:51.379,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Because there's so much protein in the stuff we don't eat,

267
0:11:54.177,000 --> 0:11:57,000
his pigs grow at twice the normal speed, and he's one rich pig farmer.

268
0:11:57.518,000 --> 0:11:58,000
He's good for the environment,

269
0:11:58.979,000 --> 0:12:,000
he spends his days doing this incredible service,

270
0:12:01.307,000 --> 0:12:03,000
and he smells like hell, but God bless him.

271
0:12:03.339,000 --> 0:12:04,000
He's making a great living.

272
0:12:04.661,000 --> 0:12:06,000
You ask him, "Did you follow your passion here?"

273
0:12:06.954,000 --> 0:12:07,000
and he'd laugh at you.

274
0:12:08.133,000 --> 0:12:12,000
The guy's worth -- he just got offered like 60 million dollars for his farm

275
0:12:12.402,000 --> 0:12:14,000
and turned it down, outside of Vegas.

276
0:12:14.632,000 --> 0:12:15,000
He didn't follow his passion.

277
0:12:16.077,000 --> 0:12:18,000
He stepped back and he watched where everybody was going,

278
0:12:19.047,000 --> 0:12:21,000
and he went the other way.

279
0:12:21.36,000 --> 0:12:22,000
And I hear that story over and over.

280
0:12:23.3,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Matt Freund, a dairy farmer in New Canaan, Connecticut,

281
0:12:26.896,000 --> 0:12:27,000
who woke up one day and realized

282
0:12:28.646,000 --> 0:12:3,000
the crap from his cows was worth more than their milk,

283
0:12:31.383,000 --> 0:12:34,000
if he could use it to make these biodegradable flowerpots.

284
0:12:35.289,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Now he's selling them to Walmart, right?

285
0:12:38.589,000 --> 0:12:4,000
Follow his passion? The guy's -- come on.

286
0:12:41.646,000 --> 0:12:43,000
So I started to look at passion,

287
0:12:43.877,000 --> 0:12:47,000
I started to look at efficiency vs. effectiveness.

288
0:12:47.999,000 --> 0:12:5,000
As Tim talked about earlier, that's a huge distinction.

289
0:12:51.192,000 --> 0:12:53,000
I started to look at teamwork and determination.

290
0:12:53.695,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And basically, all those platitudes they call "successories"

291
0:12:56.715,000 --> 0:12:59,000
that hang with that schmaltzy art in boardrooms around the world right now,

292
0:13:00.666,000 --> 0:13:04,000
that stuff -- it's suddenly all been turned on its head.

293
0:13:05.578,000 --> 0:13:08,000
Safety. Safety first is ...

294
0:13:09.239,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Going back to OSHA and PETA and the Humane Society:

295
0:13:13.185,000 --> 0:13:15,000
What if OSHA got it wrong?

296
0:13:15.485,000 --> 0:13:17,000
I mean -- this is heresy, what I'm about to say --

297
0:13:17.856,000 --> 0:13:19,000
but what if it's really safety third?

298
0:13:20.683,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Right?

299
0:13:21.877,000 --> 0:13:22,000
(Laughter)

300
0:13:23.327,000 --> 0:13:25,000
No, I mean, really.

301
0:13:25.564,000 --> 0:13:26,000
What I mean to say is:

302
0:13:27.396,000 --> 0:13:29,000
I value my safety on these crazy jobs

303
0:13:29.884,000 --> 0:13:31,000
as much as the people that I'm working with,

304
0:13:32.47,000 --> 0:13:34,000
but the ones who really get it done --

305
0:13:34.77,000 --> 0:13:36,000
they're not out there talking about safety first.

306
0:13:38.114,000 --> 0:13:4,000
They know that other things come first --

307
0:13:40.16,000 --> 0:13:42,000
the business of doing the work comes first,

308
0:13:42.232,000 --> 0:13:43,000
the business of getting it done.

309
0:13:44.079,000 --> 0:13:46,000
And I'll never forget, up in the Bering Sea,

310
0:13:46.864,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I was on a crab boat with the "Deadliest Catch" guys --

311
0:13:49.622,000 --> 0:13:51,000
which I also work on in the first season.

312
0:13:51.938,000 --> 0:13:53,000
We were about 100 miles off the coast of Russia:

313
0:13:54.638,000 --> 0:13:58,000
50-foot seas, big waves, green water coming over the wheelhouse, right?

314
0:13:59.059,000 --> 0:14:01,000
Most hazardous environment I'd ever seen,

315
0:14:01.16,000 --> 0:14:03,000
and I was back with a guy, lashing the pots down.

316
0:14:04.082,000 --> 0:14:06,000
So I'm 40 feet off the deck,

317
0:14:06.262,000 --> 0:14:08,000
which is like looking down at the top of your shoe, you know,

318
0:14:09.184,000 --> 0:14:1,000
and it's doing this in the ocean.

319
0:14:10.815,000 --> 0:14:11,000
Unspeakably dangerous.

320
0:14:11.995,000 --> 0:14:12,000
I scamper down, I go into the wheelhouse

321
0:14:13.953,000 --> 0:14:15,000
and I say, with some level of incredulity,

322
0:14:17.298,000 --> 0:14:18,000
"Captain -- OSHA?"

323
0:14:19.135,000 --> 0:14:21,000
And he says, "OSHA? Ocean."

324
0:14:21.716,000 --> 0:14:22,000
And he points out there.

325
0:14:23.16,000 --> 0:14:26,000
(Laughter)

326
0:14:26.515,000 --> 0:14:3,000
But in that moment, what he said next can't be repeated in the Lower 48.

327
0:14:31.49,000 --> 0:14:34,000
It can't be repeated on any factory floor or any construction site.

328
0:14:35.115,000 --> 0:14:36,000
But he looked at me and said, "Son," --

329
0:14:37.024,000 --> 0:14:39,000
he's my age, by the way, he calls me "son," I love that --

330
0:14:39.795,000 --> 0:14:41,000
he says, "Son, I'm the captain of a crab boat.

331
0:14:41.994,000 --> 0:14:43,000
My responsibility is not to get you home alive.

332
0:14:44.587,000 --> 0:14:46,000
My responsibility is to get you home rich."

333
0:14:46.957,000 --> 0:14:47,000
(Laughter)

334
0:14:48.445,000 --> 0:14:5,000
You want to get home alive, that's on you."

335
0:14:50.675,000 --> 0:14:52,000
And for the rest of that day -- safety first.

336
0:14:53.327,000 --> 0:14:54,000
I mean, I was like --

337
0:14:54.994,000 --> 0:15:,000
So, the idea that we create this sense of complacency

338
0:15:01.328,000 --> 0:15:05,000
when all we do is talk about somebody else's responsibility

339
0:15:05.851,000 --> 0:15:06,000
as though it's our own, and vice versa.

340
0:15:07.808,000 --> 0:15:08,000
Anyhow, a whole lot of things.

341
0:15:09.454,000 --> 0:15:12,000
I could talk at length about the many little distinctions we made

342
0:15:12.905,000 --> 0:15:14,000
and the endless list of ways that I got it wrong.

343
0:15:15.785,000 --> 0:15:17,000
But what it all comes down to is this:

344
0:15:18.144,000 --> 0:15:19,000
I've formed a theory,

345
0:15:19.363,000 --> 0:15:22,000
and I'm going to share it now in my remaining 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

346
0:15:22.802,000 --> 0:15:23,000
It goes like this:

347
0:15:25.013,000 --> 0:15:29,000
we've declared war on work, as a society -- all of us.

348
0:15:30.001,000 --> 0:15:31,000
It's a civil war.

349
0:15:31.933,000 --> 0:15:32,000
It's a cold war, really.

350
0:15:33.85,000 --> 0:15:35,000
We didn't set out to do it

351
0:15:36.16,000 --> 0:15:39,000
and we didn't twist our mustache in some Machiavellian way,

352
0:15:39.805,000 --> 0:15:4,000
but we've done it.

353
0:15:41.051,000 --> 0:15:44,000
And we've waged this war on at least four fronts,

354
0:15:44.774,000 --> 0:15:45,000
certainly in Hollywood.

355
0:15:46.281,000 --> 0:15:48,000
The way we portray working people on TV --

356
0:15:48.915,000 --> 0:15:49,000
it's laughable.

357
0:15:50.16,000 --> 0:15:51,000
If there's a plumber, he's 300 pounds

358
0:15:51.958,000 --> 0:15:53,000
and he's got a giant butt crack, admit it.

359
0:15:54.073,000 --> 0:15:55,000
You see him all the time.

360
0:15:55.348,000 --> 0:15:57,000
That's what plumbers look like, right?

361
0:15:57.853,000 --> 0:16:,000
We turn them into heroes, or we turn them into punch lines.

362
0:16:01.065,000 --> 0:16:02,000
That's what TV does.

363
0:16:02.271,000 --> 0:16:04,000
We try hard on "Dirty Jobs" not to do that,

364
0:16:04.636,000 --> 0:16:06,000
which is why I do the work and I don't cheat.

365
0:16:08.382,000 --> 0:16:1,000
But, we've waged this war on Madison Avenue.

366
0:16:11.271,000 --> 0:16:15,000
So many of the commercials that come out there in the way of a message --

367
0:16:15.684,000 --> 0:16:16,000
what's really being said?

368
0:16:17.161,000 --> 0:16:19,000
"Your life would be better if you could work a little less,

369
0:16:19.967,000 --> 0:16:21,000
didn't have to work so hard, got home a little earlier,

370
0:16:22.824,000 --> 0:16:24,000
could retire a little faster, punch out a little sooner."

371
0:16:25.537,000 --> 0:16:27,000
It's all in there, over and over, again and again.

372
0:16:28.185,000 --> 0:16:29,000
Washington?

373
0:16:29.36,000 --> 0:16:32,000
I can't even begin to talk about the deals and policies in place

374
0:16:32.415,000 --> 0:16:35,000
that affect the bottom-line reality of the available jobs,

375
0:16:35.948,000 --> 0:16:38,000
because I don't really know; I just know that that's a front in this war.

376
0:16:39.535,000 --> 0:16:41,000
And right here, guys -- Silicon Valley.

377
0:16:41.654,000 --> 0:16:44,000
I mean -- how many people have an iPhone on them right now?

378
0:16:44.744,000 --> 0:16:45,000
How many people have their BlackBerry?

379
0:16:46.611,000 --> 0:16:47,000
We're plugged in; we're connected.

380
0:16:48.425,000 --> 0:16:5,000
I would never suggest for a second

381
0:16:50.712,000 --> 0:16:52,000
that something bad has come out of the tech revolution.

382
0:16:53.707,000 --> 0:16:54,000
Good grief, not to this crowd.

383
0:16:55.326,000 --> 0:16:57,000
(Laughter)

384
0:16:57.481,000 --> 0:16:58,000
But I would suggest

385
0:16:58.788,000 --> 0:17:02,000
that innovation without imitation is a complete waste of time.

386
0:17:04.132,000 --> 0:17:06,000
And nobody celebrates imitation

387
0:17:06.629,000 --> 0:17:09,000
the way "Dirty Jobs" guys know it has to be done.

388
0:17:10.395,000 --> 0:17:13,000
Your iPhone without those people making the same interface,

389
0:17:13.831,000 --> 0:17:15,000
the same circuitry, the same board, over and over --

390
0:17:16.315,000 --> 0:17:19,000
all of that -- that's what makes it equally as possible

391
0:17:19.847,000 --> 0:17:22,000
as the genius that goes inside of it.

392
0:17:23.057,000 --> 0:17:25,000
So, we've got this new toolbox. You know?

393
0:17:25.914,000 --> 0:17:28,000
Our tools today don't look like shovels and picks.

394
0:17:29.524,000 --> 0:17:32,000
They look like the stuff we walk around with.

395
0:17:32.631,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And so the collective effect of all of that

396
0:17:37.874,000 --> 0:17:42,000
has been this marginalization of lots and lots of jobs.

397
0:17:43.307,000 --> 0:17:46,000
And I realized, probably too late in this game --

398
0:17:46.334,000 --> 0:17:49,000
I hope not, because I don't know if I can do 200 more of these things --

399
0:17:49.812,000 --> 0:17:5,000
but we're going to do as many as we can.

400
0:17:51.751,000 --> 0:17:53,000
And to me, the most important thing to know

401
0:17:53.836,000 --> 0:17:54,000
and to really come face to face with,

402
0:17:55.692,000 --> 0:17:57,000
is that fact that I got it wrong about a lot of things,

403
0:17:58.489,000 --> 0:18:,000
not just the testicles on my chin.

404
0:18:00.573,000 --> 0:18:02,000
I got a lot wrong.

405
0:18:03.913,000 --> 0:18:06,000
So, we're thinking -- by "we," I mean me --

406
0:18:07.936,000 --> 0:18:08,000
(Laughter)

407
0:18:09.85,000 --> 0:18:13,000
that the thing to do is to talk about a PR campaign for work --

408
0:18:15.013,000 --> 0:18:17,000
manual labor, skilled labor.

409
0:18:17.314,000 --> 0:18:22,000
Somebody needs to be out there, talking about the forgotten benefits.

410
0:18:22.627,000 --> 0:18:23,000
I'm talking about grandfather stuff,

411
0:18:24.412,000 --> 0:18:25,000
the stuff a lot us probably grew up with

412
0:18:26.383,000 --> 0:18:3,000
but we've kind of -- you know, kind of lost a little.

413
0:18:31.529,000 --> 0:18:33,000
Barack wants to create two and a half million jobs.

414
0:18:34.542,000 --> 0:18:35,000
The infrastructure is a huge deal.

415
0:18:36.222,000 --> 0:18:4,000
This war on work that I suppose exists, has casualties like any other war.

416
0:18:40.302,000 --> 0:18:41,000
The infrastructure is the first one,

417
0:18:42.16,000 --> 0:18:44,000
declining trade school enrollments are the second one.

418
0:18:45.147,000 --> 0:18:49,000
Every single year, fewer electricians, fewer carpenters, fewer plumbers,

419
0:18:50.012,000 --> 0:18:54,000
fewer welders, fewer pipe fitters, fewer steam fitters.

420
0:18:54.869,000 --> 0:18:57,000
The infrastructure jobs that everybody is talking about creating

421
0:18:58.564,000 --> 0:19:01,000
are those guys -- the ones that have been in decline, over and over.

422
0:19:02.264,000 --> 0:19:05,000
Meanwhile, we've got two trillion dollars, at a minimum,

423
0:19:05.294,000 --> 0:19:07,000
according to the American Society of Civil Engineers,

424
0:19:07.867,000 --> 0:19:1,000
that we need to expend to even make a dent in the infrastructure,

425
0:19:11.026,000 --> 0:19:13,000
which is currently rated at a D minus.

426
0:19:13.296,000 --> 0:19:17,000
So, if I were running for anything -- and I'm not --

427
0:19:17.845,000 --> 0:19:19,000
I would simply say that the jobs we hope to make

428
0:19:20.478,000 --> 0:19:22,000
and the jobs we hope to create

429
0:19:22.556,000 --> 0:19:25,000
aren't going to stick unless they're jobs that people want.

430
0:19:26.091,000 --> 0:19:28,000
And I know the point of this conference

431
0:19:28.71,000 --> 0:19:3,000
is to celebrate things that are near and dear to us,

432
0:19:31.641,000 --> 0:19:34,000
but I also know that clean and dirty aren't opposites.

433
0:19:34.669,000 --> 0:19:37,000
They're two sides of the same coin, just like innovation and imitation,

434
0:19:38.314,000 --> 0:19:43,000
like risk and responsibility, like peripeteia and anagnorisis,

435
0:19:43.423,000 --> 0:19:46,000
like that poor little lamb, who I hope isn't quivering anymore,

436
0:19:47.078,000 --> 0:19:48,000
and like my time that's gone.

437
0:19:48.594,000 --> 0:19:5,000
It's been great talking to you.

438
0:19:50.624,000 --> 0:19:51,000
And get back to work, will you?

439
0:19:52.16,000 --> 0:19:54,000
(Applause)

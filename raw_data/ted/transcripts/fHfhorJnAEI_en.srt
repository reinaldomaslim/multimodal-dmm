1
0:00:13.114,000 --> 0:00:2,000
So over the past few centuries, microscopes have revolutionized our world.

2
0:00:21.036,000 --> 0:00:26,000
They revealed to us a tiny world of objects, life and structures

3
0:00:26.252,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that are too small for us to see with our naked eyes.

4
0:00:29.158,000 --> 0:00:32,000
They are a tremendous contribution to science and technology.

5
0:00:32.177,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Today I'd like to introduce you to a new type of microscope,

6
0:00:35.404,000 --> 0:00:37,000
a microscope for changes.

7
0:00:37.982,000 --> 0:00:39,000
It doesn't use optics like a regular microscope

8
0:00:40.884,000 --> 0:00:41,000
to make small objects bigger,

9
0:00:42.881,000 --> 0:00:46,000
but instead it uses a video camera and image processing

10
0:00:47.257,000 --> 0:00:52,000
to reveal to us the tiniest motions and color changes in objects and people,

11
0:00:52.513,000 --> 0:00:55,000
changes that are impossible for us to see with our naked eyes.

12
0:00:56.355,000 --> 0:01:,000
And it lets us look at our world in a completely new way.

13
0:01:00.475,000 --> 0:01:01,000
So what do I mean by color changes?

14
0:01:02.385,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Our skin, for example, changes its color very slightly

15
0:01:05.217,000 --> 0:01:06,000
when the blood flows under it.

16
0:01:07.214,000 --> 0:01:09,000
That change is incredibly subtle,

17
0:01:09.611,000 --> 0:01:11,000
which is why, when you look at other people,

18
0:01:11.674,000 --> 0:01:13,000
when you look at the person sitting next to you,

19
0:01:13.925,000 --> 0:01:16,000
you don't see their skin or their face changing color.

20
0:01:17.5,000 --> 0:01:21,000
When we look at this video of Steve here, it appears to us like a static picture,

21
0:01:21.86,000 --> 0:01:24,000
but once we look at this video through our new, special microscope,

22
0:01:25.72,000 --> 0:01:27,000
suddenly we see a completely different image.

23
0:01:28.32,000 --> 0:01:31,000
What you see here are small changes in the color of Steve's skin,

24
0:01:32.25,000 --> 0:01:36,000
magnified 100 times so that they become visible.

25
0:01:36.686,000 --> 0:01:39,000
We can actually see a human pulse.

26
0:01:39.953,000 --> 0:01:42,000
We can see how fast Steve's heart is beating,

27
0:01:43.18,000 --> 0:01:48,000
but we can also see the actual way that the blood flows in his face.

28
0:01:48.544,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And we can do that not just to visualize the pulse,

29
0:01:51.175,000 --> 0:01:54,000
but also to actually recover our heart rates,

30
0:01:54.646,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and measure our heart rates.

31
0:01:56.439,000 --> 0:02:,000
And we can do it with regular cameras and without touching the patients.

32
0:02:00.892,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So here you see the pulse and heart rate we extracted from a neonatal baby

33
0:02:06.509,000 --> 0:02:08,000
from a video we took with a regular DSLR camera,

34
0:02:09.39,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and the heart rate measurement we get

35
0:02:11.206,000 --> 0:02:15,000
is as accurate as the one you'd get with a standard monitor in a hospital.

36
0:02:16.017,000 --> 0:02:18,000
And it doesn't even have to be a video we recorded.

37
0:02:18.659,000 --> 0:02:2,000
We can do it essentially with other videos as well.

38
0:02:21.654,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So I just took a short clip from "Batman Begins" here

39
0:02:25.555,000 --> 0:02:26,000
just to show Christian Bale's pulse.

40
0:02:27.459,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Laughter)

41
0:02:29.281,000 --> 0:02:31,000
And you know, presumably he's wearing makeup,

42
0:02:31.404,000 --> 0:02:32,000
the lighting here is kind of challenging,

43
0:02:33.357,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but still, just from the video, we're able to extract his pulse

44
0:02:36.308,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and show it quite well.

45
0:02:38.326,000 --> 0:02:39,000
So how do we do all that?

46
0:02:40.246,000 --> 0:02:44,000
We basically analyze the changes in the light that are recorded

47
0:02:44.844,000 --> 0:02:46,000
at every pixel in the video over time,

48
0:02:47.115,000 --> 0:02:48,000
and then we crank up those changes.

49
0:02:48.913,000 --> 0:02:5,000
We make them bigger so that we can see them.

50
0:02:51.075,000 --> 0:02:52,000
The tricky part is that those signals,

51
0:02:52.977,000 --> 0:02:54,000
those changes that we're after, are extremely subtle,

52
0:02:55.91,000 --> 0:02:57,000
so we have to be very careful when you try to separate them

53
0:02:58.689,000 --> 0:03:01,000
from noise that always exists in videos.

54
0:03:02.52,000 --> 0:03:04,000
So we use some clever image processing techniques

55
0:03:05.515,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to get a very accurate measurement of the color at each pixel in the video,

56
0:03:09.509,000 --> 0:03:11,000
and then the way the color changes over time,

57
0:03:12.179,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and then we amplify those changes.

58
0:03:14.872,000 --> 0:03:17,000
We make them bigger to create those types of enhanced videos, or magnified videos,

59
0:03:18.852,000 --> 0:03:2,000
that actually show us those changes.

60
0:03:21.024,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But it turns out we can do that not just to show tiny changes in color,

61
0:03:25.262,000 --> 0:03:27,000
but also tiny motions,

62
0:03:27.503,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and that's because the light that gets recorded in our cameras

63
0:03:31.079,000 --> 0:03:33,000
will change not only if the color of the object changes,

64
0:03:33.889,000 --> 0:03:35,000
but also if the object moves.

65
0:03:36.257,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So this is my daughter when she was about two months old.

66
0:03:39.893,000 --> 0:03:41,000
It's a video I recorded about three years ago.

67
0:03:42.892,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And as new parents, we all want to make sure our babies are healthy,

68
0:03:46.1,000 --> 0:03:48,000
that they're breathing, that they're alive, of course.

69
0:03:48.642,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So I too got one of those baby monitors

70
0:03:50.784,000 --> 0:03:52,000
so that I could see my daughter when she was asleep.

71
0:03:53.253,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And this is pretty much what you'll see with a standard baby monitor.

72
0:03:56.78,000 --> 0:03:59,000
You can see the baby's sleeping, but there's not too much information there.

73
0:04:00.474,000 --> 0:04:01,000
There's not too much we can see.

74
0:04:02.078,000 --> 0:04:04,000
Wouldn't it be better, or more informative, or more useful,

75
0:04:04.902,000 --> 0:04:06,000
if instead we could look at the view like this.

76
0:04:07.892,000 --> 0:04:13,000
So here I took the motions and I magnified them 30 times,

77
0:04:14.248,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and then I could clearly see that my daughter was indeed alive and breathing.

78
0:04:18.074,000 --> 0:04:2,000
(Laughter)

79
0:04:20.327,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Here is a side-by-side comparison.

80
0:04:22.249,000 --> 0:04:24,000
So again, in the source video, in the original video,

81
0:04:24.732,000 --> 0:04:25,000
there's not too much we can see,

82
0:04:26.368,000 --> 0:04:29,000
but once we magnify the motions, the breathing becomes much more visible.

83
0:04:30.075,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And it turns out, there's a lot of phenomena

84
0:04:32.145,000 --> 0:04:35,000
we can reveal and magnify with our new motion microscope.

85
0:04:35.768,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We can see how our veins and arteries are pulsing in our bodies.

86
0:04:40.332,000 --> 0:04:42,000
We can see that our eyes are constantly moving

87
0:04:42.96,000 --> 0:04:43,000
in this wobbly motion.

88
0:04:44.847,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And that's actually my eye,

89
0:04:46.356,000 --> 0:04:49,000
and again this video was taken right after my daughter was born,

90
0:04:49.421,000 --> 0:04:53,000
so you can see I wasn't getting too much sleep. (Laughter)

91
0:04:53.623,000 --> 0:04:55,000
Even when a person is sitting still,

92
0:04:56.339,000 --> 0:04:58,000
there's a lot of information we can extract

93
0:04:58.383,000 --> 0:05:01,000
about their breathing patterns, small facial expressions.

94
0:05:01.912,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Maybe we could use those motions

95
0:05:03.537,000 --> 0:05:06,000
to tell us something about our thoughts or our emotions.

96
0:05:06.691,000 --> 0:05:09,000
We can also magnify small mechanical movements,

97
0:05:09.946,000 --> 0:05:1,000
like vibrations in engines,

98
0:05:11.501,000 --> 0:05:14,000
that can help engineers detect and diagnose machinery problems,

99
0:05:15.193,000 --> 0:05:19,000
or see how our buildings and structures sway in the wind and react to forces.

100
0:05:19.931,000 --> 0:05:23,000
Those are all things that our society knows how to measure in various ways,

101
0:05:24.512,000 --> 0:05:26,000
but measuring those motions is one thing,

102
0:05:26.965,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and actually seeing those motions as they happen

103
0:05:29.241,000 --> 0:05:31,000
is a whole different thing.

104
0:05:31.795,000 --> 0:05:34,000
And ever since we discovered this new technology,

105
0:05:34.836,000 --> 0:05:37,000
we made our code available online so that others could use and experiment with it.

106
0:05:38.789,000 --> 0:05:39,000
It's very simple to use.

107
0:05:40.664,000 --> 0:05:42,000
It can work on your own videos.

108
0:05:42.708,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Our collaborators at Quanta Research even created this nice website

109
0:05:45.901,000 --> 0:05:47,000
where you can upload your videos and process them online,

110
0:05:48.579,000 --> 0:05:51,000
so even if you don't have any experience in computer science or programming,

111
0:05:52.395,000 --> 0:05:54,000
you can still very easily experiment with this new microscope.

112
0:05:55.331,000 --> 0:05:57,000
And I'd like to show you just a couple of examples

113
0:05:57.735,000 --> 0:05:59,000
of what others have done with it.

114
0:06:00.47,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So this video was made by a YouTube user called Tamez85.

115
0:06:05.787,000 --> 0:06:06,000
I don't know who that user is,

116
0:06:07.25,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but he, or she, used our code

117
0:06:09.595,000 --> 0:06:12,000
to magnify small belly movements during pregnancy.

118
0:06:13.31,000 --> 0:06:14,000
It's kind of creepy.

119
0:06:14.912,000 --> 0:06:15,000
(Laughter)

120
0:06:16.525,000 --> 0:06:2,000
People have used it to magnify pulsing veins in their hands.

121
0:06:21.486,000 --> 0:06:24,000
And you know it's not real science unless you use guinea pigs,

122
0:06:25.268,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and apparently this guinea pig is called Tiffany,

123
0:06:28.658,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and this YouTube user claims it is the first rodent on Earth

124
0:06:31.607,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that was motion-magnified.

125
0:06:34.295,000 --> 0:06:36,000
You can also do some art with it.

126
0:06:36.483,000 --> 0:06:39,000
So this video was sent to me by a design student at Yale.

127
0:06:39.501,000 --> 0:06:41,000
She wanted to see if there's any difference

128
0:06:41.638,000 --> 0:06:42,000
in the way her classmates move.

129
0:06:43.16,000 --> 0:06:47,000
She made them all stand still, and then magnified their motions.

130
0:06:47.369,000 --> 0:06:5,000
It's like seeing still pictures come to life.

131
0:06:50.747,000 --> 0:06:52,000
And the nice thing with all those examples

132
0:06:53.18,000 --> 0:06:55,000
is that we had nothing to do with them.

133
0:06:55.476,000 --> 0:06:58,000
We just provided this new tool, a new way to look at the world,

134
0:06:59.33,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and then people find other interesting, new and creative ways of using it.

135
0:07:04.462,000 --> 0:07:05,000
But we didn't stop there.

136
0:07:06.226,000 --> 0:07:09,000
This tool not only allows us to look at the world in a new way,

137
0:07:09.477,000 --> 0:07:11,000
it also redefines what we can do

138
0:07:11.845,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and pushes the limits of what we can do with our cameras.

139
0:07:15.026,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So as scientists, we started wondering,

140
0:07:17.255,000 --> 0:07:2,000
what other types of physical phenomena produce tiny motions

141
0:07:21.04,000 --> 0:07:23,000
that we could now use our cameras to measure?

142
0:07:23.943,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And one such phenomenon that we focused on recently is sound.

143
0:07:27.944,000 --> 0:07:29,000
Sound, as we all know, is basically changes

144
0:07:30.049,000 --> 0:07:32,000
in air pressure that travel through the air.

145
0:07:32.232,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Those pressure waves hit objects and they create small vibrations in them,

146
0:07:35.853,000 --> 0:07:37,000
which is how we hear and how we record sound.

147
0:07:38.385,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But it turns out that sound also produces visual motions.

148
0:07:42.053,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Those are motions that are not visible to us

149
0:07:44.886,000 --> 0:07:47,000
but are visible to a camera with the right processing.

150
0:07:47.887,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So here are two examples.

151
0:07:49.46,000 --> 0:07:51,000
This is me demonstrating my great singing skills.

152
0:07:53.064,000 --> 0:07:54,000
(Singing)

153
0:07:54.698,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:56.134,000 --> 0:07:58,000
And I took a high-speed video of my throat while I was humming.

155
0:07:59.12,000 --> 0:08:,000
Again, if you stare at that video,

156
0:08:00.884,000 --> 0:08:02,000
there's not too much you'll be able to see,

157
0:08:02.96,000 --> 0:08:06,000
but once we magnify the motions 100 times, we can see all the motions and ripples

158
0:08:07.292,000 --> 0:08:1,000
in the neck that are involved in producing the sound.

159
0:08:10.566,000 --> 0:08:12,000
That signal is there in that video.

160
0:08:13.306,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We also know that singers can break a wine glass

161
0:08:15.976,000 --> 0:08:16,000
if they hit the correct note.

162
0:08:17.439,000 --> 0:08:18,000
So here, we're going to play a note

163
0:08:19.204,000 --> 0:08:21,000
that's in the resonance frequency of that glass

164
0:08:21.73,000 --> 0:08:23,000
through a loudspeaker that's next to it.

165
0:08:23.778,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Once we play that note and magnify the motions 250 times,

166
0:08:28.197,000 --> 0:08:3,000
we can very clearly see how the glass vibrates

167
0:08:30.535,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and resonates in response to the sound.

168
0:08:34.105,000 --> 0:08:36,000
It's not something you're used to seeing every day.

169
0:08:36.525,000 --> 0:08:39,000
But this made us think. It gave us this crazy idea.

170
0:08:40.054,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Can we actually invert this process and recover sound from video

171
0:08:45.662,000 --> 0:08:49,000
by analyzing the tiny vibrations that sound waves create in objects,

172
0:08:49.697,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and essentially convert those back into the sounds that produced them.

173
0:08:54.474,000 --> 0:08:58,000
In this way, we can turn everyday objects into microphones.

174
0:08:58.931,000 --> 0:09:,000
So that's exactly what we did.

175
0:09:01.163,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So here's an empty bag of chips that was lying on a table,

176
0:09:03.979,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and we're going to turn that bag of chips into a microphone

177
0:09:06.804,000 --> 0:09:07,000
by filming it with a video camera

178
0:09:08.395,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and analyzing the tiny motions that sound waves create in it.

179
0:09:11.623,000 --> 0:09:13,000
So here's the sound that we played in the room.

180
0:09:14.419,000 --> 0:09:18,000
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

181
0:09:22.007,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And this is a high-speed video we recorded of that bag of chips.

182
0:09:25.032,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Again it's playing.

183
0:09:26.306,000 --> 0:09:29,000
There's no chance you'll be able to see anything going on in that video

184
0:09:29.648,000 --> 0:09:3,000
just by looking at it,

185
0:09:30.706,000 --> 0:09:32,000
but here's the sound we were able to recover just by analyzing

186
0:09:33.69,000 --> 0:09:35,000
the tiny motions in that video.

187
0:09:35.873,000 --> 0:09:37,000
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

188
0:09:52.985,000 --> 0:09:53,000
I call it -- Thank you.

189
0:09:54.471,000 --> 0:09:59,000
(Applause)

190
0:10:01.878,000 --> 0:10:03,000
I call it the visual microphone.

191
0:10:04.223,000 --> 0:10:07,000
We actually extract audio signals from video signals.

192
0:10:07.613,000 --> 0:10:1,000
And just to give you a sense of the scale of the motions here,

193
0:10:10.799,000 --> 0:10:15,000
a pretty loud sound will cause that bag of chips to move less than a micrometer.

194
0:10:16.135,000 --> 0:10:18,000
That's one thousandth of a millimeter.

195
0:10:18.874,000 --> 0:10:21,000
That's how tiny the motions are that we are now able to pull out

196
0:10:22.435,000 --> 0:10:25,000
just by observing how light bounces off objects

197
0:10:25.678,000 --> 0:10:27,000
and gets recorded by our cameras.

198
0:10:27.814,000 --> 0:10:3,000
We can recover sounds from other objects, like plants.

199
0:10:31.064,000 --> 0:10:37,000
(Music: "Mary Had a Little Lamb")

200
0:10:39.214,000 --> 0:10:4,000
And we can recover speech as well.

201
0:10:41.211,000 --> 0:10:43,000
So here's a person speaking in a room.

202
0:10:43.788,000 --> 0:10:47,000
Voice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,

203
0:10:47.991,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go.

204
0:10:52.221,000 --> 0:10:54,000
Michael Rubinstein: And here's that speech again recovered

205
0:10:54.98,000 --> 0:10:57,000
just from this video of that same bag of chips.

206
0:10:58.254,000 --> 0:11:02,000
Voice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,

207
0:11:03.085,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and everywhere that Mary went, that lamb was sure to go.

208
0:11:07.944,000 --> 0:11:09,000
MR: We used "Mary Had a Little Lamb"

209
0:11:10.29,000 --> 0:11:12,000
because those are said to be the first words

210
0:11:12.413,000 --> 0:11:16,000
that Thomas Edison spoke into his phonograph in 1877.

211
0:11:16.574,000 --> 0:11:19,000
It was one of the first sound recording devices in history.

212
0:11:19.802,000 --> 0:11:22,000
It basically directed the sounds onto a diaphragm

213
0:11:23.129,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that vibrated a needle that essentially engraved the sound on tinfoil

214
0:11:27.208,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that was wrapped around the cylinder.

215
0:11:29.483,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Here's a demonstration of recording and replaying sound with Edison's phonograph.

216
0:11:35.426,000 --> 0:11:38,000
(Video) Voice: Testing, testing, one two three.

217
0:11:38.446,000 --> 0:11:41,000
Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,

218
0:11:41.859,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.

219
0:11:45.528,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Testing, testing, one two three.

220
0:11:48.268,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,

221
0:11:52.424,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.

222
0:11:57.648,000 --> 0:12:01,000
MR: And now, 137 years later,

223
0:12:01.665,000 --> 0:12:05,000
we're able to get sound in pretty much similar quality

224
0:12:05.752,000 --> 0:12:09,000
but by just watching objects vibrate to sound with cameras,

225
0:12:09.831,000 --> 0:12:1,000
and we can even do that when the camera

226
0:12:11.765,000 --> 0:12:15,000
is 15 feet away from the object, behind soundproof glass.

227
0:12:15.999,000 --> 0:12:18,000
So this is the sound that we were able to recover in that case.

228
0:12:19.219,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Voice: Mary had a little lamb whose fleece was white as snow,

229
0:12:24.513,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.

230
0:12:29.404,000 --> 0:12:32,000
MR: And of course, surveillance is the first application that comes to mind.

231
0:12:33.034,000 --> 0:12:35,000
(Laughter)

232
0:12:36.029,000 --> 0:12:4,000
But it might actually be useful for other things as well.

233
0:12:40.085,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Maybe in the future, we'll be able to use it, for example,

234
0:12:42.925,000 --> 0:12:44,000
to recover sound across space,

235
0:12:45.177,000 --> 0:12:48,000
because sound can't travel in space, but light can.

236
0:12:48.753,000 --> 0:12:5,000
We've only just begun exploring

237
0:12:51.157,000 --> 0:12:54,000
other possible uses for this new technology.

238
0:12:54.176,000 --> 0:12:56,000
It lets us see physical processes that we know are there

239
0:12:57.008,000 --> 0:13:,000
but that we've never been able to see with our own eyes until now.

240
0:13:00.564,000 --> 0:13:01,000
This is our team.

241
0:13:01.768,000 --> 0:13:03,000
Everything I showed you today is a result of a collaboration

242
0:13:04.647,000 --> 0:13:06,000
with this great group of people you see here,

243
0:13:06.838,000 --> 0:13:09,000
and I encourage you and welcome you to check out our website,

244
0:13:10.005,000 --> 0:13:11,000
try it out yourself,

245
0:13:11.451,000 --> 0:13:13,000
and join us in exploring this world of tiny motions.

246
0:13:14.423,000 --> 0:13:15,000
Thank you.

247
0:13:16.048,000 --> 0:13:17,000
(Applause)

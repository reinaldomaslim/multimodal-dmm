1
0:00:12.482,000 --> 0:00:13,000
These are worms.

2
0:00:14.089,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Not the kind of worms you find crawling in the dirt.

3
0:00:16.699,000 --> 0:00:18,000
These are parasitic roundworms.

4
0:00:18.877,000 --> 0:00:2,000
They live inside a human being's intestines.

5
0:00:21.336,000 --> 0:00:23,000
Each of these worms can grow up to 12 inches long,

6
0:00:24.116,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and there are 200 of them in this jar for a reason,

7
0:00:26.521,000 --> 0:00:28,000
because that is the number you might typically find

8
0:00:28.927,000 --> 0:00:3,000
in the belly of a single infected child.

9
0:00:31.395,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Worm infections have been around for thousands of years.

10
0:00:34.079,000 --> 0:00:36,000
They have influenced the outcomes of wars,

11
0:00:36.103,000 --> 0:00:37,000
and they have long stymied human health.

12
0:00:38.04,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Roundworm, hookworm,

13
0:00:39.651,000 --> 0:00:41,000
whipworm, schistosomiasis:

14
0:00:41.698,000 --> 0:00:44,000
infections from these species cause pain and discomfort.

15
0:00:44.834,000 --> 0:00:46,000
They steal nutrients and zap energy.

16
0:00:46.951,000 --> 0:00:48,000
They stunt both physical and cognitive growth.

17
0:00:49.449,000 --> 0:00:51,000
In most cases, these worms may not be fatal,

18
0:00:52.195,000 --> 0:00:54,000
but paradoxically, that's part of the problem.

19
0:00:54.398,000 --> 0:00:55,000
It means that many countries

20
0:00:55.962,000 --> 0:00:57,000
simply have not been able to prioritize their treatment.

21
0:00:58.718,000 --> 0:00:59,000
There's a social cost to that:

22
0:01:00.359,000 --> 0:01:02,000
children without access to deworming treatments

23
0:01:02.575,000 --> 0:01:04,000
have lower rates of school attendance.

24
0:01:04.642,000 --> 0:01:06,000
Adults who grow up without deworming medicine

25
0:01:06.778,000 --> 0:01:08,000
are less productive and have lower lifelong earnings.

26
0:01:09.602,000 --> 0:01:11,000
What intestinal worms do, really,

27
0:01:11.738,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is limit potential.

28
0:01:13.189,000 --> 0:01:17,000
Currently, there are 1.7 billion people in the world still at risk for worms.

29
0:01:17.432,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Six hundred million of them are in Africa.

30
0:01:19.902,000 --> 0:01:22,000
For every dollar invested in worm control and prevention,

31
0:01:23.052,000 --> 0:01:27,000
African countries see up to 42 dollars return in economic benefits.

32
0:01:27.227,000 --> 0:01:3,000
The good news is that deworming treatment is extremely easy.

33
0:01:30.295,000 --> 0:01:32,000
One to three pills given once or twice a year

34
0:01:32.564,000 --> 0:01:35,000
is enough to take a child from 200 worms to zero

35
0:01:35.628,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and to protect them from infection going forward.

36
0:01:38.075,000 --> 0:01:4,000
In communities where there's a high prevalence of worms,

37
0:01:40.719,000 --> 0:01:41,000
treatment can be done right at school.

38
0:01:42.855,000 --> 0:01:44,000
This process is extremely simple and fast.

39
0:01:45.212,000 --> 0:01:48,000
In Ethiopia, for example, this is done for 20 million children

40
0:01:48.362,000 --> 0:01:49,000
in a matter of weeks.

41
0:01:50.172,000 --> 0:01:51,000
The world has come a long way

42
0:01:51.824,000 --> 0:01:53,000
on getting deworming medicines to the people who need them,

43
0:01:54.673,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and African governments want to gain more traction.

44
0:01:57.237,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It's now time to match their ambition.

45
0:01:59.729,000 --> 0:02:,000
The END Fund will work with governments

46
0:02:01.698,000 --> 0:02:05,000
to create a plan that drastically reduces the burden of disease caused by worms.

47
0:02:06.441,000 --> 0:02:09,000
They’ll work together to ensure prevention and treatment programs

48
0:02:09.603,000 --> 0:02:1,000
can serve everyone.

49
0:02:10.921,000 --> 0:02:12,000
The END Fund has an audacious idea:

50
0:02:13.124,000 --> 0:02:17,000
they believe we are the generation to end sickness from worm infections forever.

51
0:02:17.528,000 --> 0:02:2,000
The key is not simply to build new programs from scratch,

52
0:02:20.747,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but to amplify the efforts of the programs that are already taking shape.

53
0:02:24.413,000 --> 0:02:27,000
By examining the problem of how worms transmit disease,

54
0:02:27.549,000 --> 0:02:3,000
the END Fund has identified five key areas where they can drive improvement.

55
0:02:32.017,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Number one: lower the cost of treatment.

56
0:02:34.484,000 --> 0:02:37,000
Many pharmaceutical companies offer deworming medicines for free,

57
0:02:37.557,000 --> 0:02:39,000
so the END Fund works with the right partners

58
0:02:39.724,000 --> 0:02:4,000
to coordinate their delivery.

59
0:02:41.315,000 --> 0:02:43,000
They will continue to secure drug donations

60
0:02:43.759,000 --> 0:02:45,000
for additional at-risk populations.

61
0:02:46.982,000 --> 0:02:49,000
They can now do it for less than 25 cents per child per year.

62
0:02:51.12,000 --> 0:02:53,000
Number two: focus on prevention.

63
0:02:53.574,000 --> 0:02:56,000
The END Fund calls in the right partners to educate communities

64
0:02:56.6,000 --> 0:02:57,000
on sanitation and hygiene

65
0:02:58.193,000 --> 0:03:,000
in order to change behaviors around things like hand-washing

66
0:03:01.059,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and latrine use,

67
0:03:02.234,000 --> 0:03:04,000
ensuring people are not continually reinfected.

68
0:03:04.951,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Number three: invest in innovation.

69
0:03:07.684,000 --> 0:03:09,000
The END Fund has contributed to deworming

70
0:03:09.783,000 --> 0:03:13,000
by introducing innovative techniques that effectively target and treat people.

71
0:03:14.047,000 --> 0:03:15,000
They will test new delivery methods,

72
0:03:15.839,000 --> 0:03:17,000
target the environments where parasites thrive

73
0:03:18.055,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and influence behavior change.

74
0:03:19.79,000 --> 0:03:21,000
Number four: monitor and evaluate.

75
0:03:22.527,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The END Fund collects detailed data on all programs on a regular basis

76
0:03:26.346,000 --> 0:03:28,000
to help them get better and better over time.

77
0:03:29.082,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Number five: increase local ownership.

78
0:03:31.948,000 --> 0:03:32,000
At all stages of the process,

79
0:03:33.591,000 --> 0:03:36,000
the END Fund works with government and local stakeholders

80
0:03:36.782,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to encourage cofinancing commitments that support deworming efforts.

81
0:03:40.584,000 --> 0:03:42,000
They also worked with African philanthropists

82
0:03:42.784,000 --> 0:03:44,000
and corporate leaders to partner on these efforts.

83
0:03:45.655,000 --> 0:03:48,000
There's an incredible opportunity to work together to create a new system

84
0:03:49.401,000 --> 0:03:52,000
for disease elimination for the next decade and beyond.

85
0:03:52.647,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Part of the money the END Fund needs

86
0:03:54.426,000 --> 0:03:56,000
will go directly toward delivering deworming treatments

87
0:03:57.051,000 --> 0:03:58,000
to communities that need it

88
0:03:58.473,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and part will go towards facilitating the handover of programs

89
0:04:01.918,000 --> 0:04:02,000
to local ownership.

90
0:04:03.243,000 --> 0:04:06,000
Together, these efforts will create prevention and treatment programs

91
0:04:06.728,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that are sustainable far into the future.

92
0:04:09.338,000 --> 0:04:12,000
If this plan gets fully funded for the next six years,

93
0:04:12.854,000 --> 0:04:15,000
tens of millions of people will receive deworming treatment.

94
0:04:16.883,000 --> 0:04:19,000
With that, countries will be interrupting the cycle of disease transmission

95
0:04:20.629,000 --> 0:04:21,000
at all levels,

96
0:04:21.824,000 --> 0:04:24,000
and most importantly, people will experience significant improvements

97
0:04:25.701,000 --> 0:04:27,000
in their mental, physical and social health.

98
0:04:28.676,000 --> 0:04:3,000
Just imagine the potential that will be gained

99
0:04:31.218,000 --> 0:04:33,000
when people can stop worrying about these

100
0:04:33.661,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and can put their energy into things like these.

101
0:04:37.331,000 --> 0:04:38,000
(Students' overlapping voices)

102
0:04:39.074,000 --> 0:04:42,000
(Clapping and singing)

103
0:04:42.281,000 --> 0:04:44,000
(Cheering)

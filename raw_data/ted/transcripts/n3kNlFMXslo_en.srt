2
0:00:12.902,000 --> 0:00:14,000
When people find out I write about time management,

3
0:00:16.588,000 --> 0:00:17,000
they assume two things.

4
0:00:19.564,000 --> 0:00:21,000
One is that I'm always on time,

5
0:00:23.747,000 --> 0:00:24,000
and I'm not.

6
0:00:25.525,000 --> 0:00:26,000
I have four small children,

7
0:00:26.894,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I would like to blame them for my occasional tardiness,

8
0:00:29.734,000 --> 0:00:31,000
but sometimes it's just not their fault.

9
0:00:32.365,000 --> 0:00:34,000
I was once late to my own speech on time management.

10
0:00:35.136,000 --> 0:00:36,000
(Laughter)

11
0:00:36.2,000 --> 0:00:39,000
We all had to just take a moment together and savor that irony.

12
0:00:40.972,000 --> 0:00:43,000
The second thing they assume is that I have lots of tips and tricks

13
0:00:44.215,000 --> 0:00:45,000
for saving bits of time here and there.

14
0:00:46.132,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Sometimes I'll hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines,

15
0:00:49.87,000 --> 0:00:52,000
generally on how to help their readers find an extra hour in the day.

16
0:00:53.221,000 --> 0:00:56,000
And the idea is that we'll shave bits of time off everyday activities,

17
0:00:56.531,000 --> 0:00:57,000
add it up,

18
0:00:57.732,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and we'll have time for the good stuff.

19
0:00:59.93,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I question the entire premise of this piece, but I'm always interested

20
0:01:03.988,000 --> 0:01:05,000
in hearing what they've come up with before they call me.

21
0:01:06.695,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Some of my favorites:

22
0:01:07.871,000 --> 0:01:09,000
doing errands where you only have to make right-hand turns --

23
0:01:10.801,000 --> 0:01:11,000
(Laughter)

24
0:01:11.853,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Being extremely judicious in microwave usage:

25
0:01:14.023,000 --> 0:01:16,000
it says three to three-and-a-half minutes on the package,

26
0:01:16.77,000 --> 0:01:18,000
we're totally getting in on the bottom side of that.

27
0:01:19.23,000 --> 0:01:21,000
And my personal favorite, which makes sense on some level,

28
0:01:21.993,000 --> 0:01:24,000
is to DVR your favorite shows so you can fast-forward through the commercials.

29
0:01:25.769,000 --> 0:01:27,000
That way, you save eight minutes every half hour,

30
0:01:28.085,000 --> 0:01:3,000
so in the course of two hours of watching TV,

31
0:01:30.206,000 --> 0:01:31,000
you find 32 minutes to exercise.

32
0:01:31.773,000 --> 0:01:32,000
(Laughter)

33
0:01:32.813,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Which is true.

34
0:01:34.587,000 --> 0:01:36,000
You know another way to find 32 minutes to exercise?

35
0:01:37.629,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right?

36
0:01:39.985,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

37
0:01:41.025,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits of time here and there, add it up,

38
0:01:44.523,000 --> 0:01:46,000
we will finally get to everything we want to do.

39
0:01:46.831,000 --> 0:01:48,000
But after studying how successful people spend their time

40
0:01:49.767,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and looking at their schedules hour by hour,

41
0:01:52.428,000 --> 0:01:55,000
I think this idea has it completely backward.

42
0:01:56.305,000 --> 0:01:59,000
We don't build the lives we want by saving time.

43
0:02:00.566,000 --> 0:02:01,000
We build the lives we want,

44
0:02:02.636,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and then time saves itself.

45
0:02:07.194,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Here's what I mean.

46
0:02:08.369,000 --> 0:02:09,000
I recently did a time diary project

47
0:02:10.087,000 --> 0:02:14,000
looking at 1,001 days in the lives of extremely busy women.

48
0:02:14.315,000 --> 0:02:16,000
They had demanding jobs, sometimes their own businesses,

49
0:02:16.983,000 --> 0:02:18,000
kids to care for, maybe parents to care for,

50
0:02:19.142,000 --> 0:02:2,000
community commitments --

51
0:02:20.496,000 --> 0:02:21,000
busy, busy people.

52
0:02:22.799,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I had them keep track of their time for a week

53
0:02:25.03,000 --> 0:02:27,000
so I could add up how much they worked and slept,

54
0:02:27.367,000 --> 0:02:29,000
and I interviewed them about their strategies, for my book.

55
0:02:30.2,000 --> 0:02:31,000
One of the women whose time log I studied

56
0:02:32.213,000 --> 0:02:34,000
goes out on a Wednesday night for something.

57
0:02:34.3,000 --> 0:02:36,000
She comes home to find that her water heater has broken,

58
0:02:36.953,000 --> 0:02:38,000
and there is now water all over her basement.

59
0:02:40.38,000 --> 0:02:42,000
If you've ever had anything like this happen to you,

60
0:02:42.858,000 --> 0:02:44,000
you know it is a hugely damaging, frightening, sopping mess.

61
0:02:45.762,000 --> 0:02:47,000
So she's dealing with the immediate aftermath that night,

62
0:02:48.496,000 --> 0:02:49,000
next day she's got plumbers coming in,

63
0:02:50.397,000 --> 0:02:53,000
day after that, professional cleaning crew dealing with the ruined carpet.

64
0:02:53.921,000 --> 0:02:55,000
All this is being recorded on her time log.

65
0:02:56.011,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Winds up taking seven hours of her week.

66
0:02:59.191,000 --> 0:03:,000
Seven hours.

67
0:03:01.179,000 --> 0:03:03,000
That's like finding an extra hour in the day.

68
0:03:04.834,000 --> 0:03:06,000
But I'm sure if you had asked her at the start of the week,

69
0:03:07.652,000 --> 0:03:1,000
"Could you find seven hours to train for a triathlon?"

70
0:03:11.893,000 --> 0:03:14,000
"Could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people?"

71
0:03:15.722,000 --> 0:03:17,000
I'm sure she would've said what most of us would've said,

72
0:03:18.437,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which is, "No -- can't you see how busy I am?"

73
0:03:23.521,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Yet when she had to find seven hours

74
0:03:25.342,000 --> 0:03:27,000
because there is water all over her basement,

75
0:03:28.165,000 --> 0:03:3,000
she found seven hours.

76
0:03:31.055,000 --> 0:03:35,000
And what this shows us is that time is highly elastic.

77
0:03:35.594,000 --> 0:03:37,000
We cannot make more time,

78
0:03:37.661,000 --> 0:03:41,000
but time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it.

79
0:03:42.366,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And so the key to time management

80
0:03:45.541,000 --> 0:03:47,000
is treating our priorities

81
0:03:47.8,000 --> 0:03:5,000
as the equivalent of that broken water heater.

82
0:03:52.162,000 --> 0:03:53,000
To get at this,

83
0:03:53.336,000 --> 0:03:56,000
I like to use language from one of the busiest people I ever interviewed.

84
0:03:56.805,000 --> 0:03:58,000
By busy, I mean she was running a small business

85
0:03:59.117,000 --> 0:04:,000
with 12 people on the payroll,

86
0:04:00.61,000 --> 0:04:02,000
she had six children in her spare time.

87
0:04:02.657,000 --> 0:04:04,000
I was getting in touch with her to set up an interview

88
0:04:05.299,000 --> 0:04:07,000
on how she "had it all" -- that phrase.

89
0:04:07.819,000 --> 0:04:08,000
I remember it was a Thursday morning,

90
0:04:09.652,000 --> 0:04:11,000
and she was not available to speak with me.

91
0:04:11.683,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Of course, right?

92
0:04:12.863,000 --> 0:04:14,000
But the reason she was unavailable to speak with me

93
0:04:15.306,000 --> 0:04:16,000
is that she was out for a hike,

94
0:04:17.27,000 --> 0:04:19,000
because it was a beautiful spring morning,

95
0:04:19.332,000 --> 0:04:2,000
and she wanted to go for a hike.

96
0:04:20.919,000 --> 0:04:22,000
So of course this makes me even more intrigued,

97
0:04:23.28,000 --> 0:04:26,000
and when I finally do catch up with her, she explains it like this.

98
0:04:26.48,000 --> 0:04:28,000
She says, "Listen Laura, everything I do,

99
0:04:29.592,000 --> 0:04:32,000
every minute I spend, is my choice."

100
0:04:33.83,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And rather than say,

101
0:04:35.005,000 --> 0:04:37,000
"I don't have time to do x, y or z,"

102
0:04:37.893,000 --> 0:04:42,000
she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z because it's not a priority."

103
0:04:43.709,000 --> 0:04:47,000
"I don't have time," often means "It's not a priority."

104
0:04:49.075,000 --> 0:04:51,000
If you think about it, that's really more accurate language.

105
0:04:51.987,000 --> 0:04:53,000
I could tell you I don't have time to dust my blinds,

106
0:04:54.575,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but that's not true.

107
0:04:55.768,000 --> 0:04:57,000
If you offered to pay me $100,000 to dust my blinds,

108
0:04:58.232,000 --> 0:04:59,000
I would get to it pretty quickly.

109
0:04:59.856,000 --> 0:05:,000
(Laughter)

110
0:05:00.896,000 --> 0:05:01,000
Since that is not going to happen,

111
0:05:02.555,000 --> 0:05:04,000
I can acknowledge this is not a matter of lacking time;

112
0:05:05.183,000 --> 0:05:06,000
it's that I don't want to do it.

113
0:05:06.808,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Using this language reminds us that time is a choice.

114
0:05:10.218,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And granted,

115
0:05:11.415,000 --> 0:05:14,000
there may be horrible consequences for making different choices,

116
0:05:14.471,000 --> 0:05:15,000
I will give you that.

117
0:05:15.701,000 --> 0:05:16,000
But we are smart people,

118
0:05:17.347,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and certainly over the long run,

119
0:05:19.229,000 --> 0:05:21,000
we have the power to fill our lives

120
0:05:21.253,000 --> 0:05:23,000
with the things that deserve to be there.

121
0:05:25.204,000 --> 0:05:26,000
So how do we do that?

122
0:05:27.127,000 --> 0:05:28,000
How do we treat our priorities

123
0:05:28.583,000 --> 0:05:3,000
as the equivalent of that broken water heater?

124
0:05:31.531,000 --> 0:05:33,000
Well, first we need to figure out what they are.

125
0:05:33.874,000 --> 0:05:35,000
I want to give you two strategies for thinking about this.

126
0:05:36.652,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The first, on the professional side:

127
0:05:38.434,000 --> 0:05:4,000
I'm sure many people coming up to the end of the year

128
0:05:40.969,000 --> 0:05:42,000
are giving or getting annual performance reviews.

129
0:05:43.316,000 --> 0:05:45,000
You look back over your successes over the year,

130
0:05:45.605,000 --> 0:05:47,000
your "opportunities for growth."

131
0:05:47.674,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And this serves its purpose,

132
0:05:50.221,000 --> 0:05:52,000
but I find it's more effective to do this looking forward.

133
0:05:53.175,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So I want you to pretend it's the end of next year.

134
0:05:56.326,000 --> 0:05:58,000
You're giving yourself a performance review,

135
0:05:58.711,000 --> 0:06:02,000
and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally.

136
0:06:04.034,000 --> 0:06:09,000
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing?

137
0:06:10.734,000 --> 0:06:13,000
So you can write next year's performance review now.

138
0:06:14.558,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And you can do this for your personal life, too.

139
0:06:16.829,000 --> 0:06:18,000
I'm sure many of you, like me, come December,

140
0:06:19.482,000 --> 0:06:22,000
get cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper,

141
0:06:23.491,000 --> 0:06:27,000
on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter.

142
0:06:28.345,000 --> 0:06:29,000
(Laughter)

143
0:06:30.007,000 --> 0:06:32,000
Bit of a wretched genre of literature, really,

144
0:06:32.662,000 --> 0:06:35,000
going on about how amazing everyone in the household is,

145
0:06:35.97,000 --> 0:06:36,000
or even more scintillating,

146
0:06:37.281,000 --> 0:06:39,000
how busy everyone in the household is.

147
0:06:39.815,000 --> 0:06:4,000
But these letters serve a purpose,

148
0:06:41.488,000 --> 0:06:43,000
which is that they tell your friends and family

149
0:06:43.719,000 --> 0:06:46,000
what you did in your personal life that mattered to you over the year.

150
0:06:47.068,000 --> 0:06:48,000
So this year's kind of done,

151
0:06:48.476,000 --> 0:06:5,000
but I want you to pretend it's the end of next year,

152
0:06:50.95,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and it has been an absolutely amazing year

153
0:06:54.172,000 --> 0:06:56,000
for you and the people you care about.

154
0:06:57.391,000 --> 0:07:01,000
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing?

155
0:07:02.839,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So you can write next year's family holiday letter now.

156
0:07:07.789,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Don't send it.

157
0:07:09.006,000 --> 0:07:1,000
(Laughter)

158
0:07:10.046,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Please, don't send it.

159
0:07:13.049,000 --> 0:07:14,000
But you can write it.

160
0:07:14.463,000 --> 0:07:17,000
And now, between the performance review and the family holiday letter,

161
0:07:18.201,000 --> 0:07:21,000
we have a list of six to ten goals we can work on in the next year.

162
0:07:21.462,000 --> 0:07:23,000
And now we need to break these down into doable steps.

163
0:07:24.285,000 --> 0:07:26,000
So maybe you want to write a family history.

164
0:07:26.517,000 --> 0:07:28,000
First, you can read some other family histories,

165
0:07:28.794,000 --> 0:07:29,000
get a sense for the style.

166
0:07:30.08,000 --> 0:07:33,000
Then maybe think about the questions you want to ask your relatives,

167
0:07:33.311,000 --> 0:07:34,000
set up appointments to interview them.

168
0:07:35.184,000 --> 0:07:36,000
Or maybe you want to run a 5K.

169
0:07:36.669,000 --> 0:07:39,000
So you need to find a race and sign up, figure out a training plan,

170
0:07:39.854,000 --> 0:07:41,000
and dig those shoes out of the back of the closet.

171
0:07:42.251,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And then -- this is key --

172
0:07:44.217,000 --> 0:07:48,000
we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater,

173
0:07:48.336,000 --> 0:07:5,000
by putting them into our schedules first.

174
0:07:51.879,000 --> 0:07:55,000
We do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them.

175
0:07:56.663,000 --> 0:07:59,000
I find a really good time to do this is Friday afternoons.

176
0:08:00.885,000 --> 0:08:02,000
Friday afternoon is what an economist might call

177
0:08:03.457,000 --> 0:08:05,000
a "low opportunity cost" time.

178
0:08:06.764,000 --> 0:08:08,000
Most of us are not sitting there on Friday afternoons saying,

179
0:08:09.688,000 --> 0:08:1,000
"I am excited to make progress

180
0:08:11.591,000 --> 0:08:13,000
toward my personal and professional priorities

181
0:08:13.911,000 --> 0:08:14,000
right now."

182
0:08:15.089,000 --> 0:08:16,000
(Laughter)

183
0:08:16.129,000 --> 0:08:18,000
But we are willing to think about what those should be.

184
0:08:18.77,000 --> 0:08:2,000
So take a little bit of time Friday afternoon,

185
0:08:20.999,000 --> 0:08:26,000
make yourself a three-category priority list: career, relationships, self.

186
0:08:28.382,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Making a three-category list reminds us

187
0:08:31.604,000 --> 0:08:34,000
that there should be something in all three categories.

188
0:08:35.118,000 --> 0:08:36,000
Career, we think about;

189
0:08:36.398,000 --> 0:08:37,000
relationships, self --

190
0:08:37.929,000 --> 0:08:38,000
not so much.

191
0:08:39.272,000 --> 0:08:4,000
But anyway, just a short list,

192
0:08:41.194,000 --> 0:08:42,000
two to three items in each.

193
0:08:43.013,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Then look out over the whole of the next week,

194
0:08:45.418,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and see where you can plan them in.

195
0:08:48.171,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Where you plan them in is up to you.

196
0:08:50.205,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others.

197
0:08:53.691,000 --> 0:08:56,000
I mean, some people's lives are just harder than others.

198
0:08:57.674,000 --> 0:09:,000
It is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class

199
0:09:00.967,000 --> 0:09:02,000
if you are caring for multiple children on your own.

200
0:09:04.058,000 --> 0:09:05,000
I get that.

201
0:09:05.253,000 --> 0:09:07,000
And I don't want to minimize anyone's struggle.

202
0:09:07.484,000 --> 0:09:11,000
But I do think that the numbers I am about to tell you are empowering.

203
0:09:12.906,000 --> 0:09:16,000
There are 168 hours in a week.

204
0:09:17.962,000 --> 0:09:21,000
Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours.

205
0:09:23.295,000 --> 0:09:25,000
That is a lot of time.

206
0:09:26.627,000 --> 0:09:29,000
If you are working a full-time job, so 40 hours a week,

207
0:09:29.842,000 --> 0:09:32,000
sleeping eight hours a night, so 56 hours a week --

208
0:09:32.958,000 --> 0:09:34,000
that leaves 72 hours for other things.

209
0:09:36.622,000 --> 0:09:37,000
That is a lot of time.

210
0:09:38.956,000 --> 0:09:39,000
You say you're working 50 hours a week,

211
0:09:40.865,000 --> 0:09:41,000
maybe a main job and a side hustle.

212
0:09:42.835,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Well, that leaves 62 hours for other things.

213
0:09:45.329,000 --> 0:09:46,000
You say you're working 60 hours.

214
0:09:47.253,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Well, that leaves 52 hours for other things.

215
0:09:49.705,000 --> 0:09:51,000
You say you're working more than 60 hours.

216
0:09:51.771,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Well, are you sure?

217
0:09:53.352,000 --> 0:09:54,000
(Laughter)

218
0:09:55.11,000 --> 0:09:57,000
There was once a study comparing people's estimated work weeks

219
0:09:58.04,000 --> 0:09:59,000
with time diaries.

220
0:09:59.459,000 --> 0:10:01,000
They found that people claiming 75-plus-hour work weeks

221
0:10:02.159,000 --> 0:10:04,000
were off by about 25 hours.

222
0:10:04.287,000 --> 0:10:05,000
(Laughter)

223
0:10:06.005,000 --> 0:10:08,000
You can guess in which direction, right?

224
0:10:09.567,000 --> 0:10:11,000
Anyway, in 168 hours a week,

225
0:10:11.804,000 --> 0:10:13,000
I think we can find time for what matters to you.

226
0:10:14.792,000 --> 0:10:16,000
If you want to spend more time with your kids,

227
0:10:17.014,000 --> 0:10:19,000
you want to study more for a test you're taking,

228
0:10:19.343,000 --> 0:10:22,000
you want to exercise for three hours and volunteer for two,

229
0:10:22.712,000 --> 0:10:23,000
you can.

230
0:10:23.89,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And that's even if you're working way more than full-time hours.

231
0:10:27.885,000 --> 0:10:29,000
So we have plenty of time, which is great,

232
0:10:29.961,000 --> 0:10:3,000
because guess what?

233
0:10:31.211,000 --> 0:10:33,000
We don't even need that much time to do amazing things.

234
0:10:34.486,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But when most of us have bits of time, what do we do?

235
0:10:37.708,000 --> 0:10:38,000
Pull out the phone, right?

236
0:10:39.826,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Start deleting emails.

237
0:10:42.381,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Otherwise, we're puttering around the house

238
0:10:44.492,000 --> 0:10:45,000
or watching TV.

239
0:10:46.114,000 --> 0:10:48,000
But small moments can have great power.

240
0:10:49.657,000 --> 0:10:5,000
You can use your bits of time

241
0:10:52.094,000 --> 0:10:54,000
for bits of joy.

242
0:10:55.195,000 --> 0:10:57,000
Maybe it's choosing to read something wonderful on the bus

243
0:10:58.088,000 --> 0:10:59,000
on the way to work.

244
0:10:59.476,000 --> 0:11:01,000
I know when I had a job that required two bus rides

245
0:11:01.899,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and a subway ride every morning,

246
0:11:03.468,000 --> 0:11:05,000
I used to go to the library on weekends to get stuff to read.

247
0:11:06.395,000 --> 0:11:1,000
It made the whole experience almost, almost, enjoyable.

248
0:11:11.857,000 --> 0:11:14,000
Breaks at work can be used for meditating or praying.

249
0:11:15.434,000 --> 0:11:18,000
If family dinner is out because of your crazy work schedule,

250
0:11:18.652,000 --> 0:11:2,000
maybe family breakfast could be a good substitute.

251
0:11:21.89,000 --> 0:11:24,000
It's about looking at the whole of one's time

252
0:11:25.044,000 --> 0:11:27,000
and seeing where the good stuff can go.

253
0:11:28.504,000 --> 0:11:29,000
I truly believe this.

254
0:11:31.054,000 --> 0:11:33,000
There is time.

255
0:11:34.981,000 --> 0:11:35,000
Even if we are busy,

256
0:11:37.223,000 --> 0:11:38,000
we have time for what matters.

257
0:11:39.752,000 --> 0:11:41,000
And when we focus on what matters,

258
0:11:42.312,000 --> 0:11:43,000
we can build the lives we want

259
0:11:44.765,000 --> 0:11:45,000
in the time we've got.

260
0:11:46.638,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Thank you.

261
0:11:47.817,000 --> 0:11:52,000
(Applause)

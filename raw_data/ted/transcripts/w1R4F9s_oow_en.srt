1
0:00:12.76,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Five years ago, I had my dream job.

2
0:00:16.473,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I was a foreign correspondent in the Middle East

3
0:00:18.901,000 --> 0:00:2,000
reporting for ABC News.

4
0:00:21.065,000 --> 0:00:23,000
But there was a crack in the wall,

5
0:00:23.153,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a problem with our industry,

6
0:00:25.559,000 --> 0:00:26,000
that I felt we needed to fix.

7
0:00:28.401,000 --> 0:00:32,000
You see, I got to the Middle East right around the end of 2007,

8
0:00:32.566,000 --> 0:00:34,000
which was just around the midpoint

9
0:00:34.847,000 --> 0:00:35,000
of the Iraq War.

10
0:00:36.571,000 --> 0:00:39,000
But by the time I got there, it was already nearly impossible

11
0:00:40.044,000 --> 0:00:42,000
to find stories about Iraq on air.

12
0:00:43.345,000 --> 0:00:45,000
Coverage had dropped across the board,

13
0:00:45.619,000 --> 0:00:46,000
across networks.

14
0:00:46.956,000 --> 0:00:48,000
And of the stories that did make it,

15
0:00:49.036,000 --> 0:00:52,000
more than 80 percent of them were about us.

16
0:00:52.381,000 --> 0:00:54,000
We were missing the stories about Iraq,

17
0:00:54.958,000 --> 0:00:56,000
the people who live there,

18
0:00:57.075,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and what was happening to them under the weight of the war.

19
0:01:00.874,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Afghanistan had already fallen off the agenda.

20
0:01:04.654,000 --> 0:01:07,000
There were less than one percent of all news stories in 2008

21
0:01:08.319,000 --> 0:01:1,000
that went to the war in Afghanistan.

22
0:01:10.582,000 --> 0:01:12,000
It was the longest war in US history,

23
0:01:13.549,000 --> 0:01:14,000
but information was so scarce

24
0:01:15.535,000 --> 0:01:17,000
that schoolteachers we spoke to

25
0:01:17.794,000 --> 0:01:2,000
told us they had trouble explaining to their students

26
0:01:20.945,000 --> 0:01:21,000
what we were doing there,

27
0:01:22.509,000 --> 0:01:23,000
when those students had parents

28
0:01:24.43,000 --> 0:01:27,000
who were fighting and sometimes dying overseas.

29
0:01:28.997,000 --> 0:01:29,000
We had drawn a blank,

30
0:01:30.685,000 --> 0:01:32,000
and it wasn't just Iraq and Afghanistan.

31
0:01:33.491,000 --> 0:01:35,000
From conflict zones to climate change

32
0:01:36.188,000 --> 0:01:4,000
to all sorts of issues around crises in public health,

33
0:01:40.498,000 --> 0:01:43,000
we were missing what I call the species-level issues,

34
0:01:43.918,000 --> 0:01:46,000
because as a species, they could actually sink us.

35
0:01:47.484,000 --> 0:01:51,000
And by failing to understand the complex issues of our time,

36
0:01:52.227,000 --> 0:01:55,000
we were facing certain practical implications.

37
0:01:55.585,000 --> 0:01:56,000
How were we going to solve problems

38
0:01:57.361,000 --> 0:01:59,000
that we didn't fundamentally understand,

39
0:01:59.656,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that we couldn't track in real time,

40
0:02:01.944,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and where the people working on the issues

41
0:02:04.282,000 --> 0:02:05,000
were invisible to us

42
0:02:05.649,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and sometimes invisible to each other?

43
0:02:09.46,000 --> 0:02:1,000
When you look back on Iraq,

44
0:02:11.468,000 --> 0:02:14,000
those years when we were missing the story,

45
0:02:14.921,000 --> 0:02:16,000
were the years when the society was falling apart,

46
0:02:17.707,000 --> 0:02:2,000
when we were setting the conditions for what would become the rise of ISIS,

47
0:02:21.666,000 --> 0:02:23,000
the ISIS takeover of Mosul

48
0:02:23.852,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and terrorist violence that would spread

49
0:02:25.919,000 --> 0:02:27,000
beyond Iraq's borders to the rest of the world.

50
0:02:29.577,000 --> 0:02:32,000
Just around that time where I was making that observation,

51
0:02:32.908,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I looked across the border of Iraq

52
0:02:34.774,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and noticed there was another story we were missing:

53
0:02:37.837,000 --> 0:02:38,000
the war in Syria.

54
0:02:39.393,000 --> 0:02:43,000
If you were a Middle-East specialist, you knew that Syria was that important

55
0:02:44.133,000 --> 0:02:45,000
from the start.

56
0:02:45.402,000 --> 0:02:46,000
But it ended up being, really,

57
0:02:46.966,000 --> 0:02:48,000
one of the forgotten stories of the Arab Spring.

58
0:02:50.666,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I saw the implications up front.

59
0:02:54.064,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Syria is intimately tied to regional security,

60
0:02:57.455,000 --> 0:02:58,000
to global stability.

61
0:02:59.426,000 --> 0:03:,000
I felt like we couldn't let that become

62
0:03:01.339,000 --> 0:03:03,000
another one of the stories we left behind.

63
0:03:04.322,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So I left my big TV job to start a website, called "Syria Deeply."

64
0:03:10.125,000 --> 0:03:12,000
It was designed to be a news and information source

65
0:03:12.899,000 --> 0:03:15,000
that made it easier to understand a complex issue,

66
0:03:16.272,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and for the past four years, it's been a resource

67
0:03:18.665,000 --> 0:03:22,000
for policymakers and professionals working on the conflict in Syria.

68
0:03:23.76,000 --> 0:03:24,000
We built a business model

69
0:03:25.207,000 --> 0:03:28,000
based on consistent, high-quality information,

70
0:03:28.486,000 --> 0:03:31,000
and convening the top minds on the issue.

71
0:03:32.227,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And we found it was a model that scaled.

72
0:03:35.091,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We got passionate requests to do other things "Deeply."

73
0:03:38.895,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So we started to work our way down the list.

74
0:03:42.987,000 --> 0:03:45,000
I'm just one of many entrepreneurs,

75
0:03:46.013,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and we are just one of many start-ups

76
0:03:48.619,000 --> 0:03:5,000
trying to fix what's wrong with news.

77
0:03:51.504,000 --> 0:03:52,000
All of us in the trenches know

78
0:03:53.474,000 --> 0:03:55,000
that something is wrong with the news industry.

79
0:03:55.973,000 --> 0:03:56,000
It's broken.

80
0:03:58.376,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Trust in the media has hit an all-time low.

81
0:04:01.747,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And the statistic you're seeing up there is from September --

82
0:04:05.166,000 --> 0:04:06,000
it's arguably gotten worse.

83
0:04:07.924,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But we can fix this.

84
0:04:09.42,000 --> 0:04:1,000
We can fix the news.

85
0:04:12.083,000 --> 0:04:13,000
I know that that's true.

86
0:04:13.926,000 --> 0:04:18,000
You can call me an idealist; I call myself an industrious optimist.

87
0:04:19.239,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And I know there are a lot of us out there.

88
0:04:21.788,000 --> 0:04:23,000
We have ideas for how to make things better,

89
0:04:24.204,000 --> 0:04:27,000
and I want to share three of them that we've picked up in our own work.

90
0:04:28.668,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Idea number one:

91
0:04:30.481,000 --> 0:04:33,000
we need news that's built on deep-domain knowledge.

92
0:04:34.168,000 --> 0:04:37,000
Given the waves and waves of layoffs at newsrooms across the country,

93
0:04:37.95,000 --> 0:04:39,000
we've lost the art of specialization.

94
0:04:40.252,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Beat reporting is an endangered thing.

95
0:04:42.959,000 --> 0:04:44,000
When it comes to foreign news,

96
0:04:45.23,000 --> 0:04:48,000
the way we can fix that is by working with more local journalists,

97
0:04:48.415,000 --> 0:04:5,000
treating them like our partners and collaborators,

98
0:04:50.82,000 --> 0:04:53,000
not just fixers who fetch us phone numbers and sound bites.

99
0:04:54.687,000 --> 0:04:58,000
Our local reporters in Syria and across Africa and across Asia

100
0:04:58.927,000 --> 0:05:01,000
bring us stories that we certainly would not have found on our own.

101
0:05:02.938,000 --> 0:05:06,000
Like this one from the suburbs of Damascus, about a wheelchair race

102
0:05:07.178,000 --> 0:05:09,000
that gave hope to those wounded in the war.

103
0:05:10.063,000 --> 0:05:11,000
Or this one from Sierra Leone,

104
0:05:11.96,000 --> 0:05:14,000
about a local chief who curbed the spread of Ebola

105
0:05:15.441,000 --> 0:05:18,000
by self-organizing a quarantine in his district.

106
0:05:19.346,000 --> 0:05:21,000
Or this one from the border of Pakistan,

107
0:05:21.496,000 --> 0:05:24,000
about Afghan refugees being forced to return home before they are ready,

108
0:05:25.449,000 --> 0:05:27,000
under the threat of police intimidation.

109
0:05:28.525,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Our local journalists are our mentors.

110
0:05:30.603,000 --> 0:05:32,000
They teach us something new every day,

111
0:05:32.729,000 --> 0:05:36,000
and they bring us stories that are important for all of us to know.

112
0:05:37.45,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Idea number two:

113
0:05:39.268,000 --> 0:05:42,000
we need a kind of Hippocratic oath for the news industry,

114
0:05:42.931,000 --> 0:05:45,000
a pledge to first do no harm.

115
0:05:46.558,000 --> 0:05:47,000
(Applause)

116
0:05:48.193,000 --> 0:05:49,000
Journalists need to be tough.

117
0:05:49.735,000 --> 0:05:5,000
We need to speak truth to power,

118
0:05:51.671,000 --> 0:05:53,000
but we also need to be responsible.

119
0:05:53.796,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We need to live up to our own ideals,

120
0:05:56.164,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and we need to recognize

121
0:05:58.119,000 --> 0:06:01,000
when what we're doing could potentially harm society,

122
0:06:02.032,000 --> 0:06:05,000
where we lose track of journalism as a public service.

123
0:06:06.173,000 --> 0:06:07,000
I watched us cover the Ebola crisis.

124
0:06:08.172,000 --> 0:06:1,000
We launched Ebola Deeply. We did our best.

125
0:06:10.592,000 --> 0:06:11,000
But what we saw was a public

126
0:06:12.522,000 --> 0:06:15,000
that was flooded with hysterical and sensational coverage,

127
0:06:16.163,000 --> 0:06:19,000
sometimes inaccurate, sometimes completely wrong.

128
0:06:19.332,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Public health experts tell me that that actually cost us in human lives,

129
0:06:23.984,000 --> 0:06:27,000
because by sparking more panic and by sometimes getting the facts wrong,

130
0:06:28.681,000 --> 0:06:3,000
we made it harder for people to resolve

131
0:06:30.877,000 --> 0:06:32,000
what was actually happening on the ground.

132
0:06:32.971,000 --> 0:06:35,000
All that noise made it harder to make the right decisions.

133
0:06:36.88,000 --> 0:06:38,000
We can do better as an industry,

134
0:06:39.081,000 --> 0:06:43,000
but it requires us recognizing how we got it wrong last time,

135
0:06:43.47,000 --> 0:06:45,000
and deciding not to go that way next time.

136
0:06:46.841,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It's a choice.

137
0:06:48.081,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We have to resist the temptation to use fear for ratings.

138
0:06:52.403,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And that decision has to be made in the individual newsroom

139
0:06:55.334,000 --> 0:06:57,000
and with the individual news executive.

140
0:06:57.529,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Because the next deadly virus that comes around

141
0:07:00.208,000 --> 0:07:03,000
could be much worse and the consequences much higher,

142
0:07:04.013,000 --> 0:07:05,000
if we do what we did last time;

143
0:07:05.972,000 --> 0:07:08,000
if our reporting isn't responsible and it isn't right.

144
0:07:11.012,000 --> 0:07:12,000
The third idea?

145
0:07:12.587,000 --> 0:07:14,000
We need to embrace complexity

146
0:07:14.742,000 --> 0:07:16,000
if we want to make sense of a complex world.

147
0:07:17.956,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Embrace complexity --

148
0:07:19.862,000 --> 0:07:2,000
(Applause)

149
0:07:21.363,000 --> 0:07:26,000
not treat the world simplistically, because simple isn't accurate.

150
0:07:26.758,000 --> 0:07:27,000
We live in a complex world.

151
0:07:29.281,000 --> 0:07:3,000
News is adult education.

152
0:07:31.265,000 --> 0:07:34,000
It's our job as journalists to get elbow deep in complexity

153
0:07:34.744,000 --> 0:07:38,000
and to find new ways to make it easier for everyone else to understand.

154
0:07:39.447,000 --> 0:07:4,000
If we don't do that,

155
0:07:40.64,000 --> 0:07:42,000
if we pretend there are just simple answers,

156
0:07:43.474,000 --> 0:07:45,000
we're leading everyone off a steep cliff.

157
0:07:47.144,000 --> 0:07:5,000
Understanding complexity is the only way to know the real threats

158
0:07:50.619,000 --> 0:07:51,000
that are around the corner.

159
0:07:51.976,000 --> 0:07:53,000
It's our responsibility to translate those threats

160
0:07:54.705,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and to help you understand what's real,

161
0:07:56.914,000 --> 0:07:59,000
so you can be prepared and know what it takes to be ready

162
0:08:00.171,000 --> 0:08:01,000
for what comes next.

163
0:08:02.825,000 --> 0:08:03,000
I am an industrious optimist.

164
0:08:04.406,000 --> 0:08:06,000
I do believe we can fix what's broken.

165
0:08:07.498,000 --> 0:08:08,000
We all want to.

166
0:08:08.705,000 --> 0:08:1,000
There are great journalists out there doing great work --

167
0:08:11.513,000 --> 0:08:12,000
we just need new formats.

168
0:08:13.862,000 --> 0:08:16,000
I honestly believe this is a time of reawakening,

169
0:08:17.607,000 --> 0:08:18,000
reimagining what we can do.

170
0:08:19.899,000 --> 0:08:2,000
I believe we can fix what's broken.

171
0:08:22.436,000 --> 0:08:23,000
I know we can fix the news.

172
0:08:24.392,000 --> 0:08:25,000
I know it's worth trying,

173
0:08:26.242,000 --> 0:08:28,000
and I truly believe that in the end,

174
0:08:28.409,000 --> 0:08:29,000
we're going to get this right.

175
0:08:30.051,000 --> 0:08:31,000
Thank you.

176
0:08:31.243,000 --> 0:08:35,000

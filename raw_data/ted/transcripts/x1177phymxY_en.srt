1
0:00:12.667,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm a blogger, a filmmaker and a butcher,

2
0:00:15.866,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and I'll explain how these identities come together.

3
0:00:19.068,000 --> 0:00:2,000
It started four years ago,

4
0:00:20.764,000 --> 0:00:22,000
when a friend and I opened our first Ramadan fast

5
0:00:23.42,000 --> 0:00:25,000
at one of the busiest mosques in New York City.

6
0:00:26.045,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Crowds of men with beards and skullcaps were swarming the streets.

7
0:00:29.943,000 --> 0:00:32,000
It was an FBI agent's wet dream. (Laughter)

8
0:00:33.548,000 --> 0:00:36,000
But being a part of this community, we knew how welcoming this space was.

9
0:00:37.046,000 --> 0:00:4,000
For years, I'd seen photos of this space being documented

10
0:00:40.363,000 --> 0:00:42,000
as a lifeless and cold monolith,

11
0:00:42.47,000 --> 0:00:45,000
much like the stereotypical image painted of the American Muslim experience.

12
0:00:46.181,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Frustrated by this myopic view,

13
0:00:48.474,000 --> 0:00:5,000
my friend and I had this crazy idea:

14
0:00:50.876,000 --> 0:00:53,000
Let's break our fast at a different mosque in a different state

15
0:00:53.877,000 --> 0:00:54,000
each night of Ramadan

16
0:00:55.302,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and share those stories on a blog.

17
0:00:57.454,000 --> 0:00:59,000
We called it "30 Mosques in 30 Days,"

18
0:00:59.734,000 --> 0:01:,000
and we drove to all the 50 states

19
0:01:01.54,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and shared stories from over 100 vastly different Muslim communities,

20
0:01:04.905,000 --> 0:01:07,000
ranging from the Cambodian refugees in the L.A. projects

21
0:01:08.234,000 --> 0:01:11,000
to the black Sufis living in the woods of South Carolina.

22
0:01:11.426,000 --> 0:01:14,000
What emerged was a beautiful and complicated portrait of America.

23
0:01:14.795,000 --> 0:01:16,000
The media coverage forced local journalists

24
0:01:16.82,000 --> 0:01:17,000
to revisit their Muslim communities,

25
0:01:18.557,000 --> 0:01:21,000
but what was really exciting was seeing people from around the world

26
0:01:22.177,000 --> 0:01:25,000
being inspired to take their own 30-mosque journey.

27
0:01:25.184,000 --> 0:01:26,000
There were even these two NFL athletes

28
0:01:27.001,000 --> 0:01:29,000
who took a sabbatical from the league to do so.

29
0:01:29.277,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And as 30 Mosques was blossoming around the world,

30
0:01:32.614,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I was actually stuck in Pakistan working on a film.

31
0:01:35.273,000 --> 0:01:38,000
My codirector, Omar, and I were at a breaking point with many of our friends

32
0:01:38.894,000 --> 0:01:39,000
on how to position the film.

33
0:01:40.559,000 --> 0:01:42,000
The movie is called "These Birds Walk,"

34
0:01:42.646,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and it is about wayward street kids

35
0:01:44.406,000 --> 0:01:46,000
who are struggling to find some semblance of family.

36
0:01:47.242,000 --> 0:01:5,000
We focus on the complexities of youth and family discord,

37
0:01:50.71,000 --> 0:01:53,000
but our friends kept on nudging us to comment on drones and target killings

38
0:01:54.495,000 --> 0:01:56,000
to make the film "more relevant,"

39
0:01:57.304,000 --> 0:02:,000
essentially reducing these people who have entrusted us with their stories

40
0:02:00.81,000 --> 0:02:01,000
into sociopolitical symbols.

41
0:02:02.777,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Of course, we didn't listen to them,

42
0:02:04.553,000 --> 0:02:07,000
and instead, we championed the tender gestures of love

43
0:02:07.973,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and headlong flashes of youth.

44
0:02:10.295,000 --> 0:02:13,000
The agenda behind our cinematic immersion was only empathy,

45
0:02:13.374,000 --> 0:02:15,000
an emotion that's largely deficient from films

46
0:02:15.958,000 --> 0:02:18,000
that come from our region of the world.

47
0:02:19.233,000 --> 0:02:23,000
And as "These Birds Walk" played at film festivals and theaters internationally,

48
0:02:23.46,000 --> 0:02:25,000
I finally had my feet planted at home in New York,

49
0:02:25.943,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and with all the extra time and still no real money,

50
0:02:29.505,000 --> 0:02:32,000
my wife tasked me to cook more for us.

51
0:02:33.19,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And whenever I'd go to the local butcher to purchase some halal meat,

52
0:02:36.577,000 --> 0:02:37,000
something felt off.

53
0:02:37.946,000 --> 0:02:4,000
For those that don't know, halal is a term used for meat

54
0:02:41.313,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that is raised and slaughtered humanely following very strict Islamic guidelines.

55
0:02:45.855,000 --> 0:02:48,000
Unfortunately, the majority of halal meat in America

56
0:02:49.209,000 --> 0:02:51,000
doesn't rise to the standard that my faith calls for.

57
0:02:52.151,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The more I learned about these unethical practices,

58
0:02:54.852,000 --> 0:02:56,000
the more violated I felt,

59
0:02:56.9,000 --> 0:02:59,000
particularly because businesses from my own community

60
0:03:00.092,000 --> 0:03:03,000
were the ones taking advantage of my orthodoxy.

61
0:03:03.211,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So, with emotions running high, and absolutely no experience in butchery,

62
0:03:07.225,000 --> 0:03:09,000
some friends and I opened a meat store

63
0:03:09.474,000 --> 0:03:11,000
in the heart of the East Village fashion district.

64
0:03:12.034,000 --> 0:03:13,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:13.394,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We call it Honest Chops,

66
0:03:15.234,000 --> 0:03:18,000
and we're reclaiming halal by sourcing organic, humanely raised animals,

67
0:03:18.947,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and by making it accessible and affordable to working-class families.

68
0:03:22.668,000 --> 0:03:24,000
There's really nothing like it in America.

69
0:03:24.817,000 --> 0:03:28,000
The unbelievable part is actually that 90 percent of our in-store customers

70
0:03:28.939,000 --> 0:03:29,000
are not even Muslim.

71
0:03:30.479,000 --> 0:03:32,000
For many, it is their first time interacting with Islam

72
0:03:33.206,000 --> 0:03:35,000
on such an intimate level.

73
0:03:35.601,000 --> 0:03:39,000
So all these disparate projects -- (Laughter) --

74
0:03:40.347,000 --> 0:03:42,000
are the result of a restlessness.

75
0:03:42.522,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They are a visceral response to the businesses and curators

76
0:03:46.106,000 --> 0:03:49,000
who work hard to oversimplify my beliefs and my community,

77
0:03:49.625,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and the only way to beat their machine is to play by different rules.

78
0:03:53.79,000 --> 0:03:55,000
We must fight with an inventive approach.

79
0:03:55.976,000 --> 0:03:59,000
With the trust, with the access, with the love that only we can bring,

80
0:04:00.317,000 --> 0:04:02,000
we must unapologetically reclaim our beliefs

81
0:04:02.777,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in every moving image, in every cut of meat,

82
0:04:05.419,000 --> 0:04:09,000
because if we whitewash our stories for the sake of mass appeal,

83
0:04:09.565,000 --> 0:04:1,000
not only will we fail,

84
0:04:11.074,000 --> 0:04:14,000
but we will be trumped by those with more money and more resources

85
0:04:14.401,000 --> 0:04:15,000
to tell our stories.

86
0:04:16.211,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But the call for creative courage is not for novelty or relevance.

87
0:04:20.914,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It is simply because our communities are so damn unique and so damn beautiful.

88
0:04:25.767,000 --> 0:04:31,000
They demand us to find uncompromising ways to be acknowledged and respected.

89
0:04:32.603,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Thank you.

90
0:04:34.358,000 --> 0:04:36,000
(Applause)

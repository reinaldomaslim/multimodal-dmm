1
0:00:12.944,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When I was 14 years old, I was interested in science --

2
0:00:17.339,000 --> 0:00:19,000
fascinated by it, excited to learn about it.

3
0:00:20.479,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And I had a high school science teacher who would say to the class,

4
0:00:24.562,000 --> 0:00:27,000
"The girls don't have to listen to this."

5
0:00:28.8,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Encouraging, yes.

6
0:00:30.229,000 --> 0:00:31,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:31.34,000 --> 0:00:35,000
I chose not to listen -- but to that statement alone.

8
0:00:36.71,000 --> 0:00:39,000
So let me take you to the Andes mountains in Chile,

9
0:00:40.441,000 --> 0:00:44,000
500 kilometers, 300 miles northeast of Santiago.

10
0:00:45.284,000 --> 0:00:49,000
It's very remote, it's very dry and it's very beautiful.

11
0:00:50.087,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And there's not much there.

12
0:00:51.486,000 --> 0:00:53,000
There are condors, there are tarantulas,

13
0:00:54.15,000 --> 0:00:56,000
and at night, when the light dims,

14
0:00:56.671,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it reveals one of the darkest skies on Earth.

15
0:01:00.906,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It's kind of a magic place, the mountain.

16
0:01:03.48,000 --> 0:01:07,000
It's a wonderful combination of very remote mountaintop

17
0:01:07.841,000 --> 0:01:1,000
with exquisitely sophisticated technology.

18
0:01:11.508,000 --> 0:01:14,000
And our ancestors, for as long as there's been recorded history,

19
0:01:15.124,000 --> 0:01:19,000
have looked at the night sky and pondered the nature of our existence.

20
0:01:20.506,000 --> 0:01:22,000
And we're no exception, our generation.

21
0:01:23.536,000 --> 0:01:26,000
The only difficulty is that the night sky now is blocked

22
0:01:26.656,000 --> 0:01:27,000
by the glare of city lights.

23
0:01:29.058,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And so astronomers go to these very remote mountaintops

24
0:01:32.696,000 --> 0:01:33,000
to view and to study the cosmos.

25
0:01:34.981,000 --> 0:01:37,000
So telescopes are our window to the cosmos.

26
0:01:40.042,000 --> 0:01:44,000
It's no exaggeration to say that the Southern Hemisphere is going to be

27
0:01:44.089,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the future of astronomy for the 21st century.

28
0:01:48.135,000 --> 0:01:51,000
We have an array of existing telescopes already,

29
0:01:51.391,000 --> 0:01:53,000
in the Andes mountains in Chile,

30
0:01:53.447,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and that's soon to be joined by a really sensational array of new capability.

31
0:01:58.608,000 --> 0:02:01,000
There will be two international groups that are going to be building

32
0:02:01.831,000 --> 0:02:06,000
giant telescopes, sensitive to optical radiation, as our eyes are.

33
0:02:07.669,000 --> 0:02:08,000
There will be a survey telescope

34
0:02:09.564,000 --> 0:02:12,000
that will be scanning the sky every few nights.

35
0:02:13.366,000 --> 0:02:14,000
There will be radio telescopes,

36
0:02:14.916,000 --> 0:02:17,000
sensitive to long-wavelength radio radiation.

37
0:02:18.448,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And then there will be telescopes in space.

38
0:02:21.587,000 --> 0:02:23,000
There'll be a successor to the Hubble Space Telescope;

39
0:02:24.508,000 --> 0:02:26,000
it's called the James Webb Telescope,

40
0:02:26.569,000 --> 0:02:28,000
and it will be launched in 2018.

41
0:02:29.078,000 --> 0:02:3,000
There'll be a satellite called TESS

42
0:02:30.808,000 --> 0:02:33,000
that will discover planets outside of our solar system.

43
0:02:36.259,000 --> 0:02:38,000
For the last decade, I've been leading a group --

44
0:02:38.913,000 --> 0:02:4,000
a consortium -- international group,

45
0:02:41.154,000 --> 0:02:43,000
to build what will be, when it's finished,

46
0:02:44.161,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the largest optical telescope in existence.

47
0:02:47.489,000 --> 0:02:5,000
It's called the Giant Magellan Telescope, or GMT.

48
0:02:51.748,000 --> 0:02:55,000
This telescope is going to have mirrors that are 8.4 meters in diameter --

49
0:02:56.505,000 --> 0:02:57,000
each of the mirrors.

50
0:02:57.691,000 --> 0:02:58,000
That's almost 27 feet.

51
0:02:59.354,000 --> 0:03:03,000
So it dwarfs this stage -- maybe out to the fourth row in this audience.

52
0:03:03.85,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Each of the seven mirrors in this telescope

53
0:03:06.898,000 --> 0:03:09,000
will be almost 27 feet in diameter.

54
0:03:10.706,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Together, the seven mirrors in this telescope will comprise

55
0:03:14.658,000 --> 0:03:16,000
80 feet in diameter.

56
0:03:16.723,000 --> 0:03:18,000
So, essentially the size of this entire auditorium.

57
0:03:20.448,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The whole telescope will stand about 43 meters high,

58
0:03:24.118,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and again, being in Rio,

59
0:03:26.832,000 --> 0:03:29,000
some of you have been to see the statue of the giant Christ.

60
0:03:30.475,000 --> 0:03:31,000
The scale is comparable in height;

61
0:03:32.328,000 --> 0:03:35,000
in fact, it's smaller than this telescope will be.

62
0:03:36.192,000 --> 0:03:39,000
It's comparable to the size of the Statue of Liberty.

63
0:03:39.721,000 --> 0:03:43,000
And it's going to be housed in an enclosure that's 22 stories --

64
0:03:43.794,000 --> 0:03:44,000
60 meters high.

65
0:03:45.717,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But it's an unusual building to protect this telescope.

66
0:03:48.743,000 --> 0:03:49,000
It will have open windows to the sky,

67
0:03:50.553,000 --> 0:03:52,000
be able to point and look at the sky,

68
0:03:52.925,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and it will actually rotate on a base --

69
0:03:55.577,000 --> 0:03:58,000
2,000 tons of rotating building.

70
0:03:59.719,000 --> 0:04:03,000
The Giant Magellan Telescope will have 10 times the resolution

71
0:04:04.576,000 --> 0:04:05,000
of the Hubble Space Telescope.

72
0:04:06.934,000 --> 0:04:1,000
It will be 20 million times more sensitive than the human eye.

73
0:04:11.593,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And it may, for the first time ever, be capable of finding life on planets

74
0:04:17.753,000 --> 0:04:19,000
outside of our solar system.

75
0:04:20.469,000 --> 0:04:24,000
It's going to allow us to look back at the first light in the universe --

76
0:04:24.866,000 --> 0:04:26,000
literally, the dawn of the cosmos.

77
0:04:27.257,000 --> 0:04:28,000
The cosmic dawn.

78
0:04:29.763,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's a telescope that's going to allow us to peer back,

79
0:04:33.541,000 --> 0:04:36,000
witness galaxies as they were when they were actually assembling,

80
0:04:37.35,000 --> 0:04:4,000
the first black holes in the universe, the first galaxies.

81
0:04:41.69,000 --> 0:04:45,000
Now, for thousands of years, we have been studying the cosmos,

82
0:04:46.322,000 --> 0:04:48,000
we've been wondering about our place in the universe.

83
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:5,000
The ancient Greeks told us

84
0:04:50.689,000 --> 0:04:52,000
that the Earth was the center of the universe.

85
0:04:53.195,000 --> 0:04:56,000
Five hundred years ago, Copernicus displaced the Earth,

86
0:04:56.845,000 --> 0:04:58,000
and put the Sun at the heart of the cosmos.

87
0:05:00.785,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And as we've learned over the centuries,

88
0:05:02.863,000 --> 0:05:04,000
since Galileo Galilei, the Italian scientist,

89
0:05:05.605,000 --> 0:05:1,000
first turned, in that time, a two-inch, very small telescope, to the sky,

90
0:05:10.879,000 --> 0:05:13,000
every time we have built larger telescopes,

91
0:05:13.918,000 --> 0:05:15,000
we have learned something about the universe;

92
0:05:16.141,000 --> 0:05:18,000
we've made discoveries, without exception.

93
0:05:20.908,000 --> 0:05:23,000
We've learned in the 20th century that the universe is expanding

94
0:05:24.669,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and that our own solar system is not at the center of that expansion.

95
0:05:29.757,000 --> 0:05:34,000
We know now that the universe is made of about 100 billion galaxies

96
0:05:35.06,000 --> 0:05:36,000
that are visible to us,

97
0:05:36.734,000 --> 0:05:41,000
and each one of those galaxies has 100 billion stars within it.

98
0:05:43.234,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So we're looking now at the deepest image of the cosmos

99
0:05:46.12,000 --> 0:05:47,000
that's ever been taken.

100
0:05:48.015,000 --> 0:05:5,000
It was taken using the Hubble Space Telescope,

101
0:05:50.857,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and by pointing the telescope at what was previously a blank region of sky,

102
0:05:55.771,000 --> 0:05:56,000
before the launch of Hubble.

103
0:05:57.394,000 --> 0:05:59,000
And if you can imagine this tiny area,

104
0:05:59.681,000 --> 0:06:02,000
it's only one-fiftieth of the size of the full moon.

105
0:06:03.035,000 --> 0:06:05,000
So, if you can imagine the full moon.

106
0:06:05.099,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And there are now 10,000 galaxies visible within that image.

107
0:06:09.782,000 --> 0:06:13,000
And the faintness of those images and the tiny size is only a result

108
0:06:14.484,000 --> 0:06:18,000
of the fact that those galaxies are so far away, the vast distances.

109
0:06:18.915,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And each of those galaxies may contain within it

110
0:06:21.872,000 --> 0:06:26,000
a few billion or even hundreds of billions of individual stars.

111
0:06:27.591,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Telescopes are like time machines.

112
0:06:29.634,000 --> 0:06:33,000
So the farther back we look in space, the further back we see in time.

113
0:06:34.47,000 --> 0:06:37,000
And they're like light buckets -- literally, they collect light.

114
0:06:37.68,000 --> 0:06:4,000
So larger the bucket, the larger the mirror we have,

115
0:06:40.938,000 --> 0:06:43,000
the more light we can see, and the farther back we can view.

116
0:06:45.61,000 --> 0:06:47,000
So, we've learned in the last century

117
0:06:47.905,000 --> 0:06:49,000
that there are exotic objects in the universe -- black holes.

118
0:06:50.863,000 --> 0:06:52,000
We've even learned that there's dark matter and dark energy

119
0:06:53.664,000 --> 0:06:54,000
that we can't see.

120
0:06:55.218,000 --> 0:06:58,000
So you're looking now at an actual image of dark matter.

121
0:06:58.8,000 --> 0:06:59,000
(Laughter)

122
0:06:59.974,000 --> 0:07:01,000
You got it. Not all audiences get that.

123
0:07:02.641,000 --> 0:07:03,000
(Laughter)

124
0:07:04.43,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So the way we infer the presence of dark matter --

125
0:07:07.178,000 --> 0:07:11,000
we can't see it -- but there's an unmistakable tug, due to gravity.

126
0:07:13.302,000 --> 0:07:16,000
We now can look out, we see this sea of galaxies

127
0:07:16.704,000 --> 0:07:17,000
in a universe that's expanding.

128
0:07:18.862,000 --> 0:07:21,000
What I do myself is to measure the expansion of the universe,

129
0:07:22.189,000 --> 0:07:25,000
and one of the projects that I carried out in the 1990s

130
0:07:25.354,000 --> 0:07:3,000
used the Hubble Space Telescope to measure how fast the universe is expanding.

131
0:07:31.356,000 --> 0:07:34,000
We can now trace back to 14 billion years.

132
0:07:35.731,000 --> 0:07:39,000
We've learned over time that stars have individual histories;

133
0:07:40.091,000 --> 0:07:42,000
that is, they have birth, they have middle ages

134
0:07:43.044,000 --> 0:07:45,000
and some of them even have dramatic deaths.

135
0:07:45.829,000 --> 0:07:51,000
So the embers from those stars actually then form the new stars that we see,

136
0:07:51.968,000 --> 0:07:54,000
most of which turn out to have planets going around them.

137
0:07:56.272,000 --> 0:08:,000
And one of the really surprising results in the last 20 years

138
0:08:00.331,000 --> 0:08:04,000
has been the discovery of other planets going around other stars.

139
0:08:04.481,000 --> 0:08:05,000
These are called exoplanets.

140
0:08:06.411,000 --> 0:08:1,000
And until 1995, we didn't even know the existence of any other planets,

141
0:08:11.431,000 --> 0:08:13,000
other than going around our own sun.

142
0:08:14.36,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But now, there are almost 2,000 other planets orbiting other stars

143
0:08:20.805,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that we can now detect, measure masses for.

144
0:08:23.389,000 --> 0:08:26,000
There are 500 of those that are multiple-planet systems.

145
0:08:27.085,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And there are 4,000 -- and still counting -- other candidates

146
0:08:31.069,000 --> 0:08:33,000
for planets orbiting other stars.

147
0:08:33.79,000 --> 0:08:35,000
They come in a bewildering variety of different kinds.

148
0:08:37.134,000 --> 0:08:4,000
There are Jupiter-like planets that are hot,

149
0:08:40.444,000 --> 0:08:44,000
there are other planets that are icy, there are water worlds

150
0:08:44.726,000 --> 0:08:47,000
and there are rocky planets like the Earth, so-called "super-Earths,"

151
0:08:48.004,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and there have even been planets that have been speculated diamond worlds.

152
0:08:53.794,000 --> 0:08:57,000
So we know there's at least one planet, our own Earth, in which there is life.

153
0:08:58.773,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We've even found planets that are orbiting two stars.

154
0:09:02.957,000 --> 0:09:05,000
That's no longer the province of science fiction.

155
0:09:07.211,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So around our own planet, we know there's life,

156
0:09:09.449,000 --> 0:09:14,000
we've developed a complex life, we now can question our own origins.

157
0:09:15.728,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And given all that we've discovered, the overwhelming numbers now suggest

158
0:09:19.972,000 --> 0:09:23,000
that there may be millions, perhaps -- maybe even hundreds of millions --

159
0:09:24.068,000 --> 0:09:26,000
of other [planets] that are close enough --

160
0:09:26.871,000 --> 0:09:29,000
just the right distance from their stars that they're orbiting --

161
0:09:30.185,000 --> 0:09:35,000
to have the existence of liquid water and maybe could potentially support life.

162
0:09:36.121,000 --> 0:09:4,000
So we marvel now at those odds, the overwhelming odds,

163
0:09:40.319,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and the amazing thing is that within the next decade,

164
0:09:43.286,000 --> 0:09:48,000
the GMT may be able to take spectra of the atmospheres of those planets,

165
0:09:48.54,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and determine whether or not they have the potential for life.

166
0:09:53.702,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So, what is the GMT project?

167
0:09:55.506,000 --> 0:09:56,000
It's an international project.

168
0:09:57.404,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It includes Australia, South Korea, and I'm happy to say, being here in Rio,

169
0:10:03.277,000 --> 0:10:06,000
that the newest partner in our telescope is Brazil.

170
0:10:06.825,000 --> 0:10:1,000
(Applause)

171
0:10:11.308,000 --> 0:10:15,000
It also includes a number of institutions across the United States,

172
0:10:16.122,000 --> 0:10:19,000
including Harvard University,

173
0:10:19.242,000 --> 0:10:21,000
the Smithsonian and the Carnegie Institutions,

174
0:10:22.21,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and the Universities of Arizona, Chicago, Texas-Austin and Texas A&M University.

175
0:10:29.074,000 --> 0:10:3,000
It also involves Chile.

176
0:10:32.723,000 --> 0:10:35,000
So, the making of the mirrors in this telescope is also fascinating

177
0:10:35.959,000 --> 0:10:36,000
in its own right.

178
0:10:37.348,000 --> 0:10:41,000
Take chunks of glass, melt them in a furnace that is itself rotating.

179
0:10:42.751,000 --> 0:10:44,000
This happens underneath the football stadium

180
0:10:44.866,000 --> 0:10:46,000
at the University of Arizona.

181
0:10:46.932,000 --> 0:10:48,000
It's tucked away under 52,000 seats.

182
0:10:49.892,000 --> 0:10:5,000
Nobody know it's happening.

183
0:10:51.738,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And there's essentially a rotating cauldron.

184
0:10:55.086,000 --> 0:10:58,000
The mirrors are cast and they're cooled very slowly,

185
0:10:58.145,000 --> 0:11:,000
and then they're polished to an exquisite precision.

186
0:11:01.637,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And so, if you think about the precision of these mirrors,

187
0:11:04.738,000 --> 0:11:08,000
the bumps on the mirror, over the entire 27 feet,

188
0:11:09.315,000 --> 0:11:12,000
amount to less than one-millionth of an inch.

189
0:11:13.018,000 --> 0:11:14,000
So, can you visualize that?

190
0:11:15.089,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Ow!

191
0:11:16.264,000 --> 0:11:17,000
(Laughter)

192
0:11:17.612,000 --> 0:11:23,000
That's one five-thousandths of the width of one of my hairs,

193
0:11:23.907,000 --> 0:11:25,000
over this entire 27 feet.

194
0:11:26.068,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It's a spectacular achievement.

195
0:11:27.962,000 --> 0:11:3,000
It's what allows us to have the precision that we will have.

196
0:11:32.876,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So, what does that precision buy us?

197
0:11:35.843,000 --> 0:11:37,000
So the GMT, if you can imagine --

198
0:11:38.606,000 --> 0:11:42,000
if I were to hold up a coin, which I just happen to have,

199
0:11:43.079,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and I look at the face of that coin, I can see from here

200
0:11:48.094,000 --> 0:11:51,000
the writing on the coin; I can see the face on that coin.

201
0:11:52.103,000 --> 0:11:55,000
My guess that even in the front row, you can't see that.

202
0:11:55.645,000 --> 0:11:57,000
But if we were to turn the Giant Magellan Telescope,

203
0:11:58.531,000 --> 0:12:01,000
all 80-feet diameter that we see in this auditorium,

204
0:12:01.928,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and point it 200 miles away,

205
0:12:05.021,000 --> 0:12:1,000
if I were standing in São Paulo, we could resolve the face of this coin.

206
0:12:10.913,000 --> 0:12:13,000
That's the extraordinary resolution and power of this telescope.

207
0:12:15.761,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And if we were --

208
0:12:18.483,000 --> 0:12:21,000
(Applause)

209
0:12:22.377,000 --> 0:12:26,000
If an astronaut went up to the Moon, a quarter of a million miles away,

210
0:12:27.002,000 --> 0:12:29,000
and lit a candle -- a single candle --

211
0:12:29.942,000 --> 0:12:31,000
then we would be able to detect it, using the GMT.

212
0:12:33.347,000 --> 0:12:34,000
Quite extraordinary.

213
0:12:37.334,000 --> 0:12:42,000
This is a simulated image of a cluster in a nearby galaxy.

214
0:12:43.039,000 --> 0:12:45,000
"Nearby" is astronomical, it's all relative.

215
0:12:45.648,000 --> 0:12:47,000
It's tens of millions of light-years away.

216
0:12:48.175,000 --> 0:12:5,000
This is what this cluster would look like.

217
0:12:50.213,000 --> 0:12:52,000
So look at those four bright objects,

218
0:12:52.405,000 --> 0:12:56,000
and now lets compare it with a camera on the Hubble Space Telescope.

219
0:12:56.436,000 --> 0:12:59,000
You can see faint detail that starts to come through.

220
0:12:59.639,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And now finally -- and look how dramatic this is -- this is what the GMT will see.

221
0:13:05.958,000 --> 0:13:07,000
So, keep your eyes on those bright images again.

222
0:13:08.352,000 --> 0:13:12,000
This is what we see on one of the most powerful existing telescopes on the Earth,

223
0:13:12.794,000 --> 0:13:14,000
and this, again, what the GMT will see.

224
0:13:16.554,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Extraordinary precision.

225
0:13:18.975,000 --> 0:13:19,000
So, where are we?

226
0:13:20.321,000 --> 0:13:23,000
We have now leveled the top of the mountaintop in Chile.

227
0:13:23.527,000 --> 0:13:24,000
We blasted that off.

228
0:13:25.314,000 --> 0:13:27,000
We've tested and polished the first mirror.

229
0:13:28.057,000 --> 0:13:3,000
We've cast the second and the third mirrors.

230
0:13:30.67,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And we're about to cast the fourth mirror.

231
0:13:32.963,000 --> 0:13:33,000
We had a series of reviews this year,

232
0:13:34.874,000 --> 0:13:36,000
international panels that came in and reviewed us,

233
0:13:37.44,000 --> 0:13:39,000
and said, "You're ready to go to construction."

234
0:13:39.995,000 --> 0:13:42,000
And so we plan on building this telescope with the first four mirrors.

235
0:13:43.368,000 --> 0:13:47,000
We want to get on the air quickly, and be taking science data --

236
0:13:47.521,000 --> 0:13:51,000
what we astronomers call "first light," in 2021.

237
0:13:53.031,000 --> 0:13:56,000
And the full telescope will be finished in the middle of the next decade,

238
0:13:56.501,000 --> 0:13:57,000
with all seven mirrors.

239
0:13:58.542,000 --> 0:14:01,000
So we're now poised to look back at the distant universe,

240
0:14:02.124,000 --> 0:14:03,000
the cosmic dawn.

241
0:14:03.804,000 --> 0:14:07,000
We'll be able to study other planets in exquisite detail.

242
0:14:08.424,000 --> 0:14:11,000
But for me, one of the most exciting things about building the GMT

243
0:14:12.185,000 --> 0:14:14,000
is the opportunity to actually discover something

244
0:14:15.039,000 --> 0:14:18,000
that we don't know about -- that we can't even imagine at this point,

245
0:14:18.333,000 --> 0:14:19,000
something completely new.

246
0:14:20.713,000 --> 0:14:23,000
And my hope is that with the construction of this and other facilities,

247
0:14:24.367,000 --> 0:14:29,000
that many young women and men will be inspired to reach for the stars.

248
0:14:30.036,000 --> 0:14:31,000
Thank you very much.

249
0:14:31.332,000 --> 0:14:32,000
Obrigado.

250
0:14:32.831,000 --> 0:14:37,000
(Applause)

251
0:14:38.748,000 --> 0:14:39,000
Bruno Giussani: Thank you, Wendy.

252
0:14:40.374,000 --> 0:14:42,000
Stay with me, because I have a question for you.

253
0:14:42.665,000 --> 0:14:44,000
You mentioned different facilities.

254
0:14:45.086,000 --> 0:14:49,000
So the Magellan Telescope is going up, but also ALMA and others in Chile

255
0:14:49.963,000 --> 0:14:51,000
and elsewhere, including in Hawaii.

256
0:14:52.772,000 --> 0:14:56,000
Is it about cooperation and complementarity, or about competition?

257
0:14:56.872,000 --> 0:14:59,000
I know there's competition in terms of funding, but what about the science?

258
0:15:00.618,000 --> 0:15:03,000
Wendy Freedman: In terms of the science, they're very complementary.

259
0:15:03.859,000 --> 0:15:06,000
The telescopes that are in space, the telescopes on the ground,

260
0:15:06.91,000 --> 0:15:08,000
telescopes with different wavelength capability,

261
0:15:09.364,000 --> 0:15:11,000
telescopes even that are similar, but different instruments --

262
0:15:12.331,000 --> 0:15:15,000
they will all look at different parts of the questions that we're asking.

263
0:15:16.101,000 --> 0:15:19,000
So when we discover other planets, we'll be able to test those observations,

264
0:15:19.752,000 --> 0:15:21,000
we'll be able to measure the atmospheres,

265
0:15:21.864,000 --> 0:15:23,000
be able to look in space with very high resolution.

266
0:15:24.763,000 --> 0:15:25,000
So, they're very complementary.

267
0:15:26.264,000 --> 0:15:28,000
You're right about the funding, we compete;

268
0:15:28.525,000 --> 0:15:3,000
but scientifically, it's very complementary.

269
0:15:31.214,000 --> 0:15:33,000
BG: Wendy, thank you very much for coming to TEDGlobal.

270
0:15:33.891,000 --> 0:15:34,000
WF: Thank you.

271
0:15:35.066,000 --> 0:15:36,000
(Applause)

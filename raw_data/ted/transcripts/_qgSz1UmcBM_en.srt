1
0:00:13.19,000 --> 0:00:17,000
I'd like to introduce you to an emerging area of science,

2
0:00:17.742,000 --> 0:00:2,000
one that is still speculative but hugely exciting,

3
0:00:21.709,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and certainly one that's growing very rapidly.

4
0:00:25.448,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Quantum biology asks a very simple question:

5
0:00:29.52,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Does quantum mechanics --

6
0:00:30.894,000 --> 0:00:33,000
that weird and wonderful and powerful theory

7
0:00:34.22,000 --> 0:00:36,000
of the subatomic world of atoms and molecules

8
0:00:36.932,000 --> 0:00:39,000
that underpins so much of modern physics and chemistry --

9
0:00:40.444,000 --> 0:00:43,000
also play a role inside the living cell?

10
0:00:43.88,000 --> 0:00:47,000
In other words: Are there processes, mechanisms, phenomena

11
0:00:47.983,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in living organisms that can only be explained

12
0:00:51.995,000 --> 0:00:53,000
with a helping hand from quantum mechanics?

13
0:00:55.546,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Now, quantum biology isn't new;

14
0:00:57.207,000 --> 0:00:59,000
it's been around since the early 1930s.

15
0:00:59.928,000 --> 0:01:02,000
But it's only in the last decade or so that careful experiments --

16
0:01:03.667,000 --> 0:01:06,000
in biochemistry labs, using spectroscopy --

17
0:01:07.155,000 --> 0:01:13,000
have shown very clear, firm evidence that there are certain specific mechanisms

18
0:01:14.042,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that require quantum mechanics to explain them.

19
0:01:17.674,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Quantum biology brings together quantum physicists, biochemists,

20
0:01:21.027,000 --> 0:01:24,000
molecular biologists -- it's a very interdisciplinary field.

21
0:01:24.692,000 --> 0:01:27,000
I come from quantum physics, so I'm a nuclear physicist.

22
0:01:28.645,000 --> 0:01:3,000
I've spent more than three decades

23
0:01:30.934,000 --> 0:01:32,000
trying to get my head around quantum mechanics.

24
0:01:33.887,000 --> 0:01:35,000
One of the founders of quantum mechanics, Niels Bohr,

25
0:01:36.404,000 --> 0:01:39,000
said, If you're not astonished by it, then you haven't understood it.

26
0:01:40.237,000 --> 0:01:42,000
So I sort of feel happy that I'm still astonished by it.

27
0:01:43.104,000 --> 0:01:44,000
That's a good thing.

28
0:01:44.873,000 --> 0:01:5,000
But it means I study the very smallest structures in the universe --

29
0:01:51.782,000 --> 0:01:53,000
the building blocks of reality.

30
0:01:53.881,000 --> 0:01:56,000
If we think about the scale of size,

31
0:01:57.12,000 --> 0:01:59,000
start with an everyday object like the tennis ball,

32
0:02:00.096,000 --> 0:02:02,000
and just go down orders of magnitude in size --

33
0:02:03.021,000 --> 0:02:08,000
from the eye of a needle down to a cell, down to a bacterium, down to an enzyme --

34
0:02:08.242,000 --> 0:02:09,000
you eventually reach the nano-world.

35
0:02:09.995,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now, nanotechnology may be a term you've heard of.

36
0:02:12.841,000 --> 0:02:14,000
A nanometer is a billionth of a meter.

37
0:02:16.56,000 --> 0:02:2,000
My area is the atomic nucleus, which is the tiny dot inside an atom.

38
0:02:20.954,000 --> 0:02:21,000
It's even smaller in scale.

39
0:02:22.91,000 --> 0:02:23,000
This is the domain of quantum mechanics,

40
0:02:24.852,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and physicists and chemists have had a long time

41
0:02:27.392,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to try and get used to it.

42
0:02:29.248,000 --> 0:02:33,000
Biologists, on the other hand, have got off lightly, in my view.

43
0:02:34.071,000 --> 0:02:38,000
They are very happy with their balls-and-sticks models of molecules.

44
0:02:38.426,000 --> 0:02:39,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:39.532,000 --> 0:02:42,000
The balls are the atoms, the sticks are the bonds between the atoms.

46
0:02:42.754,000 --> 0:02:44,000
And when they can't build them physically in the lab,

47
0:02:45.272,000 --> 0:02:47,000
nowadays, they have very powerful computers

48
0:02:47.688,000 --> 0:02:48,000
that will simulate a huge molecule.

49
0:02:49.679,000 --> 0:02:52,000
This is a protein made up of 100,000 atoms.

50
0:02:54.003,000 --> 0:02:58,000
It doesn't really require much in the way of quantum mechanics to explain it.

51
0:02:59.695,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Quantum mechanics was developed in the 1920s.

52
0:03:02.965,000 --> 0:03:08,000
It is a set of beautiful and powerful mathematical rules and ideas

53
0:03:09.869,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that explain the world of the very small.

54
0:03:12.501,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And it's a world that's very different from our everyday world,

55
0:03:15.897,000 --> 0:03:16,000
made up of trillions of atoms.

56
0:03:17.44,000 --> 0:03:2,000
It's a world built on probability and chance.

57
0:03:21.818,000 --> 0:03:22,000
It's a fuzzy world.

58
0:03:23.144,000 --> 0:03:24,000
It's a world of phantoms,

59
0:03:24.898,000 --> 0:03:27,000
where particles can also behave like spread-out waves.

60
0:03:30.157,000 --> 0:03:32,000
If we imagine quantum mechanics or quantum physics, then,

61
0:03:33.043,000 --> 0:03:38,000
as the fundamental foundation of reality itself,

62
0:03:38.281,000 --> 0:03:39,000
then it's not surprising that we say

63
0:03:40.035,000 --> 0:03:42,000
quantum physics underpins organic chemistry.

64
0:03:42.479,000 --> 0:03:44,000
After all, it gives us the rules that tell us

65
0:03:44.623,000 --> 0:03:46,000
how the atoms fit together to make organic molecules.

66
0:03:47.288,000 --> 0:03:5,000
Organic chemistry, scaled up in complexity,

67
0:03:50.551,000 --> 0:03:53,000
gives us molecular biology, which of course leads to life itself.

68
0:03:54.174,000 --> 0:03:55,000
So in a way, it's sort of not surprising.

69
0:03:56.175,000 --> 0:03:57,000
It's almost trivial.

70
0:03:57.413,000 --> 0:04:01,000
You say, "Well, of course life ultimately must depend of quantum mechanics."

71
0:04:02.141,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But so does everything else.

72
0:04:04.555,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So does all inanimate matter, made up of trillions of atoms.

73
0:04:08.501,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Ultimately, there's a quantum level

74
0:04:13.403,000 --> 0:04:15,000
where we have to delve into this weirdness.

75
0:04:15.61,000 --> 0:04:17,000
But in everyday life, we can forget about it.

76
0:04:18.404,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Because once you put together trillions of atoms,

77
0:04:21.627,000 --> 0:04:23,000
that quantum weirdness just dissolves away.

78
0:04:27.288,000 --> 0:04:29,000
Quantum biology isn't about this.

79
0:04:29.881,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Quantum biology isn't this obvious.

80
0:04:32.461,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Of course quantum mechanics underpins life at some molecular level.

81
0:04:37.254,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Quantum biology is about looking for the non-trivial --

82
0:04:43.282,000 --> 0:04:47,000
the counterintuitive ideas in quantum mechanics --

83
0:04:47.782,000 --> 0:04:5,000
and to see if they do, indeed, play an important role

84
0:04:50.821,000 --> 0:04:52,000
in describing the processes of life.

85
0:04:54.653,000 --> 0:04:59,000
Here is my perfect example of the counterintuitiveness

86
0:04:59.897,000 --> 0:05:,000
of the quantum world.

87
0:05:01.367,000 --> 0:05:02,000
This is the quantum skier.

88
0:05:02.642,000 --> 0:05:04,000
He seems to be intact, he seems to be perfectly healthy,

89
0:05:05.306,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and yet, he seems to have gone around both sides of that tree at the same time.

90
0:05:09.457,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Well, if you saw tracks like that

91
0:05:11.144,000 --> 0:05:13,000
you'd guess it was some sort of stunt, of course.

92
0:05:13.477,000 --> 0:05:15,000
But in the quantum world, this happens all the time.

93
0:05:16.864,000 --> 0:05:19,000
Particles can multitask, they can be in two places at once.

94
0:05:19.914,000 --> 0:05:21,000
They can do more than one thing at the same time.

95
0:05:22.266,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Particles can behave like spread-out waves.

96
0:05:25.298,000 --> 0:05:26,000
It's almost like magic.

97
0:05:27.538,000 --> 0:05:29,000
Physicists and chemists have had nearly a century

98
0:05:30.311,000 --> 0:05:32,000
of trying to get used to this weirdness.

99
0:05:33.445,000 --> 0:05:34,000
I don't blame the biologists

100
0:05:34.819,000 --> 0:05:36,000
for not having to or wanting to learn quantum mechanics.

101
0:05:37.478,000 --> 0:05:4,000
You see, this weirdness is very delicate;

102
0:05:40.7,000 --> 0:05:44,000
and we physicists work very hard to maintain it in our labs.

103
0:05:45.174,000 --> 0:05:49,000
We cool our system down to near absolute zero,

104
0:05:49.402,000 --> 0:05:5,000
we carry out our experiments in vacuums,

105
0:05:51.371,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we try and isolate it from any external disturbance.

106
0:05:55.602,000 --> 0:06:,000
That's very different from the warm, messy, noisy environment of a living cell.

107
0:06:01.96,000 --> 0:06:03,000
Biology itself, if you think of molecular biology,

108
0:06:04.771,000 --> 0:06:07,000
seems to have done very well in describing all the processes of life

109
0:06:08.252,000 --> 0:06:1,000
in terms of chemistry -- chemical reactions.

110
0:06:10.762,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And these are reductionist, deterministic chemical reactions,

111
0:06:15.636,000 --> 0:06:2,000
showing that, essentially, life is made of the same stuff as everything else,

112
0:06:20.774,000 --> 0:06:23,000
and if we can forget about quantum mechanics in the macro world,

113
0:06:23.858,000 --> 0:06:26,000
then we should be able to forget about it in biology, as well.

114
0:06:27.706,000 --> 0:06:3,000
Well, one man begged to differ with this idea.

115
0:06:32.062,000 --> 0:06:35,000
Erwin Schrödinger, of Schrödinger's Cat fame,

116
0:06:35.555,000 --> 0:06:36,000
was an Austrian physicist.

117
0:06:36.896,000 --> 0:06:39,000
He was one of the founders of quantum mechanics in the 1920s.

118
0:06:40.663,000 --> 0:06:42,000
In 1944, he wrote a book called "What is Life?"

119
0:06:43.839,000 --> 0:06:44,000
It was tremendously influential.

120
0:06:45.594,000 --> 0:06:47,000
It influenced Francis Crick and James Watson,

121
0:06:48.499,000 --> 0:06:5,000
the discoverers of the double-helix structure of DNA.

122
0:06:51.343,000 --> 0:06:54,000
To paraphrase a description in the book, he says:

123
0:06:55.035,000 --> 0:07:,000
At the molecular level, living organisms have a certain order,

124
0:07:00.845,000 --> 0:07:03,000
a structure to them that's very different

125
0:07:04.101,000 --> 0:07:08,000
from the random thermodynamic jostling of atoms and molecules

126
0:07:08.861,000 --> 0:07:11,000
in inanimate matter of the same complexity.

127
0:07:13.504,000 --> 0:07:18,000
In fact, living matter seems to behave in this order, in a structure,

128
0:07:18.542,000 --> 0:07:21,000
just like inanimate matter cooled down to near absolute zero,

129
0:07:22.4,000 --> 0:07:25,000
where quantum effects play a very important role.

130
0:07:26.28,000 --> 0:07:3,000
There's something special about the structure -- the order --

131
0:07:30.464,000 --> 0:07:31,000
inside a living cell.

132
0:07:32.048,000 --> 0:07:37,000
So, Schrödinger speculated that maybe quantum mechanics plays a role in life.

133
0:07:38.096,000 --> 0:07:41,000
It's a very speculative, far-reaching idea,

134
0:07:41.545,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and it didn't really go very far.

135
0:07:45.536,000 --> 0:07:46,000
But as I mentioned at the start,

136
0:07:47.093,000 --> 0:07:49,000
in the last 10 years, there have been experiments emerging,

137
0:07:49.916,000 --> 0:07:53,000
showing where some of these certain phenomena in biology

138
0:07:53.995,000 --> 0:07:54,000
do seem to require quantum mechanics.

139
0:07:55.782,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I want to share with you just a few of the exciting ones.

140
0:08:00.215,000 --> 0:08:03,000
This is one of the best-known phenomena in the quantum world,

141
0:08:03.946,000 --> 0:08:04,000
quantum tunneling.

142
0:08:05.671,000 --> 0:08:09,000
The box on the left shows the wavelike, spread-out distribution

143
0:08:10.084,000 --> 0:08:12,000
of a quantum entity -- a particle, like an electron,

144
0:08:12.869,000 --> 0:08:15,000
which is not a little ball bouncing off a wall.

145
0:08:16.53,000 --> 0:08:2,000
It's a wave that has a certain probability of being able to permeate

146
0:08:21.293,000 --> 0:08:24,000
through a solid wall, like a phantom leaping through to the other side.

147
0:08:24.723,000 --> 0:08:28,000
You can see a faint smudge of light in the right-hand box.

148
0:08:29.773,000 --> 0:08:33,000
Quantum tunneling suggests that a particle can hit an impenetrable barrier,

149
0:08:34.409,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and yet somehow, as though by magic,

150
0:08:36.893,000 --> 0:08:38,000
disappear from one side and reappear on the other.

151
0:08:39.658,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The nicest way of explaining it is if you want to throw a ball over a wall,

152
0:08:43.933,000 --> 0:08:46,000
you have to give it enough energy to get over the top of the wall.

153
0:08:47.534,000 --> 0:08:5,000
In the quantum world, you don't have to throw it over the wall,

154
0:08:50.616,000 --> 0:08:53,000
you can throw it at the wall, and there's a certain non-zero probability

155
0:08:54.047,000 --> 0:08:57,000
that it'll disappear on your side, and reappear on the other.

156
0:08:57.394,000 --> 0:08:58,000
This isn't speculation, by the way.

157
0:08:59.096,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We're happy -- well, "happy" is not the right word --

158
0:09:02.516,000 --> 0:09:04,000
(Laughter)

159
0:09:04.585,000 --> 0:09:05,000
we are familiar with this.

160
0:09:06.227,000 --> 0:09:08,000
(Laughter)

161
0:09:08.996,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Quantum tunneling takes place all the time;

162
0:09:11.314,000 --> 0:09:13,000
in fact, it's the reason our Sun shines.

163
0:09:14.655,000 --> 0:09:15,000
The particles fuse together,

164
0:09:16.188,000 --> 0:09:19,000
and the Sun turns hydrogen into helium through quantum tunneling.

165
0:09:21.464,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Back in the 70s and 80s, it was discovered that quantum tunneling also takes place

166
0:09:26.708,000 --> 0:09:27,000
inside living cells.

167
0:09:28.29,000 --> 0:09:34,000
Enzymes, those workhorses of life, the catalysts of chemical reactions --

168
0:09:34.58,000 --> 0:09:38,000
enzymes are biomolecules that speed up chemical reactions in living cells,

169
0:09:38.77,000 --> 0:09:39,000
by many, many orders of magnitude.

170
0:09:40.497,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And it's always been a mystery how they do this.

171
0:09:43.65,000 --> 0:09:44,000
Well, it was discovered

172
0:09:44.863,000 --> 0:09:48,000
that one of the tricks that enzymes have evolved to make use of,

173
0:09:49.739,000 --> 0:09:54,000
is by transferring subatomic particles, like electrons and indeed protons,

174
0:09:54.991,000 --> 0:09:58,000
from one part of a molecule to another via quantum tunneling.

175
0:10:00.333,000 --> 0:10:02,000
It's efficient, it's fast, it can disappear --

176
0:10:03.208,000 --> 0:10:06,000
a proton can disappear from one place, and reappear on the other.

177
0:10:06.343,000 --> 0:10:07,000
Enzymes help this take place.

178
0:10:08.548,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This is research that's been carried out back in the 80s,

179
0:10:11.255,000 --> 0:10:15,000
particularly by a group in Berkeley, Judith Klinman.

180
0:10:15.316,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Other groups in the UK have now also confirmed

181
0:10:17.545,000 --> 0:10:18,000
that enzymes really do this.

182
0:10:21.048,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Research carried out by my group --

183
0:10:23.621,000 --> 0:10:25,000
so as I mentioned, I'm a nuclear physicist,

184
0:10:26.079,000 --> 0:10:29,000
but I've realized I've got these tools of using quantum mechanics

185
0:10:29.158,000 --> 0:10:34,000
in atomic nuclei, and so can apply those tools in other areas as well.

186
0:10:35.404,000 --> 0:10:36,000
One question we asked

187
0:10:37.238,000 --> 0:10:41,000
is whether quantum tunneling plays a role in mutations in DNA.

188
0:10:41.843,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Again, this is not a new idea; it goes all the way back to the early 60s.

189
0:10:45.527,000 --> 0:10:47,000
The two strands of DNA, the double-helix structure,

190
0:10:48.512,000 --> 0:10:5,000
are held together by rungs; it's like a twisted ladder.

191
0:10:51.359,000 --> 0:10:54,000
And those rungs of the ladder are hydrogen bonds --

192
0:10:54.89,000 --> 0:10:57,000
protons, that act as the glue between the two strands.

193
0:10:58.704,000 --> 0:11:02,000
So if you zoom in, what they're doing is holding these large molecules --

194
0:11:03.478,000 --> 0:11:04,000
nucleotides -- together.

195
0:11:06.13,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Zoom in a bit more.

196
0:11:07.304,000 --> 0:11:08,000
So, this a computer simulation.

197
0:11:09.855,000 --> 0:11:12,000
The two white balls in the middle are protons,

198
0:11:13.421,000 --> 0:11:15,000
and you can see that it's a double hydrogen bond.

199
0:11:15.744,000 --> 0:11:18,000
One prefers to sit on one side; the other, on the other side

200
0:11:19.082,000 --> 0:11:23,000
of the two strands of the vertical lines going down, which you can't see.

201
0:11:24.41,000 --> 0:11:27,000
It can happen that these two protons can hop over.

202
0:11:27.829,000 --> 0:11:28,000
Watch the two white balls.

203
0:11:29.748,000 --> 0:11:3,000
They can jump over to the other side.

204
0:11:32.239,000 --> 0:11:37,000
If the two strands of DNA then separate, leading to the process of replication,

205
0:11:37.909,000 --> 0:11:4,000
and the two protons are in the wrong positions,

206
0:11:41.132,000 --> 0:11:42,000
this can lead to a mutation.

207
0:11:43.204,000 --> 0:11:44,000
This has been known for half a century.

208
0:11:45.1,000 --> 0:11:47,000
The question is: How likely are they to do that,

209
0:11:47.467,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and if they do, how do they do it?

210
0:11:49.869,000 --> 0:11:52,000
Do they jump across, like the ball going over the wall?

211
0:11:52.912,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Or can they quantum-tunnel across, even if they don't have enough energy?

212
0:11:57.089,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Early indications suggest that quantum tunneling can play a role here.

213
0:12:01.365,000 --> 0:12:03,000
We still don't know yet how important it is;

214
0:12:03.513,000 --> 0:12:04,000
this is still an open question.

215
0:12:06.199,000 --> 0:12:07,000
It's speculative,

216
0:12:07.373,000 --> 0:12:09,000
but it's one of those questions that is so important

217
0:12:10.04,000 --> 0:12:12,000
that if quantum mechanics plays a role in mutations,

218
0:12:12.51,000 --> 0:12:14,000
surely this must have big implications,

219
0:12:14.833,000 --> 0:12:16,000
to understand certain types of mutations,

220
0:12:17.551,000 --> 0:12:2,000
possibly even those that lead to turning a cell cancerous.

221
0:12:22.803,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Another example of quantum mechanics in biology is quantum coherence,

222
0:12:28.126,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in one of the most important processes in biology,

223
0:12:30.503,000 --> 0:12:33,000
photosynthesis: plants and bacteria taking sunlight,

224
0:12:34.468,000 --> 0:12:36,000
and using that energy to create biomass.

225
0:12:38.215,000 --> 0:12:42,000
Quantum coherence is the idea of quantum entities multitasking.

226
0:12:42.912,000 --> 0:12:43,000
It's the quantum skier.

227
0:12:44.54,000 --> 0:12:46,000
It's an object that behaves like a wave,

228
0:12:47.516,000 --> 0:12:49,000
so that it doesn't just move in one direction or the other,

229
0:12:50.442,000 --> 0:12:53,000
but can follow multiple pathways at the same time.

230
0:12:54.708,000 --> 0:12:57,000
Some years ago, the world of science was shocked

231
0:12:58.648,000 --> 0:13:01,000
when a paper was published showing experimental evidence

232
0:13:02.256,000 --> 0:13:05,000
that quantum coherence takes place inside bacteria,

233
0:13:06.056,000 --> 0:13:07,000
carrying out photosynthesis.

234
0:13:07.766,000 --> 0:13:1,000
The idea is that the photon, the particle of light, the sunlight,

235
0:13:10.854,000 --> 0:13:13,000
the quantum of light captured by a chlorophyll molecule,

236
0:13:14.222,000 --> 0:13:16,000
is then delivered to what's called the reaction center,

237
0:13:16.837,000 --> 0:13:18,000
where it can be turned into chemical energy.

238
0:13:18.925,000 --> 0:13:2,000
And in getting there, it doesn't just follow one route;

239
0:13:21.597,000 --> 0:13:23,000
it follows multiple pathways at once,

240
0:13:23.836,000 --> 0:13:27,000
to optimize the most efficient way of reaching the reaction center

241
0:13:28.197,000 --> 0:13:29,000
without dissipating as waste heat.

242
0:13:31.228,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Quantum coherence taking place inside a living cell.

243
0:13:34.561,000 --> 0:13:36,000
A remarkable idea,

244
0:13:36.705,000 --> 0:13:42,000
and yet evidence is growing almost weekly, with new papers coming out,

245
0:13:42.964,000 --> 0:13:44,000
confirming that this does indeed take place.

246
0:13:45.555,000 --> 0:13:49,000
My third and final example is the most beautiful, wonderful idea.

247
0:13:50.318,000 --> 0:13:54,000
It's also still very speculative, but I have to share it with you.

248
0:13:54.405,000 --> 0:13:58,000
The European robin migrates from Scandinavia

249
0:13:59.041,000 --> 0:14:01,000
down to the Mediterranean, every autumn,

250
0:14:01.7,000 --> 0:14:04,000
and like a lot of other marine animals and even insects,

251
0:14:05.097,000 --> 0:14:09,000
they navigate by sensing the Earth's magnetic field.

252
0:14:10.968,000 --> 0:14:12,000
Now, the Earth's magnetic field is very, very weak;

253
0:14:13.419,000 --> 0:14:15,000
it's 100 times weaker than a fridge magnet,

254
0:14:15.523,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and yet it affects the chemistry -- somehow -- within a living organism.

255
0:14:21.932,000 --> 0:14:24,000
That's not in doubt -- a German couple of ornithologists,

256
0:14:25.762,000 --> 0:14:29,000
Wolfgang and Roswitha Wiltschko, in the 1970s, confirmed that indeed,

257
0:14:30.046,000 --> 0:14:33,000
the robin does find its way by somehow sensing the Earth's magnetic field,

258
0:14:34.047,000 --> 0:14:37,000
to give it directional information -- a built-in compass.

259
0:14:37.398,000 --> 0:14:39,000
The puzzle, the mystery was: How does it do it?

260
0:14:40.351,000 --> 0:14:43,000
Well, the only theory in town --

261
0:14:43.405,000 --> 0:14:46,000
we don't know if it's the correct theory, but the only theory in town --

262
0:14:46.865,000 --> 0:14:48,000
is that it does it via something called quantum entanglement.

263
0:14:50.567,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Inside the robin's retina --

264
0:14:52.965,000 --> 0:14:56,000
I kid you not -- inside the robin's retina is a protein called cryptochrome,

265
0:14:57.221,000 --> 0:14:58,000
which is light-sensitive.

266
0:14:58.625,000 --> 0:15:01,000
Within cryptochrome, a pair of electrons are quantum-entangled.

267
0:15:02.588,000 --> 0:15:05,000
Now, quantum entanglement is when two particles are far apart,

268
0:15:05.844,000 --> 0:15:07,000
and yet somehow remain in contact with each other.

269
0:15:08.991,000 --> 0:15:09,000
Even Einstein hated this idea;

270
0:15:10.461,000 --> 0:15:12,000
he called it "spooky action at a distance."

271
0:15:12.524,000 --> 0:15:13,000
(Laughter)

272
0:15:14.429,000 --> 0:15:17,000
So if Einstein doesn't like it, then we can all be uncomfortable with it.

273
0:15:17.896,000 --> 0:15:19,000
Two quantum-entangled electrons within a single molecule

274
0:15:20.773,000 --> 0:15:21,000
dance a delicate dance

275
0:15:22.268,000 --> 0:15:24,000
that is very sensitive to the direction the bird flies

276
0:15:24.833,000 --> 0:15:25,000
in the Earth's magnetic field.

277
0:15:26.848,000 --> 0:15:28,000
We don't know if it's the correct explanation,

278
0:15:29.482,000 --> 0:15:33,000
but wow, wouldn't it be exciting if quantum mechanics helps birds navigate?

279
0:15:35.069,000 --> 0:15:37,000
Quantum biology is still in it infancy.

280
0:15:37.814,000 --> 0:15:4,000
It's still speculative.

281
0:15:41.742,000 --> 0:15:44,000
But I believe it's built on solid science.

282
0:15:45.917,000 --> 0:15:48,000
I also think that in the coming decade or so,

283
0:15:49.75,000 --> 0:15:53,000
we're going to start to see that actually, it pervades life --

284
0:15:54.615,000 --> 0:15:58,000
that life has evolved tricks that utilize the quantum world.

285
0:16:00.026,000 --> 0:16:01,000
Watch this space.

286
0:16:01.478,000 --> 0:16:02,000
Thank you.

287
0:16:02.659,000 --> 0:16:04,000
(Applause)

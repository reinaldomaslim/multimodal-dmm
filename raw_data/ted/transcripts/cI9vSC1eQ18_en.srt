1
0:00:13.119,000 --> 0:00:16,000
So in 1781, an English composer,

2
0:00:16.59,000 --> 0:00:19,000
technologist and astronomer called William Herschel

3
0:00:19.729,000 --> 0:00:2,000
noticed an object on the sky that

4
0:00:21.472,000 --> 0:00:23,000
didn't quite move the way the rest of the stars did.

5
0:00:24.34,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And Herschel's recognition that something was different,

6
0:00:27.434,000 --> 0:00:28,000
that something wasn't quite right,

7
0:00:29.301,000 --> 0:00:3,000
was the discovery of a planet,

8
0:00:31.123,000 --> 0:00:33,000
the planet Uranus,

9
0:00:33.2,000 --> 0:00:34,000
a name that has entertained

10
0:00:34.555,000 --> 0:00:37,000
countless generations of children,

11
0:00:37.715,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but a planet that overnight

12
0:00:40.05,000 --> 0:00:42,000
doubled the size of our known solar system.

13
0:00:42.666,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Just last month, NASA announced the discovery

14
0:00:44.521,000 --> 0:00:46,000
of 517 new planets

15
0:00:46.85,000 --> 0:00:48,000
in orbit around nearby stars,

16
0:00:48.976,000 --> 0:00:5,000
almost doubling overnight the number of planets

17
0:00:51.227,000 --> 0:00:53,000
we know about within our galaxy.

18
0:00:53.825,000 --> 0:00:55,000
So astronomy is constantly being transformed by this

19
0:00:56.457,000 --> 0:00:58,000
capacity to collect data,

20
0:00:58.595,000 --> 0:01:,000
and with data almost doubling every year,

21
0:01:01.14,000 --> 0:01:02,000
within the next two decades, me may even

22
0:01:02.948,000 --> 0:01:04,000
reach the point for the first time in history

23
0:01:05.266,000 --> 0:01:07,000
where we've discovered the majority of the galaxies

24
0:01:08.12,000 --> 0:01:09,000
within the universe.

25
0:01:09.844,000 --> 0:01:11,000
But as we enter this era of big data,

26
0:01:12.128,000 --> 0:01:13,000
what we're beginning to find is there's a difference

27
0:01:14.108,000 --> 0:01:17,000
between more data being just better

28
0:01:17.269,000 --> 0:01:18,000
and more data being different,

29
0:01:19.249,000 --> 0:01:21,000
capable of changing the questions we want to ask,

30
0:01:22.14,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and this difference is not about how much data we collect,

31
0:01:25.46,000 --> 0:01:26,000
it's whether those data open new windows

32
0:01:27.149,000 --> 0:01:28,000
into our universe,

33
0:01:28.527,000 --> 0:01:3,000
whether they change the way we view the sky.

34
0:01:31.412,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So what is the next window into our universe?

35
0:01:34.851,000 --> 0:01:36,000
What is the next chapter for astronomy?

36
0:01:37.642,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Well, I'm going to show you some of the tools and the technologies

37
0:01:40.297,000 --> 0:01:42,000
that we're going to develop over the next decade,

38
0:01:42.861,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and how these technologies,

39
0:01:44.334,000 --> 0:01:45,000
together with the smart use of data,

40
0:01:46.202,000 --> 0:01:48,000
may once again transform astronomy

41
0:01:49.172,000 --> 0:01:51,000
by opening up a window into our universe,

42
0:01:51.219,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the window of time.

43
0:01:53,000 --> 0:01:55,000
Why time? Well, time is about origins,

44
0:01:55.584,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and it's about evolution.

45
0:01:57.474,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The origins of our solar system,

46
0:01:58.97,000 --> 0:02:,000
how our solar system came into being,

47
0:02:01.174,000 --> 0:02:04,000
is it unusual or special in any way?

48
0:02:04.583,000 --> 0:02:05,000
About the evolution of our universe.

49
0:02:06.574,000 --> 0:02:09,000
Why our universe is continuing to expand,

50
0:02:09.58,000 --> 0:02:1,000
and what is this mysterious dark energy

51
0:02:11.513,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that drives that expansion?

52
0:02:14.128,000 --> 0:02:16,000
But first, I want to show you how technology

53
0:02:16.892,000 --> 0:02:18,000
is going to change the way we view the sky.

54
0:02:19.663,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So imagine if you were sitting

55
0:02:21.17,000 --> 0:02:23,000
in the mountains of northern Chile

56
0:02:23.262,000 --> 0:02:24,000
looking out to the west

57
0:02:24.669,000 --> 0:02:26,000
towards the Pacific Ocean

58
0:02:26.717,000 --> 0:02:28,000
a few hours before sunrise.

59
0:02:29.281,000 --> 0:02:32,000
This is the view of the night sky that you would see,

60
0:02:32.518,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and it's a beautiful view,

61
0:02:34.189,000 --> 0:02:36,000
with the Milky Way just peeking out over the horizon.

62
0:02:37.102,000 --> 0:02:39,000
but it's also a static view,

63
0:02:39.262,000 --> 0:02:41,000
and in many ways, this is the way we think of our universe:

64
0:02:42.02,000 --> 0:02:44,000
eternal and unchanging.

65
0:02:44.414,000 --> 0:02:45,000
But the universe is anything but static.

66
0:02:46.405,000 --> 0:02:48,000
It constantly changes on timescales of seconds

67
0:02:48.936,000 --> 0:02:49,000
to billions of years.

68
0:02:50.781,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Galaxies merge, they collide

69
0:02:52.525,000 --> 0:02:54,000
at hundreds of thousands of miles per hour.

70
0:02:55.18,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Stars are born, they die,

71
0:02:57.25,000 --> 0:03:,000
they explode in these extravagant displays.

72
0:03:00.4,000 --> 0:03:01,000
In fact, if we could go back

73
0:03:01.67,000 --> 0:03:03,000
to our tranquil skies above Chile,

74
0:03:04.269,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and we allow time to move forward

75
0:03:06.734,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to see how the sky might change over the next year,

76
0:03:11.127,000 --> 0:03:13,000
the pulsations that you see

77
0:03:13.417,000 --> 0:03:17,000
are supernovae, the final remnants of a dying star

78
0:03:17.826,000 --> 0:03:2,000
exploding, brightening and then fading from view,

79
0:03:21.573,000 --> 0:03:22,000
each one of these supernovae

80
0:03:23.463,000 --> 0:03:26,000
five billion times the brightness of our sun,

81
0:03:26.466,000 --> 0:03:28,000
so we can see them to great distances

82
0:03:28.806,000 --> 0:03:3,000
but only for a short amount of time.

83
0:03:31.302,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Ten supernova per second explode somewhere

84
0:03:33.879,000 --> 0:03:34,000
in our universe.

85
0:03:35.296,000 --> 0:03:36,000
If we could hear it,

86
0:03:36.716,000 --> 0:03:39,000
it would be popping like a bag of popcorn.

87
0:03:40.415,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Now, if we fade out the supernovae,

88
0:03:43.542,000 --> 0:03:46,000
it's not just brightness that changes.

89
0:03:46.771,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Our sky is in constant motion.

90
0:03:49.11,000 --> 0:03:52,000
This swarm of objects you see streaming across the sky

91
0:03:52.28,000 --> 0:03:54,000
are asteroids as they orbit our sun,

92
0:03:54.938,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and it's these changes and the motion

93
0:03:56.91,000 --> 0:03:58,000
and it's the dynamics of the system

94
0:03:59.234,000 --> 0:04:01,000
that allow us to build our models for our universe,

95
0:04:01.607,000 --> 0:04:05,000
to predict its future and to explain its past.

96
0:04:05.68,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But the telescopes we've used over the last decade

97
0:04:08.774,000 --> 0:04:12,000
are not designed to capture the data at this scale.

98
0:04:12.789,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The Hubble Space Telescope:

99
0:04:14.409,000 --> 0:04:16,000
for the last 25 years it's been producing

100
0:04:16.67,000 --> 0:04:17,000
some of the most detailed views

101
0:04:18.631,000 --> 0:04:19,000
of our distant universe,

102
0:04:20.622,000 --> 0:04:22,000
but if you tried to use the Hubble to create an image

103
0:04:22.692,000 --> 0:04:26,000
of the sky, it would take 13 million individual images,

104
0:04:27.27,000 --> 0:04:3,000
about 120 years to do this just once.

105
0:04:30.982,000 --> 0:04:32,000
So this is driving us to new technologies

106
0:04:33.243,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and new telescopes,

107
0:04:35.09,000 --> 0:04:36,000
telescopes that can go faint

108
0:04:36.832,000 --> 0:04:37,000
to look at the distant universe

109
0:04:38.385,000 --> 0:04:4,000
but also telescopes that can go wide

110
0:04:41.066,000 --> 0:04:43,000
to capture the sky as rapidly as possible,

111
0:04:43.885,000 --> 0:04:46,000
telescopes like the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope,

112
0:04:47.446,000 --> 0:04:48,000
or the LSST,

113
0:04:49.325,000 --> 0:04:51,000
possibly the most boring name ever

114
0:04:51.665,000 --> 0:04:52,000
for one of the most fascinating experiments

115
0:04:53.644,000 --> 0:04:54,000
in the history of astronomy,

116
0:04:55.636,000 --> 0:04:57,000
in fact proof, if you should need it,

117
0:04:57.85,000 --> 0:04:59,000
that you should never allow a scientist or an engineer

118
0:05:00.518,000 --> 0:05:05,000
to name anything, not even your children. (Laughter)

119
0:05:06.349,000 --> 0:05:07,000
We're building the LSST.

120
0:05:07.814,000 --> 0:05:1,000
We expect it to start taking data by the end of this decade.

121
0:05:11.195,000 --> 0:05:12,000
I'm going to show you how we think

122
0:05:12.894,000 --> 0:05:15,000
it's going to transform our views of the universe,

123
0:05:16.471,000 --> 0:05:18,000
because one image from the LSST

124
0:05:18.845,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is equivalent to 3,000 images

125
0:05:21.23,000 --> 0:05:23,000
from the Hubble Space Telescope,

126
0:05:23.356,000 --> 0:05:26,000
each image three and a half degrees on the sky,

127
0:05:26.494,000 --> 0:05:28,000
seven times the width of the full moon.

128
0:05:29.27,000 --> 0:05:31,000
Well, how do you capture an image at this scale?

129
0:05:31.579,000 --> 0:05:35,000
Well, you build the largest digital camera in history,

130
0:05:35.73,000 --> 0:05:38,000
using the same technology you find in the cameras in your cell phone

131
0:05:38.891,000 --> 0:05:41,000
or in the digital cameras you can buy in the High Street,

132
0:05:42.682,000 --> 0:05:45,000
but now at a scale that is five and a half feet across,

133
0:05:45.802,000 --> 0:05:47,000
about the size of a Volkswagen Beetle,

134
0:05:48.21,000 --> 0:05:5,000
where one image is three billion pixels.

135
0:05:51.168,000 --> 0:05:52,000
So if you wanted to look at an image

136
0:05:52.506,000 --> 0:05:55,000
in its full resolution, just a single LSST image,

137
0:05:55.735,000 --> 0:05:59,000
it would take about 1,500 high-definition TV screens.

138
0:06:00.46,000 --> 0:06:02,000
And this camera will image the sky,

139
0:06:03.238,000 --> 0:06:06,000
taking a new picture every 20 seconds,

140
0:06:06.276,000 --> 0:06:08,000
constantly scanning the sky

141
0:06:08.464,000 --> 0:06:1,000
so every three nights, we'll get a completely new view

142
0:06:11.289,000 --> 0:06:13,000
of the skies above Chile.

143
0:06:13.672,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Over the mission lifetime of this telescope,

144
0:06:16.507,000 --> 0:06:19,000
it will detect 40 billion stars and galaxies,

145
0:06:19.859,000 --> 0:06:2,000
and that will be for the first time

146
0:06:21.359,000 --> 0:06:23,000
we'll have detected more objects in our universe

147
0:06:24.134,000 --> 0:06:26,000
than people on the Earth.

148
0:06:26.823,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Now, we can talk about this

149
0:06:28.038,000 --> 0:06:3,000
in terms of terabytes and petabytes

150
0:06:30.4,000 --> 0:06:31,000
and billions of objects,

151
0:06:31.919,000 --> 0:06:32,000
but a way to get a sense of the amount of data

152
0:06:33.667,000 --> 0:06:34,000
that will come off this camera

153
0:06:35.566,000 --> 0:06:39,000
is that it's like playing every TED Talk ever recorded

154
0:06:40.297,000 --> 0:06:43,000
simultaneously, 24 hours a day,

155
0:06:43.37,000 --> 0:06:45,000
seven days a week, for 10 years.

156
0:06:46.228,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And to process this data means

157
0:06:48.489,000 --> 0:06:49,000
searching through all of those talks

158
0:06:50.413,000 --> 0:06:52,000
for every new idea and every new concept,

159
0:06:52.662,000 --> 0:06:53,000
looking at each part of the video

160
0:06:54.518,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to see how one frame may have changed

161
0:06:56.543,000 --> 0:06:57,000
from the next.

162
0:06:58.388,000 --> 0:07:,000
And this is changing the way that we do science,

163
0:07:00.739,000 --> 0:07:02,000
changing the way that we do astronomy,

164
0:07:02.994,000 --> 0:07:04,000
to a place where software and algorithms

165
0:07:05.25,000 --> 0:07:06,000
have to mine through this data,

166
0:07:07.118,000 --> 0:07:1,000
where the software is as critical to the science

167
0:07:10.324,000 --> 0:07:14,000
as the telescopes and the cameras that we've built.

168
0:07:14.351,000 --> 0:07:16,000
Now, thousands of discoveries

169
0:07:16.938,000 --> 0:07:17,000
will come from this project,

170
0:07:18.873,000 --> 0:07:19,000
but I'm just going to tell you about two

171
0:07:20.324,000 --> 0:07:22,000
of the ideas about origins and evolution

172
0:07:22.687,000 --> 0:07:24,000
that may be transformed by our access

173
0:07:24.94,000 --> 0:07:26,000
to data at this scale.

174
0:07:27.501,000 --> 0:07:29,000
In the last five years, NASA has discovered

175
0:07:29.886,000 --> 0:07:31,000
over 1,000 planetary systems

176
0:07:32.147,000 --> 0:07:34,000
around nearby stars,

177
0:07:34.24,000 --> 0:07:35,000
but the systems we're finding

178
0:07:36.17,000 --> 0:07:38,000
aren't much like our own solar system,

179
0:07:38.66,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and one of the questions we face is

180
0:07:40.235,000 --> 0:07:42,000
is it just that we haven't been looking hard enough

181
0:07:42.553,000 --> 0:07:43,000
or is there something special or unusual

182
0:07:44.319,000 --> 0:07:46,000
about how our solar system formed?

183
0:07:46.737,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And if we want to answer that question,

184
0:07:48.999,000 --> 0:07:49,000
we have to know and understand

185
0:07:50.438,000 --> 0:07:52,000
the history of our solar system in detail,

186
0:07:53.274,000 --> 0:07:55,000
and it's the details that are crucial.

187
0:07:55.411,000 --> 0:07:58,000
So now, if we look back at the sky,

188
0:07:59.077,000 --> 0:08:02,000
at our asteroids that were streaming across the sky,

189
0:08:02.628,000 --> 0:08:06,000
these asteroids are like the debris of our solar system.

190
0:08:06.85,000 --> 0:08:08,000
The positions of the asteroids

191
0:08:08.858,000 --> 0:08:1,000
are like a fingerprint of an earlier time

192
0:08:10.995,000 --> 0:08:11,000
when the orbits of Neptune and Jupiter

193
0:08:12.975,000 --> 0:08:13,000
were much closer to the sun,

194
0:08:14.87,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and as these giant planets migrated through our solar system,

195
0:08:18.323,000 --> 0:08:21,000
they were scattering the asteroids in their wake.

196
0:08:21.653,000 --> 0:08:22,000
So studying the asteroids

197
0:08:22.959,000 --> 0:08:24,000
is like performing forensics,

198
0:08:25.08,000 --> 0:08:27,000
performing forensics on our solar system,

199
0:08:27.638,000 --> 0:08:29,000
but to do this, we need distance,

200
0:08:30.34,000 --> 0:08:32,000
and we get the distance from the motion,

201
0:08:32.419,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and we get the motion because of our access to time.

202
0:08:36.966,000 --> 0:08:37,000
So what does this tell us?

203
0:08:38.668,000 --> 0:08:4,000
Well, if you look at the little yellow asteroids

204
0:08:40.895,000 --> 0:08:42,000
flitting across the screen,

205
0:08:43.168,000 --> 0:08:45,000
these are the asteroids that are moving fastest,

206
0:08:45.598,000 --> 0:08:48,000
because they're closest to us, closest to Earth.

207
0:08:48.939,000 --> 0:08:49,000
These are the asteroids we may one day

208
0:08:50.446,000 --> 0:08:53,000
send spacecraft to, to mine them for minerals,

209
0:08:53.844,000 --> 0:08:55,000
but they're also the asteroids that may one day

210
0:08:55.846,000 --> 0:08:56,000
impact the Earth,

211
0:08:57.511,000 --> 0:08:58,000
like happened 60 million years ago

212
0:08:58.802,000 --> 0:09:,000
with the extinction of the dinosaurs,

213
0:09:01.437,000 --> 0:09:02,000
or just at the beginning of the last century,

214
0:09:03.259,000 --> 0:09:04,000
when an asteroid wiped out

215
0:09:04.591,000 --> 0:09:07,000
almost 1,000 square miles of Siberian forest,

216
0:09:08.18,000 --> 0:09:11,000
or even just last year, as one burnt up over Russia,

217
0:09:11.268,000 --> 0:09:14,000
releasing the energy of a small nuclear bomb.

218
0:09:14.88,000 --> 0:09:17,000
So studying the forensics of our solar system

219
0:09:18.502,000 --> 0:09:2,000
doesn't just tell us about the past,

220
0:09:20.56,000 --> 0:09:23,000
it can also predict the future, including our future.

221
0:09:26.771,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Now when we get distance,

222
0:09:28.739,000 --> 0:09:31,000
we get to see the asteroids in their natural habitat,

223
0:09:32.328,000 --> 0:09:33,000
in orbit around the sun.

224
0:09:33.65,000 --> 0:09:35,000
So every point in this visualization that you can see

225
0:09:36.557,000 --> 0:09:38,000
is a real asteroid.

226
0:09:39.32,000 --> 0:09:43,000
Its orbit has been calculated from its motion across the sky.

227
0:09:43.33,000 --> 0:09:46,000
The colors reflect the composition of these asteroids,

228
0:09:46.671,000 --> 0:09:48,000
dry and stony in the center,

229
0:09:48.808,000 --> 0:09:5,000
water-rich and primitive towards the edge,

230
0:09:51.395,000 --> 0:09:53,000
water-rich asteroids which may have seeded

231
0:09:53.679,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the oceans and the seas that we find on our planet

232
0:09:57.13,000 --> 0:10:,000
when they bombarded the Earth at an earlier time.

233
0:10:02.127,000 --> 0:10:04,000
Because the LSST will be able to go faint

234
0:10:04.959,000 --> 0:10:05,000
and not just wide,

235
0:10:06.657,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we will be able to see these asteroids

236
0:10:08.465,000 --> 0:10:11,000
far beyond the inner part of our solar system,

237
0:10:11.652,000 --> 0:10:14,000
to asteroids beyond the orbits of Neptune and Mars,

238
0:10:15.465,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to comets and asteroids that may exist

239
0:10:17.726,000 --> 0:10:2,000
almost a light year from our sun.

240
0:10:20.956,000 --> 0:10:22,000
And as we increase the detail of this picture,

241
0:10:23.565,000 --> 0:10:26,000
increasing the detail by factors of 10 to 100,

242
0:10:26.692,000 --> 0:10:28,000
we will be able to answer questions such as,

243
0:10:29.122,000 --> 0:10:32,000
is there evidence for planets outside the orbit of Neptune,

244
0:10:32.711,000 --> 0:10:34,000
to find Earth-impacting asteroids

245
0:10:35.218,000 --> 0:10:37,000
long before they're a danger,

246
0:10:37.753,000 --> 0:10:38,000
and to find out whether, maybe,

247
0:10:39.51,000 --> 0:10:42,000
our sun formed on its own or in a cluster of stars,

248
0:10:42.69,000 --> 0:10:45,000
and maybe it's this sun's stellar siblings

249
0:10:45.772,000 --> 0:10:48,000
that influenced the formation of our solar system,

250
0:10:49.214,000 --> 0:10:54,000
and maybe that's one of the reasons why solar systems like ours seem to be so rare.

251
0:10:54.974,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Now, distance and changes in our universe —

252
0:10:59.536,000 --> 0:11:02,000
distance equates to time,

253
0:11:03.395,000 --> 0:11:05,000
as well as changes on the sky.

254
0:11:05.454,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Every foot of distance you look away,

255
0:11:08.244,000 --> 0:11:1,000
or every foot of distance an object is away,

256
0:11:10.729,000 --> 0:11:13,000
you're looking back about a billionth of a second in time,

257
0:11:14.318,000 --> 0:11:16,000
and this idea or this notion of looking back in time

258
0:11:16.931,000 --> 0:11:18,000
has revolutionized our ideas about the universe,

259
0:11:19.562,000 --> 0:11:21,000
not once but multiple times.

260
0:11:21.842,000 --> 0:11:23,000
The first time was in 1929,

261
0:11:24.654,000 --> 0:11:26,000
when an astronomer called Edwin Hubble

262
0:11:26.746,000 --> 0:11:28,000
showed that the universe was expanding,

263
0:11:28.995,000 --> 0:11:3,000
leading to the ideas of the Big Bang.

264
0:11:31.708,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And the observations were simple:

265
0:11:34.29,000 --> 0:11:36,000
just 24 galaxies

266
0:11:36.444,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and a hand-drawn picture.

267
0:11:41.124,000 --> 0:11:45,000
But just the idea that the more distant a galaxy,

268
0:11:45.784,000 --> 0:11:47,000
the faster it was receding,

269
0:11:47.854,000 --> 0:11:5,000
was enough to give rise to modern cosmology.

270
0:11:51.273,000 --> 0:11:53,000
A second revolution happened 70 years later,

271
0:11:53.698,000 --> 0:11:55,000
when two groups of astronomers showed

272
0:11:55.77,000 --> 0:11:57,000
that the universe wasn't just expanding,

273
0:11:58.203,000 --> 0:11:59,000
it was accelerating,

274
0:11:59.528,000 --> 0:12:02,000
a surprise like throwing up a ball into the sky

275
0:12:02.871,000 --> 0:12:04,000
and finding out the higher that it gets,

276
0:12:05.683,000 --> 0:12:06,000
the faster it moves away.

277
0:12:07.461,000 --> 0:12:08,000
And they showed this

278
0:12:08.97,000 --> 0:12:1,000
by measuring the brightness of supernovae,

279
0:12:11.375,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and how the brightness of the supernovae

280
0:12:13.209,000 --> 0:12:15,000
got fainter with distance.

281
0:12:15.38,000 --> 0:12:17,000
And these observations were more complex.

282
0:12:17.833,000 --> 0:12:2,000
They required new technologies and new telescopes,

283
0:12:20.847,000 --> 0:12:24,000
because the supernovae were in galaxies

284
0:12:24.897,000 --> 0:12:25,000
that were 2,000 times more distant

285
0:12:26.855,000 --> 0:12:28,000
than the ones used by Hubble.

286
0:12:29.543,000 --> 0:12:34,000
And it took three years to find just 42 supernovae,

287
0:12:34.854,000 --> 0:12:35,000
because a supernova only explodes

288
0:12:36.608,000 --> 0:12:39,000
once every hundred years within a galaxy.

289
0:12:39.69,000 --> 0:12:41,000
Three years to find 42 supernovae

290
0:12:41.974,000 --> 0:12:45,000
by searching through tens of thousands of galaxies.

291
0:12:45.993,000 --> 0:12:46,000
And once they'd collected their data,

292
0:12:47.844,000 --> 0:12:5,000
this is what they found.

293
0:12:51.592,000 --> 0:12:53,000
Now, this may not look impressive,

294
0:12:54.303,000 --> 0:12:58,000
but this is what a revolution in physics looks like:

295
0:12:58.418,000 --> 0:13:,000
a line predicting the brightness of a supernova

296
0:13:00.848,000 --> 0:13:02,000
11 billion light years away,

297
0:13:02.894,000 --> 0:13:05,000
and a handful of points that don't quite fit that line.

298
0:13:06.69,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Small changes give rise to big consequences.

299
0:13:10.803,000 --> 0:13:12,000
Small changes allow us to make discoveries,

300
0:13:13.751,000 --> 0:13:15,000
like the planet found by Herschel.

301
0:13:16.574,000 --> 0:13:18,000
Small changes turn our understanding

302
0:13:18.846,000 --> 0:13:2,000
of the universe on its head.

303
0:13:21.247,000 --> 0:13:24,000
So 42 supernovae, slightly too faint,

304
0:13:24.711,000 --> 0:13:26,000
meaning slightly further away,

305
0:13:26.72,000 --> 0:13:29,000
requiring that a universe must not just be expanding,

306
0:13:29.88,000 --> 0:13:32,000
but this expansion must be accelerating,

307
0:13:33.21,000 --> 0:13:34,000
revealing a component of our universe

308
0:13:35.156,000 --> 0:13:37,000
which we now call dark energy,

309
0:13:37.642,000 --> 0:13:39,000
a component that drives this expansion

310
0:13:40.151,000 --> 0:13:43,000
and makes up 68 percent of the energy budget

311
0:13:43.178,000 --> 0:13:45,000
of our universe today.

312
0:13:46.751,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So what is the next revolution likely to be?

313
0:13:50.575,000 --> 0:13:52,000
Well, what is dark energy and why does it exist?

314
0:13:53.294,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Each of these lines shows a different model

315
0:13:55.622,000 --> 0:13:57,000
for what dark energy might be,

316
0:13:58.465,000 --> 0:14:,000
showing the properties of dark energy.

317
0:14:00.946,000 --> 0:14:03,000
They all are consistent with the 42 points,

318
0:14:04.569,000 --> 0:14:06,000
but the ideas behind these lines

319
0:14:06.796,000 --> 0:14:08,000
are dramatically different.

320
0:14:08.899,000 --> 0:14:1,000
Some people think about a dark energy

321
0:14:11.442,000 --> 0:14:12,000
that changes with time,

322
0:14:12.9,000 --> 0:14:14,000
or whether the properties of the dark energy

323
0:14:15.188,000 --> 0:14:17,000
are different depending on where you look on the sky.

324
0:14:17.944,000 --> 0:14:18,000
Others make differences and changes

325
0:14:19.767,000 --> 0:14:22,000
to the physics at the sub-atomic level.

326
0:14:22.815,000 --> 0:14:24,000
Or, they look at large scales

327
0:14:25.605,000 --> 0:14:28,000
and change how gravity and general relativity work,

328
0:14:29.17,000 --> 0:14:31,000
or they say our universe is just one of many,

329
0:14:31.961,000 --> 0:14:33,000
part of this mysterious multiverse,

330
0:14:34.559,000 --> 0:14:37,000
but all of these ideas, all of these theories,

331
0:14:37.72,000 --> 0:14:4,000
amazing and admittedly some of them a little crazy,

332
0:14:41.219,000 --> 0:14:45,000
but all of them consistent with our 42 points.

333
0:14:45.246,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So how can we hope to make sense of this

334
0:14:47.428,000 --> 0:14:49,000
over the next decade?

335
0:14:49.7,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Well, imagine if I gave you a pair of dice,

336
0:14:52.93,000 --> 0:14:53,000
and I said you wanted to see whether those dice

337
0:14:54.929,000 --> 0:14:55,000
were loaded or fair.

338
0:14:56.796,000 --> 0:14:58,000
One roll of the dice would tell you very little,

339
0:14:59.73,000 --> 0:15:,000
but the more times you rolled them,

340
0:15:01.722,000 --> 0:15:02,000
the more data you collected,

341
0:15:03.644,000 --> 0:15:05,000
the more confident you would become,

342
0:15:05.816,000 --> 0:15:07,000
not just whether they're loaded or fair,

343
0:15:08.419,000 --> 0:15:11,000
but by how much, and in what way.

344
0:15:12.317,000 --> 0:15:15,000
It took three years to find just 42 supernovae

345
0:15:16.119,000 --> 0:15:19,000
because the telescopes that we built

346
0:15:19.166,000 --> 0:15:22,000
could only survey a small part of the sky.

347
0:15:22.859,000 --> 0:15:24,000
With the LSST, we get a completely new view

348
0:15:25.524,000 --> 0:15:28,000
of the skies above Chile every three nights.

349
0:15:29.146,000 --> 0:15:31,000
In its first night of operation,

350
0:15:31.609,000 --> 0:15:34,000
it will find 10 times the number of supernovae

351
0:15:34.759,000 --> 0:15:37,000
used in the discovery of dark energy.

352
0:15:37.9,000 --> 0:15:38,000
This will increase by 1,000

353
0:15:39.709,000 --> 0:15:41,000
within the first four months:

354
0:15:42.202,000 --> 0:15:46,000
1.5 million supernovae by the end of its survey,

355
0:15:46.986,000 --> 0:15:49,000
each supernova a roll of the dice,

356
0:15:50.171,000 --> 0:15:53,000
each supernova testing which theories of dark energy

357
0:15:53.613,000 --> 0:15:57,000
are consistent, and which ones are not.

358
0:15:57.741,000 --> 0:16:,000
And so, by combining these supernova data

359
0:16:01.544,000 --> 0:16:03,000
with other measures of cosmology,

360
0:16:03.82,000 --> 0:16:05,000
we'll progressively rule out the different ideas

361
0:16:06.71,000 --> 0:16:07,000
and theories of dark energy

362
0:16:08.686,000 --> 0:16:15,000
until hopefully at the end of this survey around 2030,

363
0:16:15.828,000 --> 0:16:17,000
we would expect to hopefully see

364
0:16:18.442,000 --> 0:16:2,000
a theory for our universe,

365
0:16:20.584,000 --> 0:16:22,000
a fundamental theory for the physics of our universe,

366
0:16:23.123,000 --> 0:16:25,000
to gradually emerge.

367
0:16:26.95,000 --> 0:16:28,000
Now, in many ways, the questions that I posed

368
0:16:29.342,000 --> 0:16:33,000
are in reality the simplest of questions.

369
0:16:33.703,000 --> 0:16:34,000
We may not know the answers,

370
0:16:35.457,000 --> 0:16:38,000
but we at least know how to ask the questions.

371
0:16:39.309,000 --> 0:16:42,000
But if looking through tens of thousands of galaxies

372
0:16:42.427,000 --> 0:16:44,000
revealed 42 supernovae that turned

373
0:16:45.365,000 --> 0:16:48,000
our understanding of the universe on its head,

374
0:16:48.844,000 --> 0:16:5,000
when we're working with billions of galaxies,

375
0:16:51.758,000 --> 0:16:52,000
how many more times are we going to find

376
0:16:53.535,000 --> 0:16:58,000
42 points that don't quite match what we expect?

377
0:16:59.183,000 --> 0:17:01,000
Like the planet found by Herschel

378
0:17:01.94,000 --> 0:17:03,000
or dark energy

379
0:17:04.357,000 --> 0:17:07,000
or quantum mechanics or general relativity,

380
0:17:08.2,000 --> 0:17:1,000
all ideas that came because the data

381
0:17:10.544,000 --> 0:17:13,000
didn't quite match what we expected.

382
0:17:13.999,000 --> 0:17:16,000
What's so exciting about the next decade of data

383
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:18,000
in astronomy is,

384
0:17:18.93,000 --> 0:17:2,000
we don't even know how many answers

385
0:17:21.141,000 --> 0:17:22,000
are out there waiting,

386
0:17:22.941,000 --> 0:17:25,000
answers about our origins and our evolution.

387
0:17:26.822,000 --> 0:17:27,000
How many answers are out there

388
0:17:27.917,000 --> 0:17:3,000
that we don't even know the questions

389
0:17:31.211,000 --> 0:17:33,000
that we want to ask?

390
0:17:33.222,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Thank you.

391
0:17:35.169,000 --> 0:17:38,000
(Applause)

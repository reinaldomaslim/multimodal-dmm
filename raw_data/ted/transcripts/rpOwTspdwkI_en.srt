1
0:00:12.846,000 --> 0:00:13,000
The world is changing

2
0:00:14.149,000 --> 0:00:16,000
in some really profound ways,

3
0:00:16.861,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and I worry that investors

4
0:00:18.844,000 --> 0:00:19,000
aren't paying enough attention

5
0:00:20.578,000 --> 0:00:21,000
to some of the biggest drivers of change,

6
0:00:22.443,000 --> 0:00:25,000
especially when it comes to sustainability.

7
0:00:26.219,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And by sustainability, I mean the really juicy things,

8
0:00:29.674,000 --> 0:00:3,000
like environmental and social issues

9
0:00:31.577,000 --> 0:00:33,000
and corporate governance.

10
0:00:34.086,000 --> 0:00:36,000
I think it's reckless to ignore these things,

11
0:00:36.352,000 --> 0:00:37,000
because doing so can jeopardize

12
0:00:37.998,000 --> 0:00:39,000
future long-term returns.

13
0:00:40.467,000 --> 0:00:42,000
And here's something that may surprise you:

14
0:00:42.663,000 --> 0:00:46,000
the balance of power to really influence sustainability

15
0:00:47.334,000 --> 0:00:49,000
rests with institutional investors,

16
0:00:49.489,000 --> 0:00:52,000
the large investors like pension funds,

17
0:00:52.525,000 --> 0:00:54,000
foundations and endowments.

18
0:00:55.481,000 --> 0:00:56,000
I believe that sustainable investing

19
0:00:57.075,000 --> 0:00:59,000
is less complicated than you think,

20
0:00:59.725,000 --> 0:01:01,000
better-performing than you believe,

21
0:01:01.753,000 --> 0:01:03,000
and more important than we can imagine.

22
0:01:04.626,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Let me remind you what we already know.

23
0:01:07.634,000 --> 0:01:1,000
We have a population that's both growing and aging;

24
0:01:11.18,000 --> 0:01:12,000
we have seven billion souls today

25
0:01:13.026,000 --> 0:01:14,000
heading to 10 billion

26
0:01:14.452,000 --> 0:01:15,000
at the end of the century;

27
0:01:16.353,000 --> 0:01:18,000
we consume natural resources

28
0:01:18.851,000 --> 0:01:2,000
faster than they can be replenished;

29
0:01:21.677,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and the emissions that are mainly responsible

30
0:01:24.114,000 --> 0:01:28,000
for climate change just keep increasing.

31
0:01:28.943,000 --> 0:01:32,000
Now clearly, these are environmental and social issues,

32
0:01:33.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
but that's not all.

33
0:01:35.092,000 --> 0:01:36,000
They're economic issues,

34
0:01:37.064,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and that makes them relevant

35
0:01:38.8,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to risk and return.

36
0:01:42.077,000 --> 0:01:44,000
And they are really complex

37
0:01:44.157,000 --> 0:01:45,000
and they can seem really far off,

38
0:01:45.822,000 --> 0:01:48,000
that the temptation may be to do this:

39
0:01:49.108,000 --> 0:01:52,000
bury our heads in the sand and not think about it.

40
0:01:52.474,000 --> 0:01:54,000
Resist this, if you can. Don't do this at home.

41
0:01:55.124,000 --> 0:01:56,000
(Laughter)

42
0:01:57.05,000 --> 0:01:58,000
But it makes me wonder

43
0:01:58.693,000 --> 0:02:,000
if the investment rules of today

44
0:02:00.706,000 --> 0:02:03,000
are fit for purpose tomorrow.

45
0:02:03.951,000 --> 0:02:04,000
We know that investors,

46
0:02:05.789,000 --> 0:02:07,000
when they look at a company and decide whether to invest,

47
0:02:08.649,000 --> 0:02:09,000
they look at financial data,

48
0:02:10.281,000 --> 0:02:14,000
metrics like sales growth, cash flow, market share,

49
0:02:14.301,000 --> 0:02:19,000
valuation -- you know, the really sexy stuff.

50
0:02:19.713,000 --> 0:02:21,000
And these things are fundamental, of course,

51
0:02:22.04,000 --> 0:02:23,000
but they're not enough.

52
0:02:23.805,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Investors should also look at performance metrics

53
0:02:26.254,000 --> 0:02:27,000
in what we call ESG:

54
0:02:28.178,000 --> 0:02:3,000
environment, social and governance.

55
0:02:31.02,000 --> 0:02:35,000
Environment includes energy consumption,

56
0:02:35.782,000 --> 0:02:4,000
water availability, waste and pollution,

57
0:02:41.166,000 --> 0:02:44,000
just making efficient uses of resources.

58
0:02:44.985,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Social includes human capital,

59
0:02:47.112,000 --> 0:02:48,000
things like employee engagement

60
0:02:48.98,000 --> 0:02:5,000
and innovation capacity,

61
0:02:51.324,000 --> 0:02:54,000
as well as supply chain management

62
0:02:54.636,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and labor rights and human rights.

63
0:02:58.206,000 --> 0:02:59,000
And governance relates to the oversight

64
0:03:00.014,000 --> 0:03:03,000
of companies by their boards and investors.

65
0:03:03.795,000 --> 0:03:06,000
See, I told you this is the really juicy stuff.

66
0:03:06.906,000 --> 0:03:1,000
But ESG is the measure of sustainability,

67
0:03:11.093,000 --> 0:03:15,000
and sustainable investing incorporates ESG factors

68
0:03:15.234,000 --> 0:03:19,000
with financial factors into the investment process.

69
0:03:19.351,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It means limiting future risk

70
0:03:21.479,000 --> 0:03:24,000
by minimizing harm to people and planet,

71
0:03:25.088,000 --> 0:03:28,000
and it means providing capital to users

72
0:03:28.703,000 --> 0:03:3,000
who deploy it towards productive

73
0:03:30.863,000 --> 0:03:32,000
and sustainable outcomes.

74
0:03:33.587,000 --> 0:03:36,000
So if sustainability matters financially today,

75
0:03:36.751,000 --> 0:03:38,000
and all signs indicate more tomorrow,

76
0:03:39.243,000 --> 0:03:42,000
is the private sector paying attention?

77
0:03:42.741,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Well, the really cool thing is that most CEOs are.

78
0:03:48.722,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They started to see sustainability

79
0:03:50.288,000 --> 0:03:54,000
not just as important but crucial to business success.

80
0:03:54.532,000 --> 0:03:56,000
About 80 percent of global CEOs

81
0:03:56.946,000 --> 0:04:,000
see sustainability as the root to growth in innovation

82
0:04:01.037,000 --> 0:04:03,000
and leading to competitive advantage

83
0:04:03.43,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in their industries.

84
0:04:05.154,000 --> 0:04:08,000
But 93 percent see ESG as the future,

85
0:04:08.327,000 --> 0:04:11,000
or as important to the future of their business.

86
0:04:11.376,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So the views of CEOs are clear.

87
0:04:14.593,000 --> 0:04:17,000
There's tremendous opportunity in sustainability.

88
0:04:17.78,000 --> 0:04:2,000
So how are companies actually leveraging ESG

89
0:04:21.308,000 --> 0:04:23,000
to drive hard business results?

90
0:04:24.11,000 --> 0:04:26,000
One example is near and dear to our hearts.

91
0:04:26.631,000 --> 0:04:29,000
In 2012, State Street migrated 54 applications

92
0:04:30.065,000 --> 0:04:31,000
to the cloud environment,

93
0:04:31.711,000 --> 0:04:33,000
and we retired another 85.

94
0:04:34.14,000 --> 0:04:36,000
We virtualized our operating system environments,

95
0:04:36.846,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and we completed numerous automation projects.

96
0:04:40.309,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Now these initiatives create a more mobile workplace,

97
0:04:42.841,000 --> 0:04:44,000
and they reduce our real estate footprint,

98
0:04:45.625,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and they yield savings of 23 million dollars

99
0:04:48.265,000 --> 0:04:51,000
in operating costs annually,

100
0:04:51.265,000 --> 0:04:52,000
and avoid the emissions

101
0:04:53.101,000 --> 0:04:57,000
of a 100,000 metric tons of carbon.

102
0:04:57.551,000 --> 0:05:,000
That's the equivalent of taking 21,000 cars

103
0:05:00.584,000 --> 0:05:01,000
off the road.

104
0:05:02.373,000 --> 0:05:04,000
So awesome, right?

105
0:05:05.012,000 --> 0:05:07,000
Another example is Pentair.

106
0:05:07.976,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Pentair is a U.S. industrial conglomerate,

107
0:05:10.305,000 --> 0:05:11,000
and about a decade ago,

108
0:05:11.885,000 --> 0:05:13,000
they sold their core power tools business

109
0:05:14.372,000 --> 0:05:18,000
and reinvested those proceeds in a water business.

110
0:05:18.63,000 --> 0:05:21,000
That's a really big bet. Why did they do that?

111
0:05:22.593,000 --> 0:05:24,000
Well, with apologies to the Home Improvement fans,

112
0:05:25.321,000 --> 0:05:27,000
there's more growth in water than in power tools,

113
0:05:28.243,000 --> 0:05:29,000
and this company has their sights set

114
0:05:30.165,000 --> 0:05:32,000
on what they call "the new New World."

115
0:05:32.532,000 --> 0:05:34,000
That's four billion middle class people

116
0:05:34.915,000 --> 0:05:39,000
demanding food, energy and water.

117
0:05:40.069,000 --> 0:05:43,000
Now, you may be asking yourself,

118
0:05:43.193,000 --> 0:05:44,000
are these just isolated cases?

119
0:05:44.859,000 --> 0:05:45,000
I mean, come on, really?

120
0:05:46.837,000 --> 0:05:48,000
Do companies that take sustainability into account

121
0:05:48.846,000 --> 0:05:5,000
really do well financially?

122
0:05:51.032,000 --> 0:05:53,000
The answer that may surprise you is yes.

123
0:05:53.878,000 --> 0:05:56,000
The data shows that stocks with better ESG performance

124
0:05:57.043,000 --> 0:06:,000
perform just as well as others.

125
0:06:00.39,000 --> 0:06:02,000
In blue, we see the MSCI World.

126
0:06:02.664,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It's an index of large companies

127
0:06:04.101,000 --> 0:06:06,000
from developed markets across the world.

128
0:06:06.89,000 --> 0:06:08,000
And in gold, we see a subset of companies

129
0:06:09.362,000 --> 0:06:11,000
rated as having the best ESG performance.

130
0:06:12.145,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Over three plus years, no performance tradeoff.

131
0:06:16.396,000 --> 0:06:2,000
So that's okay, right? We want more. I want more.

132
0:06:20.807,000 --> 0:06:22,000
In some cases, there may be outperformance

133
0:06:23.37,000 --> 0:06:25,000
from ESG.

134
0:06:25.953,000 --> 0:06:27,000
In blue, we see the performance

135
0:06:28.131,000 --> 0:06:3,000
of the 500 largest global companies,

136
0:06:30.546,000 --> 0:06:33,000
and in gold, we see a subset of companies

137
0:06:33.859,000 --> 0:06:35,000
with best practice in climate change strategy

138
0:06:36.682,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and risk management.

139
0:06:38.115,000 --> 0:06:39,000
Now over almost eight years,

140
0:06:39.545,000 --> 0:06:42,000
they've outperformed by about two thirds.

141
0:06:42.555,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So yes, this is correlation. It's not causation.

142
0:06:46.449,000 --> 0:06:48,000
But it does illustrate that environmental leadership

143
0:06:48.978,000 --> 0:06:51,000
is compatible with good returns.

144
0:06:52.051,000 --> 0:06:56,000
So if the returns are the same or better

145
0:06:56.394,000 --> 0:06:59,000
and the planet benefits, wouldn't this be the norm?

146
0:06:59.505,000 --> 0:07:02,000
Are investors, particularly institutional investors,

147
0:07:02.636,000 --> 0:07:03,000
engaged?

148
0:07:04.075,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Well, some are,

149
0:07:05.952,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and a few are really at the vanguard.

150
0:07:09.288,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Hesta.

151
0:07:10.527,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Hesta is a retirement fund for health

152
0:07:12.774,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and community services employees in Australia,

153
0:07:15.469,000 --> 0:07:17,000
with assets of 22 billion [dollars].

154
0:07:17.714,000 --> 0:07:18,000
They believe that ESG has the potential

155
0:07:19.537,000 --> 0:07:21,000
to impact risks and returns,

156
0:07:21.605,000 --> 0:07:24,000
so incorporating it into the investment process

157
0:07:24.897,000 --> 0:07:26,000
is core to their duty

158
0:07:27.113,000 --> 0:07:29,000
to act in the best interest of fund members,

159
0:07:29.271,000 --> 0:07:3,000
core to their duty.

160
0:07:30.957,000 --> 0:07:33,000
You gotta love the Aussies, right?

161
0:07:34.668,000 --> 0:07:36,000
CalPERS is another example.

162
0:07:37.176,000 --> 0:07:39,000
CalPERS is the pension fund

163
0:07:39.197,000 --> 0:07:41,000
for public employees in California,

164
0:07:41.478,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and with assets of 244 billion [dollars],

165
0:07:44.194,000 --> 0:07:46,000
they are the second largest in the U.S.

166
0:07:46.286,000 --> 0:07:48,000
and the sixth largest in the world.

167
0:07:48.983,000 --> 0:07:49,000
Now, they're moving toward 100 percent

168
0:07:50.546,000 --> 0:07:51,000
sustainable investment

169
0:07:52.135,000 --> 0:07:54,000
by systematically integrated ESG

170
0:07:54.217,000 --> 0:07:56,000
across the entire fund.

171
0:07:56.966,000 --> 0:07:59,000
Why? They believe it's critical

172
0:08:00.423,000 --> 0:08:04,000
to superior long-term returns, full stop.

173
0:08:04.954,000 --> 0:08:06,000
In their own words, "long-term value creation

174
0:08:07.546,000 --> 0:08:09,000
requires the effective management

175
0:08:09.586,000 --> 0:08:11,000
of three forms of capital:

176
0:08:11.728,000 --> 0:08:15,000
financial, human, and physical.

177
0:08:16.447,000 --> 0:08:19,000
This is why we are concerned with ESG."

178
0:08:20.306,000 --> 0:08:22,000
Now, I do speak to a lot of investors

179
0:08:22.714,000 --> 0:08:23,000
as part of my job,

180
0:08:24.441,000 --> 0:08:26,000
and not all of them see it this way.

181
0:08:26.735,000 --> 0:08:29,000
Often I hear, "We are required to maximize returns,

182
0:08:30.493,000 --> 0:08:31,000
so we don't do that here,"

183
0:08:32.243,000 --> 0:08:34,000
or, "We don't want to use the portfolio

184
0:08:34.59,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to make policy statements."

185
0:08:37.094,000 --> 0:08:39,000
The one that just really gets under my skin is,

186
0:08:39.96,000 --> 0:08:41,000
"If you want to do something about that,

187
0:08:42.012,000 --> 0:08:45,000
just make money, give the profits to charities."

188
0:08:45.475,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It's eyes rolling, eyes rolling.

189
0:08:49.244,000 --> 0:08:53,000
I mean, let me clarify something right here.

190
0:08:53.267,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Companies and investors are not

191
0:08:55.872,000 --> 0:08:57,000
singularly responsible for the fate of the planet.

192
0:08:58.631,000 --> 0:09:,000
They don't have indefinite social obligations,

193
0:09:01.019,000 --> 0:09:03,000
and prudent investing and finance theory

194
0:09:03.792,000 --> 0:09:05,000
aren't subordinate to sustainability.

195
0:09:05.891,000 --> 0:09:06,000
They're compatible.

196
0:09:07.547,000 --> 0:09:11,000
So I'm not talking about tradeoffs here.

197
0:09:12.012,000 --> 0:09:13,000
But institutional investors

198
0:09:13.989,000 --> 0:09:16,000
are the x-factor in sustainability.

199
0:09:17.155,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Why do they hold the key?

200
0:09:19.218,000 --> 0:09:22,000
The answer, quite simply, is, they have the money.

201
0:09:22.933,000 --> 0:09:24,000
(Laughter)

202
0:09:25.619,000 --> 0:09:27,000
A lot of it.

203
0:09:28.015,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I mean, a really lot of it.

204
0:09:29.757,000 --> 0:09:31,000
The global stock market is worth 55 trillion dollars.

205
0:09:32.6,000 --> 0:09:35,000
The global bond market, 78 trillion.

206
0:09:35.658,000 --> 0:09:4,000
That's 133 trillion combined.

207
0:09:40.836,000 --> 0:09:42,000
That's eight and a half times the GDP of the U.S.

208
0:09:43.507,000 --> 0:09:45,000
That's the world's largest economy.

209
0:09:45.726,000 --> 0:09:48,000
That's some serious freaking firepower.

210
0:09:49.563,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So we can reconsider

211
0:09:51.612,000 --> 0:09:52,000
some of these pressing challenges,

212
0:09:53.535,000 --> 0:09:55,000
like fresh water, clean air,

213
0:09:56.049,000 --> 0:09:58,000
feeding 10 billion mouths,

214
0:09:58.074,000 --> 0:09:59,000
if institutional investors

215
0:09:59.751,000 --> 0:10:01,000
integrated ESG into investment.

216
0:10:02.163,000 --> 0:10:04,000
What if they used that firepower

217
0:10:04.314,000 --> 0:10:06,000
to allocate more of their capital

218
0:10:06.358,000 --> 0:10:07,000
to companies working the hardest

219
0:10:07.771,000 --> 0:10:09,000
at solving these challenges

220
0:10:09.853,000 --> 0:10:12,000
or at least not exacerbating them?

221
0:10:12.969,000 --> 0:10:16,000
What if we work and save and invest,

222
0:10:17.806,000 --> 0:10:19,000
only to find that the world we retire into

223
0:10:20.439,000 --> 0:10:23,000
is more stressed and less secure than it is now?

224
0:10:24.165,000 --> 0:10:28,000
What if there isn't enough clean air and fresh water?

225
0:10:29.037,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Now a fair question might be,

226
0:10:31.525,000 --> 0:10:32,000
what if all this sustainability risk stuff

227
0:10:33.421,000 --> 0:10:37,000
is exaggerated, overstated, it's not urgent,

228
0:10:37.957,000 --> 0:10:39,000
something for virtuous consumers

229
0:10:40.11,000 --> 0:10:41,000
or lifestyle choice?

230
0:10:42.066,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Well, President John F. Kennedy said something

231
0:10:44.805,000 --> 0:10:47,000
about this that is just spot on:

232
0:10:48.29,000 --> 0:10:51,000
"There are risks and costs to a program of action,

233
0:10:52.102,000 --> 0:10:54,000
but they are far less than the long-range risks

234
0:10:54.751,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and costs of comfortable inaction."

235
0:10:59.366,000 --> 0:11:02,000
I can appreciate that there is estimation risk in this,

236
0:11:02.984,000 --> 0:11:05,000
but since this is based on widespread scientific consensus,

237
0:11:06.619,000 --> 0:11:08,000
the odds that it's not completely wrong

238
0:11:09.18,000 --> 0:11:1,000
are better than the odds

239
0:11:10.796,000 --> 0:11:11,000
that our house will burn down

240
0:11:12.471,000 --> 0:11:13,000
or we'll get in a car accident.

241
0:11:14.406,000 --> 0:11:17,000
Well, maybe not if you live in Boston. (Laughter)

242
0:11:18,000 --> 0:11:21,000
But my point is that we buy insurance

243
0:11:21.303,000 --> 0:11:22,000
to protect ourselves financially

244
0:11:23.286,000 --> 0:11:26,000
in case those things happen, right?

245
0:11:26.489,000 --> 0:11:27,000
So by investing sustainably

246
0:11:28.038,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we're doing two things.

247
0:11:30.257,000 --> 0:11:32,000
We're creating insurance,

248
0:11:32.415,000 --> 0:11:36,000
reducing the risk to our planet and to our economy,

249
0:11:36.661,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and at the same time, in the short term,

250
0:11:38.65,000 --> 0:11:4,000
we're not sacrificing performance.

251
0:11:41.326,000 --> 0:11:45,000
[Man in comic: "What if it's a big hoax and we create a better world for nothing?"]

252
0:11:46.083,000 --> 0:11:48,000
Good, you like it. I like it too.

253
0:11:48.199,000 --> 0:11:49,000
(Laughter)

254
0:11:49.776,000 --> 0:11:51,000
I like it because it pokes fun

255
0:11:51.849,000 --> 0:11:53,000
at both sides of the climate change issue.

256
0:11:54.444,000 --> 0:11:57,000
I bet you can't guess which side I'm on.

257
0:11:57.788,000 --> 0:11:58,000
But what I really like about it

258
0:11:59.527,000 --> 0:12:01,000
is that it reminds me of something Mark Twain said,

259
0:12:02.456,000 --> 0:12:04,000
which is, "Plan for the future,

260
0:12:04.525,000 --> 0:12:05,000
because that's where you're going to spend

261
0:12:06.095,000 --> 0:12:08,000
the rest of your life."

262
0:12:08.596,000 --> 0:12:1,000
Thank you.

263
0:12:10.955,000 --> 0:12:13,000
(Applause)

2
0:00:16.769,000 --> 0:00:18,000
So a friend of mine who's a political scientist,

3
0:00:19.085,000 --> 0:00:2,000
he told me several months ago

4
0:00:20.688,000 --> 0:00:22,000
exactly what this month would be like.

5
0:00:22.756,000 --> 0:00:24,000
He said, you know, there's this fiscal cliff coming,

6
0:00:25.67,000 --> 0:00:28,000
it's going to come at the beginning of 2013.

7
0:00:29.276,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Both parties absolutely need to resolve it,

8
0:00:32.036,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but neither party wants to be seen as the first to resolve it.

9
0:00:34.861,000 --> 0:00:38,000
Neither party has any incentive to solve it a second before it's due,

10
0:00:39.078,000 --> 0:00:41,000
so he said, December, you're just going to see lots of

11
0:00:41.698,000 --> 0:00:44,000
angry negotiations, negotiations breaking apart,

12
0:00:44.918,000 --> 0:00:46,000
reports of phone calls that aren't going well,

13
0:00:47.667,000 --> 0:00:49,000
people saying nothing's happening at all,

14
0:00:49.829,000 --> 0:00:51,000
and then sometime around Christmas or New Year's,

15
0:00:52.375,000 --> 0:00:54,000
we're going to hear, "Okay, they resolved everything."

16
0:00:54.983,000 --> 0:00:58,000
He told me that a few months ago. He said he's 98 percent positive they're going to resolve it,

17
0:00:59.571,000 --> 0:01:01,000
and I got an email from him today saying, all right,

18
0:01:02.005,000 --> 0:01:05,000
we're basically on track, but now I'm 80 percent positive

19
0:01:05.984,000 --> 0:01:06,000
that they're going to resolve it.

20
0:01:07.66,000 --> 0:01:09,000
And it made me think. I love studying

21
0:01:10.204,000 --> 0:01:11,000
these moments in American history

22
0:01:12.197,000 --> 0:01:15,000
when there was this frenzy of partisan anger,

23
0:01:16.097,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that the economy was on the verge of total collapse.

24
0:01:19.238,000 --> 0:01:23,000
The most famous early battle was Alexander Hamilton

25
0:01:23.478,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and Thomas Jefferson over what the dollar would be

26
0:01:27.039,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and how it would be backed up, with Alexander Hamilton

27
0:01:29.36,000 --> 0:01:32,000
saying, "We need a central bank, the First Bank of the United States,

28
0:01:32.604,000 --> 0:01:33,000
or else the dollar will have no value.

29
0:01:34.403,000 --> 0:01:35,000
This economy won't work,"

30
0:01:36.028,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and Thomas Jefferson saying, "The people won't trust that.

31
0:01:38.437,000 --> 0:01:41,000
They just fought off a king. They're not going to accept some central authority."

32
0:01:42.225,000 --> 0:01:47,000
This battle defined the first 150 years of the U.S. economy,

33
0:01:47.747,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and at every moment, different partisans saying,

34
0:01:51.397,000 --> 0:01:53,000
"Oh my God, the economy's about to collapse,"

35
0:01:53.585,000 --> 0:01:55,000
and the rest of us just going about, spending our bucks

36
0:01:55.734,000 --> 0:01:58,000
on whatever it is we wanted to buy.

37
0:01:58.958,000 --> 0:02:,000
To give you a quick primer on where we are,

38
0:02:01.691,000 --> 0:02:02,000
a quick refresher on where we are.

39
0:02:03.47,000 --> 0:02:05,000
So the fiscal cliff, I was told

40
0:02:06.034,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that that's too partisan a thing to say,

41
0:02:08.5,000 --> 0:02:11,000
although I can't remember which party it's supporting or attacking.

42
0:02:11.922,000 --> 0:02:13,000
People say we should call it the fiscal slope,

43
0:02:14.283,000 --> 0:02:16,000
or we should call it an austerity crisis,

44
0:02:16.329,000 --> 0:02:18,000
but then other people say, no, that's even more partisan.

45
0:02:18.715,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So I just call it the self-imposed, self-destructive

46
0:02:21.492,000 --> 0:02:25,000
arbitrary deadline about resolving an inevitable problem.

47
0:02:26.189,000 --> 0:02:29,000
And this is what the inevitable problem looks like.

48
0:02:29.816,000 --> 0:02:33,000
So this is a projection of U.S. debt as a percentage

49
0:02:34.174,000 --> 0:02:36,000
of our overall economy, of GDP.

50
0:02:36.536,000 --> 0:02:39,000
The light blue dotted line represents

51
0:02:39.904,000 --> 0:02:41,000
the Congressional Budget Office's best guess

52
0:02:42.033,000 --> 0:02:46,000
of what will happen if Congress really doesn't do anything,

53
0:02:46.108,000 --> 0:02:49,000
and as you can see, sometime around 2027,

54
0:02:49.624,000 --> 0:02:51,000
we reach Greek levels of debt,

55
0:02:51.912,000 --> 0:02:53,000
somewhere around 130 percent of GDP,

56
0:02:54.8,000 --> 0:02:57,000
which tells you that some time in the next 20 years,

57
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
if Congress does absolutely nothing,

58
0:03:00.53,000 --> 0:03:03,000
we're going to hit a moment where the world's investors,

59
0:03:04.204,000 --> 0:03:05,000
the world's bond buyers, are going to say,

60
0:03:05.805,000 --> 0:03:07,000
"We don't trust America anymore. We're not going to lend them any money,

61
0:03:08.595,000 --> 0:03:1,000
except at really high interest rates."

62
0:03:10.634,000 --> 0:03:12,000
And at that moment our economy collapses.

63
0:03:13.5,000 --> 0:03:14,000
But remember, Greece is there today.

64
0:03:15.349,000 --> 0:03:18,000
We're there in 20 years. We have lots and lots of time

65
0:03:19.251,000 --> 0:03:21,000
to avoid that crisis,

66
0:03:21.472,000 --> 0:03:24,000
and the fiscal cliff was just one more attempt

67
0:03:25.167,000 --> 0:03:28,000
at trying to force the two sides to resolve the crisis.

68
0:03:28.704,000 --> 0:03:31,000
Here's another way to look at exactly the same problem.

69
0:03:32.112,000 --> 0:03:34,000
The dark blue line is how much the government spends.

70
0:03:35.056,000 --> 0:03:38,000
The light blue line is how much the government gets in.

71
0:03:38.513,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And as you can see, for most of recent history,

72
0:03:41.273,000 --> 0:03:44,000
except for a brief period, we have consistently spent

73
0:03:44.905,000 --> 0:03:47,000
more than we take in. Thus the national debt.

74
0:03:48.105,000 --> 0:03:51,000
But as you can also see, projected going forward,

75
0:03:51.984,000 --> 0:03:54,000
the gap widens a bit and raises a bit,

76
0:03:55,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and this graph is only through 2021.

77
0:03:57.049,000 --> 0:04:,000
It gets really, really ugly out towards 2030.

78
0:04:00.712,000 --> 0:04:04,000
And this graph sort of sums up what the problem is.

79
0:04:04.837,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The Democrats, they say, well, this isn't a big deal.

80
0:04:07.926,000 --> 0:04:11,000
We can just raise taxes a bit and close that gap,

81
0:04:12.044,000 --> 0:04:14,000
especially if we raise taxes on the rich.

82
0:04:14.3,000 --> 0:04:16,000
The Republicans say, hey, no, no, we've got a better idea.

83
0:04:16.923,000 --> 0:04:17,000
Why don't we lower both lines?

84
0:04:18.362,000 --> 0:04:21,000
Why don't we lower government spending and lower government taxes,

85
0:04:22.317,000 --> 0:04:25,000
and then we'll be on an even more favorable

86
0:04:25.766,000 --> 0:04:27,000
long-term deficit trajectory?

87
0:04:28.245,000 --> 0:04:32,000
And behind this powerful disagreement between

88
0:04:32.824,000 --> 0:04:33,000
how to close that gap,

89
0:04:34.604,000 --> 0:04:37,000
there's the worst kind of cynical party politics,

90
0:04:37.989,000 --> 0:04:42,000
the worst kind of insider baseball, lobbying, all of that stuff,

91
0:04:43.362,000 --> 0:04:47,000
but there's also this powerfully interesting,

92
0:04:47.623,000 --> 0:04:49,000
respectful disagreement between

93
0:04:50.056,000 --> 0:04:53,000
two fundamentally different economic philosophies.

94
0:04:53.583,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And I like to think, when I picture how Republicans

95
0:04:58.406,000 --> 0:05:03,000
see the economy, what I picture is just some amazingly

96
0:05:03.537,000 --> 0:05:06,000
well-engineered machine, some perfect machine.

97
0:05:06.848,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Unfortunately, I picture it made in Germany or Japan,

98
0:05:11.326,000 --> 0:05:13,000
but this amazing machine that's constantly scouring

99
0:05:14.179,000 --> 0:05:19,000
every bit of human endeavor and taking resources,

100
0:05:19.275,000 --> 0:05:21,000
money, labor, capital, machinery,

101
0:05:21.624,000 --> 0:05:25,000
away from the least productive parts and towards the more productive parts,

102
0:05:25.874,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and while this might cause temporary dislocation,

103
0:05:27.47,000 --> 0:05:3,000
what it does is it builds up the more productive areas

104
0:05:30.964,000 --> 0:05:32,000
and lets the less productive areas fade away and die,

105
0:05:33.594,000 --> 0:05:35,000
and as a result the whole system is so much more efficient,

106
0:05:36.37,000 --> 0:05:38,000
so much richer for everybody.

107
0:05:38.708,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And this view generally believes that there is a role for government,

108
0:05:42.621,000 --> 0:05:44,000
a small role, to set the rules so people aren't lying

109
0:05:45.441,000 --> 0:05:47,000
and cheating and hurting each other,

110
0:05:47.69,000 --> 0:05:5,000
maybe, you know, have a police force and a fire department

111
0:05:50.994,000 --> 0:05:53,000
and an army, but to have a very limited reach

112
0:05:53.994,000 --> 0:05:56,000
into the mechanisms of this machinery.

113
0:05:56.994,000 --> 0:06:,000
And when I picture how Democrats and Democratic-leaning

114
0:06:01.17,000 --> 0:06:03,000
economists picture this economy,

115
0:06:04.138,000 --> 0:06:06,000
most Democratic economists are, you know, they're capitalists,

116
0:06:06.694,000 --> 0:06:08,000
they believe, yes, that's a good system a lot of the time.

117
0:06:09.434,000 --> 0:06:13,000
It's good to let markets move resources to their more productive use.

118
0:06:13.554,000 --> 0:06:16,000
But that system has tons of problems.

119
0:06:17.47,000 --> 0:06:19,000
Wealth piles up in the wrong places.

120
0:06:19.799,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Wealth is ripped away from people who shouldn't be called unproductive.

121
0:06:24.073,000 --> 0:06:26,000
That's not going to create an equitable, fair society.

122
0:06:26.941,000 --> 0:06:28,000
That machine doesn't care about the environment,

123
0:06:29.813,000 --> 0:06:31,000
about racism, about all these issues

124
0:06:31.879,000 --> 0:06:33,000
that make this life worse for all of us,

125
0:06:34.677,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and so the government does have a role to take resources

126
0:06:37.756,000 --> 0:06:4,000
from more productive uses, or from richer sources,

127
0:06:41.037,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and give them to other sources.

128
0:06:43.705,000 --> 0:06:48,000
And when you think about the economy through these two different lenses,

129
0:06:48.76,000 --> 0:06:52,000
you understand why this crisis is so hard to solve,

130
0:06:52.818,000 --> 0:06:55,000
because the worse the crisis gets, the higher the stakes are,

131
0:06:56.807,000 --> 0:06:58,000
the more each side thinks they know the answer

132
0:06:59.575,000 --> 0:07:02,000
and the other side is just going to ruin everything.

133
0:07:02.928,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And I can get really despairing. I've spent a lot

134
0:07:06.063,000 --> 0:07:09,000
of the last few years really depressed about this,

135
0:07:09.126,000 --> 0:07:12,000
until this year, I learned something that

136
0:07:12.175,000 --> 0:07:15,000
I felt really excited about. I feel like it's really good news,

137
0:07:15.655,000 --> 0:07:17,000
and it's so shocking, I don't like saying it, because I think

138
0:07:18.516,000 --> 0:07:19,000
people won't believe me.

139
0:07:20.021,000 --> 0:07:21,000
But here's what I learned.

140
0:07:21.339,000 --> 0:07:23,000
The American people, taken as a whole,

141
0:07:23.759,000 --> 0:07:26,000
when it comes to these issues, to fiscal issues,

142
0:07:26.959,000 --> 0:07:29,000
are moderate, pragmatic centrists.

143
0:07:30.682,000 --> 0:07:32,000
And I know that's hard to believe, that the American people

144
0:07:32.947,000 --> 0:07:33,000
are moderate, pragmatic centrists.

145
0:07:34.38,000 --> 0:07:36,000
But let me explain what I'm thinking.

146
0:07:36.961,000 --> 0:07:39,000
When you look at how the federal government spends money,

147
0:07:40.258,000 --> 0:07:42,000
so this is the battle right here,

148
0:07:42.832,000 --> 0:07:44,000
55 percent, more than half, is on Social Security,

149
0:07:45.525,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Medicare, Medicaid, a few other health programs,

150
0:07:47.893,000 --> 0:07:5,000
20 percent defense, 19 percent discretionary,

151
0:07:50.912,000 --> 0:07:51,000
and six percent interest.

152
0:07:52.818,000 --> 0:07:56,000
So when we're talking about cutting government spending,

153
0:07:57.536,000 --> 0:07:59,000
this is the pie we're talking about,

154
0:07:59.542,000 --> 0:08:02,000
and Americans overwhelmingly, and it doesn't matter

155
0:08:03.129,000 --> 0:08:06,000
what party they're in, overwhelmingly like

156
0:08:06.662,000 --> 0:08:08,000
that big 55 percent chunk.

157
0:08:09.101,000 --> 0:08:1,000
They like Social Security. They like Medicare.

158
0:08:11.093,000 --> 0:08:14,000
They even like Medicaid, even though that goes to the poor and indigent,

159
0:08:14.621,000 --> 0:08:16,000
which you might think would have less support.

160
0:08:17.045,000 --> 0:08:2,000
And they do not want it fundamentally touched,

161
0:08:20.996,000 --> 0:08:24,000
although the American people are remarkably comfortable,

162
0:08:25.187,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and Democrats roughly equal to Republicans,

163
0:08:28.099,000 --> 0:08:32,000
with some minor tweaks to make the system more stable.

164
0:08:32.864,000 --> 0:08:34,000
Social Security is fairly easy to fix.

165
0:08:35.625,000 --> 0:08:38,000
The rumors of its demise are always greatly exaggerated.

166
0:08:39.409,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So gradually raise Social Security retirement age,

167
0:08:41.703,000 --> 0:08:43,000
maybe only on people not yet born.

168
0:08:44.076,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Americans are about 50/50,

169
0:08:46.501,000 --> 0:08:47,000
whether they're Democrats or Republicans.

170
0:08:48.497,000 --> 0:08:5,000
Reduce Medicare for very wealthy seniors,

171
0:08:50.849,000 --> 0:08:53,000
seniors who make a lot of money. Don't even eliminate it. Just reduce it.

172
0:08:54.17,000 --> 0:08:59,000
People generally are comfortable with it, Democrats and Republicans.

173
0:08:59.185,000 --> 0:09:01,000
Raise medical health care contributions?

174
0:09:01.492,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Everyone hates that equally, but Republicans

175
0:09:03.921,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and Democrats hate that together.

176
0:09:06.593,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And so what this tells me is, when you look at

177
0:09:09.707,000 --> 0:09:12,000
the discussion of how to resolve our fiscal problems,

178
0:09:13.537,000 --> 0:09:2,000
we are not a nation that's powerfully divided on the major, major issue.

179
0:09:20.922,000 --> 0:09:23,000
We're comfortable with it needing some tweaks, but we want to keep it.

180
0:09:24.203,000 --> 0:09:26,000
We're not open to a discussion of eliminating it.

181
0:09:26.998,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Now there is one issue that is hyper-partisan,

182
0:09:31.284,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and where there is one party that is just spend, spend, spend,

183
0:09:34.766,000 --> 0:09:35,000
we don't care, spend some more,

184
0:09:36.649,000 --> 0:09:37,000
and that of course is Republicans

185
0:09:38.555,000 --> 0:09:39,000
when it comes to military defense spending.

186
0:09:40.535,000 --> 0:09:42,000
They way outweigh Democrats.

187
0:09:43.03,000 --> 0:09:47,000
The vast majority want to protect military defense spending.

188
0:09:47.825,000 --> 0:09:49,000
That's 20 percent of the budget,

189
0:09:50.046,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and that presents a more difficult issue.

190
0:09:53.729,000 --> 0:09:55,000
I should also note that the [discretionary] spending,

191
0:09:56.654,000 --> 0:09:58,000
which is about 19 percent of the budget,

192
0:09:58.788,000 --> 0:10:,000
that is Democratic and Republican issues,

193
0:10:01.158,000 --> 0:10:03,000
so you do have welfare, food stamps, other programs

194
0:10:03.526,000 --> 0:10:05,000
that tend to be popular among Democrats,

195
0:10:05.56,000 --> 0:10:07,000
but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Interior

196
0:10:08.525,000 --> 0:10:1,000
inducements for oil drilling and other things,

197
0:10:11.47,000 --> 0:10:14,000
which tend to be popular among Republicans.

198
0:10:15.085,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Now when it comes to taxes, there is more disagreement.

199
0:10:18.409,000 --> 0:10:19,000
That's a more partisan area.

200
0:10:20.273,000 --> 0:10:23,000
You have Democrats overwhelmingly supportive

201
0:10:23.667,000 --> 0:10:27,000
of raising the income tax on people who make 250,000 dollars a year,

202
0:10:27.716,000 --> 0:10:32,000
Republicans sort of against it, although if you break it out by income,

203
0:10:32.956,000 --> 0:10:36,000
Republicans who make less than 75,000 dollars a year like this idea.

204
0:10:37.649,000 --> 0:10:41,000
So basically Republicans who make more than 250,000 dollars a year don't want to be taxed.

205
0:10:42.004,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Raising taxes on investment income, you also see

206
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
about two thirds of Democrats but only one third of Republicans

207
0:10:48.124,000 --> 0:10:51,000
are comfortable with that idea.

208
0:10:51.923,000 --> 0:10:54,000
This brings up a really important point, which is that

209
0:10:54.948,000 --> 0:10:56,000
we tend in this country to talk about Democrats

210
0:10:57.564,000 --> 0:10:58,000
and Republicans and think there's this little group

211
0:10:59.375,000 --> 0:11:01,000
over there called independents that's, what, two percent?

212
0:11:01.74,000 --> 0:11:03,000
If you add Democrats, you add Republicans,

213
0:11:03.852,000 --> 0:11:04,000
you've got the American people.

214
0:11:05.346,000 --> 0:11:07,000
But that is not the case at all.

215
0:11:08.292,000 --> 0:11:13,000
And it has not been the case for most of modern American history.

216
0:11:13.437,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Roughly a third of Americans say that they are Democrats.

217
0:11:17.254,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Around a quarter say that they are Republicans.

218
0:11:20.103,000 --> 0:11:24,000
A tiny little sliver call themselves libertarians, or socialists,

219
0:11:24.583,000 --> 0:11:26,000
or some other small third party,

220
0:11:27.27,000 --> 0:11:32,000
and the largest block, 40 percent, say they're independents.

221
0:11:32.477,000 --> 0:11:34,000
So most Americans are not partisan,

222
0:11:35.398,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and most of the people in the independent camp

223
0:11:37.566,000 --> 0:11:4,000
fall somewhere in between, so even though we have

224
0:11:41.257,000 --> 0:11:44,000
tremendous overlap between the views on these fiscal issues

225
0:11:44.817,000 --> 0:11:46,000
of Democrats and Republicans,

226
0:11:47.113,000 --> 0:11:5,000
we have even more overlap when you add in the independents.

227
0:11:50.905,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Now we get to fight about all sorts of other issues.

228
0:11:54.145,000 --> 0:11:56,000
We get to hate each other on gun control

229
0:11:56.258,000 --> 0:11:58,000
and abortion and the environment,

230
0:11:58.538,000 --> 0:12:,000
but on these fiscal issues, these important fiscal issues,

231
0:12:01.41,000 --> 0:12:04,000
we just are not anywhere nearly as divided as people say.

232
0:12:05.242,000 --> 0:12:07,000
And in fact, there's this other group of people

233
0:12:07.274,000 --> 0:12:1,000
who are not as divided as people might think,

234
0:12:10.612,000 --> 0:12:12,000
and that group is economists.

235
0:12:12.625,000 --> 0:12:17,000
I talk to a lot of economists, and back in the '70s

236
0:12:17.928,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and '80s it was ugly being an economist.

237
0:12:21.026,000 --> 0:12:24,000
You were in what they called the saltwater camp,

238
0:12:24.201,000 --> 0:12:28,000
meaning Harvard, Princeton, MIT, Stanford, Berkeley,

239
0:12:28.815,000 --> 0:12:3,000
or you were in the freshwater camp, University of Chicago,

240
0:12:31.783,000 --> 0:12:32,000
University of Rochester.

241
0:12:33.235,000 --> 0:12:35,000
You were a free market capitalist economist

242
0:12:36.231,000 --> 0:12:38,000
or you were a Keynesian liberal economist,

243
0:12:38.364,000 --> 0:12:4,000
and these people didn't go to each other's weddings,

244
0:12:40.539,000 --> 0:12:41,000
they snubbed each other at conferences.

245
0:12:42.431,000 --> 0:12:45,000
It's still ugly to this day, but in my experience,

246
0:12:45.44,000 --> 0:12:48,000
it is really, really hard to find an economist under 40

247
0:12:49.041,000 --> 0:12:53,000
who still has that kind of way of seeing the world.

248
0:12:53.065,000 --> 0:12:55,000
The vast majority of economists -- it is so uncool

249
0:12:56.017,000 --> 0:12:58,000
to call yourself an ideologue of either camp.

250
0:12:58.858,000 --> 0:13:,000
The phrase that you want, if you're a graduate student

251
0:13:01.379,000 --> 0:13:03,000
or a postdoc or you're a professor,

252
0:13:03.906,000 --> 0:13:05,000
a 38-year-old economics professor, is, "I'm an empiricist.

253
0:13:06.883,000 --> 0:13:07,000
I go by the data."

254
0:13:08.427,000 --> 0:13:1,000
And the data is very clear.

255
0:13:10.831,000 --> 0:13:14,000
None of these major theories have been completely successful.

256
0:13:14.852,000 --> 0:13:15,000
The 20th century, the last hundred years,

257
0:13:16.5,000 --> 0:13:18,000
is riddled with disastrous examples

258
0:13:19.451,000 --> 0:13:22,000
of times that one school or the other tried to explain

259
0:13:23.123,000 --> 0:13:25,000
the past or predict the future

260
0:13:25.443,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and just did an awful, awful job,

261
0:13:27.329,000 --> 0:13:32,000
so the economics profession has acquired some degree of modesty.

262
0:13:32.518,000 --> 0:13:35,000
They still are an awfully arrogant group of people, I will assure you,

263
0:13:36.112,000 --> 0:13:38,000
but they're now arrogant about their impartiality,

264
0:13:38.989,000 --> 0:13:44,000
and they, too, see a tremendous range of potential outcomes.

265
0:13:45.78,000 --> 0:13:5,000
And this nonpartisanship is something that exists,

266
0:13:50.88,000 --> 0:13:51,000
that has existed in secret

267
0:13:52.619,000 --> 0:13:53,000
in America for years and years and years.

268
0:13:54.335,000 --> 0:13:57,000
I've spent a lot of the fall talking to the three major

269
0:13:58.299,000 --> 0:14:01,000
organizations that survey American political attitudes:

270
0:14:02.195,000 --> 0:14:03,000
Pew Research,

271
0:14:03.749,000 --> 0:14:06,000
the University of Chicago's National Opinion Research Center,

272
0:14:07.397,000 --> 0:14:09,000
and the most important but the least known

273
0:14:10.245,000 --> 0:14:12,000
is the American National Election Studies group

274
0:14:13.22,000 --> 0:14:17,000
that is the world's longest, most respected poll of political attitudes.

275
0:14:17.566,000 --> 0:14:18,000
They've been doing it since 1948,

276
0:14:19.528,000 --> 0:14:22,000
and what they show consistently throughout

277
0:14:23.015,000 --> 0:14:27,000
is that it's almost impossible to find Americans

278
0:14:27.462,000 --> 0:14:3,000
who are consistent ideologically,

279
0:14:30.623,000 --> 0:14:33,000
who consistently support, "No we mustn't tax,

280
0:14:34.359,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and we must limit the size of government,"

281
0:14:37.039,000 --> 0:14:4,000
or, "No, we must encourage government to play a larger role

282
0:14:40.739,000 --> 0:14:43,000
in redistribution and correcting the ills of capitalism."

283
0:14:44.735,000 --> 0:14:45,000
Those groups are very, very small.

284
0:14:46.613,000 --> 0:14:48,000
The vast majority of people, they pick and choose,

285
0:14:49.609,000 --> 0:14:51,000
they see compromise and they change over time

286
0:14:52.173,000 --> 0:14:54,000
when they hear a better argument or a worse argument.

287
0:14:54.706,000 --> 0:14:57,000
And that part of it has not changed.

288
0:14:58.067,000 --> 0:15:01,000
What has changed is how people respond to vague questions.

289
0:15:02.02,000 --> 0:15:04,000
If you ask people vague questions, like,

290
0:15:04.618,000 --> 0:15:06,000
"Do you think there should be more government or less government?"

291
0:15:07.61,000 --> 0:15:11,000
"Do you think government should" — especially if you use loaded language --

292
0:15:11.924,000 --> 0:15:13,000
"Do you think the government should provide handouts?"

293
0:15:14.403,000 --> 0:15:15,000
Or, "Do you think the government should redistribute?"

294
0:15:16.332,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Then you can see radical partisan change.

295
0:15:18.933,000 --> 0:15:2,000
But when you get specific, when you actually ask

296
0:15:21.627,000 --> 0:15:25,000
about the actual taxing and spending issues under consideration,

297
0:15:25.667,000 --> 0:15:27,000
people are remarkably centrist,

298
0:15:28.275,000 --> 0:15:3,000
they're remarkably open to compromise.

299
0:15:31.14,000 --> 0:15:34,000
So what we have, then, when you think about the fiscal cliff,

300
0:15:34.925,000 --> 0:15:38,000
don't think of it as the American people fundamentally

301
0:15:39.451,000 --> 0:15:41,000
can't stand each other on these issues

302
0:15:41.627,000 --> 0:15:42,000
and that we must be ripped apart

303
0:15:43.182,000 --> 0:15:45,000
into two separate warring nations.

304
0:15:45.504,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Think of it as a tiny, tiny number of ancient economists

305
0:15:51.43,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and misrepresentative ideologues have captured the process.

306
0:15:55.276,000 --> 0:15:57,000
And they've captured the process through familiar ways,

307
0:15:57.852,000 --> 0:15:59,000
through a primary system which encourages

308
0:16:00.804,000 --> 0:16:02,000
that small group of people's voices,

309
0:16:03.036,000 --> 0:16:05,000
because that small group of people,

310
0:16:05.141,000 --> 0:16:08,000
the people who answer all yeses or all noes

311
0:16:08.213,000 --> 0:16:1,000
on those ideological questions,

312
0:16:10.62,000 --> 0:16:12,000
they might be small but every one of them has a blog,

313
0:16:13.227,000 --> 0:16:16,000
every one of them has been on Fox or MSNBC in the last week.

314
0:16:16.981,000 --> 0:16:19,000
Every one of them becomes a louder and louder voice,

315
0:16:20.134,000 --> 0:16:22,000
but they don't represent us.

316
0:16:22.266,000 --> 0:16:25,000
They don't represent what our views are.

317
0:16:25.367,000 --> 0:16:26,000
And that gets me back to the dollar,

318
0:16:27.173,000 --> 0:16:3,000
and it gets me back to reminding myself that

319
0:16:30.398,000 --> 0:16:32,000
we know this experience.

320
0:16:32.408,000 --> 0:16:33,000
We know what it's like

321
0:16:34.053,000 --> 0:16:39,000
to have these people on TV, in Congress,

322
0:16:39.408,000 --> 0:16:41,000
yelling about how the end of the world is coming

323
0:16:42.135,000 --> 0:16:45,000
if we don't adopt their view completely,

324
0:16:45.361,000 --> 0:16:46,000
because it's happened about the dollar

325
0:16:47.355,000 --> 0:16:49,000
ever since there's been a dollar.

326
0:16:49.358,000 --> 0:16:52,000
We had the battle between Jefferson and Hamilton.

327
0:16:53.252,000 --> 0:16:57,000
In 1913, we had this ugly battle over the Federal Reserve,

328
0:16:57.922,000 --> 0:17:,000
when it was created, with vicious, angry arguments

329
0:17:01.796,000 --> 0:17:02,000
over how it would be constituted,

330
0:17:03.668,000 --> 0:17:04,000
and a general agreement that the way it was constituted

331
0:17:05.445,000 --> 0:17:07,000
was the worst possible compromise,

332
0:17:08.352,000 --> 0:17:11,000
a compromise guaranteed to destroy this valuable thing,

333
0:17:11.712,000 --> 0:17:13,000
this dollar, but then everyone agreeing, okay,

334
0:17:14.069,000 --> 0:17:16,000
so long as we're on the gold standard, it should be okay.

335
0:17:16.58,000 --> 0:17:18,000
The Fed can't mess it up so badly.

336
0:17:18.63,000 --> 0:17:22,000
But then we got off the gold standard for individuals

337
0:17:22.767,000 --> 0:17:24,000
during the Depression and we got off the gold standard

338
0:17:25.181,000 --> 0:17:29,000
as a source of international currency coordination

339
0:17:29.279,000 --> 0:17:31,000
during Richard Nixon's presidency.

340
0:17:31.511,000 --> 0:17:34,000
Each of those times, we were on the verge of complete collapse.

341
0:17:35.484,000 --> 0:17:37,000
And nothing happened at all.

342
0:17:37.638,000 --> 0:17:38,000
Throughout it all, the dollar has been

343
0:17:39.576,000 --> 0:17:41,000
one of the most long-standing,

344
0:17:41.884,000 --> 0:17:43,000
stable, reasonable currencies,

345
0:17:44.019,000 --> 0:17:46,000
and we all use it every single day,

346
0:17:46.186,000 --> 0:17:49,000
no matter what the people screaming about tell us,

347
0:17:49.211,000 --> 0:17:52,000
no matter how scared we're supposed to be.

348
0:17:52.255,000 --> 0:17:55,000
And this long-term fiscal picture that we're in right now,

349
0:17:56.2,000 --> 0:17:59,000
I think what is most maddening about it is,

350
0:18:00.129,000 --> 0:18:03,000
if Congress were simply able

351
0:18:04.068,000 --> 0:18:06,000
to show not that they agree with each other,

352
0:18:06.441,000 --> 0:18:09,000
not that they're able to come up with the best possible compromise,

353
0:18:09.721,000 --> 0:18:12,000
but that they are able to just begin the process

354
0:18:12.803,000 --> 0:18:16,000
towards compromise, we all instantly are better off.

355
0:18:17.284,000 --> 0:18:21,000
The fear is that the world is watching.

356
0:18:21.418,000 --> 0:18:24,000
The fear is that the longer we delay any solution,

357
0:18:24.875,000 --> 0:18:25,000
the more the world will look to the U.S.

358
0:18:26.663,000 --> 0:18:29,000
not as the bedrock of stability in the global economy,

359
0:18:30.283,000 --> 0:18:33,000
but as a place that can't resolve its own fights,

360
0:18:33.858,000 --> 0:18:36,000
and the longer we put that off, the more we make the world nervous,

361
0:18:37.684,000 --> 0:18:38,000
the higher interest rates are going to be,

362
0:18:39.467,000 --> 0:18:41,000
the quicker we're going to have to face a day

363
0:18:42.171,000 --> 0:18:44,000
of horrible calamity.

364
0:18:44.278,000 --> 0:18:47,000
And so just the act of compromise itself,

365
0:18:47.842,000 --> 0:18:48,000
and sustained, real compromise,

366
0:18:49.743,000 --> 0:18:5,000
would give us even more time,

367
0:18:51.557,000 --> 0:18:53,000
would allow both sides even longer to spread out the pain

368
0:18:54.519,000 --> 0:18:56,000
and reach even more compromise down the road.

369
0:18:57.154,000 --> 0:19:,000
So I'm in the media. I feel like my job to make this happen

370
0:19:00.266,000 --> 0:19:04,000
is to help foster the things that seem to lead to compromise,

371
0:19:04.559,000 --> 0:19:08,000
to not talk about this in those vague and scary terms

372
0:19:08.671,000 --> 0:19:09,000
that do polarize us,

373
0:19:10.232,000 --> 0:19:12,000
but to just talk about it like what it is,

374
0:19:12.841,000 --> 0:19:13,000
not an existential crisis,

375
0:19:14.784,000 --> 0:19:18,000
not some battle between two fundamentally different religious views,

376
0:19:19.757,000 --> 0:19:21,000
but a math problem, a really solvable math problem,

377
0:19:22.359,000 --> 0:19:24,000
one where we're not all going to get what we want

378
0:19:24.435,000 --> 0:19:27,000
and one where, you know, there's going to be a little pain to spread around.

379
0:19:28.39,000 --> 0:19:31,000
But the more we address it as a practical concern,

380
0:19:31.905,000 --> 0:19:32,000
the sooner we can resolve it,

381
0:19:33.416,000 --> 0:19:36,000
and the more time we have to resolve it, paradoxically.

382
0:19:36.883,000 --> 0:19:4,000
Thank you. (Applause)

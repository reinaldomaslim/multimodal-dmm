1
0:00:13.437,000 --> 0:00:15,000
For the last two and a half years,

2
0:00:15.841,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm one of the few, if not the only, child psychiatrist

3
0:00:19.286,000 --> 0:00:22,000
operating in refugee camps, shorelines and rescue boats

4
0:00:22.815,000 --> 0:00:24,000
in Greece and the Mediterranean Sea.

5
0:00:25.41,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And I can say, with great confidence,

6
0:00:27.673,000 --> 0:00:3,000
that we are witnessing a mental-health catastrophe

7
0:00:31.149,000 --> 0:00:34,000
that will affect most of us, and it will change our world.

8
0:00:35.784,000 --> 0:00:38,000
I live in Haifa, but nowadays, I spend most of my time abroad.

9
0:00:40.204,000 --> 0:00:42,000
During my time on the Greek island of Lesbos

10
0:00:43.204,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and on the rescue boats in the Mediterranean,

11
0:00:45.617,000 --> 0:00:48,000
thousands of refugee boats arrived to the shoreline,

12
0:00:48.696,000 --> 0:00:51,000
crowded with more than 1.5 million refugees.

13
0:00:52.173,000 --> 0:00:54,000
One-fourth of them are children,

14
0:00:54.259,000 --> 0:00:55,000
fleeing war and hardship.

15
0:00:56.331,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Each boat carries different sufferings and traumas

16
0:00:59.823,000 --> 0:01:02,000
from Syria, Iraq, Afganistan and different countries in Africa.

17
0:01:04.116,000 --> 0:01:05,000
In the last three years alone,

18
0:01:05.976,000 --> 0:01:08,000
more than 12,000 refugees lost their lives.

19
0:01:09.379,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And hundreds of thousands lost their souls and their mental health

20
0:01:13.236,000 --> 0:01:15,000
due to this cruel and traumatic experience.

21
0:01:17.203,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I want to tell you about Omar,

22
0:01:19.522,000 --> 0:01:21,000
a five-year-old Syrian refugee boy

23
0:01:21.569,000 --> 0:01:24,000
who arrived to the shore on Lesbos on a crowded rubber boat.

24
0:01:26.204,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Crying, frightened, unable to understand what's happening to him,

25
0:01:29.617,000 --> 0:01:32,000
he was right on the verge of developing a new trauma.

26
0:01:33.077,000 --> 0:01:35,000
I knew right away that this was a golden hour,

27
0:01:35.95,000 --> 0:01:38,000
a short period of time in which I could change his story,

28
0:01:39.506,000 --> 0:01:4,000
I could change the story

29
0:01:41.03,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that he would tell himself for the rest of his life.

30
0:01:43.958,000 --> 0:01:46,000
I could reframe his memories.

31
0:01:47.99,000 --> 0:01:51,000
I quickly held out my hands and said to his shaking mother in Arabic,

32
0:01:52.527,000 --> 0:01:53,000
(Arabic) "Ateeni elwalad o khudi nafas."

33
0:01:54.507,000 --> 0:01:55,000
"Give me the boy, and take a breath."

34
0:01:56.887,000 --> 0:01:57,000
His mother gave him to me.

35
0:01:59.49,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Omar looked at me with scared, tearful eyes and said,

36
0:02:03.688,000 --> 0:02:05,000
(Arabic) "Ammo (uncle in Arabic), shu hada?"

37
0:02:06.56,000 --> 0:02:07,000
"What is this?"

38
0:02:07.761,000 --> 0:02:1,000
as he pointed out to the police helicopter hovering above us.

39
0:02:12.061,000 --> 0:02:13,000
"It's a helicopter!

40
0:02:13.466,000 --> 0:02:15,000
It's here to photograph you with big cameras,

41
0:02:15.856,000 --> 0:02:17,000
because only the great and the powerful heroes,

42
0:02:18.691,000 --> 0:02:2,000
like you, Omar, can cross the sea."

43
0:02:22.413,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Omar looked at me, stopped crying and asked me,

44
0:02:27.657,000 --> 0:02:28,000
(Arabic) "Ana batal?"

45
0:02:28.872,000 --> 0:02:3,000
"I'm a hero?"

46
0:02:32.061,000 --> 0:02:34,000
I talked to Omar for 15 minutes.

47
0:02:34.577,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And I gave his parents some guidance to follow.

48
0:02:37.3,000 --> 0:02:38,000
This short psychological intervention

49
0:02:39.229,000 --> 0:02:42,000
decreases the prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder

50
0:02:42.665,000 --> 0:02:44,000
and other mental health issues in the future,

51
0:02:45.173,000 --> 0:02:47,000
preparing Omar to get an education,

52
0:02:47.625,000 --> 0:02:5,000
join the workforce, raise a family and beyond.

53
0:02:50.688,000 --> 0:02:51,000
How?

54
0:02:51.866,000 --> 0:02:54,000
By stimulating the good memories that will be stored in the amygdala,

55
0:02:55.146,000 --> 0:02:57,000
the emotional storage of the human brain.

56
0:02:57.29,000 --> 0:02:59,000
These memories will fight the traumatic ones,

57
0:02:59.442,000 --> 0:03:01,000
if they are reactivated in the future.

58
0:03:02.532,000 --> 0:03:04,000
To Omar, the smell of the sea will not just remind him

59
0:03:05.319,000 --> 0:03:07,000
of his traumatic journey from Syria.

60
0:03:07.501,000 --> 0:03:11,000
Because to Omar, this story is now a story of bravery.

61
0:03:12.45,000 --> 0:03:14,000
This is the power of the golden hour,

62
0:03:14.617,000 --> 0:03:17,000
which can reframe the trauma and establish a new narrative.

63
0:03:19.442,000 --> 0:03:25,000
But Omar is only one out of more than 350,000 children

64
0:03:25.674,000 --> 0:03:29,000
without the proper mental health support in this crisis alone.

65
0:03:30.284,000 --> 0:03:33,000
Three hundred and fifty thousand children and me.

66
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We need mental health professionals

67
0:03:38.634,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to join rescue teams during times of active crisis.

68
0:03:42.563,000 --> 0:03:46,000
This is why my wife and I and friends co-founded "Humanity Crew."

69
0:03:48.193,000 --> 0:03:5,000
One of the few aid organizations in the world

70
0:03:50.345,000 --> 0:03:52,000
that specializes in providing psychosocial aid

71
0:03:52.988,000 --> 0:03:54,000
and first-response mental health interventions

72
0:03:55.593,000 --> 0:03:57,000
to refugees and displaced populations.

73
0:03:58.252,000 --> 0:04:,000
To provide them with a suitable intervention,

74
0:04:01.03,000 --> 0:04:04,000
we create the four-step approach, a psychosocial work plan

75
0:04:04.482,000 --> 0:04:07,000
that follows the refugees on each step of their journey.

76
0:04:08.371,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Starting inside the sea, on the rescue boats,

77
0:04:12.625,000 --> 0:04:14,000
as mental health lifeguards.

78
0:04:14.744,000 --> 0:04:18,000
Later in the camps, hospitals and through our online clinic

79
0:04:19.538,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that breaks down borders and overcomes languages.

80
0:04:22.792,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And ending in the asylum countries, helping them integrate.

81
0:04:26.514,000 --> 0:04:28,000
Since our first mission in 2015,

82
0:04:29.466,000 --> 0:04:31,000
"Humanity Crew" had 194 delegations

83
0:04:32.307,000 --> 0:04:34,000
of qualified, trained volunteers and therapists.

84
0:04:35.275,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We have provided 26,000 hours of mental health support

85
0:04:39.458,000 --> 0:04:4,000
to over 10,000 refugees.

86
0:04:42.006,000 --> 0:04:46,000
We can all do something to prevent this mental health catastrophe.

87
0:04:47.387,000 --> 0:04:51,000
We need to acknowledge that first aid is not just needed for the body,

88
0:04:52.052,000 --> 0:04:55,000
but it has also to include the mind, the soul.

89
0:04:55.195,000 --> 0:04:57,000
The impact on the soul is hardly visible,

90
0:04:57.727,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but the damage can be there for life.

91
0:05:00.68,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Let's not forget that what distinguishes us humans from machines

92
0:05:05.089,000 --> 0:05:08,000
is the beautiful and the delicate soul within us.

93
0:05:10.061,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Let's try harder to save more Omars.

94
0:05:13.72,000 --> 0:05:14,000
Thank you.

95
0:05:14.905,000 --> 0:05:17,000
(Applause)

96
0:05:18.251,000 --> 0:05:2,000
(Cheers)

97
0:05:20.364,000 --> 0:05:22,000
(Applause)

0:00:16.77,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In 1969, I was standing behind

3
0:00:21.103,000 --> 0:00:23,000
a Sylvania black-and-white television set.

4
0:00:24.64,000 --> 0:00:27,000
Hearing about these things happening on the set in the front,

5
0:00:27.824,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I was the guy, you know,

6
0:00:28.999,000 --> 0:00:31,000
moving the rabbit ears for my dad, and my sister and my mom.

7
0:00:32.134,000 --> 0:00:35,000
"Move over here, turn over here, move this way, we can't see the screen."

8
0:00:36.213,000 --> 0:00:38,000
And what they were watching

9
0:00:38.276,000 --> 0:00:43,000
was: "One small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."

10
0:00:43.546,000 --> 0:00:46,000
Neil [Armstrong] and Buzz Aldrin were walking on the Moon.

11
0:00:47.308,000 --> 0:00:5,000
And I was five years old in Lynchburg, Virginia,

12
0:00:51.173,000 --> 0:00:54,000
a skinny black kid in a kind of somewhat racist town.

13
0:00:55.303,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And I was trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life.

14
0:01:00.366,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And my parents, you know, they were educators,

15
0:01:02.756,000 --> 0:01:04,000
they'd said that you can do anything.

16
0:01:05.094,000 --> 0:01:08,000
But after that moon landing, all the kids in the neighborhood

17
0:01:08.13,000 --> 0:01:1,000
were like, "You're going to be an astronaut?"

18
0:01:10.288,000 --> 0:01:11,000
I'm like, "No."

19
0:01:11.514,000 --> 0:01:14,000
I don't want a buzz cut, and I don't see someone who looks like me.

20
0:01:14.717,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Because representation does matter.

21
0:01:16.443,000 --> 0:01:19,000
And I knew that there was a guy

22
0:01:20.284,000 --> 0:01:23,000
five blocks down the street on Pierce Street

23
0:01:23.387,000 --> 0:01:25,000
who was training to play tennis.

24
0:01:25.848,000 --> 0:01:26,000
And it was Arthur Ashe.

25
0:01:27.832,000 --> 0:01:29,000
And my dad talked about his character, his discipline,

26
0:01:30.76,000 --> 0:01:32,000
his intelligence, his athleticism.

27
0:01:33.054,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I wanted to be Arthur Ashe,

28
0:01:34.448,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I didn't want to be one of those moon guys.

29
0:01:37.106,000 --> 0:01:41,000
And as I went on through this journey,

30
0:01:41.614,000 --> 0:01:44,000
my dad, who was a school teacher, he played in a band,

31
0:01:45.559,000 --> 0:01:47,000
he did all these things to make money for my sister and I

32
0:01:48.344,000 --> 0:01:49,000
to take piano lessons

33
0:01:49.679,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and do these different things with education.

34
0:01:51.821,000 --> 0:01:56,000
And he one day decides to drive up into the driveway with this bread truck.

35
0:01:58.356,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I'm thinking, "OK, bread truck,

36
0:02:02.157,000 --> 0:02:04,000
me delivering bread while my dad's driving the truck."

37
0:02:05.157,000 --> 0:02:07,000
I'm like, "OK, I'm going to be a bread guy now."

38
0:02:07.792,000 --> 0:02:09,000
But he says, "This is our camper."

39
0:02:11.8,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I'm like, "Dude, come one, I can read: 'Merita Bread and Rolls'

40
0:02:14.816,000 --> 0:02:15,000
on the side of this truck.

41
0:02:16.378,000 --> 0:02:19,000
And he says, "No, we're going to build this into our camper."

42
0:02:21.187,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And over that summer, we rewired the entire electrical system.

43
0:02:25.483,000 --> 0:02:27,000
We plumbed a propane tank to a Coleman stove,

44
0:02:28.157,000 --> 0:02:3,000
we built bunk beds that flip down.

45
0:02:30.625,000 --> 0:02:35,000
We were turning this into our summer vacation launch pad, escape pod,

46
0:02:35.798,000 --> 0:02:37,000
this thing that could take us out of Lynchburg.

47
0:02:39.614,000 --> 0:02:41,000
And before that,

48
0:02:43.376,000 --> 0:02:46,000
I was actually raped at five by some neighbors.

49
0:02:48.574,000 --> 0:02:5,000
And I didn't tell anyone,

50
0:02:51.022,000 --> 0:02:54,000
because I had friends that didn't have fathers.

51
0:02:54.887,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And I knew that my father

52
0:02:56.872,000 --> 0:02:58,000
would have killed the people that did that to his son.

53
0:02:59.864,000 --> 0:03:01,000
And I didn't want my father to be gone.

54
0:03:02.959,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So as we got in this bread truck and escaped from Lynchburg,

55
0:03:07.465,000 --> 0:03:09,000
it was my time with my dad.

56
0:03:09.692,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And we went to the Smoky Mountains

57
0:03:11.95,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and looked at the purple mountains' majesty.

58
0:03:14.021,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And we walked along the beach in Myrtle Beach,

59
0:03:16.587,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and this thing was transformative.

60
0:03:20.298,000 --> 0:03:23,000
It showed me what it meant to be an explorer, at a very early age.

61
0:03:24.433,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And I suppressed all that negativity,

62
0:03:27.839,000 --> 0:03:28,000
all that trauma,

63
0:03:29.029,000 --> 0:03:31,000
because I was learning to be an explorer.

64
0:03:31.91,000 --> 0:03:34,000
And a little bit later, my mother gave me an age-inappropriate,

65
0:03:34.989,000 --> 0:03:35,000
non-OSHA-certified chemistry set,

66
0:03:36.648,000 --> 0:03:37,000
(Laughter)

67
0:03:37.835,000 --> 0:03:4,000
where I created the most incredible explosion in her living room.

68
0:03:41.752,000 --> 0:03:42,000
(Laughter)

69
0:03:43.237,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And so I knew I could be a chemist.

70
0:03:44.999,000 --> 0:03:46,000
So as I went on this journey through a high school,

71
0:03:47.444,000 --> 0:03:48,000
and I went to college,

72
0:03:49.07,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and I got a football scholarship to play football in college.

73
0:03:52.213,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And I knew that I could be a chemist, because I'd already blown stuff up.

74
0:03:55.745,000 --> 0:03:56,000
(Laughter)

75
0:03:57.403,000 --> 0:04:,000
And when I graduated,

76
0:04:00.808,000 --> 0:04:02,000
I got drafted to the Detroit Lions.

77
0:04:03.406,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But I pulled a hamstring in training camp,

78
0:04:05.636,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and so what every former NFL player does, they go work for NASA, right?

79
0:04:09.017,000 --> 0:04:1,000
So I went to work for NASA.

80
0:04:10.335,000 --> 0:04:11,000
(Laughter)

81
0:04:11.36,000 --> 0:04:14,000
And this friend of mine said, "Leland, you'd be great astronaut."

82
0:04:14.477,000 --> 0:04:16,000
I just laughed at him, I was like, "Yeah, me, an astronaut?"

83
0:04:17.385,000 --> 0:04:19,000
You know that Neil and Buzz thing from back in '69?

84
0:04:19.829,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And he handed me an application, and I looked at it,

85
0:04:22.42,000 --> 0:04:23,000
and I didn't fill it out.

86
0:04:23.706,000 --> 0:04:27,000
And that same year, another friend of mine filled out the application

87
0:04:28.689,000 --> 0:04:29,000
and he got in.

88
0:04:30.372,000 --> 0:04:31,000
And I said to myself,

89
0:04:32.79,000 --> 0:04:35,000
"If NASA's letting knuckleheads like that be astronauts,"

90
0:04:35.975,000 --> 0:04:36,000
(Laughter)

91
0:04:37.173,000 --> 0:04:38,000
"maybe I can be one, too."

92
0:04:38.602,000 --> 0:04:41,000
So the next selection, I filled out the application, and I got in.

93
0:04:42.333,000 --> 0:04:45,000
And I didn't know what it meant to be an astronaut:

94
0:04:46.166,000 --> 0:04:48,000
the training, the simulations,

95
0:04:48.769,000 --> 0:04:51,000
all these things to get you ready for this countdown:

96
0:04:51.863,000 --> 0:04:53,000
three, two, one, liftoff.

97
0:04:54.427,000 --> 0:04:59,000
And in 2007, I was in Space Shuttle "Atlantis," careening off the planet,

98
0:04:59.901,000 --> 0:05:02,000
traveling at 17,500 miles per hour.

99
0:05:03.88,000 --> 0:05:04,000
And eight and a half minutes later,

100
0:05:05.824,000 --> 0:05:08,000
the main engines cut off, and we're now floating in space.

101
0:05:09.519,000 --> 0:05:11,000
And I push off and float over to the window,

102
0:05:12.496,000 --> 0:05:14,000
and I can see the Caribbean.

103
0:05:14.575,000 --> 0:05:17,000
And I need new definitions of blue to describe the colors that I see.

104
0:05:18.56,000 --> 0:05:22,000
Azure, indigo, navy blue, medium navy blue, turquoise

105
0:05:22.747,000 --> 0:05:24,000
don't do any justice to what I see with my eyes.

106
0:05:26.151,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And my job on this mission was to install

107
0:05:29.11,000 --> 0:05:32,000
this two-billion dollar Columbus laboratory.

108
0:05:33.117,000 --> 0:05:34,000
It was a research laboratory

109
0:05:34.824,000 --> 0:05:36,000
for materials research, for human research.

110
0:05:37.737,000 --> 0:05:4,000
And I reached into the payload bay of the space shuttle,

111
0:05:41.11,000 --> 0:05:43,000
grabbed out this big module,

112
0:05:43.618,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and I used the robotic arm and I attached it to the space station.

113
0:05:47.962,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And the European team have been waiting 10 years for this thing to get installed,

114
0:05:51.812,000 --> 0:05:55,000
so I'm sure everyone in Europe was like, "Leland! Leland! Leland!"

115
0:05:56.41,000 --> 0:05:57,000
(Laughter)

116
0:05:57.824,000 --> 0:06:,000
And so this moment happened, this was our primary mission objective,

117
0:06:01.426,000 --> 0:06:02,000
it was done.

118
0:06:03.006,000 --> 0:06:05,000
And I had this big sigh of relief.

119
0:06:07.189,000 --> 0:06:1,000
But then, Peggy Whitson, the first female commander,

120
0:06:10.379,000 --> 0:06:12,000
she invited us over to the Russian segment.

121
0:06:12.459,000 --> 0:06:14,000
And the space station's about the size of a football field,

122
0:06:15.332,000 --> 0:06:18,000
with solar panel and trusses and all of these modules.

123
0:06:19.427,000 --> 0:06:22,000
And she says, "Leland, you go get the rehydrated vegetables,

124
0:06:22.515,000 --> 0:06:23,000
we have the meat."

125
0:06:23.753,000 --> 0:06:26,000
So we float over with the bag of vegetables, all rehydrated,

126
0:06:27.546,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and we get there.

127
0:06:29.467,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And there's this moment

128
0:06:30.813,000 --> 0:06:34,000
where I get [transported] back to my mother's kitchen.

129
0:06:35.157,000 --> 0:06:37,000
You can smell the beef and barley heating up,

130
0:06:37.88,000 --> 0:06:4,000
you can smell the food, the colors,

131
0:06:41.657,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and there are people there from all around the world.

132
0:06:44.578,000 --> 0:06:45,000
It's like a Benetton commercial,

133
0:06:46.189,000 --> 0:06:49,000
you know, you have African American, Asian American, French, German, Russian,

134
0:06:50.173,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the first female commander,

135
0:06:51.522,000 --> 0:06:54,000
breaking bread at 17,500 miles per hour,

136
0:06:55.341,000 --> 0:06:57,000
going around the planet every 90 minutes,

137
0:06:57.691,000 --> 0:06:59,000
seeing a sunrise and a sunset every 45.

138
0:07:01.127,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And Peggy would say, "Hey, Leland, try some of this,"

139
0:07:03.778,000 --> 0:07:04,000
and she'd float it over to my mouth,

140
0:07:05.603,000 --> 0:07:07,000
and I'd catch it and we'd go back and forth.

141
0:07:07.856,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And we're doing all of this while listening to Sade's "Smooth Operator."

142
0:07:13.039,000 --> 0:07:14,000
(Laughter)

143
0:07:14.064,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I mean, this is like blowing my mind, you know.

144
0:07:16.483,000 --> 0:07:17,000
(Laughter)

145
0:07:17.602,000 --> 0:07:2,000
And I float over to the window, and I look down at the planet,

146
0:07:21.046,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and I see all of humanity.

147
0:07:24.499,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And my perspective changes at that moment,

148
0:07:27.245,000 --> 0:07:29,000
because, I'm flying over Lynchburg, Virginia, my home town,

149
0:07:30.148,000 --> 0:07:31,000
and my family's probably breaking bread.

150
0:07:32.158,000 --> 0:07:34,000
And five minutes later, we're flying over Paris,

151
0:07:34.745,000 --> 0:07:36,000
where Leo Eyharts is looking down at his parents,

152
0:07:37.372,000 --> 0:07:38,000
probably having some wine and cheese,

153
0:07:39.197,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and Yuri's looking off to Moscow,

154
0:07:41.085,000 --> 0:07:43,000
and they're probably eating borscht or something else.

155
0:07:43.654,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But we're all having this moment where we see our respective families

156
0:07:48.705,000 --> 0:07:52,000
working together as one civilization,

157
0:07:52.896,000 --> 0:07:54,000
at 17,500 miles per hour.

158
0:07:56.245,000 --> 0:07:58,000
My perspective shifted cognitively,

159
0:07:59.102,000 --> 0:08:,000
it changed me.

160
0:08:00.459,000 --> 0:08:02,000
And when I think about being that little skinny boy,

161
0:08:02.943,000 --> 0:08:05,000
from sometimes racist Lynchburg, Virginia,

162
0:08:06.324,000 --> 0:08:1,000
I would never have had that perspective

163
0:08:10.475,000 --> 0:08:12,000
to think about myself of being an astronaut,

164
0:08:13.483,000 --> 0:08:16,000
if my father hadn't taken us on a journey

165
0:08:16.538,000 --> 0:08:19,000
in this radical craft that we built with our own two hands.

166
0:08:22.016,000 --> 0:08:24,000
When I came home,

167
0:08:24.254,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I realized that perspective is something

168
0:08:28.976,000 --> 0:08:3,000
that we all get and we all have.

169
0:08:32.236,000 --> 0:08:34,000
It's just how far do we open up our blinders

170
0:08:34.697,000 --> 0:08:36,000
to see that shift and that change.

171
0:08:37.903,000 --> 0:08:38,000
And going back to the space station,

172
0:08:39.726,000 --> 0:08:43,000
I think of, you know, Germans and Russians fighting Americans.

173
0:08:45.081,000 --> 0:08:47,000
We have these people living and working together.

174
0:08:48.382,000 --> 0:08:52,000
White folks, black folks, Russian folks, French folks, you know.

175
0:08:52.499,000 --> 0:08:57,000
All these different people coexisting in harmony as one race.

176
0:08:58.712,000 --> 0:09:02,000
And I think about the colors that I saw, the design of the modules,

177
0:09:02.983,000 --> 0:09:03,000
the way that things fit together,

178
0:09:04.587,000 --> 0:09:07,000
the way that it made us a community, our home.

179
0:09:09.221,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And so when I look up to space now,

180
0:09:13.733,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and I have this newfound perspective

181
0:09:17.498,000 --> 0:09:2,000
on the space station going overhead and looking there,

182
0:09:20.709,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and then looking back at my community

183
0:09:22.525,000 --> 0:09:25,000
and seeing the people that I'm living and working with,

184
0:09:25.748,000 --> 0:09:27,000
and coexisting with,

185
0:09:27.867,000 --> 0:09:32,000
I think it's something that we all can do now, especially in these times,

186
0:09:33.816,000 --> 0:09:36,000
to make sure that we have the right perspective.

187
0:09:38.466,000 --> 0:09:39,000
Thank you.

188
0:09:39.684,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Applause)

189
0:09:44.338,000 --> 0:09:47,000
Chee Pearlman: If you don't mind, could I just chat with you for a minute,

190
0:09:47.852,000 --> 0:09:49,000
because they're going to set up some things here.

191
0:09:50.248,000 --> 0:09:52,000
And I get to have you all to myself, OK.

192
0:09:52.574,000 --> 0:09:53,000
Leland Melvin: Alright.

193
0:09:54.348,000 --> 0:09:55,000
CP: You guys don't get to hear this.

194
0:09:56.189,000 --> 0:09:58,000
So I have to tell you

195
0:09:58.292,000 --> 0:10:03,000
that in my family, we watch a lot of space movies

196
0:10:03.478,000 --> 0:10:04,000
about astronauts and stuff like that.

197
0:10:05.387,000 --> 0:10:07,000
I can't tell you why, but we do.

198
0:10:07.427,000 --> 0:10:08,000
(Laughter)

199
0:10:09.849,000 --> 0:10:11,000
The thing that I wanted to ask you, though,

200
0:10:11.949,000 --> 0:10:14,000
is that we were seeing this movie the other day,

201
0:10:15.329,000 --> 0:10:18,000
and it was about one of the astronauts, one of your colleagues,

202
0:10:19.245,000 --> 0:10:21,000
and before he went up into space,

203
0:10:22.237,000 --> 0:10:26,000
they actually wrote an obituary, NASA wrote an obituary for him.

204
0:10:26.792,000 --> 0:10:27,000
And I was like, is that normal?

205
0:10:28.666,000 --> 0:10:29,000
And is that part of the job?

206
0:10:30.626,000 --> 0:10:35,000
Do you think about that peril that you're putting yourself in

207
0:10:36.184,000 --> 0:10:37,000
as you go into space?

208
0:10:37.502,000 --> 0:10:38,000
LM: Yeah.

209
0:10:38.824,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So, I don't remember anyone writing my obituary,

210
0:10:41.102,000 --> 0:10:43,000
maybe that was an Apollo-day thing.

211
0:10:43.737,000 --> 0:10:47,000
But I do know that in the 135 shuttle flights that we've had,

212
0:10:48.292,000 --> 0:10:5,000
the shuttle that I flew on,

213
0:10:50.967,000 --> 0:10:53,000
we had two accidents that killed everyone on that mission.

214
0:10:55.292,000 --> 0:10:58,000
And we all know the perils and the risks that go along with this,

215
0:10:58.596,000 --> 0:11:,000
but we're doing something that's much bigger than ourselves,

216
0:11:01.459,000 --> 0:11:02,000
and helping advance civilization,

217
0:11:03.085,000 --> 0:11:06,000
so the risk is worth the reward.

218
0:11:06.515,000 --> 0:11:08,000
And we all feel that way when we get into that vehicle

219
0:11:09.251,000 --> 0:11:13,000
ans strap into those million pounds of rocket fuel and go up to space.

220
0:11:13.991,000 --> 0:11:15,000
CP: Yeah, I've only seen the Hollywood version --

221
0:11:16.356,000 --> 0:11:18,000
it looks pretty terrifying, I have to tell you.

222
0:11:18.739,000 --> 0:11:19,000
LM: You should go.

223
0:11:19.967,000 --> 0:11:2,000
(Laughter)

224
0:11:21.142,000 --> 0:11:23,000
CP: Yeah, my husband's told me that a few times.

225
0:11:23.903,000 --> 0:11:24,000
(Laughter)

226
0:11:25.919,000 --> 0:11:26,000
LM: One-way trip or two-way?

227
0:11:27.903,000 --> 0:11:28,000
(Laughter)

228
0:11:29.078,000 --> 0:11:31,000
CP: That’s a bit of a debate in our house.

229
0:11:31.554,000 --> 0:11:32,000
(Laughter)

230
0:11:33.411,000 --> 0:11:36,000
I wanted to, if I may ...

231
0:11:37.554,000 --> 0:11:42,000
You did touch on something that was very powerful and difficult,

232
0:11:42.811,000 --> 0:11:45,000
which is, you spoke about this incident

233
0:11:46.496,000 --> 0:11:48,000
that had happened to you when you were five years old,

234
0:11:49.044,000 --> 0:11:5,000
and that you were raped.

235
0:11:50.249,000 --> 0:11:53,000
And I just think that for you to be able to say those things,

236
0:11:53.475,000 --> 0:11:55,000
you know, on the TED stage,

237
0:11:55.626,000 --> 0:11:57,000
to be able to talk about that at all,

238
0:11:58.332,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is pretty fearless.

239
0:12:00.292,000 --> 0:12:02,000
And I wanted to get a sense from you,

240
0:12:03.181,000 --> 0:12:07,000
is that something that you think is important for you to share that now,

241
0:12:07.452,000 --> 0:12:08,000
to speak about it?

242
0:12:08.919,000 --> 0:12:12,000
LM: It's so important, especially for men, to talk about things that have happened,

243
0:12:13.071,000 --> 0:12:14,000
because we've been trained

244
0:12:14.574,000 --> 0:12:18,000
and told by our society that we have to be so tough and so hard

245
0:12:18.784,000 --> 0:12:2,000
and we can't tell of things that are happening to us.

246
0:12:21.633,000 --> 0:12:24,000
But I've had so many men contact me and tell me that,

247
0:12:25.211,000 --> 0:12:27,000
"You came through that, you got over that,

248
0:12:27.284,000 --> 0:12:28,000
I'm going to get over my alcoholism,"

249
0:12:29.131,000 --> 0:12:31,000
and these things that are going on in them,

250
0:12:31.173,000 --> 0:12:32,000
because of what happened to them.

251
0:12:32.8,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And so we must share these stories, this is part of storytelling,

252
0:12:36.07,000 --> 0:12:39,000
to heal us and to make us whole as a community.

253
0:12:39.324,000 --> 0:12:4,000
CP: That's wonderful.

254
0:12:41.247,000 --> 0:12:46,000
(Applause)

255
0:12:46.694,000 --> 0:12:5,000
And you know, quite honestly, you spoke about perspective shift,

256
0:12:50.877,000 --> 0:12:54,000
and that is a shift that I think we've been very slow to accept

257
0:12:55.197,000 --> 0:12:58,000
and to be able to speak about that, so we thank you for that.

258
0:12:59.086,000 --> 0:13:02,000
We thank you for being the amazing astronaut that you are,

259
0:13:02.255,000 --> 0:13:04,000
and thank you for coming to the TED stage, Leland.

260
0:13:04.69,000 --> 0:13:05,000
LM: Thank you so much, Chee.

261
0:13:06.089,000 --> 0:13:07,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.58,000 --> 0:00:14,000
This is what my last week looked like.

2
0:00:16.5,000 --> 0:00:17,000
What I did,

3
0:00:18.22,000 --> 0:00:19,000
who I was with,

4
0:00:20.06,000 --> 0:00:23,000
the main sensations I had for every waking hour ...

5
0:00:23.9,000 --> 0:00:25,000
If the feeling came as I thought of my dad

6
0:00:26.42,000 --> 0:00:27,000
who recently passed away,

7
0:00:28.22,000 --> 0:00:32,000
or if I could have just definitely avoided the worries and anxieties.

8
0:00:32.3,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And if you think I'm a little obsessive,

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
you're probably right.

10
0:00:36.14,000 --> 0:00:38,000
But clearly, from this visualization,

11
0:00:38.42,000 --> 0:00:41,000
you can learn much more about me than from this other one,

12
0:00:41.74,000 --> 0:00:43,000
which are images you're probably more familiar with

13
0:00:44.74,000 --> 0:00:46,000
and which you possibly even have on your phone right now.

14
0:00:47.58,000 --> 0:00:49,000
Bar charts for the steps you walked,

15
0:00:49.82,000 --> 0:00:51,000
pie charts for the quality of your sleep --

16
0:00:52.22,000 --> 0:00:53,000
the path of your morning runs.

17
0:00:55.1,000 --> 0:00:57,000
In my day job, I work with data.

18
0:00:57.42,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I run a data visualization design company,

19
0:00:59.94,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and we design and develop ways to make information accessible

20
0:01:03.3,000 --> 0:01:05,000
through visual representations.

21
0:01:05.42,000 --> 0:01:08,000
What my job has taught me over the years

22
0:01:08.46,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is that to really understand data and their true potential,

23
0:01:12.7,000 --> 0:01:15,000
sometimes we actually have to forget about them

24
0:01:15.82,000 --> 0:01:16,000
and see through them instead.

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Because data are always just a tool we use to represent reality.

26
0:01:21.86,000 --> 0:01:23,000
They're always used as a placeholder for something else,

27
0:01:24.74,000 --> 0:01:26,000
but they are never the real thing.

28
0:01:26.94,000 --> 0:01:27,000
But let me step back for a moment

29
0:01:28.9,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to when I first understood this personally.

30
0:01:32.1,000 --> 0:01:35,000
In 1994, I was 13 years old.

31
0:01:35.46,000 --> 0:01:36,000
I was a teenager in Italy.

32
0:01:37.42,000 --> 0:01:39,000
I was too young to be interested in politics,

33
0:01:40.06,000 --> 0:01:42,000
but I knew that a businessman, Silvio Berlusconi,

34
0:01:42.58,000 --> 0:01:44,000
was running for president for the moderate right.

35
0:01:45.94,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We lived in a very liberal town,

36
0:01:47.98,000 --> 0:01:5,000
and my father was a politician for the Democratic Party.

37
0:01:51.3,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And I remember that no one thought that Berlusconi could get elected --

38
0:01:55.66,000 --> 0:01:56,000
that was totally not an option.

39
0:01:58.38,000 --> 0:01:59,000
But it happened.

40
0:01:59.62,000 --> 0:02:01,000
And I remember the feeling very vividly.

41
0:02:02.18,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It was a complete surprise,

42
0:02:04.06,000 --> 0:02:09,000
as my dad promised that in my town he knew nobody who voted for him.

43
0:02:10.54,000 --> 0:02:11,000
This was the first time

44
0:02:12.06,000 --> 0:02:16,000
when the data I had gave me a completely distorted image of reality.

45
0:02:17.1,000 --> 0:02:2,000
My data sample was actually pretty limited and skewed,

46
0:02:20.42,000 --> 0:02:23,000
so probably it was because of that, I thought, I lived in a bubble,

47
0:02:24.18,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and I didn't have enough chances to see outside of it.

48
0:02:27.9,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Now, fast-forward to November 8, 2016

49
0:02:31.7,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in the United States.

50
0:02:33.78,000 --> 0:02:34,000
The internet polls,

51
0:02:35.1,000 --> 0:02:36,000
statistical models,

52
0:02:36.5,000 --> 0:02:4,000
all the pundits agreeing on a possible outcome for the presidential election.

53
0:02:41.34,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It looked like we had enough information this time,

54
0:02:43.98,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and many more chances to see outside the closed circle we lived in --

55
0:02:48.1,000 --> 0:02:49,000
but we clearly didn't.

56
0:02:49.86,000 --> 0:02:51,000
The feeling felt very familiar.

57
0:02:51.98,000 --> 0:02:52,000
I had been there before.

58
0:02:54.18,000 --> 0:02:56,000
I think it's fair to say the data failed us this time --

59
0:02:57.06,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and pretty spectacularly.

60
0:02:58.94,000 --> 0:02:59,000
We believed in data,

61
0:03:00.66,000 --> 0:03:01,000
but what happened,

62
0:03:02.1,000 --> 0:03:04,000
even with the most respected newspaper,

63
0:03:04.82,000 --> 0:03:08,000
is that the obsession to reduce everything to two simple percentage numbers

64
0:03:09.54,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to make a powerful headline

65
0:03:11.54,000 --> 0:03:13,000
made us focus on these two digits

66
0:03:13.62,000 --> 0:03:14,000
and them alone.

67
0:03:15.38,000 --> 0:03:17,000
In an effort to simplify the message

68
0:03:17.46,000 --> 0:03:2,000
and draw a beautiful, inevitable red and blue map,

69
0:03:20.9,000 --> 0:03:21,000
we lost the point completely.

70
0:03:23.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
We somehow forgot that there were stories --

71
0:03:25.42,000 --> 0:03:27,000
stories of human beings behind these numbers.

72
0:03:29.06,000 --> 0:03:3,000
In a different context,

73
0:03:30.66,000 --> 0:03:31,000
but to a very similar point,

74
0:03:32.34,000 --> 0:03:35,000
a peculiar challenge was presented to my team by this woman.

75
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
She came to us with a lot of data,

76
0:03:38.66,000 --> 0:03:42,000
but ultimately she wanted to tell one of the most humane stories possible.

77
0:03:43.1,000 --> 0:03:44,000
She's Samantha Cristoforetti.

78
0:03:44.82,000 --> 0:03:46,000
She has been the first Italian woman astronaut,

79
0:03:47.42,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and she contacted us before being launched

80
0:03:49.94,000 --> 0:03:52,000
on a six-month-long expedition to the International Space Station.

81
0:03:53.86,000 --> 0:03:55,000
She told us, "I'm going to space,

82
0:03:56.1,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and I want to do something meaningful with the data of my mission

83
0:03:59.22,000 --> 0:04:,000
to reach out to people."

84
0:04:01.42,000 --> 0:04:03,000
A mission to the International Space Station

85
0:04:03.98,000 --> 0:04:05,000
comes with terabytes of data

86
0:04:06.1,000 --> 0:04:08,000
about anything you can possibly imagine --

87
0:04:08.5,000 --> 0:04:09,000
the orbits around Earth,

88
0:04:10.02,000 --> 0:04:12,000
the speed and position of the ISS

89
0:04:12.14,000 --> 0:04:15,000
and all of the other thousands of live streams from its sensors.

90
0:04:16.66,000 --> 0:04:18,000
We had all of the hard data we could think of --

91
0:04:19.58,000 --> 0:04:21,000
just like the pundits before the election --

92
0:04:22.02,000 --> 0:04:24,000
but what is the point of all these numbers?

93
0:04:25.02,000 --> 0:04:27,000
People are not interested in data for the sake of it,

94
0:04:27.78,000 --> 0:04:28,000
because numbers are never the point.

95
0:04:29.659,000 --> 0:04:3,000
They're always the means to an end.

96
0:04:32.659,000 --> 0:04:33,000
The story we needed to tell

97
0:04:34.46,000 --> 0:04:36,000
is that there is a human being in a teeny box

98
0:04:36.98,000 --> 0:04:38,000
flying in space above your head,

99
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
and that you can actually see her with your naked eye on a clear night.

100
0:04:43.38,000 --> 0:04:46,000
So we decided to use data to create a connection

101
0:04:46.5,000 --> 0:04:5,000
between Samantha and all of the people looking at her from below.

102
0:04:50.58,000 --> 0:04:53,000
We designed and developed what we called "Friends in Space,"

103
0:04:53.78,000 --> 0:04:57,000
a web application that simply lets you say "hello" to Samantha

104
0:04:58.46,000 --> 0:04:59,000
from where you are,

105
0:04:59.74,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and "hello" to all the people who are online at the same time

106
0:05:03.3,000 --> 0:05:04,000
from all over the world.

107
0:05:05.46,000 --> 0:05:08,000
And all of these "hellos" left visible marks on the map

108
0:05:08.94,000 --> 0:05:1,000
as Samantha was flying by

109
0:05:10.98,000 --> 0:05:13,000
and as she was actually waving back every day at us

110
0:05:14.38,000 --> 0:05:15,000
using Twitter from the ISS.

111
0:05:16.7,000 --> 0:05:2,000
This made people see the mission's data from a very different perspective.

112
0:05:21.7,000 --> 0:05:25,000
It all suddenly became much more about our human nature and our curiosity,

113
0:05:26.42,000 --> 0:05:27,000
rather than technology.

114
0:05:28.1,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So data powered the experience,

115
0:05:30.46,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but stories of human beings were the drive.

116
0:05:34.66,000 --> 0:05:37,000
The very positive response of its thousands of users

117
0:05:38.02,000 --> 0:05:39,000
taught me a very important lesson --

118
0:05:39.98,000 --> 0:05:41,000
that working with data means designing ways

119
0:05:42.86,000 --> 0:05:44,000
to transform the abstract and the uncountable

120
0:05:45.62,000 --> 0:05:49,000
into something that can be seen, felt and directly reconnected

121
0:05:49.66,000 --> 0:05:51,000
to our lives and to our behaviors,

122
0:05:51.98,000 --> 0:05:52,000
something that is hard to achieve

123
0:05:53.86,000 --> 0:05:56,000
if we let the obsession for the numbers and the technology around them

124
0:05:57.78,000 --> 0:05:58,000
lead us in the process.

125
0:06:00.42,000 --> 0:06:04,000
But we can do even more to connect data to the stories they represent.

126
0:06:05.34,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We can remove technology completely.

127
0:06:08.02,000 --> 0:06:1,000
A few years ago, I met this other woman,

128
0:06:10.3,000 --> 0:06:11,000
Stefanie Posavec --

129
0:06:11.7,000 --> 0:06:16,000
a London-based designer who shares with me the passion and obsession about data.

130
0:06:17.54,000 --> 0:06:18,000
We didn't know each other,

131
0:06:18.9,000 --> 0:06:21,000
but we decided to run a very radical experiment,

132
0:06:22.18,000 --> 0:06:24,000
starting a communication using only data,

133
0:06:24.74,000 --> 0:06:25,000
no other language,

134
0:06:26.1,000 --> 0:06:3,000
and we opted for using no technology whatsoever to share our data.

135
0:06:30.74,000 --> 0:06:32,000
In fact, our only means of communication

136
0:06:33.66,000 --> 0:06:35,000
would be through the old-fashioned post office.

137
0:06:36.54,000 --> 0:06:38,000
For "Dear Data," every week for one year,

138
0:06:39.02,000 --> 0:06:42,000
we used our personal data to get to know each other --

139
0:06:42.5,000 --> 0:06:45,000
personal data around weekly shared mundane topics,

140
0:06:46.18,000 --> 0:06:47,000
from our feelings

141
0:06:47.42,000 --> 0:06:48,000
to the interactions with our partners,

142
0:06:49.3,000 --> 0:06:52,000
from the compliments we received to the sounds of our surroundings.

143
0:06:53.3,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Personal information that we would then manually hand draw

144
0:06:56.86,000 --> 0:06:58,000
on a postcard-size sheet of paper

145
0:06:59.38,000 --> 0:07:01,000
that we would every week send from London to New York,

146
0:07:02.34,000 --> 0:07:03,000
where I live,

147
0:07:03.62,000 --> 0:07:05,000
and from New York to London, where she lives.

148
0:07:06.3,000 --> 0:07:09,000
The front of the postcard is the data drawing,

149
0:07:10.02,000 --> 0:07:11,000
and the back of the card

150
0:07:11.34,000 --> 0:07:13,000
contains the address of the other person, of course,

151
0:07:13.793,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and the legend for how to interpret our drawing.

152
0:07:17.46,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The very first week into the project,

153
0:07:19.5,000 --> 0:07:22,000
we actually chose a pretty cold and impersonal topic.

154
0:07:22.58,000 --> 0:07:25,000
How many times do we check the time in a week?

155
0:07:26.54,000 --> 0:07:27,000
So here is the front of my card,

156
0:07:28.5,000 --> 0:07:29,000
and you can see that every little symbol

157
0:07:30.5,000 --> 0:07:33,000
represents all of the times that I checked the time,

158
0:07:33.94,000 --> 0:07:36,000
positioned for days and different hours chronologically --

159
0:07:37.34,000 --> 0:07:39,000
nothing really complicated here.

160
0:07:40.02,000 --> 0:07:41,000
But then you see in the legend

161
0:07:41.62,000 --> 0:07:44,000
how I added anecdotal details about these moments.

162
0:07:45.1,000 --> 0:07:49,000
In fact, the different types of symbols indicate why I was checking the time --

163
0:07:49.7,000 --> 0:07:5,000
what was I doing?

164
0:07:50.94,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Was I bored? Was I hungry?

165
0:07:52.66,000 --> 0:07:53,000
Was I late?

166
0:07:53.9,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Did I check it on purpose or just casually glance at the clock?

167
0:07:57.14,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And this is the key part --

168
0:07:59.42,000 --> 0:08:02,000
representing the details of my days and my personality

169
0:08:03.14,000 --> 0:08:04,000
through my data collection.

170
0:08:05.1,000 --> 0:08:09,000
Using data as a lens or a filter to discover and reveal, for example,

171
0:08:09.82,000 --> 0:08:11,000
my never-ending anxiety for being late,

172
0:08:12.02,000 --> 0:08:14,000
even though I'm absolutely always on time.

173
0:08:16.02,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Stefanie and I spent one year collecting our data manually

174
0:08:20.14,000 --> 0:08:24,000
to force us to focus on the nuances that computers cannot gather --

175
0:08:24.66,000 --> 0:08:25,000
or at least not yet --

176
0:08:26.22,000 --> 0:08:29,000
using data also to explore our minds and the words we use,

177
0:08:29.74,000 --> 0:08:3,000
and not only our activities.

178
0:08:31.7,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Like at week number three,

179
0:08:33.14,000 --> 0:08:36,000
where we tracked the "thank yous" we said and were received,

180
0:08:36.98,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and when I realized that I thank mostly people that I don't know.

181
0:08:41.66,000 --> 0:08:45,000
Apparently I'm a compulsive thanker to waitresses and waiters,

182
0:08:46.02,000 --> 0:08:49,000
but I definitely don't thank enough the people who are close to me.

183
0:08:50.82,000 --> 0:08:51,000
Over one year,

184
0:08:52.1,000 --> 0:08:56,000
the process of actively noticing and counting these types of actions

185
0:08:56.62,000 --> 0:08:57,000
became a ritual.

186
0:08:57.94,000 --> 0:08:59,000
It actually changed ourselves.

187
0:09:00.02,000 --> 0:09:02,000
We became much more in tune with ourselves,

188
0:09:02.74,000 --> 0:09:05,000
much more aware of our behaviors and our surroundings.

189
0:09:06.5,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Over one year, Stefanie and I connected at a very deep level

190
0:09:09.5,000 --> 0:09:11,000
through our shared data diary,

191
0:09:11.54,000 --> 0:09:15,000
but we could do this only because we put ourselves in these numbers,

192
0:09:15.86,000 --> 0:09:18,000
adding the contexts of our very personal stories to them.

193
0:09:19.86,000 --> 0:09:21,000
It was the only way to make them truly meaningful

194
0:09:22.34,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and representative of ourselves.

195
0:09:26.3,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I am not asking you to start drawing your personal data,

196
0:09:29.42,000 --> 0:09:31,000
or to find a pen pal across the ocean.

197
0:09:32.3,000 --> 0:09:34,000
But I'm asking you to consider data --

198
0:09:34.9,000 --> 0:09:35,000
all kind of data --

199
0:09:36.38,000 --> 0:09:37,000
as the beginning of the conversation

200
0:09:38.18,000 --> 0:09:39,000
and not the end.

201
0:09:39.9,000 --> 0:09:42,000
Because data alone will never give us a solution.

202
0:09:43.1,000 --> 0:09:45,000
And this is why data failed us so badly --

203
0:09:45.82,000 --> 0:09:48,000
because we failed to include the right amount of context

204
0:09:49.22,000 --> 0:09:5,000
to represent reality --

205
0:09:50.7,000 --> 0:09:53,000
a nuanced, complicated and intricate reality.

206
0:09:54.78,000 --> 0:09:56,000
We kept looking at these two numbers,

207
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
obsessing with them

208
0:09:58.78,000 --> 0:10:,000
and pretending that our world could be reduced

209
0:10:01.3,000 --> 0:10:03,000
to a couple digits and a horse race,

210
0:10:03.66,000 --> 0:10:04,000
while the real stories,

211
0:10:04.94,000 --> 0:10:05,000
the ones that really mattered,

212
0:10:06.42,000 --> 0:10:07,000
were somewhere else.

213
0:10:07.86,000 --> 0:10:11,000
What we missed looking at these stories only through models and algorithms

214
0:10:12.3,000 --> 0:10:14,000
is what I call "data humanism."

215
0:10:15.38,000 --> 0:10:17,000
In the Renaissance humanism,

216
0:10:17.42,000 --> 0:10:18,000
European intellectuals

217
0:10:19.06,000 --> 0:10:23,000
placed the human nature instead of God at the center of their view of the world.

218
0:10:24.62,000 --> 0:10:26,000
I believe something similar needs to happen

219
0:10:26.86,000 --> 0:10:27,000
with the universe of data.

220
0:10:28.66,000 --> 0:10:3,000
Now data are apparently treated like a God --

221
0:10:31.66,000 --> 0:10:34,000
keeper of infallible truth for our present and our future.

222
0:10:35.66,000 --> 0:10:37,000
The experiences that I shared with you today

223
0:10:38.58,000 --> 0:10:43,000
taught me that to make data faithfully representative of our human nature

224
0:10:43.62,000 --> 0:10:46,000
and to make sure they will not mislead us anymore,

225
0:10:47.06,000 --> 0:10:5,000
we need to start designing ways to include empathy, imperfection

226
0:10:50.78,000 --> 0:10:51,000
and human qualities

227
0:10:52.38,000 --> 0:10:55,000
in how we collect, process, analyze and display them.

228
0:10:57.1,000 --> 0:10:59,000
I do see a place where, ultimately,

229
0:11:00.1,000 --> 0:11:03,000
instead of using data only to become more efficient,

230
0:11:03.46,000 --> 0:11:05,000
we will all use data to become more humane.

231
0:11:06.7,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Thank you.

232
0:11:07.94,000 --> 0:11:11,000
(Applause)

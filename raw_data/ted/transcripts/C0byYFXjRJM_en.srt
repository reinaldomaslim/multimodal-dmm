1
0:00:13.14,000 --> 0:00:15,000
The most romantic thing to ever happen to me online

2
0:00:16.015,000 --> 0:00:18,000
started out the way most things do:

3
0:00:18.388,000 --> 0:00:21,000
without me, and not online.

4
0:00:21.911,000 --> 0:00:23,000
On December 10, 1896, the man on the medal,

5
0:00:24.819,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Alfred Nobel, died.

6
0:00:26.654,000 --> 0:00:28,000
One hundred years later, exactly, actually,

7
0:00:28.91,000 --> 0:00:29,000
December 10, 1996,

8
0:00:30.476,000 --> 0:00:31,000
this charming lady, Wislawa Szymborska,

9
0:00:32.475,000 --> 0:00:34,000
won the Nobel Prize for literature.

10
0:00:34.636,000 --> 0:00:35,000
She's a Polish poet.

11
0:00:36.277,000 --> 0:00:37,000
She's a big deal, obviously,

12
0:00:37.525,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but back in '96, I thought I had never heard of her,

13
0:00:40.164,000 --> 0:00:41,000
and when I checked out her work,

14
0:00:41.683,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I found this sweet little poem,

15
0:00:43.179,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"Four in the Morning."

16
0:00:44.78,000 --> 0:00:45,000
"The hour from night to day.

17
0:00:46.045,000 --> 0:00:47,000
The hour from side to side.

18
0:00:47.431,000 --> 0:00:48,000
The hour for those past thirty..."

19
0:00:49.229,000 --> 0:00:51,000
And it goes on, but as soon as I read this poem,

20
0:00:51.316,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I fell for it hard,

21
0:00:53.239,000 --> 0:00:55,000
so hard, I suspected we must have met

22
0:00:56.18,000 --> 0:00:57,000
somewhere before.

23
0:00:57.593,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Had I shared an elevator ride with this poem?

24
0:00:59.892,000 --> 0:01:,000
Did I flirt with this poem

25
0:01:01.412,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in a coffee shop somewhere?

26
0:01:02.557,000 --> 0:01:03,000
I could not place it, and it bugged me,

27
0:01:04.069,000 --> 0:01:05,000
and then in the coming week or two,

28
0:01:05.971,000 --> 0:01:06,000
I would just be watching an old movie,

29
0:01:07.42,000 --> 0:01:08,000
and this would happen.

30
0:01:08.702,000 --> 0:01:09,000
(Video) Groucho Marx: Charlie, you should have come to the first party.

31
0:01:09.965,000 --> 0:01:11,000
We didn't get home till around four in the morning.

32
0:01:12.317,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Rives: My roommates would have the TV on,

33
0:01:14.589,000 --> 0:01:15,000
and this would happen.

34
0:01:16.271,000 --> 0:01:17,000
(Music: Seinfeld theme)

35
0:01:17.89,000 --> 0:01:18,000
(Video) George Costanza: Oh boy, I was up til four in the morning

36
0:01:19.671,000 --> 0:01:21,000
watching that Omen trilogy.

37
0:01:22.36,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Rives: I would be listening to music,

38
0:01:23.597,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and this would happen.

39
0:01:25.124,000 --> 0:01:27,000

1
0:00:16.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
In 1994, I walked into a prison in Cambodia,

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
and I met a 12-year-old boy

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
who had been tortured

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and was denied access to counsel.

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:29,000
And as I looked into his eyes, I realized

6
0:00:29.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
that for the hundreds of letters I had written

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
for political prisoners, that I would never have

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
written a letter for him,

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
because he was not a 12-year-old boy who

10
0:00:38.26,000 --> 0:00:4,000
had done something important for anybody.

11
0:00:40.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
He was not a political prisoner.

12
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
He was a 12-year-old boy who had

13
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
stolen a bicycle.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
What I also realized at that point was that

15
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
it was not only Cambodia, but

16
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
of the 113

17
0:00:52.26,000 --> 0:00:54,000
developing countries that torture,

18
0:00:54.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
93 of these countries have all passed laws

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
that say you have a right to a lawyer

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and you have a right not to be tortured.

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And what I recognized was that there was an

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
incredible window of opportunity for us

23
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
as a world community to come together

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and end torture as an investigative tool.

25
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
We often think of torture as being

26
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
political torture or reserved for

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
just the worst, but, in fact,

28
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
95 percent of torture today

29
0:01:21.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
is not for political prisoners.

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It is for people who are

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
in broken-down legal systems,

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and unfortunately because torture is

33
0:01:29.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
the cheapest form of investigation --

34
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
it's cheaper than having a legal system,

35
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
cheaper than having a lawyer

36
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
and early access to counsel --

37
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
it is what happens most of the time.

38
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I believe today that it is possible for us

39
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
as a world community, if we make a decision,

40
0:01:44.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
to come together and end torture

41
0:01:46.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
as an investigative tool in our lifetime,

42
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but it will require three things.

43
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
First is the training, empowerment,

44
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
and connection of defenders worldwide.

45
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:02:,000
The second is insuring that there is

46
0:02:00.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
systematic early access to counsel.

47
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
And the third is commitment.

48
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
So in the year 2000,

49
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I began to wonder,

50
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
what if we came together?

51
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Could we do something

52
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
for these 93 countries?

53
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And I founded International Bridges to Justice

54
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
which has a specific mission of

55
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
ending torture as an investigative tool

56
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and implementing due process rights

57
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers

58
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:32,000
at an early stage in police stations

59
0:02:32.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and in courtrooms.

60
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
My first experiences, though, did come

61
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
from Cambodia, and at the time I remember

62
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
first coming to Cambodia and there were,

63
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
in 1994, still less than

64
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
10 attorneys in the country because

65
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the Khmer Rouge had killed them all.

66
0:02:47.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
And even 20 years later, there was only

67
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
10 lawyers in the country, so consequently

68
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
you'd walk into a prison and

69
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
not only would you meet 12-year-old boys,

70
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
you'd meet women and you'd say,

71
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
"Why are you here?" Women would say,

72
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
"Well I've been here for 10 years because

73
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
my husband committed a crime, but they can't find him."

74
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
So it's just a place where there was no rule of law.

75
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
The first group of defenders came together

76
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
and I still remember, as I was training, I said,

77
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
"Okay, what do you do for an investigation?"

78
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
And there was silence in the class, and finally

79
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
one woman stood up, [inaudible name],

80
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and she said "Khrew," which means "teacher."

81
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
She said, "I have defended more than

82
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
a hundred people, and I've never had to do

83
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
any investigation,

84
0:03:27.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
because they all come with confessions."

85
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And we talked about, as a class, the fact that

86
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
number one, the confessions

87
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
might not be reliable, but number two,

88
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
we did not want to encourage the police

89
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
to keep doing this, especially

90
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
as it was now against the law.

91
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And it took a lot of courage for these

92
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
defenders to decide that they would

93
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
begin to stand up and support each other

94
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
in implementing these laws.

95
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And I still remember the first cases where

96
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
they came, all 25 together, she would

97
0:03:55.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
stand up, and they were in the back, and

98
0:03:57.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
they would support her, and the judges kept

99
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
saying, "No, no, no, no, we're going to do things

100
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
the exact same way we've been doing them."

101
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But one day the perfect case came, and it

102
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
was a woman who was a vegetable seller,

103
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
she was sitting outside of a house.

104
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
She said she actually saw the person

105
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
run out who she thinks stole

106
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
whatever the jewelry was, but the police

107
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
came, they got her, there was nothing on her.

108
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
She was pregnant at the time. She had

109
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
cigarette burns on her. She'd miscarried.

110
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And when they brought her case

111
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
to the judge, for the first time he stood up

112
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and he said, "Yes, there's no evidence

113
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
except for your torture confession

114
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
and you will be released."

115
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And the defenders began to take cases

116
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
over and over again and

117
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
you will see, they have step by step began

118
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
to change the course of history in Cambodia.

119
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
But Cambodia is not alone.

120
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I used to think, well is it Cambodia?

121
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Or is it other countries?

122
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
But it is in so many countries.

123
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn't

124
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
a 12-year-old boy, it was an 8-year-old boy

125
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
for stealing a mobile phone.

126
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
Or a woman, I picked up her baby,

127
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
really cute baby, I said "Your baby is so cute."

128
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:05,000
It wasn't a baby, she was three.

129
0:05:05.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
And she said "Yeah, but she's why I'm here,"

130
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
because she was accused of stealing

131
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
two diapers and an iron for her baby and

132
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
still had been in prison.

133
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And when I walked up to the prison director,

134
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
I said, "You've got to let her out.

135
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
A judge would let her out."

136
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And he said, "Okay, we can talk about it,

137
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but look at my prison. Eighty percent

138
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
of the two thousand people here

139
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
are without a lawyer. What can we do?"

140
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:29,000
So lawyers began to courageously

141
0:05:29.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
stand up together to organize a system

142
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
where they can take cases.

143
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
But we realized that it's not only the training

144
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
of the lawyers, but the connection

145
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
of the lawyers that makes a difference.

146
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
For example, in Cambodia, it was that

147
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
[inaudible name] did not go alone

148
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
but she had 24 lawyers with her

149
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:48,000
who stood up together. And in the same way,

150
0:05:48.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
in China, they always tell me,

151
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
"It's like a fresh wind in the desert

152
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
when we can come together."

153
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Or in Zimbabwe, where I remember Innocent,

154
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:58,000
after coming out of a prison where everybody

155
0:05:58.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
stood up and said, "I've been here

156
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
for one year, eight years, 12 years

157
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
without a lawyer,"

158
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:06,000
he came and we had a training together

159
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
and he said, "I have heard it said" --

160
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
because he had heard people mumbling

161
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
and grumbling -- "I have heard it said that

162
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
we cannot help to create justice

163
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
because we do not have the resources."

164
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
And then he said, "But I want you to know

165
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
that the lack of resources

166
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
is never an excuse for injustice."

167
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And with that, he successfully

168
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
organized 68 lawyers who have been

169
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
systematically taking the cases.

170
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
The key that we see, though, is training

171
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
and then early access.

172
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
I was recently in Egypt, and was inspired

173
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:41,000
to meet with another group of lawyers,

174
0:06:41.26,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and what they told me is that they said,

175
0:06:43.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
"Hey, look, we don't have police

176
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
on the streets now. The police are

177
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
one of the main reasons why we had

178
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:51,000
the revolution. They were torturing everybody

179
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
all the time."

180
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And I said, "But there's been tens of millions

181
0:06:55.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
of dollars that have recently gone in

182
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
to the development of the legal system here.

183
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:01,000
What's going on?"

184
0:07:01.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
I met with one of the development agencies,

185
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
and they were training prosecutors

186
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
and judges, which is the normal bias,

187
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
as opposed to defenders.

188
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
And they showed me a manual which

189
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:14,000
actually was an excellent manual.

190
0:07:14.26,000 --> 0:07:16,000
I said, "I'm gonna copy this."

191
0:07:16.26,000 --> 0:07:18,000
It had everything in it. Lawyers can come

192
0:07:18.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
at the police station. It was perfect.

193
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Prosecutors were perfectly trained.

194
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But I said to them, "I just have one question,

195
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
which is, by the time that everybody got to

196
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
the prosecutor's office, what had happened to them?"

197
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
And after a pause, they said,

198
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
"They had been tortured."

199
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
So the pieces are,

200
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
not only the training of the lawyers, but

201
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
us finding a way to systematically implement

202
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
early access to counsel, because they are

203
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
the safeguard in the system

204
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
for people who are being tortured.

205
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And as I tell you this, I'm also aware of the

206
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
fact that it sounds like, "Oh, okay, it sounds

207
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
like we could do it, but can we really do it?"

208
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
Because it sounds big.

209
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And there are many reasons why I believe it's possible.

210
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The first reason is the people on the ground

211
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
who find ways of creating miracles

212
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
because of their commitment.

213
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It's not only Innocent, who I told you about

214
0:08:10.26,000 --> 0:08:13,000
in Zimbabwe, but defenders all over the world

215
0:08:13.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
who are looking for these pieces.

216
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:19,000
We have a program called JusticeMakers,

217
0:08:19.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
and we realized there are people that are

218
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:23,000
courageous and want to do things, but

219
0:08:23.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
how can we support them?

220
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
So it's an online contest where it's only

221
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
five thousand dollars if you come up with

222
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:31,000
and innovative way of implementing justice.

223
0:08:31.26,000 --> 0:08:33,000
And there are 30 JusticeMakers

224
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
throughout the world, from Sri Lanka

225
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
to Swaziland to the DRC, who with

226
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
five thousand dollars do amazing things,

227
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
through SMS programs,

228
0:08:43.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
through paralegal programs,

229
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
through whatever they can do.

230
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
And it's not only these JusticeMakers,

231
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
but people we courageously see

232
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:56,000
figure out who their networks are

233
0:08:56.26,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and how they can move it forward.

234
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
So in China, for instance, great laws

235
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
came out where it says police cannot

236
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
torture people or they will be punished.

237
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
And I was sitting side by side with one of our

238
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
very courageous lawyers, and said,

239
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
"How can we get this out? How can we

240
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
make sure that this is implemented?

241
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
This is fantastic." And he said to me,

242
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:2,000
"Well, do you have money?" And I said,

243
0:09:20.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
"No." And he said, "That's okay,

244
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:24,000
we can still figure it out."

245
0:09:24.26,000 --> 0:09:26,000
And on December 4, he organized

246
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
three thousand members

247
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
of the Youth Communist League,

248
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
from 14 of the top law schools,

249
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
who organized themselves, developed

250
0:09:34.26,000 --> 0:09:36,000
posters with the new laws, and went

251
0:09:36.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
to the police stations and began what he says

252
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
is a non-violent legal revolution

253
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
to protect citizen rights.

254
0:09:44.26,000 --> 0:09:46,000
So I talked about the fact that we need

255
0:09:46.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
to train and support defenders.

256
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We need to systematically implement

257
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
early access to counsel.

258
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
But the third and most important thing is that

259
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
we make a commitment to this.

260
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
And people often say to me, "You know,

261
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
this is great, but it's wildly idealistic.

262
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Never going to happen."

263
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And the reason that I think that

264
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
those words are interesting is because

265
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:08,000
those were the same kinds of words

266
0:10:08.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
that were used for people who decided

267
0:10:10.26,000 --> 0:10:12,000
they would end slavery, or end apartheid.

268
0:10:12.26,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It began with a small group of people

269
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
who decided they would commit.

270
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
Now, there's one of our favorite poems

271
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:2,000
from the defenders, which they share

272
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
from each other, is:

273
0:10:22.26,000 --> 0:10:24,000
"Take courage friends, the road is often long,

274
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
the path is never clear,

275
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and the stakes are very high,

276
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
but deep down, you are not alone."

277
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
And I believe that if we can come together

278
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
as a world community to support not only

279
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
defenders, but also everyone in the system

280
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
who is looking towards it,

281
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
we can end torture as an investigative tool.

282
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
I end always, because I'm sure the questions are --

283
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
and I'd be happy to talk to you

284
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
at any point -- "But what can I really do?"

285
0:10:49.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
Well, I would say this. First of all,

286
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
you know what you can do. But second of all,

287
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
I would leave you with the story of Vishna,

288
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
who actually was my inspiration

289
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
for starting International Bridges to Justice.

290
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him

291
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
who was born in a Cambodian prison

292
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
in Kandal Province. But because he was

293
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
born in the prison, everybody loved him,

294
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
including the guards, so he was the only one

295
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:14,000
who was allowed to come

296
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
in and out of the bars.

297
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
So, you know, there's bars. And by the time

298
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
that Vishna was getting bigger,

299
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
which means what gets bigger? Your head gets bigger.

300
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
So he would come to the first bar,

301
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:26,000
the second bar and then the third bar,

302
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:28,000
and then really slowly move his head

303
0:11:28.26,000 --> 0:11:3,000
so he could fit through, and come back,

304
0:11:30.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
third, second, first. And he would

305
0:11:32.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
grab my pinkie, because what he wanted

306
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
to do every day is he wanted to go visit.

307
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
You know, he never quite made it to

308
0:11:38.26,000 --> 0:11:4,000
all of them every day, but he wanted to visit

309
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
all 156 prisoners. And I would lift him,

310
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
and he would put his fingers through.

311
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:46,000
Or if they were dark cells, it was like iron

312
0:11:46.26,000 --> 0:11:48,000
corrugated, and he would put his fingers through.

313
0:11:48.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
And most of the prisoners said that he was

314
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:52,000
their greatest joy and their sunshine, and they

315
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
looked forward to him. And I was like,

316
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:56,000
here's Vishna. He's a 4-year-old boy.

317
0:11:56.26,000 --> 0:11:58,000
He was born in a prison with almost nothing,

318
0:11:58.26,000 --> 0:12:,000
no material goods, but he had a sense of

319
0:12:00.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
his own heroic journey, which I believe

320
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
we are all born into. He said,

321
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
"Probably I can't do everything.

322
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
But I'm one. I can do something.

323
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:1,000

1
0:00:12.71,000 --> 0:00:13,000
Take a look at this drawing.

2
0:00:14.579,000 --> 0:00:15,000
Can you tell what it is?

3
0:00:16.183,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm a molecular biologist by training,

4
0:00:18.93,000 --> 0:00:2,000
and I've seen a lot of these kinds of drawings.

5
0:00:21.533,000 --> 0:00:24,000
They're usually referred to as a model figure,

6
0:00:24.625,000 --> 0:00:25,000
a drawing that shows how we think

7
0:00:26.359,000 --> 0:00:28,000
a cellular or molecular process occurs.

8
0:00:29.023,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This particular drawing is of a process

9
0:00:31.522,000 --> 0:00:35,000
called clathrin-mediated endocytosis.

10
0:00:35.845,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's a process by which a molecule can get

11
0:00:38.455,000 --> 0:00:4,000
from the outside of the cell to the inside

12
0:00:40.693,000 --> 0:00:42,000
by getting captured in a bubble or a vesicle

13
0:00:43.23,000 --> 0:00:45,000
that then gets internalized by the cell.

14
0:00:46.05,000 --> 0:00:47,000
There's a problem with this drawing, though,

15
0:00:47.885,000 --> 0:00:49,000
and it's mainly in what it doesn't show.

16
0:00:50.517,000 --> 0:00:51,000
From lots of experiments,

17
0:00:51.982,000 --> 0:00:52,000
from lots of different scientists,

18
0:00:53.817,000 --> 0:00:55,000
we know a lot about what these molecules look like,

19
0:00:56.813,000 --> 0:00:57,000
how they move around in the cell,

20
0:00:58.495,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and that this is all taking place

21
0:01:00.32,000 --> 0:01:02,000
in an incredibly dynamic environment.

22
0:01:03.31,000 --> 0:01:06,000
So in collaboration with a clathrin expert Tomas Kirchhausen,

23
0:01:06.783,000 --> 0:01:08,000
we decided to create a new kind of model figure

24
0:01:09.102,000 --> 0:01:11,000
that showed all of that.

25
0:01:11.126,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So we start outside of the cell.

26
0:01:12.862,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Now we're looking inside.

27
0:01:14.51,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Clathrin are these three-legged molecules

28
0:01:16.59,000 --> 0:01:19,000
that can self-assemble into soccer-ball-like shapes.

29
0:01:19.878,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Through connections with a membrane,

30
0:01:21.575,000 --> 0:01:23,000
clathrin is able to deform the membrane

31
0:01:23.742,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and form this sort of a cup

32
0:01:25.155,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that forms this sort of a bubble, or a vesicle,

33
0:01:27.462,000 --> 0:01:28,000
that's now capturing some of the proteins

34
0:01:29.246,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that were outside of the cell.

35
0:01:30.9,000 --> 0:01:33,000
Proteins are coming in now that basically pinch off this vesicle,

36
0:01:34.398,000 --> 0:01:36,000
making it separate from the rest of the membrane,

37
0:01:36.982,000 --> 0:01:38,000
and now clathrin is basically done with its job,

38
0:01:39.374,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and so proteins are coming in now —

39
0:01:40.612,000 --> 0:01:41,000
we've covered them yellow and orange —

40
0:01:42.558,000 --> 0:01:44,000
that are responsible for taking apart this clathrin cage.

41
0:01:45.1,000 --> 0:01:48,000
And so all of these proteins can get basically recycled

42
0:01:48.382,000 --> 0:01:49,000
and used all over again.

43
0:01:49.918,000 --> 0:01:52,000
These processes are too small to be seen directly,

44
0:01:53.327,000 --> 0:01:54,000
even with the best microscopes,

45
0:01:55.159,000 --> 0:01:57,000
so animations like this provide a really powerful way

46
0:01:57.79,000 --> 0:02:,000
of visualizing a hypothesis.

47
0:02:00.808,000 --> 0:02:01,000
Here's another illustration,

48
0:02:02.654,000 --> 0:02:04,000
and this is a drawing of how a researcher might think

49
0:02:05.39,000 --> 0:02:08,000
that the HIV virus gets into and out of cells.

50
0:02:08.895,000 --> 0:02:1,000
And again, this is a vast oversimplification

51
0:02:11.414,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and doesn't begin to show

52
0:02:13.158,000 --> 0:02:15,000
what we actually know about these processes.

53
0:02:15.64,000 --> 0:02:17,000
You might be surprised to know

54
0:02:17.855,000 --> 0:02:19,000
that these simple drawings are the only way

55
0:02:20.622,000 --> 0:02:23,000
that most biologists visualize their molecular hypotheses.

56
0:02:24.454,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Why?

57
0:02:25.482,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Because creating movies of processes

58
0:02:27.472,000 --> 0:02:3,000
as we think they actually occur is really hard.

59
0:02:30.486,000 --> 0:02:33,000
I spent months in Hollywood learning 3D animation software,

60
0:02:34.119,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and I spend months on each animation,

61
0:02:36.4,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and that's just time that most researchers can't afford.

62
0:02:39.75,000 --> 0:02:41,000
The payoffs can be huge, though.

63
0:02:41.95,000 --> 0:02:43,000
Molecular animations are unparalleled

64
0:02:44.334,000 --> 0:02:47,000
in their ability to convey a great deal of information

65
0:02:47.775,000 --> 0:02:5,000
to broad audiences with extreme accuracy.

66
0:02:51.367,000 --> 0:02:52,000
And I'm working on a new project now

67
0:02:52.87,000 --> 0:02:53,000
called "The Science of HIV"

68
0:02:54.308,000 --> 0:02:56,000
where I'll be animating the entire life cycle

69
0:02:56.67,000 --> 0:02:59,000
of the HIV virus as accurately as possible

70
0:02:59.774,000 --> 0:03:,000
and all in molecular detail.

71
0:03:01.735,000 --> 0:03:03,000
The animation will feature data

72
0:03:03.886,000 --> 0:03:05,000
from thousands of researchers collected over decades,

73
0:03:06.862,000 --> 0:03:09,000
data on what this virus looks like,

74
0:03:09.942,000 --> 0:03:12,000
how it's able to infect cells in our body,

75
0:03:13.03,000 --> 0:03:16,000
and how therapeutics are helping to combat infection.

76
0:03:17.002,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Over the years, I found that animations

77
0:03:19.331,000 --> 0:03:21,000
aren't just useful for communicating an idea,

78
0:03:22.15,000 --> 0:03:23,000
but they're also really useful

79
0:03:23.646,000 --> 0:03:25,000
for exploring a hypothesis.

80
0:03:25.958,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Biologists for the most part are still using a paper and pencil

81
0:03:29.152,000 --> 0:03:31,000
to visualize the processes they study,

82
0:03:31.374,000 --> 0:03:34,000
and with the data we have now, that's just not good enough anymore.

83
0:03:34.854,000 --> 0:03:36,000
The process of creating an animation

84
0:03:37.27,000 --> 0:03:39,000
can act as a catalyst that allows researchers

85
0:03:39.927,000 --> 0:03:41,000
to crystalize and refine their own ideas.

86
0:03:42.878,000 --> 0:03:43,000
One researcher I worked with

87
0:03:44.662,000 --> 0:03:45,000
who works on the molecular mechanisms

88
0:03:46.438,000 --> 0:03:47,000
of neurodegenerative diseases

89
0:03:48.222,000 --> 0:03:49,000
came up with experiments that were related

90
0:03:50.2,000 --> 0:03:52,000
directly to the animation that she and I worked on together,

91
0:03:53.183,000 --> 0:03:57,000
and in this way, animation can feed back into the research process.

92
0:03:57.304,000 --> 0:03:59,000
I believe that animation can change biology.

93
0:04:00.157,000 --> 0:04:02,000
It can change the way that we communicate with one another,

94
0:04:02.725,000 --> 0:04:03,000
how we explore our data

95
0:04:04.348,000 --> 0:04:05,000
and how we teach our students.

96
0:04:05.675,000 --> 0:04:06,000
But for that change to happen,

97
0:04:07.129,000 --> 0:04:1,000
we need more researchers creating animations,

98
0:04:10.286,000 --> 0:04:12,000
and toward that end, I brought together a team

99
0:04:12.541,000 --> 0:04:15,000
of biologists, animators and programmers

100
0:04:15.678,000 --> 0:04:18,000
to create a new, free, open-source software —

101
0:04:18.725,000 --> 0:04:19,000
we call it Molecular Flipbook —

102
0:04:20.629,000 --> 0:04:21,000
that's created just for biologists

103
0:04:22.525,000 --> 0:04:25,000
just to create molecular animations.

104
0:04:26.07,000 --> 0:04:29,000
From our testing, we've found that it only takes 15 minutes

105
0:04:29.782,000 --> 0:04:32,000
for a biologist who has never touched animation software before

106
0:04:33.05,000 --> 0:04:35,000
to create her first molecular animation

107
0:04:35.786,000 --> 0:04:36,000
of her own hypothesis.

108
0:04:37.308,000 --> 0:04:39,000
We're also building an online database

109
0:04:39.458,000 --> 0:04:41,000
where anyone can view, download and contribute

110
0:04:42.233,000 --> 0:04:43,000
their own animations.

111
0:04:43.849,000 --> 0:04:44,000
We're really excited to announce

112
0:04:45.82,000 --> 0:04:47,000
that the beta version of the molecular animation

113
0:04:48.282,000 --> 0:04:52,000
software toolkit will be available for download today.

114
0:04:52.49,000 --> 0:04:54,000
We are really excited to see what biologists will create with it

115
0:04:55.233,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and what new insights they're able to gain

116
0:04:57.289,000 --> 0:04:58,000
from finally being able to animate

117
0:04:58.77,000 --> 0:04:59,000
their own model figures.

118
0:05:00.473,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Thank you.

119
0:05:02.713,000 --> 0:05:05,000
(Applause)

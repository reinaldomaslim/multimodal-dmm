1
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
Most of the talks

2
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that you've heard in the last several fabulous days

3
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
have been from people who have the characteristic

4
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
that they have thought about something,

5
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
they are experts, they know what's going on.

6
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
All of you know about the topic

7
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:35,000
that I'm supposed to talk about.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:37,000
That is, you know what simplicity is,

9
0:00:37.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
you know what complexity is.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
The trouble is, I don't.

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
And what I'm going to do is share with you

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
my ignorance on this subject.

13
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
I want you to read this,

14
0:00:48.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
because we're going to come back to it in a moment.

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
The quote is from

16
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
the fabled Potter Stewart

17
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
opinion on pornography.

18
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
And let me just read it,

19
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:06,000
the important details here:

20
0:01:06.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
"Shorthand description, ['hardcore pornography'];

21
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
and perhaps I could never succeed in intelligibly defining it.

22
0:01:12.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
But I know it when I see it."

23
0:01:14.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I'm going to come back to that in a moment.

24
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:19,000
So, what is simplicity?

25
0:01:19.26,000 --> 0:01:21,000
It's good to start with some examples.

26
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
A coffee cup -- we don't think about coffee cups,

27
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
but it's much more interesting than one might think --

28
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
a coffee cup is a device,

29
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:33,000
which has a container and a handle.

30
0:01:33.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
The handle enables you to hold it

31
0:01:36.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
when the container is filled with hot liquid.

32
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Why is that important?

33
0:01:41.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Well, it enables you to drink coffee.

34
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
But also, by the way, the coffee is hot,

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:47,000
the liquid is sterile;

36
0:01:47.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
you're not likely to get cholera that way.

37
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
So the coffee cup, or the cup with a handle,

38
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is one of the tools used by society

39
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
to maintain public health.

40
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
Scissors are your clothes,

41
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
glasses enable you to see things

42
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
and keep you from being eaten by cheetahs

43
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
or run down by automobiles,

44
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and books are, after all, your education.

45
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But there's another class of simple things,

46
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:12,000
which are also very important.

47
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
Simple in function,

48
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:17,000
but not at all simple in how they're constructed.

49
0:02:17.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And the two here are just examples.

50
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:23,000
One is the cellphone, which we use every day.

51
0:02:23.26,000 --> 0:02:25,000
And it rests on a complexity,

52
0:02:25.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
which has some characteristics

53
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
very different from those that my friend

54
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Benoit Mandelbrot discussed,

55
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
but are very interesting.

56
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And the other, of course, is a birth control pill,

57
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:38,000
which, in a very simple way,

58
0:02:38.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
fundamentally changed the structure of society

59
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
by changing the role of women in it

60
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
by providing to them

61
0:02:45.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
the opportunity to make reproductive choices.

62
0:02:50.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
So, there are two ways of thinking about this word, I think.

63
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
And here I've corrupted

64
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
the Potter Stewart quotation

65
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
by saying that we can think about something --

66
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
which spans all the way from scissors

67
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to the cell phone,

68
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
Internet and birth control pills --

69
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
by saying that they're simple,

70
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
the functions are simple,

71
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
and we recognize what that simplicity is

72
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
when we see it.

73
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Or there may be another way of doing it,

74
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
which is to think about the problem in terms of what --

75
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
if you associate with moral philosophers --

76
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
is called the teapot problem.

77
0:03:29.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
The teapot problem I'll pose this way.

78
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Suppose you see a teapot,

79
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
and the teapot is

80
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
filled with hot water.

81
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
And you then ask the question:

82
0:03:41.26,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Why is the water hot?

83
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
And that's a simple question.

84
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:47,000
It's like, what is simplicity?

85
0:03:47.26,000 --> 0:03:49,000
One answer would be:

86
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:51,000
because the kinetic energy of the water molecules is high

87
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and they bounce against things rapidly --

88
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
that's a kind of physical science argument.

89
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
A second argument would be:

90
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
because it was sitting on a stove with the flame on --

91
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:03,000
that's an historical argument.

92
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
A third is that I wanted hot water

93
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
for tea --

94
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
that's an intentional argument.

95
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And, since this is coming from a moral philosopher,

96
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
the fourth would be that it's part of God's plan for the universe.

97
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
All of these are possibilities.

98
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
The point is that you get into trouble

99
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
when you ask a single question

100
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
with a single box for an answer,

101
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
in which that single question actually is many questions

102
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
with quite different meanings,

103
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
but with the same words.

104
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Asking, "What is simplicity?" I think falls in that category.

105
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:37,000
What is the state of science?

106
0:04:37.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
And, interestingly, complexity

107
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
is very highly evolved.

108
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
We have a lot of interesting information

109
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
about what complexity is.

110
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Simplicity, for reasons

111
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
that are a little bit obscure,

112
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
is almost not pursued,

113
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:53,000
at least in the academic world.

114
0:04:53.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
We academics -- I am an academic --

115
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
we love complexity.

116
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
You can write papers about complexity,

117
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:01,000
and the nice thing about complexity is

118
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
it's fundamentally intractable in many ways,

119
0:05:03.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
so you're not responsible for outcomes. (Laughter)

120
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
Simplicity -- all of you really would like

121
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
your Waring Blender in the morning

122
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
to make whatever a Waring Blender does,

123
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
but not explode or play Beethoven.

124
0:05:16.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
You're not interested in the limits of these things.

125
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
So what one is interested in

126
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
has a lot to do with the rewards of the system.

127
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:26,000
And there's a lot of rewards in thinking

128
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
about complexity and emergence,

129
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:31,000
not so much in thinking about simplicity.

130
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
One of the things I want to do

131
0:05:33.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
is to help you with a very important task --

132
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:39,000
which you may not know that you have very often --

133
0:05:39.26,000 --> 0:05:41,000
which is to understand

134
0:05:41.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
how to sit next to a physicist at a dinner party

135
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and have a conversation. (Laughter)

136
0:05:46.26,000 --> 0:05:49,000
And the words that I would like you to focus on

137
0:05:49.26,000 --> 0:05:51,000
are complexity and emergence,

138
0:05:51.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
because these will enable you to start the conversation

139
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:56,000
and then daydream about other things.

140
0:05:56.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
(Laughter)

141
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
All right, what is complexity in this view of things,

142
0:06:02.26,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and what is emergence?

143
0:06:04.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
We have, actually, a pretty good working definition of complexity.

144
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:09,000
It is a system, like traffic,

145
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:11,000
which has components.

146
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:13,000
The components interact with one another.

147
0:06:13.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
These are cars and drivers. They dissipate energy.

148
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:18,000
It turns out that, whenever you have that system,

149
0:06:18.26,000 --> 0:06:2,000
weird stuff happens,

150
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
and you in Los Angeles

151
0:06:22.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
probably know this better than anyone.

152
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
Here's another example,

153
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
which I put up because

154
0:06:29.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
it's an example of really important current science.

155
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:35,000
You can't possibly read that. It's not intended that you read it,

156
0:06:35.26,000 --> 0:06:37,000
but that's a tiny part

157
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
of the chemical reactions going on

158
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
in each of your cells at any given moment.

159
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
And it's like the traffic that you see.

160
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
The amazing thing about the cell is that

161
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
it actually does maintain a fairly stable

162
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
working relationship with other cells,

163
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
but we don't know why.

164
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Anyone who tells you that we understand life,

165
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:58,000
walk away.

166
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
And let me reduce this to the simplest level.

167
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
We've heard from Bill Gates recently.

168
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
All of us, to some extent, study

169
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:08,000
this thing called a Bill Gates.

170
0:07:08.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
Terrific. You learn everything you can about that.

171
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And then there's another kind of thing that you might study,

172
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
and you study that hard.

173
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
That's a Bono, this is a Bono.

174
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:2,000
But then, if you know everything you can know about those two things,

175
0:07:20.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and you put them together,

176
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
what can you say about this combination?

177
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
The answer is, not a lot.

178
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:28,000
And that's complexity.

179
0:07:28.26,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Now, imagine building that up to a city, or to a society,

180
0:07:31.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
and you've got, obviously, an interesting problem.

181
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
All right, so let me give you an example

182
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
of simplicity

183
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
of a particular kind.

184
0:07:41.26,000 --> 0:07:43,000
And I want to introduce a word

185
0:07:43.26,000 --> 0:07:45,000
that I think is very useful,

186
0:07:45.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
which is stacking.

187
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:5,000
And I'm going to use stacking for a kind of simplicity

188
0:07:50.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
that has the characteristic

189
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
that it is so simple

190
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
and so reliable

191
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
that I can build things with it.

192
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
Or I'm going to use simple to mean

193
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:03,000
reliable, predictable, repeatable.

194
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
And I'm going to use as an example the Internet,

195
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
because it's a particularly good example

196
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
of stacked simplicity.

197
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
We call it a complex system, which it is,

198
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
but it's also something else.

199
0:08:17.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
The Internet starts with mathematics,

200
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
it starts with binary.

201
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And if you look at the list of things on the bottom,

202
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
we are familiar with the Arabic numbers

203
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:29,000
one to 10 and so on.

204
0:08:29.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
In binary, one is 0001,

205
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
seven is 0111.

206
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:37,000
The question is: Why is binary

207
0:08:37.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
simpler than Arabic?

208
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
And the answer is, simply,

209
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
that if I hold up three fingers, you can count that easily,

210
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
but if I hold up this,

211
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
it's sort of hard to say that I just did seven.

212
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
The virtue of binary is that it's the simplest possible way

213
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
of representing numbers.

214
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
Anything else is more complicated.

215
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
You can catch errors with it,

216
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:08:59,000
it's unambiguous in its reading,

217
0:08:59.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
there are lots of good things about binary.

218
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
So it is very, very simple

219
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:05,000
once you learn how to read it.

220
0:09:05.26,000 --> 0:09:07,000
Now, if you like to represent

221
0:09:07.26,000 --> 0:09:09,000
this zero and one of binary,

222
0:09:09.26,000 --> 0:09:11,000
you need a device.

223
0:09:11.26,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And think of things in your life

224
0:09:13.26,000 --> 0:09:15,000
that are binary,

225
0:09:15.26,000 --> 0:09:17,000
one of them is light switches.

226
0:09:17.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
They can be on and off. That's binary.

227
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
Now wall switches, we all know, fail.

228
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
But our friends who are condensed matter physicists

229
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:28,000
managed to come up, some 50 years ago,

230
0:09:28.26,000 --> 0:09:31,000
with a very nice device, shown under that bell jar,

231
0:09:31.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
which is a transistor.

232
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
A transistor is nothing more than a wall switch.

233
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
It turns things on and off,

234
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
but it does so without moving parts

235
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and it doesn't fail, basically, for a very long period of time.

236
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So the second layer of simplicity

237
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
was the transistor in the Internet.

238
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
So, since the transistor is so simple,

239
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:53,000
you can put lots of them together.

240
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
And you put lots of them together and you come with

241
0:09:55.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
something called integrated circuits.

242
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And a current integrated circuit

243
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
might have in each one of these chips

244
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
something like a billion transistors,

245
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:06,000
all of which have to work perfectly every time.

246
0:10:06.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So that's the next layer of simplicity,

247
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
and, in fact, integrated circuits

248
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
are really simple in the sense that they,

249
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
in general, work really well.

250
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:18,000
With integrated circuits, you can build cellphones.

251
0:10:18.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
You all are accustomed to having your cellphones work

252
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
the large majority of the time.

253
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:25,000
In Boston ... Boston is a little bit like Namibia

254
0:10:25.26,000 --> 0:10:27,000
in its cell phone coverage, (Laughter)

255
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
so that we're not accustomed to that all the time,

256
0:10:29.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
but some of the time.

257
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
But, in fact, if you have cell phones,

258
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:36,000
you can now go to this nice lady

259
0:10:36.26,000 --> 0:10:38,000
who's somewhere like Namibia,

260
0:10:38.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and who is extremely happy with the fact

261
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
that although she does not have

262
0:10:42.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
an master's degree in

263
0:10:44.26,000 --> 0:10:46,000
electrical engineering from MIT,

264
0:10:46.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
she's nonetheless able to hack her cell phone

265
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:51,000
to get power in some funny way.

266
0:10:51.26,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And from that comes the Internet.

267
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
And this is a map of bitflows across the continent.

268
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
The two blobs that are light in the middle there

269
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
are the United States and Europe.

270
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:04,000
And then back to simplicity again.

271
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
So here we have what I think is one of the great ideas,

272
0:11:07.26,000 --> 0:11:09,000
which is Google.

273
0:11:09.26,000 --> 0:11:11,000
Which, in this simple portal

274
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
makes the claim

275
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
that it makes accessible

276
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:17,000
all of the world's information.

277
0:11:17.26,000 --> 0:11:19,000
But the point is that

278
0:11:19.26,000 --> 0:11:22,000
that extraordinary simple idea

279
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
rests on layers of simplicity

280
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
each compounded into a complexity

281
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
that is itself simple,

282
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
in the sense that it is completely reliable.

283
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
All right, let me then finish off

284
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:38,000
with four general statements,

285
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
an example and two aphorisms.

286
0:11:42.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
The characteristics, which I think

287
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
are useful to think about for simple things:

288
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
First, they are predictable.

289
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
Their behavior is predictable.

290
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Now, one of the nice characteristics

291
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
of simple things

292
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
is you know what it's going to do, in general.

293
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
So simplicity and predictability

294
0:12:01.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
are characteristics of simple things.

295
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
The second is, and this is a real world statement,

296
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
they're cheap.

297
0:12:09.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
If you have things that are cheap enough,

298
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:13,000
people will find uses for them,

299
0:12:13.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
even if they seem very primitive.

300
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
So, for example, stones.

301
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
You can build cathedrals out of stones,

302
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
you just have to know what it does.

303
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:24,000
You carve them in blocks and then you

304
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
pile them on top of one another,

305
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:28,000
and they support weight.

306
0:12:28.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
So there has to be function, the function has to be predictable

307
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and the cost has to be low.

308
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
What that means is

309
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
that you have to have a high performance

310
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
or value for cost.

311
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
And then I would propose

312
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:45,000
as this last component

313
0:12:45.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
that they serve, or have the potential to serve,

314
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:5,000
as building blocks.

315
0:12:50.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
That is, you can stack them.

316
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
And stack can mean this way, or it can mean this way,

317
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
or it can mean in some arbitrary n-dimensional space.

318
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:,000
But if you have something that has a function,

319
0:13:00.26,000 --> 0:13:02,000
and it's really cheap,

320
0:13:02.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
people will find new ways of putting it together

321
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:06,000
to make new things.

322
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
Cheap, functional, reliable things

323
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
unleash the creativity of people

324
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
who then build stuff that you could not imagine.

325
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
There's no way of predicting the Internet

326
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:19,000
based on the first transistor.

327
0:13:19.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
It just is not possible.

328
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
So these are the components.

329
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:26,000
Now, the example

330
0:13:26.26,000 --> 0:13:28,000
is something that I want to give you

331
0:13:28.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
from the work that we ourselves do.

332
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
We are very interested in

333
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:37,000
delivering health care in the developing world,

334
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
and one of the things that we wish to do in this particular business

335
0:13:40.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
is to find a way of doing medical diagnosis

336
0:13:43.26,000 --> 0:13:45,000
at as close to zero cost

337
0:13:45.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
as we can manage.

338
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
So, how does one do that?

339
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
This is a world in which there's no electricity,

340
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:54,000
there's no money, there's no medical competence.

341
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And I don't want to spend your time in going through the details,

342
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
but in the lower right-hand corner,

343
0:13:59.26,000 --> 0:14:02,000
you see an example of the kind of thing that we have.

344
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
It's a little paper chip.

345
0:14:04.26,000 --> 0:14:06,000
It has a few things printed on it

346
0:14:06.26,000 --> 0:14:08,000
using the same technology

347
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:1,000
that you use for making comic books,

348
0:14:10.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
which was the inspiration for this particular idea.

349
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
And you put a drop, in this case, of urine at the bottom.

350
0:14:16.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
It wicks its way up into these little branches.

351
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
You know, no power required.

352
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
It turns colors. In this particular case,

353
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
you're reading kidney function.

354
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:29,000
And, since the health care worker

355
0:14:29.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
of much of this part of the world

356
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:34,000
is an 18 year-old with an AK-47,

357
0:14:34.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
who happens to be out of work and is willing

358
0:14:36.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
to go around and do this sort of thing,

359
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
he can take a picture of it with his cellphone,

360
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:42,000
send the picture back to where there is a doctor,

361
0:14:42.26,000 --> 0:14:44,000
and the doctor can look at it.

362
0:14:44.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
So what you've done is to take a technology,

363
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
which is available everywhere,

364
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:52,000
make a device, which is extremely cheap,

365
0:14:52.26,000 --> 0:14:54,000
and make it in such a fashion

366
0:14:54.26,000 --> 0:14:56,000
that it is very, very reliable.

367
0:14:56.26,000 --> 0:14:58,000
If we can pull this off,

368
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:15:,000
if we can build more function,

369
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:02,000
it will be stackable.

370
0:15:02.26,000 --> 0:15:05,000
That is to say, if we can make the basic technology

371
0:15:05.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
of one or two things work,

372
0:15:07.26,000 --> 0:15:09,000
it will be applicable to a very, very

373
0:15:09.26,000 --> 0:15:11,000
large variety of human conditions,

374
0:15:11.26,000 --> 0:15:13,000
and hence, extendable in both

375
0:15:13.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
vertical and horizontal directions.

376
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:18,000
Part of my interest in this, I have to say,

377
0:15:18.26,000 --> 0:15:21,000
is that I would like to -- how do I put this politely? --

378
0:15:21.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
change the way, or maybe eviscerate,

379
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:26,000
the capital structure of the U.S. health care system,

380
0:15:26.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
which I think is fundamentally broken.

381
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:31,000
So, let me close --

382
0:15:31.26,000 --> 0:15:34,000
(Applause)

383
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
Let me close with my two aphorisms.

384
0:15:36.26,000 --> 0:15:38,000
One of them is from Mr. Einstein,

385
0:15:38.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
and he says, "Everything should be made

386
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
as simple as possible, but not simpler."

387
0:15:43.26,000 --> 0:15:46,000
And I think that's a very good way of thinking about the problem.

388
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
If you take too much out

389
0:15:48.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
of something that's simple, you lose function.

390
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:52,000
You have to have low cost,

391
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
but you also have to have a function.

392
0:15:54.26,000 --> 0:15:56,000
So you can't make it too simple.

393
0:15:56.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
And the second is a design issue,

394
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
and it's not directly relevant, but it's a nice statement.

395
0:16:01.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
This is by de Saint-Exupery.

396
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
And he says, "You know you've achieved perfection in design,

397
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
not when you have nothing more to add,

398
0:16:10.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
but when you have nothing more to take away."

399
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:15,000
And that certainly is going in the right direction.

400
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:19,000
So, what I think one can begin to do

401
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
with this kind of

402
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:24,000
cut at the word simplicity,

403
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:26,000
which doesn't cover Brancusi,

404
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
it doesn't answer the question of

405
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
why Mondrian is better or worse

406
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
or simpler or less simpler than Van Gogh,

407
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
and certainly doesn't address the question

408
0:16:35.26,000 --> 0:16:38,000
of whether Mozart is simpler than Bach.

409
0:16:38.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
But it does make a point --

410
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
which is one which, in a sense,

411
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:45,000
differentiates the real world of people who make things,

412
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
and the world of people who think about things,

413
0:16:48.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
which is, there is an intellectual merit

414
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
to asking: How do we make things

415
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
as simple as we can,

416
0:16:55.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
as cheap as we can, as functional as we can

417
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:01,000
and as freely interconnectable as we can?

418
0:17:01.26,000 --> 0:17:04,000
If we make that kind of simplicity in our technology

419
0:17:04.26,000 --> 0:17:06,000
and then give it to you guys,

420
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
you can go off and do all kinds of fabulous things with it.

421
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
Thank you very much.

422
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
(Applause)

423
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
Chris Anderson: Quick question.

424
0:17:22.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
So can you picture

425
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:27,000
that a science of simplicity

426
0:17:27.26,000 --> 0:17:29,000
might get to the point where

427
0:17:29.26,000 --> 0:17:31,000
you could look out at various systems --

428
0:17:31.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
say a financial system or a legal system, health system -- and say,

429
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:36,000
"That has got to the point of danger

430
0:17:36.26,000 --> 0:17:38,000
or dysfunctionality for the following reasons,

431
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:4,000
and this is how we might simplify it"?

432
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:42,000
George Whitesides: Yes, I think you could. Because if you look

433
0:17:42.26,000 --> 0:17:44,000
at the components from which the system is made

434
0:17:44.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
and examine their fragility, or their stability,

435
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:5,000
you can probably build a kind of risk assessment based on that basis.

436
0:17:50.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
CA: Have you started to do that?

437
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:54,000
I mean, with the health system, you got a sort of

438
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
radical solution on the cost side,

439
0:17:56.26,000 --> 0:17:58,000
but in terms of the system itself?

440
0:17:58.26,000 --> 0:18:,000
GW: Well, no.

441
0:18:00.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
How do I put that simply? No.

442
0:18:02.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
CA: That was a simple, powerful answer. GW: Yes.

443
0:18:05.26,000 --> 0:18:07,000
CA: So, in terms of

444
0:18:07.26,000 --> 0:18:09,000
that diagnostic technology that you've got,

445
0:18:09.26,000 --> 0:18:11,000
where is that, and when do you see that

446
0:18:11.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
maybe getting rolled out to scale.

447
0:18:13.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
GW: That's coming out soon. I mean, the systems work,

448
0:18:16.26,000 --> 0:18:18,000
and we have to find out how to manufacture them and do things of this kind,

449
0:18:18.26,000 --> 0:18:2,000
but the basic technology works.

450
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
CA: You've got a company set up to ...

451
0:18:22.26,000 --> 0:18:25,000
GW: A foundation, a foundation. Not-for-profit.

452
0:18:25.26,000 --> 0:18:28,000
CA: All right. Well, thank you so much for your talk. Thank you. (Applause)

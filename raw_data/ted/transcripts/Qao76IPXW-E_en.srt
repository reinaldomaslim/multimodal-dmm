1
0:00:13.04,000 --> 0:00:15,000
My mother was a philanthropist.

2
0:00:17,000 --> 0:00:19,000
And now I know you're asking --

3
0:00:19.2,000 --> 0:00:22,000
let me give you the answer: yes, a little bit like Melinda Gates --

4
0:00:22.76,000 --> 0:00:23,000
(Laughter)

5
0:00:24,000 --> 0:00:25,000
but with a lot less money.

6
0:00:25.96,000 --> 0:00:26,000
(Laughter)

7
0:00:28.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
She carried out her philanthropy in our community

8
0:00:32.8,000 --> 0:00:34,000
through a practice we call, "isirika."

9
0:00:36.2,000 --> 0:00:41,000
She supported the education of scores of children

10
0:00:41.24,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and invited many to live with us in our home

11
0:00:44.2,000 --> 0:00:45,000
in order to access schools.

12
0:00:46.76,000 --> 0:00:49,000
She mobilized resources for building the local health clinic

13
0:00:51.8,000 --> 0:00:55,000
and the maternity wing is named in memory of her.

14
0:00:57.36,000 --> 0:00:59,000
But most important,

15
0:00:59.6,000 --> 0:01:04,000
she was endeared by the community for her organizing skills,

16
0:01:05.56,000 --> 0:01:07,000
because she organized the community,

17
0:01:08.08,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and specifically women,

18
0:01:10.2,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to find solutions

19
0:01:12.32,000 --> 0:01:14,000
to anything that was needed.

20
0:01:15.2,000 --> 0:01:18,000
She did all of this through isirika.

21
0:01:19.24,000 --> 0:01:21,000
Let me repeat that word for you again:

22
0:01:21.68,000 --> 0:01:22,000
isirika.

23
0:01:22.92,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Now it's your turn. Say it with me.

24
0:01:24.8,000 --> 0:01:25,000
(Audience) Isirika.

25
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
Musimbi Kanyoro: Thank you.

26
0:01:27.68,000 --> 0:01:3,000
That word is in my language, Maragoli,

27
0:01:30.88,000 --> 0:01:31,000
spoken in western Kenya,

28
0:01:32.68,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and now you speak my language.

29
0:01:34.48,000 --> 0:01:35,000
(Laughter)

30
0:01:35.84,000 --> 0:01:4,000
So, isirika is a pragmatic way of life

31
0:01:41.04,000 --> 0:01:43,000
that embraces charity,

32
0:01:44,000 --> 0:01:45,000
services

33
0:01:45.28,000 --> 0:01:47,000
and philanthropy all together.

34
0:01:49.28,000 --> 0:01:5,000
The essence of isirika

35
0:01:52.84,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is to make it clear to everybody

36
0:01:56.44,000 --> 0:01:58,000
that you're your sister's keeper --

37
0:01:58.64,000 --> 0:01:59,000
and yes,

38
0:01:59.96,000 --> 0:02:,000
you're your brother's keeper.

39
0:02:03.04,000 --> 0:02:07,000
Mutual responsibility for caring for one another.

40
0:02:09,000 --> 0:02:14,000
A literal, simple English translation would be equal generosity,

41
0:02:14.88,000 --> 0:02:16,000
but the deep philosophical meaning

42
0:02:17.4,000 --> 0:02:21,000
is caring, together, for one another.

43
0:02:22.84,000 --> 0:02:24,000
So how does isirika really happen?

44
0:02:26.44,000 --> 0:02:3,000
I grew up in a farming community

45
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
in western Kenya.

46
0:02:34.04,000 --> 0:02:37,000
I remember vividly the many times

47
0:02:37.48,000 --> 0:02:4,000
that neighbors would go to a neighbor's home --

48
0:02:40.8,000 --> 0:02:41,000
a sick neighbor's home --

49
0:02:42.4,000 --> 0:02:43,000
and harvest their crop for them.

50
0:02:45.52,000 --> 0:02:49,000
I tagged alongside with my mother to community events

51
0:02:50.08,000 --> 0:02:51,000
and to women's events,

52
0:02:52.08,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and had the conversation about vaccinations in school,

53
0:02:57.08,000 --> 0:02:58,000
building the health center

54
0:02:58.84,000 --> 0:02:59,000
and really big things --

55
0:03:00.12,000 --> 0:03:03,000
renewing seeds for the next planting season.

56
0:03:04.8,000 --> 0:03:07,000
And often, the community would come together

57
0:03:07.92,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to contribute money to send a neighbor's child to school --

58
0:03:12.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
not only in the country

59
0:03:15.28,000 --> 0:03:17,000
but to universities abroad as well.

60
0:03:18.24,000 --> 0:03:19,000
And so we have a surgeon.

61
0:03:20.72,000 --> 0:03:23,000
The first surgeon in my country came from that rural village.

62
0:03:24.64,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Applause)

63
0:03:28.72,000 --> 0:03:29,000
So ...

64
0:03:30.44,000 --> 0:03:33,000
what isirika did was to be inclusive.

65
0:03:34.32,000 --> 0:03:38,000
We as children would stand alongside the adults

66
0:03:38.4,000 --> 0:03:4,000
and give our contributions of money,

67
0:03:40.76,000 --> 0:03:43,000
and our names were inscripted in the community book

68
0:03:44.2,000 --> 0:03:46,000
just like every adult.

69
0:03:47.52,000 --> 0:03:48,000
And then I grew up,

70
0:03:49.16,000 --> 0:03:53,000
went to universities back at home and abroad,

71
0:03:53.4,000 --> 0:03:55,000
obtained a few degrees here and there,

72
0:03:56.36,000 --> 0:03:57,000
became organized

73
0:03:58.2,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and took up international jobs,

74
0:04:01.44,000 --> 0:04:03,000
working in development,

75
0:04:03.56,000 --> 0:04:04,000
humanitarian work

76
0:04:05.48,000 --> 0:04:06,000
and philanthropy.

77
0:04:07.68,000 --> 0:04:08,000
And very soon,

78
0:04:10.24,000 --> 0:04:12,000
isirika began to become small.

79
0:04:14.16,000 --> 0:04:15,000
It dissipated

80
0:04:15.56,000 --> 0:04:16,000
and then just disappeared.

81
0:04:18,000 --> 0:04:19,000
In each place,

82
0:04:19.36,000 --> 0:04:2,000
I gained a new vocabulary.

83
0:04:21.32,000 --> 0:04:24,000
The vocabulary of donors and recipients.

84
0:04:25.96,000 --> 0:04:29,000
The vocabulary of measuring impact,

85
0:04:30.48,000 --> 0:04:31,000
return on investment ...

86
0:04:33.56,000 --> 0:04:34,000
projects and programs.

87
0:04:36.8,000 --> 0:04:38,000
Communities such as my childhood community

88
0:04:39.6,000 --> 0:04:43,000
became referred to as "poor, vulnerable populations."

89
0:04:45.2,000 --> 0:04:48,000
Those are the communities of which literature speaks about

90
0:04:49.04,000 --> 0:04:52,000
as living on less than a dollar a day,

91
0:04:53,000 --> 0:04:57,000
and they become the targets for poverty eradication programs.

92
0:04:57.2,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And by the way,

93
0:04:58.52,000 --> 0:05:,000
they are the targets of our first

94
0:05:01.2,000 --> 0:05:04,000
United Nations' sustainable development goal.

95
0:05:07.32,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Now, I'm really interested

96
0:05:10.8,000 --> 0:05:12,000
that we find solutions to poverty

97
0:05:13.32,000 --> 0:05:15,000
and to the world's other many big problems

98
0:05:16.08,000 --> 0:05:17,000
because they do exist.

99
0:05:18.76,000 --> 0:05:21,000
I however think that we could do a better job,

100
0:05:22.24,000 --> 0:05:26,000
and we could do a better job by embracing isirika.

101
0:05:26.48,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So let me tell you how.

102
0:05:28.88,000 --> 0:05:31,000
First, isirika affirms common humanity.

103
0:05:33.08,000 --> 0:05:35,000
For whatever that you do,

104
0:05:35.32,000 --> 0:05:38,000
you begin from the premise that you're human together.

105
0:05:40.36,000 --> 0:05:42,000
When you begin that you're human together,

106
0:05:42.92,000 --> 0:05:44,000
you see each other differently.

107
0:05:45.92,000 --> 0:05:47,000
You don't see a refugee first

108
0:05:48.8,000 --> 0:05:5,000
and you don't see a woman first

109
0:05:51.44,000 --> 0:05:54,000
and you don't see a person with disability first.

110
0:05:54.68,000 --> 0:05:56,000
You see a human being first.

111
0:05:57.6,000 --> 0:06:,000
That is the essence of seeing a person first.

112
0:06:00.92,000 --> 0:06:01,000
And when you do that,

113
0:06:02.8,000 --> 0:06:04,000
you value their ideas,

114
0:06:05.04,000 --> 0:06:06,000
you value their contribution --

115
0:06:06.92,000 --> 0:06:07,000
small or big.

116
0:06:09.04,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And you value what they bring to the table.

117
0:06:12.8,000 --> 0:06:14,000
That is the essence of isirika.

118
0:06:17.4,000 --> 0:06:2,000
I just want to imagine what it would look like

119
0:06:21.04,000 --> 0:06:23,000
if everyone in this room --

120
0:06:23.92,000 --> 0:06:24,000
a medical doctor, a parent,

121
0:06:25.88,000 --> 0:06:26,000
a lawyer, a philanthropist,

122
0:06:28.96,000 --> 0:06:29,000
whatever you are --

123
0:06:30.52,000 --> 0:06:33,000
if you embraced isirika

124
0:06:33.64,000 --> 0:06:34,000
and made it your default.

125
0:06:36.28,000 --> 0:06:38,000
What could we achieve for each other?

126
0:06:39.24,000 --> 0:06:41,000
What could we achieve for humanity?

127
0:06:42.72,000 --> 0:06:45,000
What could we achieve for peace issues?

128
0:06:46.08,000 --> 0:06:5,000
What could we achieve for medical science?

129
0:06:51.24,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Let me give you a couple of hints,

130
0:06:53.32,000 --> 0:06:56,000
because I'm going to ask you to accompany me

131
0:06:57.04,000 --> 0:07:02,000
in this process of rebuilding and reclaiming isirika with me.

132
0:07:04.08,000 --> 0:07:07,000
First, you have to have faith

133
0:07:08.16,000 --> 0:07:1,000
that we are one humanity,

134
0:07:10.36,000 --> 0:07:12,000
we have one planet

135
0:07:12.4,000 --> 0:07:14,000
and we don't have two choices about that.

136
0:07:14.68,000 --> 0:07:17,000
So there's not going to be a wall that is high enough

137
0:07:18.36,000 --> 0:07:19,000
to separate humanity.

138
0:07:19.96,000 --> 0:07:2,000
So give up the walls.

139
0:07:21.8,000 --> 0:07:22,000
Give them up.

140
0:07:23.08,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Applause)

141
0:07:24.84,000 --> 0:07:27,000
And we don't have a planet B to go to.

142
0:07:28.24,000 --> 0:07:29,000
So that's really important.

143
0:07:3,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Make that clear;

144
0:07:31.44,000 --> 0:07:32,000
move onto the next stage.

145
0:07:33,000 --> 0:07:35,000
The second stage: remember,

146
0:07:36.68,000 --> 0:07:38,000
in isirika, every idea counts.

147
0:07:40.56,000 --> 0:07:42,000
Bridges have big posters

148
0:07:43,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and they have nails.

149
0:07:46.56,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Every idea counts --

150
0:07:48.04,000 --> 0:07:5,000
small or big counts.

151
0:07:51.28,000 --> 0:07:52,000
And third,

152
0:07:52.76,000 --> 0:07:53,000
isirika affirms

153
0:07:54.08,000 --> 0:07:59,000
that those who have more really enjoy the privilege of giving more.

154
0:07:59.88,000 --> 0:08:01,000
It is a privilege to give more.

155
0:08:02,000 --> 0:08:04,000
(Applause)

156
0:08:04.2,000 --> 0:08:09,000
And this is the time for women to give more for women.

157
0:08:09.88,000 --> 0:08:11,000
It is the time to give more for women.

158
0:08:13.52,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Our parents, when they brought in other children to live with us,

159
0:08:18.32,000 --> 0:08:19,000
they didn't ask our permission.

160
0:08:21,000 --> 0:08:24,000
They made it clear that they had a responsibility

161
0:08:24.28,000 --> 0:08:26,000
because they had gone to school

162
0:08:26.72,000 --> 0:08:27,000
and they had an earning.

163
0:08:29.08,000 --> 0:08:31,000
And they made it clear that we should understand

164
0:08:31.64,000 --> 0:08:35,000
that their prosperity was not our entitlement,

165
0:08:36.52,000 --> 0:08:38,000
and I think that's good wisdom from isirika.

166
0:08:39.32,000 --> 0:08:42,000
We could use that wisdom today, I think, in every culture,

167
0:08:43.32,000 --> 0:08:44,000
in every place,

168
0:08:45.88,000 --> 0:08:49,000
passing to the next generation what we could do together.

169
0:08:51.64,000 --> 0:08:52,000
I have,

170
0:08:53.559,000 --> 0:08:54,000
over the years,

171
0:08:55.159,000 --> 0:08:57,000
encountered isirika in many places,

172
0:08:59.12,000 --> 0:09:02,000
but what gives me really the passion today

173
0:09:02.6,000 --> 0:09:03,000
to embrace isirika

174
0:09:04.44,000 --> 0:09:07,000
is the work that I do with women all over the world

175
0:09:07.76,000 --> 0:09:09,000
through the Global Fund for Women,

176
0:09:10.04,000 --> 0:09:11,000
though women's funds

177
0:09:11.52,000 --> 0:09:13,000
and through women's movements globally.

178
0:09:14.92,000 --> 0:09:15,000
If you work with women,

179
0:09:16.48,000 --> 0:09:18,000
you change every day

180
0:09:18.68,000 --> 0:09:22,000
because you experience them living isirika together in what they do.

181
0:09:25.16,000 --> 0:09:26,000
In the work that I do,

182
0:09:26.44,000 --> 0:09:29,000
we trust women leaders and their ideas.

183
0:09:31.36,000 --> 0:09:35,000
And we support them with funding so that they can expand,

184
0:09:36.08,000 --> 0:09:37,000
they can grow

185
0:09:37.6,000 --> 0:09:4,000
and they can thrive within their own communities.

186
0:09:42.44,000 --> 0:09:47,000
A woman in 1990 came to the Global Fund with a big idea --

187
0:09:47.76,000 --> 0:09:5,000
a woman from Mexico by the name of Lucero González.

188
0:09:51.64,000 --> 0:09:55,000
She wanted to begin a fund that would support a movement

189
0:09:56.6,000 --> 0:09:58,000
that would be rooted in the communities in Mexico.

190
0:09:59.52,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And she received a grant of 7,500 US dollars.

191
0:10:06.64,000 --> 0:10:08,000
Today, 25 years later,

192
0:10:10.2,000 --> 0:10:12,000
Semillas, the name of the fund,

193
0:10:13.04,000 --> 0:10:15,000
has raised and spent,

194
0:10:15.4,000 --> 0:10:16,000
within the community,

195
0:10:17.04,000 --> 0:10:2,000
17.8 million dollars.

196
0:10:20.6,000 --> 0:10:22,000
(Applause)

197
0:10:23.44,000 --> 0:10:29,000
They have impacted over two million people,

198
0:10:30.28,000 --> 0:10:35,000
and they work with a group of 600,000 women in Mexico.

199
0:10:36.76,000 --> 0:10:39,000
During the recent earthquake,

200
0:10:41.16,000 --> 0:10:42,000
they were so well rooted

201
0:10:43.12,000 --> 0:10:47,000
that they could quickly assess within the community and with others,

202
0:10:48,000 --> 0:10:52,000
what were the short-term needs and what were the long-term needs.

203
0:10:52.56,000 --> 0:10:53,000
And I tell you,

204
0:10:54.16,000 --> 0:10:57,000
long after the lights have gone off Mexico,

205
0:10:57.92,000 --> 0:10:59,000
Semillas will be there

206
0:11:00.4,000 --> 0:11:02,000
with the communities, with the women,

207
0:11:02.92,000 --> 0:11:03,000
for a very long time.

208
0:11:04.92,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And that's what I'm talking about:

209
0:11:07.32,000 --> 0:11:11,000
when we are able to support the ideas of communities

210
0:11:11.92,000 --> 0:11:14,000
that are rooted within their own setting.

211
0:11:15.76,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Thirty years ago,

212
0:11:18.52,000 --> 0:11:22,000
there was very little funding that went directly to women's hands

213
0:11:23.32,000 --> 0:11:24,000
in their communities.

214
0:11:25.4,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Today we celebrate 168 women's funds

215
0:11:31.6,000 --> 0:11:32,000
all over the world,

216
0:11:32.96,000 --> 0:11:34,000
100 of which are in this country.

217
0:11:36.68,000 --> 0:11:37,000
And they support --

218
0:11:38.16,000 --> 0:11:39,000
(Applause)

219
0:11:39.84,000 --> 0:11:41,000
they support grassroots women's organizations --

220
0:11:44.08,000 --> 0:11:49,000
community organizations under the leadership of girls and women,

221
0:11:49.28,000 --> 0:11:51,000
and together we have been able,

222
0:11:51.84,000 --> 0:11:52,000
collectively,

223
0:11:53.08,000 --> 0:11:58,000
to give a billion dollars to women and girls-led organizations.

224
0:11:58.72,000 --> 0:12:03,000
(Applause)

225
0:12:03.88,000 --> 0:12:06,000
But the challenge begins today.

226
0:12:07.84,000 --> 0:12:08,000
The challenge begins today

227
0:12:09.64,000 --> 0:12:14,000
because we see women everywhere organizing as isirika,

228
0:12:15.16,000 --> 0:12:19,000
including women organizing as isirika in TED.

229
0:12:20.44,000 --> 0:12:24,000
Because isirika is the evergreen wisdom that lives in communities.

230
0:12:26.48,000 --> 0:12:28,000
You find it in indigenous communities,

231
0:12:29.28,000 --> 0:12:3,000
in rural communities.

232
0:12:31.68,000 --> 0:12:35,000
And what it really ingrains in people

233
0:12:36,000 --> 0:12:39,000
is that ability to trust

234
0:12:39.04,000 --> 0:12:42,000
and to move the agenda ahead.

235
0:12:43.04,000 --> 0:12:46,000
So, three things that I have learned that I want to share with you

236
0:12:46.88,000 --> 0:12:47,000
through my work.

237
0:12:48.4,000 --> 0:12:54,000
One: if you want to solve the world's biggest problems,

238
0:12:54.68,000 --> 0:12:57,000
invest in women and girls.

239
0:12:57.92,000 --> 0:13:02,000
(Applause)

240
0:13:03.24,000 --> 0:13:06,000
Not only do they expand the investment,

241
0:13:06.28,000 --> 0:13:08,000
but they care for everyone in the community.

242
0:13:08.68,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Not only their needs but the needs of their children,

243
0:13:12.6,000 --> 0:13:14,000
the needs of the rest of the community,

244
0:13:14.68,000 --> 0:13:15,000
the needs of the elderly,

245
0:13:16.56,000 --> 0:13:17,000
and most important,

246
0:13:18.32,000 --> 0:13:2,000
they protect themselves --

247
0:13:21.12,000 --> 0:13:22,000
which is really important --

248
0:13:23,000 --> 0:13:25,000
and they protect their communities.

249
0:13:26.36,000 --> 0:13:28,000
Women who know how to protect themselves

250
0:13:29,000 --> 0:13:31,000
know what it means to make a difference.

251
0:13:32.36,000 --> 0:13:35,000
And the second reason that I'm asking you to invest in women and girls

252
0:13:36.28,000 --> 0:13:4,000
is because this is the smartest thing you could ever do

253
0:13:40.88,000 --> 0:13:41,000
at this particular time.

254
0:13:42.72,000 --> 0:13:44,000
And if we are going to have

255
0:13:45.28,000 --> 0:13:49,000
over 350 trillion dollars

256
0:13:49.56,000 --> 0:13:5,000
by 2030,

257
0:13:51.12,000 --> 0:13:54,000
those dollars need to be in the hands of women.

258
0:13:54.4,000 --> 0:13:57,000
And so I grew up with isirika.

259
0:13:58.24,000 --> 0:13:59,000
My mother was isirika.

260
0:14:,000 --> 0:14:02,000
She was not a project or a program.

261
0:14:03.24,000 --> 0:14:05,000
And now, I pass that to you.

262
0:14:05.96,000 --> 0:14:08,000
That you will be able to share this with your families,

263
0:14:09.12,000 --> 0:14:1,000
with your friends

264
0:14:10.6,000 --> 0:14:11,000
and with your community,

265
0:14:12.4,000 --> 0:14:16,000
and embrace isirika as a way of living --

266
0:14:16.92,000 --> 0:14:18,000
as a pragmatic way of living.

267
0:14:19.24,000 --> 0:14:2,000
Thank you.

268
0:14:20.48,000 --> 0:14:21,000
(Applause)

269
0:14:22.28,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Thank you.

270
0:14:23.52,000 --> 0:14:24,000
(Applause)

271
0:14:24.8,000 --> 0:14:25,000
Thank you.

272
0:14:26.04,000 --> 0:14:28,000
(Applause)

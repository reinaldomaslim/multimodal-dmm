1
0:00:13.595,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Like a lot of people around the world,

2
0:00:15.542,000 --> 0:00:17,000
earlier this summer my friends and I were obsessed

3
0:00:18.167,000 --> 0:00:2,000
with the Women's World Cup held in France.

4
0:00:20.667,000 --> 0:00:22,000
Here we are, watching these incredible athletes,

5
0:00:23.542,000 --> 0:00:26,000
the goals were amazing, the games were clean and engaging,

6
0:00:27.125,000 --> 0:00:29,000
and at the same time, outside the field,

7
0:00:29.917,000 --> 0:00:3,000
these women are talking about equal pay,

8
0:00:31.917,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and in the case of some countries, any pay at all for their sport.

9
0:00:35.542,000 --> 0:00:38,000
So because we were mildly obsessed, we wanted to watch the games live,

10
0:00:39.083,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and we decided that one of the Spanish-speaking networks in the US

11
0:00:42.875,000 --> 0:00:44,000
was the best place for us to start.

12
0:00:44.917,000 --> 0:00:46,000
And it wasn't until a few games into the tournament

13
0:00:47.875,000 --> 0:00:49,000
that a friend of mine talks to me and says,

14
0:00:50.417,000 --> 0:00:52,000
"Why does it feel like everything I'm seeing

15
0:00:52.583,000 --> 0:00:55,000
is commercials for makeup and household cleaning products and diets?"

16
0:00:56.917,000 --> 0:00:57,000
It did feel a little bit too obvious,

17
0:00:58.792,000 --> 0:01:,000
and I don't know if we were sensitive about it

18
0:01:01.042,000 --> 0:01:04,000
or the fact that we were watching with men and boys in our lives,

19
0:01:04.208,000 --> 0:01:05,000
but it did feel a little bit too obvious

20
0:01:06.208,000 --> 0:01:09,000
that we're being targeted for being women.

21
0:01:09.25,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And to be honest there's nothing necessarily wrong with that.

22
0:01:12.833,000 --> 0:01:15,000
Someone sat down and looked at the tournament and said,

23
0:01:16.042,000 --> 0:01:19,000
"Well, this thing is likely to be seen by more women,

24
0:01:19.708,000 --> 0:01:21,000
these women are Hispanic because they're watching in Spanish,

25
0:01:22.625,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and this is women content.

26
0:01:23.917,000 --> 0:01:26,000
Therefore, this is a great place for me to place all these commercials

27
0:01:27.292,000 --> 0:01:3,000
that are female-centric and maybe not other things."

28
0:01:30.417,000 --> 0:01:31,000
If I think about it as a marketer,

29
0:01:32.125,000 --> 0:01:34,000
I know that I absolutely should not be annoyed about it,

30
0:01:34.792,000 --> 0:01:37,000
because this is what marketers are tasked with doing.

31
0:01:38.083,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Marketers are tasked with building brands with very limited budget,

32
0:01:41.75,000 --> 0:01:43,000
so there's a little bit of an incentive

33
0:01:44.208,000 --> 0:01:45,000
to categorize people in buckets

34
0:01:46.208,000 --> 0:01:47,000
so they can reach their target faster.

35
0:01:48.083,000 --> 0:01:49,000
So if you think about this,

36
0:01:49.458,000 --> 0:01:5,000
it's kind of like a shortcut.

37
0:01:50.958,000 --> 0:01:53,000
They're using gender as a shortcut to get to their target consumer.

38
0:01:55.292,000 --> 0:01:58,000
The issue is that as logical as that argument seems,

39
0:01:59.25,000 --> 0:02:02,000
gender as a shortcut is actually not great.

40
0:02:02.583,000 --> 0:02:05,000
In this day and age, if you still blindly use a gender view

41
0:02:05.833,000 --> 0:02:06,000
for your marketing activities,

42
0:02:07.417,000 --> 0:02:09,000
actually it's just plain bad business.

43
0:02:10.333,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I'm not talking even about the backlash on stereotypes in advertising,

44
0:02:13.917,000 --> 0:02:16,000
which is a very real thing that has to be addressed.

45
0:02:17.125,000 --> 0:02:2,000
I'm saying it's bad business because you're leaving money on the table

46
0:02:20.458,000 --> 0:02:21,000
for your brands and your products.

47
0:02:22.25,000 --> 0:02:25,000
Because gender is such an easy thing to find in the market

48
0:02:25.375,000 --> 0:02:26,000
and to target and to talk about,

49
0:02:27.292,000 --> 0:02:29,000
it actually distracts you from the fun things

50
0:02:29.625,000 --> 0:02:31,000
that could be driving growth from your brands

51
0:02:31.875,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and, at the same time,

52
0:02:33.208,000 --> 0:02:35,000
it continues to create separation around genders

53
0:02:35.875,000 --> 0:02:36,000
and perpetuate stereotypes.

54
0:02:37.667,000 --> 0:02:4,000
So at the same time this activity is bad for your business

55
0:02:40.875,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and bad for society, so double whammy.

56
0:02:43.875,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And gender is one of those things like other demographics

57
0:02:47.417,000 --> 0:02:49,000
that have historically been good marketing shortcuts.

58
0:02:50.125,000 --> 0:02:51,000
At some point, however,

59
0:02:51.75,000 --> 0:02:53,000
we forgot that at the core we were targeting needs

60
0:02:54.25,000 --> 0:02:58,000
around cooking and cleaning and personal care and driving and sports

61
0:02:59,000 --> 0:03:,000
and we just made it all a bucket

62
0:03:00.75,000 --> 0:03:02,000
and we said, "Men and women are different."

63
0:03:02.875,000 --> 0:03:04,000
We got used to it and we never challenged it again,

64
0:03:05.5,000 --> 0:03:06,000
and it's fascinating to me,

65
0:03:07.125,000 --> 0:03:09,000
and by fascinating I mean a little bit insane,

66
0:03:09.875,000 --> 0:03:11,000
that we still talk about this as a segment

67
0:03:12.417,000 --> 0:03:15,000
when it's most likely carryover bias.

68
0:03:15.625,000 --> 0:03:17,000
In fact, I don't come to this conclusion lightly.

69
0:03:18.458,000 --> 0:03:21,000
We have enough data to suggest that gender is not the best place

70
0:03:22.25,000 --> 0:03:25,000
to start for you to design and target your brands.

71
0:03:25.708,000 --> 0:03:27,000
And I would even go one step further:

72
0:03:27.75,000 --> 0:03:31,000
unless you are working in a very gender-specific product category,

73
0:03:32.25,000 --> 0:03:33,000
probably anything else

74
0:03:33.583,000 --> 0:03:35,000
you're hypothesizing about your consumer right now

75
0:03:36.167,000 --> 0:03:37,000
is going to be more useful than gender.

76
0:03:39.917,000 --> 0:03:41,000
We did not set up to draw this conclusion specifically.

77
0:03:42.875,000 --> 0:03:43,000
We found it.

78
0:03:44.167,000 --> 0:03:46,000
As consultants, our job is to go with our clients

79
0:03:46.667,000 --> 0:03:47,000
and understand their business

80
0:03:48.167,000 --> 0:03:51,000
and try to help them find spaces for their brands to grow.

81
0:03:51.708,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And it is our belief that if you want to find disruptive growth in the market,

82
0:03:56.083,000 --> 0:03:57,000
you have to go to the consumer

83
0:03:57.875,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and take a very agnostic view of the consumer.

84
0:04:00.125,000 --> 0:04:02,000
You have to go and look at them from scratch,

85
0:04:02.417,000 --> 0:04:06,000
remove yourself from biases and segments that you thought were important,

86
0:04:06.833,000 --> 0:04:08,000
just take a look to see where the growth is.

87
0:04:09.833,000 --> 0:04:11,000
And we built ourselves an algorithm precisely for that.

88
0:04:12.792,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So imagine that we have a person

89
0:04:15.375,000 --> 0:04:17,000
and we know a person is making a choice

90
0:04:17.667,000 --> 0:04:18,000
about a product or service,

91
0:04:19.625,000 --> 0:04:22,000
and from this person, I can know their gender, of course,

92
0:04:22.708,000 --> 0:04:25,000
other demographics, where they live, their income, other things.

93
0:04:25.958,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I know the context where this person is making a decision,

94
0:04:29.167,000 --> 0:04:31,000
where they are, who they're with,

95
0:04:31.208,000 --> 0:04:32,000
the energy, anything,

96
0:04:33.042,000 --> 0:04:35,000
and I can also put other things in the mix.

97
0:04:35.125,000 --> 0:04:36,000
I can know their attitudes,

98
0:04:36.5,000 --> 0:04:37,000
how they feel about the category,

99
0:04:38.167,000 --> 0:04:39,000
their behaviors.

100
0:04:39.583,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So if you imagine this kind of blob of big data about a person --

101
0:04:44.208,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I'm going to oversimplify the science here

102
0:04:46.292,000 --> 0:04:49,000
but we basically built an algorithm for statistical tournaments.

103
0:04:49.708,000 --> 0:04:53,000
So a statistical tournament is like asking this big thing of data,

104
0:04:54.167,000 --> 0:04:58,000
"So, data, from everything you know about consumers at this point,

105
0:04:58.792,000 --> 0:05:,000
what is the most useful thing I need to know

106
0:05:01.5,000 --> 0:05:04,000
that tells me more about what consumers need?"

107
0:05:04.542,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So the tournament is going to have winners and losers.

108
0:05:07.125,000 --> 0:05:09,000
The winners are those variables, those dimensions,

109
0:05:09.542,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that actually teach you a lot about your consumer,

110
0:05:11.917,000 --> 0:05:13,000
that if you know that, you know what they need.

111
0:05:14.208,000 --> 0:05:16,000
And there's losing variables that are just not that practical,

112
0:05:17.208,000 --> 0:05:2,000
and this matters because in a world of limited resources,

113
0:05:20.417,000 --> 0:05:23,000
you don't want to waste it on people that actually have the same needs.

114
0:05:23.833,000 --> 0:05:25,000
So why treat them differently?

115
0:05:25.917,000 --> 0:05:27,000
So at this point, I know, suspense is not killing you,

116
0:05:28.542,000 --> 0:05:29,000
because I told you what the output is,

117
0:05:30.458,000 --> 0:05:32,000
but what we found over time

118
0:05:32.917,000 --> 0:05:36,000
is after 200 projects around the world -- this is covering 20 countries or more --

119
0:05:37.458,000 --> 0:05:4,000
in essence we ran about a hundred thousand of these tournaments,

120
0:05:41.333,000 --> 0:05:46,000
and, no surprise, gender was very rarely the most predictive thing

121
0:05:46.417,000 --> 0:05:47,000
to understand consumer needs.

122
0:05:49.292,000 --> 0:05:5,000
From a hundred thousand tournaments,

123
0:05:51.208,000 --> 0:05:53,000
gender only came out as the winning variable

124
0:05:53.625,000 --> 0:05:54,000
in about five percent of them.

125
0:05:55.958,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This is true around the world, by the way.

126
0:05:58.042,000 --> 0:06:,000
We did this in places where traditional gender roles

127
0:06:00.583,000 --> 0:06:02,000
are a little more pronounced,

128
0:06:02.958,000 --> 0:06:04,000
and the conclusions were exactly the same.

129
0:06:05.042,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It was a little bit more important, gender, than five percent,

130
0:06:08,000 --> 0:06:09,000
but not material.

131
0:06:09.292,000 --> 0:06:11,000
So let's let that sink in for a second.

132
0:06:11.5,000 --> 0:06:13,000
No matter how you're looking at a consumer,

133
0:06:13.875,000 --> 0:06:17,000
most likely anything else is going to be more interesting to you than gender.

134
0:06:18.25,000 --> 0:06:21,000
There's probably something very important you need to know about them,

135
0:06:21.667,000 --> 0:06:24,000
and you're getting distracted because you're doing everything based on gender.

136
0:06:25.375,000 --> 0:06:27,000
And that's why I say you're leaving money on the table.

137
0:06:28,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Gender is easy. It's easy to design advertising based on gender,

138
0:06:31.083,000 --> 0:06:35,000
it's easy to target people online and on TV based on gender.

139
0:06:35.5,000 --> 0:06:38,000
But at the end, that's not where the exciting growth will come from.

140
0:06:38.875,000 --> 0:06:42,000
If you're a food company, for example, it's actually much more interesting to you

141
0:06:43.125,000 --> 0:06:46,000
to know where people are eating, who they are eating with,

142
0:06:46.75,000 --> 0:06:48,000
are they very nutritionally oriented.

143
0:06:49.208,000 --> 0:06:52,000
All of those things are actually significantly more powerful and useful

144
0:06:52.958,000 --> 0:06:54,000
than knowing if a person is a man or a woman.

145
0:06:55.417,000 --> 0:06:56,000
And that matters, of course,

146
0:06:56.833,000 --> 0:06:59,000
because then if you're putting your limited budget into action,

147
0:07:00.125,000 --> 0:07:03,000
then you're better off creating solutions for different occasions

148
0:07:03.208,000 --> 0:07:05,000
than trying to target women versus young men.

149
0:07:06.917,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Another example is alcoholic beverages.

150
0:07:09.25,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Thirty-five percent to 40 percent of consumption in alcoholic beverages

151
0:07:12.625,000 --> 0:07:14,000
around the world actually happens with women,

152
0:07:14.792,000 --> 0:07:15,000
but, you know, "women don't drink beer."

153
0:07:16.792,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Those are the things that we typically hear.

154
0:07:20.583,000 --> 0:07:24,000
But actually, when a man and a woman are, for the most part, in the same location,

155
0:07:24.625,000 --> 0:07:26,000
the emotional and functional needs they have at that moment

156
0:07:27.583,000 --> 0:07:28,000
are very similar.

157
0:07:29.167,000 --> 0:07:31,000
There's only one exception, by the way,

158
0:07:31.292,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and the exceptions exist,

159
0:07:33.083,000 --> 0:07:34,000
where if you have a man and a woman

160
0:07:34.833,000 --> 0:07:35,000
on a date,

161
0:07:36.167,000 --> 0:07:38,000
the man is trying to impress the woman

162
0:07:38.542,000 --> 0:07:4,000
and the woman is trying to connect with the man,

163
0:07:40.875,000 --> 0:07:42,000
so there's going to be a little bit of tension,

164
0:07:43.125,000 --> 0:07:44,000
but that's important to know.

165
0:07:44.625,000 --> 0:07:45,000
We'll take a few dates.

166
0:07:45.917,000 --> 0:07:48,000
Financial institutions: that's something where we've heard a lot

167
0:07:49,000 --> 0:07:51,000
about the difference between men and women,

168
0:07:51.083,000 --> 0:07:53,000
but actually talking about men and women as different

169
0:07:53.625,000 --> 0:07:55,000
is distracting you from the thing that is underneath.

170
0:07:56.25,000 --> 0:07:59,000
We made it so simple as "women don't like to invest,"

171
0:07:59.5,000 --> 0:08:,000
"women hate managing their money,"

172
0:08:01.208,000 --> 0:08:03,000
"men are great and aggressive and risk-takers,"

173
0:08:03.625,000 --> 0:08:05,000
but at the end it's not about men and women.

174
0:08:05.792,000 --> 0:08:06,000
It is actually a different narrative.

175
0:08:07.625,000 --> 0:08:1,000
It is about, there are people that are excited and energized

176
0:08:10.917,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and educated to manage their finances

177
0:08:13.5,000 --> 0:08:14,000
versus people that are not.

178
0:08:14.958,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So if you change the conversation

179
0:08:16.708,000 --> 0:08:18,000
from men and women to actually what's underneath

180
0:08:19.542,000 --> 0:08:22,000
then probably you'll stop being so condescending to women

181
0:08:22.875,000 --> 0:08:23,000
and you may start serving some men

182
0:08:24.583,000 --> 0:08:27,000
that are actually shy about managing their finances.

183
0:08:27.667,000 --> 0:08:28,000
I'll leave one more example.

184
0:08:29.292,000 --> 0:08:32,000
If I go back to the women that were playing sport at the beginning,

185
0:08:32.5,000 --> 0:08:35,000
one of the fascinating things we found over different countries,

186
0:08:36.125,000 --> 0:08:38,000
exploring sportswear,

187
0:08:38.458,000 --> 0:08:4,000
that if a person is a competitive person

188
0:08:40.542,000 --> 0:08:42,000
and they are in the moment of action,

189
0:08:42.792,000 --> 0:08:44,000
the needs are not different between a man and a woman.

190
0:08:45.417,000 --> 0:08:46,000
An athlete is an athlete.

191
0:08:46.75,000 --> 0:08:49,000
It doesn't matter for men and women, it doesn't matter for old and young,

192
0:08:50.208,000 --> 0:08:51,000
you are an athlete,

193
0:08:51.5,000 --> 0:08:53,000
and in the moment of action and extreme competition,

194
0:08:54,000 --> 0:08:55,000
you need this gear to work for you.

195
0:08:55.75,000 --> 0:08:58,000
So these soccer-playing women have a lot in common with their counterparts.

196
0:08:59.333,000 --> 0:09:,000
Out of the field, it doesn't matter.

197
0:09:01.167,000 --> 0:09:03,000
Out of the field, they may be into fashion, into other things,

198
0:09:04.125,000 --> 0:09:06,000
but on the field, the needs are not different.

199
0:09:06.708,000 --> 0:09:09,000
So these are just a few examples on categories where we found

200
0:09:10.458,000 --> 0:09:12,000
that gender was not the best place to go,

201
0:09:13.25,000 --> 0:09:15,000
and actually the argument is

202
0:09:15.583,000 --> 0:09:17,000
that at this point it's not even a feminist push,

203
0:09:17.958,000 --> 0:09:18,000
it's just we got used to it.

204
0:09:19.458,000 --> 0:09:2,000
We got used to using gender,

205
0:09:20.875,000 --> 0:09:23,000
and it's important for us to start finding ways

206
0:09:24.042,000 --> 0:09:26,000
to measure other things about consumers

207
0:09:26.25,000 --> 0:09:28,000
so that we don't revert back to gender.

208
0:09:28.708,000 --> 0:09:29,000
I am not naïve,

209
0:09:30.042,000 --> 0:09:32,000
and I know there's still going to be appetite

210
0:09:32.25,000 --> 0:09:33,000
and certain ease around using gender,

211
0:09:34.125,000 --> 0:09:36,000
but at least this warrants a conversation.

212
0:09:36.208,000 --> 0:09:37,000
In your business, you have to inquire,

213
0:09:38.125,000 --> 0:09:4,000
is this really the best lens for me to grow.

214
0:09:41.125,000 --> 0:09:44,000
So, if you are, like me, a person that is in business,

215
0:09:44.667,000 --> 0:09:47,000
that I am constantly worried about what is my role

216
0:09:48.667,000 --> 0:09:51,000
in the broader societal discussions,

217
0:09:51.75,000 --> 0:09:53,000
if you're listening to your business and you hear things like,

218
0:09:54.75,000 --> 0:09:56,000
"Oh, my target are women, my target are men,

219
0:09:56.917,000 --> 0:09:58,000
this goes to young girls, young boys,"

220
0:09:59.625,000 --> 0:10:,000
when it's that gender conversation,

221
0:10:01.542,000 --> 0:10:02,000
unless you are working, again,

222
0:10:03.083,000 --> 0:10:07,000
in a very specific, gender-specific product category,

223
0:10:07.25,000 --> 0:10:08,000
take this as a warning sign,

224
0:10:08.75,000 --> 0:10:1,000
because if you keep having these conversations,

225
0:10:11.625,000 --> 0:10:13,000
you will keep perpetuating stereotypes of people

226
0:10:14.167,000 --> 0:10:16,000
and making people think that men and women are different.

227
0:10:16.875,000 --> 0:10:18,000
But because this is business, and we're running a business,

228
0:10:19.708,000 --> 0:10:2,000
and we want to grow it,

229
0:10:21.042,000 --> 0:10:23,000
at least kind of challenge your own instinct to use gender,

230
0:10:23.875,000 --> 0:10:26,000
because statistics say that you're probably not choosing the best variable

231
0:10:27.417,000 --> 0:10:28,000
to target your product or service.

232
0:10:29.333,000 --> 0:10:31,000
Growth is not easy at all.

233
0:10:31.583,000 --> 0:10:33,000
What makes you think that growth is going to come

234
0:10:33.958,000 --> 0:10:36,000
from going into market with such an outdated lens like gender?

235
0:10:37.375,000 --> 0:10:39,000
So let's stop doing what's easy and go for what's right.

236
0:10:40.083,000 --> 0:10:43,000
At this point, it's not just for your business, it's for society.

237
0:10:43.625,000 --> 0:10:44,000
Thank you.

238
0:10:45.042,000 --> 0:10:48,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.125,000 --> 0:00:14,000
Ah, earth's oceans.

2
0:00:14.667,000 --> 0:00:17,000
They are beautiful, inspiring, life-sustaining.

3
0:00:18.25,000 --> 0:00:21,000
They are also, as you're probably quite aware, more or less screwed.

4
0:00:22.417,000 --> 0:00:23,000
In the Seychelles, for example,

5
0:00:23.958,000 --> 0:00:26,000
human activities and climate change have left corals bleached.

6
0:00:27.458,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Overfishing has caused fish stocks to plummet.

7
0:00:30.042,000 --> 0:00:31,000
Biodiversity is in peril.

8
0:00:31.875,000 --> 0:00:32,000
So what can we do?

9
0:00:33.208,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Well, some form of protection, obviously.

10
0:00:35.875,000 --> 0:00:36,000
Nature is very resilient.

11
0:00:37.625,000 --> 0:00:39,000
When marine areas are strategically protected,

12
0:00:39.833,000 --> 0:00:41,000
entire ecosystems can bounce back.

13
0:00:42.292,000 --> 0:00:44,000
However, creating marine protected areas isn't easy.

14
0:00:45.25,000 --> 0:00:47,000
First, you have the issue of figuring out where to protect.

15
0:00:48.125,000 --> 0:00:51,000
This coral reef overlaps with that international fishing route,

16
0:00:51.25,000 --> 0:00:53,000
intersects with this fish hatchery.

17
0:00:53.417,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Everything is interconnected.

18
0:00:55.125,000 --> 0:00:57,000
And marine protection plans must take into account

19
0:00:57.5,000 --> 0:00:58,000
how one area affects another.

20
0:00:59.458,000 --> 0:01:01,000
Then, there's the issue of getting everyone on board.

21
0:01:02,000 --> 0:01:04,000
Coastal economies often rely on fishing and tourism.

22
0:01:04.833,000 --> 0:01:06,000
If people think they can't do their work,

23
0:01:06.875,000 --> 0:01:08,000
there's no chance of getting the local buy-in you need

24
0:01:09.458,000 --> 0:01:1,000
for the area to be successful.

25
0:01:11.042,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Marine protected areas must also be enforced.

26
0:01:13.667,000 --> 0:01:16,000
That means the government itself must be deeply invested in the plan.

27
0:01:17.208,000 --> 0:01:18,000
Token support will not cut it.

28
0:01:18.958,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And finally, conservation requires money.

29
0:01:21.542,000 --> 0:01:22,000
A lot of it.

30
0:01:22.833,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Governments in island and coastal nations may want to protect their waters,

31
0:01:26.417,000 --> 0:01:28,000
but often these nations have very high debt

32
0:01:28.5,000 --> 0:01:3,000
and can't afford to prioritize conservation.

33
0:01:31.042,000 --> 0:01:34,000
If we rely on philanthropic dollars alone to fund marine protection,

34
0:01:34.5,000 --> 0:01:36,000
we might get a small marine-protected area here,

35
0:01:36.917,000 --> 0:01:37,000
another little one there.

36
0:01:38.208,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But we need more marine protected areas faster,

37
0:01:40.833,000 --> 0:01:41,000
to have lasting impact.

38
0:01:42.5,000 --> 0:01:45,000
So what exactly does smart ocean conservation look like?

39
0:01:45.875,000 --> 0:01:48,000
How do we get the money, government support and careful planning

40
0:01:49.208,000 --> 0:01:51,000
that takes into account both local economies

41
0:01:51.708,000 --> 0:01:53,000
and complex ecosystems?

42
0:01:53.917,000 --> 0:01:55,000
We want to share with you an audacious idea

43
0:01:56.208,000 --> 0:01:57,000
from The Nature Conservancy.

44
0:01:57.833,000 --> 0:01:59,000
It seeks to address all of these things in one fell swoop.

45
0:02:00.625,000 --> 0:02:03,000
They've realized that debt held by island and coastal nations

46
0:02:03.792,000 --> 0:02:07,000
is the very thing that will enable them to achieve their conservation goals.

47
0:02:07.833,000 --> 0:02:09,000
TNC's idea is to restructure this debt,

48
0:02:10.208,000 --> 0:02:12,000
to generate the funds and political will

49
0:02:12.417,000 --> 0:02:15,000
to protect reefs, mangroves and fisheries.

50
0:02:15.708,000 --> 0:02:17,000
For example, if you refinance your house

51
0:02:18.167,000 --> 0:02:2,000
to take advantage of a better interest rate,

52
0:02:20.292,000 --> 0:02:22,000
maybe you use the savings to insulate your attic.

53
0:02:22.875,000 --> 0:02:25,000
That's what Blue Bonds for Conservation do for entire coastal countries.

54
0:02:26.75,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Refinance the debt,

55
0:02:28.042,000 --> 0:02:31,000
then use the savings to create marine protected areas.

56
0:02:31.083,000 --> 0:02:34,000
Of course, sovereign debt restructuring is more complicated than that,

57
0:02:34.417,000 --> 0:02:35,000
but you get the basic idea.

58
0:02:36.042,000 --> 0:02:38,000
If investors put in 40 million dollars now,

59
0:02:38.5,000 --> 0:02:41,000
it can unlock as much as 1.6 billion for ocean conservation.

60
0:02:42.458,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And this is how the work gets done.

61
0:02:44.208,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Step one: negotiate the deal.

62
0:02:46.625,000 --> 0:02:5,000
A coastal nation commits to protect at least 30 percent of its ocean areas.

63
0:02:50.958,000 --> 0:02:54,000
In exchange, The Nature Conservancy bring investors, public funders

64
0:02:55.167,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and international development organizations

65
0:02:57.25,000 --> 0:02:59,000
to the table to restructure a portion of the nation's debt,

66
0:03:00.083,000 --> 0:03:03,000
leading to lower interest rates and longer repayment periods.

67
0:03:03.125,000 --> 0:03:05,000
Step two: create a marine plan.

68
0:03:05.583,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Simultaneously, The Nature Conservancy works with marine scientists,

69
0:03:09.292,000 --> 0:03:11,000
government leaders and local stakeholders

70
0:03:11.375,000 --> 0:03:13,000
to create a detailed conservation plan

71
0:03:13.708,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that integrates the needs of the ocean with the needs of the people.

72
0:03:16.958,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Step three: activate for longevity.

73
0:03:19.5,000 --> 0:03:22,000
TNC establishes an independently run conservation trust fund.

74
0:03:23.5,000 --> 0:03:25,000
The savings from the debt restructure goes into it

75
0:03:25.875,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to support new marine protected areas.

76
0:03:27.875,000 --> 0:03:3,000
The trust then holds the government accountable for its commitments,

77
0:03:31.125,000 --> 0:03:34,000
ensuring that the Blue Bonds finance real protection efforts.

78
0:03:34.208,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Could this plan work?

79
0:03:35.708,000 --> 0:03:36,000
It already has.

80
0:03:37.75,000 --> 0:03:41,000
In 2016, TNC helped create a national conservation plan in the Seychelles.

81
0:03:43.417,000 --> 0:03:46,000
TNC restructured 22 million dollars of the government's debt.

82
0:03:47,000 --> 0:03:51,000
And in exchange, the government agreed to protect 30 percent of its marine areas.

83
0:03:51.5,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Today, the Seychelles is on track

84
0:03:53.167,000 --> 0:03:56,000
to protect 400,000 square kilometers of ocean.

85
0:03:56.542,000 --> 0:03:58,000
That's an area roughly the size of Germany.

86
0:03:58.917,000 --> 0:04:,000
The Seychelles is protecting its coral reefs,

87
0:04:01.208,000 --> 0:04:02,000
it's replenishing its fisheries,

88
0:04:02.917,000 --> 0:04:04,000
it's improving its resilience to climate change.

89
0:04:05.792,000 --> 0:04:08,000
At the same time, it's strengthening its economy.

90
0:04:09,000 --> 0:04:11,000
This success is making other governments take note.

91
0:04:11.708,000 --> 0:04:12,000
Many want to be part of this.

92
0:04:13.292,000 --> 0:04:15,000
There's an opportunity to scale this up, dramatically.

93
0:04:16.042,000 --> 0:04:17,000
And fast.

94
0:04:17.333,000 --> 0:04:21,000
TNC has identified 20 more nations where such a plan should be possible.

95
0:04:21.583,000 --> 0:04:22,000
But to execute, they need seed capital.

96
0:04:23.5,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And to put in place local teams who can develop conservation plans,

97
0:04:26.708,000 --> 0:04:28,000
work with all the stakeholders and structure the deals.

98
0:04:29.333,000 --> 0:04:32,000
If they get the support they need over the next five years,

99
0:04:32.375,000 --> 0:04:34,000
they could protect four million square kilometers of ocean.

100
0:04:35.208,000 --> 0:04:36,000
That's 10 Germanies.

101
0:04:36.542,000 --> 0:04:38,000
This would increase the amount of protected areas

102
0:04:38.875,000 --> 0:04:39,000
in all of the world's oceans

103
0:04:40.292,000 --> 0:04:41,000
by an incredible 15 percent.

104
0:04:42,000 --> 0:04:45,000
It would allow vast tracks of the world's coral reefs to replenish

105
0:04:45.458,000 --> 0:04:47,000
and give safe harbor to countless species.

106
0:04:48.417,000 --> 0:04:49,000
This would be truly incredible.

107
0:04:50.375,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And it's really just the beginning.

108
0:04:52.125,000 --> 0:04:54,000
Because there aren't 20 countries in the world

109
0:04:54.333,000 --> 0:04:56,000
where this kind of debt conversion would work.

110
0:04:56.542,000 --> 0:04:57,000
There are almost 100.

111
0:04:57.833,000 --> 0:04:59,000
With this approach, everyone wins.

112
0:05:,000 --> 0:05:03,000
Governments, local citizens, funders,

113
0:05:03.292,000 --> 0:05:05,000
and most importantly, our oceans.

114
0:05:05.875,000 --> 0:05:06,000
So in fact, we all win.

115
0:05:08.917,000 --> 0:05:1,000
Ah, earth's oceans.

116
0:05:13.792,000 --> 0:05:15,000

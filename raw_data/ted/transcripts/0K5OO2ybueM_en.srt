1
0:00:12.748,000 --> 0:00:14,000
So, a few years ago I heard an interesting rumor.

2
0:00:16.209,000 --> 0:00:18,000
Apparently, the head of a large pet food company

3
0:00:18.621,000 --> 0:00:2,000
would go into the annual shareholder's meeting

4
0:00:20.9,000 --> 0:00:21,000
with can of dog food.

5
0:00:22.385,000 --> 0:00:24,000
And he would eat the can of dog food.

6
0:00:24.51,000 --> 0:00:27,000
And this was his way of convincing them that if it was good enough for him,

7
0:00:28.087,000 --> 0:00:29,000
it was good enough for their pets.

8
0:00:29.788,000 --> 0:00:31,000
This strategy is now known as "dogfooding,"

9
0:00:32.248,000 --> 0:00:34,000
and it's a common strategy in the business world.

10
0:00:34.591,000 --> 0:00:36,000
It doesn't mean everyone goes in and eats dog food,

11
0:00:37.099,000 --> 0:00:39,000
but businesspeople will use their own products

12
0:00:39.344,000 --> 0:00:4,000
to demonstrate that they feel --

13
0:00:40.905,000 --> 0:00:41,000
that they're confident in them.

14
0:00:42.634,000 --> 0:00:43,000
Now, this is a widespread practice,

15
0:00:44.583,000 --> 0:00:47,000
but I think what's really interesting is when you find exceptions

16
0:00:47.702,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to this rule,

17
0:00:48.877,000 --> 0:00:5,000
when you find cases of businesses or people in businesses

18
0:00:51.608,000 --> 0:00:52,000
who don't use their own products.

19
0:00:53.226,000 --> 0:00:56,000
Turns out there's one industry where this happens in a common way,

20
0:00:56.371,000 --> 0:00:57,000
in a pretty regular way,

21
0:00:57.555,000 --> 0:00:59,000
and that is the screen-based tech industry.

22
0:01:00.013,000 --> 0:01:04,000
So, in 2010, Steve Jobs, when he was releasing the iPad,

23
0:01:04.431,000 --> 0:01:07,000
described the iPad as a device that was "extraordinary."

24
0:01:08.197,000 --> 0:01:1,000
"The best browsing experience you've ever had;

25
0:01:10.761,000 --> 0:01:12,000
way better than a laptop, way better than a smartphone.

26
0:01:13.518,000 --> 0:01:14,000
It's an incredible experience."

27
0:01:15.069,000 --> 0:01:17,000
A couple of months later, he was approached by a journalist

28
0:01:17.878,000 --> 0:01:18,000
from the New York Times,

29
0:01:19.058,000 --> 0:01:2,000
and they had a long phone call.

30
0:01:20.581,000 --> 0:01:21,000
At the end of the call,

31
0:01:21.775,000 --> 0:01:24,000
the journalist threw in a question that seemed like a sort of softball.

32
0:01:25.189,000 --> 0:01:27,000
He said to him, "Your kids must love the iPad."

33
0:01:28.623,000 --> 0:01:29,000
There's an obvious answer to this,

34
0:01:30.276,000 --> 0:01:32,000
but what Jobs said really staggered the journalist.

35
0:01:32.919,000 --> 0:01:33,000
He was very surprised,

36
0:01:34.134,000 --> 0:01:36,000
because he said, "They haven't used it.

37
0:01:36.733,000 --> 0:01:38,000
We limit how much technology our kids use at home."

38
0:01:39.679,000 --> 0:01:42,000
This is a very common thing in the tech world.

39
0:01:43.566,000 --> 0:01:45,000
In fact, there's a school quite near Silicon Valley

40
0:01:46.025,000 --> 0:01:48,000
called the Waldorf School of the Peninsula,

41
0:01:48.322,000 --> 0:01:51,000
and they don't introduce screens until the eighth grade.

42
0:01:51.51,000 --> 0:01:53,000
What's really interesting about the school

43
0:01:53.576,000 --> 0:01:55,000
is that 75 percent of the kids who go there

44
0:01:55.649,000 --> 0:01:58,000
have parents who are high-level Silicon Valley tech execs.

45
0:01:59.162,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So when I heard about this, I thought it was interesting and surprising,

46
0:02:02.701,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and it pushed me to consider what screens were doing to me

47
0:02:05.757,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and to my family and the people I loved,

48
0:02:07.738,000 --> 0:02:08,000
and to people at large.

49
0:02:09.024,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So for the last five years,

50
0:02:10.97,000 --> 0:02:12,000
as a professor of business and psychology,

51
0:02:13.027,000 --> 0:02:15,000
I've been studying the effect of screens on our lives.

52
0:02:16.709,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And I want to start by just focusing on how much time they take from us,

53
0:02:20.815,000 --> 0:02:22,000
and then we can talk about what that time looks like.

54
0:02:23.345,000 --> 0:02:25,000
What I'm showing you here is the average 24-hour workday

55
0:02:26.036,000 --> 0:02:28,000
at three different points in history:

56
0:02:28.398,000 --> 0:02:3,000
2007 -- 10 years ago --

57
0:02:30.424,000 --> 0:02:31,000
2015

58
0:02:31.907,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and then data that I collected, actually, only last week.

59
0:02:34.949,000 --> 0:02:35,000
And a lot of things haven't changed

60
0:02:36.722,000 --> 0:02:37,000
all that much.

61
0:02:39.14,000 --> 0:02:41,000
We sleep roughly seven-and-a-half to eight hours a day;

62
0:02:41.939,000 --> 0:02:44,000
some people say that's declined slightly, but it hasn't changed much.

63
0:02:45.28,000 --> 0:02:48,000
We work eight-and-a-half to nine hours a day.

64
0:02:48.558,000 --> 0:02:49,000
We engage in survival activities --

65
0:02:50.314,000 --> 0:02:53,000
these are things like eating and bathing and looking after kids --

66
0:02:53.465,000 --> 0:02:54,000
about three hours a day.

67
0:02:54.645,000 --> 0:02:55,000
That leaves this white space.

68
0:02:56.197,000 --> 0:02:57,000
That's our personal time.

69
0:02:57.888,000 --> 0:02:59,000
That space is incredibly important to us.

70
0:03:01.114,000 --> 0:03:03,000
That's the space where we do things that make us individuals.

71
0:03:04.012,000 --> 0:03:07,000
That's where hobbies happen, where we have close relationships,

72
0:03:07.137,000 --> 0:03:09,000
where we really think about our lives, where we get creative,

73
0:03:10.043,000 --> 0:03:11,000
where we zoom back and try to work out

74
0:03:11.881,000 --> 0:03:12,000
whether our lives have been meaningful.

75
0:03:13.765,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We get some of that from work as well,

76
0:03:15.617,000 --> 0:03:16,000
but when people look back on their lives

77
0:03:17.556,000 --> 0:03:19,000
and wonder what their lives have been like

78
0:03:19.584,000 --> 0:03:2,000
at the end of their lives,

79
0:03:20.851,000 --> 0:03:21,000
you look at the last things they say --

80
0:03:22.762,000 --> 0:03:25,000
they are talking about those moments that happen in that white personal space.

81
0:03:26.487,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So it's sacred; it's important to us.

82
0:03:28.514,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Now, what I'm going to do is show you

83
0:03:30.389,000 --> 0:03:33,000
how much of that space is taken up by screens across time.

84
0:03:33.665,000 --> 0:03:34,000
In 2007,

85
0:03:35.014,000 --> 0:03:36,000
this much.

86
0:03:36.189,000 --> 0:03:38,000
That was the year that Apple introduced the first iPhone.

87
0:03:39.193,000 --> 0:03:4,000
Eight years later,

88
0:03:41.059,000 --> 0:03:42,000
this much.

89
0:03:43.138,000 --> 0:03:44,000
Now, this much.

90
0:03:44.951,000 --> 0:03:47,000
That's how much time we spend of that free time in front of our screens.

91
0:03:48.413,000 --> 0:03:51,000
This yellow area, this thin sliver, is where the magic happens.

92
0:03:51.74,000 --> 0:03:52,000
That's where your humanity lives.

93
0:03:53.346,000 --> 0:03:55,000
And right now, it's in a very small box.

94
0:03:56.063,000 --> 0:03:57,000
So what do we do about this?

95
0:03:57.712,000 --> 0:03:58,000
Well, the first question is:

96
0:03:59.093,000 --> 0:04:,000
What does that red space look like?

97
0:04:00.976,000 --> 0:04:02,000
Now, of course, screens are miraculous

98
0:04:03.105,000 --> 0:04:04,000
in a lot of ways.

99
0:04:04.557,000 --> 0:04:05,000
I live in New York,

100
0:04:05.838,000 --> 0:04:06,000
a lot of my family lives in Australia,

101
0:04:07.86,000 --> 0:04:08,000
and I have a one-year-old son.

102
0:04:09.314,000 --> 0:04:12,000
The way I've been able to introduce them to him is with screens.

103
0:04:13.236,000 --> 0:04:15,000
I couldn't have done that 15 or 20 years ago

104
0:04:15.35,000 --> 0:04:16,000
in quite the same way.

105
0:04:16.532,000 --> 0:04:18,000
So there's a lot of good that comes from them.

106
0:04:18.713,000 --> 0:04:19,000
One thing you can do is ask yourself:

107
0:04:20.583,000 --> 0:04:22,000
What goes on during that time?

108
0:04:22.69,000 --> 0:04:24,000
How enriching are the apps that we're using?

109
0:04:25.152,000 --> 0:04:26,000
And some are enriching.

110
0:04:26.45,000 --> 0:04:28,000
If you stop people while they're using them and say,

111
0:04:28.916,000 --> 0:04:29,000
"Tell us how you feel right now,"

112
0:04:30.528,000 --> 0:04:32,000
they say they feel pretty good about these apps --

113
0:04:32.948,000 --> 0:04:35,000
those that focus on relaxation, exercise, weather, reading,

114
0:04:36.332,000 --> 0:04:37,000
education and health.

115
0:04:37.899,000 --> 0:04:4,000
They spend an average of nine minutes a day on each of these.

116
0:04:41.057,000 --> 0:04:43,000
These apps make them much less happy.

117
0:04:43.919,000 --> 0:04:46,000
About half the people, when you interrupt them and say, "How do you feel?"

118
0:04:47.547,000 --> 0:04:49,000
say they don't feel good about using them.

119
0:04:49.679,000 --> 0:04:5,000
What's interesting about these --

120
0:04:51.334,000 --> 0:04:52,000
dating, social networking, gaming,

121
0:04:53.068,000 --> 0:04:55,000
entertainment, news, web browsing --

122
0:04:55.818,000 --> 0:04:57,000
people spend 27 minutes a day on each of these.

123
0:04:58.448,000 --> 0:05:01,000
We're spending three times longer on the apps that don't make us happy.

124
0:05:02.024,000 --> 0:05:03,000
That doesn't seem very wise.

125
0:05:04.706,000 --> 0:05:06,000
One of the reasons we spend so much time on these apps

126
0:05:07.268,000 --> 0:05:08,000
that make us unhappy

127
0:05:08.444,000 --> 0:05:09,000
is they rob us of stopping cues.

128
0:05:1,000 --> 0:05:12,000
Stopping cues were everywhere in the 20th century.

129
0:05:12.403,000 --> 0:05:13,000
They were baked into everything we did.

130
0:05:14.291,000 --> 0:05:17,000
A stopping cue is basically a signal that it's time to move on,

131
0:05:17.731,000 --> 0:05:19,000
to do something new, to do something different.

132
0:05:20.452,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And -- think about newspapers; eventually you get to the end,

133
0:05:23.672,000 --> 0:05:25,000
you fold the newspaper away, you put it aside.

134
0:05:25.993,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The same with magazines, books -- you get to the end of a chapter,

135
0:05:29.175,000 --> 0:05:31,000
prompts you to consider whether you want to continue.

136
0:05:32.324,000 --> 0:05:34,000
You watched a show on TV, eventually the show would end,

137
0:05:35.046,000 --> 0:05:37,000
and then you'd have a week until the next one came.

138
0:05:37.475,000 --> 0:05:38,000
There were stopping cues everywhere.

139
0:05:39.253,000 --> 0:05:42,000
But the way we consume media today is such that there are no stopping cues.

140
0:05:43.743,000 --> 0:05:44,000
The news feed just rolls on,

141
0:05:45.342,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and everything's bottomless: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,

142
0:05:49.039,000 --> 0:05:52,000
email, text messaging, the news.

143
0:05:52.205,000 --> 0:05:54,000
And when you do check all sorts of other sources,

144
0:05:55.199,000 --> 0:05:57,000
you can just keep going on and on and on.

145
0:05:57.564,000 --> 0:06:01,000
So, we can get a cue about what to do from Western Europe,

146
0:06:01.998,000 --> 0:06:04,000
where they seem to have a number of pretty good ideas in the workplace.

147
0:06:05.423,000 --> 0:06:07,000
Here's one example. This is a Dutch design firm.

148
0:06:07.855,000 --> 0:06:1,000
And what they've done is rigged the desks to the ceiling.

149
0:06:11.265,000 --> 0:06:12,000
And at 6pm every day,

150
0:06:12.441,000 --> 0:06:14,000
it doesn't matter who you're emailing or what you're doing,

151
0:06:15.272,000 --> 0:06:16,000
the desks rise to the ceiling.

152
0:06:16.773,000 --> 0:06:17,000
(Laughter)

153
0:06:17.905,000 --> 0:06:18,000
(Applause)

154
0:06:19.179,000 --> 0:06:23,000
Four days a week, the space turns into a yoga studio,

155
0:06:23.446,000 --> 0:06:24,000
one day a week, into a dance club.

156
0:06:25.101,000 --> 0:06:27,000
It's really up to you which ones you stick around for.

157
0:06:27.654,000 --> 0:06:28,000
But this is a great stopping rule,

158
0:06:29.365,000 --> 0:06:3,000
because it means at the end of the day,

159
0:06:31.276,000 --> 0:06:33,000
everything stops, there's no way to work.

160
0:06:33.337,000 --> 0:06:36,000
At Daimler, the German car company, they've got another great strategy.

161
0:06:36.805,000 --> 0:06:37,000
When you go on vacation,

162
0:06:38.359,000 --> 0:06:4,000
instead of saying, "This person's on vacation,

163
0:06:40.587,000 --> 0:06:41,000
they'll get back to you eventually,"

164
0:06:42.334,000 --> 0:06:45,000
they say, "This person's on vacation, so we've deleted your email.

165
0:06:45.58,000 --> 0:06:47,000
This person will never see the email you just sent."

166
0:06:48.25,000 --> 0:06:49,000
(Laughter)

167
0:06:49.29,000 --> 0:06:51,000
"You can email back in a couple of weeks,

168
0:06:51.955,000 --> 0:06:52,000
or you can email someone else."

169
0:06:53.465,000 --> 0:06:54,000
(Laughter)

170
0:06:54.517,000 --> 0:06:55,000
And so --

171
0:06:55.713,000 --> 0:06:58,000
(Applause)

172
0:07:00.702,000 --> 0:07:01,000
You can imagine what that's like.

173
0:07:02.364,000 --> 0:07:04,000
You go on vacation, and you're actually on vacation.

174
0:07:04.846,000 --> 0:07:05,000
The people who work at this company feel

175
0:07:06.839,000 --> 0:07:08,000
that they actually get a break from work.

176
0:07:09.225,000 --> 0:07:1,000
But of course, that doesn't tell us much

177
0:07:11.166,000 --> 0:07:13,000
about what we should do at home in our own lives,

178
0:07:13.489,000 --> 0:07:14,000
so I want to make some suggestions.

179
0:07:15.195,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It's easy to say, between 5 and 6pm, I'm going to not use my phone.

180
0:07:19.712,000 --> 0:07:22,000
The problem is, 5 and 6pm looks different on different days.

181
0:07:23.167,000 --> 0:07:25,000
I think a far better strategy is to say,

182
0:07:25.378,000 --> 0:07:26,000
I do certain things every day,

183
0:07:26.871,000 --> 0:07:28,000
there are certain occasions that happen every day,

184
0:07:29.249,000 --> 0:07:3,000
like eating dinner.

185
0:07:30.532,000 --> 0:07:31,000
Sometimes I'll be alone,

186
0:07:31.874,000 --> 0:07:32,000
sometimes with other people,

187
0:07:33.404,000 --> 0:07:34,000
sometimes in a restaurant,

188
0:07:34.707,000 --> 0:07:35,000
sometimes at home,

189
0:07:35.919,000 --> 0:07:38,000
but the rule that I've adopted is: I will never use my phone at the table.

190
0:07:39.943,000 --> 0:07:4,000
It's far away,

191
0:07:41.401,000 --> 0:07:42,000
as far away as possible.

192
0:07:42.886,000 --> 0:07:44,000
Because we're really bad at resisting temptation.

193
0:07:45.219,000 --> 0:07:48,000
But when you have a stopping cue that, every time dinner begins,

194
0:07:48.314,000 --> 0:07:49,000
my phone goes far away,

195
0:07:49.494,000 --> 0:07:5,000
you avoid temptation all together.

196
0:07:51.186,000 --> 0:07:52,000
At first, it hurts.

197
0:07:52.927,000 --> 0:07:53,000
I had massive FOMO.

198
0:07:54.573,000 --> 0:07:55,000
(Laughter)

199
0:07:55.663,000 --> 0:07:56,000
I struggled.

200
0:07:57.189,000 --> 0:07:58,000
But what happens is, you get used to it.

201
0:07:59.143,000 --> 0:08:02,000
You overcome the withdrawal the same way you would from a drug,

202
0:08:02.265,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and what happens is, life becomes more colorful, richer,

203
0:08:05.074,000 --> 0:08:06,000
more interesting --

204
0:08:06.253,000 --> 0:08:07,000
you have better conversations.

205
0:08:07.927,000 --> 0:08:1,000
You really connect with the people who are there with you.

206
0:08:10.975,000 --> 0:08:11,000
I think it's a fantastic strategy,

207
0:08:12.643,000 --> 0:08:14,000
and we know it works, because when people do this --

208
0:08:15.156,000 --> 0:08:17,000
and I've tracked a lot of people who have tried this --

209
0:08:17.77,000 --> 0:08:18,000
it expands.

210
0:08:18.964,000 --> 0:08:19,000
They feel so good about it,

211
0:08:20.304,000 --> 0:08:23,000
they start doing it for the first hour of the day in the morning.

212
0:08:23.42,000 --> 0:08:26,000
They start putting their phones on airplane mode on the weekend.

213
0:08:26.569,000 --> 0:08:29,000
That way, your phone remains a camera, but it's no longer a phone.

214
0:08:30.33,000 --> 0:08:31,000
It's a really powerful idea,

215
0:08:31.689,000 --> 0:08:34,000
and we know people feel much better about their lives when they do this.

216
0:08:35.793,000 --> 0:08:36,000
So what's the take home here?

217
0:08:37.406,000 --> 0:08:39,000
Screens are miraculous; I've already said that,

218
0:08:39.669,000 --> 0:08:4,000
and I feel that it's true.

219
0:08:41.045,000 --> 0:08:45,000
But the way we use them is a lot like driving down a really fast, long road,

220
0:08:45.689,000 --> 0:08:48,000
and you're in a car where the accelerator is mashed to the floor,

221
0:08:48.876,000 --> 0:08:5,000
it's kind of hard to reach the brake pedal.

222
0:08:50.948,000 --> 0:08:51,000
You've got a choice.

223
0:08:53.33,000 --> 0:08:57,000
You can either glide by, past, say, the beautiful ocean scenes

224
0:08:57.517,000 --> 0:09:,000
and take snaps out the window -- that's the easy thing to do --

225
0:09:00.637,000 --> 0:09:03,000
or you can go out of your way to move the car to the side of the road,

226
0:09:04.201,000 --> 0:09:05,000
to push that brake pedal,

227
0:09:05.697,000 --> 0:09:06,000
to get out,

228
0:09:06.874,000 --> 0:09:07,000
take off your shoes and socks,

229
0:09:08.779,000 --> 0:09:1,000
take a couple of steps onto the sand,

230
0:09:11.068,000 --> 0:09:13,000
feel what the sand feels like under your feet,

231
0:09:13.332,000 --> 0:09:14,000
walk to the ocean,

232
0:09:14.507,000 --> 0:09:16,000
and let the ocean lap at your ankles.

233
0:09:17.027,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Your life will be richer and more meaningful

234
0:09:19.866,000 --> 0:09:21,000
because you breathe in that experience,

235
0:09:22.108,000 --> 0:09:24,000
and because you've left your phone in the car.

236
0:09:24.528,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Thank you.

237
0:09:25.723,000 --> 0:09:27,000
(Applause)

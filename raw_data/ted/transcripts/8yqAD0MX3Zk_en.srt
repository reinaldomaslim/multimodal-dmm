1
0:00:19.893,000 --> 0:00:21,000
Hi. My name is Marwa, and I'm an architect.

2
0:00:23.167,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I was born and raised in Homs,

3
0:00:25.017,000 --> 0:00:27,000
a city in the central western part of Syria,

4
0:00:27.759,000 --> 0:00:28,000
and I've always lived here.

5
0:00:29.905,000 --> 0:00:3,000
After six years of war,

6
0:00:31.501,000 --> 0:00:32,000
Homs is now a half-destroyed city.

7
0:00:34.001,000 --> 0:00:37,000
My family and I were lucky; our place is still standing.

8
0:00:37.152,000 --> 0:00:4,000
Although for two years, we were like prisoners at home.

9
0:00:40.359,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Outside there were demonstrations and battles and bombings and snipers.

10
0:00:46.08,000 --> 0:00:49,000
My husband and I used to run an architecture studio

11
0:00:49.156,000 --> 0:00:5,000
in the old town main square.

12
0:00:51.333,000 --> 0:00:53,000
It's gone, as is most of the old town itself.

13
0:00:54.685,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Half of the city's other neighborhoods

14
0:00:56.59,000 --> 0:00:57,000
are now rubble.

15
0:00:58.414,000 --> 0:01:,000
Since the ceasefire in late 2015,

16
0:01:00.67,000 --> 0:01:02,000
large parts of Homs have been more or less quiet.

17
0:01:03.609,000 --> 0:01:06,000
The economy is completely broken, and people are still fighting.

18
0:01:07.326,000 --> 0:01:09,000
The merchants who had stalls in the old city market

19
0:01:09.827,000 --> 0:01:11,000
now trade out of sheds on the streets.

20
0:01:12.296,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Under our apartment, there is a carpenter,

21
0:01:14.816,000 --> 0:01:18,000
sweetshops, a butcher, a printing house, workshops, among many more.

22
0:01:20.251,000 --> 0:01:22,000
I have started teaching part-time,

23
0:01:22.399,000 --> 0:01:24,000
and with my husband, who juggles several jobs,

24
0:01:24.937,000 --> 0:01:25,000
we've opened a small bookshop.

25
0:01:26.938,000 --> 0:01:28,000
Other people do all sorts of jobs to get by.

26
0:01:30.803,000 --> 0:01:33,000
When I look at my destroyed city, of course, I ask myself:

27
0:01:34.081,000 --> 0:01:35,000
What has led to this senseless war?

28
0:01:36.778,000 --> 0:01:38,000
Syria was largely a place of tolerance,

29
0:01:39.033,000 --> 0:01:41,000
historically accustomed to variety,

30
0:01:41.097,000 --> 0:01:44,000
accommodating a wide range of beliefs, origins, customs,

31
0:01:44.402,000 --> 0:01:45,000
goods, food.

32
0:01:46.315,000 --> 0:01:47,000
How did my country --

33
0:01:47.504,000 --> 0:01:49,000
a country with communities living harmoniously together

34
0:01:50.226,000 --> 0:01:52,000
and comfortable in discussing their differences --

35
0:01:52.741,000 --> 0:01:56,000
how did it degenerate into civil war, violence, displacement

36
0:01:56.85,000 --> 0:01:58,000
and unprecedented sectarian hatred?

37
0:02:00.239,000 --> 0:02:02,000
There were many reasons that had led to the war --

38
0:02:03.071,000 --> 0:02:05,000
social, political and economic.

39
0:02:05.743,000 --> 0:02:06,000
They all have played their role.

40
0:02:07.331,000 --> 0:02:1,000
But I believe there is one key reason that has been overlooked

41
0:02:11.227,000 --> 0:02:12,000
and which is important to analyze,

42
0:02:13.161,000 --> 0:02:15,000
because from it will largely depend

43
0:02:15.511,000 --> 0:02:17,000
whether we can make sure that this doesn't happen again.

44
0:02:19.372,000 --> 0:02:2,000
And that reason is architecture.

45
0:02:21.818,000 --> 0:02:23,000
Architecture in my country has played an important role

46
0:02:24.423,000 --> 0:02:28,000
in creating, directing and amplifying conflict between warring factions,

47
0:02:28.467,000 --> 0:02:3,000
and this is probably true for other countries as well.

48
0:02:31.75,000 --> 0:02:34,000
There is a sure correspondence between the architecture of a place

49
0:02:35.306,000 --> 0:02:37,000
and the character of the community that has settled there.

50
0:02:38.711,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Architecture plays a key role in whether a community crumbles

51
0:02:42.45,000 --> 0:02:43,000
or comes together.

52
0:02:44.06,000 --> 0:02:46,000
Syrian society has long lived the coexistence

53
0:02:46.589,000 --> 0:02:48,000
of different traditions and backgrounds.

54
0:02:48.969,000 --> 0:02:5,000
Syrians have experienced the prosperity of open trade

55
0:02:51.723,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and sustainable communities.

56
0:02:53.499,000 --> 0:02:56,000
They have enjoyed the true meaning of belonging to a place,

57
0:02:56.594,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and that was reflected in their built environment,

58
0:02:59.321,000 --> 0:03:01,000
in the mosques and churches built back-to-back,

59
0:03:01.813,000 --> 0:03:03,000
in the interwoven souks and public venues,

60
0:03:04.084,000 --> 0:03:08,000
and the proportions and sizes based on principles of humanity and harmony.

61
0:03:08.948,000 --> 0:03:11,000
This architecture of mixity can still be read in the remains.

62
0:03:12.384,000 --> 0:03:15,000
The old Islamic city in Syria was built over a multilayered past,

63
0:03:16.147,000 --> 0:03:18,000
integrating with it and embracing its spirit.

64
0:03:18.602,000 --> 0:03:19,000
So did its communities.

65
0:03:20.253,000 --> 0:03:21,000
People lived and worked with each other

66
0:03:22.205,000 --> 0:03:24,000
in a place that gave them a sense of belonging

67
0:03:24.435,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and made them feel at home.

68
0:03:26.464,000 --> 0:03:28,000
They shared a remarkably unified existence.

69
0:03:29.748,000 --> 0:03:3,000
But over the last century,

70
0:03:31.237,000 --> 0:03:35,000
gradually this delicate balance of these places has been interfered with;

71
0:03:35.762,000 --> 0:03:37,000
first, by the urban planners of the colonial period,

72
0:03:38.466,000 --> 0:03:4,000
when the French went enthusiastically about,

73
0:03:40.704,000 --> 0:03:43,000
transforming what they saw as the un-modern Syrian cities.

74
0:03:43.986,000 --> 0:03:45,000
They blew up city streets and relocated monuments.

75
0:03:48.255,000 --> 0:03:49,000
They called them improvements,

76
0:03:50.255,000 --> 0:03:53,000
and they were the beginning of a long, slow unraveling.

77
0:03:53.655,000 --> 0:03:55,000
The traditional urbanism and architecture of our cities

78
0:03:56.569,000 --> 0:03:59,000
assured identity and belonging not by separation,

79
0:03:59.759,000 --> 0:04:,000
but by intertwining.

80
0:04:01.537,000 --> 0:04:04,000
But over time, the ancient became worthless, and the new, coveted.

81
0:04:05.641,000 --> 0:04:07,000
The harmony of the built environment and social environment

82
0:04:08.657,000 --> 0:04:1,000
got trampled over by elements of modernity --

83
0:04:11.344,000 --> 0:04:13,000
brutal, unfinished concrete blocks,

84
0:04:13.55,000 --> 0:04:15,000
neglect, aesthetic devastation,

85
0:04:16.273,000 --> 0:04:21,000
divisive urbanism that zoned communities by class, creed or affluence.

86
0:04:21.859,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And the same was happening to the community.

87
0:04:24.352,000 --> 0:04:26,000
As the shape of the built environment changed,

88
0:04:26.971,000 --> 0:04:29,000
so the lifestyles and sense of belonging of the communities

89
0:04:30.303,000 --> 0:04:31,000
also started changing.

90
0:04:32.038,000 --> 0:04:34,000
From a register of togetherness, of belonging,

91
0:04:34.679,000 --> 0:04:36,000
architecture became a way of differentiation,

92
0:04:37.274,000 --> 0:04:39,000
and communities started drifting apart

93
0:04:39.695,000 --> 0:04:41,000
from the very fabric that used to unite them,

94
0:04:42.69,000 --> 0:04:46,000
and from the soul of the place that used to represent their common existence.

95
0:04:47.441,000 --> 0:04:49,000
While many reasons had led to the Syrian war,

96
0:04:49.854,000 --> 0:04:51,000
we shouldn't underestimate the way in which,

97
0:04:51.997,000 --> 0:04:54,000
by contributing to the loss of identity and self-respect,

98
0:04:55.87,000 --> 0:04:58,000
urban zoning and misguided, inhumane architecture

99
0:04:59.271,000 --> 0:05:01,000
have nurtured sectarian divisions and hatred.

100
0:05:02.416,000 --> 0:05:05,000
Over time, the united city has morphed into a city center

101
0:05:05.829,000 --> 0:05:07,000
with ghettos along its circumference.

102
0:05:08.782,000 --> 0:05:12,000
And in turn, the coherent communities became distinct social groups,

103
0:05:12.871,000 --> 0:05:15,000
alienated from each other and alienated from the place.

104
0:05:17.133,000 --> 0:05:18,000
From my point of view,

105
0:05:18.515,000 --> 0:05:2,000
losing the sense of belonging to a place

106
0:05:20.656,000 --> 0:05:22,000
and a sense of sharing it with someone else

107
0:05:22.852,000 --> 0:05:24,000
has made it a lot easier to destroy.

108
0:05:25.196,000 --> 0:05:28,000
The clear example can be seen in the informal housing system,

109
0:05:28.904,000 --> 0:05:32,000
which used to host, before the war, over 40 percent of the population.

110
0:05:33.424,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Yes, prior to the war, almost half of the Syrian population

111
0:05:37.258,000 --> 0:05:38,000
lived in slums,

112
0:05:38.717,000 --> 0:05:41,000
peripheral areas without proper infrastructure,

113
0:05:41.843,000 --> 0:05:43,000
made of endless rows of bare block boxes

114
0:05:44.74,000 --> 0:05:45,000
containing people,

115
0:05:46.192,000 --> 0:05:48,000
people who mostly belonged to the same group,

116
0:05:48.351,000 --> 0:05:52,000
whether based on religion, class, origin or all of the above.

117
0:05:53.772,000 --> 0:05:57,000
This ghettoized urbanism proved to be a tangible precursor of war.

118
0:05:58.43,000 --> 0:06:01,000
Conflict is much easier between pre-categorized areas --

119
0:06:01.808,000 --> 0:06:02,000
where the "others" live.

120
0:06:03.75,000 --> 0:06:05,000
The ties that used to bind the city together --

121
0:06:06.307,000 --> 0:06:08,000
whether they were social, through coherent building,

122
0:06:08.991,000 --> 0:06:1,000
or economic, through trade in the souk,

123
0:06:11.148,000 --> 0:06:13,000
or religious, through the coexistent presence --

124
0:06:14.058,000 --> 0:06:17,000
were all lost in the misguided and visionless modernization

125
0:06:17.794,000 --> 0:06:18,000
of the built environment.

126
0:06:19.782,000 --> 0:06:2,000
Allow me an aside.

127
0:06:21.467,000 --> 0:06:25,000
When I read about heterogeneous urbanism in other parts of the world,

128
0:06:25.674,000 --> 0:06:27,000
involving ethnic neighborhoods in British cities

129
0:06:28.17,000 --> 0:06:3,000
or around Paris or Brussels,

130
0:06:30.303,000 --> 0:06:33,000
I recognize the beginning of the kind of instability

131
0:06:33.921,000 --> 0:06:35,000
we have witnessed so disastrously here in Syria.

132
0:06:38.027,000 --> 0:06:4,000
We have severely destroyed cities,

133
0:06:40.257,000 --> 0:06:43,000
such as Homs, Aleppo, Daraa and many others,

134
0:06:43.462,000 --> 0:06:46,000
and almost half of the population of the country is now displaced.

135
0:06:47.345,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Hopefully, the war will end,

136
0:06:49.517,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and the question that, as an architect, I have to ask, is:

137
0:06:53.341,000 --> 0:06:54,000
How do we rebuild?

138
0:06:55.317,000 --> 0:06:57,000
What are the principles that we should adopt

139
0:06:57.977,000 --> 0:06:59,000
in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes?

140
0:07:01.099,000 --> 0:07:04,000
From my point of view, the main focus should be on creating places

141
0:07:04.662,000 --> 0:07:06,000
that make their people feel they belong.

142
0:07:06.854,000 --> 0:07:08,000
Architecture and planning need to recapture

143
0:07:09.373,000 --> 0:07:11,000
some of the traditional values that did just that,

144
0:07:12.301,000 --> 0:07:15,000
creating the conditions for coexistence and peace,

145
0:07:15.556,000 --> 0:07:18,000
values of beauty that don't exhibit ostentation,

146
0:07:18.848,000 --> 0:07:2,000
but rather, approachability and ease,

147
0:07:21.237,000 --> 0:07:24,000
moral values that promote generosity and acceptance,

148
0:07:24.768,000 --> 0:07:27,000
architecture that is for everyone to enjoy, not just for the elite,

149
0:07:28.769,000 --> 0:07:31,000
just as used to be in the shadowed alleys of the old Islamic city,

150
0:07:32.445,000 --> 0:07:34,000
mixed designs that encourage a sense of community.

151
0:07:36.326,000 --> 0:07:39,000
There is a neighborhood here in Homs that's called Baba Amr

152
0:07:39.589,000 --> 0:07:4,000
that has been fully destroyed.

153
0:07:41.714,000 --> 0:07:43,000
Almost two years ago, I introduced this design

154
0:07:44.264,000 --> 0:07:46,000
into a UN-Habitat competition for rebuilding it.

155
0:07:47.285,000 --> 0:07:51,000
The idea was to create an urban fabric inspired by a tree,

156
0:07:51.647,000 --> 0:07:53,000
capable of growing and spreading organically,

157
0:07:54.592,000 --> 0:07:57,000
echoing the traditional bridge hanging over the old alleys,

158
0:07:57.838,000 --> 0:08:,000
and incorporating apartments, private courtyards, shops,

159
0:08:01.614,000 --> 0:08:04,000
workshops, places for parking and playing and leisure,

160
0:08:05.011,000 --> 0:08:06,000
trees and shaded areas.

161
0:08:07.625,000 --> 0:08:08,000
It's far from perfect, obviously.

162
0:08:09.635,000 --> 0:08:12,000
I drew it during the few hours of electricity we get.

163
0:08:12.93,000 --> 0:08:15,000
And there are many possible ways to express belonging and community

164
0:08:16.552,000 --> 0:08:17,000
through architecture.

165
0:08:17.727,000 --> 0:08:2,000
But compare it with the freestanding, disconnected blocks

166
0:08:20.795,000 --> 0:08:23,000
proposed by the official project for rebuilding Baba Amr.

167
0:08:24.774,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Architecture is not the axis around which all human life rotates,

168
0:08:28.406,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but it has the power to suggest and even direct human activity.

169
0:08:33.231,000 --> 0:08:37,000
In that sense, settlement, identity and social integration

170
0:08:37.407,000 --> 0:08:4,000
are all the producer and product of effective urbanism.

171
0:08:41.99,000 --> 0:08:43,000
The coherent urbanism of the old Islamic city

172
0:08:44.97,000 --> 0:08:46,000
and of many old European towns, for instance,

173
0:08:47.89,000 --> 0:08:48,000
promote integration,

174
0:08:49.647,000 --> 0:08:52,000
while rows of soulless housing or tower blocks,

175
0:08:52.908,000 --> 0:08:53,000
even when they are luxurious,

176
0:08:54.697,000 --> 0:08:56,000
tend to promote isolation and "otherness."

177
0:08:57.958,000 --> 0:08:58,000
Even simple things

178
0:08:59.232,000 --> 0:09:02,000
like shaded places or fruit plants or drinking water inside the city

179
0:09:03.112,000 --> 0:09:06,000
can make a difference in how people feel towards the place,

180
0:09:06.311,000 --> 0:09:09,000
and whether they consider it a generous place that gives,

181
0:09:09.524,000 --> 0:09:12,000
a place that's worth keeping, contributing to,

182
0:09:12.72,000 --> 0:09:14,000
or whether they see it as an alienating place,

183
0:09:15.101,000 --> 0:09:16,000
full of seeds of anger.

184
0:09:17.291,000 --> 0:09:21,000
In order for a place to give, its architecture should be giving, too.

185
0:09:22.1,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Our built environment matters.

186
0:09:24.128,000 --> 0:09:27,000
The fabric of our cities is reflected in the fabric of our souls.

187
0:09:28.802,000 --> 0:09:3,000
And whether in the shape of informal concrete slums

188
0:09:31.777,000 --> 0:09:32,000
or broken social housing

189
0:09:33.427,000 --> 0:09:34,000
or trampled old towns

190
0:09:35.21,000 --> 0:09:36,000
or forests of skyscrapers,

191
0:09:36.98,000 --> 0:09:38,000
the contemporary urban archetypes

192
0:09:39.107,000 --> 0:09:41,000
that have emerged all across the Middle East

193
0:09:41.839,000 --> 0:09:45,000
have been one cause of the alienation and fragmentation of our communities.

194
0:09:46.971,000 --> 0:09:47,000
We can learn from this.

195
0:09:48.488,000 --> 0:09:5,000
We can learn how to rebuild in another way,

196
0:09:51.365,000 --> 0:09:54,000
how to create an architecture that doesn't contribute only

197
0:09:54.706,000 --> 0:09:56,000
to the practical and economic aspects of people's lives,

198
0:09:57.687,000 --> 0:10:,000
but also to their social, spiritual and psychological needs.

199
0:10:02.043,000 --> 0:10:05,000
Those needs were totally overlooked in the Syrian cities before the war.

200
0:10:06.575,000 --> 0:10:08,000
We need to create again cities that are shared

201
0:10:09.342,000 --> 0:10:11,000
by the communities that inhabit them.

202
0:10:11.777,000 --> 0:10:13,000
If we do so, people will not feel the need

203
0:10:14.69,000 --> 0:10:17,000
to seek identities opposed to the other identities all around,

204
0:10:18.563,000 --> 0:10:21,000
because they will all feel at home.

205
0:10:22.246,000 --> 0:10:23,000
Thank you for listening.

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm Jessi, and this is my suitcase.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:21,000
But before I show you what I've got inside,

3
0:00:21.26,000 --> 0:00:24,000
I'm going to make a very public confession,

4
0:00:24.26,000 --> 0:00:26,000
and that is,

5
0:00:26.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
I'm outfit-obsessed.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:3,000
I love finding, wearing,

7
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:32,000
and more recently,

8
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
photographing and blogging

9
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
a different, colorful, crazy outfit

10
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
for every single occasion.

11
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
But I don't buy anything new.

12
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
I get all my clothes secondhand

13
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:46,000
from flea markets and thrift stores.

14
0:00:46.26,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Aww, thank you.

15
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Secondhand shopping

16
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
allows me to reduce the impact

17
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
my wardrobe has on the environment

18
0:00:55.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and on my wallet.

19
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
I get to meet all kinds of great people;

20
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
my dollars usually go to a good cause;

21
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
I look pretty unique;

22
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and it makes shopping like my own personal treasure hunt.

23
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:09,000
I mean, what am I going to find today?

24
0:01:09.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
Is it going to be my size?

25
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
Will I like the color?

26
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
Will it be under $20?

27
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
If all the answers are yes,

28
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
I feel as though I've won.

29
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
I want to get back to my suitcase

30
0:01:23.26,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and tell you what I packed

31
0:01:25.26,000 --> 0:01:27,000
for this exciting week here at TED.

32
0:01:27.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I mean, what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her?

33
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
So I'm going to show you exactly what I brought.

34
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
I brought seven pairs of underpants

35
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
and that's it.

36
0:01:40.26,000 --> 0:01:43,000
Exactly one week's worth of undies

37
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
is all I put in my suitcase.

38
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
I was betting that I'd be able to find

39
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
everything else I could possible want to wear

40
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
once I got here to Palm Springs.

41
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:55,000
And since you don't know me

42
0:01:55.26,000 --> 0:01:57,000
as the woman walking around TED in her underwear --

43
0:01:57.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
(Laughter)

44
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
that means I found a few things.

45
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:04,000
And I'd really love to show you my week's worth of outfits right now.

46
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Does that sound good?

47
0:02:06.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
(Applause)

48
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
So as I do this,

49
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
I'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons

50
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:15,000
that, believe it or not, I have picked up

51
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
in these adventures wearing nothing new.

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
So let's start with Sunday.

53
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I call this "Shiny Tiger."

54
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great.

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
You can almost always look phenomenal for under $50.

56
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
This whole outfit, including the jacket,

57
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
cost me $55,

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and it was the most expensive thing

59
0:02:35.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
that I wore the entire week.

60
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Monday: Color is powerful.

61
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:43,000
It is almost physiologically impossible

62
0:02:43.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
to be in a bad mood when you're wearing bright red pants.

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:48,000
(Laughter)

64
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
If you are happy,

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
you are going to attract other happy people to you.

66
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
Tuesday:

67
0:02:56.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Fitting in is way overrated.

68
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
I've spent a whole lot of my life

69
0:03:01.26,000 --> 0:03:03,000
trying to be myself

70
0:03:03.26,000 --> 0:03:05,000
and at the same time fit in.

71
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
Just be who you are.

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
If you are surrounding yourself with the right people,

73
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:12,000
they will not only get it,

74
0:03:12.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
they will appreciate it.

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
Wednesday:

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
Embrace your inner child.

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
Sometimes people tell me

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that I look like I'm playing dress-up,

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
or that I remind them of their seven-year-old.

80
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
I like to smile

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
and say, "Thank you."

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Thursday:

83
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Confidence is key.

84
0:03:34.26,000 --> 0:03:36,000
If you think you look good in something,

85
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
you almost certainly do.

86
0:03:38.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
And if you don't think you look good in something,

87
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
you're also probably right.

88
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
I grew up with a mom who taught me this day-in and day-out.

89
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
But it wasn't until I turned 30

90
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
that I really got what this meant.

91
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
And I'm going to break it down for you for just a second.

92
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
If you believe you're a beautiful person

93
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
inside and out,

94
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
there is no look that you can't pull off.

95
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
So there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience.

96
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
We should be able to rock anything we want to rock.

97
0:04:07.26,000 --> 0:04:09,000
Thank you.

98
0:04:09.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
(Applause)

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Friday: A universal truth -- five words for you:

100
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Gold sequins go with everything.

101
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
And finally, Saturday:

102
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
Developing your own unique personal style

103
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
is a really great way to tell the world something about you

104
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:3,000
without having to say a word.

105
0:04:30.26,000 --> 0:04:32,000
It's been proven to me time and time again

106
0:04:32.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
as people have walked up to me this week

107
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
simply because of what I'm wearing,

108
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
and we've had great conversations.

109
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So obviously this is not all going to fit

110
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
back in my tiny suitcase.

111
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:44,000
So before I go home to Brooklyn,

112
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I'm going to donate everything back.

113
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn myself this week

114
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
is that it's okay to let go.

115
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
I don't need to get emotionally attached to these things

116
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:56,000
because around the corner,

117
0:04:56.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
there is always going to be

118
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
another crazy, colorful,

119
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
shiny outfit

120
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
just waiting for me,

121
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:06,000
if I put a little love in my heart and look.

122
0:05:06.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
Thank you very much.

123
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
(Applause)

124
0:05:11.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
Thank you.

125
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
(Applause)

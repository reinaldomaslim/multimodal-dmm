1
0:00:12.64,000 --> 0:00:16,000
In 2013, I was an executive at an international engineering firm

2
0:00:16.96,000 --> 0:00:17,000
in San Francisco.

3
0:00:18.36,000 --> 0:00:19,000
It was my dream job.

4
0:00:19.96,000 --> 0:00:22,000
A culmination of all the skills that I've acquired over the years:

5
0:00:23.28,000 --> 0:00:26,000
storytelling, social impact, behavior change.

6
0:00:26.32,000 --> 0:00:27,000
I was the head of marketing and culture

7
0:00:28.239,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and I worked with the nation's largest health care systems,

8
0:00:31.24,000 --> 0:00:33,000
using technology and culture change

9
0:00:33.36,000 --> 0:00:35,000
to radically reduce their energy and water use

10
0:00:36.08,000 --> 0:00:38,000
and to improve their social impact.

11
0:00:38.28,000 --> 0:00:4,000
I was creating real change in the world.

12
0:00:41.72,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And it was the worst professional experience of my life.

13
0:00:48.12,000 --> 0:00:5,000
I hit the glass ceiling hard.

14
0:00:50.56,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It hurt like hell.

15
0:00:54.2,000 --> 0:00:55,000
While there were bigger issues,

16
0:00:55.72,000 --> 0:00:58,000
most of what happened were little behaviors and patterns

17
0:00:59.72,000 --> 0:01:03,000
that slowly chipped away at my ability to do my work well.

18
0:01:03.8,000 --> 0:01:08,000
They ate away at my confidence, my leadership, my capacity to innovate.

19
0:01:08.92,000 --> 0:01:1,000
For example, my first presentation at the company.

20
0:01:11.88,000 --> 0:01:12,000
I walk up to the front of the room

21
0:01:13.56,000 --> 0:01:16,000
to give a presentation on the strategy that I believe is right for the company.

22
0:01:17.36,000 --> 0:01:18,000
The one they hired me to create.

23
0:01:18.96,000 --> 0:01:2,000
And I look around the room at my fellow executives.

24
0:01:21.48,000 --> 0:01:23,000
And I watch as they pick up their cell phones

25
0:01:23.76,000 --> 0:01:25,000
and look down at their laptops.

26
0:01:26.04,000 --> 0:01:27,000
They're not paying attention.

27
0:01:28,000 --> 0:01:3,000
As soon as I start to speak, the interruptions begin

28
0:01:30.52,000 --> 0:01:33,000
and people talk over me again and again and again.

29
0:01:34.48,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Some of my ideas are flat out dismissed

30
0:01:38.04,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and then brought up by somebody else and championed.

31
0:01:43.64,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I was the only woman in that room.

32
0:01:46,000 --> 0:01:47,000
And I could have used an ally.

33
0:01:48.68,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Little behaviors and pattern like this, every day, again and again,

34
0:01:52.44,000 --> 0:01:54,000
they wear you down.

35
0:01:54.48,000 --> 0:01:56,000
Pretty soon, my energy was absolutely tapped.

36
0:01:58.36,000 --> 0:02:,000
At a real low point, I read an article

37
0:02:00.48,000 --> 0:02:03,000
about toxic workplace culture and microaggressions.

38
0:02:03.96,000 --> 0:02:06,000
Microaggressions -- everyday slights, insults,

39
0:02:07.04,000 --> 0:02:09,000
negative verbal and nonverbal communication,

40
0:02:09.4,000 --> 0:02:1,000
whether intentional or not,

41
0:02:11.12,000 --> 0:02:13,000
that impede your ability to do your work well.

42
0:02:14.4,000 --> 0:02:15,000
That sounded familiar.

43
0:02:16.28,000 --> 0:02:19,000
I started to realize that I wasn't failing.

44
0:02:2,000 --> 0:02:22,000
The culture around me was failing me.

45
0:02:23.92,000 --> 0:02:24,000
And I wasn't alone.

46
0:02:25.48,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Behaviors and patterns like this

47
0:02:27.12,000 --> 0:02:31,000
every day affect underrepresented people of all backgrounds in the workplace.

48
0:02:31.52,000 --> 0:02:34,000
And that has a real impact

49
0:02:34.76,000 --> 0:02:36,000
on our colleagues, on our companies

50
0:02:37.04,000 --> 0:02:39,000
and our collective capacity to innovate.

51
0:02:41.68,000 --> 0:02:44,000
So, in the tech industry, we want quick solutions.

52
0:02:44.76,000 --> 0:02:48,000
But there is no magic wand for correcting diversity and inclusion.

53
0:02:49,000 --> 0:02:51,000
Change happens one person at a time,

54
0:02:51.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
one act at a time, one word at a time.

55
0:02:55.24,000 --> 0:02:57,000
We make a mistake when we see diversity and inclusion

56
0:02:58.24,000 --> 0:03:02,000
as that side project over there the diversity people are working on,

57
0:03:02.6,000 --> 0:03:05,000
rather than this work inside all of us that we need to do together.

58
0:03:07.6,000 --> 0:03:08,000
And that work begins

59
0:03:09.28,000 --> 0:03:12,000
with unlearning what we know about success and opportunity.

60
0:03:13.4,000 --> 0:03:14,000
We've been told our whole lives

61
0:03:15.36,000 --> 0:03:17,000
that if we work hard, that hard work pays off,

62
0:03:17.64,000 --> 0:03:19,000
we'd get what we deserve, we'd live our dream.

63
0:03:21.08,000 --> 0:03:23,000
But that isn't true for everyone.

64
0:03:23.28,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Some people have to work 10 times as hard

65
0:03:25.28,000 --> 0:03:26,000
to get to the same place

66
0:03:27,000 --> 0:03:3,000
due to many barriers put in front of them by society.

67
0:03:30.56,000 --> 0:03:32,000
Your gender, your race, your ethnicity,

68
0:03:32.8,000 --> 0:03:35,000
your religion, your disability, your sexual orientation,

69
0:03:36,000 --> 0:03:38,000
your class, your geography,

70
0:03:38.24,000 --> 0:03:42,000
all of these can give you more of fewer opportunities for success.

71
0:03:42.32,000 --> 0:03:44,000
And that's where allyship comes in.

72
0:03:44.68,000 --> 0:03:47,000
Allyship is about understanding that imbalance in opportunity

73
0:03:48.32,000 --> 0:03:49,000
and working to correct it.

74
0:03:50.44,000 --> 0:03:53,000
Allyship is really seeing the person next to us.

75
0:03:53.96,000 --> 0:03:56,000
And the person missing, who should be standing next to us.

76
0:03:57.48,000 --> 0:03:59,000
And first, just knowing what they're going through.

77
0:04:00.2,000 --> 0:04:03,000
And then, helping them succeed and thrive with us.

78
0:04:05.4,000 --> 0:04:08,000
When we work together to develop more diverse and inclusive teams,

79
0:04:08.84,000 --> 0:04:11,000
data shows we will be more innovative, more productive and more profitable.

80
0:04:13.68,000 --> 0:04:14,000
So, who is an ally?

81
0:04:15,000 --> 0:04:16,000
All of us.

82
0:04:16.24,000 --> 0:04:17,000
We can all be allies for each other.

83
0:04:17.96,000 --> 0:04:19,000
As a white, cisgendered woman in the United States,

84
0:04:20.48,000 --> 0:04:22,000
there are many ways I'm very privileged.

85
0:04:22.52,000 --> 0:04:24,000
And some ways I'm not.

86
0:04:24.64,000 --> 0:04:25,000
And I work hard every day

87
0:04:25.92,000 --> 0:04:27,000
to be an ally for people with less privilege than me.

88
0:04:28.68,000 --> 0:04:29,000
And I still need allies, too.

89
0:04:32.24,000 --> 0:04:35,000
In the tech industry, like in many industries,

90
0:04:35.48,000 --> 0:04:37,000
there are many people who are underrepresented,

91
0:04:37.68,000 --> 0:04:38,000
or face barriers and discrimination.

92
0:04:40.32,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Women, people who are nonbinary --

93
0:04:42.4,000 --> 0:04:45,000
so people who don't necessarily identify as man or woman --

94
0:04:45.52,000 --> 0:04:46,000
racial and ethnic minorities,

95
0:04:47.2,000 --> 0:04:5,000
LGBTQIA, people with disabilities, veterans,

96
0:04:50.56,000 --> 0:04:52,000
anybody over age 35.

97
0:04:52.76,000 --> 0:04:55,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:57.04,000 --> 0:05:,000
We have a major bias toward youth in the tech industry.

99
0:05:00.52,000 --> 0:05:01,000
And many others.

100
0:05:01.76,000 --> 0:05:04,000
There is always someone with less privilege than you.

101
0:05:05,000 --> 0:05:06,000
On this stage, in this room.

102
0:05:07.44,000 --> 0:05:09,000
At your company, on your team, in your city or town.

103
0:05:12.44,000 --> 0:05:14,000
So, people are allies for different reasons.

104
0:05:14.96,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Find your reason.

105
0:05:16.44,000 --> 0:05:17,000
It could be for the business case,

106
0:05:18.12,000 --> 0:05:2,000
because data shows diverse and inclusive teams

107
0:05:20.8,000 --> 0:05:23,000
will be more productive, more profitable and more innovative.

108
0:05:24.36,000 --> 0:05:27,000
It could be for fairness and social justice.

109
0:05:27.72,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Because we have a long history of oppression and inequity

110
0:05:31.72,000 --> 0:05:34,000
that we need to work on together.

111
0:05:35.64,000 --> 0:05:36,000
Or it could be for your kids,

112
0:05:37.08,000 --> 0:05:4,000
so your kids grow up with equal opportunities.

113
0:05:40.68,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And they grow up creating equal opportunities for others.

114
0:05:44.52,000 --> 0:05:45,000
Find your reason.

115
0:05:46.04,000 --> 0:05:47,000
For me, it's all three.

116
0:05:47.28,000 --> 0:05:51,000
Find your reason and step up to be there for someone who needs you.

117
0:05:52.4,000 --> 0:05:53,000
So, what can you do as an ally?

118
0:05:54.4,000 --> 0:05:56,000
Start by doing no harm.

119
0:05:56.76,000 --> 0:06:01,000
It's our job as allies to know what microaggressions are and to not do them.

120
0:06:01.84,000 --> 0:06:04,000
It's our job as allies to listen, to learn,

121
0:06:05.24,000 --> 0:06:07,000
to unlearn and to relearn,

122
0:06:07.92,000 --> 0:06:1,000
and to make mistakes and to keep learning.

123
0:06:12.24,000 --> 0:06:13,000
Give me your full attention.

124
0:06:15.84,000 --> 0:06:16,000
Close your laptops,

125
0:06:17.16,000 --> 0:06:19,000
put down your cellphones and pay attention.

126
0:06:20.52,000 --> 0:06:22,000
If somebody is new or the only person in the room like them,

127
0:06:23.48,000 --> 0:06:24,000
or they're just nervous,

128
0:06:24.76,000 --> 0:06:27,000
this is going to make a huge difference in how they show up.

129
0:06:28.16,000 --> 0:06:29,000
Don't interrupt.

130
0:06:29.4,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Underrepresented people are more likely to be interrupted,

131
0:06:32.16,000 --> 0:06:34,000
so just take a step back and listen.

132
0:06:35,000 --> 0:06:37,000
Echo and attribute.

133
0:06:37.04,000 --> 0:06:38,000
If I have a great idea,

134
0:06:38.8,000 --> 0:06:41,000
echo my idea and then attribute it to me, and we thrive together.

135
0:06:44.04,000 --> 0:06:47,000
Learn the language I use to describe my identity.

136
0:06:47.32,000 --> 0:06:49,000
Know how to pronounce my name.

137
0:06:49.36,000 --> 0:06:52,000
Know my pronouns -- he, she, they.

138
0:06:52.68,000 --> 0:06:56,000
Know the language I use to describe my disability, my ethnicity, my religion.

139
0:06:58.52,000 --> 0:07:02,000
This really matters to people, so if you don't know, just ask.

140
0:07:04.36,000 --> 0:07:05,000
Listen and learn.

141
0:07:07.2,000 --> 0:07:12,000
An executive told me recently that after doing allyship on his team,

142
0:07:12.4,000 --> 0:07:16,000
the whole team started to normalize calling themselves out and each other out

143
0:07:16.6,000 --> 0:07:17,000
for interrupting.

144
0:07:18.72,000 --> 0:07:21,000
"I'm so sorry I'm interrupting you right now, carry on."

145
0:07:22.72,000 --> 0:07:25,000
"Hey, she's got a great idea, let's listen."

146
0:07:27.32,000 --> 0:07:3,000
Number two, advocate for underrepresented people in small ways.

147
0:07:31.08,000 --> 0:07:34,000
Intervene; you can change the power dynamics in the room.

148
0:07:34.2,000 --> 0:07:37,000
If you see somebody is the only person in the room like them

149
0:07:37.76,000 --> 0:07:39,000
and they are being belittled, they are being interrupted,

150
0:07:40.44,000 --> 0:07:42,000
do something, say something.

151
0:07:43.68,000 --> 0:07:45,000
Invite underrepresented people to speak.

152
0:07:45.96,000 --> 0:07:49,000
And say no to panels without underrepresented speakers.

153
0:07:51.8,000 --> 0:07:52,000
Refer someone for a job

154
0:07:53.28,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and encourage them to take that job and to take new opportunities.

155
0:07:57.36,000 --> 0:08:,000
And this one's really important -- help normalize allyship.

156
0:08:00.84,000 --> 0:08:01,000
If you're a person with privilege,

157
0:08:02.72,000 --> 0:08:04,000
it's easier for you to advocate for allies.

158
0:08:05.44,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So use that privilege to create change.

159
0:08:09.16,000 --> 0:08:11,000
Three, change someone's life significantly.

160
0:08:12.12,000 --> 0:08:15,000
So, be there for somebody throughout their career.

161
0:08:15.2,000 --> 0:08:18,000
Mentor or sponsor them, give them opportunities as they grow.

0:08:19.72,000 --> 0:08:23,000
Volunteer -- volunteer for a STEM program, serving underserved youth.

163
0:08:23.96,000 --> 0:08:25,000
Transform your team to be more diverse and inclusive.

164
0:08:26.48,000 --> 0:08:29,000
And make real commitments to creating change here.

165
0:08:29.6,000 --> 0:08:32,000
Hold yourself and your team accountable for creating change.

166
0:08:34.16,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And lastly,

167
0:08:35.64,000 --> 0:08:38,000
help advocate for change across your company.

168
0:08:38.68,000 --> 0:08:4,000
When companies teach their people to be allies,

169
0:08:41.08,000 --> 0:08:43,000
diversity and inclusion programs are stronger.

170
0:08:44,000 --> 0:08:46,000
You and I can be allies for each other,

171
0:08:46.159,000 --> 0:08:48,000
whether we're inside or outside of work.

172
0:08:52.32,000 --> 0:08:54,000
So, I realized recently

173
0:08:56.48,000 --> 0:08:59,000
that I still have lingering shame and fear

174
0:08:59.84,000 --> 0:09:02,000
from that moment in my career when I felt utterly alone,

175
0:09:03.2,000 --> 0:09:04,000
shut out and unsupported.

176
0:09:06.32,000 --> 0:09:09,000
There are millions of people out there, like me, right now, feeling that way.

177
0:09:10.04,000 --> 0:09:13,000
And it doesn't take much for us to be there for each other.

178
0:09:13.32,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And when we're there for each other, when we support one another,

179
0:09:16.4,000 --> 0:09:17,000
we thrive together.

180
0:09:17.96,000 --> 0:09:19,000
And when we thrive, we build better teams,

181
0:09:20.96,000 --> 0:09:22,000
better products and better companies.

182
0:09:24.68,000 --> 0:09:26,000
Allyship is powerful.

183
0:09:27.6,000 --> 0:09:28,000
Try it.

184
0:09:29.76,000 --> 0:09:3,000
Thank you.

185
0:09:31.2,000 --> 0:09:34,000

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'd like to start with a couple of quick examples.

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
These are spinneret glands

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
on the abdomen of a spider.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
They produce six different types of silk, which is spun together into a fiber,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:28,000
tougher than any fiber humans have ever made.

6
0:00:28.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
The nearest we've come is with aramid fiber.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:33,000
And to make that, it involves extremes of temperature,

8
0:00:33.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
extremes of pressure and loads of pollution.

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
And yet the spider manages to do it at ambient temperature and pressure

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:42,000
with raw materials of dead flies and water.

11
0:00:42.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
It does suggest we've still got a bit to learn.

12
0:00:44.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
This beetle can detect a forest fire at 80 kilometers away.

13
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:49,000
That's roughly 10,000 times the range

14
0:00:49.26,000 --> 0:00:51,000
of man-made fire detectors.

15
0:00:51.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
And what's more, this guy doesn't need a wire

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:57,000
connected all the way back to a power station burning fossil fuels.

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:01:,000
So these two examples give a sense of what biomimicry can deliver.

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:03,000
If we could learn to make things and do things the way nature does,

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:05,000
we could achieve factor 10, factor 100,

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
maybe even factor 1,000 savings

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:1,000
in resource and energy use.

22
0:01:10.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And if we're to make progress with the sustainability revolution,

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:15,000
I believe there are three really big changes

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:17,000
we need to bring about.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Firstly, radical increases in resource efficiency.

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:22,000
Secondly, shifting from a linear, wasteful,

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
polluting way of using resources

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
to a closed-loop model.

29
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
And thirdly, changing from a fossil fuel economy

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
to a solar economy.

31
0:01:30.26,000 --> 0:01:32,000
And for all three of these, I believe,

32
0:01:32.26,000 --> 0:01:34,000
biomimicry has a lot of the solutions that we're going to need.

33
0:01:34.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
You could look at nature as being like a catalog of products,

34
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
and all of those have benefited

35
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
from a 3.8-billion-year research and development period.

36
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
And given that level of investment, it makes sense to use it.

37
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:48,000
So I'm going to talk about some projects that have explored these ideas.

38
0:01:48.26,000 --> 0:01:5,000
And let's start with radical increases

39
0:01:50.26,000 --> 0:01:52,000
in resource efficiency.

40
0:01:52.26,000 --> 0:01:54,000
When we were working on the Eden Project,

41
0:01:54.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
we had to create a very large greenhouse

42
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:58,000
in a site that was not only irregular,

43
0:01:58.26,000 --> 0:02:01,000
but it was continually changing because it was still being quarried.

44
0:02:01.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
It was a hell of a challenge,

45
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and it was actually examples from biology

46
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:07,000
that provided a lot of the clues.

47
0:02:07.26,000 --> 0:02:09,000
So for instance,

48
0:02:09.26,000 --> 0:02:11,000
it was soap bubbles that helped us generate a building form

49
0:02:11.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
that would work regardless of the final ground levels.

50
0:02:14.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
Studying pollen grains

51
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and radiolaria and carbon molecules

52
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
helped us devise the most efficient structural solution

53
0:02:21.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
using hexagons and pentagons.

54
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:26,000
The next move was that we wanted

55
0:02:26.26,000 --> 0:02:28,000
to try and maximize the size of those hexagons.

56
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
And to do that we had to find an alternative to glass,

57
0:02:30.26,000 --> 0:02:33,000
which is really very limited in terms of its unit sizes.

58
0:02:33.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
And in nature there are lots of examples

59
0:02:36.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
of very efficient structures based on pressurized membranes.

60
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:42,000
So we started exploring this material called ETFE.

61
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
It's a high-strength polymer.

62
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And what you do is you put it together in three layers,

63
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
you weld it around the edge, and then you inflate it.

64
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:51,000
And the great thing about this stuff

65
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
is you can make it in units

66
0:02:53.26,000 --> 0:02:55,000
of roughly seven times the size of glass,

67
0:02:55.26,000 --> 0:02:57,000
and it was only one percent of the weight of double-glazing.

68
0:02:57.26,000 --> 0:02:59,000
So that was a factor-100 saving.

69
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
And what we found is that we got into a positive cycle

70
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
in which one breakthrough facilitated another.

71
0:03:04.26,000 --> 0:03:07,000
So with such large, lightweight pillows,

72
0:03:07.26,000 --> 0:03:09,000
we had much less steel.

73
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
With less steel we were getting more sunlight in,

74
0:03:11.26,000 --> 0:03:14,000
which meant we didn't have to put as much extra heat in winter.

75
0:03:14.26,000 --> 0:03:16,000
And with less overall weight in the superstructure,

76
0:03:16.26,000 --> 0:03:18,000
there were big savings in the foundations.

77
0:03:18.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
And at the end of the project we worked out

78
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:22,000
that the weight of that superstructure

79
0:03:22.26,000 --> 0:03:25,000
was actually less than the weight of the air inside the building.

80
0:03:25.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
So I think the Eden Project is a fairly good example

81
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
of how ideas from biology

82
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:33,000
can lead to radical increases in resource efficiency --

83
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
delivering the same function,

84
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
but with a fraction of the resource input.

85
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:39,000
And actually there are loads of examples in nature

86
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
that you could turn to for similar solutions.

87
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So for instance, you could develop super-efficient roof structures

88
0:03:45.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
based on giant Amazon water lilies,

89
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
whole buildings inspired by abalone shells,

90
0:03:50.26,000 --> 0:03:53,000
super-lightweight bridges inspired by plant cells.

91
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
There's a world of beauty and efficiency to explore here

92
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:59,000
using nature as a design tool.

93
0:03:59.26,000 --> 0:04:02,000
So now I want to go onto talking about the linear-to-closed-loop idea.

94
0:04:02.26,000 --> 0:04:04,000
The way we tend to use resources

95
0:04:04.26,000 --> 0:04:06,000
is we extract them,

96
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:08,000
we turn them into short-life products and then dispose of them.

97
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Nature works very differently.

98
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
In ecosystems, the waste from one organism

99
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
becomes the nutrient for something else in that system.

100
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
And there are some examples of projects

101
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:19,000
that have deliberately tried to mimic ecosystems.

102
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:21,000
And one of my favorites

103
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
is called the Cardboard to Caviar Project

104
0:04:23.26,000 --> 0:04:25,000
by Graham Wiles.

105
0:04:25.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
And in their area they had a lot of shops and restaurants

106
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
that were producing lots of food, cardboard and plastic waste.

107
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:33,000
It was ending up in landfills.

108
0:04:33.26,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Now the really clever bit is what they did with the cardboard waste.

109
0:04:35.26,000 --> 0:04:38,000
And I'm just going to talk through this animation.

110
0:04:38.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
So they were paid to collect it from the restaurants.

111
0:04:40.26,000 --> 0:04:42,000
They then shredded the cardboard

112
0:04:42.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
and sold it to equestrian centers as horse bedding.

113
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
When that was soiled, they were paid again to collect it.

114
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
They put it into worm recomposting systems,

115
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:52,000
which produced a lot of worms, which they fed to Siberian sturgeon,

116
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:55,000
which produced caviar, which they sold back to the restaurants.

117
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:57,000
So it transformed a linear process

118
0:04:57.26,000 --> 0:04:59,000
into a closed-loop model,

119
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:02,000
and it created more value in the process.

120
0:05:02.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
Graham Wiles has continued to add more and more elements to this,

121
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:07,000
turning waste streams into schemes that create value.

122
0:05:07.26,000 --> 0:05:09,000
And just as natural systems

123
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:12,000
tend to increase in diversity and resilience over time,

124
0:05:12.26,000 --> 0:05:14,000
there's a real sense with this project

125
0:05:14.26,000 --> 0:05:17,000
that the number of possibilities

126
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
just continue increasing.

127
0:05:19.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
And I know it's a quirky example,

128
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:23,000
but I think the implications of this are quite radical,

129
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
because it suggests that we could actually

130
0:05:25.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
transform a big problem -- waste -- into a massive opportunity.

131
0:05:28.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
And particularly in cities --

132
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
we could look at the whole metabolism of cities,

133
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
and look at those as opportunities.

134
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:36,000
And that's what we're doing on the next project I'm going to talk about,

135
0:05:36.26,000 --> 0:05:38,000
the Mobius Project,

136
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
where we're trying to bring together a number of activities,

137
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
all within one building,

138
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:45,000
so that the waste from one can be the nutrient for another.

139
0:05:45.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
And the kind of elements I'm talking about

140
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
are, firstly, we have a restaurant inside a productive greenhouse,

141
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
a bit like this one in Amsterdam called De Kas.

142
0:05:52.26,000 --> 0:05:54,000
Then we would have an anaerobic digester,

143
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
which could deal with all the biodegradable waste from the local area,

144
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:05:59,000
turn that into heat for the greenhouse

145
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:01,000
and electricity to feed back into the grid.

146
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
We'd have a water treatment system

147
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
treating wastewater, turning that into fresh water

148
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
and generating energy from the solids

149
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
using just plants and micro-organisms.

150
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
We'd have a fish farm fed with vegetable waste from the kitchen

151
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:14,000
and worms from the compost

152
0:06:14.26,000 --> 0:06:16,000
and supplying fish back to the restaurant.

153
0:06:16.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
And we'd also have a coffee shop, and the waste grains from that

154
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:21,000
could be used as a substrate for growing mushrooms.

155
0:06:21.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
So you can see that we're bringing together

156
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
cycles of food, energy and water and waste

157
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
all within one building.

158
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
And just for fun, we've proposed this for a roundabout in central London,

159
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:32,000
which at the moment is a complete eyesore.

160
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
Some of you may recognize this.

161
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
And with just a little bit of planning,

162
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:39,000
we could transform a space dominated by traffic

163
0:06:39.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
into one that provides open space for people,

164
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:44,000
reconnects people with food

165
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and transforms waste into closed loop opportunities.

166
0:06:47.26,000 --> 0:06:49,000
So the final project I want to talk about

167
0:06:49.26,000 --> 0:06:52,000
is the Sahara Forest Project, which we're working on at the moment.

168
0:06:52.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
It may come as a surprise to some of you

169
0:06:54.26,000 --> 0:06:56,000
to hear that quite large areas of what are currently desert

170
0:06:56.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
were actually forested a fairly short time ago.

171
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
So for instance, when Julius Caesar arrived in North Africa,

172
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
huge areas of North Africa

173
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
were covered in cedar and cypress forests.

174
0:07:07.26,000 --> 0:07:09,000
And during the evolution of life on the Earth,

175
0:07:09.26,000 --> 0:07:11,000
it was the colonization

176
0:07:11.26,000 --> 0:07:13,000
of the land by plants

177
0:07:13.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
that helped create the benign climate we currently enjoy.

178
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:17,000
The converse is also true.

179
0:07:17.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
The more vegetation we lose,

180
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:21,000
the more that's likely to exacerbate climate change

181
0:07:21.26,000 --> 0:07:24,000
and lead to further desertification.

182
0:07:24.26,000 --> 0:07:26,000
And this animation,

183
0:07:26.26,000 --> 0:07:29,000
this shows photosynthetic activity over the course of a number of years,

184
0:07:29.26,000 --> 0:07:32,000
and what you can see is that the boundaries of those deserts

185
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
shift quite a lot,

186
0:07:34.26,000 --> 0:07:36,000
and that raises the question

187
0:07:36.26,000 --> 0:07:39,000
of whether we can intervene at the boundary conditions

188
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
to halt, or maybe even reverse, desertification.

189
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
And if you look at some of the organisms

190
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
that have evolved to live in deserts,

191
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:49,000
there are some amazing examples of adaptations to water scarcity.

192
0:07:49.26,000 --> 0:07:51,000
This is the Namibian fog-basking beetle,

193
0:07:51.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
and it's evolved a way of harvesting its own fresh water in a desert.

194
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:56,000
The way it does this is it comes out at night,

195
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:58,000
crawls to the top of a sand dune,

196
0:07:58.26,000 --> 0:08:,000
and because it's got a matte black shell,

197
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
is able to radiate heat out to the night sky

198
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:04,000
and become slightly cooler than its surroundings.

199
0:08:04.26,000 --> 0:08:06,000
So when the moist breeze blows in off the sea,

200
0:08:06.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
you get these droplets of water forming on the beetle's shell.

201
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Just before sunrise, he tips his shell up, the water runs down into his mouth,

202
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:14,000
has a good drink, goes off and hides for the rest of the day.

203
0:08:14.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
And the ingenuity, if you could call it that,

204
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
goes even further.

205
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
Because if you look closely at the beetle's shell,

206
0:08:20.26,000 --> 0:08:22,000
there are lots of little bumps on that shell.

207
0:08:22.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
And those bumps are hydrophilic; they attract water.

208
0:08:25.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
Between them there's a waxy finish which repels water.

209
0:08:28.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
And the effect of this is that

210
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
as the droplets start to form on the bumps,

211
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:34,000
they stay in tight, spherical beads,

212
0:08:34.26,000 --> 0:08:36,000
which means they're much more mobile

213
0:08:36.26,000 --> 0:08:39,000
than they would be if it was just a film of water over the whole beetle's shell.

214
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:42,000
So even when there's only a small amount of moisture in the air,

215
0:08:42.26,000 --> 0:08:45,000
it's able to harvest that very effectively and channel it down to its mouth.

216
0:08:45.26,000 --> 0:08:47,000
So amazing example of an adaptation

217
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
to a very resource-constrained environment --

218
0:08:49.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
and in that sense, very relevant

219
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:53,000
to the kind of challenges we're going to be facing

220
0:08:53.26,000 --> 0:08:55,000
over the next few years, next few decades.

221
0:08:55.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
We're working with the guy who invented the Seawater Greenhouse.

222
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:,000
This is a greenhouse designed for arid coastal regions,

223
0:09:00.26,000 --> 0:09:04,000
and the way it works is that you have this whole wall of evaporator grills,

224
0:09:04.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
and you trickle seawater over that

225
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
so that wind blows through, it picks up a lot of moisture

226
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
and is cooled in the process.

227
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
So inside it's cool and humid,

228
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
which means the plants need less water to grow.

229
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And then at the back of the greenhouse,

230
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:19,000
it condenses a lot of that humidity as freshwater

231
0:09:19.26,000 --> 0:09:22,000
in a process that is effectively identical to the beetle.

232
0:09:22.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
And what they found with the first Seawater Greenhouse that was built

233
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
was it was producing slightly more freshwater

234
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:3,000
than it needed for the plants inside.

235
0:09:30.26,000 --> 0:09:33,000
So they just started spreading this on the land around,

236
0:09:33.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
and the combination of that and the elevated humidity

237
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
had quite a dramatic effect on the local area.

238
0:09:38.26,000 --> 0:09:4,000
This photograph was taken on completion day,

239
0:09:40.26,000 --> 0:09:42,000
and just one year later, it looked like that.

240
0:09:42.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
So it was like a green inkblot spreading out from the building

241
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:48,000
turning barren land back into biologically productive land --

242
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and in that sense, going beyond sustainable design

243
0:09:50.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
to achieve restorative design.

244
0:09:52.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
So we were keen to scale this up

245
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:57,000
and apply biomimicry ideas to maximize the benefits.

246
0:09:57.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
And when you think about nature,

247
0:09:59.26,000 --> 0:10:01,000
often you think about it as being all about competition.

248
0:10:01.26,000 --> 0:10:03,000
But actually in mature ecosystems,

249
0:10:03.26,000 --> 0:10:05,000
you're just as likely to find examples

250
0:10:05.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
of symbiotic relationships.

251
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
So an important biomimicry principle

252
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:11,000
is to find ways of bringing technologies together

253
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
in symbiotic clusters.

254
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:15,000
And the technology that we settled on

255
0:10:15.26,000 --> 0:10:17,000
as an ideal partner for the Seawater Greenhouse

256
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
is concentrated solar power,

257
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
which uses solar-tracking mirrors to focus the sun's heat

258
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
to create electricity.

259
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
And just to give you some sense of the potential of CSP,

260
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
consider that we receive

261
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:31,000
10,000 times as much energy from the sun every year

262
0:10:31.26,000 --> 0:10:33,000
as we use in energy from all forms --

263
0:10:33.26,000 --> 0:10:35,000
10,000 times.

264
0:10:35.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
So our energy problems are not intractable.

265
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:39,000
It's a challenge to our ingenuity.

266
0:10:39.26,000 --> 0:10:41,000
And the kind of synergies I'm talking about

267
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
are, firstly, both these technologies work very well in hot, sunny deserts.

268
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:48,000
CSP needs a supply of demineralized freshwater.

269
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
That's exactly what the Seawater Greenhouse produces.

270
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
CSP produces a lot of waste heat.

271
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
We'll be able to make use of all that to evaporate more seawater

272
0:10:55.26,000 --> 0:10:57,000
and enhance the restorative benefits.

273
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
And finally, in the shade under the mirrors,

274
0:10:59.26,000 --> 0:11:01,000
it's possible to grow all sorts of crops

275
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
that would not grow in direct sunlight.

276
0:11:03.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
So this is how this scheme would look.

277
0:11:05.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The idea is we create this long hedge of greenhouses facing the wind.

278
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
We'd have concentrated solar power plants

279
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:12,000
at intervals along the way.

280
0:11:12.26,000 --> 0:11:15,000
Some of you might be wondering what we would do with all the salts.

281
0:11:15.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
And with biomimicry, if you've got an underutilized resource,

282
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:2,000
you don't think, "How am I going to dispose of this?"

283
0:11:20.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
You think, "What can I add to the system to create more value?"

284
0:11:23.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
And it turns out

285
0:11:25.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
that different things crystallize out at different stages.

286
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
When you evaporate seawater, the first thing to crystallize out

287
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
is calcium carbonate.

288
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:33,000
And that builds up on the evaporators --

289
0:11:33.26,000 --> 0:11:35,000
and that's what that image on the left is --

290
0:11:35.26,000 --> 0:11:37,000
gradually getting encrusted with the calcium carbonate.

291
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
So after a while, we could take that out,

292
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
use it as a lightweight building block.

293
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:43,000
And if you think about the carbon in that,

294
0:11:43.26,000 --> 0:11:45,000
that would have come out of the atmosphere, into the sea

295
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
and then locked away in a building product.

296
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:49,000
The next thing is sodium chloride.

297
0:11:49.26,000 --> 0:11:51,000
You can also compress that into a building block,

298
0:11:51.26,000 --> 0:11:53,000
as they did here.

299
0:11:53.26,000 --> 0:11:55,000
This is a hotel in Bolivia.

300
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
And then after that, there are all sorts

301
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
of compounds and elements that we can extract,

302
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
like phosphates, that we need to get back into the desert soils to fertilize them.

303
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
And there's just about every element of the periodic table

304
0:12:04.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
in seawater.

305
0:12:06.26,000 --> 0:12:08,000
So it should be possible to extract valuable elements

306
0:12:08.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
like lithium for high-performance batteries.

307
0:12:12.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
And in parts of the Arabian Gulf,

308
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:18,000
the seawater, the salinity is increasing steadily

309
0:12:18.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
due to the discharge of waste brine

310
0:12:20.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
from desalination plants.

311
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
And it's pushing the ecosystem close to collapse.

312
0:12:25.26,000 --> 0:12:27,000
Now we would be able to make use of all that waste brine.

313
0:12:27.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
We could evaporate it

314
0:12:29.26,000 --> 0:12:31,000
to enhance the restorative benefits

315
0:12:31.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
and capture the salts,

316
0:12:33.26,000 --> 0:12:36,000
transforming an urgent waste problem into a big opportunity.

317
0:12:36.26,000 --> 0:12:38,000
Really the Sahara Forest Project is a model

318
0:12:38.26,000 --> 0:12:41,000
for how we could create zero-carbon food,

319
0:12:41.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
abundant renewable energy in some of the most water-stressed parts of the planet

320
0:12:44.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
as well as reversing desertification in certain areas.

321
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:51,000
So returning to those big challenges that I mentioned at the beginning:

322
0:12:51.26,000 --> 0:12:53,000
radical increases in resource efficiency,

323
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
closing loops and a solar economy.

324
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
They're not just possible; they're critical.

325
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
And I firmly believe that studying the way nature solves problems

326
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:04,000
will provide a lot of the solutions.

327
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
But perhaps more than anything, what this thinking provides

328
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
is a really positive way of talking about sustainable design.

329
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Far too much of the talk about the environment

330
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:13,000
uses very negative language.

331
0:13:13.26,000 --> 0:13:16,000
But here it's about synergies and abundance and optimizing.

332
0:13:16.26,000 --> 0:13:18,000
And this is an important point.

333
0:13:18.26,000 --> 0:13:2,000
Antoine de Saint-Exupery once said,

334
0:13:20.26,000 --> 0:13:22,000
"If you want to build a flotilla of ships,

335
0:13:22.26,000 --> 0:13:24,000
you don't sit around talking about carpentry.

336
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
No, you need to set people's souls ablaze

337
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
with visions of exploring distant shores."

338
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:32,000
And that's what we need to do, so let's be positive,

339
0:13:32.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and let's make progress with what could be

340
0:13:34.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
the most exciting period of innovation we've ever seen.

341
0:13:36.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
Thank you.

342
0:13:38.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000

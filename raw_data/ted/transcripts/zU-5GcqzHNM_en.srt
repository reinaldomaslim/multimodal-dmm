2
0:00:12.876,000 --> 0:00:14,000
We're going to share a lot of secrets today, you and I,

3
0:00:15.835,000 --> 0:00:17,000
and in doing so, I hope that we can lift

4
0:00:18.315,000 --> 0:00:2,000
some of the shame many of us feel about sex.

5
0:00:22.915,000 --> 0:00:25,000
How many here have ever been catcalled by a stranger?

6
0:00:28.075,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Lots of women.

7
0:00:30.521,000 --> 0:00:32,000
For me, the time I remember best

8
0:00:33.202,000 --> 0:00:36,000
is when that stranger was a student of mine.

9
0:00:37.595,000 --> 0:00:39,000
He came up to me after class that night

10
0:00:40.555,000 --> 0:00:42,000
and his words confirmed what I already knew:

11
0:00:43.435,000 --> 0:00:44,000
"I am so sorry, professor.

12
0:00:45.235,000 --> 0:00:48,000
If I had known it was you, I would never have said those things."

13
0:00:49.155,000 --> 0:00:51,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:51.475,000 --> 0:00:55,000
I wasn't a person to him until I was his professor.

15
0:00:56.515,000 --> 0:00:58,000
This concept, called objectification,

16
0:00:59.115,000 --> 0:01:01,000
is the foundation of sexism,

17
0:01:01.195,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and we see it reinforced through every aspect of our lives.

18
0:01:07.635,000 --> 0:01:09,000
We see it in the government

19
0:01:09.875,000 --> 0:01:12,000
that refuses to punish men

20
0:01:13.315,000 --> 0:01:14,000
for raping women.

21
0:01:15.075,000 --> 0:01:17,000
We see it in advertisements.

22
0:01:17.395,000 --> 0:01:19,000
How many of you have seen an advertisement

23
0:01:19.427,000 --> 0:01:24,000
that uses a woman's breast to sell an entirely unrelated product?

24
0:01:26.515,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Or movie after movie after movie

25
0:01:30.315,000 --> 0:01:32,000
that portrays women as only love interests?

26
0:01:34.195,000 --> 0:01:37,000
These examples might seem inconsequential and harmless,

27
0:01:37.835,000 --> 0:01:38,000
but they're insidious,

28
0:01:39.115,000 --> 0:01:43,000
slowly building into a culture that refuses to see women as people.

29
0:01:43.955,000 --> 0:01:47,000
We see this in the school that sends home a 10-year-old girl

30
0:01:48.169,000 --> 0:01:51,000
because her clothes were a distraction to boys trying to learn,

31
0:01:51.835,000 --> 0:01:56,000
or the government that refuses to punish men for raping women

32
0:01:57.035,000 --> 0:01:58,000
over and over,

33
0:01:58.635,000 --> 0:01:59,000
or the woman who is killed

34
0:02:00.115,000 --> 0:02:04,000
because she asked a man to stop grinding on her on the dance floor.

35
0:02:07.515,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Media plays a large role in perpetuating the objectification of women.

36
0:02:13.395,000 --> 0:02:15,000
Let's consider the classic romantic comedy.

37
0:02:16.235,000 --> 0:02:19,000
We're typically introduced to two kinds of women in these movies,

38
0:02:20.155,000 --> 0:02:22,000
two kinds of desirable women, anyway.

39
0:02:22.915,000 --> 0:02:24,000
The first is the sexy bombshell.

40
0:02:25.355,000 --> 0:02:28,000
This is the unbelievably gorgeous woman with the perfect body.

41
0:02:29.035,000 --> 0:02:31,000
Our leading man has no trouble identifying her

42
0:02:31.675,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and even less trouble having sex with her.

43
0:02:34.755,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The second is our leading lady,

44
0:02:36.635,000 --> 0:02:39,000
the beautiful but demure woman our leading man falls in love with

45
0:02:40.515,000 --> 0:02:42,000
despite not noticing her at first

46
0:02:42.675,000 --> 0:02:44,000
or not liking her if he did.

47
0:02:45.835,000 --> 0:02:47,000
The first is the slut.

48
0:02:47.875,000 --> 0:02:49,000
She is to be consumed and forgotten.

49
0:02:49.915,000 --> 0:02:5,000
She is much too available.

50
0:02:51.795,000 --> 0:02:54,000
The second is desirable but modest,

51
0:02:55.475,000 --> 0:02:58,000
and therefore worthy of our leading man's future babies.

52
0:02:58.955,000 --> 0:02:59,000
Marriage material.

53
0:03:00.755,000 --> 0:03:02,000
We're actually told that women have two roles,

54
0:03:03.715,000 --> 0:03:07,000
but these two roles have a difficult time existing within the same woman.

55
0:03:08.555,000 --> 0:03:11,000
On the rare occasion that I share with a new acquaintance

56
0:03:12.235,000 --> 0:03:13,000
that I study sex,

57
0:03:13.995,000 --> 0:03:15,000
if they don't end the conversation right then,

58
0:03:16.395,000 --> 0:03:18,000
they're usually pretty intrigued.

59
0:03:19.315,000 --> 0:03:2,000
"Oh. Tell me more."

60
0:03:21.115,000 --> 0:03:22,000
So I do.

61
0:03:24.195,000 --> 0:03:26,000
"I'm really interested in studying the sexual behaviors

62
0:03:26.835,000 --> 0:03:27,000
of pregnant and postpartum couples."

63
0:03:28.635,000 --> 0:03:31,000
At this point I get a different kind of response.

64
0:03:32.195,000 --> 0:03:33,000
(Laughter)

65
0:03:34.195,000 --> 0:03:35,000
"Oh. Huh.

66
0:03:36.675,000 --> 0:03:38,000
Do pregnant people even have sex?

67
0:03:40.075,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Have you thought about studying sexual desire

68
0:03:44.035,000 --> 0:03:45,000
or orgasms?

69
0:03:45.395,000 --> 0:03:48,000
That would be interesting, and sexy."

70
0:03:50.115,000 --> 0:03:52,000
Tell me. What are the first words that come to mind

71
0:03:52.675,000 --> 0:03:53,000
when you picture a pregnant woman?

72
0:03:55.275,000 --> 0:03:58,000
I asked this question in a survey of over 500 adults,

73
0:03:58.715,000 --> 0:04:01,000
and most responded with "belly" or "round"

74
0:04:02.315,000 --> 0:04:04,000
and "cute."

75
0:04:05.035,000 --> 0:04:06,000
This didn't surprise me too much.

76
0:04:06.675,000 --> 0:04:07,000
What else do we label as cute?

77
0:04:09.835,000 --> 0:04:11,000
Babies. Puppies. Kittens.

78
0:04:12.355,000 --> 0:04:13,000
The elderly. Right?

79
0:04:14.035,000 --> 0:04:15,000
(Laughter)

80
0:04:17.05,000 --> 0:04:19,000
When we label an adult as cute, though,

81
0:04:19.731,000 --> 0:04:21,000
we take away a lot of their intelligence,

82
0:04:22.235,000 --> 0:04:23,000
their complexity.

83
0:04:24.195,000 --> 0:04:26,000
We reduce them to childlike qualities.

84
0:04:27.555,000 --> 0:04:28,000
I also asked heterosexual men

85
0:04:29.235,000 --> 0:04:32,000
to imagine a woman that they're partnered with is pregnant,

86
0:04:32.395,000 --> 0:04:34,000
and then asked women to imagine that they are pregnant,

87
0:04:35.195,000 --> 0:04:37,000
and then tell me the first words that come to mind

88
0:04:37.835,000 --> 0:04:39,000
when they imagine having sex.

89
0:04:40.955,000 --> 0:04:42,000
Most of the responses were negative.

90
0:04:44.242,000 --> 0:04:45,000
"Gross."

91
0:04:45.693,000 --> 0:04:46,000
"Awkward."

92
0:04:47.09,000 --> 0:04:49,000
"Not sexy." "Odd."

93
0:04:49.555,000 --> 0:04:5,000
"Uncomfortable."

94
0:04:51.235,000 --> 0:04:52,000
"How?"

95
0:04:52.515,000 --> 0:04:54,000
(Laughter)

96
0:04:55.315,000 --> 0:04:58,000
"Not worth the trouble." "Not worth the risk."

97
0:04:58.435,000 --> 0:05:,000
That last one really stuck with me.

98
0:05:01.715,000 --> 0:05:05,000
We might think that because we divorce pregnant women and moms from sexuality,

99
0:05:06.475,000 --> 0:05:11,000
we are removing the constraints of sexual objectification.

100
0:05:11.515,000 --> 0:05:13,000
They experience less sexism. Right?

101
0:05:14.235,000 --> 0:05:15,000
Not exactly.

102
0:05:15.835,000 --> 0:05:18,000
What happens instead is a different kind of objectification.

103
0:05:19.755,000 --> 0:05:21,000
In my efforts to explain this to others,

104
0:05:22.035,000 --> 0:05:25,000
one conversation led to the Venus of Willendorf,

105
0:05:25.835,000 --> 0:05:29,000
a Paleolithic figurine scholars assumed was a goddess of love and beauty,

106
0:05:30.675,000 --> 0:05:31,000
hence the name Venus.

107
0:05:32.515,000 --> 0:05:34,000
This theory was later revised, though,

108
0:05:34.675,000 --> 0:05:37,000
when scholars noted the sculptor's obvious focus

109
0:05:38.395,000 --> 0:05:41,000
on the figurine's reproductive features:

110
0:05:41.835,000 --> 0:05:44,000
large breasts, considered ideal for nursing;

111
0:05:45.115,000 --> 0:05:47,000
a round, possibly pregnant belly;

112
0:05:47.755,000 --> 0:05:5,000
the remnants of red dye, alluding to menstruation or birth.

113
0:05:52.555,000 --> 0:05:55,000
They also assumed that she was meant to be held or placed lying down

114
0:05:56.114,000 --> 0:06:,000
because her tiny feet don't allow her to be freestanding.

115
0:06:00.515,000 --> 0:06:01,000
She also had no face.

116
0:06:02.795,000 --> 0:06:06,000
For this reason, it was assumed that she was a representation of fertility

117
0:06:06.915,000 --> 0:06:08,000
and not a portrait of a person.

118
0:06:09.795,000 --> 0:06:1,000
She was an object.

119
0:06:11.675,000 --> 0:06:12,000
In the history of her interpretation,

120
0:06:13.515,000 --> 0:06:16,000
she went from object of ideal beauty and love

121
0:06:16.675,000 --> 0:06:17,000
to object of reproduction.

122
0:06:19.355,000 --> 0:06:21,000
I think this transition speaks more

123
0:06:21.835,000 --> 0:06:24,000
about the scholars who have interpreted her purpose

124
0:06:25.635,000 --> 0:06:29,000
than the actual purpose of the figurine herself.

125
0:06:30.355,000 --> 0:06:32,000
When a woman becomes pregnant,

126
0:06:32.475,000 --> 0:06:35,000
she leaves the realm of men's sexual desire

127
0:06:36.235,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and slides into her reproductive and child-rearing role.

128
0:06:40.835,000 --> 0:06:42,000
In doing so, she also becomes

129
0:06:43.475,000 --> 0:06:44,000
the property of the community,

130
0:06:45.275,000 --> 0:06:49,000
considered very important but only because she's pregnant. Right?

131
0:06:50.315,000 --> 0:06:52,000
I've taken to calling this the Willendorf effect,

132
0:06:52.835,000 --> 0:06:55,000
and once again we see it reinforced in many aspects of her life.

133
0:06:57.218,000 --> 0:06:59,000
Has anyone here ever been visibly pregnant?

134
0:06:59.755,000 --> 0:07:,000
(Laughter)

135
0:07:00.995,000 --> 0:07:01,000
Yeah. Lots of you, right?

136
0:07:02.275,000 --> 0:07:06,000
So how many of you ever had a stranger touch your belly during pregnancy,

137
0:07:06.435,000 --> 0:07:09,000
maybe without even asking your permission first?

138
0:07:09.795,000 --> 0:07:11,000
Or told what you can and cannot eat

139
0:07:12.555,000 --> 0:07:15,000
by somebody who is not your doctor, your medical care provider?

140
0:07:16.195,000 --> 0:07:18,000
Or asked private questions about your birth plan?

141
0:07:20.075,000 --> 0:07:22,000
And then told why those choices are all wrong?

142
0:07:23.555,000 --> 0:07:24,000
Yeah, me too.

143
0:07:24.795,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Or had a server refuse to bring you a glass of wine?

144
0:07:29.075,000 --> 0:07:31,000
This one might give you pause, I know, but stay with me.

145
0:07:31.835,000 --> 0:07:33,000
This is a huge secret.

146
0:07:33.955,000 --> 0:07:36,000
It is actually safe to drink in moderation during pregnancy.

147
0:07:38.515,000 --> 0:07:39,000
Many of us don't know this

148
0:07:40.075,000 --> 0:07:43,000
because doctors don't trust pregnant women with this secret --

149
0:07:43.835,000 --> 0:07:44,000
(Laughter)

150
0:07:49.355,000 --> 0:07:53,000
especially if she's less educated or a woman of color.

151
0:07:53.635,000 --> 0:07:54,000
What this tells us is,

152
0:07:55.395,000 --> 0:07:59,000
this Willendorf effect, it's also classist and racist.

153
0:07:59.635,000 --> 0:08:04,000
It's present when the government reminds women

154
0:08:05.555,000 --> 0:08:07,000
with every new anti-choice bill

155
0:08:08.235,000 --> 0:08:1,000
that the contents of her uterus are not her own,

156
0:08:11.115,000 --> 0:08:13,000
or when an ob-gyn says,

157
0:08:13.195,000 --> 0:08:15,000
"While it's safe to have sex during pregnancy,

158
0:08:15.515,000 --> 0:08:16,000
sometimes you never know.

159
0:08:16.875,000 --> 0:08:17,000
Better safe than sorry, right?"

160
0:08:19.395,000 --> 0:08:23,000
She's denied basic privacy and bodily autonomy

161
0:08:23.675,000 --> 0:08:25,000
under the guise of "be a good mother."

162
0:08:26.155,000 --> 0:08:28,000
We don't trust her to make her own decisions.

163
0:08:29.115,000 --> 0:08:3,000
She's cute, remember?

164
0:08:33.795,000 --> 0:08:35,000
When we tell women

165
0:08:36.115,000 --> 0:08:38,000
that sexual pleasure -- excuse me.

166
0:08:39.075,000 --> 0:08:43,000
When we tell women that sex isn't worth the risk during pregnancy,

167
0:08:43.915,000 --> 0:08:47,000
what we're telling her is that her sexual pleasure doesn't matter.

168
0:08:48.195,000 --> 0:08:51,000
So what we are telling her is that she in fact doesn't matter,

169
0:08:51.515,000 --> 0:08:55,000
even though the needs of her fetus are not at odds with her own needs.

170
0:08:57.195,000 --> 0:08:59,000
So medical providers,

171
0:08:59.475,000 --> 0:09:01,000
such as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists

172
0:09:02.475,000 --> 0:09:06,000
have the opportunity to educate about the safety of sex during pregnancy.

173
0:09:07.395,000 --> 0:09:08,000
So what do the experts say?

174
0:09:09.755,000 --> 0:09:11,000
ACOG actually has no public official statement

175
0:09:12.275,000 --> 0:09:15,000
about the safety of sex during pregnancy.

176
0:09:16.078,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Guidance from the Mayo Clinic is generally positive

177
0:09:19.115,000 --> 0:09:21,000
but presented with a caveat:

178
0:09:21.635,000 --> 0:09:24,000
"Although most women can safely have sex throughout pregnancy,

179
0:09:24.81,000 --> 0:09:26,000
sometimes it's best to be cautious."

180
0:09:26.955,000 --> 0:09:29,000
Some women don't want to have sex during pregnancy,

181
0:09:30.075,000 --> 0:09:31,000
and that's OK.

182
0:09:31.355,000 --> 0:09:33,000
Some women do want to have sex during pregnancy,

183
0:09:33.995,000 --> 0:09:34,000
and that's OK, too.

184
0:09:35.435,000 --> 0:09:37,000
What needs to stop is society telling women

185
0:09:38.115,000 --> 0:09:4,000
what they can and cannot do with their bodies.

186
0:09:41.475,000 --> 0:09:43,000
(Applause)

187
0:09:48.035,000 --> 0:09:52,000
Pregnant women are not faceless, identity-less vessels of reproduction

188
0:09:52.715,000 --> 0:09:54,000
who can't stand on their own two feet.

189
0:09:56.115,000 --> 0:09:58,000
But the truth is, the real secret is,

190
0:09:58.555,000 --> 0:10:02,000
we tell all women that their sexual pleasure doesn't matter.

191
0:10:02.835,000 --> 0:10:05,000
We refuse to even acknowledge that women who have sex with women

192
0:10:06.075,000 --> 0:10:08,000
or women who don't want children even exist.

193
0:10:08.835,000 --> 0:10:09,000
"Oh, it's just a phase ...

194
0:10:10.555,000 --> 0:10:12,000
she just needs the right man to come along."

195
0:10:14.155,000 --> 0:10:16,000
Every time a woman has sex

196
0:10:16.515,000 --> 0:10:17,000
simply because it feels good,

197
0:10:18.515,000 --> 0:10:19,000
it is revolutionary.

198
0:10:20.275,000 --> 0:10:22,000
She is revolutionary.

199
0:10:22.475,000 --> 0:10:24,000
She is pushing back against society's insistence

200
0:10:25.075,000 --> 0:10:27,000
that she exist simply for men's pleasure

201
0:10:27.315,000 --> 0:10:28,000
or for reproduction.

202
0:10:30.435,000 --> 0:10:33,000
A woman who prioritizes her sexual needs is scary,

203
0:10:34.435,000 --> 0:10:39,000
because a woman who prioritizes her sexual needs prioritizes herself.

204
0:10:39.595,000 --> 0:10:42,000
(Applause)

205
0:10:43.395,000 --> 0:10:47,000
That is a woman demanding that she be treated as an equal.

206
0:10:47.835,000 --> 0:10:48,000
That is a woman who insists

207
0:10:49.395,000 --> 0:10:52,000
that you make room for her at the table of power,

208
0:10:52.755,000 --> 0:10:53,000
and that is the most terrifying of all

209
0:10:54.675,000 --> 0:10:56,000
because we can't make room for her

210
0:10:57.515,000 --> 0:11:,000
without some of us giving up the extra space we hold.

211
0:11:02.835,000 --> 0:11:04,000
(Applause)

212
0:11:08.475,000 --> 0:11:09,000
I have one last secret for you.

213
0:11:10.955,000 --> 0:11:11,000
I am the mother of two boys

214
0:11:12.835,000 --> 0:11:14,000
and we could use your help.

215
0:11:15.315,000 --> 0:11:19,000
Even though my boys hear me say regularly

216
0:11:20.035,000 --> 0:11:23,000
that it's important for men to recognize women as equals

217
0:11:23.595,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and they see their father modeling this,

218
0:11:26.155,000 --> 0:11:3,000
we need what happens in the world to reinforce what happens in our home.

219
0:11:30.595,000 --> 0:11:33,000
This is not a men's problem or a women's problem.

220
0:11:33.915,000 --> 0:11:34,000
This is everyone's problem,

221
0:11:35.515,000 --> 0:11:39,000
and we all play a role in dismantling systems of inequality.

222
0:11:40.515,000 --> 0:11:42,000
For starters, we have got to stop telling women

223
0:11:43.155,000 --> 0:11:45,000
what they can and cannot do with their bodies.

224
0:11:45.595,000 --> 0:11:48,000
(Applause)

225
0:11:50.235,000 --> 0:11:53,000
This includes not treating pregnant women like community property.

226
0:11:54.155,000 --> 0:11:57,000
If you don't know her, don't even ask to touch her belly.

227
0:11:57.875,000 --> 0:11:58,000
You wouldn't anybody else.

228
0:11:59.595,000 --> 0:12:01,000
Don't tell her what she can and cannot eat.

229
0:12:01.755,000 --> 0:12:04,000
Don't ask her private details about her medical decisions.

230
0:12:04.795,000 --> 0:12:05,000
This also includes understanding

231
0:12:06.715,000 --> 0:12:08,000
that even if you are personally against abortion,

232
0:12:09.315,000 --> 0:12:11,000
you can still fight for a woman's right to choose.

233
0:12:12.515,000 --> 0:12:15,000
When it comes to women's equality, the two need not oppose one another.

234
0:12:16.995,000 --> 0:12:18,000
If you're somebody who has sex with women,

235
0:12:19.275,000 --> 0:12:2,000
prioritize her pleasure.

236
0:12:20.795,000 --> 0:12:22,000
If you don't know how, ask.

237
0:12:24.075,000 --> 0:12:25,000
If you have children --

238
0:12:25.595,000 --> 0:12:26,000
(Laughter)

239
0:12:27.555,000 --> 0:12:3,000
have conversations about sex as early as possible,

240
0:12:31.355,000 --> 0:12:35,000
because kids don't look up s-e-x in the dictionary anymore.

241
0:12:35.755,000 --> 0:12:36,000
They look it up on the internet.

242
0:12:38.355,000 --> 0:12:4,000
And when you're having those conversations about sex,

243
0:12:41.795,000 --> 0:12:42,000
don't center them on reproduction only.

244
0:12:43.755,000 --> 0:12:44,000
People have sex for many reasons,

245
0:12:45.435,000 --> 0:12:46,000
some because they want a baby,

246
0:12:47.235,000 --> 0:12:49,000
but most of us have sex because it feels good.

247
0:12:50.195,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Admit it.

248
0:12:52.795,000 --> 0:12:54,000
And regardless of whether you have children or not,

249
0:12:55.395,000 --> 0:12:59,000
support comprehensive sex education that doesn't shame our teenagers.

250
0:12:59.675,000 --> 0:13:01,000
(Applause)

251
0:13:08.155,000 --> 0:13:1,000
Nothing positive comes from shaming teens

252
0:13:10.755,000 --> 0:13:12,000
for their sexual desires, behaviors,

253
0:13:14.155,000 --> 0:13:17,000
other than positive STD and pregnancy tests.

254
0:13:18.635,000 --> 0:13:21,000
Every single day, we are all given the opportunity

255
0:13:21.715,000 --> 0:13:23,000
to disrupt patterns of inequality.

256
0:13:24.995,000 --> 0:13:27,000
I think we can all agree that it's worth the trouble to do so.

257
0:13:29.235,000 --> 0:13:3,000
Thank you.

258
0:13:30.475,000 --> 0:13:36,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:18,000
As a researcher, every once in a while

2
0:00:18.26,000 --> 0:00:2,000
you encounter something

3
0:00:20.26,000 --> 0:00:22,000
a little disconcerting.

4
0:00:22.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
And this is something that changes your understanding of the world around you,

5
0:00:25.26,000 --> 0:00:27,000
and teaches you that you're very wrong

6
0:00:27.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
about something that you really believed firmly in.

7
0:00:31.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
And these are unfortunate moments,

8
0:00:34.26,000 --> 0:00:36,000
because you go to sleep that night

9
0:00:36.26,000 --> 0:00:39,000
dumber than when you woke up.

10
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
So, that's really the goal of my talk,

11
0:00:41.26,000 --> 0:00:43,000
is to A, communicate that moment to you

12
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:45,000
and B, have you leave this session

13
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
a little dumber than when you entered.

14
0:00:47.26,000 --> 0:00:5,000
So, I hope I can really accomplish that.

15
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:53,000
So, this incident that I'm going to describe

16
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:56,000
really began with some diarrhea.

17
0:00:56.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Now, we've known for a long time the cause of diarrhea.

18
0:00:59.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
That's why there's a glass of water up there.

19
0:01:02.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
For us, it's a problem, the people in this room.

20
0:01:04.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
For babies, it's deadly.

21
0:01:07.26,000 --> 0:01:11,000
They lack nutrients, and diarrhea dehydrates them.

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:13,000
And so, as a result, there is a lot of death,

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
a lot of death.

24
0:01:16.26,000 --> 0:01:18,000
In India in 1960,

25
0:01:18.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
there was a 24 percent child mortality rate,

26
0:01:20.26,000 --> 0:01:24,000
lots of people didn't make it. This is incredibly unfortunate.

27
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
One of the big reasons this happened was

28
0:01:26.26,000 --> 0:01:28,000
because of diarrhea.

29
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:31,000
Now, there was a big effort to solve this problem,

30
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:35,000
and there was actually a big solution.

31
0:01:35.26,000 --> 0:01:37,000
This solution has been called, by some,

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:39,000
"potentially the most important medical

33
0:01:39.26,000 --> 0:01:42,000
advance this century."

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:45,000
Now, the solution turned out to be simple.

35
0:01:45.26,000 --> 0:01:49,000
And what it was was oral rehydration salts.

36
0:01:49.26,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Many of you have probably used this.

37
0:01:51.26,000 --> 0:01:53,000
It's brilliant. It's a way to get sodium

38
0:01:53.26,000 --> 0:01:56,000
and glucose together so that when you add it to water

39
0:01:56.26,000 --> 0:01:59,000
the child is able to absorb it even during situations of diarrhea.

40
0:01:59.26,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Remarkable impact on mortality.

41
0:02:03.26,000 --> 0:02:05,000
Massive solution to the problem.

42
0:02:05.26,000 --> 0:02:08,000
Flash forward: 1960, 24 percent child mortality

43
0:02:08.26,000 --> 0:02:1,000
has dropped to 6.5 percent today.

44
0:02:10.26,000 --> 0:02:13,000
Still a big number, but a big drop.

45
0:02:13.26,000 --> 0:02:16,000
It looks like the technological problem is solved.

46
0:02:16.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
But if you look, even today

47
0:02:18.26,000 --> 0:02:2,000
there are about 400,000 diarrhea-related deaths

48
0:02:20.26,000 --> 0:02:22,000
in India alone.

49
0:02:22.26,000 --> 0:02:24,000
What's going on here?

50
0:02:24.26,000 --> 0:02:27,000
Well the easy answer is, we just haven't gotten those salts

51
0:02:27.26,000 --> 0:02:29,000
to those people.

52
0:02:29.26,000 --> 0:02:31,000
That's actually not true.

53
0:02:31.26,000 --> 0:02:34,000
If you look in areas where these salts are completely available,

54
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:37,000
the price is low or zero, these deaths still continue abated.

55
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
Maybe there's a biological answer.

56
0:02:39.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
Maybe these are the deaths that simple rehydration

57
0:02:41.26,000 --> 0:02:44,000
alone doesn't solve. That's not true either.

58
0:02:44.26,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Many of these deaths were completely preventable,

59
0:02:49.26,000 --> 0:02:52,000
and this what I want to think of as the disconcerting thing,

60
0:02:52.26,000 --> 0:02:54,000
what I want to call "the last mile" problem.

61
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:58,000
See, we spent a lot of energy, in many domains --

62
0:02:58.26,000 --> 0:03:,000
technological, scientific, hard work,

63
0:03:00.26,000 --> 0:03:02,000
creativity, human ingenuity --

64
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:06,000
to crack important social problems with technology solutions.

65
0:03:06.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
That's been the discoveries of the last 2,000 years,

66
0:03:08.26,000 --> 0:03:1,000
that's mankind moving forward.

67
0:03:10.26,000 --> 0:03:13,000
But in this case we cracked it,

68
0:03:13.26,000 --> 0:03:15,000
but a big part of the problem still remains.

69
0:03:15.26,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Nine hundred and ninety-nine miles went well,

70
0:03:17.26,000 --> 0:03:2,000
the last mile's proving incredibly stubborn.

71
0:03:20.26,000 --> 0:03:24,000
Now, that's for oral rehydration therapy.

72
0:03:24.26,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Maybe this is something unique about diarrhea.

73
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Well, it turns out -- and this is where things get really disconcerting --

74
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:3,000
it's not unique to diarrhea.

75
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It's not even unique to poor people in India.

76
0:03:32.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Here's an example from a variety of contexts.

77
0:03:35.26,000 --> 0:03:37,000
I've put a bunch of examples up here.

78
0:03:37.26,000 --> 0:03:4,000
I'll start with insulin, diabetes

79
0:03:40.26,000 --> 0:03:42,000
medication in the U.S.

80
0:03:42.26,000 --> 0:03:44,000
OK, the American population.

81
0:03:44.26,000 --> 0:03:46,000
On Medicaid -- if you're fairly poor you get Medicaid,

82
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
or if you have health insurance -- insulin is pretty straightforward.

83
0:03:48.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
You get it, either in pill form or you get it as an injection;

84
0:03:52.26,000 --> 0:03:54,000
you have to take it every day to maintain your blood sugar levels.

85
0:03:54.26,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Massive technological advance:

86
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:58,000
took an incredibly deadly disease, made it solvable.

87
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:01,000
Adherence rates. How many people are taking their insulin every day?

88
0:04:01.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
About on average, a typical person is taking it 75 percent of the time.

89
0:04:05.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
As a result, 25,000 people a year go blind,

90
0:04:10.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
hundreds of thousands lose limbs, every year,

91
0:04:12.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
for something that's solvable.

92
0:04:14.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Here I have a bunch of other examples,

93
0:04:16.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
all suffer from the last mile problem.

94
0:04:18.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
It's not just medicine.

95
0:04:20.26,000 --> 0:04:22,000
Here's another example from technology:

96
0:04:22.26,000 --> 0:04:24,000
agriculture. We think

97
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
there's a food problem, so we create new seeds.

98
0:04:26.26,000 --> 0:04:28,000
We think there's an income problem, so we create

99
0:04:28.26,000 --> 0:04:31,000
new ways of farming that increase income.

100
0:04:31.26,000 --> 0:04:34,000
Well, look at some old ways, some ways that we'd already cracked.

101
0:04:34.26,000 --> 0:04:36,000
Intercropping. Intercropping really increases income.

102
0:04:36.26,000 --> 0:04:39,000
Sometimes in rice we found incredible increases in yield

103
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:41,000
when you mix different varieties of rice side by side.

104
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
Some people are doing that,

105
0:04:43.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
many are not. What's going on?

106
0:04:45.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
This is the last mile.

107
0:04:47.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
The last mile is, everywhere, problematic.

108
0:04:49.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
Alright, what's the problem?

109
0:04:51.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
The problem is this little three-pound machine

110
0:04:54.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
that's behind your eyes and between your ears.

111
0:04:58.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
This machine is really strange,

112
0:05:00.26,000 --> 0:05:04,000
and one of the consequences is that people are weird.

113
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
They do lots of inconsistent things.

114
0:05:08.26,000 --> 0:05:1,000
(Applause)

115
0:05:10.26,000 --> 0:05:13,000
They do lots of inconsistent things.

116
0:05:13.26,000 --> 0:05:15,000
And the inconsistencies

117
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:18,000
create, fundamentally, this last mile problem.

118
0:05:18.26,000 --> 0:05:21,000
See, when we were dealing with our biology, bacteria,

119
0:05:21.26,000 --> 0:05:24,000
the genes, the things inside here, the blood?

120
0:05:24.26,000 --> 0:05:27,000
That's complex, but it's manageable.

121
0:05:27.26,000 --> 0:05:3,000
When we're dealing with people like this?

122
0:05:30.26,000 --> 0:05:32,000
The mind is more complex.

123
0:05:32.26,000 --> 0:05:34,000
That's not as manageable, and that's what we're struggling with.

124
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
Let me go back to diarrhea for a second.

125
0:05:37.26,000 --> 0:05:4,000
Here's a question that was asked in the National Sample Survey,

126
0:05:40.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
which is a survey asked of many Indian women:

127
0:05:42.26,000 --> 0:05:44,000
"Your child has diarrhea.

128
0:05:44.26,000 --> 0:05:47,000
Should you increase, maintain or decrease the number of fluids?"

129
0:05:47.26,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Just so you don't embarrass yourselves, I'll give you the right answer:

130
0:05:50.26,000 --> 0:05:52,000
It's increase.

131
0:05:54.26,000 --> 0:05:55,000
Now, diarrhea's interesting

132
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
because it's been around for thousands of years,

133
0:05:57.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
ever since humankind really

134
0:06:00.26,000 --> 0:06:03,000
lived side by side enough to have really polluted water.

135
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
One Roman strategy that was very interesting

136
0:06:05.26,000 --> 0:06:07,000
was that -- and it really gave them a comparative advantage --

137
0:06:07.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
they made sure their soldiers didn't drink

138
0:06:10.26,000 --> 0:06:12,000
even remotely muddied waters.

139
0:06:12.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
Because if some of your troops get diarrhea they're not that effective

140
0:06:15.26,000 --> 0:06:17,000
on the battlefield.

141
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
So, if you think of Roman comparative advantage part of it was the breast shields,

142
0:06:19.26,000 --> 0:06:23,000
the breastplates, but part of it was drinking the right water.

143
0:06:23.26,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So, here are these women. They've seen their parents

144
0:06:25.26,000 --> 0:06:27,000
have struggled with diarrhea, they've struggled with diarrhea,

145
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:3,000
they've seen lots of deaths. How do they answer this question?

146
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
In India, 35 to 50 percent say "Reduce."

147
0:06:34.26,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Think about what that means for a second.

148
0:06:36.26,000 --> 0:06:38,000
Thirty-five to 50 percent of women

149
0:06:38.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
forget oral rehydration therapy,

150
0:06:40.26,000 --> 0:06:42,000
they are increasing --

151
0:06:42.26,000 --> 0:06:45,000
they are actually making their child

152
0:06:45.26,000 --> 0:06:48,000
more likely to die through their actions.

153
0:06:48.26,000 --> 0:06:5,000
How is that possible?

154
0:06:50.26,000 --> 0:06:53,000
Well, one possibility -- I think that's how most people respond to this --

155
0:06:53.26,000 --> 0:06:57,000
is to say, "That's just stupid."

156
0:06:57.26,000 --> 0:06:59,000
I don't think that's stupid.

157
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:02,000
I think there is something very profoundly right in what these women are doing.

158
0:07:02.26,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And that is, you don't put water

159
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:06,000
into a leaky bucket.

160
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
So, think of the mental model that goes behind reducing the intake.

161
0:07:10.26,000 --> 0:07:12,000
Just doesn't make sense.

162
0:07:12.26,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Now, the model is intuitively right.

163
0:07:15.26,000 --> 0:07:19,000
It just doesn't happen to be right about the world.

164
0:07:19.26,000 --> 0:07:22,000
But it makes a whole lot of sense at some deep level.

165
0:07:22.26,000 --> 0:07:25,000
And that, to me, is the fundamental challenge

166
0:07:25.26,000 --> 0:07:3,000
of the last mile.

167
0:07:30.26,000 --> 0:07:33,000
This first challenge is what I refer to as the persuasion challenge.

168
0:07:33.26,000 --> 0:07:35,000
Convincing people to do something --

169
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
take oral rehydration therapy, intercrop, whatever it might be --

170
0:07:37.26,000 --> 0:07:4,000
is not an act of information:

171
0:07:40.26,000 --> 0:07:42,000
"Let's give them the data,

172
0:07:42.26,000 --> 0:07:44,000
and when they have data they'll do the right thing."

173
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:46,000
It's more complex than that.

174
0:07:46.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
And if you want to understand how it's more complex

175
0:07:48.26,000 --> 0:07:52,000
let me start with something kind of interesting.

176
0:07:52.26,000 --> 0:07:54,000
I'm going to give you a little math problem,

177
0:07:54.26,000 --> 0:07:57,000
and I want you to just yell out the answer as fast as possible.

178
0:07:57.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
A bat and a ball together cost $1.10.

179
0:07:59.26,000 --> 0:08:02,000
The bat costs a dollar more than the ball.

180
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
How much does the ball cost? Quick.

181
0:08:05.26,000 --> 0:08:07,000
So, somebody out there says, "Five."

182
0:08:07.26,000 --> 0:08:09,000
A lot of you said, "Ten."

183
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
Let's think about 10 for a second.

184
0:08:12.26,000 --> 0:08:16,000
If the ball costs 10, the bat costs...

185
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:18,000
this is easy, $1.10.

186
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:21,000
Yeah. So, together they would cost $1.20.

187
0:08:21.26,000 --> 0:08:24,000
So, here you all are, ostensibly educated people.

188
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:27,000
Most of you look smart.

189
0:08:27.26,000 --> 0:08:3,000
The combination of that produces

190
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
something that is actually, you got this thing wrong.

191
0:08:32.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
How is that possible? Let's go to something else.

192
0:08:35.26,000 --> 0:08:38,000
I know algebra can be complicated.

193
0:08:38.26,000 --> 0:08:41,000
So, let's dial this back. That's what? Fifth grade? Fourth grade?

194
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Let's go back to kindergarten. OK?

195
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
There's a great show on American television that you have to watch.

196
0:08:46.26,000 --> 0:08:48,000
It's called "Are You Smarter Than a Fifth Grader?"

197
0:08:48.26,000 --> 0:08:51,000
I think we've learned the answer to that here.

198
0:08:51.26,000 --> 0:08:54,000
Let's move to kindergarten. Let's see if we can beat five-year-olds.

199
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
Here's what I'm going to do: I'm going to put objects on the screen.

200
0:08:57.26,000 --> 0:09:01,000
I just want you to name the color of the object.

201
0:09:01.26,000 --> 0:09:03,000
That's all it is. OK?

202
0:09:03.26,000 --> 0:09:06,000
I want you to do it fast, and say it out loud with me,

203
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
and do it quickly. I'll make the first one easy for you.

204
0:09:08.26,000 --> 0:09:1,000
Ready? Black.

205
0:09:10.26,000 --> 0:09:12,000
Now the next ones I want you to do quickly and say it out loud.

206
0:09:12.26,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Ready? Go.

207
0:09:14.26,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Audience: Red. Green.

208
0:09:16.26,000 --> 0:09:18,000
Yellow. Blue. Red.

209
0:09:18.26,000 --> 0:09:21,000
(Laughter)

210
0:09:21.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
Sendhil Mullainathan: That's pretty good.

211
0:09:25.26,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Almost out of kindergarten.

212
0:09:27.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
What is all this telling us?

213
0:09:29.26,000 --> 0:09:32,000
You see, what's going on here, and in the bat and ball problem

214
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:35,000
is that you have some intuitive ways of interacting with the world,

215
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:37,000
some models that you use to understand the world.

216
0:09:37.26,000 --> 0:09:39,000
These models, like the leaky bucket,

217
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:41,000
work well in most situations.

218
0:09:41.26,000 --> 0:09:43,000
I suspect most of you --

219
0:09:43.26,000 --> 0:09:45,000
I hope that's true for the rest of you --

220
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:49,000
actually do pretty well with addition and subtraction in the real world.

221
0:09:49.26,000 --> 0:09:51,000
I found a problem, a specific problem

222
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:54,000
that actually found an error with that.

223
0:09:54.26,000 --> 0:09:56,000
Diarrhea, and many last mile problems, are like that.

224
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:58,000
They are situations where the mental model

225
0:09:58.26,000 --> 0:10:,000
doesn't match the reality.

226
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
Same thing here:

227
0:10:02.26,000 --> 0:10:04,000
You had an intuitive response to this that was very quick.

228
0:10:04.26,000 --> 0:10:07,000
You read "blue" and you wanted to say "blue," even though you knew your task was red.

229
0:10:07.26,000 --> 0:10:09,000
Now, I do this stuff because it's fun.

230
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
But it's more profound than fun.

231
0:10:13.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
I'll give you a good example of how it actually effects persuasion.

232
0:10:16.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
BMW is a pretty safe car.

233
0:10:19.26,000 --> 0:10:21,000
And they are trying to figure out, "Safety is good.

234
0:10:21.26,000 --> 0:10:23,000
I want to advertise safety. How am I going to advertise safety?"

235
0:10:23.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
"I could give people numbers. We do well on crash tests."

236
0:10:26.26,000 --> 0:10:28,000
But the truth of the matter is, you look at that car,

237
0:10:28.26,000 --> 0:10:3,000
it doesn't look like a Volvo,

238
0:10:30.26,000 --> 0:10:32,000
and it doesn't look like a Hummer.

239
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
So, what I want you to think about for a few minutes

240
0:10:34.26,000 --> 0:10:37,000
is: How would you convey safety of the BMW? Okay?

241
0:10:37.26,000 --> 0:10:4,000
So now, while you're thinking about that let's move to a second task.

242
0:10:40.26,000 --> 0:10:43,000
The second task is fuel efficiency. Okay?

243
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:45,000
Here's another puzzle for all of you.

244
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
One person walks into a car lot,

245
0:10:47.26,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and they're thinking about buying this Toyota Yaris.

246
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
They are saying, "This is 35 miles per gallon. I'm going to do

247
0:10:52.26,000 --> 0:10:54,000
the environmentally right thing, I'm going to buy the Prius,

248
0:10:54.26,000 --> 0:10:56,000
50 miles per gallon."

249
0:10:56.26,000 --> 0:10:58,000
Another person walks into the lot,

250
0:10:58.26,000 --> 0:11:,000
and they're about to buy a Hummer, nine miles per gallon,

251
0:11:00.26,000 --> 0:11:02,000
fully loaded, luxury.

252
0:11:02.26,000 --> 0:11:06,000
And they say, "You know what? Do I need turbo? Do I need this heavyweight car?"

253
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:08,000
I'm going to do something good for the environment.

254
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
I'm going to take off some of that weight,

255
0:11:10.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
and I'm going to buy a Hummer that's 11 miles per gallon."

256
0:11:13.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
Which one of these people has done more for the environment?

257
0:11:16.26,000 --> 0:11:18,000
See, you have a mental model.

258
0:11:18.26,000 --> 0:11:21,000
Fifty versus 35, that's a big move. Eleven versus nine? Come on.

259
0:11:21.26,000 --> 0:11:24,000
Turns out, go home and do the math,

260
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:27,000
the nine to 11 is a bigger change. That person has saved more gallons.

261
0:11:27.26,000 --> 0:11:29,000
Why? Because we don't care about miles per gallon, we care about

262
0:11:29.26,000 --> 0:11:31,000
gallons per mile.

263
0:11:31.26,000 --> 0:11:34,000
Think about how powerful that is if you're trying to encourage fuel efficiency.

264
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
Miles per gallon is the way we present things.

265
0:11:36.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
If we want to encourage change of behavior,

266
0:11:39.26,000 --> 0:11:41,000
gallons per mile would have far more effectiveness.

267
0:11:41.26,000 --> 0:11:44,000
Researchers have found these type of anomalies.

268
0:11:44.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
Okay, back to BMW. What should they do?

269
0:11:47.26,000 --> 0:11:5,000
The problem BMW faces is this car looks safe.

270
0:11:50.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
This car, which is my Mini, doesn't look that safe.

271
0:11:54.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
Here was BMW's brilliant insight, which they embodied into an ad campaign.

272
0:11:57.26,000 --> 0:11:59,000
They showed a BMW driving down the street.

273
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:02,000
There's a truck on the right. Boxes fall out of the truck.

274
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:07,000
The car swerves to avoid it, and therefore doesn't get into an accident.

275
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:11,000
BWM realizes safety, in people's minds, has two components.

276
0:12:11.26,000 --> 0:12:15,000
You can be safe because when you're hit, you survive,

277
0:12:15.26,000 --> 0:12:17,000
or you can be safe because you avoid accidents.

278
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:19,000
Remarkably successful campaign, but notice the power of it.

279
0:12:19.26,000 --> 0:12:22,000
It harnesses something you already believe.

280
0:12:22.26,000 --> 0:12:26,000
Now, even if I persuaded you to do something,

281
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:3,000
it's hard sometimes to actually get action as a result.

282
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:32,000
You all probably intended to wake up,

283
0:12:32.26,000 --> 0:12:35,000
I don't know, 6:30, 7 a.m.

284
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
This is a battle we all fight every day,

285
0:12:37.26,000 --> 0:12:4,000
along with trying to get to the gym.

286
0:12:40.26,000 --> 0:12:43,000
Now, this is an example of that battle,

287
0:12:43.26,000 --> 0:12:46,000
and makes us realize intentions don't always translate into action,

288
0:12:46.26,000 --> 0:12:48,000
and so one of the fundamental challenges

289
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
is how we would actually do that. OK?

290
0:12:52.26,000 --> 0:12:55,000
So, let me now talk about the last mile problem.

291
0:12:55.26,000 --> 0:12:58,000
So far, I've been pretty negative.

292
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
I've been trying to show you the oddities of human behavior.

293
0:13:01.26,000 --> 0:13:03,000
And I think maybe I'm being too negative.

294
0:13:03.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Maybe it's the diarrhea.

295
0:13:05.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
Maybe the last mile problem really should be thought of

296
0:13:07.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
as the last mile opportunity.

297
0:13:09.26,000 --> 0:13:11,000
Let's go back to diabetes.

298
0:13:11.26,000 --> 0:13:14,000
This is a typical insulin injection.

299
0:13:14.26,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Now, carrying this thing around is complicated.

300
0:13:17.26,000 --> 0:13:21,000
You gotta carry the bottle, you gotta carry the syringe.

301
0:13:21.26,000 --> 0:13:23,000
It's also painful.

302
0:13:23.26,000 --> 0:13:27,000
Now, you may think to yourself, "Well, if my eyes depended on it,

303
0:13:27.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
you know, I would obviously use it every day."

304
0:13:29.26,000 --> 0:13:31,000
But the pain, the discomfort,

305
0:13:31.26,000 --> 0:13:33,000
you know, paying attention, remembering to put it in your purse

306
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:35,000
when you go on a long trip:

307
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:39,000
These are the day-to-day of life, and they do pose problems.

308
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:42,000
Here is an innovation, a design innovation.

309
0:13:42.26,000 --> 0:13:46,000
This is a pen, it's called an insulin pen, preloaded.

310
0:13:46.26,000 --> 0:13:47,000
The needle is particularly sharp.

311
0:13:47.26,000 --> 0:13:49,000
You just gotta carry this thing around.

312
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
It's much easier to use, much less painful.

313
0:13:51.26,000 --> 0:13:55,000
Anywhere between five and 10 percent increase in adherence,

314
0:13:55.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
just as a result of this.

315
0:13:57.26,000 --> 0:14:,000
That's what I'm talking about as a last mile opportunity.

316
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:03,000
You see, we tend to think the problem is solved

317
0:14:03.26,000 --> 0:14:05,000
when we solve the technology problem.

318
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
But the human innovation, the human problem

319
0:14:07.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
still remains, and that's a great frontier that we have left.

320
0:14:11.26,000 --> 0:14:13,000
This isn't about the biology of people;

321
0:14:13.26,000 --> 0:14:17,000
this is now about the brains, the psychology of people,

322
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:19,000
and innovation needs to continue all the way through

323
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
the last mile.

324
0:14:21.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Here's another example of this.

325
0:14:23.26,000 --> 0:14:26,000
This is from a company called Positive Energy.

326
0:14:26.26,000 --> 0:14:28,000
This is about energy efficiency.

327
0:14:28.26,000 --> 0:14:31,000
We're spending a lot of time on fuel cells right now.

328
0:14:31.26,000 --> 0:14:33,000
What this company does is they send a letter

329
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:35,000
to households that say, "Here's your energy use,

330
0:14:35.26,000 --> 0:14:38,000
here's your neighbor's energy use: You're doing well." Smiley face.

331
0:14:38.26,000 --> 0:14:4,000
"You're doing worse." Frown.

332
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:43,000
And what they find is just this letter, nothing else,

333
0:14:43.26,000 --> 0:14:45,000
has a two to three percent reduction in electricity use.

334
0:14:45.26,000 --> 0:14:47,000
And you want to think about the social value of that

335
0:14:47.26,000 --> 0:14:49,000
in terms of carbon offsets, reduced electricity,

336
0:14:49.26,000 --> 0:14:51,000
900 million dollars per year.

337
0:14:51.26,000 --> 0:14:53,000
Why? Because for free,

338
0:14:53.26,000 --> 0:14:55,000
this isn't a new technology, this is a letter --

339
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
we're getting a Big Bang in behavior.

340
0:14:57.26,000 --> 0:15:01,000
So, how do we tackle the last mile?

341
0:15:01.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
I think this tells us there is an opportunity.

342
0:15:04.26,000 --> 0:15:06,000
And I think to tackle it, we need to combine

343
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:08,000
psychology,

344
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
marketing,

345
0:15:10.26,000 --> 0:15:12,000
art, we've seen that.

346
0:15:12.26,000 --> 0:15:14,000
But you know what we need to combine it with?

347
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
We need to combine this with the scientific method.

348
0:15:16.26,000 --> 0:15:2,000
See what's really puzzling and frustrating about the last mile, to me,

349
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
is that the first 999 miles are all about science.

350
0:15:23.26,000 --> 0:15:27,000
No one would say, "Hey, I think this medicine works, go ahead and use it."

351
0:15:27.26,000 --> 0:15:29,000
We have testing, we go to the lab, we try it again, we have refinement.

352
0:15:29.26,000 --> 0:15:32,000
But you know what we do on the last mile?

353
0:15:32.26,000 --> 0:15:35,000
"Oh, this is a good idea. People will like this. Let's put it out there."

354
0:15:35.26,000 --> 0:15:37,000
The amount of resources we put in are disparate.

355
0:15:37.26,000 --> 0:15:4,000
We put billions of dollars into fuel-efficient technologies.

356
0:15:40.26,000 --> 0:15:42,000
How much are we putting into

357
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:44,000
energy behavior change

358
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:47,000
in a credible, systematic, testing way?

359
0:15:47.26,000 --> 0:15:5,000
Now, I think that we're on the verge of something big.

360
0:15:50.26,000 --> 0:15:53,000
We're on the verge of a whole new social science.

361
0:15:53.26,000 --> 0:15:55,000
It's a social science that recognizes --

362
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:58,000
much like science recognizes the complexity of the body,

363
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:,000
biology recognizes the complexity of the body -- we'll recognize

364
0:16:00.26,000 --> 0:16:02,000
the complexity of the human mind.

365
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:04,000
The careful testing, retesting, design,

366
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
are going to open up vistas of understanding,

367
0:16:07.26,000 --> 0:16:09,000
complexities, difficult things.

368
0:16:09.26,000 --> 0:16:12,000
And those vistas will both create new science,

369
0:16:12.26,000 --> 0:16:16,000
and fundamental change in the world as we see it, in the next hundred years.

370
0:16:16.26,000 --> 0:16:18,000
All right. Thank you very much.

371
0:16:18.26,000 --> 0:16:2,000
(Applause)

372
0:16:20.26,000 --> 0:16:22,000
Chris Anderson: Sendhil, thank you so much.

373
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
So, this whole area is so fascinating.

374
0:16:25.26,000 --> 0:16:28,000
I mean, it sometimes feels, listening to behavioral economists

375
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:31,000
that they are kind of putting into place

376
0:16:31.26,000 --> 0:16:33,000
academically, what great marketers

377
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:36,000
have sort of intuitively known for a long time.

378
0:16:36.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
How much is your field talking to great marketers

379
0:16:40.26,000 --> 0:16:42,000
about their insights into human psychology?

380
0:16:42.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
Because they've seen it on the ground.

381
0:16:44.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Sendhil Mullainathan: Yeah, we spend a lot of time talking to marketers,

382
0:16:46.26,000 --> 0:16:49,000
and I think 60 percent of it is exactly what you say,

383
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:51,000
there are insights to be gleaned there.

384
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
Forty percent of it is about what marketing is.

385
0:16:53.26,000 --> 0:16:58,000
Marketing is selling an ad to a firm.

386
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
So, in some sense, a lot of marketing is about

387
0:17:00.26,000 --> 0:17:03,000
convincing a CEO, "This is a good ad campaign."

388
0:17:03.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
So, there is a little bit of slippage there.

389
0:17:05.26,000 --> 0:17:09,000
That's just a caveat. That's different from actually having an effective ad campaign.

390
0:17:09.26,000 --> 0:17:11,000
And one of the new movements in marketing is: How do we actually

391
0:17:11.26,000 --> 0:17:13,000
measure effectiveness? Are we effective?

392
0:17:13.26,000 --> 0:17:17,000
CA: How you take your insights here

393
0:17:17.26,000 --> 0:17:2,000
and actually get them integrated

394
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:23,000
into working business models on the ground,

395
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
in Indian villages, for example?

396
0:17:25.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
SM: So, the scientific method I alluded to is pretty important.

397
0:17:28.26,000 --> 0:17:3,000
We work closely with companies that have operational capacity,

398
0:17:30.26,000 --> 0:17:32,000
or nonprofits that have operational capacity.

399
0:17:32.26,000 --> 0:17:34,000
And then we say, "Well, you want to get this behavior change.

400
0:17:34.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Let's come up with a few ideas, test them,

401
0:17:37.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
see which is working, go back, synthesize,

402
0:17:39.26,000 --> 0:17:41,000
and try to come up with a thing that works,"

403
0:17:41.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
and then we're able to scale with partners.

404
0:17:43.26,000 --> 0:17:45,000
It's kind of the model that has worked in other contexts.

405
0:17:45.26,000 --> 0:17:47,000
If you have biological problems

406
0:17:47.26,000 --> 0:17:49,000
we try and fix it, see if it works, and then work the scale.

407
0:17:49.26,000 --> 0:17:52,000
CA: Alright Sendhil, thanks so much for coming to TED. Thank you.

408
0:17:52.26,000 --> 0:17:55,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:17,000
Great creativity. In times of need, we need great creativity.

2
0:00:17.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
Discuss. Great creativity is astonishingly, absurdly, rationally, irrationally powerful.

3
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Great creativity can spread tolerance, champion freedom,

4
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
make education seem like a bright idea.

5
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:33,000
(Laughter)

6
0:00:33.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation,

7
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:41,000
or show that deprivation ain't necessarily so.

8
0:00:41.16,000 --> 0:00:44,000
Great creativity can make politicians electable,

9
0:00:44.16,000 --> 0:00:47,000
or parties unelectable.

10
0:00:47.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce.

11
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:55,000
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts

12
0:00:55.16,000 --> 0:00:57,000
and phrases on our lips.

13
0:00:57.16,000 --> 0:01:,000
It's the pathfinder that shows us a simple road

14
0:01:00.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
through an impenetrable moral maze.

15
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Science is clever, but great creativity is something less knowable,

16
0:01:07.16,000 --> 0:01:1,000
more magical. And now we need that magic.

17
0:01:10.16,000 --> 0:01:12,000
This is a time of need.

18
0:01:12.16,000 --> 0:01:14,000
Our climate is changing quickly, too quickly.

19
0:01:14.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well:

20
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements.

21
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
To tempt us to act differently

22
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:26,000
with delightful creative scraps.

23
0:01:26.16,000 --> 0:01:29,000
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I'm involved in

24
0:01:29.16,000 --> 0:01:32,000
using creativity to inspire people to be greener.

25
0:01:32.16,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Video) Man: You know, rather than drive today, I'm going to walk.

26
0:01:36.16,000 --> 0:01:4,000
Narrator: And so he walked, and as he walked he saw things.

27
0:01:40.16,000 --> 0:01:44,000
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen.

28
0:01:44.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
A deer with an itchy leg. A flying motorcycle.

29
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall.

30
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
And then he stopped. Walking in front of him was her.

31
0:01:57.16,000 --> 0:01:59,000
The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields

32
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:01,000
and broken his heart.

33
0:02:01.16,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Sure, she had aged a little.

34
0:02:03.16,000 --> 0:02:04,000
In fact, she had aged a lot.

35
0:02:04.16,000 --> 0:02:07,000
But he felt all his old passion for her return.

36
0:02:07.16,000 --> 0:02:1,000
"Ford," he called softly. For that was her name.

37
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
"Don't say another word, Gusty," she said,

38
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:14,000
for that was his name.

39
0:02:14.16,000 --> 0:02:19,000
"I know a tent next to a caravan, exactly 300 yards from here.

40
0:02:19.16,000 --> 0:02:22,000
Let's go there and make love. In the tent."

41
0:02:22.16,000 --> 0:02:26,000
Ford undressed. She spread one leg, and then the other.

42
0:02:26.16,000 --> 0:02:3,000
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically

43
0:02:30.16,000 --> 0:02:33,000
while she filmed him, because she was a keen amateur pornographer.

44
0:02:33.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
The earth moved for both of them.

45
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:38,000
And they lived together happily ever after.

46
0:02:38.16,000 --> 0:02:43,000
And all because he decided to walk that day.

47
0:02:44.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
(Applause)

48
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:57,000
Andy Hobsbawm: We've got the science, we've had the debate.

49
0:02:57.16,000 --> 0:02:59,000
The moral imperative is on the table.

50
0:02:59.16,000 --> 0:03:01,000
Great creativity is needed to take it all,

51
0:03:01.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
make it simple and sharp.

52
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:07,000
To make it connect. To make it make people want to act.

53
0:03:07.16,000 --> 0:03:09,000
So this is a call, a plea,

54
0:03:09.16,000 --> 0:03:11,000
to the incredibly talented TED community.

55
0:03:11.16,000 --> 0:03:13,000
Let's get creative against climate change.

56
0:03:13.16,000 --> 0:03:15,000
And let's do it soon. Thank you.

57
0:03:15.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Applause)

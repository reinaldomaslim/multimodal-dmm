1
0:00:12.832,000 --> 0:00:13,000
I love infographics.

2
0:00:14.473,000 --> 0:00:15,000
As an information designer,

3
0:00:16.211,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I've worked with all sorts of data over the past 25 years.

4
0:00:19.437,000 --> 0:00:22,000
I have a few insights to share, but first: a little history.

5
0:00:24.793,000 --> 0:00:28,000
Communication is the encoding, transmission and decoding of information.

6
0:00:30.125,000 --> 0:00:33,000
Breakthroughs in communication mark turning points in human culture.

7
0:00:35.384,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Oracy, literacy and numeracy were great developments in communication.

8
0:00:40.216,000 --> 0:00:42,000
They allow us to encode ideas into words

9
0:00:42.921,000 --> 0:00:43,000
and quantities into numbers.

10
0:00:45.144,000 --> 0:00:48,000
Without communication, we'd still be stuck in the Stone Ages.

11
0:00:49.706,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Although humans have been around for a quarter million years,

12
0:00:52.636,000 --> 0:00:55,000
it was only 8,000 years ago that proto-writings began to surface.

13
0:00:56.703,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Nearly 3,000 years later, the first proper writing systems took shape.

14
0:01:03.608,000 --> 0:01:07,000
Maps have been around for millennia and diagrams for hundreds of years,

15
0:01:08.225,000 --> 0:01:1,000
but representing quantities through graphics

16
0:01:11.083,000 --> 0:01:12,000
is a relatively new development.

17
0:01:13.208,000 --> 0:01:17,000
It wasn't until 1786 that William Playfair invented the first bar chart,

18
0:01:18.09,000 --> 0:01:21,000
giving birth to visual display of quantitative information.

19
0:01:22.98,000 --> 0:01:25,000
Fifteen years later, he introduced the first pie and area charts.

20
0:01:27.225,000 --> 0:01:3,000
His inventions are still the most commonly used chart forms today.

21
0:01:32.698,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Florence Nightingale invented the coxcomb in 1857

22
0:01:36.92,000 --> 0:01:38,000
for a presentation to Queen Victoria on troop mortality.

23
0:01:40.193,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Highlighted in blue,

24
0:01:41.389,000 --> 0:01:44,000
she showed how most troops' deaths could have been prevented.

25
0:01:47.461,000 --> 0:01:51,000
Shortly after, Charles Minard charted Napoleon's march on Moscow,

26
0:01:52.138,000 --> 0:01:57,000
illustrating how an army of 422,000 dwindled to just 10,000

27
0:01:57.409,000 --> 0:02:01,000
as battles, geography and freezing temperatures took their toll.

28
0:02:01.885,000 --> 0:02:04,000
He combined a Sankey diagram with cartography

29
0:02:05.037,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and a line chart for temperature.

30
0:02:09.084,000 --> 0:02:11,000
I get excited when I get lots of data to play with,

31
0:02:11.862,000 --> 0:02:13,000
especially when it yields an interesting chart form.

32
0:02:17.364,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Here, Nightingale's coxcomb was the inspiration

33
0:02:21.025,000 --> 0:02:24,000
to organize data on thousands of federal energy subsidies,

34
0:02:24.288,000 --> 0:02:27,000
scrutinizing the lack of investment in renewables over fossil fuels.

35
0:02:30.543,000 --> 0:02:34,000
This Sankey diagram illustrates the flow of energy through the US economy,

36
0:02:34.779,000 --> 0:02:38,000
emphasizing how nearly half of the energy used is lost as waste heat.

37
0:02:42.598,000 --> 0:02:45,000
I love it when data can be sculpted into beautiful shapes.

38
0:02:45.798,000 --> 0:02:49,000
Here, the personal and professional connections of the women of Silicon Valley

39
0:02:50.254,000 --> 0:02:51,000
can be woven into arcs,

40
0:02:54.519,000 --> 0:02:57,000
same as the collaboration of inventors birthing patents across the globe

41
0:02:58.338,000 --> 0:02:59,000
can be mapped.

42
0:03:01.385,000 --> 0:03:02,000
I've even made charts for me.

43
0:03:03.213,000 --> 0:03:05,000
I'm a numbers person, so I rarely win at Scrabble.

44
0:03:06.25,000 --> 0:03:09,000
I made this diagram to remember all the two- and three-letter words

45
0:03:09.5,000 --> 0:03:1,000
in the official Scrabble dictionary.

46
0:03:11.3,000 --> 0:03:12,000
(Laughter)

47
0:03:12.405,000 --> 0:03:14,000
Knowing these 1,168 words certainly is a game changer.

48
0:03:15.283,000 --> 0:03:16,000
(Laughter)

49
0:03:16.851,000 --> 0:03:19,000
Sometimes I produce code to quickly generate graphics

50
0:03:20.464,000 --> 0:03:21,000
from thousands of data points.

51
0:03:23.659,000 --> 0:03:26,000
Coding also enables me to produce interactive graphics.

52
0:03:26.778,000 --> 0:03:29,000
Now we can navigate information on our own terms.

53
0:03:32.064,000 --> 0:03:34,000
Exotic chart forms certainly look cool,

54
0:03:34.334,000 --> 0:03:36,000
but something as simple as a little dot may be all you need

55
0:03:37.235,000 --> 0:03:39,000
to solve a particular thinking task.

56
0:03:41.713,000 --> 0:03:45,000
In 2006, the "New York Times" redesigned their "Markets" section,

57
0:03:45.807,000 --> 0:03:47,000
cutting it down from eight pages of stock listings

58
0:03:48.278,000 --> 0:03:5,000
to just one and a half pages of essential market data.

59
0:03:52.313,000 --> 0:03:54,000
We listed performance metrics for the most common stocks,

60
0:03:55.326,000 --> 0:03:58,000
but I wanted to help investors see how the stocks are doing.

61
0:03:59.106,000 --> 0:04:01,000
So I added a simple little dot

62
0:04:01.85,000 --> 0:04:04,000
to show the current price relative to its one-year range.

63
0:04:06.505,000 --> 0:04:09,000
At a glance, value investors can pick out stocks trading near their lows

64
0:04:10.436,000 --> 0:04:11,000
by looking for dots to the left.

65
0:04:12.951,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Momentum investors can find stocks on an upward trajectory

66
0:04:16.442,000 --> 0:04:17,000
via dots to the right.

67
0:04:18.354,000 --> 0:04:2,000
Shortly after, the "Wall Street Journal" copied the design.

68
0:04:21.93,000 --> 0:04:23,000
Simplicity is often the goal for most graphics,

69
0:04:24.363,000 --> 0:04:26,000
but sometimes we need to embrace complexity

70
0:04:27.126,000 --> 0:04:3,000
and show large data sets in their full glory.

71
0:04:32.897,000 --> 0:04:35,000
Alec Gallup, the former chairman of the Gallup Organization,

72
0:04:36.073,000 --> 0:04:37,000
once handed me a very thick book.

73
0:04:38.084,000 --> 0:04:39,000
It was his family's legacy:

74
0:04:39.41,000 --> 0:04:43,000
hundreds of pages covering six decades of presidential approval data.

75
0:04:44.17,000 --> 0:04:46,000
I told him the entire book could be graphed on a single page.

76
0:04:47.118,000 --> 0:04:48,000
"Impossible," he said.

77
0:04:50.992,000 --> 0:04:51,000
And here it is:

78
0:04:52.18,000 --> 0:04:54,000
25,000 data points on a single page.

79
0:04:55.016,000 --> 0:04:58,000
At a glance, one sees that most presidents start with a high approval rating,

80
0:04:58.806,000 --> 0:04:59,000
but few keep it.

81
0:05:00.243,000 --> 0:05:02,000
Events like wars initially boost approval;

82
0:05:02.522,000 --> 0:05:03,000
scandals trigger declines.

83
0:05:05.09,000 --> 0:05:08,000
These major events were annotated in the graphic but not in the book.

84
0:05:09.315,000 --> 0:05:12,000
The point is, graphics can transmit data with incredible efficiency.

85
0:05:16.233,000 --> 0:05:17,000
Graphicacy --

86
0:05:17.446,000 --> 0:05:19,000
the ability to read and write graphics --

87
0:05:19.855,000 --> 0:05:2,000
is still in its infancy.

88
0:05:21.476,000 --> 0:05:25,000
New chart forms will emerge and specialized dialects will evolve.

89
0:05:25.876,000 --> 0:05:26,000
Graphics that help us think faster

90
0:05:27.594,000 --> 0:05:3,000
or see a book's worth of information on a single page

91
0:05:30.933,000 --> 0:05:33,000
are the key to unlocking new discoveries.

92
0:05:35.134,000 --> 0:05:38,000
Our visual cortex was built to decode complex information

93
0:05:38.836,000 --> 0:05:4,000
and is a master at pattern recognition.

94
0:05:41.44,000 --> 0:05:44,000
Graphicacy enables us to harness our built-in GPU

95
0:05:44.9,000 --> 0:05:45,000
to process mountains of data

96
0:05:46.584,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and find the veins of gold hiding within.

97
0:05:49.204,000 --> 0:05:5,000
Thank you.

98
0:05:50.378,000 --> 0:05:52,000
(Applause and cheers)

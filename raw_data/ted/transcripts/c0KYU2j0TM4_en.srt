1
0:00:15.26,000 --> 0:00:16,000
When I was nine years old,

2
0:00:17.26,000 --> 0:00:19,000
I went off to summer camp for the first time.

3
0:00:19.427,000 --> 0:00:22,000
And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books,

4
0:00:23.26,000 --> 0:00:25,000
which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do.

5
0:00:25.951,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Because in my family, reading was the primary group activity.

6
0:00:30.26,000 --> 0:00:31,000
And this might sound antisocial to you,

7
0:00:32.26,000 --> 0:00:34,000
but for us it was really just a different way of being social.

8
0:00:35.26,000 --> 0:00:38,000
You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you,

9
0:00:39.26,000 --> 0:00:41,000
but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland

10
0:00:42.142,000 --> 0:00:43,000
inside your own mind.

11
0:00:43.26,000 --> 0:00:44,000
And I had this idea

12
0:00:45.26,000 --> 0:00:47,000
that camp was going to be just like this, but better.

13
0:00:47.808,000 --> 0:00:49,000
(Laughter)

14
0:00:50.26,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin

15
0:00:53.26,000 --> 0:00:55,000
cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns.

16
0:00:55.665,000 --> 0:00:56,000
(Laughter)

17
0:00:57.26,000 --> 0:00:59,000
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol.

18
0:01:00.26,000 --> 0:01:02,000
And on the very first day,

19
0:01:03.26,000 --> 0:01:04,000
our counselor gathered us all together

20
0:01:05.26,000 --> 0:01:07,000
and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing

21
0:01:07.96,000 --> 0:01:1,000
every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit.

22
0:01:11.26,000 --> 0:01:12,000
And it went like this:

23
0:01:13.26,000 --> 0:01:14,000
"R-O-W-D-I-E,

24
0:01:15.26,000 --> 0:01:16,000
that's the way we spell rowdie.

25
0:01:17.26,000 --> 0:01:2,000
Rowdie, rowdie, let's get rowdie."

26
0:01:20.677,000 --> 0:01:21,000
(Laughter)

27
0:01:22.26,000 --> 0:01:23,000
Yeah.

28
0:01:24.26,000 --> 0:01:26,000
So I couldn't figure out for the life of me

29
0:01:26.332,000 --> 0:01:27,000
why we were supposed to be so rowdy,

30
0:01:28.26,000 --> 0:01:3,000
or why we had to spell this word incorrectly.

31
0:01:31.26,000 --> 0:01:36,000
(Laughter)

32
0:01:37.26,000 --> 0:01:4,000
But I recited a cheer. I recited a cheer along with everybody else.

33
0:01:40.475,000 --> 0:01:41,000
I did my best.

34
0:01:42.26,000 --> 0:01:46,000
And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books.

35
0:01:47.82,000 --> 0:01:49,000
But the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase,

36
0:01:50.644,000 --> 0:01:52,000
the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me

37
0:01:52.684,000 --> 0:01:54,000
and she asked me, "Why are you being so mellow?" --

38
0:01:55.16,000 --> 0:01:57,000
mellow, of course, being the exact opposite

39
0:01:57.232,000 --> 0:01:58,000
of R-O-W-D-I-E.

40
0:01:59.159,000 --> 0:02:,000
And then the second time I tried it,

41
0:02:01.06,000 --> 0:02:04,000
the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face

42
0:02:04.26,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and she repeated the point about camp spirit

43
0:02:06.38,000 --> 0:02:09,000
and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing.

44
0:02:09.614,000 --> 0:02:11,000
And so I put my books away,

45
0:02:12.26,000 --> 0:02:14,000
back in their suitcase,

46
0:02:15.26,000 --> 0:02:18,000
and I put them under my bed,

47
0:02:19.26,000 --> 0:02:21,000
and there they stayed for the rest of the summer.

48
0:02:21.66,000 --> 0:02:22,000
And I felt kind of guilty about this.

49
0:02:23.46,000 --> 0:02:24,000
I felt as if the books needed me somehow,

50
0:02:25.46,000 --> 0:02:27,000
and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them.

51
0:02:28.26,000 --> 0:02:3,000
But I did forsake them and I didn't open that suitcase again

52
0:02:31.16,000 --> 0:02:34,000
until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer.

53
0:02:34.26,000 --> 0:02:36,000
Now, I tell you this story about summer camp.

54
0:02:37.26,000 --> 0:02:39,000
I could have told you 50 others just like it --

55
0:02:40.26,000 --> 0:02:41,000
all the times that I got the message

56
0:02:42.26,000 --> 0:02:45,000
that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being

57
0:02:46.26,000 --> 0:02:47,000
was not necessarily the right way to go,

58
0:02:48.26,000 --> 0:02:5,000
that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert.

59
0:02:51.26,000 --> 0:02:53,000
And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong

60
0:02:54.26,000 --> 0:02:56,000
and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were.

61
0:02:57.142,000 --> 0:02:59,000
But for years I denied this intuition,

62
0:02:59.26,000 --> 0:03:01,000
and so I became a Wall Street lawyer, of all things,

63
0:03:02.26,000 --> 0:03:04,000
instead of the writer that I had always longed to be --

64
0:03:05.26,000 --> 0:03:08,000
partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too.

65
0:03:09.26,000 --> 0:03:11,000
And I was always going off to crowded bars

66
0:03:11.361,000 --> 0:03:14,000
when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends.

67
0:03:14.957,000 --> 0:03:18,000
And I made these self-negating choices so reflexively,

68
0:03:19.26,000 --> 0:03:21,000
that I wasn't even aware that I was making them.

69
0:03:22.757,000 --> 0:03:23,000
Now this is what many introverts do,

70
0:03:24.56,000 --> 0:03:25,000
and it's our loss for sure,

71
0:03:26.26,000 --> 0:03:27,000
but it is also our colleagues' loss

72
0:03:28.26,000 --> 0:03:29,000
and our communities' loss.

73
0:03:30.26,000 --> 0:03:32,000
And at the risk of sounding grandiose, it is the world's loss.

74
0:03:33.26,000 --> 0:03:35,000
Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership,

75
0:03:36.26,000 --> 0:03:38,000
we need introverts doing what they do best.

76
0:03:39.26,000 --> 0:03:41,000
A third to a half of the population are introverts --

77
0:03:41.808,000 --> 0:03:42,000
a third to a half.

78
0:03:43.26,000 --> 0:03:45,000
So that's one out of every two or three people you know.

79
0:03:46.26,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So even if you're an extrovert yourself,

80
0:03:49.26,000 --> 0:03:5,000
I'm talking about your coworkers

81
0:03:51.26,000 --> 0:03:52,000
and your spouses and your children

82
0:03:53.26,000 --> 0:03:55,000
and the person sitting next to you right now --

83
0:03:56.26,000 --> 0:03:57,000
all of them subject to this bias

84
0:03:58.26,000 --> 0:04:,000
that is pretty deep and real in our society.

85
0:04:00.38,000 --> 0:04:02,000
We all internalize it from a very early age

86
0:04:03.26,000 --> 0:04:05,000
without even having a language for what we're doing.

87
0:04:06.26,000 --> 0:04:07,000
Now, to see the bias clearly,

88
0:04:08.26,000 --> 0:04:1,000
you need to understand what introversion is.

89
0:04:11.26,000 --> 0:04:12,000
It's different from being shy.

90
0:04:13.26,000 --> 0:04:14,000
Shyness is about fear of social judgment.

91
0:04:15.26,000 --> 0:04:16,000
Introversion is more about,

92
0:04:17.26,000 --> 0:04:18,000
how do you respond to stimulation,

93
0:04:19.26,000 --> 0:04:2,000
including social stimulation.

94
0:04:21.26,000 --> 0:04:23,000
So extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation,

95
0:04:24.26,000 --> 0:04:26,000
whereas introverts feel at their most alive

96
0:04:26.361,000 --> 0:04:28,000
and their most switched-on and their most capable

97
0:04:28.761,000 --> 0:04:3,000
when they're in quieter, more low-key environments.

98
0:04:31.19,000 --> 0:04:33,000
Not all the time -- these things aren't absolute --

99
0:04:33.643,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but a lot of the time.

100
0:04:34.86,000 --> 0:04:38,000
So the key then to maximizing our talents

101
0:04:39.26,000 --> 0:04:4,000
is for us all to put ourselves

102
0:04:41.26,000 --> 0:04:43,000
in the zone of stimulation that is right for us.

103
0:04:44.26,000 --> 0:04:45,000
But now here's where the bias comes in.

104
0:04:46.26,000 --> 0:04:47,000
Our most important institutions,

105
0:04:48.26,000 --> 0:04:49,000
our schools and our workplaces,

106
0:04:50.26,000 --> 0:04:51,000
they are designed mostly for extroverts

107
0:04:52.26,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and for extroverts' need for lots of stimulation.

108
0:04:55.26,000 --> 0:04:58,000
And also we have this belief system right now

109
0:04:59.26,000 --> 0:05:,000
that I call the new groupthink,

110
0:05:01.26,000 --> 0:05:03,000
which holds that all creativity and all productivity

111
0:05:04.26,000 --> 0:05:08,000
comes from a very oddly gregarious place.

112
0:05:09.26,000 --> 0:05:11,000
So if you picture the typical classroom nowadays:

113
0:05:11.618,000 --> 0:05:14,000
When I was going to school, we sat in rows.

114
0:05:15.26,000 --> 0:05:16,000
We sat in rows of desks like this,

115
0:05:17.26,000 --> 0:05:19,000
and we did most of our work pretty autonomously.

116
0:05:19.547,000 --> 0:05:22,000
But nowadays, your typical classroom has pods of desks --

117
0:05:23.26,000 --> 0:05:25,000
four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other.

118
0:05:26.26,000 --> 0:05:28,000
And kids are working in countless group assignments.

119
0:05:28.761,000 --> 0:05:3,000
Even in subjects like math and creative writing,

120
0:05:31.26,000 --> 0:05:33,000
which you think would depend on solo flights of thought,

121
0:05:34.26,000 --> 0:05:37,000
kids are now expected to act as committee members.

122
0:05:38.26,000 --> 0:05:42,000
And for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone,

123
0:05:42.475,000 --> 0:05:43,000
those kids are seen as outliers often

124
0:05:44.36,000 --> 0:05:45,000
or, worse, as problem cases.

125
0:05:49.006,000 --> 0:05:5,000
And the vast majority of teachers

126
0:05:50.906,000 --> 0:05:52,000
reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert

127
0:05:53.66,000 --> 0:05:54,000
as opposed to an introvert,

128
0:05:55.26,000 --> 0:05:57,000
even though introverts actually get better grades

129
0:05:57.618,000 --> 0:05:58,000
and are more knowledgeable,

130
0:05:59.26,000 --> 0:06:,000
according to research.

131
0:06:01.26,000 --> 0:06:02,000
(Laughter)

132
0:06:03.26,000 --> 0:06:05,000
Okay, same thing is true in our workplaces.

133
0:06:06.26,000 --> 0:06:08,000
Now, most of us work in open plan offices,

134
0:06:09.26,000 --> 0:06:1,000
without walls,

135
0:06:11.26,000 --> 0:06:15,000
where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers.

136
0:06:15.57,000 --> 0:06:16,000
And when it comes to leadership,

137
0:06:17.26,000 --> 0:06:19,000
introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions,

138
0:06:20.26,000 --> 0:06:22,000
even though introverts tend to be very careful,

139
0:06:22.5,000 --> 0:06:23,000
much less likely to take outsize risks --

140
0:06:24.5,000 --> 0:06:26,000
which is something we might all favor nowadays.

141
0:06:27.26,000 --> 0:06:29,000
And interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School

142
0:06:30.26,000 --> 0:06:31,000
has found that introverted leaders

143
0:06:32.26,000 --> 0:06:34,000
often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do,

144
0:06:34.618,000 --> 0:06:36,000
because when they are managing proactive employees,

145
0:06:37.26,000 --> 0:06:4,000
they're much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas,

146
0:06:40.547,000 --> 0:06:42,000
whereas an extrovert can, quite unwittingly,

147
0:06:42.667,000 --> 0:06:43,000
get so excited about things

148
0:06:44.26,000 --> 0:06:46,000
that they're putting their own stamp on things,

149
0:06:46.5,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and other people's ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface.

150
0:06:51.26,000 --> 0:06:54,000
Now in fact, some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts.

151
0:06:55.06,000 --> 0:06:56,000
I'll give you some examples.

152
0:06:56.46,000 --> 0:06:58,000
Eleanor Roosevelt, Rosa Parks, Gandhi --

153
0:06:59.26,000 --> 0:07:03,000
all these people described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy.

154
0:07:04.26,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And they all took the spotlight,

155
0:07:06.26,000 --> 0:07:1,000
even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to.

156
0:07:11.529,000 --> 0:07:13,000
And this turns out to have a special power all its own,

157
0:07:14.16,000 --> 0:07:16,000
because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm

158
0:07:17.16,000 --> 0:07:18,000
not because they enjoyed directing others

159
0:07:19.16,000 --> 0:07:21,000
and not out of the pleasure of being looked at;

160
0:07:21.46,000 --> 0:07:23,000
they were there because they had no choice,

161
0:07:23.532,000 --> 0:07:26,000
because they were driven to do what they thought was right.

162
0:07:26.728,000 --> 0:07:28,000
Now I think at this point it's important for me to say

163
0:07:29.36,000 --> 0:07:31,000
that I actually love extroverts.

164
0:07:32.26,000 --> 0:07:34,000
I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts,

165
0:07:35.26,000 --> 0:07:37,000
including my beloved husband.

166
0:07:39.26,000 --> 0:07:41,000
And we all fall at different points, of course,

167
0:07:41.523,000 --> 0:07:43,000
along the introvert/extrovert spectrum.

168
0:07:44.26,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Even Carl Jung, the psychologist who first popularized these terms,

169
0:07:47.69,000 --> 0:07:49,000
said that there's no such thing as a pure introvert

170
0:07:50.105,000 --> 0:07:51,000
or a pure extrovert.

171
0:07:51.46,000 --> 0:07:53,000
He said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum,

172
0:07:54.008,000 --> 0:07:56,000
if he existed at all.

173
0:07:56.26,000 --> 0:07:59,000
And some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert/extrovert spectrum,

174
0:08:00.26,000 --> 0:08:01,000
and we call these people ambiverts.

175
0:08:02.26,000 --> 0:08:05,000
And I often think that they have the best of all worlds.

176
0:08:06.259,000 --> 0:08:08,000
But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other.

177
0:08:09.26,000 --> 0:08:12,000
And what I'm saying is that culturally, we need a much better balance.

178
0:08:12.57,000 --> 0:08:15,000
We need more of a yin and yang between these two types.

179
0:08:16.26,000 --> 0:08:17,000
This is especially important

180
0:08:18.26,000 --> 0:08:2,000
when it comes to creativity and to productivity,

181
0:08:20.57,000 --> 0:08:23,000
because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people,

182
0:08:24.26,000 --> 0:08:25,000
what they find

183
0:08:26.26,000 --> 0:08:28,000
are people who are very good at exchanging ideas

184
0:08:28.57,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and advancing ideas,

185
0:08:30.26,000 --> 0:08:32,000
but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them.

186
0:08:33.26,000 --> 0:08:35,000
And this is because solitude

187
0:08:35.513,000 --> 0:08:37,000
is a crucial ingredient often to creativity.

188
0:08:37.66,000 --> 0:08:38,000
So Darwin,

189
0:08:39.26,000 --> 0:08:4,000
he took long walks alone in the woods

190
0:08:41.26,000 --> 0:08:43,000
and emphatically turned down dinner-party invitations.

191
0:08:44.26,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Theodor Geisel, better known as Dr. Seuss,

192
0:08:47.26,000 --> 0:08:49,000
he dreamed up many of his amazing creations

193
0:08:49.309,000 --> 0:08:5,000
in a lonely bell tower office that he had

194
0:08:51.309,000 --> 0:08:53,000
in the back of his house in La Jolla, California.

195
0:08:54.26,000 --> 0:08:57,000
And he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books

196
0:08:58.26,000 --> 0:09:02,000
for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure

197
0:09:02.284,000 --> 0:09:05,000
and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona.

198
0:09:06.26,000 --> 0:09:08,000
Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer

199
0:09:08.523,000 --> 0:09:1,000
sitting alone in his cubicle in Hewlett-Packard

200
0:09:11.544,000 --> 0:09:12,000
where he was working at the time.

201
0:09:13.205,000 --> 0:09:16,000
And he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place

202
0:09:16.904,000 --> 0:09:18,000
had he not been too introverted to leave the house

203
0:09:19.36,000 --> 0:09:2,000
when he was growing up.

204
0:09:21.068,000 --> 0:09:23,000
Now, of course,

205
0:09:23.26,000 --> 0:09:25,000
this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating --

206
0:09:26.26,000 --> 0:09:29,000
and case in point, is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs

207
0:09:29.904,000 --> 0:09:31,000
to start Apple Computer --

208
0:09:32.26,000 --> 0:09:34,000
but it does mean that solitude matters

209
0:09:35.26,000 --> 0:09:38,000
and that for some people it is the air that they breathe.

210
0:09:39.26,000 --> 0:09:44,000
And in fact, we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude.

211
0:09:45.26,000 --> 0:09:47,000
It's only recently that we've strangely begun to forget it.

212
0:09:48.26,000 --> 0:09:5,000
If you look at most of the world's major religions,

213
0:09:51.26,000 --> 0:09:52,000
you will find seekers --

214
0:09:53.26,000 --> 0:09:55,000
Moses, Jesus, Buddha, Muhammad --

215
0:09:56.26,000 --> 0:09:59,000
seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness,

216
0:10:00.26,000 --> 0:10:02,000
where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations

217
0:10:02.96,000 --> 0:10:04,000
that they then bring back to the rest of the community.

218
0:10:05.66,000 --> 0:10:08,000
So, no wilderness, no revelations.

219
0:10:09.26,000 --> 0:10:1,000
This is no surprise, though,

220
0:10:11.26,000 --> 0:10:13,000
if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology.

221
0:10:14.26,000 --> 0:10:16,000
It turns out that we can't even be in a group of people

222
0:10:17.26,000 --> 0:10:19,000
without instinctively mirroring, mimicking their opinions.

223
0:10:20.26,000 --> 0:10:22,000
Even about seemingly personal and visceral things

224
0:10:22.618,000 --> 0:10:23,000
like who you're attracted to,

225
0:10:24.26,000 --> 0:10:26,000
you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you

226
0:10:27.26,000 --> 0:10:29,000
without even realizing that that's what you're doing.

227
0:10:29.808,000 --> 0:10:31,000
And groups famously follow the opinions

228
0:10:32.26,000 --> 0:10:34,000
of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room,

229
0:10:34.96,000 --> 0:10:35,000
even though there's zero correlation

230
0:10:36.76,000 --> 0:10:38,000
between being the best talker and having the best ideas --

231
0:10:39.56,000 --> 0:10:4,000
I mean zero.

232
0:10:41.26,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So --

233
0:10:43.26,000 --> 0:10:44,000
(Laughter)

234
0:10:45.26,000 --> 0:10:47,000
You might be following the person with the best ideas,

235
0:10:48.26,000 --> 0:10:49,000
but you might not.

236
0:10:50.26,000 --> 0:10:52,000
And do you really want to leave it up to chance?

237
0:10:53.26,000 --> 0:10:55,000
Much better for everybody to go off by themselves,

238
0:10:55.665,000 --> 0:10:56,000
generate their own ideas

239
0:10:57.26,000 --> 0:10:59,000
freed from the distortions of group dynamics,

240
0:10:59.427,000 --> 0:11:,000
and then come together as a team

241
0:11:01.26,000 --> 0:11:03,000
to talk them through in a well-managed environment

242
0:11:04.26,000 --> 0:11:05,000
and take it from there.

243
0:11:06.26,000 --> 0:11:07,000
Now if all this is true,

244
0:11:08.26,000 --> 0:11:1,000
then why are we getting it so wrong?

245
0:11:11.26,000 --> 0:11:13,000
Why are we setting up our schools this way, and our workplaces?

246
0:11:14.26,000 --> 0:11:16,000
And why are we making these introverts feel so guilty

247
0:11:16.808,000 --> 0:11:18,000
about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time?

248
0:11:19.76,000 --> 0:11:21,000
One answer lies deep in our cultural history.

249
0:11:22.26,000 --> 0:11:23,000
Western societies,

250
0:11:24.26,000 --> 0:11:25,000
and in particular the U.S.,

251
0:11:26.26,000 --> 0:11:32,000
have always favored the man of action over the "man" of contemplation.

252
0:11:34.26,000 --> 0:11:36,000
But in America's early days,

253
0:11:37.26,000 --> 0:11:39,000
we lived in what historians call a culture of character,

254
0:11:40.26,000 --> 0:11:42,000
where we still, at that point, valued people

255
0:11:42.38,000 --> 0:11:44,000
for their inner selves and their moral rectitude.

256
0:11:45.26,000 --> 0:11:47,000
And if you look at the self-help books from this era,

257
0:11:47.86,000 --> 0:11:48,000
they all had titles with things like

258
0:11:49.66,000 --> 0:11:51,000
"Character, the Grandest Thing in the World."

259
0:11:52.26,000 --> 0:11:54,000
And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln,

260
0:11:55.26,000 --> 0:11:57,000
who was praised for being modest and unassuming.

261
0:11:57.57,000 --> 0:11:58,000
Ralph Waldo Emerson called him

262
0:11:59.26,000 --> 0:12:01,000
"A man who does not offend by superiority."

263
0:12:02.26,000 --> 0:12:04,000
But then we hit the 20th century,

264
0:12:05.26,000 --> 0:12:06,000
and we entered a new culture

265
0:12:07.26,000 --> 0:12:09,000
that historians call the culture of personality.

266
0:12:09.547,000 --> 0:12:11,000
What happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy

267
0:12:12.247,000 --> 0:12:13,000
to a world of big business.

268
0:12:13.66,000 --> 0:12:16,000
And so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities.

269
0:12:17.26,000 --> 0:12:2,000
And instead of working alongside people they've known all their lives,

270
0:12:20.595,000 --> 0:12:23,000
now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers.

271
0:12:24.26,000 --> 0:12:25,000
So, quite understandably,

272
0:12:26.26,000 --> 0:12:29,000
qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important.

273
0:12:30.26,000 --> 0:12:33,000
And sure enough, the self-help books change to meet these new needs

274
0:12:33.475,000 --> 0:12:34,000
and they start to have names

275
0:12:35.26,000 --> 0:12:37,000
like "How to Win Friends and Influence People."

276
0:12:37.5,000 --> 0:12:41,000
And they feature as their role models really great salesmen.

277
0:12:42.26,000 --> 0:12:44,000
So that's the world we're living in today.

278
0:12:44.284,000 --> 0:12:47,000
That's our cultural inheritance.

279
0:12:48.26,000 --> 0:12:52,000
Now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant,

280
0:12:53.26,000 --> 0:12:57,000
and I'm also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all.

281
0:12:58.26,000 --> 0:13:01,000
The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops

282
0:13:01.475,000 --> 0:13:03,000
also teach us love and trust.

283
0:13:04.26,000 --> 0:13:05,000
And the problems that we are facing today

284
0:13:06.26,000 --> 0:13:07,000
in fields like science and in economics

285
0:13:08.26,000 --> 0:13:09,000
are so vast and so complex

286
0:13:10.26,000 --> 0:13:12,000
that we are going to need armies of people coming together

287
0:13:13.06,000 --> 0:13:14,000
to solve them working together.

288
0:13:14.66,000 --> 0:13:17,000
But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves,

289
0:13:18.46,000 --> 0:13:19,000
the more likely that they are

290
0:13:19.96,000 --> 0:13:22,000
to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems.

291
0:13:24.26,000 --> 0:13:29,000
So now I'd like to share with you what's in my suitcase today.

292
0:13:33.26,000 --> 0:13:34,000
Guess what?

293
0:13:35.26,000 --> 0:13:36,000
Books.

294
0:13:37.26,000 --> 0:13:38,000
I have a suitcase full of books.

295
0:13:39.26,000 --> 0:13:4,000
Here's Margaret Atwood, "Cat's Eye."

296
0:13:41.26,000 --> 0:13:43,000
Here's a novel by Milan Kundera.

297
0:13:44.26,000 --> 0:13:48,000
And here's "The Guide for the Perplexed" by Maimonides.

298
0:13:49.26,000 --> 0:13:51,000
But these are not exactly my books.

299
0:13:52.26,000 --> 0:13:53,000
I brought these books with me

300
0:13:54.26,000 --> 0:13:57,000
because they were written by my grandfather's favorite authors.

301
0:13:58.26,000 --> 0:13:59,000
My grandfather was a rabbi

302
0:14:00.26,000 --> 0:14:01,000
and he was a widower

303
0:14:02.26,000 --> 0:14:04,000
who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn

304
0:14:05.26,000 --> 0:14:07,000
that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up,

305
0:14:08.26,000 --> 0:14:11,000
partly because it was filled with his very gentle, very courtly presence

306
0:14:11.713,000 --> 0:14:13,000
and partly because it was filled with books.

307
0:14:14.26,000 --> 0:14:16,000
I mean literally every table, every chair in this apartment

308
0:14:17.26,000 --> 0:14:18,000
had yielded its original function

309
0:14:19.26,000 --> 0:14:21,000
to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books.

310
0:14:22.26,000 --> 0:14:23,000
Just like the rest of my family,

311
0:14:24.26,000 --> 0:14:27,000
my grandfather's favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read.

312
0:14:27.57,000 --> 0:14:29,000
But he also loved his congregation,

313
0:14:30.26,000 --> 0:14:32,000
and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave

314
0:14:33.26,000 --> 0:14:36,000
every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi.

315
0:14:37.26,000 --> 0:14:39,000
He would takes the fruits of each week's reading

316
0:14:40.26,000 --> 0:14:41,000
and he would weave

317
0:14:41.596,000 --> 0:14:43,000
these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought.

318
0:14:44.461,000 --> 0:14:46,000
And people would come from all over to hear him speak.

319
0:14:47.963,000 --> 0:14:49,000
But here's the thing about my grandfather.

320
0:14:51.327,000 --> 0:14:52,000
Underneath this ceremonial role,

321
0:14:52.96,000 --> 0:14:54,000
he was really modest and really introverted --

322
0:14:55.26,000 --> 0:14:57,000
so much so that when he delivered these sermons,

323
0:14:58.26,000 --> 0:14:59,000
he had trouble making eye contact

324
0:15:00.26,000 --> 0:15:04,000
with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years.

325
0:15:04.284,000 --> 0:15:05,000
And even away from the podium,

326
0:15:06.26,000 --> 0:15:07,000
when you called him to say hello,

327
0:15:08.26,000 --> 0:15:1,000
he would often end the conversation prematurely

328
0:15:10.523,000 --> 0:15:13,000
for fear that he was taking up too much of your time.

329
0:15:14.26,000 --> 0:15:16,000
But when he died at the age of 94,

330
0:15:17.26,000 --> 0:15:19,000
the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood

331
0:15:20.26,000 --> 0:15:23,000
to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him.

332
0:15:27.106,000 --> 0:15:3,000
And so these days I try to learn from my grandfather's example

333
0:15:30.16,000 --> 0:15:31,000
in my own way.

334
0:15:31.56,000 --> 0:15:33,000
So I just published a book about introversion,

335
0:15:34.26,000 --> 0:15:36,000
and it took me about seven years to write.

336
0:15:36.284,000 --> 0:15:38,000
And for me, that seven years was like total bliss,

337
0:15:39.26,000 --> 0:15:41,000
because I was reading, I was writing,

338
0:15:42.26,000 --> 0:15:43,000
I was thinking, I was researching.

339
0:15:44.26,000 --> 0:15:45,000
It was my version

340
0:15:46.26,000 --> 0:15:48,000
of my grandfather's hours of the day alone in his library.

341
0:15:49.26,000 --> 0:15:51,000
But now all of a sudden my job is very different,

342
0:15:52.26,000 --> 0:15:54,000
and my job is to be out here talking about it,

343
0:15:55.26,000 --> 0:15:57,000
talking about introversion.

344
0:15:58.26,000 --> 0:16:01,000
(Laughter)

345
0:16:02.26,000 --> 0:16:03,000
And that's a lot harder for me,

346
0:16:04.26,000 --> 0:16:07,000
because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now,

347
0:16:08.26,000 --> 0:16:1,000
this is not my natural milieu.

348
0:16:11.26,000 --> 0:16:14,000
So I prepared for moments like these as best I could.

349
0:16:15.26,000 --> 0:16:17,000
I spent the last year practicing public speaking

350
0:16:17.57,000 --> 0:16:18,000
every chance I could get.

351
0:16:19.26,000 --> 0:16:21,000
And I call this my "year of speaking dangerously."

352
0:16:22.26,000 --> 0:16:23,000
(Laughter)

353
0:16:24.26,000 --> 0:16:25,000
And that actually helped a lot.

354
0:16:26.26,000 --> 0:16:27,000
But I'll tell you, what helps even more

355
0:16:28.26,000 --> 0:16:32,000
is my sense, my belief, my hope that when it comes to our attitudes

356
0:16:33.26,000 --> 0:16:35,000
to introversion and to quiet and to solitude,

357
0:16:35.404,000 --> 0:16:37,000
we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change.

358
0:16:37.905,000 --> 0:16:38,000
I mean, we are.

359
0:16:39.26,000 --> 0:16:4,000
And so I am going to leave you now

360
0:16:41.26,000 --> 0:16:44,000
with three calls for action for those who share this vision.

361
0:16:45.26,000 --> 0:16:46,000
Number one:

362
0:16:47.26,000 --> 0:16:48,000
Stop the madness for constant group work.

363
0:16:49.26,000 --> 0:16:5,000
Just stop it.

364
0:16:51.26,000 --> 0:16:53,000
(Laughter)

365
0:16:54.26,000 --> 0:16:55,000
Thank you.

366
0:16:56.26,000 --> 0:16:57,000
(Applause)

367
0:16:58.26,000 --> 0:17:,000
And I want to be clear about what I'm saying,

368
0:17:00.427,000 --> 0:17:01,000
because I deeply believe our offices

369
0:17:02.26,000 --> 0:17:05,000
should be encouraging casual, chatty cafe-style types of interactions --

370
0:17:06.26,000 --> 0:17:08,000
you know, the kind where people come together

371
0:17:08.404,000 --> 0:17:1,000
and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas.

372
0:17:10.619,000 --> 0:17:11,000
That is great.

373
0:17:12.26,000 --> 0:17:14,000
It's great for introverts and it's great for extroverts.

374
0:17:14.96,000 --> 0:17:16,000
But we need much more privacy and much more freedom

375
0:17:17.413,000 --> 0:17:18,000
and much more autonomy at work.

376
0:17:18.96,000 --> 0:17:19,000
School, same thing.

377
0:17:20.26,000 --> 0:17:22,000
We need to be teaching kids to work together, for sure,

378
0:17:23.26,000 --> 0:17:25,000
but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own.

379
0:17:26.26,000 --> 0:17:28,000
This is especially important for extroverted children too.

380
0:17:29.06,000 --> 0:17:3,000
They need to work on their own

381
0:17:30.56,000 --> 0:17:32,000
because that is where deep thought comes from in part.

382
0:17:33.156,000 --> 0:17:35,000
Okay, number two: Go to the wilderness.

383
0:17:35.26,000 --> 0:17:37,000
Be like Buddha, have your own revelations.

384
0:17:38.26,000 --> 0:17:39,000
I'm not saying

385
0:17:40.26,000 --> 0:17:43,000
that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods

386
0:17:43.523,000 --> 0:17:45,000
and never talk to each other again,

387
0:17:46.26,000 --> 0:17:48,000
but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug

388
0:17:48.618,000 --> 0:17:52,000
and get inside our own heads a little more often.

389
0:17:54.26,000 --> 0:17:56,000
Number three:

390
0:17:57.26,000 --> 0:17:59,000
Take a good look at what's inside your own suitcase

391
0:17:59.713,000 --> 0:18:,000
and why you put it there.

392
0:18:01.26,000 --> 0:18:02,000
So extroverts,

393
0:18:03.26,000 --> 0:18:05,000
maybe your suitcases are also full of books.

394
0:18:05.357,000 --> 0:18:09,000
Or maybe they're full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment.

395
0:18:10.26,000 --> 0:18:13,000
Whatever it is, I hope you take these things out every chance you get

396
0:18:14.26,000 --> 0:18:16,000
and grace us with your energy and your joy.

397
0:18:17.26,000 --> 0:18:19,000
But introverts, you being you,

398
0:18:20.26,000 --> 0:18:22,000
you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully

399
0:18:22.838,000 --> 0:18:23,000
what's inside your own suitcase.

400
0:18:24.738,000 --> 0:18:25,000
And that's okay.

401
0:18:26.26,000 --> 0:18:27,000
But occasionally, just occasionally,

402
0:18:28.26,000 --> 0:18:31,000
I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see,

403
0:18:31.284,000 --> 0:18:34,000
because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry.

404
0:18:36.26,000 --> 0:18:38,000
So I wish you the best of all possible journeys

405
0:18:38.523,000 --> 0:18:4,000
and the courage to speak softly.

406
0:18:41.26,000 --> 0:18:42,000
Thank you very much.

407
0:18:43.26,000 --> 0:18:46,000
(Applause)

408
0:18:47.26,000 --> 0:18:49,000
Thank you. Thank you.

409
0:18:50.26,000 --> 0:18:57,000
(Applause)

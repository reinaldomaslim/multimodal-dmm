0:00:12.16,000 --> 0:00:16,000
Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC.

2
0:00:16.16,000 --> 0:00:18,000
And I promised to come back and give you an update

3
0:00:18.16,000 --> 0:00:2,000
on how that machine worked.

4
0:00:20.16,000 --> 0:00:22,000
So this is it. And for those of you that weren't there,

5
0:00:22.16,000 --> 0:00:25,000
the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted --

6
0:00:25.16,000 --> 0:00:27,000
27 kilometers in circumference.

7
0:00:27.16,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Its job is to recreate the conditions

8
0:00:29.16,000 --> 0:00:32,000
that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began,

9
0:00:32.16,000 --> 0:00:35,000
up to 600 million times a second.

10
0:00:35.16,000 --> 0:00:37,000
It's nothing if not ambitious.

11
0:00:37.16,000 --> 0:00:39,000
This is the machine below Geneva.

12
0:00:39.16,000 --> 0:00:42,000
We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors.

13
0:00:42.16,000 --> 0:00:45,000
This is the one I work on. It's called the ATLAS detector --

14
0:00:45.16,000 --> 0:00:48,000
44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter.

15
0:00:48.16,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction

16
0:00:51.16,000 --> 0:00:53,000
so you can see the scale.

17
0:00:53.16,000 --> 0:00:56,000
On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time.

18
0:00:56.16,000 --> 0:00:59,000
And this picture was taken by ATLAS.

19
0:00:59.16,000 --> 0:01:02,000
It caused immense celebration in the control room.

20
0:01:02.16,000 --> 0:01:04,000
It's a picture of the first beam particle

21
0:01:04.16,000 --> 0:01:06,000
going all the way around the LHC,

22
0:01:06.16,000 --> 0:01:09,000
colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately,

23
0:01:09.16,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and showering particles into the detector.

24
0:01:11.16,000 --> 0:01:13,000
In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th

25
0:01:13.16,000 --> 0:01:15,000
we knew the machine worked,

26
0:01:15.16,000 --> 0:01:17,000
which is a great triumph.

27
0:01:17.16,000 --> 0:01:19,000
I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer,

28
0:01:19.16,000 --> 0:01:21,000
or this, when someone went onto Google

29
0:01:21.16,000 --> 0:01:23,000
and saw the front page was like that.

30
0:01:23.16,000 --> 0:01:25,000
It means we made cultural impact

31
0:01:25.16,000 --> 0:01:27,000
as well as scientific impact.

32
0:01:27.16,000 --> 0:01:3,000
About a week later we had a problem with the machine,

33
0:01:30.16,000 --> 0:01:34,000
related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires.

34
0:01:34.16,000 --> 0:01:37,000
Those wires carry 13 thousand amps

35
0:01:37.16,000 --> 0:01:39,000
when the machine is working in full power.

36
0:01:39.16,000 --> 0:01:41,000
Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say,

37
0:01:41.16,000 --> 0:01:43,000
"No they don't. They're small wires."

38
0:01:43.16,000 --> 0:01:45,000
They can do that because

39
0:01:45.16,000 --> 0:01:47,000
when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire.

40
0:01:47.16,000 --> 0:01:5,000
So at minus 271 degrees,

41
0:01:50.16,000 --> 0:01:52,000
colder than the space between the stars,

42
0:01:52.16,000 --> 0:01:54,000
those wires can take that current.

43
0:01:54.16,000 --> 0:01:58,000
In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC,

44
0:01:58.16,000 --> 0:02:,000
there was a manufacturing defect.

45
0:02:00.16,000 --> 0:02:02,000
So the wire heated up slightly,

46
0:02:02.16,000 --> 0:02:06,000
and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.

47
0:02:06.16,000 --> 0:02:08,000
This was the result.

48
0:02:08.16,000 --> 0:02:11,000
Now that's more impressive

49
0:02:11.16,000 --> 0:02:13,000
when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons,

50
0:02:13.16,000 --> 0:02:15,000
and they moved about a foot.

51
0:02:15.16,000 --> 0:02:18,000
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.

52
0:02:18.16,000 --> 0:02:21,000
We had to take them out, which we did.

53
0:02:21.16,000 --> 0:02:23,000
We reconditioned them all, fixed them.

54
0:02:23.16,000 --> 0:02:25,000
They're all on their way back underground now.

55
0:02:25.16,000 --> 0:02:27,000
By the end of March the LHC will be intact again.

56
0:02:27.16,000 --> 0:02:29,000
We will switch it on,

57
0:02:29.16,000 --> 0:02:32,000
and we expect to take data in June or July,

58
0:02:32.16,000 --> 0:02:35,000
and continue with our quest to find out

59
0:02:35.16,000 --> 0:02:37,000
what the building blocks of the universe are.

60
0:02:37.16,000 --> 0:02:4,000
Now of course, in a way

61
0:02:40.16,000 --> 0:02:42,000
those accidents reignite the debate

62
0:02:42.16,000 --> 0:02:48,000
about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute.

63
0:02:48.16,000 --> 0:02:5,000
I think that the fact that it's so difficult,

64
0:02:50.16,000 --> 0:02:54,000
the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.

65
0:02:54.16,000 --> 0:02:58,000
I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy,

66
0:02:58.16,000 --> 0:03:,000
who, I suspect,

67
0:03:00.16,000 --> 0:03:03,000
when defending his protege's useless experiments --

68
0:03:03.16,000 --> 0:03:05,000
his protege was Michael Faraday --

69
0:03:05.16,000 --> 0:03:08,000
said this, "Nothing is so dangerous

70
0:03:08.16,000 --> 0:03:1,000
to the progress of the human mind

71
0:03:10.16,000 --> 0:03:14,000
than to assume that our views of science are ultimate,

72
0:03:14.16,000 --> 0:03:16,000
that there are no mysteries in nature,

73
0:03:16.16,000 --> 0:03:18,000
that our triumphs are complete, and that

74
0:03:18.16,000 --> 0:03:2,000
there are no new worlds to conquer."

75
0:03:20.16,000 --> 0:03:22,000
Thank you.

76
0:03:22.16,000 --> 0:03:24,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:12.581,000 --> 0:00:15,000
I'm a man who's trying to live from his heart,

2
0:00:16.289,000 --> 0:00:19,000
and so just before I get going,

3
0:00:19.354,000 --> 0:00:21,000
I wanted to tell you as a South African

4
0:00:21.925,000 --> 0:00:23,000
that one of the men who has inspired me most

5
0:00:24.909,000 --> 0:00:27,000
passed away a few hours ago.

6
0:00:27.975,000 --> 0:00:29,000
Nelson Mandela has come to the end

7
0:00:30.665,000 --> 0:00:32,000
of his long walk to freedom.

8
0:00:33.345,000 --> 0:00:37,000
And so this talk is going to be for him.

9
0:00:40.544,000 --> 0:00:42,000
I grew up in wonder.

10
0:00:43.354,000 --> 0:00:47,000
I grew up amongst those animals.

11
0:00:47.469,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I grew up in the wild eastern part of South Africa

12
0:00:51.86,000 --> 0:00:53,000
at a place called Londolozi Game Reserve.

13
0:00:54.758,000 --> 0:00:56,000
It's a place where my family has been

14
0:00:57.53,000 --> 0:01:01,000
in the safari business for four generations.

15
0:01:01.725,000 --> 0:01:03,000
Now for as long as I can remember,

16
0:01:03.962,000 --> 0:01:07,000
my job has been to take people out into nature,

17
0:01:08.699,000 --> 0:01:1,000
and so I think it's a lovely twist of fate today

18
0:01:11.61,000 --> 0:01:12,000
to have the opportunity

19
0:01:13.43,000 --> 0:01:15,000
to bring some of my experiences out in nature

20
0:01:16.311,000 --> 0:01:18,000
in to this gathering.

21
0:01:18.451,000 --> 0:01:19,000
Africa is a place

22
0:01:20.33,000 --> 0:01:23,000
where people still sit under starlit skies

23
0:01:23.714,000 --> 0:01:26,000
and around campfires and tell stories,

24
0:01:27.124,000 --> 0:01:29,000
and so what I have to share with you today

25
0:01:29.815,000 --> 0:01:33,000
is the simple medicine of a few campfire stories,

26
0:01:34.234,000 --> 0:01:37,000
stories about heroes of heart.

27
0:01:37.372,000 --> 0:01:39,000
Now my stories are not the stories

28
0:01:39.492,000 --> 0:01:4,000
that you'll hear on the news,

29
0:01:41.19,000 --> 0:01:43,000
and while it's true that Africa is a harsh place,

30
0:01:44.163,000 --> 0:01:45,000
I also know it to be a place

31
0:01:46.1,000 --> 0:01:5,000
where people, animals and ecosystems

32
0:01:50.366,000 --> 0:01:54,000
teach us about a more interconnected world.

33
0:01:54.753,000 --> 0:01:55,000
When I was nine years old,

34
0:01:56.731,000 --> 0:01:59,000
President Mandela came to stay with my family.

35
0:01:59.965,000 --> 0:02:02,000
He had just been released from his 27 years of incarceration,

36
0:02:03.389,000 --> 0:02:05,000
and was in a period of readjustment

37
0:02:06.016,000 --> 0:02:08,000
to his sudden global icon status.

38
0:02:08.675,000 --> 0:02:1,000
Members of the African National Congress

39
0:02:11.175,000 --> 0:02:12,000
thought that in the bush

40
0:02:13.166,000 --> 0:02:15,000
he would have time to rest and recuperate

41
0:02:15.4,000 --> 0:02:16,000
away from the public eye,

42
0:02:17.161,000 --> 0:02:2,000
and it's true that lions tend to be

43
0:02:20.54,000 --> 0:02:24,000
a very good deterrent to press and paparazzi.

44
0:02:24.771,000 --> 0:02:26,000
(Laughter)

45
0:02:26.9,000 --> 0:02:28,000
But it was a defining time for me as a young boy.

46
0:02:29.446,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I would take him breakfast in bed,

47
0:02:31.507,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and then, in an old track suit and slippers,

48
0:02:33.875,000 --> 0:02:35,000
he would go for a walk around the garden.

49
0:02:36.48,000 --> 0:02:37,000
At night, I would sit with my family

50
0:02:38.158,000 --> 0:02:4,000
around the snowy, bunny-eared TV,

51
0:02:40.659,000 --> 0:02:42,000
and watch images of that same

52
0:02:43.077,000 --> 0:02:44,000
quiet man from the garden

53
0:02:45.011,000 --> 0:02:48,000
surrounded by hundreds and thousands of people

54
0:02:48.061,000 --> 0:02:51,000
as scenes from his release were broadcast nightly.

55
0:02:51.32,000 --> 0:02:52,000
He was bringing peace

56
0:02:53.272,000 --> 0:02:55,000
to a divided and violent South Africa,

57
0:02:56.154,000 --> 0:03:01,000
one man with an unbelievable sense of his humanity.

58
0:03:01.383,000 --> 0:03:03,000
Mandela said often that the gift of prison

59
0:03:04.147,000 --> 0:03:06,000
was the ability to go within and to think,

60
0:03:07.107,000 --> 0:03:08,000
to create in himself

61
0:03:08.836,000 --> 0:03:1,000
the things he most wanted for South Africa:

62
0:03:11.715,000 --> 0:03:14,000
peace, reconciliation, harmony.

63
0:03:15.06,000 --> 0:03:17,000
Through this act of immense open-heartedness,

64
0:03:17.915,000 --> 0:03:19,000
he was to become the embodiment

65
0:03:20.147,000 --> 0:03:23,000
of what in South Africa we call "ubuntu."

66
0:03:23.686,000 --> 0:03:25,000
Ubuntu: I am because of you.

67
0:03:26.535,000 --> 0:03:28,000
Or, people are not people

68
0:03:29.198,000 --> 0:03:31,000
without other people.

69
0:03:31.923,000 --> 0:03:32,000
It's not a new idea or value

70
0:03:33.769,000 --> 0:03:34,000
but it's one that I certainly think at these times

71
0:03:35.624,000 --> 0:03:36,000
is worth building on.

72
0:03:37.373,000 --> 0:03:4,000
In fact, it is said that in the collective consciousness of Africa,

73
0:03:40.537,000 --> 0:03:42,000
we get to experience the deepest parts

74
0:03:42.576,000 --> 0:03:43,000
of our own humanity

75
0:03:43.881,000 --> 0:03:45,000
through our interactions with others.

76
0:03:46.665,000 --> 0:03:48,000
Ubuntu is at play right now.

77
0:03:48.777,000 --> 0:03:5,000
You are holding a space for me

78
0:03:50.777,000 --> 0:03:53,000
to express the deepest truth of who I am.

79
0:03:54.169,000 --> 0:03:56,000
Without you, I'm just a guy talking to an empty room,

80
0:03:56.429,000 --> 0:03:59,000
and I spent a lot of time last week doing that,

81
0:03:59.507,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and it's not the same as this.

82
0:04:02.83,000 --> 0:04:04,000
(Laughter)

83
0:04:05.256,000 --> 0:04:08,000
If Mandela was the national and international embodiment,

84
0:04:08.704,000 --> 0:04:09,000
then the man who taught me the most

85
0:04:10.298,000 --> 0:04:12,000
about this value personally was this man,

86
0:04:12.901,000 --> 0:04:13,000
Solly Mhlongo.

87
0:04:14.259,000 --> 0:04:15,000
Solly was born under a tree

88
0:04:16.067,000 --> 0:04:18,000
60 kilometers from where I grew up in Mozambique.

89
0:04:18.853,000 --> 0:04:19,000
He would never have a lot of money,

90
0:04:20.353,000 --> 0:04:21,000
but he was to be

91
0:04:21.775,000 --> 0:04:23,000
one of the richest men I would ever meet.

92
0:04:24.404,000 --> 0:04:26,000
Solly grew up tending to his father's cattle.

93
0:04:27.123,000 --> 0:04:31,000
Now, I can tell you, I don't know what it is about people who grow up looking after cattle,

94
0:04:31.305,000 --> 0:04:34,000
but it makes for über-resourcefulness.

95
0:04:34.327,000 --> 0:04:36,000
The first job that he ever got in the safari business

96
0:04:36.801,000 --> 0:04:38,000
was fixing the safari trucks.

97
0:04:39.017,000 --> 0:04:41,000
Where he had learned to do that out in the bush

98
0:04:41.671,000 --> 0:04:43,000
I have no idea, but he could do it.

99
0:04:43.8,000 --> 0:04:44,000
He then moved across into what we called

100
0:04:45.727,000 --> 0:04:46,000
the habitat team.

101
0:04:47.114,000 --> 0:04:48,000
These were the people on the reserve

102
0:04:49,000 --> 0:04:51,000
who were responsible for its well-being.

103
0:04:51.357,000 --> 0:04:53,000
He fixed roads, he mended wetlands,

104
0:04:53.641,000 --> 0:04:54,000
he did some anti-poaching.

105
0:04:55.459,000 --> 0:04:57,000
And then one day we were out together,

106
0:04:57.585,000 --> 0:05:,000
and he came across the tracks of where a female leopard had walked.

107
0:05:01.116,000 --> 0:05:02,000
And it was an old track,

108
0:05:02.89,000 --> 0:05:04,000
but for fun he turned and he began to follow it,

109
0:05:05.331,000 --> 0:05:06,000
and I tell you, I could tell by the speed

110
0:05:06.906,000 --> 0:05:07,000
at which he moved on those pad marks

111
0:05:08.603,000 --> 0:05:11,000
that this man was a Ph.D.-level tracker.

112
0:05:12.577,000 --> 0:05:13,000
If you drove past Solly

113
0:05:14.351,000 --> 0:05:15,000
somewhere out on the reserve,

114
0:05:16.029,000 --> 0:05:17,000
you look up in your rearview mirror,

115
0:05:17.678,000 --> 0:05:18,000
you'd see he'd stopped the car

116
0:05:19.523,000 --> 0:05:21,000
20, 50 meters down the road

117
0:05:21.569,000 --> 0:05:24,000
just in case you need help with something.

118
0:05:24.582,000 --> 0:05:26,000
The only accusation I ever heard leveled at him

119
0:05:27.335,000 --> 0:05:28,000
was when one of our clients said,

120
0:05:28.73,000 --> 0:05:31,000
"Solly, you are pathologically helpful."

121
0:05:31.947,000 --> 0:05:33,000
(Laughter)

122
0:05:34.394,000 --> 0:05:36,000
When I started professionally guiding people

123
0:05:37.285,000 --> 0:05:38,000
out into this environment,

124
0:05:38.942,000 --> 0:05:39,000
Solly was my tracker.

125
0:05:40.502,000 --> 0:05:41,000
We worked together as a team.

126
0:05:42.321,000 --> 0:05:44,000
And the first guests we ever got

127
0:05:44.347,000 --> 0:05:46,000
were a philanthropy group from your East Coast,

128
0:05:47.194,000 --> 0:05:49,000
and they said to Solly, on the side, they said,

129
0:05:49.548,000 --> 0:05:51,000
"Before we even go out to see lions and leopards,

130
0:05:52.189,000 --> 0:05:54,000
we want to see where you live."

131
0:05:54.251,000 --> 0:05:55,000
So we took them up to his house,

132
0:05:55.716,000 --> 0:05:57,000
and this visit of the philanthropist to his house

133
0:05:58.588,000 --> 0:06:,000
coincided with a time when Solly's wife,

134
0:06:01.269,000 --> 0:06:02,000
who was learning English,

135
0:06:02.869,000 --> 0:06:04,000
was going through a phase where she would open the door

136
0:06:05.053,000 --> 0:06:07,000
by saying, "Hello, I love you.

137
0:06:07.717,000 --> 0:06:09,000
Welcome, I love you." (Laughter)

138
0:06:09.932,000 --> 0:06:11,000
And there was something so beautifully African

139
0:06:12.481,000 --> 0:06:13,000
about it to me, this small house

140
0:06:14.326,000 --> 0:06:16,000
with a huge heart in it.

141
0:06:16.911,000 --> 0:06:22,000
Now on the day that Solly saved my life,

142
0:06:23.486,000 --> 0:06:25,000
he was already my hero.

143
0:06:25.497,000 --> 0:06:26,000
It was a hot day,

144
0:06:27.078,000 --> 0:06:28,000
and we found ourselves down by the river.

145
0:06:29.052,000 --> 0:06:31,000
Because of the heat, I took my shoes off,

146
0:06:31.888,000 --> 0:06:32,000
and I rolled up my pants,

147
0:06:33.591,000 --> 0:06:35,000
and I walked into the water.

148
0:06:35.832,000 --> 0:06:36,000
Solly remained on the bank.

149
0:06:37.394,000 --> 0:06:4,000
The water was clear running over sand,

150
0:06:40.417,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and we turned and we began to make our way upstream.

151
0:06:43.731,000 --> 0:06:44,000
And a few meters ahead of us,

152
0:06:45.551,000 --> 0:06:47,000
there was a place where a tree had fallen out of the bank,

153
0:06:48.536,000 --> 0:06:5,000
and its branches were touching the water,

154
0:06:51.307,000 --> 0:06:52,000
and it was shadowy.

155
0:06:52.904,000 --> 0:06:54,000
And if had been a horror movie,

156
0:06:55.362,000 --> 0:06:57,000
people in the audience would have started saying,

157
0:06:57.598,000 --> 0:07:,000
"Don't go in there. Don't go in there." (Laughter)

158
0:07:01.051,000 --> 0:07:04,000
And of course, the crocodile was in the shadows.

159
0:07:04.808,000 --> 0:07:06,000
Now the first thing that you notice when a crocodile hits you

160
0:07:06.923,000 --> 0:07:07,000
is the ferocity of the bite.

161
0:07:08.523,000 --> 0:07:09,000
Wham! It hits me by my right leg.

162
0:07:10.496,000 --> 0:07:13,000
It pulls me. It turns. I throw my hand up. I'm able to grab a branch.

163
0:07:14.399,000 --> 0:07:15,000
It's shaking me violently.

164
0:07:16.137,000 --> 0:07:17,000
It's a very strange sensation

165
0:07:17.851,000 --> 0:07:18,000
having another creature try and eat you,

166
0:07:19.797,000 --> 0:07:22,000
and there are few things that promote vegetarianism like that.

167
0:07:23.248,000 --> 0:07:24,000
(Laughter)

168
0:07:24.843,000 --> 0:07:26,000
Solly on the bank sees that I'm in trouble.

169
0:07:27.128,000 --> 0:07:29,000
He turns. He begins to make his way to me.

170
0:07:29.175,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The croc again continues to shake me.

171
0:07:31.126,000 --> 0:07:32,000
It goes to bite me a second time.

172
0:07:33.043,000 --> 0:07:35,000
I notice a slick of blood in the water around me

173
0:07:35.232,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that gets washed downstream.

174
0:07:36.836,000 --> 0:07:38,000
As it bites the second time, I kick.

175
0:07:39.009,000 --> 0:07:41,000
My foot goes down its throat. It spits me out.

176
0:07:41.742,000 --> 0:07:43,000
I pull myself up into the branches,

177
0:07:43.873,000 --> 0:07:46,000
and as I come out of the water, I look over my shoulder.

178
0:07:47.356,000 --> 0:07:48,000
My leg from the knee down

179
0:07:49.276,000 --> 0:07:5,000
is mangled beyond description.

180
0:07:51.204,000 --> 0:07:52,000
The bone is cracked.

181
0:07:52.599,000 --> 0:07:53,000
The meat is torn up.

182
0:07:54.429,000 --> 0:07:58,000
I make an instant decision that I'll never look at that again.

183
0:07:59.029,000 --> 0:08:01,000
As I come out of the water,

184
0:08:01.413,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Solly arrives at a deep section,

185
0:08:04.03,000 --> 0:08:05,000
a channel between us.

186
0:08:05.655,000 --> 0:08:07,000
He knows, he sees the state of my leg,

187
0:08:07.793,000 --> 0:08:08,000
he knows that between him and I

188
0:08:09.639,000 --> 0:08:1,000
there is a crocodile,

189
0:08:10.851,000 --> 0:08:12,000
and I can tell you this man doesn't slow down for one second.

190
0:08:13.343,000 --> 0:08:14,000
He comes straight into the channel.

191
0:08:15.149,000 --> 0:08:16,000
He wades in to above his waist.

192
0:08:17.084,000 --> 0:08:18,000
He gets to me. He grabs me.

193
0:08:18.547,000 --> 0:08:19,000
I'm still in a vulnerable position.

194
0:08:20.219,000 --> 0:08:21,000
He picks me and puts me on his shoulder.

195
0:08:21.944,000 --> 0:08:23,000
This is the other thing about Solly, he's freakishly strong.

196
0:08:24.363,000 --> 0:08:26,000
He turns. He walks me up the bank.

197
0:08:26.826,000 --> 0:08:28,000
He lays me down. He pulls his shirt off.

198
0:08:28.88,000 --> 0:08:29,000
He wraps it around my leg,

199
0:08:30.664,000 --> 0:08:31,000
picks me up a second time,

200
0:08:31.955,000 --> 0:08:32,000
walks me to a vehicle,

201
0:08:33.861,000 --> 0:08:36,000
and he's able to get me to medical attention.

202
0:08:37.285,000 --> 0:08:4,000
And I survive.

203
0:08:40.508,000 --> 0:08:44,000
Now  (Applause)

204
0:08:44.769,000 --> 0:08:46,000
Now I don't know how many people you know

205
0:08:47.479,000 --> 0:08:49,000
that go into a deep channel of water

206
0:08:49.695,000 --> 0:08:51,000
that they know has a crocodile in it

207
0:08:51.955,000 --> 0:08:52,000
to come and help you,

208
0:08:53.298,000 --> 0:08:56,000
but for Solly, it was as natural as breathing.

209
0:08:56.742,000 --> 0:08:58,000
And he is one amazing example

210
0:08:59.198,000 --> 0:09:02,000
of what I have experienced all over Africa.

211
0:09:02.643,000 --> 0:09:04,000
In a more collective society,

212
0:09:04.774,000 --> 0:09:06,000
we realize from the inside

213
0:09:07.622,000 --> 0:09:1,000
that our own well-being is deeply tied

214
0:09:10.755,000 --> 0:09:13,000
to the well-being of others.

215
0:09:13.993,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Danger is shared. Pain is shared.

216
0:09:17.262,000 --> 0:09:19,000
Joy is shared. Achievement is shared.

217
0:09:20.187,000 --> 0:09:24,000
Houses are shared. Food is shared.

218
0:09:24.717,000 --> 0:09:27,000
Ubuntu asks us to open our hearts

219
0:09:27.913,000 --> 0:09:28,000
and to share,

220
0:09:29.327,000 --> 0:09:3,000
and what Solly taught me that day

221
0:09:31.279,000 --> 0:09:33,000
is the essence of this value,

222
0:09:33.282,000 --> 0:09:35,000
his animated, empathetic action

223
0:09:36.04,000 --> 0:09:38,000
in every moment.

224
0:09:38.085,000 --> 0:09:41,000
Now although the root word is about people,

225
0:09:41.592,000 --> 0:09:44,000
I thought that maybe ubuntu was only about people.

226
0:09:44.966,000 --> 0:09:47,000
And then I met this young lady.

227
0:09:48.24,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Her name was Elvis.

228
0:09:49.934,000 --> 0:09:5,000
In fact, Solly gave her the name Elvis

229
0:09:51.705,000 --> 0:09:53,000
because he said she walked like she was doing

230
0:09:54.562,000 --> 0:09:56,000
the Elvis the pelvis dance.

231
0:09:57.227,000 --> 0:10:01,000
She was born with very badly deformed back legs and pelvis.

232
0:10:01.593,000 --> 0:10:03,000
She arrived at our reserve from a reserve

233
0:10:03.857,000 --> 0:10:05,000
east of us on her migratory route.

234
0:10:05.913,000 --> 0:10:06,000
When I first saw her,

235
0:10:07.692,000 --> 0:10:09,000
I thought she would be dead in a matter of days.

236
0:10:10.16,000 --> 0:10:12,000
And yet, for the next five years

237
0:10:13.088,000 --> 0:10:15,000
she returned in the winter months.

238
0:10:15.618,000 --> 0:10:17,000
And we would be so excited to be out in the bush

239
0:10:17.995,000 --> 0:10:19,000
and to come across this unusual track.

240
0:10:20.391,000 --> 0:10:21,000
It looked like an inverted bracket,

241
0:10:21.886,000 --> 0:10:23,000
and we would drop whatever we were doing and we would follow,

242
0:10:24.335,000 --> 0:10:25,000
and then we would come around the corner,

243
0:10:26.006,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and there she would be with her herd.

244
0:10:28.092,000 --> 0:10:3,000
And that outpouring of emotion

245
0:10:30.987,000 --> 0:10:31,000
from people on our safari trucks

246
0:10:32.701,000 --> 0:10:35,000
as they saw her, it was this sense of kinship.

247
0:10:35.943,000 --> 0:10:36,000
And it reminded me

248
0:10:37.428,000 --> 0:10:38,000
that even people who grow up in cities

249
0:10:39.359,000 --> 0:10:42,000
feel a natural connection

250
0:10:42.944,000 --> 0:10:44,000
with the natural world and with animals.

251
0:10:45.215,000 --> 0:10:48,000
And yet still I remained amazed that she was surviving.

252
0:10:48.799,000 --> 0:10:5,000
And then one day we came across them at this small water hole.

253
0:10:51.76,000 --> 0:10:52,000
It was sort of a hollow in the ground.

254
0:10:53.612,000 --> 0:10:55,000
And I watched as the matriarch drank,

255
0:10:56.066,000 --> 0:10:59,000
and then she turned in that beautiful slow motion of elephants,

256
0:10:59.341,000 --> 0:11:,000
looks like the arm in motion,

257
0:11:01.11,000 --> 0:11:04,000
and she began to make her way up the steep bank.

258
0:11:04.116,000 --> 0:11:08,000
The rest of the herd turned and began to follow.

259
0:11:08.76,000 --> 0:11:09,000
And I watched young Elvis

260
0:11:10.544,000 --> 0:11:13,000
begin to psych herself up for the hill.

261
0:11:13.9,000 --> 0:11:16,000
She got visibly -- ears came forward,

262
0:11:17.255,000 --> 0:11:19,000
she had a full go of it and halfway up,

263
0:11:19.404,000 --> 0:11:21,000
her legs gave way, and she fell backwards.

264
0:11:21.681,000 --> 0:11:22,000
She attempted it a second time,

265
0:11:23.5,000 --> 0:11:26,000
and again, halfway up, she fell backwards.

266
0:11:26.675,000 --> 0:11:27,000
And on the third attempt,

267
0:11:28.532,000 --> 0:11:3,000
an amazing thing happened.

268
0:11:30.989,000 --> 0:11:31,000
Halfway up the bank,

269
0:11:32.726,000 --> 0:11:35,000
a young teenage elephant came in behind her,

270
0:11:35.799,000 --> 0:11:37,000
and he propped his trunk underneath her,

271
0:11:38.002,000 --> 0:11:41,000
and he began to shovel her up the bank.

272
0:11:41.339,000 --> 0:11:42,000
And it occurred to me

273
0:11:42.727,000 --> 0:11:43,000
that the rest of the herd

274
0:11:44.283,000 --> 0:11:46,000
was in fact looking after this young elephant.

275
0:11:46.958,000 --> 0:11:48,000
The next day I watched again

276
0:11:49.482,000 --> 0:11:51,000
as the matriarch broke a branch

277
0:11:51.652,000 --> 0:11:52,000
and she would put it in her mouth,

278
0:11:53.493,000 --> 0:11:54,000
and then she would break a second one

279
0:11:55.45,000 --> 0:11:57,000
and drop it on the ground.

280
0:11:58.157,000 --> 0:12:,000
And a consensus developed between all of us

281
0:12:00.529,000 --> 0:12:01,000
who were guiding people in that area

282
0:12:02.378,000 --> 0:12:05,000
that that herd was in fact moving slower

283
0:12:05.527,000 --> 0:12:09,000
to accommodate that elephant.

284
0:12:09.583,000 --> 0:12:11,000
What Elvis and the herd taught me

285
0:12:11.674,000 --> 0:12:14,000
caused me to expand my definition of ubuntu,

286
0:12:14.998,000 --> 0:12:16,000
and I believe that in the cathedral of the wild,

287
0:12:17.614,000 --> 0:12:19,000
we get to see the most beautiful parts of ourselves

288
0:12:19.825,000 --> 0:12:2,000
reflected back at us.

289
0:12:21.582,000 --> 0:12:24,000
And it is not only through other people

290
0:12:25.222,000 --> 0:12:27,000
that we get to experience our humanity

291
0:12:28.142,000 --> 0:12:31,000
but through all the creatures that live on this planet.

292
0:12:32.068,000 --> 0:12:34,000
If Africa has a gift to share,

293
0:12:34.882,000 --> 0:12:37,000
it's a gift of a more collective society.

294
0:12:38.709,000 --> 0:12:42,000
And while it's true that ubuntu is an African idea,

295
0:12:42.957,000 --> 0:12:46,000
what I see is the essence of that value

296
0:12:47.368,000 --> 0:12:49,000
being invented here.

297
0:12:49.73,000 --> 0:12:51,000
Thank you.

298
0:12:51.845,000 --> 0:12:55,000
(Applause)

299
0:13:16.082,000 --> 0:13:17,000
Pat Mitchell: So Boyd,

300
0:13:17.879,000 --> 0:13:22,000
we know that you knew President Mandela

301
0:13:22.92,000 --> 0:13:23,000
from early childhood

302
0:13:24.897,000 --> 0:13:26,000
and that you heard the news as we all did today,

303
0:13:27.796,000 --> 0:13:29,000
and deeply distraught

304
0:13:30.236,000 --> 0:13:34,000
and know the tragic loss that it is to the world.

305
0:13:34.667,000 --> 0:13:36,000
But I just wondered if you wanted

306
0:13:36.749,000 --> 0:13:37,000
to share any additional thoughts,

307
0:13:38.655,000 --> 0:13:4,000
because we know that you heard that news

308
0:13:40.729,000 --> 0:13:43,000
just before coming in to do this session.

309
0:13:44.109,000 --> 0:13:45,000
Boyd Varty: Well thanks, Pat.

310
0:13:45.805,000 --> 0:13:48,000
I'm so happy because it was time for him to pass on.

311
0:13:48.988,000 --> 0:13:49,000
He was suffering.

312
0:13:50.759,000 --> 0:13:52,000
And so of course there's the mixed emotions.

313
0:13:53.157,000 --> 0:13:54,000
But I just think of so many occurrences

314
0:13:55.141,000 --> 0:13:57,000
like the time he went on the Oprah show

315
0:13:57.548,000 --> 0:13:59,000
and asked her what the show would be about.

316
0:14:00.404,000 --> 0:14:01,000
(Laughter)

317
0:14:01.882,000 --> 0:14:04,000
And she was like, "Well, it'll be about you."

318
0:14:05.18,000 --> 0:14:07,000
I mean, that's just incredible humility.

319
0:14:07.928,000 --> 0:14:1,000
(Laughter)

320
0:14:11.591,000 --> 0:14:14,000
He was the father of our nation

321
0:14:14.753,000 --> 0:14:2,000
and we've got a road to walk in South Africa.

322
0:14:21.201,000 --> 0:14:24,000
And everything, they used to call it Madiba magic.

323
0:14:24.611,000 --> 0:14:26,000
You know, he used to go to a rugby match and we would win.

324
0:14:27.394,000 --> 0:14:3,000
Anywhere he went, things went well.

325
0:14:30.855,000 --> 0:14:32,000
But I think that magic will be with us,

326
0:14:33.236,000 --> 0:14:36,000
and the important thing is that we carry

327
0:14:36.797,000 --> 0:14:37,000
what he stood for.

328
0:14:38.322,000 --> 0:14:41,000
And so that's what I'm going to try and do,

329
0:14:41.809,000 --> 0:14:43,000
and that's what people all over South Africa are trying to do.

330
0:14:44.701,000 --> 0:14:46,000
PM: And that's what you've done today. BV: Oh, thank you.

331
0:14:46.927,000 --> 0:14:49,000
PM: Thank you. BV: Thank you. Thanks very much.

332
0:14:50.066,000 --> 0:14:54,000

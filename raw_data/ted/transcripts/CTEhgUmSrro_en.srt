1
0:00:16.101,000 --> 0:00:18,000
I'm actually going to share something with you

2
0:00:18.291,000 --> 0:00:2,000
I haven't talked about probably in more than 10 years.

3
0:00:21.212,000 --> 0:00:24,000
So bear with me as I take you through this journey.

4
0:00:24.882,000 --> 0:00:25,000
When I was 22 years old,

5
0:00:26.381,000 --> 0:00:29,000
I came home from work, put a leash on my dog

6
0:00:29.907,000 --> 0:00:3,000
and went for my usual run.

7
0:00:32.613,000 --> 0:00:33,000
I had no idea that at that moment,

8
0:00:34.324,000 --> 0:00:35,000
my life was going to change forever.

9
0:00:36.935,000 --> 0:00:38,000
While I was preparing my dog for the run,

10
0:00:40.482,000 --> 0:00:43,000
a man was finishing drinking at a bar,

11
0:00:43.656,000 --> 0:00:45,000
picked up his car keys, got into a car

12
0:00:46.021,000 --> 0:00:47,000
and headed south,

13
0:00:47.577,000 --> 0:00:48,000
or wherever he was.

14
0:00:50.536,000 --> 0:00:51,000
I was running across the street,

15
0:00:52.108,000 --> 0:00:54,000
and the only thing that I actually remember

16
0:00:54.312,000 --> 0:00:56,000
is feeling like a grenade went off in my head.

17
0:00:57.478,000 --> 0:01:,000
And I remember putting my hands on the ground

18
0:01:01.184,000 --> 0:01:02,000
and feeling my life's blood

19
0:01:03.07,000 --> 0:01:06,000
emptying out of my neck and my mouth.

20
0:01:08.478,000 --> 0:01:1,000
What had happened is, he ran a red light

21
0:01:10.682,000 --> 0:01:11,000
and hit me and my dog.

22
0:01:12.823,000 --> 0:01:14,000
She ended up underneath the car.

23
0:01:16.157,000 --> 0:01:17,000
I flew out in front of the car,

24
0:01:17.742,000 --> 0:01:19,000
and then he ran over my legs.

25
0:01:19.956,000 --> 0:01:21,000
My left leg got caught up in the wheel well --

26
0:01:22.202,000 --> 0:01:23,000
spun it around.

27
0:01:26.452,000 --> 0:01:28,000
The bumper of the car hit my throat,

28
0:01:28.539,000 --> 0:01:29,000
slicing it open.

29
0:01:30.984,000 --> 0:01:31,000
I ended up with blunt chest trauma.

30
0:01:33.608,000 --> 0:01:36,000
Your aorta comes up behind your heart, it's your major artery --

31
0:01:37.625,000 --> 0:01:41,000
and it was severed, so my blood was gurgling out of my mouth.

32
0:01:42.486,000 --> 0:01:45,000
It foamed, and ... horrible things were happening to me.

33
0:01:48.461,000 --> 0:01:49,000
I had no idea what was going on,

34
0:01:50.175,000 --> 0:01:51,000
but strangers intervened,

35
0:01:53.159,000 --> 0:01:55,000
kept my heart moving, beating.

36
0:01:55.76,000 --> 0:01:57,000
I say "moving," because it was quivering,

37
0:01:58.07,000 --> 0:02:,000
and they were trying to put a beat back into it.

38
0:02:01.07,000 --> 0:02:03,000
Somebody was smart and put a Bic pen in my neck

39
0:02:04.055,000 --> 0:02:07,000
to open up my airway, so I could get some air in there.

40
0:02:07.413,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And my lung collapsed,

41
0:02:08.76,000 --> 0:02:1,000
so somebody cut me open and put a pen in there as well,

42
0:02:11.759,000 --> 0:02:16,000
to stop that catastrophic event from happening.

43
0:02:18.857,000 --> 0:02:2,000
Somehow I ended up at the hospital.

44
0:02:21.077,000 --> 0:02:22,000
I was wrapped in ice,

45
0:02:22.364,000 --> 0:02:25,000
and then eventually put into a drug-induced coma.

46
0:02:27.43,000 --> 0:02:29,000
Eighteen months later, I woke up.

47
0:02:30.87,000 --> 0:02:31,000
I was blind, I couldn't speak

48
0:02:32.76,000 --> 0:02:33,000
and I couldn't walk.

49
0:02:34.673,000 --> 0:02:35,000
I was 64 pounds.

50
0:02:40.545,000 --> 0:02:43,000
The hospital really has no idea what to do with people like that.

51
0:02:44.556,000 --> 0:02:46,000
And in fact, they started to call me a "gomer."

52
0:02:47.76,000 --> 0:02:49,000
That's another story we won't even get into.

53
0:02:51.693,000 --> 0:02:54,000
I had so many surgeries to put my neck back together,

54
0:02:55.05,000 --> 0:02:56,000
to repair my heart a few times.

55
0:02:56.76,000 --> 0:02:58,000
Some things worked, some things didn't.

56
0:02:59.302,000 --> 0:03:,000
I had lots of titanium put in me;

57
0:03:01.217,000 --> 0:03:02,000
cadaver bones,

58
0:03:02.653,000 --> 0:03:04,000
to try to get my feet moving the right way.

59
0:03:05.93,000 --> 0:03:06,000
And I ended up with a plastic nose,

60
0:03:07.679,000 --> 0:03:09,000
porcelain teeth and all kinds of other things.

61
0:03:09.893,000 --> 0:03:11,000
But eventually, I started to look human again.

62
0:03:15.04,000 --> 0:03:16,000
But ...

63
0:03:19.101,000 --> 0:03:21,000
It's hard sometimes to talk about these things,

64
0:03:21.369,000 --> 0:03:22,000
so bear with me.

65
0:03:23.553,000 --> 0:03:25,000
I had more than 50 surgeries.

66
0:03:25.955,000 --> 0:03:26,000
But who's counting?

67
0:03:27.58,000 --> 0:03:28,000
(Laughter)

68
0:03:29.387,000 --> 0:03:32,000
So eventually, the hospital decided it was time for me to go.

69
0:03:32.658,000 --> 0:03:34,000
They needed to open up space for somebody else

70
0:03:35.516,000 --> 0:03:38,000
that they thought could come back

71
0:03:38.76,000 --> 0:03:4,000
from whatever they were going through.

72
0:03:41.76,000 --> 0:03:43,000
Everybody lost faith in me being able to recover.

73
0:03:45.158,000 --> 0:03:48,000
So they basically put a map up on the wall, threw a dart,

74
0:03:48.221,000 --> 0:03:5,000
and it landed at a senior home, here in Colorado.

75
0:03:52.76,000 --> 0:03:54,000
And I know all of you are scratching your head:

76
0:03:55.023,000 --> 0:03:56,000
"A senior citizens' home?

77
0:03:56.274,000 --> 0:03:58,000
What in the world are you going to do there?"

78
0:03:58.428,000 --> 0:04:,000
But if you think about all of the skills and talent

79
0:04:00.883,000 --> 0:04:02,000
that are in this room right now,

80
0:04:03.455,000 --> 0:04:05,000
that's what a senior home has.

81
0:04:05.518,000 --> 0:04:07,000
So there were all these skills and talents

82
0:04:07.604,000 --> 0:04:08,000
that these seniors had.

83
0:04:09.56,000 --> 0:04:11,000
The one advantage they had over most of you

84
0:04:12.449,000 --> 0:04:13,000
is wisdom,

85
0:04:13.624,000 --> 0:04:15,000
because they had a long life.

86
0:04:16.37,000 --> 0:04:18,000
And I needed that wisdom at that moment in my life.

87
0:04:19.615,000 --> 0:04:2,000
But imagine what it was like for them

88
0:04:21.435,000 --> 0:04:22,000
when I showed up at their doorstep.

89
0:04:24.277,000 --> 0:04:27,000
At that point, I had gained four pounds, so I was 68 pounds.

90
0:04:28.261,000 --> 0:04:29,000
I was bald.

91
0:04:30.139,000 --> 0:04:32,000
I was wearing hospital scrubs.

92
0:04:32.17,000 --> 0:04:34,000
And somebody donated tennis shoes for me.

93
0:04:34.861,000 --> 0:04:37,000
And I had a white cane in one hand

94
0:04:38.054,000 --> 0:04:41,000
and a suitcase full of medical records in another hand.

95
0:04:41.443,000 --> 0:04:43,000
So the senior citizens realized

96
0:04:43.658,000 --> 0:04:45,000
that they needed to have an emergency meeting.

97
0:04:45.974,000 --> 0:04:46,000
(Laughter)

98
0:04:47.76,000 --> 0:04:49,000
So they pulled back and they were looking at each other,

99
0:04:50.76,000 --> 0:04:54,000
and they were going, "OK, what skills do we have in this room?

100
0:04:54.855,000 --> 0:04:56,000
This kid needs a lot of work."

101
0:04:57.529,000 --> 0:05:01,000
So they eventually started matching their talents and skills

102
0:05:02.362,000 --> 0:05:03,000
to all of my needs.

103
0:05:04.275,000 --> 0:05:06,000
But one of the first things they needed to do

104
0:05:06.459,000 --> 0:05:08,000
was assess what I needed right away.

105
0:05:08.658,000 --> 0:05:11,000
I needed to figure out how to eat like a normal human being,

106
0:05:11.821,000 --> 0:05:14,000
since I'd been eating through a tube in my chest

107
0:05:15.186,000 --> 0:05:16,000
and through my veins.

108
0:05:16.76,000 --> 0:05:19,000
So I had to go through trying to eat again.

109
0:05:19.987,000 --> 0:05:2,000
And they went through that process.

110
0:05:22.169,000 --> 0:05:23,000
And then they had to figure out:

111
0:05:23.76,000 --> 0:05:24,000
"Well, she needs furniture.

112
0:05:25.535,000 --> 0:05:28,000
She is sleeping in the corner of this apartment."

113
0:05:28.64,000 --> 0:05:3,000
So they went to their storage lockers

114
0:05:30.76,000 --> 0:05:31,000
and all gathered their extra furniture --

115
0:05:32.76,000 --> 0:05:34,000
gave me pots and pans, blankets --

116
0:05:36.298,000 --> 0:05:37,000
everything.

117
0:05:38.577,000 --> 0:05:41,000
And then the next thing that I needed

118
0:05:42.079,000 --> 0:05:43,000
was a makeover.

119
0:05:43.556,000 --> 0:05:44,000
(Laughter)

120
0:05:44.73,000 --> 0:05:45,000
So out went the green scrubs,

121
0:05:46.309,000 --> 0:05:48,000
and in came the polyester and floral prints.

122
0:05:49.199,000 --> 0:05:53,000
(Laughter)

123
0:05:53.514,000 --> 0:05:55,000
We're not going to talk about the hairstyles

124
0:05:55.646,000 --> 0:05:58,000
they tried to force on me once my hair grew back.

125
0:05:59.263,000 --> 0:06:,000
But I did say no to the blue hair.

126
0:06:01.022,000 --> 0:06:03,000
(Laughter)

127
0:06:04.577,000 --> 0:06:07,000
So eventually, what went on is,

128
0:06:08.277,000 --> 0:06:1,000
they decided that, well, I need to learn to speak.

129
0:06:11.181,000 --> 0:06:12,000
You can't be an independent person

130
0:06:13.009,000 --> 0:06:15,000
if you're not able to speak and you can't see.

131
0:06:15.76,000 --> 0:06:17,000
So they figured not being able to see is one thing,

132
0:06:18.701,000 --> 0:06:19,000
but they need to get me to talk.

133
0:06:20.76,000 --> 0:06:22,000
So while Sally, the office manager,

134
0:06:23.76,000 --> 0:06:24,000
was teaching me to speak in the day --

135
0:06:25.68,000 --> 0:06:29,000
it's hard, because when you're a kid, you take things for granted.

136
0:06:29.829,000 --> 0:06:3,000
You learn things unconsciously.

137
0:06:31.55,000 --> 0:06:34,000
But for me, I was an adult and it was embarrassing,

138
0:06:35.041,000 --> 0:06:38,000
and I had to learn how to coordinate my new throat with my tongue

139
0:06:38.967,000 --> 0:06:4,000
and my new teeth and my lips,

140
0:06:41.76,000 --> 0:06:43,000
and capture the air and get the word out.

141
0:06:44.255,000 --> 0:06:45,000
So, I acted like a two-year-old,

142
0:06:46.107,000 --> 0:06:47,000
and refused to work.

143
0:06:49.412,000 --> 0:06:51,000
But the men had a better idea.

144
0:06:51.924,000 --> 0:06:53,000
They were going to make it fun for me.

145
0:06:54.27,000 --> 0:06:57,000
So they were teaching me cuss-word Scrabble at night.

146
0:06:58.069,000 --> 0:07:01,000
(Laughter)

147
0:07:02.372,000 --> 0:07:05,000
And then, secretly, how to swear like a sailor.

148
0:07:06.026,000 --> 0:07:07,000
(Laughter)

149
0:07:07.063,000 --> 0:07:1,000
I'm going to just leave it to your imagination

150
0:07:10.895,000 --> 0:07:12,000
as to what my first words were --

151
0:07:13.435,000 --> 0:07:13,000
(Laughter)

152
0:07:14.45,000 --> 0:07:16,000
when Sally finally got my confidence built.

153
0:07:17.451,000 --> 0:07:19,000
(Laughter)

154
0:07:19.664,000 --> 0:07:21,000
So I moved on from there.

155
0:07:21.688,000 --> 0:07:24,000
And a former teacher who happened to have Alzheimer's

156
0:07:24.888,000 --> 0:07:26,000
took on the task of teaching me to write.

157
0:07:28.616,000 --> 0:07:3,000
The redundancy was actually good for me.

158
0:07:30.957,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So, we'll just keep moving on.

159
0:07:32.76,000 --> 0:07:36,000
(Laughter)

160
0:07:39.629,000 --> 0:07:41,000
One of the pivotal times for me

161
0:07:41.848,000 --> 0:07:43,000
was actually learning to cross the street again

162
0:07:44.539,000 --> 0:07:45,000
as a blind person.

163
0:07:47.26,000 --> 0:07:48,000
So close your eyes.

164
0:07:49.521,000 --> 0:07:51,000
Now imagine you have to cross a street.

165
0:07:52.439,000 --> 0:07:54,000
You don't know how far that street is,

166
0:07:56.121,000 --> 0:07:58,000
and you don't know if you're going straight.

167
0:07:58.76,000 --> 0:08:,000
And you hear cars whizzing back and forth,

168
0:08:02.168,000 --> 0:08:03,000
and you had a horrible accident

169
0:08:03.76,000 --> 0:08:05,000
that landed you in this situation.

170
0:08:06.553,000 --> 0:08:08,000
So there were two obstacles I had to get through.

171
0:08:09.76,000 --> 0:08:11,000
One was post-traumatic stress disorder.

172
0:08:13.192,000 --> 0:08:16,000
Every time I approached the corner or the curb,

173
0:08:16.977,000 --> 0:08:17,000
I would panic.

174
0:08:18.288,000 --> 0:08:19,000
And the second one

175
0:08:20.113,000 --> 0:08:23,000
was actually trying to figure out how to cross that street.

176
0:08:23.76,000 --> 0:08:25,000
So one of the seniors just came up to me,

177
0:08:26.67,000 --> 0:08:29,000
and she pushed me up to the corner and said,

178
0:08:30.026,000 --> 0:08:32,000
"When you think it's time to go, just stick the cane out there.

179
0:08:33.045,000 --> 0:08:34,000
If it's hit, don't cross the street."

180
0:08:34.896,000 --> 0:08:39,000
(Laughter)

181
0:08:40.415,000 --> 0:08:41,000
Made perfect sense.

182
0:08:41.864,000 --> 0:08:42,000
(Laughter)

183
0:08:43.025,000 --> 0:08:46,000
But by the third cane that went whizzing across the road --

184
0:08:46.638,000 --> 0:08:47,000
(Laughter)

185
0:08:48.013,000 --> 0:08:51,000
they realized that they needed to put their resources together,

186
0:08:51.094,000 --> 0:08:52,000
and they raised funds

187
0:08:52.588,000 --> 0:08:54,000
so that I could go to the Braille Institute

188
0:08:54.699,000 --> 0:08:58,000
and actually gain the skills to be a blind person,

189
0:08:59.32,000 --> 0:09:,000
and also to go get a guide dog,

190
0:09:01.342,000 --> 0:09:02,000
who transformed my life.

191
0:09:03.215,000 --> 0:09:04,000
And I was able to return to college

192
0:09:05.008,000 --> 0:09:08,000
because of the senior citizens who invested in me,

193
0:09:08.76,000 --> 0:09:11,000
and also the guide dog and skill set I had gained.

194
0:09:12.76,000 --> 0:09:14,000
Ten years later, I gained my sight back.

195
0:09:15.054,000 --> 0:09:16,000
Not magically --

196
0:09:17.125,000 --> 0:09:19,000
I opted in for three surgeries,

197
0:09:20.118,000 --> 0:09:21,000
and one of them was experimental.

198
0:09:22.012,000 --> 0:09:23,000
It was actually robotic surgery

199
0:09:23.76,000 --> 0:09:25,000
that removed a hematoma from behind my eye.

200
0:09:28.356,000 --> 0:09:32,000
The biggest change for me was that the world moved forward,

201
0:09:33.209,000 --> 0:09:37,000
that there were innovations and all kinds of new things --

202
0:09:37.275,000 --> 0:09:38,000
cellphones, laptops,

203
0:09:39.228,000 --> 0:09:41,000
all these things that I had never seen before.

204
0:09:41.899,000 --> 0:09:42,000
And as a blind person,

205
0:09:43.575,000 --> 0:09:45,000
your visual memory fades,

206
0:09:46.118,000 --> 0:09:5,000
and is replaced with how you feel about things

207
0:09:50.16,000 --> 0:09:51,000
and how things sound

208
0:09:52.003,000 --> 0:09:53,000
and how things smell.

209
0:09:54.76,000 --> 0:09:56,000
So one day, I was in my room

210
0:09:57.27,000 --> 0:09:59,000
and I saw this thing sitting in my room.

211
0:09:59.367,000 --> 0:10:,000
I thought it was a monster,

212
0:10:00.76,000 --> 0:10:02,000
so I was walking around it.

213
0:10:02.899,000 --> 0:10:04,000
And I go, "I'm just going to touch it."

214
0:10:04.925,000 --> 0:10:05,000
And I touched it and I went,

215
0:10:06.331,000 --> 0:10:08,000
"Oh my God, it's a laundry basket."

216
0:10:09.592,000 --> 0:10:11,000
(Laughter)

217
0:10:13.477,000 --> 0:10:17,000
Everything is different when you're a sighted person,

218
0:10:17.537,000 --> 0:10:18,000
because you take that for granted.

219
0:10:19.223,000 --> 0:10:23,000
But when you're blind, you have the tactile memory for things.

220
0:10:24.075,000 --> 0:10:26,000
The biggest change for me was looking down at my hands

221
0:10:26.648,000 --> 0:10:28,000
and seeing that I'd lost 10 years of my life.

222
0:10:30.561,000 --> 0:10:33,000
I thought that time had stood still for some reason

223
0:10:33.644,000 --> 0:10:34,000
and moved on for family and friends.

224
0:10:35.502,000 --> 0:10:36,000
But when I looked down,

225
0:10:37.01,000 --> 0:10:39,000
I realized that time marched on for me, too,

226
0:10:39.604,000 --> 0:10:4,000
and that I needed to get caught up.

227
0:10:41.352,000 --> 0:10:42,000
So I got going on it.

228
0:10:44.427,000 --> 0:10:47,000
We didn't have words like "crowdsourcing" and "radical collaboration"

229
0:10:48.371,000 --> 0:10:49,000
when I had my accident.

230
0:10:50.113,000 --> 0:10:51,000
But the concept held true --

231
0:10:51.9,000 --> 0:10:53,000
people working with people to rebuild me;

232
0:10:54.337,000 --> 0:10:56,000
people working with people to reeducate me.

233
0:10:57.17,000 --> 0:10:58,000
I wouldn't be standing here today

234
0:10:59.011,000 --> 0:11:02,000
if it wasn't for extreme radical collaboration.

235
0:11:02.76,000 --> 0:11:03,000
Thank you so much.

236
0:11:04.078,000 --> 0:11:07,000
(Applause)

1
0:00:13.165,000 --> 0:00:16,000
I'm an ocean microbiologist at the University of Tennessee,

2
0:00:16.637,000 --> 0:00:18,000
and I want to tell you guys about some microbes

3
0:00:19.206,000 --> 0:00:22,000
that are so strange and wonderful

4
0:00:22.424,000 --> 0:00:25,000
that they're challenging our assumptions about what life is like on Earth.

5
0:00:26.251,000 --> 0:00:27,000
So I have a question.

6
0:00:27.704,000 --> 0:00:3,000
Please raise your hand if you've ever thought it would be cool

7
0:00:30.771,000 --> 0:00:32,000
to go to the bottom of the ocean in a submarine?

8
0:00:34.372,000 --> 0:00:35,000
Yes.

9
0:00:35.546,000 --> 0:00:37,000
Most of you, because the oceans are so cool.

10
0:00:37.746,000 --> 0:00:39,000
Alright, now -- please raise your hand

11
0:00:40.473,000 --> 0:00:43,000
if the reason you raised your hand to go to the bottom of the ocean

12
0:00:44.187,000 --> 0:00:46,000
is because it would get you a little bit closer

13
0:00:46.502,000 --> 0:00:48,000
to that exciting mud that's down there.

14
0:00:49.219,000 --> 0:00:5,000
(Laughter)

15
0:00:50.251,000 --> 0:00:51,000
Nobody.

16
0:00:51.565,000 --> 0:00:52,000
I'm the only one in this room.

17
0:00:53.414,000 --> 0:00:54,000
Well, I think about this all the time.

18
0:00:55.424,000 --> 0:00:57,000
I spend most of my waking hours

19
0:00:57.713,000 --> 0:01:,000
trying to determine how deep we can go into the Earth

20
0:01:01.523,000 --> 0:01:04,000
and still find something, anything, that's alive,

21
0:01:05.3,000 --> 0:01:08,000
because we still don't know the answer to this very basic question

22
0:01:08.42,000 --> 0:01:09,000
about life on Earth.

23
0:01:09.643,000 --> 0:01:12,000
So in the 1980s, a scientist named John Parkes, in the UK,

24
0:01:13.267,000 --> 0:01:14,000
was similarly obsessed,

25
0:01:15.195,000 --> 0:01:17,000
and he came up with a crazy idea.

26
0:01:17.816,000 --> 0:01:22,000
He believed that there was a vast, deep, and living microbial biosphere

27
0:01:23.498,000 --> 0:01:24,000
underneath all the world's oceans

28
0:01:25.117,000 --> 0:01:27,000
that extends hundreds of meters into the seafloor,

29
0:01:27.759,000 --> 0:01:28,000
which is cool,

30
0:01:28.934,000 --> 0:01:31,000
but the only problem is that nobody believed him,

31
0:01:32.1,000 --> 0:01:34,000
and the reason that nobody believed him

32
0:01:34.887,000 --> 0:01:38,000
is that ocean sediments may be the most boring place on Earth.

33
0:01:39.091,000 --> 0:01:4,000
(Laughter)

34
0:01:40.201,000 --> 0:01:43,000
There's no sunlight, there's no oxygen,

35
0:01:43.26,000 --> 0:01:44,000
and perhaps worst of all,

36
0:01:44.823,000 --> 0:01:48,000
there's no fresh food deliveries for literally millions of years.

37
0:01:49.022,000 --> 0:01:5,000
You don't have to have a PhD in biology

38
0:01:50.988,000 --> 0:01:52,000
to know that that is a bad place to go looking for life.

39
0:01:53.647,000 --> 0:01:54,000
(Laughter)

40
0:01:54.678,000 --> 0:01:57,000
But in 2002, [Steven D'Hondt] had convinced enough people

41
0:01:57.909,000 --> 0:02:,000
that he was on to something that he actually got an expedition

42
0:02:01.551,000 --> 0:02:04,000
on this drillship, called the JOIDES Resolution.

43
0:02:05.097,000 --> 0:02:08,000
And he ran it along with Bo Barker Jørgensen of Denmark.

44
0:02:08.201,000 --> 0:02:09,000
And so they were finally able to get

45
0:02:09.947,000 --> 0:02:12,000
good pristine deep subsurface samples

46
0:02:13.336,000 --> 0:02:15,000
some really without contamination from surface microbes.

47
0:02:16.173,000 --> 0:02:21,000
This drill ship is capable of drilling thousands of meters underneath the ocean,

48
0:02:21.47,000 --> 0:02:24,000
and the mud comes up in sequential cores, one after the other --

49
0:02:24.99,000 --> 0:02:26,000
long, long cores that look like this.

50
0:02:27.684,000 --> 0:02:3,000
This is being carried by scientists such as myself who go on these ships,

51
0:02:31.517,000 --> 0:02:34,000
and we process the cores on the ships and then we send them home

52
0:02:34.541,000 --> 0:02:36,000
to our home laboratories for further study.

53
0:02:36.664,000 --> 0:02:37,000
So when John and his colleagues

54
0:02:38.165,000 --> 0:02:41,000
got these first precious deep-sea pristine samples,

55
0:02:41.744,000 --> 0:02:42,000
they put them under the microscope,

56
0:02:43.649,000 --> 0:02:47,000
and they saw images that looked pretty much like this,

57
0:02:47.782,000 --> 0:02:49,000
which is actually taken from a more recent expedition

58
0:02:50.283,000 --> 0:02:52,000
by my PhD student, Joy Buongiorno.

59
0:02:52.493,000 --> 0:02:54,000
You can see the hazy stuff in the background.

60
0:02:54.805,000 --> 0:02:56,000
That's mud. That's deep-sea ocean mud,

61
0:02:57.614,000 --> 0:03:,000
and the bright green dots stained with the green fluorescent dye

62
0:03:01.625,000 --> 0:03:03,000
are real, living microbes.

63
0:03:05.173,000 --> 0:03:08,000
Now I've got to tell you something really tragic about microbes.

64
0:03:08.227,000 --> 0:03:1,000
They all look the same under a microscope,

65
0:03:10.33,000 --> 0:03:11,000
I mean, to a first approximation.

66
0:03:11.961,000 --> 0:03:14,000
You can take the most fascinating organisms in the world,

67
0:03:15.577,000 --> 0:03:18,000
like a microbe that literally breathes uranium,

68
0:03:19.267,000 --> 0:03:21,000
and another one that makes rocket fuel,

69
0:03:21.703,000 --> 0:03:22,000
mix them up with some ocean mud,

70
0:03:23.283,000 --> 0:03:25,000
put them underneath a microscope,

71
0:03:25.504,000 --> 0:03:26,000
and they're just little dots.

72
0:03:27.339,000 --> 0:03:28,000
It's really annoying.

73
0:03:28.794,000 --> 0:03:3,000
So we can't use their looks to tell them apart.

74
0:03:31.309,000 --> 0:03:33,000
We have to use DNA, like a fingerprint,

75
0:03:33.493,000 --> 0:03:34,000
to say who is who.

76
0:03:35.238,000 --> 0:03:37,000
And I'll teach you guys how to do it right now.

77
0:03:37.524,000 --> 0:03:41,000
So I made up some data, and I'm going to show you some data that are not real.

78
0:03:41.564,000 --> 0:03:43,000
This is to illustrate what it would look like

79
0:03:43.771,000 --> 0:03:46,000
if a bunch of species were not related to each other at all.

80
0:03:47.722,000 --> 0:03:5,000
So you can see each species

81
0:03:50.964,000 --> 0:03:54,000
has a list of combinations of A, G, C and T,

82
0:03:55.187,000 --> 0:03:56,000
which are the four sub-units of DNA,

83
0:03:56.926,000 --> 0:03:59,000
sort of randomly jumbled, and nothing looks like anything else,

84
0:04:00.735,000 --> 0:04:02,000
and these species are totally unrelated to each other.

85
0:04:03.37,000 --> 0:04:05,000
But this is what real DNA looks like,

86
0:04:05.449,000 --> 0:04:07,000
from a gene that these species happen to share.

87
0:04:08.477,000 --> 0:04:1,000
Everything lines up nearly perfectly.

88
0:04:11.489,000 --> 0:04:14,000
The chances of getting so many of those vertical columns

89
0:04:14.933,000 --> 0:04:17,000
where every species has a C or every species has a T,

90
0:04:18.346,000 --> 0:04:2,000
by random chance, are infinitesimal.

91
0:04:21.155,000 --> 0:04:25,000
So we know that all those species had to have had a common ancestor.

92
0:04:26.092,000 --> 0:04:27,000
They're all relatives of each other.

93
0:04:28.013,000 --> 0:04:29,000
So now I'll tell you who they are.

94
0:04:30.338,000 --> 0:04:32,000
The top two are us and chimpanzees,

95
0:04:32.966,000 --> 0:04:35,000
which y'all already knew were related, because, I mean, obviously.

96
0:04:36.585,000 --> 0:04:37,000
(Laughter)

97
0:04:38.069,000 --> 0:04:4,000
But we're also related to things that we don't look like,

98
0:04:40.871,000 --> 0:04:44,000
like pine trees and Giardia, which is that gastrointestinal disease

99
0:04:45.418,000 --> 0:04:48,000
you can get if you don't filter your water while you're hiking.

100
0:04:48.449,000 --> 0:04:52,000
We're also related to bacteria like E. coli and Clostridium difficile,

101
0:04:53.387,000 --> 0:04:56,000
which is a horrible, opportunistic pathogen that kills lots of people.

102
0:04:56.873,000 --> 0:05:,000
But there's of course good microbes too, like Dehalococcoides ethenogenes,

103
0:05:01.071,000 --> 0:05:03,000
which cleans up our industrial waste for us.

104
0:05:03.963,000 --> 0:05:05,000
So if I take these DNA sequences,

105
0:05:06.726,000 --> 0:05:09,000
and then I use them, the similarities and differences between them,

106
0:05:09.893,000 --> 0:05:1,000
to make a family tree for all of us

107
0:05:11.746,000 --> 0:05:12,000
so you can see who is closely related,

108
0:05:13.635,000 --> 0:05:14,000
then this is what it looks like.

109
0:05:15.564,000 --> 0:05:17,000
So you can see clearly, at a glance,

110
0:05:17.871,000 --> 0:05:22,000
that things like us and Giardia and bunnies and pine trees

111
0:05:23.212,000 --> 0:05:24,000
are all, like, siblings,

112
0:05:25.012,000 --> 0:05:28,000
and then the bacteria are like our ancient cousins.

113
0:05:28.116,000 --> 0:05:32,000
But we're kin to every living thing on Earth.

114
0:05:32.313,000 --> 0:05:34,000
So in my job, on a daily basis,

115
0:05:34.805,000 --> 0:05:38,000
I get to produce scientific evidence against existential loneliness.

116
0:05:39.16,000 --> 0:05:41,000
So when we got these first DNA sequences,

117
0:05:42.048,000 --> 0:05:46,000
from the first cruise, of pristine samples from the deep subsurface,

118
0:05:46.272,000 --> 0:05:47,000
we wanted to know where they were.

119
0:05:48.145,000 --> 0:05:51,000
So the first thing that we discovered is that they were not aliens,

120
0:05:51.383,000 --> 0:05:54,000
because we could get their DNA to line up with everything else on Earth.

121
0:05:54.992,000 --> 0:05:57,000
But now check out where they go on our tree of life.

122
0:05:59.468,000 --> 0:06:02,000
The first thing you'll notice is that there's a lot of them.

123
0:06:02.594,000 --> 0:06:03,000
It wasn't just one little species

124
0:06:04.443,000 --> 0:06:06,000
that managed to live in this horrible place.

125
0:06:06.586,000 --> 0:06:07,000
It's kind of a lot of things.

126
0:06:08.093,000 --> 0:06:09,000
And the second thing that you'll notice,

127
0:06:10.075,000 --> 0:06:14,000
hopefully, is that they're not like anything we've ever seen before.

128
0:06:15.482,000 --> 0:06:17,000
They are as different from each other

129
0:06:17.64,000 --> 0:06:19,000
as they are from anything that we've known before

130
0:06:20.529,000 --> 0:06:21,000
as we are from pine trees.

131
0:06:22.514,000 --> 0:06:25,000
So John Parkes was completely correct.

132
0:06:26.18,000 --> 0:06:3,000
He, and we, had discovered a completely new and highly diverse

133
0:06:30.871,000 --> 0:06:31,000
microbial ecosystem on Earth

134
0:06:32.865,000 --> 0:06:35,000
that no one even knew existed before the 1980s.

135
0:06:37.159,000 --> 0:06:38,000
So now we were on a roll.

136
0:06:38.716,000 --> 0:06:42,000
The next step was to grow these exotic species in a petri dish

137
0:06:43.452,000 --> 0:06:45,000
so that we could do real experiments on them

138
0:06:45.646,000 --> 0:06:47,000
like microbiologists are supposed to do.

139
0:06:48.09,000 --> 0:06:49,000
But no matter what we fed them,

140
0:06:49.675,000 --> 0:06:5,000
they refused to grow.

141
0:06:51.825,000 --> 0:06:55,000
Even now, 15 years and many expeditions later,

142
0:06:55.856,000 --> 0:07:,000
no human has ever gotten a single one of these exotic deep subsurface microbes

143
0:07:01.284,000 --> 0:07:02,000
to grow in a petri dish.

144
0:07:02.971,000 --> 0:07:03,000
And it's not for lack of trying.

145
0:07:05.185,000 --> 0:07:06,000
That may sound disappointing,

146
0:07:07.185,000 --> 0:07:08,000
but I actually find it exhilarating,

147
0:07:08.932,000 --> 0:07:11,000
because it means there are so many tantalizing unknowns to work on.

148
0:07:12.527,000 --> 0:07:15,000
Like, my colleagues and I got what we thought was a really great idea.

149
0:07:16.138,000 --> 0:07:19,000
We were going to read their genes like a recipe book,

150
0:07:19.443,000 --> 0:07:22,000
find out what it was they wanted to eat and put it in their petri dishes,

151
0:07:22.944,000 --> 0:07:23,000
and then they would grow and be happy.

152
0:07:24.879,000 --> 0:07:25,000
But when we looked at their genes,

153
0:07:26.554,000 --> 0:07:3,000
it turns out that what they wanted to eat was the food we were already feeding them.

154
0:07:30.646,000 --> 0:07:31,000
So that was a total wash.

155
0:07:32.28,000 --> 0:07:34,000
There was something else that they wanted in their petri dishes

156
0:07:35.281,000 --> 0:07:36,000
that we were just not giving them.

157
0:07:38.248,000 --> 0:07:41,000
So by combining measurements from many different places

158
0:07:41.978,000 --> 0:07:42,000
around the world,

159
0:07:43.16,000 --> 0:07:46,000
my colleagues at the University of Southern California,

160
0:07:46.847,000 --> 0:07:47,000
Doug LaRowe and Jan Amend,

161
0:07:48.577,000 --> 0:07:52,000
were able to calculate that each one of these deep-sea microbial cells

162
0:07:53.304,000 --> 0:07:56,000
requires only one zeptowatt of power,

163
0:07:56.694,000 --> 0:07:59,000
and before you get your phones out, a zepto is 10 to the minus 21,

164
0:08:00.658,000 --> 0:08:02,000
because I know I would want to look that up.

165
0:08:02.73,000 --> 0:08:03,000
Humans, on the other hand,

166
0:08:04.285,000 --> 0:08:06,000
require about 100 watts of power.

167
0:08:06.898,000 --> 0:08:09,000
So 100 watts is basically if you take a pineapple

168
0:08:10.433,000 --> 0:08:16,000
and drop it from about waist height to the ground 881,632 times a day.

169
0:08:16.667,000 --> 0:08:18,000
If you did that and then linked it up to a turbine,

170
0:08:19.072,000 --> 0:08:22,000
that would create enough power to make me happen for a day.

171
0:08:23.177,000 --> 0:08:25,000
A zeptowatt, if you put it in similar terms,

172
0:08:25.994,000 --> 0:08:29,000
is if you take just one grain of salt

173
0:08:30.101,000 --> 0:08:33,000
and then you imagine a tiny, tiny, little ball

174
0:08:33.743,000 --> 0:08:36,000
that is one thousandth of the mass of that one grain of salt

175
0:08:37.383,000 --> 0:08:39,000
and then you drop it one nanometer,

176
0:08:40.216,000 --> 0:08:44,000
which is a hundred times smaller than the wavelength of visible light,

177
0:08:44.422,000 --> 0:08:45,000
once per day.

178
0:08:46.773,000 --> 0:08:49,000
That's all it takes to make these microbes live.

179
0:08:50.717,000 --> 0:08:55,000
That's less energy than we ever thought would be capable of supporting life,

180
0:08:56.106,000 --> 0:08:59,000
but somehow, amazingly, beautifully,

181
0:08:59.204,000 --> 0:09:,000
it's enough.

182
0:09:01.37,000 --> 0:09:02,000
So if these deep-subsurface microbes

183
0:09:03.227,000 --> 0:09:06,000
have a very different relationship with energy than we previously thought,

184
0:09:06.803,000 --> 0:09:07,000
then it follows that they'll have to have

185
0:09:08.791,000 --> 0:09:1,000
a different relationship with time as well,

186
0:09:10.972,000 --> 0:09:13,000
because when you live on such tiny energy gradients,

187
0:09:14.091,000 --> 0:09:15,000
rapid growth is impossible.

188
0:09:15.81,000 --> 0:09:18,000
If these things wanted to colonize our throats and make us sick,

189
0:09:18.851,000 --> 0:09:2,000
they would get muscled out by fast-growing streptococcus

190
0:09:21.495,000 --> 0:09:23,000
before they could even initiate cell division.

191
0:09:23.68,000 --> 0:09:25,000
So that's why we never find them in our throats.

192
0:09:27.537,000 --> 0:09:31,000
Perhaps the fact that the deep subsurface is so boring

193
0:09:31.736,000 --> 0:09:33,000
is actually an asset to these microbes.

194
0:09:34.25,000 --> 0:09:36,000
They never get washed out by a storm.

195
0:09:36.362,000 --> 0:09:38,000
They never get overgrown by weeds.

196
0:09:39.125,000 --> 0:09:42,000
All they have to do is exist.

197
0:09:42.807,000 --> 0:09:46,000
Maybe that thing that we were missing in our petri dishes

198
0:09:46.841,000 --> 0:09:47,000
was not food at all.

199
0:09:48.586,000 --> 0:09:49,000
Maybe it wasn't a chemical.

200
0:09:50.088,000 --> 0:09:51,000
Maybe the thing that they really want,

201
0:09:51.938,000 --> 0:09:53,000
the nutrient that they want, is time.

202
0:09:56.095,000 --> 0:09:59,000
But time is the one thing that I'll never be able to give them.

203
0:09:59.695,000 --> 0:10:02,000
So even if I have a cell culture that I pass to my PhD students,

204
0:10:02.933,000 --> 0:10:04,000
who pass it to their PhD students, and so on,

205
0:10:05.448,000 --> 0:10:07,000
we'd have to do that for thousands of years

206
0:10:08.04,000 --> 0:10:11,000
in order to mimic the exact conditions of the deep subsurface,

207
0:10:11.295,000 --> 0:10:13,000
all without growing any contaminants.

208
0:10:13.638,000 --> 0:10:14,000
It's just not possible.

209
0:10:15.637,000 --> 0:10:18,000
But maybe in a way we already have grown them in our petri dishes.

210
0:10:18.787,000 --> 0:10:2,000
Maybe they looked at all that food we offered them and said,

211
0:10:21.621,000 --> 0:10:22,000
"Thanks, I'm going to speed up so much

212
0:10:23.507,000 --> 0:10:25,000
that I'm going to make a new cell next century.

213
0:10:25.771,000 --> 0:10:26,000
Ugh.

214
0:10:26.956,000 --> 0:10:27,000
(Laughter)

215
0:10:28.019,000 --> 0:10:33,000
So why is it that the rest of biology moves so fast?

216
0:10:33.152,000 --> 0:10:34,000
Why does a cell die after a day

217
0:10:35.082,000 --> 0:10:37,000
and a human dies after only a hundred years?

218
0:10:37.617,000 --> 0:10:39,000
These seem like really arbitrarily short limits

219
0:10:40.082,000 --> 0:10:42,000
when you think about the total amount of time in the universe.

220
0:10:43.105,000 --> 0:10:45,000
But these are not arbitrary limits.

221
0:10:45.94,000 --> 0:10:47,000
They're dictated by one simple thing,

222
0:10:48.855,000 --> 0:10:5,000
and that thing is the Sun.

223
0:10:51.785,000 --> 0:10:53,000
Once life figured out how to harness the energy of the Sun

224
0:10:54.559,000 --> 0:10:55,000
through photosynthesis,

225
0:10:55.745,000 --> 0:10:57,000
we all had to speed up and get on day and night cycles.

226
0:10:58.688,000 --> 0:11:01,000
In that way, the Sun gave us both a reason to be fast

227
0:11:02.066,000 --> 0:11:03,000
and the fuel to do it.

228
0:11:03.697,000 --> 0:11:05,000
You can view most of life on Earth like a circulatory system,

229
0:11:06.58,000 --> 0:11:07,000
and the Sun is our beating heart.

230
0:11:09.064,000 --> 0:11:11,000
But the deep subsurface is like a circulatory system

231
0:11:11.921,000 --> 0:11:13,000
that's completely disconnected from the Sun.

232
0:11:14.38,000 --> 0:11:18,000
It's instead being driven by long, slow geological rhythms.

233
0:11:19.933,000 --> 0:11:24,000
There's currently no theoretical limit on the lifespan of one single cell.

234
0:11:26.632,000 --> 0:11:29,000
As long as there is at least a tiny energy gradient to exploit,

235
0:11:30.624,000 --> 0:11:32,000
theoretically, a single cell could live

236
0:11:32.832,000 --> 0:11:34,000
for hundreds of thousands of years or more,

237
0:11:34.998,000 --> 0:11:36,000
simply by replacing broken parts over time.

238
0:11:38.047,000 --> 0:11:42,000
To ask a microbe that lives like that to grow in our petri dishes

239
0:11:42.404,000 --> 0:11:47,000
is to ask them to adapt to our frenetic, Sun-centric, fast way of living,

240
0:11:47.491,000 --> 0:11:49,000
and maybe they've got better things to do than that.

241
0:11:50.008,000 --> 0:11:51,000
(Laughter)

242
0:11:51.341,000 --> 0:11:55,000
Imagine if we could figure out how they managed to do this.

243
0:11:55.642,000 --> 0:11:58,000
What if it involves some cool, ultra-stable compounds

244
0:11:58.952,000 --> 0:12:,000
that we could use to increase the shelf life

245
0:12:01.237,000 --> 0:12:03,000
in biomedical or industrial applications?

246
0:12:03.848,000 --> 0:12:05,000
Or maybe if we figure out the mechanism that they use

247
0:12:06.428,000 --> 0:12:09,000
to grow so extraordinarily slowly,

248
0:12:09.57,000 --> 0:12:12,000
we could mimic it in cancer cells and slow runaway cell division.

249
0:12:13.928,000 --> 0:12:14,000
I don't know.

250
0:12:15.142,000 --> 0:12:18,000
I mean, honestly, that is all speculation,

251
0:12:18.197,000 --> 0:12:2,000
but the only thing I know for certain

252
0:12:20.67,000 --> 0:12:24,000
is that there are a hundred billion billion billlion

253
0:12:24.767,000 --> 0:12:26,000
living microbial cells

254
0:12:26.895,000 --> 0:12:28,000
underlying all the world's oceans.

255
0:12:29.117,000 --> 0:12:33,000
That's 200 times more than the total biomass of humans on this planet.

256
0:12:33.966,000 --> 0:12:36,000
And those microbes have a fundamentally different relationship

257
0:12:37.696,000 --> 0:12:38,000
with time and energy than we do.

258
0:12:39.989,000 --> 0:12:41,000
What seems like a day to them

259
0:12:42.255,000 --> 0:12:44,000
might be a thousand years to us.

260
0:12:45.072,000 --> 0:12:47,000
They don't care about the Sun,

261
0:12:47.115,000 --> 0:12:49,000
and they don't care about growing fast,

262
0:12:49.35,000 --> 0:12:51,000
and they probably don't give a damn about my petri dishes ...

263
0:12:52.271,000 --> 0:12:53,000
(Laughter)

264
0:12:53.334,000 --> 0:12:56,000
but if we can continue to find creative ways to study them,

265
0:12:57.284,000 --> 0:13:03,000
then maybe we'll finally figure out what life, all of life, is like on Earth.

266
0:13:04.031,000 --> 0:13:05,000
Thank you.

267
0:13:05.206,000 --> 0:13:06,000
(Applause)
